Several animated films like Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie (2024) and Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax (2012) provide a way to hold onto the season, especially with their focus on the ocean, summer sun and the environment.\n\nOther films provide an escape from the back-to-school dread that some might be feeling, whether it be the Oscar-winning VFX in Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color or the antics in Migration, there are many options. Pearl even gives an early taste of all things spooky.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\n‘Godzilla Minus One’, Remastered In Black And White, Sets U.S. Theatrical Run\n\nNetflix Unveils New Animated Films ‘In Your Dreams’ & ‘Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie,’ Additional ‘Nimona’ Voice Cast, First Look At ‘Chicken Run: Dawn Of The Nugget’ & More\n\nTi West Interview: The 'MaXXXine' Director Ends The 'X' Trilogy With A Look At The Seedy Side Of Hollywood In The Excessive '80s - Karlovy Vary\n\nBelow find the best seven movies streaming on Netflix in August 2024:\n\nGodzilla Minus One Minus Color – August 1\n\nThe Oscar-winning film stripped of its color will land on the streamer August 1. The visual effects of the film beat Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Napoleon, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and The Creator for the Academy Award, which was accepted by writer and director Takashi Yamazaki as well as Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takahashi and Tatsuji Nojima.\n\nThe Lorax – August 1\n\nFrom its colorfully animated Thneed trees and idyllic environment to Ed Helms and Rob Riggle singing tunes as their animated characters The Once-ler and Mr. O’Hare, The Lorax — based on one of Dr. Seuss’ children’s books — tells a great story about environmentalism. The voice cast alone of Zac Efron, Taylor Swift, Jenny Slate, Betty White, Nasim Pedrad and of course, Danny DeVito as the mustachioed orange creature lays a great foundation for the story of how failing to care for Earth could lead to dire consequences. Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat starring Mike Myers, Spencer Breslin, Dakota Fanning, Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston will also arrive to the streamer on August 1.\n\nThe Spectacular Now – August 1\n\nFrom A24, director James Ponsoldt, and writers Scott Neustadter, Michael H. Weber and Tim Tharp, The Spectacular Now follows Sutter (Miles Teller) who parties hard as a senior in high school with girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson) until one day Cassidy breaks up with Sutter. When he meets Aimee (Shailene Woodley), his family hopes that she rubs off on him as a good influence. The film also stars Kyle Chandler, Bob Odenkirk, Dayo Okeniyi, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kaitlyn Dever and more.\n\nSaving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie – August 2\n\nIn association with the 25th anniversary of Spongebob Squarepants, Netflix will release Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie (2024) all about the squirrel costar of the famous Nickelodeon sponge. Seen as a sidekick in Spongebob’s previous television movies and the animated series, Sandy and her family will get a spotlight in this film when Bikini Bottom gets scooped out of the ocean. The squirrel and sponge will venture to Texas, Sandy’s former home, to save the sandy city. Carolyn Lawrence and Tom Kenny will return to reprise their voice roles of Sandy Cheeks and Spongebob Squarepants. Bill Fagerbakke will voice Patrick. Additional voices and actors include Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Wanda Sykes, Roger Bumpass, Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, Grey DeLisle, Ilia Isorelýs Paulino and Matty Cadarpole.\n\nPearl – August 16\n\nWith MaXXXine’s release last month, some may want to revisit the second film in Ti West’s trilogy, which lays out the backstory of Pearl (Mia Goth), who attacks MaXXXine (also Mia Goth) and her friends in the first film X (2022). The prequel movie demonstrates why the assailant turned out to be the way she did due to her horrible home life and overall isolation in 1918. David Corenswet also appears as a Projectionist who shows Pearl movies and gets her on the track to wanting to be a star.\n\nMigration – August 19\n\nMigration (2023) promises fun for the whole family as a quartet of ducks — parents Mack (Kumail Nanjiani) and Pam (Elizabeth Banks) and their children Dax (Caspar Jennings) and Gwen (Tresi Gazal) venture away from the pond they’ve called home their whole lives. Overprotective father Mack takes the most persuading to embark on their journey south, where they meet birds like Chump (voiced by Awkwafina), Delroy (Keegan-Michael Key) and more. They narrowly escape danger many times, learning countless lessons along the way.\n\nIncoming – August 23\n\nKind of like an inverse Booksmart (2019), Incoming follows four freshman boys who want to climb the social totem pole in high school. The film, directed by David and John Chernin, culminates in their first-ever party, thrown by one of the boys’ older brothers. Come for Benj Nielsen as Mason Thames, Ramon Reed as Eddie and Raphael Alejandro as Connor and stay for Isabella Ferreira as Bailey and Bobby Cannavale as Mr. Studebaker.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\n2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\n‘The Morning Show’ Season 4: Everything We Know So Far\n\nAll the Surprise Songs Taylor Swift Has Played On The Eras Tour So Far"
