        "text": "95+ Taiwan Facts & Statistics\n\nTheo\n\nI've lived in Taiwan for over 5 years and love discovering all it has to offer. I made this blog to share Taiwan living and travel resources I wish I'd had.\n\nLast Updated:\n\nCategory: Taiwanese Culture\n\nThis post contains affiliate links; I may earn a commission if you make a purchase through them.\n\nWe’ll dive into facts about various aspects of Taiwan. These will include history, technology, fun facts, and more. Keep reading to learn what’s in store.\n\nI’ve learned a lot of impressive facts about Taiwan that make me wonder why they don’t play a larger role in the world stage. Keep reading to see what I found.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nTaiwan produces 60% of the world’s semiconductors.\n\nFood & beverage market to grow 3.7% by 2027.\n\n$17,659 disposable income per capita.\n\n51.3% online shopping rate.\n\n6/10 people in Taiwan own scooters.\n\n55% recycling rate.\n\n9 national parks in Taiwan.\n\nLGBTQ+ legal rights score: 85/100.\n\nTSMC holds 61% global semiconductor foundry market share.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nGeography\n\nHere are some facts about Taiwan’s geography:\n\nTaiwan has an average of 226 earthquakes each year.\n\nMost quakes are between the magnitudes of 4.4 and 5.7.\n\nThe country’s largest earthquake was 7.3 ML or 7.7 Mw in 1999.\n\nHas an average of 11 typhoons per year.\n\n80.2% of the population lives in urban areas.\n\nThe country’s total land area is 13,672 sq. miles (35,410 Km2).\n\nTaipei 101 was built to withstand wind speeds of up to 134 mph and the strongest earthquake in a 2,500-year cycle [1 PDF]\n\n6 recorded instances of tsunamis have hit Taiwan since 1661.\n\nHas more than 268 mountain peaks.\n\nTaiwan’s highest mountain is Yushan. Standing at 3,952 meters (12,966 ft)\n\nOutlying islands: Taiwan governs several smaller outlying islands, including Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, Green Island, and Orchid Island.\n\nThere’s also Taiping Island, which is 1,637 km (2,634 miles) from mainland Taiwan. China (PROC), Vietnam, and the Philippines also claim this island.\n\nLet’s move on to historical facts.\n\nHistory\n\nCheck out these facts about Taiwan’s history:\n\nDespite being considered the nation’s founding father, Sun Yat-Sen allegedly visited Taiwan 3 times. 1900, 1913, and 1918 [2].\n\nIn 1924, Sun Yat-Sen visited Keelung Harbor but didn’t leave his boat.\n\nTainan City was Taiwan’s capital from 1683 to 1887 under the Qing Dynasty [3].\n\nNow it’s Taipei.\n\nTaiwan’s constitution labels the nation as the “Republic of China (ROC).” Or 中華民國 (Zhōnghuá Mínguó). However, most of the world knows the country as “Taiwan.”\n\nIn the 17th century, the Dutch established a colony in southern Taiwan, followed briefly by the Spanish in the north.\n\nAfter the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, China (not the PROC) was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan.\n\nDespite political restrictions, Taiwan experienced rapid economic growth and became one of the “Asian Tigers” in the mid-’60s.\n\nTaiwan transitioned to a full democracy in the 1990s, culminating in the first direct presidential election in 1996.\n\nSun Yat-sen studied in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nSun Yat-sen had 4 wives from different countries [4 pretty disturbing].\n\nNote: I heard he had 6 wives, but I couldn’t find information confirming this.\n\nTaiwan relocated many Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) statues to the Cihu Memorial Sculpture Park to address his controversial legacy.\n\nHere’s a tidbit that deserves its own section.\n\nTaiwan’s Past Name\n\nBetween the 13th and 17th centuries, Portuguese settlers came in contact with Taiwanese indigenous people and named the island Formosa.\n\n1642\n\nThe Dutch and Spanish colonists lost control of the island to the Qing Dynasty (ancient China). Han Chinese immigrants fled to the island and renamed it Taiwan.\n\n1885\n\nIt became the Republic of Formosa for a year until the Japanese Empire took control of Taiwan. After the Sino-Japanese war. Their rule lasted until 1945. They stuck with the name “Taiwan.”\n\nThe fallen Japanese Empire transferred the rule of Taiwan to the Republic of China, which the Kuomintang (KMT) led. Not the People’s Republic of China—what everyone calls “China.”\n\nAfter losing a civil war to the Chinese Communist Party, the KMT fled to Taiwan.\n\nToday, Taiwan keeps the official name “Republic of China.” Why? This isn’t an article discussing geopolitical situations. You’d need to look elsewhere for that answer.\n\nTaiwanese Culture & Pop Culture\n\nLet’s brighten the mood a bit with some facts about Taiwanese culture:\n\nMore than 15,000 Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, and Chinese folk temples spread throughout Taiwan’s cities and countryside.\n\n22.3–2.4% of Taiwan’s population are indigenous peoples, while the Han ethnic group makes up 95% and new immigrants make up 2.6% [5].\n\nWhen I mention Han Chinese, I also refer to subgroups like the Hakka people (in this scenario).\n\nIt’s common in Taiwan for younger people to refer to elders as “aunts” or “uncles.”\n\n阿姨 (āyí) means a mother’s sister, and 叔叔 (shúshu) refers to a father’s younger brother. It’s a sign of respect and friendship.\n\nTaiwan has more than 300 night markets.\n\nGift-giving is common for both personal and business occasions. For instance, you SHOULD NOT gift watches or shoes.\n\nWhile controversial for health reasons, betel nut chewing is a widespread habit.\n\n“Kawaii” culture from Japan influences Taiwan. Expect mascots for everything, an abundance of cute characters and products, and a tendency to adopt a high-pitched, cutesy voice.\n\nTaiwan is a major hub for Mandopop (Mandarin Chinese pop music), producing popular singers and bands throughout Asia, such as Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai.\n\nKTV parlors generate 37% of Taiwan’s entertainment tax revenue (2021).\n\nHere are some interesting points that deserve dedicated sections.\n\n1. Betel Nut Beauties\n\nAround the 1980s, betel nut shop owners employed women and had them wear skimpy outfits. These women would then stand outside the shop and entice passing drivers to buy betel nuts.\n\nOr you would have seen these women sitting inside glass boxes taking apart betel nuts.\n\nMany girls found this gig an excellent way to get money due to dropping out of school or not having the best education. However, many Taiwanese people looked down upon many in these positions.\n\nThe business itself wasn’t ripe with prostitution. It may have happened in a few instances. But it’s not common. Nor are they places primarily run by gangsters.\n\nIn 2002 local governments began enforcing dress codes. Laws then erased betel nut beauty advertising. As it prevented girls from wearing outfits that were “too revealing.”\n\nHere’s an interesting TEDTalk that covers betel nut girls in-depth:\n\nI haven’t seen any betel nut girls throughout my time here.\n\n2. Taiwan’s Funeral Pole Dancers\n\nSince the 1980s, many Taiwanese families have hired pole dancers to perform at funerals, celebrating the lives of the deceased and attracting mourners.\n\nYou’d see them on stages or dancing on poles built into jeeps.\n\nI once drove by one of these funerals. But it only happened for a second. I didn’t see much.\n\nThese funerals aren’t as common nowadays. But I don’t think they’re banned.\n\nIn 2017, 50 pole dancers brightened the gloomy mood of a Chiayi politician’s life [6].\n\n3. Strange Taboos During Ghost Month\n\nSome of Taiwan’s most popular ghost month taboos include:\n\nTaiwanese also refer to ghosts as Good Sisters (好姐妹) or Good Brothers (好兄弟).\n\nGhost month occurs throughout August when all the spirits enter our realm. Once September arrives, those spirits return “home.”\n\nThese superstitions are only for Ghost Month. The Taiwanese have plenty more interesting superstitions that I cover in a separate guide.\n\nTechnology\n\nCheck out these technology statistics and facts:\n\nTaiwan accounts for 18% of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity.\n\nThey produce 60% of the world’s semiconductors.\n\nAnd 90% of the planet’s most advanced conductors.\n\nTSMC has a 61% market share of the global semiconductor foundry market (2024).\n\nSamsung has an 11.3% market share.\n\nTSMC employees account for 1.8% of Taiwan’s newborns (2024).\n\nTaiwan’s TSMC has the 10th highest market cap out of all businesses globally [7].\n\nAt the time of writing.\n\n18.98% 5G usage rate (2022) [8].\n\n65.32% broadband penetration rate.\n\n81.47% mobile penetration rate.\n\n84.3% internet access rate.\n\n34.27% mobile payment usage rate.\n\n2.01% cryptocurrency holding rate.\n\n23.56% e-book usage rate.\n\n35.76% online game usage rate.\n\n51.61% of social media users are on Facebook.\n\nTaiwan is home to more than 211 gaming companies (including MSI).\n\nHow do these numbers affect Taiwan’s economy? Let’s see.\n\nEconomy\n\nHere are an overwhelming number of economic facts and statistics for Taiwan:\n\nExperts expect Taiwan’s food and beverage market to rise at a CAGR of 3.7% between the years 2022 and 2027.\n\nConvenience stores are Taiwan’s largest grocery channel, with a market size of USD 9.8 billion.\n\n7-Eleven has a 59.7% market share (in 2022).\n\nFamily Mart has the second-highest share at 29.8%.\n\nCarrefour has the highest hypermarket market share at 20.6%.\n\nPX Mart has the highest supermarket share at 62.4%.\n\nCostco Taiwan has a sales CAGR of 9.6% between 2022 and 2027.\n\nShopee has the highest e-commerce market share in Taiwan at 35.9%.\n\nMomo shop has the second-highest at 14.4%.\n\nThe average Taiwanese person in 2022 has USD 17,659 in disposable income per capita.\n\nThis number is expected to grow to $27,237 in 2032.\n\nTaiwan’s unemployment rate is 3.38%.

Bubble Tea Wars\n\nIn 1986, Taiwanese entrepreneur Tu Tsong experimented with mixing fen yuan (粉圓) with green tea. From there, he added large black tapioca balls in milk tea. Tu opened Hanlin the same year [12 HTTP link & Chinese-only text].\n\n2 years later, Chun Shui Tang opened in Taichung. They also claimed the status of “the inventor of bubble tea.”\n\nA 10-year court battle ensued. Eventually, Tu said something like, “it doesn’t matter who created it. [13 Chinese-only text]”\n\nFun Facts\n\nThese facts didn’t fit into any of the other categories:\n\nTaipei 101 was the world’s tallest building from October 2004 until 2007 [14]. When the Burj Khalifa took its place.\n\n24% of Taiwanese homes are single-person households.\n\n12.6% of households have 5+ people.\n\nNew Taipei City is Taiwan’s largest city, with more than 4.5 million people.\n\n“4” is unlucky (it sounds like ‘death’), while “8” is prosperous (it sounds similar to ‘fortune’).\n\n6/10 people in Taiwan own scooters (otherwise known as motorbikes).\n\nThere are 365 cars per 1,000 people in Taiwan.\n\nHas a 55% recycling rate.\n\nThey recycle 73% of their plastic.\n\nThe country burns the rest of its waste.\n\nHas 9 national parks.\n\nTaiwan is the 4th safest country in the world in 2024 (so far) behind Andorra, UAE, and Qatar.\n\nHas a score of 85/100 Equality Index score in legal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nHas a forest coverage rate of around 60.71%.\n\nHere’s a cool tidbit that deserves a separate section.\n\nTaiwan Garbage Trucks Play Music\n\nAs Taiwanese garbage trucks approach pickup spots, they’ll play one of these songs:\n\n1. Für Elise by Beethoven\n\n2. The Maiden’s Prayer by Bądarzewska-Baranowska\n\nA recycle truck will follow the trash trucks on most routes. I’ve heard 1 recycling truck play music, but I can’t find the song’s name. And since I don’t live by that route anymore, I can’t record a video of that specific truck.\n\nMost recycling trucks won’t play music, though.\n\nAnimal Facts\n\nAnd finally, here are some facts about Taiwanese animals:\n\nHas over 400 species of butterflies.\n\nAround 674 species of birds in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan is home to the endemic Formosan black bear.\n\nAround 60 species of snakes, 16 of which are poisonous, 6 of them are lethal.\n\nThe Formosan sika deer, once near extinction, has made a comeback thanks to conservation efforts.\n\nThe Mikado pheasant, striking black and white plumage, is a highly protected endemic and unofficial national bird.\n\nThe Taiwan blue magpie is supposedly the national bird, though apparently, the vote wasn’t formally accepted.\n\nMore than 2,831 fish species.\n\nThose are all the facts that I have for now.\n\nLet me know if you have any statistics or interesting (non-political) facts about Taiwan that I should know about."
