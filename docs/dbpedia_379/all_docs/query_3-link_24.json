        "text": "Part I: U.S. Policy on \"One China\"\n\nHistorical Background\n\nTaiwan formally calls itself the Republic of China (ROC), tracing its political lineage to the ROC set up in 1912 after the revolution that started on October 10, 1911, in China to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. The ROC uses October 10 to commemorate the national day, celebrated as \"Double Ten.\" The ROC does not recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) founded in Beijing by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1949. The PRC claims that the ROC ceased to exist in 1949 and that Taiwan is a province of \"one China.\" (The Qing Empire had incorporated Taiwan as a full province in 1885-1895, when more settlers moved from China to the island.) The PRC and ROC do not recognize each other or two Chinas. The ROC refers to the other side of the strait as the \"mainland.\" The PRC opposes recognition of the ROC and seeks unification of Taiwan with the mainland as a part of \"one China,\" without renouncing the use of force. In any case, since 1949, the ROC has governed only on Taiwan, and the PRC has ruled mainland China.\n\nPreviously called Formosa, Taiwan never has been ruled by the CPC or as a part of the PRC, and until 1945, had never been ruled by the ROC. In Taiwan after World War II, October 25, 1945, or \"Retrocession Day,\" marked the ROC's claim of \"recovering\" Formosa from Japan. However, upon Japan's surrender, that was the first time that the ROC's military forces had occupied the island of Formosa. When the Qing Empire ceded in perpetuity Formosa to Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895, the ROC was not yet in existence. Moreover, the colony's people did not have a say in self-determination of their status or identity. The Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist Party of China, has contended that the ROC claimed Formosa at Japan's surrender in August 1945, with no country challenging the island's status. The ROC under KMT forces led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taipei in 1949, when the Communist forces led by Mao Zedong took over mainland China. Taiwan's people have faced social, ethnic, linguistic, and political issues of whether to identify with Taiwan or China, with two major groups of local \"Taiwanese\" and \"Mainlanders\" (people who retreated to Taiwan with the KMT forces and their descendants).\n\nOne of the first major powers to support reforms and the new republic of progressive leaders in early 20th century China, the United States recognized the ROC from 1913 until the end of 1978.1 The United States then shifted to recognize the PRC, with its capital in Beijing, under the U.S. \"one China\" policy. By the early 1970s, the United States had looked to switch the diplomatic recognition to the PRC, while figuring out a framework to sustain engagement with Taiwan. Since 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), P.L. 96-8, has governed policy toward Taiwan.\n\nPaying particular attention to congressional influence on policy, Part I of this CRS Report discusses the U.S. \"one China\" policy concerning Taiwan since the United States (under President Nixon) began in 1971 to reach understandings with the People's Republic of China (PRC) government in Beijing, which has insisted on its \"one China\" principle. Part II comprehensively reviews the evolution of policies as affected by legislation and articulated in key statements by Washington, Beijing, and Taipei. On an overview of U.S. policy on Taiwan, see CRS Report R41952, U.S.-Taiwan Relationship: Overview of Policy Issues. On U.S. security assistance to Taiwan, see CRS Report RL30957, Taiwan: Major U.S. Arms Sales Since 1990.\n\nCongressional Concerns\n\nTies or tension across the Taiwan Strait affect international security (with potential U.S. military intervention), U.S.-Taiwan engagement, and U.S.-PRC contacts. In the 1990s, some Members in Congress pushed for changes in policy toward Taiwan. Questions about the \"one China\" policy arose again after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui characterized cross-strait relations as \"special state-to-state ties\" on July 9, 1999. Beijing responded vehemently with calls for Lee to retract the perceived deviation from the \"one China\" position and reiterated long-standing threats to use force if necessary to prevent a declaration of independence by Taiwan. The PRC also opposed U.S. military intervention. The Clinton Administration responded that Lee's statement was not helpful and reaffirmed the \"one China\" policy.2 Some questioned whether the TRA requires U.S. defense of Taiwan against an attack from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's military.\n\nSenator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, at a July 21, 1999, hearing, said that Lee \"created an opportunity to break free from the anachronistic, Beijing-inspired one-China policy which has imprisoned U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan for years.\" Representative Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the International Relations Committee, wrote in a September 7, 1999, letter to Clinton that it is a \"common misperception\" that we conceded officially that Beijing is the capital of the \"one China\" that includes Taiwan. He wrote, \"under no circumstances should the United States move toward Beijing's version of 'one China.'\"3\n\nSince 2001, some congressional leaders have stressed continuity in maintaining the \"one China\" policy. During the George W. Bush Administration, leaders of the House and Senate stressed support for Taiwan as a democracy, rather than its independent status. Moreover, Members voiced concerns about cross-strait tension arising from actions taken by both Beijing and Taipei.\n\nSenator Richard Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in May 2001 that \"for many years, successive U.S. administrations have affirmed that there is one China and that the people on Taiwan and the people of China should work out a plan for peaceful unification.\" He also referred to a debate on the nature of the U.S. obligation to \"defend democracy in Taiwan\" and to prevent a \"forceful military unification of Taiwan and China.\"4 Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the International Relations Committee, spoke in Beijing in December 2002 and dismissed notions that U.S. support for Taiwan was geared toward containing or dividing China. He said that \"the bedrock of the very strong support for Taiwan in the U.S. Congress\" is the shared experience as democracies. Moreover, Hyde highlighted Taiwan's significance as a model of a \"Chinese democracy\" that proved democracy is compatible with Chinese culture.5\n\nU.S. views were shaped by developments in Taiwan and concern about cross-strait tension. On August 3, 2002, President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gave a speech using the phrase \"one country on each side\" of the strait, surprising Washington even before the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Leading up to the presidential election on March 20, 2004, Chen advocated holding the first referendums (on the same day as the election) and drafting a new constitution with a timetable. Though symbolic steps, Beijing reacted with alarm and warnings.\n\nOn the eve of his visit to Washington, PRC Premier Wen Jiabao warned on November 22, 2003, that China would \"pay any price to safeguard the unity of the motherland.\"6 On November 29, President Chen surprisingly announced that he would use one provision in the referendum law passed by the opposition-dominated legislature two days earlier and hold a referendum on China's threats on the day of the presidential election. During his meeting with Premier Wen in the Oval Office on December 9, 2003, President Bush stated that he opposed Chen's efforts to change the status quo, drawing criticisms that Bush sided with Beijing's belligerence. The Taiwan Caucus in the House wrote a letter to President Bush, criticizing his stance as a victory for the authoritarian regime of the PRC at the expense of Taiwan's democratic reforms.7\n\nOn the TRA's 25th anniversary, the House International Relations Committee held a hearing on April 21, 2004. After congratulating President Chen Shui-bian on his re-election in March 2004, the Administration further clarified U.S. policy toward Taiwan and warned of \"limitations\" in U.S. support for constitutional changes in Taiwan. At that hearing on the TRA, Representative James Leach, chairman of the House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, stated that Taiwan has the unique situation in which it can have de facto self-determination only if it does not attempt to be recognized with de jure sovereignty. He urged Taiwan's people to recognize that they have greater security in \"political ambiguity.\" He called for continuity, saying that \"together with our historic 'one China' policy,\" the TRA has contributed to ensuring peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.8 In his second inaugural address on May 20, Chen responded to U.S. concerns, excluding sovereignty issues and a referendum from his plan for a new constitution by 2008. Leach represented the United States at Chen's inauguration. At a subcommittee hearing on June 2, 2004, Leach praised Chen's address as \"thoughtful, statesmanlike, and helpful\" as well as \"constructive\" for dialogue with Beijing.9 Later, to mark the 25th anniversary of the TRA on April 10, 2004, the House voted on July 15, 2004, to pass H.Con.Res. 462 (Hyde) to reaffirm \"unwavering commitment\" to the TRA.10\n\nSome in Congress also had concerns about challenges to U.S. interests in reducing tensions and fostering dialogue across the strait. In March 2005, China adopted an \"Anti-Secession Law.\" On March 16, the House passed (424-4) H.Con.Res. 98 (Hyde) to express grave concern about the \"Anti-Secession Law,\" and the House Taiwan Caucus heard a briefing by Taipei's Representative. On April 6, 2005, the House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific held a hearing on China's \"Anti-Secession Law.\" President Chen announced on February 27, 2006, that he will \"terminate\" the National Unification Council and Guidelines. Senator John Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told Admiral William Fallon, Commander of the Pacific Command, at a committee hearing on March 7, 2006, that \"if conflict were precipitated by just inappropriate and wrongful politics generated by the Taiwanese elected officials, I'm not entirely sure that this nation would come full force to their rescue if they created that problem.\"11 In July 2007, Representative Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that it was impractical for Taiwan to seek membership in the U.N.\n\nA convergence emerged rhetorically among the PRC, Taiwan, and the United States on cross-strait \"peaceful development\" after Ma Ying-jeou became president in Taiwan in May 2008 and cross-strait tension reduced (partly due to a resumption of dialogue). As Taiwan and the PRC became closer, U.S.-Taiwan engagement strengthened. Congressional concerns included issues about whether and how the United States and Taiwan might strengthen political, defense, and economic cooperation, partly to sustain U.S. interests in security, democracy, and prosperity in Taiwan and its international space. On March 24, 2009, the House passed (by voice vote) H.Con.Res. 55 (Berkley), and 30 Senators sent a letter to President Barack Obama to mark the TRA's 30th anniversary. On June 16 and October 4, 2011, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, held hearings on \"Why Taiwan Matters.\" At the latter hearing with an official panel, Ros-Lehtinen stressed adherence to President Reagan's Six Assurances to Taipei. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campell used his testimony for a rare reaffirmation of the Six Assurances, reiterating in particular the assurance of not having any prior consultation with the PRC on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The Administration and Congress supported Taiwan's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).\n\nCongress passed legislation in support of Taiwan's participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, Representative Ed Royce and Senator Robert Menendez, introduced bills to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan at ICAO. Signed by President Obama, H.R. 1151 (Royce) became P.L. 113-17 on July 12, 2013.\n\nAmong other legislation for consideration, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced, on September 14, 2011, the Taiwan Policy Act (H.R. 2918) to enhance ties with Taiwan in comprehensive ways. On August 1, 2013, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the Taiwan Policy Act of 2013, H.R. 419 (Ros-Lehtinen).\n\nOn March 14, 2014, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing to mark the 35th anniversary of the enactment of the TRA. On April 3, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs held a hearing on the TRA. In response to Senator Marco Rubio, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel did not clearly reaffirm the Six Assurances. After the hearing, Russel clarified to reporters that the Administration remained committed to the Six Assurances as well as the TRA and three Joint Communiques.12 On April 7, the House agreed (by voice vote) to pass H.R. 3470, which combines H.Res. 494 (to affirm the TRA) and the Naval Vessel Transfer and Arms Export Control Amendments Act (to authorize the transfer by sale of up to four excess U.S. Navy Perry-class frigates to Taiwan, among other stipulations). On April 9, 52 Senators, led by Senators Menendez and James Inhofe, sent a letter to President Obama to mark the TRA.\n\nBroad policy issues include whether to review U.S. policy in view of significant changes since the last Taiwan Policy Review in 1994. Some observers have said that the improved cross-strait engagement and reduction of tension since 2008 help U.S. attention to shift to expanding cooperation with a rising China. Others have argued that the self-imposed restrictions on the relationship with Taiwan go beyond the TRA (which did not stipulate \"unofficial\" ties), the reality of official contacts, or the U.S.-PRC joint communiques. They also have concerns that the restrictions undermine critical communication with and denigrate Taiwan, undermining U.S. leverage and interests. An overall issue is whether to pursue further normalization of the relationship and expand engagement with Taiwan, including in the defense, diplomatic, and economic domains. Congress could examine the State Department's restrictions on contacts between Executive Branch officials and Taiwan's officials in the \"Guidelines on Relations with Taiwan\" to carry out an \"unofficial\" relationship. A related issue has been whether to resume and continue visits by Cabinet-rank officials to Taiwan.\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of the Taiwan Policy Review of 1994, Representative Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led a total of 29 Members to send a letter, on September 23, 2014, to Secretary of State John Kerry, calling for expanding engagement with Taiwan. The Members stated that \"in view of the fact that there is now a fully free and democratic Taiwan, we feel strongly that there is a need today to undertake a new and thorough Taiwan Policy Review, laying the basis for further expanding relations with Taiwan and thereby enhancing continued peace and stability in the region.\" The State Department, on October 14, acknowledged that, under the TRA, the United States maintains commercial, cultural, and other ties with Taiwan's people, dropping an insistence of the State Department that the bilateral cooperation is \"unofficial.\" The Department's letter cited the \"one China\" policy as based on the three U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques and the TRA but did not cite the Six Assurances. The State Department acknowledged that it continually reviews and improves the interactions with Taiwan but did not refer to specific ways of improving cooperation.13\n\nThe Obama Administration's strategic \"rebalancing\" of comprehensive diplomatic, defense, and economic priorities to the Asia-Pacific raised issues about Taiwan's roles and whether the strategy considers Taiwan's security role narrowly in the Taiwan Strait or more broadly in the region. At a hearing in October 2011, Assistant Secretary of State Campbell testified that the United States sought a \"rebalancing\" of comprehensive priorities to focus more on the Asia-Pacific region. He stated that \"a critical part of that overarching strategy is building a comprehensive, durable, and unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan.\" Campbell stressed that \"the bedrock of that relationship is our security relationship.\" After not mentioning Taiwan in an article in Foreign Policy on \"America's Pacific Century\" in October 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the same subject the next month in Honolulu and added that the United States has a strong relationship with Taiwan as an \"important security and economic partner.\" At a conference of defense ministers in Singapore in June 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta discussed the strategic refocus to Asia and mentioned Taiwan by saying that the United States strongly supports the efforts of both the PRC and Taiwan to improve the cross-strait relationship. He added that \"we have an enduring interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\" Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Jose Fernandez visited Taipei in August, and he spoke about economic exchanges with Taiwan in the context of the rebalancing toward Asia.14\n\nIn sum, Congress has exercised important roles in legislating and overseeing the TRA of 1979, as Congress and the President have recalibrated the U.S. \"one China\" policy over the decades. Since the early 1990s, U.S. interests in the military balance as well as Taiwan's security and democracy have faced continued challenges due to the PRC's military modernization, moves perceived by Beijing as promoting de jure independence under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s president (2000-2008), and resistance in Taiwan by the Kuomintang (KMT) party to raising defense spending and strengthening self-defense. Moreover, since 2000, political polarization in Taiwan has raised the importance of U.S. policy toward Taiwan for fostering U.S. interests there. These interests include sustainable stability, U.S.-PRC engagement, Taiwan's democracy, peace, and prosperity (with a global impact), and economic ties with a major trading partnerâultimately a \"peaceful resolution\" of the dispute over Taiwan. At the same time, the dominance of partisan politics in Taiwan has reduced U.S. leverage to advance some U.S. priorities. The United States also has monitored how the KMT and DPP in Taipei have handled disputes with the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Beijing over Taiwan's status, \"one China,\" and cross-strait ties.\n\nKey Statements and Ambiguity\n\nFive key documents stand out among U.S. policy statements on Taiwan. Among these, since 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) has had bipartisan support in guiding policy with a firm foundation and flexible framework for the maintenance of the relationship with Taiwan.\n\nShanghai Communique of 1972\n\nNormalization Communique of 1979\n\nTaiwan Relations Act (TRA) (P.L. 96-8) of 1979\n\nSix Assurances to Taipei of 1982\n\nAugust 17 Communique (on arms sales) of 1982.\n\n(See excerpts of these and other statements in Part II of this CRS report.)\n\nDespite apparently consistent formal statements and closed-door assurances since the end of World War II (and the end of Taiwan's status as a colony of Japan that began in 1895), the \"one China\" question has been left somewhat ambiguous and subject to different interpretations among Washington, Beijing, and Taipei. The concept of \"one China\" has been complicated by the co-existence of the PRC on the mainland and the ROC on Taiwan since 1949, while they have not recognized each other. Taiwan was never ruled by the CPC or as part of the PRC.\n\nChanging Context\n\nMoreover, the political and strategic context of those key statements has experienced significant changes. After political liberalization began in 1986, Taiwan became a democracy, with a new basis for the government's legitimacy and greater say by voters about Taiwan's status. The PRC's Tiananmen Crackdown of 1989 dramatically proved the limits to liberal change on the mainland. The original strategic rationale for U.S.-PRC rapprochement faded with the end of the Cold War. In May 2000, the DPP's Chen Shui-bian became President of the ROC, ousting the KMT as the ruling party in Taiwan for the first time in 55 years. Under the DPP, the government in Taipei made greater use of the name \"Taiwan\" (vs. \"ROC\").15 The KMT reemphasized \"ROC\" in 2008 and pursued closer ties with \"mainland China.\" The two sides held the first formal meeting since 1949 between officials in charge of cross-strait affairs on February 11, 2014. Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Wang Yu-chi met with Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Director Zhang Zhijun in Nanjing, the ROC's capital before KMT forces retreated to Taiwan.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThere are complications about the language in the key statements. First, \"China\" was not defined in the three joint communiques. In the Normalization Communique, the United States recognized the PRC government as the sole legal government of China, but the PRC has never ruled Taiwan and other islands under the control of the ROC government. The PRC's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's 1984 proposal of \"one China, two systems\" sought to define Taiwan as a Special Administrative Region under the PRC after unification. On the other hand, \"Taiwan\" was defined in Section 15(2) of the TRA essentially to be the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores, plus the people, entities, and governing authorities there.\n\nUnsettled Status\n\nSecond, there has been disagreement as to whether Taiwan's status actually was resolved or determined. In secret talks in 1972, President Nixon assured PRC Premier Zhou Enlai that the United States viewed the status of Taiwan as \"determined\" to be part of one China. The PRC's December 1978 statement on normalization of diplomatic relations with the United States said that the Taiwan question \"has now been resolved between the two countries.\" However, the U.S. statement of December 1978 on normalization stated the expectation that the Taiwan question \"will be settled\" peacefully by the Chinese themselves. The TRA of 1979 also stipulated the U.S. expectation that the future of Taiwan \"will be determined\" by peaceful means. A Representative who managed the legislation for the TRA as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, Lester Wolff, wrote that \"in no sense of the word, through the TRA and/or other relevant documents including the Shanghai Communique, has Congress of the United States ever attempted, except to support self-determination for the people of Taiwan, to determine the final destiny of Taiwan.\"16\n\nPresident Reagan's 1982 statement on arms sales to Taiwan declared that \"the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people, on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, to resolve.\" Under U.S. policy, \"settlement\" or \"resolution\"ânot stated as \"unification\" or \"reunification\"âof the Taiwan question is left open to be determined peacefully and with a shift to stress a resolution by both sides of the strait (rather than involving the United Nations (U.N.) or another country). In a rare public statement on this U.S. stance, in August 2007, a National Security Council official said that \"the position of the United States Government is that the ROCâRepublic of Chinaâis an issue undecided ... for many, many years.\"17\n\nPeaceful Settlement\n\nThird, the questions of the PRC's possible use of force, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and possible U.S. help in Taiwan's self-defense were left contentious and critical for U.S. interests. Washington consistently has stated its strong interest that there be a peaceful settlement, but the PRC has not renounced its claimed sovereign right to use force if necessary. Washington has not promised to end arms sales to Taiwan, although the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 was terminated on December 31, 1979.18 In the surprise announcements of December 1978 on diplomatic recognition, the United States stated its interest in a peaceful resolution, but the PRC countered that Taiwan is China's internal affair. President Reagan agreed to the 1982 Communique on reducing U.S. arms sales to Taiwanâpremised on the PRC's declared policy of peaceful unification. In the early 1990s, the PLA began to build up its theater missile force and to acquire modern arms, especially from Moscow.\n\nThe 1979 TRA states that the United States will provide necessary defense articles and services to Taiwan for its sufficient self-defense, and will consider with \"grave concern\" any non-peaceful means to determine Taiwan's future. In deciding on that language in 1979, Members of Congress debated whether the wording on U.S. military intentions was clear or ambiguous. Since the mid-1990s, a new debate has arisen over how to deter conflict in the Taiwan Strait, including whether ambiguity or clarity in U.S. statements about a possible military role serves U.S. interests in preventing conflict or provocations from either Beijing or Taipei.19 There have been issues about whether and how U.S. statements of intentions might be clarified to specify the conditions under which the U.S. military might help to defend Taiwan and the U.S. stance on Taiwan's sovereignty or efforts to change its declared political status.20 Questions also have persisted about the extent of the U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan, given President Clinton's 1996 deployment of two aircraft carriers near Taiwan, President Bush's initial statement in 2001 of doing \"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself,\" and Taiwan's budgetary limitations in self-defense capabilities.\n\nHas U.S. Policy Changed?\n\nApart from questions about the language in the key statements on \"one China,\" policy questions have arisen about whether successive Administrations have changed the U.S. position since 1971 to adapt to changing circumstances and whether such shifts have advanced U.S. interests.21 Successive Administrations have generally maintained that \"long-standing\" U.S. policy has been consistent. Some in Congress and others, however, have contended that U.S. policy has changed in some important areas. There also are issues as to whether any elements of the \"one China\" policy should be reviewed for modification. The \"one China\" policy has evolved to cover three issue areas: sovereignty, use of force, and cross-strait dialogue.\n\nIssue Area 1: Sovereignty\n\nOne issue area for U.S. policy concerns sovereignty, including Taiwan's juridical status, future unification vs. independence, referendums, a new constitution, and international participation. The U.S. \"one China\" policy has differed from the PRC's principle on \"one China,\" and there have been questions about whether U.S. policy is one of support, non-support, or opposition to unification or independence. In short, U.S. policy has stressed the process (peaceful resolution, cross-strait dialogue, with the assent of Taiwan's people, and no provocations or unilateral changes by either side) rather than the outcome (e.g., unification, independence, confederation). At the same time, the ROC, or Taiwan, has continued to assert its sovereignty, seeking membership or observership in the United Nations or other international organizations.\n\nEven while recognizing the ROC government and its \"jurisdiction\" over Taiwan, on the eve of the Nixon Administration's contacts with PRC leaders in Beijing, the State Department testified to Congress in 1969 and 1970 that the juridical matter of the status of Taiwan remained undetermined. The State Department also wrote that\n\nIn neither [the Japanese Peace Treaty of 1951 nor the Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan of 1952] did Japan cede this area [of Formosa and the Pescadores] to any particular entity. As Taiwan and the Pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition, sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution. Both the Republic of China and the Chinese Communists disagree with this conclusion and consider that Taiwan and the Pescadores are part of the sovereign state of China. The United States recognizes the Government of the Republic of China as legitimately occupying and exercising jurisdiction over Taiwan and the Pescadores.22\n\nHowever, accounts of President Nixon's secret talks with PRC Premier Zhou Enlai in China in 1972 reported that Nixon made promises on the question of Taiwan in return for diplomatic normalization that went beyond the communique issued at the end. The Carter Administration later called the promises: \"Nixon's Five Points.\"23 Also, according to Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth's March 1999 testimony, Nixon pledged no U.S. support for Taiwan independence (second time after Kissinger's 1971 promise): \"We have not and will not support any Taiwan independence movement.\"24 With the release on December 11, 2003, of declassified memoranda of conversation of the secret talks between Nixon and Zhou, there was confirmation that Nixon stated as first of Five Principles that \"there is one China, and Taiwan is a part of China. There will be no more statements madeâif I can control our bureaucracyâto the effect that the status of Taiwan is undetermined.\"\n\nThe United States did not explicitly state its own position on the status of Taiwan in the three U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques. In 1972, while still recognizing the ROC, the Nixon Administration declared that it \"acknowledges\" that \"all Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait\" maintain that there is one China and Taiwan is a part of China, and that the United States did not challenge that position. After shifting diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the United States, in 1979 and 1982, again \"acknowledged the Chinese position\"25 of one China and Taiwan is part of China. However, the 1982 communique further stated that the United States has no intention of pursuing a policy of \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan,\" while President Reagan's accompanying statement said that \"the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people, on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, to resolve.\" The TRA did not discuss the \"one China\" concept. In 1994, the Clinton Administration stated after its Taiwan Policy Review that the United States had \"acknowledged\" the Chinese position on one China and that \"since 1978, each Administration has reaffirmed this policy.\"\n\nDespite these apparent similarities in U.S. policy statements, some contend that the U.S. position, since originally formulated in 1972, has adopted the PRC's \"one China\" principleârather than steadily maintaining neutrality and equal distance from Beijing and Taipei. In 1982, Senator John Glenn criticized both the Carter and Reagan Administrations:\n\nThe ambiguous formulation agreed upon in the 1979 joint communique went considerably further in recognizing the PRC's claim to Taiwan. Although the word \"acknowledged\" remained, the object of our acknowledgment shifted noticeably. We no longer just acknowledged that both Chinas asserted the principle that there was one China, but instead acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China. By dropping the key phrase \"all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain\" one could interpret that we had moved from the position of neutral bystander noting the existence of a dispute, to a party accepting the Chinese assertion that there is one China. Clearly, this was the PRC's interpretation.... More recently, Peking's threats to downgrade relations with the United States, unless Washington agreed to end all arms sales to Taiwan, prompted President Reagan to write to China's Communist Party Chairman, Hu Yaobang, in May 1982, and assure him that, \"Our policy will continue to be based on the principle that there is but one China.... \" We now assert that it is our policy, U.S. policy, that there is but one China, and although not stated, indicate implicitly that Taiwan is a part of that one China. The use of the qualifier \"acknowledged\" has been dropped altogether.... I do not believe that anyone can dispute that the U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. Let me reiterate one more time, in 1972, we acknowledged that the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait maintained that there was but one China. Today it is U.S. policy that there is but one China. Despite this remarkable shift over time, the State Department, at each juncture, has assured us that our policy remained essentially unchanged.26\n\nPresident Clinton's \"Three Noes\"\n\nIn August 1995 (earlier than the first public statements showed in 1997), President Clinton sent a secret letter to PRC President Jiang Zemin to state that the United States: (1) would \"oppose\" Taiwan independence; (2) would not support \"two Chinas\" or one China and one Taiwan; and (3) would not support Taiwan's admission to the U.N.27 The opposition to Taiwan independence seemed to go beyond the promises made by former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and President Nixon in 1971 and 1972 of no U.S. support for Taiwan independence. Later, that wording was apparently changed from opposition to a neutral stance of non-support. This letter reportedly formed the basis of what were later known publicly as the \"Three Noes.\"\n\nAt the 1997 Clinton-Jiang summit in Washington, the two leaders issued a joint statement which included a U.S. position: \"the United States reiterates that it adheres to its 'one China' policy and the principles set forth in the three U.S.-China joint communiques.\" While that joint statement did not include the \"Three Noes,\" the Administration designated the State Department's spokesperson to say two days later that \"we certainly made clear that we have a one-China policy; that we don't support a one-China, one-Taiwan policy. We don't support a two-China policy. We don't support Taiwan independence, and we don't support Taiwanese membership in organizations that require you to be a member state.\" While in China for a summit in June 1998, President Clinton chose an informal forum to declare: \"I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy, which is that we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement.\"\n\nSome questioned whether the \"Three Noes,\" especially as it was publicly declared by the U.S. President while in the PRC, was a change in U.S. policy.28 U.S. non-support for a one China, one Taiwan; or two Chinas can be traced to the private assurances of the Nixon Administration in the early 1970s. However, the Clinton Administration, beginning with its Taiwan Policy Review of 1994, added non-support for Taipei's re-entry into the U.N., which became an issue after Taipei launched its bid in 1993. In response to President Clinton's \"Three Noes,\" concerned Members in both the Senate and the House nearly unanimously passed resolutions in July 1998, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Taiwan.\n\nThe Clinton Administration, nonetheless, argued that the \"Three Noes\" did not represent a change in policy. Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 25, 1999, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth stated that \"every point made there [in the \"Three Noes\"] had been made before by a previous Administration and there was no change whatsoever.\" In a written response to a question from Senator Helms, Roth cited as precedents for the \"Three Noes\" a 1971 statement by Kissinger, a 1972 statement by Nixon, a 1979 statement by Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and President Reagan's 1982 Communique.\n\nPresident Bush on Taiwan's Independence, Referendums, Constitution\n\nOn April 25, 2001, when President George W. Bush stated the U.S. commitment to Taiwan as an obligation to use \"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself,\" he also said that \"a declaration of independence is not the one China policy, and we will work with Taiwan to make sure that that doesn't happen.\" Visiting Beijing in February 2002, Bush said that U.S. policy on Taiwan was unchanged, but he emphasized U.S. commitment to the TRA and a peaceful resolution, along with opposition to provocations by either Beijing or Taipei. After Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian said on August 3, 2002, that there is \"one country on each side\" of the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. National Security Council (NSC) stated, in a second response, that \"we do not support Taiwan independence.\" With Jiang Zemin at his side at a summit in Crawford, TX, in October 2002, President Bush himself stated that \"we do not support independence.\"\n\nHowever, there have been questions about whether the Bush Administration adjusted U.S. policy after President Chen Shui-bian surprised the United States in August 2002 with a speech on \"one country on each side\" and a call for a holding referendums. Specifically, there was the issue of whether President Bush gave assurances, at closed meetings starting at that summit in October 2002, to PRC President Jiang Zemin and later President Hu Jintao that the United States was \"against\" or \"opposed\" (vs. non-support of) unilateral moves in Taiwan toward independence and/or the status of Taiwan independence, in the interest of stability in the Taiwan Strait.29 A position in \"opposition\" to Taiwan independence would represent a shift in policy focus from the process to the outcome and go beyond President Nixon's \"Five Principles,\" which expressed the neutral stance of \"non-support\" for Taiwan independence. But U.S. opposition to Taiwan independence would be consistent with President Clinton's secret letter reportedly sent in 1995 to PRC leader Jiang Zemin, as the basis for the \"Three Noes.\" U.S. opposition would also conflict with the stance of the government of Taiwan, which, under the DPP, argued that Taiwan is already independent, as evident since the first democratic presidential election in 1996.30\n\nAfter Chen, during campaigns for Taiwan's presidential election in March 2004, advocated holding referendums and adopting a new constitution by 2008âmoves that could have implications for Taiwan's sovereignty and cross-strait stability, the Bush Administration called on Chen to adhere to his pledges (\"Five Noes\") in his inaugural address of 2000 (including not promoting a referendum to change the status quo). On September 28, 2003, Chen started his call for a new constitution for Taiwan (with a draft constitution by September 28, 2006; a referendum on the constitution on December 10, 2006; and enactment of the new constitution on May 20, 2008). National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on October 14, 2003, that \"nobody should try unilaterally to change the status quo.\"31 A White House official said in an interview on November 26, 2003, that \"Taiwan shouldn't be moving towards independence; and mainland China shouldn't be moving towards the use of force or coercion.\"32 Then, Chen announced on November 29âtwo days after the opposition-dominated legislature passed a restrictive law authorizing referendumsâthat he would still use one provision to hold a \"defensive referendum\" on election day.33 Chen argued that the referendum would be a way for Taiwan's people to express their opposition to the PLA's missile threat and would have nothing to do with the question of unification or independence.\n\nNonetheless, Administration officials had concerns about the volatile course of current and future political actions in Taiwan (with elections, referendums, and a new constitution), reforms geared for governance vs sovereignty, and unnecessary effects on stability, given U.S. commitments to help Taiwan's self-defense. The Administration added a new, clearer stance on December 1, 2003, when the State Department expressed U.S. \"opposition\" to any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move toward independence. On the same day, the Senior Director of Asian Affairs at the NSC, James Moriarty, reportedly was in Taiwan to pass a letter from Bush to Chen with concerns about \"provocations.\"34 Apparently needing a public, stronger, and clearer U.S. message to Taiwan, Bush appeared next to visiting PRC Premier Wen Jiabao at the White House on December 9, 2003, and stated an opposition to any unilateral decision by China or Taiwan to change the status quo, as well as opposition to efforts by Taiwan's President Chen to change the status quo, in response to a question about whether Chen should cancel the referendum.\n\nHowever, Bush did not make public remarks against the PRC's threats toward democratic Taiwan. Bush also did not counter Wen's remarks that Bush reiterated \"opposition\" to Taiwan independence. Bush raised questions about whether he miscalculated the willingness of Chen to back down during his re-election campaign and risked U.S. credibility, since Chen responded defiantly that he would hold the \"anti-missile, anti-war\" referendums as planned and that his intention was to keep Taiwan's current independent status quo from being changed.35\n\nAmerican opinions were divided on the Bush Administration's statements toward Taiwan. Some saw Chen as advancing a provocative agenda of permanent separation from China while trying to win votes, and supported Bush's forceful stance against Chen's plan for referendums.36 Others criticized President Bush for being one-sided in appeasing a dictatorship at the expense of Taiwan's democracy while failing to warn against and even possibly inviting aggression from Beijing.37 The co-chairmen of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus in the House wrote a letter to President Bush, criticizing his stance as a victory for the authoritarian regime of the PRC at the expense of Taiwan's democratic reforms.38 Some critics argued for a new approach, saying that the \"one China\" policy became \"irrelevant\" and that there were national security interests in preventing the \"unification\" of Taiwan with China.39 In contrast, another opinion advocated the continuation of arms sales to Taiwan with no position on its independence and staying out of any conflict in the Taiwan Strait.40\n\nStill, uncertainty remained about the Bush Administration's implementation of U.S. policy on questions such as options to recalibrate policy in exercising leverage over Taipei or Beijing; capacity to maintain the delicate balance in preventing provocations by either side of the strait rather than swerving to one side or another; perceptions in Taipei and Beijing of mixed messages from Washington; the U.S. stance on referendums and a new constitution in Taiwan; definition of \"status quo\"; deference to democracy in Taiwan; Taiwan's long-standing, de facto independence from China; stronger separate national identity in Taiwan; a proactive U.S. political role (such as urging dialogue, facilitating talks, or mediating negotiations) in addition to proactive pressures on defense; the extent of the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan's self-defense; the increasing PLA threat; and U.S. worries about Taiwan's defense spending, acquisitions, and the will to fight.41\n\nOn January 16, 2004, Chen gave the wording for the two questions, saying that the referendums will ask citizens (1) whether the government should acquire more missile defense systems if the Chinese Communists do not withdraw missiles and renounce the use of force against Taiwan, and (2) whether the government should negotiate with the Chinese Communists on a framework for cross-strait peace and stability. Chen also promised that if re-elected, he will maintain \"the status quo of cross-strait peace.\"42 On the election day of March 20, 2004, the two referendums failed to be considered valid when 45% of eligible voters cast ballots (less than the 50% needed).\n\nAfter the election in March 2004, the White House sent the Senior Director for Asian Affairs, Michael Green, to Taiwan to urge President Chen to exclude sovereignty-related issues from constitutional changes.43 In testimony by Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly on April 21, 2004, the Administration warned Chen of \"limitations\" in U.S. support for constitutional changes. In his inaugural address on May 20, 2004, Chen responded to a number of U.S. concerns.\n\nIn President Chen's second term, President Bush did not support Taiwan's independence or membership in the U.N. and opposed unilateral changes to the \"status quo.\" Leading up to Taiwan's presidential election on March 22, 2008, Bush Administration officials expressed opposition to referendums on Taiwan's membership in the U.N. that were held on the same day.\n\nVisits (or \"Transits\") by Taiwan's President\n\nOne issue has concerned the appropriate U.S. response to requests from Taiwan's president to enter the United States for visits or transits; to visit Washington, DC; to hold public events; and to meet with Executive Branch officials and Members of Congress. Congress has expressed strong support for granting such visits. Since 1994, the U.S. response has evolved from initially denying Lee Teng-hui entry into the United States to relaxing restrictions on \"transits\" for stops by Chen Shui-bian, and back to strict conditions for Chen's transits in May 2006.\n\nIn May 1994, the Clinton Administration allowed President Lee Teng-hui to make a refueling stop and rest in Hawaii but denied him a visa. In 1995, Lee received a visa to visit Cornell University, his alma mater. (Beijing responded with PLA exercises and missile launches in 1995 and 1996.) The Administration acknowledged that Congress's view was an important factor in the reversal.\n\nIn August 2000, the Clinton Administration allowed the newly-elected President Chen Shui-bian to transit in Los Angeles, but, according to Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, Washington and Taipei had an understanding that Chen would not hold public events. Representative Sam Gejdenson organized a meeting between Chen and about 15 Members of Congress (some of whom were in town for the Democratic National Convention), but Chen told them he was \"unavailable.\"44\n\nIn 2001, in granting President Chen \"private and unofficial\" transits through New York (May 21-23) and Houston (June 2-3) en route to and from Latin America, the Bush Administration took a different position on such meetings. As the State Department spokesperson said, \"we do believe that private meetings between Members of Congress and foreign leaders advance our national interests, so [Chen] may have meetings with Members of Congress.\"45 On the night of May 21, 2001, 21 Representatives attended a dinner with Chen in New York, and Representative Tom DeLay later hosted Chen in Houston.\n\nIn 2003, while considering his safety, comfort, convenience, and dignity, the Bush Administration again granted President Chen's requests for transits to and from Panama through New York (October 31-November 2) and Anchorage (November 4-5).46 Some Members of Congress personally welcomed Chen, including 16 Members who were already in New York and met with him. No Administration officials met with Chen, other than AIT officials based in Washington. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall Schriver reportedly canceled a planned meeting with Chen in New York, and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage talked with Chen by phone.47\n\nChen Shui-bian enjoyed extended transits through Honolulu and Seattle in August-September 2004, though these were less high-profile than that in New York. In January 2005, Chen stopped in Guam on the way back to Taiwan from Palau and the Solomon Islands. In September 2005, the Bush Administration allowed Chen to stop one day in Miami on his way to Latin America and in San Francisco on his return to Taiwan. The Congressional Human Rights Caucus, via teleconference, awarded Chen a human rights award while he was in Miami.\n\nHowever, in May 2006, the Bush Administration was not pleased at repeated statements from President Chen Shui-bian and responded by tightening restrictions on his proposed U.S. stops so that they would be strict transits (with no activities), conditions similar to those for Lee Teng-hui in 1994. Chen requested stops in San Francisco and New York for his visit to Latin America, but President Bush countered with transits in Honolulu and Anchorage, and Chen refused those U.S. cities. Representatives Thomas Tancredo and Dana Rohrabacher sent a letter on May 5, 2006, to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, questioning the decision's consistency with legislation; possible linkage to ties with Beijing; use of \"humiliating\" conditions on the transits; reversal of policy despite President Bush's affirmation of a consistent policy; impact on future U.S. stops; and implication for \"playing politics\" given the contrast with Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick's high-level meeting in Washington with the opposition KMT chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, two months earlier. In September 2006, the Administration allowed Chen to stop in Guam, but he had to switch to a civilian aircraft instead of his \"Air Force One\" that flew him to Palau.\n\nIn January 2007, the Administration allowed President Chen to stop overnight in San Francisco and to refuel in Los Angeles on his way to and from Nicaragua. In response to restrictions on Chen's transits, Representative Dana Rohrabacher and 14 other Members wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on January 12, 2007, calling for the removal of all restrictions on bilateral high-level visits with Taiwan. A week later, Representative Tancredo criticized (in extension of remarks) Mexico's ban of Chen's plane from Mexican airspace on his way to Los Angeles, a move similar to U.S. treatment toward Taiwan. In August 2007, the Administration restricted Chen's transits to 50-minute refueling stops in Anchorage on his way to and from Central America, with no overnight stays. For his last U.S. transit in January 2008, the Bush Administration allowed Chen to stop in Anchorage for two hours to refuel and rest.\n\nAfter Ma Ying-jeou won the election on March 22, 2008, he expressed a desire to visit the United States before his inauguration in May (after which U.S. policy would allow only transits). But the Bush Administration denied his request. President Ma later \"transited\" in the United States, where he sometimes met with Members of Congress and joined public activities (in Los Angeles, Austin, and San Francisco in 2008; in San Francisco and Honolulu in 2009; in San Francisco and Los Angeles in 2010; in New York and Los Angeles in 2013; in Los Angeles in January 2014; and Honolulu and San Francisco in June-July 2014).\n\n\"International Space\" and International Organizations\n\nThe United States, with congressional backing, has voiced some support for Taiwan's quest for \"international space\" (representation at international organizations), including \"meaningful participation\" in certain international organizations on transnational issues. Some advocates view such participation as preserving a democratic government's international presence and promoting the interests of Taiwan's people, while others support Taiwan's separate identity or independence. The Clinton Administration's 1994 Taiwan Policy Review promised to support Taiwan's membership in organizations where statehood is not a prerequisite and to support opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible.\n\nThe focus of Taiwan's international participation was at the World Health Organization (WHO), and the annual meetings in May in Geneva of its governing body, the World Health Assembly (WHA). On May 11, 2001, President Bush wrote to Senator Frank Murkowski, agreeing that the Administration should \"find opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in organizations in order to make a contribution, even if membership is impossible,\" including concrete ways for Taiwan to benefit from and contribute to the WHO. On April 9, 2002, Representatives in the House formed a Taiwan Caucus, and, as its first action, it wrote a letter on April 19, 2002, to the President, seeking support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO. With worldwide attention on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson expressed support for Taiwan in a speech at the WHA on May 19, 2003, saying that \"the need for effective public health exists among all peoples\" and \"that's why the United States has strongly supported Taiwan's inclusion in efforts against SARS and beyond.\"\n\nBy the meeting of the WHA in 2005, Taiwan lamented that the United States did not speak up and that the WHO signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the PRC to govern the WHO's technical exchanges with Taiwan.48 Still, the Bush Administration \"applauded\" the WHO and China for taking steps in 2005 to increase Taiwan's participation in WHO conferences.49\n\nTaiwan did not gain observer status at the WHA in May 2008, even as the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated as President after Chen Shui-bian's terms ended. In January 2009, the WHO included Taiwan in the International Health Regulations (IHR) which entered into force in 2007. President Ma shifted Taiwan's focus to the WHA meeting (rather than the WHO). In its required report submitted to Congress on April 1, 2009, the State Department stated that it supported Taiwan's observership in the WHA and welcomed the decrease in politicization over Taiwan's participation in the WHO due to improvements in cross-strait ties over the past year. Taiwan's Minister of Health participated for the first time as an observer at the WHA in May 2009.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the invitation required the PRC's approval, came under the WHO-PRC MOU, and was ad hoc (only for a KMT President). Indeed, the State Department's report to Congress in April 2010 acknowledged that the WHA invited Taiwan in 2009 after the PRC \"agreed to Taiwan's participation.\" The State Department also expressed support, assessing that Taiwan's participation in the WHA was a \"positive development\" and could provide a model for Taiwan's participation as an \"observer\" in other U.N. bodies. In its report to Congress of April 2011, the State Department stated that it worked for Taiwan's observership at the WHA again in 2010 and has sought regular invitations from the WHO to Taiwan every year. However, in May 2011, a secret WHO Memorandum dated September 14, 2010, came to light, showing that the WHO had an \"arrangement with China\" to implement the IHR for the \"Taiwan Province of China.\" That month in Geneva, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius protested to the WHO that no U.N. body has a right to determine unilaterally Taiwan's status.\n\nPresident Ma decided to be more flexible than his DPP predecessor in pressing Taiwan's bid to rejoin the U.N., which it left in 1971 (as the ROC). On August 14, 2008, Taiwan submitted instead a letter (via some countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations) to allow Taiwan to \"participate meaningfully\" in U.N. specialized agencies.50 Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Shear stated in March 2010 that \"the United States is a strong, consistent supporter of Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations.\" He also stated that \"Taiwan should be able to participate in organizations where it cannot be a member, such as the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and other important international bodies whose activities have a direct impact on the people of Taiwan.\" Taiwan has sought status as an observer in the WHO, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nVisa Waiver Program (VWP)\n\nUnder President Obama, on December 22, 2011, the State Department nominated Taiwan as a candidate for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), though there is no diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. On October 2, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Taiwan in the VWP, effective on November 1. Taiwan's citizens may travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa. Taiwan became the 37th country to join the VWP. For implementation of domestic laws, Section 4(b)(1) of the TRA provides that \"whenever the laws of the United States refer or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply with respect to Taiwan.\"\n\nSelect Major Legislation\n\nDuring the 103rd Congress, Congress passed and President Clinton signed (on April 30, 1994) the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1994 and FY1995 (P.L. 103-236) that, inter alia, directed the State Department to register foreign-born Taiwanese-Americans as U.S. citizens born in Taiwan (rather than China); and called for the President to send Cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and to show clear U.S. support for Taiwan in bilateral and multilateral relationships.\n\nAfter the Administration denied President Lee Teng-hui a visa in May 1994, the Senate, from July to October, passed amendments introduced by Senator Brown to ensure that Taiwan's President can enter the United States on certain occasions. Two amendments (for S. 2182 and H.R. 4606) that passed were not retained, but the amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 was enacted. Upon signing it into law (P.L. 103-416) on October 25, 1994, President Clinton said that he construed Section 221 as expressing Congress's view. Later, Congress overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan H.Con.Res. 53 expressing the sense of Congress that the President should promptly welcome a private visit by President Lee Teng-hui to his alma mater, Cornell University, and a transit stop in Anchorage, Alaska, to attend a conference. The House passed the resolution by 396-0 on May 2, and the Senate passed it by 97-1 on May 9, 1995 (with Senator Johnston voting Nay and Senators Moynihan and Warner not voting).\n\nDuring the 106th Congress, in 1999, Congress legislated a requirement for semi-annual reports on such U.S. support, in Section 704 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FYs 2000 and 2001 (P.L. 106-113). Also in 1999, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 106-137) requiring a report by the Secretary of State on efforts to support Taiwan's participation in the WHO. In January 2000, the State Department submitted the report, saying that the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in organizations, such as the U.N. or WHO, where statehood is a requirement for membership, but that it supports any arrangements acceptable to the WHO membership to allow for Taiwan to participate in the work of the WHO.51 In October 2000, the House and Senate passed H.Con.Res. 390, expressing the sense of Congress that the State Department's report failed to endorse Taiwan's participation in international organizations and that the United States should fulfill the commitment of the Taiwan Policy Review to more actively support Taiwan's participation in international organizations.\n\nIn the 107th Congress, on May 17, 2001, Members agreed without objection to H.Con.Res. 135 to welcome President Chen Shui-bian upon his visit. Congress enacted legislation, P.L. 107-10, authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate a U.S. plan to obtain observer status for Taiwan at the annual summit of the WHA in May 2001 in Geneva. Then, Representative Sherrod Brown and Senator Torricelli introduced H.R. 2739 and S. 1932 to amend the law to target the May 2002 meeting. H.R. 2739 was passed and enacted as P.L. 107-158 on April 4, 2002.\n\nAs enacted on September 30, 2002, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 (P.L. 107-228) authorizedâat the Bush Administration's requestâU.S. departments or agencies (including the Departments of State and Defense) to assign or detail employees to the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the non-profit corporation (with offices in Washington and Taipei) that has handled the U.S.-Taiwan relationship in the absence of diplomatic ties since 1979 under the TRA. (Personnel at AIT were technically \"separated\" from government service for a period of time, raising issues about employment status, benefits, recruitment, etc.) The legislation also expressed the sense of Congress that AIT and the residence of its director in Taipei should publicly display the U.S. flag \"in the same manner as United States embassies, consulates, and official residences throughout the world.\"\n\nIn the 108th Congress, the House and Senate passed S. 243 to authorize the Secretary of State to initiate a U.S. plan to obtain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA in May 2003. Upon signing the bill as P.L. 108-28 on May 29, 2003, President Bush stated that \"the United States fully supports the overall goal of Taiwan's participation in the work of the WHO, including observership\" but considered the act to be consistent with the \"one China\" policy. On October 30, 2003, the House passed H.Con.Res. 302 (416-0) to welcome President Chen to the United States.\n\nOn April 21 and May 6, 2004, the House and Senate passed H.R. 4019 and S. 2092 in support of Taiwan's efforts to gain observer status in the WHO and to make it an annual requirement to have an unclassified report from the Secretary of State on the U.S. plan to help obtain that status for Taiwan. An implication of this change was the end of annual focused congressional statements and votes. In signing S. 2092 into law (P.L. 108-235) on June 14, 2004, President Bush stated that the United States fully supported the participation of Taiwan in the work of the WHO, including observer status. However, he also declared that his Administration shall construe the reporting requirement by using his authority to \"withhold information\" which could impair foreign relations or other duties of the executive branch.\n\nWhile the State Department initially stopped short of publicly supporting Taiwan's observership in ICAO, Congress supported that goal. In July 2010, the House passed H.Con.Res. 266 (Berkley) to express the sense of Congress that Taiwan should be accorded observer status in ICAO. In the 112th Congress, in September 2011, the Senate agreed to S.Con.Res. 17 (Menendez) with the same sense of Congress. The House also agreed to S.Con.Res. 17 in September 2012.\n\nIn the 113th Congress, on June 18 and 19, 2013, the House and Senate, respectively, passed H.R. 1151 (Royce) and S. 579 (Menendez), to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan at the triennial ICAO Assembly next held in September-October 2013 in Montreal, Canada. The House passed H.R. 1151 (by 424-0). The Senate passed H.R. 1151 (by unanimous consent) on June 27. President Obama signed the bill into law (P.L. 113-17) on July 12. He issued a statement of support for Taiwan's participation at ICAO, while construing the act to be consistent with the \"one China\" policy. On August 28, the State Department submitted a report as required by Section 1(c) of the legislation. The State Department told Congress of U.S. support for \"observer status\" for Taiwan in all of the meetings of ICAO. The report pointed to the ICAO Council, which meets regularly, in contrast to the ICAO Assembly, which meets triennially. The State Department noted that U.S. support for Taiwan in ICAO is consistent with the \"one China\" policy and the TRA.\n\nIssue Area 2: Use of Force\n\nThe PRC has never renounced its claimed right to use force in what it sees as an internal problem and, moreover, has voiced more explicitly and demonstrated clearly its willingness to use force for political if not military objectivesâdespite its announced policy of \"peaceful unification.\" Since the early 1990s, the PRC has purchased advanced arms from the Soviet Union/Russia and built up its missile force. In December 1992 and March 1993, top PRC ruler Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng warned of \"drastic\" or \"resolute\" measures to prevent Taiwan's independence. Jiang reportedly ordered the PLA in January 1993 to win \"high-tech local wars\" focused on the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense reported that the CPC's Central Military Commission (CMC) decided at a meeting in June 1993 to focus the PLA against Taiwan.52\n\nIn the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996, the PRC launched provocative military exercises, including missile \"test-firings,\" to express displeasure with President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States and to intimidate voters before Taiwan's first democratic presidential election. President Clinton deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups near Taiwan in March 1996. The United States believed that the PLA accelerated its buildup since the crisis. The PRC raised tension again in 1999, after Lee said the cross-strait relationship was \"special state-to-state ties.\"\n\nIn February 2000, on the eve of another presidential election in Taiwan, the PRC issued its second White Paper on Taiwan, reaffirming the peaceful unification policy but adding a new precondition for the use of force. As one of \"Three Ifs,\" the PRC warned that even if Taiwan indefinitely refuses to negotiate a peaceful settlement, the PRC would be compelled to use force to achieve unification. No deadline was issued. The White Paper warned the United States not to sell arms to Taiwan or pursue any form of alliance with Taiwan, including cooperation in missile defense. Before the presidential election in 2004, a PRC official on Taiwan affairs who was a PLA major general issued a threat, on November 18, 2003, to use force against what Beijing perceives as the \"open promotion of Taiwan independence.\" Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage responded by saying that \"there's an election and campaign going on in Taiwan, and I think one shouldn't over-emphasize comments that are made in the heat of an election\" and that the United States \"has full faith that the question of Taiwan will be resolved peacefully.\"53\n\nConcerned about the PRC's provocations, President Bush did not support DPP President Chen (2000-2008) nor Taiwan's independence or membership in the U.N. President Bush also opposed referendums on membership in the U.N. during Taiwan's presidential election on March 22, 2008. For that election, President Bush sent two aircraft carriers near Taiwan, whose largely symbolic referendums were nonetheless targets of the PRC's belligerent condemnation. The referendums failed to be valid, and the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou won as president. (See CRS Report RL34441, Security Implications of Taiwan's Presidential Election of March 2008, by Shirley Kan.)\n\nCommitment to Help Taiwan's Self-Defense\n\nSince the 1950s, the United States government, with a critical congressional role, has expressed the consistent position for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. Implementation of U.S. policy included the U.S.-ROC Defense Treaty of 1954 and the Formosa Resolution, P.L. 84-4.54 After termination of the treaty, Congress passed and President Carter signed the TRA of 1979, adding U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan's self-defense and a potential U.S. role in maintaining peace in the strait. The TRA left the U.S. obligation to help defend Taiwan somewhat ambiguous and did not bind future U.S. decisions. Section 2(b)(4) states that the United States will consider with \"grave concern\" any non-peaceful means to determine Taiwan's future. The TRA also excluded the islands off the mainland (e.g., Quemoy and Matsu) in its security coverage over Taiwan. Nonetheless, the Section 2(b)(6) of the TRA declares it to be policy to maintain the U.S. capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan [emphasis added].\n\nIn 1982, President Reagan signed the Joint Communique on reducing arms sales to Taiwan, but he also stated in public and internal clarifications that U.S. arms sales will continue in accordance with the TRA and with the full expectation that the PRC's approach to the resolution of the Taiwan issue will continue to be peaceful. President George H. W. Bush decided in September 1992 to sell 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan, citing concerns about the cross-strait military balance.\n\nOn March 10 and 11, 1996, the Clinton Administration announced decisions to deploy two aircraft carrier battle groups to waters off Taiwan, after the PRC announced renewed PLA exercises that would include further missile \"test-firings\" toward Taiwan and Congress introduced legislation on helping to defend the ROC. President Clinton demonstrated that there might be grave consequences, as well as grave concern, to non-peaceful efforts to determine Taiwan's future. However, the Joint Statement at the 1997 Clinton-Jiang summit did not mention the TRA.\n\nIn April 2001, President George W. Bush publicly stated the U.S. commitment to Taiwan as an obligation to do \"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself\" [emphasis added].55 Visiting two allies then China in February 2002, the President, in Tokyo, cited the U.S. commitment to Taiwan in the context of support for five regional allies (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, and Thailand)âto applause from the Diet, or Japan's legislature. Then, in Beijing, Bush emphasized U.S. commitments to the TRA and a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question, while voicing opposition to provocations from either side.\n\nHowever, indicating concerns about miscalculations of U.S. views in Taiwan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless told Taiwan's Deputy Defense Minister Chen Chao-min in February 2003 that, while the President said we will do whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself, Taiwan \"should not view America's resolute commitment to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as a substitute for investing the necessary resources in its own defense.\"56\n\nIn November 2003, with concerns about PRC threats and Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian's efforts to hold referendums, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said that the TRA is not a defense treaty. Armitage added that the TRA guides policy in providing Taiwan \"sufficient defense articles for her self-defense\" and \"also requires the United States to keep sufficient force in the Asia Pacific area to be able to keep the area calm.\" Armitage reaffirmed that the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan's self-defense, with no defense treaty, \"doesn't go beyond that in the Taiwan Relations Act, and we have good, competent military forces there.\"57 President Bush appeared with PRC Premier Wen Jiabao in the Oval Office on December 9, 2003, and stated U.S. opposition to any unilateral decisions made by the leader of Taiwan to change the status quo.\n\nIn April 2004, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly further clarified U.S. policy after Chen Shui-bian's re-election in March and warned Taiwan not to dismiss PRC statements as \"empty threats\" and warned of \"limitations\" to U.S. support for constitutional changes in Taiwan. At the same time, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Peter Rodman warned Beijing that its attempt to use force would \"inevitably\" involve the United States.58\n\nIn September 2005, the Defense Department further clarified the mutual obligations under the TRA and limits to the U.S. ability to assist Taiwan. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless issued a speech, stressing the TRA's focus on Taiwan's self-defense. He declared that,\n\ninherent in the intent and logic of the TRA is the expectation that Taiwan will be able to mount a viable self-defense. For too long, the Taiwan Relations Act has been referenced as purely a U.S. obligation.... Under the TRA, the U.S. is obligated to \"enable\" Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense, but the reality is, it is Taiwan that is obligated to have a sufficient self-defense. There is an explicit expectation in the TRA that Taiwan is ready, willing, and able to maintain its self-defense. Taiwan must fulfill its unwritten, but clearly evident obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act by appropriately providing for its own defense while not simply relying on the U.S.' capacity to address a threat in the Strait. The TRA requires both parties to do their part to deter aggression or coercion vis-a-vis Taiwan.59\n\nAside from the issue of whether the U.S. strategy on assisting Taiwan's self-defense should be ambiguous or clear in a policy seeking deterrence towards Beijing and Taipei, a third view advocates the removal of any defense commitment (implicit or explicit) while continuing to sell weapons for Taiwan's self-defense.60\n\nArms Sales and Military Cooperation\n\nDespite the absence of diplomatic and alliance relations, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been significant. A related issue has been whether to pursue normalization of ties with Taiwan. After tensions in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996, the Pentagon under the Clinton Administration quietly expanded the sensitive military relationship with Taiwan to levels unprecedented since 1979. These broader exchanges reportedly have increased attention to so-called \"software\" (discussions over strategy, logistics, command and control, and plans in the event of an invasion of Taiwan).\n\nThe George W. Bush Administration continued and expanded the closer military ties at different levels. In April 2001, President Bush announced he would drop the 20-year-old annual arms sales talks used with Taiwan's military in favor of normal, routine considerations of Taiwan's requests on an as-needed basis. Then, the Bush Administration granted a visa for ROC Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming to visit the United States to attend a private conference held by the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council on March 10-12, 2002, in St. Petersburg, FL, making him the first ROC defense minister to come to the United States on a non-transit purpose since 1979.61 Also in 2002, the Bush Administration requested legislation to authorize the assignment of personnel from U.S. departments and agencies to AIT, with implications for the assignment of active-duty military personnel to Taiwan for the first time since 1979. (See the discussion below of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003.) One objective was to select from a wider range of personnel, without excluding those on active duty. The first active-duty defense attachÃ© since 1979, an Army Colonel began his duty in Taipei in August 2005 with civilian clothes and a status similar to military attaches assigned to Hong Kong, except that military personnel in Hong Kong may wear uniforms at some occasions.62 While allowing military representatives in Taiwan, the Administration maintained a ban on visits by U.S. general and flag officers to Taiwan, under the State Department's \"Guidelines on Relations with Taiwan.\"\n\nAlthough there has been much interest among U.S. academic circles and think tanks in pursuing talks with China on its military buildup and increased U.S. security assistance to Taiwan,63 a catalyst for this debate among policy makers arose out of the U.S.-PRC summit in Crawford, TX, on October 25, 2002. As confirmed to Taiwan's legislature by its envoy to Washington, C.J. Chen, and reported in Taiwan's media, PRC leader Jiang Zemin offered in vague terms a freeze or reduction in China's deployment of missiles targeted at Taiwan, in return for restraints in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.64 President Bush reportedly did not respond to Jiang's linkage. Policy considerations include the TRA (under which the United States has based its defense assistance to Taiwan on the threat that it faces), the 1982 Joint Communique (which discussed reductions in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan premised on the PRC's peaceful unification policy), and the 1982 \"Six Assurances\" to Taiwan (which said the United States did not agree to hold prior consultations with the PRC on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan). On April 21, 2004, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly testified to the House International Relations Committee that if the PRC meets its stated obligations to pursue a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and matches its rhetoric with a military posture that bolsters and supports peaceful approaches to Taiwan, \"it follows logically that Taiwan's defense requirements will change.\"\n\nSelect Major Legislation\n\nSince the 1990s, particularly given the PLA's provocative exercises and missile launches in 1995-1996, Congress has asserted its role vis-a-vis the President in determining arms sales under Section 3(b) of the TRA, and in exercising its oversight of the TRA, including Section 2(b)(6) on the U.S. capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion against Taiwan.\n\nIn the 103rd Congress, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1994-FY1995 (P.L. 103-236) that, inter alia, declared that Section 3 of the TRA (i.e., on arms sales) takes primacy over statements (i.e., the 1982 joint communique).\n\nDuring the 104th Congress, in early 1996, Congress became increasingly concerned about provocative PLA exercises held the previous summer and again on the eve of Taiwan's presidential election in March 1996 (with \"test-firings\" of M-9 short-range ballistic missiles to target areas close to the two Taiwan ports of Kaohsiung and Keelung). Introduced by Representative Chris Cox on March 7, passed by the House on March 19, and passed by the Senate on March 21, 1996, H.Con.Res. 148 expressed the sense of Congress that the United States should assist in defending the ROC. On March 13, 1996, during markup of H.Con.Res. 148 in the House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, Delegate Eni Faleomavaega noted that House and Senate resolutions prompted the Clinton Administration to deploy the USS Independence and USS Nimitz carriers. The resolution cited Section 3(c) of the TRA, which directs the President to inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or the social or economic system of the people on Taiwan and to determine the U.S. response along with Congress. However, on March 14, 1996, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord told the subcommittee that \"however serious, the present situation does not constitute a threat to Taiwan of the magnitude contemplated by the drafters of the Taiwan Relations Act\" and that \"if warranted by circumstances, we will act under Section 3(c) of the TRA, in close consultation with the Congress.\"\n\nIn the 105th Congress, the FY1999 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (P.L. 105-261) required the Secretary of Defense to study the U.S. missile defense systems that could protect and could be transferred to \"key regional allies,\" defined in the conference report as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.65 In addition, the conference report (H.Rept. 105-746 of the FY1999 Defense Appropriations Act, P.L. 105-262) required a report from the Pentagon on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait, in both classified and unclassified forms.66\n\nIn the 106th Congress, the FY2000 NDAA (P.L. 106-65) enacted a requirement for the Pentagon to submit annual reports on PRC military power and the security situation in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nIn asserting its role in decision-making on arms sales to Taiwan, Congress passed language, introduced by Senator Lott, in the FY2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (in Div. B of P.L. 106-113), requiring the Secretary of State to consult with Congress to devise a mechanism for congressional input in determining arms sales to Taiwan. Again, in the FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (Â§581 of P.L. 106-429), Congress passed the Taiwan Reporting Requirement, requiring the President to consult on a classified basis with Congress 30 days prior to the next round of arms sales talks. (Those consultations took place on March 16, 2001.)\n\nIn addition to examining arms sales, Congress looked closer at U.S. military deployments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113) required a report on the operational planning of the Defense Department to implement the TRA and any gaps in knowledge about PRC capabilities and intentions affecting the military balance in the Taiwan Strait.67\n\nIn the 107th Congress, the NDAA for FY2002 (P.L. 107-107), enacted December 28, 2001, authorized the President to transfer (by sale) the four Kidd-class destroyers to Taiwan (Â§1011), under Section 21 of the AECA. Also, Section 1221 of the act required a section in the annual report on PRC military power (as required by P.L. 106-65) to assess the PLA's military acquisitions and any implications for the security of the United States and its friends and allies. The scope of arms transfers to be covered was not limited to those from Russia and other former Soviet states, as in the original House language (H.R. 2586).68\n\nThe Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2002 (P.L. 107-115), as enacted on January 10, 2002, brought unprecedented close coordination between the executive and legislative branches on arms sales to Taiwan. Section 573 required the Departments of State and Defense to provide detailed briefings (not specified as classified) to committees (including those on appropriations) within 90 days of enactment and not later than every 120 days thereafter during FY2002. The briefings were to cover U.S.-Taiwan discussions on potential sales of defense articles or services.\n\nSome Members in the House and Senate called for ensuring regular and high-level consultations with Taiwan and a role for Congress in determining arms sales to Taiwan, after President Bush announced on April 24, 2001, that he would drop the annual arms talks process with Taiwan in favor of normal, routine considerations on an \"as-needed\" basis. Enacted as P.L. 107-228, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 authorizedâat the Bush Administration's requestâthe Department of State and other departments or agencies (including the Department of Defense) to detail employees to AIT (Section 326); required that Taiwan be \"treated as though it were designated a major non-NATO ally\" (Section 1206); required consultations with Congress on U.S. security assistance to Taiwan every 180 days (Section 1263); and authorized the sale to Taiwan of the four Kidd-class destroyers (Section 1701). Section 326, amending the Foreign Service Act of 1980, had significant implications for the assignment of government officials to Taiwan, including active-duty military personnel for the first time since 1979.\n\nIn signing the bill into law on September 30, 2002, President Bush issued a statement that included his view of Section 1206 (on a \"major non-NATO ally\"). He said that \"Section 1206 could be misconstrued to imply a change in the 'one China' policy of the United States when, in fact, that U.S. policy remains unchanged. To the extent that this section could be read to purport to change United States policy, it impermissibly interferes with the President's constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs.\" Nonetheless, the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Michael Wynne, submitted a letter to Congress on August 29, 2003, that designated Taiwan as a \"major non-NATO ally.\"\n\nThe House-passed FY2003 NDAA contained Section 1202 seeking to require the Defense Secretary to implement a comprehensive plan to conduct combined training and exchanges of senior officers with Taiwan's military and to \"enhance interoperability\" with Taiwan's military. The language was similar to that of Section 5(b) in the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) proposed in the 106th Congress. The Senate's version did not have the language. As enacted on December 2, 2002, P.L. 107-314 contained a revised section (1210) requiring a Presidential report 180 days after the act's enactment on the feasibility and advisability of conducting combined operational training and exchanges of senior officers with Taiwan's military. (Military exchanges may take place in the United States, but U.S. flag/general officers may not visit Taiwan.)69\n\nIn the 110th Congress, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved, on September 26, 2007, H.Res. 676 (Ros-Lehtinen) that noted the Bush Administration's lack of response to Taiwan's interest in buying F-16C/D fighters and that urged the Administration to determine security assistance \"based solely\" upon the legitimate defense needs of Taiwan (citing Section 3(b) of the TRA). The House passed H.Res. 676 on October 2, 2007. The House also passed H.R. 6646 on September 23, 2008. Some Members suspected that Bush had a \"freeze\" on arms sales to Taiwan until notifications to Congress on October 3, 2008.\n\nIn the 111th Congress, Senator John Cornyn introduced on July 23, 2009, an amendment to the NDAA for FY2010 to require President Obama to report on an assessment of Taiwan's air force, in examining Taiwan's need for new F-16C/D fighters. In conference, the Senate Armed Services Committee receded on the section to require in the legislation for a Presidential report on Taiwan's air force and U.S. options. Still, the conference report (H.Rept. 111-288) directed the Defense Secretary to submit an assessment to Congress on Taiwan's air defense. The bill was enacted as P.L. 111-84 on October 28, 2009. Secretary Gates submitted an unclassified study to Congress in February 2010. The Obama Administration later submitted on September 22, 2011, the Defense Department's comprehensive, classified report on Taiwan's air power.\n\nIn the 112th Congress, Members passed the NDAA for FY2013 (P.L. 112-239) with Section 1281 to express the sense of Congress that the President should take steps to address Taiwan's shortfall in fighters, whether through the sale of F-16C/D aircraft or other aircraft of similar capability. The conference report for the FY2013 NDAA required a briefing on Taiwan's air force by April 15.\n\nIn the 113th Congress, the House, on June 14, 2013, passed H.R. 1960 (McKeon), the FY2014 NDAA, with Section 1265 to direct the President to sell 66 F-16C/D fighters (approved as language offered by Representative Gerald Connolly for amendments en bloc). The Senate Armed Services Committee's report of June 20 (S.Rept. 113-44) for the FY2014 NDAA, S. 1197, extended the deadline to July 15, 2013, for the Defense Department to brief on Taiwan's air power and requested a classified report on Taiwan's air force by December 1. The briefing took place on July 17. The House-Senate agreement on the NDAA of December 10 did not include Section 1265, while calling on the President to continue to take steps to enable Taiwan's air force to contribute to a \"sufficient\" self-defense capability. The Defense Department delivered a classified report on Taiwan's air force to Congress on January 3, 2014.\n\nOn April 7, 2014, the House passed H.R. 3470 (Royce), which incorporated H.Res. 494 and was renamed the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 (which would, inter alia, authorize transfers by sale of up to four excess U.S. Navy Perry-class frigates to Taiwan). (H.Res. 494 (Royce) would affirm the importance of the TRA on its 35th anniversary of enactment.) On December 4 and 10, respectively, the Senate and House passed S. 1683 (Menendez) to authorize transfers of frigates to Taiwan (by sale) and Mexico. S. 1683 became P.L. 113-276 on December 18.\n\nRepresentative Forbes introduced language in the House Armed Services Committee's report on the FY2015 NDAA, H.R. 4435 to direct the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to report by October 1, 2014, on any benefits and associated costs and security requirements of integrating Taiwan's early warning radar with other U.S. missile defense and sensor systems to improve U.S. missile defense capabilities. In December 2014, Congress passed the FY2015 NDAA (H.R. 3979; enacted as P.L. 113-291). Section 1256 retained the previous House-passed H.R. 4435's requirement for the Defense Secretary to report on Taiwan's maritime capabilities but expanded the scope of the report to cover its self-defense capabilities. The FY2015 NDAA also retained the language of the Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 2410 and H.R. 4435 in Section 1259A to express the sense of Congress that the United States should consider opportunities to help enhance the maritime capabilities and nautical skills of Taiwan's navy to contribute to Taiwan's self-defense and to regional peace and stability; and that the PRC and Taiwan should be afforded opportunities to participate in (not just observe) the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) portions of future multilateral exercises, such as RIMPAC. The final legislation dropped a section in the House-passed bill to require a sale of F-16C/D fighters.\n\nIssue Area 3: Dialogue\n\nPresident Nixon in 1972, President Carter in 1978, and President Reagan in 1982 publicly stated the U.S. expectation that \"the Chinese\" themselves will settle the Taiwan question. Reagan also gave \"Six Assurances\" to Taiwan. The assurances, made just before the United States and the PRC issued the August 17, 1982, Joint communique, included assurances that Washington will not mediate between Taipei and Beijing, and will not pressure Taipei to negotiate with Beijing.\n\nUrging Cross-Strait Dialogue\n\nOne policy question concerns the extent of U.S. encouragement of cross-strait dialogue and the U.S. role in any talks or negotiations to resolve the Taiwan question. As Taipei and Beijing's economic relationship grew to significant levels by the early 1990s and the two sides began to talk directly through quasi-official organizations, the Clinton Administration increasingly voiced its support for the cross-strait dialogue, encouraging Taipei in particular. Like a bystander, the State Department said in its Taiwan Policy Review of 1994 that \"the United States applauds the continuing progress in the cross-strait dialogue.\" After talks broke off and military tensions flared, however, the Administration, after 1996, privately and publicly urged both sides to hold this dialogue as an added part of a more proactive U.S. policy. In July 1996, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake visited China and planned a meeting (later canceled) with Wang Daohan, head of the PRC's organization for cross-strait talks. At the 1997 U.S.-PRC summit, President Clinton urged for a peaceful resolution \"as soon as possible\" and that \"sooner is better than later.\"\n\nIn March 1999, Assistant Secretary of State Stan Roth raised the possibility of \"interim agreements\" between Beijing and Taipei, after several prominent former Clinton Administration officials made similar proposals. Roth's mention of possible \"interim agreements\" raised concerns in Taipei that it was a proposal by the Clinton Administration to pressure Taipei into negotiating with Beijing. Roth's remarks came in the context of suggestions to reduce cross-strait tensions issued by former or future Clinton Administration officials. In January 1998, a delegation of former officials led by former Defense Secretary William Perry had visited Beijing and Taipei, reportedly passing a message from the PRC that it was willing to resume talks with Taiwan. The February 21, 1998, Washington Post reported that the delegation was part of the Administration's effort to have a \"track two\" dialogue with Beijing and Taipei and to encourage resumption of cross-strait talks. At a February 1998 conference in Taipei, Kenneth Lieberthal (a University of Michigan professor who later joined the NSC as the Senior Director for Asian Affairs in August 1998) had proposed a 50-year \"interim arrangement\" in which the PRC (as \"China\") would renounce the use of force against Taiwan, and the ROC (as \"Taiwan, China\") would agree not to declare independence (Reuters, March 1, 1998).\n\nIn the March 8, 1998, Washington Post, Joseph Nye (former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs) had proposed a \"three-part package\" that would include a clarification that Washington would not recognize or defend Taiwan independence but also would not accept the use of force against Taiwan, and a \"one country, three systems\" approach. Also in March 1998, former National Security Advisor Anthony Lake had visited Taiwan and reportedly encouraged resumption of cross-strait talks. In Foreign Affairs (July/August 1998), Chas Freeman (former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs) had urged Washington to encourage Beijing and Washington to defer negotiations on their long-term relationship for a certain period, such as 50 years, and to reevaluate arms sales to Taiwan. In February-March 1999, Perry had led another delegation, including retired Admiral Joseph Prueher (later nominated in September 1999 to be ambassador to Beijing), and the group made suggestions to the PRC and Taiwan on how to reduce cross-strait tensions, according to Notes from the National Committee (Winter/Spring 1999). Later, on September 5, 1999, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Shirk reportedly mentioned \"one country, three systems\" as a possible approach for \"one China.\"\n\nThree Pillars and \"Assent\" of Taiwan's People\n\nIn July 1999, the Clinton Administration's stance on cross-strait dialogue culminated in the President's articulation of a new phrase: that U.S. policy has \"three pillars\" (one China, peaceful resolution, and cross-strait dialogue). Nonetheless, recognizing Taiwan's newly established status as a democracy, President Clinton in February 2000 added the U.S. expectation that the cross-strait dispute be resolved not only peacefully but also \"with the assent\" of Taiwan's people.\n\nRe-emphasis of the \"Six Assurances\"\n\nThe George W. Bush Administration began after Chen Shui-bian of the DPP became President in May 2000. The Administration indicated that it would not pressure Taipei to hold cross-strait dialogue, re-emphasizing the \"Six Assurances\" given to Taipei by President Reagan in 1982. At a hearing in March 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell assured Senator Jesse Helms that the \"Six Assurances\" remained U.S. policy and that the Administration would not favor consulting the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan.70 On June 12, 2001, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly testified to the House International Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan make a peaceful cross-strait resolution more likely. He said that \"the central question is how cross-strait relations can move from a focus on the military balance toward a focus on ways to begin resolving differences between Taipei and Beijing.\" While calling for a resumption of direct dialogue, economic cooperation, and mutual understanding, Kelly also said that \"the PRC cannot ignore the elected representatives of the people of Taiwan.\" While visiting Taiwan at about the same time that PRC Vice Premier Qian Qichen signaled a new receptive policy toward the ruling DPP in Taiwan, Richard Bush, chairman of AIT, said on January 28, 2002, that \"the United States favors and encourages dialogue but has no intention of serving as a mediator in this dispute or of pressuring Taiwan to negotiate.\" He added that \"it does not seem constructive for one side to set pre-conditions for a resumption of dialogue that the other side even suspects would be tantamount to conceding a fundamental issue before discussion begins.\"\n\nIn March 2002, Assistant Secretary of State Kelly told attendees at a conference that the Bush Administration would continue to uphold the \"Six Assurances,\" meaning no U.S. mediation and no pressure on Taiwan to go to the bargaining table.71 In testimony at a hearing in April 2004, after Chen Shui-bian's re-election in the March election, Kelly again reaffirmed the \"Six Assurances,\" but explicitly warned that \"a secure and self-confident Taiwan is a Taiwan that is more capable of engaging in political interaction and dialogue with the PRC, and we expect Taiwan will not interpret our support as a blank check to resist such dialogue.\" He urged both Beijing and Taipei to pursue dialogue \"as soon as possible\" and \"without preconditions.\"72\n\nMoreover, the George W. Bush Administration started by emphasizing deterrence and approved Taiwan's requests for major arms in 2001. In 2004, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice did urge Beijing to resume cross-strait talks and offered a vague U.S. role \"to further dialogue if it is helpful.\"73 Though the Administration repeatedly stated that Beijing should talk to the duly-elected leaders in Taipei, the Administration continued the approach of non-mediation in any talks. In 2005, in answer to Representative Leach about a U.S. role as \"facilitator,\" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall Schriver vaguely testified that good U.S. relations with Beijing and Taipei allow Washington to \"assist the two sides in getting to the negotiating table on mutually agreeable terms.\"74\n\nObama Administration and Convergence on \"Peaceful Development\"\n\nIn 2005, the KMT and CPC agreed on a party-to-party platform of cross-strait \"peaceful development.\" After the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou became president in Taiwan in 2008, CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao issued a policy toward Taiwan of \"peaceful development.\" A related issue was whether the United States should encourage or play another role in the increasing cross-strait dialogues that would include confidence-building measures (CBMs). In September 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg stated that the Administration \"encouraged\" the PRC and Taiwan to explore CBMs that would lead to closer ties and greater stability across the strait. His encouragement of CBMs raised expectations of an active U.S. role and injected new U.S. pressure in a sensitive domestic debate in Taiwan over whether such CBMs were premature and would serve Taiwan's security interests. President Obama held a summit in Beijing in November 2009 with Hu Jintao, and they issued the first U.S.-PRC Joint Statement in 12 years since the Clinton-Jiang Joint Statement of 1997.
