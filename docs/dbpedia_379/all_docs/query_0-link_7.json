        "text": "Content created: 2011-07-15\n\nFile last modified:\n\nSimple Map of Taiwan\n\nGo to Tables of Taiwan Place Names\n\nIt is a pet peeve of mine that most textbooks use geographical terms that are not found on the maps they provide.\n\nThis map covers TÃ¡iwÄn èºç£ / å°æ¹¾, including the Pescadores islands in the TÃ¡iwÄn Strait (constituting PÃ©nghÃº XiÃ n æ¾æ¹ç¸£ / æ¾æ¹å¿).\n\nThe map shows county (xiÃ n ç¸£ / å¿, Hokkien: koÃ¤n) names and the names of municipalities (shÃ¬ å¸, Hokkien: chhÃ¯) that count administratively at the same level as counties or higher. (A listing of about 400 names of Taiwan administrative units is separately available [link].)\n\nTÃ¡ibÄi City (TBS) and GÄoxiÃ³ng City (GXS) have long been considered (in TÃ¡iwÄn) to be \"special cities\" with the equivalent of \"provincial\" administrative status (comparable to the province of TÃ¡iwÄn itself), and they are therefore no longer part of TÃ¡ibÄi XiÃ n (TBX) and GÄoxiÃ³ng XiÃ n (GXX) respectively.\n\nChanges in 2010\n\nTÃ¡inÃ¡n. In 2010, TÃ¡inÃ¡n XiÃ n (TNX) was absorbed into Tainan City (TNS), which formerly had itself been part of the xiÃ n, and the various townships (xiÄng é / ä¹¡, Hokkien: hiong) and zhÃ¨n é® / é, Hokkien: tÃ¬n) within the county were converted to districts (qÅ« å / åº, Hokkien: khu), which were further subdivided into neighborhoods (lÇ é, Hokkien: lÃ­), often corresponding to former villages, although the suffix lÇ was not usually added to their names. Like TÃ¡ibÄi and GÄoxiÃ³ng, TÃ¡inÃ¡n, made up of the old TÃ¡inÃ¡n XiÃ n and TÃ¡inÃ¡n ShÃ¬, is now also considered a \"special municipality,\" by area the largest of the three. The consolidation of TNX and TNS is NOT represented on this map, since most sources you are likely to read differentiate them.\n\nTÃ¡ibÄi. By 2010 the population of TÃ¡ibÄi XiÃ n exceeded that of TÃ¡ibÄi City, and the XiÃ n was given independent city status under the Chinese name \"New North City\" (XīnbÄi ShÃ¬ æ°åå¸ / æ°åå¸). The official English name however is \"New Taipei\" rather than XīnbÄi to avoid the \"Communist\" letter X.) As with TÃ¡inÃ¡n, this change involved a cascade of changes as former townships became districts, &c. On this map and associated tables the older names are retained.\n\nSpellings & Abbreviations\n\nThe three-letter abbreviations used on this map and elsewhere on this web site for TÃ¡iwÄn county and municipality names are not official; they are my own invention. As with the China map, they allow this one to serve as an exercise in addition to being a reference.\n\nThe \"postal\" spellings are those most common in books about TÃ¡iwÄn. Since 1945 TÃ¡iwÄn's government has tried very halfheartedly to officialize several different Romanization systems, both for place names and more broadly. However, the main goal has always been to avoid using the mainland's now universal Pinyin system, and little effort was made in TÃ¡iwÄn to produce efficiency, consistency, or conformity, none of which are in evidence. Expect extreme variation!\n\nHokkien (Taiwanese) transcriptions on this page make slight compromises with standard spellings to facilitate computer handling. (Details) There is a good deal of dialect variation within Hokkien, even within Taiwan. For example, the city of JÄ«lÃ³ng is ke-lÃ´ng or koe-lÃ¢ng or ki-liÃ´ng or ke-lÃ¢ng depending upon the speaker. The pronunciations given here follow Guerrino Marescano's English-Amoy Dictionary (Taichung: Maryknoll Fathers, 1979), which lists Central Taiwan Hokkien pronunciations for all three-digit zip codes defined at the time of publication (pp. 857-862).\n\nIf you would like to print out a reference copy of the map, click on it to get a page with the map alone.\n\nEight relatively challenging interactive quizzes are available to help you review this page if you wish to use them. Each quiz opens into its own window in case you wish to refer to this page as you try them.\n\nQuiz Links: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (Quizzes 5 and 6 make use of Chinese Characters rather than Romanized names.)\n\nReturn to top.\n\nCentral TÃ¡iwÄn TZS TÃ¡izhÅng shÃ¬\n\nèºä¸­å¸ Taichung City\n\ntÃ¢i-tiong-chhÃ¯ TZX TÃ¡izhÅng xiÃ n\n\nèºä¸­ç¸£ Taichung County\n\ntÃ¢i-tiong-koÃ¤n ZHX ZhÄnghuÃ xiÃ n\n\nå½°åç¸£ Changhua Hsien\n\nchiong-huÃ -koÃ¤n PHX PÃ©nghÃº xiÃ n\n\næ¾æ¹ç¸£ Penghu Hsien\n\nphÃª*-Ã´u-koÃ¤n YLX YÃºnlÃ­n xiÃ n\n\né²æç¸£ Yunlin Hsien\n\nhÃ»n-lÃ®m-koÃ¤n NTX NÃ¡ntÃ³u xiÃ n\n\nåæç¸£ Nantou Hsien\n\nlÃ¢m-tÃ¢u koÃ¤n HLX HuÄliÃ¡n xiÃ n\n\nè±è®ç¸£ Hualien Hsien\n\nhoa-liÃ¢n-koÃ¤n\n\nReturn to top.\n\nReturn to top.\n\nSouthern TÃ¡iwÄn JYX JiÄyÃ¬ xiÃ n\n\nåç¾©ç¸£ Chiayi Hsien\n\nka-gÃ¯-koÃ¤n TNS TÃ¡inÃ¡n shÃ¬\n\nèºåå¸ Tainan City\n\ntÃ¢i-lÃ¢m-chhÃ¯ (TNX) TÃ¡inÃ¡n xiÃ n\n\nèºåç¸£ Tainan Hsien\n\ntÃ¢i-lÃ¢m-koÃ¤n\n\n(Incorporated into TNS in 2010) GXS GÄoxiÃ³ng shÃ¬\n\né«éå¸ Kaohsiung City\n\nko-hiÃ´ng-chhÃ¯ GXX GÄoxiÃ³ng xiÃ n\n\né«éç¸£ Kaohisung Hsien\n\nko-hiÃ´ng-koÃ¤n PDX PÃ­ngdÅng xiÃ n\n\nå±æ±ç¸£ Pingtung Hsien\n\npÃ®n-tong-koÃ¤n TDX TÃ¡idÅng xiÃ n\n\nèºæ±ç¸£ Taitung Hsien\n\ntÃ¢i-tang-koÃ¤n\n\nReturn to top."
