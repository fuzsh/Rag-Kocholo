As a result of peace negotiations between the South and North, Sun submits his resignation to the senate and recommends Yuan Shi-kai for the presidency. 1913 In spring, Yuan Shi-kai goes against the ideals of the republic. Sun therefore begins efforts to overthrow Yuan in Shanghai, but fails. The incident is the so-called Second Revolution. 1914 Establishes a new party, the Zhong-hua Ge-ming Dang (China Revolutionary Party) in Tokyo, and assumes the post of Generalissimo of the revolutionary army to launch a punitive expedition to remove Yuan Shi-kai. 1916 In the wake of Yuan Shi-kai's death, Sun issues a manifesto demanding that President Li Yuan-hong, successor of Yuan, abide by the provisional constitution and continue the convocation of the parliament. 1917 Completes his translation of “Parliamentary Law” into Chinese. 1917-06 Provincial military governors revolt, and Zhang Xun restores Pu Yi to the imperial throne.
