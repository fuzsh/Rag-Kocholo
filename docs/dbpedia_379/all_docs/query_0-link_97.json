        "meta_description": "I Took this info from the Internet.\n\tIf anyone want to help, welcome\n\tThe Republic of China (ROC), commonly known as Taiwan, is a state in East Asia comprising the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other minor islands, which are located off the east coast of mainland China. Neighboring states include the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the west, Japan to the north-east, and the Republic of the Philippines to the south.\n\tThe founding of the Republic of China began on 10 October 1911 as a result of the Wuchang Uprising, but was not formally established until 1 January 1912. The ROC had once encompassed mainland China and Outer Mongolia. At the end of World War II, with the surrender of Japan, the Republic of China took over the island groups of Taiwan and Penghu from the Japanese Empire. With the end of the world war, the government drafted the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was adopted on 25 December 1947. When the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, KMT), the then leading party of the ROC, lost mainland China in the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1949, the central government relocated to Taiwan, establishing Taipei as its provisional capital Despite being forced out of mainland China, Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, declared that the ROC was still the legitimate government of China and Outer Mongolia. In mainland China, the victorious Communist party founded the People's Republic of China. The Taiwan Area became the extent of the Republic of China's jurisdiction.\n\tDuring the early Cold War the ROC was recognized by many Western nations and the United Nations as the sole legitimate government of China. It was a founding member of the United Nations and one of the five permanent members of the Security Council until 1971, when it was replaced by the PRC.\n\tThe PRC regards the ROC as an illegitimate state; it seeks to unify Taiwan with mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau and is ready to use force if necessary. In contrast, the Republic of China rejects PRC´s claim and views itself as a sovereign state. This tension between the two states colors most the political life in Taiwan, and any attempt at declaring formal independence is met with threats from the PRC. The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with countries which recognize the Republic of China; thus as of 2010, only 23 have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC.\n\tInitially a single-party state, the Republic of China evolved into a democratic state during the 1980s without widespread conflict. It has a semi-presidential system and universal suffrage. The President of the Republic of China serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The Legislative Yuan serves as the legislative body. The ROC is a member of the WTO and APEC. It is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has an industrialized advanced economy. The 26th-largest economy in the world;, its advanced technology industry plays a key role in the global economy. The ROC is ranked high in terms of freedom of the press, health care, public education, and economic freedom.\n\t\n\tHistory\n\tPlease go to\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_China\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_China</a>\n\t\n\tOther info\n\tOficial Name:\n\t中華民國\n\tChung-hua Min-Kuo\n\t\n\tEstablishment \n\tXinhai Revolution \n\t- Independence\n\tdeclared October 10, 1911 \n\t- Republic established January 1, 1912 \n\t- Relocated to\n\tTaiwan December 7, 1949 \n\t\n\tArea:\n\t36.188km2\n\t\n\tInhabitants: \n\t22.177.170\n\t\n\tLanguages: \n\tAmis [ami] 137,651 (2002 Council of Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan, ROC).

Classification: Austronesian, East Formosan, Southwest\n\t\n\tCapital city:\n\tTaipei\n\t\n\tMeaning island name: \n\tThe Han characters used today mean &quot;Terraced Bay&quot; in Chinese (terraced rice fields typify the Taiwanese landscape). However, older characters (e.g. 台員) have entirely different meanings. Moreover, some scholars believe the characters serve merely as convenient phonetic vehicles for writing down an older Austronesian name. In the early 17th century, when the Dutch East India Company came to build a commercial post at Fort Zeelandia (today's Tainan), they allegedly adopted the name of an aboriginal tribe transliterated as &quot;Tayouan&quot; or &quot;Teyowan&quot; in their records. Chinese merchants (and, later, Chinese officials) also adopted this same name, although different transliteration into Han characters tended to obscure the real etymology by sound, and often evoked varying myths and imaginings. An old-fashioned story traced &quot;Taiwan&quot; to a Hokkien (Minnan) phrase (埋冤) with the same pronunciation, meaning &quot;burying the unjustly dead,&quot; suggesting the riskiness of the sea journey to Taiwan. But this kind of story has given way to more persuasive evidence from ethnological and colonial sources. \n\tFormosa (former name): Portuguese for beautiful, Presumably because of the beauty of the island. \n\t\n\tDescription Flag:\n\tThe National Flag of the Republic of China (traditional Chinese: 中華民國國旗; simplified Chinese: 中华民国国旗; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó guóqí) is a well-known symbol of the Republic of China (ROC). It is commonly referred to in Chinese as Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth (traditional Chinese: 青天、白日、滿地紅; simplified Chinese: 青天、白日、满地红; pinyin: qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng) to reflect its attributes. This design was first used in China by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1917 and made the official flag of the ROC in 1928.\n\tThe current use of the flag is considered by some to be controversial due to the dispute over the political status of Taiwan. Within Taiwan, the flag is widely used as a national flag though there is controversy over its appropriateness. It is actively embraced as a symbol by Chinese reunification supporters as a historical link with mainland China, while a number of Taiwan independence supporters shun the flag for mainly the same reasons. Its use has been opposed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) because it suggests the continued existence of the ROC, which the PRC regards as defunct and to have been succeeded by the PRC in the Chinese Civil War. However, since the early 2000s, the PRC has had a more favorable view toward the flag, as it began to see the use of the flag in Taiwan as symbolizing a connection between Taiwan and mainland China, and news media in the PRC have often criticized supporters of Taiwanese independence for attempting to replace the flag.\n\tThough the flag of the Republic of China is commonly known in English as the &quot;flag of Taiwan&quot; (as the ROC is often referred to as &quot;Taiwan&quot;), this term is not commonly used in Chinese as some of the current symbolism and controversy can only be understood if one realizes that it is not officially the &quot;flag of Taiwan&quot;, but of a Republic that only assumed the administration of Taiwan in 1945 and moved its government there in 1949 after their defeat by the communist People's Republic of China following the unofficial cease-fire of the Chinese Civil War. This distinction is very important in Taiwanese politics.\n\t\n\tCoat of arms:\n\tThe Blue Sky with a White Sun (Chinese: 青天白日; pinyin: Qīng tīan bái rì) serves as the design for the party flag and emblem of the Kuomintang (KMT), the canton of the flag of the Republic of China, the national emblem of the Republic of China (ROC), and as the naval jack of the ROC Navy.\n\tIn the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; symbol, the twelve rays of the white Sun representing the twelve months and the twelve traditional Chinese hours (時辰 shíchen), each of which corresponds to two modern hours (小時 xiǎoshí, literal meaning: &quot;little shi&quot;) and symbolizes the spirit of progress.\n\tThe &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag was originally designed by Lu Hao-tung, a martyr of the Republican revolution. He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the Society for Regenerating China, an anti-Qing society in Hong Kong, on February 21, 1895. In 1905, Sun Yat-sen added a red field to the design to create what would become the current flag of the Republic of China.\n\tDuring the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 that heralded the Republic of China, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag was used in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, while the &quot;18-Star Flag&quot;, &quot;Five-Colored Flag&quot;, and other designs were used elsewhere. \n\tParty Emblem of the KuomintangWhen the government of the Republic of China was established on January 1, 1912, The &quot;Five-Colored&quot; flag was adopted as the national flag, but Sun Yat-sen did not consider its design appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times. Thus, when he established a rival government in Guangzhou in 1917, he brought over the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag for the party and the &quot;Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth&quot; (then the naval ensign) for the nation. This officially became the national flag in 1928, and continued to serve as the naval ensign; the &quot;Blue Sky with a White Sun&quot; flag was adopted as the naval jack at the same time.\n\tIn the early years of the Republic, under the KMT's political tutelage, the KMT party flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of National Father Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center.\n\tSince the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the KMT flag has lost some of its prominence. However, it is still frequently seen in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the pan-blue coalition.\n\tThe flag and the KMT party emblem made news during the ROC legislative elections of 2004, when President Chen Shui-bian suggested that the Kuomintang's flag and party emblem violated the ROC's National Emblem Law and copyright laws for being too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China. Chen stated that the law forbids the ROC's emblem and flag from being used by non-governmental organizations and warned that the KMT would have three months to change its flag and emblem if his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a majority of seats in the legislature. The KMT responded by asking the government to change the national emblem, saying the KMT emblem existed first. However, the pan-green coalition failed to win a majority, and Chen has taken no action since the initial statement.\n\t\n\tNational Anthem: taiwan\n\tTraditional Chinese Characters\n\t三民主義，吾黨所宗，\n\t以建民國，以進大同。\n\t咨爾多士，為民前鋒；\n\t夙夜匪懈，主義是從。\n\t矢勤矢勇，必信必忠；\n\t一心一德，貫徹始終。\n\t\n\tSimplified Chinese Characters\n\t三民主义，吾党所宗，\n\t以建民国，以进大同。\n\t咨尔多士，为民前锋；\n\t夙夜匪懈，主义是从。\n\t矢勤矢勇，必信必忠；\n\t一心一德，贯彻始终。\n\t\n\tHanyu Pinyin\n\tSānmín Zhǔyì, wú dǎng suǒ zōng,\n\tYǐ jiàn Mínguó, yǐ jìn Dàtóng.\n\tZī ěr duō shì, wèi mín qiánfēng;\n\tSù yè fěi xiè, Zhǔyì shì cóng.\n\tShǐ qín shǐ yǒng, bì xìn bì zhōng;\n\tYì xīn yì dé, guànchè shǐ zhōng.\n\t\n\tZhuyin Fuhao\n\tㄙ　ㄢ　　　ㄇㄧㄣˊ　　ㄓㄨ　ˇ　　ㄧ　ˋ\n\t\n\tㄨ　ˊ　　　ㄉ　ㄤˇ　　ㄙㄨㄛˇ　　ㄗㄨㄥˉ\n\t\n\tㄧ　ˇ　　　ㄐㄧㄢˋ　　ㄇㄧㄣˊ　　ㄍㄨㄛˊ\n\t\n\tㄧ　ˇ　　　ㄐㄧㄣˋ　　ㄉ　ㄚˋ　　ㄊㄨㄥˊ\n\t\n\tㄗ　　　　　ㄦ　ˇ　　　ㄉㄨㄛ　　　ㄕ　ˋ\n\t\n\tㄨ　ㄟˊ　　ㄇㄧㄣˊ　　ㄑㄧㄢˊ　　ㄈ　ㄥ\n\t\n\tㄙ　ㄨˋ　　ㄧ　ㄝˋ　　ㄈ　ㄟˇ　　ㄒㄧㄝˋ\n\t\n\tㄓ　ㄨˇ　　　ㄧ　ˋ　　ㄕ　　ˋ　　ㄘㄨㄥˊ\n\t\n\tㄕ　　ˇ　　ㄑㄧㄣˊ　　ㄕ　　ˇ　　ㄩ　ㄥˇ\n\t\n\tㄅ　ㄧˋ　　ㄒㄧㄣˋ　　ㄅ　ㄧˋ　　ㄓㄨㄥ\n\t\n\tㄧ　ˋ　　　ㄒㄧㄣ　　ㄧ　ˋ　　ㄉ　ㄜˊ\n\t\n\tㄍㄨㄢˋ　　ㄔ　ㄜˋ　　ㄕ　　ˇ　　ㄓㄨㄥ\n\t\n\tOfficial\n\tSan Min Chu-i,\n\tOur aim shall be:\n\tTo found, a free land,\n\tWorld peace, be our stand.\n\tLead on, comrades,\n\tVanguards ye are.\n\tHold fast your aim,\n\tBy sun and star.\n\tBe earnest and brave,\n\tYour country to save,\n\tOne heart, one soul,\n\tOne mind, one goal.\n\t\n\tLiteral\n\tThree Principles of the People,\n\tThe fundament of our party.\n\tUsing this, we establish the Country for the People;\n\tUsing this, we advance into a state of total peace.\n\tOh, you, warriors, \n\tFor the people, be the vanguard.\n\tWithout resting day or night,\n\tFollow the Principles.\n\tSwear to be diligent; swear to be courageous.\n\tObliged to be trustworthy; obliged to be loyal.\n\tWith one heart and one virtue,\n\tWe carry through until the very end.\n\t\n\tInternet Page: <a href=\"http://www.president.gov.tw\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.president.gov.tw</a>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cy.gov.tw\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cy.gov.tw</a>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.gio.gov.tw\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.gio.gov.tw</a>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.english.www.gov.tw\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.english.www.gov.tw</a>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.taiwantourism.org\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.taiwantourism.org</a>\n\t\n\tTaiwan in diferent languages\n\t\n\teng | afr | bre | cat | cym | dan | dsb | est | eus | fin | fry | fur | hau | hsb | ibo | ina | ita | jav | jnf | lin | lld | nld | nor | oci | roh | ron | rup | scn | slk | sme | swa | swe | vor | wln: Taiwan \n\targ | ast | glg | spa | tet: Taiwán \n\tcsb | mlt | pol | szl: Tajwan \n\tbam | kin | run: Tayiwani \n\tcrh | kaa | uzb: Tayvan / Тайвань \n\tdeu | ltz | nds: Taiwan / Taiwan \n\thrv | hun | slv: Tajvan \n\tind | msa: Taiwan / تايوان \n\tque | zza: Taywan \n\taze: Tayvan / Тајван \n\tbos: Tajvan / Тајван \n\tces: Tchajwan \n\tepo: Tajvano \n\tfao: Teivan \n\tfra: Taïwan \n\tfrp: Tayivan \n\tgla: Taiwan; Tai-Bhàn \n\tgle: An Téaváin / An Téaváin \n\tglv: Yn Taiwaan \n\tisl: Tævan \n\tkmr: Taywan / Т’айwан / تایوان \n\tkur: Taywan / تایوان \n\tlat: Taivania; Taevania; Formosa \n\tlav: Taivāna \n\tlit: Taivanas \n\tmlg: Taioana \n\tmol: Taiwan / Тайван \n\tnrm: Formôse; Tai’wai \n\tpor: Taiwan; Taiuã \n\trmy: Taiwan / ताइवान \n\tslo: Taivan / Таиван \n\tsmg: Taivans \n\tsqi: Tajvani \n\tsrd: Taiwàn \n\ttgl: Taywan; Taiwan \n\tton: Taiuani \n\ttuk: Taýwan / Тайвань \n\ttur: Tayvan \n\tvie: Đài Loan \n\twol: Taaywaan \n\tabq | alt | che | chm | chv | kir | kjh | kom | krc | kum | oss | rus | tyv | udm | ukr: Тайвань (Tajvan') \n\tbul | kbd | mon: Тайван (Tajvan) \n\tbak | tat: Тайвань / Tayvan \n\tbel: Тайвань / Tajvań \n\tkaz: Тайвань / Tayvan / تايۆان \n\tmkd: Тајван (Tajvan) \n\tsrp: Тајван / Tajvan \n\ttgk: Тайван / تیون / Tajvan \n\tara: تايوان (Tāywān); تيوان (Taywān) \n\tfas: تایوان / Tâyvân \n\tprs: تایوان (Tāyvān) \n\tpus: تايوان (Tāywān) \n\tuig: تەيۋەن / Teywen / Тәйвән \n\turd: تائیوان (Tāʾīvān) \n\tdiv: ތައިވާން (Ta'ivān) \n\theb: טיון (Ṭayvan); טיוואן / טייוואן (Ṭayvân); טאיוואן (Ṭâyvân) \n\tlad: טאייב'אן / Tayvan \n\tyid: טײַװאַן (Tayvan) \n\tamh: ታይዋን (Taywan); ታይቫኝ (Tayvañ) \n\tell: Ταϊβάν (Taïván) \n\thye: Թայվան (Ṭayvan) \n\tkat: ტაივანი (Taivani) \n\thin: ताइवान (Tāivān); तायवान (Tāyvān); तैवन (Tævan); टाइवान (Ṭāivān) \n\tben: তাইওয়ান (Tāioyān) \n\tpan: ਤਾਈਵਾਨ (Tāīvān) \n\tkan: ಟೈವಾನ್ (Ṭaivān) \n\tmal: തായ്വാന് (Tāyvān); തയ്വാന് (Tayvān) \n\ttam: தாய்வான் (Tāyvāṉ); தைவான் (Taivāṉ) \n\ttel: తైవాన్ (Taivān) \n\tzho: 臺灣/台湾 (Táiwān) \n\tyue: 臺灣/台湾 (Tòihwāan) \n\tjpn: 台湾 (Taiwan) \n\tkor: 대만 (Daeman) \n\tbod: ཐའེ་ཝན་ (Tʰa'e.wan.); ཐེ་ཝན་ (Tʰe.wan.); ཐའི་དབན་ (Tʰa'i.dban.); ཐའི་ཝའན་ (Tʰa'i.w'an.) \n\tdzo: ཏའི་ཝཱན་ (Ta'i.wān.) \n\tmya: တုိင္ဝမ္ (Taĩwã) \n\ttha: ไต้หวัน (Tái[h]wân) \n\tlao: ໄຕ້ຫວັນ (Tái[h]wân) \n\tkhm: តៃវ៉ាន់ (Taivan)",

Neighboring states include the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the west, Japan to the north-east, and the Republic of the Philippines to the south.\n\nThe founding of the Republic of China began on 10 October 1911 as a result of the Wuchang Uprising, but was not formally established until 1 January 1912. The ROC had once encompassed mainland China and Outer Mongolia. At the end of World War II, with the surrender of Japan, the Republic of China took over the island groups of Taiwan and Penghu from the Japanese Empire. With the end of the world war, the government drafted the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was adopted on 25 December 1947. When the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, KMT), the then leading party of the ROC, lost mainland China in the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1949, the central government relocated to Taiwan, establishing Taipei as its provisional capital Despite being forced out of mainland China, Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, declared that the ROC was still the legitimate government of China and Outer Mongolia. In mainland China, the victorious Communist party founded the People's Republic of China. The Taiwan Area became the extent of the Republic of China's jurisdiction.\n\nDuring the early Cold War the ROC was recognized by many Western nations and the United Nations as the sole legitimate government of China. It was a founding member of the United Nations and one of the five permanent members of the Security Council until 1971, when it was replaced by the PRC.\n\nThe PRC regards the ROC as an illegitimate state; it seeks to unify Taiwan with mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau and is ready to use force if necessary. In contrast, the Republic of China rejects PRC´s claim and views itself as a sovereign state. This tension between the two states colors most the political life in Taiwan, and any attempt at declaring formal independence is met with threats from the PRC. The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with countries which recognize the Republic of China; thus as of 2010, only 23 have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC.\n\nInitially a single-party state, the Republic of China evolved into a democratic state during the 1980s without widespread conflict. It has a semi-presidential system and universal suffrage. The President of the Republic of China serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The Legislative Yuan serves as the legislative body. The ROC is a member of the WTO and APEC. It is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has an industrialized advanced economy. The 26th-largest economy in the world;, its advanced technology industry plays a key role in the global economy. The ROC is ranked high in terms of freedom of the press, health care, public education, and economic freedom.\n\nHistory\n\nPlease go to\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_China\n\nOther info\n\nOficial Name:\n\n中華民國\n\nChung-hua Min-Kuo\n\nEstablishment\n\nXinhai Revolution\n\n- Independence\n\ndeclared October 10, 1911\n\n- Republic established January 1, 1912\n\n- Relocated to\n\nTaiwan December 7, 1949\n\nArea:\n\n36.188km2\n\nInhabitants:\n\n22.177.170\n\nLanguages:\n\nAmis [ami] 137,651 (2002 Council of Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan, ROC).

Classification: Austronesian, East Formosan, Southwest\n\nCapital city:\n\nTaipei\n\nMeaning island name:\n\nThe Han characters used today mean \"Terraced Bay\" in Chinese (terraced rice fields typify the Taiwanese landscape). However, older characters (e.g. 台員) have entirely different meanings. Moreover, some scholars believe the characters serve merely as convenient phonetic vehicles for writing down an older Austronesian name. In the early 17th century, when the Dutch East India Company came to build a commercial post at Fort Zeelandia (today's Tainan), they allegedly adopted the name of an aboriginal tribe transliterated as \"Tayouan\" or \"Teyowan\" in their records. Chinese merchants (and, later, Chinese officials) also adopted this same name, although different transliteration into Han characters tended to obscure the real etymology by sound, and often evoked varying myths and imaginings. An old-fashioned story traced \"Taiwan\" to a Hokkien (Minnan) phrase (埋冤) with the same pronunciation, meaning \"burying the unjustly dead,\" suggesting the riskiness of the sea journey to Taiwan. But this kind of story has given way to more persuasive evidence from ethnological and colonial sources.\n\nFormosa (former name): Portuguese for beautiful, Presumably because of the beauty of the island.\n\nDescription Flag:\n\nThe National Flag of the Republic of China (traditional Chinese: 中華民國國旗; simplified Chinese: 中华民国国旗; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó guóqí) is a well-known symbol of the Republic of China (ROC). It is commonly referred to in Chinese as Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth (traditional Chinese: 青天、白日、滿地紅; simplified Chinese: 青天、白日、满地红; pinyin: qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng) to reflect its attributes. This design was first used in China by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1917 and made the official flag of the ROC in 1928.\n\nThe current use of the flag is considered by some to be controversial due to the dispute over the political status of Taiwan. Within Taiwan, the flag is widely used as a national flag though there is controversy over its appropriateness. It is actively embraced as a symbol by Chinese reunification supporters as a historical link with mainland China, while a number of Taiwan independence supporters shun the flag for mainly the same reasons. Its use has been opposed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) because it suggests the continued existence of the ROC, which the PRC regards as defunct and to have been succeeded by the PRC in the Chinese Civil War. However, since the early 2000s, the PRC has had a more favorable view toward the flag, as it began to see the use of the flag in Taiwan as symbolizing a connection between Taiwan and mainland China, and news media in the PRC have often criticized supporters of Taiwanese independence for attempting to replace the flag.\n\nThough the flag of the Republic of China is commonly known in English as the \"flag of Taiwan\" (as the ROC is often referred to as \"Taiwan\"), this term is not commonly used in Chinese as some of the current symbolism and controversy can only be understood if one realizes that it is not officially the \"flag of Taiwan\", but of a Republic that only assumed the administration of Taiwan in 1945 and moved its government there in 1949 after their defeat by the communist People's Republic of China following the unofficial cease-fire of the Chinese Civil War. This distinction is very important in Taiwanese politics.\n\nCoat of arms:\n\nThe Blue Sky with a White Sun (Chinese: 青天白日; pinyin: Qīng tīan bái rì) serves as the design for the party flag and emblem of the Kuomintang (KMT), the canton of the flag of the Republic of China, the national emblem of the Republic of China (ROC), and as the naval jack of the ROC Navy.\n\nIn the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" symbol, the twelve rays of the white Sun representing the twelve months and the twelve traditional Chinese hours (時辰 shíchen), each of which corresponds to two modern hours (小時 xiǎoshí, literal meaning: \"little shi\") and symbolizes the spirit of progress.\n\nThe \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was originally designed by Lu Hao-tung, a martyr of the Republican revolution. He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the Society for Regenerating China, an anti-Qing society in Hong Kong, on February 21, 1895. In 1905, Sun Yat-sen added a red field to the design to create what would become the current flag of the Republic of China.\n\nDuring the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 that heralded the Republic of China, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was used in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, while the \"18-Star Flag\", \"Five-Colored Flag\", and other designs were used elsewhere.\n\nParty Emblem of the KuomintangWhen the government of the Republic of China was established on January 1, 1912, The \"Five-Colored\" flag was adopted as the national flag, but Sun Yat-sen did not consider its design appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times. Thus, when he established a rival government in Guangzhou in 1917, he brought over the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag for the party and the \"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\" (then the naval ensign) for the nation. This officially became the national flag in 1928, and continued to serve as the naval ensign; the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was adopted as the naval jack at the same time.\n\nIn the early years of the Republic, under the KMT's political tutelage, the KMT party flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of National Father Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center.\n\nSince the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the KMT flag has lost some of its prominence. However, it is still frequently seen in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the pan-blue coalition.\n\nThe flag and the KMT party emblem made news during the ROC legislative elections of 2004, when President Chen Shui-bian suggested that the Kuomintang's flag and party emblem violated the ROC's National Emblem Law and copyright laws for being too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China. Chen stated that the law forbids the ROC's emblem and flag from being used by non-governmental organizations and warned that the KMT would have three months to change its flag and emblem if his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a majority of seats in the legislature. The KMT responded by asking the government to change the national emblem, saying the KMT emblem existed first. However, the pan-green coalition failed to win a majority, and Chen has taken no action since the initial statement.\n\nNational Anthem: taiwan\n\nTraditional Chinese Characters\n\n三民主義，吾黨所宗，\n\n以建民國，以進大同。\n\n咨爾多士，為民前鋒；\n\n夙夜匪懈，主義是從。\n\n矢勤矢勇，必信必忠；\n\n一心一德，貫徹始終。\n\nSimplified Chinese Characters\n\n三民主义，吾党所宗，\n\n以建民国，以进大同。\n\n咨尔多士，为民前锋；\n\n夙夜匪懈，主义是从。\n\n矢勤矢勇，必信必忠；\n\n一心一德，贯彻始终。\n\nHanyu Pinyin\n\nSānmín Zhǔyì, wú dǎng suǒ zōng,\n\nYǐ jiàn Mínguó, yǐ jìn Dàtóng.\n\nZī ěr duō shì, wèi mín qiánfēng;\n\nSù yè fěi xiè, Zhǔyì shì cóng.\n\nShǐ qín shǐ yǒng, bì xìn bì zhōng;\n\nYì xīn yì dé, guànchè shǐ zhōng.\n\nZhuyin Fuhao\n\nㄙ ㄢ ㄇㄧㄣˊ ㄓㄨ ˇ ㄧ ˋ\n\nㄨ ˊ ㄉ ㄤˇ ㄙㄨㄛˇ ㄗㄨㄥˉ\n\nㄧ ˇ ㄐㄧㄢˋ ㄇㄧㄣˊ ㄍㄨㄛˊ\n\nㄧ ˇ ㄐㄧㄣˋ ㄉ ㄚˋ ㄊㄨㄥˊ\n\nㄗ ㄦ ˇ ㄉㄨㄛ ㄕ ˋ\n\nㄨ ㄟˊ ㄇㄧㄣˊ ㄑㄧㄢˊ ㄈ ㄥ\n\nㄙ ㄨˋ ㄧ ㄝˋ ㄈ ㄟˇ ㄒㄧㄝˋ\n\nㄓ ㄨˇ ㄧ ˋ ㄕ ˋ ㄘㄨㄥˊ\n\nㄕ ˇ ㄑㄧㄣˊ ㄕ ˇ ㄩ ㄥˇ\n\nㄅ ㄧˋ ㄒㄧㄣˋ ㄅ ㄧˋ ㄓㄨㄥ\n\nㄧ ˋ ㄒㄧㄣ ㄧ ˋ ㄉ ㄜˊ\n\nㄍㄨㄢˋ ㄔ ㄜˋ ㄕ ˇ ㄓㄨㄥ\n\nOfficial\n\nSan Min Chu-i,\n\nOur aim shall be:\n\nTo found, a free land,\n\nWorld peace, be our stand.\n\nLead on, comrades,\n\nVanguards ye are.\n\nHold fast your aim,\n\nBy sun and star.\n\nBe earnest and brave,\n\nYour country to save,\n\nOne heart, one soul,\n\nOne mind, one goal.\n\nLiteral\n\nThree Principles of the People,\n\nThe fundament of our party.\n\nUsing this, we establish the Country for the People;\n\nUsing this, we advance into a state of total peace.\n\nOh, you, warriors,\n\nFor the people, be the vanguard.\n\nWithout resting day or night,\n\nFollow the Principles.\n\nSwear to be diligent; swear to be courageous.\n\nObliged to be trustworthy; obliged to be loyal.\n\nWith one heart and one virtue,\n\nWe carry through until the very end.\n\nInternet Page: www.president.gov.tw\n\nwww.cy.gov.tw\n\nwww.gio.gov.tw\n\nwww.english.www.gov.tw\n\nwww.taiwantourism.org\n\nTaiwan in diferent languages\n\neng | afr | bre | cat | cym | dan | dsb | est | eus | fin | fry | fur | hau | hsb | ibo | ina | ita | jav | jnf | lin | lld | nld | nor | oci | roh | ron | rup | scn | slk | sme | swa | swe | vor | wln: Taiwan\n\narg | ast | glg | spa | tet: Taiwán\n\ncsb | mlt | pol | szl: Tajwan\n\nbam | kin | run: Tayiwani\n\ncrh | kaa | uzb: Tayvan / Тайвань\n\ndeu | ltz | nds: Taiwan / Taiwan\n\nhrv | hun | slv: Tajvan\n\nind | msa: Taiwan / تايوان\n\nque | zza: Taywan\n\naze: Tayvan / Тајван\n\nbos: Tajvan / Тајван\n\nces: Tchajwan\n\nepo: Tajvano\n\nfao: Teivan\n\nfra: Taïwan\n\nfrp: Tayivan\n\ngla: Taiwan; Tai-Bhàn\n\ngle: An Téaváin / An Téaváin\n\nglv: Yn Taiwaan\n\nisl: Tævan\n\nkmr: Taywan / Т’айwан / تایوان\n\nkur: Taywan / تایوان\n\nlat: Taivania; Taevania; Formosa\n\nlav: Taivāna\n\nlit: Taivanas\n\nmlg: Taioana\n\nmol: Taiwan / Тайван\n\nnrm: Formôse; Tai’wai\n\npor: Taiwan; Taiuã\n\nrmy: Taiwan / ताइवान\n\nslo: Taivan / Таиван\n\nsmg: Taivans\n\nsqi: Tajvani\n\nsrd: Taiwàn\n\ntgl: Taywan; Taiwan\n\nton: Taiuani\n\ntuk: Taýwan / Тайвань\n\ntur: Tayvan\n\nvie: Đài Loan\n\nwol: Taaywaan\n\nabq | alt | che | chm | chv | kir | kjh | kom | krc | kum | oss | rus | tyv | udm | ukr: Тайвань (Tajvan')\n\nbul | kbd | mon: Тайван (Tajvan)\n\nbak | tat: Тайвань / Tayvan\n\nbel: Тайвань / Tajvań\n\nkaz: Тайвань / Tayvan / تايۆان\n\nmkd: Тајван (Tajvan)\n\nsrp: Тајван / Tajvan\n\ntgk: Тайван / تیون / Tajvan\n\nara: تايوان (Tāywān); تيوان (Taywān)\n\nfas: تایوان / Tâyvân\n\nprs: تایوان (Tāyvān)\n\npus: تايوان (Tāywān)\n\nuig: تەيۋەن / Teywen / Тәйвән\n\nurd: تائیوان (Tāʾīvān)\n\ndiv: ތައިވާން (Ta'ivān)\n\nheb: טיון (Ṭayvan); טיוואן / טייוואן (Ṭayvân); טאיוואן (Ṭâyvân)\n\nlad: טאייב'אן / Tayvan\n\nyid: טײַװאַן (Tayvan)\n\namh: ታይዋን (Taywan); ታይቫኝ (Tayvañ)\n\nell: Ταϊβάν (Taïván)\n\nhye: Թայվան (Ṭayvan)\n\nkat: ტაივანი (Taivani)\n\nhin: ताइवान (Tāivān); तायवान (Tāyvān); तैवन (Tævan); टाइवान (Ṭāivān)\n\nben: তাইওয়ান (Tāioyān)\n\npan: ਤਾਈਵਾਨ (Tāīvān)\n\nkan: ಟೈವಾನ್ (Ṭaivān)\n\nmal: തായ്വാന് (Tāyvān); തയ്വാന് (Tayvān)\n\ntam: தாய்வான் (Tāyvāṉ); தைவான் (Taivāṉ)\n\ntel: తైవాన్ (Taivān)\n\nzho: 臺灣/台湾 (Táiwān)\n\nyue: 臺灣/台湾 (Tòihwāan)\n\njpn: 台湾 (Taiwan)\n\nkor: 대만 (Daeman)\n\nbod: ཐའེ་ཝན་ (Tʰa'e.wan.); ཐེ་ཝན་ (Tʰe.wan.); ཐའི་དབན་ (Tʰa'i.dban.); ཐའི་ཝའན་ (Tʰa'i.w'an.)\n\ndzo: ཏའི་ཝཱན་ (Ta'i.wān.)\n\nmya: တုိင္ဝမ္ (Taĩwã)\n\ntha: ไต้หวัน (Tái[h]wân)\n\nlao: ໄຕ້ຫວັນ (Tái[h]wân)\n\nkhm: តៃវ៉ាន់ (Taivan)"
