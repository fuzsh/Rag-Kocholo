        "text": "In a message to the international community, he added: “Whoever engages in Taiwan independence activities on the island will be held accountable by history and whoever in the world connives at and supports Taiwan independence will get burned for playing with fire and taste the bitter fruit of their own actions.”\n\nBut he also stressed that Beijing still hoped for a peaceful reunification, saying: “Our policy is clear. We insist on striving for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity.\n\n“Our bottom line is also crystal clear: We will never allow Taiwan to be separated from the mainland.”\n\nBeijing sees the self-ruled island as part of China that must be reunited with the mainland – by force if necessary.\n\nMost countries, including the United States – the island’s informal ally and biggest arms supplier – do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state. But many still maintain strong unofficial ties with Taipei, while Washington and others are opposed to any change to the status quo by force.\n\nIn recent years, the mainland military has been steadily increasing the pressure on the island with a series of exercises around Taiwan and repeated sorties by warplanes into its air defence identification zone.\n\nThe result has been increasing international expressions of concern about the risk of conflict and multiple visits to the islands by politicians from the US, Europe and Japan.\n\nAlthough Wang did not refer directly to the US or other countries when discussing Taiwan, the comments highlight Beijing’s growing concern about international support for Taiwan.\n\nLast month two mainland fishermen died after their boat capsized while being chased by the Taiwanese coastguard near the island of Quemoy, also known as Kinmen, which lies just off the coast of the mainland province of Fujian.\n\nThe two sides blamed each other for the incident, putting cross-strait relations under further strain after January’s presidential election was won by the Democratic Progressive Party’s William Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has repeatedly denounced as a dangerous separatist and troublemaker.\n\nHe vowed to follow many of the policies of President Tsai Ing-wen and has adopted her formula that there is no need for Taiwan to declare formal independence because it is already a sovereign and independent country.\n\nLai will take office in May and his inaugural speech will be closely watched by Beijing as it looks for clues about what approach he will adopt over the next four years."
