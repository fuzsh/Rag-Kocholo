        "text": "JOHN YANG: The Taiwanese presidential election has big implications for both Beijing and Washington.\n\nPresident Elect Lai Ching-ti, also known as William, rejects Beijing's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nEarlier, Ali Rogin spoke with Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, the China reporter for Axios, who's based in Taiwan.\n\nALI ROGIN: What were the issues that Taiwanese voters were most concerned with?\n\nAnd what do those issues say about the fact that William Lai has won?\n\nBETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN, Axios: Well, Taiwanese voters in this election as with every presidential election were concerned about cross strait relations in Taiwan's presidential elections.\n\nThe relationship with China is always a key issue.\n\nAnd that was certainly the case this year.\n\nOver the past year or so the Chinese government has been increasingly aggressive in its coercive actions towards Taiwan.\n\nAnd so voters and the parties themselves made that a key issue.\n\nThe KMT cast this election as a choice between war and peace, a vote for the KMT as a vote for peace with China.\n\nThey said a vote for the DPP as a vote for war.\n\nWhereas the DPP cast this as an election that was a choice between democracy and authoritarianism, with a rising China, you know, a sort of specter of authoritarianism looming over Taiwan.\n\nBut those weren't the only issues.\n\nYou know, basically on the ballot this year, the economy, unemployment, and high home prices were also very much on voters' minds.\n\nNow, the fact that the DPP one part of that has to do with the fact that this year for the first time, there was a very significant third party on the ballot, that's the Taiwan People's Party and their candidate, Ko Wen-je and Ko Wen-je got more than 20 percent of the vote, which is unprecedented.\n\nNow he was pulling mostly from the KMT.\n\nSo if the TPP had not run, then it's possible we would have seen a KMT victory.\n\nWhat that says is that the KMT itself is not speaking to Taiwanese voters.\n\nThey still think that they still say that a close relationship with China is the best way to guarantee Taiwan security.\n\nMost Taiwanese voters or many Taiwanese voters just don't feel that that's true anymore.\n\nALI ROGIN: How markedly is this going to affect cross strait relations?\n\nBETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN: Well, at the end of the day, here are the facts.\n\nChina wants to unify with Taiwan, and Taiwan doesn't.\n\nAnd you know, regardless of how the voters in Taiwan vote, that's not going to change, which means there is going to inherently be some level of tension with China.\n\nBut what the voters were looking at is, you know, a continuation of the past eight years of DPP rule.\n\nNow, the DPP is a party that China has cast as a separatist or Independence Party.\n\nOkay.\n\nIn fact, when Tsai when was elected the current president in 2016, China cut off all a formal communications with Taiwan.\n\nAnd since then have steadily poached Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies.\n\nNow, Taiwan has just about 12 or 13 remaining countries that recognize it formally diplomatically.\n\nIf the KMT had won, it's possible that Beijing would have toned it down a little bit.\n\nBut what's true is that the KMT, their position isn't unification with China, the DPP's position isn't unification with China.\n\nAnd so even if the KMT had won, there would still be this kind of fundamental tension.\n\nALI ROGIN: What do we know so far about how China is reacting to William Lai's victory?\n\nBETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN: Well, what they've said this past week is that they will never compromise on their belief that China must unify with Taiwan.\n\nFrankly, they really hate William Lai.\n\nThey have branded him as a quote separatist through and through.\n\nNow, what we're expecting is certainly a very strong verbal denunciation from Beijing of the results of today's election.\n\nAnalysts tell me that we are not expecting at least not right now.\n\nWe're not expecting massive military drills like we saw after Nancy Pelosi visited in 2022.\n\nOne reason for that is that the legislature is how it's going to kind of how the pieces will fall isn't quite set.\n\nNow, the DPP did not gain a majority, but neither the KMT the TPP has a significant chunk of the party vote that will give it seats in the legislature.\n\nThat means the DPP and the KMT are going to be vying for the TPP support.\n\nAnd in this kind of mix, it's likely that Beijing does not want to so frightened Taiwan's residents, that they -- that there's an outpouring of support for a DPP, TPP kind of partnership in the legislature.\n\nALI ROGIN: I also want to ask you about what this means for the U.S.-China relationship, does it have repercussions?\n\nBETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN: Certainly, the U.S. is a very important player in this nexus here this, you know, China-Taiwan, U.S. nexus.\n\nThe U.S. is Taiwan's most important partner and the its strongest defender, even though the U.S. does not have official relations with Taiwan.\n\nNow, in the past week, there was a Chinese official delegation to the U.S., and there were high level meetings between top Chinese diplomats and Biden administration officials.\n\nAnd it's likely that what was one of the key topics of conversation on both sides this week was, how are we going to maintain this very delicate stability that we have attained in the U.S.-China relationship over the past few months, regardless of what happens in Taiwan.\n\nBecause, you know, here's, here's what's at stake.\n\nThis could easily escalate, as you know, the China-Taiwan issue is one of the most dangerous flashpoints in the Indo Pacific region.\n\nAnd so we are watching this very carefully to see if what's happened today in Taiwan does throw off that balance between the U.S. and China.\n\nALI ROGIN: Bethany Allen Ebrahimian, thank you so much for joining us and breaking this all down for us.\n\nBETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN: Thanks for having me."
