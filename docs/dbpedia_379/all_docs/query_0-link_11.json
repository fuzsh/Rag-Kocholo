Because reign years and Western years do not begin at quite the same time, some correspondences can be off slightly (as in other sources). For western dates, the year is in some cases followed by the month or the month and day, given as pseudo-decimal values following the year. For example, 1895.0417 means April 17, 1895. (You know what happened on that day, right? If not, check it out.)\n\nA more detailed table of events involved with collapse of the MÃ­ng and the rise of the QÄ«ng covers palace intrigues and other mainland events important to that change, but not directly part of the TÃ¡iwÄn story covered here.
