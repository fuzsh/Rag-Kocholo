Although the vast majority of the population is ethnically Han Chinese, the indigenous Austronesian inhabitants maintain their own cultures, and the legacy of Japanese colonial rule still pervades much of Taiwanese life.\n\nJapanese, Hongkongers and Southeast Asians enjoy taking short trips to Taiwan to enjoy its neighborly hospitality. Taiwan is home to some well-known international companies such as Acer, MSI, Asus, HTC, TSMC and Giant Bicycles, whose technologies are some of the most advanced in the world.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indigenous Taiwanese culture, Imperial China, Chinese Revolutions, Japanese colonial empire, Pacific War\n\nTaiwan was first populated 30,000 years ago by an Australo-Melanesian group known as the Negrito. The Negrito were eventually assimilated and displaced 5,000 years ago by Proto-Austronesians who arrived from the east coast of mainland China, predominantly from what is now Fujian province. It has been suggested that these people were the ancestors of Austronesian speakers across Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and even Madagascar. Recorded history began with the partial colonization of Taiwan by the Dutch and then the Portuguese in the early 17th century. (The old name of Taiwan, Formosa, comes from the Portuguese Ilha Formosa for \"beautiful island\".) Many Taiwanese consider the beginning of Dutch colonial rule in 1624 to be the birth of the Taiwanese nation.\n\nHan Chinese immigrants arrived in significant numbers with the onset of European trade. The Ming loyalist Koxinga defeated the Dutch garrisons and set up Taiwan as a rump Ming Empire with the hope of reconquering Qing China. His grandson surrendered to the Qing in the late 1600s. Although contact between China and Taiwan dates back thousands of years, it was not until larger numbers of ethnic Han residents arrived during the Qing dynasty that Taiwan was integrated into China as part of Hokkien (Fujian) province. It became a separate province in 1887. The years of Han Chinese settlement during the Qing Dynasty were marred by conflict between the Han settlers and the indigenous people, between the Minnan and Hakka speakers among the Han settlers, and between the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou immigrants among the Minnan speakers. All these resulted in Minnan speakers largely occupying the fertile lowlands along the coast, the Hakkas being forced to occupy the middle elevations in the mountains, and the indigenous people being forced to higher elevations in the mountains and the more typhoon-prone east coast.\n\nDefeated by the Japanese, the Qing Empire ceded Taiwan to Japan under the terms of the treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. Japan ruled the island until the end of World War II in 1945, and exerted profound influences on its development. The island's entertainment and pop culture was and still is heavily influenced by that of Japan. Much of the infrastructure built by the Japanese can still be seen on the island, and has been in continuous use up to the present day (e.g. railway crossing gates, administrative buildings, and the old port at Kaohsiung). During World War II, many Taiwanese, both indigenous and Han Chinese, served in the Imperial Japanese Army, many of whom have been enshrined in the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. Like their counterparts in Korea and other occupied territories, many Taiwanese women were forced to serve as \"comfort women\" (i.e. sex slaves) in Japanese military brothels.\n\nUpon the resumption of Chinese rule, the Kuomintang (KMT, 國民黨) under Chiang Kai-shek, also known as the Nationalists, was suspicious of the locals in Taiwan, because many Taiwanese had served in the Japanese military and civil service during World War II. Moreover, the Japanese had sought to turn Taiwan into a model colony. Despite having been discriminated against, many locals had seen their standards of living improve under Japanese rule, and were disillusioned by the corruption and incompetence that plagued the Kuomintang at that time. Tensions between the new Kuomintang government and the locals culminated in the 228 incident on 28th February 1947, when many locals revolted against Chinese rule, and the Kuomintang responded with a brutal crackdown, massacring thousands of pro-independence protesters and Japanese-educated intellectuals. Taiwan was placed under martial law following the incident, which was not lifted until 1987. Discussion of the incident was banned under the years of martial law, but was brought back to the fore once again following democratization in the 1990s, and it remains a key impetus behind the Taiwan independence movement.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Nationalists and Communists fought a bloody civil war in mainland China. Although the two sides briefly united against Japan during World War II, they quickly began fighting again after the war was over. The Communists emerged victorious in 1949. The Nationalist government, remnants of their army, and hundreds of thousands of supporters then fled to Taiwan, but also retained control of several offshore islands of Fujian. From Taipei, they continued to assert their right as the sole legitimate government of all China. Initially very repressive, the government began to loosen control in its fourth decade under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan also experienced rapid economic growth and modernisation under the leadership of Chiang Ching-kuo, becoming one of the world's richest and most modern economies and earning it a place as one of the East Asian Tigers. Today, Taiwan is generally regarded as a modern, developed economy, and still remains a leader in consumer electronics that is home to well-known computer brands. Democratization began in earnest through the 1980s and 1990s, culminating with the first direct presidential elections in 1996, and the first peaceful transition of power between two political parties in 2000.\n\nTaiwanese politics remain dominated by the issue of relations between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC), which still claims Taiwan as a \"renegade province\" and regularly threatens military action if Taiwan attempts to break away from the awkward One China status quo, whereby both sides agree that there is only one Chinese nation, but disagree on whether that one nation should be governed by the PRC or the Republic of China (ROC). To summarize a very complex situation, the Pan-Blue (泛藍) group spearheaded by the KMT supports eventual unification with the mainland when the political climate is right, while the Pan-Green (泛綠) group led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supports eventual formal independence under the name \"Republic of Taiwan\".\n\nAlthough mainland China has been Taiwan's most important trading partner since 2008, many Taiwanese were fearful that deepening economic ties would lead to the Chinese Communist Party using this economic dependence to coerce democratic Taiwan into unifying with mainland China under communist rule. Things came to a head when student protesters stormed the Legislative Yuan on 18th March 2014, forcing the government to abandon ratification of a trade deal with mainland China, marking the first time the Taiwanese legislature had been occupied by civilian protesters. The protests, popularly known as the Sunflower Movement, are today considered a watershed moment in Taiwanese political history, as they led to the political awakening of much of the formerly apolitical younger generation, galvanized a distinct Taiwanese identity, and united most of the younger generation behind the pro-independence camp.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan is a presidential republic modelled after the American system of government. The President is popularly elected every four years for up to two terms, and is the head of state. The President has the sole authority to appoint members the executive branch, known as the Executive Yuan, whose leader, known as the Premier, serves as the head of government.\n\nThe legislative branch is known as the Legislative Yuan, often referred to as the \"Parliament\", which is elected every four years in parallel with the presidential elections. Taiwan is a vibrant democracy known for its exceptionally dramatic parliamentary sessions, with physical fights between legislators on the floor being a regular occurrence.\n\nThe other branches of government are the Judicial Yuan, which leads the judiciary branch, the Examination Yuan, which administers civil service examinations, and the Control Yuan, which is responsible for auditing the government's finances.\n\nThe two main parties in Taiwanese politics are the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Generally speaking, the KMT is more socially conservative but economically left-leaning, and favors friendlier ties with China, while the DPP is more socially liberal but economically right-leaning, and favors closer ties with Japan and the United States, as well as taking a tougher stance against China. While the older generation is politically split, the younger generation is overwhelmingly pro-DPP.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan was first populated by indigenous peoples (原住民 yuán zhù mín) that spoke various Austronesian languages, which are related to Malay, Tagalog, Indonesian and most languages of the Pacific island nations. Today the remaining indigenous peoples make up only about 2% of the population, while the other 98% are considered ethnically Han Chinese. The Han Chinese are further split into Taiwanese (本省人 běn shěng rén), who make up about 84% of the population and whose ancestors migrated to Taiwan during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and mainlanders (外省人 wài shěng rén), who make up about 14% of the population and whose families fled to Taiwan from the mainland after the communist takeover of China in 1949. Among the Taiwanese group, Hoklo (Minnan) speakers form the majority, which is about 70% of the population, while the remaining 14% are largely Hakka speakers.\n\nIn modern times, Taiwan is also home to immigrants from elsewhere, especially other Asian countries such as Malaysia (most of whom are ethnically Chinese), Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia. The post-1949 Chinese immigrants come from every province and include many non-Han residents.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwanese culture is largely based on traditional Chinese culture, particularly that of Fujian province, because most Taiwanese are Han Chinese whose ancestors migrated to Taiwan from that region. However, in the 20th century, Taiwanese culture diverged from that of mainland China. Substantial Japanese influences can be seen in modern Taiwanese culture because of 50 years of Japanese rule, and this can be seen in its cuisine and in its pop culture. Kuomintang refugees fleeing the mainland in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War also brought their cultures with them, and their influence is most visible in Taiwan's cuisine. In addition, the Japanese introduced baseball and hot-spring bathing to Taiwan, and these remain popular pastimes for the Taiwanese to this day. As Taiwan was spared from the Cultural Revolution, the Taiwanese have also retained some elements of traditional Chinese culture that have been lost in mainland China.\n\nIndigenous Austronesian or \"Formosan\" culture has greatly suffered under multiple different waves of colonial rule. It is having a resurgence today, efforts are being made to revive the culture through the introduction of the Formosan languages into the school curriculum. However, many aspects of it have been lost forever which is evident in how the majority of the Formosan languages are extinct or moribund. Numerous indigenous Taiwanese have had successful careers in the entertainment industry, perhaps the most famous example being the singer Kulilay Amit, better known by her Chinese name Chang Huei-mei, who is of Puyuma ethnicity. The indigenous people of Taiwan are separated into Lowland groups who lived on the plains and Highland groups who lived in the mountains. The Lowland groups were the first to come in contact with the Dutch while the Highland groups were only truly subjugated by the Japanese. The Lowland groups receive limited indigenous recognition today due to having largely culturally assimilated into the Han Chinese, and suspicion from Highland groups on whether they truly qualify as \"indigenous\".\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nLowland Taiwan has a marine tropical climate during the summer, with sweltering, humid weather (above 30 °C, 86 °F) from Jun-Sep. In the winter the weather is influenced by the nearby continent, and in the northern areas the temperature can go as low as 8 °C at night. The best time of year to visit is from Oct-Dec, although even then occasional typhoons can spoil the fun. Spring is also nice, although it rains more than during autumn. During the typhoon season, the east coast bears the brunt of the damage as it is facing the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn the mountainous regions you will encounter more temperate conditions. Rapid weather change can endanger unprepared visitors, so advice on proper preparation should be obtained before visiting those areas. In fact, it snows every year on Taiwan's highest mountains and occasionally even on mountains like Alishan.\n\nTaiwanese calendar\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Minguo (民國, ROC) calendar, counting years from the establishment of the ROC (1911), is commonly used in Taiwan. To convert a Minguo date to A.D., just add 1911. 2024 is Minguo 113. Months and days are according to the standard Gregorian calendar for almost everything except traditional holidays and religious matters, which use the traditional Chinese lunar calendar.\n\nFestivals\n\n[edit]\n\nLunar New Year dates\n\nThe year of the Dragon began on 4 Feb 2024 at 16:25, and the Lunar New Year was on 10 Feb 2024\n\nThe year of the Snake will begin on 3 Feb 2025 at 22:10, and the Lunar New Year will be on 29 January 2025\n\nThe year of the Horse will begin on 4 Feb 2026 at 4:02, and the Lunar New Year will be on 17 Feb 2026\n\nContrary to popular belief, the change of the zodiac does not occur on the first day of the Lunar New Year, but instead occurs on Li Chun (立春 lì chūn), the traditional Chinese start of spring.\n\nAs Taiwan is majority Han Chinese, traditional Chinese festivals are celebrated in Taiwan. Among the most notable are:\n\nChinese New Year (春節). This is the most important festival for the Taiwanese and many shops and restaurants close on the first three days so it is not an ideal time to visit. However, the days leading up to the festival and the fourth to fifteenth days are ideal for soaking up the atmosphere and listening to Chinese New Year songs.\n\nTomb Sweeping Day (Ching Ming Festival, 清明節). This is when many Taiwanese pay respects at their ancestors' graves.\n\nDragon Boat Festival (端午節). This festival honors Qu Yuan, a patriotic official from the state of Chu during the Warring States period of Chinese history who committed suicide by jumping into a river when Chu was conquered by Qin. To prevent the fishes from eating his body, villagers threw rice dumplings into the river to feed the fishes and rowed dragon boats with drums being beaten on them to scare away the fishes. Since then, dragon boat racing has been carried out on this day and rice dumplings are also eaten.\n\nHungry Ghost Festival (Ghost Month, 中元節). This festival runs throughout the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. It is believed that the gates of hell open during this period and hungry ghosts are allowed to roam freely into our world. In order to appease the ghosts and prevent misfortune, many Taiwanese offer food and burn joss paper for them. In addition, traditional Chinese performances such as Chinese opera and puppet shows are held to appease these wandering spirits.\n\nMid-Autumn Festival (Moon Festival, 中秋節). Legend has it that on this day, a woman known as Chang E swallowed some divine pills to prevent her power hungry husband from becoming immortal. Afraid of being killed by her husband, she fled to the moon and it is believed that the moon shines brightest on this day. This is when many lanterns are put up for decoration in various parks and shops, which is quite a beautiful sight. Mooncakes are also eaten on this day so it would be an ideal time to try some. Many Taiwanese have barbecue with family or friends as part of the celebration.\n\nTerrain\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan is largely mountainous with a chain of mountains running from north to south at the center of the island. The west coast is largely plains and unsurprisingly is where most of the population is concentrated, and is where all the larger cities like Taichung and Kaohsiung are located. The east coast also has some plains but they are more sparsely populated due to the higher typhoon risk, but is also home to the cities of Hualien and Taitung with significant populations.\n\nVisitor information\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan Tourism\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan's official languages are four varieties of Chinese — Mandarin, Taiwanese (a dialect of Minnan), Hakka, and Matsu dialect — as well as the indigenous Austronesian languages.\n\nMandarin is the lingua franca, but Taiwanese is the mother tongue of about 70% of the population. In the North where there is a large concentration of so-called \"mainlanders\" (those whose families came to Taiwan from mainland China in the 1940s as refugees of the Chinese Civil War), most people speak Mandarin as their primary language (although Taiwanese is spoken in abundance), but in the South of the island, Taiwanese is far more common. Hakka is the main language at the middle elevations of the mountainous parts of Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli. Mandarin, Taiwanese and Hakka are all tonal languages, and are difficult for most foreigners to master. Indigenous languages can mostly be heard on the East Coast and its offshore islands, as well as at higher elevations in the mountains. The Matsu dialect is a variant of the Fuzhou dialect (also known as Hokchiu or Foochow), and is almost exclusively concentrated in the Matsu islands located close to Fuzhou in mainland China.\n\nChinese is written using Chinese characters (漢字, hànzì, lit. \"Han characters\"). Unlike an alphabet that represents individual sounds without any inherent meaning, each Chinese character represents a meaningful syllable: a specific word or part of a word. Although they look impenetrable at first, there is some method to the madness: most characters are composed from base components combined with other characters (often giving clues to both pronunciation and general meaning). The same characters are used in Japan and Korea with usually similar meanings, albeit different pronunciations. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and many overseas Chinese still use the traditional characters, whereas since the 1950s mainland China has used simplified characters, such as 龟 instead of 龜. Cursive forms of Chinese characters, often used for effect in logos, range from \"looks familiar if you squint\" to \"impenetrable scribbles\".\n\nThere are multiple ways of romanizing Mandarin Chinese, but pinyin (漢語拼音 hànyǔ pīnyīn) is the most useful for a visitor to learn. It's a fairly logical system, although it has a few idiosyncrasies, including using some letters in ways that are different from English (such as q which is similar to English \"ch\" and x which is like English \"sh\"). (However, people in Taiwan are more familiar with a phonetic alphabet called Zhuyin (注音 zhùyīn, written using Zhuyin as ㄓㄨˋ ㄧㄣ), commonly known in English as bopomofo (named after the first four letters, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ), which is used for language education and typing.) All dialects of Chinese are also tonal, meaning each syllable has to be pronounced with the correct tone — high, rising, falling-rising, falling, or neutral — to be understood; Mandarin tones are marked in pinyin using diacritics that graphically mimic the tones patterns (as in mā, má, mǎ, mà, and ma). With just a few hours of practice, you can learn to pronounce Mandarin words accurately using pinyin. However, as Chinese has many homophones, pinyin is useful for pronunciation but not practical for communicating meaning; for something like a street address, you need to use Chinese characters.\n\nAlthough Chinese is written nearly the same around the world, spoken Chinese has a huge array of dialects. Verbally, Chinese dialects are as different from each other as English and Dutch, or French and Italian — related, but not mutually intelligible. Two people who speak different Chinese dialects would read and write the same, but they would pronounce the written text differently, and couldn't carry on a spoken conversation with each other.\n\nAlthough standard Mandarin in Taiwan is nearly identical to standard Mandarin in mainland China (with differences mostly in technical and translated terms invented post-1949), most people in practice speak a distinctly accented version known as Taiwanese Mandarin. For example, Taiwanese Mandarin tends to not differentiate between the \"S\" and \"Sh\" or the \"f\" and \"h\" sounds in Mandarin. All people schooled after 1945 are generally fluent in Mandarin, though older people from rural areas often have a very thick accent. Mandarin is fairly popular with young people. Some elderly people do not speak Mandarin as they were schooled in Japanese or not at all. Most Taiwanese are very accepting of foreigners and react with curiosity and admiration for trying the local tongue. Generally, most people in Taiwan converse using a combination of Mandarin and Taiwanese by code-switching.\n\nThe Taiwanese dialect is a variant of Minnan which is similar to the dialect spoken across the Taiwan Strait in South Fujian. Unlike in South Fujian, Taiwanese Minnan has some loan words from Japanese as a result of 50 years of Japanese colonization. Taiwanese Minnan and Xiamen Minnan are both mixtures of the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou accents, so as a result, Taiwanese Minnan sounds very similar to Xiamen Minnan. There is also dialectal variation in Taiwanese between different parts of the island; the Tainan dialect is generally considered to be the prestige dialect. An increasing number of pro-independence Taiwanese are opting to speak Taiwanese exclusively and shun Mandarin as a political statement, though they completely understand if foreigners are not able to speak Taiwanese.\n\nAll public announcements in the transportation system are made in Mandarin, Taiwanese and Hakka, with the exception of the Matsu islands, where announcements are made in Mandarin and the local Matsu dialect.\n\nEspecially in Taipei, younger people generally speak a basic conversational level of English. The children often understand more English than their parents, especially with the emphasis on English language education today, and English being a compulsory subject in Taiwanese schools. However, attempts to speak Mandarin or Taiwanese will be met with beaming smiles and encouragement, by and large.\n\nQuite a few people, especially in Taipei, are proficient in Japanese due to the high number of Japanese visitors and the history of colonial rule. Staff at tourist attractions such as the Taipei 101, museums, hotels, popular restaurants and airport shops speak Japanese in addition to English, Mandarin and other local languages. In fact, if you are a visitor of East Asian descent who cannot understand Chinese, a worker may try speaking to you in Japanese before trying English.\n\nThere has been an increasing usage of Korean by tourism boards due to the large number of Korean people visiting Taiwan. Thus, there are many signs across Taiwan written in Korean. An enthusiasm for Korean-language education due to the influence of Korean pop culture is also gaining momentum.\n\nDue to the increasing number of Southeast Asian tourists visiting Taiwan, Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian are spoken by some staff at tourist attractions.\n\nTaiwan Sign Language is the language of the deaf community. It has partial mutual intelligibility with Japanese Sign Language and Korean Sign Language, but not with Chinese Sign Language or Hong Kong Sign Language.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nIC Cards\n\n[edit]\n\nTaipei's EasyCard (悠遊卡 Yōuyóukǎ) and Kaohsiung's iPass (一卡通) are the main public transportation smart and electronic payment cards, and replace the need to buy separate tickets for most national, regional and city buses, metro (MRT), as well as train services (TRA) all over Taiwan, and they can be used at retail establishments that display the respective sign, like convenient stores (7eleven, Family Mart), parking lots and some restaurants and shops. Though originally accepted only in their respective cities, the two cards can now be used interchangeably at most (but not all) locations.\n\nBesides saving you the hassle of having proper change ready for your ticket, it mostly always gives discount on the chosen journeys. For instance, the price for any train (TRA) is calculated based on the price of a local train and a 10% discount. Thus, you can even take the faster trains with it (but not THSR) like the Tzu-Chiang limited express. The only disadvantage is that you will not have a reserved seat, which however is not an issue except on Saturday morning/noon and Sunday afternoon. The EasyCard also provides discounts on Taipei's public transportation network, and likewise with the iPass on Kaohsiung's network.\n\nThe EasyCard can be bought at the airport, in any of stations of Taipei MRT and most convenient stores. As of Dec 2019 the price was NT$500, consisting of a non-refundable deposit of NT$100 and NT$400 in electronic cash. If you want to add money onto the card, you can do so in MRT stations (including Kaohsiung MRT), TRA stations, and the common convenient stores. The card can hold amounts up to NT$5,000. Student IC cards with even deeper discounts are also available for purchase, but only upon request at a desk and a recognised student ID like ISIC.\n\nWhether the card needs to be tapped only once or twice on city buses (on entry or on exit, see below) depends on which city you are in and sometimes how far you travel. Do not forget to tap twice (on entry and exit) where it is necessary, especially on regional and national buses outside of cities (and some unstaffed railway stations). Otherwise, your card will be blocked with \"incomplete journey\" (for all bus companies), and you will have to settle this issue with the responsible bus company. This can be a problem, because bus companies only serve certain regions. When leaving that region, e.g. by train, which is still possible with a (bus) locked card, no-one will be willing to unlock your card, even though also other bus companies are able to do so. Be insistent and with the help of the tourist information center tell them that you cannot go back to fix the problem, or that you tried and they did not solve the issue even though they told you so. Make sure that it is really unlocked (with a different bus company) and do not just trust them – it seems some cannot operate their machines properly. If you forget to tap the second time, you will only be charged a small initial fee instead of the whole journey, but unless you are at the end of your vacation to Taiwan or possess a second card, you should avoid having your card blocked. That said, most bus drivers and railway staff pay close attention to the tapping, so it is hard to miss.\n\nIt costs NT$14 to get in and out of the same railway station within an hour, in case you instead decide to take the bus. At the end of your travel, do not put too much money onto your card, because it can only be given back and cashed-out at certain locations, like some THSR stations. In addition to the NT$100 purchase fee, there is a NT$20 fee for returning the card within 3 months.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan's train system is excellent, with stops in all major cities. Train stations are often in the centers of most cities and towns and serve as a convenient hub for most types of transportation. In addition, the train system allows you to bypass the highways, which can become extremely crowded on weekends and national holidays. The main downside is the lack of cross-island routes between the East Coast and West Coast; for instance, there is no rail line from Taichung to Hualien, so you will have to either drive, fly, or take a major detour via Taipei or Kaohsiung.\n\nTHSR\n\n[edit]\n\nThe new train backbone is Taiwan High Speed Rail (HSR, 高鐵 gāotiě) , a high speed train based on Japanese Shinkansen technology that covers the 345 km (214 mi) route on the West Coast from Taipei to Zuoying (Kaohsiung) in 90 min. Other stops on the route are Banqiao, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan, but many THSR stations have been built a fair distance from the cities they serve (e.g. a taxi from downtown Tainan costs up to NT$400, but there's a free shuttle bus). Taipei, Banciao, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung (Zuoying) stations are connected with metro. Taichung station is built next to a railway station, convenient to transfer to the city center. Hsinchu and Tainan stations are connected to the city center with branch railway lines. Other stations can only be reached by bus. A one way ticket from Taipei to Kaohsiung costs NT$1,630 in economy or NT$2,140 in business class, but economy seats have plush seats and ample legroom, so there's little reason to pay extra, though business class passengers are offered a complementary drink and snack. All signage and announcements are in English as well, making navigation a snap. Bookings are accepted online and via phone up to two weeks in advance at +886-2-6626-8000 (English spoken), with payment required only when you pick up the tickets. Credit cards are accepted.\n\nBookings can be easily made by internet, and you can pay online or pay and pick up your tickets at almost every FamilyMart and 7-Eleven. You can also avoid the queues for long distance tickets at major stations by buying your tickets from the automated ticket machines. The English prompts on the automated machines are hard to spot but they are present, usually in the top left corner of the screen. The stations and platforms are wheelchair-friendly and all trains include a wheelchair-accessible car (wider doors, ample space, accessible bathroom). The Official English guide for online reservations distinguishes between \"senior or disabled tickets\" and \"handicap-friendly seats\"; while it's possible to buy a ticket for the former online (\"correct passenger ID\" required), a ticket for the latter has to be reserved by calling the ticketing office on the phone. Early Bird tickets are sold from 28 days before the day, and the discount to is up to 35% off.\n\nAll high-speed trains consist of two seating classes; economy class and business class. Although economy class is already clean and comfortable by international standards, paying extra for business class snags you a slightly wider seat, as well as a complimentary drink and snack.\n\nAll train announcements are made in Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka and English.\n\nPasses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Taiwan High Speed Rail issues a THSR Pass for use on the high speed rail trains. These cost NT$2,400 for a regular 3-day pass, or NT$3,200 for a flexible 3-day pass. While a regular 3-day pass must be used in 3 consecutive days, the 3 days in a flexible 3-day pass may be spread out over any 7-day period. The 5-day joint passes allow for unlimited rides on the high speed rail for 2 days within a 5 day period, and unlimited rides on TRA lines within the same 5-day period. These cost NT$2,800 for a standard pass, which does not allow you to ride on Tzu-Chiang trains, and NT$3,600 for an express pass, which allows you to ride on all TRA lines. The THSR passes may only be used by foreigners who are in Taiwan on tourist visas (or visa exemptions), and must be purchased from travel agents overseas before you arrive in Taiwan.\n\nTRA\n\n[edit]\n\nMainline trains are run by the separate Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA, 台鐵) , whose services are generally efficient and reliable. Reserving tickets well in advance is recommended when traveling with the train on weekends, especially for long distance travel. Slower (but more frequent) commuter trains without reserved seating are also available. Train timetables and online booking (up to 2 weeks in advance) are available on the TRA website. Booking and payment can be made online. You can also pay for the tickets you reserved at your local train station or post office to actually receive it. You can also buy the tickets of TRA in convenient stores now (you can reserve first and take the tickets in convenient stores). The way to buy tickets is same to high speed rail's. Children under 115 cm (45 in) height go free, and taller kids shorter than 150 cm (59 in) and under 12 years of age get half-price tickets. If you get return tickets there is a small discount depending upon travel distance. There are also vending machines at the larger stations.\n\nThe fastest train is Tzu-Chiang (limited express), and the slowest is Local. There is often little to choose between prices and destination times for adjacent train classes, but the gap can be quite large between the fastest and the slowest.\n\nTze-Chiang (自強 zìqiáng): The fastest (and most expensive). Assigned seating. Non-reserved (standing) tickets are supposedly sold at full price, but the boarding is possible with an Easycard for local train prices. There are Taroko Express (太魯閣號 Tàilǔgé Hào) and Puyuma (普悠瑪號 Pǔyōumǎ Hào) running from Taipei to Hualien, which only sell reserved tickets.\n\nChu-Kuang (莒光 júguāng): Second fastest. Assigned seating. In western Taiwan, it is as slow as a local train; in eastern Taiwan, it is still a fast, convenient train.\n\nLocal Express (區間快 qūjiān): Short to medium distance commuter train which skip some stations. No assigned seating.\n\nLocal Train (區間 qūjiān) : Short to medium distance commuter train, stops at all stations. No assigned seating.\n\nOnly on Saturday morning/noon and Sunday afternoon faster trains are packed, and it might make sense to buy a more expensive reserve-seat ticket, if you do not want to stand for 3 hr, depending on your destination. Otherwise, you can freely use the EasyCard for fast connections without worrying (except for THSR).\n\nFor travel to nearby cities, you can travel on local commuter trains. These arrive very frequently (about once every ten to fifteen minutes). In addition, \"standing tickets\" may be purchased on trains with assigned seating that have no available seats. Standing tickets are 80% the original ticket price and may be useful for last-minute travelers. However, you will be required to stand for the duration of your trip if there are no free seats.\n\nStation announcements are made in Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, and English.\n\nA popular holdover from the Japanese colonial era is the railway bento tradition, known in Taiwan as the Taiwan Railway Bento (臺鐵便當 tái tiě biàn dàng). These are sold at most major TRA stations, and on board most long distance TRA trains. Both meat and vegetarian options are available, with the pork chop bento being particularly famous and iconic. Some smaller towns that do not have TRA bento stalls at in their stations have privately-owned shops selling bentos near to the railway station, and these often feature some local specialties. The towns of Fulong and Chishang are particularly famous for their local versions of the railway bento.\n\nPasses\n\n[edit]\n\nSimilar to Japan and South Korea, Taiwan also offers several rail passes to foreign tourists for unlimited train travel within a stipulated period. The TR Pass can be used by foreigners for unlimited travel on TRA lines for a stipulated period of time. The TR Pass can be bought at railway stations in Taiwan. The TR pass also allows you to reserve seats for free on trains that have assigned seating. The TR pass is not valid on the Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) as those trains are not operated by the TRA.\n\nTicket types/prices (NT$) 3 Days 5 Days full pricereduced price4-person-groupfull pricereduced price4-person-group 18009004200250012507000\n\nThe 4-person-group ticket must be used by four people simultaneously. Validity has to be for consecutive days. Reduced price applies to children (age 7-12), senior citizens (age 65+) and disabled people.\n\nTR Pass Student: The student version of the TR Pass is significantly cheaper than the general version, though unlike the general version, it is not valid for use on Tzu-Chiang limited express trains, and also cannot be used to ride in train cars with reserved seating. In order to qualify for this pass, you will need to show your passport and a valid International Student Identity Card (ISIC)\n\nTicket types and prices:\n\n5-day ticket: NT$599\n\n7-day ticket: NT$799\n\n10-day ticket: NT$1,098\n\nAlishan Forest Railway\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alishan Forest Railway is an 86 km narrow gauge railway running from Chiayi to Alishan, with branch lines running from Alishan to Chushan and Shihou. Originally build by the Japanese for logging in 1912, it is today operated as a heritage railway for tourists, taking about 3 1/2 hours to get from Chiayi to Alishan and 4 1/2 hours for the return journey. One of the intermediate stations, Fenqihu, is famous for its local version of the railway bento.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan has an extensive bus network, run mostly by private bus companies. Traveling by bus is generally cheaper than by train, especially for long-distance trips. However, on holidays, travel time may be much longer and tickets are more likely to be sold out. There are two categories: intercity buses (客運) and local buses (公車).\n\nTaiwan Tourist Shuttle is a set of distinctly branded bus routes (some intercity, some local) that serve tourist sites, and are generally easier to use than regular routes. The official website offers route maps, timetables and recommended itineraries, but is somewhat confusing to navigate. There is, however, a toll-free number for inquiries. There are also information desks at major transport hubs.\n\nMany cities have local buses. They are managed by local governments, therefore information can generally be found on the websites of the respective transportation bureaus. Drivers are usually happy to help, but may not speak English or any other foreign language. Route maps at bus stops are mostly in Chinese. For visitors, it may be helpful to have your hotel or accommodation host suggest some routes for you and circle your destination on a map, then show it to the bus driver to make sure you're on the right bus. Announcements are in English, but hopefully the driver will remember to tell you when to get off in case you miss it. Most buses accept either cash (no change) or IC cards (like the EasyCard). Minor cities and towns do not have local buses, but have intercity routes that make frequent stops. These can be found using the method in the previous paragraph.\n\nOccasionally a bus driver might stop a bus away from the curb at a bus stop. Sometimes it is due to a vehicle illegally parked at a bus stop. (Taiwanese traffic law and regulation prohibit vehicles from stopping or parking within 10 m (33 ft) of a bus stop.) However, a bus driver might stop a bus away from the curb just because he or she does not want to wait for overtaking traffic while leaving a bus stop. Therefore, be much more careful when getting on or off a bus stopped away from a curb, as many motorcycles, motor scooters, and bicycles will definitely be tempted to overtake on the right side of the stopped bus where people get on and off! (As traffic drives on the right side of the road in Taiwan, buses have doors on the right side.) In Taiwan you need to hail the bus you are taking as you see it coming—much like hailing a taxi. The terminal stop of the route is listed on the front of the bus in Chinese and sometimes English, so it is important to make sure the bus you get on is going the right direction.\n\nFor city buses, sometimes you pay when boarding, sometimes when alighting, sometimes both (whether with cash or an IC card). As you get on the bus there will be an LED sign indicating that, opposite the entrance. Sometimes it's only in Chinese: 上 means on boarding, 下 means on alighting (or just watch other people). In some cities such as Kaohsiung and Taichung, failing to swipe your card correctly will result in a locked card.\n\nNavigation\n\n[edit]\n\nGoogle Maps is a quick way to find a route to your destination, but is not always reliable, especially for trips with changes and for longer distance (like in the south and southwest). Often it will highly overstate bus travel times, because it will consider each stop while the bus might only stop at every third or fourth. Hence, a trip from Kaohsiung or Pingtung to Kenting will be stated with 3-4 hr, even though it will just take 1 hr. Therefore, it will also often suggesting the wrong connections and transfers. However, it gives a very good indication on the possible route, vehicle number(s), frequency, availability and price of buses and trains.\n\nBesides, the Bus+ app (Android/iOS) is quite reliable with schedules. You can find bus numbers on it, and it will list its (live) route. This is much easier than reading the Chinese bus stop signs. In combination with Google Maps route search it is quite handy.\n\nFurthermore, http://taiwanbus.tw/%5Bdead+link%5D has a likewise good overview, in case the Bus+ app is not that helpful.\n\nBy metro\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following areas are served by metro, also known as MRT:\n\nTaipei and New Taipei by Taipei Metro\n\nLinkou Plateau, western Taipei and northeastern Taoyuan City by Taoyuan Metro\n\nTaichung by Taichung MRT\n\nKaohsiung by Kaohsiung MRT\n\nIt is prohibited to eat, drink or smoke in all metro systems past the fare gates. If multiple journeys are to be made, one can purchase a rechargeable IC card. There are 4 cards: EasyCard (悠遊卡), iPASS (一卡通), icash and HappyCash. For basic MRT transport purposes there is little difference between them.\n\nAll metro systems are reliable, safe, clean and accessible. Disruptions are rare. The Taipei Metro in particular is widely lauded as one of the world's most reliable and efficient, and is often held up as a gold standard for other Metro systems around the world to emulate. Nearly all stations have toilets, elevators and info desks. There are also special waiting areas that is monitored by security camera for those who are concerned about security late at night.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are very common in major Taiwanese cities. You do not need to look for a taxi, they'll be looking for you. The standard yellow taxis scour roads looking for potential riders such as lost foreigners. It is possible but generally unnecessary to phone for a taxi. To hail one, simply place your hand in front of you parallel to the ground. But they'll often stop for you even if you're just waiting to cross the street or for a bus. In less heavily trafficked areas further out from the transit hubs, taxis are always available by calling taxi dispatch centers or using mobile apps.\n\nDrivers generally cannot converse in English or any other foreign language (such as French, German, Japanese, etc.) or read Westernized addresses (except for special Taoyuan airport taxis). Get the hotel staff or a Taiwanese friend write out your destination in Chinese, and also take a business card from the hotel. Show the driver the Chinese writing of where you are going.\n\nTaxis are visibly metered (starting point priced at NT$70), and taxi drivers are strictly forbidden from taking tips. A maximum of four people can ride in one cab, and for the price of one. Compared to European or American taxis, those in Taiwan are inexpensive.\n\nAlthough taxi drivers in Taiwan tend to be more honest than in many other countries, not all are trustworthy. An indirect trip might cost you half again as much. A cab driver using night-time rates during the daytime will cost you 30% more (make sure he presses the large button on the left on his meter before 23:00). Avoid the especially overzealous drivers who congregate at the exits of train stations. Also, stand your ground and insist on paying meter price only if any driving on mountain roads is involved. Some drivers like to tack on surcharges or use night-time rates if driving to places like Wenshan (文山) or Wulai (烏來). Such attempts to cheat are against the law.\n\nFrom Taoyuan Airport (TPE), buses are a much more economical option but if you want a direct route Taoyuan airport drivers are the best choice. They're quite comfortable and get you to your destination as quick as possible. All the TPE taxi drivers are interlinked by radio so they could be forewarned if there are police. Sometimes, if there are traffic jams and no police around, the driver will drive in the emergency lane. Taxis from TPE to destinations in Tao Yuan, parts of Taipei county and some other destinations are 'allowed' to add an additional 50% to the meter fare.\n\nThe badge and taxi driver identification are displayed inside and the license number marked on the outside. You must also be wary that the driver turns on his meter, otherwise he might rip you off. In such a case, you aren't obliged to pay; but make sure you can find a police officer to settle the matter. If there are stories of passengers boarding fake taxis and being attacked by the driver, it is best not to be paranoid about it. Drivers may be more worried about passengers attacking them!\n\nIf you do call a taxi dispatch center, you will be given a taxi number to identify the vehicle when it arrives. Generally, dispatch is extremely rapid and efficient, as the taxis are constantly monitoring dispatch calls from the headquarters using radio while they are on the move. This is also the safest way to take a taxi, especially for women.\n\nTaxis are also a flexible although relatively expensive way to travel to nearby cities. They have the advantage over the electric trains in that they run very late at night. Drivers are required to provide a receipt if asked, though you might find them unwilling to do so.\n\nTaxi drivers, as elsewhere in Asia, are not keen on exchanging large notes. Try to keep some smaller denomination notes on hand to avoid the hassle of fighting with the driver for change.\n\nTaxi drivers are known for their strong political opinions. Many are supporters of the pan-green coalition and Taiwanese independence, spending all day listening to Taiwanese political talk radio. Drivers also have negative connotations as being former prisoners. Be careful about your opinions on sensitive political subjects (including, but not necessarily limited to cross-strait relations); also be careful of describing your destination which may be perceived politically (such as the President's Office or Chiang-Kai-Shek Memorial Hall). Also watch out for drivers who discriminate against other cultures such as taping \"No Korean passengers\" on their cars. This is sometimes unavoidable as some drivers provoke such discussion. In addition, if you see what looks like blood spewing from the driver's mouth, or him spitting blood onto the street—not to fret–it's merely him chewing betel nut (see box). Keep in mind, however, that betel nuts are a stimulant.\n\nTaxi drivers are generally friendly towards foreigners, and a few of them take the opportunity to try their limited English skills. They are most likely to ask you about yourself, and are a patient audience to your attempts at speaking Mandarin. If you are traveling with small children, don't be surprised if they are given candy when you disembark.\n\nWomen are sometimes warned not to take taxis alone at night. This is not an extreme risk, although there have been incidents where women have been attacked. To be more safe, women can have the hotel or restaurant phone a cab for them (ensuring a licensed driver), have a companion write down the license number of the driver (clearly displayed on the dashboard), or keep a cell phone handy. Do not get in if the driver doesn't have a license with picture clearly displayed in the cab.\n\nBy scooter or motorcycle\n\n[edit]\n\nScooters with an engine size of 50cc require a license to drive, and should be insured and registered in the owner's name. Foreign nationals with stay less than 30 days do not have an easy way to get a scooter license. Until 2003 it wasn't possible to get a scooter above 150cc. Many of the scooters within cities are only 50cc and incapable of going faster than 80 km/h (50 mph). The more powerful versions known as zhongxing (重型, heavy format) scooters are now quite common and can be rented for short-term use, or found for sale used at English In Taiwan if you're going to need it for a while. They are not allowed on freeways even if they are capable of going faster than 100 km/h (62 mph) unless used for certain police purposes, but that just means you have to take the scenic route.\n\nIf you're just learning to drive a scooter on the streets of Taiwan, it would be a good idea to practice a bit on a back road or alley until you have a feel for the scooter. Attempting to do so in the busier cities could easily be fatal. Certainly, things can get pretty hairy on Taiwanese roads and Taipei in particular has narrower more congested roads than many other cities. However if you know what you're doing, it's the perfect way to get around in a city.\n\nIt should be possible to rent a scooter by the day, week or month, depending on the city in which you're staying. One Taipei motorcycle and scooter rental service with English language service is Bikefarm, which is run by a very friendly and helpful English guy called Jeremy. In Taichung, Foreigner Assistance Services In Taiwan F.A.S.T offers a rental service for foreign visitors. Otherwise, scooters are generally easy to rent in most major cities, with many such places being near railway or bus stations. Most usually require some form of identification even if, in some cases, it consists of your expired Blockbuster video card! The average price you may expect is NT$400 for 24 hours, this includes one or two helmets.\n\nAnother option is to rent a motorcycle. Many foreigners swear by their 125cc Wild Wolf (野狼) motorcycles, and a trip around the island on a motorcycle can be a great way to see the island up close.\n\nIt is to be mentioned that since 2007, scooters and motorcycle over 550cc are allowed to go on expressway providing that they have a red license plate. They are however to be considered as cars, and as such cannot be parked in scooter parking spaces.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nAn international driving license is required for driving in Taiwan and may be used for up to 30 days, after which you'll need to apply for a local permit. Some municipalities may impose additional restrictions, so check ahead with the rental shop. VIP Rentals in Taipei is quite happy to rent cars to foreigners, and will even deliver the car to a given destination. A deposit is often required, and the last day of rental is not pro-rated, but calculated on a per-hour basis at a separate (higher) rate.\n\nThe numbered highway system is very good in Taiwan. Most traffic signs are in international symbols, but many signs show names of places and streets in Chinese only. All road directional signs are written in both Chinese and English, though the non-standardized Romanization means that English names can vary between road signs, making it rather confusing. The highways are in excellent shape with toll stations around every 30 km (19 mi). Toll is charged electronically and you pay the rental company when you return the car. Traffic moves on the right in Taiwan.\n\nParking in cities is generally charged. An attendant will put a payment slip under your windscreen wiper, you can pay at convenience stores.\n\nWhile driving may be the best way to get around the countryside, in larger cities like Taipei and Kaohsiung, traffic jams are a problem as is the difficulty of finding a good parking space, especially during the rush hour and traffic tends to get chaotic so you might be better off relying on public transport instead.\n\nBy thumb\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile Taiwanese themselves don't generally hitchhike, foreigners will have it very easy to find a hitch. However, in rural areas people may not recognize the thumb in the air symbol, and you may try pointing your hand to the ground and waving towards you. It is very easy to flag down a car in rural and mountain regions. So, instead of waiting for that one bus a day that goes by, just hitch a ride.\n\nFlagging down a car might work on a country lane with little or no public transportation, but doing so on a major road might lead to confusion, with the driver assuming that you are in trouble. A sign, especially one in Chinese, would therefore be of great help. The East coast around Hualien and Taitung enjoys a reputation for being especially good for getting rides. Taiwanese people are very friendly and helpful, so striking up a conversation with someone at a transport café or freeway service station may well see you on your way.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Taiwan is known for being a major player in the bicycle industry (through companies such as Giant and Merida), bicycles used to be considered an unwanted reminder of less prosperous times. This has changed, and bicycling is again on the rise, both as a tool for commuting and recreation, and support infrastructure is slowly being put into place. Several bike paths have been built, and recreational cycling has become quite popular amongst locals, especially on weekends. However, you should also be aware that local drivers have a well deserved reputation for recklessness. As such, you should exercise extreme caution when cycling outside of designated bicycle lanes and trails.\n\nThe government has been promoting bicycling as a method of clean recreation. Several designated bicycle paths have been built throughout Taiwan (especially along riverside parks). Additionally, long distance rides, including through the Central Mountain Range, and along the coastline around the main island have become popular. For long distance trips, bicycles can be shipped as is using standard freight service from the Taiwan Railway Administration between larger stations. Non-folding bicycles may also be transported aboard the Taipei and Kaohsiung rapid transit systems if loaded at specific stations, during off peak hours (usually 10:00-16:00 on weekdays, check with your local station personnel to confirm).\n\nTaipei MRT Route Map, bicycles may be loaded at designated stations\n\nKaohsiung MRT Bicycle Information[dead link] (passengers traveling with non-folding bicycles are assessed a flat rate NT$60 fare irrespective of distance)\n\nGiant Bicycles Corporation operates a large network of bicycle retail stores that offer rentals for as little as NT$100 per day, if requested one week in advance. Generally, the day rate is around NT$300 for a modern bicycle. Also, rented bicycles can be picked up at one station and given back another station. This can be convenient if you want to go down the quiet east coast with a bicycle and back up the busy west coast with the train/bus. A one week finesse bike including bags costs as little as €100.\n\nPublic shared bicycles are also available for rent at automated kiosks in most Taiwanese cities. Rental fees are usually paid using the rapid transit EasyCard or iPass system. There is YouBike in Taipei, which are available all over the city and even 30 km out – see Taipei for more details.\n\nAdditionally, many local police stations provide basic support services for cyclists, such as air pumps, and as a rest stop.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nDomestic air travel in Taiwan is primarily for outlying islands, as Taiwan is fairly compact with a modern and efficient rail network. There are also routes that connect the east and west coasts, since there is a geographical barrier between the two. There are no longer any west coast only routes as high speed rail has made them redundant.\n\nThe main carriers are Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary of China Airlines; and UNI Air, owned by EVA. Fares for domestic flights are not too expensive. The domestic airport in Taipei is Songshan Airport, which is in the north of the Taipei and easily reached by MRT or taxi. Other domestic airports include those in Taitung, Hualien, Makung (Penghu/Pescadores), Kinmen, Taichung, Nangan and Beigan. Travelers heading to Kenting can use the direct and frequent bus service from Kaohsiung airport that connect with flights arriving from Taipei.\n\nIf you want to visit Taiwan's smaller islands, the plane is still the best option, and is the only practical option for traveling to Kinmen and the easiest method of reaching Penghu and Matsu. For travel to Green Island and Orchid Island, the plane from Taitung saves several hours over taking the ferry which is notorious among Taiwanese for its rough ride.\n\nTaiwan is an excellent place for hiking and trekking, providing many interesting and picturesque trails in its mountainous center, or just northeast of Taipei. For reliable maps, GPS navigation, comprehensive trails and map information, consult OpenStreetMap, which is also used by this travel guide, and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz. Or just download the according GPX or KML files through Waymarked Trails for such trails on OpenStreetMap. (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID to download additional GPX or KML files through the same link.)\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Chinese cuisine\n\nTaiwan is a food lover's paradise, and a popular culinary tourism destination for East and Southeast Asian tourists. While not as highly regarded as the food from Hong Kong due to the traditionally high status Cantonese cuisine holds in Chinese culture, Taiwanese food has become more respected.\n\nGenerally speaking, the foods of Taiwan are derived from mainland Chinese cuisines. Because most Taiwanese trace their ancestry to Fujian, it comes as no surprise that much of Taiwanese cuisine was derived from the cuisine of Fujian. It is also possible to find Sichuan (四川) food, Hunan (湖南) food, Dongbei (東北) food, Guangdong (廣東) food and almost every other Chinese cuisine on the island, because many famous chefs from the mainland fled to Taiwan after the communist victory in 1949, and many of the Nationalists brought their family recipes with them when retreating from the mainland. That being said, the mainland Chinese cuisines found on Taiwan are not necessarily \"authentic\" as Taiwanese cuisine has absorbed substantial local influences, and significant Japanese influences because of 50 years of Japanese colonial rule, giving it a unique character that distinguishes it from its mainland Chinese counterparts. The Taiwanese are also passionately in love with eggs and seafood. Fruits are another famous part of Taiwanese food. A wide range of fruits can be found at local fruit shops and stations. The subtropical climate allows different fruits to grow nicely.\n\nTaiwan also has many of its own local specialties. A few found island wide include:\n\nBeef Noodles (牛肉麵 niúròu miàn) – Noodle soup with chunks of meltingly soft stewed beef and a dash of pickles, which traces its origins to the Kuomintang refugees from mainland China who retreated to Taiwan, and comes primarily in two distinct styles; Red-Braised Beef Noodle Soup (紅燒牛肉麵) comes in a dark brown and slightly spicy broth and traces its origins to the refugees from Sichuan, while Clear Broth Beef Noodle Soup (清燉牛肉麵), as the name suggests, comes in a lightly-coloured but flavorful broth, and traces its origin to the refugees from Shandong.\n\nOyster omelette (蚵仔煎 ó āh jiān – This is the Taiwanese name, as its Chinese name only exists in characters, but not in oral Mandarin), a dish made from eggs, oysters, sweet potato flour and the leaves of a local chrysanthemum, topped with sweet red sauce. The local version in Kinmen differs quite considerably from the version on the main island, and is closer to the versions served in mainland China's Fujian province.\n\nAiyu jelly (愛玉 àiyù) – Made from the seeds of a local fig and usually served on ice — sweet, cool and refreshing on a hot day\n\nTaiwan Sausage (香腸 xiāngcháng) – Usually made from pork, it is a modified version of the Cantonese laap cheong (臘腸) which has been emulsified and is much sweeter in taste. Unlike laap cheong, which is almost always eaten with rice, Taiwanese xiangchang is usually eaten on its own with some garlic.\n\nTaiwanese Orange (柳丁 liŭdīng) – A type of citrus fruit which is similar to usual oranges, except that the skin and flesh tend to look more yellowish like lemon. Unlike lemon, it is usually quite sweet.\n\nTaiwanese Porridge (粥 zhōu in Mandarin, 糜 beh in Taiwanese) — Rice porridge cooked with sweet potato eaten all across China but most commonly in Fujian. It is usually eaten with several different dishes as a starch base, often for breakfast.\n\nBraised pork rice (滷肉飯 lǔ ròu fàn) – Rice topped with pork belly that has been stewed in dark soy sauce and other spices and chopped into tiny pieces. A classic Taiwanese comfort dish. For a less fatty version, ask for 肉燥飯 (ròu zào fàn), which uses minced pork instead.\n\nThree-cup chicken (三杯雞 sān bēi jī) – A succulent and savory chicken dish with three sauces: soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. Served with rice.\n\nMuah chee (麻糬 or 麻糍), often called mochi in English — Refers to both the traditional South Fujian dessert made of glutinous rice flour and flavored with sesame and/or peanuts, and Japanese-style mochi. Both are considered variants of the same dish in Taiwan, with the former being regarded as more traditional, and the latter being regarded as more modern. There is also a variant that mixes in ground foxtail millet with the glutinous rice flour as well, and is a specialty of the indigenous people in southern Taiwan.\n\nRailway Bento (臺鐵便當 Tái tiě biàndang) — A national culinary icon and Taiwanese train tradition, this takeaway dish, based on the Japanese ekiben, is a holdover of the Japanese colonial era, and celebrated in Taiwan. The most popular bento is the braised pork cutlet bento. You can find this dish at major TRA train stations throughout Taiwan (though locals compare the quality of railway bento on a station-by-station basis), and adaptations are sold by various restaurants across Taiwan. Towns famous for their local versions of railway bentos include Fulong, Chishang and Fenchihu.\n\nPineapple cake(鳳梨酥 fènglísū) — A sweet traditional Taiwanese pastry and dessert containing butter, flour, eggs, sugar and pineapple paste or slices. Taiwan pineapple cake brands include Xiao Pan (小潘) and SunnyHills (微热山丘). There are subtle differences in the ingredients used for each brand of pineapple cake.\n\nMost cities and towns in Taiwan are famous for special foods because of the Taiwanese passion for food and influences from many different countries. Yonghe (永和), a suburb of Taipei, is famous for its freshly made soy milk (豆漿) and breakfast foods. Taichung is famous for its sun cakes (太陽餅 tàiyáng bǐng), a kind of sweet stuffed pastry. In Chiayi, it's square cookies, also called cubic pastry (方塊酥), crispy layered cookies cut into squares and sprinkled liberally with sesame seeds. Tainan is particularly famous among the Taiwanese for its abundance of good food and should be a stop for all gourmands. The most famous dish is arguably the coffin bread (棺材板). Virtually every city has its own famous specialties; many Taiwanese tourists will visit other cities on the island simply to try the local foods and then return home.\n\nTaiwan also has remarkably good bakery items. Most specialize in sweet Chinese pastries or Western pastries adjusted to local tastes, but look out for We Care bakeries which also offer Western options such as whole wheat loaves, sour breads and ciabatta.\n\nVegetarians are better catered for in restaurants and variety than in most other countries.\n\nMichelin publishes a guide to restaurants in Taipei. That said, it does not cover the whole of Taiwan, and most locals only take the Michelin guide with a pinch of salt. The only three-starred Michelin star restaurant in Taiwan is the Cantonese restaurant, Le Palais, in Taipei.\n\nPlaces to eat\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you're on a budget, the cheapest food can be found in back-alley noodle shops and night market stalls, where you can get a filling bowl of noodles for around NT$35-70.\n\nThe Taiwanese love to snack and even many restaurants advertise xiaochi (小吃), literally \"small eats\", the Taiwanese equivalent of Cantonese dim sum. There are also the standard fast food places such as McDonalds (a standard Big Mac Meal costs NT$115), KFC and MOS Burger. In addition there are large numbers of convenience stores (such as 7-Eleven and Family Mart) that sell things like tea eggs, sandwiches, bento boxes (便當盒) and drinks.\n\nNight markets are also a good place to try some delicious local Taiwanese fare at attractive prices. Examples would be the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) in Taipei and the Ruifeng Night Market (瑞豐夜市) in Kaohsiung, each of which has its own special dishes not to be missed.\n\nEtiquette\n\n[edit]\n\nAs with Chinese cuisine elsewhere, food in Taiwan is generally eaten with chopsticks and served on large plates placed at the center of the table and shared among multiple people. Oftentimes, a serving spoon or pair of chopsticks (公筷 gōngkuài) accompanies the dishes and guests do not use their own chopsticks to transfer food to their plates.\n\nThe usual traditional Chinese taboos when eating with chopsticks apply in Taiwan as well. For instance, do not stick your chopsticks straight up or into your bowl of rice. This is reminiscent of incense sticks at a temple, and has connotations of wishing death upon those around you. When putting down chopsticks, either place them on the provided porcelain chopstick rest (at fancier restaurants) or rest the chopsticks across the top of your bowl. Also, do not use your chopsticks to spear your food or move bowls and plates.\n\nSee Chinese table etiquette for more details. Although there are minor differences between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese etiquette, much of traditional Chinese table manners apply to Taiwan too.\n\nDietary restrictions\n\n[edit]\n\nVegetarians\n\n[edit]\n\nAll Mahayana Buddhists, which account for the majority of adherents in Taiwan, aspire to be pure vegetarian in deference to the Buddha's teaching of non-violence and compassion. So, vegetarian restaurants (called su-shi 素食 tsan-ting 餐廳 in Mandarin, and often identified with the 卍 symbol, in this context a Buddhist symbol) can be found in abundance all over the island, and they run from cheap buffet style to gourmet and organic. Buffet styled restaurants (called 自助餐, which means \"Serve Yourself Restaurant\") are common in almost every neighborhood in large cities, and unlike the 'all-you-can-eat' buffets (which charge a set price, usually ranging from NT$250-350 including dessert and coffee/tea), the cost is estimated by the weight of the food on your plate. Rice (there is usually a choice of brown or white) is charged separately, but soup or cold tea is free and you can refill as many times as you like. NT$90-120 will buy you a good sized, nutritious meal.\n\nHowever, if you cannot find a veggie restaurant, don't fret. Taiwanese people are very flexible and most restaurants will be happy to cook you up something to suit your requirements. The following sentences in Mandarin might be helpful: 我吃素 (Wǒ chī sù) - I'm vegetarian, 我不吃肉 (Wǒ bù chī ròu) - I don't eat meat. However, as Mandarin is a tonal language, you might need to say both, plus practice your acting skills to get yourself understood. Good luck! NB: If a restaurant refuses your order, don't push the issue. The reason will not be an unwillingness to accommodate your request, but because the basic ingredients of their dishes may include chicken broth or pork fat.\n\nTaiwanese vegetarianism (素食) isn't simply vegetarianism, for there is a notion of \"plainness\" to it. In most cases it excludes the \"five pungent vegetables\", namely onion, garlic, chives, leeks and spring onion. Mahayana Buddhists consider these items \"un-plain\" because they potentially cause physical excitement, which could hinder the meditative process. Thus, when offering food to a strict vegetarian, be aware that they may not eat food containing these.\n\nAlthough vegetarian restaurants in Taiwan do not aspire to vegan principles, almost all non-dessert dishes at Chinese-style veggie restaurants will actually be vegan because the Taiwanese do not have a tradition of eating dairy products. Ensure that your dish does not contain eggs, however.\n\nAllergies\n\n[edit]\n\nAwareness of food allergies is limited in Taiwan. If you can speak Chinese, you can ask restaurant staff about whether the food contains common allergens like peanuts or shellfish, and depending on the chef, they may be able to make some adjustments to accommodate you. Don't expect that level of accommodation from night markets stalls though. A serious soy allergy is basically incompatible with Taiwanese cuisine due to the prevalence of soy sauce as an ingredient, and gluten-free diets are very difficult to come by due to the very low incidence of celiac disease in Taiwan. Dairy is not commonly used in traditional Taiwanese cuisine, so avoiding it should be straightforward for lactose-intolerant people.\n\nReligious diets\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople on religious diets will have a hard time in Taiwan, and you will need to do some planning in advance. Muslims should contact the Chinese Muslim Association for advice on where to find halal food, while Jews should contact the Jewish Taiwan Cultural Association for information on where to find kosher food.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nThe majority of travelers who work in Taiwan pick up temporary jobs teaching English. Jobs teaching other languages (mainly European or Japanese) do exist but have a much smaller proportion of the market.\n\nJob requirements: In finding employment with a language school, experience, teaching qualifications and references are not required but obviously help. On paper, a big issue is also made about accents, with the North American English accent being heavily favored over British, Australian and South African accents in many language schools' sales marketing. However, in practice, many schools that advertise 'American English' and claim that their teachers are all from Canada or the USA, actually employ teachers from anywhere. Age is a factor, with applicants in their 20s seemingly being preferred. More than anything, appearance is probably the major factor in finding employment with most schools—Do you 'look Western'?—and reliability and turning up on time for work is then the major factor for keeping your job. Therefore, if you look the part, it is very easy to find a school willing to take you on for at least a few days.\n\nThis 'look Western' point has quite a bearing. Unfortunately, Taiwan is hardly a great promoter of equal opportunities. In many schools there is a prejudice against teachers applying for jobs who are not of white appearance, seen as the typical Western appearance in Asian countries. This is independent of whether or not the teacher has relevant teaching ability and citizenship of one of the permitted ARC countries. Many parents who send their children to schools to be taught English expect the teacher to look like they are from the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and so on, and so the decision on the part of the school managers is mainly about economics. For those affected by this, it's a sad fact of Taiwan that is unlikely to change in the near future. Good employers without such prejudiced requirements do exist, but greater perseverance is needed when looking for them.\n\nIt is illegal to work without a work permit and an ARC (or Alien Residency Permit), and legal work requires a university degree and usually a long (over two month) application process. Alternatively, if you have a lot of money, you can obtain an investor visa by investing a large sum of money in a local business, which allows you to work for that company in a management capacity. However, illegal employment is easy to find with many school managers being willing to pay under the table for short durations. If caught or reported, you risk criminal charges and could be deported. The government tends to waver from being very lax on this issue under one administration to suddenly taking action under the next; but it only takes one disgruntled student to report you and have you fined and deported. Consider your options carefully!\n\nThe rules for getting an ARC do change often and each administrative part of Taiwan has its own ways of handling them, so it is best to check the pages of the website Forumosa and find out what the experiences of others are in your area. Keep in mind, that you can only get an ARC for English teaching if you are a 'citizen of a native English speaking country'. Taiwan's government defines these countries to be only the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa. Almost all teachers apply for an ARC through their employers only after starting work and it is tied to their ongoing employment with that school. Therefore, if the teacher wishes to leave their employment, they will have to quickly find an alternative employer or lose their ARC and hence be required to leave Taiwan. Also, very few schools will arrange an ARC without at least a year-long contract being signed. Frankly, with all this inflexibility, it's no wonder so many teachers opt for the non-legal route. That and tax evasion.\n\nCitizens of Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland and Canada aged 18–30 can apply for a working holiday visa. For more information, visit the Bureau of Consular Affairs website.\n\nAfter living in Taiwan continuously for 5 years, you may apply for permanent residency. If granted, it allows you to live and work in Taiwan indefinitely without restrictions.\n\nA lot of the illegal teaching work that the majority of English teachers partake in is simply through private student tuition with payment being cash-in-hand. You can find a lot of private students around universities that have a Chinese-teaching department—look for the areas where all the foreign students are and check the noticeboards. Because the majority of adult private students want to practice English conversation, you won't need to have any Chinese ability. However, it is definitely a selling point and, if you do have Chinese-speaking ability, it's worthwhile mentioning that in any advertising of your services. Also, once you have some regular students, remember that in Taiwan, as in most Asian countries, 'connections' or 'guanxi' are very important. If your students like you, they will in all likelihood recommend you to their family and friends.\n\nTeaching English in Taiwan can be lucrative, as the salaries are very high compared to the cost of living, typically ranging NT$500-650 per hour before deductions in most language schools, with anything between NT$500-1,000 per hour being negotiable for private students. In the past few years, the flow of would-be teachers into Taiwan has increased dramatically, resulting in stiffer competition for jobs and a general drop in wages, and this trend may continue. Employers of English teachers are notorious for racial discrimination. White people are much more likely to get better offers than those of other races, regardless of ability.\n\nAside from English-teaching, other common kinds of employment available for mainly native English-speaking travelers include such tid-bits as small acting parts for TV and film, voice talent (video games, dubbing tracks, etc.), editing and even writing educational materials. Many of these jobs are advertised on billboards in Chinese language-teaching institutes and universities, where there are likely to be many foreign students.\n\nIf after traveling and living there, you find you are serious about working in Taiwan, the most lucrative employment to be had is if you are employed by a multinational company, perhaps in a high-paying country like the UK, U.S. or Australia, and you are sent across to their office in Taiwan. Many foreigners end up doing the same job as their colleagues who were employed in the Taiwan office, but for perhaps 3 or 4 times their pay.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Taiwan treats drug offenses extremely severely. The death penalty or life imprisonment is mandatory for those convicted of trafficking, manufacturing, importing or exporting more than 15 g of heroin, 30 g of morphine, 30 g of cocaine, 500 g of cannabis, 200 g of cannabis resin and 1.2 kg of opium, and possession of these quantities is all that is needed for you to be convicted.\n\nUnauthorized consumption can result in up to 5 years' jail. You can be charged for unauthorized consumption as long as traces of illicit drugs are found in your system, even if you can prove that they were consumed outside the country and you can be charged for trafficking as long as drugs are found in bags that are in your possession or in your room, even if they aren't yours and regardless of whether you're aware of them. Therefore, be vigilant of your possessions.\n\nCrime\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan is very safe for tourists, even for women walking down the street alone at night. This is not to say, however, that there is no crime, and you should always take the usual precautions. In crowded areas such as night markets or festivals, for example, pickpockets are a known problem. However, it is fair to say that the streets of Taiwan are generally very safe, and that violent crime and muggings are very rare.\n\nIn addition, it is also very unusual to see drunks on the street, day or night.\n\nLike anywhere else in the world, women should be cautious when taking taxis alone late at night. Although they are generally safe, it's a good idea to arrange to have a friend call you when you get home and to be seen making the arrangements for this by the cab driver. It also helps if a friend sees you being picked up as taxis have visible license numbers.\n\nPolice departments in most jurisdictions have a Foreign Affairs Police unit staffed by English-speaking officers. When reporting a major crime, it is advisable to contact the Foreign Affairs unit in addition to officers at the local precinct. Police stations are marked with a red light above the door and display a sign with the word \"Police\" clearly printed in English. For more information see the National Police Agency website .\n\nForeign victims of a major crime in Taiwan are also advised to report the matter to their government's representative office in Taipei.\n\nAlso, remember that you call 110 for police in Taiwan, and 119 for fire department or medical help. Most of the public telephone booths allow you to call 110 or 119 for free. See \"Emergency Phone Numbers\" section below.\n\nTaiwan is home to many triads (Chinese organized crime syndicates), although they almost never target the average person in the street, and most tourists will not encounter them. They are mostly involved in the drug trade, prostitution, illegal gambling and loansharking; avoid these and they will not bother you.\n\nMilitary exercises\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Taiwanese military organizes regular civil-defense exercise, known as Wan-an Exercise (萬安演習). Air raid sirens are activated for 30 minutes during the exercise, and you are required to follow any evacuation orders made by the military and police.\n\nIf you are in a building, you should close all windows and doors and turn off lights.\n\nIf you are driving, you must pull over your vehicle and make a complete stop. Vehicles must not enter any motorways, but must leave the motorway and pull over your vehicle in exits. Traffic police will give proper instructions to drivers and regulate traffic flow.\n\nIf you are taking a train/metro, you must not enter the train or leave the station, and should follow evacuation orders given by railway staff, the military and the police.\n\nFailure to comply with instructions can result in a heavy fine.\n\nEmergency phone numbers\n\n[edit]\n\nPolice: 110\n\nFire/Ambulance: 119\n\nThe police and fire/ambulance offer service in English.\n\nFor those who need Taiwanese governmental assistance in English, this website has a 24-hour toll-free foreigner service hotline at 0800-024-111, which you may call for assistance.\n\nNatural hazards\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan often experiences typhoons (颱風) during the summer months and early fall, especially on the East Coast. Heavy monsoon rainfall also occurs during the summer. Hikers and mountaineers should be sure to consult weather reports before heading into the mountains. A major hazard following heavy rainfall in the mountains is falling rocks (土石流) caused by the softening of the earth and there are occasional reports of people being killed or injured by these.\n\nTaiwan is also on the Pacific Ring of Fire, which means that earthquakes are a common occurrence. Most earthquakes are barely noticeable, though the effect may be slightly amplified for those in higher buildings. While the local building codes are extremely strict, general precautions should still be observed during an earthquake, including opening the door to prevent it from being jammed, taking cover and checking for gas leaks afterwards. While most newer buildings have been built according to strict codes that enable them to withstand major earthquakes, some of the older buildings were not constructed to such high standards and therefore are vulnerable to serious damage or collapse in the case of a strong tremor.\n\nTaiwan's wild areas are home to a variety of poisonous snakes, including the bamboo viper, Russel's viper, banded krait, coral snake, Chinese cobra, Taiwan habu, and the so-called \"hundred pacer\" (百步蛇). Precautions against snake bites include making plenty of noise as you hike, wearing long trousers and avoiding overgrown trails. Most snakes are scared of humans, so if you make noise you will give them time to get away. Walking quietly means that you may suddenly startle them around a corner when you appear, and trigger an attack. The Russel's viper, one of the most dangerous snakes in Taiwan, is an exception: it generally prefers to take a stand against threats.\n\nTraffic\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal drivers have a well-deserved reputation for reckless driving. It is possible (even normal) to obtain a driving license in Taiwan without ever having driven on the roads, and this may be a reason (along with the overcrowded roads) why courteous or defensive driving is definitely not the norm. The guiding principles seem to be that the right of way belongs to the larger vehicle, i.e. trucks have the right-of-way over cars, cars over motorcycles, motorcycles over people, etc. Despite traffic's chaotic appearance, it is viscerally intuitive to yield the right-of-way to a much larger vehicle barreling towards you. It is advisable to use slow and smooth movements over quick or sudden ones. Local drivers regularly cut in front of moving traffic into spaces that seem too small, try to change lanes regardless of the fact their destination is already full, etc. Be aware that during busy traffic (i.e., nearly always) two-lane roads will spontaneously become three-lane, an orange light will be interpreted as 'speed up', and the smallest moment's pause in oncoming traffic will result in everybody that's waiting trying to turn across it. Drivers routinely enter a junction when their exit is blocked, and are therefore frequently still there long after the lights change, blocking traffic traveling in other directions. Many motorcycle riders also have a tendency to zip through any space, no matter how tiny. Also be aware that motorcycles often travel through areas typically considered pedestrian-only spaces, like the night-markets.\n\nIf you drive a car or a motorcycle, the obvious rule is that if someone turns in front of you, you should be the one to adapt. To avoid collisions, drivers need to be extremely vigilant for other vehicles creating hazards and always be willing to adjust speed or direction to accommodate. Do not expect drivers to yield way, or respect traffic lights in many areas, especially in central and southern Taiwan. Sounding the horn is the usual way a Taiwanese driver indicates that they do not intend to accommodate a driver trying to encroach on their lane, etc., and does not necessarily imply the anger or criticism, as it does in other countries.\n\nBe extra careful when crossing the road, even to the extent of looking both ways on a one-way street. When crossing at a pedestrian crossing at a T-junction or crossroads, be aware that when the little green man lights up and you start crossing, motorists will still try to turn right, with or without a green feeder light. Even on roads where traffic is infrequent and the green light is in your favor, bike riders are still strongly advised to check the opposite lane.\n\nIn Taiwan most traffic lights have countdown timers to alert drivers when light will change from red to green.\n\nHomosexuality\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan is generally a safe destination for gay and lesbian travelers. There are no laws against homosexuality in Taiwan and unprovoked violence against gays and lesbians is almost unheard of. Same-sex marriage was legalised in Taiwan on 24 May 2019, making it the first Asian jurisdiction to do so. Taiwan is also the first East Asian jurisdiction to have enacted anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation in the areas of education and employment. There is an annual gay pride event called Taiwan Pride. Taipei is home to a vibrant gay scene, and there are also gay bars in some of Taiwan's other cities like Taichung and Kaohsiung.\n\nAcceptance among the Taiwanese public tends to be measured, and homosexuality is still considered to be somewhat of a social taboo, particularly by the older generation. Openly displaying your sexual orientation in public is likely to draw stares and whispers from some people. Nevertheless, attitudes are changing and homosexuality tends to be more accepted by the younger people.\n\nDogs\n\n[edit]\n\nThey can be a problem in remote and rural regions, although they are far less numerous than in Thailand and Myanmar. If they get too close to you, picking up a stone or having a big stick is usually a sufficient deterrent. Indigenous Taiwanese hold dogs in higher regard than Han Chinese do. Many indigenous communities have dogs freely running around their communities.\n\nRespect\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Taiwanese are generally a warm and polite people, having been strongly influenced by Confucianism. As Taiwanese culture places a strong emphasis on respect for elders, elderly visitors will find most Taiwanese to be very helpful and accommodating.\n\nNaming customs and modes of address are generally the same as in mainland China. See the Respect section of that article for details.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwan shares several cultural taboos/guidelines with other East Asian nations:\n\nWhen giving and receiving business cards, always do it using both hands and with a slight bow of the head. Giving or receiving a business card with only one hand is very disrespectful.\n\nSome Taiwanese are superstitious about anything connected with dying – unlucky things should never be mentioned. The number 4 (four, pronounced 'si') sounds like the word for death in Mandarin.\n\nDo not write people's names in red. This again has connotations of death. When writing someone's English name, this is not a problem, but avoid writing Chinese names in red.\n\nDo not whistle or ring a bell at night. This is an \"invitation to ghosts\".\n\nDo not point at cemeteries or graves. This is disrespectful to the dead.\n\nUnlike in some other parts of East Asia, bowing to greet people has fallen out of custom as handshakes and waves have become more common.\n\nThere are numerous taboos dictating that certain objects shouldn't be given to others, often because the word for that object sounds like another unfortunate word:\n\nClocks. The phrase \"to give a clock\" (\"song zhong\"), in Mandarin, has the same sound as the word \"to perform last rites.\" If you do give someone a clock, the recipient may give you a coin in return to dispel the curse.\n\nShoes. Never ever offer shoes as a gift to old people, as it signifies sending them on their way to heaven. This is acceptable only if by mutual arrangement it is nominally sold, where the receiving party gives a small payment of about NT$10.\n\nKnives or sharp objects, as they are made for or could be used to hurt the person.\n\nUmbrellas, which in Mandarin sound the same as the word for \"break up\". Friends should therefore never give friends umbrellas. Instead, friends will euphemistically \"rent\" each other umbrellas for a tiny amount (NT$1, for example).\n\nThe Taiwanese are certainly not puritanical and enjoy a drink, especially the locally brewed Taiwan Beer and Kaoliang. However, Taiwan does not have a culture of heavy drinking like in Northern China and it is rare to see anyone drunk on the streets. While over indulging in alcohol is not a social taboo as such (and some people do so at weddings), it is considered a sign of lack of self-confidence and immaturity, and doing so certainly won't gain you any respect among Taiwanese friends.\n\nYou are expected to remove your shoes before entering a house. You will find some slippers to be worn by visitors next to the entrance door. It is likely to be the same ritual for bathrooms and balconies where you will be expected to remove your slippers to wear a pair of plastic sandals (though it is less shocking not to use the sandals by then).\n\nAs you will get along with Taiwanese people, you are very likely to receive small presents of any sort, such as drinks, food or little objects. These are a very convenient way to lubricate social relations for Taiwanese people, and are especially common between friends in their 20s. You should reciprocate any such presents with something similar, but it does not need to be immediate or specially tailored to that person (i.e., keep it simple). As a teacher you are not expected to offer anything in return, as long as the relationship stays formal. However, beware of the sometimes overly generous parents who can go as far as offering presents running in the thousands of NT$ and who will then expect you to take special care of their child (understand that their expectations will be considered fair in Taiwanese culture).\n\nYou are not expected to tip in hotels, restaurants and taxis, though bellhops may still expect NT$50 or so for carrying your luggage.\n\nMuch like the mainland Chinese, \"saving face\" is also a major value in Taiwanese culture. In general, you should avoid pointing out other people's mistakes in order to avoid causing major embarrassment and if you really have to, call the person to one side and do it in private, and try to do it in a polished manner.\n\nIf you should need to use a temple's washroom, bow to any statues of deities you see on the way whether or not you believe in them. While most people will not mind you using the temple's washroom, they expect you to treat their place of worship with respect. If you plan to offer gifts (such as simple fruits) to the statues of deities in the temple, it is expected that you wash the fruits and your hands prior to offering. In addition, upon entering and leaving a temple, do take and avoid stepping directly on the raised threshold: always try to step over it. You should also never point to the status of deities with your index finger; use your thumb or an up-facing open palm instead.\n\nYou will often see priority seats (博愛座) on public transportation in Taiwan. These are reserved for the elderly, disabled people, pregnant women and women carrying young children; do not sit in them unless one of those situations applies to you.\n\nCultural identity is a complex and sensitive issue in Taiwan. While most Taiwanese people are ethnically Chinese, many people, especially the youth, seek to distance themselves from China with a distinct Taiwanese identity, and will often emphasize their Japanese colonial heritage instead. Many Taiwanese are of the view that Taiwanese culture was violently suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek, who then proceeded to forcibly impose Chinese culture on Taiwan, in an act of cultural genocide.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nMost Taiwanese people follow a mix of traditional Chinese folk religions and Buddhism, and it is common to visit temples to offer prayers during important festivals or life events. That said, contemporary Taiwanese society is largely secular in daily life, and religion in general does not play a significant role in people's work or political affiliations. Nevertheless, you are still expected to dress and behave respectfully when visiting temples.\n\nAs in other Asian countries, swastikas are commonly seen in Buddhist temples as a religious symbol. They emphatically do not represent Nazism or anti-Semitism.\n\nWhen visiting temples, be sure to enter using the right gate and exit using the left gate (facing inwards). The larger middle gate is traditionally reserved for deities and the Emperor of China. Also be sure to avoid pointing at the statues of deities with your index figure, as it is considered to be very disrespectful. Use your thumb or an up-facing open palm instead.\n\nThe most popular traditional Chinese deity in Taiwan is Mazu, a Fujianese shamaness who is believed to have ascended to godhood and now protects sailors, as the Fujianese were largely a seafaring people.\n\nChristianity is the dominant religion among the indigenous Taiwanese, with Presbyterianism and Roman Catholicism being the main denominations. There is also a small Christian minority among the Han Chinese.\n\nTaiwanese people are generally tolerant of different religions, and people of all faiths can usually practice their religion without any major problems. The Falun Gong religion which is banned in mainland China is allowed in Taiwan, though attitudes towards them from the local Taiwanese people tend to be very mixed.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nTaiwanese society is rather polarized by allegiance between supporters of the two major political blocs informally known as \"Pan-Blue Coalition\" and \"Pan-Green Coalition\", although there are large numbers of people who are either centrist or who don't care. To simplify a very complex situation, pan-blue supporters tend to be more favorable toward the idea of reunification or maintaining the status quo with China and pan-green supporters tend to be more favorable toward the idea of establishing a formally independent Taiwan state, among other differences.\n\nAlthough there are some correlations, it is highly unwise to assume anything about a particular person's political beliefs based on what you think you know about their background. Also, this very brief sketch of Taiwanese politics obscures a large amount of complexity. Traditionally, mainlanders, indigenous people, Hakka people and people from Kinmen and Matsu tended to be strongly pan-blue, while Taiwanese speakers from Central and Southern Taiwan tended to be strongly pan-green, though this distinction has largely disappeared among the younger generation, who are now overwhelmingly pro-independence.\n\nUnless you know your listener well, it is unwise to say anything (either positive or negative) about the current government, about historical figures in Taiwanese history, about Taiwan's international relations, or about relations with mainland China. Some political figures such as Sun Yat-sen (who is also popular in the PRC and with the Chinese government) and Chiang Ching-kuo are generally seen positively, but others (Chiang Kai-shek, Lee Teng-hui, Chen Shui-bian, and Ma Ying-jeou) arouse very polarized feelings.\n\nSome Taiwanese will get very offended if you imply that Taiwan is part of China. Others will get very offended if you imply that Taiwan is not part of China. Referring to the PRC as \"mainland China\" (中國大陸 zhōngguó dàlù) rather than simply China will tend not to offend anyone, as the term is generally used to exclude Hong Kong and Macau as well, making it less subjective. Referring to the Republic of China as a whole as \"Taiwan Province\" will draw a negative reaction from most Taiwanese. \"Greater China\" may be used in certain business contexts. Keep in mind, however, that there are so many subtleties and complexities here that if you are talking about these things, you've already wandered into a minefield.\n\nHowever, simply referring to the island as \"Taiwan\" is fine, as that is the name used by the locals, regardless of their political persuasion. Titles such as \"Republic of China\" are reserved for official matters only. People from Kinmen and Matsu do not identify as Taiwanese and instead identify as Kinmenese/Matsunese or simply Chinese. When in Kinmen or Matsu, you should call the country the \"Republic of China\", and use \"Taiwan\" only to refer to the island of Taiwan.\n\nRelations with mainland China, as well as the Hong Kong protests, are sensitive issues; tread carefully on these topics.\n\nDespite the deep mistrust many Taiwanese have of the communist Chinese government, most locals bear little to no animosity towards individual mainland Chinese visitors. As long as you avoid political discussions and behave yourself properly, you should not run into any problems.\n\nJapanese occupation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn contrast to other Asian countries, Taiwanese feelings towards the Japanese occupation (1895-1945) are generally positive, and most Taiwanese regard the legacy of Japanese colonial rule as an integral part of their national and cultural identity, though there are exceptions. Some of the older people who lived through the period of Japanese rule often bear a certain degree of nostalgia for that time, although there was strong resistance, and massacres of both Han Chinese and indigenous people were carried out throughout the occupation. Nevertheless, many Taiwanese bear a sense of gratitude towards the Japanese for modernizing Taiwan, and many people who lived through both periods regard Japanese rule more favorably than the subsequent Kuomintang rule under Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nJapanese visitors can expect a particularly warm welcome as most Taiwanese admire Japanese culture, and modern Taiwanese culture continues to be heavily influenced by that of Japan. In particular, many shops and tourist attractions are based on a theme of colonial nostalgia."
