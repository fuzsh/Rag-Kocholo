        "text": "Tsai Ing-wen made history in 2016 as Taiwan's first female president - now, as she prepares to leave office, her defence of Taiwan's sovereignty may arguably define her legacy.\n\nHer refusal to acknowledge \"The 1992 consensus\", the vaguely-worded agreement which says Taiwan is part of \"One China\", led Beijing to label her a separatist. She has also said China needs to show Taiwan respect and that Taipei will not bow to pressure.\n\nThe 67-year-old's strong stance has won her admirers and detractors in equal measure.\n\nWith three presidential candidates vying to replace Ms Tsai in Saturday's election, and Beijing keeping a watchful eye on proceedings, the question of how to deal with China remains a key issue at the ballot box.\n\nYet China has not been the only threat to her years in office, with other policy decisions leaving some wondering if she would be a one-term president.\n\nAttempts to promote green energy ended with her being accused of nearly causing an electricity shortage, while the offer of two days off a week for all workers was rejected amid allegations of hurting, rather than increasing, workers' earnings and holidays.\n\nMaking Taiwan the first Asian society where gay marriage is legal - a move which earned her plaudits around the world - also damaged her popularity at home.\n\nWhether she would even run for a second term was uncertain, with a former subordinate challenging for her party's nomination and - at one point - her approval rating hitting the 15% mark.\n\nBut it seems that her biggest headache - China - was the very thing that helped her decisively win another four years in office in the January 2020 elections.\n\nMs Tsai is the youngest of 11 children, born in a coastal village in the south of Taiwan. She moved to the capital Taipei when she was 11. Her mixed ethnicity - Hakka father and Taiwanese mother - has been cited as one of the traits that helped her connect to supporters.\n\nShe also has a grandmother who is from one of the non-Chinese indigenous groups in Taiwan.\n\nA law graduate of the National Taiwan University, Ms Tsai completed her master's degree at Cornell University Law School in 1980 and went on to earn a doctorate from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1984.\n\nIn the 1990s, she was a negotiator for Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization. She was then asked to serve on the National Security Council as an adviser to former President Lee Teng-hui.\n\nMs Tsai joined the DPP in 2004 and rose quickly to become its chairwoman four years later, when the party suffered a heavy defeat in the presidential elections.\n\nHer predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, lost to Ma Ying-jeou at the polls in 2008, and was later jailed for corruption.\n\nIt was her style and bearing when she appeared on the political scene which set her apart from the rest of the DPP \"old guard\", something that has worked to her advantage in attracting younger voters.\n\nDespite splits and factionalism in the party, Ms Tsai was able to rally the support she needed to rejuvenate the DPP. Under her leadership, it has performed much better in local elections.\n\nHer first attempt at running for president failed in 2012, but she continued to build on her successes. Four years later, she was elected.\n\nHer first term in office saw Taiwan's minimum wage, investments and stocks rise. Social services, including childcare and elderly care, and public housing also received a boost.\n\nBut her second term saw Ms Tsai face a range of challenges. In November 2022, she resigned as party chair after the DPP's poor showing in local elections centred on municipal issues.\n\nThis was followed by economic annual growth figures in 2023 projecting annual growth at just 1.42% - the lowest since 2009. The government's statistics bureau cited a larger-than-expected decrease in exports and investment.\n\nThrough it all, Beijing has loomed large, with Chinese President Xi Jinping repeatedly saying that Taiwan's \"reunification\" with China is inevitable.\n\nIt has been more than just words. In August 2022, Beijing staged huge military drills around Taiwan in a protest against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island. It has also repeatedly rehearsed encircling the island with fighter jets and navy ships, while Chinese military aircraft probe the edge of Taiwan's airspace on an almost daily basis.\n\nAs she leaves office, China remains one of the biggest issues on the ballot - but, as it has been throughout her tenure, not the only one.\n\nRising costs, unaffordable housing and shrinking opportunities have also driven dissatisfaction against the DPP - and sent young voters into the arms of the Taiwan People's Party and its populist candidate, Ko Wen-je.\n\nWhoever becomes the next president of Taiwan will have his work cut out dealing with these various issues.\n\nBut there is no doubt that, for better or for worse, Ms Tsai's policies have changed the conversation around China - perhaps permanently."
