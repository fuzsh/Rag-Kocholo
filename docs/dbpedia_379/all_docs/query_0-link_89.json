        "text": "Over Mid-Autumn Festival long weekend, the Taichung ETAs planned a trip to Kenting, which I missed out on because my landlord had invited me to his family’s holiday barbeque. Since then, I’ve heard so much about the area from their ranting and raving and I’d been looking forward to seeing the southmost part of Taiwan for myself and with my boyfriend John.\n\nKenting National Park, or more commonly known as Kenting (墾丁, or pinyin: Kěndīng), is Taiwan’s oldest national park and is known for many things, including its tropical climate and sunshine, scenic beaches, and annual Spring Scream rock-band festival.\n\nJohn and I spent three nights in at Border Hotel, which we booked through Airbnb. It’s a cute and funky little boutique hotel located right on Kenting Street. Front desk hospitality was lukewarm for us, but we enjoyed our room and hotel amenities (slippers inside the room and water machine right down the hall).\n\nDay 1\n\nJohn and I arrived to Zuoying Station around 12:30pm and planned on catching a Kenting Express Bus down, but were persuaded by a private driver looking for more passengers to take his van directly to our hotel instead. We bargained his $700NTD asking price to $600NTD and shared a speedy two hour drive with a sweet, young couple from China.\n\nWe arrived around 2:30pm, dropped off our luggage at the front desk, and walked around for half an hour before we could check in at 3pm. It was misty, chilly, and rather windy the first day we were there. We walked down a stretch of Kenting Street to check out restaurant and shopping options before heading back.\n\nWe rested before checking out Kenting Beach, a non-swimming beach just a few minutes walk away. It was too cloudy and gray to see sunset, but we enjoyed walking and sitting on the beach for a little while and watching the waves. When it got dark, we headed back to the main street for the night market 小吃 (small eats). We got torched beef cubes, popcorn chicken, grilled squid, banana and chocolate “pancake”, and sausage on sticky rice dog.\n\nDay 2\n\nDuring our stay in Kenting, we relied on public transportation to get around. I was excited to learn that we could take the 101 close to Habitat & Zoo for Native Sika Deer, also known as Paradise of Deer. It’s a feeding and interacting with Taiwanese sika deer experience. Entrance fee is $200 NTD per adult, which includes the price of one food serving (valued at $40 NTD).\n\nTaiwanese sika deer (台灣梅花鹿, or pinyin: Táiwān méihuālù) are a subspecies of the sika deer, which are among the few deer types that don’t lose their spots with age. Intensive hunting of sika deer during Dutch colonialism through the 1900s unfortunately eliminated the wild sika deer population by 1969. However, since deer are easily kept in captivity, there were many captive populations around the island. The Taiwanese government was able to eventually reintroduce deer to Kenting National Park in 1994 using a founding population of 22 sika deer from Taipei Zoo.\n\nThe Habitat & Zoo seemed to attract parents with young children and other young couples. It was really fun watching toddlers try to get close to deer to either pet or feed them. Some children were definitely braver than others.\n\nThere were probably some 20-25 deer in the park. We spent some time trying to befriend and pet some deer before trading in our ticket for food. The staff rotates the food visitors can feed the deer. When we arrived, guests could trade in their tickets for carrots, but we overhead that at 1pm, “grass” (which John thinks was sugar cane) would be given out, so we waited until then.\n\nIt was so fun being able to attract a hoard of four or five baby deer at once with the “grass”. They very enthusiastically ate all the leaves off and some even had quite the time gnawing on the stalk.\n\nWe spent about two hours at the park and decided to go back to Kenting Street for a late lunch. Most restaurants in Hengchun Township downtown and Kenting close between 2 and 5pm, including one that Emily recommended. We ended up eating at a mediocre Italian inspired restaurant because it was one of the only places open.\n\nAfter lunch, I was really determined to get to the southernmost part of Taiwan, Cape Eluanbi (鵝鑾鼻 , or pinyin: Éluánbí). We caught the 101 to the last stop and walked to the entrance of Eluanbi Park ($60NTD/adult). It’s also where Eluanbi Lighthouse is located. The lighthouse was built in 1883 and is one of the few examples of fortified lighthouses in the world. The walls, trench, and arms were built to defend against frequent raids by local aboriginal tribes.\n\nSurprisingly, it was drizzling in this section of Kenting, just 10-15 minute drive from Kenting Street where it was sunny. We got off the bus and I saw the most complete rainbow I had ever seen. We walked around Eluanbi Park and down to some of the lookout points. We caught a little bit of the sunset view from a pavilion until I insisted we get out of the park before it got really dark. I did not like being in the forest area without ample sunlight.\n\nWe ended up spending a little too much time in the park and just missed the 5:30 bus back to Kenting Street. We had to wait an hour for the next one, so we opted to walk 15 minutes one stop down to Shadao (砂島), which I thought had a lovely view when we first drove by. We were able to watch the rest of the sunset and the sky fade to dark there.\n\nDespite having “island” in its name, Shadao actually a small bay. It’s is an environmental protection area that contains the highest proportion of shell sand among the eight shell sand beaches in Kenting. Before being protected, the beach was heavily exploited for building and decorative materials. A large section of the beach is designated off-limits to the public in order to protect the shore and marine life, including the endangered Hawksbill turtles which breed there.\n\nDay 3\n\nWe kicked off our last day in Kenting after brunch with a bus ride to Maobitou Park (貓鼻頭). Entrance fee was $30NTD/adult. The name “Maobitou” literally means cat-nose-head, which is derived from the shape of the rocks caused by the waves beating down on them. It’s said that one rock looks like a crouching cat. John and I couldn’t see the resemblance though. Maobitou was a great place to appreciate the ocean views, much more highly recommended than Eluanbi.\n\nVisitors were a little bit of a mess at Maobitou Park. I found a set of scooter keys, which I turned into security, and was annoyed by a few stray pieces of trash people left behind. John found a Sony 4K camera resting on a rock. It blended in pretty well and I could barely see it when John first pointed it out, so we left that there in case the person came back for it soon. It wasn’t until about a half hour later that a man frantically came running up to us, asking if we had seen a camera and we led him back to the rock. He was very grateful to be reunited with it.\n\nAfter the park, we decided to go in the direction of Nanwan (南灣, or South Bay) instead of White Sand Beach (白沙灘). John had wanted to go hiking in the national park, but we got a little confused about where to get off the bus for that and decided to spend more time at the beaches.\n\nBefore getting to Nanwan, John found a well-worn path down to a little secluded alcove. He spent a lot of time observing hermit crabs while I dug around the sand to see what cool shells I could find. The sand composition was really interesting, as it was not fine and was made up of shells, pebbles, and others.\n\nAt Nanwan, I enjoyed walking on the fine white sand and watching the waves. It’s a popular beach for water activities such as snorkeling, scuba diving, and surfing. We spent some time people watching and just before we were about to leave, John and I heard a dog’s whining echoing from a tunnel. With an Australian couple’s help, we all ended up quasi-rescuing a dog that got stuck. We ended up giving the dog the courage to leap onto the sand from a ledge rather than the wakeboard they put down on the shallow but disgusting drainage water.\n\nWe took the bus back and caught a fantastic sunset at Kenting Beach. It was the clearest sunset we got to see in Kenting. There were still clouds at the edge of the horizon, so we couldn’t actually see the sun dip over, but the colors were still fantastic.\n\nWe had our last dinner at Kenting Night Market. Despite eating there for three days straight, we weren’t completely sick of the food. We had waited until the last day to grab some fresh giant river shrimp after observing where people liked to eat most and we picked a little night market stand rather than a restaurant. A large serving of six shrimp cost $320NTD. We got one of the spicy options and the flavors were SO good. I immediately wanted a second serving even though John claimed I wasn’t going to be hungry for other foods.\n\nWe went pretty hard on our last night, snacking on torched beef cubes, guava, fried cuttlefish balls, ji pai, fried squid cubes (second favorite thing at the night market), and sausage on sticky rice dogs. I’m still thinking about the giant shrimp, though.\n\nIt was a little bittersweet leaving Kenting because that meant we were creeping toward the end of our time together, but we also had our fill of beaches and wanted to see more of Taiwan. Next up: Jiufen, Houtong Cat Village, and Shifen!"
