        "text": "So, we reach the obvious question: Is Taiwan a part of China or not? Taiwan's official name is the Republic of China (ROC) but it has a complicated history.\n\nAfter World War II, ROC government representatives accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in Taiwan. The then Chief Executive of Taiwan Province Chen Yi sent a memorandum to the then Japanese governor-general of Taiwan, stating that \"As the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province of the ROC,â€¦ I restore all legal territory, people, administration, political, economic, and cultural facilities and assets of Taiwan (including the Penghu Islands).\"\n\nThe ROC Constitution was promulgated on Jan. 1, 1947, and was scheduled to take effect on Dec. 25 of that year. In March and the following months, ROC troops dispatched from mainland China suppressed a large-scale uprising of Taiwan residents.\n\nA full-scale civil war raged in China until 1949 between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang. This led to a division of Chinese territory. The ROC government relocated to Taiwan, followed by 1.2 million people from mainland China.\n\nThe CCP established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government was set up on the island of Taiwan. Both claimed to be the sole legitimate government of China.\n\nSince then, China has maintained that the island is a part of its territory and has not ruled out using military force to retake control. China has also been increasing diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan in recent years. China cut ties with Taiwan's government in 2016 after President Tsai Ing-wen refused to endorse its claim that the island and mainland together made up a single Chinese nation, with Beijing designated as the sole legitimate government."
