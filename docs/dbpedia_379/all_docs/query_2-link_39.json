        "text": "Taiwan\n\nLanguages spoken in Taiwan: Chinese.\n\nTaiwan (chin. 台湾/臺灣, Táiwān, W.-G. T'ai-wan) is an island off mainland China in the Western Pacific Ocean, separated by the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan was incorporated into the Republic of China in 1945 after the end of World War II and the defeat of the Japanese. It has formed the main part of the republic since 1949, after Chiang Kai-Shek's troops retreated to the island after losing the civil war against Mao Zedong's Red Army. At the same time, Taiwan is claimed by the People's Republic of China, but has never been controlled by it.\n\nTaiwan's rapid industrialization and economic growth during the second half of the 20th century is referred to as \"The Taiwan Miracle\" (台灣奇蹟 / 台湾奇迹, Táiwān Qíjì) or Taiwan's economic miracle. With Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong, Taiwan is one of the four \"tiger economies\".\n\nTaiwan climate\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer, which marks the climatic boundary between the tropics and subtropics, crosses Taiwan exactly at the highest elevation, Yu Shan, at 3,952 meters. Accordingly, the northern part has a subtropical climate, while the south is predominantly tropical, taking into account the climatic influence of the respective altitude. Due to the high mountains, the southern part of the country also has a temperate climate, which is mainly characterised by diurnal fluctuations.\n\nIn winter a strong monsoon blows from the northeast, in summer a strong monsoon from the southwest, which brings heavy rainfall. From May to October, the island is frequently hit by typhoons. In winter there are sporadic snowfalls at high altitudes - especially above 3,000 metres. One of the most famous places for this is Hehuanshan, located on a 3,275-meter high pass road in Nantou County. The average temperatures are 12 °C in February and 25 °C in July.\n\nOrigin of the name Taiwan\n\nThe Chinese \"taiwan\" means terraced shore and refers to the man-made rice terraces that are widespread in the country."
