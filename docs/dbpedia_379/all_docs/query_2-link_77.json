        "text": "Did you know that China province abbreviationsÂ can be made usingÂ both Chinese and English languages?\n\nNot only can all provinces in China be abbreviated to a two-letter code, but there is also a single Chinese character used to represent each.\n\nThis article introduces these methodsÂ as well asÂ providingÂ a full list of each China province abbreviation, from Anhui to Zhejiang.\n\nWhy are China Province Abbreviations Needed?\n\nFamously, the United States has a 2 letter abbreviation for each of her 50 states - think \"CA\" for California, \"NY\" for New York and \"TX\" for Texas.\n\nWhilst ChinaÂ can'tÂ quite match America's number of states, there are still 34 different provinces in China, and having an abbreviation for each certainly makes a wide range of tasksÂ easier.\n\nAlthough one method of China province abbreviation closely resembles the 2-letter system used in the United States, the most commonly used method (at least within China itself) is to have a single Chinese character to represent each province.\n\nHaving a character specific to each province helps to provide concise information, whilst saving space on many types of documents and media.\n\nCommon China Province Abbreviations\n\nThere areÂ two main methods for abbreviating Chinese province names:\n\nwith a 2-letter code\n\nusing a single Chinese character\n\nThisÂ table identifiesÂ theseÂ abbreviations for each province of China:\n\nâ\n\nMore details on eachÂ abbreviationÂ method below:\n\nChina Province Two-letter Codes\n\nThese codes are based on Chinese standardÂ GB/T 2260-2007, as used in the China-specific section of international standard ISO 3166-2.\n\nPrior to 2017, this ISO standard used 2-digit numeric codes (which we didn't consider to be abbreviations) rather than 2-letter codes, so the change is quite recent.\n\nWeÂ sometimesÂ find these abbreviations used in the URLs of Chinese government websites that are divided into different province sections, for example the various province-level company search websites.\n\nIf you areÂ working onÂ geocoding or working with some datasets you may encounter these codes, but generally speaking it is quite rare to see these two-letter abbreviations being used.\n\nChina Province Single Character Abbreviations\n\nKnown in Chinese as çä»½å«ç§° (\"province nicknames\") or çä»½ç®ç§° (\"province abbreviations\"), the single character province abbreviations are widely used and acknowledged as being a part of the Chinese language, meaning that they do not need to be defined by a standard.\n\nThey are by far the most commonly seen type of China province abbreviation within the Chinese language world in general.\n\nIndeed, just walking downÂ anyÂ street in mainland China you can easily see this type of abbreviation being utilized, as the single character abbreviations are used on vehicle registration plates to indicate the province of registration.\n\nAnother good example of their usage is on the homepage of theÂ People's Daily (the largest newspaper in China). Here they use eachÂ the single character abbreviations to give quick access to news from that province:\n\nActually you can also see province character abbreviations being used on nearly all Chinese websites if you scroll down to the footer.\n\nIn China, all websites operating with their own domain name must have ICP registration, and display their ICP registration details in their footer.Â As this system is managed at a provincial level, theÂ registration number includes the province abbreviation character.\n\nThe province character is always at the start, so using this method we can see that Adidas' China website (adidas.com.cn) is registered in Jiangsu province:\n\nAnotherÂ example we have seen of their usageÂ is the numbering of China law court records.\n\nThe characters are also frequently used just in general Chinese language, to indicate that something originates from a particular province.\n\nFor example,Â seven of China's \"8Â Great Cuisines\"Â include a province abbreviation in their widely-used Chinese name.Â\n\nOfficial China Province Names\n\nEagle-eyed readers might have noticed that many of the province names we use in the previous table are actually abbreviations themselves!\n\nThis is partly becauseÂ we haveÂ used shortened versions of their official names.\n\nBut it is also because we have used the word 'province' rather loosely. Technically-speaking the termÂ \"provincial-level administrative division\" would be more appropriate.\n\nThere are in fact only 23 official provinces in China (22 if you don't include the independently-governed island of Taiwan).\n\nIn addition to these provinces, there are also two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau), five Autonomous Regions (Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet and Xinjiang) and four Municipalities (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai and Tianjin).\n\nThis table identifies theÂ official name of each China 'province' in Simplified Chinese, Pinyin and English:\n\nâ\n\nAs you can see from the pinyin above, the names for Hong Kong (XiÄnggÇng), Inner Mongolia (NÃ¨i MÄnggÇ), Macau (ÃomÃ©n) and Tibet (XÄ«zÃ ng) are different in Mandarin ChineseÂ to English."
