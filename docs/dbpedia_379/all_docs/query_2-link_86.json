        "text": "While preparing dinner in the kitchen one day, I struggled with a pair of bamboo chopsticks that refused to let me pick up the bits of shallots that I was deep-frying. Upon closer examination, I saw that the tips of those chopsticks did not conform to each other. Then, it dawned on me that a compatible couple is akin to a pair of matching chopsticks. You can work better with your mate if both of you are able to see thngs eye to eye.\n\nThat’s easier said than done, as we all come from different families with diverse backgrounds. In particular, difficulties often arise in cross-cultural marraiges not long after the honeymoon is over. It will take a greater effort to try to fit a square to a circle, or vice versa, after the initial patience and tolerance wear out.\n\nThere are different wedding traditions and customs followed by people in different countries and localities. Up until the middle of the 20th century, most marriages in China were arranged by the parents or by the matchmakers. In many cases, the very first time the groom-to-be and the bride-to-be met each other was on their wedding night. The head and face of the bride, who was dressed all in red, would be concealed under an opaque veil. When the couple were finally by themselves in their bedroom, the groom would then have the privilege of lifting the veil. Chapter 10 of “Learn Chinese through Songs and Rhymes” features the folk song “Lift Your Veil”, in which the groom admires the beauty of the bride he has just uncovered (and with which you can learn how to form descriptive phrases in Chinese). It wasn’t until 1950 when China passed the New Marriage Law, which made arranged marriages and concubines illegal.\n\n现在, 一般来说，情侣是自己或通过朋友认识的.\n\nXiànzài, yībān lái shuō, qínglǚ shì zìjǐ huò tōngguò péngyǒu rènshí de.\n\nAt present, generally a couple meet each other by themselves or through friends.\n\n他们相识并相爱.\n\nTāmen xiāngshí bìng xiāng’ài.\n\nThey get acqainted and fall in love.\n\n通常都是由男方向女方求婚.\n\nTōngcháng dōu shì yóu nán fāngxiàng nǚfāng qiúhūn.\n\nNormally, it’s the man who proposes to the woman.\n\n他们会寻求父母的同意和祝福.\n\nTāmen huì xúnqiú fùmǔ de tóngyì hé zhùfú.\n\nThey will seek their parents’ approval and blessing.\n\n然后, 他们订婚了.\n\nRánhòu, tāmen dìnghūnle.\n\nThen, they get engaged.\n\n按照台湾习俗, 男方要赠送聘金给女方家长.\n\nÀnzhào táiwān xísú, nánfāng yào zèngsòng pìnjīn gěi nǚfāng jiāzhǎng.\n\nBy the Taiwanese custom, the man will present the bride’s parents with betrothal money.\n\n准新娘通常会给新家庭带来珠宝,\n\nZhǔn xīnniáng tōngcháng huì gěi xīn jiātíng dài lái zhūbǎo,\n\nThe bride-to-be usually brings to the new family her dowry in the form of jewelry,\n\n家具和/或电器等嫁妆.\n\njiājù hé/huò diànqì děng jiàzhuāng.\n\nfurniture and/or appliances.\n\n男方会为女方订购盒装礼饼或者蛋糕,\n\nNánfāng huì wèi nǚfāng dìnggòu hé zhuāng lǐ bǐng huòzhě tián dàngāo,\n\nThe man will order boxed gift cookies or cakes for the woman’s family\n\n以分发给女方所有的亲戚.\n\nyǐ fēnfā gěi nǚfāng suǒyǒu de qīnqī.\n\nto distribute to all of the woman’s relatives.\n\n结婚当天, 新郎和新娘将交换誓言和戒指.\n\nJiéhūn dàngtiān, xīnláng hé xīnniáng jiāng jiāohuàn shìyán hé jièzhǐ.\n\nOn the day they get married, the groom and the bride will exchange vows and rings.\n\n婚宴费用由男方家人支付.\n\nHūnyàn fèiyòng yóu nánfāng jiārén zhīfù.\n\nThe wedding banquet will be paid for by the groom’s family.\n\n参加婚宴的宾客都会携带装有现金的红包作为礼物.\n\nCānjiā hūnyàn de bīnkè dūhuì xiédài zhuāng yǒu xiànjīn de hóngbāo zuòwéi lǐwù.\n\nGuests attending the wedding banquet will bring as gifts red envelopes containing cash.\n\n然后就是蜜月期.\n\nRánhòu jiùshì mìyuè qī.\n\nThen comes the honeymoon.\n\n从此他们过着幸福的生活.\n\nCóngcǐ tāmenguòzhe xìngfú de shēnghuó.\n\nAnd they lived happily ever after.\n\n当然, 这只会在童话故事里发生.\n\nDāngrán, zhè zhǐ huì zài tónghuà gùshì li fāshēng.\n\nOf course, this only happens in fairy tales.\n\n婚姻是终身的伙伴关系.\n\nHūnyīn shì zhōngshēn de huǒbàn guānxì.\n\nMarriage is a lifelong partnership.\n\n成功的婚姻是由爱, 信任, 尊重, 忠诚,\n\nChénggōng de hūnyīn shì yóu ài, xìnrèn, zūnzhòng, zhōngchéng,\n\nA successful marriage is nurtured by love, trust, respect, faithfulness,\n\n宽容和合作孕育出来的.\n\nkuānróng hé hézuò yùnyù chūlái de.\n\ntolerance and cooperation.\n\n令人遗憾的是, 许多婚姻以离婚告终.\n\nLìng rén yíhàn de shì, xǔduō hūnyīn yǐ líhūn gàozhōng.\n\nIt’s regrettable that many marriages end in divorce.\n\nI cannot but heave a sigh in admiration and disbelief when I read about the sweet couple featured in the humorous story “What The Old Man Does Is Always Right“, written by the Danish author Hans Christian Anderson. Click on the above link to watch an animated presentation of this story in Chinese. I suggest that you play the video at 0.75 times the normal speed so that you will be able to hear the Chinese voice-over more clearly.\n\n正如我所说, 这只会在童话故事里发生.\n\nZhèngrú wǒ suǒ shuō, zhè zhǐ huì zài tónghuà gùshì li fāshēng.\n\nJust as I said, this can only happen in fairy tales.\n\n祝福所有六月新娘!\n\nZhùfú suǒyǒu liù yuè xīnniáng!\n\nBlessings to all the June brides!\n\n并祝父亲节快乐！\n\nBìng zhù fùqīn jié kuàilè!\n\nAnd I wish you a Happy Father’s Day!\n\nAs if there weren’t already so many words to learn in Chinese, we must also be able to deal with abbreviations that are thrown at us from time to time, especially by news reporters, who must deliver vast amount of information within a very short time.\n\nMany of the Chinese abbreviations, or 简称 (jiǎnchēng), are sort of like acronyms. When a word is made up of two or more other multi-character words, often a new word is formed by combining the initial character of each of the constituent words. For example,\n\n今早 (jīnzǎo) stands for 今天早晨 (jīntiān zǎochén this morning); 明早 (míngzǎo) stands for 明天早晨 (míngtiān zǎochén tomorrow morning).\n\nHey, aren’t you glad that spring has sprung? 今春 (jīnchūn) stands for 今年春天 (jīnnián chūntiān this spring); 明春 (míng chūn) stands for 明年春天 (míngnián chūntiān next spring).\n\n流感 (liúgǎn) refers to 流行感冒 (liúxíng gǎnmào, influenza); 股市 (gǔshì) refers to 股票市场 (gǔpiào shìchǎng, stock market).\n\n台湾大学 (Táiwān Dàxué National Taiwan University) is abbreviated as 台大 (Táidà).\n\n中学 (zhōngxué) is middle school. 女子中学 (nǚzǐ zhōngxué) is abbreviated as 女中 (nǚ zhōng).\n\n高中 (gāozhōng) is high school. A girls high school is called 女高 (nǚ gāo).\n\nObsiously, any word that starts wtih 国 has something to do with a country or nation.\n\n国防 (guófáng) is short for 国家防卫 (guójiā fángwèi, national defense).\n\n国小 (guó xiǎo) is short for 国民小学 (guómín xiǎoxué, national elementary school).\n\n内宣 (nèi xuān) is short for 内部宣传 (nèibù xuānchuán, internal propaganda).\n\n外宣 (wài xuān) is short for 外部宣传 (wàibù xuānchuán, external propaganda, or publicity).\n\nThe Chinese transliteration of most of the foreign country names are a mouthful. Luckily we mostly refer to these countries by their abbreviated names. For example:\n\nUnited States of America 美利坚合众国 (Měilìjiān hézhòngguó) is shortened to 美国 (Měiguó).\n\nChina 中华人民共和国 (Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó) is 中国 (Zhōngguó).\n\nGreat Britain 大不列颠 (Dàbùlièdiān) is 英国 (Yīngguó).\n\nFrance 法兰西 (Fǎlánxī) is 法国 (Fǎguó).\n\nWhen talking about two or more countries, each will usually be represented by just one character, as shown below.\n\n台美半导体会议 (Tái Měi bàndǎotǐ huìyì, Taiwan American Semiconductor Conference)\n\n中美贸易 (Zhōng Měi màoyì, Sino-U.S. Trade)\n\nFor Hong Kong 香港 (xiānggǎng), the second character is chosen for the abbreviation, as in 台港关系 (Tái gǎng guānxì, Taiwan-Hong Kong relations).\n\n欧盟 (ōuméng) stands for 欧洲联盟 (ōuzhōu liánméng, European Union).\n\n公共 (gōnggòng) means shared by the public, and 公用 (gōngyòng) means for public use. Therefore, a bus is called 公共汽车 (gōnggòngqìchē), or 公车 (gōngchē) for short. Similarly, 公园 (gōngyuán) is short for 公共花园 (gōnggòng huāyuán, a public garden or a park), and 公厕 (gōngcè) is short for 公共厕所 (gōnggòng cèsuǒ, public restroom).\n\n公公 (gōnggōng) is the father-in-law and 婆婆 (pópo) is the mother-in-law, whereas 公婆 (gōngpó) refers to both of them. Similarly, 父母 (fùmǔ) means parents, i.e. 父亲 (fùqīn, father) and 母亲 (mǔqīn, mother).\n\n家用电器 (jiāyòngdiànqì, household appliance) is abbreviated as 家电 (jiādiàn).\n\n驾驶执照 (jiàshǐ zhízhào, driver’s license) is abbreviated as 驾照 (jiàzhào).\n\n空气调节 (kōngqì tiáojié, air conditioning) is abbreviated as 空调 (kòngtiáo).\n\n空中运输 (kōngzhōng yùnshū, air transportation) is abbreviated as 空运 (kōngyùn).\n\n世运会 (Shìyùnhuì) is short for 世界运动会 (Shìjiè yùndònghuì World Games).\n\nOften some other (more significant) characters, rather than the initial characters, in the constituent words are selected to form the abbreviation, as shown in the following examples.\n\n汽车 (qìchē) are cars. Vehicle license plates are called 汽车牌照 (qìchē páizhào), or 车牌 (chēpái).\n\n厨具 (chújù) stands for 厨房用具 (chúfáng yòngjù, kitchen utensils).\n\n糕饼 (gāobǐng) covers the sweet treats, such as 蛋糕 (dàngāo, cakes) and 饼干 (bǐnggān, cookies).\n\n学校 (xuéxiào) are schools. Here, the second character is the one that designates the educational institution and is used for the following abbreviations:\n\n校园 (xiàoyuán) is the school compound.\n\n校花 (xiàohuā) is the generally acknowledged prettiest girl of a school.\n\n校车 (xiàochē) is a school bus.\n\n校长 (xiàozhǎng) is the principal.\n\n专科学校 (zhuānkē xuéxiào) is a specialized school, such as a technical college. It is abbreviated as 专校 (zhuān xiào).\n\nFinally, the four-character Chinese idioms are the ultimate in abbreviations. As we have seen in my previous blog post about 塞翁失馬 (sāiwēngshīmǎ), there can be a long story behind some of those pithy expressions."
