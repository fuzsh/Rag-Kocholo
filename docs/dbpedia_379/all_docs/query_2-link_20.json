        "text": "\"An indispensable guide for readers traveling to Taiwan for vacation, work, or school. It’s chock-full of information that will help people successfully navigate the country.\" -Library Journal\n\nTaiwan has always been an attractive place to study and work. In fact, long before Mainland China became an option for Westerners, Taiwan was the place to study Chinese and work in a Mandarin Chinese speaking environment. As the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.) gained economic and political strength in the world, Westerners naturally gravitated toward this new market. Language programs and jobs for Westerners flourished. In the past decade there has been a renewed interest in Taiwan. This is undoubtedly due to a dramatic increase in cost of living in the P.R.C., increasing government regulation and scrutiny of foreigners, the increased political tension between China and the West, and generally the increasing difficulty doing business and studying in China in a free and fair way.\n\nIn recent years Taiwan has once again emerged as an attractive place to study, work, and live. Taiwan offers a free, open, and safe environment that is welcoming to outsiders. While the cost of living in Taiwan’s big cities is about the same as the big cities in Mainland China, it is much easier for a foreigner to navigate than in China.\n\nThis book provides a practical, up-to-date, hands-on guide to navigating life in Taiwan. It is not a travel guidebook, but rather provides detailed information for the foreign resident in Taiwan, whether they be studying or working. It provides a wealth of information covering everything from renting apartments, taking care of your daily needs, what and where to eat, to Taiwanese work ethic and business culture, how to make the most of your study of Chinese, how to get around, and so on. The book is illustrated with relevant photos that contextualize the text, and enhance reader’s understanding of the information.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter 1: Why Taiwan?\n\nWhat Is Unique About Taiwan?\n\nDeep Chinese Culture\n\nForeign Influence on Taiwan\n\nTaiwan’s Religious Atmosphere\n\nTaiwan Is Compact but Varied\n\nHow Is Taiwan Different than Mainland China?\n\nThe Chinese Language in Taiwan\n\nStudying Chinese in Taiwan\n\nTaiwan Has a Different Vibe\n\nTaiwan Is Easy for Travelers and Students\n\nHighlights of Taiwan History\n\nEndnotes\n\nChapter 2: Who Lives in Taiwan?\n\nTaiwanese Aboriginals and Austronesian Languages\n\nOutsiders\n\nHakka kèjiā rén (客家人) and Their Language\n\nTaiwanese táiwān rén (台灣人) and Southern Min Language mǐnnán huà (閩南話)\n\nBěnshěng rén (本省人) vs. Wàishěng rén (外省人)\n\nChinese zhōngguó rén (中國人) or Taiwanese táiwān rén (台灣人)\n\nInsiders vs. Outsiders\n\nNew Residents xīnzhù mín (新住民) and Their Languages\n\nFitting in as A Foreigner in Taiwan\n\nCulture Shock and Dealing with Change\n\nThe Honeymoon Stage\n\nThe Negotiation Stage\n\nThe Adjustment Stage\n\nThe Mastery Stage\n\nEndnotes\n\nChapter 3: Getting around in Taiwan\n\nFlying in and out of Taiwan\n\nOther Transportation Options\n\nTaiwan High Speed Rail/HSR (táiwān gāotiě 台灣高鐵)\n\nTaiwan Railway (táiwān tiělù台灣鐵路)\n\nVia Highways\n\nInter-city Bus (guódào kèyùn 國道客運)\n\nDriving in Taiwan\n\nFantastic Highway Rest Stations\n\nTaiwan’s Metro System (jiéyùn捷運)\n\nTaipei Metro (Taipei Mass Rapid Transit or MRT, táiběi jiéyùn台北捷運)\n\nThe EasyCard (yōuyóu kǎ 悠遊卡)\n\nPublic Busses (gōngchē 公車)\n\nBicycles\n\nBicycling Infrastructure in Taiwan\n\nScooters, Scooters, and More Scooters (mótuōchē 摩托車)\n\nTaxis (jìchéng chē 計程車)\n\nTravel to Taiwan’s Outlying Islands\n\nChapter 4: Taiwan’s Food Scene\n\nTaiwan Food as Regional Cuisine\n\nTaiwan’s Take on Chinese Food\n\nTainan, Taiwan’s Traditional Sweet Tooth Capital\n\nTaiwan’s Fusion Cuisine: Japanese, Western, Southeast Asian\n\nTaiwan’s Street Food Phenomenon xiǎochī (小吃)\n\nTaiwan’s Amazing Fruit\n\nWhat Is for Breakfast?\n\nConvenience Store Food and Fast Food\n\nTaiwan’s Fast Food Chains\n\nThe Taiwan Box Lunch, biàndāng (便當)\n\nEating Hot Pot, huǒguō (火鍋)\n\nVegetarian Cuisine in Taiwan\n\nTaiwan’s Tea Culture\n\nHow to Eat Well in Taiwan\n\nEating in a Chinese Restaurant\n\nHow to Make Sense of a Chinese Menu càidān (菜單)\n\nHow a Dish Is Prepared\n\nHow the Ingredients Are Cut\n\nEndnotes\n\nChapter 5: Living in Taiwan\n\nHousing Overview\n\nOn-Campus vs. Off\n\nHotels\n\nLong-term Residence in Taiwan\n\nTaking Care of Daily Needs\n\nPost Offices\n\nConvenience Stores\n\nCoffee Shops\n\nBanking and Money\n\nPhones and Sim Cards\n\nTrash and Recycling Collection\n\nPublic Toilets\n\nThe 7-ELEVEN Effect in Taiwan\n\nHealth and Safety\n\nNational Holidays\n\nUseful Apps and Social Media\n\nEndnotes\n\nChapter 6: Studying in Taiwan\n\nThe Value of Education in Taiwanese Society\n\nTraditional Asian Paradigms about Education\n\nTaiwan’s University System\n\nWhy Study in Taiwan\n\nWhere to Study Chinese\n\nMaking the Most of Your Time in Taiwan\n\nHow to Make the Most of Your Chinese Language Studies\n\nEndnotes\n\nChapter 7: Working and Interning in Taiwan\n\nHow to Land an Internship or Job?\n\nIndustry-Academic Collaboration\n\nJob Searching Websites\n\nTaiwan’s LinkedIn\n\n1111 人力銀行 (1111 rénlì yínháng, 1111 human power bank)\n\n104 人力銀行 (104 rénlì yínháng, 104 human power bank)\n\nThrough Connections (guānxi 關係)\n\nTaiwanese Business Culture\n\nStrategies to Make the Most of Your Work/Internship\n\nEndnotes\n\nChapter 8: Taiwan’s Diverse Geography\n\nTaipei and Northern Taiwan\n\nTaichung and Western Taiwan\n\nHualien and Eastern Taiwan\n\nTainan, Kaohsiung, and Southern Taiwan\n\nOutlying Islands\n\nEndnotes\n\nThis title by Christensen and Yang is a concise but thorough overview of the people, the languages (more than 20 are spoken there), and the history of Taiwan, including a timeline from 239 AD to 2017. Taiwan offers an affordable rapid transit system, called MRT, that makes getting around easy and accessible for first-time visitors. Attractions such as shopping districts, gorges, and beaches are highlighted too. But the authors emphasize that their book isn’t intended to be a travel guide. Instead, they give practical advice for daily living in Taiwan, such as where to live, eat, and work. Readers who are thinking about working or studying in Taiwan will find, for example, information on workplace etiquette and strategies for landing an internship. There are tips for how to visit the numerous food stalls in Taiwanese markets, plus charts of the country’s top night-market dishes and breakfast foods. The cultural differences among Taiwan’s four regions are explained as well. An indispensable guide for readers traveling to Taiwan for vacation, work, or school. It’s chock-full of information that will help people successfully navigate the country.\n\n— Library Journal\n\nThis book provides an invaluable resource for foreigners coming to Taiwan to study and work. It covers all the basic information they would need to really enjoy their time in Taiwan.\n\n— Nicole Yen-Yi Lee, Director General of the Department of International and Cross-strait Education, Ministry of Education, Taiwan\n\nI found this book to be highly relevant and pertinent to anyone coming to Taiwan. It does a great job introducing everyday life in Taiwan with all its complexities. Reading this will indeed expand the readers understanding of everything Taiwan.\n\n— Director General Yvonne Hsiao, Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Houston\n\nAs the title promises, the book informs the reader about many aspects of Taiwan, whether the reader might be going there to study, work, or travel, and is full of good suggestions and advice. It is a good read for anyone going to Taiwan for the first time or for repeated visits. The tables at the end of the book, of the Chinese words used in the text, should come in very handy as you navigate Taiwan.\n\n— Camilla H. Hsieh, professor (retired), University of Texas at Austin"
