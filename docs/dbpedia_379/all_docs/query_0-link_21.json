        "text": "'Tâi-gí' the ethnolinguistic name for Taiwanese has been used for more than one hundred years in Taiwan. However, it has not always been politically and officially approved by the government, the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. In contrast, 'Southern Min' is officially adopted by the ROC to refer to the language Taiwanese. 'Min' is the abbreviation of Hokkien province in China. In addition, it is a pejorative name with the meaning 'barbarians with snake origin,' according to Chinese classical dictionaries. In response to ROC's racial discrimination against Taiwanese-speaking people, around 40 Taiwanese organizations protested against the ROC in July 2009. The purpose of this paper is to survey the controversy over the term 'Tâi-gí' from the perspective of sociolinguistics and political science. It is suggested that 'Southern Min' be replaced by 'Taiwanese' when referring to varieties spoken in Taiwan, and by 'Lán-lâng-ōe' when referring to all varieties spoken in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asian countries.\n\nThe first part of this chapter provides a retrospective on a previous research project that led to the publication of my book Written Taiwanese in 2005. The description of the project’s genesis and the book contents centers on three questions. By asking how, I recapitulate my attempt to provide as accurate a description as possible of how the Taiwanese language was written in the past and present. The question why addresses the ideological dimensions of writing Taiwanese in the periods of Japanese colonialism and political liberalization in the late 20th century. By asking who, I shift the focus towards the persons behind the writing of Taiwanese, i.e. language activists, writers and lexicographers pushing for the standardization of written Taiwanese. In the remainder of the chapter, the questions why and who are placed into broader comparative perspective by analyzing them in the contexts of language ideology, language activism, agency in language planning, and language purism. I finally look at the current situation of written Taiwanese and argue that governmental language planning today, like 20 years ago, has not led to the standardization of Taiwanese.\n\nThis work is based on an online survey, submitted to inquire about Taiwanese people linguistics’ ideology and identity, in order to collect direct data on the view that Taiwanese people have on their languages. The aim of the work is to analyze the historical facts and the linguistic policies that in history changed deeply the current situation of Taiwan languages. After a brief explanation on the history of Taiwan and the languages of Taiwan, the paper will try to underline the political use of the languages during the Japanese imperialist period and the following period of Guo Ming Tang rules, taking in partial consideration to the historical, social and cultural aspects that could have influence on nowadays socio-linguistic Taiwan panorama, such education policies, economy and development of the land. The concept of 国語 (Jap: kokugo, chn: guoyu), was considered fundamental to better understand where Japanese before and Guo Ming Tang later, failed and succeeded and how these policies are reflect on the view that Taiwanese people have on their languages now. The data collected though the online survey was fundamental and are considered as the most direct sources to analyze Taiwanese people point of view and beliefs toward their languages and identity. In conclusion, the work will try to expose possible linguistic policies to adopt in order to preserve local languages that are (in this paper) considered fundamental aspects to preserve the unicity of the Taiwanese culture and identity. The advantage being a better understanding of how the use of a multicultural education could be positive to Taiwan’s future. From this papers point of view, Taiwan could represent a positive example of the possible advancement in multicultural cooperation that a multi lingual and multi-ethnic country education can offer, if government and population support this idea.\n\nWhile World Englishes scholarship has always been concerned with different types of English varieties, Expanding Circle (i.e., non-postcolonial) Englishes have had a ‘late start’ in being added to its research remit. As a result, much important work in this area remains to be done. Expanding Circle Englishes in general and Asian Expanding Circle Englishes in particular are still neglected in many handbooks of World Englishes (e.g., in The Cambridge Handbook of World Englishes; Schreier, Hundt & Schneider, 2020). Notable exceptions here are, for example, The Routledge Handbook of World Englishes (Kirkpatrick, 2020; including, among others, chapters on Japanese, Chinese, and Slavic Englishes) and The Handbook of Asian Englishes (Bolton, Botha & Kirkpatrick, 2020; including, among others, chapters on Taiwanese, Cambodian, and Indonesian Englishes). While traditionally much focus has been laid on matters of language policies, education, and attitudes, corpus linguistic approaches to Exp...\n\nThe Han sphere, including Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China, adopted Han characters and classical Han writing as the official written language before the 20th century. However, great changes came with the advent of the 20th century. After World War II, Han characters in Vietnam and Korea were officially replaced by the romanised Chu Quoc Ngu and phonemic Hangul, respectively. In Japan, the number of Han characters in use decreased, and the syllabic Kana system was promoted to a national status. In Taiwan, although Taiwanese romanisation was developed centuries ago, Han characters remain the dominant orthography in current Taiwanese society. This paper examines Taiwan's orthographic transition from the perspective of the Han sphere. Both internal and external factors have contributed to the different outcomes of orthographic reform in these countries. Internal factors include the general public's demand for literacy and anti-feudal hierarchy. External factors include the political relationships between these countries and the origin of Han characters (i.e. China)."
