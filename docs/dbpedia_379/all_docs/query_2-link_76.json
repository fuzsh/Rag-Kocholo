        "text": "One day, about a year and half ago when I first arrived in Taiwan with the intention of settling here, I was walking through the Taipei neighborhood I would eventually call home with a person who would eventually become one of my best friends here. He wasn’t impressed.\n\n“Aren’t these buildings hideous?” he remarked. We were traipsing past an especially rundown housing block, its concrete periphery rust-stained, its tile front gleaming, but hued unflatteringly nonetheless.\n\nHe explained how the KMT — the Kuomintang, who during the Chinese Civil War opposed the thugs who would eventually become the Communist Party of China — did not flee to Taiwan with the intention of settling here. “They weren’t meant to be permanent, and it’s clear why.”\n\nOr at least that’s how I remember it. Sean, during what would be our second-to-last meeting about 10 days ago, vociferously denied ever having said this — or, at least, disputed the historical accuracy of my recollection.\n\n“But I do think KMT buildings are hideous,” he conceded as we looked out over a panorama of the city from Xiangshan Mountain, noting the quasi-Chinese design elements adorning even the famous Taipei 101 skyscraper, which gleamed under the dim sun of the first day of autumn.\n\n(I happen to think Taipei is a beautiful city, even down its ugliest alleys.)\n\nTo be clear, I am leaving Taipei today — I am leaving Taiwan today — not because of any particular problem with the city, aesthetically or otherwise. I am leaving not because of any deficiency in my friends or friendships, any issue with my quality of life or because, out of all the many reasons I adore Taipei, Taiwan and the Taiwanese, I find the country’s food to be painfully overrated.\n\nI am leaving Taiwan today because I have no other choice. Because, like so many people in the wake of Communist China unleashing a virus on our species, I have almost no choices, certainly none of the ones I enjoyed before about six months ago.\n\nAt that time — the last week of March; the first week of spring — I had a big choice to make: Take my annual sakura trip to Japan; or hunker down in Taiwan, which had just announced that its borders would be closed indefinitely to newly arriving foreign visitors, thereby locking me out in the event that I boarded my flight to Osaka-Kansai.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to choose: Since most of my income the past three years has come from my dedicated Japan website, I knew canceling would inflict long-term financial damage, the interim personal pain and disappointment notwithstanding. But choose I did, after far too much wrought deliberation for a man of my age, and I chose Taiwan.\n\nI have never let Taiwan forget that, not for a single day.\n\nTo put it another way — to put it a blunter way — I’ve spent much of the time that has since passed embittered. Disdainful. Mired in self-doubt. Regretful, and obsessively second-guessing the decision I knew from the moment I made it was the correct one. (Especially given that in late March, like many you I’m sure, I did not imagine the world would still be fully in the grips of the pandemic by early October.)\n\nPart of why I decided to relocate here from Thailand, after all, was Taiwan’s proximity to Japan and other Asian countries where I had pressing professional interests, but where I didn’t want to or couldn’t reside. Taipei, more than a place to call home, was a place to come to home to. And I did love coming home to my beautiful apartment in the Zhongzheng district, at least until it became a beautiful prison.\n\nSince the day the borders (and not just Taiwan’s: All of Asia’s; most of the world’s) slammed shut, I have denied myself happiness, consciously and unconsciously, and often zapped it from the very people whose affection and affectations inspired me to remain in this country in the first place. I’ve sucked the life out of entire rooms, and even open spaces!\n\nOne night in June, Sean and I were at Café Dalida (whose al fresco tables hosted a surprising number of foreigners, given the border closure), with a mutual acquaintance — a friend of his, a fuck buddy of mine — and a bunch of total strangers. And a troupe of drag queens, whose names literally every person at the bar except me knew.\n\nI had met Sean earlier that evening in surrounding Ximen for a bowl of niu rou mian. I never expected we would have a drink afterwards: Sean, for as long as I’d known him, had been a teetotaler. But there we were! In normal times, I’d have been drunk (or maybe wasted) and grinning from ear to ear.\n\nInstead, I was slowly sucking down a vodka soda, so comatose by the time the fabulous female impersonator strutted over to me that she literally pulled up the corners of my mouth to turn my frown upside down. It was jarring — the older I get, the less I like being touched unexpectedly — and it was humiliating, even though I’m sure that she (and Sean and Chih-Wei and all the total strangers there) didn’t waste another second of thought on it.\n\nI was in paradise — I was out at a crowded gay bar in a huge city without a mask in June of 2020, when much of the rest of the world was in some form of lockdown — but I felt like I was in purgatory.\n\nNone of which is to say I didn’t try to see the bright side — or, when I couldn’t see one, that I didn’t try to create it. My quasi-social life in Taipei notwithstanding, I’ve spent the past half-year exploring Taiwan far more deeply than most foreigners ever do.\n\nFrankly, I’ve explored Taiwan more deeply than most Taiwanese ever do, at least those to whom I’ve explained my various excursions around the island. Many had never been to famous Alishan in the southern-central part of the country’s mountainous interior, or had only visited Taroko Gorge just inland from the East Coast city of Hualien during their childhood or adolescence. Almost none had visited the Kinmen Islands, let alone knew that they were so close to the city of Xiamen that you can see China from your (guest) house.\n\nI created an entire niche website as a result of my decision to dive deep into Taiwan — my decision, more broadly speaking than that, to stay in Taiwan. I hope, one day sooner rather than later, English-speaking foreigners (including you, maybe) are able to enter Taiwan and take advantage of the substantial research I’ve done.\n\nThis — the nebulousness of the future, and ambiguity about when, how and whether a future worth believing in will ever re-materialize — sits at the root of why I chose to suffer anxiously through so much of my last half-year in Taiwan, instead of living serenely in what shouldn’t been a priceless and propitious set of present moments.\n\nNow, I’m fortunate enough to have amassed a large nest egg over my past several, successful years, and to know (from the times when I wasn’t so successful) how to stretch cash that covers a year’s worth of living expenses to cover two or three. Money, for basically the first time in my life, is not the issue; I will be just fine (certainly, better off than most of my colleagues, many of whom have already jumped ship) in the long run.\n\nBut the inevitable follow-up question I’ve found myself asking is where and whether I can possibly find the meaning I derived from my erstwhile occupation — the passion I turned into a profession — while I wait for the rest of the world to catch up to Taiwan, for the rest of the world (to use a phrase that’s now verboten in woke circles) to “go back to normal.”\n\n(I haven’t yet come up with an answer. About my life’s meaning, this is: The world will go back to normal, probably sooner than many Branch Covidians expect.)\n\nThe Taiwanese government, for its part, has been extraordinarily generous during this unprecedented period of uncertainty. (Well, except for denying my application for an Alien Resident Certificate.) Indeed, by extending — automatically — my 90-day landing permission to 120, then to 150, then to 180 and, finally, to 210 days, Taiwan has done far more than I ever could’ve asked or expected to provide me a safe, stable place to figure my shit out.\n\nI learned recently that yet another extension had been approved; I could’ve stayed another month, had I simply informed my landlady on September 15 that the move-out notice I gave her on September 11 was null and void, due to recent good news.\n\nBut just as I was clear about the fact that my best course of action back in March was to stay, I have no doubt that now is the time to leave. (I happen to know a thing or two about leaving.)\n\nAs I sit in my near-empty apartment, and try to go about my business as normally as possible until Mrs. Huang arrives at 6 PM to take my keys away forever, I’m thinking back on all the goodbyes I’ve said in recent days. I’m thinking about Sean and Chih-Wei and all the other friends and flings whose sweetness and specialness and intellect and complexity — every single one of them — I could write a book about.\n\nThe strange part is that none of them seem like goodbyes, when I think back on them, even though some (in particular the one last night, with someone I think could love me if I ever gave him the chance) were painful at the time. This makes sense in a Taiwanese way, of course, since the Chinese word for “goodbye” — 再見, Zàijiàn — literally translates to “see again.”\n\nI will see Taiwan again. I will see Sean again, and we will once again walk the streets of Taipei — hideous to him, handsome to me — and look out onto panoramic cityscape, hopefully with more airplanes soaring above the spire of Taipei 101.\n\nI will see all my friends and flings (hopefully only the ones who deserve it) in the future, once the entry ban that has shackled the people of the freest country in Asia lifts, once the nightmare we’re all living through evaporates to reveal the dreams we’ve all allowed our collective trauma to obscure.\n\nFor now, I have to follow Gandhi’s advice, to become the change I want to see in the world. A world which, quite frankly, is doing little to defeat the coronavirus or even to confront the reality of it. The civilized world (and the “experts” who now rule over us by fiat) has instead acted to kick the can down the road, to delay inevitable infections and deaths while making miserable the lives of those — a huge majority…no, a near-totality of the human race — who never would’ve succumbed to the scourge, no matter what course of action had been taken.\n\nIt was always inevitable that I would have to leave Taiwan — well, at least since August, when I learned that my ARC was not going to be approved. I’ve chosen, however, to de-couple on my own terms. To say Zàijiàn, and to retain some semblance of joy (some semblance of dignity!) and the carefree reality I once lived in, rather than waiting for fate to befall me, and then leaving embittered and angry, my tail between my legs, my heart macerated under my own muddy, bloody boots.\n\nI am not, as a visiting Czech dignitary recently said to great fanfare (in a not-subtle reference to JFK’s “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech), Taiwanese. But I felt like an honorary Táiwān rén at many points over the 18 months I called this wonderful, perfectly imperfect country my home. I’m not sure I’ll ever come to terms with all the magical moments I missed while I was feeling sorry for myself, or all the happiness I allowed to dissolve down the drain of depression. But I do know one thing for certain, and I say it both to Taiwan, as a collective, and to everyone I have loved (and who has loved me) during my time here:\n\nWe will meet again when the world is free again."
