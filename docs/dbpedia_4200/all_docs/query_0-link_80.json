        "text": "He spent his youth harvesting crops before training, and Cengiz Under has also cultivated an exciting football career that’s seen him tipped for the top by Roma legend Francesco Totti and is now bringing him to pastures new in the Premier League.\n\nUnder is set to complete a season-long loan move, with an option of a permanent transfer totalling £25 million, from Roma to Leicester City in the coming days, reuniting the 23-year-old with Turkey international team-mate and close friend Caglar Soyuncu, who he has known since they first met as teenagers at Altinordu in the Turkish second tier.\n\nAs part of their apprentice chores, the players would tend a vegetable garden, picking tomatoes, peppers and aubergines that would be served at team meals, and look after the club’s animals, even milking cows, goats and sheep.\n\nThat early bond at Izmir-based Altinordu, where they spent two seasons together between 2014 and 2016, has grown through the national-team age groups. Under and Soyuncu, who regularly holiday together, are now about to be team-mates again at Leicester as Brendan Rodgers continues to strengthen his squad.\n\n“Cengiz wasn’t even 17 when he first played for the first team,” says Turkish journalist Fatih Demireli. “Soyuncu was also very young when he broke through at Altinordu and those early days had a major impact on both of them.\n\n“You have to understand that it is not easy for young talents in Turkey to break through, because the clubs are usually so focused on short-term success that they prefer to rely on experienced players. But both were so focused on their own success that they never followed the calls of joining Galatasaray, Fenerbahce or Besiktas. They knew that credit is not high (with those three clubs) in Istanbul and that they may disappear from the scene if they do not become top performers immediately.\n\n“Caglar went to (Germany’s) Freiburg (then to Leicester), Cengiz to (Istanbul) Basaksehir and then on to Roma. If there is a little more courage for young players in Turkey today, it is also due to Cengiz and Caglar.”\n\nUnder was born in Sindirgi, a town near Balikesir in western Turkey. He was 10 when he left home and joined Izmir club Bucaspor.\n\n“At the beginning, living away from home without my family was far from easy,” he told the official AS Roma website last year. “After a while, the club president brought my mother out to where I was. She and my father were separated and he stayed where we all used to live.\n\n“I was a very relaxed child and only had eyes for football. I had no doubts when I started playing — I had one target. I didn’t think about anything else — becoming a professional was all I wanted. I was the first youngster in my town to leave in order to play football far from home. Bucaspor hadn’t ever brought a youngster in from outside the local area. That’s where they’d usually find their talent. It wasn’t all down to me, however. I’m grateful to all those who’ve supported me.”\n\nEven at his tender age, he was considered too good for his age group and played up a level. As a 15-year-old, he joined Altinordu and then in 2016 moved on to Basaksehir, where he attracted the attention of Roma. Altinordu would profit from their youth cultivation as they received €4.5 million from Under’s €15 million transfer to Roma a year later and they also gained €6.25 million from Soyuncu’s £19 million move to Leicester from Freiburg in summer 2018.\n\nAlthough his name means “unbeatable”, Under was known in Turkey as “Speedy Cengiz” because of his blistering pace both with and without the ball. Predominantly left-footed, he originally was used on the left flank at Basaksehir, mainly because their right winger Edin Visca was considered one of the best in the Superliga.\n\nOff the field at Basaksehir, manager Abdullah Avci noticed that, even after six months in Istanbul, Under was still living on the club grounds, so he urged his player to get out and experience more of the city, try different restaurants and meet more people.\n\n“I told Cengiz to go to the Italian,” Avci said after Under’s move to Roma. “What is he doing? He went to Italy!”\n\nArriving in the Italian capital at just 20, and another emotional farewell to his family, he lived with a friend who helped him acclimatise. He also settled into a role on Roma’s right flank and his pace and directness, and notoriety for scoring long-distance goals, impressed their then-manager Eusebio Di Francesco.\n\n“He has this great ability for getting shots off,” Di Francesco says. “Cengiz is able to keep you guessing as to when exactly he’s going to shoot. He hides it. It’s a skill I remember (former Roma and Italy striker Vincenzo) Montella having.”\n\nHis displays early on in his Roma career also caught the eye of club icon Totti, who gave him the ultimate seal of approval in an Instagram chat with his old Italy team-mate Christian Vieri. “He can kick the ball from a standstill like (ex-Inter Milan star Alvaro) Recoba used to,” Totti says. “It’s really impressive to watch. He takes on defenders, runs in behind. Cengiz can become a top player.”\n\nThe problem for Under, who says Lionel Messi, David Silva and David Villa were his idols, was that initially he seemed so keen and eager, such a dynamo of a player, that when he started matches, he would burn himself out quickly and have to be replaced. He admits physical strength and stamina are sides of the game he has been working on.\n\n“In Italy, there are two important aspects: one is the physical side, which I struggled with initially,” Under says. “However, I worked a lot on my strength and my fitness, improving with training and game time. It’s fundamental in a league like this. Now I feel good and I have adapted. The other aspect is tactics but I need to improve physically, that’s for sure.”\n\nInjuries have hampered Under and last season he struggled to be a regular starter under new coach Paulo Fonseca. He missed 10 early-season games with a damaged bicep and started just 13 times in all competitions, but it is Roma’s financial position that has tempted them to cash in and accept Leicester’s offer.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Rodgers referenced the guile he expects Under to add to his attacking options.\n\n“Having seen him play for the last number of years at Roma and for Turkey, he is clearly a talented player,” said the Leicester manager. “That is what is key in terms of recruitment: getting someone who can beat someone one-v-one and excite the supporters and the team. Against organised defences, you need different types of qualities to break that down.\n\n“We have tremendous speed on the top end of the field and on the sides but we need that bit of football in there for when it is tight — you need someone who can make a pass or dribble past someone. That is the type of profile we have been looking for.”\n\nUnder had his medical at the Villa Stuart clinic in Rome yesterday under the supervision of three members of Leicester’s medical staff and was just waiting on a visa before flying to England to sign his contract for this initial year, with the potential for three more, which is worth around £50,000 per week plus bonuses. Leicester are paying a £2.75 million loan fee for this season with a view to a £22.85 million deal next summer to make the move permanent.\n\nThey weren’t the only club interested, with Napoli offering Roma former Leicester target Arkadiusz Milik as part of an exchange deal for Under, but seem to have landed the extra creativity and goal power Rodgers desired.\n\nHe will be hoping he has unearthed another young talent he can nurture among his burgeoning Leicester crop.\n\n(Photo: Marco Canoniero/LightRocket via Getty Images)"
