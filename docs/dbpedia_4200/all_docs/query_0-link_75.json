        "text": "Brendan Rodgers (born 26 January 1973) is a Northern Irish football coach and former player who is the manager of Premier League club Leicester City.\n\nRodgers began his career as a defender at Ballymena United, where he stayed until he was signed by Reading at the age of 18, although a genetic knee condition forced him to retire at age 20. He remained at Reading as a coach and then academy director, and continued to play non-league football at Newport, Witney Town and Newbury Town for several years. After a period travelling around Spain to study coaching methods, he was invited by José Mourinho to leave Reading and join Chelsea as youth manager in 2004, later being promoted to reserve manager in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, he was appointed manager of Watford, where he remained until he accepted an offer to become manager of his former club Reading in 2009. He left the club by mutual consent after disappointing results six months later. He returned to management with Swansea City in 2010, leading the club to promotion to the Premier League, the first Welsh team ever to do so, before guiding them to finish 11th the following season. On 1 June 2012, Rodgers accepted an offer to become the new manager of Liverpool, whom he led to runners-up position in the league in the 2013–14 season before his dismissal in October 2015. He became manager of Celtic in May 2016 and led Celtic to an undefeated domestic season in his first year, and trebles in both of his first two seasons. He left Celtic for Leicester City in February 2019.\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that Nigel Pearson would sign Jamie Vardy ahead of the 2012–13 season, for a reported fee of £1 million, a non-League record, which could potentially be worth up to £1.7 million with add-ons.\n\nOn 21 November, Vardy matched Van Nistelrooy's record of consecutive Premier League games with a goal, opening a 3–0 win over Newcastle United. A week later, against Manchester United, he scored again to claim the record for himself.\n\nIn 2017 Vardy was one of four Leicester players in the PFA Team of the Year; he was later also named the FWA Footballer of the Year, and the 2016 Barclays Premier League Player of the Season.\n\nKing joined Chelsea when he was just nine years old. After being released in 2004 when he was 15 years old, he joined the Leicester City youth academy. King was offered his first professional contract with Leicester on 5 May 2007. He has been with the club ever since and has become a club legend winning League One, Championship and Premier League Trophies.\n\nHe made his Champions League debut for Leicester on 18 October 2016, contributing in a 1–0 victory over F.C. Copenhagen at the King Power Stadium.\n\nBorn in Metropolitan Lyon, Ghezzal joined Lyon’s academy as a 12-year-old and signed his first professional contract with the club in 2010. The winger spent two years with Lyon B before being promoted to the first team and made his senior debut in October 2012 against Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona in the UEFA Europa League.\n\nThe Algerian enjoyed his most prolific campaign for Lyon in 2015/16 when he scored eight goals in 29 Ligue 1 appearances. In his final season with the club, Ghezzal played 25 times as his side reached the UEFA Europa League semi-final and finished fourth in the league. The winger finished his time at Lyon with a record of 14 goals and 20 assists in his 110 appearances.\n\nA tough-tackling talent in the centre of midfield, Hamza Choudhury often acts as a defensive guard in front of the back line. His performances for the Club's Academy side in 2015/16 saw him secure a loan move to Sky Bet League 1 outfit Burton Albion, helping them gain promotion to the Championship.\n\nChoudhury captained the 10-man squad who travelled to Hong Kong for the Citi Soccer Sevens, lifting the trophy in Happy Valley in May 2017. After pre-season, Choudhury was named as the Development Squad's new captain following the departure of Elliott Moore to OH Leuven on loan.\n\nHe made his senior Foxes debut against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup in September 2017 before enjoying a Premier League bow during a 2-1 success over Tottenham Hotspur in November.\n\nThe following season, Hamza established himself in the First Team, playing a key part in back-to-back victories against Chelsea and Manchester City over the festive period"
