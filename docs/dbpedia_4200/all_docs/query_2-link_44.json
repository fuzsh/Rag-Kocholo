On 18 March 2016, he was called to national squad for friendly games against Sweden and Austria, to be held on 24 March 2016 in Antalya, Turkey and on 29 March in Austria, respectively.\n\nSubstituting for Ozan Tufan in the dying minutes of a friendly game against Sweden, Söyüncü earned his first senior national team cap on 24 March 2016. Earning his second cap, he was in the starting line-up in the friendly with Russia on 1 September 2016, which ended 0–0.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, Söyüncü scored his first senior international goal on a friendly game against Tunisia, held at Stade de Genève, Geneva, Switzerland. On 1 June 2021, he was selected in the 26-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2020.\n\nOn 24 May 2024, he was named in the 35-man preliminary squad for the UEFA Euro 2024. However, on 29 May, he was withdrawn due to injury.\n\nSeason Stats\n\n3 appearances in the current 2024-2025 Season\n\nCareer Honours\n\nEnglish FA Community Shield\n\n2021\n\nLeicester\n\nEnglish FA Cup\n\n2020-2021\n\nLeicester\n\nCareer Milestones\n\nFormer Youth Teams\n\n2006-2011\n\n2011-2013\n\nFormer Senior Teams\n\n2014-2016\n\n2016-2018\n\n2018-2023\n\n2023-2024\n\nFormer Club Staff\n\nContracts\n\n2018-2023\n\n2023-2027\n\n2024-2027\n\nFanart\n\nBanner\n\nNone Found...\n\nOther Links"
