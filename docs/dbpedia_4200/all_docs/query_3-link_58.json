        "text": "Purpose: This study aimed to determine the relationship between birth weight, and maternal serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and kisspeptin-1 (KISS-1) levels, and first-trimester fetal volume (FV) based on three-dimensional ultrasonography.\n\nMaterials and methods: The study included 142 pregnant women at gestational week 11°-136. All fetuses were imaged ultrasonographically by the same physician. Maternal blood samples were collected at the time of ultrasonographic evaluation and analyzed for IGFBP-1 and KISS-1 levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Maternal and neonatal weights were recorded at birth. Birth weight ≤10th and the >90th percentiles was defined as small and large for gestational age (SGA and LGA), respectively.\n\nResults: Median crown-rump length (CRL), FV, and maternal serum IGFBP-1 and KISS-1 levels were 58.2 mm (35.3-79.2 mm), 16.3 cm3 (3.8-34.4 cm3), 68.1 ng mL-1 (3.8-377.9 mL-1), and 99.7 ng L-1 (42.1-965.3 ng L-1), respectively. First-trimester IGFBP-1 levels were significantly lower in the mothers with LGA neonates (p < .05). There was a significant positive correlation between CRL and FV, and between the IGFBP-1 and KISS-1 levels. IGFBP-1 levels and maternal weight at delivery were negatively correlated with neonatal birth weight. There was no correlation between CRL or FV and maternal IGFBP-1 or KISS1 levels (p > .05). The maternal IGFBP-1 level during the first trimester was a significant independent factor for SGA and LGA neonates (Odds ratio (OR): 0.011, 95%CI: 1.005-1.018, p < .001; and OR: 1.297, 95%CI: 1.074-1.566, p = .007, respectively). There was no significant relationship between SGA or LGA, and CRL, FV, or the KISS-1 level."
