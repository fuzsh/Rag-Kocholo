After the Czech Republic with an average age of 25.3 in Group F, Türkiye is the youngest team in the tournament with an average age of 25.8 for its 26-man squad.\n\nGoalkeeping experience, youth in defense and attack\n\nThe forward position has the youngest average age at 23.8, while the oldest position is goalkeeper with 29.6 in Türkiye.\n\nThe youngest player in the National Team is 18-year-old Semih Kilicsoy, who contributed to 15 goals (12 goals, 3 assists) in 35 matches played for Besiktas this season. The oldest player is goalkeeper Mert Gunok, who plays for Besiktas.\n\nKey player values, leadership\n\nThe value of Türkiye’s 26-man squad submitted to UEFA is $350 million. The most valuable player in the squad is captain Hakan Calhanoglu, who led his team to the Serie A title in Italy and was voted as Italy’s best midfielder at the age of 30, with a value of $48.6 million. Following Calhanoglu are 19-year-old rising stars Arda Guler and Kenan Yildiz, valued at $32.4 million each.\n\nLegionnaires\n\nIt’s worth noting that 53.8% of the players in the squad are legionnaires (playing outside Türkiye). Legionnaires play in Italy (3), England (3), France (2), Spain (1), Portugal (1), Saudi Arabia (1), Germany (1), Netherlands (1) and Greece (1)."
