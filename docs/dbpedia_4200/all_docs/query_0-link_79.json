        "text": "He was only 19 when he made his first senior international appearance, and before making the move to King Power Stadium, and brought with him Bundesliga and UEFA Europa League experience.\n\nA little over a year later, Söyüncü is an ever-present in the Premier League for Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester City side, who are third in the top-flight standings after 10 fixtures, having amassed 20 points during that time.\n\nHis popularity among the Club’s fans, and his team-mates, of course, has been forged through a series of combative performances, coupled with a composure and skill that is seldom seen displayed by a 23-year-old central defender.\n\nSpeaking LCFC.com, Söyüncü said: “It’s been very good for me and for the team, obviously. We would like to keep it that way – that is the important thing.\n\n“The manager said from the very beginning of the season that it was going to be a different season, and that we are a good bunch of players that have been working together since last season.\n\n“We know it’s going to be hard to continue this way, but we’ll do our best and we’ll work hard.”\n\nThe İzmir-born defender has furthered his development under manager Rodgers and his backroom staff – not least 2015 Africa Cup of Nations winner Kolo Touré.\n\nA source of inspiration for Söyüncü, Touré won the Premier League with Arsenal in 2003/04 and Manchester City in 2011/12, as well as two FA Cups with the Gunners and was part of the Celtic squad that won the unbeaten domestic treble under Rodgers in 2016/17.\n\n“I’m learning a lot from Brendan and his staff, they have been helping me a lot,” said Söyüncü. “His staff are very helpful for me and I learn a lot from them.\n\n“Kolo played in my position, and he’s very experienced. He has a massive career behind him, and of course, he is inspiring.”\n\nHis partnership in central defence alongside Jonny Evans, meanwhile, has also flourished this season, and that is down to Söyüncü’s willingness to learn from the experienced three-time champion of England.\n\n“He’s a very experienced player himself,” said the City No.4 of the Northern Ireland international defender. “I try to listen to him all the time and I learn a lot from him as well.\n\n“During the games, he helps me a lot with his experience and I listen to everything he says. He’s older than me, and he’s more experienced so I respect him. He’s a good person.”\n\nHaving been involved in every Premier League game so far this term, Söyüncü had no trouble in picking out City’s most impressive performance of the season – the sensational 9-0 victory over Southampton at St. Mary’s Stadium in Leicester’s latest league outing.\n\nSöyüncü added: “It was a record win, obviously, and I was just happy to be part of it. People will remember that game, and I was there – I will remember it.\n\n“I’ve never been part of something like that at a professional level.”"
