        "text": "Former Leicester City defender Caglar Soyuncu has officially completed his move to Atletico Madrid after leaving the club at the end of his contract.\n\nThe Turkish international was one of seven first team players to leave on a free transfer at the end of last month following City’s relegation to the Championship last season. Soyuncu was mostly left out in the cold for the season just gone, but was brought back into the fold under interim manager Dean Smith.\n\nHe had been linked with a move to Spanish giants Atletico Madrid since the January window. Having just six months left on his deal with City, he was able to talk to overseas clubs about his future.\n\nREAD MORE: Danny Murphy criticises Enzo Maresca's 'naive' Leicester City claim with Leeds United point\n\nREAD MORE: Leicester City signing Harry Winks told what he needs to achieve after Tottenham transfer\n\nSoyuncu is said to have agreed a contract with the club earlier this year. His move has now been confirmed, with Atletico announcing the transfer on their official website.\n\n“Çağlar Söyüncü is now a new player for Atlético de Madrid following the agreement reached between our club and the Turkish footballer, who signs for four seasons,” the statement read.\n\n“Born on May 23, 1996, in Izmir (Turkey), he will join the squad at the beginning of the 2023/24 preseason, which will start on Friday, July 7.”\n\nThe move comes days after Soyuncu took to social media to post an emotional goodbye to City fans following his exit from the club. “It was an honour to wear our blue kit and fight for you,” he wrote\n\n“We experienced it all together, from the amazing times to the more difficult periods. But even during those bad times I felt home. And that's completely thanks to you. Your chants, your support, your trust made me the player I am today.”\n\nSoyuncu becomes the second of the out of contract players to secure a move this summer. Youri Tielemans has officially joined Aston Villa, remaining in the Premier League, while Daniel Amartey is closing in on a move to Turkey."
