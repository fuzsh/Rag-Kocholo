        "text": "Cavalier SC and Mount Pleasant Academy both expressed optimism ahead of their clash to open the 2024 CONCACAF Caribbean Cup at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica on Tuesday.\n\nThe two teams most recently met in a thrilling final of the Jamaica Premier League in May which Cavalier won 4-3 in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nHead Coach of Cavalier, Rudolph Speid, doesn't expect that result to give his side a mental edge going into Tuesday's clash.\n\n\"The phenomenon of this clash is that every time we meet, Mount Pleasant has a new team and we have a lot of changes. It's a new game all over and we just expect to win this particular game,\" he said in a pre-match press conference on Monday.\n\nThe teams will compete in Group A of the ten-team tournament alongside fellow JPL outfit Arnett Gardens FC, Real Hope FC out of Haiti and Police FC out of Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nCavalier were runners-up in last year’s inaugural edition of the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup, losing the two-legged final by a combined score of 3-0 to Surinamese outfit Robinhood FC.\n\nSomething synonymous with Cavalier over the years is their willingness to use young players and Head Coach Rudolph Speid says this will continue to be the team’s policy going forward.\n\n“We don’t have much new faces. Some of the younger players from our youth teams are the ones that have stepped up. That has been our policy and our motto. Every single year, Cavalier will field young players who came through our ranks.”\n\nDespite this inexperience, Speid expects good things from his players when the time comes.\n\n“They know what to expect. Some of them have pretty big shoes to fill and I’m confident that they will do well,” he said.\n\nTrinidadian attacker Kaile Auvray, who joined Cavalier from Mount Pleasant recently, is hopeful that his insight on his former team will give them an added advantage tomorrow.\n\n“Obviously being a former Mount Pleasant player, I know my former teammates very well so I’ll be sure to communicate things that can help us be successful,” he said.\n\nOn the other hand, this will be Mount Pleasant Academy’s first time competing in the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup, an achievement that is not lost on Head Coach Harold Thomas.\n\n“It’s been a long-awaited arrival for Mount Pleasant at this level. Our preparation has been relatively smooth. Short period of time but we were able to implement all the things we wanted to. We’re happy with where we are,” he said.\n\n“We are all excited as a club,” said Mount Pleasant skipper Sue-Lae McCalla about playing in their first CONCACAF Caribbean Cup.\n\n“It’s a good feeling. For a new club, the first time so it’s a lot of excitement for us,” he added.\n\nNormally, playing in a tournament of this magnitude for the first time would have a team feeling some pressure.\n\nFor Coach Thomas, however, this is not the case.\n\n“Absolutely not,” was his response to questions about whether or not his team is feeling the pressure ahead of tomorrow’s game.\n\n“This is what we live for. For us, it’s just a matter of getting all things right,” he said."
