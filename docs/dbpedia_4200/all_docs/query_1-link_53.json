He ventured into Muaythai and Kickboxing, competing alongside Pat Kongram, a Thai legend. In 2011, he was introduced to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and became one of the initial national athletes in the Turkish Federation. Within the realm of Jiu-jitsu, he attained the distinction of becoming the first Turkish Balkan Champion in his weight category. During that same year, he secured the opportunity to partake in the World Championship as one of the pioneer national athletes in UWW Grappling. From 2016, he aligned himself with the Gracie family, training under Wilson Junior at the Carlson Gracie London team. With the founding of Ground and Pound Istanbul in 2017, he brought Carlson Gracie to Turkey with the support of Grand Master Carlson Gracie Jr. and started to manage the team. Currently, Muaythai, Carlson Graice Jiu-jitsu, Kids Martial Arts and GNP combat system lessons compiled by him are being thought in the academy, also training with the Turkish champions.He also continues to be a contestant in MMA and BJJ branches."
