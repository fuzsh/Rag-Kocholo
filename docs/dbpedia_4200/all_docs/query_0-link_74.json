        "text": "We have a treat for you, an enjoyable interview with the director of DAG II (The Mountain II); Alper Caglar. His film, perhaps to his own surprise, broke all military film box office records and was the box office gross winner of 2016 in Turkey. As the youngest auteur director in Turkey, he has now also become a box office money machine. Now, 3 years after our first interview for his 2014 film noir Antidote, we have reunited on IGN.\n\nAfter writing, directing and even editing the best action film in Turkish cinema, Alper broke many conventions regarding genres that work in the box office. He has raised a banner of hope in a regional industry only used to drama and comedy. Shooting the action genre is difficult, director Marc Webb who filmed the first Amazing Spider-Man, in his interview referred to it as maddeningly difficult but immensely fun. Similar are Sam Mendes' views, who lamented the difficulties of the action genre long before he filmed Spectre. It's a genre more than the sum of its parts, not just about filming or editing, but also about the exquisite details of audience immersion hanging by a thread. I can honestly say that DAG II was a trailblazer in how action should be done in Turkey, even as a war film.\n\nAs you've probably noticed, his success has brought a plethora of military television serials, green-lit with astonishing speed on many different TV networks. Alper however, the original pioneer of this sub-genre-- bid his time, and now returns as the creator of a television series, perfectionist to its core. Inspired by the structural production style of Game of Thrones producer David Benioff or Kevin Feige at the top of Marvel, he announced Wolf, an ambitious miniseries to be released Fall 2017.\n\nAs soon as Wolf (Börü in Turkish/Turkic) aired its first announcement teaser, it created a storm of viral attention from all around Turkey. A million organic Facebook views on its first 10 hours. My own friends, shared the teaser organically as “that project” they've been waiting for. This meant that we had to sit down with Alper and have a sincere chat about the past couple of years and beyond. We spoke of the Mountain II, the future sequel, internet series, games, Wolf, and his prospective plans.\n\nCoincidentally, before the shoot for the Mountain II began I had read the script and was to be involved in the creative team, but a last second scheduling conflict prevented that fateful involvement. I remember watching the film in the premiere and regretting not being on the actual set of a now legendary film. But we had a couple of chats after the film about incoming financial success and the future itself. We start our interview from where we left off. Enjoy.\n\nINTERVIEW\n\nIGN: First, an apology from me is in order. Last we spoke, I was guessing an audience number of around 800,000 and 1 million for The Mountain II, I was dramatically wrong. It truly shook the box office, with 3 million 600 thousand viewers. The question everybody is wondering is; what's your plan for The Mountain story universe?\n\nAlper: The Mountain III, whenever we shoot it, will be the final film of a cinematic franchise I've fallen in love with quite some time ago. All three storylines of the trilogy were already written down in 2011, when I had a flash of inspiration about a gritty realistic soldier movie. It had to be consistent throughout, and orbit around the friendship of Oguz and Bekir. A saga of both friendship and duty. I need to make sure the final film lives up to all expectations, I can't miss the opportunity for a legendary 'farewell' to the series. I want a October 29th 2023 premiere (the centennial of the Turkish Republic).\n\nSince you wrote all three Mountain films in 2011, these years must have been a grueling expenditure of energy for you. Why are these characters so important for you?\n\nThe banter filled friendship of Oguz and Bekir, comrades that have evolved from bitter rivals, is a metaphor for the ideal Turkey in the modern world. Where the left and right political spectrum, conservative and liberal, elitist and populist differences are all set aside for timeless honorable ideals, above and beyond petty bickering. These are characters who are trying to do the right thing in drastic circumstances, appealing to the inner goodness of the audience. They are willing to put themselves on the line for things greater than them. Friendship, the truth and the safekeeping of innocents. Sure the series is very gritty and brutal at times, but so is life. These guys are everyday heroes as I imagine them. The series is also an homage to an poignant line of work; being an honorable soldier.\n\nLet's make IGN the first place where you drop some details regarding The Mountain III, can you give me some details?\n\nWell I won't disappoint you (not much). The Mountain III will take place when middle age begins for both Bekir and Oguz. NCO Bekir (Ufuk Bayraktar) already has greying hair. Officer Oguz (Caglar Ertuğrul), even though he's 3 years younger than his buddy, is already in his early forties. Life has changed in meaning for them. They are the leaders now, the men with the families, the men serving under their command, that gnawing feeling of safety for their family members and men forms their great stress. Since in film II they joined the maroon berets, they will stay there. We will also see the solid cast of supporting characters; audience favorites Arif, Batur and Baybars (Murat Arkin, Emir Benderlioglu and Armagan Oguz respectively). Stylistically, memories, tender moments and sincere friendships will as usual mix with the brutal and profane truths of war. I got a ridiculously good opening scene designed since the winter of 2011. Makes my hands shake with anticipation of editing it. Obviously I won't reveal the details yet, but the gist of it is; we need to surpass DAG II as much as we have surpassed the second film surpassed the first DAG.\n\nWill The Mountain III be the final film of the series? Is this a certainty?\n\nLet's just say that it's closer to a certainty than uncertainty. A more greedy director would have exploited the series with 4-5-6 and so on. But that's not my style. I write, film and edit this story because I have fallen in love with it as a member of the audience. I suffer and toil with an amateur zeal to make it great, and it takes a lot out of me, I burn out by the end, its a project of passion for me. That's why I can't prolong the proper life of the story unnecessarily. I also want to do different genres. Maybe, just maybe, if the franchise keeps on rolling after III, I would probably take a 'George Lucas' role of overseeing everything as I dictate the new projects, but who knows, that's a long way off.\n\nBefore we ask about WOLF, the new TV series you've created, let me ask you about something related; internet streaming services. What do you think about Netflix and the like? Do you think it will harm film or benefit the industry worldwide?\n\nI think premium streaming will empower cinema even more. I know it sounds paradoxical, but hear me out-- we all know competition is the fuel for creativity. When streaming services like Amazon and Netflix commission new content, they increase creative competition of visual storytelling on every level. Film, television, internet-- as venues for content increase so does the chance of discovery and rejuvenation of unique genres or storylines. New continents will be discovered. Naysayers have been worrying about things like 'tv will destroy cinema' and so on since 1950s. When I was in my twenties, ten years ago, as I shot my first serious shorts, doomsday foretellers were rambling about how 'digital will destroy cinema'. But it didn't destroy anything. On the contrary it replenished flagging interest in film and effects. Film will always grow, it will always transcend projections. First Titanic surpassed 1 billion dollars of gross, and then Avatar surpassed 2 billion. One day a film will surpass 10 billion dollars, it is the nature of things.\n\nThe perpetual expansion of film as a medium will always exist. Because mankind is a lonely being. We are alone within the casings of our mind. We fear things. Those fears make it necessary for us to gather strength from other people, share our lives with the society as a social creature. Whatever happens, women and men, will always fill up a movie theater or an incarnation of the same communal activity. That excitement, the shared experience of staring at the monolithic singular screen, perhaps shit on the film afterwards because it was bad, or discuss the experience with others-- it is in our nature.\n\nDo you have an idea for that potential 10 billion gross film?\n\nI do. But I can't try it until my 50's. It's not easy being a quality box office juggernaut like James Cameron. You need to read, watch, research, improve yourself ad infinitum. Being a visionary or a creative furnace isn't enough. You need discipline, perseverance, a network of connections, luck-- loads of it, all integrated to one another. I will try. For myself, for those who believe in me, for my country, of course I'll try the mountain peak, but its a ridiculously challenging climb.\n\nWhat about Turkish streaming services like BluTV, Puhu and so on? Do you think they are the bringers of change?\n\nAside from our mini series BÖRÜ, I don't think so, unfortunately. Entrepreneurship and ambition are forsaken on televisions in Turkey because of a willingness to settle for the mediocre. Our series' production style is woefully unprepared for the genres of action, science-fiction, fantasy, even drama sometimes. Procrastinating TV producers enjoy productions that are easy, they still work in 1990s mentality of static, boring, dialogue-dominated scenes one after the other. They suffocate the audience in melodrama and shallow lover quarrels. “Look at who's kissing who in this scene!” they say, trying to PR the mundane thing of celebrities kissing each other, its cringe-worthy to say the least. We used to make fun of Brazilian and Mexican romantic daytime serials in Turkey, now we are far worse than them. Our actors share pictures of each other trying to foster celebrity and status instead of focusing on their method and craft. Ask a Turkish actor if they know what Meisner is, they'll look at you with dead shark eyes, then probably turn back to their social media feeds on a cell phone. If a citizen of Turkey thinks that 'HBO is awesome but local content in Turkey sucks', and takes this for granted, the entire Turkish TV industry needs to look in the mirror and feel ashamed. We don't need the easy, the yes-men, what we need are the toiling pioneers. We need those few who try, and sometimes fail, in the arena of originality, men and women who burn with a desire to make a difference in storytelling.\n\nAt last, we come to WOLF (Börü), your anticipated 1 hour miniseries on Turkey's largest network, Star TV. We know that you are aiming for a 'Band of Brothers' similar series. What don't we know?\n\nFirst of all, I'm what the West calls a 'showrunner'-- basically a series creator. A sort of a creative dictator who controls every aspect of the production itself. I own the intellectual property of the franchise, I lead the writing, directorial and editing departments. My business partner Doruk Acar and myself, we strive to reach the HBO levels of production processes and ideals. The episode directors are my closest friends, Cem Özüduru and Can Emre. They are not outsourced directors, I consider them my peers, one of a kind buddies, the part of a Turkish brat pack of directors. Alas, it wouldn't be proper for me to direct a television series after the Mountain II.\n\nWhy, do you view TV directing as less prestigious?\n\nNo, not really. The reason I always say 'no' to directing on TV is a net result of my career plans as well as a consequence of my enthusiasm levels. Ever since I became a bona fide, professional feature director in 2010, I've always stubbornly said no to any TV work, and regarded cinema as my singular venue. I've built my career on film, and film only. I'm a man of passion, I direct with a self-sacrificing intensity and energy, usually to my own detriment. For the 6-10 months it takes me to finish a film, I spend my own life force to triumph over that encroaching burnout feeling all directors feel. I respect ambitious and enthusiastic TV directors locally and beyond, but I would only ever be a series creator or producer on TV. However, this series serves as the stepping stone for two friends of mine I view as brothers. I am trying to fill up their sails with wind from my own success, by giving them the opportunity to make their bones as directors. It's similar to what Spielberg did for his buddies Ron Howard and Robert Zemeckis by producing their directorial debuts.\n\nThe series is titled WOLF or more specifically BÖRÜ. In old Turkic, börü means 'wolf'. Why wolf?\n\nBörü, is a mythological term from way back when Turks were in Central Asia. It means a special kind of wolf, an outcast, forever watching out for the good of the pack itself. It is a very apolitical 'lone wolf' term. Naive in meaning, and also prevalent in almost every Turkish or Turkic culture around the globe. The word is one of the oldest words that has remained pure in all Turkic cultures, dating back more than 2000 years. It exists in all the regions we have passed until we reached Europe as nomads. Pacific Amur people use it, Yakuts of endless Siberia use it, Crimean Tatars use it, Yörük Turkmens from Adana, Turkey use it. As the great mythologist Joseph Campbell once said, “An artist is a person who translated the song of the universe to their people. Their responsibility is to their people as much as art itself.” My responsibility as a storyteller is to my culture, my language, my people. I am trying to inject a non-political, unifying meaning to an archaic and precious word.\n\n“Lone Wolves' also happens to be the unofficial nickname for Police Special Operations, the subject matter of the series. They are involved with counter-terrorism operations of every type, and for the past few years have been at the vanguard against ISIS and a multitude of terror organizations trying to harm Turkish people or innocents in the country.\n\n“Why a wolf?” you might ask. Because a wolf is a unique type of animal, it values cunning and compassion in equal measure. It is a noble creature, it has become the totemic animal of Turkic peoples for a reason. A wolf protects the young of the pack, even though that cub may not be its own blood. It knows sacrifice for the greater good. It respects nature and the balance of biomes, never over hunting. For the series, it signifies teamwork, family, friendship. Timeless virtues that interweave with the fact that Turkic peoples are similar, a 200 million population all around the globe united in tradition and a great respect for one another. No matter how much some might wish, this ancient friendship between a common culture will never be eroded or forgotten. Series wise, characters will embody this nobility during darkness, brave men and women who serve for others, never for themselves.\n\nNazim Hikmet, the great Turkish Poet has a wonderful verse; “who will illuminate the darkness, if you and I do not burn?”. In my mind's eye, I envision a series that both a leftist, and a nationalist might enjoy. A series that both a religious man and an agnostic will respect. My aim is to provide a universal framework for a heroic story, that the country can unite around in difficult times. We all know Turkey's best form; a modern country that values diversity of opinion and united in progress. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's dream is not impossible. This country can be democratic, respectful of its ancient culture, and stand upright in respected status internationally. Police Special Operations have been involved in the tumultuous events of the past 3-5 years, through bitter and hopeful moments, to defend everyone in the country, regardless of creed or opinion of the individual. Throughout my research I've met truly exceptional heroes, whose recent stories deserve being told.\n\nHow did you convince Star TV for such a technically ambitious and revolutionary 60 minute series? (Note: TV series in Turkey are usually around 180 minutes-- yes we know its madness.)\n\nStar TV is a special network. Corporate culture infused with visionary people. If I didn't feel they had some measure of idealism, I wouldn't have gotten along with them. Sure they have to have projects which are mass consumption based and advertisement laden. But after DAG II, when my film made the largest gross of the year, I had unique leverage. A sub-industry of military action series began popping up. They wanted to capitalize on this with style, and I wanted to go on another foolish idealistic quest of fixing Turkish TV. So this collaboration was born. Star is the kind of TV network that looks upon me and my business partner Doruk's ideas with enthusiasm. It has the same 'Turkey needs creative pioneers' philosophy as we do.\n\nHow would you summarise Wolf's unique differences compared to a cliché Turkish TV series. How would you explain this to a European or American?\n\nSimple. WOLF has 3 main rules:\n\n1- Episodes will be around an hour long.\n\n2- It must have proper cinematic visual quality, masterful film grammar-- no cop outs.\n\n3- Story is the only foundation for everything else. Cheap melodrama, insincere lovey dovey ridiculousness are utterly forbidden.\n\nThis is our final chance. Standard Turkish 36 episode season TV series have recently passed the 180 minute mark PER EPISODE. This is getting out of hand. We need to throw the One Ring in Mount Doom, and urgently.\n\nDoes that make you Frodo?\n\nI am Aragorn. Doruk is Gandalf. My old friends and episode directors Can and Cem are Frodo and Sam respectively. Star TV is obviously Elrond of Rivendell.\n\nWho's the bad guy Sauron?\n\nThere are many Saurons. Exaggerated heroism for ratings. Dialogue ridden bullshit scenes to pander to advertisement agencies. Objectified women who cry in sad scenes and little else. Celebrity obsessed actors with incurable status anxiety. All the mistakes of Turkey's TV industry are Saurons unto themselves. But Turkey and those countries we export series to, deserve better content. We seek to alleviate this problem. We want to impress Turks who watch HBO and Netflix but snub their own local content because they are so cliché.\n\nWhy do we see an amalgam of DAG series actors and crew in WOLF?\n\nDAG and WOLF series, are totally independent of one another as story universes. New characters, new dynamics. But I wanted to cast familiar faces as a strategic move. Stars of DAG, Ufuk and Caglar couldn't be leads in this franchise, they have their own whale of a baby for that. But I made sure I cast fan favorites from the first two films, Murat Arkin, Emir Benderlioglu, Ahu (Turkpence), Firat Dogruloglu, Armagan Oguz and Mesut Akusta. The ensemble needed to have familiar powerhouses for my strategy to work just like in Sopranos (which had a Goodfellas alumni cast and crew). As newcomers we have the massively popular Serkan Cayoglu as a lead. His Turkish-German discipline combined with his millions of worldwide fans was a chess move on my part. Similarly Can Nergis, Gürol Tonbul, Melis Hacic, Ozan Agac are quality actors who form the backbone of this ensemble. The aim is to create Barcelona football squad of 2010. A clockwork cast which functions as a single unit.\n\nWhat about the crew? Whenever the DAG crew is uttered, your viewers go wild.\n\nSimply put, I love my crew. Special mention goes to the one and only Ahmet Pinar. Our tactical consultant and head of the production design team, his perfectionist anxiety rivals my own. He is my greatest asset and my biggest headache. I don't know how the convinced me, but I ended up a de facto manager of his, I'm literally designing his career :) Him and our stunt coordinator Bedii Akin, are also in the cast. They are among my most trusted lieutenants. Before anything else, we are a family of friends. From my perpetual sound engineer Murat Küllü, to 1000Volt post production company, to Pinar, Ender, Tan and Onur-- names which have little meaning for you, but for me they are harbingers of a succesful project. These bonds have been created in very difficult circumstances and modest projects. We grew together. I pride myself in the fact that they are all my friends before professional connections. With crucial transfers like our line producer Ali Demir, and the strategic support of RED cameras, I believe we have managed to create an exciting set.\n\nWe saw you in Antidote and DAG II in minor roles. Will we see you in a cameo during Wolf? I expect you might get your character killed off like Tarantino usually does :)\n\nI do have a mysterious, minor role towards the end of the series. But I won't have my character harmed in the slightest way, I'm the leader of the writers after all...\n\nWe are seeing Alper Caglar as an investor on a TV project for the first time. I know you are crazy about computer games, will we one day see a similar venture?\n\nDoruk and I are trying to purchase the intellectual property rights of a strategy game series at the moment. We want to unify it with the DAG series and create a prospective rejuvenation of the classic game for PC and consoles. Naturally that is no easy feat. I am collaborating with the producers, designers and the coders of the original games from USA and Canada. To motivate them, and win them over for a new generation of gaming won't be an easy feat. I am a rookie in the gaming industry as well, they need to show me the ropes. Hopefully everything will go according to plan.\n\nWhat do you currently play in terms of games? Are you still a fanatic of PC gaming as opposed to PS4, Xbox and similar console technologies?\n\nPC gaming heritage, to put it mildly, will crush, destroy, vaporize, disintegrate any game rival from a console background. I'm a proud and belligerent lover of the past and present PC era. The original Fallouts, Baldur's Gate series, Torment-- I adore them. I've built towns with Settlers, creates natural disasters with Populous, binge played Dungeon Keeper, saved the world in the original X-COM (not the current mediocre incarnation). In my heart, they are indispensable influences on how I approach any story. Gaming is the future.\n\nThese days I play DOTA 2 a lot because its a quick fix of competitive gaming. I have more than 5000 hours on Steam. I also love the Europa Universalis series and grand strategy in general. Such an addictive sandbox! Bedii Akin, my multiplayer buddy, is trying to get me started on PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS but I haven't had the time yet, instead I play DayZ still.\n\nIf you want fresh off the assembly line masterpieces, I wholeheartedly suggest the survival game The Long Dark. Naturally I want everyone to buy, play and adore Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, and make it the most successful RPG ever. Those guys over at Obsidian, past and present, like Chris Avellone, Josh Sawyer, Tim Cain are my friends so a big shout out to them. I've pestered them for years saying that one day I will collaborate with them on something, that dream is a bit closer these days.\n\nLast question. You can't say 'No Comment'. Is your extremely confidential 2019 feature film, a medieval epic, the Battle of Manzikert?"
