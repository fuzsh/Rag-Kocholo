        "text": "Mobile Two-Way Radios\n\nMobile two-way radios are ideal communication solutions for professionals who work in fixed locations. Whether thatâs your vehicle or your office, a mobile two-way radio offers the benefits of a constant power source and extended range.\n\nCommUSA mobile two-way radios consist of the mobile radio itself, plus vehicle mounting brackets, battery power cables and palm style microphones. We also carry a variety of vehicle and building style antennas to extend the range of your mobile even further.\n\nWe also offer fleet vehicle installation for our mobile radios and installation services for our base stations. Thatâs why school bus systems, city engineers, and public works departments in Woodburn, Virginia prefer to source all their mobile two-way radio and base station needs from CommUSA.\n\nPortable Two-Way Radios\n\nIf your workers arenât chained to a desk or vehicle, they need more than what a mobile two-way radio can offer. Thatâs where portable two-way radios come in.\n\nPortables are convenient handheld two-way radio devices that you can clip to your belt when not in use. Depending on your working conditions, CommUSA has compact two-way radio models, heavy-duty two-way radio models, and everything in between.\n\nPerfect for hospitals, casinos, oil and gas companies, amusement parks, and more, a portable two-way radio system from CommUSA is the affordable and reliable communication solution you need for your next big project.\n\nBase Stations\n\nWith a base station from CommUSA, your mobile two-way radio will always be ready to go when communication is most critical. We can convert your mobile radio into a base station by adding a desktop power supply, desktop microphone and external antenna.Â Your mobile radio stays plugged into the power supply for all-day operations and you wonât have to worry about it walking away from the desk.\n\nHook up your base station to a dispatch console and get seamless individual-to-group or group-to-group communication.\n\nYouâll also get up to 8% extra coverage in dead spots, perfect for even the most rural jobs. If thatâs not enough, CommUSA carries base station-compatible MOTOTRBO repeaters for your extended coverage needs.\n\nRepeaters\n\nPortable, mobile and base station two-way radios can only talk so far. Weâve all seen the two-way radio advertisements that boast of âup to 35 mile range,â but the truth is obstructions in the path of your radio signal like buildings, walls, furniture or even trees, hills or mountains if you are outdoors, can degrade your transmission signal significantly. If you are in a skyrise building, depending on the construction materials of the building, you may only get 7 to 10 floors with a full power business radio. And if you add to that same building things like underground floors or parking structures with thick concrete separations, your coverage may even be worse. On a large outdoor campus like a business park or University, you may only get a quarter mile of coverage.\n\nEvery environment is different and we have the expert communications consultants to help you find the right solution. Repeaters are one of those options in that they ârepeatâ the signal of your two-way radio portable, mobile, or base station, at a higher power and with a better antenna that is designed to fill in the gaps of your coverage area. If itâs determined that you canât cover your area without a Repeater, then weâll help you choose the right custom set up.\n\nWe sell many Motorola Repeaters, including the SLR1000, SLR5700, MTR3000 and SLR8000. All of our Repeaters from Motorola are unique and custom configured for your needs. Best of all, we even offer Repeater solutions to connect multiple properties using Radio Over IP technology with solutions by Motorola such as IP Site Connect, Multi-Site Capacity Plus, Connect Plus and Capacity Max.\n\nTwo-Way Radio Chargers\n\nWith one charging session on our Motorola portable two-way radio chargers, your two-way radio charge can last up to three shifts. Browse our single-unit, multi-unit, and bank chargers compatible with most Motorola two-way radio models. For example, our PMLN6588A is a 6-bank charger ideal for all your CP series portable two-way radios.\n\nOr browse our IMPRES chargers like the 6-slot PMPN4284A. These chargers utilize a battery reconditioning system to keep batteries working better for longer.\n\nDonât forget to grab an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)! Our UPS devices will keep your two-way radios up and running even during power surges and outages."
