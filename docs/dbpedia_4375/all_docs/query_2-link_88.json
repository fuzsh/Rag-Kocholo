        "text": "Woodburn Village Condos for Sale\n\nThese are all of the condos that are currently for sale in Woodburn Village.\n\nBrowse through and if you have any questions about any of them, you can reach out right from the listing page.\n\nIf you are interested in writing an offer on any property you see in Northern VA, we can help you with that as well.\n\nOur search also includes “coming soon” listings!\n\nAn Annandale Condo Community\n\nIf you are looking for a tree lined community full of amenities and close to all the action, Woodburn Village in Annandale is worth a look.\n\nThe community is close to Mosaic, walkable to Inova Hospital, driveable to Dunn Loring Metro, and surrounded by parks and sporting facilities.\n\nFor a more comprehensive search, see our home search.\n\nWoodburn Village has 9 different models spread across a multitude of buildings. There are just over 600 condos in the community in total.\n\nThe builder built 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom models. The 1 and 3 bedroom models also have floor plans that come with a den.\n\nEach unit has a small outdoor patio or balcony area, many over the central courtyard or a treed area of the common grounds. This is a perfect place to put a small table and chairs\n\nThe condos sell in a variety of conditions. Many have been updated but others are priced for needing renovations.\n\nThe condos also have a history of having FHA approval, so if you have this type of financing these have potential for you.\n\nAmenities and The Community\n\nWoodburn Village is in a great location in, just on the border of Falls Church and the greater Merrifield area.\n\nWoodburn Village Amenities\n\nThe amenities within the community are top notch. There are both basketball and tennis courts in the courtyard area.\n\nThere is also a community pool that underwent renovation around 2014, multiple playgrounds and tot lot areas, and a small dog park.\n\nThe Condo fees have historically been on the lower end of the spectrum, especially considering that they include utilities.\n\nThe community was built with plenty of greenspace throughout giving it that signature “in the woods” feel that many Northern VA communities have adopted.\n\nInova Fairfax Hospital\n\nThe community is easily walkable to Inova. The hospital campus is bordering the community, and although separated by a fence there are points of access.\n\nInova employs a large number of people, from doctors, nurses, to administrative medical staff and students.\n\nIf you are in the healthcare industry and want your commute to be cut to near zero, Woodburn Village could be a great fit for you.\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nAnnandale has several parks close to Woodburn Village. The biggest is Eakin Park, which has miles of walking trails and runs along the Accotink Creek.\n\nYou can also find several areas of playgrounds, basketball and tennis courts along the trails.\n\nDirectly across the from the condos is also Pine Ridge Park. This has soccer fields with turf and baseball fields. Both are lit so games can be played at night.\n\nThere is also a large community garden in Pine Ridge.\n\nThe Mosaic District\n\nA short drive away is the Mosaic District. Built in 2013, this is a pillar of the Merrifield community.\n\nShopping features both high stores and department stores, trendy restaurants and cool boutique stores line the area. It is one of my favorite spots in Northern VA.\n\nDunn Loring Metro\n\nLess than 3 miles away is Dunn Loring, which has a metro stop. This makes it easy to get to many spots in Northern VA and DC/MD using the rails and accompanying bus routes.\n\nIf you do not want to walk (it can be a hike) catch the metro bus that stops adjacent to the community at Fairfax Hospital.\n\nYou can also drive to and park at the metro for a daily fee.\n\nInvesting in Woodburn Village Condos\n\nThe condos at Woodburn Village are one of the communities we have identified as having strong potential to buy and rent out long term as an investment property.\n\nFor starters, the Merrifield area will continue to grow up around the hospital, Mosaic District and Dunn Loring metro.\n\nThe growth should bode well for both increases in rental demand and appreciation of the property.\n\nSecond, the condo prices however have stayed fairly affordable to purchase compared to what they rent for. For more on finding a good income investment property see this article.\n\nFinally, the properties are low maintenance. The monthly fee is relatively low, considering that they have a history of including all utilities.\n\nCondos themselves are more low maintenance than other properties because the community association takes care of the common grounds and exterior of the buildings.\n\nSelling a Condo in Northern VA\n\nAre you an owner of a condo in Woodburn Village or a surrounding area in Northern VA?\n\nThe best way to start the process is to get an expert to evaluate your property. We can guide you on what to fix, what not to fix, pricing, timing and how to maximize your profit.\n\nNext Steps\n\nWant to look for condos in Woodburn Village?
