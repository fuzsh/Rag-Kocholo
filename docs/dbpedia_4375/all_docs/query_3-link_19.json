If you're looking for high speed Internet for your Charles City home or business, you can use the listings on this page to start your search.\n\nOne of the largest providers in Charles City is Xfinity.

Quite a few other Virginia communities also fall into the Xfinity service area.\n\nPerhaps satellite has the speed and affordability you need. Viasat's network is one of the largest in this region, sprawling across all of Charles City and offering high connection speeds. This type of service is particularly convenient for those in rural areas.\n\nTechnology Type\n\nDSL:\n\nDSL provides internet service via phone cables and is up to ten times faster than dial-up service.\n\nCable:\n\nCable provides internet speeds faster than DSL through the same cables used for cable TV.\n\nSatellite:\n\nSatellite internet is widely available, but offers slower speeds due to a far-traveling signal.\n\nFiber:\n\nFiber relies on glass strands to relay digital code and is much faster than both DSL and cable."
