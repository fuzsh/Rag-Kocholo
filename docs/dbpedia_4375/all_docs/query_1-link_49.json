        "text": "Brightview Woodburn is located in the quiet Washington D.C. suburb of Annadale, Virginia. The project is located in the historic Holmes Run Acres neighborhood.\n\nHolmes Run Acres is the first neighborhood in Virginia to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places as an authentic Mid-Century Modern community. The design draws on a mid-century modern aesthetic prevalent in the surrounding neighborhood. Brightview Woodburn consists of 94 assisted living and memory care apartments in a 3-story-plus-basement, non-combustible structure. This is also the first Brightview community that features the memory care wing and garden on the top floor of the building. The facility provides a mix of studio, 1-bed, 2-bed and companion Assisted Living units; and studio and companion units in a secure wing for memory impaired residents; as well as community amenity spaces for residents.\n\nHord Coplan Macht provided planning, architecture and project management services."
