        "text": "We at USAFacts have endeavored to provide comprehensive, real-time pandemic data from all 50 states. However, the growing prevalence of at-home testing and the potential for individuals to contract the virus multiple times have skewed the government data we receive. These developments, plus the end of the public health emergency — and the required data reporting that came with it — have made it difficult for us to present a clear and reliable picture of COVID-19 in America.\n\nWe are committed to presenting thorough, accurate data, but the fact is that collecting that data on COVID-19 data is a significantly more challenging that it used to be, if the data is even out there at all. Therefore, we will no longer update the data on this dashboard. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to remain vigilant in observing health protocols and guidelines. For more information about broader health outcomes, visit Health in Virginia\n\nFrom cities to rural towns, stay informed on where COVID-19 is spreading to understand how it could affect families, commerce, and travel. Follow new cases found each day and the number of cases and deaths in Charles City County , Virginia . This page will be updated with the most recent data as frequently as possible. The underlying data is available for download below the US county map and has helped government agencies like Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its nationwide efforts.\n\nFor more on how USAFacts collects coronavirus data, read this detailed methodology and sources page."
