        "text": "The Conservation Park of Virginia, Inc. is successor to Virginia Chapter No.1, Izaak Walton Park, Inc. and Izaak Walton League of America. The mission of the Conservation Park of Virginia is similar to that of Virginia Chapter No.1 and Izaak Walton Park but with focus of resources and conservation efforts at the grassroots level in the state of Virginia. Like Izaak Walton Park, Conservation Park is a non-stock, not for profit Virginia corporation with the same members as its predecessor organization.\n\nThe Conservation Park continues with conservation of Virginia's natural resources and preservation of outdoor traditions. Conservation projects include: Bob White Quail Restoration; Wood Duck Habitat Improvement and Song Bird Studies.\n\nUnder pressure from residential development Izaak Walton Park, located in Midlothian on 240 acres, was sold in 1988. The property of Conservation Park of Virginia, consisting of 1500 acres in Charles City County, Virginia, was acquired in 1990. This property is located approximately two miles west of Roxbury at 5100 Charles City Road. The park has two miles of frontage on the Chickahominy River providing fishing and habitat for ducks and other wildlife.\n\nApproximately 1450 acres of the Conservation Park is managed for wildlife, with emphasis on Bob White Quail and duck. Lessons learned at the Park will help management of scarce species in other areas. The Park is a wildlife sanctuary and hunting is prohibited, except as it becomes necessary to control the deer herd.\n\nThe remaining 50 acres of the Park are devoted to recreational facilities. Conservation Parkâ€™s ancillary mission is to provide recreational facilities for members and guests. Facilities consist of skeet fields, trap fields, five stand, rifle range, pistol ranges, archery range, picnic areas, nature trails, and a 3,300 s.f.\n\nclubhouse with a 1,600 s.f. covered patio. Net income from recreational facilities and dues fund conservation.\n\nConservation Park of Virginia, Inc. is a private organization available to members and guests. Memberships is open to anyone in the area of acceptable character and deportment. The initiation fee is $500; annual membership dues are $200. One membership covers all family members in the same dwelling. The Park is also available to Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Lions Club, Ruritan Clubs, 4-H Clubs, the Virginia Game Commission, Ducks Unlimited, Quail Unlimited, and similar organizations."
