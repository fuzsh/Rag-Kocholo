        "text": "Charles City, county, eastern Virginia, U.S., in the Tidewater region, southeast of Richmond, between the Chickahominy and James rivers which unite at its southeastern border. One of Virginia’s eight original shires, it was formed in 1634 and named for Charles City at Bermuda Hundred (Chesterfield County). It has some of Virginia’s oldest and most historic plantations, notably Berkeley, Westover, Greenway, and Shirley. At Berkeley or Harrison’s Landing, where some claim the first Thanksgiving was observed on Dec. 4, 1619, is the ancestral home of Benjamin Harrison, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and of two U.S. presidents—William Henry Harrison (9th) and Benjamin Harrison (23rd). During the Civil War, Berkeley was headquarters (1862) of Union General McClelland, and while quartered there Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield composed the bugle call “Taps.” The county courthouse (1730) is in the hamlet of Charles City (the county seat), and Greenway, immediately to the west, is the birthplace (1790) of John Tyler, 10th president of the U.S. At Shirley, Ann Hill Carter, mother of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, was born and there she married “Light-Horse Harry” Lee.\n\nThe county is tied to Richmond economically, and truck, dairy, and poultry farming are the main pursuits. Area 204 square miles (528 square km). Pop. (2000) 6,926; (2010) 7,256."
