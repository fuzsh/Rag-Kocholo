        "text": "Meet the Families!\n\nSee the Models!\n\nThe project is the first time Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg will build and sell homes in Charles City County, although the Richmond Habitat affiliate previously built a home in the County.\n\nHomes are purchased with a zero-interest equivalent, 20 to 30-year mortgage. Construction of each Habitat for Humanity house is a cooperative effort between volunteers, house sponsors and the buyers of the house. Participating families provide hundreds of hours (called sweat equity) toward building their own and other families’ homes.\n\nWant to Support this Project?\n\nVolunteer!\n\nWe need the community’s support to build these four homes in a timely manner! Once construction starts on the homes, we will be scheduling volunteers here. NO EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY. Habitat’s staff trains every volunteer each morning on that day’s task.\n\nDonate In-Kind!\n\nWe welcome the donation of in-kind goods and services, such as flooring, licensed mechanical services, landscaping and much, much more. Please email info@habitatpgw.org if you are considering an in-kind gift.\n\nDonate Funds!\n\nWe have a few amazing partners for these homes, but the project is not fully funded. Please consider a financial donation to this project, so these four excited families can realize their dreams of homeownership. No gift is too small!"
