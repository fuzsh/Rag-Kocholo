        "text": "Charles City, created in 1634, is one of the eight original counties in the state. It was named after the King of England at the time, Charles I.\n\nThe original title to the primary settlement planted by Sir Thomas Dale in this area in 1613 was Bermuda City. This plantation had the potential to outstrip Jamestown as settlement moved up the James River, but the later governors' support for Jamestown and the \"massacre\" of 1622 shifted the center of settlement back on the lower river.\n\nSince the colony was dependent on royal support, it made sense to honor the King by naming five of the first eight counties after the royal family. The initial settlers in 1607 had already named Cape Charles after Prince Charles, when he was still the second son and it was not obvious he would become King. It's smart to hedge your bets...\n\nJust 15 years after the county was named in his honor, Charles I ended up as the last King of England to be killed in a civil war. He was beheaded in 1649, after Cromwell and his army seized control of Parliament.\n\nThe romanticized flight of royalist \"Cavaliers\" associated with the losing side (as opposed to the Puritan \"Roundheads\" on the winning side) has given the University of Virginia its \"Cavalier\" mascot with the plumed hat and crossed swords.\n\nin 1670, Augustine Herrman mapped Charles City County on both sides of the James River\n\nSource: John Carter Brown Library, Virginia and Maryland As it is planted and Inhabited this present Year 1670 (by Augustine Herrman, 1670)\n\nUniversity of Virginia mascot, the Cavalier\n\nSource: Flickr, Karen Blata - Vironevaeh photostream\n\nCharles City County in 1861\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Colton's new topographical map of the eastern portion of the state of North Carolina with part of Virginia & South Carolina (by Joseph H.
