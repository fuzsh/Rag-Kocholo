Here are some common questions.\n\nWho treats near me?\n\nHow do I contact them?\n\nDo they take Medicaid?\n\nWhat if I don’t have insurance?\n\nAre they going to require sobriety?\n\nHEPC has created a map of locations where treatment is offered through telemedicine, providers trained by HEPC, or by local providers we have researched to find answers to these questions. We will continue to add treatment sites as we identify them and are able to verify their information."
