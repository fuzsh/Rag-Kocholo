Robert Bontine Cunninghame-Graham (1735 - 11 December 1797) was a Scottish poet and politician.[1]

Life[]

Youth and education[]

He was born Robert Graham, the only surviving son of Nicol or Nicolas Graham (died 16 November 1775) of Gartmore, on the borders of Perthshire and Stirlingshire, and Lady Margaret (Cunninghame), the daughter of William, 12th earl of Glencair.[2]

He was educated at the University of Glasgow (UG).[2]

Career[]

From 1753 Graham lived in Jamaica as a planter, becoming the owner of Roaring Hill and Luchy Hill sugar estates.[1] For some time he held the office of receiver-general in that island.[2] He returned to Britain about 1770.

He was chosen rector of UG in 1785, over Edmund Burke,[2] serving in that position until 1787.[1]

He represented Stirlingshire in parliament from 1794 to 1796. He was the mover of a rejected Bill of Rights, which to some extent foreshadowed the Reform Bill of 1832. He was an earnest advocate of the principles of the French revolution.[2]

In 1796, owing to the death of John Cunninghame, 15th and last earl of Glencairn, Graham succeeded to the Finlaystoun estates, and assumed the additional surname of Cunninghame.[2]

He was married twice: to Anne, daughter of Patrick Taylor of Jamaica, sister of Sir John Taylor, bart.; and later to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Buchanan of Spital. He left 2 daughters and 2 sons: William, his heir, and Nicol, maréchal-de-camp in the Austrian service.[2]

Writing[]

Cunninghame-Grahame wrote various lyrical pieces, the best known of which, 'If doughty deeds my lady please,' is deservedly famous.[2]

Recognition[]

Robert Burns – whose patron James, 14th earl of Glencairn, was Graham's 1st cousin – writing to the Edinburgh bookseller, Mr Hill, describes Graham as: "...the noblest instance of great talents, great fortune and great worth that ever I saw in conjunction." [3]

In 1788, Graham donated £100 to establish the Gartmore Gold Medal at the University of Glasgow, awarded bi-annually to students working on ‘Political liberty’.[1]

Cunninghame Graham's poem "If Doughty Deeds" was included in the Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250-1900).[4]

"If doughty deeds my lady please" was set to music by his great-great-grandson, Rev. Malise Cunninghame Graham, and also by Sir Arthur Sullivan.

As an owner of slaves in Jamaica (even after his return to England, and while he was UG rector), Graham was mentioned in the 2018 report, Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow.[1]
