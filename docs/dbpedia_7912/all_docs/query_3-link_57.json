Perpetua roman and Felicity italic type on Arnolds mould-made paper.

Very light fading on spine, interior clean, binding square.\n\n[Pertelote 150].\n\nThis book is important because it was the 150th published by the Golden Cockerel Press: with it they \"completed its 'century-and-a-half'.\" [Pertelote 150]\n\nRobert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (1852 – 1936) was a Scottish politician, writer, journalist and adventurer. He was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP); the first ever socialist member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; a founder, and the first president, of the Scottish Labour Party; a founder of the National Party of Scotland in 1928; and the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934. His friend William Henry Hudson (1841 – 1922) – known in Argentina as Guillermo Enrique Hudson – was an Anglo-Argentine author, naturalist and ornithologist. He produced a series of ornithological studies, including Argentine Ornithology (1888–1899) and British Birds (1895), and later achieved fame with his books on the English countryside, including Hampshire Days (1903), Afoot in England (1909) and A Shepherd's Life (1910), which helped foster the back-to-nature movement of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe GOLDEN COCKEREL PRESS was founded by Harold Midgely Taylor in 1920 with the object of publishing new works of literary significance by young authors and to print and publish fine editions of books of established worth. When Mr. Taylor retired in 1924 it was purchased by Robert Gibbins, known as an illustrator and woodcutter (Tomkinson, p .93) \"Golden Cockerel books are amongst the most popular and desirable private press items.\" (Ransom p. 106).\n\nCondition: Near fine.\n\nItem number: 625\n\nPrice: $225.00\n\nShare:"
