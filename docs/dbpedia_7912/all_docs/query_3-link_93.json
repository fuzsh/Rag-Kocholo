        "text": "What rare spark motivates a man to do the impossible – again and again? What manner of man destroys the boundaries of the word “unobtainable” and replaces it with the words “why not”? Meet Robert Cunninghame Graham, the author of this book and a living legend of the late 19th century. Disillusioned with politics, the famous horseman sought solace in the saddle. His mission? To journey across Morocco in 1897 by riding through the Atlas mountains and reaching the city of Taroudant. Of course there was one small problem. The Sultan had forbidden outsiders, especially Christians, from going there. Don Roberto flouted the danger, saddled his Barb horse and galloped straight into the teeth of one of the greatest desert stories ever told. Disguised in local clothes and calling himself “Sheikh Mohammad El Fasi,” the Scottish author posing as a Turkish doctor was only hours away from the elusive city when he was captured and kidnapped. This book, an instant best-seller, brought praises from Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells and Bernard Shaw, who all agreed it was a rare book written by a man so kaleidoscopic in character that he defied belief.\n\nDecember 9, 2021\n\nRobert Bontine Cunninghame Graham is one of those few travel writers who could be classified as a bona fide savant. Which means it is a positive pleasure to read anything he writes. Reading Mogreb-el-Acksa, I found myself treasuring his digressions as much as the main thread of his narrative.\n\nCunninghame Graham's goal was to reach the forbidden city of Tarudant in Southern Morocco. He never made it. When he was almost within sight of his goal, the local caid had him and his party detained for several weeks. For most writers, that would represent a tragedy. For RBCG, he kept up the quality of his narrative even though he was, for all intents and purposes, a prisoner. Eventually, the caid let him go, and RBCG returned to Mogador using a slightly different route to enable his horses and mules to fill out after having been kept on short rations.\n\nIn many ways, he is like Patrick Leigh Fermor who, like RBCG, realizes that the devil is in the details. Well worth reading s=l=o=w=l=y."
