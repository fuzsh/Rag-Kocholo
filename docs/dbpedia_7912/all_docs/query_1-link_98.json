        "text": "July 22, 2021\n\nThe biggest problem this biographer faced was, despite being dissatisfied with the traditional myth of Gabriela's origins, he published 2 years before her true identity was revealed. Hence, he makes all sorts of suppositions which are, in light of her true identity, nonsensical.\n\nFor much of the book he appears to be over reliant on secondary sources. However, in the latter part of the book he is far better as he cites the primary sources of Gabriela's letters and diaries.\n\nI suspect it won't be until we have a woman writing her biography that we'll really understand her feminism and her becoming an accomplished political orator."
