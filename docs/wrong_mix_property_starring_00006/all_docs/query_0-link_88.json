        "text": "One of my favorite movies! It's a good start but a few things stand out to me. The face has some anatomical/proportional issues you're gonna want to spend more time sculpting it to really get the likeness. The hair looks off and kind of stringy. Try to see the hair as a collection of big clumps and shapes instead of a million strands. The body overall is pretty good proportion wise but the texture in her chest area looks off. It's good to have some discoloration but try to tone it down a bit it so it'll look more natural. The hands are slightly off, it looks like her fingers are the same size. Also, the overall pose looks stiff try to push it further and make it more dynamic, really think the overall silhouette and line of action. Keep working at it though! I hope this helps!"
