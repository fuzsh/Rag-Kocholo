Fox and Daryl Hannah, however the 50-year-old actress announced that the time for the next installment of the fan favorite thriller had passed.\n\nQuentin has directed the greatest blockbusters of the last decade, including his last film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie, however Kill Bill is still one of his most successful movies.\n\nDuring his latest appearance on the Andy Cohen radio show, the director teased the highly anticipated movie and talked about a possible continuation of the story and Uma Thurman’s character, “you know, the Bride has fought long and hard but now I actually have an idea that could be interesting,” adding that he was working on another projects and he “wouldn‘t do it for a little bit.”"
