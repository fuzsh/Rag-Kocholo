        "text": "Fans of the Kill Bill franchise will have some music to their ears.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino has spoken out about adding a third volume to the story of The Bride – or Beatrix – on her quest for revenge against her old lover Bill and assassin Elle who was sent to kill her.\n\nIt starred Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine.\n\nThe first and second volumes came out in 2003 and 2004, and 11 years later the story could be getting an update.\n\n‘Never say never,’ the director said while doing a chat for Comic Con about his new movie The Hateful Eight. ‘We’ll see, when it comes to Kill Bill 3. Uma would really like to do it, we talk about it every once in a while or so…’\n\nVolume two ended as Beatrix plucked out Elle’s last remaining eyeball after killing Bill with the five point palm exploding heart trick.\n\nTarantino suggested that the next instalment could centre around the daughter of assassin Vernita Green, whom Beatrix killed in Volume one. The director said she would be on her own mission for revenge for the death of her mother.\n\n‘We’ve got to wait for Vernita’s daughter to get old enough to go and kill her.’\n\nExciting!\n\nRemind yourself of that grim eyeball plucking scene:\n\nMORE : Here’s Channing Tatum helping Stan Lee off stage at Comic Con like a true gent"
