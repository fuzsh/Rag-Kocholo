        "text": "Kill Bill is a two-part American children's movie written and directed by writer and director (who writes and directs things) Quentin Tarantino who's other writing and directing credits include Pulp Fiction (a film about a young boy who's mother accidentally buys pulp-free orange juice, forcing them to fight the \"No returns\" policy at the Wal-mart they bought it from[1]) and Reservoir Dogs (a film about three poor boys who teach their dogs to swim in a reservoir near their house in order to enter them in a dog-swimming-contest hoping to win the grand prize of one-hundred thousand dollars, bringing them and their family out of poverty[2]). The film is known for it's Japanese, spaghetti western and feminist themes. It is also usually noted for being extremely family-friendly.\n\nThe film stars Uma Thurman as *Beep* also known as The Gimp Bride or Black Mamba, a woman who, after being the best employee for a man named Bill (David Carradine), gets a promotion. She then decides to go after Bill in an attempt to thank him and give him a plate of brownies, essentially \"killing\" him with kindness.\n\nWriting, production and editing[edit | edit source]\n\n\"The writing, production and editing was a one-hundred fifty-five day, fifty-five million dollar mess.\" Said Quentin Tarantino, \"It seemed every time I turned around a mistake of some kind was being made, it was terrible. I'm just glad we came out with even a half-decent movie, much less a great one.\" Tarantino was, of course, referring to the number of mistakes that were made during writing, production and editing, including three large ones.\n\nOne such mistake was the film being so long. Tarantino set out to make one half-hour film, but when e-mailing it to Miramax Films, he fell asleep at the computer and after laying his head down on the keyboard, he coincidentally typed three and a half more hours of script. This, of course, led to the film in question being four hours long. And after filming the movie and realizing this, Tarantino decided to, instead of splitting the film in half, only play it in small theaters that would allow a film of such length. But when telling this to Miramax Films over the phone, Tarantino had a bad connection, causing them to think he said that they should split it in half. Miramax Films released this information to the public and after realizing their mistake, decided to go with it, as not to look wishy-washy. This was the second major mistake.\n\nThe last major mistake was made during editing. You see, the scenes were supposed to be in chronological order, but Tarantino sneezed while editing.\n\nControversy and rating[edit | edit source]\n\nSome have claimed that the film should not have been marketed as a children's film, but instead as a film for adults. And the film almost was. It initially received an NC-17 rating, due to a scene known as The Showdown At The House Of Blue Leaves. The scene shows very graphic images of a man being spanked on the bottom. The ratings board thought it was too intense for children, and was more suited for adults. However, after a bit of arguing, Tarantino and the ratings board came to an agreement: they would give it a milder rating if Tarantino agreed to make the scene black and white. Tarantino did this, and the movie received the G-rating it deserved. Tarantino took some heat for the two hours of raw footage of Uma's bare feet and Quentin himself sucking on them. But he removed the footage and took it home with him to fap to.\n\nThere are cartoons, so that means it has to be a kids movie. Right?\n\nReferences[edit | edit source]"
