        "text": "Click here if you are having a problem viewing the video on a mobile device\n\nOver the weekend, Quentin Tarantino found himself accused of being a stereotypically bullying male director after Uma Thurman shared a story in the New York Times about suffering head, neck and knee injuries in a car crash while filming his 2003 action movie “Kill Bill.”\n\nBut on Monday, both Thurman and Tarantino came out to say that the director’s actions surrounding the car crash and its aftermath have been misunderstood — though the director doesn’t absolve himself of responsibility.\n\nTarantino’s attempt at a mea culpa Monday night, however, may not silence questions about whether he’s simply another insensitive, narcissistic player in a male-dominated industry — especially after it was revealed that he downplayed Roman Polanki’s sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl in a 2003 interview with Howard Stern, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nHe declared to Stern that statutory rape, for which Polanski was charged, isn’t “quite the same thing” as an assault that involves a girl or woman being thrown “down” and violated. Polanski eventually pled guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, but fled the United States before sentencing.\n\nTarantino also pushed back at the idea of that a 13-year-old girl is too young to give consent or that Polanski’s victim didn’t want to have sex, even though she had been given drugs and alcohol. “She wanted to have it,” he said.\n\nTarantino sounded far more contrite in a lengthy interview with Deadline that was published Monday night. He called the violent car crash “one of the biggest regrets” of his career and life. But he emphasized that he thought that shooting the scene in a Mexican jungle would be safe. He also insisted that he didn’t badger Thurman into performing it.\n\n“It was heartbreaking,” Tarantino told Deadline. “Beyond one of the biggest regrets of my career, it is one of the biggest regrets of my life. For a myriad of reasons.”\n\nHe added that the crash affected the famously symbiotic auteur-muse relationship he had with Thurman. He told Deadline, “It wasn’t like we didn’t talk. But a trust was broken.”\n\nThurman’s interview with the New York Times’ Maureen Dowd, which was published Saturday, mostly focused on her allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein, the producer of “Kill Bill” and of Tarantino’s other acclaimed films. In fact, Tarantino became the artist most closely associated with Weinstein’s output of hit indie films, starting with 1994’s “Pulp Fiction,” which also starred Thurman.\n\nBut Thurman also drew Tarantino into a conversation about the dangers of a male-dominated film industry by describing the “gruesome episode” filming “Kill Bill’s” climatic scene.\n\nThe actress also shared harrowing footage of the accident with the Times and later on her Instagram account, though she stated in her caption that Tarantino is “deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event.”\n\nIn her interview with Dowd, Thurman described Tarantino as having a certain cinematic vision of how the scene would come off and said he coerced her into driving a Karmann Ghia convertible that she was told was faulty.\n\nShe said he became angry when she asked that a stunt person drive the car. “Quentin came in my trailer and didn’t like to hear no, like any director,” she told Dowd.\n\nAfter she said she bowed to Tarantino’s demands that she do the stunt herself, she found her fears confirmed when the car crashed. She said she suffered a permanently damaged neck, a concussion and damage to her knees.\n\nBut in his Deadline interview, Tarantino insisted that he believed that driving the route would be safe, He also denied “barging into Uma’s trailer, screaming at her to get into the car.”\n\nThe route turned out to not be safe, with Thurman hitting an unexpected S-curve and crashing.\n\nThurman’s account to the Times initially made it sound as though Tarantino had helped deny her access to footage of the crash that she could possibly use in a potential lawsuit against Weinstein.\n\nBut it turns out that Tarantino located it and provided it to her to present with the Times story, according to both Thurman and Tarantino. He said he also was aware that the Times story was coming and discussed it with Thurman.\n\nThurman agreed that Tarantino had done the “right thing” by taking responsibility and sharing the accident footage, according to her Instagram post. She added that the “real perpetrators” were Weinstein and fellow producers Lawrence Bender and E. Bennett Walsh.\n\nTarantino agreed that Weinstein and the other producers “lawyered up” and left him appearing in the Times story to be the one representing all that went wrong during “Kill Bill’s” production.\n\nBut as for taking responsibility and the controversy ignited by the Times story, Tarantino told Deadline, “I feel like I’ve been honest here and told the truth, and it feels really good after two days of misrepresentation, to be able to say it out loud. Whatever comes of it, I’ve said my piece. I’ve got big shoulders and I can handle it.”\n\nThis story has been updated to include reporting about Quentin Tarantino’s 2003 interview with Howard Stern."
