        "text": "In the Class of … series, Nick Rogers takes a monthly look back at films celebrating their 20th, 30th or 40th anniversary of initial release this year — four from 1984, four from 1994 and four from 2004. The self-imposed rules of the column: No films with an Oscar nomination and no films among their year’s top-10 box-office grossers.\n\nThis is also another crossover with the Coming Around Again series — a new, occasional outing in which authors revisit films from at least five years ago that they reviled or that perhaps never quite clicked for them as they did a consensus crowd. Just a bad day? Not the right time of life for that movie or message? Prescient in a way we couldn’t yet perceive? Each piece will feature sections highlighting how the writer felt the first time, why they wanted to revisit it, and their contemporary opinion.\n\nWhat film is coming around again?\n\nKill Bill, Vol. 2.\n\nReleased in April 2004 (six months after Kill Bill, Vol. 1), this is the second and final installment of writer-director Quentin Tarantino’s revenge odyssey. An assassin known as the Bride (Uma Thurman) attempts to leave her life of murder-for-hire but is betrayed, attacked and left for dead by her contract-killer colleagues at the behest of their brutal boss, Bill (David Carradine).\n\nEmerging from a coma years later, the Bride plots vengeance to pick off all those who played a role (including characters played by Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen) — leading to a climactic confrontation with the titular target, who has more secrets than expected.\n\nHow did I feel back then?\n\nHated it. One star. Likely a heretical opinion to most, and to quote Texas Ranger Earl McGraw: “If you was a moron, you could almost admire it.”\n\nI did not write a full review at the time, but I found little to latch onto in lieu of the synesthetic kinetics from Vol. 1. For what it’s worth, Vol. 1 remains untouched in Tarantino’s filmography as a work of pure, uncut sensation. The sound design roars with more emotive ferocity than most other films in the ensuing 20 years, and the Bride’s battle against the Crazy 88 and O-Ren Ishii’s minions in the House of Blue Leaves remains an all-time great showcase of analog action (even with a ratings board-mandated cut to black-and-white, but more on that later). It’s also perhaps the closest Hollywood has come to the insane climax of The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter, even if co-star and Chinese martial arts legend Gordon Liu has less to do here than there. (More on that later, too.)\n\nAnd as the Bride sauntered further down her route to kill god himself (at least as conceived in her mind), the 1st Corinthians comedown of Vol. 2 felt too much like a sermon — lopsided in its languorous pacing beyond a lacerating clash between Thurman & Hannah and a training flashback in China. For the longest time, I contested that it was Tarantino’s worst film by a wide margin, but I also never watched it a second time despite revisiting Vol. 1 many times over.\n\nWhy did I revisit it now?\n\nLike most films that are Coming Around Again, it was simply time. Vol. 2 was top of mind because it’s freshly 20 years old. Tarantino himself is in the news again with the collapse of his intended next film, The Movie Critic. And with the exception of Death Proof (either truncated in Grindhouse or in its full feature-length form), I have loved every last film Tarantino did before or since. Tack on 20 extra years of living, and perhaps the film’s greater consideration of whether what you’ve done in life is really what you’ve wanted would feel more like an eyeball plucked from its socket.\n\nHow did I feel this time?\n\nOK, so Death Proof (in either form) is actually Tarantino’s worst film. That does not mean Kill Bill, Vol. 2 necessarily succeeds at reconciling the filmmaker’s notions of revenge as both a roaring rampage and a ceaselessly curving path.\n\nTarantino cleaved the work purely for commercial considerations, as Miramax Films’ latitude for artistic indulgence ended with releasing one four-hour behemoth into theaters. While I respect Tarantino’s reluctance to cut anything solely to secure additional showtimes, I lament that decision’s introduction of a different compromise — chiefly that nothing in Vol. 1 appropriately sets a table for the thoughts or talks that transpire in Vol. 2. Maybe that’s fine when everything plays in one fell swoop of a cut, as Tarantino sometimes screens it under the subtitle The Whole Bloody Affair at his New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles. (However, Tarantino is even wishy-washy on this, as Vol. 1 alone is a midnight movie there each Friday throughout May. And the uncut version should be called The Whole Gory Story as referenced in the film, but I digress.)\n\nEven viewed in close proximity, there is a clear burden placed on the back half to handle all of the tale’s emotional weight … and when the Bride still has 60% of her kill list to cross off.\n\nThe black-and-white flashback prologue that opens Vol. 2 surely helped to reorient viewers sketchy on specifics six months later in an era before streaming. But it’s too often chatty for chat’s sake, even as it briefly gets Samuel L. Jackson in the mix of this movie. Do we need to meet the schmo from Austin for whom the Bride was ready to put a life of bloodshed behind her? Their everyday friends? A nervous pastor? They’re all just proxy players and would be better portrayed as such.\n\nThurman and Carradine share a civil but clearly fraught exchange outside the chapel, framed like an exchange of their own vows and in which she tries to forestall his furious retaliation for her sudden departure. But the rest of the sequence feels like a dress rehearsal for the dress rehearsal (to borrow Tarantino’s tee-hee joke about what’s currently transpiring in the chapel). To wit: A much later flashback in full color finds Bill and the Bride chatting fireside, and we see just how transfixed and transformed she once was by his manipulative ways. Here, we also see what truly terrifies Bill now about the Bride being alive: She knows his capacity for humanity, however fleeting it may be and / or merely deployed as a means to an end.\n\nEqually unengaging is an interminable segment of the broken-balls life lived by Bill’s backwater brother, Budd (Madsen), whom we see endure slings and arrows on his job at a strip club. Acknowledging that not every backstory can match the thrilling animation of O-Ren Ishii’s life from Vol. 1, this feels like a mostly pointless preamble to a pivotal line for Budd in the second act: “Which R are you filled with, relief or regret?” It also isn’t the showcase for Madsen that Tarantino believes it to be, and the director deployed him better in The Hateful Eight a decade or so later.\n\nRight there, that’s nearly a full hour of the movie gone, 75% of the story over and Tarantino seemingly adrift amid the spines of his mammoth mind-palace film collection. Once the Bride winds up buried alive near Budd’s domain, Tarantino conserves oxygen for what matters most and somewhat enlivens things.\n\nIf the Bride is to escape the coffin, she must recall the teachings of Chinese grandmaster Pai Mei. Playing a different character than in Vol. 1, Gordon Liu runs away with this flashback portion of the film — dishing out disdainful insults and defiantly tossing back his billowing beard like a scarf. Pai Mei being an asshole is part of the comic fun, but watch how Liu changes the cadence with which he brushes back his facial hair. It illustrates the inspiration toward inward resolve that the Bride must remember if she intends to survive her present predicament.\n\nAlthough the Bride escapes, she is denied bloodlust for Budd — who is instead poisoned by a snake stashed in a sack of cash by eyepatch-wearing Elle Driver (Hannah, in what remains the actress’s career-best performance). Of course, Elle is on the Bride’s list, too, and their brutal fight sequence is handily the film’s highpoint. They tear apart Budd’s trailer (and each other) before the Bride’s unforgettably grotesque climactic move.\n\nThat leaves just Bill and … well, someone else heretofore unseen but teased at the end of Vol. 1 (another moment apparently not included in The Whole Bloody Affair). Avoiding spoilers may seem silly for a film so ensconced in cinephile culture, but anyone who hasn’t seen it should avoid sullying Thurman’s stunning moment of shock upon seeing this character. At the time, I lamented that Bill and the Bride went on to cross ideals rather than swords, that there wasn’t another army of, say, Crazy 176-es for her to mow down. But now, I appreciate how their clash plays out in something resembling the quiet den of domesticity the Bride so deeply desired. It reflects that this confrontation is now more about the Bride’s present sense of self — and what she believes she wants from life moving forward — than any real past quarrel with Bill, even though a showdown of some sort is obviously inevitable.\n\nI could also more deeply savor Carradine’s blend of sadistic masculinity and gentle paternity — showcased during both a moment of pretend play with a violent pretext and the film’s storied Superman speech (clearly meant to reflect Bill’s misinterpretation about the utility and purpose of Superman and Clark Kent more than Tarantino’s own worldview). Carradine’s turn here is so good you’ll wish he hadn’t simply been a faceless menace throughout the preceding installment.\n\nAnd here’s where the separation anxiety hampers Kill Bill, Vol. 2 from a perspective of thematic purpose: Budd’s line about relief or regret hints at key questions all of us must face at different stages of the journey. Is our life more than a series of comforting delusions that trick us into believing every decision we’ve made was what we wanted to do? And if there’s even an ounce of poisonous thought about that person we’ve become, can we ever truly purge it? The whole gory story feels driven by the Bride’s concern that she may be fundamentally and irreversibly bad, that all her mistakes will continue to hunt and haunt her even if she does what the title says, that she cannot meaningfully change for the better even as the events that transpire give her every innate reason and motivation to do so.\n\nIt’s impossible for such considerations not to hit harder with a few more miles on your life, regardless of whether and how deeply you enjoyed putting them on the engine. And Vol. 2 is far from the egregious misfire it seemed at first glance. But I still don’t think it believably addresses the questions it asks either of the Bride or the viewer. Maybe Tarantino buys the homily contained in the film’s closing epigram. Maybe you do, too. I don’t. Can someone be more than just one thing in life? Absolutely. Do I believe this particular instance of that won’t shadow the Bride for the rest of her days and eventually shatter her? Not at all.\n\nWas I wrong way back when?\n\nYes, but there are still reservations.\n\nTo return to Vol. 1 for a moment: The Bride’s bloody fight at the House of Blue Leaves flashes to black-and-white about midway through — for no reason other than to placate the MPAA rating board into giving Vol. 1 an R-rating. Indeed, The Whole Bloody Affair includes this sequence in full color. The Bride does not kill fewer people in the cut version. It’s just a desaturated bloodletting intended to distance and detach your cognition from a more cacophonous crimson spurt.\n\nThis may seem like a small concession, but it feels like a concern that compounds the cumulative charge of Kill Bill both in the moment and over time. Perhaps this is a lesson Tarantino took from this experience to move forward without compromise on subsequent masterworks like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight (which had its roadshow-release cake and ate it, too) and Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood. As revisited, Vol. 2 is certainly an improvement on my initial recollection. But it still makes for a frustratingly inconsistent experience now as it did then."
