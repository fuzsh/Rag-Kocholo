        "text": "Intro and background\n\nI watched a lot of movies and TV shows with my family when I was a kid (some of which I should not have lol). One of the movies I very vaguely remember is Kill Bill Vol 1. I decided to go back and watch it now that I am older and enjoy martial arts, anime, and Japanese media (all of which are relevant to this film). I was shocked to find just how much I love this movie. So we are gonna talk about the many ups and very rare downs of this nostalgic film. After a brief synopsis of the background of the film itself.\n\nThe film is directed by Quentin Tarantino. The actors I was familiar with at least going into it were Uma Thurman (playing the main character “The Bride”), and Lucy Liu (playing the bride’s first target). There are A LOT of things that inspired the creation of this film, which this website tracks pretty well. I am someone who loves Japanese and Asian media more broadly. I also grew up on martial arts films so I enjoyed seeing a lot of that influence in this movie. The movie is about a woman who is almost killed in a massacre that happened at a wedding rehearsal at the hands of a group of deadly assassins headed by her former lover. This causes her to be in a coma and she wakes up four years later to seek revenge on the group she was once a part of. Pretty good concept, but how does it execute this? Let’s talk about it.\n\nThe great\n\nI won’t get into everything because that would take too long, but I do want to touch on some aspects of the movie that are worth highlighting. The first (and arguably most important) is the acting. This movie is telling a VERY emotional story and if the acting were terrible, the emotional beats the movie tries to hit would fall flat on the movie would not work. Thankfully the acting is outstanding! Especially Uma Thurman’s acting. One scene that shows this is when the bride wakes up from a coma. You can see the realization that the massacre happened, it’s been four years, and the baby has hit her and it’s heartbreaking. Uma’s acting truly convinced me that she was in horrific pain and agony. It’s not just sadness and despair she acts out well but also anger and aggression. You can tell when she is holding back aggression in her words, or when there is so much tension because of her determination. Uma Thurman IS the Bride, she truly showed that this character was the brainchild of both Quentin and herself.\n\nAnother fundamental aspect of the film is the action. The story involves the greatest assassins in the world (in the world of Kill Bill), and as such, the combat they have needs to be convincing to show that. I am very happy to tell you that the combat, action, and martial arts are amazing. The opening fight scene is one of the best in the movie. The camera work is well done such that you can follow and get everything that is happening without it being confusing. They use their environment to near perfection and truly demonstrate themselves as being master assassins. The greatest action scene comes at the end and though it may be a tad unrealistic, it nevertheless is visually stunning, gripping, and fantastically choreographed.\n\nWhile there is so much to praise, I could literary go on and on, I will write about a third aspect of the film that makes this movie not just good, but memorable. It’s important for a movie to not just be good, but to be something that plants itself into your memory such that you will never forget it. And for me, this movie does that with several stylistic decisions by the makers of the film. The movie will transition into black and white for a time, they bleep out the name of the bride so you never know her real name, there is a seven-minute anime sequence! This movie does as much as possible to leave an impression on you, and these stylistic decisions help do that. As a part of this section, we should also give a shout-out to the music in the movie. The reason why I remembered this movie for so long is because I still remember the whistling towards the beginning of the film, and the music done by the 5.6.7.8’s.\n\nAnything bad?\n\nIt’s REALLY hard for me to find things that I don’t like or are bad about the film. So I will mention a few things that may rub people the wrong way. One thing may be the excessive blood in this movie. There is a lot of killing so it makes sense there is a lot of blood, but sometimes it’s excessive. Sometimes a link will be cut off and you will see a fountain of blood sprew out of the character. Another issue some may have is the way they choose to tell the story. The movie starts in the present, but the rest takes place in a flashback to show what happened leading up to the assassination we see in the first part of the movie. Finally, the fighting may be unrealistic and that could deter some. This is not an issue till the end where it feels like the character takes on a small army by herself. None of these issues bother me so I do not see them as faults in the film, but what I mentioned may rub some the wrong way so I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nConclusion"
