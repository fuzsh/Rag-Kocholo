        "text": "QUENTIN TARANTINO is back. The screenwriter and director of three of the greatest movies of the 1990s – Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown – has written his first explosive novel.\n\n\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\"\n\n(Ancient Klingon Proverb)\n\nOn her wedding day, an assassin known only as The Bride is gunned down at the altar by the groom (her boss, Bill) and the other assassins in his employ. They fill her with bullets and leave her bleeding to death on the chapel floor. The Bride is expecting Bill's baby.\n\nBut The Bride survives. She is in a coma for five years – a bullet lodged in her brain – and when she wakes up, she is very, very ANGRY. Thus begins The Bride's mission of revenge. She hunts down the assassin group, killing them each in order, saving Bill for last.\n\nKILL BILL is Tarantino at his bloody, kinetic, stylish, and frequently hilarious best. It is a thrilling story of revenge, and a novel which announces Quentin Tarantino as one of the hottest new voices in fiction.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is currently shooting a movie, KILL BILL, in China, California, Japan and Mexico. He descibes it as 'Pure exploitation joy. Kung fu, sex, revenge, murder, blood-gorged frames, fast cars, fast women and a pumping, pulsing soundtrack.' In October 2003, Uma Thurman will KILL BILL in cinemas all over the world. But you can read how she does it this spring.\n\nQuentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennesse in 1963. At the age of 22 he began work at a video shop in Manhattan Beach where he started to write his own film scripts. Tarantino made his first (unfinished) film in 1986 and followed this up with his first script TRUE ROMANCE a year later. He sold this script and his second, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and used the money to start filming his third script RESEVOIR DOGS. Tarantino went on to write and direct PULP FICTION which won the Palme D'Or at Cannes in 1994 and an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. In 1997 he made JACKIE BROWN a film based on Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'. KILL BILL is his first novel."
