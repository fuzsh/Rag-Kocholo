        "text": "1. Made by: Shady , Raghda\n\n2. THE DIRECTOR  Quentin tarantino the director of movies kill bill 1 and kill bill 2.  He used lots of methods and he’s also tried to show the anger in fun.  Tarantino has worked on each scene hardly and used famous music .  ”I wrote this script for Uma Thurman” he said..\n\n3. THE STORY  In fact the story is confusing and maybe this is what makes it interesting.  The movie is made in two parts volume 1 and volume 2. In volume 1 during the movie the name of the main actor (the bride that is taking the revenge) is not said.\n\n4. THE STARS  The main actress is Uma Thurman. She is a 42 year old model-actress with 3 children.  She’s a successful actress and started her work with modeling.  She won a Bafta award, Golden Globe and a Saturn award for the best actress for acting in kill bill 1."
