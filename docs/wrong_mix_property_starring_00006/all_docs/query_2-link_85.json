        "text": "Authors\n\nBasak Göksel Demiray Bahcesehir University\n\nDOI:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.5195/cinej.2012.40\n\nKeywords:\n\nRevenge movies, male gaze, assaultive gaze, Laura Mulvey, Carol Clover\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper provides a comparative analysis of Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill Vol.1-2 (2003, 2004), Death Proof (2007) and Park Chan Wook’s Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (Chinjeolhan Geumjassi, 2005). The primary objectives of this study are: (1) to reveal the gender-biases inherent to the fundamental discursive structures of the foregoing films; (2) to compare and contrast the films through an analysis of the ‘gaze(s)’ and possible ‘pleasures’, which are inherent in their narratives, in relation to Laura Mulvey’s and Carol Clover’s approaches; and (3) to distinguish Kill Bill Vol.1-2 from the foregoing two and the ‘avenging female’ clichés of the other horror/violence movies in the context of the replaced positionings of its protagonist and antagonist inherent in its distinct narrative style.\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nBasak Göksel Demiray, Bahcesehir University\n\nCinema and Television\n\nDownloads\n\nPublished\n\n2012-04-08\n\nHow to Cite\n\nGöksel Demiray, B.
