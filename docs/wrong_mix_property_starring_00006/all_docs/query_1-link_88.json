        "text": "Caution: Blood spraying spoilers ahead! Everyone ready for a\n\nviolent ride? Be very afraid. And Go!\n\nThe Bride, or whenever someone says her name: Bleep, is played by Uma Thurman, a former assassin. She wakes from a four-year coma after being shot in the head by her ex-lover, Bill, to find her baby girl missing from her womb. Follow her around on her vendetta to make everyone who ruined her happily ever after. But first you have to wiggle your big toe.\n\nThis movie was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, and it shows. It really shows. Let’s name some Tarantino tropes, shall we? Excessive cursing, unnecessary violence and blood spray, badass female character, the redneck.\n\nThe soundtrack is god awful, but it works for this particular movie. It’s dumb and cliché, especially in the Japan section of the movie.\n\nDo you like your movie’s sprinkled with live action sequences, anime, and CGI all rolled into one? Well, this film is for you! We’re not sure if it were the budget or Tarantino’s “vision” but it’s definitely out of whack.\n\nStereotypes galore! It’s impossible to not roll your eyes if you have the slightest inkling that Japan is not just samurais and ninja swords. Characters like to bust out their Engrish to show off that they can build a rapport with an American woman before she combats with perfectly enunciated Japanese. It’s terrible how often the movie jumps from one language to another whenever it feels like it. There’s no rhyme or reason, just that it seemed cool to Tarantino.\n\nIn the last half of the movie, we see Tarantino’s wet dream play out. It’s sexual roleplay in Japan with masks and leather. Hey, if you’re into knife play, there’s even that. Coupled with the soundtrack that introduces each soon-to-be irrelevant character.\n\nMeet Gogo Yubari, the stereotypical sweet high school girl with a dark side. She’s apparently the bodyguard of The Bride’s next target: Oren Ishii. Yeah, we know, suspend our belief, but this girl puts up a nasty fight. She uses a flail. Too bad she flailed and killed herself using it.\n\nHere is a clip with the two badass females, The Bride and Gogo Yubari, fighting each other. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGsWYV2bWAc. You can also see Tarantino’s excessive use of violence and blood.\n\nThis movie is not in chronological order. It seems like a messy way to make a movie, but it’s very interesting to watch it play out. For example, in the beginning we have The Bride, who is shot by her jealous ex-lover, Bill, and then it immediately cuts to the present, when she goes for her first kill. Thoughts in our head are going security is just not what it used to be.\n\nWe have some movie crimes to divvy out:\n\nThe yellow jumpsuit juxtaposed against a pristine white kimono in a snowstorm with blood splattering everywhere. Yellow ruined this movie.\n\nThe little girl who plays Nikki, Ambrosia Kelley, is 8 years old playing a 4-year-old. Bad casting. She doesn’t even look four. It’s like they found a random kid on the street and said ‘you! You’ll do’ and just went with it. Like random selection that didn’t work out well. And it was uncomfortable because she didn’t look her age. Plus, she arrived home on a school bus. Four-year olds don’t go to school!\n\nWorks Cited\n\nRo, C. (2016, July 12).
