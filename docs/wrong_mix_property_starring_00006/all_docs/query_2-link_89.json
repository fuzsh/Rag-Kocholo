        "text": "Before Quentin Tarantino announced his “last film” would be “The Movie Critic”, there had been speculation that ‘Kill Bill 3,’ starring Uma Thurman and her daughter Maya Hawke could get done.\n\nTarantino now says, via De Morgen, to get that rumor out of your head: “I don't see that happening. My last film is about a film critic, a male critic and it’s set in the 70s.”\n\nThere have always been rumors of a “Kill Bill Vol. 3” potentially happening. Back in 2019, Tarantino had even mention to Andy Cohen, during a radio interview, that a third instalment was“definitely in the cards.”\n\nTarantino had mentioned that he was in talks with ‘Kill Bill’ star Thurman for a third film, “If any of my movies were going to spring from my other movies, it would be a third ‘Kill Bill.’”\n\n“I just had dinner with Uma Thurman last night,” Tarantino had told Cohen. “We were at a really cool Japanese restaurant. I do have an idea of what I would do with [‘Kill Bill Vol. 3’]. That was the whole thing, conquering the concept. What has happened to The Bride since then? And what do I want to do?”\n\nTarantino added, “I didn’t just want to come up with some cockamamie adventure. [The character] doesn’t deserve that. The Bride has fought long and hard. I have an idea now that could be interesting. I still wouldn’t do it for a little bit. It would be at least three years from now. It is definitely in the cards.”\n\nSo, what happened? Tarantino decided to retire, that’s what happened. He keeps swearing that “The Movie Critic,” his tenth film, will be his final one. And yet, nobody seems to believe him. He keeps getting asked the same question in every damn interview, “are you seriously retiring?”\n\nI kinda, sorta, believe him, then again, Tarantino strikes me as the kind of guy who would definitely change his mind at the flick of a switch. He lives and breathes cinema. Stepping away from it, when you’re at the stage in your life where you can practically get any movie you want funded, sounds damn-near sacrilege for a guy like him."
