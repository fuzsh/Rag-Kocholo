        "text": "This features the perfect honeymoon in beautiful Hawaii, where nothing much happens to disturb the loving couple … well, except for a series of ghastly murders of other loving couples.\n\nA good film doesn’t have to be packed with action, explosions and frights … it just needs a quality script, a solid storyline and people we can sympathise with … and this one hits all the right mark\n\nHow we love our TV wildlife programmes … how you’re going to hate this mish-mash of a film that really doesn’t know what its supposed to be.\n\nSunken treasures, a deadly virus, an African civil war, lots of sand, a bit of romance, some derring-do ... and a screenplay bogged down with not a single, small grain of originality.\n\nBosses of vehicle company Jeep are cashing in on Matthew McConaughey's new desert action movie Sahara by signing the actor and co-stars Penelope Cruz and Steve Zahn up for print adverts.\n\nSometimes you cannot believe what you read in the newspapers. Sometimes, perish the thought, journalists lie, cheat, make up quotes and write stories of events that never happened.\n\nMurphy, an acquired taste, is in dire need of a decent film; this one doesn't count.\n\nWhoever had the misguided notion that Lawrence could ever be an asset to a film? He is the unfunniest of comics and in almost all his dismal films manages to infuriate more than entertain."
