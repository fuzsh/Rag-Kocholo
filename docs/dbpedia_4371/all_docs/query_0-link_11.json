        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Steve Zahn (The White Lotus) is set to star opposite Glen Powell in Chad Powers, Hulu‘s upcoming half-hour comedy based on an Eli Manning sketch that aired on ESPN+.\n\nCo-created and executive produced by Powell and Michael Waldron, the series follows a hotshot quarterback (Powell) whose college career ends after bad behavior. He then disguises himself as the talented and affable Chad Powers, who walks onto a struggling Southern football team.\n\nZahn will play Jake Hudson, the charismatic Head Coach of the show’s flagging college football program. He’s about to be put out to pasture when along comes the talented oddball Chad Powers (Powell) – and with him, one last shot at glory.\n\nManning serves as executive producer along with Omaha Productions’ Peyton Manning, Jamie Horowitz, Ben Brown and ESPN. Waldron, who wrote the pilot script, and Adam Fasullo are producing for Anomaly Pictures while Powell is EPing under his production co-banner Brainstorm.\n\nZahn was recently seen in a heavily recurring role on HBO’s The Righteous Gemstones. He also starred opposite Jessica Chastain and Michael Shannon in the Showtime limited series George & Tammy and was part of the Season 1 cast of HBO’s The White Lotus, earning a supporting actor Emmy nomination. Zahn is repped by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern."
