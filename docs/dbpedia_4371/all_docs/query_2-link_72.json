        "text": "Realist said on 5/Feb/23\n\nI saw him in the movie Suburbia most the actors were pretty close in height. I would give him 5'7.5\n\nSandy Cowell said on 10/Nov/22\n\nSteve may be on the short side, but it doesnât mar his attractiveness. He stars in some ace films!\n\n5ft7.25.\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 1/Mar/20\n\nI do like Steve as the cheeky young prankster, having a laugh at some psychotic driver's expense with his tall bruv, Paul Walker, in 'Joy Ride'!\n\nWasn't the guy on the receiving end young once, the boring old fart? Alas, he doesn't share the boys' sense of humour! ð\n\nStevie-boy gets 5ft7.25.\n\nJacob said on 15/Nov/17\n\nSo would a 171 cm man be 169 cms at night?\n\nKyle said on 31/Mar/17\n\nIn national security looked a tad shorter than martin lawrence i guessed him 5ft7 he could be a weak one although maybe martin is a fraction over 5ft7\n\nberta said on 23/Mar/17\n\nhe looks mutch shorter than 184 billy zane i think he could be 170 cm\n\nHeadman said on 5/Feb/17\n\nWhat would you say his head length is, Rob?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nHeadman, big Steve has a top-heavy head, so his eyelevel to skull is at least the same as eye-chin (possibly a tad more in fact)...so 9-9.25 range I'd have guessed.\n\nArch Stanton said on 12/Oct/14\n\nRob you might want to remove the last comment, that's overstepping the mark I think!\n\nEditor Rob\n\nthe odd spelling mistake is quite forgiveable.\n\nfrank said on 11/Oct/14\n\ni have meet this gay his height is 176\n\nSam said on 7/Aug/14\n\nA 2.5 inch difference with Tony Shaloub is believable from the episode of Monk that guest starred Zahn.\n\nthe shredder said on 5/Apr/14\n\nShorter than Martin Lawrence , 5'7 at best\n\nedguy282 said on 1/Apr/14\n\nI was watching a Friends episode last night with Steve's character and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) in a few scenes together. They looked about 3-4 inches apart. Of course, Lisa, an alleged 5-8 women, might have been wearing heels of 2 inches. So I think Steve's height would be more like 5'6.75, or slightly below 170cm.\n\nJm said on 11/Nov/12\n\nWatch Saving Silverman. Couple inches taller than jack black.\n\njake said on 1/Sep/12\n\ni think 5'7 or 5'8 is right about steve..what about zachary gordon or \"greg\" off of diary of a wimpy kid..cause i know he is growing fast because of puberty\n\nsteven said on 19/Jan/12\n\nhe had tendency to wear thick looking shoes. had a short face does't look 5'7.5 , he is around 5'6.\n\nSilent d said on 20/Nov/11\n\nLeelee was a little taller than him. Paul walker was much taller than him. 5 foot 8 is about right. I don't think he is any taller.\n\nthe dude said on 17/Nov/11\n\nDunno.. 5'7 seems low for him. after watching him in Joy Ride, I think he's at LEAST 5'8\". The supposedly tallish Paul Walker (6'3\") and LeeLee Sobieski(5'10\") don't dwarf him like they should. He's either wearing some massive lifts or is in need of an upgrade.\n\nleonari said on 23/Dec/10\n\nI also say 5'8. Watched \"Joyride\" couple of days ago. Paul Walker who is 6'2 didn't dwarf him...\n\nRostam said on 17/Jun/09\n\nHe looked about 2 inches taller than jack black in saving silverman...I think 5'7 is right on.\n\nMinimus said on 16/May/09\n\nIn Sahara Steve Zahn in slippers looked 1 inch shorter than the 5ft3 Penelope Cruz on 1 inch heels, before taking the boat ride up river. Also, in one episode in Friends when Steve was the `gay` ice-skater and husband of Phoebe, he was much shorter than the 5ft8 Lisa Kudrow. If this is true, he is significantly shorter than 5ft 7.25 inch.\n\nanonymous said on 24/Jan/09\n\nIn sahara he was like same height as 5 foot 3 penelope cruz and 10cm shorter than 5 foot 11 matthew mcconouhay. In national security, he is taller than martin lawrence by an inch or two. In joy ride he was towered by 6 foot 2 paul walker. I would say he's 5 foot 7 and a bit maybe even 5 foot 8.\n\nExplodius said on 20/Jan/09\n\nLeeLee Sobieski towers him in Night Train. I'm unsure of her footwear in that film though. When she walks it sounds like she might be wearing heels.\n\nleonari said on 11/Nov/08\n\nhe is 5'7\" or a tad more 171 is perfect\n\nanonymous said on 11/Nov/08\n\nIn riding in cars with boys, he was taller than drew barrymore by 10cm. She is 158cm. So he is max 170cm.\n\nKari said on 27/Jun/08\n\nI just saw him at the zoo this weekend and he actually looks taller and thinner in person that on the screen.\n\nbensonhurst said on 23/Dec/07\n\nmet steve, he was wearing cowboy boots and i'd say he's a good 5'7 barefoot.\n\nJames said on 16/Sep/07\n\nOk, I just watched Bandidas and he barely stood over both Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek. In one scene he was standing right next to Salma and he wasn't even a half a inch taller. Although she was in figure skates which id say give about 3 inches. Which would make her about 5'5 (if that) So how is this guy over 5'7?\n\nEmily said on 3/Sep/07\n\nUhhh...I don't know. He does seem kinda short. He looks like he would be the same hight as my dad who is 5'7. I don't think He's quite 5'9.\n\nbikagyura said on 31/Mar/07\n\nHe didn't look taller than Martin Lawrence really, in National Security\n\noc said on 5/Aug/06\n\nthey've all got him listed as 5'9\". I've just seen joyride where he's acting with paul walker who's 6'3\" and he did look like the 5'9\" they are giving him!\n\nJoe said on 28/Feb/06\n\nI'd say he is just about 5'8, maybe just under that though.\n\nsf said on 3/Jan/06\n\nNo WAY is he 5'7\"! He's just too short in too many things. 5'5\"? Maybe 5'6\".\n\n5'9\" - now that's a laugh!\n\nMarc said on 2/Jan/06\n\nI had no idea he was so short, but 5'7\" seems right. Next to jack black in saving silverman he had at most 1.5\".\n\nCelebHeights Editor said on 20/Oct/05\n\nHmm, from GreenCine:\n\n\"To reverse a clichÃ©, Steve Zahn looks taller in person than he does on screen. But at 5' 9\" he looks bigger than I expected, as if the camera has been playing him down all this time, the better to make him the short kooky sidekick of the tall, handsome leading man\"\n\nTN said on 1/Sep/05\n\nIn SAHARA, he is standing next to penelope cruz, who is lusted at 5'4\" and they were practically both the same height"
