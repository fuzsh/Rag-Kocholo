        "text": "American actor\n\nSteven James Zahn ( ZAHN;[1] born November 13, 1967)[2] is an American actor. The accolades he has received include an Independent Spirit Award, alongside nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nIn film, Zahn is best known for his lead roles in That Thing You Do! (1996), Happy, Texas (1999), Joy Ride (2001), National Security (2003), A Perfect Getaway (2009), the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series (2010–2012), Cowboys (2020), and LaRoy, Texas (2023). His notable supporting roles in films include Reality Bites (1994), Out of Sight (1998), Forces of Nature (1999), the Stuart Little film series (1999–2002), Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), Chicken Little (2005), Sahara (2005), Rescue Dawn (2006), Dallas Buyers Club (2013), The Good Dinosaur (2015), Captain Fantastic (2016) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017).\n\nIn television, Zahn is best known for his main cast credits as Davis McAlary in the HBO series Treme (2010–2013), Cobi in the Amazon Prime Video series Mad Dogs (2015–2016), Jude Ellis in the ABC science fiction series The Crossing (2018), and Mark Mossbacher in season 1 of the HBO anthology series The White Lotus (2021).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nZahn was born in Marshall, Minnesota, the son of Carleton Edward Zahn, a Lutheran minister, and Zelda Clair Zahn, a bookstore clerk and later a YMCA administrator.[3] His father is of German and Swedish descent, and his mother is of German ancestry.[citation needed] Zahn spent part of his childhood in Mankato, Minnesota, attending Kennedy Elementary School, and moved to the suburbs of Minneapolis for high school, where he acted in school plays and became a two-time Minnesota state speech champion.[2][4] Zahn graduated from Robbinsdale Cooper High School in New Hope in 1986, planning to eventually join the United States Marine Corps.[2]\n\nZahn attended Gustavus Adolphus College for one semester but dropped out after seeing the original West End production of Les Misérables. \"I remember sitting through the second act thinking, I'm as good as that guy standing on the barricade,\" Zahn recalled. \"I wanted to be part of the circus.\"[5] Zahn later enrolled in the Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard University, earning a Master of Fine Arts.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1991, Zahn made his professional stage debut in a Minnesota production of Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues after falsely claiming to be a member of Actors' Equity.[2] Zahn's fellow actors suggested that Zahn study acting, inspiring him to enroll in American Repertory Theater's two-year training program.[7] At A.R.T., Zahn worked with the stage director Andrei Șerban.[8]\n\nIn 1991, Zahn formed the Malaparte theater company with a group of actor friends, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard.[9] From 1991 to 1992, Zahn played Hugo Peabody in a national tour of Bye Bye Birdie starring Tommy Tune, and subsequently appeared in two Off-Broadway plays, Sophistry and Eric Bogosian's Suburbia.[10]\n\nAfter his breakout film role in 1994's Reality Bites, Zahn quickly gained a reputation for playing amiable stoners, slackers, and sidekicks in films such as That Thing You Do! (1996), You've Got Mail (1998), and Out of Sight (1998).[11] In the 1990s, Zahn was often approached by fans who assumed that he was an archetypal Generation X slacker, which was not the case. Zahn has said, \"I'm the guy who gets up at six without an alarm clock. I was always that guy.\"[5]\n\nIn 1999, Zahn landed his first starring role in the critically acclaimed indie film Happy, Texas, for which he won a Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival.[12] In the wake of Happy, Texas, Zahn began playing darker, more nuanced characters. He received Oscar buzz for his role as Drew Barrymore's deadbeat ex in Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), and played investigative journalist Adam Penenberg in Shattered Glass (2003).[13] A longtime Werner Herzog fan, Zahn campaigned for the role of Vietnam prisoner of war Duane W. Martin in Herzog's 2007 film Rescue Dawn; to prepare for the role, he lost 40 pounds by eating mostly raw food.[11][7]\n\nZahn has also worked regularly in television, playing the role of Davis McClary on 36 episodes of HBO's Treme.\n\nIn 2010 through 2012, Zahn gained prominence for his role as Frank Heffley, the father of Greg Heffley, in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series.\n\nIn 2017, Zahn played Bad Ape in War for the Planet of the Apes. He researched the role by watching chimpanzee videos on YouTube, and later said that the motion capture process and lengthy digital takes made Bad Ape \"the most challenging acting job I've ever had\".[14][15]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nZahn met author and theater artist Robyn Peterman, the daughter of clothier J. Peterman, while they were performing in a national tour of Bye Bye Birdie in 1991.[3][7] The couple married in 1994 and have two children.[16] In the 1990s, they bought a cabin in Pennsylvania and then a farm in New Jersey, near the Delaware Water Gap.[17] They next moved to a 360-acre horse farm outside Lexington, Kentucky, where Zahn gardens and raises horses, goats, and sheep.[18] He and his wife also run a local community theater, in which Zahn occasionally performs.[5] He also has a lake cabin near Pine City, Minnesota,[19] where he enjoys tubing and fishing with his children.[20] Zahn is a Lutheran.[21]\n\nZahn is a lifelong military history buff and has said that one of his biggest regrets was having turned down a role in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers.[22] In 2007, Zahn was awarded an honorary Ph.D. in Fine Arts from Northern Kentucky University. A University of Kentucky sports fan, Zahn is often seen at games and events.[23]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes works that have not yet been released\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1992 Rain Without Thunder Jeremy Tanner 1994 Reality Bites Sammy Gray 1995 Crimson Tide William Barnes 1996 Race the Sun Hans Kooiman SubUrbia Buff That Thing You Do!
