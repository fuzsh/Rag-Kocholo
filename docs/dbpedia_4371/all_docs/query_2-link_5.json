Jay learns that Manny's new girlfriend is also his former business partner's granddaughter.\n\nHalloween 3 - Awesomeland\n\nPhil takes over Claire's annual Halloween in order to make a fest of his own. Jay refuses to wear a Shrek costume that Gloria bought for him, preferring to be Prince Charming instead.\n\nThe Big Guns\n\nClaire is furious about neighbours Ronnie and Amber's eyesore of a boat on their front lawn and it soon becomes an all-out war when Phil calls in the big guns as back up.\n\nKnock 'Em Down\n\nJay agrees to sub in on Cam's bowling team for the finals, but Cam was not fully upfront about it being an all gay league, which puts Jay in a precarious position."
