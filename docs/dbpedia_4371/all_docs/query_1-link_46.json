        "text": "Recently, I had the pleasure of interviewing the talented Frankie Rodriguez, an inspiring and enlightening experience. Frankie is an accomplished LGBTQ actor, singer, performer, and entrepreneur. He is most famously known for his role as Carlos in the Emmy-nominated Disney+ hit “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” His portrayal of Carlos, an enthusiastic and confident student choreographer, has resonated with audiences worldwide. Besides his work on Disney+, Frankie has made notable appearances on popular TV shows such as “Bunk’d,” “Will & Grace,” and “Modern Family.”\n\nFrankie’s journey from his humble beginnings in Selma, California, to the bustling streets of New York City is remarkable. While growing up in Selma and attending Sanger High School, Frankie was deeply connected to the Central Valley. After high school, he took a bold step, saved up for a year, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dreams. His dedication and talent quickly set him apart in the industry.\n\nOne of the exciting new ventures in Frankie’s career is his upcoming role in Hulu’s half-hour comedy series “Chad Powers.” He will be starring alongside Glen Powell, Steve Zahn, and Perry Mattfield. The series, based on an ESPN+ sketch by Eli Manning, promises to be a hit with its unique premise and comedic elements. Frankie plays Danny, the mascot of the college football team, a role that he describes as one of the more complex characters he has ever played.\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Frankie is also stepping into the entrepreneurial world with his new nail polish brand, Freeland. Launching during Pride Month on June 25th, Freeland is a vibrant, creative playground where nail polish, colors, and theme parties come together. Inspired by his love for beauty and the success of his Instagram Live nail painting sessions, Frankie developed a line of five rainbow-bright nail polishes. The brand emphasizes self-expression, creativity, and individuality, reflecting Frankie’s flair for style and eye-catching design.\n\nThe nail color names, in rainbow order, are:\n\nPink Fizz Fiesta\n\nOrange Dreamsicle\n\nGlow Stick Dance Party\n\nKiwi Cake Pop\n\nBounce House Blue\n\nFreeland is more than just a nail polish brand; it’s a celebration of fun and creativity. Each bottle is priced at $14, or you can get the whole set of five colors for $60. Frankie shared that he chose the name Freeland because it means “free man” or “free land” in Latin, perfectly capturing the essence of the brand. He envisions Freeland as a platform for advocating for equality and pushing forward the message of self-expression and acceptance.\n\nFrankie’s journey has not been without its challenges. He candidly spoke about the difficulties he faced as an openly gay actor in Hollywood. Despite the progress made in recent years, there is still a long way to go in terms of acceptance and equality. Frankie’s strength and resilience in the face of adversity are truly commendable. He continues to forge ahead, determined to share his stories and advocate for the LGBTQ community.\n\nFrankie Rodriguez is of Mexican descent and is the youngest of three siblings. With a BFA in Musical Theatre from the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA), Frankie’s passion for the arts is unwavering. He is a proud part of the LGBTQ community and a strong advocate for authentic representation and respectful portrayal of queer characters in media. Frankie tirelessly works to create safe spaces for all LGBTQIA+ individuals and is deeply invested in supporting LGBTQ+ organizations and advocating for environmental causes.\n\nAs we look towards the future, Frankie’s goals are clear. He is excited to see how far Freeland can grow and hopes to host real-life pop-up events to bring the brand to life. In his acting career, he is eager to start filming “Chad Powers” and continue exploring diverse roles that challenge and inspire him.\n\nFrankie Rodriguez is a shining example of talent, perseverance, and authenticity. His journey from the Central Valley to Hollywood is a testament to the power of following one’s dreams and staying true to oneself. As he continues to break barriers and inspire others, we can’t wait to see what the future holds for this remarkable individual.\n\nYou can find and follow Frankie on social here\n\nSocial Media:"
