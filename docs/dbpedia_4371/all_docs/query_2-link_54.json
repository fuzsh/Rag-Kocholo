        "text": "We're sitting in a hotel in midtown Manhattan, and Steve Zahn excitedly interrupts our interview to make me try his cereal milk. He and his teenage daughter had dropped by Milk Bar earlier that day, and still had a paper cup of Christina Tosi’s infamous creation sitting at their lunch table. “It’s like milk soaked in cereal, you gotta try it,” he says, not worried about my drinking from the same cup because “fuck it, we’re all healthy.” It does taste exactly like the milk at the end of a bowl of Frosted Flakes. “I don’t know what I think about it,” he says. “It's too weird.”\n\nZahn is our country's most preeminent character actor currently working. He’s the guy you recognize from that thing, whose name is on the tip of your tongue, who you’re always happy to see. He began his career in the theater, but in the mid-'90s found breakout success in movies like Reality Bites, You’ve Got Mail, and That Thing You Do! He’s since gone on to play everything from a cantankerous radio DJ in HBO’s Treme to a CGI ape in War for the Planet of the Apes.\n\nCurrently, Zahn has a recurring role in the National Geographic docu-series Valley of the Boom, which chronicles the dot com bubble and burst of the '90s. It’s an eerie show, and one that shows not much has changed with inflated VC funding and unchecked egos in Silicon Valley. Zahn plays perhaps the strangest character of them all, Michael Fenne, the “founder” of Pixelon, a proto YouTube built on faulty technology by a man who turned out to be on the run from embezzlement charges in Virginia. In the perfect metaphor of the empty facade of tech, Pixelon launched with a multi-million dollar party that got The Who out of retirement to perform, only to come crumbling down when everyone realized it was all built on a lie.\n\nThough Zahn says he’s nothing like the Gen X stoners he got famous playing, in person he's as mellow and affable as any of them, which reads more like \"fun dad energy\" than anything else. He stops the interview to excitedly sing “Happy Birthday” to another table as soon as he spots a waiter with a candle in a cupcake. He laughs and pokes me in the arm when he’s making points. He makes me try cereal milk. Basically, he’s as charming as you’d expect, which is great because of almost any celebrity, Steve Zahn turning out to be an asshole would completely break hearts. But for him, not being an asshole is the key to longevity.\n\nGQ: Firstly, I promised my mom that I'd say she’s been a fan for a very long time. She recently rewatched Happy, Texas.\n\nSteve Zahn: I love that movie. That movie never saw the light of day, you know? It had to do with business. It was an in-house weird thing that happened. And I think it made it to two theaters. I've done so many movies that people are blown away when they find out they weren't successful on a business level. And I find that fascinating. It's like That Thing You Do!: not that big.\n\nWas it really not? I feel like that was everywhere and that everyone I know thinks that's a cultural touchstone.\n\nIt is! But it didn't do well. In the end, I don't concentrate on the business, because I have no control over that, nor do I care. What I care about is the legacy or longevity of your career, and making your peers happy. I think it's the definition of insanity, if you're concerned about something you literally don't have any control over. Why would you put yourself through that? Sometimes we think we are in control of it. We tell ourselves we are. It's like the whole social media thing. What would give you what you're seeking is doing good work. It has to be organic. We have an instinctual kind of response to things. That’s always going to be [true], especially with art.\n\nSpeaking about technology affecting your job, let's talk about Valley of the Boom. Why didn't they make an entire show out of Michael Fenne?\n\n[Puts on Appalachian accent] Michael Fenne. I think it's good that you don't have 24/7 of him. What makes him interesting, in the show, is you don’t have representation of him. He's the most theatrical of all of them. When he comes in, there's not some commentary about what he's doing.\n\nBecause all the other people in it get an opportunity to explain firsthand why there were doing what they were doing. But not with Fenne.\n\nHe’s one of the most fascinating characters I've ever played. By far.\n\nThat's saying something.\n\nWhen I read it, first I thought it was gonna suck. I'm like \"Six hours on the Internet's history? Fuck, are you serious?\" Then I got about 18 pages in and my character does an interpretive dance at church. I was like, \"Alright, well this is crazy. Gotta do this.\" Wig's insane—ramen noodle wig. But what blew me away about the guy was he was successful. He manipulated a lot of really smart people, got a lot done, became very wealthy. He went from zero in the hole to like boom in two years. This guy must be the PT Barnum of all time! And then I saw an interview he did with Chris Cuomo, like in the late '90s. And he's this soft-spoken guy. He's obviously very intelligent but I'm like, \"This is the guy?\"\n\nFenne is this very extreme grifter. But there were all these other people in this industry at the time willing to scam and be scammed. And they were all willing to not look past this because they were like, \"This is gonna make me billions. The Internet's gonna make me rich.\"\n\nHe was just willing. He knew that people would not look past that. Money talks, man. I mean it'll sink the biggest ship in the world. No matter how smart we get, it’s a biblical story. Greed will fuck you in the end, and he knew that. It's happening right fucking now! We're being completely hoodwinked and swindled by an idiot.\n\nYou get described as a character actor a lot. Is that annoying? Or is that accurate? Or is it annoying?\n\nYeah, it's rare I wear any good suit in anything. I'm never doing the [squints eyes and starts talking in a gravelly voice] “You look fantastic, why don't you say we take this upstairs?” thing. I was in theater when I moved here. I was young so I was up for all the lead parts. And you’re like, who got that? \"Oh this guy named Matt Damon. He got this.\" And then I started doing these parts where I was the stoner for like 10 years. And it was like, okay, I guess I'm that guy. And then Dude Where's My Car comes out and I'm like, \"Hey, I didn't read that.\" I've evolved man, I'm not that guy anymore. I'm a character actor, and I'm proud to be one. That's my job. I can go be in a small movie in a really cool part or I can be a lead. I have no complaints. Now I'm the dad in everything!\n\nDo you think there was a reason you were so good at playing those weirdo and stoner roles?\n\nNo. I remember the first stoner. It was a play with Ethan Hawke. Then I did Suburbia at Lincoln Center. But it's Hollywood, man. They'd see you in this part, then they're like, \"Oh get Steve, the guy played that.\" And even though that might be opposite, I live on a farm. I fly fish and I plant flowers. That's like the polar opposite of who I am. But that's what makes it fun and great. Somebody thinks they peg you, and you're like, \"Ah!\"\n\nI feel like you've played your fair share of grifters, including this most recent role. Is there something that attracts you to that?\n\nI've always been attracted to that. Characters who are vulnerable and should have a lot of vulnerability. I mean that's why we like them right?\n\nThat's curious that you’d look at a character like Michael Fenne and immediately see vulnerability.\n\nIf I don't see that, I don't do it. It wouldn't be interesting to play the superhero that way. If I look back at all these roles, that's what's attractive to me. Like Riding In Cars With Boys: he's a fucking heroin addict. He leaves his kid. How do you play that? But you find the hook and you're like, \"No he really wants desperately to be this great person.” I mean you could play Mussolini and you try to find what makes him vulnerable—people liked him right? Somebody had to be friends with him. Eva Braun found something interesting to Hitler, maybe he was funny. I don't know, maybe he was really insecure.\n\nAll those guys were just lashing out because they were insecure about themselves, right?\n\nLook at Trump. I mean he's the most insecure motherfucker ever. You don't have to psychologist to fucking understand that. I'm an actor, I just freaking act. There's part of me that's petrified. There's another part of me that's like George Carlin just sitting there watching the train wreck. I've got popcorn, I got a bean bag chair. And I just wanna watch everybody have arguments about stupid shit. We are the same people who were born 1620. You know with carts and the “bring out your dead,” we haven't changed a bit. But just we have cooler shit and electricity.\n\nWhen you were a kid thinking about what you wanted to do, what about performing attracted you?\n\nI don't think it was something I wanted to do, like as a life. I was not smart. I just did things in the moment. I was like, it's baseball season, let's play baseball. It's football season, let's play football. I wanna be in the play. I was good at it. I was in drama in high school and influenced by amazing people and great mentors. But the realization of it being the thing that I was going to focus on for my life work didn't happen until I was first year in college. I was watching the original cast of Les Miz in London. I was by myself and I was blown away, and it hit me—again, I'm slow on the uptake. It hit me in a moment. I was just buzzing, thinking, \"Oh my god, I'm as good. I'm as good as that guy holding the flag. I'm as good as that guy.\" It wasn't like I'm going to be Jean Valjean. I wasn't like, I'm gonna be the star. But I thought, \"Oh my god I'm as good as that guy. I know I am. I can sing, I can move.\" And I got excited, 'cause it was the first time I had seen something that cool.\n\nThat was the other thing. I was a suburban kid, and then overnight I had to figure it out. I didn't know what that meant even. And because I was good, because I was committed, it worked. Then I learned from other people. It was all other people. And then you go to a training program and work with you know, Cherry Jones, one of the greatest actors, male, female, I've ever worked with. And she was brilliant and she was so influential. But you pick things up. I still do it. Now I find that the stuff that inspires me in life is from younger people.\n\nWho are you inspired by right now?\n\nI'm inspired by my kids. I don't know if I'm supposed to say that but I truly am. I was sitting watching a movie with [my son] Henry the other night, and I so value his opinion about things. He's really a thinker, man. And I thought, \"Wow, I don't wanna ever be the kind of actor that thinks they have it all figured out,\" you know what I mean? We're always looking forward. You're looking up, you’re looking to be older. And then you get older and you have to realize that you're there, and then to have the ability to turn around, the humility to turn around, and look back at a younger person and go, \"No, you know more than I do.\" If I don't acknowledge that, then I'm just gonna fade out. I wanna constantly be challenged and excited. I'm in that moment right now, where I'm turning around and I'm looking backwards.\n\nIt’s now 25 years since Reality Bites came out. And looking at Sammy's character I think it's quite unfortunate but that's an experience that a lot of kids are still going through.\n\nThat's sad isn't it? Yeah I mean we sit and think that we've progressed. We have a black president, you know, things seem to be going well. And then all of a sudden you realize, well, we haven't really solved any kind of racial issues, have we? That's real bummer. And with the gay community a lot of ground's been made but then at the same time it's not. You know there's plenty of examples of stuff where you're like, \"Yeah, but is it real or is it just in writing? Is it just a law?\" He was an iconic character, but he could be played today.\n\nHave you watched the movie again recently?\n\nNo. I've seen snippets whenever it's on. It's dated. It's gotta be dated. But we have the same stories. You know that kind of stuff, acceptance, having to hide. Will it ever go away? I wonder. I hope someday. Unfortunately people grow old and then they get mean. I'm always amazed when a guy yells at the kid for kicking the soccer ball in his yard. Was that guy always like that? I always wanna ask that guy, \"Were you a dick when you were six? No? Did you learn that? Did something happen?\"\n\nDid you anticipate that the issues brought up in Shattered Glass would also still be something now we're dealing with today?\n\nDude isn't that crazy? Okay, number one that's a great movie. That was one I read and I remember calling my manager and saying, \"I have to be in this movie. I don't give a fuck what part. I will play any part in this movie.\" And I was right, it was amazing. But right, that movie isn't dated at all. I've encouraged a lot of people to watch that now.\n\nYou mentioned early on, regardless of their financial success, it does seem like you have a good eye for movies. How did you develop that skill?\n\nYou know it's not good movies, it's good stories. Being in the theater for years was important. When you're an actor in the theater, you're servicing a play. You're constantly trying to figure out the tone in which you're trying to stay within the scene as an actor. In film it gets lost sometimes, because of how fast it's done and the logistics involved to shoot it. It puts it more on the individual because you don't have rehearsals and you don't have the time to talk about what you're doing. But theater makes you look at things in a different way I think. It trained me to pay attention to the story. I just said yes to a script that I'm gonna do at the end of the month. And my manager wasn't very hot on it. And I said, \"When I read it I started laughing.\" I could picture myself doing it and it made me laugh. Now that doesn't mean it's gonna be great or I'm gonna be great or anything. But it's enough for me to do it. 'Cause I can't tell you how many things you read and I have no spark whatsoever. That's why I just keep playing kind of these guys that I feel like I could play. You know, maybe I should try to go play something else.\n\nGo be Aquaman.\n\nAquaman, Jesus. I would laugh, I wouldn't be able to do it.\n\nYou talked about people who have no conception of what people will say about them when they're gone. What do you hope your enduring legacy is?\n\nIt’ll be with the kids. People forget you quick. When I die, you know they'll go, \"Wait, what's that guys name? I can't remember his name but he was really funny. I just liked him in a lot of stuff.\" That's good enough for me."
