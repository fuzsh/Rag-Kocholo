He throws on some clothes, bolts out the door and follows the music. It’s the first second line (a neighborhood street parade) since Katrina devastated the city, and for Zahn’s character, Davis McAlary, it triggers a flood of emotion — excitement, hope, possibility.\n\nAs a DJ and musician, McAlary is an eccentric who’s as smart as he is stubborn. With a teetering chip on his shoulder, his passion for the New Orleans music scene is matched by contempt for authority. Based on real-life New Orleans musician Davis Rogan, who served as a consultant on the show, Zahn’s McAlary is so completely believable, you would think he has some history with the city, but that’s not the case.\n\nZahn, a Minnesota native who grew up in Mankato, spent a few weeks in New Orleans two decades ago while performing in a touring Broadway show. That was the extent of his relationship with the city until “Treme,” which is named after Faubourg Treme, the New Orleans neighborhood where jazz was born.\n\n“I fish and go duck hunting,” said Zahn, 42, who lives on a farm in Kentucky with his wife, Robyn, and two kids, Henry and Audrey. “I’m completely opposite from my character, although I loved the music to begin with and have grown to love it even more since I’ve been here.\n\n“I think sometimes it’s better to come from a different world as an actor,” continued Zahn, who plays guitar and mastered a few licks on the piano for the show. “You have a different perspective than if you were really into it. Someone coming in to play a guy from Minnesota, maybe I wouldn’t do it as good as an actor from Texas who sees things differently than I do — the things that I might take for granted.”\n\nFor Zahn, joining the ensemble cast of “Treme” was an easy decision. He’s a fan of the show’s creators — David Simon, of the critically-acclaimed HBO series “The Wire,” and Eric Overmyer, a veteran writer and producer whose credits include “Law & Order,” “The Wire” and “Homicide: Life on the Street.”\n\n“They’re brilliant,” says Zahn. “They write story well and they write dialogue well and they understand character.”\n\nAs far as characters go, it’s a strong lineup. Along with Zahn’s spacy McAlary, there’s a Mardi Gras Indian (Clarke Peters) coming back to the city he loves despite protests from his children, a trombonist (Wendell Pierce) trying to get a gig anywhere he can to make ends meet, a struggling restaurant owner (Jeanette Desautel), a bar owner (Khandi Alexander) searching for her brother who hasn’t been seen since Katrina, a zealous college professor (John Goodman) with a short fuse and an attorney (Melissa Leo) trying to help find the bar owner’s brother.\n\nThroughout “Treme’s” 80-minute pilot, Simon and Overmyer create a world that feels desperate and hopeful at the same time. John Boutte’s uplifting “Treme Song” provides the soundtrack for the opening credits filled with images of walls caked in mold. Much of “Treme” is like that: the exuberant sound of music — trumpets, trombones, pianos and percussion — offering a support system for folks struggling to get their lives back together after the levees failed.\n\nThe authenticity of “Treme” is partly due to Simon and Overmyer’s decision to use many locals in the show, including musicians Kermit Ruffins, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint and members of the Rebirth Jazz Band.\n\n“Every once in a while, somebody would drive by and scream out their sunroof, ‘Go back to Hollywood.’ And everybody on set looks around at each other and says, ‘Is there anybody here from Hollywood? Everybody lives here. This is a New Orleans show,’ ” says Zahn. “Now, it’s just a question of other people watching it outside the city.”\n\nComing on the heels of “The Wire,” Simon’s gritty, absorbing look at the guts of Baltimore through the eyes of drug dealers, politicians and cops, “Treme” has a lot of hype to live up to. Zahn thinks it can handle the pressure:\n\n” ‘The Wire’ was brilliant, but again, it’s the same guys with the same voices who deal with their subject matter in the same sensitive way,” says Zahn. ” ‘Treme’ will be as good as ‘The Wire’ and maybe more accessible because of the music. New Orleans is a place everybody knows about and has an opinion about even if they haven’t been here.”\n\nAmy Carlson Gustafson can be reached at 651-228-5561.\n\nWhat: “Treme,” new series about post-Katrina life in New Orleans by David Simon and Eric Overmyer featuring Minnesota native Steve Zahn\n\nWhen: 9 p.m. Sunday\n\nWhere: HBO\n\nGOING TO NEW ORLEANS?\n\nHere are Steve Zahn’s recommended stops to hear music next time you’re in the Big Easy.\n\nd.b.a: “If you’re going to go out down here and have a good time and see music, you want to go to Frenchman Street.
