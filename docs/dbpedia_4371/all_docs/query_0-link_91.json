        "text": "In preparation for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, I rewatched one of my favorite trilogies of all time. I’m elated that all three films have available audio description… somewhere. For me, I bought the trilogy in the Apple Store, to make sure I have all three. I have VlueRays of all three as well. I’ve seen Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes probably 4 times prior to this, Dawn probably twice, and admittedly I think I had only seen War once. Rise of the Planet Of The Apes has audio description provided by Deluxe, written and narrated … Continue reading Rise, Dawn, and War For The Planet Of The Apes\n\nI just saw some encouraging news for fans of Twisted Metal. The debut of that series (which I will start soon) is considered to be Peacock’s most watched comedy original thus far. So if you wanted a second season, there’s a good chance. Then again, FOX did cancel and ship off their most watched series because it was too expensive, so there’s that. 13) 8 Simple Rules (Disney Plus) English Audio Description?: No Status: Ended Considering a large chunk of what makes this episode funny is some physical comedy from john Ritter, I’d say his storyline didn’t work for me. … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 08/09/23\n\nJust a small note to kick us off today, if you happened to be one of those fans who loved Grease: Rise Of The Pink Ladies, and were broken when paramount Plus cancelled the series and dropped it, good news! It is getting a physical media release. So you can own it forever and ever. No word on if the audio description will follow it to the DVD release. 11) Futurama (Hulu) English Audio Description?: No Status: revival (Season 11) is now available. So I’m still on Season 2. It’s gonna take me a while to get to 11. The … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 07/24/23\n\nNBC announced some solid news items yesterday. Apparently, they were the only smart network, and actually have episodes banked. So, in the fall, new episodes of Magnum PI, Quantum Leap, and two new dramas, Found, and The Irrational will be airing opposite reality shows and reruns from other networks. 12) The Golden Girls (Hulu) English Audio Description?: Yes Status: Ended I’m not going to deep dive this episode, but the direct answer is that this episode wouldn’t exist in todays landscape. Sure, someone will point out that deep inside the barrage of offensive jokes is a heart somewhere, which is … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 07/19/23\n\nEmmy Nominations are being announced at 11:30EST this morning. may the odds be ever in your shows favor. Unless your show is Yellowstone. In which case, you’ll need much more than a Hunger Games quote for a show the Emmy voters continuously ignore. 11) American Born Chinese (Disney plus) English Audio Description: Yes Status: Not Yet Renewed Perhaps this should have been the pilot. It goes much deeper into the other realm of Monkey business this show hints at. it’s such a weird show. I feel like it’s this great 10,000 piece puzzle that the picture looks great on the … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 07/11/23\n\nBy the way, there’s never been a better time to catch up on a show. If there’s something you didn’t watch initially, and were worried you’d never catch up on, the writers strike and possible actors strike will mean a lot of shows that would have returned in September, won’t be. 13) The Family Stallone (Paramount Plus) English Audio Description?: Yes Status: Renewed It’s just not my type of show. Even with Sly in it. I just don’t get this brand of programming. So, while I’m not mad at this show, I’ll be freeing up a slot in my weekly … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 07/05/23\n\nAfter The Other Two dropped their big bomb yesterday, Reservation Dogs followed them with the exact same announcement, that the 3rd season will be it’s last. I remember when most shows wanted to hit season 4 because it put syndication into play, but with shows no longer running 22 episode seasons, there’s no need for that. Reservation Dogs would need nine seasons to get to that point. Also, ABC is sticking with Home Economics a little bit longer. A huge show of good faith, the network has extended the contracts for the cast while waiting decision on a renewal. I … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 06/29/23\n\nAfter The Other Two dropped their big bomb yesterday, Reservation Dogs followed them with the exact same announcement, that the 3rd season will be it’s last.

They’re the kind of comedies that are charming enough, but somehow don’t reach that top level of romantic comedy where they live forever, like Pretty Woman, arguably always a solid standard. But while Reese Witherspoon can make a good case that she too has classics with Sweet Home Alabama and Legally Blonde, Ashton Kutcher seems to be a bit more populated by likely forgotten titles like Just Married, … Continue reading Your Place Or mine\n\nWhere I Watched it: Disney Plus English Audio Description?: Yes I’m not really sure what the strategy here is at Disney, to waste money on crappy animated sequels no one wants, but then again…. That’s what Disney is known for. If you remember all those straight to video Disney sequels from back in the day that no one asked for, most of them are not good, and totally unnecessary. Did we need a sequel to Bambi? But I think what makes this the most frustrating thing is that it’s a sequel to a live action franchise. And, yes, since this … Continue reading Night At The museum 4\n\nStarring: Paul Bettany, Sophia Lillis, Peter Macdissi, Steve Zahn, Judy Greer, Margo Martindale, Lois Smith, Stephen Root, and Colton Ryan. Directed By: Alan Ball Where I Watched It: Amazon English Audio Description Available?: Yes Description Provided By: The Media Access Group narrated By: Adrienne Barbeau The Plot: Told as a coming of age story from a young female’s perspective (Lillis), she talks about her opportunity to go to college at the same school where her beloved Uncle Frank (Law) teaches. For some reason she’s not quite sure of, Frank has never quite fit in with the family, especially her grandfather … Continue reading Uncle Frank\n\nStarring: Neil Patrick Harris, Steve Zahn, June Diane Raphael, Winslow Fegley, and David Cross. Directed By; Michael Dows Where I Watched it: HBO MAX English Audio Description Available?: Yes The Plot: In present day, a father (Harris) deals with his daughter requesting a cell phone for Christmas by recounting when he was eleven and really wanted a Nintendo for Christmas. What Works: Look, I know this film isn’t reinventing the wheel here. The storytelling aspect that helped make The princess Bride such a hit, as it cut back and forth between the banter from Peter Falk and Fred Savage, and … Continue reading 8 Bit Christmas"
