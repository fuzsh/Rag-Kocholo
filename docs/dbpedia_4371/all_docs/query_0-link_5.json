        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% LaRoy, Texas (2023)\n\nLowest Rated: 2% Strange Wilderness (2008)\n\nBirthday: Nov 13, 1967\n\nBirthplace: Marshall, Minnesota, USA\n\nActor Steve Zahn's roots were on the dramatic stage, which might have seemed surprising considering his big screen comedy career playing inept sidekicks in films like \"Out of Sight\" (1998), \"Happy, Texas\" (1999), and \"Riding in Cars with Boys\" (2001). But the appeal of Zahn's comic relief was the realism and vulnerability he lent his oddball misfits, and as he aged into new territory with Werner Herzog's \"Rescue Dawn\" (2007) and the epic Western \"Comanche Moon\" (CBS, 2007-08), it became clear that his light touch belied an actor with a much wider range than \"stoner bud.\"\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% LaRoy, Texas 95% Blaze 94% War for the Planet of the Apes 94% Out of Sight 93% Cowboys 93% That Thing You Do! 92% Dallas Buyers Club 92% Shattered Glass\n\nPhotos\n\nSteve Zahn A PERFECT GETAWAY, from left: Kiele Sanchez, Milla Jovovich, Steve Zahn, 2009.
