        "text": "Steve Zahn a master of 'comic idiot' role\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nOctober 10 - This is a Happy story.\n\nAmong fervent moviegoers, Steve Zahn has become a favorite character actor of the moment. He's been called a master of the \"comic idiot'' role for his performances as an oddball, slow-witted and somewhat-confused sidekick/best friend in \"Forces of Nature,'' \"Safe Men'' and especially \"Out of Sight.'' Alas, unless you see a lot of movies, you may not know Zahn. He hasn't been in many big hits. But that could change with \"Happy, Texas,'' the goofy comedy that opens Friday at area theaters.\n\nZahn and Jeremy Northam star as two escaped cons who wind up posing as gay beauty-pageant organizers in the small Texas town of Happy. Zahn's Wayne Wayne Jr. is a tempestuous, stupid, runty guy with shaggy hair and a droopy mustache who has a tendency to mumble when speaking and scream with rage.\n\nForced to pose as a guy with talent, Wayne becomes committed to showing 8year-old girls how to sing and dance when he can do neither. And he falls for their boisterously innocent teacher, Ms. Schaefer (Illeana Douglas). This surprises her, since she believes he's gay. \"That whole gay thing is just kind of a hobby, really,'' he explains.\n\nAt the Sundance Film Festival, where it premiered as an independent production and was one of the most popular movies, Zahn won a special award for comedic acting. And at the Toronto International Film Festival, distributor Miramax Films debuted a \"Happy, Texas'' marketing campaign based on Zahn - his hirsute visage is featured on both the film's press packet and one of its posters. (Miramax purchased it at Sundance after a bidding war.)\n\nHe should be happy, right? \"That's flattering, but I don't think that services this movie at all,'' Zahn says, looking relaxed and unassuming in his Toronto hotel room. His hair is short and uneccentric. \"They're banking on the fact that someone will see me in that and say, \"Oh, let's go see that movie.'- '' But, this interviewer interjects, that's based on the indisputable fact that Zahn's performance is unforgettable. \"Yeah, but after you see the movie, not before,'' he says.\n\nTraveling man\n\nZahn trained with the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass., and traveled with a touring production of \"Bye, Bye Birdie'' before getting his first movie role in \"Reality Bites.'' He admits he has tended to look for comic roles as often as possible.\n\n\"It's a selfish thing, but if I'm going to work on something for three months, then I hope I'm laughing,'' he says. To a large extent, Wayne Wayne Jr. is Zahn's creation, although \"Happy, Texas'' was written by director Mark Illsey, Ed Stone and Phil Reeves. Zahn has become pro tective of Wayne.\n\n\"Wayne Wayne, Jr. is not dumb by any means,'' Zahn says. \"He's a convict and he's screwed up in that way. And he's maybe not the most social guy in the world. But that doesn't mean anything.''\n\nAs an actor, Zahn believes in details, details, details. He needs to transform himself to look like the kind of person he's playing. That's the opposite of, say, Harrison Ford - who doesn't remove his earring even while playing a tough-as-nails cop in \"Random Hearts.''\n\n\"When you're 9 years old and you play Army in the backyard, if you've got your uncle's Army fatigues from Korea on you're cool,'' Zahn says. \"But if you're wearing a green shirt your mom bought at Target, it's green but it's not the real thing. You don't feel like your uncle, you feel like some kid with (a shirt) your mom bought.\n\n\"It's like that. You want to have the stuff - it makes you feel not like yourself.'' Plenty of stuff\n\nWith the \"stuff'' that Zahn has given him, Wayne could as easily be out of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' as a comedy like \"Happy, Texas.''\n\n\"If I was driving down the road and saw a guy hitchhiking in coveralls, he'd look like Wayne,'' Zahn says, laughing.\n\n\"Who'd be the last guy you'd want in charge of 8-year-old girls? It'd be the classic prisoner from Texas.''"
