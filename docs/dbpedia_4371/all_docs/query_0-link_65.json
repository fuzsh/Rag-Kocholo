        "text": "The National Rifle Association has become a toxic brand.\n\nCompanies and politicians are waking up to how destructive the NRA is to this country and are leaving it as fast as they can. They realize the NRA of today is not what it once was, and the majority of Americans want sensible gun legislation that doesn’t interfere with the Second Amendment.\n\nSince I was 10, I have been a gun owner. I have many guns now, which I use for target shooting and hunting. If someone breaks into my home, I have a 12 gauge. All my friends hunt. I am a member of my local shooting range and conservation club. In short, I would love to join the NRA. Except the NRA of today no longer represents me or my friends.\n\nI want the NRA to be the NRA of my childhood. The NRA of my dad and my grandfather -- the one I would be proud to join and the one that teaches hunter and gun safety, marksmanship and responsible citizenship.\n\nThe NRA today has almost nothing to do with that.\n\nSteve Zahn, Madison"
