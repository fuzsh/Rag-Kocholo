        "text": "In May 2011, Zahn traveled from New Orleans (where he lived while shooting Treme (2010)) to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to help with the relief effort in the aftermath of the massive EF4 tornado that struck Tuscaloosa in April 2011. The tornado killed 53 people in the Tuscaloosa area and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. Zahn helped clear debris left by buildings and trees with little fanfare or press attention.\n\nI still really love acting. I find it really challenging. And I really love film; it's a lot of fun. Theater is a big commitment. Most of the time, you sign a five-month contract. You do eight shows a week and have one day off. There's no time to go home.\n\nThe definition of Sahara is '\"to have no memory\", and it's true. When you go out in the desert, no matter what's going on in your world, you see the dunes and nothing else, and you think of nothing else."
