        "text": "Season 2 of “Silo,” Apple TV+‘s dystopian drama about a community that resides in a giant underground silo, has been slated for a Nov. 15 release, with “The White Lotus'” Steve Zahn set to join the cast for the show’s second venture.\n\nThe news was unveiled during a panel at the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con, which featured series star and executive producer Rebecca Ferguson (“Dune,” “Mission: Impossible”), star Common (who plays Robert Sims), creator/showrunner Graham Yost and executive producer Hugh Howey with a special appearance by Zahn.\n\nBased on Howey’s New York Times bestselling trilogy “Wool,” “Silo” is the story of the “last ten thousand people on earth and their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside,” the series’ logline reads.\n\nIn addition to Ferguson, Common and Zahn, “Silo” season two stars Tim Robbins, Harriet Walter, Chinaza Uche, Avi Nash, Alexandria Riley, Shane McCrae, Remmie Milner, Clare Perkins, Billy Postlethwaite, Rick Gomez, Caitlin Zoz, Tanya Moodie and Iain Glen.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Ferguson reflected on her character Juliette Nichols—who begins the series by questioning what life outside their contained existence might be.\n\nWhen reflecting on fans’ labeling of her character as a “badass,” Ferguson said, “The word badass doesn’t mean that she is constantly out struggling and doing cool shit. It is decisions, it’s consequences, it’s rawness, it’s sadness. It’s constantly meeting something hard, and getting over it and finding a new solution. And that’s sort of the heart of the character.”\n\nThe complete first season of “Silo” is now streaming globally on Apple TV+, with the 10-episode second season premiering with one episode on Nov. 15, followed by one new episode every Friday through Jan. 17, 2025."
