        "text": "The One with Phoebe's Husband\n\nThe gang is amazed to learn that Phoebe married a gay Canadian ice dancer to help him get his green card. And Ross seeks relationship advice from Rachel after revealing that he and Julie have yet to consummate their relationship.\n\nWon't You Be Our Neighbor\n\nPhil is selling the house next door and he and Claire are excited by the prospect of having wonderful new neighbors, but that quickly turns into panic when a loud and obnoxious couple come to look at the house. Jay forbids Manny to see his new girlfriend when he realizes sheâs the granddaughter of his biggest business rival, leading to a clash of the closet titans. Elsewhere, Mitch and Cam are determined to switch Lily out of Mrs. Plankâs class since she is known to rule with an iron fist â not to mention she scares them too.\n\nHalloween 3: Awesomeland\n\nEven though Halloween is Claireâs holiday, she allows Phil to take over this year so instead of her usual fright-fest theme, he decides to turn the house into AwesomeLand! Gloria picks out Princess Fiona and Shrek costumes for her and Jay but Jay decides he wants to be Prince Charming complete with a full head of gorgeous hair, and with the hair comes a new sense of confidence. Elsewhere, Cameron gets overwhelmed by the dayâs activities and Mitchell has closing arguments for a huge case, and it doesnât help that the stenographer is dressed like a spider.\n\nThe Big Guns\n\nClaire is furious about neighbors Ronnie and Amberâs eye-sore of a boat on their front lawn and it soon becomes an all-out war when Phil calls in the âbig gunsâ as back up -- his dad Frank and all his retired friends to give them a taste of their own medicine. Elsewhere, Jay is trying to potty train Joe but Gloria does not think heâs ready yet, and Cam secretly takes Lily to clown school behind Mitchellâs back.\n\nKnock 'em Down\n\nJay agrees to sub in on Camâs bowling team for the finals but Cam was not fully upfront about it being an all gay league, which puts Jay in a precarious position. Phil and Claire have a surprisingly good time with unlikely dinner companions, their neighbors Ronnie and Amber, and Gloria and Mitch agree to go clubbing with Haley to prove theyâre still young and fun but they didnât anticipate the pre-party portion of the night."
