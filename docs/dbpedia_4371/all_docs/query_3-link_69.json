        "text": "Steve Zahn has joined Glen Powell in the upcoming Hulu comedy series “Chad Powers,” Variety has learned.\n\nThe series was originally picked up at Hulu in February. Powell will star in the series in addition to co-creating and co-writing the pilot with Michael Waldron, with both serving as executive producers. The show is based on the Chad Powers character created by Eli Manning for his EPSN+ docuseries “Eli’s Places.” Manning wanted to learn more about the walk-on process for college football, so he donned a wig and prosthetic makeup so he could go undercover during the Penn State football tryouts.\n\nThe official description for the series states, “When bad behavior nukes hotshot QB Russ Holliday’s (Powell) college career, he disguises himself and walks onto a struggling Southern football team as the talented, affable Chad Powers.”\n\nZahn will play Jake Hudson, described as “the charismatic head coach of a flagging college football program. He’s about to be put out to pasture when along comes the talented oddball Chad Powers – and with him, one last shot at glory.”\n\nZahn’s past TV credits include Season 1 of “The White Lotus,” for which he earned an Emmy nomination for best supporting actor in a limited series. He has also been in shows like “The Righteous Gemstones,” “George and Tammy,” and “Treme.” Zahn is also known for his work in the rebooted “Planet of the Apes” franchise as well as for features such as “Reality Bites,” “Saving Silverman,” “Sahara,” and “Shattered Glass.”\n\nHe is repped by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and Sloane Offer.\n\nIn addition to Powell and Waldron, Manning will executive produce along with his brother Peyton Manning via Omaha Productions as well as Jamie Horowitz and Ben Brown. Adam Fasullo of Waldron’s Anomaly Pictures will also executive produce, as will ESPN. Powell will executive produce under his Barnstorm Productions banner. 20th Television is the studio."
