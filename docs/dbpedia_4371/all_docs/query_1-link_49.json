        "text": "\"The White Lotus\" is about to blossom again on HBO, and we can't wait to see the new twisted, tangled stories at the luxury resort — set this time in Sicily, Italy — with some of our favorite cast members returning from Season One and a whole slew of newcomers.\n\nThe new trailer, released on Oct. 6, sets the stage quite nicely — and might tempt you to buy a hotel robe dupe to wear while watching the show.\n\nIf you’re all primed after watching that, here’s what we know so far about the upcoming second season of the series, which picked up 10 Emmy awards for its first go-around (in Hawaii):\n\nWhen and where will Season 2 of 'The White Lotus' premiere?\n\nCatch the first episode on Oct. 30 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. Happy early Halloween!\n\nWhich cast members from Season 1 are returning?\n\nEmmy winner Jennifer Coolidge, for one.\n\nAs Tanya McQuoid, Coolidge arrived at the White Lotus resort in Hawaii last season in a bit of a state, and took a while to free herself from her (late) mother's influence.\n\nBy the end of that season, she'd dashed a hotel worker's dreams of opening up a spa — but finally released her mother's ashes into the ocean, so you could call it a productive trip.\n\nAll that, and she met someone. \"BLM Greg\" (Jon Gries), who Tanya met at the end of last season, is also back — with a wedding ring. The couple got married, though Greg isn't thrilled Tanya brought her assistant (Haley Lu Richardson) along. \"She won't be in our bed and stuff,\" Tanya says, defending herself.\n\nAlas, it doesn't appear that any other familiar faces from Season 1 are set to appear, which means we'll miss Steve Zahn, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon and Sydney Sweeney, for starters.\n\nWho is learning the cast in Season 2?\n\nFortunately, the new cast looks pretty stellar. The season is expected to at least partially focus on Michael Imperioli, who many will know from \"The Sopranos.\"\n\nHe'll be playing Dominic DiGrasso, a guy who — in the trailer— has no trouble balancing sight-seeing with his father and son played by F. Murray Abraham and Adam DiMarco and hiring sex workers.\n\nAubrey Plaza has signed on as Harper Spiller, who's on vacation with her husband and their two friends. Other names who've been announced are Tom Hollander, Haley Lu Richardson, Theo James, Meghann Fahy and Will Sharpe.\n\n\"We were shooting near an active volcano, so I would say there was a volcanic energy — and we all felt it,\" Plaza told TODAY during a visit in August. \"There’s something in the water. There’s something in the air. A wild energy, and we all took it on.\"\n\nWhere is season 2 of 'The White Lotus' set?\n\nThe \"White Lotus\" is a chain of resorts, so while we're back to the Lotus, this season takes place in the the chain's Sicily location.\n\nThe Italy-set season was filmed mostly at the Four Seasons San Domenica Palace hotel in the town of Taormina, reports House Beautiful. (The first season of the show was also filmed at a Four Seasons, but in Maui, Hawaii.)\n\n\"It was so fun,\" Plaza noted on TODAY. \"The cast was incredible. I got to be around Jennifer Coolidge, who is a goddess.\"\n\nSounds like we're up for another roller coaster adventure, starting Oct. 30!"
