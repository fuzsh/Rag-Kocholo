        "text": "There are some sharp ideas tucked alongside the tedious high jinks and rank sexism of “Dillinger Is Dead.” Directed by the Italian provocateur Marco Ferreri (1928-1997), this 1969 curio first popped up at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970 but is only now receiving American distribution. Although it’s easy to see why buyers initially passed on the film, a clumsy attempt to translate radical social theory into cinema, it remains worth a look. That’s largely because its star, Michel Piccoli, is always worth a look, even when he isn’t given much to work with, and because of what the film suggests about the limits of certain types of political art. It will play at the BAM Rose Cinemas for one week before going into limited national release.\n\nThe loose, episodic story written by Mr. Ferreri and Sergio Bazzini opens abruptly with Mr. Piccoli’s character, Glauco, standing in a noisy room that looks like some kind of factory or laboratory. Glauco, who is apparently an industrial designer, has created a gas mask that’s being tested inside a sealed chamber. The experience of wearing a mask mirrors the alienation we experience in the world, says a man in a white lab coat, who then invokes the social theorist Herbert Marcuse. Glauco looks too distracted to appreciate the weight of these comments, which, in any event, seem more directed at us. The man continues to play with this intellectual thread in the next scene. Glauco just waves a pocket watch at him.\n\nUnder the cloak of dark he returns home to a drowsy wife (Anita Pallenberg) in bed and dinner on the table. After sampling the meal, he sets about preparing an alternative. During his preparations he discovers a carefully wrapped gun that might have been owned by the American gangster John Dillinger, who appears briefly in black-and-white newsreel footage. Glauco continues making dinner even as he dismantles, lubricates (with olive oil), reassembles and paints the gun (red with white polka dots). In time the meal is consumed and the gun, of course, discharged. He splits and heads out to sea where, nominally free from his bourgeois fetters, he sails to Tahiti in the company of a nubile young thing in a green bikini.\n\nMr. Ferreri isn’t just nodding at Marcuse: the entire film seems to be an attempt to give narrative shape to his ideas about domination and social control in advanced industrial societies. Although Marcuse believes that bourgeois art is defanged (“the music of the soul is also the music of salesmanship”), at its best art represents what he calls “the Great Refusal  the protest against that which is.” Over his long night Glauco undergoes a transformation that directly invokes the mythic figure Orpheus, whom Marcuse sees as a symbol of the Great Refusal. Orpheus represents liberation through “the redemption of pleasure, the halt of time, the absorption of death; silence, sleep, night, paradise,” virtues that Mr. Ferreri attempts to replicate in “Dillinger Is Dead.”\n\nAnd so Glauco redeems pleasure by making food, watching movies, spying on his seminude maid and abusing his zonked-out wife with a toy snake and worse. The film itself comes close to stopping time, mostly through long boring scenes of Glauco doing nothing much at all. There is silence and sleep and night and paradise, true. But these potentially liberating moments, which might have been given intriguing form by more careful hands, register as self-indulgent noodling. All this might be tolerable if Mr. Ferreri’s attitude toward women were not as ugly as his sloppy visual style. But Mr. Ferreri, whose best-known film is “La Grande Bouffe” (1973), about some men who eat themselves to death, is clearly more committed to administering shocks in this film than in examining his own contribution to social domination.\n\nDILLINGER IS DEAD\n\nOpens on Friday in Brooklyn.\n\nDirected by Marco Ferreri; written by Mr. Ferreri and Sergio Bazzini; director of photography, Mario Vulpiani; edited by Mirella Mercio; produced by Ever Haggiag and Alfred Levy; released by Janus Films. At the BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn. In Italian, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. This film is not rated.\n\nWITH: Michel Piccoli (Glauco), Anita Pallenberg (Ginette) and Annie Girardot (Sabine)."
