        "text": "Michel Piccoli, an actor whose quiet intensity and mature sensuality made him a fixture of French cinema for more than a half-century, died on May 12, it was announced on Monday. He was 94.\n\nThe cause was a stroke, according to his wife, Ludivine Clerc, who confirmed his death in a short statement issued on her behalf by Gilles Jacob, former president of the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nA veteran of the French stage, Mr. Piccoli also had more than 40 feature films and television movies on his résumé. He was in his late 30s when he starred in Jean-Luc Godard’s acclaimed drama “Contempt” (“Le Mépris”) in 1963, playing Brigitte Bardot’s unhappy husband, a screenwriter who sells out his talent and loses his wife to an American producer.\n\nThe film begins with a bedroom scene between Mr. Piccoli and Ms. Bardot, in which his character declares, “I love you totally, tenderly, tragically.” More than three decades later, the critic Phillip Lopate described this star-making performance as having registered “with every nuance the defensive cockiness of an intellectual turned hack who feels himself outmanned.”"
