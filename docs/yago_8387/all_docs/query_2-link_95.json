        "text": "My brother asked me to write a piece about this, to try explain it, not sure this helps. I discovered this bizarre film once again on amazon while browsing ‘Film & Tv’ aimlessly. Finding the cover and price interesting, I went to my great movie reference point dvdbeaver.com -I owe you a donation Mr. Tooze- to look at some stills. I was sufficiently moved by the images I saw to order a copy. A few weeks later I was in for a pleasantly disorientating surprise! Primarily.This is more a brief appreciation than an explanation, as I find this film is totally inexplicable. The way I like it. The basic plot of the film concerns a gas mask designer ‘Glauco’ who returns home from work, cooks dinner, discovers a rusted gun wrapped in newspaper [that may have belonged to bank robber John Dillinger as the newspaper covering attests] and later after certain preparations, shoots his sleeping wife in the head. This film works almost entirely in images, enhancing its unfathomableness, with only a few words of dialogue by Glauco s co-worker at the opening, “Isolation in a chamber that must be sealed off from the outside world because its full of deadly gas… strongly evokes the conditions under which man lives…” Film critic Joshua Rowin postulates that this becomes a defining metaphor -in this otherwise undefinable film- as Glauco himself is masked as a respectable borgeois citizen repressing his anarchic tendencies. His techno-home acts as an extension of this mask, television, radio and home movies substituting for human communication, shutting him off from the pollution of his wife -whom he sedates with pills- and the outside world. Glauco spends much of the film ritualistically dissmantling, cleaning and restoring Dillingers gun, with the mysterious finishing touch of a coat of red paint and white polka dots. Indeed Glauco himself remains a mystery, his ambiguous animalistic behavior and strange reactions throughout the film revealing little of the man inside. The pleithora of enigmatic, bizarre and luminously spectacular images in this film open up many possible black holes of interpretation, even threatening to absorb the main character as he attempts to become part of his projected home movies? As yet, I have not endevoured to make much sense of this film -and probably could nt- but tend to just enjoy the ominous voyage sans subtitles as Glauco moves deeper into what Ferreri calls ‘elsewhere’, finally sailing off into the sunset into the blood red dissolve of the final shot."
