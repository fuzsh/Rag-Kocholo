The epic conclusion of the Jarvis storyline. Angelica and Ashley Jarvis have been looking for their missing father, the infamous Tommy Jarvis, when their search is derailed by Jason’s father, Elias Voorhees, who has sinister plans for the duo. Director's Statement: We set out to create a fan film that would be the collective dream of Friday the 13th fans everywhere. Working with the original cast and crew of Friday the 13th Part 6, Jason Lives, as well as several other horror icons was a dream come true. I feel that we have accomplished what we set out to do and have written a big love letter to the franchise and fans.
