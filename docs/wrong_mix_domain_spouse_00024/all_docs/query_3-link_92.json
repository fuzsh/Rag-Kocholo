        "text": "What role do you think the Flynn plays in the community?\n\nThe Flynn brings big-city artists and shows to a relatively small city. It gives the next generation the opportunity to see age- and content-appropriate live theater through the student matinees. In an age when art funding is being cut, the Flynn offers all kinds of classes to increase exposure and skills to all ages. It is an arts center that grows with the times in content, and addresses the diversity that exists today.\n\nIs there anything you like the community to know about the Flynn, that you didn't before you joined?\n\nI have been increasingly aware of the barriers that in the past have made theater available only for those more wealthy and physically able. The new emphasis that Everybody Belongs at the Flynn makes the theater more accessible to many who could not attend before, either through scholarships, special programming, or just increased awareness of how welcoming the Flynn is to all. The variety of shows also widens the base of the attendees. I also appreciate the push to encourage local talent to grow through classes offered with the chance to perform live on-stage.\n\nWhat role do you think the Flynn plays in the community?\n\nThe Flynn is a gem that continuously enriches our lives. That is why we support the Flynn by frequently attending events, being annual donors, and including the Flynn in our estate planning. Now that we are married, we can’t imagine our life without the Flynn. We’ve attended numerous shows, including watching musicians, comedians, singers, dancers, and performers, as well as attending Lyric Theatre events. We hope everyone gets to experience this wonderful venue and organization!\n\nWhy are Flynn performances especially meaningful for you?\n\nThe Flynn helps us experience life through all our senses and we can’t help smiling every time we walk through the door. Our lives are so much richer because of the Flynn. We are always inviting friends to join us for a fun evening out.\n\nWhat role do you think the Flynn plays in the community?\n\nEvery time I see a school bus in front of the Flynn, I think about how lucky those kids are to have a field trip that day. Even as an adult, my worldview has expanded from sitting in a seat at the Flynn. We are fortunate to have a connection to the arts, and the Flynn’s focus on accessibility makes our community much richer.\n\nWhy are Flynn performances especially meaningful for you?\n\nAll Flynn performances for us spark joy, wonder, and so much fun. We will never forget one performance in particular: Hot Brown Honey. The show had been recommended by Flynn staff but we had no idea what to expect. Steve had been struggling with double vision and nerve damage in one eye. During the performance he turned to me and said, “You know, this is the first time I have felt normal in a very long time.” Within a couple days, his double vision had gone away. Who knows if it was a coincidence, but we’ll always associate a healing moment with that show!"
