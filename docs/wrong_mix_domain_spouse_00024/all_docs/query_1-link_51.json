        "text": "All right friends. This is the full list of Emmy nominations this year. Not just the prime time celebrity filled categories – I mean the extended list. But most importantly… I’ve incuded my thoughts.\n\nDrama Series\n\n“The Boys” (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n“Bridgerton” (Netflix)\n\n“The Crown” (Netflix)\n\n“The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)\n\n“Lovecraft Country” (HBO)\n\n“The Mandalorian” (Disney Plus)\n\n“Pose” (FX)\n\n“This Is Us” (NBC)\n\nPersonally – I’d love to see The Crown take this. I thought Bridgerton was fun, This Is Us has turned things around from past seasons, and of course I need to route for Toronto-made The Handmaid’s Tail – but I LOVVVVVEEEEEEDDDDD The Crown. It’s one of my all time fav shows and I thought this season was particularly amazing.\n\nComedy Series\n\n“Black-ish” (ABC)\n\n“Cobra Kai” (Netflix)\n\n“Emily in Paris” (Netflix)\n\n“Hacks” (HBO Max)\n\n“The Flight Attendant” (HBO Max)\n\n“The Kominsky Method” (Netflix)\n\n“Pen15” (Hulu)\n\n“Ted Lasso” (Apple TV Plus)\n\nConfession – the only Comedy show that was nominated that I saw was Emily in Paris. I have seen many comedy shows this year that were not nominated but should have been nominated over Emily in Paris. I hope Ted Lasso wins this. I don’t know why, I just know a lot of you love this and it feels like the type of show I’d love… maybe it’s time to get Apple TV Plus.\n\nLimited Series\n\n“I May Destroy You” (HBO)\n\n“Mare of Easttown” (HBO)\n\n“The Queen’s Gambit” (Netflix)\n\n“The Underground Railroad” (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n“WandaVision” (Disney Plus)\n\nAnother category that I skipped. WHERE is the “Teen Drama” category haha.\n\nBUT! What this category does tell us and what I LOVE to see is that Stories about Women are award worthy 🙂\n\nLead Actor in a Drama Series\n\nSterling K. Brown (“This Is Us”)\n\nJonathan Majors (“Lovecraft Country”)\n\nJosh O’Connor (“The Crown”)\n\nRegé-Jean Page (“Bridgerton”)\n\nBilly Porter (“Pose”)\n\nMatthew Rhys (“Perry Mason”)\n\nOkay – my hope is that Josh O’Connor wins this. He made The Crown this season. Truly an incredible role.\n\nLead Actress in a Drama Series\n\nUzo Aduba (“In Treatment”)\n\nOlivia Colman (“The Crown”)\n\nEmma Corrin (“The Crown”)\n\nElisabeth Moss (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nMj Rodriguez (“Pose”)\n\nJurnee Smollett (“Lovecraft Country”)\n\nSo I love ALL these women and I have no strong opinion on who should or shouldn’t win.\n\nLead Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nAnthony Anderson (“Black-ish”)\n\nMichael Douglas (“The Kominsky Method”)\n\nWilliam H. Macy (“Shameless”)\n\nJason Sudeikis (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nKenan Thompson (“Kenan”)\n\nSo I think Jason should win. For no other reason than he probably needs a win right now. Must be hard watching your ex hanging out with the hottest person in the world on a romantic italan vacation. You need a win sir.\n\nLead Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nAidy Bryant (“Shrill”)\n\nKaley Cuoco (“The Flight Attendant”)\n\nAllison Janney (“Mom”)\n\nTracee Ellis Ross (“Black-ish”)\n\nJean Smart (“Hacks”)\n\nAgain, I adore all these women. Any of them could win and I’d be thrilled for them.\n\nLead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie\n\nPaul Bettany (“WandaVision”)\n\nHugh Grant (“The Undoing”)\n\nEwan McGregor (“Halston”)\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton”)\n\nLeslie Odom Jr. (“Hamilton”)\n\nI was very impressed with Hamilton but I have complex feelings about Hamilton being considered for TV things. You filmed a stage production… yes win all the Tony’s but I’m not sure how I feel about them winning TV things. Hamilton a very different production from say WandaVision. That being said… give Leslie Odom Jr. his Emmy.\n\nLead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie\n\nMichaela Coel (“I May Destroy You”)\n\nCynthia Erivo (“Genius: Aretha”)\n\nElizabeth Olsen (“WandaVision”)\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy (“The Queen’s Gambit”)\n\nKate Winslet (“Mare of Easttown”)\n\nI think there is going to be a massive Marvel Money campaign for Elizabeth Olsen, but I’d love to see Michaela Coel win for this one.\n\nVariety Talk Series\n\n“Conan”\n\n“The Daily Show With Trevor Noah”\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n\n“Last Week Tonight With John Oliver”\n\n“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”\n\nSo normally Last Week Tonight with John Oliver wins in this category. He’s won the 5 Emmy’s in a row. HOWEVER, this year might be the year someone else takes it. I’d be very interested in seeing what they all submitted for consideration because it was THE year for Vareity Talk Shows. The Pandmic had them all pivoting, and the news stories never stopped. I’d love to see Stephen Colbert take this one. But then… it’s Conan’s last year and I wonder if they’ll give him some flowers.\n\nCompetition Program\n\n“The Amazing Race”\n\n“Nailed It!”\n\n“RuPaul’s Drag Race”\n\n“Top Chef”\n\n“The Voice”\n\nOk. This is a category that I have thoughts on. RuPaul’s Drag Race has won the last three years. Before that, The Voice had a three year streak, and before that The Amazing Race Took home 10 Emmy’s in this category. Top Chef won once in 2010. So really the only show to never have won is Nailed It! but personally, I’ve never gotten into that show nor do I think it’s on the same level. Frankly I think RuPaul’s team will take this award again this year, but I’m bored. I’d like to see some fresh ideas in this category.\n\nTelevision Movie\n\n“Dolly Parton’s Christmas On The Square”\n\n“Oslo”\n\n“Robin Roberts Presents: Mahalia”\n\n“Sylvie’s Love”\n\n“Uncle Frank”\n\nI haven’t seen any of these movies – but I’m always here to give Dolly Parton more awards.\n\nSupporting Actor in a Drama Series\n\nGiancarlo Esposito (“The Mandalorian”)\n\nO-T Fagbenle (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nJohn Lithgow (“Perry Mason”)\n\nTobias Menzies (“The Crown”)\n\nMax Minghella (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nChris Sullivan (“This Is Us”)\n\nBradley Whitford (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nMichael K. Williams (“Lovecraft Country”)\n\nChris Sullivan made me cry this year during This Is Us so I’d vote for him, but the rest of these men are so great. This is a competitive category with lots of worthy actors.\n\nSupporting Actress in a Drama Series\n\nGillian Anderson (“The Crown”)\n\nHelena Bonham Carter (“The Crown”)\n\nMadeline Brewer (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nAnn Dowd (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nAunjanue Ellis (“Lovecraft Country”)\n\nEmerald Fennell (“The Crown”)\n\nYvonne Strahovski (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nSamira Wiley (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nI’d love to see Emerald Fennell win this just so she can win an Emmy and an Oscar in the same year – but if I was going to go for someone in the Crown to take this it would be Gillian Anderson and that’s my top pick for this category overall. She was so great as Margaret Thatcher.\n\nSupporting Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nCarl Clemons-Hopkins (“Hacks”)\n\nBrett Goldstein (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nBrendan Hunt (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nNick Mohammed (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nPaul Reiser (“The Kominsky Method”)\n\nJeremy Swift (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nKenan Thompson (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nBowen Yang (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nGive Bowen Yang all the awards for the Iceburg moment… but he’s very new on the scene. When shows like Ted Lasso and SNL dominate categories – I wonder who gets the campaign or if it splits votes. It will be very interesting to see who wins this.\n\nSupporting Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nAidy Bryant (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nHannah Einbinder (“Hacks”)\n\nKate McKinnon (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nRosie Perez (“The Flight Attendant”)\n\nCecily Strong (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nJuno Temple (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nHannah Waddingham (“Ted Lasso”)\n\nThe SNL girls had a really strong season this year. I wonder if Cecily Strong will get the compaign this year because it’s her last year OR if they’ll push Kate because of her work as Anthony Fucci.\n\nSupporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie\n\nThomas Brodie Sangster (“The Queen’s Gambit”)\n\nDaveed Diggs (“Hamilton”)\n\nPaapa Essiedu (“I May Destroy You”)\n\nJonathan Groff (“Hamilton”)\n\nEvan Peters (“Mare Of Easttown”)\n\nAnthony Ramos (“Hamilton”)\n\nWe’re going to set aside my “Hamilton shouldn’t be up for an Emmy” feelings for a moment and say yes give one of the Hamilton men an award because all three of them are fantastic. I wonder if Anthony Ramos will ride his In the Heights moment and pull out in front but really I think it might be about Jonathan Groff.\n\nSupporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie\n\nRenée Elise Goldsberry (“Hamilton”)\n\nKathryn Hahn (“WandaVision”)\n\nMoses Ingram (“The Queen’s Gambit”)\n\nJulianne Nicholson (“Mare Of Easttown”)\n\nJean Smart (“Mare Of Easttown”)\n\nPhillipa Soo (“Hamilton”)\n\nCue the music… “Angelicaaaaa, Eliza….” but no Peggy. Sucks to be Peggy but REALLY we’re give it to Kathryn Hahn. This was her moment.\n\nGuest Actor in a Drama Series\n\nDon Cheadle (“The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”)\n\nCharles Dance (“The Crown”)\n\nTimothy Olyphant (“The Mandalorian”)\n\nCourtney B. Vance (“Lovecraft Country”)\n\nCarl Weathers (“The Mandalorian”)\n\nGuest Actress in a Drama Series\n\nAlexis Bledel (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nClaire Foy (“The Crown”)\n\nMcKenna Grace (“The Handmaid’s Tale”)\n\nSophie Okonedo (“Ratched”)\n\nPhylicia Rashad (“This Is Us”)\n\nGuest Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nAlec Baldwin (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nDave Chappelle (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nMorgan Freeman (“The Kominsky Method”)\n\nDaniel Kaluuya (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nDaniel Levy (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nIt has to be Alec. The 2020 election this year was *his* moment.\n\nGuest Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nJane Adams (“Hacks”)\n\nYvette Nicole Brown (“A Black Lady Sketch Show”)\n\nBernadette Peters (“Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist”)\n\nIssa Rae (“A Black Lady Sketch Show”)\n\nMaya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nKristen Wiig (“Saturday Night Live”)\n\nVariety Sketch Series\n\n“A Black Lady Sketch Show”\n\n“Saturday Night Live”\n\nI’m surprised that there are only two shows here. After all the CanCon buzz last year, I would have loved to seen Baroness Von Sketch Show here.\n\nVariety Special (Live)\n\nCelebrating America – An Inauguration Night Special (Multiple Platforms)\n\nThe 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (CBS)\n\nThe Oscars (ABC)\n\nThe Pepsi Super Bowl LV Halftime Show Starring The Weeknd (CBS)\n\nStephen Colbert’s Election Night 2020: Democracy’s Last Stand Building Back America Great Again Better 2020 (Showtime)\n\nThe Oscars were extremly well done this year as was The Grammy Awards… it’s going to be a tough call.\n\nVariety Special (Pre-Recorded)\n\nBo Burnham: Inside (Netflix)\n\nDavid Byrne’s American Utopia (HBO)\n\n8:46 – Dave Chappelle (Netflix)\n\nFriends: The Reunion (HBO Max)\n\nHamilton (Disney Plus)\n\nA West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote (HBO Max)\n\nHOW DO YOU PICK?! This is a stacked category. I would love to see Bo Burnham take this one.\n\nHosted Nonfiction Series or Special\n\nMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman (Netflix)\n\nOprah with Megan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special (CBS)\n\nStanley Tucci: Searching For Italy (CNN)\n\nUnited Shades Of America with W. Kamau Bell (CNN)\n\nVICE (Showtime)\n\nThis one HAS to go to Oprah with Megan and Harry. It was a game changer.\n\nHost For a Reality or Competition Program\n\nBobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Tan France, Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness (“Queer Eye”)\n\nNicole Byer (“Nailed It!”)\n\nBarbara Corcoran, Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, Robert Herjavec, Daymond John, Kevin O’Leary (“Shark Tank”)\n\nTom Colicchio, Padma Lakshmi, Gail Simmons (“Top Chef”)\n\nRuPaul (“RuPaul’s Drag Race”)\n\nGive it to anyone except Kevin O’Leary.\n\nAnimated Program\n\n“Big Mouth” (Netflix)\n\n“Bob’s Burgers” (Fox)\n\n“Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal” (Adult Swim)\n\n“The Simpsons” (Fox)\n\n“South Park: The Pandemic Special” (Comedy Central)\n\nShort Form Animated Program\n\n“Love, Death + Robots” (Netflix)\n\n“Maggie Simpson In: The Force Awakens From Its Nap” (Disney)\n\n“Once Upon a Snowman” (Disney Plus)\n\n“Robot Chicken” (Adult Swim)\n\nOutstanding Production Design For A Narrative Contemporary Program (One Hour Or More)\n\nThe Flight Attendant • After Dark • HBO Max • HBO Max in association with Berlanti Productions, Yes, Norman Productions,\n\nand Warner Bros.
