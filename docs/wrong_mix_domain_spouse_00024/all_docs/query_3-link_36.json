You were not mandated nor asked to stay but volunteered to help inventory and pack the offenders; property and only left once everything else had been done. Your teamwork ability made it possible for the 3rd shift officers to complete their regular duties without having the property keeping their attention away from the offender populations. On Sunday, August 30, 2020, you once again stayed over.

As one of the staff who have volunteered to assist, I have observed Mr. Conger go above and beyond to make them feel welcome and appreciated for every little contribution they can make. Staff assisting are encouraged, and made to feel comfortable, asking any and all questions they have to help get acclimated to duties they volunteer to assist with.” Mr. Teller further stated “Mr. Conger is an absolute shining example of professional supervision and communication. Mr. Conger himself puts a great deal of effort and pride into the work he does and proves himself to be a very hard worker, extremely knowledgeable in his area, and is simply a joy to work with. “In a stressful environment, Mr. Conger helps build a positive atmosphere, promotes a team environment and interacts well with others.

Mr. Gillilan is assigned to housing unit 7 on 2nd shift, but he was sought out by his supervisors to assist in Food Service. He made an immediate, positive impact in the day to day operations. Mr. Gillilan did not merely fill a role, but took it upon himself to help coordinate workers and rosters for all three shifts. The leadership and decision making ability he exhibited had a ripple effect for both subordinate and supervisory staff. Food Service staff were able to concentrate on their everyday duties making for a fluid work environment. Supervisory staff were free to focus on other areas of concern knowing Food Service was taken care of. Mr. Gillilan maintained his regular housing unit duties in addition to the extra responsibilities in Food Service throughout a month time frame. The impact on daily operations for WMCC was positively affected due to his willingness to assist and his ability to succeed.\n\nCynthia Breshears, Storekeeper II\n\nMs. Breshears was nominated for this award by Rise Holcomb and Polly Henley.
