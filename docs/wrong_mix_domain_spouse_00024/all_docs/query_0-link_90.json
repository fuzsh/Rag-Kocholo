        "text": "PARNERSHIP AWARD\n\nUnited States Attorney Roger B. Handberg\n\nFor the past 15 years, the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office has partnered with Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Secret Service and the FBI by providing Task Force Agents to work on child exploitation cases. Agents from the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office have served as lead case agents, undercover officers, and forensic examiners on more than 100 child exploitation cases that have been successfully prosecuted in federal court by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nUnited States Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida and the U.S. Attorney’s Office have consistently demonstrated their commitment to keeping our communities and children safe.\n\nIn a Federal Press Release from November of 2022, U.S. Attorney Handberg stated, “Protecting our children from those who would seek to do them harm is a top priority of the United States Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners. We have had an excellent partner in the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office. Their investigators are skilled and dedicated professionals who are committed to protect children from sexual exploitation. The prosecutions have served to protect children in Brevard County and across the United States. We look forward to many more successes working together with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office on these important cases.”\n\nIt is an honor to present U.S. Attorney Handberg and the United States Attorney’s Office with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office Partnership Award.\n\nSPECIAL RECOGNITION AWARD\n\nLUCY ROSS AWARD\n\nVOLUNTEER OF THE YEAR\n\nCITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\nMERITORIOUS SERVICE AWARDS\n\nThis award signifies that the recipient displayed unusual thoroughness, determination, and/or initiative while carrying out his/her duties. This award is for service rendered in the line of duty where the employee, because of his/her diligence and perseverance, performs a difficult task in which a serious crime is prevented, significant property is protected, human life is protected, or causes the successful closure of a significant criminal case in which the criminal is apprehended.\n\nDeputy Don Eri\n\nDeputy Don Eri received information from a foster parent in reference to a juvenile who was possibly setting fires. The foster parent had become concerned after learning the juvenile had started a fire at the home of his grandparents and had been caught by the foster parent setting a fire in a garbage can at the residence.\n\nUpon learning this information, Deputy Eri found that the juvenile had been questioned in reference to a recent fire at a skate park in Merritt Island. Deputy Eri also located two additional suspicious fires reported in the area. Deputy Eri contacted the arson investigator from the Florida Bureau of Fire, Arson and Explosives, who advised they were having trouble locating the juvenile who had been suspended from school and left the foster home. Deputy Eri was able to locate the juvenile, who during the interview with the Fire Investigator, confessed to setting the fires at the skate park and a local park restroom.\n\nDue to the initiative and thoroughness of Deputy Eri, the arsonist was identified, located and arrested. The arrest of this juvenile likely prevented other potential property and life-threatening arsons. For his actions, Deputy Eri is receiving a Bar of Merit.\n\nAgent Mike Spadafora\n\nAgent Mike Spadafora began investigating a CyberTip received from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, reporting that a user of Yahoo e-mail had uploaded over 600 images and videos of suspected child abuse material to their servers.\n\nDuring his review of the material, Agent Spadafora observed numerous images of child pornography that contained unidentified victims. Agent Spadafora suspected these images were being produced by a suspect living in Merritt Island. Further investigation revealed the suspect had access to a 3-year-old and 5-year-old, who were believed to be the children in the images. Due to the immediate need to protect these children from further abuse, a search warrant was obtained and served at the suspect’s residence. During the search of the residence, a computer was located in the suspect’s bedroom that showed he was actively viewing and sharing child pornography. Based on the material and other evidence collected from the search, the suspect was arrested.\n\nThrough his efforts and dedication, Agent Spadafora saved two young children from further abuse by their family member and was able to provide them with counseling and other needed services. Agent Spadafora is being recognized for his investigation with a Bar of Merit.\n\nSergeant Kristina Isbell, Field Training Officer Brian Claudius, Corrections Deputy Brian Stevens and Corrections Deputy Zachary Sornberger\n\nWhen a brush fire erupted east of the Jail Complex and quickly spread to the north with many homes in its path, the Communication Center called for any available unit to respond and assist with evacuating homes in the path of the fire. Sergeant Kristina Isbell, Field Training Officer Brian Claudius, Corrections Deputy Brian Stevens and Corrections Deputy Zachary Sornberger responded to the area.\n\nWhile on scene, Sergeant Isbell, Corrections Deputy Stevens and Corrections Deputy Sornberger assisted other patrol deputies and Brevard County Fire Rescue with evacuating homes, helping citizens with special needs and directing traffic away from the affected area. Field Training Officer Claudius (a volunteer fireman) assisted BCFR Station #28 with extinguishing structure fires and saving several other structures from fire damage.\n\nDue to the quick actions of Sergeant Isbell, Field Training Officer Claudius, Corrections Deputy Stevens, and Corrections Deputy Sornberger, they were able to help prevent any further loss of property and assist our citizens to safety.\n\nSergeant Sean Wilkin, Corporal Josh Williams, Agent Aaron Becker, Deputy Justin Edgar, Deputy Bobby Smith, Deputy Alexandria Zeglen and Deputy Mitchell Hannon\n\nAgent Aaron Becker and Deputy Justin Edgar responded to a call for service regarding a wildfire behind Woody’s BBQ in unincorporated Cocoa. Upon Agent Becker and Deputy Edgar arriving on scene, they guided Brevard County Fire Rescue (BCFR) in with a brush truck, which was the only fire equipment capable of traversing the terrain. The responding BCFR brush truck only had two fire fighters, so they asked for the deputies’ assistance. Agent Becker and Deputy Edgar assisted BCFR by operating fire hoses on the truck in an attempt to extinguish the flames.\n\nOn the northeast perimeter of the fire, in the neighborhood adjacent to Broadway Boulevard, deputies and Fire Rescue were evacuating homes. Sergeant Sean Wilkin, Corporal Josh Williams, Deputy Bobby Smith, Deputy Alexandria Zeglen and Deputy Mitchell Hannon began evacuating residents along Akorn Street. As the fire progressed, it grew from three acres to approximately fifteen acres in size. While the fire was increasing in severity, several items such as old cars, lawn equipment, propane tanks, and debris, were also set ablaze and began randomly and violently exploding. Sergeant Wilkin, Corporal Williams, Deputy Smith, Deputy Zeglen and Deputy Hannon continued to work feverishly to evacuate residents and pets that had been left behind.\n\nUpon approaching 371 and 367 Akorn Street, in the direct path of the center of the fire, Sergeant Wilkin was made aware of three dogs and a parrot left inside two of the residences. Both residences were ablaze with 50-foot flames erupting from the structures and trees in the backyards. Sergeant Wilkin breached the front doors and entered the houses to save the animals (with the assistance of Corporal Williams and Deputy Hannon). As a result of these courageous efforts, the three dogs and a parrot trapped inside the homes were quickly rescued unharmed and returned to their owners. If not for the quick, diligent action of the involved deputies, the animals would surely have perished in the fire.\n\nWithout the determination of the involved deputies, the outcome may have been drastically different resulting in the loss of human life as well as the beloved pets which were rescued.\n\nAgent Dan Magill\n\nEast Precinct deputies responded to a residence in Merritt Island in reference to a mailbox that had been blown up. Deputies quickly located evidence which they perceived to be the remnants of an improvised explosive device. Agent Dan Magill was contacted and responded as the on-call agent for the East Precinct General Crimes Unit. Agent Magill was briefed on the incident, then expanded the crime scene perimeter and contacted the on call BCSO Bomb Squad technician.\n\nImmediately, Agent Magill began interviews and learned the victim just moved into the residence 48 hours prior and the landscaper for the property was owed money by the prior tenant. Witness interviews confirmed the suspect arrived at the neighbor’s residence earlier in the day asking about money he was owed. The suspect drove away, stopping next to the mailbox that exploded within a minute of him leaving. Agent Magill obtained residential video surveillance which showed a black sport utility vehicle, driven by a white male with a beard, exit the truck at the neighbor’s residence. Agent Magill was able to identify the owner of the SUV who was on felony probation. Crime Scene Investigators and Explosive Ordinance Disposal members determined the device used to destroy the mailbox was a manufactured destructive device, which was not constructed hastily. The maker would have needed ample time to construct the device in a clandestine manner, to avoid detection by witnesses, or law enforcement. Throughout the night and into the early morning hours, Agent Magill developed probable cause and drafted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his residence. Later that morning during the execution of the search warrant, the suspect was located and arrested. During the search of the residence, two suspected explosive/incendiary devices were located.\n\nThroughout this long and extensive investigation, Agent Magill showed great thoroughness, determination and outstanding investigative skills. His efforts led to the arrest of the suspect and the recovery of evidence to substantiate the initial crime as well as the recovery of additional improvised explosive devices.\n\nAgent Gary Haas\n\nAgent Gary Haas and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement initiated a joint investigation into a potential human trafficking ring affecting multiple jurisdictions. As a result of the very complex investigation, agents found evidence the suspects had recruited three juvenile females to perform sex acts with them for money. Further investigation also revealed the suspects, on multiple occasions, had video recorded the sex acts being performed with the victims.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, both suspects were arrested for multiple counts of human trafficking, use of a minor in a sexual performance and unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. The expertise of Agent Haas in investigating this case removed two dangerous sexual predators from the community and allowed the healing process to begin for the juvenile victims.\n\nCorporal Michael Coppola\n\nWhile driving home at the conclusion of his shift, Corporal Michael Coppola noticed a vehicle stuck on the railroad tracks approximately fifty yards south of the intersection at Viera Boulevard and U.S.1. He immediately stopped his patrol car and went to render aid. Upon approaching the vehicle, he discovered a very disoriented ninety-three-year old man sitting in the driver’s seat. Corporal Coppola’s investigation revealed the elderly man had taken a wrong turn and was stuck on the railroad tracks. Corporal Coppola was able to remove the man from the vehicle and carry him to safety while making notification to the Florida East Coast Railway to stop any trains in transit until the vehicle could be moved. At the time of this incident, there was a northbound train that would have collided with the vehicle without Corporal Coppola’s intervention.\n\nThe actions taken by Corporal Coppola averted a potentially dangerous situation that would most likely have resulted in the serious injury or death of the elderly male.\n\nAgent Mitch Matthias\n\nThe Brevard County Sheriff’s Office Homicide Unit was notified of a homicide that occurred on Hunt Drive, in Merritt Island. Upon arrival, deputies discovered an adult male victim, deceased in his garage from an apparent gunshot wound. Agent Mitch Matthias was assigned as the lead investigator.\n\nFrom the onset of the investigation, Agent Matthias had minimal evidence or leads to follow. With no known witnesses, Agent Matthias demonstrated creative thinking to canvass additional neighborhoods for any information. This led Agent Matthias to multiple security cameras that ultimately revealed the suspect’s vehicle arriving and departing from the victim’s residence. Although Agent Matthias was new to the Homicide Unit and had yet to lead a homicide investigation, his training and experience helped him to maintain a positive outlook which kept the investigation moving forward. His tenacity for finding more leads eventually led to a nearby convenience store, where the suspect was captured on surveillance video and used his personal customer rewards number to conduct a transaction.\n\nAgent Matthias used these leads to positively identify the suspect and determine he not only shot and killed the homeowner, he also took items from the victim’s home after he shot and killed him. Agent Matthias utilized multiple agency resources to locate the suspect and continue to gather evidence. Due to his tireless efforts, he successfully arrested the homicide suspect and recovered the victim’s stolen property, as well as the property of the victim’s roommate.\n\nAgent Kyle Pemberton\n\nAgent Kyle Pemberton initiated an investigation into a major drug trafficking organization. This investigation would span six months and culminated with a search warrant at the main suspect’s residence and the arrest and federal prosecution of this distributor of dangerous narcotics.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Agent Pemberton was able to cultivate two informants that could purchase heroin/fentanyl and methamphetamine from the suspect of this investigation. Throughout March and into August 2022, Agent Pemberton worked diligently with the informants as they were able to make the multiple controlled purchases of methamphetamine and heroin/fentanyl from a residence in Titusville.\n\nBased on the above information and because of the great investigative efforts of Agent Pemberton, Special Agent Brian Lammers with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) adopted the case federally. The case was brought before a Federal Grand Jury on September 14, 2022, where an indictment was issued for multiple federal charges for the distribution of dangerous narcotics.\n\nImmediately following the indictment, the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team executed the federal search warrant at the suspect’s residence. During the search of the residence, fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine were located. Multiple handguns were also recovered with one being reported stolen from Titusville.\n\nBecause of his hard work and countless hours on this investigation, Agent Pemberton removed a dangerous convicted felon off the streets of Brevard County who was poisoning the citizens and contributing to the drug pandemic we face in our country every day.\n\nLieutenant Brandon Gish, Corporal Jose Santos, K-9 Deputy Andrew Johnson, K-9 Deputy Josh Hardy and Deputy Kirby Gobeli\n\nOn the evening of June 25, 2022, South Precinct deputies received radio notification that Indian River County Sheriff’s Office personnel were pursuing a vehicle being driven by an individual who had taken two hostages and had discharged a firearm several times at their deputies. Several Brevard County deputies responded to the area to assist in apprehending the suspect and rescuing the hostages that he had taken.\n\nThe suspect’s vehicle ultimately came to a stop in the area of Foley Ln in Grant -Valkaria. Lieutenant Brandon Gish, Corporal Jose Santos, K-9 Deputy Andrew Johnson, K-9 Deputy Josh Hardy and Deputy Kirby Gobeli arrived on scene becoming involved in the standoff that ensued.\n\nAfter a brief time of failed negotiations, the suspect emerged from the vehicle with one of the hostages being held closely to his body with a firearm pushed against the female hostage’s head. The suspect was able to retreat with the hostage into the wood line under the cover of darkness.\n\nThese deputies, along with personnel from the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office and Sebastian Police Department, formed a hostage rescue team and pursued the suspect on foot into the woods.\n\nAs the pursuit continued, the rescue team came into contact with the suspect and his hostage in a clearing. Once the suspect was illuminated by the light of STAR, gunshots were exchanged with the suspect, and other members of the rescue team, resulting in the suspect being killed and the hostage being rescued. Deputy Gobeli immediately began to render medical aid to the rescued hostage who was relatively unharmed and escorted her away from the scene to safety.\n\nThroughout the entirety of the incident, in spite of being fired upon and having no visibility in the darkness, these deputy sheriffs displayed a calm and collected demeanor which directly contributed to the success of the rescue mission described. Because of their resolve, bravery, and fearlessness, there was no further injury or loss of life to the hostages.\n\nAgent Harry Bermudez\n\nBetween January 2021 and April 2022, the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office Economic Crimes Task Force received thirteen (13) case reports involving jet skis/jet boats as an investment scam that defrauded Brevard County victims out of $209,000.00. Agent Harry Bermudez was assigned and investigated all the Brevard County cases. During the investigation, Agent Bermudez identified the suspect and determined he had three different ways to scam victims out of money.\n\nAgent Bermudez’s investigation led him to more victims and other affected jurisdictions. He was able to deconflict with GCU agents and deputies from Volusia County to build a better overall case of scheming to defraud. Agent Bermudez determined all the stolen money was used to support the suspect’s gambling addiction. Agent Bermudez was able to follow all the money from the victims, to the suspect and ultimately to the Casinos and/or Kennel Clubs. Agent Bermudez’ investigation was on-going for approximately one year, but ultimately cleared all of the opened Brevard County Sheriff’s Office cases with an arrest.\n\nAs a result of his investigative efforts, Agent Bermudez was able to provide other jurisdictions with information needed to clear their open cases. This was a difficult and time-consuming investigation that ended in the arrest of a suspect for an organized fraud that occurred in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nDeputy Thomas Farragher\n\nDuring the past year, Deputy Farragher has conducted numerous traffic stops in an effort to educate the citizens of Brevard County on traffic laws while searching for impaired drivers and illegal drugs. As a result of his efforts, Deputy Farragher made over one hundred Driving Under the Influence arrests as well as several other arrests for the possession of illegal drugs.\n\nDeputy Farragher’s passion for DUI enforcement is also evident in his willingness to educate and develop new deputies assigned his shift. In addition to mentoring others, he has taken it upon himself to attend advanced DUI trainings to help with his own education and experience. His growing knowledge, passion and experience for DUI investigations directly reflects in his work product, as nearly all of his arrests have been successfully filed by the State Attorney’s Office without issues. The State Attorney’s Office is also recommended for Deputy Farragher to submit his application to the Drug Recognition Expert School, which requires State Attorney’s Office approval.\n\nDeputy Farragher is a highly proactive and self-motivated member of the Cape Canaveral Precinct. Because of his actions, over 100 impaired and potentially dangerous drivers were apprehended and removed from the streets of Brevard County. Additionally, he is the first BCSO deputy since 2017 to make over 100 Driving Under the Influence arrests within a single year.\n\nLifesaving Awards\n\nThis award is to recognize those employees, who under true emergency circumstances, act to prevent probable loss of life either by exercising appropriate first aid procedures or by direct intervention. It is awarded to an employee for competent and expedient action that is directly accountable for sustaining or saving a human life. Subsequent death of a victim after release to medical personnel will not preclude nomination.\n\nDeputy Josh Chamberlain\n\nDeputy Josh Chamberlain was dispatched to a wooded area in Grant in reference to an off-road vehicle crash. Upon arrival, he was advised the crash site was located deep in the woods and a male had sustained serious injuries to his arm. Knowing that an emergency vehicle could not reach the scene due to the terrain, Deputy Chamberlain entered the woods on foot in an effort to find the victim. After several minutes, he was able to locate the crash site after observing the headlights of the overturned vehicle.\n\nUpon assessing the victim’s injuries, Deputy Chamberlain observed his left arm was maimed to the point of near amputation. Deputy Chamberlain immediately applied a tourniquet to the victim’s injured arm to stop the bleeding. Recognizing the victim was in shock and in need of immediate medical care, Deputy Chamberlain placed the victim in the back of a modified off-road jeep that was at the scene and transported him out of the woods to the roadway where emergency medical personnel were waiting. The victim was transported to an area hospital where he was stabilized, giving the medical team the opportunity to save his arm.\n\nThe quick response and immediate life saving measures taken by Deputy Chamberlain directly resulted in the saving of this man’s life.\n\nDeputy Robert Bennett and Deputy Kyle Reinhardt\n\nDeputy Robert Bennett and Deputy Kyle Reinhardt responded to a residence in Merritt Island in reference to a house fire where four occupants and a dog were reported to be trapped inside. Deputy Bennett arrived first to find that two of the occupants had made it safely out of the residence. In an effort to reach the remaining occupants, Deputy Bennett attempted to enter the front door of the residence but was unable due to the billowing smoke. Upon Deputy Reinhardt’s arrival, both deputies again moved toward the front door where they could hear the occupants yelling for help. As they reached the door, they observed one of the occupants had dragged an elderly female into the front part of the residence, however was unable to continue further.\n\nBoth deputies entered the residence and were successful in locating the female who they were able to move to the safety of the front yard. Brevard County Fire Rescue arrived on scene and began extinguishing the fire at which time they observed the family’s dog crawling on the ground toward the rear of the residence where he too was pulled to safety.\n\nDeputies Bennett and Reinhardt’s courageous actions placed their own personal safety in great danger in order to save the life of this elderly female.\n\nSheriff Wayne Ivey and Corporal Hannah Polito\n\nSheriff Ivey received a telephone call from a citizen advising that they had not seen or heard from their elderly family member and were concerned for their welfare. Being near the area, Sheriff Ivey and Corporal Hannah Polito responded to the residence to conduct a well-being check. Upon arrival at the residence, they were able to hear a faint voice calling for help.\n\nIn order to gain access to the residence, Sheriff Ivey assisted Corporal Polito through a rear kitchen window. Once inside, the resident was discovered laying on the kitchen floor in medical distress. Sheriff Ivey and Corporal Polito provided immediate first aid to the victim until medical personnel arrived at the scene. Further investigation found that the resident had fallen several days earlier and had dragged himself into the kitchen. The victim was transported to an area hospital where he was treated for head injuries, fluid on his lungs and dehydration. Hospital personnel confirmed that without the immediate intervention of Sheriff Ivey and Corporal Polito, the male would not have survived.\n\nCorporal Michael Oldham, Corporal Anthony Moore and Field Training Officer Corey Grubbe\n\nWhile working at the Brevard County Jail Complex, Corporal Michael Oldham and Field Training Officer Corey Grubbe were alerted to a possible medical issue with an inmate in one of the cells. As they arrived at the cell, they observed an inmate laying on the ground unresponsive. Corporal Oldham requested medical assistance while FTO Grubbe placed the inmate in the recovery position and attempted to clear the airway. Corporal Anthony Moore responded and assisted with CPR on the inmate. In addition to CPR, an AED was also utilized to deliver four shocks to the unresponsive inmate. Brevard County Fire Rescue responded and transported the inmate to an area hospital where additional medical care could be provided. Due to the quick response, poise and teamwork of these corrections deputies, the inmate was able to survive this emergency medical event.\n\nCorporal Travis Cooper and Corrections Deputy Shavonne Cook\n\nCounty Jail Complex, Corrections Corporal Travis Cooper and Corrections Deputy Shavonne Cook were alerted to an issue in one of the housing units by inmates asking for assistance. Corporal Cooper and Corrections Deputy Cook immediately responded and found an inmate hanging from the top tier with a sheet tied around her neck. Corporal Cooper and Corrections Deputy Cook immediately grabbed the inmate’s legs and lifted her up, relieving the pressure from her neck.\n\nWhile Corporal Cooper continued to hold the inmate’s legs, he instructed Corrections Deputy Cook to go upstairs and remove the sheet from around her neck. Corrections Deputy Cook quickly ran up the stairs and successfully removed the sheet allowing Corporal Cooper to gently lower the inmate to the ground where he immediately began to assess her for injuries.\n\nCorporal Cooper initiated CPR until the inmate became responsive. The Jail Complex medical team took over care until the arrival of Brevard County Fire Rescue. The inmate was transported to an area hospital where she was medically cleared and returned to the Jail Complex with no significant injuries. The quick response and immediate life saving measures taken by Corporal Cooper and Correction Deputy Cook directly resulted in saving the inmate’s life.\n\nAutomotive Technician Austin Severson\n\nWhile traveling northbound on I-95 in the area of mile marker 206 in Cocoa, Automotive Technician Austin Severson observed what he believed to be a crash with a possible ejection. The driver was observed laying on the ground next to the vehicle on the side of the roadway. Technician Severson immediately stopped to render medical aid at which time the male driver leapt up and grabbed a large shard of broken glass. The driver then attempted to cut his own throat with the glass and began waiving it at Technician Severson in a threatening manner.\n\nAt this time, a citizen travelling in the opposite direction, stopped and crossed the Interstate median to aid Technician Severson. As the male driver continued to waive the glass at Technician Severson and the citizen, he continued to make suicidal comments and threats. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation and the potential for harm not only to themselves, but to the male driver as well due to being on the side of a busy highway, Technician Severson and the citizen tackled the male. During the ensuing struggle, they were successful in getting the glass away from the subject and held him down until deputies arrived on scene.\n\nIt was ultimately determined the male driver had intentionally wrecked his vehicle with the intent of committing suicide, which was ultimately prevented by Technician Severson. Technician Severson and this citizen placed themselves in harm’s way without regard to their own safety to save the life of a suicidal subject. As a direct result of their actions, the male driver only received minor lacerations from his attempt to take his own life. Technician Severson’s actions went above and beyond anything expected or required of a Brevard County Sheriff’s Office employee and are deserving of recognition.\n\nDeputy Cliffton Dasher, Deputy Mitchell Hannon, Corporal Megan Andrews and Lieutenant Jason Hart\n\nThese deputies were involved in events a day apart with the same victim. During the initial encounter, Deputy Cliffton Dasher and Deputy Mitchell Hannon responded to a residence in Titusville after a relative advised they had not heard from a family member for several days. The caller stated this was very unusual and that the resident had no family in Florida to check on him.\n\nUpon their arrival to the residence, Deputy Dasher and Deputy Hannon noted a vehicle was parked in the driveway. After continuous knocking on the front door and windows, no one answered. Deputy Dasher and Deputy Hannon spoke with neighbors who stated if the vehicle was present the resident should be home.\n\nBased on this information, they looked for alternative ways to gain entry to the residence without causing damage, if possible. Deputy Hannon was able to manipulate a window to open near the front door. Deputy Hannon then climbed through the window and unlocked the front door. Once inside the residence, Deputy Dasher and Deputy Hannon located an unresponsive male in his bedroom, laying on the floor near his bed. Deputy Dasher and Deputy Hannon requested Brevard County Fire and Rescue (BCFR), who arrived on scene and determined the male was suffering from several severe medical problems. The male was transported to the hospital where he received medical treatment and was released.\n\nThe following day, Lieutenant Jason Hart and Field Training Officer Megan Andrews responded to the same residence in an attempt to contact the male. Upon arrival, the deputies were unable to get a response from the resident. Due to the previous call, forced entry was made into the residence where the male was found unresponsive on his bed with labored breathing. Lt. Hart and FTO Andrews attempted to wake the male and continued to do so until BCFR arrived and transported the male to the hospital.\n\nDeputies Dasher, Hannon, FTO Andrews and Lt. Hart were relentless in their attempts to assist a caller in locating his brother. After realizing their call for service was potentially life-threatening, all personnel acted quickly to enter the residence and render aid, saving the life of the male on two different occasions.\n\nSergeant Jason McMillin\n\nSergeant Jason McMillin was dispatched to a residence in the city of Cape Canaveral in reference to a male who was not breathing normally and had a history of traumatic brain injury and seizures.\n\nUpon arriving on-scene and assessing the situation, Sgt. McMillin quickly realized the male was having some sort of cardiac episode and had stopped breathing. Sergeant McMillin determined the male had no pulse and immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Cape Canaveral Fire Rescue arrived on-scene and requested Sergeant McMillin continue his life saving efforts. As CCFR began to evaluate him, they realized the male regained a pulse and transported him to an area hospital.\n\nContact was made with the male’s mother who was extremely grateful for Sergeant McMillin’s quick response. She commented that if he had not started CPR when he did, there was a high likelihood her son would not have survived.\n\nField Training Officer Josh Mancini\n\nFTO Josh Mancini was among multiple deputies who were dispatched to a call of a collapsed trench at a construction site located in the area of Camp Road and US1 in Cocoa.\n\nThe caller was unable to provide an exact location of the trench as FTO Mancini and others responded to the area. After scouring the area, deputies located a large hole, approximately 15 feet deep and several feet wide. At the bottom of this hole, they were able to observe a male up to his neck in muddy water. Due to the consistency of the soft ground and the water in the hole, the male was slowly sinking.\n\nFearing the victim would drown without assistance, FTO Mancini directed workers on scene to lower a harness off of a boom crane to the male. Once the harness was under the male’s arms, the crane put enough pressure on the male to keep him from sinking further.\n\nAs Brevard County Fire Rescue (BCFR) started to arrive on scene, FTO Mancini observed that water was slowly filling the hole and again, was putting the victim’s life at risk. FTO Mancini requested dive equipment be brought on-scene to provide air to the victim. A Scott Air Pack was delivered to the scene until members of the Dive Team could respond with the requested dive equipment, which was used by BCFR to provide the victim with air until he could be raised higher out of the hole.\n\nAfter approximately two (2) hours, the victim was removed from the hole and moved to a nearby landing zone where Life Flight transported him to an area hospital where he made a full recovery.\n\nThis incident is an outstanding example of the team work employed each and every day from the various units of our agency to preserve the life of a citizen in a life-threatening situation.\n\nFTO Mancini’s response to this accident and his actions prevented the probable loss of life due to his direct intervention.\n\nDeputy Sean Maze\n\nDeputy Sean Maze responded to the area of Via Salerno Court, Merritt Island, in reference to a report that two female juveniles had been struck by lightning. Dispatch further reported one female patient was awake and breathing, while the other patient was unresponsive and turning blue.\n\nUpon arrival, Deputy Maze observed two female juvenile victims laying on the ground next to a palm tree. As Deputy Maze approached the girls, he observed one was responsive and gasping, “help me.” The other juvenile’s face was blue/purple in color and had blood around her mouth. Deputy Maze immediately assessed the unresponsive juvenile and found she had no pulse and was not breathing.\n\nDeputy Maze retrieved an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) from his patrol vehicle and returned to the victim to render aid. Deputy Maze then initiated Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) until he observed the lips of the victim begin to move. Upon the arrival of Brevard County Fire Rescue, the victims were transported to an area hospital for medical treatment. Both victims are expected to recover from their injuries.\n\nThe swift response and life saving measures employed by Deputy Maze were essential in preserving the life of the juvenile female initially found to be unresponsive at the scene.\n\nDeputy Kaitlyn Applegate\n\nDeputy Kaitlyn Applegate responded to a call for service where a male was on the top of the Hubert Humphry Bridge straddling the guardrail preparing to jump off. Deputy Applegate was the first to arrive on scene and began talking with the male who was visibly distraught and stating he wanted to commit suicide. After several minutes speaking with the male, she convinced him to take her hand, assisting him to the side of the road preventing him from jumping off the bridge. She was able to calm him and convince him to get into the back of her car where she transported him off the bridge.\n\nDeputy Applegate investigated further and determined he was suffering from severe depression that has gone untreated. He stated he did not want to live because of life circumstances and her actions saved his life. Deputy Applegate transported him to a medical facility where he was able to receive the necessary treatment.\n\nDeputy Applegate’s ability to establish a rapport with the male and calmly speak with him prevented a potential life-ending tragedy. Her direct intervention and expedient action stopped this suicidal individual from following through with his intentions.\n\nDeputy Niclas Woltman and Reserve Deputy Dylan Lemoine\n\nDeputy Niclas Woltman and Reserve Deputy Dylan Lemoine responded to a residence in Cocoa in reference to an injured/ill person. Deputy Woltman, who was the first to arrive on scene, began performing life-saving measures and initiated CPR due to the person being unresponsive. Upon arriving on scene, Reserve Deputy Lemoine deployed his AED while Deputy Woltman continued CPR. Upon attaching the AED to the patient, a shock was administered. The Cocoa Fire Department and Brevard County Fire Rescue arrived soon after and took over life saving measures. The patient was ultimately transported to an area hospital for further treatment.\n\nBrevard County Fire Rescue advised the actions of Deputy Woltman and Reserve Deputy Lemoine were directly responsible for saving the life of the victim.\n\nDeputy Shannon Hooper and Deputy Marc DeLaughter\n\nDeputy Shannon Hooper responded to Culver’s in Viera in reference to a medical incident. The Communications Center advised that an 86-year-old male lost consciousness and was possibly having a heart attack. Once on-scene, Deputy Hooper assessed the male patient and began CPR while requesting another deputy to respond with an AED.\n\nDeputy Hooper continued to perform chest compressions on the male until Deputy Marc DeLaughter arrived on scene with an AED which was quickly applied and two shocks were administered. Brevard Fire Rescue responded and transported the male to an area hospital.\n\nHad it not been for the quick actions of Deputies Hooper and DeLaughter, it is unlikely the male would have survived.\n\nDeputy Joe Batch, Deputy Christina Cea, Field Training Officer Matt Bialobrzeski and Public Safety Telecommunicator Andrew LeBeau\n\nEast Precinct deputies responded to an apartment complex in Merritt Island in reference to a frantic call to 911 about a male that was actively hanging himself while the caller was on the phone. While the dispatcher was attempting to gather information about the incident, the caller abruptly ended the call. Public Safety Telecommunicator Andrew LeBeau completed a cross reference on the phone number and was able to determine the caller’s exact location. Based on previous calls, PST LeBeau was able to direct deputies to the location where the incident was occurring in the large apartment complex.\n\nDeputy Joe Batch responded to the location and quickly located the residence in the complex. Deputy Batch observed the back door to the residence ajar and announced his presence. He heard the caller yelling in distress from within and quickly entered. He observed a female in the residence yelling and moving frantically, telling him the father to her child was hanging in the living room. As he approached the male, he observed him hanging from a bed sheet that was attached to the second floor bannister. The male appeared to be deceased based on the lack of body movement, color of his body and the tightly bound sheet around his neck.\n\nDeputy Batch checked the male and was able to detect a faint pulse. Deputy Batch then positioned himself where he could pick the male up to relieve some pressure from the knot around his neck, holding him in this position until other deputies arrived.\n\nUpon arrival, Deputy Christina Cea assisted Deputy Batch with holding the male while FTO Matt Bialobrzeski cut the sheet. They lowered the male down to the floor where he started to breathe but was still unconscious. The male was moved into the recovery position until Brevard County Fire Rescue arrived on scene and assumed medical care. Once stable, the male was transported to an area hospital where he eventually made a full recovery.\n\nWithout PST LeBeau’s diligence and experience, deputies would not have been able to locate the exact residence within the large apartment complex as quickly in a call where seconds count. There is no doubt the actions of PST LeBeau, Deputy Batch, Deputy Cea and FTO Bialobrzeski directly attributed to the successful outcome and preservation of life.\n\nCorporal Michael Peterson and Field Training Officer Ryan Hummel\n\nWhile working at the Brevard County Jail Complex, Corporal Michael Peterson was alerted to a possible medical emergency. Corporal Peterson contacted Field Training Officer Ryan Hummel who responded to the sleeping area of a housing unit where he found an inmate displaying labored breathing and unresponsive to verbal commands. FTO Hummel delivered a sternum rub which also was met with no response. He immediately requested assistance and continued to evaluate the inmate whose condition was worsening, ultimately needing to perform CPR.\n\nDuring these life-saving efforts, FTO Hummel aided in movement of the inmate from his bunk to the floor and delivered 5 rounds of chest compressions, assisted by Corporal Peterson who responded and provided rescue breaths. Ultimately, their efforts resulted in the inmate regaining consciousness.\n\nDuring this incident, Corporal Peterson and Field Training Officer Hummel utilized their training and experience to provide the inmate with life-saving care.\n\nField Training Officer Kevin Tesmacher\n\nWhile off-duty, Corrections Field Training Officer Kevin Tesmacher responded to a medical emergency which involved a long-time friend. During a pool tournament, the male suddenly collapsed and began to have a seizure. Field Training Officer Tesmacher quickly placed the male onto his side in the recovery position. After a few minutes, the man’s health declined and he stopped breathing. Field Training Officer Tesmacher immediately assessed the situation, and with the help of another friend, began administering CPR until Brevard County Fire Recue arrived on scene. Due to Field Training Officer Tesmacher’s quick response, the life of his dear friend was saved.\n\nField Training Officer Tesmacher’s poised demeanor under stressful circumstances was instrumental in saving the life of a valued friend. His response not only saved a life, but reflected the highest standards of the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nCorporal Sharhonda Haynes, Corporal Michael Peterson, Corporal Phillip Winston, Corporal Adam Turco, Corrections Deputy Brianna Figner and Corrections Deputy Lindsey Martinez\n\nWhile working at the Jail Complex, Corrections Deputy Brianna Figner was alerted to a possible medical emergency in one of the housing units. Upon responding to the area, Corrections Deputy Figner found an unresponsive inmate that was blue in the face and appeared to not be breathing. Corrections Deputy Figner performed multiple sternum rubs before requesting medical assistance.\n\nCorrections Corporal Phillip Winston was first to respond and assisted Corrections Deputy Figner with moving the inmate from his assigned top bunk to the floor where life-saving efforts could be conducted. Immediately after moving the inmate, Correction Deputy Figner began providing chest compressions. Corrections Corporal Adam Turco responded with and applied the AED as Corporal Winston began delivering the next round of chest compressions. Corporal Winston, Corporal Peterson Corporal Turco, Corporal Haynes and Corrections Deputy Lindsey Martinez all performed life-saving measures during the incident which ultimately resulted in the AED administering one shock to the inmate.\n\nThe collective efforts of these corrections deputies resulted in the inmate receiving additional medical care and ultimately making a full recovery.\n\nDeputy Chris Matthias, Deputy Kyle Reinhardt and Deputy Robert Bennett\n\nEast Precinct Deputy Chris Matthias, Deputy Kyle Reinhardt, and Deputy Robert Bennett, responded to a Merritt Island residence in reference to an unresponsive female.\n\nUpon arrival, Deputy Chris Matthias was met in the driveway of the residence by the victim’s daughter, who informed him which bedroom her mother and her grandmother were located in within the house. As Deputy Matthias made his way into the bedroom, he observed the victim laying on the ground. Her mother was observed kneeling beside her performing chest compressions. Deputy Matthias instructed her to step away from the victim to allow him to continue life saving measures, which he did until Deputy Kyle Reinhardt and Deputy Robert Bennett arrived on scene.\n\nDeputy Reinhardt activated his automated external defibrillator (AED) and Deputy Bennett subsequently applied the AED pads in the appropriate positions on the victim. The AED evaluated the victim and advised no shock was required and to continue with chest compressions. Deputy Matthias and Deputy Reinhardt continued to administer chest compressions until Brevard County Fire Rescue arrived and took over all life saving measures. BCFR informed on scene deputies the victim now had a pulse when they assumed treatment and subsequently transported her to an area hospital for further medical care.\n\nContact was made with the attending physician who informed deputies that the victim’s condition was currently stable and she was being admitted into the intensive care unit for further treatment.\n\nDuring a true emergency, Deputy Matthias, Deputy Reinhardt, and Deputy Bennett’s actions prevented the probable loss of life by exercising appropriate first aid procedures. The deputies’ actions were directly responsible for sustaining the victim’s life.\n\nCorporal Willard Freeman and Deputy James Christoffel\n\nThe Brevard County Sheriff’s Office received multiple 911 calls from residents hearing gunshots in the area of Cypress Avenue, Mims. The callers indicated they heard rapid gun fire, possibly from rifles. Several North Precinct deputies responded immediately and were told via the radio that children were walking home and someone had been chasing them and shooting at them.\n\nDeputy James Christoffel arrived in the area and found a juvenile laying in the roadway with gunshot wounds. Deputy Christoffel called for the immediate response of Brevard County Fire Rescue and retrieved his AED. As Deputy Christoffel returned to the victim, Corporal Willard Freeman arrived and assisted with the lifesaving measures. While applying the AED, the deputies assessed the victim’s wounds and discovered he had suffered multiple gunshots. When the AED advised not to shock the victim, Deputy Christoffel began chest compressions with the assistance of Corporal Freeman until Brevard County Fire Rescue arrived and took over the medical treatment of the juvenile. Deputy Christoffel immediately began taking pictures of the crime scene and the paramedics working on the victim in order to preserve evidence of the crime scene.\n\nAs Fire Rescue was caring for the patient, Deputy Christoffel obtained information on the likely identity of the victim as he continued to check the area for evidence and witnesses. Deputy Christoffel learned the victim was a sixteen-year-old male who had been ambushed while walking home from a friend’s house.\n\nDue to the efforts of the deputies on scene and BCFR, the victim regained a pulse and was able to be transported to the hospital for emergency treatment. Unfortunately, due to the severity of his wounds the young man passed away several days after the shooting.\n\nCorporal Freeman and Deputy Christoffel entered what could have been an active shooting scene, risking their own safety, to immediately tend to the medical needs of a child victim. Their actions prevented the immediate loss of life by exercising the appropriate first aid procedures competently and professionally. Had they not taken immediate action, the child may have died prior to the paramedic’s arrival, thus not giving him the opportunity to receive advanced medical care.\n\nDeputy Andrew Schoener, Deputy Christian Portocarrero and Deputy Tyler Conway\n\nDeputy Andrew Schoener, Deputy Christian Portocarrero and Deputy Tyler Conway responded to Indian River Colony Club in reference to a golf cart that crashed into a canal. While deputies were enroute, dispatch advised a golf cart had driven over a hill and landed in a water filled canal. They were further advised an elderly female was trapped under water, under the golf cart, and an elderly male was trying to get her out.\n\nDeputy Portocarrero was first to arrive on scene and was directed by the reporting person to the location of the golf cart. Deputy Portocarrero observed a canal, filled with water and steep sides, making ascent or descent into the canal very difficult. Deputy Portocarrero rapidly accessed the situation and noticed an elderly male sitting in the water, with water rising to the level of his upper chest. The elderly male was leaning against the golf cart, using the golf cart as support to keep from going under the water. Deputy Portocarrero also observed an elderly female submerged, face down in the water, at the front of the golf cart. Deputy Portocarrero did not hesitate and descended into the canal to render aid at the same time providing updates over the radio to responding units.\n\nDeputy Portocarrero approached the elderly female and attempted to pull her out of the water. He quickly discovered her right shoulder was pinned under the golf cart and her right arm was stuck underneath the floorboard area. Deputy Portocarrero lifted the front end of the golf cart, high enough to free the elderly female’s shoulder and arm. After freeing her, Deputy Portocarrero rolled the female over and observed her eyes were open but she was not breathing and did not have a pulse. At this time, Deputy Schoener arrived on scene and descended into the canal without hesitation, and immediately assisted Deputy Portocarrero in moving the female to the bank of the canal. Once on the bank, they began life saving measures by performing CPR.\n\nDeputy Conway soon arrived on scene, jumping into action by assisting Deputy Schoener and Deputy Portocarrero in moving the elderly female up the steep embankment in order to better provide medical treatment. Deputy Conway and Deputy Portocarrero continued to perform CPR, as well as initiating the use of the AED, until the arrival of Brevard County Fire Rescue, who assumed the lifesaving measures on the elderly female. As this was occurring, Deputy Schoener descended back into the canal to assist the elderly male that was still in the water.\n\nDeputy Schoener discovered the elderly male was injured and did not have the strength to stand up. Deputy Schoener entered the water and assisted the elderly male in standing up, to prevent his head from going under water. The elderly male did not have the strength to ascend out of the steep canal, so Deputy Schoener held the male up, until more units arrived to assist. Deputy Portocarrero assisted Deputy Schoener with the elderly male. Deputy Schoener, with the assistance of Deputy Portocarrero, and a medic with BCFR, lifted the elderly male out of the water and carried him up the steep embankment to safety.\n\nDeputy Portocarrero, Deputy Schoener, and Deputy Conway displayed outstanding abilities by effectively working together, as a team, to assist in providing lifesaving measures for two elderly persons, by removing them from harm’s way to receive proper medical treatment.\n\nDeputy Scott Falla\n\nField Training Officer Ummel and Deputy Scott Falla responded to a residence in Melbourne, in reference to a disturbance. Upon arrival, they witnessed Corporal Hannah Polito outside the residence saying she needed gloves, that there was a lot of blood. Corporal Polito started running towards the back yard of the residence and they followed after her.\n\nDeputy Falla and FTO Ummel located a male sitting near the edge of the pond, with what appeared to be a deep laceration on his wrist. Deputy Falla immediately obtained his agency issued tourniquet and applied it to the male’s upper arm. Deputy Falla and FTO Ummel helped the male walk to the front of the house to meet BCFR paramedics who transported him by ambulance to an area hospital.\n\nFurther investigation determined that the victim attempted to take his own life utilizing a box cutter to slice his wrist. According to paramedics who responded to the incident, without Deputy Falla’s crucial tourniquet application, the victim would have very likely died from the injury due to loss of blood volume.\n\nDeputy Falla acted swiftly and calmly to provide effective lifesaving treatment despite only being in his second week of phase 1 of field training. As a result of his actions, the male recovered from his injuries and received treatment for his emotional distress.\n\nChief Pilot John Coppola and Aviation Mechanic Mike Ryle\n\nHurricane Nicole impacted the east coast of Florida causing severe wind, rain and intense surf conditions in the Atlantic Ocean, Banana River and Indian River.\n\nDuring the height of the storm, the Communications Center received a call from a male who was riding out the storm on his 36-foot sailboat. The male advised that his sailboat had broken free from its mooring and was now sideways in the Indian River with the keel of the boat stuck in the bottom of the river. As the wind continued to produce large swells, the boat began to fill with water. Hearing the call for assistance, Chief Pilot John Coppola and Aviation Mechanic Mike Ryle responded to the area with an inflatable Zodiac boat.\n\nUpon arriving in the area, Chief Pilot Coppola and Mechanic Ryle launched the inflatable boat and battled the rough conditions while making their way to the sailboat. Once at the sailboat, they had to position their inflatable boat to ensure they could rescue the male while also ensuring their safety as well. They were able to safely bring him aboard their inflatable boat and return to the shoreline while continuing to battle the rough conditions. The male was turned over to the Cocoa Fire Department and Brevard County Fire Rescue who provided medical care.\n\nDuring this event, Chief Pilot Coppola and Mechanic Ryle placed their own safety in danger in order to conduct the water rescue. Their efforts most likely saved the life of this boater during a natural disaster.\n\nDeputy James Christoffel\n\nDeputies were dispatched to a residence in unincorporated Cocoa where a distraught male was threatening to commit suicide with a firearm. As deputies arrived on scene, they observed a male seated on the steps of a travel trailer in the back yard of the residence. While maintaining a perimeter position, Deputy Christoffel began speaking with the male and convinced him to stand up and surrender himself.\n\nThe male left the travel trailer, at which time he was observed to be armed with a firearm. The male then placed the barrel of the firearm against the side of his head while saying he was not going to hurt deputies but that he intended to end his life.\n\nDeputy Christoffel continued speaking with the male for approximately 20 minutes until he successfully convinced the male to lower the firearm. Once the firearm was lowered, he was taken into custody and transported to a mental health facility for evaluation and treatment.\n\nDeputy Christoffel did an outstanding job deescalating a potentially deadly situation, using his communication skills to save the life of an armed male suffering a mental health crisis.\n\nField Training Officer Greg Matthews, Deputy Kyle Fitzgerald, Deputy Josh Chamberlain and Deputy Marissa Wright\n\nFTO Greg Matthews along with Deputy Josh Chamberlain and Deputy Marissa Wright responded to Jetty Park in reference to a possible drowning. Upon their arrival, the deputies observed a subject partially on the beach, who had been recovered unresponsive from the water.\n\nNoting the subject was unresponsive, Deputies Wright, Matthews, and Chamberlain all took turns performing CPR while Deputy Kyle Fitzgerald applied AED patches to the patient. During his break from chest compressions, Deputy Chamberlain responded to the Jetty parking lot to identify the subject by querying his vehicle’s tag.\n\nParamedics arrived on scene, taking over for deputies who were all sharing CPR responsibilities. The male was transported to an area hospital where Deputy Chamberlain and Deputy Wright followed to obtain a status on his condition. Once at the hospital, they were informed the patient was in critical condition however was likely to survive.\n\nAccording to hospital personnel, the male undoubtedly would have succumbed to injuries on scene if not for the quick response of these deputies and their teamwork in performing lifesaving measures.\n\nRESERVE DEPUTY OF THE YEAR\n\nReserve Deputy Dylan Lemoine joined the Sheriff’s Office in 2020 as an Auxiliary Deputy Sheriff. While serving as an Auxiliary Deputy, and working full-time for a large corporate health care provider, he still found time to continue his law enforcement training, earning his Law Enforcement Certification in 2021.

Remaining calm, PST Shinn obtained information on both the victim and the attacker and determined that both were currently safe. She continued to speak with the victim until the arrival of deputies on scene. It was later learned that the attacker had been stalking the victim for weeks and planned on committing a murder. The actions of PST Shinn during this call assisted in the peaceful arrest of this potential violent offender.\n\nFebruary\n\nPublic Safety Telecommunicator Jessica Heath\n\nWhile working dispatch, PST Jessica Heath was alerted to a call for assistance from Cocoa Beach Police in reference to a driver who had fled from a traffic stop. Hearing the direction of travel, PST Heath was aware that the subject was running in the direction of two of our K-9 units that were on beach patrol. PST Heath provided these units with the information and monitored the incident via Countywide where both agencies were patched together. Almost immediately, the units came into contact with the subject and took him into custody without incident. Due to her awareness and quick actions, PST Heath assisted in the arrest of a subject who was later determined to have been wanted by the FBI and FDLE for four felony warrants.\n\nMarch\n\nPublic Safety Telecommunicator Sarah Codding\n\nWhile working South Radio, PST Sarah Codding dispatched an in-progress burglary call at a residence in Melbourne Beach. Due to the proximity of the call, units from Melbourne Beach also responded. For over three hours, PST Codding worked this priority call that involved multiple agencies. PST Codding handled herself in a professional manner, providing updated information to all units on scene. PST Codding assisted in bringing this call to a successful conclusion through the arrest of at least one of the suspects.\n\nApril\n\nPublic Safety Telecommunicator Eric Williams\n\nPST Eric Williams distinguished himself in the handling of two in progress violent felony calls. The first was the carjacking of a pizza delivery driver in the Cocoa area. As the victim advised he had been dragged down the street by the suspects, PST Williams obtained the necessary information that led responding deputies to the vehicle and enabled them to apprehend the suspect. In the second incident, a male called advising that he had been stabbed in the chest. Assuring the safety of the victim, who had managed to drive himself to the hospital, PST Williams coordinated the response of deputies to the area where the suspect was last observed. With his assistance, deputies were able to locate and take into custody this violent offender.\n\nMay\n\nPublic Safety Telecommunicator Andrew Polk\n\nFor his actions in handling two separate shooting incidents, PST Andrew Polk is being recognized.

Not only did PST Polk receive the call, he was also responsible for the radio and response of deputies to the scene. His professionalism during this violent event not only assisted the responding deputies at the scene but also the deputies who ultimately located and arrested the suspect.\n\nJune\n\nPublic Safety Telecommunicator Erin Northcutt\n\nPST Erin Northcutt answered a call from a female who advised that her husband had retrieved a gun from his vehicle and fired it twice. After ascertaining that no one had been targeted or injured, PST Northcutt remained on the phone with the female for forty minutes, keeping her calm and obtaining a full layout of the house to assist units on the perimeter. With her assistance, deputies were able to safely remove the female and her children from the residence, obtain a protection order and remove the firearms from the residence.\n\nJuly\n\nCommunications Center Shift Supervisor Andrew LeBeau\n\nAs deputies were responding to a large apartment complex where a male was threatening to commit suicide, the caller abruptly disconnected before advising the exact location this was happening. Shift Supervisor Andrew LeBeau cross referenced the phone number and was able to determine the exact location. Based on previous calls, Shift Supervisor LeBeau was able to direct the responding deputies to where the incident was occurring in the large apartment complex. Using this information, deputies were successful in finding the male and providing lifesaving medical interventions that ultimately saved the male’s life. Without the information provided by Shift Supervisor LeBeau, deputies would not have located the male in the apartment complex in time to successfully intervene and save his life.\n\nAugust\n\nCommunications Center Shift Supervisor Nicole Bernhard\n\nAfter answering a 911 call from a suicidal male, Shift Supervisor Nicole Bernhard realized that the voice of the caller sounded familiar. Nearly three years earlier, Nicole had prevented this same male from committing suicide by keeping him on the phone until deputies arrived, successfully pulling him back over the rail he intended to jump from. Faced with a similar situation, Shift Supervisor Bernhard spoke with the male for ten minutes, keeping him engaged on the call until deputies arrived and safely detained him for a mental health evaluation. Nicole is no stranger to handling priority calls, however this is the first time in her career she has convinced the same person twice that his life was worth living.\n\nSeptember\n\nPublic Safety Telecommunicator Andrew Polk\n\nPST Andrew Polk is being recognized for two incidents, the first regarding an escaped prisoner from the Florida Department of Corrections Work Release facility. PST Polk coordinated the response of not just patrol units, but also Agents from General Crimes and Homicide as well as members of the GAMEOVER Task Force. At the height of the incident there were over thirty units involved and he seamlessly fulfilled their requests and continually provided updated information to assist in the search.\n\nThe second incident involved a traffic stop where a suspect attempted to attack a deputy with a hammer before fleeing the scene.

PST Shelby Kochendorfer coordinated communications for these units, providing updated locations and information as well as coordinating the response of Aviation and K-9. Her ability to handle ever changing information during this chaotic event assisted in the capture of this violent suspect without further incident.\n\nPUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATORS OF THE YEAR\n\nEMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH\n\nThe recipients were selected from the 375 civilians who serve in numerous capacities throughout the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nJanuary\n\nLogistics Specialist Tracy Wilson\n\nIn the past, agency plaques were obtained through outside vendors. In order to cut costs and be more efficient, Central Logistics took on the role of making all agency issued plaques. The Annual BCSO Awards Ceremony and Speedy Dewitt Tactical Firearms Challenge make up the bulk of these requests. Last year, Tracy produced over 100 plaques for these two events alone. In addition, she produced plaques requested by multiple units and precincts for personnel transferring, leaving the agency, or retiring. Although this is just one part of her varied job responsibilities at Central Logistics, Tracy always has a positive attitude and a willingness to get the job done.\n\nFebruary\n\nAccreditation Coordinators Cheryl Sink and Christine Bean\n\nThe Accreditation Unit monitors and maintains all agency policies and procedures as well as all forms, affidavits and printed guides and manuals used daily by agency personnel. With the decline in use of Internet Explorer, we began receiving many employee complaints regarding the inability to access and navigate within many of our critical agency fillable forms and documents.\n\nResearch was conducted by Cheryl and Christine to develop a solution to the forms and documents dilemma. A solution to most of our agency forms access was satisfied with the use of certain software, which was already in use by some members of our agency, and was available for implementation at no further cost.\n\nThis resulted in the development of the Agency Forms Library now available to all personnel on the portal. Cheryl and Christine went further to develop training and step-by-step direction to all personnel. Since the implementation of Forms Library, employee access issues have been resolved resulting in increased agency productivity.\n\nMarch\n\nValidations Technician Nena Carmany\n\nNena’s persistence, thoroughness and investigative knowledge led to the arrest of two wanted fugitives whose warrants had been outstanding for over thirty years. Through her investigative efforts, Nena uncovered a possible address in Columbia County (FL) for a fugitive with a Violation of Probation warrant issued in 1986. Using this address, deputies located and arrested the fugitive. Several days later, Nena found a possible address in Marion County (FL) for another fugitive who had violated probation with his warrant issued in 1989. Once again, Nena’s information led to the arrest of a fugitive, who had evaded capture for three decades. Her determination led to the successful conclusion of these long-standing open cases, both culminating in the arrest and prosecution of the offender.\n\nApril\n\nAnimal Enforcement Supervisor Olivia Williams\n\nOlivia has served this agency in a variety of roles, to include Animal Care Specialist, Animal Enforcement Officer, Training Officer, Animal Enforcement Bite/Dangerous Dog Investigator, and currently as an Animal Services Enforcement Supervisor.\n\nDue to Olivia’s dedication and great understanding of the court system, county ordinances, state laws, and rabies protocols, her supervisors received multiple accolades from the victims of her investigations, and their thankfulness for her outstanding court presentation and the time she took with each and every one of them. On multiple occasions, the defendants in the cases would often reach out to Olivia’s supervisors, praising Olivia for treating them with respect, professionalism, and dignity.\n\nThis past year, Olivia was promoted to the position of Animal Enforcement Supervisor. Shortly thereafter, one of our Enforcement Supervisors left the agency, leaving only her to fill this role. Olivia immediately stepped up and assumed the responsibility of supervising all twelve of the Animal Enforcement Officers, monitoring between 50-100 Animal Services’ calls a day, all while maintaining the safety and supervision of their activities.\n\nWithout Olivia’s dedication to the entire Animal Services Team, and her passion for animals, we would not be as successful and progressive as we are today.\n\nMay\n\nAutomotive Technician Austin Severson\n\nWhile travelling north on I-95, Automotive Technician Severson observed what he believed to be a traffic crash with a possible ejection. As Austin stopped and neared the vehicle, he observed the driver laying on the ground, next to the vehicle, on the side of the roadway. Austin immediately went to provide medical aid and stayed with the driver until deputies arrived at the crash site and took control of the scene.\n\nJune\n\nLatent Print Examiner Karlie Kasznay\n\nAs part of her training program, new employee Karlie Kasznay was tasked with re-examining latent cases from 2020. The goal of this particular training task was to familiarize her with the analysis portion of latent examination as well as with the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) when a latent of value was observed.\n\nIn one of the first cases she examined, Karlie successfully located a fingerprint of value and began an AFIS search of the fingerprint, which resulted in a potential hit. Prior to this, there were no leads in the case and it was closed pending further investigative information. In a second case, LPE Kasznay was also able to successfully locate a latent fingerprint of value and begin a search in AFIS of the fingerprint, which resulted in a potential hit. Sergeant Fletcher advised that the new lead was for a subject not previously known in this case. He further advised that the second identification was for a known subject in that case.\n\nIt should be noted that LPE Kasznay had no previous experience as a latent print examiner with another law enforcement agency. Yet, within one month of starting her employment with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office, she has already assisted by contributing two substantial new leads in separate cases.\n\nJuly\n\nAnimal Care Center Supervisor Emily Gilbert\n\nEmily started her career with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office Animal Services as an Animal Care Technician and has continually progressed to the position of Animal Welfare Coordinator where she coordinated special events and our volunteer program, to this year becoming one of our Shelter Supervisors.\n\nAs Shelter Supervisor, Emily made an immediate impact on the shelter staff by gaining the staffs trust and respect as a leader. In addition to the 27 employees assigned to the shelter, she also coordinates the efforts of 60 volunteers. She also participates in outside events, facilitates weekly obedience classes, as well as many other activities all while supervising the shelter operation- An impressive feat for a seasoned supervisor, let alone a newly promoted one.\n\nOur team could not be more proud of what Emily has accomplished in her career here at BCSO Animal Services. Her dedication and commitment to this organization, and to the animals we are entrusted to care for is simply amazing.\n\nAugust\n\nChief Legal Counsel Laura Moody and Payroll Coordinator Julie Nycum\n\nDue to the challenges of recruitment, the utilization of a hiring bonus and academy sponsorships has become a vital tool to hire candidates, each of which results in an employee contract. During the past two years, over one hundred contracts have been awarded requiring a substantial financial obligation from the agency, whereby it becomes imperative to recoup these funds if the contract is not upheld by the employee.\n\nOver the course of several months, Chief Legal Counsel Laura Moody and Payroll Coordinator Julie Nycum worked collectively to review employee contracts. Each brought a unique perspective in reviewing the contracts resulting in a more comprehensive contract. Chief Legal Counsel Moody ensured the rewritten contract language is clear and concise. Payroll Coordinator Nycum reviews the contracts if any employee leaves prior to fulfilling the terms of the contract and must determine what the employee will need to do in order to satisfy the contract.\n\nThe contracts have been revised to provide a clearer understanding of the agreement being entered into between the two parties. The attention to detail and team work exhibited by all has resulted in contracts that employees can easily understand and seamless enforcement of contracts when necessary.\n\nSeptember\n\nDesk Officer Jaclyn Flake\n\nDuring the months of September and October, the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office was tasked with fingerprinting all of the Brevard County Fire and Rescue personnel. During a few short weeks, Jaclyn fingerprinted almost two hundred and fifty of the four hundred and seventy BCFR employees. This task was completed quickly and efficiently while still keeping up with all of her other daily responsibilities.\n\nIt should also be noted that Jaclyn readily volunteered in assisting the Brevard County School Board when they were short staffed. In the few days helping out, she completed nearly three hundred fingerprints on school board employees, contractors and volunteers.\n\nWithin a few days of fingerprinting the BCFR personnel, many of the fire stations from outside the West Precinct’s geographical boundaries were being directed to visit West precinct due to the level of professionalism and prompt and friendly service they were receiving from Jaclyn. District Chief Chris DiSciascio took the time to write a letter stating he greatly appreciated Jaclyn’s hard work and dedication.\n\nOctober\n\nBooking Technician Kaylen Brooks\n\nBooking Technician Brooks has been a vital member of the Booking team at the Jail Complex.

The male advised that his sailboat had broken free from its mooring and was now sideways in the Indian River beginning to fill with water. Chief Pilot John Coppola and Aviation Mechanic Michael Ryle responded to the area with an aviation truck and inflatable Zodiac boat.\n\nChief Pilot Coppola and Mechanic Ryle deployed the inflatable boat and battled the rough conditions while they made their way to the sailboat. Once they arrived at the sailboat, they made contact with the male and were able to safely bring him aboard their inflatable boat. The three then proceeded to battle the rough conditions, finally reaching the shore where Cocoa Fire and Brevard County Fire Rescue was waiting to provide medical care.\n\nDuring this event, Chief Pilot Coppola and Mechanic Ryle placed their own safety in danger in order to complete this water rescue, which most likely saved the life of this boater in distress.\n\nDecember\n\nCorrections Technician Steven Durso\n\nDuring a shift at the Jail Complex, Corrections Technician Durso noticed that an inmate was attempting to jump over the railing of the second floor in a housing unit.

She learned the suspect was coordinating with other inmates to bring the drug laced paperwork back for him from their court hearing. The suspect would contact his girlfriend to coordinate the drop off of the paperwork based on the inmate’s court date, who then transported the documents back to the jail. Corporal Thomas contacted Special Investigations who conducted the investigation that culminated in the arrest of the inmate and his girlfriend.\n\nIt is without a doubt that the actions and attention to detail of Corporal Thomas saved many inmates from potential drug overdose or other issues related to the narcotics that were seized before they could be distributed throughout the jail complex. This case has also set a precedence on how the jail complex processes all legal mail with the inmate being provided a copy, not the original.\n\nMarch\n\nCorrections Deputy Shauna Dankins\n\nCorrections Deputy Shauna Dankins was recently placed on a night shift rotation in facility maintenance, where her duties included supervising inmate workers in the performance of their jobs, assisting shifts with various maintenance needs and ensuring the Jail Complex maintained an inspection ready level of cleanliness.\n\nAfter attending a tour of another facility, Corrections Deputy Dankins learned new techniques to build upon and improve the appearance of the Brevard County Jail Complex. She was able to take what was learned from the experience and immediately apply it. She has since overseen the cleaning, stripping and waxing of floors within the Jail Complex, which has greatly improved the appearance of the jail in a short amount of time. Corrections Deputy Dankins demonstrated exceptional personal initiative and increased efficiency for the personnel of facility maintenance.\n\nApril\n\nCorrections Corporal Travis Cooper and Corrections Deputy Shavonne Cook\n\nWhile working at the Brevard County Jail Complex, Corrections Corporal Travis Cooper and Corrections Deputy Shavonne Cook were alerted to an issue in one of the housing units by inmates asking for assistance.

Corporal Jose Rodriguez responded to their call for assistance along with his cadaver K9 partner, Tito.\n\nThe search for the missing person involved multiple first responders from nine different agencies. At one point, everyone involved in the search was asked to search east of where the missing person’s SUV was located. Corporal Rodriguez felt the missing person would have had a difficult time walking directly east from her original location due to the amount of brush in the area and lack of trails. Corporal Rodriguez suggested he begin to search in an area northeast of where the vehicle was found.\n\nCorporal Rodriguez and K9 Tito were the first to locate remains of the missing person and the search was then concentrated in the area he focused on. Corporal Rodriguez and K9 Tito have proven to be a valuable asset to the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office and several other counties throughout the state of Florida.\n\nJuly\n\nCorrections Deputy Dashawn Edward\n\nUpon receiving a tip from an informant, Corrections Deputy Deshawn Edward initiated an investigation in regards to an inmate who was possibly in possession of fentanyl within the Jail Complex.
