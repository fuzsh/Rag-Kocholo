        "text": "LONDON and SOUTHLAKE, Texas – Jan. 9, 2024 – Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ: SABR), a leading software and technology provider to the global travel industry, has entered into a multi-year distribution agreement with International Airlines Group (IAG) that will expand their existing partnership and further promote modern travel retailing practices.\n\nThe agreement will allow Sabre-connected travel buyers and agencies to sell traditional EDIFACT content as well as having competitive access to NDC offers from British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling – including Additional Price Points and ancillaries – through the Sabre travel marketplace globally. This enhanced content will provide travel agencies with a wider range of options to compare and shop for, while travelers will benefit from an improved experience with more choice and transparency. Sabre and IAG’s airlines are working closely together and will communicate as NDC content is rolled out to Sabre-connected travel agencies on a carrier-by-carrier basis.\n\nThe agreement between Sabre and IAG underscores the industry’s shift towards modern travel retailing, where airlines can differentiate their offerings and provide more personalized experiences to travelers. Both Sabre and IAG are committed to advancing the NDC standard as a key component in the industry’s evolution towards modern airline retailing enabled by offers and orders.\n\nColm Lacy, British Airways’ Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We are on a journey to A Better BA and we continue to invest across the business as part of that commitment. Not only are we improving the experience of those customers who fly with us, but also the way we work with our valued travel agent and travel buyer partners. We understand how valuable retailing is to them, and IAG’s partnership with Sabre allows us to make a wide range of attractable offers available even further across the globe.”\n\nThis agreement is another milestone in the IAG strategy to embrace digital retailing practices and offer more opportunities for customers to access NDC content. The partnership with IAG demonstrates Sabre’s continued commitment to driving value and serving the diverse interests of the global travel ecosystem.\n\n“We are very excited about what’s ahead. The travel industry is entering a new era of personalized retailing that will bring better experiences for travelers and new revenue opportunities for airlines and travel agencies,” said Roshan Mendis, Chief Commercial Officer, Sabre Travel Solutions. “It’s fantastic to work with a strong, forward-thinking partner like IAG that is just as committed as we are to driving the industry forward.”\n\n###\n\nAbout Sabre Corporation\n\nSabre Corporation is a leading software and technology company that powers the global travel industry, serving a wide range of travel companies including airlines, hoteliers, travel agencies and other suppliers.
