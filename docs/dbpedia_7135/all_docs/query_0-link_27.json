        "text": "International Airlines Group is one of the world’s largest airline groups with 464 aircraft flying to 243 destinations and carrying more than 67 million passengers each year.\n\nFormed in January 2011, IAG is the holding company of British Airways and Iberia. It is a Spanish registered company with shares traded on the London Stock Exchange and Spanish Stock Exchanges. The corporate head office for IAG is in London, UK.\n\nIAG combines the two leading airlines in the UK and Spain, enabling them to enhance their presence in the aviation market while retaining their individual brands and current operations. The airlines’ customers benefit from a larger combined network for both passengers and cargo and a greater ability to invest in new products and services through improved financial robustness.\n\nThe airline industry is moving gradually towards consolidation though some regulatory restrictions still prevail. IAG’s mission is to play its full role in future industry consolidation both on a regional and global scale."
