        "text": "There’re 3,494,428 registered companies in Spain as of 2020. If you’re looking for jobs in Spain for English speakers, the list of companies can seem endless! Luckily 1.9 million of these belong to self-employed individuals, leaving 1.5 million potential companies for you to work at.\n\nWhile narrowing down the top companies in Spain may seem daunting, we’ve done the groundwork for you based on the biggest companies and the best employers.\n\nJobs in Spain\n\nOne of the easiest ways for foreigners to find a job in Spain is to consider large, well-known companies. These are the companies that are more likely to sponsor your work visa, offer a competitive salary, and use English as their business language. Moreover, there’re only 172 companies that hire more than 5000 people and 880 companies that hire 1,000-4,999 people.\n\nIn comparison, you’ve got the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although they hire most of Spain’s workforce, a majority of the SMEs are micro and hire between 3-10 people. This, combined with a heavy focus on Spanish and a low probability of issuing a work visa makes it hard for internationals to find a job in Spain at SMEs.\n\nWhere to look for work in Spain\n\nGiven most expats look for work in foreign or large companies, we’ve narrowed down the list from 1.5 million companies to some of the largest companies and the best employers in Spain.\n\nTo give you an edge over other expats and maximise your chances of finding a job abroad, we’ll briefly mention some global top companies and introduce you to some top Spanish companies that you may not know of.\n\nTop Companies in Spain: Size and Net worth\n\nOne way to assess a top company is to look at its number of employees and their net worth. We’ve looked at companies that hire more than 1,000 employees and have a net worth of upwards of a billion.
