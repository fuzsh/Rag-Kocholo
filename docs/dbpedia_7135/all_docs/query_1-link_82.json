        "text": "News\n\nAdequate Air Europa remedies harder to identify for IAG’s second bid: EU\n\nAir Europa’s improved performance since 2021 made it harder to identify sufficient remedies during IAG’s second failed attempt to acquire the Spanish carrier, according to the European Commission.\n\nNews\n\nIAG offered to hand over 52% of Air Europa frequencies to secure acquisition\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia owner IAG was willing to sacrifice 52% of Air Europa’s 2023 frequencies to secure its acquisition of the business, but that was not enough to satisfy the European Commission.\n\nNews\n\nIAG lifts first quarter operating profit on strong passenger demand\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia parent IAG increased operating profits before exceptionals in the first quarter to €68 million ($59 million) driven by higher passenger revenues for the period.\n\nNews\n\nIAG and Air Europa formally notified of EU competition concerns over proposed tie-up\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia parent IAG has been told that its proposed acquisition of Air Europa could restrict competition, particularly on routes to and from Spanish cities. The European Commission has outlined its concerns in a formal statement of objections to the companies, as it continues its in-depth investigation into ...\n\nNews\n\nIAG chief warns blocking consolidation could ‘destroy’ airlines\n\nThe chief executive of IAG has implored regualtors to allow consolidation to happen in Europe, arguing that the futures of some carriers are at risk if deals are blocked\n\nAirline Business\n\nUpbeat IAG strikes positive note as BA and Iberia head growth in 2024\n\nAfter delivering one of the highest operating profits in its history, European airline group IAG offered little by way of firm guidance for the year to come but was in positive mood in its commentary.\n\nNews\n\nIAG chief still optimistic over Air Europa deal\n\nIAG chief executive Luis Gallego remains optimistic that the group can secure approval for its long-running attempt to acquire Spanish carrier Air Europa after putting forward further remedies to address European regulator competition concerns over the planned acquisition.\n\nNews\n\nIAG almost trebles operating profit in 2023\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia parent IAG nearly trebled full-year operating profits in 2023 to just over €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion) after lifting revenue 28% during the year.\n\nNews\n\nIAG secures large e-fuel commitment from US-based firm Twelve\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia parent IAG has unveiled its largest sustainable aviation fuel purchase so far, with an agreement to take 260 million USgal (984 million litres) of synthetic e-fuel from California-based manufacturer Twelve. The ‘power-to-liquid’ e-fuel – or e-SAF – is generated by combining green hydrogen with carbon dioxide ...\n\nAirline Business\n\nRegulators in no mood to wave through airline M&A activity\n\nWhile it quickly became apparent that January 2024 would be remembered as an inauspicious start to the year for airline safety, from the mid-point of the month onwards it was clear that the same would be said regarding consolidation.\n\nAirline Business\n\nLevel to get its own AOC as part of IAG Spanish expansion plans\n\nIAG’s long-haul, low-cost carrier Level is to get its own air operator’s certificate (AOC) and will increase its fleet to eight aircraft by 2026 under growth plans disclosed at the airline group’s Capital Markets day on 21 November.\n\nAirline Business\n\nCan European airline group consolidation aims come to fruition?\n\nConsolidation is very much in the air for the three big European airline groups, all of whom are in the process of trying to get acquisitions done and with the prospect of a move for TAP Air Portugal still in the offing.\n\nNews\n\nIAG positive on outlook but ‘mindful’ of geopolitical issues\n\nWhile IAG gave relatively little away in terms of its full-year guidance after posting a strong set of third-quarter profits, this perhaps reflects confidence in the return of the fundamentals of the business more than a lack of visibility. IAG lifted operating profits 43% to €1.75 billion ($2.05 billion) in ...\n\nNews\n\nIAG carriers top pre-Covid levels as group posts Q3 profit of €1.7bn\n\nIAG posted a 43% jump in operating profits to €1.75 billion ($2.05 billion) for the third quarter on continued strong demand which drove passenger revenues up a fifth for the period.\n\nAirline Business\n\nEuropean consolidation wave spreads north with Air France-KLM move for SAS\n\nConsolidation within Europe post-pandemic has largely focused on opportunities for the big three airline groups to bolster their presence in the south of the continent."
