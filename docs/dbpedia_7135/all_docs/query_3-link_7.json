        "text": "International Airlines Group is one of the world's largest airline groups with 525 aircraft flying to 255 destinations and carrying almost 95 million passengers each year. It is the third largest group in Europe and the sixth largest in the world, based on revenue.\n\nFormed in January 2011, IAG is the parent company of Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and LEVEL. It is a Spanish registered company with shares traded on the London Stock Exchange and Spanish Stock Exchanges. The corporate head office for IAG is in London, UK.\n\nIAG combines the leading airlines in the UK and Spain, enabling them to enhance their presence in the aviation market while retaining their individual brands and current operations. The airlines' customers benefit from a larger combined network for both passengers and cargo and a greater ability to invest in new products and services through improved financial robustness.\n\nThe airline industry is moving gradually towards consolidation though some regulatory restrictions still prevail. IAG's mission is to play its full role in future industry consolidation both on a regional and global scale.\n\nBritish Airways and Iberia are members of the oneworld alliance."
