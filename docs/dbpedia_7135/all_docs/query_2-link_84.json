        "text": "International Airlines Group is one of the world's largest airline groups, with a fleet of 573 aircraft, operating 256 destinations and carried around 95 million passengers in 2022. The following airline brands are part of IAG: Aer Lingus; British Airways; Iberia; Level and Vueling. It is a Spanish registered company with shares traded on the London and Madrid Stock Exchanges and is part of the FTSE 100 Index.\n\nWe were delighted to welcome Stuart Morgan, Head of Investor Relations, to the latest Yellowstone Advisory webinar to provide an introduction to the company and update on performance and prospects following the recent Capital Markets Day.

Balance sheet leverage has fallen to 1.4x, the same level as it was at the end of 2019. This year has witnessed strong customer demand, a market with constrained supply, unit costs have reduced and strong cash generation has resulted in a reduction in gross and net debt.\n\nThe four near term strategic priorities over the next 3-4 years are; transformation: looking to make improvements across all businesses so they can reach their long term potential; Leveraging: the good position of the Spanish operations after improvements in the last 10 years to generate over €1.5bn of operating profit; Investing: investment in British Airways which has been slightly left behind…"
