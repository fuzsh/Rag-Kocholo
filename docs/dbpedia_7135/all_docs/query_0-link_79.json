        "text": "#AirAsia continues to champion women in airline operations with launch of Moms-on-Duty kit On the occasion of Mother’s Day, AirAsia announced the addition of a new nursing cover to its signature uniforms for pilots and cabin crew. The cover is part of a Moms-on-Duty kit that the airlines will be providing to new mothers in operations starting this year. The uniform enhancement symbolically marks the launch of a new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiative at the airline to create stronger workplace policies in support of working mothers in operational roles. AirAsia Chief People Officer, Intan Shahira Mohd Shahru said, “Women who work in operational roles face unique challenges. They are required to work shifts in an unconventional work environment. The adjustment back to flying hours while juggling motherhood responsibilities can significantly impact their wellbeing, especially those who are still nursing. Since last year, we began looking into policies and practices that can ease their return to work.” https://bit.ly/3Uy9ELC AirAsia #Malaysia #Aviation #SoutheastAsia\n\nSuch a refreshing and exciting interview. I believe that women in leadership offer a very unique drive and perspective. I may sound like a broken record here, but until everyone else starts singing this song, I will keep playing it. We do not overcome new challenges without new perspectives. I look forward to the day when these thoughts are actively fleshed out within our company, and industry wide. Clear, flexible pathways to leadership for women interested in advancing their careers should not be optional. This means understanding family needs, different leadership styles, learning styles, and offering flexible scheduling for these advancement opportunities to better accommodate and capture great talent already in the network.\n\n🎉 Congratulations to the 58 organizations that have just achieved Top Employer certification! 🌟 BUT...

What has happened so far? The past months have been incredibly full of rewarding experiences for me, filled with international events, innovative projects, network expansion, and new partnerships. Here are my personal highlights: 📅 Event Highlights: > Americas Market Conference, Mexico City: Discussed market trends and business opportunities. > A++ Presidents Meeting, Montréal: Met with sales leaders and A++ counterparts to plan future projects as well as strengthened alliances with Air Canada and United Airlines. > International Air Transport Association (IATA) Annual General Meeting, Dubai: Provides a focus for emerging industry issues, current challenges and opportunities. 🚀 New Lufthansa Group (LHG) Travel Experience: Lufthansa Allegris: The inaugural flight took off in May 2024, showcasing the reinvention of the Lufthansa seating options and advanced comfort features on the Airbus A350, significantly enhancing the in-flight experience and overall satisfaction. 🌐 Network expansion: New intercontinental routes: Over 310 destinations, 120 countries, including significant new additions to LHG airlines’ 2024 intercontinental network. Demonstrating growth and efforts to strengthen the global network. To name a few: > Austrian Airlines route from Vienna to Boston > Lufthansa route from Frankfurt to Minneapolis > Discover Airlines route from Munich to Marrakech > Swiss International Air Lines route from Zurich to Seoul Read about these destinations here: https://lnkd.in/eR_pH69V 🤝 Green Light for ITA: ITA joins LHG: The European Commission has given the green light for ITA Airways to become part of the Lufthansa Group!

I look forward to what the second half of 2024 will bring! ✈️ #LufthansaGroup #Recap #Highlights\n\nIn August 2023, the #ACCC took court action alleging #Qantas advertised flights it had already cancelled. 🛫 📰 🚫 Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g8WVYRck 👨💼 🔄 In September 2023 Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce announced that he would step down \"to help help the company accelerate its renewal\" Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g33RBUUJ In June 2023, #SingaporeAirlines won the title of the world's #best airline and once again emerged as the top airline in the prestigious Skytrax World Airline Awards. ✈️ 🏆 🌏 One of the key factors in Singapore Airlines' #success was its emphasis on valuing its #workforce and significantly supporting them. Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g8RdDqfW On December 31st, 2023, I penned the following blog article on www.SkillsAcademia.org while gazing at the sky that day, envisioning a healthy, productive, and peaceful 2024 for my family, friends, business, education, and the #globalcommunity. 🗓️3️⃣1️⃣ 🎉🌟🥂 The #SkillsAcademia Research & Insights Collective for Excellence as a nonprofit community is driven by the #vision and the belief that the #sky is the limit. This no-limit approach applies to you as well, whether you're a #CEO, #researcher, #IndustryPractitioner, #professional in any sector, or a full-time stay-at-home #dad, #mom, #stepmom, or anyone else! ☁️ 🚀 💼 📊 👨👩👧👦 Read an extract of my blog article below, and consider the journeys of Qantas, Singapore Airlines, and your own brand—whether personal or corporate. 💡🌍⏳ As Victor Hugo once said, “Nothing else in the world…not all the armies…is so powerful as an idea whose time has come.” 💡🌍⏳ ...This insightful observation prompts us to consider a fundamental question: What limits companies and organisations from embracing transformative ideas, such as strategic investments in #HumanCapital, that can genuinely empower their entire #brand? In a world where the sky is the limit, how can our institutions, airlines, manufacturing sector, and small to medium businesses embrace visionary concepts capable of revolutionising their trajectory and fostering the holistic empowerment of both their #workforce and #brand? Read full blog article here: https://lnkd.in/gTxDC5k6 Have you experienced a 'Sky's the limit' moment lately? 🌌✨ And do you know of any organisations or brands that have soared to new heights recently, or are working on it?\n\n🔥 🌟 Bumper Bonus! Singapore Airlines Announces 8 Months Of Salary As Bonus For All Employees! 🌟 🔥 An inspiring move by #SingaporeAirlines, setting an example of profit sharing and recognizing the invaluable role #employees play. Kudos to #Emirates #Airlines as well, for distributing 5 months' salary as a #bonus. Such gestures reinforce the belief that employees are the backbone of any #successful #organization. However, it's disheartening to witness the stark contrast in the Indian aviation industry. #AirIndia, #GoAir, #JetAirways, #SpiceJet—all plagued by #mismanagement and financial hardships. 🛫 This raises a perplexing question: Why do #corporate boards and #shareholders refrain from penalizing top #management and, in certain cases, key employees for these mounting losses? Is it even possible? 🤔 Let's delve deeper into this issue and explore different #perspectives. One could argue that holding top management accountable for their #decisions and #performance is crucial in upholding corporate responsibility. After all, #leaders should bear the consequences of their actions, especially when it affects the livelihoods of countless employees. On the other hand, some might argue that the #complexities of the #aviation #industry, with its ever-changing #landscape and external factors, make it challenging to assign blame solely to the top brass. They contend that focusing on #collaboration, #innovation, and long-term #strategies is a more prudent approach to navigate turbulent times. So, what's your view on this matter? Should corporate #boards and shareholders be more proactive in penalizing top management and key employees in the face of losses? Or do you believe that a broader and more nuanced perspective is required to understand the intricacies of the aviation industry? Let's engage in a constructive #dialogue and share our thoughts. we can explore new ideas and approaches to ensure #sustainable #growth, employee well-being, and the overall success of the aviation sector. 🌍✈️💼 #CorporateAccountability #india #bharat #EmployeeEngagement #leadership #AviationIndustryChallenges #sundaymood #corporategovernance"
