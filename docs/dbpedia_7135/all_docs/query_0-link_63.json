With this move, SFO will be offering more nonstop flights to Spain than any other Bay Area airport. LEVEL parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) plans to begin operating two flights per week from SFO to Barcelona on October 31, 2018, using an Airbus A330-200 aircraft with 288 seats.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome LEVEL’s Barcelona service to SFO this fall,” said Airport Director Ivar C. Satero. “This move reaffirms our position as the international gateway Airport of Choice in the Bay Area, and offers travelers seamless, cost-effective access this exciting destination in Spain.”\n\nLEVEL offers its clients the ability to tailor their entire journey, depending on their needs and budget. LEVEL set up its first European base at Barcelona El Prat airport in June 2017. Since then, it has brought thousands of passengers closer to their most desired and inspirational destinations.\n\nLEVEL launched service from Oakland International Airport in June 2017. Sister airline Iberia, the flag carrier of Spain, began operating nonstop flights from SFO to Madrid in April 2018, and currently operates three flights per week. Both airlines are subsidiaries of Anglo-Spanish multinational airline holding company International Airlines Group, formed in January 2011 after a merger agreement between British Airways and Iberia, the flag carrier airlines of the United Kingdom and Spain respectively.\n\nAbout LEVEL\n\nLEVEL is International Airlines Group’s (IAG) low cost long-haul airline brand that took to the skies in June 2017. It is operating two A330-200 aircraft from Barcelona to San Francisco (Oakland), Buenos Aires and Boston from March 2018, with a summer service to Los Angeles. In addition, a third A330-200 will be added to the Barcelona fleet later in the summer. As of July 2, 2018, LEVEL will start operations from Paris Orly, where two A330-200 will be based for flights to Montreal, New York (Newark), Guadeloupe and Martinique.
