        "text": "British Airways parent International Airlines Group has made a takeover bid for the Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling.\n\nIAG already controls almost 46% of Veuling's shares via its Spanish subsidiary Iberia, and has offered to purchase the rest on the Spanish stock markets for €113m.\n\nIAG chief executive, Willie Walsh, said: \"With its leading position in Barcelona, European growth strategy and low cost base, Vueling has much to offer IAG. It has significantly increased capacity while remaining profitable, despite the Spanish economic slowdown, and already has extensive commercial arrangements with Iberia. We would plan to retain the current Vueling management team.\n\n\"This would be good news for Vueling as there are many advantages for the airline in this deal. It will benefit from the financial strength of a larger airline group, making it better able to compete with other airlines and invest in new customer products and services. The airline will also be able to generate some cost and revenue synergies as part of IAG mainly through joint financing and procurement.\n\nIAG said that if the offer to shareholders is accepted, the deal could go through in spring 2013. Vueling would be managed as a separate operating company with its chief executive reporting directly to Walsh.\n\nWalsh's attempts to force through cost-cutting measures at the heavily loss-making Iberia, including the creation of a low-cost, short-haul subsidiary in Iberia Express, have struggled in the face of industrial disputes. Analysts said that Vueling would give IAG options while it battles to impose new conditions on its Spanish pilots.\n\nGerald Khoo of Espirito Santo said: \"Management has been working on contingency plans, based on restructuring options previously considered but discarded in favour of Iberia Express. One such alternative would have involved the use of Vueling to provide short haul feeder traffic for Iberia's long haul network, taking advantage of its much more competitive cost base. [A takeover] would seem to offer a way of continuing the restructuring of Iberia's short haul operations while sidestepping the question of how the arbitration process relating to Iberia Express will move forward.\"\n\nBut he warned: \"The track record of the strategy of creating in-house low cost airlines within legacy or network carrier groups is mixed at best.\"\n\nOthers were sceptical of the benefits. One industry source said: \"Vueling is an attractive asset – but how does this deal make things better for Vueling? BA has the reverse Midas touch in taking over airlines. This is diverting attention from the real issue – the problems IAG is having with the fundamental restructuring of Iberia.\""
