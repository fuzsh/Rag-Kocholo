        "text": "International Airlines Group (IAG), owner of Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia has again withdrawn from its takeover bid of €400m for Spanish airline Air Europa. It is the second time it has done so.\n\nIAG already owns 20% of Air Europa, with the remaining 80% belonging to Globalia, a Spanish tour operator.\n\nClose advertising\n\nLuis Gallego, chief executive officer (CEO) of IAG said: \"We believe this decision is in the best interests of our shareholders. IAG remains committed to its strategy, including competing effectively from its Madrid hub.\n\n\"This is a strategy which is delivering strong results. We will continue to develop our presence in Madrid, so that the hub can develop as a rival to Europe's largest hub airports.\"\n\nThis move to let go of the bid comes following regulators threatening to obstruct the acquisition, with the group's previous takeover attempt back in 2021 also stopped by the European Commission.\n\nThis is primarily because of concerns that this takeover could prove to be anti-competitive, and harmful to travellers, as it would mean that Madrid's key international airport would be controlled mostly by IAG group airlines, namely Iberia and Air Europa.\n\nCurrently Air Europa and Iberia are two of the main Spanish airlines, also responsible for the key routes to the rest of Europe, as well as North and Latin America.\n\nIAG will now be compelled to pay a €50m break fee to Globalia, as compensation for not pursuing the takeover anymore. This fee was also previously levied on the takeover abandonment in 2021. No further concessions on offer\n\nAlthough IAG has attempted to provide a concessions package including landing and take-off slots to competitors, this has not succeeded in calming regulator concerns. However, IAG has revealed that it is not willing to offer more concessions in order to make the takeover happen.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Commission's (EC) executive vice-president in charge of competition policy said on the EC website: \"We looked closely at the impact of the transaction on competition, especially on those routes in which alternative flights are limited.\"Our in-depth analysis indicated that the merger would have negatively affected competition on a large number of domestic short-haul and long-routes within, to and from Spain on which the two airlines compete closely.\n\n\"We were concerned that the transaction may have led to adverse effects for passengers - business customers and consumers alike - in terms of increased prices or decreased quality of services. IAG offered remedies, but taking into account the results of the market test, the remedies submitted did not fully address our competition concerns\n\nBritish Airways' owner puts brakes on Air Europa takeover bid\n\nIAG had offered a series of concessions to the EU regulators, including giving up take-off and landing slots to competitors but the regulators still saw the bid as potentially anti-competitive.\n\nThis means Air Europa will remain a Skyteam member. TAP Portugal is currently up for privatisation and IAG has expressed interested in them meaning they may go for TAP after dropping Air Europa.\n\nI don't see how it would have been a good thing for them, it would have been a direct self-competition with Iberia. Unless they would have a clear separation, which I don't see, as Air Europa and Iberia sensibly serve the same markets.\n\nThere's overlap, but I wouldn't say that they're chasing the same business. Air Europa seems to be more focused on the leisure market. If the acquisition had completed I think that IAG would have tried to push the lower-yield Iberia customers to AE and the premium traffic to IB.\n\nThat said, I'm glad that it hasn't completed as I'm also a SkyTeam-first traveller so this keeps more options open for me."
