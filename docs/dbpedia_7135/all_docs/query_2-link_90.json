        "text": "Can’t remember the exact source (apologies), but I recently read that the BA arm in particular is currently very short of pilots.\n\nSome routes are having frequency reduced and its also being forced to wet lease multiple aircraft to maintain others which has a significant cost, especially when a chunk of your own fleet is stuck on the ground as a consequence, which is the last thing any airline wants. Not a great situation to be in when heading into the busiest travel period for 3 years…\n\nIts not just pilots - but ground staff, call centre, support staff, cabin crew etc - the number of staff they are short run into the thousands.\n\nThe wet-leases are to try and keep services running - either from airlines within the same group (Iberia and Vueling at Gatwick), or Finnair and Iberia at Heathrow. There are 20+ planes sitting on the ground in Madrid not doing anything, as they don’t have the staff to operate them!!\n\nAs recently communicated to holders, International Airlines Group (IAG) has been removed from the app due to technical reasons relating to overseas taxation.\n\nIf you are a holder, you can still sell this stock, but you won’t be able to buy more and it won’t be available in the Discover tab.\n\nApologies for the inconvenience.\n\nWill it be back in the future. Now i have to go find another app to invest in iag… What exactly are these technical issues if so do other brokers have the same issue…\n\nAre there really technical issues? It’s ultimately a Spanish stock and much like Banco Santander (£BNC) there is usually tax to be paid to the Spanish authorities, if sold for profit*\n\n*I am not a financial nor tax adviser, if unsure on tax affairs ease seek a suitably qualified professional.\n\nSome further reading can be found at www.spanishtaxforms.co.uk\n\nThis usually would affect the person who bought the shares, I’d struggle to see how freetrade is affected directly by this."
