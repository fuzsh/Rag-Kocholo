        "text": "Information for shareholders\n\nIAG shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange and on the stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia, through the Spanish Stock Exchanges Interconnection System (Mercado Continuo Espa√±ol).\n\nIAG shares traded on the London Stock Exchange are held electronically as share entitlements. These are in the form of Crest Depository Interests (CDIs). The CDI holder is the beneficial owner of the shares.\n\nIAG has partnered with Computershare to administer the electronic share register through the Corporate Sponsored Nominee service with no cost to the shareholder. As IAG is a Spanish company, holding shares this way allows shareholders to continue to have the beneficial entitlement of their holding. This not only gives them the ability to trade shares in IAG but gives them the same entitlements as a direct shareholding, such as voting rights and attendance at shareholder meetings.\n\nIn addition, IAG has a Sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) facility that trades on the OTC market in the US (see www.otcmarkets.com). Deutsche Bank is the ADR depositary bank.\n\nContact us\n\nFor enquiries relating to institutional investors please contact the Investor Relations team:\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nFor enquiries relating to individual shareholders:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nPlease contact Computershare for all matters relating to a UK shareholding.
