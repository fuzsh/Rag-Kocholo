Once you have an account, you will be able to log in and fill out the necessary information. The next step is to select the position that you are applying for. After you have selected the position, you will be asked to fill out your personal information, such as your name, address, and contact information.\n\nThe last step in filling out an online application for an international airline group is to upload your resume.\n\nOnce your application has been received, you may be invited to take some online aptitude tests.\n\nIAG Aptitude Tests\n\nOnline aptitude tests have become a popular way for airlines like IAG to identify a candidate's skills and abilities.\n\nWhile online aptitude tests are a great way to show off your skills, there are a few things to keep in mind before taking one.\n\nFirst, make sure you understand the instructions and format of the test. Second, take some time to practice beforehand so you can get comfortable with the types of questions that will be asked. Finally, don't stress if you don't get every question right â€“ just do your best and focus on demonstrating your knowledge and abilities.\n\nIt's important to practice the tests beforehand to get some practice in beforehand and improve your score.\n\nBelow are some of the assessments you might be expected to take (job-specific).\n\nIAG Situational Judgment Test\n\nA situational judgment test (SJT) is a type of aptitude test that is used to evaluate an individual's ability to make decisions in different situations. The test usually consists of a series of scenarios that the test-taker must read and then answer questions about.\n\nThe test has been found to be a reliable predictor of job performance and has been shown to be valid for a variety of different jobs within the airline industry.\n\nIAG Numerical Reasoning Test\n\nA numerical reasoning test is an aptitude test that IAG uses to evaluate a job candidate's ability to understand and work with numbers. The test format varies, but generally includes questions that require the job candidate to interpret data presented in graphs and tables. Some tests also include word problems.\n\nThe questions on a Numerical Reasoning test are designed to assess the job candidate's critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\nJobs that involve financial analysis, budgeting, or working with statistical data all require strong numerical reasoning skills.\n\nIAG Personality Assessment\n\nA personality assessment is a type of psychological test that measures an individual's personal characteristics, such as temperament, motivation, and interests. The results of a personality assessment can provide insight into an individual's strengths and weaknesses, as well as give clues about how that person may respond to certain situations.\n\nPersonality assessments come in many different formats, but most often they involve answering questions about oneself or completing tasks that reveal how one thinks or behaves. There is no right or wrong way to answer the questions on a personality assessment; the goal is simply, to be honest, and provide accurate information about yourself.\n\nPersonality assessments can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying people who are likely to be successful in a certain job or predicting how someone will react in a particular situation.\n\nIAG Diagrammatic Reasoning Test\n\nA diagrammatic reasoning test is a type of assessment that requires the ability to see relationships between shapes and symbols. The test may be presented in either a verbal or nonverbal format. In an airline setting, the test is usually given as part of the selection process for pilots and air traffic controllers.\n\nIAG Assessment Center\n\nUpon successful completion of your online assessments, you may be invited to an assessment center which is the final phase of the process.\n\nAn assessment center is a common selection method used by IAG to identify the most qualified candidates for a job.\n\nThe assessment consists of 3 key stages:\n\nGroup exercise\n\nPresentation\n\nInterview\n\nThe exercises used in an assessment center vary depending on the position being evaluated. Assessment centers can last anywhere from half a day to several days, depending on the number of exercises involved.\n\nIAG Group Exercise\n\nA group exercise is a commonly used assessment center format. It assesses a range of skills and qualities such as teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and leadership.\n\nGroup exercises usually involve a task that the candidates have to complete as a team. The task could be anything from planning an event to building a structure out of Lego. The assessors will be looking at how well the candidates work together as a team, as well as their individual contributions to the task.\n\nAfter the group exercise has been completed, the assessors will debrief the candidates and give them feedback on their performance. This is an important part of the assessment process, as it allows candidates to reflect on their own performance and learn from their mistakes.\n\nIAG Presentation\n\nA presentation at an assessment center is usually a formal affair. This means that you will need to prepare and practice your presentation in advance. The format of the presentation will vary, but it is usually around 20 minutes long with 10 minutes for questions.\n\nThe purpose of the presentation is to assess your ability to communicate effectively. The assessors will be looking at how well you structure your argument, how confidently you speak, and how well you handle questions from the audience.\n\nTo give yourself the best chance of success, make sure you understand the format of the presentation and practice delivering it several times before the assessment center.\n\nIAG Interview\n\nThe final stage of the assessment center is the interview. This is a face-to-face meeting between the interviewer and the interviewee.\n\nThere are different types of interviews, but the most common is the behavioral interview. This type of interview assesses whether the candidate has the required skills and behaviors for the job.\n\nIt is recommended that you use the STAR method to answer behavioral style questions (situation, task, action, response)."
