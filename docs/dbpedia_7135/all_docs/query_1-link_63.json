        "text": "International Airlines Group (IAG) has reached an agreement with the multi-energy company Repsol for the purchase and supply during the next six months of more than 28,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).\n\nThe SAF provided by Repsol will be used by the IAG airlines flying from Spanish airports, including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Iberia Express and Vueling.\n\nThis agreement represents the largest voluntary purchase of SAF made to date in Spain. With this supply IAG advances in its commitment to the decarbonisation of its activity, getting the Group closer to the use of 2% of SAF in 2025 as established by the ReFuel EU regulation.\n\nSAF allows an emissions reduction of more than 80% compared to traditional jet fuel in terms of net CO2 life cycle emissions, from production to consumption. IAG, as with all its SAF purchases, ensures that the SAF purchased complies with strict sustainability certification standards.\n\nThis year Repsol has begun to produce 100% renewable fuels at its facilities in Cartagena. The plant, the first large-scale plant in Spain and Portugal dedicated exclusively to the production of 100% renewable fuels and in which Repsol has invested €250 million, has a production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per year and can produce renewable diesel and SAF from waste.\n\nLuis Gallego, CEO of IAG, said that: “Sustainability is a priority for IAG and is one of the pillars on which we base our strategy and transformation. We are working intensely to secure our future SAF needs and comply with our commitments, which are more ambitious than what is established by EU legislation. However, it is important that governments continue to support the development of a SAF industry that increases its availability and reduces its price.”\n\nJosu Jon Imaz, CEO of Repsol, added: “This agreement with IAG, one of the largest airline groups in the world, consolidates our commitment to 100% renewable fuels as a key lever for the decarbonization of transport in Spain. The aviation sector needs solutions such as sustainable aviation fuels and, at Repsol, we are prepared to supply them through our 100% renewable fuels plant in Cartagena.”"
