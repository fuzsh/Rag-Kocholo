        "text": "IAG makes Spain’s largest-ever purchase of SAF from Repsol\n\nCARTAGENA, July 31, 2024 – International Airlines Group (IAG) has agreed to purchase more than 28,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from Repsol, the Spanish company announced on Monday.\n\nIAG is the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, LEVEL, IAG Loyalty and IAG Cargo.\n\nThe company targets a 10% share of SAF in its fuel by 2030 as part of its decarbonisation goals and as of end-2023 had invested USD 1 billion in the fuel.\n\nRepsol will supply the SAF to IAG airlines flying from Spanish airports.\n\nThe 28,000-tonne deal represents the largest-ever voluntary purchase of SAF in Spain. The value of the deal was not disclosed.\n\n“This agreement with IAG, one of the largest airline groups in the world, consolidates our commitment to 100% renewable fuels as a key lever for the decarbonization of transport in Spain,” Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.\n\n“The aviation sector needs solutions such as sustainable aviation fuels and, at Repsol, we are prepared to supply them through our 100% renewable fuels plant in Cartagena.”\n\nRepsol, a leader in Spain’s sustainable fuels sector, noted that SAF allows an emissions reduction of more than 80% compared to traditional jet fuel in terms of net CO2 lifecycle emissions."
