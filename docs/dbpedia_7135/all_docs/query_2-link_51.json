Upon completing the three-year journey, you will earn a diploma in the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, earning the MCIPS qualification.\n\nDuring the programme, you will enjoy on-the-job learning and responsibility through a series of year-long placements. You will start the graduate scheme with an induction week which will develop your understanding of the organisation and the airline industry and meeting our management committee. During your placements, there will be opportunities to reflect on your strengths, individual needs and career pathways to prepare yourself for a career in procurement.\n\n*We are accepting application by end of November."
