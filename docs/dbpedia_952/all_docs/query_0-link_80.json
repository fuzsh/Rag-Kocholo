        "text": "​\n\nPeter Kieffer\n\nPhoto: Jean Siirila\n\n​\n\nPeter Kieffer, 68, passed away Tuesday, April 28th, 2009, due to injuries sustained at his shop.\n\nPeter was born on October 25th, 1940 in Fargo, ND to Claire and Eugene Kieffer. As a child he was always building, including soapbox derby cars, though he was too young to enter the contests. He also built working rockets which he demonstrated to college students from ‘the AC’, now known as NDSU. After graduating from Lincoln High School in Casselton, he went to work with his Uncle Sylvester’s earth moving company. In his early twenties, he built the Blue Ox, which won many tractor pulling contests. It was one of the most talked about tractors in the area. In his later twenties, he built the 4E-14 elevating scraper.\n\nOn January 18th, 1969 he married Joan Davis, originally from Flint, Michigan. Shortly thereafter, he started farming full-time in the Casselton area. In 1972 he built a 5 bedroom home for his growing family. Over the years, he designed and built cars, airplanes, and a wide variety of farm equipment. He was known for solving problems and doing things that most thought were impossible. He was also well-known for his ability to remember everyone he met. He learned the genealogy of his family and made a point to know who everyone was and to whom they were related.\n\nHe was a life-time member of the Western Minnesota Steam Threshers’ Reunion. He was president for four years and led many projects throughout the years, including the Pabst Engine, and the Prony Brake, amongst many others. He was appreciated for his ability to solve problems while keeping the peace. After Ray and Annie Shoberg retired, Peter took over responsibility for the commemorative plates sold each year at WMSTR.\n\nHe was proud to join his wife for a season of acting with the Silver Follies last year in the production of Little Abner.\n\nPeter's greatest joy was his family. He was a self-taught philosopher, an educator, and a student. He passed his thirst for knowledge on to his 5 children and shared his passion for learning with everyone he met. He was always open to change, welcoming to all, and willing to talk to anyone.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents Eugene and Claire Kieffer, Sisters Bernadette and Charlene, Brother Donald, and stepmother Geri Tehrfer Kieffer.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 40 years, Joan; Daughter Jane (David) and their children, Peter, Claire, Cory, and Sebastien Rath; Daughter Ann and her sons Henri and Johann Kieffer; Son Roy (Sarah) and their daughter Elizabeth; Son Joseph (Craig) Kieffer; Son Thomas (Kate) Kieffer; Sister Bonnie (Harvey) Fiala; Brother-in-law Marvin Fyten; Sister-in-law Dorothy Haugland; Brother James (Arlene) Kieffer; Brother Leo (Alexia) Kieffer; Brother Ralph (Phyllis) Kieffer; Brother Harold (Kathy) Kieffer; Sister Lillian (Michael) Eberhardt; Brother John Kieffer; Sister Marilyn (Gerald) Barnes and many beloved nieces and nephews.\n\nHe is available to us all through prayer.\n\nMatthew 16: 18 - 19 And Jesus replied, “ Simon, son of John, I call you Peter. And on this Rock I will build my Church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.”\n\nThe name Peter comes from the Greek word petra that means rock. Our friend Peter Kieffer lived that name. Peter was a rock that I knew I could count on. I knew that I could call in a time of emergency or crisis and he would be there, no matter what time of day or night.\n\nIn some of the lowest times of my life, Peter was there and allowed me to lean on him. In some of our struggles, Jane and I leaned on both Peter and Joan. Because he was a ‘Rock’, I/we could lean very hard.\n\nI never had to wonder if Peter was there. I simply knew that he was there. The task could be a mundane as repairing a broken piece of equipment, or it could be getting some help in trying to figure out how to create some piece of equipment for a specific job. The welder and the torch were always available, and the coffee was always on.\n\nBuilding the Red Prony Brake was one of several Rollag projects I worked on with Peter. Then, a few years later with his help, the Blue Brake was built. The Red Brake has not moved from Rollag, but the Blue Brake has traveled to several shows. People like Amos Rixman, Charlie Kvern, Jim Todahl, Jonathon Haux, Bill McCreery, Larry Jacobson and I are often seen running the Brake and talking to the crowd. A person often had to look to see Peter, because he wasn’t ‘on the stage’ with us. I didn’t have to look, I knew he was there. I knew if a danger that I didn’t see arose, it would be brought to our attention, or he would simply take care of it. I knew if help was needed, he was there. In these cases, the ‘Rock’ was there.\n\nPeter, thank you for being a Rock for us. Godspeed home.\n\nPeters funeral was a tough one for us all. I am sure we all have different reasons as to why. He touched us all in different ways.\n\nWhile I would not consider him a \"close personal friend\" as many who visit these pages might he was a good friend none the less. I came to know him well about the second year he was President of WMSTR. He was the first person to ever suggest I take my interest in WMSTR a little bit further, and get more involved with the operation of the show. I can still remember that conversation.\n\nI also saw the man at work dealing with some very tense issues that came up both during the summer and during the show. He could bring two people at opposite ends of an issue together and have them (if not in agreement) at least amicable by the end of the day. It was his gift.\n\nWe talked a lot during the summer months on the hill. He would sometimes make some of the strangest comments, and then I would look at him and see a little \"smirk\" and know that he was pulling my chain a little. I was reminded of his habit of doing that during the Padre's sermon at the funeral.\n\nHe was a very special person, and one whom I will miss a great deal. There have been others (from our group) before him who have gone on to their reward way too soon, and unfortunately there will probably be more, but Peter is one I am a better man for getting to know. I will miss him, and judging from the number of people who came to pay their respects on Sunday night and Monday at the funeral, I will not be alone."
