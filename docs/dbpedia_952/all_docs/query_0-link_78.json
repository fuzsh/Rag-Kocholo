I remeber babysitting him when I was around 8 or 9 years old. It was always a treat to see Jason and Jenny for one of my many times babaysitting for you. We always had such fun times during those days. I couldn't beleive how he was going to college and studying on COPD and other lung problems and how my dad (Tom Foster) wanted him to find a cure so no one else would have to have such a horrible thing. When I heard the news, I didn't know what to say but that I am so sorry for the loss of Jason. I wish I was there to help comfort all of you, like you were here for me when my dad passed 5 years ago.

He took a lot of nickels, dimes, and quarters off me in poker. I'll never forget the time he was over for a social gathering and I introduced him to his own cousin. May he celebrate with all the angels and saints in God's presence. And for those of us who miss him and his loving family may God grant us peace until we are reunited.;\n\nPosted by:\n\nFrank and Vanessa Cossetta\n\nThe Kieffer Family-I just want to let you know how very saddened I am to hear about the passing of Jason.
