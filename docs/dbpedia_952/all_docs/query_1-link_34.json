        "text": "More than 1,000 former, incoming or current NCAA student-athletes will be in Paris this summer for the 2024 Olympic Games in the goal of winning medals.\n\nThey represent more than 100 countries, with almost 400 competing for Team USA. Throughout these Olympics, which run Friday, July 26 through Sunday, Aug. 11, we'll be following all student-athlete medal winners. Note that all medal winners will be listed individually (instead of just the team if it's a team event). You can see how athletes did at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out the full list of all 1,000-plus NCAA student-athletes at this year's Olympics.\n\nUpdated through 9 a.m. ET on Saturday, Aug. 10\n\nGold medal\n\nATHLETE SCHOOL COUNTRY EVENT Vivian Kong Stanford Hong Kong Fencing Women's Individual Epee Jack Alexy California
