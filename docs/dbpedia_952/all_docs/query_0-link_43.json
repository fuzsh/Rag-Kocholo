Austin Miles\n\nI come to the garden alone,\n\nWhile the dew is still on the roses,\n\nAnd the voice I hear,\n\nFalling on my ear,\n\nThe Son of God discloses.\n\nHe speaks, and the sound of His voice\n\nIs so sweet the birds hush their singing,\n\nAnd the melody\n\nThat He gave to me,\n\nWithin my heart is ringing.\n\nI’d stay in the garden with Him\n\nTho’ the night around me be falling,\n\nBut He bids me go;\n\nThro’ the voice of woe\n\nHis voice to me is calling.\n\nCHORUS\n\nAnd He walks with me,\n\nAnd He talks with me,\n\nAnd He tells me I am His own;\n\nAnd the joy we share as we tarry there,\n\nNone other has ever known.\n\n“May God touch you\n\nwith His healing hand\n\nand give you the peace and comfort\n\nyou need to get through.”\n\nAnon."
