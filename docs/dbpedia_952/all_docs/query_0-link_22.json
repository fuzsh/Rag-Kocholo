Their passion for these projects took them to Florida, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Missouri, where their final restoration was the Kipp farmhouse at Stover.\n\nLeo was a member of the First Christian Church in Versailles and the Himmel Lutheran Church in Dornsife.\n\nIn addition to his wife, he is survived by two children, Dale Leo (Margie) Kieffer of Melbourne, Florida and Carol Richards of Cincinnati, Ohio; six step children, Garry (Donna) Rodgers and Larry Rodgers of Melbourne; Kathy (Cliff) Jones of Daytona Beach, Florida; Pamela (companion Pat) Rodgers of Lakeland, Florida; Joseph Rodgers, Mountain Home, Idaho and Brenda (Dick) Hudson, Colbert, Georgia; twelve grandchildren and thirteen great grandchildren.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his wife Evelyn, four brothers, Clarence, Lloyd, Paul and Melvin Kieffer and one sister, Gertie Zartman.\n\nThe family will receive friends from 12:30 p.m. until 2:30 p.m. Thursday, October 18, at the Scrivner-Morrow Funeral Home in Stover. Funeral services will begin at 2:30 p.m. with Rev. John Wagner officiating. In keeping with his wishes, cremation will follow the funeral service.
