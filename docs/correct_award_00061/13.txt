Erik Axel Karlfeldt (November 20, 1864 - April 8, 1931) was a Swedish poet whose essentially regional, tradition-bound poetry was extremely popular and won him the Nobel Prize in Literature posthumously in 1931; he had refused it in 1918.

In 1904 Karlfeldt was elected a member of the Swedish Academy and held chair number 11. In 1912 he was elected permanent secretary of the Academy, a position he held until his death.

The Uppsala University, Karlfeldt's alma mater, awarded him the title of Doctor honoris causa in 1917.
