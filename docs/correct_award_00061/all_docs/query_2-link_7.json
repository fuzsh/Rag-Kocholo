        "text": "(1864–1931). The popular Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt wrote regional, tradition-bound verse influenced by the peasant culture of his rural homeland. He refused the Nobel prize for literature in 1918, but he was awarded the honor posthumously in 1931.\n\nKarlfeldt was born on July 20, 1864, in Folkärna, in the Dalecarlia (Dalarna) region of Sweden. His strong ties to the area remained a dominant influence on him all his life. He published his most important works in six volumes of verse: Vildmarks-och kärleksvisor (1895; Songs of Wilderness and of Love), Fridolins visor (1898; Fridolin’s Songs), Fridolins lustgård (1901; Fridolin’s Pleasure Garden), Flora och Pomona (1906), Flora och Bellona (1918), and finally, four years before his death, Hösthorn (1927; The Horn of Autumn). Some of his poems have been published in English translation in Arcadia Borealis: Selected Poems of Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1938). In time, even some of his admirers criticized him for using his gifts so exclusively in the service of a dying culture.\n\nKarlfeldt was a member and secretary of the Swedish Academy from 1904 to 1931. He died on April 8, 1931, in Stockholm."
