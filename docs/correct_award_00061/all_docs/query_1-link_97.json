        "text": "— A pioneering researcher was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday, three days after dying of pancreatic cancer without ever knowing he was about to be honored for his immune system work that he had used to try to prolong his own life.\n\nThe Nobel Committee of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, which selects the winners, said it was unaware that Canadian-born cell biologist Ralph Steinman had already died when it awarded the prize to him, American Bruce Beutler and French scientist Jules Hoffmann.\n\nSince the committee is only supposed to consider living scientists, the Nobel Foundation held an emergency meeting Monday and said the decision on the $1.5 million prize will remain unchanged.\n\n“The events that have occurred are unique, and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize,” the foundation said Monday in a statement on its website. “The decision to award the Nobel Prize to Ralph Steinman was made in good faith based on the assumption that the Nobel Laureate was alive.”\n\nSteinman, 68, died Friday, according to Rockefeller University in New York. He underwent therapy based on his discovery of the immune system’s dendritic cells, for which he won the prize, the university said.\n\n“He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four years ago, and his life was extended using a dendritic-cell based immunotherapy of his own design,” the university said.\n\nSteinman was the only patient in a trial of the experimental therapy, and was treated at the university, said Joseph Bonner, a spokesman for the university.\n\nThe university, which has close ties with the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm that selects the Nobel prize winner in medicine, did not know of Steinman’s death until Monday morning, Bonner said.\n\nThe president of Rockefeller, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, immediately called the chairman of the Nobel prize committee to inform him.\n\nSteinman was awarded one-half the prize. The other half went to Beutler of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and Hoffmann of France.\n\nBeutler and Hoffmann were cited for their discoveries in the 1990s of receptor proteins that can recognize bacteria and other microorganisms as they enter the body, and activate the first line of defense in the immune system, known as innate immunity.\n\nNobel committee members said the work by the three is being used to develop better vaccines, and in the long run could also help treatment of diseases linked to abnormalities in the immune system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe work could also help efforts to make the immune system fight cancer, the committee said. A new treatment, Provenge, uses this concept to attack advanced prostate cancer.\n\nNobel committee member Goran Hansson said hoped-for vaccines are in the pipeline.\n\n“I am very touched. I’m thinking of all the people who worked with me, who gave everything,” Hoffmann said by telephone from Shanghai during a news conference in Paris. “I wasn’t sure this domain merited a Nobel.”\n\nHoffman, whose mobile phone wasn’t working Monday, said he found out about the prize from front desk staff at his Shanghai hotel, who contacted him after being flooded with calls from reporters.\n\nBeutler said he woke up in the middle of the night, glanced at his cell phone and realized he had a new e-mail message.\n\n“And I squinted at it and I saw that the title line was ‘Nobel Prize,’ so I thought I should give close attention to that,” Beutler said in an interview posted on the Nobel website. “And, I opened it and it was from Goran Hansson, and it said that I had won the Nobel Prize, and so I was thrilled.”\n\nStill, he was a “little disbelieving” until he checked his laptop, “and in a few minutes I saw my name there and so I knew it was real.”\n\nSince 1974, the Nobel statutes don’t allow posthumous awards unless a laureate dies after the announcement but before the Dec. 10 award ceremony. That happened in 1996 when economics winner William Vickrey died a few days after the announcement.\n\nBefore the statutes were changed in 1974 two Nobel Prizes were given posthumously. In 1961, U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize less than a month after he died in a plane crash during a peace mission to Congo. Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt won the Nobel in literature in 1931, although he had died in March of that year.\n\n“The Nobel Foundation thus believes that what has occurred is more reminiscent of the example in the statutes concerning a person who has been named as a Nobel Laureate and has died before the actual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony,” the foundation said after its meeting.\n\nNobel officials said the situation was unprecedented, and that Steinman’s survivors would receive his share of the prize money. It wasn’t immediately clear who would represent him at the ceremony in Stockholm.\n\nNobel Foundation chairman Lars Heikensten, who started his job in June, said he was stunned when he found out that Steinman was dead.\n\n“My first thought was: ‘Wow, this is a remarkable thing to happen now that I’m involved in this for the first time. How do we handle this now?”’ he said.\n\nHansson said the medicine committee didn’t know Steinman was dead when it chose him.\n\n“It is incredibly sad news,” he said. “We can only regret that he didn’t have the chance to receive the news he had won the Nobel Prize. Our thoughts are now with his family.”\n\nBeutler, 53, holds dual appointments at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and as professor of genetics and immunology at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. He will become a full-time faculty member at UT Southwestern on Dec. 1.\n\nHoffmann, 70, headed a research laboratory in Strasbourg, France, between 1974 and 2009 and served as president of the French National Academy of Sciences between 2007-08.\n\nBorn in Montreal in 1943, Steinman studied medicine at Harvard University and received his medical doctorate in 1968. He worked at Rockefeller University for most of his career and had been head of the university’s Center for Immunology and Immune Diseases.\n\n“We are all so touched that our father’s many years of hard work are being recognized with a Nobel Prize,” Steinman’s daughter, Alexis Steinman, said in the Rockefeller University statement. “He devoted his life to his work and his family, and he would be truly honored.”\n\nHoffmann’s discovery came in 1996 during research on how fruit flies fight infections. Two years later, Beutler’s research on mice showed that fruit flies and mammals activate innate immunity in similar ways when attacked by germs.\n\nSteinman’s discovery dates back to 1973, when he found a new cell type, the dendritic cell, which has a unique capacity to activate T-cells. Those cells have a key role in adaptive immunity, when antibodies and killer cells fight infections. They also develop a memory that helps the immune system mobilize its defenses next time it comes under a similar attack.\n\nThe medicine award kicked off a week of Nobel Prize announcements, and will be followed by the physics prize today, chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday and the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The winners of the economics award will be announced on Monday.\n\nThe coveted prizes were established by wealthy Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel — the inventor of dynamite — except for the economics award, which was created by Sweden’s central bank in 1968 in Nobel’s memory. The prizes are always handed out on Dec. 10, on the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nLast year’s medicine award went to British professor Robert Edwards for fertility research that led to the first test tube baby.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Karl Ritter, Louise Nordstrom and Malin Rising of The Associated Press; by Janina Pfalzer, Meg Tirrell, Naomi Kresge, Reg Gale and Albertina Torsoli of Bloomberg News; and by The New York Times."
