        "text": "On April 12, 1888, Alfred Nobel’s older brother Ludvig died in Cannes, France.\n\nBut newspaper Le Figaro mixed up the brothers and announced Alfred’s death on its front page under a rather inflammatory headline: “A man who can hardly be called a benefactor of humanity died yesterday in Cannes. He is Nobel, inventor of dynamite”.\n\nMany credit this slight as the inspiration for Nobel’s creation of the prizes, pointing to the wording in his will that the awards should go to those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” but this was never confirmed by Nobel.\n\nAs for the visitors who came to offer their condolences at the inventor’s mansion in Paris, they were surprised to be greeted by a very much alive Alfred, as reported by Le Figaro the following day.\n\n5 times Nobel Prize winners caused controversy\n\nIn Nobel’s will, the rewards were to go to those who had served humanity “during the preceding year”. However, from the awards’ inception in 1901 and onwards, this has rarely been essential.\n\nIt often takes time for the true impact of discoveries to become known, and the number of worthy recipients is growing. As a result, work that is several decades old is often rewarded.\n\nIn 2019, John Goodenough became the oldest person to win a Nobel Prize, at the age of 97. He is now the oldest living Nobel laureate, at 99. The youngest was Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 at 17.\n\nSince 1974, the rules of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that the award may not be given posthumously – after someone has died. But a person may still be awarded the honour if she or he dies between the time of the announcement in October and the formal prize ceremony in December.\n\nBefore the change, only two people had won a Nobel posthumously.\n\nOne was Dag Hammarskjold, the Swedish secretary general of the United Nations who died in a plane crash in 1961 but was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize later the same year.\n\nYouth activists call for government action on climate change\n\nAnd in 1931, the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously to another Swede, Erik Axel Karlfeldt.\n\nIn 2011, the medicine prize committee selected Ralph Steinman of Canada, unaware that he had passed away just three days before the honour’s announcement.\n\nThe foundation decided to nevertheless give him the prize.\n\nFrom Adolf Hitler to Michael Jackson, Joseph Stalin to Benito Mussolini, the Nobel Peace Prize has seen its share of improbable, far-fetched or eyebrow-raising candidates in its 120-year existence.\n\nHitler was nominated for the peace prize by a Swedish MP in January 1939, on the brink of the bloodiest conflict in history – although the proposal was made sarcastically and later withdrawn.\n\nSerbian President Slobodan Milosevic, later tried for genocide, was also nominated, as was Jules Rimet, the “father” of the football World Cup.\n\n#throwback to that time we spoke to Greta Thunberg\n\nWhile their representation among winners has been steadily increasing in the last few decades, women still account for only about six per cent of winners.\n\nSince 2001, 28 women have been awarded prizes, almost three times as many as in the previous two decades.\n\nIn 2009, five women received a Nobel prize, including the first female winner in economics, American Elinor Ostrom, setting a record for the most female winners in one year.\n\n“Nobel would have been annoyed by this statistic,” Ingrid Carlberg, Nobel’s biographer, said.\n\n“He was a feminist before his time, who defended women’s careers and admired female intellectuals.”\n\nYoung people can make real changes with grassroots action\n\nEconomics has had the fewest female winners at 2.3 per cent, lower than the science prizes combined, which have seen 3.7 per cent women.\n\nWhile slightly more evenly distributed, literature is still largely a male affair, with 13.7 women among laureates, with the peace prize faring slightly better at 15.9 per cent.\n\nNevertheless, the first person to win the Nobel prize twice was Marie Curie, in 1903 in physics and in 1911 in chemistry."
