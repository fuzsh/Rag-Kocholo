        "text": "Award\n\n1931 Nobel Prize in LiteratureErik Axel KarlfeldtDate\n\n8 October 1931 (announcement)\n\n10 December 1931\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1930 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1932 →\n\nThe 1931 Nobel Prize in Literature was posthumously awarded to the Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864–1931) with the citation: \"The poetry of Erik Axel Karlfeldt.\"[1] He was the third Swede to win the prize and remains the only recipient to be posthumously awarded.[1] Karlfeldt had been offered the award already in 1919 but refused to accept it, because of his position as permanent secretary to the Swedish Academy (1913–1931), which awards the prize.[2]\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: Erik Axel Karlfeldt\n\nKarlfeldt's poetry is strongly influenced by the customs and environment of his childhood. But the area started to mirror the universal by becoming more and more of a microcosm. His art is primarily wild in character, marked by austerity and an antipathy to egotism. His alter ego, Fridolin, frequently appears in his poetry to convey his humor, sadness, longings, and mood. His poetry exhibits a superb command of words. Karlfeldt explored the potential offered by his imagination and poetry as an artistic medium, even though he had a strong bond with his home country and its customs.[3][4]\n\nDeliberations[edit]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nKarlfeldt was nominated in 10 different occasions starting in 1916. In 1931, he received a single nomination from the 1930 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nathan Söderblom, also a member of the Swedish Academy, with which he was awarded posthumously afterwards.[5]\n\nIn total, the Nobel committee received 49 nominations for 29 writers. Ten of the nominees are nominated first-time among them Hermann Hesse (awarded in 1946), Francis Jammes, Ole Edvart Rølvaag, Erich Maria Remarque, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, and Ramón Menéndez Pidal. The highest number of nominations were for the Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal with 8 nominations followed by Concha Espina de la Serna with 6 nominations. Three of the nominees were women namely Concha Espina de la Serna, Laura Mestre Hevia, and Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić.[6]\n\nThe authors Arnold Bennett, Hjalmar Bergman, Rachel Bluwstein, Hall Caine, Enrico Corradini, Ernst Didring, Max Elskamp, Khalil Gibran, Frank Harris, Mary St. Leger Kingsley (known as Lucas Malet), Vachel Lindsay, George Herbert Mead, John Gambril Nicholson, Arthur Schnitzler, Hara Prasad Shastri, John Lawson Stoddard, Milan Šufflay, Ida B. Wells, Xu Zhimo, and Ieronim Yasinsky died in 1931 without having been nominated for the prize. Norwegian-American author Ole Edvart Rølvaag died weeks before the announcement.[relevant?]\n\nOfficial list of nominees and their nominators for the prize No. Nominee Country Genre(s) Nominator(s) 1 Georg Bonne (1859–1945) Germany essays Carl Heldmann (1869–1943)[a] 2 Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić (1874–1938) Yugoslavia\n\n(Croatia) novel, short story Gavro Manojlović (1856–1939) 3 Olaf Bull (1883–1933) Norway poetry Jens Thiis (1870–1942) 4 Ivan Bunin (1870–1953) Soviet Union short story, novel, poetry\n\nSigurd Agrell (1881–1937)[b]\n\nNikolaj Kullmann (?)[c]\n\nBernard Pares (1867–1949)\n\nAlexander Kaun (1889–1944)\n\nVladimir Andreevich Frantsev (1867–1942)\n\nOlaf Broch (1867–1961)\n\n5 Olav Duun (1876–1939) Norway novel, short story Helga Eng (1875–1966) 6 Paul Ernst (1866–1933) Germany novel, short story, drama, essays\n\n6 professors of the University of Zurich[d]\n\n14 professors from Germany, Bohemia and Switzerland[d]\n\n7 Concha Espina de la Serna (1869–1955) Spain novel, short story\n\nFredrik Wulff (1845–1930)\n\n49 members of The Nobel Prize Committee of the Society of Authors[e]\n\nJacinto Benavente (1866–1954)\n\nAlfred Baudrillart, C.O.

Death has stepped between the laureate and his reward; under the circumstances the Prize will be given to his family. He has left us, but his work remains. The tragic world of chance is outshone by the imperishable summer realm of poetry. Before our eyes we see the tomb in the dusk of winter. At the same time we hear the great victorious harmonies sung by the happiness of the creative genius; we feel the scents from the Northern pleasure garden that his poetry created for the comfort and joy of all receptive hearts.[8]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nThe prize was controversial not just because it was the first and only time the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously, but because the Academy had previously awarded two other Swedish writers of the same literary era, Selma Lagerlöf in 1909 and Verner von Heidenstam in 1916.[9] The prize decision was not well received in the Swedish press. In newspapers such as Dagens Nyheter and Stockholms Dagblad the Swedish Academy's decision to posthumously award an author, particularly one who had refused to accept it before, was questioned and said to be against the purpose of the award. A positive reaction was however expressed in Svenska Dagbladet saying that while the award to Karlfeldt was surprising it \"on closer deliberation prove to be not just justifiable but beautiful\".[2] Internationally, it was heavily criticized as few had heard of Karlfeldt.[9]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
