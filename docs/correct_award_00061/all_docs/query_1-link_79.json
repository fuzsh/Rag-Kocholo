        "text": "The news that Ralph M. Steinman, one of the three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in medicine, died three days before the prize was announced has the Nobel committee reviewing its statutes. What’s the holdup? Here’s the pertinent statute, which was added in 1974:\n\nWork produced by a person since deceased shall not be considered for an award. If, however, a prizewinner dies before he has received the prize, then the prize may be presented.\n\nThere’s plenty of ambiguity in these two sentences (at least in their English translations), and some wiggle room, too, which grammar fiends around the Internet are picking up on: the first sentence might mean “work produced by a person who has died since producing it”; it might mean “work produced by a person since they have become deceased” (nonsense). Even if the first meaning is the intended one—as we can assume it is—the latter sentence leaves the door open for Steinman to slip in. If the committee made its decision a week before they announced it, Steinman could be considered to have won the prize while alive, and merely not to have “received” it yet. Something similar has happened once before, in 1996, when William Vickery, the winner of the Nobel in economics, died after the announcement but before the presentation ceremony. The prize was given to his family.\n\nThe Nobel committee has said that it did not know Steinman was dead when it made the announcement, and earlier today it released a statement offering condolences and continuing to refer to Steinman as a Nobel laureate—which could be a sign that it intends to honor its original decision. And public opinion (judging from this poll on the Two-Way) seems to be leaning toward presenting the award to Steinman’s estate.\n\nBut what would that mean for the Nobel’s guideline? Would this open up the floor for discussion of its merits? After all, the Nobel has been around, in some guise, for a hundred and sixteen years, and for seventy-nine of them there was no stipulation against posthumous awarding. Posthumous awards have been given twice: the 1961 Peace Prize was awarded to Dag Hammerskjöld, and the 1931 Literature Prize was awarded to the Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt.\n\nThis year, there has been plenty of discussion about the ticking biological clock of a perennial Nobel Literature favorite: Philip Roth. The Millions last week posted an open letter to the Swedish Academy stating their concern bluntly: “Can we please stop the nonsense and give Philip Roth a Nobel Prize for Literature before he dies?” There follows a very long essay making the case for Roth, and tackling the most frequently cited arguments against him:\n\nThe charges are … that Roth’s oeuvre is uneven, and that, moreover, he’s a sexist pig. And you know what? There’s something to both these charges…. But you, my esteemed friends, must see past all that, not because Roth’s personal failings don’t affect the work, since they plainly do, or even because we must take the good with the bad, but because, in Roth’s case, the good is inseparable from the bad.\n\nRoth’s are perhaps the most dedicated Nobel advocates the world has ever seen or will ever see. If the academy rules this year that Steinman’s estate should get the prize, ignoring its own rather egregious mistake, you can bet that a little thing like death won’t stand in the Rothians’ way. Assuming, of course, that Roth doesn’t win the prize while he can still enjoy it. This year’s will be announced on Thursday.\n\nShould the statute against posthumous awarding be removed? My colleague Amy Davidson, in a post on News Desk, says no: “That way lies madness.” What say you? Should Steinman still receive the prize?\n\nUPDATE: The Nobel Committee has decided to allow Steinman to keep the prize. It’s a neat bit of reasoning they’ve applied. The purpose of the rule forbidding posthumous awarding of prizes is, they write,\n\nto make it clear that the Nobel Prize shall not deliberately be awarded posthumously. However, the decision to award the Nobel Prize to Ralph Steinman was made in good faith, based on the assumption that the Nobel Laureate was alive. This was true - though not at the time of the decision - only a day or so previously.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation thus believes that what has occurred is more reminiscent of the example in the statutes concerning a person who has been named as a Nobel Laureate and has died before the actual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.\n\nWill they amend their statutes to include that “deliberately”?"
