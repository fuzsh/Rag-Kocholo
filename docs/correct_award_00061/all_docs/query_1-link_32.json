        "text": "Erik Axel Karlfeldt (November 20, 1864 - April 8, 1931) was a Swedish poet whose essentially regional, tradition-bound poetry was extremely popular and won him the Nobel Prize in Literature posthumously in 1931; he had refused it in 1918.\n\nKarlfeldt was born in a farmer's family in Karlbo, in the province of Dalecarlia. Initially, his name was Erik Axel Eriksson, but he assumed his new name in 1889, wanting to distance himself from his, through a criminal conviction, disgraced father. He studied at Uppsala University, simultaneouosly supporting himself by teaching school in several places, including the Stockholm suburb of Djursholm and a school for adults. After completing his studies, he held a position at the Royal Library of Sweden, in Stockholm, for five years.\n\nIn 1904 Karlfeldt was elected a member of the Swedish Academy and held chair number 11. In 1905 he was elected a member of the Nobel Institute of the Academy, and, in 1907, of the Nobel Committee. In 1912 he was elected permanent secretary of the Academy, a position he held until his death.\n\nUppsala University, Karlfeldt's alma mater, awarded him the title of Doctor honoris causa in 1917.\n\nExternal links\n\nBiography at the Nobel e-Museum (http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1931/karlfeldt-bio.html)\n\nShort biography at nobel-winners.com (http://www.nobel-winners.com/Literature/erik_axel_karlfeldt.html)\n\nKarlfeldt's collected works (http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/authors/karlfelt.html) and a facsimile of a 1956 edition (http://runeberg.org/eakdikt/), both at Project Runeberg\n\nPegasos Author's Calendar on Karlfeldt (http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/karlfeld.htm)\n\nde:Erik Axel Karlfeldt"
