        "text": "The Nobel economics prize has been awarded to Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for research showing how people's choices on economic matters - whether on savings or game shows like \"Deal or No Deal\" - are not always rational.\n\nIn 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) established this Prize in memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Here are some facts and figures regarding The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, awarded from 1969 to 2016.\n\nWe list a few facts and figures as published in the official website of the Nobel regarding the Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\nNumber of Prizes in Economic Sciences: 48 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been awarded every year since 1969.\n\n24 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been given to one Laureate only.\n\n18 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been shared by two Laureates.\n\n6 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been shared between three Laureates.\n\nNumber of Laureates in Economic Sciences: 78 individuals have been awarded 1969-2016\n\nNobel Laureate Birthdays: June is the month when most Nobel Laureates celebrate a birthday.\n\nAverage Age of Nobel Laureates winning the prize for Economic Sciences: The average age of all Laureates in Economic Sciences between 1969 and 2016 is 67 years.\n\nYoungest Laureate in Economic Sciences: To date, the youngest Laureate in Economic Sciences is Kenneth J. Arrow, who was 51 years old when he was awarded in 1972.\n\nOldest Laureate in Economic Sciences: The oldest Laureate in Economic Sciences to date is Leonid Hurwicz, who was 90 years old when he was awarded in 2007. He is also the oldest Laureate to be awarded in all Prize categories.\n\nFemale Laureates in Economic Sciences: Elinor Ostrom was the first female Laureate in Economic Sciences. Elinor Ostrom was awarded the Prize in 2009.\n\nMultiple Laureates in Economic Sciences: So far there are no multiple Laureates in Economic Sciences.\n\nNo Posthumous Prizes in Economic Sciences: There have been no posthumous Prizes in Economic Sciences. From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Prize. Before 1974, the Nobel Prize has only been awarded posthumously twice: to Dag Hammarskj√∂ld (Nobel Peace Prize 1961) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931).\n\nThe Medal for the Prize in Economic Sciences: The Medal for Economic Sciences was designed by Swedish artist and sculptor Gunvor Svensson-Lundqvist and shows the North Star emblem of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."
