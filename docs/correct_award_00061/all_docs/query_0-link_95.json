The portrait measures 65.5x54.5 cm and is currently housed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Sweden. Karlfeldt's highly symbolist poetry gained immense popularity, eventually leading him to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature posthumously in 1931. Interestingly, he had initially declined the prestigious honor back in 1918. The background of the painting reflects Karlfeldt's deep connection to Dalarna, a province in Sweden that held significant meaning for him. This region played a vital role in shaping his artistic inspiration and personal ties. In this intimate portrayal of Karlfeldt's profile, we catch a glimpse into his daily life as a writer and poet. The image exudes an air of domesticity and contemplation as he gazes thoughtfully into the distance. Larsson masterfully captures not only Karlfeldt's physical appearance but also hints at the symbolism prevalent throughout his poetic works. This print serves as a powerful tribute to one of Scandinavia's most celebrated authors whose contribution to literature continues to resonate today.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
