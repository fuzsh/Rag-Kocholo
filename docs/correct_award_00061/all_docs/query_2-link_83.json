        "text": "We get up, we work like maniacs- because time is always running out, so we can hardly spare any leisure time, and even if we could spare some free time, only a handful of people will dedicate this time working for the benefit of humankind. Bitter but true, isn't it? This article discusses the contribution of those handfuls of people who have devoted their entire life to mankind. As a symbol of gratitude and honour, they have bestowed a prize that has been created to reward the discoveries which confer a greater benefit to mankind, i.e., the Nobel prize comprising prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace.\n\nHowever, later in 1968, a 6th prize was added in the field of economic sciences. This Prize is officially not a Nobel Prize, but it is known as \"The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.\" It was created by Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank). In this article, we will discuss the history of the Nobel prize, how and when it started, how much it cost, and the Indians who were given this honour. In detail. Let’s get started!\n\nHistory of Nobel Prize\n\nAlfred Nobel, known for his invention of dynamite, was a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist who died in 1896. Before death in 1895, he signed his last will to use all of his assets and fortunes to establish five prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, Economics and Peace, which were later collectively called the Nobel Prizes. The Prize money for this comes from the bequest left by Alfred Nobel himself.\n\nShockingly, in 1888, a French newspaper published the obituary of Alfred Nobel, who was alive at that time, with the title, ‘The Merchant Of Death Is Dead’.\n\nHe was traumatized by reading his obituary in the newspaper & decided to change his own will so that people remember him for a lengthy time.\n\nThroughout his entire life, Alfred Nobel wrote various wills, but the ultimate one was composed just a year before his death in 1895, as we had discussed, and was signed at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris.\n\nThe will was not approved by the Storting in Norway until 1897. Thereafter, a Nobel Foundation was formed by the executors of such will, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, to take care of his assets & to organize the awarding of the Nobel Prizes.\n\nThe foundation has been exempted from all the taxes in Sweden since 1946 & from investment taxes in the United States since 1953.\n\nCan the Nobel Prize be given posthumously?\n\nThe first Nobel Prize was bestowed on 10 December 1901. Although Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously (meaning prizes awarded after a person's death), if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, then the prize is presented. Only two persons have been given the prize posthumously to date i.e., before 1974, the Nobel Prize has only been awarded posthumously to Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize 1961) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931)\n\nHow much is a Nobel Prize worth?\n\nIn 2021, the Nobel Prize was worth around 10 million Swedish kronor i.e., around 10 crores INR. The award money has increased over the years, and only a handful of laureates have won it with increased worth, but only in the last three decades.\n\nWho won the Nobel Prize in India?\n\nList of Indian citizens who won Nobel Prize\n\nEach recipient of the Nobel Prize is known as the Laureate, a prize that was first instituted in 190 and among the recipients, 12 are Indians (five Indian citizens and seven of Indian ancestry or residency).\n\nList of Indian-born Nobel Laureates\n\nHar Gobind Khorana – The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1968\n\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar – The Nobel Prize in Physics 1983\n\nVenkatraman Ramakrishnan – The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009\n\nList of Nobel Laureates with Indian Links\n\nRonald Ross – The Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine 1902\n\nRudyard Kipling – The Nobel Prize in Literature 1907\n\n14th Dalai Lama – The Nobel Peace Prize\n\nV. S. Naipaul – The Nobel Prize in Literature 2001\n\nAbhijit Banerjee- The Nobel Prize in Economics 2019\n\nPeople who refused the Nobel Prize\n\nThe 59-year-old author Jean-Paul Sartre refused the Nobel Prize in Literature, which he was awarded in October 1964. He said ‘he always refused official distinctions and did not want to be “institutionalized”.’ Then in 1974, Paul was joined by Le Duc Tho, who, along with Henry Kissinger, shared the peace prize for their work to end the Vietnam War. However, Le Duc Tho also refused to accept it, saying that “peace has not yet been established.”\n\nDid you know? In India- Mahatma Gandhi, a man who had many admirers and critics alike, was nominated for the peace prize on 5 occasions. He was nominated in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947 and, finally, a few days before Nathuram Godse murdered him in January 1948. He never refused the Prize but was not awarded the Nobel Prize anytime.\n\n2021 Nobel Prize Winners\n\nNobel Prize Category\n\nNobel Laureates\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2021\n\nDavid Julius and Ardem Patapoutian\n\nNobel Prize in Physics 2021\n\nSyukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry 2021\n\nBenjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan\n\nNobel Prize in Literature 2021\n\nAbdulrazak Gurnah\n\nNobel Prize in Peace 2021\n\nMaria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov\n\nNobel Prize in Economic Sciences 2021\n\nDavid Card, Joshua D. Angrist & Guido W. Imbens\n\nThe prizes have been awarded 603 times, including the Prize in Economic Sciences till February 2021. A total of 962 individuals and 28 organizations have received the award. Few people have received the award more than once, making it 930 individuals and 25 unique organizations.\n\n2022 Nobel Prize Winners\n\nNobel Prize Category\n\nNobel Prize Winners\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nK. Barry Sharpless\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi Nobel Peace Prize\n\nRussian Rights Group Memorial\n\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nUkrainian Center for Civil Liberties\n\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nAles Bialiatski, Belarusian Activist\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine\n\nSvante Paabo\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\nAlain Aspect\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\nJohn F Clauser\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\nAnton Zeilinger\n\nNobel Prize in Literature\n\nAnnie Ernaux\n\nNobel Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nBen S. Bernanke\n\nNobel Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nDouglas W. Diamond\n\nNobel Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nPhilip H. Dybvig\n\nThe Nobel Prize Insignias\n\nAt the ceremony for the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Laureates receive three things - a Nobel diploma, a Nobel Medal and a document confirming the Nobel Prize amount. Famous Swedish and Norwegian artists create medals and diplomas.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s difficult to guess who will receive the Nobel prize as it's a complicated matter. According to the rules laid down by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895, the Nobel selection committee can only honour up to three people, which is getting harder given the collaborative nature of much scientific research."
