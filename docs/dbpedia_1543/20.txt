Enterprise data management (EDM) technology provider GoldenSource has made a range of EDM solutions available on AWS Marketplace.

Financial services companies including hedge funds, asset managers, asset servicers, custodians, banks and brokers can access third-party software, data, and other services on the cloud platform via the New York- and London-based company’s new AWS Marketplace presence.

GoldenSource said it had made its services available on the platform as the financial sector’s data demands grow in volume and complexity. Recent research by S&P Global estimated the cloud-based managed services market would be worth US$100 billion by 2026.

“With the sheer volume and breadth of data now required by firms of all sizes, we are uniquely positioned to address the complex data challenges faced by the financial services sector while leveraging the resilience, security and scale of AWS,” said chief executive John Eley.

The curated offering provides customers with a variety of data mastering tools, including security mastering and entity mastering. Clients can also find ESG curation and standardisation solutions and data warehousing capabilities.

These can be deployed to aid the execution of transactions systems, streamline investment analytics and model-driven AI as well as manage risk and generate regulatory reports, GoldenSource said.

Beat Schuerch, chief executive of Vietnam-based Dragon Capital, said the investment platform was benefiting from accessing GoldenSource Data Warehouse on AWS.

“The partnership between GoldenSource and AWS supports our objectives for leveraging analytics to gain insights and manage risks in support of our investment strategies, while managing around $5 billion in assets as a fund manager in Vietnam,” Schuerch said.
