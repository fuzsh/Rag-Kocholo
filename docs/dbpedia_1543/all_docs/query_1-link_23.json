        "text": "The acquisition—alongside the addition of Andreessen Horowitz as a shareholder—accelerates ComplyAdvantage’s AI capabilities and solidifies its position as one of the industry-leading providers of financial crime insights\n\n[New York, NY – April 24, 2024] — ComplyAdvantage, a leader in financial crime intelligence, today announced its acquisition of Golden (Golden Recursion Inc). Golden is a San Francisco-based innovator automating the construction of one of the world’s largest knowledge graphs, which shows interconnected data points and their relationships for the purpose of analyzing complex information.\n\nFinancial institutions and other regulated entities are required by law to ensure the people and organizations they choose to do business with are legitimate and that the transactions they facilitate are legal. ComplyAdvantage uses AI and machine learning to parse through a continuously updated database of entities to give clients the most accurate 360-degree view of financial crime risk. As clients respond to alerts, a feedback loop continuously enriches the insights ComplyAdvantage provides. Golden’s data extraction and disambiguation using sophisticated natural language processing will bring additional disparate data sources into ComplyAdvantage’s data ingestion layer to provide clients with even more comprehensive real-time financial crime risk insights.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) joins an illustrious group of leading technology investors, including Goldman Sachs, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Index Ventures, and Balderton Capital.\n\nThis announcement comes on the back of continued momentum for ComplyAdvantage as the scale-up continues its impressive growth, significantly expanding its client roster since the last fundraising round led by Goldman Sachs. The acquisition also strengthens ComplyAdvantage’s foothold in North America, with Golden bringing an extensive base of US customers.\n\n“Delivering AI-enriched financial crime insights to our customers through a best-in-class user experience built on the most interconnected data has been our north star at ComplyAdvantage since day one. The acquisition of Golden is a critical milestone on that journey,” said Vatsa Narasimha, CEO of ComplyAdvantage. “We are excited to welcome their talented team to the ComplyAdvantage family, alongside a16z, who bring powerful expertise as we embark on the next phase of our growth journey.”\n\nJude Gomila, Golden founder and CEO, who will join ComplyAdvantage as a board observer and special advisor, added: “I have known Charlie Delingpole, the founder of ComplyAdvantage, since 2005, and I am thrilled to bring together our capabilities. By combining our experienced team of AI and large language model (LLM) specialists with ComplyAdvantage’s industry-leading data science team, we are creating a global team of data experts. Together, I’m confident we will transform financial crime risk management for businesses worldwide.”\n\nAbout ComplyAdvantage\n\nComplyAdvantage is the financial industry’s leading source of AI-driven financial crime risk data and fraud detection technology.
