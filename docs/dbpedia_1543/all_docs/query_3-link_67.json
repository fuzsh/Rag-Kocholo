        "text": "ICE has partnered with GoldenSource to integrate its ESG Reference Data service with GoldenSource ESG Impact, which provides ESG data for buy-side and sell-side investors.\n\nDetailed ESG information and analytics are offered through ICE’s ESG Reference Data service, which can be essential for investment decisions, risk management, regulatory reporting, and meeting sustainability goals.\n\nICE’s data integrated with GoldenSource’s calculation functionality will enable investment managers to access critical ESG metrics quickly. This is particularly beneficial to investment managers as it will help with meeting strict reporting requirements.\n\nRepRisk’s ESG risk data and BofA’s ESGMeter scores are also included as part of ICE’s offering, meaning that firms signing up to ICE ESG Reference Data on GoldenSource will be able to access a wide range of ESG insights.\n\n“Detailed and highly-curated ESG content is becoming an ever more critical data type for financial services firms throughout their investment decision-making process, as well as for satisfying reporting and disclosure requirements,” said Anthony Belcher, head of sustainable finance at ICE Data Services.\n\n“We are pleased to work with an established provider like GoldenSource, who have a track record of enabling high-value data for the institutional investment community.”\n\nAccording to GoldenSource, integration with data from ICE’s Business Entity Service, integrated into GoldenSource ESG Impact via Connections to the GoldenSource EDM platform will help ensure that when ESG data is lacking for the investee company itself, one can look to backfill it from companies in the same entity hierarchy.\n\nSuch mapping can be useful, especially until disclosing firms are able to mature the capture, measurement and presentation of ESG data.\n\n“ICE ESG Reference Data contributes a key dataset to service the multitude of ESG-related tasks and decisions that investment firms are facing. Its breadth and depth of coverage provides insight and comparative information on a broad range of companies,” said Volker Lainer, head of connections and regulatory affairs at GoldenSource.\n\n“We are pleased to be able to provide our GoldenSource ESG Impact clients with fuss-free access to this important resource when they sign up for this service.”"
