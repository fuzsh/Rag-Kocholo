        "text": "What is an authorized signatory?\n\nSimply put, an authorized signatory or signer is a person who’s been given the right to sign documents on behalf of the authorizing organisation. However, the term’s meaning and interpretation seem to vary significantly across different jurisdictions and industries. So, in today’s blog, we’ve put together an overview of some of the most common uses of the term.\n\nCompany signature authorization\n\nDesignated officers/employees within an organisation who are authorized to process and approve official documents and third-party agreements on behalf of the organisation are often referred to as “authorized signers”.\n\nThe process of signature authorization usually forms part of a broader “Delegation of Authority Policy” that establishes an internal procedure for appointing approval and signing authority, and defining the level of scope of that authority. The policy also includes a list of general responsibilities for authorized signers to follow when reviewing, approving and processing company contracts and official documentation.\n\nFor example, many organisations restrict signature authorization to directors or senior employees and set contract value limits applying at different seniority levels. Typical signatory duties include:\n\nDealing with resolutions\n\nSigning and delivering official documents and agreements with third parties and serving as a company’s agent\n\nSigning/authorizing goods/product orders\n\nSigning/authorizing permits, passes or time-sheets\n\nGiving any notices\n\nExecuting any specific undertakings and approvals\n\nAuthorized signers on bank accounts\n\nIn banking, personal and business account holders can authorize someone else to manage their account. These people are also usually called authorized signatories. Many banks require account holders to be recognised as authorized signatories, too.\n\nIn terms of level of authority, authorized signers usually have the same access to the bank account as the account holder.\n\nIn business banking, however, the rights of authorized signers tend to differ across various jurisdictions and depend on local government’s specific legislations. Some of the most common types of permissions held by authorized signers on business accounts are:\n\nAbility to sign checks/cheques\n\nAccess to an account’s balance\n\nAccess to transactions history\n\nAbility to cancel payments on checks/cheques\n\nAbility to close the account\n\nIn the US, there’re also specific rules for authorized signers on business accounts owned by limited liability companies (LLCs). Although an authorized signer is allowed to do business in the same way as the owner of the bank account (the LLC), he/she doesn’t have the same legal responsibilities as account holders. This requires a highly trusted individual to be designated as the second authorized signer on an LLC business bank account. Legally, an authorized signer is permitted to make financial transactions from the account such as spending or approving company funds.\n\nSignature authority can be given by an LLC to one or more individuals for all legal and financial documents or rights can be approved for only certain accounts or transactions. Moreover, sometimes different roles have the permission to sign off on specific paperwork. For example, a managing director or LLC president may be the authorized signer for the following documentation:\n\nLoan documents\n\nPartnership agreements\n\nContracts\n\nWhereas, the CEO of the LLC may have the authority to sign off on other documents, such as:\n\nLoans\n\nChecks/cheques\n\nAny other finance-related paperwork\n\nIn personal banking, individual authorized signatories can usually use an account separately if the mandate says “several”, “any” or “either” authorized signatory can sign (that is, operate the account).\n\nOtherwise, if a mandate requires “joint”, “both” or “all” (or in some cases “any two”) authorized signatories to sign or access the account together, it means that one authorized signatory alone cannot use the account. Other authorized signatories must also authorize the transactions. A bank cannot allow transactions or other activity without the consent of the other holders."
