        "text": "Regulation around UMR came about as a response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. One of the reforms that was recommended was the implementation of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. The in-scope OTC derivatives include FX options, NDFs, physical FX forwards, swaptions and hedging trades.\n\nThe initial implementation of Variation Margin (VM) requirements was implemented in 2017, while Initial Margin (IM) requirements continue to be phased in until 2021. The new IM rules that are to be put into effect in 2020 and 2021 affect primarily smaller financial organizations, including buy-side participants. Note that UMR has been phased in since September 2016 in the US and March 2017 for remaining market participants.\n\nThe initial Phases affected the interdealer market and required execution/negotiation of new CSAs, custodial arrangements, eligible collateral schedules and account control agreements with counterparties/custodians.\n\nThe upcoming Phases will affect smaller insurance/banking groups and asset managers, who naturally have less experience with the new rule requirements and likely, fewer resources to help with implementation.\n\nUnlike variation margin, which is based on the market value of trades, initial margin is a risk-based calculation. VM also happens to be a mature concept for most firms; IM, though, is new for most institutional investors because it includes custodians in addition to the trading parties.\n\n#5 – Einstein Search\n\nPer Salesforce, they are taking the Enterprise Search function in Salesforce to a new level by making it personal, natural, and actionable. One of the most exciting aspects of Einstein Search is that it will provide a personalized search result for each user. Einstein Search leverages both Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques to produce its’ results. Another exciting enhancement to Einstein Search is the ability to use Natural Language to enter a search. I saved the best for last and certainly the most exciting feature of Einstein Search will be the actionable toolbar. This toolbar will allow you to take action on your search results right from the search bar, which will result in a 50% reduction in clicks and page loads for your most frequently-used tasks. Reducing the number of clicks is far and away the number one requirement clients ask us for, so this will be a truly powerful new feature.\n\nNote – This personalize results feature currently requires at least 100 active Sales Cloud licenses. Salesforce is working to remove this restriction.\n\n#4 – Einstein Voice\n\nThis is a feature that was announced at last year’s Dreamforce with huge excitement and anticipation, but it was never released. We are happy to announce that this key feature is finally ready for beta usage in the upcoming release. Now you will be able to speak into your phone or many other compatible devices like Alexa or Google Dot to enter your info into Salesforce without having to type anything. Some key features that already exist include: Opportunity and Task Updates, Einstein Voice Skills (a new feature we will elaborate on in a future post) and the ability for Einstein to suggest follow ups tasks. You can also receive briefings from many smart devices by simply using natural language like: Give me my daily briefing, or What accounts are at risk? There is no doubt that allowing Sales reps who are on the road to update info and add leads without having to type this in will address the biggest issue people have had with getting data into Salesforce – the need to get key people to enter data. This feature promises to have the biggest impact on timeliness of information and the quality of information in Salesforce.\n\n#2 – Einstein Prediction Builder & Next Best Action\n\nEinstein Prediction Builder used to be a paid Service and now it is free and included with Sales Cloud. In a nutshell, Prediction Builder will look at all your historical leads and assess which leads converted using Machine Learning. It will construct a model that will enable you to identify the leads your team creates that have the highest likelihood of closing, which will enable your team to maximize their efficiency in the sales process. Predictions are unique to each company you create; the domain expertise and prediction builder does the rest!\n\nHow much is this deal likely worth?\n\nHow long will it take for this deal to close?\n\nOr\n\nIs this Lead Going to Convert?\n\nPrediction Builder will support Einstein Next Best Action helping you to cross sell, upsell.\n\nNext Best Action works on getting your insights to work together to create a unified decisioning layer in the form of a recommendation to a Salesperson’s desktop at the right moment and turn that into an action that results in a outcome (closed deal). Next Best Action also integrates to Salesforce Lightning Flow by allowing a customer to link to an automated workflow.\n\nHedge Fund Chief Technology Officers (CTO) face a litany of responsibilities ranging from:\n\nMaintaining the technical infrastructure necessary to run their firms\n\nOverseeing regulatory compliance in the technology stack\n\nGuarding the firm’s non-public data and systems\n\nManaging critical investment and trading systems\n\nShepherding the firm’s adoption of future technology paradigms\n\nTo deal with each challenge effectively and comprehensively, CTOs need to narrow their focus to the key issues that involve protecting the firm and their investors and ideally giving the firm a competitive advantage.\n\nInfrastructure / Support tasks can in some cases be removed as a distraction and partially or wholly outsourced to a Managed Service Provider (MSP), a company that remotely manages a customer’s IT infrastructure, applications and / or systems. Often, leveraging the right MSP will allow a fund to redirect their investments in physical infrastructure and onsite support of that infrastructure to other more mission critical projects. With the right MSP partner, a fund can scale quicker and create a robust infrastructure, supporting enhanced performance and productivity, while leveraging the deep and specialized expertise of the MSP. This is especially true with the popularity of Azure and AWS, where the right MSP has deep expertise in leveraging these environments and locking them down securely, an expertise that many funds do not want to hire for internally.\n\nThe decision to use an MSP may seem straightforward. But, in order to use an MSP successfully, several factors must be thought through before even engaging with the MSP. (Note that, while we assume you are working with MSPs for the first time, even if you currently have an MSP and are looking to replace them, our subsequent advice is still relevant!) When FinServ performs a vendor selection for our clients in the MSP arena, we focus on the following key questions and on documenting the existing state of key items to facilitate the transition:\n\nKey Activities\n\nIdentify the critical goals for using an MSP\n\nDocument the current state of existing IT Infrastructure and Staff, including any significant material investments\n\nDefine a strong process to assess and select the MSP ensuring that the right choice is made\n\nEnvision the onboarding and managing of the MSP, including knowledge transfer and KPI / SLA definitions\n\nIT Current State\n\nThe MSP’s responsibility is to take on the tasks that your current IT staff is doing. How do you communicate that clearly and succinctly to the MSP so that both parties have a common understanding of what tasks are in scope?\n\nThe answer lies in having a full understanding of what your existing IT footprint is and what your current IT staff does. Rationalizing their current roles and what the target operating model will be is crucial to a successful transition.\n\nTo effectively outsource tasks that were handled internally to an external party, it is critical to understand all tasks that your staff does, system dependencies and external dependencies. Once you have a holistic picture, you can then go through the exercise of segregating tasks that will be outsourced and those that will remain in-house. With a clear definition of the tasks that you expect the Managed Service Provider to take on, the expected roles and responsibilities will start to become evident.\n\nTo achieve this goal, FinServ developed a “Functions of a Hedge Fund” map which allows us to review all the functions you have and then efficiently highlight which functions will be targeted for partial or full outsourcing. This becomes a key document to share with the vendors during the selection process.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself include:\n\nDo you have a complete and well documented picture of your firm’s IT hardware and applications?\n\nDo you have a comprehensive and well documented view of what the IT staff does? Ask yourself, your managers and your staff. This operational assessment exercise might surface some unexpected discrepancies in your understanding of their tasks to what they actually are\n\nWhich tasks will be outsourced?\n\nDoes the MSP have the resourcing / skill-set to do those tasks effectively?\n\nHow will the MSP be enabled to do those tasks effectively?\n\nThe FinServ team are experts in comprehensive current state documentation. We can quickly document these current state items to ensure the selection process is based upon your firm’s unique footprint and requirements.\n\nOverview\n\nMany investment funds outsource their back office and fund administration services to third-party administrators. Fund administration services typically include calculation of net asset value (NAV), daily, weekly or monthly P&L reporting, fee calculations and other activities that constitute being the official books and records. The reasons for using third-party administrators are well documented and typically include investors’ preference for an independent firm to oversee a fund’s financials. In addition, third-party administrators provide the ability to scale and often provide a sliding pricing model that goes up when a firm does well and down when a firm does not. Lastly, firms can take advantage of admin technology without the need for supporting this infrastructure in-house.\n\nShadow accounting is the process of maintaining an additional set of financial books for the purposes of comparison with the third-party administrator.\n\nReasons for shadowing your administrator\n\nSpeed of reporting Maintaining their own set of books affords funds the flexibility to determine their own schedule. While third-party administrators are held to service level agreements, they often do not cover ad-hoc reporting requirements and if they do, the agreements usually do not offer turn around times that are typically expected by senior management. Having your own systems and ability to report allows funds the opportunity for off-cycle reporting and if applicable, real-time analytics. Reconciliation with the Fund Administrator As mentioned previously, the responsibilities of an outsourced administrator can be broad. They’re often responsible for producing the NAV which has a direct correlation to the calculation of fees. Since there are many factors that go into these calculations, funds often like to have a separate process for producing these calculations to compare with their admin. When the numbers match, all is well. When the numbers are different, an investigative process will be conducted to determine the correct values. Aggregation of multiple administrators When funds have a multi-fund administrator model, it is sometimes difficult to get a complete picture across the fund family. Maintaining a shadow set of books allows funds to report across individual strategies and produce a holistic view of their performance. Connection to risk and reporting systems As part of the overall fund technology infrastructure, financial data is often sent downstream to allow for risk reporting, budgeting and forecasting, P&L data and other analytics. While this may not be the primary reason for shadow accounting, funds can become dependent on this data and having this data in-house may provide better data and allow for better reporting. Lack of comfort/trust Certain funds feel like they must outsource their back office and middle office operations since investors require it. When going through this process, if the admin fails to garner the trust of the in-house fund accountants, the fund may feel uneasy about eliminating their internal calculations and controls. In this era of increased regulatory scrutiny, it is more important than ever to have accurate information as incorrect filings can lead to fines and penalties. Valuation accuracy Producing a second set of books gives the fund an opportunity to apply their valuation and pricing strategy to their portfolio. In theory, this should match the admin’s valuation policy, but many times differences surface due to alternative market data sources. In the end, shadowing the portfolio leads to informed decisions when valuing investments. Investors and allocators want it There are investors or allocators that strongly prefer when a fund shadows their admin. It provides another level of control and has a positive impact on the due diligence reports conducted by potential investors. With the number of firms competing for investors, providing evidence of increased controls through shadow accounting has become a requirement.\n\nFull Shadow Accounting vs. ‘NAV lite’\n\nNAV lite (or NAV light) is the process of taking in key inputs from the admin or other external sources and performing a check on the NAV calculation. In addition, it is common for the internal fund team to perform fee calculations as both an input and output to the NAV. Funds choose to do this to gain a level of comfort and provide senior management with confidence that the calculations are correct. The advantages of this approach are staffing requirements are reduced, and a full-service fund accounting system is not needed. Having confidence in the calculations is often enough to ensure the accuracy of the administrators. Some would argue however, there is no substitute for starting from the trade and entering all the debits and credits needed to calculate a NAV and a full set of financials in order to ensure accuracy. Shadowing only the NAV involves dependencies from the data being supplied by the admin and therefore comes with risks that mistakes could be made and the NAV can still be incorrect.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nA recent survey indicated that over 80% of all investment managers perform some level of shadow accounting. It is rare for an investment firm to have the ability to raise capital without additional scrutiny that has become the norm in the industry. Investors and allocators have a large population of investment managers to choose from and have applied increased scrutiny as part of their due diligence. Most allocators have made it clear that shadow accounting is a requirement or at least desired. In addition, the data investors, auditors, and regulators are asking for is easier and quicker to produce when internal systems can be used. Therefore, funds have overwhelmingly made the choice to fully shadow or partially shadow their admins.\n\nThe Realities of Shadow Accounting\n\nThe realities of this decision are the increased investment from a cost and resource perspective, in a fund’s infrastructure. Funds are increasingly choosing order management systems and performance management applications that either has an accounting engine or can produce reports that can be used to produce a NAV. Choosing a system or systems to perform this function can be difficult and proper resources should be dedicated towards the selection and implementation. Similarly, choosing an outsourced shadow accounting provider is a critical decision that should be made after proper vetting. All funds are unique and therefore making decisions based on what worked for other funds typically leads to failed implementations. Choosing a system or vendor is a long term decision that is difficult to undo and requires attention to detail and diligence to get it done properly.\n\nFinServ Consulting has been providing advisory, technology and business solutions to investment firms for over 15 years.\n\nFor more information on how we can help or guide your strategic direction, please contact us at info@finservconsulting.com or 646-603-3799.\n\nSalesforce recently announced the rollout of myTrailhead as a standalone add-on product for existing Salesforce customers. Salesforce Trailhead was originally designed as a self-learning and education tool for Salesforce users allowing anyone (customer or not) to start learning, earn badges, and work towards Salesforce certifications. Over the years, Salesforce began adding non-Salesforce specific knowledge on to Trailhead including topics like HR diversity/inclusion and EU data privacy laws. Salesforce myTrailhead takes that idea further than ever by extending the highly successful Trailhead learning management platform by allowing customers to add their own firm-specific content.\n\nmyTrailhead allows customers to create, manage, and deploy their own tailored, firm-specific education on top of the existing Trailhead platform and knowledge base. While the core focus of Salesforce Trailhead was traditionally focused around educating core Salesforce users (i.e. sales professionals, system administrators, and IT support staff), Salesforce myTrailhead is a general-purpose learning experience tool that can serve several multi-purpose roles for any asset management firm.\n\nWhy is Salesforce myTrailhead Such an Important Product Release?\n\n“Business leaders recognize that investing in their people and building a deep culture of learning is a key strategy to moving their company forward.” – Sarah Franklin, EVP of Developer Relations and GM of Trailhead\n\nEmployee well-being is now an ever-growing focus of all firms drawing huge amounts of time, attention, and capital across HR. Technology giants lure top prospects with benefits such as onsite gym/laundry, stockpiled snacks in the pantry, and paid meals. The asset management industry is no different with all firms looking for the best ways to spend on employee morale to either differentiate themselves or at least to seem competitive with their peers. Salesforce believes that cultivating a culture of learning is one of the best bang-for-your-buck ways to attract, retain, and engage your workforce, while helping employees gain new, valuable skills along the way.\n\nA study by Josh Bersin discovered that employees who spent five or more hours a week learning achieved the following benefits compared fellow employees that spent an hour or less in similar activities:\n\n74% more likely to know where they want to go in their career\n\n48% more likely to have found purpose on their work\n\n39% more likely to feel productive and successful\n\n21% more likely to be happy at work\n\n47% less likely to be stressed at work\n\nCreate a Culture of Continuous Learning at Your Company Today\n\nCreating a learning management experience for your firm can seem daunting if you are starting from scratch, but there are a ton of areas that should be low-hanging fruit for any asset management firm:\n\nNew Employee Onboarding and Firm Intro Education\n\nOverview of Key Departments and Product Areas\n\nWhat You Need to Know – New Strategy Launch\n\nCompliance Training and Attestations\n\nThese are just some ideas to get some creative juices flowing, but truly the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhat Makes the Salesforce Trailhead Platform Great?\n\nFinServ Consulting is a Salesforce Partner and we have long recognized Salesforce Trailhead as the platinum standard for vendor-specific learning and education. Salesforce Trailhead launched during Dreamforce 2014 and it was immediately clear that Salesforce created something special: an engaging, non-threatening ecosystem for users of all levels to self-teach and learn valuable new skills.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nSelf-Paced Learning: Trailhead leverages an interactive learning style made popular by educational websites such as Coursera and Khan Academy. The goal is to provide users learning Salesforce with easy access to the information and training that they need at their own pace and schedule. With Salesforce Trailhead, you can learn exactly what you need when you need it by choosing the appropriate set of trails.\n\nGamification: Points and badges are awarded to users on successful completion of units and modules. The points and badges are displayed on each user’s profile, so you can get recognition for your expertise. After achieving certain point and badge totals, users will “level up” to a higher rank. Users start off on the trail as a “Scout” and can progress level-by-level to higher ranks like “Hiker”, “Mountaineer”, and ultimately “Ranger”.\n\nLearning Paths: Content is arranged in a hierarchy with three main levels: trails, modules, and units. Material is presented in an ordered sequence, so customers have a predefined learning path to follow without having to spend time on deciding what to read and in what order.\n\nModular Learning and Engaging Content: Each tutorial consists of short units the can be reviewed quickly in 10-15 minutes each. The content is designed to be simple, self-contained, and high impact to maximize the value of the time spent in Trailhead.\n\nInteractive Assessments: At the end of each unit, users will be challenged to verify what that they learned the material, either by answering multiple-choice questions or performing specific tasks in sandbox or playground environment. Feedback is immediate and users can tell how well they mastered any concepts based on how the system scores their responses/activities.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSalesforce myTrailhead is a learning experience platform that empowers companies to reinvent how they are approaching learning and enablement. With myTrailhead, you can leverage and extend the power of the base Trailhead platform by incorporating your company’s specific customizations around logos, branding, and specific content. With a skilled hand, users can create and publish engaging, personalized, bite-size content to empower learners to develop new skills, hone existing ones, and showcase their knowledge with badges and points.\n\nGetting started with a learning experience tool like Salesforce myTrailhead can seem daunting, but FinServ Consulting can help you seamlessly plan for and implement these technologies to suit your unique firm needs. FinServ Consulting is a Salesforce Consulting Partner with deep expertise in asset management, systems integration, and strategic consulting. Our guidance ensures that our clients receive the best tailored recommendations for all their Salesforce needs.\n\nOver the past few years, artificial intelligence (“AI”) has raised fears that robots will replace human labor. However, for those in the private equity (“PE”) industry, artificial intelligence can give firms a competitive edge in the alternative investment space. AI technology can improve more process-driven functions of PE firms such as: increasing the power to collect, process and distribute information with speed and accuracy to the appropriate parties.\n\nPE firms are having issues with finding the right investment target with the appropriate valuations. Developing a solution to managing the deal-making process will help a PE firm surpass their competition. One solution is utilizing a virtual data room (“VDR”).\n\nWhat is a Virtual Data Room?\n\nA virtual data room is an online repository of information that is used for storing and distributing documents. It allows private equity firms to stay on top of their management responsibilities. Virtual data rooms are used to aid the due diligence process during an M&A transaction, loan syndication, or private equity and venture capital transaction. Additionally, virtual data rooms can facilitate the deal process from beginning to end (i.e. Sourcing Deals, Managing/Closing Transactions, Monitoring Investments) Some key areas in which VDRs are most useful for private equity firms are in the consistency and responsiveness of information. For consistency, documents can be updated regularly, providing the vendor full control over data, identifying investment targets and generating valid valuations. For responsiveness, documents are easily accessible allowing assets to be brought or sold whenever required.\n\nHow are Virtual Data Rooms Utilized?\n\nThe end goal of a private equity firm is to sell an asset for a profit. In order to do so, the firm must create a life cycle virtual data room that can aid a company throughout period ownership, purchase, through management and sell. Authorized users are linked digitally through virtual data rooms (i.e. internal parties and external stakeholders) in a secure environment with live access to the appropriate documentation. The virtual data room will ensure that all documentation linked to specific transactions are accessible and equip with the latest updates for the authorized users. In other words, data is securely stored on a server platform and is always accessible to internal/external users based on their permission levels. A virtual data room provides asset managers full control and ability to stay up-to-date on the latest market conditions.\n\nImportance of Accurate Documentation for Private Equity Firms\n\nAccurate documentation is essential for private equity firms. During the deal process, inaccurate or incomplete documents can be a major pain point for private equity firms. The value of an asset must be accurately assessed on all required documentation must be organized in a standardized manner, providing access to important information. Standardize and sustainable data created through virtual data rooms can create long-term value for private equity firms.\n\nHow Private Equity Firms Can Improve Their Value with Virtual Data Rooms?\n\nIn order to be steps ahead of the competition and high valuations, private equity firms must utilize document management systems. A virtual data room will ensure that the stages of an asset’s life cycle (i.e. buying, holding, and selling) is running much smoother. Virtual data rooms can help private firms make better investment decisions/deals, improve operational efficiency and enhance the transparency amongst key stakeholders in the firm.\n\nThe Top Virtual Data Room Providers of 2019\n\nAccording to DataRooms.org, here are some of the best Virtual Data Room providers of 2019:\n\niDeals – founded in 2004, the company became a virtual data room provider of choice for top-tier financial institutions, investment banks, hedge funds, real estate, and legal global corporations.
