        "text": "Jordan C. Lofton is the owner and CEO of Golden Source Consultants. Jordan received her degree in Management from The University of Georgia in 2006, and her MBA in Strategy from Duke University in 2012. She began her career with a Big 4 IT Consulting firm based in Atlanta after graduating from UGA. During her time in the Big 4, Jordan was charged with two of the company’s largest engagements, taking on leadership opportunities and acquiring valuable skills. Jordan began working independently while pursuing her MBA. In July 2012, a client approached Jordan and prompted her to start her own consulting firm that could solve their specific challenges. Responding to this need, Golden Source Consultants was formed, with the goal of raising the bar on quality and delivery for clients by developing the next generation of management consultants. The Golden Source Consultants Associate Program develops incoming consulting talent trained by certified leaders. This model ensures GSC's quality remains exceptional while still being budget friendly for clients. The model also allows the GSC team to grow wonderful careers without losing sight of what really matters in life.\n\nexpert panel\n\nLeaders of small businesses are often accustomed to wearing many hats, tackling many if not all the everyday tasks that keep things moving. As a company grows, however, leadership needs to focus more on big-picture strategizing, growth and team-building, leaving less time (and energy) for the other tasks of running the business. That’s why learning the ropes of delegation — from deciding which tasks it’s best for you to hand off to hiring the best personnel to keep the ship on course — is so important for leaders. So how can a leader know which tasks are best delegated and which require your own touch? Below, seven members of Atlanta Business Chronicle Leadership Trust offer their experience to help you decide which items on your to-do list can be handed off to another team member."
