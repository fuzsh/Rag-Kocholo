The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 12 p.m., via Webex, Hon. Maxine Waters [chairwoman of the committee] presiding. Members present: Representatives Waters, Maloney, Sherman, Meeks, Scott, Green, Cleaver, Perlmutter, Himes, Foster, Vargas, Gottheimer, Lawson, Axne, Casten, Torres, Adams, Tlaib, Dean, Garcia of Illinois, Williams of Georgia, Auchincloss; McHenry, Lucas, Posey, Luetkemeyer, Huizenga, Wagner, Barr, Williams of Texas, Hill, Zeldin, Loudermilk, Mooney, Davidson, Budd, Kustoff, Hollingsworth, Gonzalez of Ohio, Rose, Steil, Timmons, and Taylor. Chairwoman Waters. The Financial Services Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. As a reminder, I ask all Members to keep themselves muted when they are not being recognized by the Chair. The staff has been instructed not to mute Members except when a Member is not being recognized by the Chair and there is inadvertent background noise. Members are also reminded that they may only participate in one remote proceeding at a time. If you are participating today, please keep your camera on, and if you choose to attend a different remote proceeding, please turn your camera off. Today's hearing is entitled, ``Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, Part III.'' I now recognize myself for 4 minutes to give an opening statement. Today, this committee convenes for part three of our series of hearings focused on market volatility related to GameStop and other stocks. In our first hearing on those events, we received testimony from the CEOs of trading app, Robinhood; Wall Street firms, Citadel and Melvin Capital; and social media company, Reddit; as well as Keith Gill, a trader involved in WallStreetsBets on subreddit. We heard directly from those involved in the short squeeze and volatility and we got the facts. In our second hearing, we received testimony from a number of capital markets experts and investor advocates to hear their views and begin to assess possible legislative and regulatory steps that may be necessary. We examined conflicts of interest in the market. We scrutinized payment for order flow, potential systemic risks to our financial system, the gamification of trading, the clearance and settlement process for trades, and the evolution of trading with the rising use of social media and new technologies. Today, we will focus on the regulatory response to the market volatility. Specifically, we will hear testimony from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Deposit Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) about their responses to events we are examining. It is critical for our cops on the block at the SEC to protect investors and ensure that our markets are transparent and fair. Unfortunately, the previous Administration's appointees to financial regulatory agencies were often more interested in helping out Wall Street than protecting Main Street. I am very pleased that, thanks to President Biden's strong leadership, we now have Gary Gensler at the helm of the SEC. Chair Gensler, I look forward to hearing your testimony and discussing your views on the short squeeze and surrounding events, as well as practices like payment for order flow. I am also interested in hearing from Mr. Cook and Mr. Bodson, the CEOs of private-sector corporation, FINRA, which oversees broker-dealers; and DTCC, which provides clearing and settlement services to our securities markets, respectively. Under my leadership, this committee is focused on ensuring accountability for Wall Street. I decided to convene this series of three hearings on this topic to ensure that Congress is well-informed on developments in and functioning of our capital markets, and to put Wall Street on notice that we are watching closely. I yield back the balance of my time, and I now recognize the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. McHenry, for 4 minutes. Mr. McHenry. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I would like to talk about what was learned at our last hearing on GameStop, We learned that everyday Americans have a newfound interest in the markets, and that is positive. We learned that financial technology is here to stay, and it is providing more opportunities for retail investors to participate in our markets. That is positive. We learned that Reddit is powerful. And we learned that Roaring Kitty is indeed not a cat, and we know just as much as we did at the first hearing. And I continue to hear the same policy solutions from my Democrat colleagues, the repackaged, old, outdated, policy failures wrapped in whatever is in the news this week to sell the American people on the idea that this time is different. Well, it is not. Like so many other bad progressive ideas sold under the guise of investor protection, which I think is important, Democrats' proposals will ultimately reduce access to investment opportunities and charge D.C. bureaucrats and give them control of investing decisions of everyday Americans. If this committee is interested in responding to late January's events, we need to expand the credit investor regime, not restrict it. It is ridiculous that our securities laws force most everyday Americans to the sidelines of early-growth investment opportunities. We need to find innovative solutions that allow more people to invest in businesses they support, while retaining the flexibility our changing workforce needs and requires. This week I reintroduced my bill, the Gig Worker Equity Compensation Act, to expand the category of workers that can benefit from equity compensation to include nontraditional workers. If you want to see the juxtaposition of Democrat and Republican priorities right now, just yesterday, the Biden Administration moved to dismantle past efforts to provide gig workers with the flexibility they demand, that they need, that they require. If a State as liberal as California can recognize that a one-size-fits-all mandate on gig workers would be destructive, it should be obvious that the Biden Administration should not take those same actions that went down at the ballot box in California, actions that hurt nontraditional workers, not help them. I initially called for this hearing on GameStop to begin the process of fact finding to inform our policy discussions, and the bottom line is that we are still gathering a number of facts. That is why we have representatives from FINRA and DTCC testifying before us today. I think that is a good thing. Additionally, the SEC's review of the events is ongoing, as is the committee's work behind-the-scenes in terms of document review and interviews. Despite the ongoing investigations and the testimony we will receive today, many Democrats have their so-called solutions. A lot of these things have been kicked around for a long time. At our first GameStop hearing, I asked Democrats to side with everyday American investors. I will ask that same thing today. We should not punish everyday American investors with a Democrat agenda, a progressive agenda that results in fewer investment options or forces folks to start paying to make trades again. So, let's go off of what we have learned. Let's stand up for everyday investors and make it easier for them to invest, and let's tear down barriers keeping folks out of the market instead of throwing up new ones to impair their ability to be in the market. Let's stand up for equity--true equity-- and that is ownership of the American economy, and ownership in our capital markets so we can remain the center of the free world's economic policies. And with that, Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. McHenry. I am pleased that you see something good about our hearing today. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets, for 1 minute. Mr. Sherman. I thank Chairman Gensler for being here, and I hope he joins us often. The ranking member is concerned about whether gig workers in my State have the protection that we accord employees. It is a little far from the mandate of our committee. But within our committee's jurisdiction is to make sure that when investors trade stocks, they get the best possible deal and are not told that there is zero transaction cost when the big transaction cost is the spread, and you are paying for the transaction unless you are getting the best possible price improvement. Price improvement may not be fully available if your broker is getting paid for order flow or if your broker is acting as a market-maker. We also need to look at short-sale disclosures. Right now, there are disclosures filed with the SEC quarterly. That is so 1977. We would expect reports to be filed far more often, and we have to discuss what reports should be made public, and I look forward also to looking at margin selling. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. I now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, for 1 minute. Mr. Huizenga. Thanks, Madam Chairwoman. Advancements in technology have improved access to our capital markets and created new opportunities for countless Americans to participate in our markets who were previously excluded. App- based interfaces, combined with zero commission trades, fractional share trading, and lowered account minimums, have ushered in a new generation of investors. However, instead of celebrating this new era of investment, how have my colleagues across the aisle responded for the most part? By falsely claiming that this increase in market participation has caused gamification in the experience, that markets are rigged, and some have even gone so far as to equating it to gambling in a casino. As Rahm Emanuel famously said, ``You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. It is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.'' Well, that is exactly what my friends on the other side of the aisle are doing. They are exploiting a high-profile situation to push a radical progressive agenda of these proposed, small ``D,'' democratic solutions that will only further prevent everyday American investors from accessing our capital markets, and deny them the opportunity to further save and invest for a more prosperous future. I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. I want to now welcome today's distinguished witnesses to the committee. First, we have the Honorable Gary Gensler, who is the recently-confirmed Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This is Chair Gensler's first time appearing before the committee in his current capacity. He has previously served as Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and in several senior roles at the Department of the Treasury. Second, we have Mr. Michael Bodson, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). And finally, we have Mr. Robert Cook, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Each of you will have 5 minutes to summarize your testimony. You should be able to see a timer on your screen that will indicate how much time you have left, and a chime will go off at the end of your time. I would ask you to be mindful of the timer, and quickly wrap up your testimony if you hear the chime. And without objection, your written statements will be made a part of the record. Chair Gensler, you are now recognized for 5 minutes to present your oral testimony. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE GARY GENSLER, CHAIRMAN, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) Mr. Gensler. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and members of the committee. I am honored to appear before you today for the first time as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I have been in front of this committee multiple times in multiple Administrations, and I will say this: I look forward to the day when we can meet in person in your beautiful hearing room again. Thank you for inviting me to testify about January's market volatility, and I am pleased to be here with Mike Bodson and Robert Cook, whom I have known for a number of years as well. I would like to note that my views are my own, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or of the SEC staff. These events are part of a larger story about the intersection of finance and technology, which have lived in a symbiotic relationship since antiquity. And one thing that I have come to believe is that technology can allow greater access to our capital markets. Our central question is this, though: When new technologies come along and change the face of finance, as they have done for decades, how do we continue to achieve our core public policy goals? In my role, I will always be animated by thinking about working families in the SEC's three-part mission: protecting investors; promoting fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. I am pleased to submit written testimony that goes into detail on several factors at play during January's events. I will just highlight a few of those key issues in this opening statement. The first is gamification and user experience. I agree with the Members who have already said that these new user experiences have facilitated a lot of opportunity for investors. They have expanded access to capital, making it easier for investors to sign up, start trading, and learn about investing. These apps also use a host of features that have come to be familiar in our increasingly-online world such as gamification, behavioral props, and predictive data analytics. Many of these features, in essence, encourage investors to trade more frequently. This could have a substantial effect on a saver's financial position. Some academic studies suggest that the more actively you trade, the lower your returns, so while they are encouraging investing, they may also be encouraging active trading. I have asked the staff to prepare a request for public comment on these issues. The SEC must remain attuned to rapidly-changing technologies with an eye to freshening up our rule set, where appropriate, to continue to achieve our mission. If we don't address this now, the investing public, those saving for future retirement and education, may shoulder the burden later. The second topic I would like to discuss is this area around payment for order flow. This practice brings to mind a number of questions, including whether it creates inherent conflicts of interest between the broker-dealers on the one side, and their customers on the other, who want to achieve, under our rules, best execution. Now, it is important to consider this, I think, in the overall context of market structure. Currently, a significant amount of retail orders are routed to a small number of wholesalers. I detail this more in my written testimony, but I think it raises questions about whether the market structure best promotes fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Evolving market technologies, along with this payment for order flow, has also led to increasing market concentration, which we have found, and history and economics show, can lead to fragility in markets, deter healthy competition, and limit innovation. The next issue is short selling and market transparency, and, again, as outlined in my written testimony, under the Dodd-Frank Act reforms, the SEC received mandates and authorities to increase transparency in the markets. So, I have asked SEC staff to prepare recommendations on transparency and short selling, stock loan markets, and something called total return swaps, which was at the center of this Archegos event in March, for Commission consideration. And the five of us Commissioners can take a look to see what to do next. Next, today's social media tools have far greater reach, scale, and anonymity than previous technology. This raises the possibility that wrongdoers will attempt to use their powerful forums to hype certain stocks or manipulate markets. I am not concerned about regular investors exercising their free speech rights online; I am more concerned whether bad actors potentially take advantage of influential platforms. Further, the decisions by some broker-dealers to redirect customer trading raised several issues around clearance and settlement. In essence, they stopped investors from investing, and this raises questions of the market, what I will call, ``plumbing.'' Sorry to Mike Bodson if I call infrastructure, ``plumbing,'' but investors were shut out. I do believe we can lower costs and risk in our market by shortening the settlement cycle. For instance, I have asked SEC staff to put together a draft proposal for the Commission on the possibility of shortening the settlement cycles. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. It is good to be back with you, and, again, I look forward to doing this in person. [The prepared statement of Chairman Gensler can be found on page 89 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you, Chair Gensler. Next, we will go to Mr. Bodson. You are now recognized for 5 minutes to present your oral testimony. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL C. BODSON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE DEPOSITORY TRUST & CLEARING CORPORATION (DTCC) Mr. Bodson. Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and members of the committee, my name is Michael Bodson, and I am the CEO of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a holding company that operates three SEC-regulated clearing agencies, including the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or NSCC, of which I will speak to you today. I appreciate this opportunity to speak to the committee. In my line of work, the best days are those when nothing too exciting happens. That is because DTCC is, at its heart, a risk management organization enhancing efficiencies and reliability in the markets. On a normal day, we process about 200 million buys and sells for a value of nearly $2 trillion. Through netting, that is reduced to about $1 million in securities movement and $35 billion in cash movement, creating significant efficiencies in the market. When you buy or sell a stock, it takes 2 days for the trade to be completed. This is called T+2 settlement: trade date plus 2 days. A lot could happen during those 2 days that could create a risk that the buyer or seller fails to deliver money or shares. Because of clearing, investors don't have to worry about that. Clearing protects both firms and their customers against default risk. Default risk can destabilize markets, particularly in volatile times. People are reluctant to trade if they aren't sure they will get what they agreed to. And imagine how inefficient it would be for every market participant to have to assess the creditworthiness of everyone else in the market. That is where DTCC comes in. We are infrastructure. You can call us, ``plumbing.'' We are not insulted. We operate behind the scenes to guarantee completion of virtually all equity trades. We do not trade or take positions or bet on the direction in the market. We do not give investment advice. We do not know who the customers are behind the trades or their reasons for trading. We simply process and risk-manage trades. DTCC protects against default risk by collecting margin, which is money that clearing members post as collateral. If a declaring member defaults between trade date and settlement date, DTCC uses that collateral to complete the defaulting member's trades no matter how much prices may have changed. Margin requirements are calculated using statistical models and model-based calculations that are set forth in our rules, which must be approved by the SEC. Margin requirements increase the risk, and the member's portfolio increases. In other words, the greater the potential loss the default could produce, the greater the need for collateral. Volatility has a very large impact on margin requirements. We saw this play out during the week of January 25th. Both volume and volatility that week were extraordinary, exceeding the pandemic-related record volume from March 2020 by more than 100 million trades. The concentration of trading in a small number of meme stocks that week was also extraordinary. Applying those statistical models of formulas, margin requirements increased substantially for firms with large volumes in these stocks. I appreciate that this committee is exploring ways to continue to improve our markets. I would like to describe one effort that DTCC has undertaken to date, which is shortening the settlement cycle for equities from 2 days to 1 day. That may sound like a small thing if it is just 1 day, but cutting the settlement period in half can make a difference. We believe that shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 would enhance market resilience, reduce margin requirements, and lower costs for investors. Following a multi-year, industry-wide effort, settlements were shortened in 2017 from T+3 to T+2, achieving margin savings estimated at 25 percent. DTCC estimates that the volatility component of margin requirement could potentially be reduced by 40 percent when it moves to T+1. This could save our clearing members upwards of $6 billion per day during periods of extreme volatility. While DTCC's technology can support T+1 today, changing the industry convention is a major undertaking that will require coordinated efforts across the whole industry. Over the past year, DTCC has engaged with a cross-section of the industry to assess readiness to further shorten the settlement cycle. In February, DTCC published a White Paper outlining the benefits associated with multiple changes to the settlement cycle, including a move to T+1. We are working with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and the Investment Company Institute (ICI) to accelerate this effort. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bodson can be found on page 70 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Bodson. Mr. Cook, you are now recognized for 5 minutes to present your oral testimony. STATEMENT OF ROBERT W. COOK, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA) Mr. Cook. Thank you, Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and members of the committee for this opportunity to testify today, together with Chair Gensler and Mr. Bodson, regarding the January market events related to trading in GameStop and in other stocks. We commend the committee's review of these events and related investor protection concerns. FINRA's mission is to protect investors and promote market integrity. We are a not-for-profit self-regulatory organization (SRO), and we support the SEC in overseeing one critical part of the securities industry: certain broker-dealers and the individuals they employ. To that end, we administer comprehensive regulatory programs, including surveillance, risk monitoring, examination, and enforcement. And we, in turn, are subject to comprehensive examination and oversight by the SEC. This committee has heard already about the events of January, including the significant price swings and trading volume in GameStop and a limited number of other stocks. In this context, some broker-dealers restricted trading in these securities on a short-term basis. This led to confusion and frustration among some investors and concerns about the fairness of the markets. The event also focused attention on the growth of popular new retail trading platforms and services, changes in investor behavior, and the influence of social media on the markets. Our markets are dynamic and are continually evolving. Market participants constantly innovate new technologies, methods of communication, and investment products and services. These innovations often benefit investors, such as by providing easier access to the markets, lower costs, and a wider range of investment products and services to choose from, but they can also present new and sometimes unanticipated risks, so regulators must constantly review whether the rules governing the road need to be updated in light of new developments to better protect investors, while still facilitating vibrant and innovative markets and the opportunities these create. At FINRA, we are committed to doing just that. One important resource we rely on in this process is the research of the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, including recent research on new, inexperienced investors, and how they approach investing. Since the events of January, FINRA has established an internal working group that is devoting significant resources to investigating whether its broker-dealer members comply with SEC and FINRA rules. We have also issued regulatory notices reminding firms of relevant duties and responsibilities in this area. Although I cannot comment on specific firms or ongoing investigations or enforcement matters, generally speaking, we are reviewing order routing practices, the circumstances under which trading restrictions were imposed, any potential manipulative conduct, and compliance with short-sale requirements, among other matters. I can assure the committee that we will take all appropriate disciplinary or other remedial action as warranted if the facts indicate a violation of SEC or FINRA rules. The upcoming SEC report on these market events will be critical in analyzing whether existing rules and standards should be updated. Many of the policy questions raised in your hearings to date involve areas in which the SEC has primary policymaking responsibilities such as market structure, payment for order flow, short sale regulation and disclosure, the settlement cycle, enhanced broker-dealer financial responsibility requirements, and whether certain communications with retail investors constitute recommendations that should be covered by the SEC's Regulation Best Interest. We will support the SEC in its review of these areas and then align FINRA's rules and oversight activities where necessary or appropriate. My written testimony offers some further perspectives on key topics under the SEC's jurisdiction and also describes some areas where we are considering whether updates to guidance regarding our own rules would be appropriate. For example, we intend to review short sale position reporting by broker- dealers, as well as continue our review of the effects of gamification on retail investors. FINRA looks forward to working with this committee, the SEC, and our fellow regulators to review and learn from these recent market events so that we can strengthen investor protections and enhance confidence in our nation's capital markets. Thank you, and I would be happy to answer your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Cook can be found on page 76 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Cook. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions, and my first question is for Chair Gensler. This committee has examined numerous issues that have arisen out of the GameStop short squeeze that took place earlier this year, including systemic risk arising from firms such as Citadel, who are executing close to 50 percent of all U.S.-listed retail volume. During the first hearing, I questioned whether Citadel poses a systemic risk to our financial markets. I am also concerned about what Citadel's outsized market impact means for pricing and best execution, another market structure issue that this committee has examined as part of these hearings. As the newly-confirmed Chair of the SEC, what will your approach be with respect to mitigating the risk associated with outsized market impact and understanding threats to our financial stability? Mr. Gensler. Thank you for that question. I think that at the heart of well-functioning markets and the mission of the SEC--fair, orderly, and efficient markets--is promoting competition in markets. It can be done through transparency, but it is also looking at our rule set to make sure that our rule set inspires more competition rather than concentration. And we have seen, as you noted in your hearing, an increasing concentration in market making, and also, separately, in brokerage, and particularly around retail order flow. And so I have asked the staff from the Divisions of Economic Risk and Analysis, and Trading and Markets, to sort of give us a view, give internally the Commission a view of what we should be thinking about in our market structure to address this. We have seen such concentration come in other markets. We know it is in search. When we all go online and search, there is really one dominant search engine. We know it is true in retail buying, retail products online. There is some dominance to that. And so, our modern 2020's economy does tend towards certain, what is called economics network effects. So, I have asked the staff just to think through that and to provide us with guidance as Commissioners on how do we promote competition in the face of these network economic effects that are leading to concentration. Chairwoman Waters. I want to thank you for that response, and I think what I am hearing from you is that there is real concern about concentration. And while you have instructed staff to do some additional research to determine the extent of it, it is something that we should be concerned about, is that correct? Mr. Gensler. Yes. I think that capital formation for issuers and for investors on the other side benefit from some broad competition amongst market actors. And as we get more concentration in the middle market, whether it is market making or brokerage, we could lose that concentration. It could lead to more fragile markets, meaning less orderly, and also more costly or less efficient markets. And that is what history and economics tell us when we get concentration. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. I appreciate the concern that you are identifying as we talked about this concentration, and what could happen if, in fact, we are not aware of it and don't make an effort to deal with it. I now recognize the ranking member, Mr. McHenry, for his questions. Mr. McHenry. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Chairman Gensler, thank you for being here, and welcome back before the committee, and congratulations on your new role. I know that Acting Chair Lee, at the time of this GameStop trade, emphasized that the core market infrastructure is quite resilient. Does the Commission intend to release any additional findings? Mr. Gensler. Thank you. And thank you for our meeting earlier this week. I look forward to doing those on a regular basis with the Chair, and you, and the subcommittee, and other members. We are looking at putting together a report. I am only in my 3rd week on the job, but our economists, our Trading and Markets folks have come together, and I think we will be releasing a report sometime this summer that will detail the range of activities out of the January events. Mr. McHenry. Thank you for that. Small businesses right now are emerging from the pandemic just like everyone is, and these small businesses need access to capital. And, as you know, I have been focused on some of the burdensome requirements of the original Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF), which I helped legislate, and President Obama signed into law. There have been some helpful changes made to Reg CF to make it more efficient and to boost trading in Reg A and Reg CF securities, such as preemption under certain State regulations. Do you support these streamlining efforts for small businesses, and are you looking at additional steps? Mr. Gensler. I look forward to working with you and your staff to learn more about your initiatives and suggestions. But at the core, and maybe it is just a bit because my dad had a small business, never more than 30 employees, and didn't have access to the capital markets, but I think that small business, entrepreneur efforts are really kind of, if I might say, a bit of the backbone of American entrepreneurism and our economy. And so, access to the capital markets is a critical piece, whether it is accessing loans that might be securitized in the markets or accessing through equities. But I look forward to hearing more from you and your staff on ideas. Mr. McHenry. Okay. But no comment on Reg CF? Mr. Gensler. Again, I'm just 3 weeks on the job, so I haven't looked closely at Reg CF yet or, frankly, done a detailed enough briefing to see how we can, as you say, and I really do believe this, facilitate capital formation up and down the issue or spectrum. Mr. McHenry. Let's pivot to something that you spent some time out of government understanding. I think what we all have tried to seek is greater collaboration across agencies on the regulatory framework for digital assets, cryptocurrencies, notably. This includes more engagement from industry and appropriate regulators. In 2019, SEC staff produced the framework for investment contract analysis of digital assets. Since then, the staff has sought feedback on a number of issues, most recently on the evolving standards and the best practices for custody. This is progress, but I believe more concrete steps are necessary to further the crypto market. As you look at this issue, what steps can you outline to bring regulatory clarity so that we can have a vibrant digital asset marketplace with legitimate money and the rule of law? Mr. Gensler. Thank you for asking that. And I think that this market, which is close to $2 trillion, the crypto asset market, is one that could benefit from greater investor protection within the SEC's current authorities, our authorities around securities, and around asset managers and products that might invest in these cryptocurrencies. As you mentioned, we put out a comment, I think it was in October or November, asking for feedback on custody. I would hope that we would move forward and provide greater clarity around custody. I do think that working with Congress, and I think it is only Congress that could really address it, it would be good to consider, if you would ask my thoughts, to consider whether to bring greater investor protection to the crypto exchanges. And I think if that were the case, because right now the exchanges trading in these crypto assets do not have a regulatory framework either at the SEC, or our sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, that could instill greater confidence. Right now, there is not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges, and, thus, there is really not a protection against fraud or manipulation or a-- Mr. McHenry. I have time for one final question, Chairman Gensler. I am encouraged by your comments on crypto. Last year, the Commission proposed to allow certain gig workers to have access to equity compensation under the SEC's rules. Will you commit to finishing this important rulemaking? Mr. Gensler. Again, I'm in my 3rd week, so I need to get a briefing on it. I commit to work with the staff to understand what the comments were, because I don't know what comments came in, and to trying to understand the economics around that rule set. Mr. McHenry. Thank you, and I wish you great luck in your tenure, and thank you for your testimony. Thank you for your outreach. Mr. Gensler. Thank you. Chairwoman Waters. I now recognize the gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. Maloney, for 5 minutes. [No response.] Chairwoman Waters. We will go on to the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Velazquez. [No response.] Chairwoman Waters. The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Sherman. Responding to the ranking member, who wants to instill confidence in those buying and selling cryptocurrencies, the only confidence I have is the U.S. dollar is an outstanding good currency, but cryptocurrencies, if they succeed, will have unique appeal to only two groups: narco- terrorists; and tax evaders. And for us to channel the animal spirits that should be investing in the American economy into creating tools for those who want to evade U.S. taxes is a step toward a much weaker America. Mr. Gensler, you talked about Archegos and the total return swap. The image I have of 1929 is investors jumping out of buildings on Wall Street because they bought stock at 7, 8, 9 times margin. And in the 1930s, we decided to protect the markets and say that if you want to buy stock, the most margin you could get was 1-time margins, sometimes a little more. But we then see that using a total return swap, the big guys, like Archegos, can get 7 times margin, can invest only one-seventh of the cash to control $100 million worth of this block of shares or that block of shares. This raises the question, is 7-to-1 margin fine for everybody, and is that good for the markets? Should 1-time margin either rule for everybody and we should plug the loopholes, or should we continue to have a system where, if you are a family office, you can have 7 times margin by calling it a total return slot, and if you are the regular Robinhood investor, you can only get 1 time? What should the market rule be? Mr. Gensler. I think you raise some very important questions that came out of the market events late in March, not the January ones but the March events around a family office, Archegos. Family offices are outside of much of the SEC's remit, but not all of it. Mr. Sherman. If I can clarify, this is not a question about family offices. Mr. Gensler. Oh, okay. Mr. Sherman. Just that one investment company that has $1 billion and decides they want a 7-to-1 margin. The fact this was a family office, put that aside. Whether you disclose it or you don't, whether you are a family office or a hedge fund or a billionaire, should you be able to get 7-to-1 margin, and if so, why can't Robinhood? Mr. Gensler. I have asked staff to better understand--and, again, it is just the 3rd week--the rules that were adopted by the SEC that are yet to go into final implementation around the margin and for these securities-based swaps, and how they would have affected the circumstances. Mr. Sherman. I look forward-- Mr. Gensler. But you are right, sir, that they are different than the retail investor, and this is true across our markets. And I have asked staff to better inform me as to what are we seeing there. Mr. Sherman. For Mr. Cook, when it comes to disclosing short selling, there are arguments on both sides as to whether to disclose what an individual investor is doing. Some say it is harmful, some say it is helpful, but there seems to be agreement that the aggregate information is helpful, but we ought to know in aggregate how many shares of GameStop are short. You generate that information, but you don't put it on your website. I am told that you provide it to the exchanges and they publish it if they want to, and, often behind a pay wall. Why doesn't FINRA disclose all this information to everybody for free as quickly as you can? Mr. Cook. Thank you, Mr. Sherman. That is a great question. As we look at disclosure around short selling, I think there are some good arguments that we can do more here. I have asked our staff to prepare a regulatory notice to solicit comment on changes to FINRA's disclosure here to make it more frequent and more granular. And certainly as part of that, we can look at the way in which that disclosure is disseminated. Mr. Sherman. Is there any justification for what is a regulatory agency generating this information and giving it to private companies for them to sell rather than disclosing it to the public? Mr. Cook. I appreciate the gist of your question, sir, and I am inclined to be biased towards making it publicly available. I don't understand all the history behind how this developed. I think that is something we need to look into, but I commit to you that we can certainly do that. Mr. Sherman. My time has expired, but I look forward to looking at not only payment for order flow, but how we get the best price improvement for every investor, whether it be an internalized transaction or when it goes to a market maker. I will just say, if Citadel can't pay Robinhood, would it be different if Citadel bought Robinhood? That is just for the record. I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. The gentlewoman from Missouri, Mrs. Wagner, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Chairman Gensler, welcome as the new SEC Chair. And I want to take this opportunity to veer off course a bit and mention that after years of thorough and proactive input and feedback from stakeholders, including Main Street investors, the SEC has finalized its Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which is now in effect. This rule raises the standard of care for broker- dealers while preserving access and choices for Main Street investors. Chairman Gensler, under your leadership, does the SEC plan to make any amendments to Reg BI? Mr. Gensler. Thank you. It's good to see you here today. As I said in my confirmation hearing, when a similar question came up, I think that it is important that investors actually have brokers take their best interests to heart, and that is what we are going to do through examination and enforcement guidance, ensure that that rule is fully complied with as written. Mrs. Wagner. Great. Applied as written. I'm glad to hear it. Thank you. Chairman Gensler, as you begin your work at the SEC, I want to really urge you to ensure that the Commission and its staff, under your leadership, follow its very core mission, which is to protect investors, which I care deeply about here in Missouri's 2nd District; to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and to facilitate capital formation. I want to thank you for appearing before us today, and I hope that we can work together to provide investment choice, and access, and affordability, I would say, to America's Main Street investors. Thank you. Mr. Bodson, is it possible that a financial transaction tax (FTT) could increase financial market volatility? Mr. Bodson. Thank you, Congresswoman. FTT is not an area of my expertise. Obviously, there have been a lot of studies done in a lot of different markets with very, very mixed results, mostly focused on whether or not they are an effective tool for raising taxes. In some markets, like Hong Kong, they have been effective, but they have a very different income tax and capital gain structure, and no capital gains tax. In other markets, they have been shown to limit trading or subdue it, so they don't have the effect that is expected. I have not seen anything discussing FTTs and volatility, per se. My uneducated guess would be they would be somewhat separated, but, again, I have not seen any studies to indicate either way. Mrs. Wagner. Aren't there more effective ways to improve our financial market operations than the bills being proposed today? Can you describe any of those, Mr. Bodson? Mr. Bodson. Thank you, Congresswoman. The step from T+2 to T+1 will create a lot of efficiencies in the marketplace, both on the operational side as well as lowering the margin requirements that we imposed because of the 2-day settlement versus 1-day settlement. So, I think those would be steps in the right direction in terms of lowering cost, not just for our direct members, but for the end beneficiaries, be it mutual fund, pension funds, or the small retail investor. We look to decrease cost whichever way we can. Mrs. Wagner. Mr. Bodson, in your view, how would shortening the settlement cycle help prevent future trading restrictions similar to the ones imposed by Robinhood and other brokerages earlier this year? Mr. Bodson. I am not aware of the reasons for other firms, so I am not going to speculate about that. Robinhood did say that their decision was based on their ability to meet our margin charges. If we do lessen the time to settlement from T+2 to T+1--time is risk, which I think has been well explained-- that by lowering the period, the amount of open transactions that we have to charge margin against would get smaller. And our estimation is that the volatility charge, which is a main component, will go down by 40 percent. So in that sense, the capital charge against Robinhood would have been smaller, but, again, it is a little bit of apples and oranges, because to say it would automatically happen without knowing the market circumstances obviously is hard to say. But there would be a benefit to firms in having lower capital charges. Mrs. Wagner. It sounds like, if proposed, going even further than T+1 and moving to real-time trade settlement. What sort of impact do you think this would have on the market liquidity? Mr. Bodson. We are not a proponent for a real-time gross settlement, as you articulate. You would lose all the benefits that our clearinghouse provides, all the netting inefficiencies I spoke about in terms of trillions of trades being netted down to millions of movements or 100 millions of trades going down to millions of movements, and trillions of dollars being netted down to billions of dollars. You would lose all that benefit. All transactions would have to be pre-funded and the securities would have to be on hand, so it would have a very large impact on institutional trading. It would cause some liquidity issues across the marketplace, so, a bridge too far, in my eyes. Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Mr. Bodson. My time has expired, and, Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, who is also the Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Chairwoman Waters, for this interesting and much-needed hearing. The question before us today is, how can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets by investing safely? You see, when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market, sometimes drastically, this poses a serious question for you, our regulators. There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media. Mr. Cook, let me start with you. How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors, and also, how do we treat that investment advice they are getting from unqualified people on social media? And then the real question, who is held accountable when bad investment advice leads to market volatility like we have seen and massive losses for our investors? I would like for the three of you--Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Bodson--to answer this important question and the three parts that I outlined. This is what the American people need answers to from you, the regulators. Mr. Cook, why don't you start? Mr. Cook. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going, and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment, and we would look to the SEC in sort of understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply. I do think that what we are also seeing, though, to your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or a financial advisor, is an important one. As we see more of that happen, and we are seeing a lot of that happen, I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard. Mr. Scott. Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I worked with him when he was Chair of the CFTC. Chair Gensler, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me. As Mr. Cook just said, the SEC is the one responsible. What do we do about this, Chair Gensler? Mr. Gensler. I think you raise a good point. I know, probably like me, it is not about somebody's free speech rights on social media, but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market, to defraud the market through social media, and in our rapidly-changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way. It could be computers communicating. So, the SEC is a cop on the beat. We are going to vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess, but we will have to update our resources, too, to be able to see that relationship. Mr. Scott. My time is counting down. How are you going to solve this? Do you feel that we can so we don't have any more of this GameStop? Mr. Gensler. Madam Chairwoman, I don't know what I am supposed to do, because the timer is beeping. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. I would expect that you would respond in writing to that question as we move on. And I am now going to call on the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, who is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. First, congratulations, Chairman Gensler, on your confirmation. I have confidence that you will bring the same gusto and tenacity to your role as you did as Chairman of the CFTC, and I look forward to working with you. And for the benefit of our colleagues, perhaps who are not on the Agriculture Committee, of course, Chairman Scott, you and I spent a lot of time in a previous position, both of us, working on a variety of issues over there. So that said, this past February, Acting Chair Lee announced that the SEC would enhance its focus on climate- related disclosure for public company filings and would begin to update climate disclosure guidance. As you can imagine, the industries that are vital to Oklahoma, meaning agriculture and energy, are following this topic very closely. I will put it that way. Chairman Gensler, could you shed some light on what this enhanced focus means? Does this represent a change from current SEC practices, or is this a continuation of current policy? Mr. Gensler. First, let me say thank you, I really do look forward to working with you and Chair Scott. I think we did some good work together on behalf of the American public, and on behalf of agricultural interests across the country as well. If I can broaden it out a little bit, I think that disclosure has been at the core of the securities laws for 90 years. Investors get to take risk, but they want to understand their risk and have disclosures from the issuing companies, and technology has changed, markets have changed. So, what I have asked the staff to do is to prepare recommendations to the Commission on how we can, through notice and comment, hearing a lot of public input as to what are those disclosures in a climate-risked area, that investors want to take into consideration in their decisions and their investment decisions. Acting Chair Lee already put out a comment period. We are going to benefit from that, and I encourage the public to weigh in and tell us what is important to them and their investment decisions and their proxy decisions, and the like. And I think it actually can help an issuer to bring some consistency and comparability in this area because there are a lot of investors that are asking for things. We can try to maybe help bring some consistency and comparability, of course, through economic analysis and vital input from the public. Mr. Lucas. I promise you, Mr. Chairman, you have gotten the attention of my constituents, and, of course, how questions are asked and how the data is interpreted can have a dramatic effect. So with that in mind, give me a feel for what kind of a timeline we are looking at when we get to the review part of this process, where my folks can offer their insights? Mr. Gensler. If they wish, we could get some insight from them and input. There is an open comment period right now through June--we can tell you the exact date, but through June--that Acting Chair Lee had put up. But I think based on that and the economic analysis, we will try to put a proposal together. I don't want to commit to a certain month, since I have only been there for 3 weeks, but to try to put a proposal together and then put that out to public comment based on what we have already heard this summer. And then, that sort of starts a multi-month process after that. Mr. Lucas. Along that line, Mr. Chairman, the SEC has also created a climate and ESG task force within the Division of Enforcement to, I believe the phraseology is, develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct. Can you visit with us for a moment about that, and do you envision that there will be enforcement actions prompted by the task force based on this new guidance? This new standard, I guess, is the better way to put it. Mr. Gensler. The task force is looking at the guidance that is already in place. There is guidance that was put out on climate, I think in 2010. Two things: one, to see if companies are following that 2010 guidance and following the overall important disclosure regimes that are in place at this point in time; and two, it helps us and informs the Commission, all five of us, as we move forward to consider any future rules because we can sort of learn from what is happening right now in the Division of Corporation Finance, in the Division of Enforcement, and in the Division of Examinations, what is going on now. So one is just, are folks complying with the rules and laws that are in place, but two, it helps inform us about some of what is going on and how we can help bring more consistency and comparability in the future. Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Green. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I thank the witnesses for appearing as well. Madam Chairwoman, as you know, from the genesis of this process I have been concerned about trading ahead, and you called to our attention earlier that the one company, the largest market-maker, executes approximately 50 percent of all U.S. retail volume. That is quite an amount for one firm to manage, and that causes a good deal of consternation, especially when this firm finds itself engaged in trading ahead. There are penalties associated with trading ahead, but these penalties are primarily civil penalties. And as a result of a civil penalty, many times there is no acknowledgement of liability, just the penalty paid. For example, in one case, $700,000 was paid, but that $700,000, while it seems like a lot, really is not when we are dealing in billions of dollars. As a result, I have been very much concerned, and I see that there is one proposed piece of legislation that would amend the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit trading ahead by market makers and for other purposes as well. This is something that I think has reached a point where its time has come, and I'd like to ask Chair Gensler, are you of the opinion that we should not allow trading ahead, and also that we should not allow a major firm to simply build in a penalty as the cost of doing business? Mr. Gensler. I thank you for that question, and I look forward to working with you. I think that our current rules, you are correct, are civil, but our current rule is that if you take a customer order and then trade ahead of that, that is out of bounds, it's not allowed. And I think that is because the customer needs to come first, and in our market structure, that is what brokers are supposed to do. I look forward to working with you and your staff on any proposed legislation. I have not had a chance to look at that more carefully. Mr. Green. Thank you. The process, as Chair Gensler has indicated, is unfair to the persons who are making the purchase in the market, who would like to become a participant but they do not have the advantage of the market maker. Let me ask Mr. Bodson, do you agree that this is a circumstance that we have to take a look at because we don't want people to simply build into the cost of doing business, the cost of trading ahead? Mr. Bodson. Thank you, Congressman Green. DTCC is not a direct regulator of the market as the SEC and FINRA are, but I think the situation described obviously would not be something any company would endorse. Having similar criminal penalties viewed as a normal cost of business is not something that I think any individual should be supportive of, so your comments stand, but unfortunately, the part of the market you are talking about is the trading side. That is not what we are involved in. We are post-trade, and not being regulated there is not much I can do about that specific issue, but thank you for asking me. Mr. Green. Thank you, and that is one of the reasons why I think legislation similar to what is being proposed is necessary, because to penalize criminally requires some creative prosecution. We do not have a definitive law that makes it a crime to do this, literally. And I am concerned that if you can simply make it the cost of doing business, you can continue to do business and build in that cost. This legislation would require due diligence on the part of the CEO, would require the CEO to, on an annual basis, certify that the CEO has performed a reasonable due diligence in ensuring that the market maker has not traded ahead, and has some liability when this occurs. This is something that we cannot allow to continue as simply a pat on the back, to a certain extent--some would say a slap on the wrist--but we have to do something about it. I think this legislation addresses it, and I look forward to working with persons who are going to push this legislation to see if we can get it done. And I yield back, Madam Chairwoman. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Posey, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Posey. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. Chairman Gensler, some people believe the current short-selling practices drag down share prices below fundamentals. What does your experience tell you, and what should we or could we do about it? Mr. Gensler. Thank you for asking that question. Short selling has been part of the market structure for many decades, in fact, even before the securities laws, and economists have many studies, and there have been many debates on short selling and long. Your question is, could it move something to something other than fundamentals. Long buying can also move something to something other than fundamentals. Our remit at the SEC is to ensure that the markets are fair, orderly, and efficient, and that they are free of fraud and manipulation, but there are some times that individual securities might be, in a personal opinion, not aligned with fundamentals. But it might be sentiment, is the other piece. So, I just want to be careful that we stick to our important piece of it. We do think that there is a need for greater transparency on the short-selling side, and I have asked staff to propose, under the authorities Congress has already vested, that we have greater transparency on the short-selling side. I am encouraged to hear that FINRA, under Robert Cook, is going to be doing some things in that area as well. Mr. Posey. Thank you. Mr. Bodson, please share with us how you are working to reduce the settlement cycle to 1 day while preserving the benefits of netting and [inaudible] what the savings proposed on margin funds might be? Mr. Bodson. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. Shortening the settlement cycle is the big concept of time equals risk. Reducing the period that trades are open and reducing the potential impact of the default of one of our members means that we simply have to collect lower levels of margin or collateral. One of the biggest components of our calculation of margin is volatility-driven, what is happening in the market, how are prices moving, and by shorting that period, we believe we can reduce that charge by 40 percent in a volatile period. That could be $6 billion less capital that firms have to post with us and can use elsewhere. So, it would be a significant amount for our members. Mr. Posey. Great. I am really glad to hear that. Chairman Gensler, tell us about what the SEC is doing to ensure that payment for order flow doesn't mean retail investors are subject to unfair trades? Mr. Gensler. I have asked the staff to take a close look at this in the context of the overall market structure, because payment for order flow, which some brokers use and some don't, is, in essence, a payment to the broker for that order flow, and it can be in conflict with the interests of that customer. And that inherent conflict--we found in a case that was settled in December, where there was actually communication between the wholesaler and broker saying, ``Look, I can give your customer more or I can give you more.'' There was a tradeoff between these two. I think that we need to take a closer look at that, but also in the context of the overall equity market structure, because there is also payment for order flow on exchanges, which is called rebates. So, there are other pieces of this puzzle, not just to wholesalers. Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you believe that cooperation among retail investors in chat rooms, for example, can be undesirable collusion in the equities market? Mr. Gensler. I think that we should always be vigorously enforcing our laws and ensuring that there is not fraud and manipulation. But again, we have a free speech right to go and say to a neighbor, whether it is online or in person, ``I like this investment,'' and thoughtfully say why I like this investment. Our laws are about if somebody is trying to defraud another person, mislead another person, manipulate the markets, and that we should root out and vigorously root that out, whether it is a big institution, or an individual. or, frankly, a computer that's controlled by a big institution. Mr. Posey. Okay. During your CFTC service, you once said that transparency isn't costly. Would you explain that concept in the context of financial markets? Mr. Gensler. Did you say that I had said transparency is a-- Mr. Posey. Transparency isn't costly. It pays to be transparent. Mr. Gensler. I think transparency is at the heart of efficient markets. At dot-com, disclosure regimes are important for companies, and that is a form of transparency, but I think that is at the heart of investors being able to take risk and understanding their risks. Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Chairwoman, my time is up, and I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development, and Insurance, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I thank all of our guests for being here. Chair Gensler, thank you for all the work you have done over the years, and I appreciate your presence here today. My great-grandpa, Reverend Noah Albert Cleaver, died in 1980. He was 103. He used to say--some new invention would come out, whether it was a toaster or a microwave, and he would say, ``What are they going to do next?'' And he was concerned. He thought that the people landing on the moon created a bunch of weather problems in Texas. I never could get that out of his head. But sometimes, I am tempted to join in with my Grandpa on stuff. Going back to Mr. Scott's discussion with you earlier, I have to tell you, I do have a lot of concerns, and maybe it is just something I am going to have to learn to live with. But let me give you an example. The shares in Metro Bank in the UK, back in May, their shares fell over 10 percent before Metro could get control of the fake news about their financial free fall, and they are fortunate that it didn't go further. I am extremely concerned about what is going on in regulations and what we need to do to ensure that social media doesn't take control of our lives and take it in a direction that could be detrimental to our democracy. Do you share that concern, and if so, what should we do, and how do we address the issue that was just experienced with Metro Bank? Mr. Gensler. I think that the best way is to be technology- neutral but recognize that technologies in each generation provide us new ways to communicate, even as to when the telephone came along and there were debates about whether to allow the first telephone on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. These are real debates that happened in the 1920s. I think technologies will come along in the 2020s, and we have to ensure we still stick to our principles of investor protection; fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and capital formation. So, we have to lean in at the SEC and learn how to basically be a cop on the beat so that free speech goes on but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market or spoof a market or put fraudulent information into a social media channel, that we protect investors against that. And particularly in this new computer age, that is more challenging. I think the SEC is up to the challenge, but it is definitely more challenging, and I have asked the folks at the SEC, how do we freshen up our rules in this new environment? Mr. Cleaver. Do you have a division that works on this, that thinks about this, that plans for this, that goes through all kinds of scenarios on what to do when this happens, anticipating an anticipatory department? Mr. Gensler. No. Again, I am only in my third week, but I think between our Trading and Markets Division, our Enforcement Division, and our Examinations Division, it is through those units. But I think we constantly have to be evaluating, and to an earlier question, even, about Regulation Best Interest, we are going to vigorously get the most out of regulation best interest, but we are also going to evaluate. If it is not serving the purpose of investors, then we will update and freshen that rule as well as other rules, because we always have to be evaluating that investors come first, aligned with our three-part mission. Mr. Cleaver. Let me congratulate you on your confirmation, and I do recognize that you just walked in the door, and I am asking you some questions that you probably need a little more time to deal with. But I am hoping that, on a night when you are about to get a peaceful night's rest, you will remember the questions raised by Congressman Cleaver about the markets and practice paranoia with the SEC, because I am really afraid of some bad stuff happening. I am hoping I am wrong, but I am glad you are there, and I look forward to you fixing some things. Mr. Gensler. Thank you, and I wish I had met your grandfather. My mother would say that out of a space journey, the best thing that came out of it was Velcro. Mrs. Gensler thought that was the best thing that came out, so there you go. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen, very much. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Luetkemeyer, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and welcome to our witnesses. Mr. Gensler, in September of 2018, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the NCUA, the OCC, and the CFPB all issued an interagency statement that clarified the differences between supervisory guidance and laws and regulations. Most notably, that supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law, and that the law and regulations does. In January of this year, the prudential regulators issued a final rule to confirm the difference of regulations and guidance by codifying the 2018 statement. While I understand the SEC operates differently from the regulators I just mentioned, in many key ways, it is still imperative that the SEC distinguishes between guidance and rule or law. Do you agree that distinguishing between guidance and rules is an essential proponent of sound regulation? Mr. Gensler. Thank you for that question, and I look forward to working with their Office of General Counsel to better understand what the bank regulators did in that circumstance. But there is a difference between rules that have gone through notice and comment and staff guidance, and that is something I am familiar with from my prior service in government as well. Mr. Luetkemeyer. I guess you maybe answered this question here, but will you commit to issuing a final rule similar to the prudential regulators that clarifies the role of guidance and ensures that enforcement actions will only be based on violations of rule or law? Mr. Gensler. Again, sir, I need to meet with staff, understand what the SEC has done in the past on this, and whether there is an appropriate need for such new rules, as you say. But I do understand rules as duly operating from Congress, delegated to the agencies, I understand are different than guidance. But I would look to work with you and understand your concerns better. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Very good. Thank you for that. Chairman Gensler, as you know, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the ability of the SEC to accept generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that have been established by a private entity. While I believe that private standard-setter can help facilitate the effective accounting principles that promote transparency for investors, recent actions by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and an overall lack of oversight by any regulatory entity whatsoever, have raised serious concerns regarding the standard-setting process and FASB's ability to conduct proper analysis before finalizing a standard. In my opinion, since the SEC has given FASB the authority to operate as a private standard-setter, the SEC should ensure FASB is carrying out its duties in an appropriate manner. Can you broadly tell me what you think the relationship between the SEC and FASB is, and should be? Mr. Gensler. I think Congress has been clear, as I understand it, that the securities markets benefit by disclosure, and that includes accounting disclosure, and the SEC has that authority. And then through, I believe it was in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, working with Senator Mike Oxley from your committee and Paul Sarbanes on the side, put in place exactly what you said, a provision that there could be reliance on a standard-setter meeting certain goals. But our Office of the Chief Accountant has an important role in communicating with FASB on these important accounting standards, and at the SEC, our congressional system is at the top of that chain. Mr. Luetkemeyer. My concern, quite frankly, is with their ability to implement something like current expected credit losses (CECL), which they did not do any standard-setting studies about. They just arbitrarily went out there and decided, in their own wisdom, that this was something that they should be doing. All of the other government agencies out there that affect what we do every day, how we administer the rules and regulations every day and the laws of this country, have to go through the Administrative Procedure Act. They do not. Would you support something along the line to rein them in, so to speak, so that maybe they would fall under the Administrative Procedure Act and have to do qualitative and quantitative studies before they can issue a rule or regulation that would protect the economy, protect the industry, protect the people, consumers, from a bad rule or regulation that they might implement? Mr. Gensler. Congressman, I would like to meet with you and your staff to better understand your concerns, because as I understand it, what Congress decided some 20 years ago in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was that it is best to rely [inaudible] SEC to rely on an outside standard-setter, and that that helped sort of set them apart a bit. So, the concerns that you are speaking about, I would like to better understand, and see how we can address them as best we can. Mr. Luetkemeyer. I thank you for your answers, sir, and I look forward to working with you on this at length. I think it is a very serious concern there that I have with regards to these folks. With that, Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. Thank you very much. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. The gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. Maloney, who is also the Chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Maloney. Thank you, Chairwoman Waters. Chairman Gensler, it is great to have you before the committee once again, and to have you as the Chair of the SEC. I have a few questions. First, I want to ask you about a very important issue that I worked on for several years, and that is forced arbitration. A few years ago, some people were pushing public companies to include forced arbitration provisions in their corporate governance documents, which would prevent their own shareholders from suing them for securities fraud in Federal court. If the SEC allowed this, it would essentially be the end of all security fraud cases in Federal court, and shareholders wouldn't be able to hold companies accountable in court. So, I led a letter with Chairwoman Waters to then-SEC Chairman Clayton, which was signed by every Democrat on this committee, strongly opposing this move, which would reverse the Commission's longstanding position that such forced arbitration provisions violate Federal securities law. And because this effort came so close to succeeding, I think it is very important to get you on the record on this issue. So my first question is, do you believe it would violate Federal securities law if a public company inserted a forced arbitration provision into its bylaws and governance documents? Mr. Gensler. It is really good to see you, and to work with you again. Mrs. Maloney. Likewise. Mr. Gensler. I think, again, I need to get more fully briefed on the law, but let me say, on the spirit and where the SEC has been, the SEC has said consistently to issuers, as I understand it, that it would be best not to put this into these corporate charters. And I think that the American public needs to be able to have redress in their courts, and that is sort of a fundamental piece, to be able to go straight to the courts. And that has been true in terms of issuers for decades, and I think that has worked well. Mrs. Maloney. That is great to hear, and it is a very important signal to investors and the confidence in the U.S. capital markets, and I thank you for that position. Next, I want to talk to you about GameStop. In this committee's initial hearing on the GameStop frenzy, I questioned whether our capital markets were working for all investors or just for some investors, and I emphasized the need to have rules that are consistent, predictable, and, very importantly, enforceable. What struck me the most about Robinhood's behavior regarding the GameStop frenzy was the seemingly arbitrary nature of its trading faults and the lack of transparency on the front and back ends of how and why Robinhood and other broker-dealers imposed these restrictions. So, Chair Gensler, not speaking specifically to Robinhood's situation but broadly speaking, do you believe broker-dealers should improve their transparency with their customers about how and when they impose trading halts, and what role do you believe the SEC should play in improving these disclosures and ensuring trading halts are integrated into firms' risk management plans? Mr. Gensler. I think that probably what we could all agree on is that access to markets, whether you are an individual investor trading one share or a big institution, access to markets as they are moving up and down is a really critical piece of our capital markets. And what happened on January 27th and 28th was not good for millions of investors. So, the transparency you mentioned is important between broker-dealers and their customers, and we have asked, and I think Robert Cook has said already, that maybe they are looking at this too, is what is that transparency between, and under what circumstances? And do each of the broker-dealers have enough liquidity to meet their requirements with the clearinghouse, which Michael Bodson was talking about earlier. Mrs. Maloney. Thank you. And next, I would like to turn to the topic of corporate board diversity. Along with Chairman Meeks, I have made fighting for women a hallmark of my time in public service, fighting for equal pay, for equal work, to bring our family leave policies into the 21st Century, for Equal Right Administration, and I just left a hearing on maternal Black health. Mr. Meeks and I have also strongly advocated for measures to diversify the ethnic, racial, and gender composition of corporate boards and in executive ranks, because leaders set the tone and they set the priorities. From your perspective, does improving diversity on corporate boards bring a material benefit to companies? Mr. Gensler. I can speak just in terms of what we are doing at the agency, and I do believe that diverse points of view, diverse backgrounds help in decision-making, and we are leaning into that in terms of building a senior leadership at the SEC. Mrs. Maloney. Thank you. My time has expired. Chairwoman Waters. The gentlelady's time has expired. The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And before I begin, I would like to submit for the record a letter from the Private Investor Coalition. Chairwoman Waters. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Huizenga. Thank you. Mr. Cook, my colleague from New York was talking a little bit about arbitration and what that would mean. And I am curious if arbitration clauses were banned in customer contracts, do you perceive potentially negative consequences on that, and what would those potentially be? Mr. Cook. Thank you for that question, Congressman Huizenga. I believe that if the current status of these clauses requiring arbitration--I just want to be clear that is not something that FINRA currently imposes; that is something that happens as a matter of contract. And FINRA does not have authority right now to address that. That is something that the SEC has authority to address. Mr. Huizenga. No, I understand that. I understand that FINRA does provide faster, less expensive ways to resolve disputes, correct? Mr. Cook. I think we work hard to administer an arbitration program that is fair for investors, that is prompt, that is-- Mr. Huizenga. I understand. So, you are not willing to say whether there would be a negative impact on that. Okay, I am going to move on. Mr. Gensler, it's good to have you back, and I appreciate this time. I am going to ask you a pretty quick, simple question: Is market participation akin to gambling in a casino? Mr. Gensler. It is good to see you, and thank you for the call earlier this week. I think market participation is investing and it takes risk, and material disclosure behind that risk is important, and the cop on the beat is there to protect against fraud and manipulation. So I would consider it part of that capital formation and part of risk taking. Mr. Huizenga. I do not want to put words in your mouth, but I do want to be clear. So, it is not like gambling in a casino? Mr. Gensler. It is risk taking, and risk taking can be in different forms, but I am trying to choose my words carefully. The risk in capital markets is something where Congress has said, let's ensure that there is no fraud and manipulation in those risk-taking markets. Mr. Huizenga. Reclaiming my time, I understand. We have some people who are trying to portray this as literally walking in and letting chance decide whether you are going to walk out a winner or a loser. That is very different than taking a calculated risk. Very quickly, I want to touch on BDCs, and how the acquired fund fees and expenses disclosure requirements distort the operating costs of those. And will the Commission prioritize trying to fix the acquired fund fees and expenses (AFFE) disclosure requirements here very shortly? Mr. Gensler. Again, maybe it is just because I am in my third week, and you used some letters with which I am not familiar-- Mr. Huizenga. BDCs are business development companies. Mr. Gensler. Oh, I'm sorry. I still need to get a briefing, and I look forward to working with you and your staff to understand that better in terms of the fee disclosure that is important to our public markets. Mr. Huizenga. Okay. We are happy to get you that information, and I want to continue that conversation. Earlier in the hearing, you had talked about cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges, and you said that, ``Only Congress can bring greater regulatory protection to crypto exchanges.'' And I am curious, if Congress is needed for crypto exchanges, why would it not be necessary for Congress to be involved in specific regulations when we are talking about the environment and social issues and governance? It seems to me that those may not be appropriate just for the SEC to be doing on its own. Does it not need congressional involvement? Mr. Gensler. I think that at the heart of our securities laws are disclosures, and from the 1930s, the SEC has had robust authority to ensure that investors have the disclosures that investors wish to have to make their investments. So in that regard, I do think that there is the authority to move forward on climate and human capital and other-- Mr. Huizenga. Reclaiming my last moments here, acting Chair Lee, at one point, implied that people attack companies that [inaudible] care about climate should not donate to Republicans and face securities liability and perhaps even SEC enforcement. I would hope that would not be the attitude of the SEC, moving forward. With that, I yield back, and I look forward to continuing the conversation. Mr. Gensler. Thank you. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. The gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Perlmutter. Thanks, Madam Chairwoman. It's good to see all of you. I have two specific questions I want to start with. One involves delisting what would be penny stocks, if you will, and the second involves diversity and inclusion, and then I'll get into some general questions. So, Mr. Gensler, back in 2005, in response to changing market structure and then new technology, the SEC adopted amendments to the penny stock rule that, among other things, requires the stock to have a minimum bid price of $4 a share to initially be listed on a national exchange. And in addition, the SEC has classified penny stocks as securities trading with a value of less than $5. GameStop's stock traded under $4 back in 2019, and then hovered between $4 and $5 throughout 2020, until the end of 2020, when it began to tick up and then went skyrocketing starting in mid-January. In Colorado, we used to be the penny stock capital of the world, and a lot of abuses occurred during that timeframe. Would you agree with my concerns about the potential to manipulate low-priced stocks? Mr. Gensler. Yes. There has been a long history. The lower the price, the lower the aggregate market value. Fraudsters find that more appealing. And, in fact, earlier this year the SEC took actions to delist, I think it was about 30 entities that fell into these various categories. Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. With so many more retail investors coming to the market through mass platforms like Reddit and other ways, do you think it would be timely for the Commission to examine whether the rules around penny stocks, including exchange listing standards for these stocks, need to be updated? Mr. Gensler. I think you raise a very good set of concerns, and now I have some more work to ask the staff to look at just what are the current roles, how did they affect what happened in the spring or late winter, and even how it relates to broader subjects in the markets. Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. Thanks. My second question primarily goes to you, Mr. Gensler, and it is a follow-up from Mrs. Maloney's diversity questions. It is a question that was raised to me by a friend of mine, so I am going to ask it, just as he presented it to me. When you were Chair of the CFTC, you did not have any Black division directors at that agency. Will you commit to doing better on this point in your current role at the SEC? Mr. Gensler. Well, not to fuss with your friend, but I actually hired the first Chief Operating Officer who is African American in the history of the CFTC. He has done just a terrific job, and he is still there, by the way. But yes, the answer is yes, sir. Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. Thank you. To all of you, I am perplexed by this whole GameStop thing. In 2019 and 2020, it was at $4. On January 7th, it was at $17, on January 27th, it was at $347, on February 9th, it was at $50, and now it is bouncing around at around $162. So, I am concerned about the mass platform and the potential for hyping a stock in that way. I am concerned about the unfair advantage in order flow. And I am concerned about the potential harm from short sales. Mr. Cook, I will start with you. If you were to look at those three things, which one bothers you the most, or do any of them? Mr. Cook. I think those are all important areas of concern. We are looking at all of those areas. The one that I think is most novel at the moment and requires our real attention, and we look forward to working with the SEC on this, is the expanded use of online trading platforms, which, again, can really create better access to our markets and be very good for investors. But how do we make sure that, at the same time, they are being protected and that we are making sure that, especially as they may go towards complex products, that that is being properly overseen. Mr. Perlmutter. I would like to talk about the dropping down to T1. Do you think that takes some of the potential for fraud out of the system? Mr. Cook. Yes. I think that while we fully support reducing the settlement cycle, I am not sure that, in and of itself, is going to address those types of concerns that you raised. I just think-- Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. Thank you. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you. The gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Barr, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Barr. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I appreciate this hearing, especially these witnesses, whom I think bring a great deal of expertise to the topic. Let me start with Mr. Bodson, on GameStop, specifically. As you noted in your testimony, the temporary restrictions on trading by Robinhood and others were due to the additional collateral required by the DTCC, but those were extraordinary circumstances in an exceptionally volatile market. For the sake of retail investors, of course, we do not want to see, and generally speaking, halts in trading to happen frequently or ever again. I do appreciate your testimony that moving to an accelerated settlement could reduce margin requirements, and specifically, value at risk (VaR) charges up to 40 percent if we go to T+1. But can you describe how DTCC communicates with brokers regarding their collateral requirements, and specifically, are there ways to improve that communication, and otherwise increase transparency to mitigate the risk of repeating this kind of surprise margin call and what happened in January? Mr. Bodson. Thank you, Congressman. Our process for computing the margin and communicating such are as laid out in our rules. We conclude the market formula itself--there are margin guides. We have a form that they can use to estimate their margin. The calculation works overnight. Every day, it is run at the end of the trading day. It takes into consideration market volatility. It looks at specific security volatility, concentration of activity in certain securities. So, what you saw in GameStop was almost the perfect storm of going through these retail platforms where a lot of buy activity, massive buy activity, 130 times normal buy, and we saw it weeks before, in stocks that were moving around anywhere from 100 to 300 percent a day, and just highly volatile over this period of time. So, the margin calculation reflects the risk that the firm is presenting to us. That calculation is done overnight, and it is communicated the next day, automatically, by email generation. In the case of Robinhood, there was an additional charge, a capital premium, which was as a result of the fact that their margin requirement was in excess of their net capital, indicating that they were taking on more financial risk than we felt would be prudent. That charge was later waived, but the core margin charge of a billion-four, again, it is articulated in our rules, we give the client the tools. Transparency is something that we will always try to get better at, but we do believe that we provide those tools. Mr. Barr. Thank you very much. Moving to Chairman Gensler, congratulations on your confirmation. I look forward to working with you, sir. Let me just, briefly, this is a question that Mr. Luetkemeyer and also Mr. Lucas asked, and kind of bring them together, the regulation by enforcement question from Mr. Luetkemeyer, and the ESG disclosure question from Mr. Lucas. We don't want to see regulation by enforcement. We want to see notice-and-comment rulemaking wherever possible. On March 4th, the SEC announced its new Enforcement Task Force focused on climate, as was discussed earlier, in ESG issues. But it wasn't until March 15th that it issued a request for public comment, and the SEC has not completed its recently- announced review of the 2010 guidance. Chairman Gensler, can you explain the sequence? In other words, why is the announcement of a new focus on enforcement coming before market participants know the rules, and will you commit to adhering to requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act in completing a notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to engagement in any enforcement actions? Mr. Gensler. I am committed to complying with the Administrative Procedure Act on rulemaking, and I said, in this hearing and in my confirmation process, I think the market investors do want to bring some consistency and comparability to climate disclosure, human capital disclosure, and moving out and getting that comment. But there are rules of the road that are already in place-- the guidance from 2010, our overall securities laws--and we are going to be vigorously enforcing the laws and rules that are in place, as they are in place. But yes, I am committed to using notice and comment for new rules, but we still have to enforce the old guidance and old rules as vigorously as you would want us to. Mr. Barr. Thank you, and I don't have time for this question, but I am going to be talking to you about horse racing, Chairman Gensler. I represent the horse industry in Kentucky, and we have a Reg A problem. We want to democratize ownership of securities in racehorses, and I look forward to working with you and the Commission on that issue. Mr. Gensler. I look forward to that, a different issue than GameStop. Mr. Barr. That is right, and we just finished the Kentucky Derby, so it is a timely issue. I yield back. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. The gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Himes, who is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy, is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Himes. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you to our witnesses. It is a real pleasure for me to see all three of you before the committee. Chair Gensler and Mr. Cook, I am glad you are our cops on the beat. You have, in your careers and today, distinguished yourselves for your balanced approach and really intelligent approach to the issues. And Mr. Bodson, it is great to see you. Kudos to you. When the chant from both ends of the political spectrum was, ``Let them trade,'' kudos to you for pointing out that the trading stops were actually part of the system architecture designed to keep disaster and catastrophe from happening. We do not let airplanes fly in horrible thunderstorms, and there will be times when we need to just stop and pause the markets for prudential reasons. I want to reflect on a lot of thoughts on GameStop. There has been a lot said. And, as usual, we have sort of devolved into a little of a silly, partisan conversation on the topic. We ought to be able to agree, as I think we do, that investing is a critical part of asset accumulation for American families. We ought to be able to agree--I have a little problem with my good friend, Mr. Huizenga, on this--that investing done irresponsibly--that is to say, without research, without thought, around companies that you didn't know about--will, in fact, result in a return that begins to look a little bit like the return you will assuredly receive in a casino or on the horse track. So, I think our objective is how do we maximize the former--good, smart investing--and maybe discourage the latter, that is to say, investing that actually ends up hurting retail investors. And the facts are pretty clear on what behavior leads to them being hurt. This is a question for Mr. Gensler and Mr. Cook. Having really looked at what happened with GameStop, I am satisfied that the market will fix itself in the sense that when we do return to a bear market, some people are going to learn some fairly expensive lessons about the fact that the stock market is a risky place to put your money. And that will all be good. Where I get concerned, though, is when you start talking about a lot of complexity, and, in particular, leverage, margin, option strategies that I am really pretty certain that most of us, much less the average retail investors, don't understand. My question, I guess for Mr. Cook and Mr. Gensler, is, is there a point where you are employing leverage or synthetic leverage through margin or through derivatives that we should begin to think about restricting the ability of retail investors to employ those strategies? I do not need to remind the committee that we all know the story of Mr. Alex Kearns, who took his own life because he traded in some fairly complicated option strategies and discovered that he had created a liability for himself that he had not anticipated. So my question is, is there a line around leverage or complexity, where we ought to not let the market teach touch lessons? Mr. Gensler. I will go first, and I am sure Robert will want to add something. I do think that our core mission is protecting investors, and for a long time we have said to open an options account, there is more discussion between a broker and that customer. Suitability used to be the word, and if I have the word wrong, I apologize, in my third week. But basically, they are taking more risk. I would also add, in terms of these apps, these applications that have made it easier to open accounts, and making it easier, we have lost that human in the middle saying, ``Is this appropriate? Is this risk appropriate?'' The thing that is like those buildings in Las Vegas and Atlantic City is that through gamification, you are using psychological prompts and behavioral prompts to get investors to trade more, and trading more, economic studies show, doesn't necessarily mean getting better returns. I wanted to add that, if I could, Congressman Himes, but I know Robert wants to-- Mr. Himes. Yes, thank you. Mr. Cook, do you have anything to add to that? Mr. Cook. Thank you for that question. I do think it is a matter of striking the right balance, because, as you say, there are lots of risks that people may be taking on, it is two complex products, margin, and we do"
