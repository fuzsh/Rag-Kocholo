        "text": "Enterprise Data Management (EDM) solutions provider GoldenSource announced today the launch of GoldenSource ESG Impact, a new ESG data solution for sell side and buyside investors, offering data comparison, quality checks, and portfolio screening.\n\nVolker Lainer, VP of Product Management and Regulatory Affairs at GoldenSource said:\n\n“As ESG has grown market participants have had to sift through an overwhelming amount of information from multiple sources, each with its particular content strengths and refined methodology to provide valuable insights. Our solution means that not only will users be able to discover and compare more useful ESG metrics and granular data across multiple sources, but also check the ESG metrics through a data quality framework. This will help navigate the changing regulatory environment and the challenges with discerning what is truly considered a ‘sustainable’ investment and what conforms to a published ESG strategy.”\n\nAccording to GoldenSource, the new solution offers full depth and breadth of ESG data coverage through a large network of ESG data provider partners and content specialists, with inbound APIs enabling on-boarding of current and future structured and unstructured ESG content from new data sources. The solution supports all standard and data vendor-proprietary materiality maps, enabling buy and sell-side firms to compare what the different data providers consider useful information, regarding specific ESG criterion in a given industry sector.\n\nAdditionally, through the underlying GoldenSource platform, the solution enables portfolio screening, enabling users to seamlessly look through portfolios to instruments and their issuing legal entities to related ESG content.\n\nJohn Eley, CEO of GoldenSource said:\n\n“This is a breakthrough as the growing volumes and increasing need for ESG data makes the investment landscape more complex. The solution is built on a foundation of market leading data management capabilities, but also GoldenSource’s experience in modelling ESG attributes, which makes it mature for this area of the financial markets. As part of our wider offering, GoldenSource ESG Impact slots in to create a bridge from the portfolio to the ESG content that otherwise portfolio managers would need to do themselves, making investment decision making more efficient.”"
