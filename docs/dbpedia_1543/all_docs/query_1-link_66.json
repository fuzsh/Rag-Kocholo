        "text": "Today, we are shedding a spotlight on 4-Time World Series Winner, 5-Time All-Star, Grammy-Nominated Artist, Billboard Best-Selling Act, New York Yankees Legend and World-Renowned Jazz Guitarist Bernie Williams.\n\nBernie Williams Performs at Millbrook Winery on Saturday, August 3rd\n\nBernie Williams brought his talents to Millbrook Winery this Saturday, August 3rd. Bernie and I discuss his final season as a Yankee, his debut with the New York State Philharmonic, his partnership with Millbrook Winery, and his philanthropic work with organizations such as NAMM and Tune Into Lung Health.\n\nWATCH MY INTERVIEW WITH BERNIE WILLIAMS BELOW; PLUS EXCLUSIVE VIDEOS FROM THE CONCERT üëá\n\nThe \"Best New York City Jazz Club That No One Knew About\"\n\nMan, I wish we got this story in the interview. While talking to my dad and I after the interview, my dad asked about the rumors that Bernie and Paul O'Neill would have incredible jam sessions somewhere in Yankees Stadium. Bernie confirmed the jam sessions, and said it was a highlight of his Yankee career. He said that early on in his Yankee career, he heard drums coming from the \"Paint Room,\" an extra storage room in Yankee Stadium which was filled with old paint buckets and cans. He found O'Neill jamming out to a \"John Mellancamp, Rolling Stones-esque kind of groove.\"\n\nFormer Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry would play the drums during his off times. When he left the Yankees, he left the drum kit there, and Paul O'Neill adopted it. Bernie asked Paul if he could bring his guitar in sometime and if they could jam. From that moment on, Bernie and Paul would take any moment they could to play in the Paint Room. Bernie said he and Paul would sneak in there after batting practice, during rain delays, and between double headers. Bernie went on to say they would invite other musicians to jam with them, even namedropping Bon Jovi's former guitarist Richie Sambora. Bernie said it was the \"Best New York City Jazz Club that no one knew about.\"\n\nBernie Williams Returns to Millbrook Winery for a Summer Lawn Concert\n\nBack by popular demand, Millbrook Vineyards & Winery (Millbrook Winery) announced it would host its annual jazz concert featuring a live performance by former New York Yankees centerfielder and jazz music icon, Bernie Williams and his Band of Friends with an opening act by renowned jazz pianist Larry Ham on Saturday, August 3, 2024. Building on past vintages of a custom wine blended by Williams and Millbrook Winery‚Äôs head winemaker, Ian Bearup, a third vintage of Bernie‚Äôs Blend red wine will debut the evening of the concert.\n\nBefore the concert, my dad and I grabbed some Fajita Bowls from Dave's Global and then some Cheesecake from Cheesecake Heaven! Both amazing! Not to mention, we got to try variations of Bernie's Blend. My favorite was the Chardonnay! And again, I got to give a huge thank you to Impact PR, Millbrook Winery, and Bernie Williams team for making this possible, and allowing my dad and I to meet the legend himself before the show!\n\nDespite the rain on Saturday, people were ready for the concert rain or shine. Larry Ham played through the rain, and sounded amazing! People were huddled under their umbrellas out in the field, or under the patio. By the time Bernie got on stage, the rain was mostly over. People were up and dancing in no time! Bernie, his band, and his management team were so amazing to work with. Bernie is so down to earth, and just a pleasure to speak with!\n\nThe dynamic blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc will once again be adorned by custom artwork created by Williams‚Äô daughter, Brooklyn-based artist Beatriz Williams. The label artwork depicts a still-life of some of her father‚Äôs favorite things ‚Äì baseball, music, and wine ‚Äì and signed prints of the artwork will be for sale at the Winery the evening of the concert.\n\nBernie William's Millbrook Winery Partnership Benefits NAMM\n\nAfter retiring from the New York Yankees in 2006, Williams earned a Bachelor of Music degree in jazz performance from the Manhattan School of Music and has enjoyed a successful second act as a jazz musician. Passionate about giving back to the arts, a portion of all Bernie‚Äôs Blend wine sale proceeds will be donated to the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation‚Äôs SupportMusic Coalition, which unites non-profit organizations, schools and businesses, ensuring that music education is supported in communities everywhere. The NAMM Foundation, a cause near and dear to the Williams family, frequently supports local music programs and school districts throughout the Hudson Valley community.\n\n‚ÄúBlending my passion for wine and jazz music, and my daughter‚Äôs artistic talent, makes our partnership with Millbrook Winery incredibly fulfilling,‚Äù said Williams. ‚ÄúAnd to do so while supporting the NAMM Foundation and its essential support of music education programs has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBernie and I share a respect for the craft of winemaking,‚Äù expressed Bearup. ‚ÄúEach year our collaboration deepens resulting in an exceptional and unique wine, which is reflected beautifully in this year‚Äôs vintage.‚Äù\n\n\"We are incredibly proud to continue our partnership with Bernie Williams and have him take the stage for the third year in a row at Millbrook Winery,\" said Bova. \"Each year, 'Bernie's Blend' captivates our customers ‚Äì thanks to the wine‚Äôs dynamic blend and Beatriz‚Äôs stunning label artwork ‚Äì and we‚Äôre confident this year‚Äôs vintage will do the same.‚Äù\n\nBernie‚Äôs Blend is currently available via the Millbrook Winery website: www.millbrookwine.com. A rain date is scheduled for Sunday, August 4, 2024. The Bernie Williams concert is one of eleven in Millbrook Winery‚Äôs summer jazz concert series, running from June 22 through August 31. A full concert schedule can be found on their website.\n\nTune Into Lung Health\n\nBernie Williams‚Äô life was forever changed after losing his father to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a common type of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which causes scarring of the lungs, called pulmonary fibrosis. Moved by the loss of his father, Bernie began advocating for ILD awareness and education in 2017 through the Breathless¬Æ campaign. In recent years, Breathless¬Æ has taken inspiration from Bernie‚Äôs musical roots and leveraged the universal language of music to bring attention to these diseases.\n\nResearch shows that music can help people cope with negative feelings and anxiety, which may occur in people living with ILD and can even affect loved ones and caregivers. Breathing exercises‚Äîsimilar to breathing techniques for singers‚Äîalso can potentially help improve breathlessness, a common symptom of many types of ILD.\n\nInspired by his personal experience as a musician and ILD caregiver, Bernie teamed up with celebrity vocal coach Eric Vetro to introduce Tune In To Lung Health¬Æ, the next chapter in the Breathless¬Æ story. The program is designed to raise awareness of ILD and show how music and breathing may help people cope with the mental, emotional, and physical burden of these rare lung conditions.\n\nAbout Millbrook Winery\n\nEstablished in 1982 on a former dairy farm in New York's Hudson River Valley, Millbrook Vineyards & Winery produces a range of high-quality wines.

His story is truly a tale of two coasts! We discuss how his experience on the West Coast has helped to elevate his winemaking skills, and innovate the New York wine scene! Ian and I also go into Millbrook Winery‚Äôs upcoming events like their annual Summer Jazz concert series, featuring the performance from former New York Yankee turned jazz musician, Bernie Williams!\n\nPrevious Townsquare Spotlight Interviews\n\nWelcome to Townsquare Spotlight!
