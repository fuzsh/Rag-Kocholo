By integrating BRACS with other technology solutions within your firm, the need for multiple data entry points is greatly reduced, data quality is increased, and BRACS can become a golden source of Customer and Account data for your firm.\n\nBRACS is currently enhancing our Account Opening and Maintenance workflow to add a bi-directional exchange of data between systems.\n\nThis integrated enterprise solution can bring Customer and Account data into BRACS from completed and approved forms originating in your 3rd party document workflow system and/or CRM. These feeds can bring in client compliance information, which is a critical data element missing from most Transfer Agent feeds.\n\nMaintenance on Customers will happen in BRACS, either by the Home Office or reps in the field.\n\nChanges made to Customer Records are reviewed and approved by the Home Office using the BRACS workflow, then sent to external systems (such as clearing firms and CRM’s). This exchange of data makes Customer data consistent across all databases within your firm.\n\nThis automated solution reduces manual entry, eliminates errors and reconciles data against multiple systems within your firm, supporting your organization with delivering on your brand of relationship quality with your Financial Professionals and their customers."
