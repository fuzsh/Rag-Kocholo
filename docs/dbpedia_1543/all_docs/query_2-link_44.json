Administrators can use the golden configuration as a master version to compare device configurations and report discrepancies.\n\nUsers belonging to the administrators and LIAdministrators group can create, edit, and delete the Golden configuration. Other users can create, view, download, and delete the configuration comparison report.\n\nPrerequisites for Creating a Golden Configuration\n\nAs an Administrator user, you can create a Golden Configuration for a managed device by selecting the managed device, or by using an archived configuration, or an external file. Ensure that you have read this information before starting the procedure.\n\nCreating a Golden Configuration Using Managed/Associated Device Option\n\nIf you are creating the Golden Configuration using the Managed/Associated Device option, ensure that the device is associated with the Oracle Session Element Manager. For more information, see Associate Devices with Session Element Manager. You can create the Golden Configuration uisng the Managed Device option for only such devices that are associated with the Session Element Manager.\n\nCreating the Golden Configuration Using the Archived Configuration Option\n\nIf you are creating the Golden Configuration using the Archived Configuration option, make sure that the backup configuration is available for the associated device. The backup configurations can be seen under Archive Configuration under the Configuration Manager slider. For more information, see Add a Backup Schedule.\n\nCreating the Golden Configuration Using the External Files Option\n\nIf you are creating the Golden Configuration using the Upload External files option, make sure that the file is an XML or Gzip file, with a valid file name - the file name cannot contain spaces and can only contain letters, numbers, an underscore, or a hyphen. The configuration file must be of the same plugin and same platform type as that of the Golden Configuration.\n\nCreating the Golden Configuration\n\nAs a user belonging to the Administrator or LI administrator groups, you can create the Golden Configuration so that users can use it as a basline configuration and identify network discrepancies by comparing it with network function configurations.\n\nYou can create only one Golden Configuration per managed device. You can use this Golden Configuration later to compare with multiple other configurations of the same plugin type and platform type identical to the Golden Configuration.\n\nFor more information on getting things ready for creating the Golden Cofiguration, see Prerequisites for Creating a Golden Configuration.\n\nExpand the Configuration Manager slider and click Configuration Comparison.\n\nClick Golden Configuration.\n\nIn the Golden Configuration page, click Create.\n\nField Description Golden Configuration Name Name of the Golden Configuration. The name must be a valid name and unique name without any space characters.\n\nA valid name can contain only letters, numbers, an underscore, or a hyphen. No blank space(s) are allowed, and the name should not start with 'ID'.\n\nDevice Association - Associate device from managed device Click to view the Select Managed Device dialog box which displays all devices added in SDM.\n\nSelect any one device.\n\nConfiguration selection - Golden Configuration Seeded from: Select the source to derive the Golden Configuration. You can select the configuration using any one of the three options:\n\nManaged/Associated Device: The Golden Configuation is seeded from the running configuration of the associated device that you selected in the previous row.\n\nArchived Configurations: Click this radio button to enable the Archived Configuration drop down list.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Archived Configuration drop-down list is enabled only if you select the Archived Configurations radio button.\n\nThe Archived Configuration drop down list displays a list of backup configurations of the associated device from the configuration archive. Select one backup configuration.\n\nUpload external files: Click this radio button to enable the Upload file field. Click the browse button to select an XML or GZip file with a valid name. In the Upload Configuration File window, provide information for the Category and Platform fields. The Category and Platform values must match with that of associated device selected in the previous row. For information on the supported Plugins and Platform, see Supported Plugins and Platforms.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nThe Golden Configuration for the selected managed device is created. You can view the list of Golden Configurations in the Golden Configuration page.\n\nHover the mouse pointer on any column header to select the sorting order, hide or show columns from the display.\n\nSupported Plugins and Platforms\n\nOne of the options to create a Golden Configuration is using Upload External Files. This option requires you to provide information on the Plugin and Platform type associated with the external file that you upload.\n\nWhy Do We Need Plugin and Platform Information\n\nWhen you create a Golden Configuration using the Upload External Files option, the uploaded configuration file does not contain details such as product type and platform. Hence, Plugin and Platform information must be added. In the uploaded configuration file, SDM cannot differentiate the product type. The list of Platforms and Plugins supported by SDM is given below:\n\nSupported Platforms\n\nThis table lists supported platforms in SDM.\n\nTable 3-1 Supported Platforms in SDM\n\nPlatform Comments AP4600 AP4250 Only SP Edge and core platform AP4500 AP6100 AP6300 AP6350 SP Edge, Enterprise Edge, and Core platform AP1100 Only Enterprise Edge and Core platform AP3900 AP3820 AP3800 Only SP Edge and Core platform NNOS NNOSVM\n\nSupported Plugins\n\nTable 3-2 Supported Plugins\n\nPlugin Enterprise Edge and core platform SP Edge and core platform\n\nEditing a Golden Configuration\n\nAs the Administrator, you can edit or overwrite an exisiting Golden Configuration.\n\nExpand the Configuration Manager slider and click Configuration Comparison.\n\nClick Golden Configuration.\n\nThe Golden Configurations page displays a list of all existing Golden Configurations.\n\nSelect the Golden Configuration that you want to edit.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nIn the Edit Golden Configuration <name> page, you can change the source of the Golden Configuration. However, you cannot change the name of the Golden Configuration and associated device fields. The process is identical to creating a new Golden Configuration.\n\nClick Update.\n\nDeleting Golden Configuration\n\nAs the Administrator user, you can delete a Golden Configuration.\n\nDeleting Golden Configuration can be performed by the Administrator.\n\nClick the Configuration Manager slider and click Configuration Comparison.\n\nClick Golden Configuration.\n\nIn the Golden Configuration page, select the one that needs to be deleted.\n\nClick Delete. Click ok to confirm."
