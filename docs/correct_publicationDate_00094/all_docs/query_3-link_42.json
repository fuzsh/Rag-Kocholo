        "text": "What comes to mind when you hear the word “heist”? Perhaps a scene from Ocean’s Eleven, The Thomas Crown Affair, or Mission: Impossible. There are plenty of heist movies to choose from. But what about heist novels?\n\nA heist novel often offers a few different elements: a team with each individual bringing a specific strength to the table, intensive planning, and some kind of daredevilry. The crew might be a found family or complete strangers. The leader might be adored or reviled. The stakes are real; we want to know whether or not they’ll pull it off. Plus, they’re just plain fun!\n\nWhether you’re in need of a page-turner or looking to bust out of a reading slump, these heist novels fit the bill. They’re not all thrillers either—we’ve got a mix of genres so you can see the different ways a heist may feature in the story and how various characters approach planning and executing their caper.\n\n20 heist novels you won’t want to put down\n\nSome links (including all Amazon links) are affiliate links. More details here.\n\nFingersmith\n\nThis is on my TBR, and comes highly recommended by MMD editor Leigh Kramer. She inhaled the last 400 pages of this Dickensian literary mystery and had to know what would happen next. The relationship between gentry and servant can be fraught—and even more so when one is running a con on the other. Maud and Susan are complex characters that beg a reaction (and a book club discussion), particularly when they do disagreeable things. With striking twists and turns, their relationship runs the full gamut of emotions, particularly because literary fiction is not known for giving queer characters a Happily Ever After. More info →\n\nHarlem Shuffle\n\nRay Carney is a man caught between two worlds: he wants to be a respectable family man, but can't seem to evade the pull of the crime scene of 1960s Harlem, and its profits. While this is a heist novel, please know going in that it is carefully-constructed and slow-building, with rich character development and a sly sense of humor. Excellent on audio, as narrated by Dion Graham. More info →\n\nThe Great Train Robbery\n\nIf you love nonfiction narratives that read like novels, take a close look at this one! Crichton departs from his usual routine with this fast-paced true story of a game-changing robbery, unpacking how the colorful cast of robbers very nearly pulled off the crime of the century and what it meant to 19th century London. \"It is difficult,\" Crichton says in his introduction, \"to understand the extent to which the train robbery of 1855 shocked the sensibilities of Victorian England.\" More info →\n\nPortrait of a Thief\n\nFive Chinese American college students become justice-driven international art thieves in this Ocean’s Eleven-ish heist novel. When he’s made an offer he can’t refuse, MIT student Will Chen recruits four brilliant accomplices—all with looming midterms—to fulfill an audacious goal: to break into art museums in five countries, in order to steal back artifacts that were once wrongfully stolen from China. If they succeed, they’ll receive a life-changing $50 million payout. The heist storyline pops and fizzes, but Li crams in plenty of substance alongside her flashy plot: an exploration of identity and belonging, crushing familial expectations, desires, love, and calling, plus meaningful LGBTQ representation and the seamless integration of pandemic realities. Word to the wise: This reads more Hollywood than real life but you’ll enjoy the ride. More info →\n\nCress (Lunar Chronicles Book 3)\n\nThe third installment of the Lunar Chronicles follows the Rampion crew in their quest to stop Kai and Queen Levana’s wedding. They need hacker Cress’s help but first they’ll have to rescue her from the satellite she’s been imprisoned on since childhood. There's just one problem: they don't know that Levana ordered Cress to track down the Rampion crew! This series is a rollicking good time. More info →\n\nFlying Solo\n\nHolmes's warm-hearted sophomore novel is set, like her first, in the made-up harbor town of Calcasset, Maine. If you like the sound of a woman reevaluating what she really wants on the cusp of turning 40 (with plenty of When Harry Met Sally references), a second-chance romance with a sexy librarian, an older role model who lived an amazing life on her own terms, and a mystery subplot involving a beautiful duck decoy, this is the book for you. More info →\n\nThe Art Forger: A Novel\n\nWhat would you do if one of the stolen paintings from the infamous 1990 Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist was dangled in front of you? Claire reproduces famous works of art but she still longs to paint her own work. When a gallery owner asks her to forge one of the Degas masterpieces stolen from the Gardner in exchange for a show at his gallery, she agrees, only to get embroiled in a mystery spanning centuries when the real stolen Degas painting is delivered to her studio—and she suspects it might be a forgery too. She’ll have to outwit collectors and art thieves alike as she races to discover the truth. More info →\n\nCounterfeit\n\nNow THIS was a great reading experience. When I needed a good listen for a long road trip, I queued this up on a whim. By the time I got to my destination, I was done with the book—and the journey was fabulous! With a heist-esque vibe, the clever structure elevates the story. What really wowed me was the initially surreptitious and then all at once interrogation of the American Dream. I relished the details of the fashion industry and superfake handbags in particular. This was good, smart fun that made the miles fly by. More info →\n\nSix of Crows\n\nIn the first book of Bardugo's fantastical duology, a criminal mastermind teams up with an unconventional crew to pull off the heist of the century. They have to break into an extremely secure location and retrieve a scientist and his formula or the world as they know it will be destroyed. With twists and turns aplenty, I enjoyed experiencing another side of Bardugo’s Grishaverse. More info →\n\nThe Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi\n\nCity of Brass author Chakraborty kicks off a new trilogy with this spirited tale of a renegade pirate captain—who happens to be a middle-aged mother simply trying to enjoy her retirement.
