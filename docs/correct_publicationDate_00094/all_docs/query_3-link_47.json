Pirates, mermaids and witches in a spicy fantasy forbidden-ish romance about a monstrous priest looking for redemption in the wrong (or right) places (aka a siren named Larimar), on the good ship The Nightwind 🔥\n\n• July - The Runes of Ruin 😈 A standalone Viking and Norse mythology romantasy (as a Norwegian, I have been waiting forever to write this). Also our MC is Loki, a very bad, destructive, villainous god who is way worse than the MCU version, and I can’t wait to tell you more because this really is for those who simp for the villain, even when they’re supposed to kill them.🗡️(also calling all Rings of Power “Haladrial” fans that wish that raft scene went another way…)\n\n• September - The Royals Upstairs 👑 Published by Berkley/PHR, it’s a standalone rom com (ish) second-chance nanny + bodyguard romance spinoff of The Royals Next Door. It’s sweet and sexy and totally contemporary. Also set in Norway, like The Runes of Ruin (my Viking father would be proud)🫶🏻 🇳🇴 \n\n• Goddess of Light (Underworld Gods #4) 💀 The conclusion to the romantasy series about the Finnish Underworld 🇫🇮 and God of Death that gets epically epic as it goes out with a big bang 👏🏻💥\n\n- I will also be writing some things on my Ream subscription. I’m a bit behind at the moment with The Knight and his Queen ⚔️but will catch up soon, and I have a few more serializations to introduce later in the year! Including a long overdue book of mine that many have been waiting for that I will write as a monthly serial (and eventually one year when I am contractually able to, I will publish it as an official book too…but more on that later🧑🏻‍🦰👩🏻‍🦳🧑🏻‍🦰).\".",
