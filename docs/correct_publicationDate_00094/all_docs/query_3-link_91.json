        "text": "Why you should read it: I'm a huge fan of an enemies-to-lovers romance book, especially if it's in the fantasy genre. But Radiance quickly changed my mind. Best friends to lovers trope? There's something about you that just makes me swoon. Ildiko and Brishen are about to get married. When they first see each other, they both think the other one is ugly, but to keep their kingdoms safe, they agree to it anyway. What first starts as a marriage of convenience soon turns into a friendship that changes their lives forever. But assassination attempts, dark magic, and court life messes up their plans for a happily ever after.\n\nGet it from Amazon.\n\nWhy you should read it: If you loved the relationship between the Darkling and Alina in Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo, you will for sure love Adrian and Isolde in King of Battle and Blood. It's dark. It's steamy. It's full of high-stakes (if you know what I mean). Isolde is a human princess who needs to marry Adrian, the king of the vampires, in order for their kingdoms to be at peace. He's deadly and feared by many, but somehow Isolde is the only one who can make him let his guard down â€” to make him feel again. Living inside the vampire court is not going to be an easy thing to do, but Isolde is ready to use her knives when necessary.\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nWhy you should read it: The Plated Prisoner series is a fantasy series about a girl's journey to freedom, and it's definitely worth reading. Auren is someone everyone needs to meet, and you'll meet her when you start Gild, the first book in the series. I view Gild as a sort of prologue when it comes to Auren's journey. It's definitely the darkest installment in the series, so please read the content warnings below before you begin.\n\nThe Plated Prisoner series follows Auren, a young woman who has been kept inside a golden prison by King Midas. He once saved her, so she knows that safety means staying behind the gold bars. But when she finally steps outside those walls, outside that castle, she'll realize that she was led to believe lies and pretty words. The world hasn't treated her right, so this time, she'll show everyone what she's made of.\n\nContent warning for attempted rape/rape, violence, abuse, Stockholm syndrome, murder, grooming, and the topic of trafficking.\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nWhy you should read it: Whitten's debut fantasy novel showed us all that legends and myths make for a great love story. In For the Wolf, you get to meet Red, the Second Daughter who has been told all throughout her life that she's a sacrifice to the Wolf. She wasn't born a First Daughter, so she doesn't get to sit on the throne. Her life belongs to the monster who lives inside the woods. Two characters rooted in legends get to finally meet and find out for themselves if what they have been told was real. They are more than their legends. Together, they can create rather than destroy.\n\nContent warnings for self-harm for magic purposes, blood, emotional abuse, and gore.\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nRelease date: August 23, 2022\n\nWhy you should read it: This book reminded me of Zombieland (2009) but if it was made as a rom-com. It's the perfect mix of fantasy meets romance, and Bannen really knocked it out of the park. Mercy is an undertaker whose life revolves around her family business. Her days get worse whenever Hart, the grumpy marshal, walks through her door to deliver a dead body. Everyone knows they can't be in the same room without arguing, but because of their jobs, they have to see each other often. When Mercy receives an anonymous letter from \"A Friend,\" their relationship slowly changes, even though they don't realize they are the ones behind the writing.\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nWhy you should read it: One of my absolute favorite books of 2021, The Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels delivers in an enormous way. It's Pride and Prejudice meets Pirates of the Caribbean. Prim and proper Cecilia Bassingwaite is the ideal Victorian lady. But she's also a thief. She desires to be in the Wisteria Society crime sorority with all the other ladies who steal and acquire rare treasures. But alas it hasn't happened...yet. When the ladies of the Wisteria Society are suddenly kidnapped by pirates, Cecila takes that opportunity to show them that she's ready to become a true thief. Of course, this comes with the help of the sometimes-assassin, sometimes-pirate Ned (who has tried to kill her once...possibly twice already).\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nWhy you should be reading it: If what you need in your life is a cute little novella with spice and hilarious moments, nothing fits better than this book. Mistlefoe has the laughs, the adventure, the romance, and you are not ready for it. Once upon a time, Ruby's dad angered a powerful fox demon, so the fox demon cursed his whole family. Now all the weaponry they make can't stop making crude jokes! And no one wants to buy swords that can talk. Ruby decides to apologize to the fox demon, but he's not that easy to persuade. Although Lucca, the fox demon himself, does need a fake mate for this week-long festival.\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nRelease date: October 4, 2022\n\nWhy you should read it: The most chaotic holiday rom-com you will ever read!

Hall, with his magic, is ready to make every wish of hers come true!\n\nGet it from Bookshop or from your local indie bookstore via Indiebound here.\n\nWhy you should be reading it: We don't get a lot of merfolk romances around here, so when Holley Trent announced she was releasing one, the sun shone brighter for me that day. Brook Williams was taught to avoid drawing attention to herself, but when she saves a stranger from a careening truck, her life suddenly changes. The stranger she saves is none other than Cooper Koning, the future king of Souersland, and he thinks Brook should be the one to free him from his rise to the throne.

Except that's not what happens.\n\nGet it from Barnes and Noble.\n\nWhy you should be reading it: I constantly talk about this series because I truly believe it's perfect for every single person. Perfect for fans of superheroes. Perfect for fans of rom-coms. Perfect for fans of the found family trope.

But he doesn't do it for hope and prosperity â€” he wants to save his sister from the sickness sweeping the land. Though Fenton doesn't help anyone, he'll help Prior for something in return.
