        "text": "This book was long-listed for last year’s Booker Prize, but it was the imagining of the life of W Somerset Maugham that caught my eye. At one time Maugham was a prolific and hugely successful author, often setting his books in the exotic locations he visited. The stories are peppered with unhappy marriages and scandals, and here he probably drew on his own experiences. Dozens of movies have been based on the stories, the latest I have come across being The Painted Veil starring Edward Norton and Naomi Watts (2006).\n\nHis light may have faded in the last few decades, but Tan Twan Eng has brought Maugham to life again as one of two main characters in The House of Doors, set largely in Penang, Malaysia. It’s 1921 and Lesley, the wife of Robert Hamlyn, an old friend of the writer’s, is reluctantly hosting Maugham and his secretary/lover Gerald for an extended stay. Maugham, or Willie, as he’s called here, is at the height of his popularity, but poor investments have left him in a tight spot and desperate for material for new stories. Over the days that follow, Lesley reveals her own story from a decade before.\n\nLesley’s story takes us back to a visit by Sun Yat Sen, Chinese revolutionary and leader of the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party), in Penang to raise funds to overthrow a despotic Chinese dynasty. Lesley gets caught up in the cause, a distraction from problems with her marriage. In the meantime her best friend Ethel Proudlock has been charged with murder for shooting an expat engineer. Both stories suggest an uncomfortable relationship between men and women, as well as between the British rule with its wider expat community and the local Chinese and indigenous populations. (The Proudlock affair inspired Maugham’s story “The Letter”, which was made into a movie starring Bette Davis.)\n\nLesley is an interesting character as being born and raised in Penang she speaks one or two local languages and makes an effort to understand both worlds. So she’s the best person to show Maugham around, but takes a while to warm to the writer, feeling a little unhappy with him when she makes sense of his relationship with handsome and somewhat dissipated young Gerald. With Maugham you have insight into the mind of a writer, a man with his own share of disillusionment and regret.\n\nThe silence around us, the very weave of the night itself, felt denser. Even the waves outside, fraying away the margins of land since the beginning of the world, seemed to have stilled into stone. In the hallway the weighted heart of the grandfather clock went on beating, as indifferent as an aged monk thumbing his prayer beads on their long and infinite loop.\n\n‘Where does a story begin, Willie?’ I asked.\n\nFor a while he did not say anything. Then he shifted in his chair. ‘Where does a wave on the ocean begin?’ he said. ‘Where does it form a welt on the skin of the sea, to swell and expand and rush towards the shore?’\n\n‘I want to tell you a story, Willie,’ I said. Yes, I thought to myself. Tell him your story. Let him write it. Let the whole world know.\n\nThe music I had just played seemed to go on unspooling in the air between us, this song that had no beginning and no ending; the song of time itself.\n\nThe novel is a story within a story, bookended again by Lesley receiving a parcel in Africa many years later. You get a sense of a carefully constructed narrative and it all works beautifully, keeping the reader guessing and enthralled. Tan Twan Eng creates a superbly atmospheric setting enhanced by gorgeous writing. There’s a love story here, more than one perhaps, but it is also an ode to Penang in the way the characters experience the lush tropical setting, the sea that seems to brim with a life of its own, the history and culture.\n\nThe House of Doors is a beautiful novel, and at only 300 pages, carries a lot of story for its word-count. It’s quite an emotional read too – love and regret, nostalgia for a place and times past. So it really packs a wallop. I loved it and want to read everything by this author, though I see I shall have to be patient as this is only his third book – his first The Gift of Rain coming out in 2007, with a big gap between his second book, The Garden of Evening Mists from 2011 and The House of Doors, from last year. Whatever the wait, it will be worth it, I’m sure. This one’s a five-star read from me."
