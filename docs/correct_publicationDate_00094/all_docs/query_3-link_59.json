Magic mingles with the natural world in these 60+ fantasy books perfect for readers 8+!\n\nLalani of the Distant Sea\n\nFrom Newbery Medalist Erin Entrada Kelly! When Lalani Sarita’s mother falls ill, Lalani must leaver her home, Sanlagita, to find help on another island. But generations of men have died on the same quest — how can a timid 12-year-old girl survive the epic test of the archipelago? Will she succeed in her quest?\n\nThe Spinner of Dreams\n\nCursed at birth by the devious Fate Spinner, Annalise has always lived a solitary life with her loving parents. She does her best to ignore the cruel townsfolk of her desolate town — but the black mark on her hand won’t be ignored. There’s only one way for Annalise to rid herself of her curse: to enter the Labyrinth of Fate and Dreams and defeat the Fate Spinner. So despite her anxiety, Annalise sets out to undo the curse that’s defined her — and to show the world, and herself, exactly who she is inside.\n\nHomerooms and Hall Passes\n\nFive heroes from the mystical realm of Bríandalör who normally spend their days exploring temples and looting hoards of treasure find themselves magically transported into their weekly game of Homerooms and Hall Passes where they must band together to survive their toughest challenge yet: middle school\n\nThe Twelve\n\nUsagi was born in the year of the wood rabbit, and it’s given her extraordinary zodiac gifts. But she can never use them, not while the mysterious, vicious Dragonlord hunts down all those in her land with zodiac powers. Instead, she must keep her abilities — and those of her rambunctious sister Uma — a secret. After Uma is captured by the Dragonguard, Usagi can no longer ignore her powers. She must journey to Mount Jade with the fabled Heirs of the Twelve, a mystical group of warriors who once protected the land.\n\nDragonfell\n\nRafi Bywater is unlike anyone else. The people in his village don’t trust him because he spends too much time in an abandoned dragon lair. When a stranger, Mister Flitch, accuses Rafi of being “dragon-touched,” Rafi sets off to discover the truth about dragons — and about himself.\n\nOdd Gods\n\nOddonis may be the son of Zeus, but he’s a little bit…odd for a God.And if that isn’t enough, his twin brother Adonis is the most popular, most athletic, and most otherworldly handsome God of them all. Oddonis’s future at Mount Olympus Middle isn’t looking bright, especially when he makes the last-minute decision to run against Adonis to be class president.\n\nThe Secret of Zoone\n\nWhen a bright blue winged tiger appears on his aunt’s sofa, Ozzie can tell he’s in for an adventure. He’s thrilled to follow Tug — a skyger — through a secret door in the basement and into Zoone, the bustling Grand Central Station of the universe, where a thousand doors act as portals to strange and wonderful worlds. But some doors also hide dangers — and when the portal back to Earth explodes behind him, Ozzie gets more adventure than he bargained for.\n\nElementals\n\nTwins Anders and Rayna are elementals — shapeshifters who transform to either an ice wolf or a scorch dragon. The two elementals have always been sworn enemies, so when Anders transforms into an ice wolf, and Rayna into a scorch dragon, their family becomes divided as Rayna is taken away to be with the other cruel dragons who claim her as one of their own. To save his sister, Anders will do whatever it takes — even if it means betraying his own kind.\n\nEmber and the Ice Dragon\n\nEmber St. George is a dragon. At least she was before her adoptive father — a powerful but accident-prone Magician — turned her into a human girl to save her life. Unfortunately, Ember’s growing tendency to burst into flames at certain temperatures — not to mention her invisible wings — is making it too dangerous for her to stay in London. The solution: ship Ember off to her aunt’s research station in frigid Antarctica.\n\nBernard Pepperlin\n\nWhen a girl in a blue dress crashes the Mad Hatter’s eternal tea party, the sleepy Dormouse feels more awake than he has in a long time. He wishes he could follow her and be a part of her adventure. And as luck would have it, a surprising twist of fate sends the Dormouse on an adventure of his own, where he must not fall asleep. For he is destined to save a magical world outside Wonderland, and it will take all his courage — and a few new friends — to do it.\n\nThe School for Good and Evil\n\nWhen Sophie and Agatha are kidnapped and taken to the School for Good and Evil, golden Sophie gets dropped at the School for Evil and wicked Agatha at the School for Good. Though both girls believe there’s been a mistake, they must work together to figure out the mystery School Master’s riddle and make it home alive. Book four in this series just came out!"
