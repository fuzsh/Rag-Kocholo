        "text": "Joan Lyn Slonczewski is a microbiologist at Kenyon College and a science fiction writer. She is the first since Fred Pohl to earn a second John Campbell award for best science fiction novel, \"The Highest Frontier\" (2012); her previous winner was \"A Door into Ocean\" (1987). \"The Highest Frontier\" invents a college in a space habitat financed by a tribal casino and protected from deadly ultraphytes by Homeworld Security. According to Alan Cheuse at NPR, her book invents \"a worldwide communications system called Toy Box that makes the iPhone look like a Model-T Ford.\" Slonczewski's classic \"A Door into Ocean\" depicts an ocean world run by genetic engineers who repel an interstellar invasion using nonviolent methods similar to Tahrir Square. In her book \"Brain Plague,\" intelligent microbes invade human brains and establish microbial cities. She also authors with John W. Foster the leading microbiology textbook, Microbiology: An Evolving Science (W. W. Norton). Author blog: ultraphyte.com\n\nRead more Read less"
