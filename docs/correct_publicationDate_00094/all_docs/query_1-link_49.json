        "text": "I'm in grad school and looking for any literature I can find that involves ocean science, and it's even better if it's science fiction. Does anyone have anything they can recommend that's either a short story or novel? I have a list going but please help me out!\n\nThe Deep Range is a 1957 Arthur C. Clarke science fiction novel concerning a future sub-mariner who helps farm the seas. The story includes the capture of a sea monster similar to a kraken.\n\nIt is based on a short story of the same name that was published in April 1954, in Argosy magazine. The short story was later featured in Tales from Planet Earth and Frederik Pohl's Star Science Fiction No.3.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deep_Range\n\nIt's been decades since I read it. I don't recall how accurate the oceanographic information is relative to today's. I presume they thought water was wet back then.\n\nI know I liked the story. The Prince of Whales!\n\nI'm pretty sure I read this but I remember it less than The Deep Range.\n\nA Door into Ocean by Joan Slonczewski\n\nhttp://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/books/adoor_art/adoor_study.htm\n\nBut if it is about an imaginary ocean on another planet I don't know how relevant it would be to your objectives.\n\npsik\n\nSolaris is about an ocean on another planet.\n\nSilverberg has one that I've never read. I think it's called The Face of the Waters.\n\nJerry Pournelle has one or two short stories set in the ocean; minerals have been depeleted on Earth so people sift seawater for metals. One of those stories is in the collection High Justice.\n\nThe Ghost from the Grand Banks, also by Clarke, is about an attempt to refloat the Titanic for the 100th anniversary of its sinking in 2012.\n\nDavid Brin's Startide Rising (the second book, but frankly a far better starting-point than the first, in his Uplift Saga) has a spacecraft crashed at the bottom of the ocean with the crew trying to repair the ship whilst various alien races clash in orbit to see who gets to destroy them first.\n\nThere should be more nautical-flavoured SF (squid opera?) out there. The TV series seaQuest DSV was not great, but it did have a solid premise, with population pressures forcing the settling and colonisation of the ocean floor and super-submarines deployed to defend them. The classic 1980s computer game Carrier Command explored the idea of creating artificial island chains by tapping volcanic energy, as did the forgotten 2000 classic Hostile Waters (the story of which was penned by SF author Warren Ellis).\n\nGiven the problems inherent in settling and colonising space, more SF about exploiting the oceans would be (arguably) more realistic and welcome.\n\nThe Lazarus Effect, and The Ascension Factor. Granted they are the last two books in Herbert's WorShip series but good reads on their own. Lots of mutated humans and floating islands made out of organic matter. Good stuff.\n\nThose are the two books I'd recommend also, as both take place on Pandora, a planet that is entirely ocean. It's essentially a science experiment gone amuck.\n\nAlan Dean Foster, I forget the name. Drat! Ocean World? No, it is the best book in that area that I have ever read. The entire planet is basically a settlement won in a world court, paid to the whales and dolphins, who were found to be more intelligent than anyone ever imagined. So, to make up for screwing them, we give them a planet. All water, and way cool. Monsters, space ships.\n\nCDN\n\nStations of the Tide, by Michael Swanwick. The residents of Miranda are preparing for the \"Jubilee Tides,\" and come up with a way of halting the destruction that they also bring.\n\nOne of Asimov's Foundation books takes place on a planet around a Centauri sun that is all ocean save for one island. Foundation and Earth, IIRC. The humans there are trying to modify themselves to be water breathers.\n\nAlan Dean Foster, I forget the name. Drat! Ocean World? No, it is the best book in that area that I have ever read. The entire planet is basically a settlement won in a world court, paid to the whales and dolphins, who were found to be more intelligent than anyone ever imagined. So, to make up for screwing them, we give them a planet. All water, and way cool. Monsters, space ships.\n\nCDN\n\nIt's called Cachalot. It's a Humanx Commonwealth novel. Also in that series that is water related is Drowning World.\n\nHave a look at Hilbert Schenck's short stories in The Magazine of Fantasy & SF, melodiousone. Quite unknown outside the magazine on the whole and a fairly recent discovery for me.\n\n(List of stories HERE.)\n\nI believe his novel At the Eye of the Ocean may be sea-based too.\n\nHis 'real job' is in oceanography, as well.\n\nMark"
