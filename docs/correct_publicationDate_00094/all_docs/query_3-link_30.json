Five dazzling stars.”\n\n—Kristy Woodson Harvey, New York Times Bestselling author of THE SUMMER OF SONGBIRDS\n\n\"A tense and propulsive thriller, IT’S ONE OF US explores the dark truths of marriage, the lengths we go to hide our deepest secrets and the ways in which they find their way to the light.
