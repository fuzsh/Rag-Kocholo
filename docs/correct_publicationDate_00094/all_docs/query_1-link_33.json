        "text": "American writer\n\nJoan Lyn Slonczewski (born August 14, 1956)[1] is an American microbiologist at Kenyon College and a science fiction writer who explores biology and space travel. Their books have twice earned the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel: A Door into Ocean (1987) and The Highest Frontier (2011). With John W. Foster and Erik Zinser, they coauthor the textbook, Microbiology: An Evolving Science (W. W. Norton) now in its fifth edition.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nSlonczewski was born in August 14, 1956 at Hyde Park, New York and raised in Katonah, New York.[1]\n\nThey earned an A.B. in biology, magna cum laude, from Bryn Mawr College in 1977. They completed a PhD in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale University in 1982 and post-doctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania studying calcium flux in leukocyte chemotaxis. Since 1984 they have taught at Kenyon College, taking sabbatical leaves at Princeton University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Slonczewski's research focuses on the pH (environmental) stress response in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis using genetic techniques.[2]\n\nSlonczewski teaches both biology and science fiction courses. From 1996 through 2008, they have been awarded Howard Hughes Medical Institute funding for undergraduate biological sciences education, which they have used to improve science instruction and to foster summer science fellowships for minority and first-generation students.\n\nThey were the Hal Clement Science Speaker in February 2011 at the Boskone 48 convention.\n\nSlonczewski is also a member of the Quakers and Quakerism is featured in many of her novels.[3]\n\nFiction\n\n[edit]\n\nTheir 1986 Campbell Award-winning novel A Door into Ocean shows their command of genetics and ecological science, as well as their commitment to pacifism and feminism. It depicts the ecosystem of a planet covered entirely by water, inhabited by an exclusively female race of genetic engineers. Daughters of Elysium (1993), The Children Star (1998), and Brain Plague (2000) are loose sequels.[citation needed]\n\nA serialization of Slonczewski's The Children Star (1998) appeared in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, a magazine known for hard science fiction.[citation needed]\n\nBrain Plague (2000) depicts a world where intelligent microbes inhabit human brains. The microbial aliens have potential for great good as well as great evil. They evolve in the same way as pathogens such as HIV or as symbionts such as our digestive bacteria, which help keep humans healthy. Brain Plague tells of a future in which genetic engineering, combined with nanotechnology, can do everything from shaping our bodies to growing enormous buildings for us. In an interview on their writing, Slonczewski related: \"One time in class, my students were discussing my book Brain Plague. I asked the class, 'Is this book liberal or conservative?' A student said, 'It's conservative, because all the characters are married.' Another student jumped up, 'It is not conservative!' Half the book's marriages are gay â€“ with a few robots included.\"[4]\n\nThe Highest Frontier (2011) is a coming of age story about the first year in college of Jennifer Ramos Kennedy, a member of the ongoing Kennedy political dynasty. The year is 2108 and Jenny is attending Frontera College, which is located in a space habitation. The earth is being destroyed by human-made ecological catastrophes blamed on the \"ultraphytes,\" UV-photosynthetic plant-animals from outer space. Some political factions are promoting space habitats as a solution, but the spacehabs can only accommodate a tiny percentage of the human population. The political system is grid locked. The Highest Frontier addresses political, social, and environmental issues.[citation needed]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nStill Forms on Foxfield (1980) 1988 reprint ISBN 0-380-75328-6\n\nA Door into Ocean (1986) ISBN 0-87795-763-0\n\nThe Wall Around Eden (1989) ISBN 1-55710-030-6\n\nDaughter of Elysium (1993) ISBN 0-380-97222-0\n\nThe Children Star (1998) ISBN 0-312-86716-6\n\nBrain Plague (2000) ISBN 0-312-86718-2\n\nThe Highest Frontier (2011) ISBN 978-0-7653-2956-1\n\nScience publications\n\n[edit]\n\nJ.
