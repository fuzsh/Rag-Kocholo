        "text": "What happens after happily ever after?\n\nSouth Carolina author Mary Alice Monroe seemed to have wrapped up her \"Beach House\" trilogy with a bow in 2018's \"Beach House Reunion.\" But, as we discover in her latest, \"On Ocean Boulevard,\" there's more -- much more.\n\nIn our latest episode, Cara Rutledge, the central character of \"Beach House,\" has just returned to Sullivan's Island, off Charleston, S.C. Widowed from her girlhood sweetheart, she's found new love, at 55, with a man who's handsome, rich AND retired. What's more, she's become the adoptive mom of 4-year-old Hope, fulfilling a lifelong dream. (In Monroe's Lowcountry world, 55 is the new 30.)\n\nBut there are storm clouds on the horizon, and not just from the Caribbean. Her fiance, David, wants a big wedding, and planning it is driving Cara crazy. David, who was a take-charge executive, is starting to show a controlling streak. He wants Cara to take his last name, the old-fashioned way. And he wants her to give up Primrose Cottage, her mother Lovie's beloved refuge, which gave the series its name.\n\nOne night, Cara thinks she sees a vision of her mom on the beach. But it's not -- it's her 25-year-old niece, Linnea , who has a thing for '40s vintage fashions.\n\nLinnea is back from California, with her tail between her legs. She's lost her job, and she's broken up with John, the love of her life, who revealed he didn't want kids, didn't want to move back to South Carolina and wasn't really sure he wanted to go through with the whole marriage thing.\n\nShe dreads facing her dad, a male chauvinist of the I Told You So school. Aunt Cara gives her a pep talk, but more is to come.\n\nMeanwhile, Flo, Cara's beloved next-door neighbor and surrogate aunt, is beginning a rapid decline due to Alzheimer's. Something must be done, but her guardian, Emmi, seems overwhelmed. (Further complicating matters, Emmi and Cara are best friends -- and Emmi is John's mother.)\n\nAll of this will be straightened out (spoiler alert: happy ending), but to do so will take a 372-page novel, with Monroe's semi-patented mix of social comedy, family drama and romance.\n\nMonroe has a strong environmental consciousness, and once again coastal issues form a strong backdrop. While Cara works in sea-turtle conservation programs through the South Carolina Aquarium, Linnea joins in the local turtle watch and spots the first loggerhead turtle nesting of the season -- in late April! (Thanks to climate change, they're coming earlier and earlier.)\n\nAlong with sea turtle lore, however, Monroe mixes in highly detailed descriptions of what everyone's wearing, down to the brand name, and their furniture highlights. (In another side plot, Linnea helps her mother Julia launch her dream of an interior design business.)\n\n\"On Ocean Boulevard\" can be read as a stand-alone, but Monroe clearly hopes to draw readers of her earlier books. The new novel features cameo appearances by characters from her \"Lowcountry Summer\" series, including Marietta \"Mamaw\" Muir and her granddaughters Carson and Harper.\n\nFans of sea turtles, surfing, the South Carolina coast and beach reads in general should be pleased.\n\nBen Steelman can be reached at 910-616-1788 or peacebsteelman@gmail.com.\n\n’ON OCEAN BOULEVARD“"
