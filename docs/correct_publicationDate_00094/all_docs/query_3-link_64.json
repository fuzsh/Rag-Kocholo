If the descriptions look a little dry it’s because they’re mainly complied of research and not personal opinion as I’ve only read a couple books from only a portion on this list! If you want to help out send me a concise description including – characters names , backdrop , plots , and tone.\n\nADDIE MILLS\n\nA non numbered nostalgic series based on the antics of Addie Mills a feisty small town girl in the 40’s who usually does battle with her father , a stubborn widower. The books were spun into very popular TV specials of the 70’s starring Jason Robards and Mildred Natwik. The most known is the House without a Christmas Tree in which Addie sets up a campaign of sly maneuvers in order to get her father to change his stance on Christmas Trees. He’s against them. In the following books – Addie develops a crush on a handsome school teacher, and has to deal with her father dating the woman who runs the beauty salon. She’s aided by an equally spunky grandmother and a loyal, longsuffering best friend. The writing is slightly dry and dated but the characters help move the stories along. Not bad.\n\nRock, Gail 1-4\n\nLawlor, Laurie 5-6\n\nKnopf 1-4\n\nWhitman 5-6\n\n1. The House Without a Christmas Tree – 1974\n\n2. The Thanksgiving Treasure – 1974\n\n3.

High tech super-spies, mad bombers, a singing robot named Twerpy and a villian named Black Glove – it’s got a little sumptin’ for everyone – adventure, intrigue, laughs.

There’s Aldo and Anastasia Krupnik and Al and Trig , and Ramona. The only thing separating them is preference to the characters. Humorous, lightweight stories revolving around the title character who goes to a posh Manhattan school (the kind that yes, has cliques – The Peaches and the Turnips – naturally the Peaches are the popular ones) – other than the usual tricks between classmates one of the more unusual plots involves Alice deciding a boa constrictor would make a nice pet.\n\nAdams, Laurie and Allison Coudert\n\nHoughton 1\n\nBantam (PB) 2-5\n\n1.

Alice Whipple Shapes Up – 1990\n\nALFRED HITCHCOCK AND THE THREE INVESTIGATORS\n\nLong running series, that may have had the master of mysteries himself dictating some of the plots. Whether he did or not, the series bares a resemblance to other mystery-solving-kids of the era stories (think Hardy boys or more to the point Scooby-doo because despite how supernatural the clues seemed – everything came to a logical solution.) Unfortunately due to the investigators – Jupiter , Pete and Bob’s ages around fourteen they were limited by what they could accomplish with bicycles. But in 1989 a new series redubbed Crime Busters was released and did fairly well. The character’s age was bumped up to 17 years old and now that they could drive the action was well paced. However legal issues arose and the series was ultimately squished.\n\nRobert Arthur – 1-\n\n1. The Secret of Terror Castle – 1964\n\n2. The Mystery of the Stuttering Parrot -1964\n\n3.

Some of the plots include – entering a haunted house design competition , a dog washing fund raising event , a visit from an old friend stirring up jealousy , and an attempt to become models in a kid’s catalog. Having read one of the stories I was startled to find that they were wordy and well written given the age group – I was expecting something as flimsy as Babysitter’s Little Sister – however it’s a strange series sort of displaced from it’s ideal decade considering this was put out when horror pbs were still going strong – and it’s cover art harkens more to the 80’s than mid-90’s. Interesting curio.\n\nSusan Meyers\n\nTroll\n\n1. Amy’s Haunted House – 1995\n\n2. Beautiful Brittany – 1995\n\n3. Brittany’s New Friend – 1995\n\n4. Cricket goes to the Dogs – 1995\n\n5. Cricket’s Pet Project – 1995\n\n6. Hello Jenny – 1995\n\n7. Meg and the Secret Scrapbook – 1995\n\nAMY AND LAURA\n\nIntentionally dated stories – circa 40’s Brooklyn gives the reader a heartwarming look at a pair of sisters who are emotional and physical opposites during a time of financial struggle – while Laura is the heavyset oldest , a quiet bookworm , Amy is the flighty younger sister who struggles with her school work and longs to join a group of popular girls despite their given prejudices. More meaty topics and well rounded characters than most series giving the books a realistic rather than hallow outcome.\n\nSachs, Marilyn\n\nDoubleday – reissued\n\n1. Amy Moves In – 1964\n\n2. Laura’s Luck – 1965\n\n3. Amy and Laura – 1966\n\nANASTASIA KRUPNIK\n\nQuirky humorous stories revolving around the analytical and often self absorbed title character Anastasia Krupnik who starts off in New York , only to move to her dismay to the boring suburbs – the books follow her growth age 10 to 14 I think , with a new added sibling in later books. Can’t remember these books but I do know their charm lay not in their plots ( the action in some could be considered skimpy ) but in the character herself.\n\nLowry, Lois\n\nHoughton\n\n1.

Anastasia Has the Answers – 1985\n\n7. Anastasia and Her Chosen Career – 1986\n\n8. Anastasia at This Address – 1991\n\nANDIE (ANDREA) BARKER\n\nLooks to be a humorous trio – Janice Harrell wrote them, one of the repeat authors for First Love From Silhouette ( 10 books! ) and if she brought her usual flare they should be a fun, lightweight read. Andie in Andie and the boys is a teenager who loves her stepbrother P.J. and his two best buddies but their constant protection is scaring off prospective boyfriends! The other two books follow in the path of laughs and romance as Andie must scramble to explain things when a boyfriend sends her parents a Christmas card signed – Your-future-son-in-law and friends seem to be pushing her and a best bud into making their friendship a romance.\n\nHarrell, Janice\n\nPocket (PB)\n\n1. Andie and the Boys – 1990\n\n2. Dooley Mackenzie Is Totally Weird – 1991\n\n3. Brace Yourself, P.J. – 1991\n\nANGEL\n\nThis series is based on worrywart character Angel O’Leary who starts out as a ten year old left to pick up the slack taking care of her little brother Rags when the incompetent babysitter can’t seem to keep him out of trouble. The rest of the series includes a kindly new stepfather who is from Greece , and starts out as a major embarrassment to Angel because of his job ( a t.v. clown ) but she eventually warms up and grows to love this new addition to her family. There is even a trip to his homeland which has Angel attempting tolerance for her summer upheaval before sixth grade and worse the culture shock of having to face a fish dinner when the poor fish still has his head attached. Funny , fast paced and heartwarming.\n\nDelton, Judy\n\nHoughton\n\n1. Back Yard Angel 1983 2. Angel in Charge 1985\n\n3. Angel’s Mother’s Boyfriend 1986\n\n4. Angel’s Mother’s Wedding 1987\n\n5. Angel’s Mother’s Baby 1989\n\nANGELA STEELE\n\nHeartwarming, fast paced series featuring one of the most accurately described heartwarming families in 80’s children’s fiction. The Steele’s features Tina who in the first story would love to fire her odd, eccentric mother – her siblings don’t help matters at times but her mother gets the brunt of her dislike, because of her embarrassing behavior – like singing Opera on the bus, going around with a missing front tooth (till she can get it fixed) and packing odd things for lunch. Her sophisticated and often bored acting best friend has the perfect mother so , Tina thinks. But things aren’t so great for her best friend, Melissa. In following adventures her sibling Angela apparently gets a bigger role – in one quite touching story – Oh Honestly, Angela she tries to find a way of getting back her beloved Elephant which was accidently donated to a needy children drive. Very well written – Nancy K Robinson is totally under rated.\n\nRobinson, Nancy K.\n\nApple (PB) 1\n\nScholastic 2-4\n\n1. Mom, You’re Fired 1983\n\n2. Oh Honestly, Angela 1985\n\n3.

Win or Lose – Sharon Dennis Wyeth – 1989\n\nANNIE K’S THEATER\n\n9 year old playwright Annie K gathers her friends to put on plays she’s written for the neighborhood – antics happen along the way to performing said plays. Never read sounds interesting – though obviously aimed at younger readers. Added note not sure if this is a recurring gimmick or merely added for one book in that a ‘script’ is included for the readers to put on their own play with tips on props or costuming ( other books often featured these so called additions – Fab five added once a recipe , Party line – party tips , Keepsake – makeup tips )\n\nWyeth, Sharon Dennis\n\nSkylark (PB) 1.

In War comes to Willy Freeman – Wilelmina ( Willy for short ) disguises herself as a boy and flees in order to find her mother who was taken by the British as a washer woman. Battling the elements and her stalking owner Willy’s quest is lightened somewhat when she makes friends with a tavern owner but at times a grueling look at history. Jump Ship features a boy who is plotting to re-steal his father’s papers from his cruel Master – Captain Ivers ( papers that could spark their freedom ) but kicks off a dangerous chain of events which could put him on a slave boat to the West Indies.\n\nCollier, James Lincoln, and Christopher Collier\n\nDelacorte\n\n1.

The Magnetic Ghost of Shadow Island\n\nASH STAFF TRILOGY\n\nCurious trio – mainly because it’s found under a heading logo ( like Wildfire or Sweet Dreams ) called Magic Quest – a series featuring fantasy books – and thereby becomes a series within a series. Six orphans live in a cave with an elderly caretaker called Rhawn while winter blows unceasingly outside due to an evil takeover by the wicked Ammar. But when Rhawn dies bequeathing the others with special gifts – and leaving eldest Mole in charge with the magical ashwood staff of title one , they set out on a quest to free their land from oppression. Features goblins , impish talking swords , and the kind of myth and magic that appeals to kids. See also Magic Quest\n\nFisher, Paul\n\nAtheneum\n\n1. Ash Staff 1979\n\n2.

The second book jumps ahead to show Vicky at the age of 14, during their family’s cross country camping trip where she is torn between a cynical exciting boy Zachary who flirts via left behind notes and reappearances at camp grounds and Andy a calm less exciting boy. In the third book as the Austin family settles in their New York apartment most of the focus switches to their new friend Josiah ‘Dave’ Davidson who helps blind pianist Emily Gregory. This book however delves into fantasy and science when the kids come across a genie in a junk shop who may be working for a disillusioned bishop who has a Micro Ray which could help him control a gang called the Alphabats in a plot to seize power. In A Ring of Endless Night – Vicky spends the summer with Adam who is doing experiments in dolphin communication and discovers she has a talent for telepathy. But despite this somewhat buoyant idea the books theme, implied in the title, is looking for light in the swallowing darkness as she must decide whether Zachary’s bleak outlook is true when a series of bad events threaten her happiness. Not a true series in the sense that these book are bucking formula. Worth a read!\n\nL’Engle, Madeleine\n\nVanguard 1\n\nFarrar 2-7\n\n1. Meet the Austins 1960\n\n2. The Moon by Night 1963\n\n3.

The series starts with Aviva returning home from camp to discover her parents divorcing and the following plots include her reactions to each new change as her family grows – step parents and babies appear and Aviva ages from 10 to 13.

The fact that he’s got to kept Robot’s talents a secret create all kinds of trouble as he’s often accused of delivering the smart remarks himself. Susan Saunders who also created Sleepover Friends once again taps in on her talent for humor and the accompanying drawings add to the laughs.

In fact the first book features a cameo from the great detective but mainly these stories revolve around the Baker street boys – the lads who often helped Sherlock Holmes round up evidence and who wind up stumbling into their own mysteries.

Apparently the girls, give their headmistress a hard time. All but perhaps Jenny, or maybe she does to, having got caught up in the antics of her new friends. Sounds a little like The Trouble with Angels. If anyone knows anything about this series let me know.\n\nHarriet Martyn\n\nScholastic\n\n1. Jenny and the Syndicate\n\n2.

I think because Babysitters Little sister was doing so well a flood of a pre-juvi series were coming out. Sandy Asher though is no slouch to 80’s fiction so may be better than I suspect.\n\nAsher , Sandy\n\nScholastic\n\n1. Best Friends Get Better\n\n2. Mary in the Middle\n\n3. Pat’s Promise\n\n4.

In the following books the focus is more on friendship as she is now older. A review on Amazon suggested the books had splintery plots and were episodic; saved only by the characters friendship. Plots include the usual divorce, the usual entrance of a step parent and an unwanted spoiled sibling, and attempts to try out for a TV commercial an opportunity that comes with new girl, Rainbow Rothstein.\n\nOrgel, Doris\n\nViking\n\n1.

This one is about a group of friends – starting with Chelsea who moves from Oklahoma to Michigan and runs up a phone bill calling her old friend back home. Eventually she begins making new friends and it sounds like they have the typical preteen adventures of romance, sibling rivalry, and friendship but being that this is a Christian oriented series there’s usual a moral struggle. Some found it to be to didactic but given how directionless books have gotten maybe that’s not a bad thing. Nice to see a series that features the typical preteen backdrops plus church!\n\nHilda Stahl\n\nCrosswinds\n\n1. Chelsea and the Outrageous Phone Bill – 1992\n\n2. Real Trouble for Roxie – 1992\n\n3.

Had no idea till I googled this that the series was also a TV series. I have no idea if the idea to link the books together started straight off or merged later on – but the stories take place at a haunted high school – Edgar Allen Poe High. The stories appear to merge both humor and horror and have wildly goofy covers.\n\nVarious\n\nHarpertorch\n\n1. Beware of the Shopping Mall – Betsy Haynes\n\n2.

The series did fairly well and I can’t be sure if it ended out of Quin-Harkin being finished with it or it sinking due to poor sales – the trouble is the packaging. In the circles of 80’s fiction a large type paperback, 7 X 5 inches give or take a few, was reserved for middle grade fiction, while 6 X 4 was generally reversed for teen lit high school based romances. The Boyfriend Club was published in the big paperback and I had assumed it featured girls in the seventh grade – ala The BSC however the girls are actually 14 and entering their first year at Alta Mesa High. The characters include Ginger, Roni, Karen whose Vietnamese, and Justine whose wealthy. Haven’t actually read any of these but given Janet Quin-Harkin’s talent for fun series it’s probably worth checking out!\n\nQuin-Harkin , Janet\n\nTroll\n\n1. Ginger’s First Kiss\n\n2.

The gimmick is that the girls Cici , Nancy and Jill will have an emotional upheaval to untangle (each book is a variation of their side of the event) caused by the series villainess Maggie and her cohort – can-you-believe-it – her gossipy mother!

Assisting him in the enfolding mystery is town outcast Blossom Culp who has a unique psychic ability. Later stories include Blossom’s psychic talents causing her to travel through time even ending up on the sinking Titanic. Odd route for Peck – but sounds interesting.

This offering was perhaps too 80’s to survive. Though it had it’s angle right – late teens, and a good location – camp it was gone in four books and copies are hard to find. However it ends with a book that ties up the series – which is more than bigger series have offered their readers. Cute note the camp is called Kissamee and is located in the green Vermont mountains. Annie is the head character in the first book and trying not to fall for a fellow counselor (she’s got boyfriend-back-home syndrome.) Lisa attempts to be more outgoing in a be-yourself plot, and a color war divides the camp while the last book features a girl determined to win a best junior counselor award. Interesting.\n\nDiane Ames\n\nHarper Collins\n\n1. Summer Fling\n\n2. The Buddy System\n\n3. Campfire Secrets\n\n4. Never Say Goodbye\n\nCAMP HAUNTED HILLS\n\nAs usual Bruce Coville is mixing up genres with a deft hand – creating a weird, wild world in which monsters, sci fi, paranormal and adventure all have their place. Camp Haunted Hills is a summer Camp that’s as spooky as it sounds – why wouldn’t it – the camp director is a horror movie director (think Vincent Price?) who loves trying out his special effects on unsuspecting campers. but if that sounds too tame – where’s the monsters ? Where’s the sci-fi – well in the third book – eager camper Stuart and his friends travel back in time to a world crawling with dinosaurs and by the title you can see how that one goes.\n\nBruce Coville\n\n1.

Fifteen year old Jessamyn Faith Carlisle is the narrator trying to cope with all the changes her family goes through from the death of her favorite aunt and subsequently having to take in her son, 10 yr old John Henry Squier, to finding out she is adopted with a special twist to that discovery. And later her father taken hostage in the middle east. Richly written but then you can hardly put this up against the likes of say the Treehouse Times or Sweet Valley High. It’s priorities are geared more towards reaching a goal of expressing an entire web of feelings rather than jotting down the typical – frowned in disappointment or smiled in pleasure – easy sentiment.\n\nJohnston, Norma\n\nBantam (PB)\n\n1. Carlisle’s Hope 1986\n\n2. To Jess with Love and Memories 1986\n\n3. Carlisles All 1986\n\nInteresting well written series about a amateur sleuth Carly Martin who, with her best friend Sandy an Asian boy solves stumbled upon mysteries – the first one of which I read Carly and Co starts with Carly getting mixed up with a batch of drug pushers when Sandy’s bike get stolen. Her father being on the police force is an added aid. The books are well written but seemed more wrapped up in the characters than the mystery.\n\nCebulash, Mel\n\nFawcett (PB)\n\n1.

It features an eight year old girl the Caroline of the title who has two sisters that share in typical easygoing adventures like – our babysitter feeds us liver and doesn’t understand us. Very short reads with drawn pictures. But the sort of fast-reads Troll put out so if you’re a fan of the publisher ( i.e. well I like Apple paperbacks , or Point fiction ) you already know what you’re getting.\n\nBradford, Jan\n\nTroll (PB)\n\n1.

For a while this trio lives in a drainpipe in Times Square – until Chester, longing for the outdoors, moves to a meadow. And the surrounding plots of following stories involves their adventures swapping locations. Totally charming! – my favorite has always been Tucker’s Countryside which has our city slickers – Tucker and Harry visiting their friend Chester in his meadow home, a stump – but’s it’s not strictly a vacation as they’ve been summoned to help them stop bulldozers from turning their haven into a set of condos. The stories are lively, hilarious and feature absolutely brilliant drawings by the sublime Garth Williams. Timeless classics.\n\nGeorge Selden\n\nDell\n\n1. The Cricket in Times Square – 1960\n\n2.

This seems to be an extension of it – I think. I haven’t read any of these books but from what I gather most of the stories revolve around or feature Casey Valentine, a lively fifth grader. Eclectic, fast paced and lightweight the stories offer humorous plots – a boy whose been built up as a star baseball player, makes a cast on his arm to avoid the discovery ( he’s an awful player ), to a boy and girl entrepreneurs who decide to sell worms to ice fisherman and that’s not even the weirdest element of that tale – which features a lookalike.\n\nGiff, Patricia Reilly\n\nDelacorte\n\n1.

But that’s not always the case. Some typical plots involve her trying to scout out her English pen pal in London – when she arrives to visit her and discovers her missing, to – helping out a movie star who’s being threatened by rigged accidents on the set of the horror movie he’s shooting.\n\nAustin, Jennifer\n\nGrosset\n\n1.

The characters are somewhat familiar – Cassiopeia ‘Cassie’ Perkins is a laid back, easy going young girl (14 yrs old by the time of Star Light, Star Bright) who has a typically 80’s fractured family. Her mother has remarried – giving her an older stepbrother Nick, and a new little sister – half sister, Steffie. Her younger brother 11 yr old Max is a genius who is even ahead of her in Astronaut high, in Canova Cove, Florida. The stories feature her adjustment to her new family along with plots revolving around her and her best friend Andrea, and her boyfriend Chip. There are some topical subjects that were going on at the time – Like Cassie befriends a boy with AIDS. She’s also Christian so unlike a lot of series out there, God and faith are actually mentioned and discussed though not quite as seamlessly as Hilda Stahl.

Unsure if she solves this unusual character trait but in another book she goes the route of Peyton Place and Mom You’re Fired in which the story she has written has some familiar characters which her classmates recognize as themselves which results in the usual backlash.\n\nHolmes, Barbara Ware\n\nHarper\n\n1.

The protagonists were occasionally on the older side, and facing decisions that required more thought than picking between Mr. Popularity vs the boy next door although the plots were still familiar. Keeping with the new 90’s tone authors offered up dicey (for a romance) topical topics, and embraced ethnicity.

But fortunately for the good of all plots – a ship never reaches it’s intended destination and this like many before (Swiss Family Robinson, heck even Lost in Space) crashes. The six survivors – one of them a crazed ex MP, must face the hostile terrain of the new planet Klydor and it’s strange monstrous inhabitants, but in order to survive , the teens must band together.

Stuck in the Middle\n\nDAGMAR SCHULTZ\n\nOdd sounding series in which the usual character of a preteen girl amidst the backdrop school dealing with the typical issues of romance and jealousy is slanted with witchcraft and fantasy. I’m unsure if Dagmar is a preteen witch or merely comes into contact with warlocks, guardian angels and other supernatural elements or if these conditions are meant to spark humor or mild horror.\n\nHall, Lynn\n\nScribner\n\n1.

Never read but want to – I always love a camp themed book.\n\nTolles, Martha\n\nDutton 1\n\nLodestar 2\n\nScholastic (PB) 3\n\n1. Who’s Reading Darci’s Diary? – 1984\n\n2.

But that’s pretty much typical as other plots include lots of body possessions or threats of possession mainly from nefarious ancient types. Other horror elements include demons, warlocks, Ouija boards, and curses. But on the flip side of all this demonic activity the books do tend to show that occultism only leads to trouble as they usually need a priest to bail them out.\n\nVarious authors Bantam (PB)\n\nThematic: Occult with romance subplots\n\n1.

Don’t know much about this one. But Cooper is considered one of the best English fantasy novelist and this her creme de le creme.\n\nCooper, Susan\n\nHarcourt, 1\n\nAtheneum, 2-5\n\n1.

I read Desdemona 12 going on Desperate, a good read, relaxed and whimsical. And because I couldn’t list the story elements without them sounding like a lot of others – it’s the fact that the wise-crack tone of our main character makes them more extraordinary than they actully are – a phenomenon Anastasia manages. Though one incident stands out – when Dez accidently washes her hair with varathane.\n\nKeller, Beverly\n\nLothrop\n\n1. No Beasts! No Children! – 1983\n\n2.

A Nancy Drew for the early 80’s. Donna Rockford is a no-nonsense but friendly junior in college who stumbles into mysteries that she solves aided at times by Detective Garcia – a redheaded Puerto Rican, and Abbey her feisty little sister who is still in high school. Sometimes the mysteries are transparently easy to solve others fair a bit better. Worth a look.\n\nWoolfolk, Dorothy\n\nScholastic (PB)\n\n1. Mother, Where Are You? 1977\n\n2.

Never read any – but the exotic backdrops of Las Vegas, UN week in New York, Nisei week in California have certainly perked my interest into seeking one out to sample. The plots seem the usual trappings for this genre – kidnappings, murder, sinister figures and conspiracies – could be either great or mundane.\n\nBethancourt, T. Ernesto\n\nHoliday\n\n1.

While Sandi loves to sing and read and belongs to G.L.O.W. ( great lovers of woodlands – a kind of girl guide club), Randi is into the sporty stuff. All characters appear to have daffy names – there’s female bully Bobby Joy Boikin, and a boy nicknamed Wormy, even a lookalike cousin named Mandy (who becomes the triple in Triple Trouble.) And though the duo have a penchant for drawing mishaps think that their little brother Teddy has earned his nickname Trouble more so than they have theirs – Double Trouble. There’s often a switcharoo that goes awry and a lesson learned – but never preachy. Breezy books great for a young reader.\n\nMichael J Pellowski\n\nWillowisp / Treetop\n\n1. Double Trouble\n\n2.

This series features the ongoing adventures of Dracula – but as predator or prey I’m unsure of. The stories themselves seem simply written.\n\nRobert Lory\n\nPinnacle\n\n1. Dracula Returns\n\n2.

Challenge to Dracula\n\nDRAGONTALES\n\nA choose-your-own-adventure series for fantasy lovers that attempted to accommodate readers of each sex. Alternating heroes and heroines – heroes are given the even numbers, heroines the odd – the flaw was perhaps in assuming what girl fantasy readers want. Intrusive romances often spoil the action but there is some interest to be found for the many Tolkienesque touches. Talk of elves, orcs, princes, princesses, creatures, castles, crystal caves, charms, kingdoms, will interest reads who love a fairy tale touch. All in all worth a look. If only to compare it to Choose your own adventure.\n\nVilott, Rhondi\n\nSignet (PB)\n\nInteractive\n\n1. Sword Daughter’s Quest – 1984\n\n2. Runesword! – 1984\n\n3.

Lewis’s Narnia books, this quartet follows the adventures of Ged, a dragonlord (wizard) who is sent at a young age to an island to learn the true way of magic – which is to use it as sparingly as possible. Sorry for the sparse description – haven’t read any of these but The Tombs of Atuan has caught my eye – taking places in a dark underground Labyrinth so I’ll be seeking that one out. Looks interesting and though probably noted as a forerunner for Harry Potter – also looks as though it takes magic on a more serious and less theatrical level.\n\nLe Guin,\n\nUrsula Parnassus 1\n\nAtheneum 2-4\n\n1.

The main character is Leroy ‘Encyclopedia’ Brown who demonstrates how he got his nickname (for having a vast supply of knowledge) by usually solving said mystery. Occasionally however a feisty girl named Sally solved them. The books bare their sixties stamp featuring such Little Lulu-esque touches as there is a gang named the Tigers complete with a clubhouse run by a bully named Bugsy. The great gimmick of these mysteries is that the reader is asked to figure out for themselves the solution to the story – which can be checked to see if they guessed right by turning to a solutions section at the back. Great series to challenge anyone that says they don’t like reading!\n\nSobol, Donald J\n\nThomas Nelson , Scholastic , Bantam\n\n1. Encyclopedia Brown, Boy Detective – 1963\n\n2.
