        "text": "The film trilogy is not based on any of the novels in particular, but will rather borrow elements from throughout the long-running series - and there is a lot of source material to draw from, with over 100 books dating back to 1989. (Learn more about the Fear Street book changes made for the movies.)\n\nThankfully the release schedule of the books wasn't quite as revolutionary as the films - so scroll down to see our guide on how to read the Fear Street novel series.\n\nFear Street books: Release order\n\nUnlike the film trilogy that begins with Part 1: 1994 and rewinds all the way back to 1666 for the final instalment, the Fear Street novels are mostly self-contained one-offs with no strict chronological order.\n\nMore like this\n\nThe only books that require reading a prior novel are a few sequels - namely Wrong Number 2, The Stepsister 2 and Best Friend 2 - which are easily identified as follow-ups by the titles, and conveniently have the same name as their predecessor.\n\nRead more: Watch the first five minutes of Netflix's Fear Street horror trilogy\n\nYou could therefore read the books in almost any order you like in theory, but for those looking for an order then release date is the closest we have to an intended sequence.\n\nFear Street first frightened a generation of teen book readers in 1989, with the original series running for eight years until 1997.
