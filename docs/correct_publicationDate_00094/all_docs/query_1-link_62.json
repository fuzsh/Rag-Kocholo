Post holocaust tale set on a ruined Earth where aliens have preserved a few towns and cites by means of force fields. \"In tiny Gwynwood, Pennsylvania, the people go on with their lives, practicing a pacifist, ecologically sound lifestyle heavily influenced by the Quaker faith. But one young woman isn't satisfied with things as they are, and vows to discover the aliens' secrets. One of Slonczewski's purposes here, as in A DOOR INTO OCEAN, is to suggest practical alternatives to violence. Her novel can be seen as a welcome rejoinder to the current glut of military SF novels.\" - Michael M. Levy. The author's third SF book. Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-1048. Sargent, British and American Utopian Literature, 1986-2009. A fine copy in fine dust jacket. (#157645).\n\nPrice: $25.00"
