        "text": "Refreshing pacifism vs tired noble savage trope\n\nThis book maintains an interesting tension between a new take on war and colonialism that shows how radical pacifism can wear down even the most militaristic society, and yet another noble savage and mystical magical moon women trope-fest in which the life-sciences gifted race of women manage to enlighten just a few individuals raised under a male regime of power. The story raises so many questions about the larger galactic society outside the double planets of the main characters. I would read more in this universe or by this author.\n\nComplex World-building Sci-Fi\n\nThis was a very interesting book, reminding me of some of Sherri Tepper's works. This book outlines a conflict between a patriarchal military culture and a water world populated by women whose technology is biologically based. The book moves slowly, but as I kept listening I was drawn into the story of how these two cultures interact.\n\nOverly shared hyper-hydration\n\nJoan Slonczewski's A Door into Ocean is a tale of an ocean planet, Shora, populated by women who become the focus of an invasion effort by an authoritarian multi-planetary empire. The native population of Shora possesses an advanced civilization whose technology is exclusively biological. They are also pacifist in nature and exhibit an egalitarian political structure. The invasion force is quite stereotypical and becomes stymied by their inability to subjugate the natives.\n\nWhile the basic plot is quite traditional: a native population overcoming a more powerful outside entity that is intent on total subjugation by peaceful means, the underlying premise falls short on several accounts. Shora is a total water world which means the human female population must have migrated to that world at some point in the distant past implying they have a history, but this never seems to manifest in terms of their understanding of their opponents. In addition, they have conveniently managed to adapt biological mechanisms for every form of advanced technology: insects are use as digital storage devices; fish become long distance communication; and plants supply all medical needs including vines that conduct microsurgery. At the same time, they are dedicated to living in harmony with all the rest of the life on Shora up to the point of tolerating species that kill them to maintain balance. On the other hand, they are constantly introducing genetically engineered lifeforms into the environment without any negative consequence; they are perfect in that their technology never has a downside. Also, they have managed to also learn about quantum mechanics without even having a grasp of the periodic table. Their world is reminiscent of the Flintstones with water replacing rocks. Probably, the most frustrating aspect of the story is that the all the major players on both sides seem totally incapable of even the barest understanding of what the other side is thinking. Lastly, the overuse of \"sharing\" which is the term for any interaction between two people becomes annoying.\n\nThe narration is adequate, although character distinction is minimal and pacing drags a bit.\n\nA compelling story well-told\n\nThis is a book that, in my opinion, does not show its age. It could have been published last week,\n\nTwo inhabited moons with very different cultures are part of a larger galactic empire, and increasing contact with the empire is causing its own strains. The more industrialized, military-inclined culture of Valendon wants to exploit the resources of Shora, a world virtually without land.\n\nThe Shorans have different ideas.\n\nThe are peaceful, cooperative, and communal. They are also all female. The reasons for this and its significance become clear as the story progresses, and it's the source of much of the conflict in the story.\n\nShora isn't the simplistic paradise it may appear on the surface. The Shorans, who call themselves Sharers, are doing a lot more than is visible at a casual glance, and two gender-determined cultures are anything but. The storyline of the young man, Sinel, rejects the whole idea that the traits the Sharers value might be gender-determined rather than cultural.\n\nThis isn't a fast-paced action story. It's thoughtful, deliberate, and fascinating. with characters who are interesting, complex, and unfolded with skill. The world-building is indirect yet convincing.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nI bought this audiobook.\n\nI felt like I was in Shora\n\nWhat did you love best about A Door into Ocean?\n\nThe vivid writing brought me right through\n\nWhat about Rosalyn Landor’s performance did you like?\n\nThe narrator did an amazing job conveying the peaceful feeling of Shora and the peaceful beliefs of the sharers.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI gave the story 4 out of 5 stars only because there was all this build up to a climax that was not very climactic.\n\nMy top 3 books of all time\n\nI can't say enough good about this book. It's basically a feminist Dune. The performance is much in the older audio book style: slow and not super pronounced, but the reader does change voices for each character.\n\nIf you don't like feminism, don't bother obviously. It's tiring to read reviews complaining that this is a feminist book for having an all female society, when 99% of scifi is about male characters and worlds, dominated by men... this is a book by and for women, and for men intelligent enough to care about what that kind of speculation means to women of our world.\n\naudio reread\n\nI read this story about the time it came out and I love the author's other books. The world building is exceptional. I enjoy the preferonance although the male voices were to my ears a little off putting at times but this was minor and didn't take from the story."
