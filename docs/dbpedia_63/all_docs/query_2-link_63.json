        "text": "Virtual Classes\n\nDuring the virus, I have naturally shifted most of my education programs to online experiences. This is frustrating and rewarding. The new virtual experiences are certainly stretching out my geographical reach. I am certainly excited by our new Virtual Classes Program.\n\nMy 2021 Workshop Schedule continues to evolve to accommodate the virus precautions and very limited ability to gather indoors.\n\nSome plans are now being made on the assumption that the vaccine is ever more available and will then become a prerequisite for the class.\n\nI remain committed to offering great courses whether in person or virtually. See what a great experience students have had on my Workshops by exploring Workshop Testimonials.\n\nThe itch to be on the road got scratched a little with a few days down in Middle California South around Pismo Beach with my good friend photographer Ed Stone. The Oceano Dunes, Nipomo and the Big Sur Coast were all of interest, and all led us down some interesting paths.\n\nAfter picking up Ed near Monterey, we naturally took Highway One south through Big Sur rather than the inland Highway 101. The Big Sur coast is always full of complex views of land and sea. Our drive had some fog and cloud cover, sometimes obscuring what we could see, but bathing us in beautifully soft light.\n\nAt the south end of the Big Sur coast near Hearst Castle, we stumbled onto a very improbable small herd of Zebras. Naturally, we inquired via the net, and found they are descendants of Hearst’s Zoo, a few present of the remaining 126 animals. It was a very curious sight.\n\nThe Migrant Mother photograph of Florence Owens Thompson by Dorothea Lange from Nipomo, CA has been important to me for a very long time. It seemed important to know where it was made and acknowledge its importance. The photograph was made as part of Dorothea’s work for the US Government Farm Security Ademintration (FSA) with many other photographers, among them Walker Evans, Marion Post Walcott, and Russell Lee.\n\nMy first recollection of encountering this now 85 year old photograph was as a student in Jr. College as I was just exploring photography. This single image from Nipomo California opened up my mind to the power a photograph could contain, and in a completely different way than the landscape photography I was growing to love by Adams and Weston. I ordered a 16x20 print from the Library of Congress in 1978, which I have now used as a source to scan and restore the photograph to a pristine state and make some nice large prints.\n\nIt was a good adventure last week, roaming Nipomo, imagining the hard times Florence had experienced, and naturally, wanting to know more.\n\nThere seemed to be no local acknowledgement of this historic photograph, it’s influence, or where it was made. In that absence, we found it particularly strange to discover a Dorothea Lange school, far from the site we had come to believe the photograph was made, and Lange’s name now associated with a sports team, the Bobcats.\n\nIn doing research for the possible location where the photograph was made, we came across an old newspaper interview with Cal State University Professor Paul Lester. The article described Dr. Lester’s research searching for the site. While heading for Nipomo, I sent off an email to him via my iPhone while we started searching.\n\nFrom the information in the article, we found what seemed the likely site, which a reply from Dr. Lester confirmed in an email the next day. The location seemed accurate and we proceeded to go back to the site and photograph, both on the ground and from my drone.\n\nPaul Lester was good enough to allow me to post the intro to his chapter on Photography from his book on Visual Communication to my website for your enjoyment.\n\nAnyone wishing to have a print of the Migrant Mother photograph can download a high res file from the Library of Congress or order my restored version from me.\n\nLOC Image Page for information and file download.\n\nIf you would like one of my prints:\n\n8x10, 11x14 and 16x20 inch prints on Luster paper: $50, $75 & $100 respectively.\n\nThe trip also gave me a chance to see my old friend Brian Lawler, early digital printing/prepress adopter, professor of Graphic Arts at Cal Poly. We shared some old stories, told some new ones, and created a new bond between Brian and my friend Ed Stone who worked in the printing industry for 30 years. We always say Ed was a “stripper” which gets a wide variety of reactions.\n\nAmong his many projects Brian described to us was digitizing old 10 inch Circuit Camera Panoramic negatives and the giant outdoor murals prints of them he recently made. The story enlarged to those old negatives being made from a local mountain top, later de-capped to make fill for 1938 Highway 101 construction. To re-photograph the scenes, Brian had to calculate the former camera viewpoint from the now gone mountain top which he simulated with a rented scissors lift raised to 60 feet on the now-flattened mountain. It was a great story. The adventures of my fellow photographers and friends have always been a blast and lets me see the world through their eyes.\n\nI love to wander and discover.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to photographic education, there is one student scholarship spot in many of our classes. Please pass the word along.\n\nFor discounted time studying with Steve, keep in mind our Mentoring Program.\n\nWith all of our busy schedules and limited budgets, destination workshops or classes become a challenge, but many of you still have questions you need answered, or feedback on some new work. We want to remind you of our Virtual Online Consulting Program. This service allows all of you out there around the globe to consult online live with Steve on technical, aesthetic and workflow issues using Skype and your webcam.\n\nOur Essays and Tutorials from the past couple of years can now be found on our Newsletter Archive and some on my neglected Blog.\n\nWe hope you can come by the gallery after the virus and see the original prints in the new Life Form Gallery and its new Life Form Portfolio, the Exquisite Earth exhibition with its accompanying very special Exquisite Earth Portfolio 1. We invite you to join us on a workshop, rent lab space, or just say hello and let us know what you are up to photographically and what you might like to see us offer. We value your input.\n\nWorkshop Testimonials"
