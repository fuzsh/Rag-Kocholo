        "text": "Through its awards program, the Biophysical Society honors its members and recognizes excellence in biophysics. The Society offers awards in sixteen different categories.\n\nThe deadline for the 2025 award cycle has passed. Submission Deadline is May 1, 2024 11:59 PM USA Eastern.\n\nNominations for the awards are solicited and evaluated by the Biophysical Society Awards Committee. Society members are encouraged to nominate candidates by submitting a nomination application through the online nomination site. Please note that the nomination information will not be saved until you have clicked the submit button. You are encouraged to have all required materials ready when starting the online nomination process.\n\nThe Society Awards now accept self-nominations. The Fellows distinction and the Outstanding Doctoral Research in Biophysics Award, however, are not eligible for self-nomination. Nominees may be affiliated with non-academic institutions, however, please note that Society membership is a requirement for the nominator, nominee, and author of one of the two letters of support. Awards Committee members and Council members are not eligible for Society Awards during their term. For specific information and eligibility requirements, click on the individual award categories.\n\nAll nominees and award recipients will be guided by both the BPS Ethics Guidelines and the Awards and Fellows Revocation Policy.\n\nFor a helpful guide on how to craft an effective nomination letter, check out this blog post from the Committee for Professional Opportunities for Women (CPOW)."
