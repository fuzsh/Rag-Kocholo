Whiston said about this year’s list. “I’m continuously impressed by the ever-increasing strength and popularity of the Library of Michigan’s Michigan Notable Book list. The abundance of quality writing generates more interest every year among bookstores, writers, libraries, and readers from all walks of life.”\n\nEach year, the Michigan Notable Book (MNB) list features 20 books, published during the previous calendar year, which are about, or set in, Michigan or the Great Lakes region, or written by a Michigan author. Selections include a variety of genres, both fiction and nonfiction, that appeal to many audiences and explore topics and issues close to the hearts of Michigan residents. The 2018 list includes titles exploring: baking, brewing, history, design, architecture, crime, medicine and, as always, the Great Lakes and baseball.\n\nMNB is a statewide program that began as part of the 1991 Michigan Week celebration, designed to pay tribute and draw attention to the many people, places and things that make Michigan life unique and vibrant.\n\n“The MNB selections clearly demonstrate the rich subject matter Michigan offers to writers,” said State Librarian Randy Riley. “Everyone will find something of interest that speaks to their lives or experiences in our great state.”\n\nThis year’s MNB selection committee includes representatives from the Library of Michigan; the Library of Michigan Foundation; Muskegon Area District Library; Herrick District Library of Holland; Cooley Law School; Lansing City Pulse newspaper; Michigan’s State Historic Preservation Office; Wayne State University; Michigan Department of Education; Michigan Center for the Book; Michigan Humanities Council; and Schuler Books & Music.\n\n2018 Michigan Notable Books\n\nArthur Vandenberg: The Man in the Middle of the American Century by Hendrik Meijer, University of Chicago Press Books\n\nArthur H.

Law enforcement was overwhelmed, and it wasn’t until battle-tested federal troops arrived that the city returned to some semblance of normalcy. Detroit 1967 starts at the beginning with colonial slavery along the Detroit River and culminates with an examination of the state of race relations today and suggestions for the future.\n\nThe Goat Fish and the Lover’s Knot, by Jack Driscoll, Wayne State University Press\n\nThe Goat Fish and the Lover’s Knot is comprised of 10 stories, mostly set in Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula, a landscape as gorgeous as it is severe. If at times the situations in these stories appear hopeless, the characters nonetheless, and even against seemingly impossible odds, dare to hope. These fictional individuals are so compassionately rendered that they can hardly help but be, in the hands of this writer, not only redeemed but made universal. Lovers of contemporary storytelling will revel in Driscoll’s skill and insight on display in this unique collection.\n\nGrown-up Anger: The Connected Mysteries of Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, and the Calumet Massacre of 1913, by Daniel Wolff, HarperCollins Publishers\n\nGrown-up Anger is a dual biography of Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, that is also a murder mystery and a history of labor relations, socialism, business and greed in 20th Century America.
