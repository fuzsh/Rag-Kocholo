        "text": "Jimmy On Dickey Betts\n\nLosing a lifelong friend and former bandmate like Dickey weighs heavy on my heart. Dickey’s presence always loomed large, full of undeniable and confident talent that birthed some of the best songs ever written from his compact and mighty being. I’ll never forget the first time I heard Dickey play live when my band opened for the Allmans. His melodic “yin” to Duane’s soaring slide “yang” was THE perfect combination. When they played “In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,” I remember everyone in the crowd being mesmerized by that beautiful and haunting melody. I feel so fortunate to have played with Dickey (along with Chuck Leavell and Butch Trucks) in our early 80’s group B.H.L.T. and I have so many cherished memories of shows like the one at the Bottom Line in NYC and the live recording we did at the Coffee Pot in Roanoke. More recently, I had the privilege of seeing Dickey on his recent birthday when the Allman Betts Family Revival tour passed through Sarasota. We laughed and took pictures and reminisced about the good times we shared through the years. Those memories will continue to fill me with gratitude for the time we spent together, for our shared history on and off the stage. His absence leaves a massive void and a time for grieving, but we can all be comforted by the thought that his musical legacy will live on forever through all the lives that he touched throughout the world, through his beautiful family, and through the musicians like me who continue to carry the torch. Rest easy, brother Dickey. - JH\n\nThe Allman Betts Family Revival Tour for 2023 Was A Success!\n\nDevon Allman: “What started as a party seven years ago to mourn the loss of my father and celebrate his life and music has become something way more than we ever could’ve imagined… It takes a village and we feel really blessed that this one is ours. If you joined us for this tour, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving us your energy and support and helping to celebrate this timeless music catalog… It’s truly an honor to play this music for you.”\n\nJeff Beck 1944 - 2023\n\n“I’ve been in a haze since I got the news. I’ve tried to sit down and write but the words have escaped me. Here’s what came out tonight. JB, thank you for 50 years of friendship and musical collaboration, including countless magical nights around the world when I felt like I was flying as I sang my heart out onstage next to you and you played your guitar with such passion and soul that it sounded like angels singing. We joked about farting preachers, emulated bird calls, and discussed the merits of Popeye the Sailor man, vintage Ford hotrods and obscure gospel tunes. We indulged in an after-show Prosecco or two and boy did we laugh, a lot! I look forward to singing our favorite songs to the heavens in hopes that I can channel some of your magic and touch the people around me, all the while hoping you can hear us, too. Rest easy my musical inspiration and treasured friend. Love, Jimmy Boy”Photo by Drew Stawin Photography"
