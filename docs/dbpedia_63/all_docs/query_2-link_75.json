        "text": "Abstract\n\nPrevious research has shown a correlation between spatial reasoning skills and success in many STEM subjects including computing. More recent research suggests not just a correlation but also a causation, i.e., students' achievements in computing can be improved by improving spatial reasoning skills. So far most of the literature in the education field has treated spatial skills as a single entity, e.g., authors often only measured or trained one specific skill, or did not differentiate between different skills during assessment. We investigate how students' success in introductory computer graphics is correlated to different types of spatial skills. The results of a user study with 36 participants suggest that success in introductory computer graphics is correlated to students' abilities in mental rotation and spatial visualisation but is not correlated with spatial perception skills. We also found a large variation of spatial abilities in the student cohort. We discuss possible reasons for our results and implications for teaching and learning.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nJeff Bagust, Sharon Docherty, Wayne Haynes, Richard Telford, and Brice Isableu. 2013.

ICER has reacted positively to two theories for why this relationship exists, by both Parkinson & Cutts and ...\n\nInvestigating the Relationship Between Spatial Skills and Computer Science\n\nICER '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research\n\nThe relationship between spatial skills training and computer science learning is unclear. Reported experiments provide tantalising, though not convincing, evidence that training a programming student's spatial skills may accelerate the development of ...\n\nSpatial Skills and Demographic Factors in CS1\n\nKoli Calling '21: Proceedings of the 21st Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research\n\nMotivation Prior studies have established that training spatial skills may improve outcomes in computing courses. Very few of these studies have, however, explored the impact of spatial skills training on women or examined its relationship with other ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n686 pages\n\nISBN:9781450392013\n\nDOI:10.1145/3502718\n\nGeneral Chairs:\n\nBrett A.
