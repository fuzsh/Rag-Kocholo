Lowry, an OU graduate student who was one of the first to enroll in the Early Childhood masters program. Lowry conceptualized, as part of a school project, an early childhood center on Oakland's campus. His project evolved into the creation of what is now the center's Toddler Program. The converted chicken coops once were used by Meadow Brook Theatre, which vacated them by the early 1970's. The buildings then were used for what was a preschool program for faculty and staff. Lowry and his team later started the pilot program for toddlers in the back room of the preschool. In August 2002, the center moved to the new Education and Human Services Building.\n\nMathematics and Science Center\n\nBuilt in 1997 at a cost of roughly $43 million, this academic facility holds a prominent position in the campus skyline with its eight-story tower.

Wilson, designed Meadow Brook Hall in the late 1920's after visiting many mansions in Europe for architectural ideas. The Tudor-revival-style mansion was built between 1926 and 1929 at a cost of $3.5 million and was named for the little stream that ran across the 1,500-acre estate. The 80,000-square-foot home has 100 rooms and the largest pipe organ in the state. In 1957, the Wilsons donated the estate and its grounds to found Oakland University. Public tours of Meadow Brook Hall began in 1971.\n\nOakland Center\n\nCompleted in 1959, the Oakland Center was designed to be the main student center on campus.
