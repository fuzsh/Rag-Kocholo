        "text": "I get asked all the time by brands and businesses alike of all sizes, \"What kind of content should I create?\", \"Why do I need to create content?\", and \"Posting on social media, that’s marketing right?\" I will answer all of these questions below: Let's start with the big question: Why do I need to create content? In the digital world we live in where everyone is connected more than ever, content is the gateway to getting to know a new coffee shop, a new comedian, breaking news in your city, or the new show you should binge. It’s where we get our information and identify the ideals that we believe, or reinforce the ideals we don’t believe in. Social media truly shapes social behavior. Businesses and brands can do this for their products or services. Through organic content, or Strategic Organic Content (SOC), you can shape the ideals of and mindsets of the target customer you are attempting to reach. I’ll dive deeper tomorrow. See you then 👋\n\nSo LinkedIn asked me (in those silly question thingys it does)... Can you build a brand with content? Rather than help LinkedIn ... I'll help my peeps. Simple answer.... no. Now, I've been a contrarian in the \"content marketing\" revolution for over 20 years now. I think all those \"gurus\" in that \"movement\" (if one can call it that) are just all full of crap. There is only one tried and true way to \"build a brand\" - that's through broadcast advertising combined with actually making a decent product or service and then having the apparatus to deliver it well enough at \"the moment of truth\" and post that moment... BMW, for example, is the ultimate driving machine because of billions of dollars of ads on TV and in print the past 46 years. Not because BMW wrote some blog BS nonsense on LinkedIn. I know Gary V... Mr. Hype BS NFT nonsense as of late... is all about \"content\" and the \"content\" and the this and the that... and content... Really Gary? Do you do that at Vayner? You had one decent piece of content... your Cubbies Commercial... which I'll grant for you, was absolutely spect-freaking-tackular... And guess what... it ran on TV... for AB. It wasn't a LinkedIn post... it wasn't a YouTube thing... It wasn't \"Hey guys... I'm Harry Carey... and today, we're going to talk about Baseball.\" :P BROADCAST builds brands. Mass media. And it's not about \"giving\" or \"value\" to build a brand. It's about TONNAGE. MEDIA WEIGHT. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Just pounding away... even when the creative sucks (which is more frequent than the creative being awesome.) Yes, it helps to be Weiden+Kennedy and come up with \"Just do it.\" But Addidas continues to dominate because of MEDIA WEIGHT. Yes, it helps to Benton and Bowles and come up with \"Don't Squeeze the Charmin.\" But again... billions of dollars in media weight built that brand. Brands are about quickhand... they're about becoming part of the lexicon of language... That level of \"inception\" cannot be achieved through a LinkedIn post or people dinking around on YouTube... with their \"content.\" People like to talk about Kim Kardashian as an example... about social media... Yeah right... the fact that she, her sisters, her mother, etc., were on MTV for 17 years... that didn't matter. :) TV. PRINT. TV. PRINT. TV. Print. That is how brands are built. Still to this day that's how brands are built. Not content. Content can help you to build a following in a niche. Can help you maybe find a group of people that are like \"hey - he's cool...\" That's NOT A BRAND. But that's totally ok for like 99.99999999999999999% of you. You're not Budweiser trying to sell 200 million cans of beer each week (roughly). Most of you need what Kevin Kelly described as \"a thousand true fans.\" That you can do with content. But you cannot... CAN NOT... build a brand via content. Not even Kim did... MTV... 20 years worth of it... #changemymind #marketing #advertising #branding\n\nI had a conversation with the wonderful content marketing strategist Carolyn Zick regarding social content which has stuck in my head. I had asked about posting on a cadence, and they reminded me of the importance having something to say rather than needing something to say. Obviously, this is paraphrased and from memory, they were much more eloquent, informed, and thorough (they're great!). So, as I sit here in our final week of the year, and I am reflecting on 2023, as well as years prior, I find myself appreciating the work recently done by Michael Futter to catalog our backlog of campaign data. We've very rarely made public comment about our campaigns, our performance, or our methodology. We take particular care not to shine the spotlight for our client onto ourselves. However, as more public conversation surrounds working with creators, it's important we allow our voices to be heard. That being said... 👉 We have a lifetime campaign ROI that is over four digits, while maintaining a generally accepted rate structure for creators which leaves them fairly compensated and typically eager to work with our clients again. 📈 Our campaigns perform best when we're allowed to freely target based on our proprietary system, but we work with clients to include their desired creators. ⚖ Our legal paperwork is regarded as some of the best in the industry and well positioned for the emergent industry needs of both creators and publicly traded companies. 💸 Our payment terms are situated to strike a balance between timely payment and high creator volume, while they're processed via a global payment platform to ensure financial compliance. We've been fortunate to break records, break platform systems, break analytic platforms, and continuously been provided the opportunity to help lead influencer marketing in gaming since we began in 2017. As we prepare to sign off in 2023 and head towards 2024, I can't help be excited for what we have in store, and for new faces to see why our clients enjoy referring us.\n\nContent is king, but a strategy is the crown. In the vast realm of digital marketing, content wears the crown. It's not just about churning out articles or posts; it's about crafting a strategy that supports your business goals. Identify your audience, tailor content to their needs, and choose the right channels: Know Thy Audience: Who are they? What are their preferences? A deep dive into your audience's desires and pain points is key to creating content that resonates. Tailor Content to Their Needs: Once you've identified your audience, tailor your content to meet their needs. It's not about what you want to say; it's about what they want to hear. Address their challenges, answer their questions, and provide solutions fit for them. Choose the Right Channels: Different platforms serve different purposes. Are your consumers more active on social media, or do they prefer a well-crafted email? Now, let's open the floor to your challenges in content strategy. Is it grappling with ever-changing algorithms? Navigating the intricacies of diverse audience segments? Or perhaps, measuring the impact of your content? Share your thoughts and challenges in the comments. #ContentStrategy #MarketingTips\n\nIn my Content Mktg class, I give a lecture (boldly) predicting the future of each social platform. Well…I’ve never been more bulls eye with a prediction. 🎯 I start by asking my students a simple question: \"What is the business objective of social media?\" They always start by telling me it’s about connection, linking people together, disseminating information. \"You’re wrong\", I tell them. The business goal is to generate revenue. ⬇ Revenue comes from advertisers ⬇ Advertisers need eyeballs (that’s why YOU are referred to as the product) ⬇ To get the eyeballs, you need great content. ⬇ As soon as the content stops being great, it’s over (that’s what we see happening on FB & X). Crudely speaking, social media is funded by Advertisers. Actually, that’s not crude. It’s a fact. 97% of Meta’s profit comes from ads. What advertisers need is ROI. You can’t get ROI if people that are served the ad, don’t watch the ad. So…HERE WE GO. Instagram is testing unskippable ads. I’ve been predicting this since 2021. (Yes, I feel smug). Where do I think this will go? Another bold prediction: I think we’ll be on social media less. ✍ Will you spend less time scrolling IG if you have to watch the full ad? ♻ I want to have a BIG conversation about this, please re-share! *** Follow me, Marina Cooley, for more on Content Marketing and the Future of Work.\n\n📢 Exciting news! 🎉Attention all social media managers, content creators, and digital marketers! 🌟 Are you tired of spending endless hours creating and planning content for multiple social media platforms and websites?

IF you're not going to take steps to grow your audience. See why 👇 😱 For years, companies have been pouring money into content to improve their inbound marketing and then wonder why nobody reads, watches, or listens to it. While there might be a content quality problem, more often than not there is an audience growth problem.

There is a better path to growing an audience in a reliable way that can get you off the paid media to the MQL hamster wheel. In the Audience Growth Accelerator, I'll show you how to accomplish all three. The days of sales-led growth are winding down.
