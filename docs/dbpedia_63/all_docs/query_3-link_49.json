        "text": "How do you successfully create bespoke software for your business? Partnership! You bring the deep domain knowledge of the business, the sector you work in, how your organisation functions, the challenges you face on a day to day basis, the people involved, your team culture, your ops/sales/marketing/admin/finance processes, where your bottlenecks are, where your operating expenses are high etc. And a team like Rareloop brings design and technical expertise, we know what's possible, we're used to solving complex business challenges, we've seen what has worked for others, we're an outside perspective that can approach problems from a different perspective.
