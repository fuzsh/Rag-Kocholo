        "text": "Molecular Cloning and Mutagenesis.\n\nOligonucleotide primers for cloning were designed on the basis of NM_182806.1 (Mus musculus GPR18 RefSeq accession number) and commercially synthesized (IDT, Coralville, IA). GPR18 was amplified from marathon-ready mouse brain cDNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using polymerase chain reaction and PfuUltra DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To subclone into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI), we used the following primers: forward 5′-GATCGAATT CACCATGGCC ACCCTGAGCA ATCACAACC-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and reverse 5′-GATCGATCGC GGCCGCTCAA AGCATCTCAC TGTTCATGTT GC-3′ (NotI site underlined). A fusion construct with GPR18 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was designed with the following primer set: forward 5′-GATCCAAGCT TTGACCATGG CCACCCTGAG CAATCAC-3′ (HindIII site underlined) and reverse 5′-GATCGATCCC GCGGAAGCAT CTCACTGTTC ATGTTGC-3′ (SacII site underlined), and subcloned into EGFP-N1 (Clontech). A cloning error was detected within the junction of the GPR18-EGFP construct that caused a frameshift mutation and dim expression of EGFP. QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers, forward 5′-GCAACATGAA CAGTGAGATG CTTGATATCC CGCGGGCCCG GGATCC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGATCCCGGG CCCGCGGGAT ATCAAGCATC TCACTGTTCA TGTTGC-3′ (SacII site underlined, EcoRV site italicized), were used to return the EGFP sequence in-frame and introduce an EcoRV restriction site. Hemagglutinin-tagged versions of GPR18 were produced from custom-designed vectors built on a pcDNA3.1+ backbone. GPR18 was subcloned into an N-terminal 3xHA-tagging vector with the following primers: forward 5′-GCCACCCTGA GCAATCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GATCGATCGC GGCCGCTCAA AGCATCTCAC TGTTCATGTT GC-3′ (NotI site underlined), using EcoRV and NotI restriction enzymes. A C-terminal 3xHA-tagged construct of GPR18, GPR18-3xHA, was produced by cutting and subcloning from the GPR18-EGFP construct with HindIII and EcoRV. Point mutations of GPR18 and the α2A-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis and the primers listed in . All generated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 1, A and B; Macrogen, Rockville, MD).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nPoint MutationForward Primer (5′– 3′ End)Reverse Primer (5′–3′ End)GPR18 A108NGGTGGTGTTTTACCCAAGCCTCAATCTGTGGCTTCTTGCGCAAGAAGCCACAGATTGAGGCTTGGGTAAAACACCACCGPR18 N40AGGGCTGTTTGTTGCTGTCACTGCGTTGTGGGCCCACAACGCAGTGACAGCAACAAACAGCCCGPR18 D118AGCTTTCATTAGTGCTGCCAGATACATGGCCATCGCGATGGCCATGTATCTGGCAGCACTAATGAAAGCGPR18 D118TGCTTTCATTAGTGCTACCAGATACATGGCCATCGCGATGGCCATGTATCTGGTAGCACTAATGAAAGCGPR18 I231EGGTCAAGGAGAAGTCCGAACGGATCATCATGACCGGTCATGATGATCCGTTCGGACTTCTCCTTGACCADRA2A N51ACCGTGTTCGGCGCCGTGCTTGTCATCATTGCCGCGGCAATGATGACAAGCACGGCGCCGAACACGGADRA2A D130ACCATCAGCTTGGCTCGTTACTGGTCCGGACCAGTAACGAGCCAAGCTGATGGADRA2A D130TCCATCAGCTTGACTCGTTACTGGTCCGGACCAGTAACGAGTCAAGCTGATGGADRA2A T373ECCGCGAGAAGCGCTTCGAATTCGTGCTGGCGGCCGCCAGCACGAATTCGAAGCGCTTCTCGCGG\n\nLive- and Fixed-Cell Staining.\n\nHeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured (2.0 × 104 cells per ml) in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MEM+/+, Gibco, Grand Island, NY) on poly-l–lysine coated glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). Cells were transfected with a mixture of 0.5 μg cDNA and 7 μl fully deacylated polyethylenimine (PEI) at 7.5 mM in 100 μl MEM-/− overnight.\n\nFor live-cell staining, dishes were gently washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS+/+) to remove culture medium before a blocking solution, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DPBS+/+, was added for 30 minutes at 37°C. HeLa cells were then incubated with primary antibody (biotin-labeled anti-HA.11 clone 16B12, 1:200; Covance, Berkeley, CA) in blocking solution for 1 hour at 37°C. After gentle washing of cells with blocking solution, a streptavidin conjugated to quantum dot 655 (Qdot655) secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were washed with blocking solution for 10 minutes and then exchanged for DPBS+/+ before imaging.\n\nFor immunocytochemistry, dishes were gently washed with DPBS+/+ before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. After washing out fixative with DPBS+/+, HeLa cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Tween-20 in DPBS+/+ for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following solution exchange with DPBS+/+, a blocking solution, 2% BSA in Tris buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T; 10 mM Tris base, 250 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), was added for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibody (biotin anti-HA, 1:500; Covance) in blocking solution was incubated with cells overnight at 4°C. After cells were washed with TBS-T for 10 minutes, secondary antibody (streptavidin Qdot655, 1:500; Molecular Probes) incubation was for 2 hours at room temperature. Cells were washed with TBS-T for 10 minutes and then exchanged for DPBS+/+ before imaging.\n\nAll staining experiments included parallel negative controls, which received the same treatment except without primary antibody incubation.\n\nImaging.\n\nHeLa cells and neurons expressing EGFP-constructs were imaged using a 63× (1.2 numerical aperture) or 40× (1.2 numerical aperture) objective mounted on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope with ZEN 2008 acquisition software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For EGFP fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was 488 nm and emission wavelength was band-pass filtered between 500 and 550 nm. Qdot655 fluorescent images were acquired with 488-nm excitation and a 650- and 710-nm band-pass–filtered emission.\n\nWestern Blotting.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all reagents for Western blotting were from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Transfected HeLa cells were lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent with protease inhibitors for 5 minutes at room temperature. A reducing SDS loading buffer was added to lysates and heated, 85°C for 5 minutes, before electrophoresing samples on a 4–15% Tris-glycine precast gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with Laemmli running buffer (Laemmli, 1970). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 280 mA for 1 hour. The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in TBS-T for 3 hours before incubating overnight with a mouse anti-GFP antibody (1:2000; UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility, Davis, CA) at 4°C. A goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, 1 hour) in blocking solution was applied before chemiluminescent detection of blots with SuperSignal West Femto substrate and a Kodak Image Station 4000R (Carestream Molecular Imaging, Woodbridge, CT). Membranes were stripped with Restore PLUS stripping buffer and reprobed for loading controls. Rabbit anti-tubulin (1:2000, overnight; Cell Signaling, Boston, MA) and rabbit anti–cyclophilin B (1:5000, overnight; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) primary antibodies were used, followed by a goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, 1 hour) and chemiluminescent detection.\n\nSuperior Cervical Ganglion Neuron Dissociation and Intranuclear Microinjection of cDNA.\n\nAll animal studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nSuperior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons from adult (6–12 weeks old) male Wistar rats were dissected and dissociated as described previously (Ikeda, 2004; Ikeda and Jeong, 2004). Briefly, animals were anesthetized by CO2 inhalation and decapitated before dissection. Two SCGs per rat were removed, desheathed, cut into small pieces, and incubated in modified Earles’ balanced salt solution containing 2 mg/mL collagenase (CLS4; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ), 0.6 mg/mL trypsin (Worthington Biochemical) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase I at 36°C for 1 hour in a water bath shaker oscillating at 110 rpm. The Earles’ balanced salt solution was supplemented with 3.6 g/L d-glucose and 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES). After incubation, neurons were mechanically dissociated by vigorously shaking the flask for 10 seconds. Neurons were centrifuged at 570 rpm for 6 minutes and resuspended in MEM+/+ twice before being plated on poly-l-lysine–coated tissue culture dishes. Cells were maintained in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.\n\nThree to 6 hours after dissociation, plasmid constructs were injected directly into the nucleus of SCG neurons as described previously (Ikeda, 2004; Ikeda and Jeong, 2004; Lu et al., 2009). Briefly, cDNA was injected with a FemtoJet microinjector and 5171 micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using an injection pressure and duration of 140–160 hPa and 0.3 second, respectively. Injected plasmids were diluted in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and centrifuged in capillary tubes at 10000 rpm for at least 30 minutes. GPR18 constructs were injected at a concentration of 50–100 ng/μl, and ADRA2A mutants were injected at a lower concentration (10 ng/μl). To identify successfully injected neurons, pEGFP-N1 cDNA (Clontech) was coinjected at a concentration of 5 ng/μl. After injections, neurons were incubated overnight at 37°C and electrophysiologic experiments were performed the following day.\n\nElectrophysiology.\n\nCa2+-channel currents (ICa) and G protein–coupled inwardly rectifying K+ currents (IGIRK) were recorded using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp techniques (Hamill et al., 1981). Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.65 mm outer diameter, 1.20 mm inner diameter; King Precision Glass, Claremont, CA) using a Model P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The patch electrodes were coated with silicone elastomer (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and fire-polished. An Ag/AgCl pellet connected to the bath solution via a 0.15 M NaCl/agar bridge was used as a ground. The cell membrane capacitance was canceled and series resistance was compensated (>85% prediction and correction; lag set to 5 microseconds) with a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200A/B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Voltage protocol generation and data acquisition were performed using custom-designed software (S5) on a Macintosh G4 computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Current traces were filtered at 2 kHz (−3 dB; four-pole Bessel), digitized at 10 kHz with a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter board (ITC-18, HEKA, Bellmore, NY) and stored on the computer for later analyses.\n\nFor recording ICa, patch pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM) 120 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 20 tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEA-OH), 11 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 10 HEPES, 10 sucrose, 1 CaCl2, 14 Tris-creatine phosphate, 4 MgATP and 0.3 Na2GTP, pH 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid. External ICa recording solution consisted of (in mM) 140 methanesulfonic acid, 145 TEA-OH, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 10 CaCl2 and 0.0003 tetrodotoxin (TTX), pH 7.4 with TEA-OH. A Tris-based external ICa solution was also tested containing (in mM) 155 Tris-base, 20 HEPES, 10 glucose, 10 CaCl2 and 0.0003 TTX, pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid.\n\nTo measure G protein modulation of Ca2+-channels, a double-pulse protocol consisting of two 25-millisecond test pulses to +10 mV separated by a 50-millisecond conditioning pulse to +80 mV (Elmslie et al., 1990) was evoked every 10 seconds from a holding potential of −80 mV. To measure low- and high-voltage activated (LVA and HVA)-ICa in the same cell, two 25-millisecond pulses, the first to −40 mV and the second to +10 mV, separated by a 60-millisecond pulse to −60 mV, to inactivate LVA-ICa, was applied every 10 seconds from a holding potential of −80 mV. ICa-voltage relationships were studied by applying a series of 70-millisecond depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −80 mV.\n\nFor recording IGIRK, patch pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM) 135 KCl, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 4 MgATP, and 0.3 Na2GTP, pH 7.2 with KOH. External IGIRK recording solution consisted of (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 15 glucose, 15 sucrose, 2 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2 and 0.0003 TTX, pH 7.4 with NaOH.\n\nIGIRK were elicited from 200-millisecond voltage ramps from −140 to −40 mV and the holding potential was set to −60 mV.\n\nLive-Cell Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer–based Assay for cAMP.\n\nHuman embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (ATCC) were plated (5.0 × 105 cells per ml) on 24-well plates in MEM+/+. Cells were transfected overnight with a mixture of 150 ng cAMP sensor using YFP-Epac-RLuc (CAMYEL) cDNA (Jiang et al., 2007), 100 ng empty vector or selected G protein–coupled receptor cDNA and 4 μl PEI in 50 μl MEM−/− per well. Approximately 16 hours after transfection, HEK cells were removed from 24-well plates with TrypLE Express (Gibco) and washed twice in DPBS+/+ before being loading onto black 96-well microplates (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany).\n\nLight intensity was measured using a Tristar LB941 luminometer (Berthold) controlled by MikroWin 2000 acquisition software (Berthold). Net bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) was calculated from the light intensity measured alternately from donor and acceptor channels in 1-second intervals using the emission filters 460/60 nm and 542/27 nm, respectively (Semrock, Rochester, NY). For testing the kinetic responses of GPCRs coupled to Gαi/o pathways, 14 seconds of baseline recording, followed by injection of 5 μM h-coelenterazine (Nanolight Technology, Pinetop, AZ) substrate, 120 seconds of recording, injection of 1 μM forskolin, 240 seconds of recording, injection of agonist (10 μM NAGly or 100 μM glutamate), and 540 seconds of recording. For testing the kinetic responses of GPCRs coupled to Gαs pathways, 14 seconds of baseline recording, followed by injection of 5 μM h-coelenterazine, 120 seconds of recording, injection of agonist (10 μM NAGly or 10 μM dopamine), 240 seconds of recordings, injection of 10 μM forskolin, and 240 seconds of recording.\n\nDrugs and Chemicals.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TTX was purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel); pertussis toxin (PTX) and cholera toxin (CTX) were purchased from List Biologic Laboratories (Campbell, CA); NAGly, N-arachidonoyl-l-serine, AEA, Abn-Cbd, and O-1602 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); h-coelenterazine was purchased from Nanolight Technology (Pinetop, AZ), and dopamine hydrochloride was purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). PTX or CTX was added (0.5 μg/ml) to the culture medium, bathing SCG neurons or HEK cells during overnight incubation (>16 hours).\n\nDrugs for electrophysiologic experiments were diluted to final concentrations from stock solutions on the day of experiment and applied directly onto neurons using a custom-made gravity-fed perfusion system with separate perfusion lines feeding into a four-bore glass capillary tube (VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ) connected to a fused silica capillary tube. A constant flow of external solution was applied onto cells during baseline recordings and switched to a drug solution during drug applications to avoid flow-induced artifacts. All recordings were performed at room temperature (20–24°C).\n\nFor BRET experiments, drugs were injected into each well by the luminometer’s injection system. Before the start of experiments, all lines were primed with distilled water and then reprimed with the drug solution to be injected. Chemicals were made the day of experiments at a concentration so the total volume (injected volume + volume in well) would produce the final desired concentration.\n\nData Analysis and Statistical Testing.\n\nImageJ software, version 1.45I (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), was used to analyze and adjust contrast of images for presentation in figures. Igor Pro, version 6 (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR), was used to analyze current traces. ICa amplitude was measured isochronally 10 milliseconds after the initiation of a test pulse to 10 mV or at the maximum peak ICa during test pulses to −40 mV. The facilitation ratio (FR) was determined as the ratio of postpulse to prepulse ICa. The peak IGIRK was taken 3 milliseconds after the start of the ramp. Drug responses were normalized to baseline ICa or IGIRK using the equation Idrug/Ibaseline × 100, where Idrug and Ibaseline are the current amplitudes during and before drug application, respectively. Net BRET was calculated as A/D − d, where A is the acceptor channel intensity, D is the donor channel intensity, and d is the background or spectral overlap (calculated previously as the A/D for donor, Rluc8, alone). A single net BRET value, 4 minutes after injection of agonist, was used for comparison of net BRET values between groups.\n\nStatistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Individual data points were represented on graphs with the mean ± S.E.M. Statistical significance between two groups was determined using an unpaired t test. To compare three or more groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Newman-Keuls post-test was performed. P < 0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant finding, except when a multiple comparison Bonferroni correction was applied as indicated.\n\nHeterologous Expression of Full-length GPR18 at the Membrane.\n\nTo determine the cellular localization of heterologously expressed receptor, GPR18-EGFP cDNA was injected into SCG neurons and compared with injected EGFP and EGFP-KRas tail cDNA expression, which label the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of the cell, respectively. The GPR18 construct displayed a “rim-like” fluorescence ( , top panel). This pattern was unlike that of cytoplasmic EGFP ( , top panel) but was similar to the membrane-bound EGFP-KRas tail ( , top panel). Line plots of fluorescence intensity ( , top panel insets) show the highest intensity values along the edge of neurons injected with GPR18-EGFP or EGFP-KRas tail, whereas fluorescence intensities of EGFP-injected SCG neurons were uniform across the cell. HeLa cells were also transfected with EGFP-labeled constructs to compare expression in a cell line expression system ( , bottom panels). In expressing HeLa cells, GPR18-EGFP and EGFP-KRas tail displayed a “rim-like” fluorescence pattern and EGFP displayed fluorescence throughout the cell, similar to SCG neuron expression.\n\nWestern blotting was used to confirm expression of full-length GPR18. An antibody against GFP was used to detect EGFP-tagged receptor because commercially available antibodies for GPR18 have not been validated against a GPR18-knockout animal. An approximately 80-kDa band was detected in the GPR18-EGFP lane ( ). This band is larger than the predicted size of the protein, 66 kDa, which suggests post-translational modification of the receptor. The GFP antibody also detected EGFP and EGFP-KRas tail constructs, and their bands corresponded to the predicted protein mass, 27 and 29 kDa, respectively. The same blot was reprobed for loading controls α-tubulin and cyclophilin B, which corresponded to bands of 51 and 19 kDa, respectively ( ).\n\nTo confirm GPR18 expression in the plasma membrane, live-cell staining of epitope-tagged GPR18 was performed. The perimeter of HeLa cells expressing the external epitope-tagged version of GPR18, 3xHA-GPR18, was stained after the live-cell staining procedure (see Materials and Methods and ), whereas staining was absent in HeLa cells expressing the internal epitope-tagged version of GPR18, GPR18-3xHA ( ). To confirm expression of receptors, GPR18-3xHA-expressing cells were stained after fixation and permeabilization to allow antibody access to the interior of cells. Fixed and permeabilized GPR18-3xHA cells stained positive for the HA-epitope along the edge and within HeLa cells ( ). Staining was absent in negative controls (data not shown).\n\nTaken together, heterologously expressed GPR18 inserts with appropriate topology into the plasma membrane, where it is accessible to agonists and G proteins.\n\nDirect Potentiation of HVA-Ca2+ Channels by NAGly but No GPR18-Mediated Inhibition of ICa by NAGly.\n\nTo study coupling of GPR18 to G proteins, we used sympathetic neurons as a heterologous expression system. We have expressed non-native GPCRs in SCG neurons by intranuclear microinjection (Ikeda, 2004; Ikeda and Jeong, 2004; Lu et al., 2009) or RNA transfection (Williams et al., 2010) and reliably recapitulated endogenous G protein signaling pathways for study (Ikeda et al., 1995; Guo and Ikeda, 2004, 2005,Guo et al., 2008b). Furthermore, we can examine G protein activity in SCG neurons by measuring GPCR-mediated inhibition of endogenous Ca2+ current (ICa). We have previously shown that Ca2+-channels in SCG neurons are modulated by GPCRs coupled through various G protein families: Gαi/o (Ikeda et al., 1987, 1995; Ikeda, 1992; Zhu and Ikeda, 1993; Guo and Ikeda, 2004, 2005), including Gαz (Jeong and Ikeda, 1998), Gαs (Zhu and Ikeda, 1994), and Gαq/11 (Kammermeier et al., 2000).\n\nWe first examined the effect of NAGly application on ICa recorded from uninjected neurons. ICa was evoked at 0.1 Hz using a double-pulse voltage protocol ( , inset) in solutions designed to isolate ICa. The facilitation ratio (FR, ⊡), defined as the ratio of ICa evoked in the second test pulse (postpulse, , ⬤) to ICa in the first test pulse (prepulse, , ○), was used as a measure of Gβγ-mediated ICa modulation. NAGly (10 μM) potentiated ICa ( ), increasing both pre- and postpulse ICa and resulting in no change in the FR ( ). A lower concentration of NAGly (1 μM) did not produce a change in ICa. As a positive control for G protein activation, norepinephrine (NE; 10 μM) was applied to the same uninjected neuron. NE, activating endogenous α2-adrenergic receptors, produced a robust decrease in ICa and an increase in the FR ( ). Our laboratory has previously documented a direct effect of lipoamino acids on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Guo et al., 2008a). Here, we reproduced the result of enhanced ICa, in a voltage-dependent manner and a hyperpolarized ICa-voltage curve with NAGly ( ). NAGly had an effect on untagged GPR18-expressing SCG neurons similar to that of uninjected controls ( ). A lower dose of NAGly (1 μM) produced no change in ICa, and a higher dose increased ICa ( ) both pre- and postpulse currents ( ) with no change in FR ( ). NE-mediated inhibition of ICa persisted in untagged GPR18-expressing neurons ( ). Drug responses, expressed as ICa amplitude during drug application normalized to baseline ICa, were compared between both groups in . Responses to low or high concentrations of NAGly were not significantly different between uninjected controls and untagged GPR18-expressing neurons (unpaired t test, P > 0.05). NE responses were also not significantly different between uninjected controls and untagged GPR18-expressing neurons (unpaired t test; P > 0.05). In every cell tested, both concentrations of NAGly failed to inhibit ICa, whereas all exhibited NE-mediated inhibition of ICa. The enhancement of ICa by NAGly was not mediated by endogenous Gαi/o protein–coupled receptors because overnight incubation of uninjected and untagged GPR18-injected SCG neurons with PTX, which uncouples Gαi/o protein signaling from GPCRs, did not affect NAGly responses. After PTX treatment, NAGly still potentiated ICa in uninjected SCG neurons (106.9% ± 2.3% baseline ICa, n = 8) and untagged GPR18-expressing SCG neurons (112.4% ± 9.7% baseline ICa, n = 3).\n\nNAGly and NE responses were also tested in N- and C-terminal tagged versions of GPR18. ICa were potentiated by NAGly 114.6% ± 5.7% (n = 7), 105.1% ± 1.6% (n = 7), and 105.1% ± 2.8% (n = 5) from baseline ICa in GPR18-EGFP–, 3xHA-GPR18–, and GPR18-3xHA–expressing neurons, respectively. NE inhibited ICa 41.3% ± 3.7%, 43.1% ± 4.5%, and 42.9% ± 5.1% of baseline ICa in GPR18-EGFP–, 3xHA-GPR18–, and GPR18-3xHA–injected neurons, respectively. No significant difference in NAGly or NE responses was observed between untagged and tagged versions of GPR18 (one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05). Untagged GPR18 was heterologously expressed in cells for the rest of this study, unless otherwise stated.\n\nInhibition of LVA Ca2+ channels by NAGly (Barbara et al., 2009) was used as a positive control for agonist activity. SCG neurons do not endogenously express T-type Ca2+ channels ( ), so we injected cDNA encoding Cav3.1 or Cav3.2 into cells. LVA-ICa elicited by a test pulse to −40 mV ( , inset) was transiently activated showing fast inactivation during the 25-millisecond pulse ( ). Currents were also reversibly inhibited by application of 100 μM Ni2+ (Ni2+ inhibition of Cav3.1-expressing neurons, 17% ± 4.5% baseline ICa, n = 5; Ni2+ inhibition of Cav3.2-expressing neurons, 9.0% ± 1.1% baseline ICa, n = 5). NAGly applied to Cav3.1-injected SCG neurons inhibited LVA-ICa while potentiating HVA-ICa ( ). In SCG neurons injected with Cav3.2, NAGly-induced inhibition of LVA-ICa (64.1% ± 4.8% baseline ICa, n = 3) and potentiated HVA-ICa (106.1% ± 10.6% baseline ICa, n = 3). In SCG neurons coinjected with Cav3.1 and GPR18, NAGly inhibited LVA-ICa and potentiated HVA-ICa ( ). In cells injected with Cav3.2 and GPR18, NAGly inhibited LVA-ICa (52.1% ± 7.6% baseline ICa, n = 8) and potentiated HVA-ICa (109.3% ± 7.8% baseline ICa, n = 8). No significant difference in NAGly inhibition of LVA-ICa was observed between Cav3.1-expressing neurons with or without GPR18 coexpressed ( ; unpaired t test, P > 0.05). NAGly enhancement of HVA-ICa was also not significantly different between Cav3.1 alone and Cav3.1 with GPR18-expressing neurons ( ; unpaired t test, P > 0.05).\n\nTo ensure the external recording solution was not interfering with drug activity at the receptor, a Tris-based external ICa solution was also tested. No significant difference in NAGly responses was observed between uninjected and GPR18-expressing SCG neurons (for controls, 122.4% ± 3.2% baseline ICa, n = 9; for GPR18-expressing neurons, 115.5% ± 2.2% baseline ICa, n = 10; unpaired t test, P > 0.05) or NE responses (for controls, 44.1% ± 4.2%, n = 9; for GPR18-expressing neurons, 40.8% ± 2.7%, n = 10, unpaired t test, P > 0.05).\n\nAlthough a positive effect from GPR18 has been observed from mouse-derived cell lines endogenously expressing GPR18 (McHugh et al., 2010; Burstein et al., 2011; Takenouchi et al., 2012), most GPR18 studies have used human GPR18 (Gantz et al., 1997; Kohno et al., 2006; Qin et al., 2011; McHugh et al., 2012). To assess the variability of GPR18 across species, protein sequences from different species were analyzed by protein alignment. On the basis of GPR18 protein sequence alignment (Supplemental Fig. 1C), mouse GPR18 is 95.2% identical, 97% similar to rat GPR18 and 85.8% identical, 92.1% similar to human GPR18. The greatest divergence in GPR18 protein appears in the N terminus. Because the sequences are highly similar in the transmembrane domains and important signaling regions of GPCRs, we are confident our mouse GPR18 clone is similar to studies of human GPR18. Also, because mouse and rat GPR18 protein sequences are highly similar, we do not anticipate difficulty heterologously expressing the mouse GPR18 clone in rat neurons.\n\nThus, we observed direct effects of NAGly only on LVA-ICa and HVA-ICa that are not G protein mediated. Furthermore, we did not observe NAGly-mediated inhibition of HVA-ICa in GPR18-injected neurons.\n\nOther Potential Agonists of GPR18 Do Not Inhibit ICa.\n\nOther proposed agonists of GPR18 were tested on SCG neurons expressing GPR18, and inhibition of ICa was used as a measure of G protein activation ( ). N-arachidonoyl-l-serine (10 µM), another lipoamino acid, potentiated ICa in all groups tested: uninjected, GPR18-expressing, and CB1R-expressing SCG neurons. No significant difference between groups was observed (one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05). AEA (10 µM), the endocannabinoid neurotransmitter, did not inhibit ICa in uninjected or GPR18-injected cells. AEA inhibited ICa in CB1R-expressing neurons, which was significantly different from all groups (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Synthetic cannabinoids, abnormal cannabidiol and O-1602, had no effect on baseline ICa in uninjected or GPR18-expressing neurons. NE was applied to all cells as a positive control for G protein modulation and was found to inhibit ICa. NE responses from CB1R-injected neurons are significantly less than the other groups tested (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001), possibly because of the overexpression of exogenous receptor and sequestration of available G proteins from other GPCRs.\n\nMutations in GPCRs that Induce Tonic Receptor Activity Do Not Activate GPR18.\n\nTo bypass the need for agonists to activate GPR18, mutations that induce constitutive activity of receptors were introduced. These mutations were based on mutagenesis studies of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (Cotecchia et al., 1990; Kjelsberg et al., 1992; Scheer et al., 1996, 1997), as illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 2 with snake plot diagrams (Supplemental Fig. 2A) and sequence alignments (Supplemental Fig. 2B). Site-directed mutagenesis and primers listed in were used to generate mutants of GPR18 and a Gαi/o protein–coupled receptor, ADRA2A.\n\nThe properties of ICa inhibition induced by constitutively active Gαi/o-coupled receptors are analogous to the inhibition induced by agonist application: a high FR and kinetic slowing during prolonged voltage depolarization. Other GPCR responses may also be inhibited by expression of constitutively active receptors because excess free-Gβγ is loaded onto downstream effectors, thereby effectively reducing the dynamic range of Gβγ-mediated responses. Constitutively active GPCRs that inhibit ICa through voltage-independent mechanisms are more difficult to assess because inhibited currents display similar kinetics as uninhibited currents and the mechanisms responsible for ICa inhibition can be quite diverse. The overall reduction in ICa amplitude, or ICa density, may indicate tonic receptor activity for such mechanisms of ICa inhibition. Thus, basal FR, NE-mediated ICa inhibition, and ICa density were used as measures of tonic receptor activity.\n\nThe D/ERY motif is common in all GPCRs, and mutations in the first residue of the motif can induce constitutive activity of receptors (Scheer et al., 1996, 1997). Expression of a GPR18 version of this mutation, GPR18 D118T-EGFP, was localized primarily in a membrane network inside the cell, reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum, and not in the plasma membrane ( , left). A substitution mutation of the glutamate residue to alanine, an amino acid that confers less constitutive activity than threonine (Scheer et al., 1997), did not alter expression of the GPR18 mutant from the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown). ICa from GPR18 D118T-expressing neurons was elicited using the double-pulse voltage protocol ( , right) and were found to be indistinguishable from controls. The increase in ICa amplitude in the postpulse, following a long depolarizing conditioning pulse, represents relief of basal Gβγ-mediated inhibition of ICa and is responsible for a basal FR > 1. The basal FR measured in GPR18 D118T- and GPR18 D118A-injected neurons was similar to that in uninjected controls ( ). NE responses were also similar between GPR18 D118T and uninjected controls ( , right, and ). In contrast, ICa measured from SCG neurons expressing ADRA2A D130T had a significantly larger basal FR than its GPR18 mutant counterpart ( , unpaired t test, P < 0.05), which was clearly observed with the double-pulse voltage protocol ( ). The kinetic slowing of ICa was present during the first test pulse of ADRA2A D130T mutants ( ). The increased basal FR in ADRA2A D130T mutants was blocked by overnight PTX treatment (ADRA2A D130T basal FR after PTX, 1.3 ± 0.06, n = 7), indicating tonically active ADRA2A receptors coupled to Gαi/o proteins.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nConstructBasal FRNE Response (% Baseline ICa)ICa Density (pA/pF)GPR18 D118T1.3 ± 0.04 (13)36.7 ± 3.1 (13)−28.5 ± 3.5 (13)ADRA2A D130T2.2 ± 0.23 (18)a42.9 ± 5.0 (16)−22.8 ± 3.1 (18)GPR18 D118A1.2 ± 0.03 (23)46.2 ± 3.2 (22)−23.6 ± 2.6 (23)ADRA2A D130A1.8 ± 0.19 (12)a35.3 ± 4.5 (12)−25.1 ± 3.4 (12)GPR18 N40A1.3 ± 0.04 (14)43.6 ± 2.3 (13)−29.4 ± 3.3 (14)ADRA2A N51A2.6 ± 0.21 (11)a74.8 ± 11.1 (6)a−23.9 ± 4.8 (11)GPR18 I231E1.2 ± 0.04 (5)40.8 ± 6.8 (5)−17.7 ± 3.8 (5)ADRA2A T373E2.1 ± 0.3 (7)a32.7 ± 3.5 (6)−22.1 ± 3.3 (7)Uninjected1.3 ± 0.03 (14)39.9 ± 2.8 (13)−34.1 ± 4.1 (14)ADRA2A1.6 ± 0.2 (14)35.6 ± 5.5 (14)−20.8 ± 2.8 (13)\n\nMutations in the highly conserved asparagine residue within the first transmembrane domain of GPCRs (Supplemental Fig. 2, A and B) can also induce constitutive activity (Scheer et al., 1996). In addition, mutations in the C-terminal end of the third intracellular loop have been described for ADRA1B (Cotecchia et al., 1990; Kjelsberg et al., 1992) and ADRA2A (Ren et al., 1993) to induce constitutive activity. Analogous mutations were generated in GPR18 and ADRA2A, based on sequence alignment to ADRA1B (Supplemental Fig. 2B) and topographic location (Supplemental Fig. 2A), and constitutive activity was assessed. Mutations introduced into GPR18 failed to tonically active receptor, as measured by basal FR, NE response, and ICa density ( ). On the other hand, mutations designed to constitutively activate the ADRA2A receptor produced significantly larger basal FR than did similar mutations in GPR18 ( ; unpaired t test with multiple comparison correction, P < 0.017) and the ADRA2A N51A mutant significantly reduced the effectiveness of NE-induced inhibition of ICa.\n\nThus, mutations predicted to induce constitutive receptor activity did not activate GPR18 but were effective when introduced into ADRA2A receptors, which tonically activate Gαi/o signaling pathways.\n\nProposed GPR18 Agonists Do Not Inhibit ICa in SCG Neurons Expressing a Nonconstitutively Active Mutant of GPR18.\n\nA recent study found endogenous GPR18 is constitutively active and differentially expressed in melanoma metastases (Qin et al., 2011). However, we found no indication GPR18 expressed in SCG neurons was constitutively active (basal FR, 1.3 ± 0.04, n = 25; NE-mediated ICa inhibition, 47.4% ± 3.6% baseline ICa, n = 17; ICa density, −25.4 ± 2.2 picoamperes per picofarad, pA/pF, n = 25). This paper also describes a single amino acid residue responsible for conferring constitutive activity of GPR18 (A108) and mutating the residue to an asparagine restored NAGly-induced G protein signaling. We tested this constitutively active null mutant by monitoring ICa in SCG neurons during agonist application.\n\nHeLa cells transfected with GPR18 A108N-EGFP displayed a “rim-like” fluorescence pattern ( , left). In SCG neurons expressing GPR18 A108N, NAGly potentiated pre- and postpulse ICa elicited with the double-pulse voltage protocol ( , right). Other proposed agonists of GPR18, AEA and abnormal cannabidiol, were also tested in GPR18 A108N-injected cells, but neither induced ICa inhibition ( , lower panel). Only the positive control, NE, produced a significant reduction in ICa in GPR18 A108N-expressing neurons ( , one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001).\n\nNo Evidence of GPR18 Coupling to Gαz.\n\nThe lack of GPR18 activation by NAGly prompted us to explore possible coupling of GPR18 to other Gα proteins not endogenously expressed in SCG neurons. We have previously expressed Gαz in SCG neurons (Jeong and Ikeda, 1998) and found coupling of Gαz to endogenous GPCRs ( ). In Gαz-expressing cells, NE-induced ICa inhibition by a Gβγ-mediated mechanism: there were kinetic slowing of ICa during NE application in the first test pulse ( ), substantial relief of prepulse ICa inhibition by the conditioning pulse, and thus increase in FR during NE application ( ). The kinetics of NE activation and deactivation in Gαz-injected cells ( ) were slower than endogenous Gαi/o protein coupling ( ), which is consistent with the slower intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαz compared with Gαi or Gαo. Together with the persistence of NE-mediated inhibition of ICa in Gαz-expressing neurons after overnight PTX treatment ( ) suggests coupling of endogenous α2-adrenergic receptors to Gαz.\n\nNAGly slightly potentiated ICa in Gαz-injected SCG neurons ( ), increasing both pre- and postpulse ICa ( ) resulting in no change of the FR ( ). In SCG neurons injected with Gαz and GPR18, NE, but not NAGly, induced inhibition of ICa ( ) and increased the FR during NE application ( ). NAGly responses were not significantly different between uninjected, Gαz alone, GPR18 coexpressing Gαz and GPR18 A108N coexpressing Gαz groups ( , one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05). NE responses in PTX-treated neurons were significantly lower in Gαz alone, GPR18 coexpressing Gαz, and GPR18 A108N coexpressing Gαz groups compared with uninjected controls ( ; one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001).\n\nMutants of GPR18 designed to induce constitutive activity were also coexpressed with Gαz to test possible coupling. Basal FR was significantly reduced in SCG neurons expressing Gαz compared with uninjected controls (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001), but no significant difference in basal FR was found between the various GPR18 mutants when coexpressed with Gαz ( ). NE-induced inhibition of ICa was also unchanged across all groups tested ( ).\n\nTherefore, we found no evidence of GPR18 coupling to Gαz.\n\nNo Evidence of GPR18 Coupling to Gα15.\n\nPotential coupling of GPR18 to Gα15 was also tested. Gα15 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells (Giannone et al., 2010), similar to GPR18 expression. Although Gα15 is considered a promiscuous G protein, capable of coupling various classes of GPCRs, reconstitution of Gα15 signaling and functional coupling of this G protein to endogenous GPCRs in SCG neurons has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nTo demonstrate functional coupling of a GPCR to Gα15 in SCG neurons, we used ICa inhibition as an assay for G protein activity. Expression of Gα15 alone suppressed endogenous NE-mediated signaling (Supplemental Fig. 3A). This artifact of Gα protein overexpression, which sequesters available Gβγ protein, could be alleviated by coinjecting Gβ1 and Gγ2 with Gα15 to restore the stoichiometric balance of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (Supplemental Fig. 3B). The basal FR of Gα15 was also restored to uninjected control levels after coexpressing Gβ1γ2 (for Gα15 alone, basal FR, 1.0 ± 0.01, n = 16; for Gα15β1γ2, basal FR, 1.3 ± 0.02, n = 36). Endogenous α2-adrenoceptors do not couple to PTX-insensitive Gα15 because there was no NE-mediated inhibition of ICa in Gα15β1γ2-expressing cells after overnight PTX treatment (Supplemental Fig. 3C). Because mGluR2 has been shown to couple to Gα15 in vitro (Gomeza et al., 1996), mGluR2 and Gα15β1γ2 were coexpressed in SCG neurons and glutamate-induced inhibition of ICa after PTX treatment was measured ( ). The properties of ICa inhibition by mGluR2 coupled to Gα15 were distinct from mGluR2 coupled to Gαi/o (Supplemental Fig. 3, D and E): There was no kinetic slowing during the first test pulse of the double-pulse protocol, almost equal inhibition of the pre- and postpulse ICa and therefore a smaller change in the FR, and insensitivity to PTX. Gαi/o-mediated pathways still dominated mGluR2 signaling because glutamate induced a change in FR in cells coexpressing Gα15β1γ2 and mGluR2 (Supplemental Fig. 3F).\n\nIn PTX-treated SCG neurons injected with Gα15β1γ2 and GPR18, NAGly potentiated pre- and postpulse ICa evoked by the double-pulse voltage protocol ( ), with no change in the FR ( ). No NAGly-induced inhibition of ICa was observed in PTX-treated SCG neurons coexpressing Gα15β1γ2 and GPR18 or GPR18 A108N ( ), and NAGly responses were not significantly different between all groups tested (one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05). No NE-induced inhibition of ICa was observed in any PTX-treated group tested ( ).\n\nMutants of GPR18 designed to induce constitutive activity were also coexpressed with Gα15β1γ2 to test possible coupling. ICa density was significantly reduced in Gα15β1γ2 and mGluR2-injected neurons during glutamate application (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05) but mutants of GPR18 coexpressed with Gα15β1γ2 did not change ICa density compared with uninjected controls ( ).\n\nTherefore, we found no evidence of GPR18 coupling to Gα15.\n\nPotentiation of IGIRK by NAGly but No GPR18-mediated Potentiation of IGIRK.\n\nPrevious work has suggested GPR18 couples to Gαi/o protein signaling pathways (Kohno et al., 2006; McHugh et al., 2010, 2012; Takenouchi et al., 2012), but we have not observed any GPR18-mediated inhibition of ICa, which is a primary downstream effector of Gαi/o. We tested other effectors of Gαi/o proteins, including G protein–coupled inwardly-rectifying K+ currents (IGIRK), to further investigate GPR18 signaling. GIRK channels expressed in SCG neurons open upon G protein activation by a Gβγ-mediated mechanism.\n\nSCG neurons do not endogenously express GIRK channels, so we injected cDNA encoding homomeric GIRK channel subunits, GIRK4 S143T (Vivaudou et al., 1997). IGIRK was evoked at 0.1 Hz using a voltage ramp ( , inset) in solutions designed to isolate IGIRK. In SCG neurons expressing GIRK4 S143T, peak IGIRK increased during NAGly treatment ( ). As a positive control for Gαi/o protein activation, NE was applied and peak IGIRK also increased ( ). In SCG neurons expressing GIRK4 S143T and GPR18, both NAGly and NE potentiated IGIRK ( ). NE significantly increased IGIRK in SCG neurons expressing GIRK4 S143T with or without GPR18 ( ; one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001). But the modulation of IGIRK by NAGly was modest and only reached significance in SCG neurons expressing GIRK4 S143T alone with and without PTX treatment ( ), suggesting that the effect of NAGly on IGIRK is independent of GPR18 expression. Furthermore, NAGly’s effect on IGIRK is not Gαi/o protein mediated because overnight PTX treatment did not block NAGly responses on IGIRK but did block NE responses ( ).\n\nThus, NAGly activation of GPR18 was not observed with G protein modulation of IGIRK currents as an assay.\n\nNo NAGly-induced Change in cAMP Levels in GPR18-Expressing HEK Cells.\n\nAnother downstream effector of G proteins is adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to cAMP. Live-cell cAMP levels were monitored in HEK cells transfected with the BRET-based cAMP sensor, CAMYEL (Jiang et al., 2007), loaded onto a multiwell luminescence plate reader. Net BRET was calculated from measurements of light intensity from the acceptor and donor channels after application of enzyme substrate, h-coelanterizene. High net BRET values indicate low intracellular cAMP levels, and low net BRET values indicate high intracellular cAMP levels.\n\nThe ability of Gαi/o protein–coupled receptors to inhibit adenylate cyclase and reduce intracellular cAMP levels after forskolin stimulation was used as a measure of Gαi/o protein activation. Application of forskolin (1 μM) produced a decrease in net BRET, and NAGly application failed to change net BRET levels in empty vector- or GPR18-expressing HEK cells ( ). A comparison of net BRET values 4 minutes after NAGly application shows no significant difference between empty vector and GPR18-expressing cells ( ; unpaired t test, P > 0.05). Samples preloaded with NAGly 3 hours before experiments did not significantly reduce the forskolin-induced decrease in net BRET (for empty vector, net BRET, 0.19 ± 0.004, n = 10; for GPR18-expressing HEKs, net BRET, 0.20 ± 0.005, n = 10; unpaired t test, P > 0.05). On the other hand, glutamate treatment of mGluR2-transfected HEK cells increased net BRET values after forskolin stimulation, which was blocked by overnight PTX treatment ( ). The increase in net BRET values 4 minutes after glutamate application was significant for the mGluR2-transfected group ( ; one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05).\n\nGαs-coupled pathways stimulate adenylate cyclase and the ability of GPCRs to increase intracellular cAMP levels was used as a measure of Gαs-protein activation. NAGly did not significantly change net BRET levels in empty vector- or GPR18-expressing HEK cells ( ; unpaired t test, P > 0.05). But dopamine applied to D1R-transfected HEK cells was able to decrease net BRET values, which was blocked by overnight CTX treatment ( ). Only the D1R-transfected group significantly reduced net BRET values 4 minutes after dopamine application ( ; one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001).\n\nWith the BRET-based cAMP sensor, we found no evidence of NAGly-mediated GPR18 coupling to Gαi/o or Gαs signaling pathways."
