PSCA has been launching rockets since 1998 and was the first FAA-licensed spaceport not co-located on a federal range. One of the pioneering features of PSCA is its economic model. Since 2015, the spaceport has not accepted state or federal funds for operations & maintenance and must operate within earned revenues. As such, PSCA provides unqualified economic benefit to Alaska, stimulates innovation, and keeps the team focused on customer outcomes versus stifling bureaucratic processes. As one of only four orbital vertical rocket launch sites in the United States, PSCA plays a key role in providing resiliency for U.S. access to space. PSCA also enjoys the largest launch azimuth range of any spaceport in the U.S. and can access high-inclination, polar, and sun-synchronous orbits between 59° and 110° inclination.\n\nTwo command and control mission ops systems\n\nFixed and transportable Range Safety and Tracking Systems (RSTS)\n\nFiber optics broadband connectivity\n\nIndoor launch vehicle processing and storage\n\nPayload Processing Facility (PPF) cleanrooms and hypergol fueling\n\nCapability for liquid, solid, hybrid, and stratospheric balloons\n\n22 years of launch experience\n\nSuborbital and orbital launch scenarios\n\nLarge launch azimuth: 110 - 220 degrees (59 - 110 inclination)\n\nOff-axis tracking locations at spaceport and downrange\n\nRapid and Agile Space Launch (RASL) Innovation Center\n\nYear-round Launch\n\n6 pads total\n\n4 orbital-class pads,\n\n2 suborbital pads\n\nCalifornia\n\nDisclaimer: The following information was provided from each Spaceport at their own discretion; please contact the Spaceports with any questions or requests for information.\n\nMojave Air & Space Port\n\n1434 Flight Line, Mojave CA 93501\n\nFAA Licensed\n\nLicense Number: LSO 04-009 (in DRS)\n\nLaunch Type: Horizontal\n\nIssue Date: June 16, 2019\n\nExpiration Date: June 16, 2024\n\nArielle Sewell\n\nPhone: (661) 221-2192\n\nAddress:\n\n1434 Flightline St.\n\nMojave, California 93501\n\nMojave Spaceport Spotlight Handout\n\nCore Support Capabilities\n\nAir Traffic Control (NFCT-VFR, FAA/DoD-STARS, ADS-B)\n\nARFF, & Security, Aviation Fuel\n\nAirspace\n\nClass D/G, Restricted Airspace Access (R2508/2515)\n\nMOA access\n\nSupersonic Corridors (Black Mountain, PIRA, & High Altitude)\n\nAirfield Data\n\nRunway 12/30-12,500' x 200'\n\nRunway 08/26-7,049' x 100'\n\nRunway 04/22-4,745' x 60'\n\nRocket engine test sites\n\nProximity & Collaboration\n\nEdwards AFB, NAWS China Lake, & Vandenberg AFB\n\nLogistics\n\nHighway\n\nRail Spur\n\nCargo Aircraft\n\nSeaport\n\n3 Runways (Specs stated previously)\n\nUnited States Space Force\n\nVandenberg Air Force Base, CA\n\nFederally Licensed\n\nLaunch Type: Horizontal and Vertical\n\nCA Spaceport\n\nFAA License Expired\n\nFAA License Number: LSO 01-005 (in DRS)\n\nExpiration Date: October 1, 2019\n\nVandenberg Air Force Base | California Spaceport\n\nFAA License Expired\n\nFAA License Number: LSO 96-001 (in DRS)\n\nExpiration Date: September 18, 2001\n\n30th Space Wing, Program Requirements (XPR)\n\nPhone: (805) 606-1293\n\nAddress:\n\n1515 Iceland, Suite 1\n\nVandenberg AFB, CA 93437-5244257624\n\nSLC-8 POC: 2d Space Launch Squadron (2 SLS)\n\nPhone: (805) 605-3915\n\nAddress:\n\n806 13th Street, Bldg. 7015, Suite 218\n\nVandenberg AFB, CA, 93437-5244\n\nLaunch Pads\n\n8 Space Launch Complexes, 5 currently active with 3 currently available; working programmatic environmental assessment for up to 9 additional small-lift sites\n\nTwo vertical, orbital launch pads\n\nOne Runway (North VAFB): 15,000 by 200 feet, concrete\n\nLaunch Azimuths\n\n153°–240° (typical range, others possible pending analysis)\n\nOrbital Inclinations\n\n59°–125°\n\nSatellite Processing\n\nTwo commercially operated satellite processing facilities\n\nAirspace\n\nRestricted Airspace from Surface to Infinity (R-2516/2517, W-532S)\n\nRestricted Airspace from 500 ft AGL to Infinity (R-2534A/B)\n\nWarning Area Airspace and Temporary Flight Restrictions\n\nProximity & Collaboration\n\nEdwards AFB and NAWC-WD, Pt.

The scope of this comprehensive assessment is focused on launch vehicles capable of delivering payloads weighing 2,000 kg or less into low earth orbit. The purpose and need for this environmental assessment is to help enable the space sector's desire to transition from large, complex and expensive satellites to small, consumable, and low-cost satellites. Over the next decade, the transition to small and microsatellites is forecasted to significantly increase the demand for dedicated rides on small launch vehicles. With this in mind, the programmatic environmental assessment initiated by the 30th Space Wing includes nine launch sites having a combined capacity of 100 launches per year. Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is serving as a cooperating agency to ensure their requirements are fully addressed in the environmental assessment. The end goal is to allow our small launch customers an opportunity to evaluate a variety of different launch sites, select the site that best fits their needs, and to streamline subsequent environmental approvals required for individual launch programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDisclaimer: The following information was provided from each Spaceport at their own discretion; please contact the Spaceports with any questions or requests for information\n\nAdams County\n\n5200 Front Range Pkwy\n\nWatkins, CO 80137\n\nFAA Licensed\n\nLicense Number: LSO 18-017 (in DRS)\n\nLaunch Type: Horizontal\n\nIssue Date: August 16, 2018\n\nRenewal Date: August 16, 2023\n\nExpiration Date: August 17, 2028\n\nJeff Kloska, Director, Air and Space Port\n\nAddress:\n\nAdams County, Colorado\n\n5200 Front Range Parkway\n\nWatkins, CO 80137\n\nOffice: (720) 523-7310\n\nCell: (303) 564-7798\n\nFax: (303) 261-9195\n\nColorado Air and Space Port Handout\n\nHorizontal launch and recovery only\n\nSuborbital recovery with LSOL Amendment\n\nCore Support Capabilities\n\nAir Traffic Control (Serco CT-VFR, 3-ILS all wx approaches, GPS, ADS-B)\n\nARFF, & Security, Aviation Fuel\n\nAirspace\n\nClass D/G\n\nMOA access\n\nSupersonic Corridors (Kansas State Corridor)\n\nAirfield Data\n\nRunway 17/35-8,000' x 100'\n\nRunway 08/26-8,000' x 100'\n\nRocket engine test sites\n\nProximity & Collaboration\n\nBuckley SFB, Peterson AFB, Peterson-Schriever SF Garrison\n\nLogistics\n\nHighway\n\nRail Spur (Open 2022)\n\nCargo Aircraft\n\nTwo asphalt runways (8000 feet each)\n\nFlorida\n\nDisclaimer: The following information was provided from each Spaceport at their own discretion; please contact the Spaceports with any questions or requests for information.\n\n45th Space Wing\n\nCape Canaveral Space Force Station\n\n(CCAFS) FL 32920\n\nFederally Licensed\n\nLicense Number: LSO 10-014 (in DRS)\n\nLaunch Type: Vertical and Horizontal\n\nIssue Date: July 1, 2010\n\nRenewal Dates: July 1, 2015; July 1, 2020\n\nExpiration Date: July 1, 2025\n\n45th Space Wing's Plans and Programs Office\n\nPhone: (321) 494-4054\n\nCore Launch Capabilities\n\nLaunch Pads\n\nOver 40 launch pads have been used since the 1950s.

In 1965, Thiokol Corporation tested the world’s most powerful rocket engine in preparation for flights to the moon at the Camden County, Georgia site. Camden County was also considered as a possible alternate launch site for the Apollo Missions, a fact that was not declassified until 2005. The site is capable of supporting responsive, flexible, and low-cost access to space for small class vertical orbital and suborbital launch systems. Spaceport Camden could support year-round operations of up to twelve (12) launches per year with launch azimuths ranging between 83-115° from the launch point located at approximately 30.9° north latitude. Specific launch azimuths will depend on the launch vehicle / payload combination and the outcome of the vehicle-specific flight safety analysis. Spaceport Camden does not have existing range infrastructure, but portable range safety systems may be deployed upon request. Operators will be required to utilize Autonomous Flight Safety Systems (AFSS) to limit overhead costs and enhance safety. Flight safety impact limit lines will be required to minimize significant water closure areas and airspace impacts.\n\nThe site allows for the development and/or deployments of the following infrastructure:\n\nFlexible launch complex (“flat pad” or traditional launch pad)\n\nVehicle processing and storage facilities\n\nPayload Processing Facility (PPF) cleanrooms and hypergolic propellants\n\nTwo command and control mission operations centers\n\nPortable Range Safety and Tracking Systems (RSTS)\n\nFiber optics broadband connectivity\n\nAccess roads\n\nSite security\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDisclaimer: The following information was provided from each Spaceport at their own discretion; please contact the Spaceports with any questions or requests for information.\n\nNew Mexico Spaceport Authority\n\n234 Aleman Rd.\n\nTruth or Consequences, NM 87901\n\nNot a mailing or shipping address.\n\nFAA Licensed\n\nLicense Number: LSO 08-011 (in DRS)\n\nLaunch Type: Horizontal and Vertical\n\nIssue Date: December 14, 2023\n\nExpiration Date: December 14, 2028\n\nScott McLaughlin\n\nOffice: (575) 267-8500\n\nAddress\n\n4605 Research Park Circle, Suite A\n\nLas Cruces, NM 88001\n\nSpaceport America Spotlight Handout\n\nAll Launch\n\n6,000 sq. mi. of restricted airspace, ground to unlimited\n\nCoordination with White Sands Missile Range\n\n340+ days of sunshine, low humidity, and high elevation\n\nBuild-to-suit available\n\n18,000+ acres\n\nUtilities: water, electric, high speed fiber optic cable\n\nAWOS: Automated Weather Observing System certified by the FAA and maintained to FAA requirements\n\n24-hour guarded entrance with badged-only access\n\n24-hour on-site emergency fire and rescue equipment and personnel\n\nExtremely low population density\n\nRadar, meteorology, telemetry and optics support through White Sands Missile Range\n\nPaved road to site\n\nNearby railroad\n\nHorizontal Launch\n\n12,000' x 200' concrete runway\n\nPrime aerospace/aviation land and some existing facilities available for lease and development\n\nSupport of both government and commercial spaceflight:\n\nOrbital/suborbital\n\nCrewed/uncrewed\n\nPotential for development of:\n\nMultiple hangars with offices and shops\n\nPassenger processing or training and operations facility\n\nAssembly, processing and manufacturing facility\n\nPropellant and fueling facilities\n\nVertical Launch\n\nOne 200-sq ft general purpose launch pad\n\nTwo 10-m diameter general purpose pads\n\nFour general purpose modular buildings\n\n2 sq mi of space for development\n\nBuilding 40-ft general-use rocket launch rail\n\nRocket engine test sites\n\nDedicated launch rail and support structures\n\nDedicated solid motor fabrication facility\n\nAdvanced Technology Area\n\nHosts non-traditional launch facilities and aerospace technology development\n\nState of New Mexico Benefits\n\nJob Training Incentive Program\n\nLocal Economic Development Act Grants\n\nTax Credits and Deductions\n\nHorizontal Launch Area Location\n\n32 deg 59 min 28.3 sec N\n\n106 deg 58 min 11.5 sec W\n\nVertical Launch Are Location\n\n32 deg 56 min 25.0 sec N\n\n106 deg 55 min15.2 sec W\n\nOklahoma\n\nDisclaimer: The following information was provided from each Spaceport at their own discretion; please contact the Spaceports with any questions or requests for information.\n\nOklahoma Space Industry Development Authority\n\n121 1st St\n\nBurns Flat OK 73624\n\nClinton-Sherman Airport (KCSM)\n\nFAA Licensed\n\nLicense Number: LSO 06-010 (in DRS)\n\nLaunch Type: Horizontal\n\nOriginal Issue Date: June 11, 2006\n\nExpiration Date: June 4, 2026\n\nCraig J.

WFF operates a Research Range which is centered around providing a fast, low-cost, highly flexible, and safe response to the needs of U.S. aerospace interests, both commercial and government. MARS is positioned perfectly between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C. and Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nAs a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Virginia Space provides economic support to the Eastern Shore of Virginia by both job development and tourist interest. As one of only two launch sites on the east coast providing access to space and ISS resupply, Virginia space provides a key component to economic growth, commercial access to space and is a national asset.\n\nMARS Operational Sites include a multi-pad launch complex, an airfield for Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS), a recently commissioned Payload Processing Facility and a newly constructed launch vehicle Integration and Control Facility (ICF). All MARS facilities are maintained and operated by an experienced Virginia Space team, with expertise in cryogenic systems, high-pressure vessels, state of the art command and control systems, hydraulic systems, and high-capacity environmental control systems.\n\nMARS Launch Complex 0 currently includes Pad 0A, Pad 0B and newly constructed Pad 0C, located on NASA's Wallops Research Range.\n\nMARS Pad 0A is a medium class launch facility for liquid fueled vehicles. It currently hosts Northrop Grumman's Antares Launch Vehicle.\n\nMARS Pad 0B is a small to medium class launch facility for solid and liquid fueled vehicles. It currently hosts Northrop Grumman's Minotaur family of Launch Vehicles.\n\nMARS Pad 0C is a venture class launch facility for liquid fueled vehicles. It currently hosts Rocket Lab's Electron Launch Vehicle and is referred to as LC-2 by Rocket Lab.\n\nThe MARS UAS Airfield supports primarily unmanned platforms but can also accommodate conventional manned platforms. The Airfield includes a 3000' x 75' airstrip for horizontal flight operations, an integrated 120' x 130' vertical landing pad and a purpose-built hangar and adjacent apron area. The site is secluded from the remainder of the facility with a single restricted access entrance and limited line of sight to other areas of the facility.\n\nThe MARS Payload Processing Facility (PPF) provides 21,000 gross SF of separable processing space for launch vehicles (LV) and space vehicles (SV) from arrival to encapsulation. The PPF was designed and built to accommodate both highly sensitive and classified payloads in support of science and national security missions. The facilities processing spaces include; one 80' tall Processing Bay and Airlock utilizing a 30-ton traveling bridge crane with a 60' hook height, one 40' tall Low Bay Cleanroom and Integration Room, and multiple side rooms for fuel conditioning, control, and ride share processing.\n\nWallops Flight Facility\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n\n7414 Atlantic Rd.\n\nWallops Island, VA 23337\n\nFederally Licensed\n\nScott Schaire, Chief, Advanced Projects Office\n\nOffice: (757) 824-1120\n\nMore information on the Office of Spaceports\n\nDisclaimer: The following information was provided from each Spaceport at their own discretion; please contact the Spaceports with any questions or requests for information."
