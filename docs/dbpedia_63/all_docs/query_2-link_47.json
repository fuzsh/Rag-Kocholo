        "text": "I get asked all the time by brands and businesses alike of all sizes, \"What kind of content should I create?\", \"Why do I need to create content?\", and \"Posting on social media, that‚Äôs marketing right?\" I will answer all of these questions below: Let's start with the big question: Why do I need to create content? In the digital world we live in where everyone is connected more than ever, content is the gateway to getting to know a new coffee shop, a new comedian, breaking news in your city, or the new show you should binge. It‚Äôs where we get our information and identify the ideals that we believe, or reinforce the ideals we don‚Äôt believe in. Social media truly shapes social behavior. Businesses and brands can do this for their products or services. Through organic content, or Strategic Organic Content (SOC), you can shape the ideals of and mindsets of the target customer you are attempting to reach. I‚Äôll dive deeper tomorrow. See you then üëã\n\nSo LinkedIn asked me (in those silly question thingys it does)... Can you build a brand with content? Rather than help LinkedIn ... I'll help my peeps. Simple answer.... no. Now, I've been a contrarian in the \"content marketing\" revolution for over 20 years now. I think all those \"gurus\" in that \"movement\" (if one can call it that) are just all full of crap. There is only one tried and true way to \"build a brand\" - that's through broadcast advertising combined with actually making a decent product or service and then having the apparatus to deliver it well enough at \"the moment of truth\" and post that moment... BMW, for example, is the ultimate driving machine because of billions of dollars of ads on TV and in print the past 46 years. Not because BMW wrote some blog BS nonsense on LinkedIn. I know Gary V... Mr. Hype BS NFT nonsense as of late... is all about \"content\" and the \"content\" and the this and the that... and content... Really Gary? Do you do that at Vayner? You had one decent piece of content... your Cubbies Commercial... which I'll grant for you, was absolutely spect-freaking-tackular... And guess what... it ran on TV... for AB. It wasn't a LinkedIn post... it wasn't a YouTube thing... It wasn't \"Hey guys... I'm Harry Carey... and today, we're going to talk about Baseball.\" :P BROADCAST builds brands. Mass media. And it's not about \"giving\" or \"value\" to build a brand. It's about TONNAGE. MEDIA WEIGHT. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Just pounding away... even when the creative sucks (which is more frequent than the creative being awesome.) Yes, it helps to be Weiden+Kennedy and come up with \"Just do it.\" But Addidas continues to dominate because of MEDIA WEIGHT. Yes, it helps to Benton and Bowles and come up with \"Don't Squeeze the Charmin.\" But again... billions of dollars in media weight built that brand. Brands are about quickhand... they're about becoming part of the lexicon of language... That level of \"inception\" cannot be achieved through a LinkedIn post or people dinking around on YouTube... with their \"content.\" People like to talk about Kim Kardashian as an example... about social media... Yeah right... the fact that she, her sisters, her mother, etc., were on MTV for 17 years... that didn't matter. :) TV. PRINT. TV. PRINT. TV. Print. That is how brands are built. Still to this day that's how brands are built. Not content. Content can help you to build a following in a niche. Can help you maybe find a group of people that are like \"hey - he's cool...\" That's NOT A BRAND. But that's totally ok for like 99.99999999999999999% of you. You're not Budweiser trying to sell 200 million cans of beer each week (roughly). Most of you need what Kevin Kelly described as \"a thousand true fans.\" That you can do with content. But you cannot... CAN NOT... build a brand via content. Not even Kim did... MTV... 20 years worth of it... #changemymind #marketing #advertising #branding\n\nIn my Content Mktg class, I give a lecture (boldly) predicting the future of each social platform. Well‚Ä¶I‚Äôve never been more bulls eye with a prediction. üéØ I start by asking my students a simple question: \"What is the business objective of social media?\" They always start by telling me it‚Äôs about connection, linking people together, disseminating information. \"You‚Äôre wrong\", I tell them. The business goal is to generate revenue. ‚¨á Revenue comes from advertisers ‚¨á Advertisers need eyeballs (that‚Äôs why YOU are referred to as the product) ‚¨á To get the eyeballs, you need great content. ‚¨á As soon as the content stops being great, it‚Äôs over (that‚Äôs what we see happening on FB & X). Crudely speaking, social media is funded by Advertisers. Actually, that‚Äôs not crude. It‚Äôs a fact. 97% of Meta‚Äôs profit comes from ads. What advertisers need is ROI. You can‚Äôt get ROI if people that are served the ad, don‚Äôt watch the ad. So‚Ä¶HERE WE GO. Instagram is testing unskippable ads. I‚Äôve been predicting this since 2021. (Yes, I feel smug). Where do I think this will go? Another bold prediction: I think we‚Äôll be on social media less. ‚úç Will you spend less time scrolling IG if you have to watch the full ad? ‚ôª I want to have a BIG conversation about this, please re-share! *** Follow me, Marina Cooley, for more on Content Marketing and the Future of Work.\n\n‚ú® 2024 is all about Social Content Repurposing. This is something I've done in my own business, and have helped some of my previous clients with, without actually adding it to my portfolio. üò± Content repurposing is something I have a LOT of experience in, and I'm shocked that many businesses haven't incorporated it into their social media strategy. ü§Ø Like, SERIOUSLY. SHOCKED!!! üí∞ So, if you have a HUGE (or even a small) content bank that is gathering dust, I can help you to repurpose it. üß† When I say \"repurpose\", I don't mean just \"repost\". You need to take into account the platform you want to repurpose to, your audience, and the type of content you already have. ‚ôüÔ∏è So, yes, there are a lot of moving parts. And if this sounds like too much for you to comprehend, then I'm here to help you! üì© Feel free to send me a message to learn more.\n\nContent is king, but a strategy is the crown. In the vast realm of digital marketing, content wears the crown. It's not just about churning out articles or posts; it's about crafting a strategy that supports your business goals. Identify your audience, tailor content to their needs, and choose the right channels: Know Thy Audience: Who are they? What are their preferences? A deep dive into your audience's desires and pain points is key to creating content that resonates. Tailor Content to Their Needs: Once you've identified your audience, tailor your content to meet their needs. It's not about what you want to say; it's about what they want to hear. Address their challenges, answer their questions, and provide solutions fit for them. Choose the Right Channels: Different platforms serve different purposes. Are your consumers more active on social media, or do they prefer a well-crafted email? Now, let's open the floor to your challenges in content strategy. Is it grappling with ever-changing algorithms? Navigating the intricacies of diverse audience segments? Or perhaps, measuring the impact of your content? Share your thoughts and challenges in the comments. #ContentStrategy #MarketingTips\n\nYou're wasting your time creating content. 59.41% of all social media posts get 0 engagement. Not 1 like, comment, share,.. That's almost 60%! So should you give up? Absolutely No! Just focus on these things: 1. Talk About Something New: This doesn‚Äôt mean you need to invent a whole new niche (which is nearly impossible these days). Instead, create content on trending topics but add your own perspective and opinions. Your unique viewpoint is what will make you stand out. 2. Create with Purpose: Don‚Äôt create just for the sake of creating , or solely for likes, views, and followers. While these metrics matter, you need a solid purpose and a strong ‚ÄúWHY.‚Äù Without this, it‚Äôs easy to give up when results don‚Äôt come quickly. Most creators quit just after a month because they lack a clear reason behind their efforts. A strong ‚ÄúWHY‚Äù will keep you patient and persistent. 3. Focus on Your Hook: In today‚Äôs content-saturated world, attention spans are incredibly short. Facebook data shows that the average attention span for video content is 2.5 seconds on a desktop and just 1.7 seconds on mobile. Now, you might wonder, ‚ÄúHow can I convey my brand in just two seconds?‚Äù But instead of feeling discouraged, remember that a powerful hook can make those two seconds count. Crafting a compelling hook is the most essential part of creating content. Do these three things and your content WILL get noticed. I promise.
