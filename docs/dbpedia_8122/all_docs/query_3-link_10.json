No man is free who cannot command himself.”\n\n― Pythagoras\n\nPythagoras, a renowned ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician, developed a unique and influential philosophical system that combined elements of mysticism, mathematics, and spirituality. His teachings, known as Pythagoreanism, had a profound impact on Western thought and continue to resonate with contemporary ideas in psychology and personal growth. This blog post will explore the key elements of Pythagorean philosophy and examine how they relate to Jungian psychology and the individuation process.\n\nThe Pythagorean Concept of Harmony and Proportion:\n\nAt the heart of Pythagorean philosophy is the idea that the universe is governed by harmony and proportion. Pythagoras believed that everything in the cosmos could be understood in terms of mathematical relationships and that these relationships were the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe."
