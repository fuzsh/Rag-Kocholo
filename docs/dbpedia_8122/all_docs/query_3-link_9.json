        "text": "In geometry, the Pythagoreans cannot be credited with any proofs in the Euclidean sense. They were evidently concerned, however, with some speculation on geometrical figures, as in the case of the Pythagorean theorem, and the concept that the point, line, triangle, and tetrahedron correspond to the elements of the tetraktys, since they are determined by one, two, three, and four points, respectively. They possibly knew practical methods of constructing the five regular solids, but the theoretical basis for such constructions was given by non-Pythagoreans in the 4th century.\n\nIt is notable that the properties of the circle seem not to have interested the early Pythagoreans. But perhaps the tradition that Pythagoras himself discovered that the sum of the three angles of any triangle is equal to two right angles may be trusted. The idea of geometric proportions is probably Pythagorean in origin; but the so-called golden section—which divides a line at a point such that the smaller part is to the greater as the greater is to the whole—is hardly an early Pythagorean contribution (see golden ratio). Some advance in geometry was made at a later date, by 4th-century Pythagoreans; e.g., Archytas offered an interesting solution to the problem of the duplication of the cube—in which a cube twice the volume of a given cube is constructed—by an essentially geometrical construction in three dimensions; and the conception of geometry as a “flow” of points into lines, of lines into surfaces, and so on, may have been contributed by Archytas; but on the whole the numerous achievements of non-Pythagorean mathematicians were in fact more conspicuous than those of the Pythagoreans.\n\nMusic\n\nThe achievements of the early Pythagoreans in musical theory are somewhat less controversial. The scientific approach to music, in which musical intervals are expressed as numerical proportions, originated with them, as did also the more specific idea of harmonic “means.” At an early date they discovered empirically that the basic intervals of Greek music include the elements of the tetraktys, since they have the proportions 1:2 (octave), 3:2 (fifth), and 4:3 (fourth). The discovery could have been made, for instance, in pipes or flutes or stringed instruments: the tone of a plucked string held at its middle is an octave higher than that of the whole string; the tone of a string held at the 2/3 point is a fifth higher; and that of one held at the 3/4 point is a fourth higher. Moreover, they noticed that the subtraction of intervals is accomplished by dividing these ratios by one another. In the course of the 5th century they calculated the intervals for the usual diatonic scale, the tone being represented by 9:8 (fifth minus fourth); i.e., 3/2 ÷ 4/3, and the semitone by 256:243 (fourth minus two tones); i.e., 4/3 ÷ (9/8 × 9/8). Archytas made some modification to this doctrine and also worked out the relationships of the notes in the chromatic (12-tone) scale and the enharmonic scale (involving such minute differences as that between A flat and G sharp, which on a piano are played by the same key).\n\nAstronomy\n\nIn their cosmological views the earliest Pythagoreans probably differed little from their Ionian predecessors. They made a point of studying the stellar heavens; but—with the possible exception of the theory of musical intervals in the cosmos—no new contributions to astronomy can be ascribed to them with any degree of probability. Late in the 5th century, or possibly in the 4th century, a Pythagorean boldly abandoned the geocentric view and posited a cosmological model in which the Earth, Sun, and stars circle about an (unseen) central fire—a view traditionally attributed to the 5th-century Pythagorean Philolaus of Croton."
