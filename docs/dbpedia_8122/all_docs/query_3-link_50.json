        "text": "Introduction – The Life And Philosophy of Pythagoras\n\nPythagoras of Samos was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher who lived in the 6th century BC. An influential yet mysterious figure shrouded in legends, he authored no writings himself but imparted extensive mathematical and philosophical wisdom. Today Pythagoras is hailed primarily for the Pythagorean theorem relating triangle sides in geometry, which transformed mathematics and physics.\n\nHowever, through the life And philosophy of Pythagoras and his Pythagorean society, he made seminal contributions across areas like numeric theory, symbolic logic, mathematical notation, astronomy models, and music theory that profoundly impacted ancient and modern understanding of mathematics as a descriptor of universal truths. To learn more about the relation of astronomy and mathematics, read Role of Astronomy in Mathematics.\n\nEarly Life and Education of Pythagoras\n\nPythagoras was born around 570 BC on the Greek island of Samos, situated off the western coast of Asia Minor. Little concrete evidence exists about his early childhood, though legends suggest his birth was prophesied by oracles.\n\nAt the time, Samos harbored immigrants of various origins including Egyptians, Jews, Phoenicians and Babylonians. This cosmopolitan harbor town facilitated a melting pot of cultures and belief systems that likely influenced the life And philosophy of Pythagoras and his intellectual development.\n\nWide-Ranging Studies and Influences\n\nFrom Greek writers to Eastern mystics across Egypt and Mesopotamia, Pythagoras accumulated extensive knowledge through his travels. He is said to have studied under masters like Thales and Anaximander expanding his mathematics and astronomy expertise in addition to absorbing religious philosophies on issues of morality, unity of opposites, harmony and more. This confluence of teachers and schools of thought all contributed to the life And philosophy of Pythagoras, synthesizing uniquely in his worldview.\n\nPythagoras’ Journey to Egypt\n\nHaving exhausted the knowledge limits of his various mentors in Samos, legends contend that sometime around 550 BC an impatient Pythagoras embarked for Egypt seeking higher mathematical revelations said to be guarded by ancient priests.\n\nIn Egypt, Pythagoras found a welcoming intellectual refuge and is said to have intensely studied sacred geometry and astronomy with temple priests for over two decades. From the Egyptians, he acquired advanced knowledge on topics like triangular numbers, geometric algebra, and practical accounting techniques among other insights.\n\nThis lengthy sojourn in Egypt proved formative, sparking Pythagoras’ innate mathematical genius by exposing him to novel algebraic concepts he later built upon to derive his eponymous theorem.\n\nTo learn about basic algebra, read Introductory Algebra.\n\nThe Pythagorean Brotherhood\n\nThe Pythagorean Brotherhood, also known as the Pythagorean School or Pythagorean Community, was a philosophical and religious community established by Pythagoras, the ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher, in the 6th century BCE. The Brotherhood played a significant role in the development of both mathematics and philosophy, driven by the life And philosophy of Pythagoras in ancient Greece.\n\nCurriculum and Tenets of The Pythagorean Brotherhood\n\nPythagoras instructed members of the society in a curriculum fusing arithmetic, music, astronomy and geometry with philosophical-religious principles like metempsychosis (reincarnation), respect for beans, and worship of numbers themselves. The society pursued understanding reality through the certainty of math calculations and logic.\n\nThe tight-knit community shared property, adopted vegetarianism, wore white clothes, and perpetuated various taboos and rituals under the authoritarian rule of the life And philosophy of Pythagoras. They expanded the society’s influence across Southern Italy, though were ultimately persecuted. Nonetheless, the Pythagoreans indelibly shaped philosophical and mathematical inquiry for centuries.\n\nPythagoras’ Contributions to Mathematics\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem\n\nPythagoras’ most celebrated legacy is his theorem establishing the fundamental relation between the sides in any right triangle – where the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of opposite sides. While no written record of Pythagoras’ original proof survives, it enabled quantitative analysis in geometry.\n\nIf you’re interested in Geometry, try reading Geometry of a Snowflake.\n\nThe deceptively simple Pythagorean theorem became a building block underlying important mathematical feats – from calculating triangular area and volume, determining distances in surveying, to navigation by stars.\n\nAdditional Mathematical Breakthroughs\n\nBeyond his famous theorem, Pythagoras analyzed number sequences leading him to identify special integer-based right triangles called Pythagorean triples obeying the pattern. This hinted at number theory as a foundation of mathematical reality.\n\nPythagoras also devised theories connecting music intervals to numeric ratios, sparking mathematical musicology to explain harmony via quantifiable periodic vibrations. This embodied his view of numbers as the substrate linking all disciplines.\n\nPythagoras’ Influence on Geometry\n\nPythagoras pioneered the concept of mathematical proofs, elevating geometry from a practical measurement tool to an abstract deductive science. Though his original writings are lost, his systematic approach became the model for logically demonstrating mathematical truths via rigorous deduction-based proofs – a landmark in mathematical theory.\n\nAdditionally, his geometric insights seeded further pioneering theorems by followers like the Pythagorean philosopher Hippasus on irrational numbers and incommensurability of diagonal and side lengths – expanding mathematical theory beyond just rational numbers.\n\nTo learn about geometrical aspects of Snowflakes, read Geometry of a Snowflake.\n\nFoundations for Euclid’s Elements\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, Euclid built upon Pythagoras’ Proposition proofs as the foundation for his seminal 13-volume work Elements deriving fundamental geometric axioms still taught globally. Pythagoras’ use of elemental geometric proofs provided the early template.\n\nPythagoras’ Fueling Greek Math\n\nMore broadly, Pythagoras inspired Plato, Aristotle and Archimedes to also frame mathematics as underpinning all scientific inquiry, catalyzing Greek mathematics as a whole. His quantitative philosophy persisted for centuries.\n\nTo learn about the Contributions of Archimedes, read Archimedes Inventions Timeline.\n\nPythagoras’ Contributions to Philosophy\n\nPythagoras pioneered melding mathematics with grander explanations of reality’s inner workings. To him, mathematical relationships like harmonic ratios and numeric patterns in nature revealed the orderly, quantitative structure behind the physical and spiritual worlds alike.\n\nThis viewpoint of an intrinsically mathematical cosmos led Pythagoras to posit all elements of existence being fundamentally number-based – from celestial orbits obeying predictable cycles to musical tones conforming to fraction-based frequencies. Mathematics governed everything.\n\nThough Pythagorean metaphysics faded, his mathematical mysticism directly fertilized Platonic philosophy. The idea of an abstract realm of math forms and absolutes underlying flawed earthly matter persisted for centuries to influence thinkers from Gnostics to Kepler during the Scientific Revolution, underscoring Pythagoras’ immense legacy.\n\nControversies and Mysteries about Pythagoras\n\nPythagoras imposed strict secrecy and mystical rites in his society, forcing members to adhere to codes of silence outside while allegedly only gradually welcoming them into higher echelons of hidden knowledge. This esotericism left no extant record from his or early followers’ own hand, obscuring authorship.\n\nAs such scholars still debate if innovations like the golden ratio or the Pythagorean theorem itself originated from Pythagoras personally versus the wider school. Such uncertainty persists around separating the historical Pythagoras from teachings of the society he founded but may not have personally derived.\n\nTo learn more about Golden Ratio, read Golden Ratio of the Human Body.\n\nIn the centuries after his death, legends grew of Pythagoras possessing supernatural powers. Neo-Pythagorean followers propagated far-fetched myths based on forged ‘sacred writings’ to elevate Pythagoras as a miracle-worker eroding objective assessments. In truth, besides the theorem bearing his name, historians can only tenuously connect assorted discoveries to Pythagoras the man rather than the later Pythagoreans who continued expounding his mathematical philosophy.\n\nPythagoras’ Later Years and Legacy\n\nAround 530 BC political upheavals likely forced Pythagoras to abandon Samos for the Greek colony of Croton in Southern Italy. There he fully devoted himself to spreading mathematical philosophy through his society as an exile revered sage.\n\nPythagoras died around 495 BC aged 75 with conflicting reports of him perishing in an arson attack or fleeing persecution to starve himself. Regardless of the exact circumstances, the Pythagoreans faced growing hostility in Italy. But the numerical mystic’s unique synthesis of mathematical principles with cosmological ideas already began immortalizing his insights.\n\nOver two millennia since his lifetime, the life And philosophy of Pythagoras still remains revered as the driving force linking abstract mathematics to universal order. From Euclid’s proofs to Kepler’s celestial models, Pythagoras mathematized of the cosmos inspired the evolution of geometry, physics, astronomy and philosophy itself through the ages.\n\nConclusion – The Life And Philosophy of Pythagoras\n\nPythagoras of Samos pioneered numerating the cosmos itself. Inspired by polymathic studies from Ancient Greece to Egypt, he contended numbers and quantifiable logic comprised the divine code behind existence’s very fabric. From approximating 600BC until death, Pythagoras helmed an esoteric brotherhood spreading his mathematical mysticism through the life And philosophy of Pythagoras and geometric explorations interweaving fields as diverse as music, astronomy and metaphysics. Through deductive geometry, number theory and more, Pythagoras’ fusion of mathematics with cosmology and spirituality ignited inquiries into natural law that still burn brightly."
