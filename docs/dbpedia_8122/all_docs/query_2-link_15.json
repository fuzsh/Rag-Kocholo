        "text": "“Who are the most influential ancient Greek philosophers?” Most people would answer with big names like Socrates, Plato or Aristotle. However, before these legends came to the scene there were titans that roamed the Earth, and the one that I want to focus on for this episode is Pythagoras.\n\nPythagoras is an interesting character ― his story is fascinating, to say the least. He was a mathematician at heart, similar to his predecessors, but unlike his forefathers he was a spiritual guru. Moving on, you’ll notice a lot more big twists in the story, with Pythagoras there is always a ‘but’ in between. (I see how this could sound wrong)\n\nHis spiritual pursuit brought him to Croton later on in his life, where he established a society of disciples. His society had strange rules, for example, one of their rules was “do not eat beans”.\n\nMost cults usually have a charismatic leader, and Pythagoras never shied away from glamorizing himself. It’s believed that he’s said “there are man and gods, and beings like Pythagoras” ― basically calling himself a demi-god.\n\nOf course, we can easily agree that he sounds full of himself, but at the same time Pythagoras never fails to impress you.\n\nFirst and foremost, Pythagoras was a genius mathematician, Bertrand Russell describes his brilliancy to be as impressive as Albert Einstein’s. Here is how he describe him in his book — A History of Western Philosophy:\n\n“Mathematics, in the sense of demonstrative deductive argument, begins with him, and in him is intimately connected with a peculiar form of mysticism.”\n\nFor Pythagoras, mathematics and mysticism were the same things. He believed that “all things are just numbers,” and then he thought that numbers are thoughts of God.\n\nHis story, just like Thales, starts in Egypt where his philosophical curiosity grew, and he gained most of his wisdom there. For example, Pythagoras’ most significant contribution to mathematics is his theorem ― the Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2). Simply, showcasing that if we know the length of two sides of a triangle, we can then figure out the exact length of the missing side of the triangle — using the equation. Though, historians are well aware that ancient Egyptians (even the Sumerians) were also familiar with such methods of calculation.\n\nOur protagonist was addicted to arithmetic and geometry, his studies led him to reach discoveries that are accurate and precise. For example, he figured out that the Earth’s shape is not flat or cylinder-like ― it’s spherical. However, it’s not clear whether he learned this fact by himself, or the credit should go to the mathematicians from his school. Regardless, his sharp and smart deductive reasoning approach laid the foundations that made such discoveries possible.\n\nBut as we said, Pythagoras mixed spiritualism with mathematics, and to be fair, his views on existence are equally interesting. He could sense a deep connection between numbers and music. For example, he could see similarities between the harmony of a beautiful melody, and the beauty of discovering an accurate model for a numerical problem. He believed that a true mathematician is like a free artist, a creator that can build a world full of beauty and order.\n\nOne explanation for Pythagoras’ fiction and reality mashup could be because of the way ancient Greek societies viewed life during his time. Most practices had a mix of fiction in them, for example, Astronomy mixed with Astrology, Chemistry and Alchemy, Mathematics with Theology, and so on.\n\nMore interestingly, Pythagoras even thought of numbers differently. He thought numbers have shapes — he talked about rectangular numbers, other numbers that are triangular or pyramidical, and so on.\n\nThat’s why Plato’s World of Forms sounds more Pythagorean than Platonic. Plato, like many other philosophers, was heavily influenced by Pythagoras. For example, “God is a geometer” is a quote by Plato, but it feels like something Pythagoras would say.\n\nPythagoras talked about two worlds, a world that is atomic ― the main world that we perceive through our senses. Then, he believed there is another world, a world of numbers ― he thought that numbers are beyond time, numbers are eternal. Hence, he called numbers ‘thoughts of God’.\n\nAlso, not surprisingly, he believed that thoughts are superior to senses, essentially meaning — the world of numbers is more superior to the atomic world.\n\nPythagoras believed that you can start studying reality by first noticing what is self-evident, then use deductive reasoning to develop theories. When the declaration of independence declares “we hold these truths to be self-evident”, it comes from the same lineage dating back to Pythagoras’ school.\n\nIn first episode, I briefly explained that Pythagoras was a reformer of Bacchism, the society of Dionysus. Their version of the religion is called Orphism, and one of their central beliefs was that living beings have a soul. They believed that the soul is immortal, and it transmigrates after death.\n\nPythagoras believed that animals like humans have a soul, and people have seen him preach to animals.\n\nHis society was formed on the basis of communalism, where the members shared all their possessions and feasted together. His “school” brought the renaissance of science and spiritual awakening for many members, but as much as they thought they were visited by a divine being, Pythagoras’ journey came to an end anywhere around 500 to 490 BC.\n\nMost of his life still remains vague and obscure, but the ripple effects of his influences and imagination reaches us all the way to modern day. So maybe, he never died, and his soul instead transmigrated into a source of awe and inspiration for those who seek knowledge and God."
