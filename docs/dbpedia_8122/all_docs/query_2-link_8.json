        "text": "Chapter forty-two of the Dao De Jing has the following:\n\nThe Dao engenders One\n\nOne engenders Two\n\nTwo engenders Three\n\nAnd Three engenders the many myriad things\n\nThis looks rather like how Pythagoreanism is explained in Plato. The One, the Dyad and so on. Does this mean that both Pythagoros and Lao Tze Tung were referencing some primodorial ur-philosophy or that somehow it arose in one of these places and somehow over the distance on continents they managed to influence the other. Or is the most likely story is that they arose independently. Is it possible to make a plausible case for any of these options?\n\nThe above is glossed in the translation by Richard Ames and David Hall as\n\nThe Dao gives rise to continuity\n\nContinuity gives rise to difference\n\nDifference gives rise to plurality\n\nAnd plurality gives rise to the manifold of everything that is happening.\n\nThere's a theory, going back to the Renaissance, but most closely associated recently with author Aldous Huxley, that all valid philosophies relate back to a single common core, independent of traceable common origins. This is called the perennial philosophy. If it interests you, Huxley has a book of that same name that explicitly references both ancient Greek and ancient Chinese philosophy.\n\nIf you're looking for actual historical relationships, it's not generally believed that ancient Chinese and ancient Egyptian/Greek/Roman philosophy had any direct influence on each other. They are usually considered to have developed independently, despite the coincidence in time periods. (On the other hand, the line of influence in philosophy from Egypt to Greece to Rome is well-attested, although not uncontroversial, due to its political and racial overtones in modern discourse.)\n\nanswered Jan 16, 2018 at 21:30\n\nChris SunamiChris Sunami\n\n30.4k22 gold badges4949 silver badges103103 bronze badges"
