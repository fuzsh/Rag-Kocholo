        "text": "As noted above Epictetus was born a slave, and he was an \"ancient\" Greek, though after the classical period. Diogenes was born to an affluent family but lived on the streets as a homeless social scourge and was also, briefly, a slave. There were many later Cynics who followed his example, so one did not necessarily need wealth to ponder the cosmos, though many of these street \"Cynics\" were probably not much in the way of philosophers.\n\nThough both Plato and Aristotle did believe that freedom from labor was essential for philosophizing, Socrates himself seems to have been fairly poor and worked, I believe, as a stonecutter. As you note, it is a bit hard to tell. The Sophists who were Socrates' forebears and contemporaries were itinerate teachers for hire, and though some reputedly grew wealthy by teaching, many may have come from humble beginnings.\n\nMore to the point, slavery sustained the Greek societies that could afford the \"freedom\" to indulge the \"love of wisdom.\" So philosophy arose inside a democratic hothouse within a stark class system. What was expensive, apparently, was a proper teacher in rhetoric, Sophism, geometry, and such. So it is important to note that Socrates did not charge for his displays of dialectic. And the whole idea of rhetoric and philosophy as forms of influence did open up a social sphere of power that was not based in family, might, or wealth.\n\nWhat Karl Jaspers calls the Axial Age was a great shift in human culture partly characterized by the emergence of \"poor wandering teachers\" like Socrates, Jesus, or Buddha as world-historical figures in stark contrast to the older culture of warriors, wealth, and dynastic power. I believe Jacques Ranciere wrote a book on the class origins of philosophy from a Marxist perspective, but I can't find it on my dusty shelves at the moment.\n\nIn any case, the structure of the slave-powered Polis, the scarcity of books, the vicissitudes of war, and other factors make the comparison with our modern situation difficult. While philosophy in Plato's day was notoriously the hobby of young wealthy men, most seeking political wiles, it was not necessarily a practice for which wealth was a prerequisite.\n\nWell, there were many Greek Philosophers over the centuries beginning way back with Thales of Miletus-(circa 600 BC/BCE). Little is known about the biographies of various Ancient Greek Philosophers, with a few exceptions.\n\nPlato, came from a wealthy Athenian Shipping family and Aristotle's Father was the Top Physician to the King of Macedon. Socrates led a rather frugal life within the city of Athens and Diogenes, who often roamed the streets of Corinth, was also known to have led a rather frugal existence-(Diogenes famously insulted Alexander The Great by telling him, \"you're blocking my shadow\".....and Alexander simply laughed).\n\nI mentioned Thales of Miletus at the beginning of this post. Thales, was actually the Father of Western Philosophy-(about 200 years before Socrates). The first Philosophical school was founded by Thales in the Anatolian coastal town of Miletus-(present-day Turkey) 2600 years ago. Before his educational career, Thales had either sold or constructed Wine Presses; so he probably led the equivalent of a middle-upper middle class life in his earlier years.\n\nIt is certainly true that the majority of the Ancient Greek Philosophers had more \"free time on their hands\" than the average Greek civilian. While there was certainly tumult in the Ancient Greek world-(i.e. The Peloponnesian War, various battles against an encroaching Persian Empire, the rising commercial presence of Carthage, as well as the rise of the Roman Empire, coupled with not-so infrequent earthquakes), the Greek Philosophers did spend their time \"wisely\" and in doing so, were probably not in need of a great deal of money-(with a few notable exceptions)."
