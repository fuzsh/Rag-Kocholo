        "text": "Introduction\n\nPythagoras was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher and mathematician. He is a seminal figure in the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the realms of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\n\nHis philosophy, especially concerning the human soul, was profoundly influenced by earlier traditions and, in turn, significantly impacted later philosophical and religious thought, including Neoplatonism and various aspects of Western understanding of consciousness.\n\nPythagorean Philosophy and the Human Soul\n\nPythagoras’ views on the soul are deeply intertwined with his mathematical and metaphysical theories. He is often credited with advocating the immortality and transmigration of the soul, concepts that were revolutionary at the time.\n\nAccording to Pythagorean doctrine, the soul is essentially divine and immortal, bound to the cycle of reincarnation until it can purify itself from the sensual world and return to the realm of the divine.\n\nThis belief in the soul’s immortality and transmigration reflects a significant shift from the Homeric view of the afterlife, which depicted a shadowy existence in Hades.\n\nPythagoras introduced a more optimistic view, where the soul had the potential for eternal life and progression.\n\nInfluences on Pythagoras\n\nEastern and Egyptian Philosophies\n\nPythagoras is believed to have travelled extensively in his youth, including visits to Egypt and possibly the Near East. These cultures, with their mystical and mathematical traditions, likely influenced his thinking. The Egyptian focus on the afterlife and the soul's journey may have inspired his ideas on the soul’s immortality.\n\nOrphism\n\nThis Greek religious tradition, which predated Pythagoras, also emphasised the soul’s immortality and transmigration. The Orphic mysteries, with their rituals and beliefs about purification and the afterlife, likely significantly impacted Pythagorean doctrine.\n\nPythagoras’ Influence on Later Thought\n\nPlatonism and Neoplatonism\n\nPythagoras’ ideas significantly influenced Plato, whose theory of Forms and the immortality of the soul bear clear Pythagorean imprints. This Platonic thought, in turn, evolved into Neoplatonism, a philosophical system that further developed these ideas.\n\nPlotinus, a central figure in Neoplatonism, integrated the concept of the soul’s journey and the importance of intellectual and spiritual purification, echoing Pythagorean thought.\n\nMathematics and Harmony\n\nPythagoras’ belief in numbers as the ultimate reality and his theories of harmonic ratios influenced the way later philosophers and scientists viewed the cosmos and consciousness.\n\nThe idea that the universe is fundamentally mathematical and harmonious has resonated through centuries, influencing thinkers like Kepler, Newton, and even modern physicists.\n\nReligious and Esoteric Traditions\n\nElements of Pythagoreanism found their way into various religious and esoteric traditions. The emphasis on the soul’s immortality and the need for purification can be seen in aspects of Christianity, Gnosticism, and even in some interpretations of Eastern religions.\n\nThe Pythagorean emphasis on asceticism and the mystical significance of numbers has also been echoed in various esoteric and occult traditions.\n\nModern Consciousness Studies\n\nThe Pythagorean view of the soul as a divine, immortal entity undergoing a journey of purification and learning has parallels in some modern theories of consciousness.\n\nConcepts like the collective unconscious, proposed by Carl Jung, and various models of consciousness explored in transpersonal psychology can be seen as modern counterparts to Pythagorean ideas.\n\nAttributed Quotes\n\nPythagoras himself left no written records, and much of what is attributed to him comes from the accounts of later philosophers and historians. This makes it challenging to provide direct quotes with absolute certainty.\n\nHowever, several sayings and ideas are traditionally attributed to Pythagoras or his early followers, which reflect his philosophical views on the soul and related subjects.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nOn the Immortality of the Soul\n\n“Friends are as companions on a journey, who ought to aid each other to persevere in the road to a happier life.”\n\nOn the Transmigration of Souls\n\n“As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings, he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.”\n\nOn the Nature of Existence\n\n“Number is the ruler of forms and ideas, and the cause of gods and daemons.”\n\nOn Learning and Wisdom\n\n“Silence is better than unmeaning words.”\n\nOn the Purpose of Life\n\n“The most beautiful and most profound experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the sower of all true science.”\n\nOn Ethical Living\n\n“Do not say a little in many words, but a great deal in a few.”\n\nSummary\n\nPythagoras’ philosophy, particularly regarding the human soul, was a synthesis of earlier traditions and his innovative ideas. His influence on later philosophical and religious thought, especially Neoplatonism, has been profound. The Pythagorean legacy in understanding consciousness continues to resonate, offering a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern inquiry into the nature of the mind and the cosmos."
