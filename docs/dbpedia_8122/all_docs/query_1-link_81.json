        "text": "First of all, i hope that you noticed already that the Pythagorean Theorem was already known to Mesopotamians and Egyptians. Secondly, \"Greek-Language\" Philosophy arose in Asia Minor not in the Greek Mainland, to be more precise in Miletus, which was then part of the Persian (Achaemenid-) Empire. It is VERY unlikely that all the variety of ideas in Pre-Socratic and platonic philosophy can be solely traced back to Greek-Mythology/Homer's and Hesiod’s Epics + \"Greek rationalism\"* GENIUS of Greek-Mind. Eminent scholars like Walter Burkert, M.L. West, Phillip Horky, Peter Kingsley etc. have shown how Heraclitus, Empedocles, Plato, Democritus etc. borrowed directly or indirectly Non-Greek, specially Egyptian and Zoroastrian (Persian) Ideas. The link between Heraclitus and Zarathushtra is even mentioned in Nietzsches \"Philosophie im tragischen Zeitalter der Griechen\".\n\nAs Herodotus (who was a Hellenized Carian from Harlicanassus) mentioned (Book 1. 146.), Miletus was inhabited by Carians before the Greek-Colonialization. When Greek's arrived (heavily outnumbered by the autochtunus People) they would start mixing with the inhabited Population and the large Population started to adopt Greek language/culture and became hellenized. The Ionian Greek language (attic-dialect) would become lingua franca in the West Coast of Asia Minor, prior to the Conquest of Alexander. As i have stated before the Milesians would be largely Hellenized Carians . Herodot makes also clear, that Thales was of remote Phoenician descent See: Herodot, Book I,170. Names like f.e. Anaximandros are Carian-Style names and make clear that Milesians Thinkers had some Carian origins. see: Luwian Identities- Culture and History of the Near East. S\n\no the (Attic-Greek) language would be lingua franca on the West-Coast of Asia Minor and later also in other places like Pamphylia (Luwian in origin) etc.\n\nMany so called Pre-Socratic Thinkers weren't even Greek Ethnics necessarily, f.e. Thales was of Phoenician origin just like Pherecydes of Syros, Anacharsis was a Scythian, the Milesians were technically speaking Hellenized Carians etc. Other prominent \"Greeks\" were of mixed origins too: Thukydides had some Thracian ancestry and Demosthenes was Scythian on his maternal side, Alcman was very likely Lydian origin just like Xanthus of Lydia etc.\n\nSo many thinkers who worte in Greek in Antiquity were not necessarily Greek-Ethnics nor does the presented ideas of \"Greek-origin\". The same way Europeans wrote their works in Latin (f.e. Descartes, Spinoza) without being Roman or Persians wrote in Arabic without becoming Arab (f.e. Avicenna).\n\nSince you have mentioned Iamblichus, he is not the only great thinker who wasn't of Greek descend. Same applies to Plotinus (native Latin-speaker), Porphyry, Origen, Zeno (the founder of the Stoic-school of thought, who was a Phoenician), Arcesilaus (founder of Academic Skepticism) had some Thracian ancestry-his father’s name was Thracian origin Seuthes, etc.\n\nEven the Great Alexandrian Mathematicians are falsely portrayed as being Greek without any sound argument or evidence, see Katz:\n\n\"But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the 1st to the 5th centuries AD were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. Most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted ... So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities ... And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \"Hellenized\", to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.\"\n\n— Victor J. Katz (1998). A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, p. 184. Addison Wesley,\n\nSo better not to complain, but to enjoy the fact, that “Greek-Civilization” gets the support Euro-centrist scholarship, trying to attribute nearly all achievements to the Greeks. ;)"
