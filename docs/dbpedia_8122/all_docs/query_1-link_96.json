        "text": "As a young Masonic traveler, one is met with a philosopher known by the name Pythagoras. When mentioned in the Third Degree accompanied by Hieroglyphical Emblems, we are not told much more other than that he traveled to many destinations in the known world at that time and he was initiated into several Orders of priesthood. One of the emblems that is made very aware to our traveler is the Pythagorean Theorem or also known as the 47th problem of Euclid. After the young traveler is shown the emblem, he is then told of the act in which Pythagoras first realized the relationship that the Theorem defined and he said with excitement the word Eureka! At that time it is said that he sacrificed a Hecatomb-which is 100 oxen sacrificed at the same time.(1)\n\nThis part of the story of this great Philosopher is well known to those in the Craft, but what many do not know is that Pythagoras had several famous philosophers that were his pupils in the schools he founded. Those who entered his school were given their lessons orally and were sworn to secrecy, hence there is very little documentation other than information that is scattered from many sources. Now lets look into the life of this great man of knowledge and how our Fraternity became so aware of his teachings and used it to shape our Craft both in the Operative and Spiritual form.\n\nA life of expanding knowledge\n\nNo clear evidence confirms when Pythagoras was born other than it was between 570 and 586 BC. He was born on a small Greek island and his Father was of Noble birth.\n\nThis advantage in his childhood offered Pythagoras a chance to explore educational opportunities not afforded by children at that time. In his early twenties it was suggested that he travel to Egypt to expand his educational base. In Egypt he studied Astronomy and Astrology then he traveled to India where he studied the Esoteric Sciences among the Brahmans of India.(2) We aware of his influence in India to this day as Pythagoras is known to them as “Yavanacharya”, the Ionian teacher.(3)\n\nAfter a brief stop back in Greece, Pythagoras set out to Tyre in Lebanon where he was initiated for the first time into the “Ancient Mysteries” of the Phoenicians. After three years of study, he again traveled to Egypt where he was again initiated and studied for just over twenty years. After a brief capture traveling back to Greece from Egypt, Pythagoras settled in southern Italy (Crotona) and there started up the Pythagorean School of Philosophy, Mathematics, and Natural Sciences.(4)\n\nPythagoreans – a brotherhood of secrecy\n\nThe Pythagorean School took people from different classes of society to learn and hear the lectures given by Pythagoras. It is documented that even women were taken into their rolls which at that time was forbidden.(5) Once his school gained momentum, he gathered his top pupils and formed a brotherhood. This brotherhood lived under the teachings of a simple life of modesty and self-control. They consumed a vegetarian diet of condensed food and unleavened bread. This part of Pythagoras’s life goes in contrast to the story told to our young Masonic traveler. Research has shown that the “Hecatomb slaughter” was substituted by a symbolic offering.(6) It is also known that the pupils of this brotherhood did not cut their hair, nails, or beards. Some famous pupils of this brotherhood were Socrates, Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They called themselves Pythagoreans and lived in complete partnership in the hope of new scientific discovery.\n\nEntrance into the School of Pythagoras was not for every candidate. The qualifications were high and strict rules were applied and enforced. Pupils were expected to pass through three degrees in a process that took five years to complete. The three degrees of this inner school were :\n\nHEARERS : who studied for three years in silence.\n\nMATHEMATICI : learning Geometry and Music, the nature of Numbers, Form and Sound.\n\nPHYSICI : who learned to master Cosmogony and Metaphysics, then they were prepared for the Mysteries.(7)\n\nAn Appreciation from the Sciences\n\nPythagoras died around 500B.C., and his death like much of his studies is cloaked in mystery. It is believed that he escaped capture from aristocratic leaders of that time but was later murdered. Many of his schools were destroyed due to ignorance of the nature of the studies therein and several of his pupils later wrote out the teachings he held so close to the vest throughout his life. Though in death, the teachings of Pythagoras lived in some form as schools were later erected again in Egypt and throughout Asia.\n\nThe Jewish Theosophy (Cabala) gained momentum in the 12th and 13th centuries which brought an acute awareness again to the sciences and mathematics.(8) Though never a confirmed member of the Rosicrucian Order, Pythagoras is mentioned in appreciation for his contribution of numbers and vibrations. He was the first to teach the Heliocentric system and his brotherhood of Pythangoreans invented the Multiplication Table.(9)\n\nSo it is much clearer now why Pythagoras was held in such high regard in our Masonic lessons. His teachings gave us the ability to create a physical as spiritual temple in which we can enlighten not only our lives but those who travel through our portals in this gentle Craft we call Freemasonry.\n\nTimothy A.
