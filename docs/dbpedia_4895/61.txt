Conn McCluskey (above right) is to be the new CEO of Ireland Active, the group representing leisure facilities and fitness professionals.

McCluskey left the Federation of Irish Sport at the start of this year, where he had previously served as number two to Sarah O’Connor for nearly four years.

He had an initial career in architecture before going back to UCD for a Masters in Sports Management and will be an important addition to Ireland Active as they step up their engagement and involvement in the National Physical Activity Plan.

Ireland Active was established in 2013 and is led by President, Barry Walsh who is involved in a number of private fitness clubs including Medfit in Blackrock.

It has been managed on a part time basis by Christine Moloney of Leisureworld and the Healthy Ireland Council, but with the new Government focus on the importance of physical activity as a preventative action in the health space it is likely that the role of the body will step up.

Moloney will remain on the Board.

The Association has 300 members drawn from private and public sector and runs an annual convention for members as well as keeping them up to date on matters related to the industry.

McCluskey was a key player in the organisation of last year’s Sport Industry Awards, where Barry Walsh served as a judge alongside Rob Hartnett of Sport for Business, Matt Cooper of Today FM and other industry leaders.

Sport for Business will have an interview with McCluskey in the coming weeks where he will lay out his vision for the future of leisure and health in Ireland.
