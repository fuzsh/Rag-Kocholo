        "text": "First listed for sale in 2016, a six-bedroom custom home on Palm Beach’s lakefront has sold for $14.91 million, according to the deed recorded by the Palm Beach County Clerk’s office.\n\nMalcolm and Angela McCluskey sold the traditional-style home they built on the North End at 1191 N. Lake Way to neighbors who own a house nearby, wealth manager John W. Copeland and his wife, Gianna F. Biondi.\n\nThe house that just changed hands stands on a half-acre lot with 115 feet of frontage on the Intracoastal Waterway and a deep-water dock. Completed in 2011, the house has 10,055 square feet of living space, inside and out. The house is at the intersection of North Lake Way and Nightingale Trail.\n\nIn April 2018, Copeland and Biondi downsized to a house at 231 Nightingale Trail, six lots east of the one they just bought via a deed recorded Thursday. They bought the Nightingale Trail house the same month they sold a larger one nearby on Tangier Avenue. The couple does not have the house on Nightingale Trail listed for sale, according to the Palm Beach Board of Realtor Multiple Listing Service.\n\nThe McCluskeys are downsizing, businessman and real estate investor Malcolm McCluskey told the Daily News for an article published early in 2017.\n\n\"Previously, we lived in a little smaller home on Mockingbird Trail, and our kids couldn't all stay with us. They were spread out all over the island, and our new house (had) plenty of areas for kids and a big yard,\" he said. \"We are no longer boating, and we thought our kids would use our home more. It's a big house for just my wife and me. Now it's time to downsize a little.\"\n\nThe North End property is in a prime location for boaters, because there are no bridges between it and the inlet at the north tip of the island. The house is about a mile from the inlet.\n\n\"We can be out in the ocean in 10 minutes,\" Malcolm McCluskey said in the article.\n\n>>RELATED: McCloskeys’ custom home accommodates boating lifestyle\n\nAgent Bill Yahn of the Corcoran Group had listed the house for sale in the local multiple listing service in November 2016, records show. The property was initially marketed at $23.9 million, a price later dropped to $21.5 million. In January, Yahn reduced the price again to $19.9 million.\n\n“It was a stunning house, and it turned out we had multiple buyers for it,” Yahn said. “It just shows the market is improving.”\n\nAgent Gary Pohrer of Douglas Elliman Real Estate confirmed that he handled the buyer’s side of the negotiations in the off-market deal, which closed June 5. Pohrer declined further comment.\n\nJohn Copeland is managing partner of Wealth Partners Capital Group, which has offices in Palm Beach, San Francisco and New York City. The company works with three major investment-advisory firms — EP Wealth Advisors, Forbes Family Trust and MAI Capital Management — to provide strategic planning services and resources to investment advisers and their clients, according to its website.\n\nWith longtime ties to Connecticut, the McCluskeys co-founded and own Bethel-based List Services Corp., which provides businesses with direct-marketing and data services. The company has satellite offices in Florida, Boston, Illinois and both North and South Carolina, according to its website.\n\nMalcolm McCluskey, known as “Mal,” also has brokered commercial deals and developed and sold residential real estate, including a Palm Beach house he and his wife developed on speculation at 1233 N. Ocean Blvd.\n\nMcCluskey bought the North Lake Way property in his name for a recorded $4.77 million in late 2009 and razed a house built in 1935 to make way for the custom home that just sold. The property’s ownership was later transferred into both of the McCluskeys’ names.\n\nArchitect Pat Segraves of SKA Architect+Planner designed the house that just sold. It was built by general contractor Rene Alonso of Alonso & Associates.\n\nThe façade has a two-story pediment-topped entrance feature with the front door. Exterior architectural details include quoins at the house’s corners, metal railings and dentil molding.\n\nInside, the living room has a mahogany floor, a stone-clad fireplace and a tray ceiling. The room opens to a loggia facing the lake. Other interior features include a formal dining room, a library and a ground-level master suite, in addition to another master bedroom on the second floor. A work island separates the well-equipped kitchen from the family room, which has doors that access a side loggia. Yahn’s sales listing mentioned a one-bedroom apartment above the garage to accommodate guests, staff or a “yacht captain.”\n\nThe 2009 sale in which Malcolm McCluskey bought the property was handled by the the old Fite Shavell & Associates, which today is William Raveis South Florida. The co-listing agents at the time were Pohrer and agent Chris Deitz, while agent Thor Brown, who now is affiliated with the Corcoran Group, represented the seller, a trust.\n\nThe McCluskeys sold the four-bedroom spec house they developed at 1233 N. Ocean Way in May 2017 for a recorded $5.475 million. Agent Elizabeth DeWoody of the Corcoran Group acted for the McCluskeys and the buyer, an Oregon-based corporation.\n\n>>REALATED Copeland, Biondi pay $6.63 million for North End house after selling larger one for $14 :million\n\nIn the two 2018 North End transactions involving Copeland and Biondi, the couple first sold a Georgian-style house with 11,225 total square feet at 254 Tangier Ave. for $14 million. Broker Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate handled both sides of the sale, in which the buyer was a Delaware-registered entity named Tangier PB LLC.\n\nA few of weeks later, Copeland and Biondi paid a recorded $6.63 million for their smaller house — with 6,768 total square feet — about 1½ miles south at 231 Nightingale Trail. Angle again represented them in that deal opposite agent Paula Wittmann of The Fite Group, which today is William Raveis South Florida.\n\n>>RELATED: New house in Palm Beach sells for $5.48 million after three months\n\n>>RELATED: Read more Palm Beach real estate news\n\ndhofheinz@pbdailynews.com\n\n@PBDN_hofheinz"
