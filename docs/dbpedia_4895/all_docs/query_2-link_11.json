        "text": "The birthplace of our branch of McCluskey ancestors lies in the townland of Emy near the village of Emyvale, in the North Monaghan parish of Donagh, barony of Truagh. It is here on the north-western side of Emy lough that several generations of the McCluskey family were reared. Their farmstead\n\nstretched down to the shoreline of Lough Emy and from the Mc Cluskey homestead one can see across the lake the adjoining townlands of Killycooley, Tiramoan, Pullis, Portinaghy and Derrygasson. From the hilltop of Emy the neighbouring drumlin townlands of Knockafubble, Drumbanagher can also be seen to the east and Emyvale village and beyond to Slieve Beagh mountain to the west. To the southern end lies the townland of Tully which boasts a large ring fort. It was from here that the entire barony of Truagh was administered under the old Irish system by the McKenna Chieftain before the collapse of that administration after the battle of Kinsale in the year 1601. The last McKenna Chief to reside in Tully was Neal and after suffering defeat at the hands of the English in 1642 he removed to the townland of Portinaghy where he set up his headquarters within sight of the McCluskey homestead just across the lake. The origin of the McCluskey name appears to be derived from the Christian name Bloscaidh who was a member of the O’Kane family of Derry who were famous warriors in the army of the O’Neills of Ulster. The O’Kanes also originated from a Christian name Cathan who was a son of the O’Neills. What is of most interesting to us here at this point is that O’Neill hadj one of his most successful outcomes against the English forces at the Battle of Clontibret in 1598, a battle in which the McCluskeys took an active part. Clontibret is no more than 10 miles away from Emy and it is from this period forward that we see their settlement in Monaghan.\n\nThe origins of the McCluskey/McCloskey name have already been well and truly researched by Charles McCluskey, in the 1950s. Charles published a private copy of the McCluskey pedigree for the perusal of his McCluskey relatives especially his American cousins who resided in the Dayton, Ohio area and who cherished a fondness of their native soil which culminated in an Irish visit by them in 1957. This visit was also reciprocated by a visit of the Irish McCluskey cousins (namely Seamus McCluskey and Lila McQuaid). Seamus and Lila visited the family of Henry and Edna Stang who were residing at the USAF base in Erding in southern Germany. Before proceeding further it would be best to outline the family tree from the time of James McCluskey and his wife Mary (McGee). For information about the previous generations of “Emy” McCluskeys Charles McCluskey (son of Patrick and grandson of James and Mary as illustrated) has already painstakenly analysed and recorded this data in his publication. However Charles is largely dependent for what we know about previous generations upon the Rent Rolls of their landowner the Leslies of Glaslough.\n\nJames McCluskey of Emy and his descendants\n\nAs can be seen from the hourglass tree chart above James McCluskey and his wife Mary nee (McGee) had a family of seven children consisting of six boys and one girl. This is the first time a generation of McCluskeys appears in both civil and church records and from that period forward into modern times we are able to get a clearer picture of our ancestral relationship. During the period of the Tithe Applotments records of the 1820s everyone Catholic or Protestant was obliged to pay tithes to the Established Church (Church of Ireland). This was based on the acreage or size of rental which tenant farmers held. In Emy we get a picture of James’s neighbours from this record which is reproduced hereunder.\n\nAs can be seen James is recorded as having 1 acre 2 roods and 18 perches of land. Alongside is Edward McCluskey holding 2 acres 2 roods and 29 perches. It is probable to deduce from this that Edward was a brother or uncle of James since his father’s name was Thomas according to Charles McCluskeys “Pedigree of the McCloskey (Lough Emy) family” account. Among the other recorded land holders here are the names of Owen, John and Charles McGee one of whom may have been the parent or brother of James’s wife Mary. It is also possible to speculate that the McGee portion of Emy land later became merged with McCluskeys after the marriage of James and Mary.\n\nOf the seven children of James and Mary three of the sons emigrated to the United States namely, Charles John and James. The other children remained at home in Monaghan. It would appear that it was the three eldest children who emigrated as Thomas who inherited the home place was younger than at least 2 of his US brothers and the other two brothers Patrick and William were both younger than Thomas.\n\nFirstly we will concentrate on Thomas’s family and the ancestral home of the McCluskeys.\n\nEmy townland consists of 251 acres of land (of which 35 acres comprise a large part of the lough). The map illustrated is a copy of the Valuations Office map based on the details from Griffiths Valuation\n\n1850s record, which has the Ordinance Survey map reference Nos:- 2a, 2b and 3 from O.S. sheets 3 & 6 indicated thereon. You will note that 2b is leased by a Mr John Marshall from James McCluskey. This suggests that James was subletting the house on that part of the farm to Mr Marshall. This house 2b and parcel of land 2a fell to James’s son William.\n\nThe remainder of James’s land which included the home place at map reference 3 came into the possession of Thomas. There is no indication at the time of James’s possession of these holdings that he also possessed the farm which his other son Patrick later acquired in the town land of Derrygasson nearby.\n\nAccording to the 1901 Census return for Thomas’s house the description of the building is of a thatched house with three windows to the front following in the style of the period. The ground floor lay-out probably followed along the lines of the McQuaid homestead as illustrated above. The farm and house next to Thomas’s holding was in the possession of a 75 year old widow Mary Kavanagh and her 2 daughters 35 year old Mary (junior) and 28 year old Bridget. What is worth noting at this point is that unlike the single storey thatched cottage which the McCluskey families were reared in the Kavanagh homestead was quite a\n\nsubstantial 2 storey building with a slated roof. By 1911 Mary (junior) was the sole occupant of the house and she was now 45 years old. It was a natural progression that when Thomas’s son John came of an age when he needed to provide for a family of his own that he should acquire the neighbouring farm and house. Thomas died at the age of 77 years on the 22nd of January 1919. Thomas’s wife Bridget died on the 4th May 1910 aged 69 years old.\n\nThe eldest of Thomas and Bridget(nee Treanor) McCluskeys family was Catherine born 29th Feb 1868.\n\nCatherine was born on the 29th February 1868. She married Peter Oweney McKenna from Killycorn, Emyvale on the 5th of February 1891. They had a daughter Sarah Ellen born on the 8th of June 1892 and a son James born on the 22nd of February 1894. Catherine died a widow at the age of 79 years old from senile decay. Her daughter Sarah Casserly was present at time of death which occured at her home in Killycorn on the 9th of May 1947.\n\nNext James was born 26th January 1870. James was only 27 years old when he died in July 1897. His death which occurred on the 16th July was reported in the Northern Standard newspaper of 24th July. On the fatal day in question James had been mowing hay for his neighbour O’Brien when he collapsed and fell onto the mower while operating it. The doctor/coroner visiting the scene of the fatality reported that he found James where he had died in the field and concluded that James had died from a heart attack. No inquest was held into the death of James.\n\nPatrick was next born on the 3th February 1871. Early on Patrick moved\n\nto Belfast where he found work. About 1907 Patrick married Margaret McGouran from Ballygowan, Co Down. Their first child Thomas was born about the year 1908. In the 1911 census the following information is given about the family. Firstly Patrick aged 35, born Monaghan is recorded as head of household, then Margaret his wife aged 33 born Co. Down, a son Thomas aged 3, another son W. Patrick 3 months old and a boarder by the name of Nora McGlaughlin aged 72 old age pensioner from Co Louth. The oral information hints at the probability that Margaret died giving birth to her second child W Patrick as per census, but it would appear that she and and her infant child died very soon after this period. In the meantime, Thomas who was only 3 years old was dispatched to Co Monaghan by his dad to be reared by his aunties, until he was\n\nold enough as a teenager to go back to Belfast and join his dad. He spent most of this time being reared along with his first cousins by his uncle John and his wife Jane at Emy. Being the eldest member of this household in Emy, Thomas was entrusted with the only portrait of his grandparents which he kept with his personal private possessions throughout his lifetime. I am indeed indebted to the family of grandson Thomas for allowing me to reproduce hereunder a copy of that rare picture of Thomas and Bridget McCluskey\n\n. On the 30th of April 1913 Patrick remarried Mary Trainor who at the time was residing at 94 Spamount Street, Belfast along with her sister Anne. The celebrant who officiated at this marriage was Revd. J McLaverty in St. Patrick’s Church, Belfast. They had a son Joseph from this marriage. He was born on the 4th and baptised on the 7th of June 1914. His sponsors were John And Maggie McPhillips. Joseph was a bright young man early in his career and made a lot of money as an accountant working for the Americans in Nr. Ireland during the second World War. Seemingly, Patrick who had been in the liquor business fell on hard times. He and his wife retired first to the town land of Cloony and later to Mullatinny in Clogher, Co Tyrone close to her birthplace. As they grew old Joseph gave up his employment in Belfast to go live with, and take care of them. Joseph is remembered with great affection around Clogher. He could turn his hand to any skill. He is remembered calling to McKennas shop in Clogher with the old acid-style battery to have it re-charged possibly to be able to listen to the radio at home as was popular then. He was also a keen amateur dramatist taking part in productions in Clogher while he resided there. Recently, a group picture which featured Joe in costume as a policeman appeared in the “Down Memory Lane” section of the Ulster Herald. Joe’s father Patrick died on the 29th of December 1947 and is interred in the graveyard along the stone wall to the rear middle from the Forth chapel (St. Macartan’s) running parallel to the road. Mary died on the 14th of January 1959 and in interred with her husband. After the parents died Joseph moved to London where he worked, lived and died. He had a good job with French Airlines and lived in an apartment in Picadilly, adjacent to Fortnum & Masons dept. store. He never married. Thomas his older and only step-brother from his dads first marriage to Margaret married a woman by the name of Ewins in Belfast. They had 5 children ranging from the eldest Ann, Eugene, (twins) Francis and Gerard and Patricia. Thomas on at least two occasions forwarded an advance of cash to his step brother to have a headstone erected on their parents grave but alas Joe who had good intentions passed away early in life and the job never got completed.\n\nMary was next born on the 16th December 1872. She was married to Michael Gormley from Augher, Co Tyrone and they owned a pub in Belfast called “The Stags Head” (or perhaps “The Rams Head”!). Michael was born on the 29th October 1880 the youngest child of James and Margaret Gormley (nee Early) in the townland of Aughadarra. Michael’s father James was a stonemason as is indicated on Michael and Mary’s (Minnie) marriage cerrtificate. Mary and Michael were wed on the 19th of July 1908 in the Church of St Pauls Belfast. Michael’s address is given as 17 Mount Street and Minnie’s is Royal Victoria Hospital. Siblings of Michael were another Michael who was born on the 23rd January 1874 but died a week after birth. Cause of death was given as constipation “uncertified”. Additionally there was Patrick born the 16th December 1870, Mary on 5th May 1872, James on the 31st January 1876, and Ellen born on the 7th June 1878. Michael died on the 30th of January 1930. Mary (Minnie) died just 10 years later on the 7th of August 1940. Mary and Michael had no family of their own but they adopted a girl whose Christian name was Nora. It would appear that her adoptive parents had made no will.\n\nAfter their demise Nora was written out of any inheritance because her adoption had taken place prior to the setting up of the Adoption Board, and her entitlement was considered void. My dad Pat McQuaid was given a present on one occasion by his Aunt Mary (Minnie) which is in our family possession and which I still treasure, a pocket watch. This watch although made of cheap quality materials was a commemorative token which their brewer William Younger had given to the Gormleys, and other similar publicans in the year 1935 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee. On the face of the watch was the inscription “Time flies but you can get younger every day!”, meaning Youngers ale. The Brewery used to have an ale called “Time”.\n\nNext born was John on the 26th January 1875 and it was John who was to inherit the Emy farm and home place. John married Jane Tully from Drumshanny (Tirnaneil), parish of Tydavnet but near Monaghan town just off the Emyvale /Monaghan road. Their date of marriage was 25th of June 1924. Jane’s only sister Mary was her bridesmaid. Having\n\nacquired the adjoining farm belonging to the Kavanaghs he removed to the Kavanagh homestead where he and his wife Jane reared their 6 children as follows:- Mary, Thomas, Kathleen, Rita, Annie and John Joe. I have warm memories of sampling Jane’s freshly baked bread on a visit to her home in my childhood. John died on the 10th July 1945 and his wife Jane died on the 24th September 1973.\n\nOn the 25th February 1877 my grandmother Annie McCluskey was the next born. Before marrying her future husband Hugh McQuaid of Knockafubble she worked as a domestic servant in the household of Andrew Whitsitt of Glaslough. Andrew was the Clerk of the Petty Sessions at the premises which is now occupied by the oratory in Emyvale village. The Whitsitts resided in what is now next door to McKennas pub and B & B, also known as the Pillar House, Glaslough. In both the 1901 and 1911 census records Annie is recorded as domestic servant in the household of the Whitsitts and is visibly absent from the Emy record. Andrew passed away on the 23rd of March 1905 and according to his death certificate Annie was present at his death. Cause of death was given as double pneumonia/influenza. Mary Jane’s death occured on the 23rd February 1916 and this occasion was also witnessed by Annie. At the time of Mary Jane death Annie was still single and would have been about 39 years old. By the time of the 1911 census only Mary Jane of the\n\nWhitsitts was still living at the time. Before she passed away Mary Jane took hold of Annie’s hand and whispered to her that she would clasp her hand again in a better land. Mary Jane was 62 years old at the time of the 1911 census. Annie married Hugh McQuaid, Knockafubble about 1917/18 and they had 2 children Lila and Pat, my father. Hugh in 1901 lived in Knockafubble with just his father Patrick McQuaid as his mother Mary (nee Donnelly) McQuaid was by this time already deceased. By the year 1911 Hugh’s dad Patrick had also passed away and his uncle Francis Donnelly was then living with him. Before setting up his bicycle repair shop Hugh had served his apprenticeship at Wallaces in Emyvale where he learned his trade.\n\nBridget was the next born on 20th December 1878. It would appear that Bridget did not live long as we shall see further down. At just 2 weeks old she suffered from convulsions for 24 hours resulting in her early death on the 2nd of January 1879. Her father Thomas was present at time of death.\n\nFrank was the next born on the 26th November 1879. Because Frank was the second youngest of Thomas’s children he is remembered with great affection as a kindly man by most of that generation to follow him at his home place in Emy. He enjoyed a drink or two, and from all accounts he was great company. He spent a short while in the United States but made little money and returned home. He also worked for awhile in Belfast. It is still remembered that Frank worked in the pub business in Belfast most likely with his brother Patrick, as Patrick’s son Tommy once brought his own young son Eugene on a visit to view the site of the former business premises. From Eugene’s recollection of the pub the name which was still faintly visible over the establishment read: Francis and Patrick McCluskey which also had included a notice thereon which read “No credit given“. This was likely to have been at 94 Spamount Street, where Patrick was married to Mary Trainor from Clogher. Eugene’s sister Ann recalls granduncle Frank visiting her home at the time of her confirmation. Ann recalls how Frank gave her some money and also how he admired her white confirmation dress and veil. Such was the esteem in which Frank was held by everyone who knew him and especially by his brother John’s family. John’s son Tommy accompanied the remains all the way to the church at Corracrin in Co Monaghan in the hearse and also dug his grave, Frank’s final resting place. Although money had to be found to take care of final burial arrangements his niece Mary was first to dig into her savings to cover these expenses.\n\nFinally twins Bridget and Ellen were born 26th November 1883. Just like her sibling (of the same name above) Bridget did not survive long after birth. Her sister Ellen however survived and was recorded on her parents Census\n\nrecord in 1901 as 16 year old daughter and her profession is given as “seamstress”. Ellen married Jack Smith from Tonygarvey, Glaslough and they settled in the townland of Knocknasave. They had no children. Jack pre-deceased his wife by about six years on the 19th of August 1946. Lila McQuaid his niece was present at time of his death which was due to cardiac failure. Ellen continued to live on her own at Knocknasave. She died 18th of November 1952 of severe burns as a result of her clothing catching flame.\n\nThe principle land tenant in Emy at this time was William Ryan (the owner of Emy Mills) who milled flour. The mill was dependent on a constant supply of water to turn the mill-wheel which was regulated by the sluice gate to the north side of the lake. William McCluskey’s family took care of the opening and closing of this gate as required. The mill which later was in possession of the Corrigan family, had been until recent times used in the manufacture of wooden hand rakes. The mill has since been demolished for safety reasons, “Emy’s equivalent to the tall buildings of Manhattan!! at seven storeys high”.\n\nEmy Mills\n\nWilliam one of the 3 sons of James and Mary McCluskey who remained on in Ireland is dealt with next.\n\nWilliam who acquired the house and farm from his father James is represented on 8Griffiths Valuations Ordinance map at Ord. Survey map ref:- 2a and 2b. William married Catherine Maguire on the 25th of November 1886. Catherine was a daughter of a farmer Frank Maguire from Cornagilla, Rosslea, Co Fermanagh.\n\nThey had the following children:-\n\nJames was born on 25th of January 1888 but being debilitated from birth survived only 24 hours and died on the 26th inst. in the presence of his father William.\n\nMary was born 10th January 1889. Mary married Paddy Sherry and they lived in Belfast. They had 6 children of their own and one adopted girl. They were called: Willie, Johnny, Pat, Tommy, Kathleen, Winnie and one adopted child.\n\nPatrick was born 7th January 1893. Patrick was a batchelor and along with his younger sister Bridget lived in the home place at Emy, throughout their lifetime. Towards the end of the Great War in 1918 Volunteer organizations began to pop up all over the country. In North Monaghan in the spring of 1918 a Company was formed at Ballyotin. The recruits came mainly from the local Sinn Fein Club which had been formed in 1917. The first officer of this Company was Joseph McKenna, and there were about 16 men in his command. For about the next 2 years the activities of the Company consisted of drilling, training, lectures on scouting, signalling and engineering. Keeping an eye on the movements of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and parading in their presence in military formation while carrying hurley sticks was all part of the drill. Intense interest in all kinds of support for Gaelic League classes, Irish dancing and boycott of foreign dances. GAA clubs were formed and many of the new members were former soccer players. The North Monaghan Battalion, “C” Battalion was part of the 1st Brigade of which Eoin O’Duffy was O.C. The Battalion O.C. was James McKenna. Throughout the entire district Companies sprung up and each Company had it’s captain. Patrick McCluskey was captain of the Donagh Company. Sometime in the year 1920 while on a raiding expedition for arms on a Unionist home Patrick received a serious bullet wound in the thigh, which left him with a pronounced limp for the rest of his life. Because of the covert operations of the organisation at the time Patrick had to go on the run and moved between safe houses. Patrick was a warm-hearted man as I knew him when visiting his home in Emy. The first fishing rod I ever possessed was a used one which he gave me a gift when I was very young boy. Patrick died on the 25th May 1972 aged 79 years of age.\n\nAnnie was born about the year 1895! Annie married Walter Pierson and they settled in Vancouver. They had no children\n\nCharles was born 16th February 1897. Charlie married a woman from Co Clare and they lived in New York. They had 2 children Kay and Dorothy.\n\nCatherine was born 18th August 1899. Catherine married married John Joe Savage from the neighbouring town land of Tully. They lived in a house in the adjoining town land of Derryhallagh where they began to raise their family. They had 6 children as follows: Gretta, Maureen, Anne, twins Pat and Willie, and John Joe. The children lost both parents when they were very young. Catherine was confined to hospital shortly after the birth of her youngest child John Joe, possibly suffering from post natal depression and died shortly thereafter. Her husband died around the same time as a result of being thrown from his cart when the horse which was pulling it bolted. This tragedy occurred on the bridge in Monaghan town near the railway station as the train steam engine was passing underneath. Great trauma ensued in the aftermath of these sudden deaths and a crisis arose as to how best take care of the children. The eldest were still too young to take care of their younger siblings and besides there was the added problem of the twins one of whom (Willie) had been born with a physical disability which confined him to Cappagh hospital for a considerable period of time. It would appear that the parish priest Fr. Ward and especially the curate Fr. Victor Marron in consultation with the closest family connections came to an arrangement. The 3 eldest girls were taken into the care of the St. Louis nuns in Monaghan town. Here they were provided with accommodation and education until they reached adulthood. Later in life they would remember with kindness the care which they received during those early years. Catherine’s sister Bridget who resided in the home place took the twins Pat and Willie into her care and the youngest child John Joe was cared for by his paternal uncle Tommy Savage who resided near Tully lake.\n\nThomas’s date of birth not verified. Thomas got married in England. He and his wife moved to New York. They had no family.\n\nBridget was youngest and was born 2nd February 1903.\n\nAs mentioned above Bridget although single took on the role of mother for her deceased sister’s twins Pat and Willie. Their uncle Patrick also was there for them and they had a happy childhood growing up in Emy. Bridget had many visitors to her home which was always very accessible being as it was along the roadside. If she felt agitated with visitors overstaying their welcome this was manifested in her mannerism of whistling to herself. She was a promoter of the religious Sacred Heart Messenger magazine and up to a ripe old age she cycled around the community distributing and collecting on that organisation’s behalf.\n\nIt is possible to get an early image of Bridget from the school picture above although the quality is poor. Most likely, some of her other older family siblings are also pictured with her as many of those captured in the photo remain unidentified.\n\nThe Dancing Deck\n\nFrom the front door of Bridget’s home can be seen the Sluice gate which is directly opposite on the most northerly stretch of the lake. Beyond the sluice gate before the lake turns southwards was a feature which was not uncommon in many parishes towards the early part of the last century. The feature which I refer to was Emy’s “Dancing deck”. I am most grateful to Nancy McCluskey for the information on this which was compiled by her daughter Mary in 1990 for a Heritage Year project. These are the memories of her granny Minnie McKenna.\n\nThe last of James’s sons to remain on home soil was Patrick.\n\nPatrick was born on the 31st of January 1844. According to his the Baptismal register Patrick was baptised on the 8th February 1844. He married Catherine “Mor” McKenna and they settled down in the adjoining town land of Derrygasson. Patrick died on the 31st of October 1914.\n\nThe following are the children of Patrick and Catherine:-\n\nMary Anne born on 20th October 1876.\n\nAgain another Mary Anne born on 29th January 1878. (It looks likely that the first of these children died shortly after childbirth). It was not unnatural for parents to name a newly born baby after a previous deceased child. This occurrence also happened in the birth of 2 of Thomas and Bridget McCluskey’s children both named “Bridget”. Neither of these children lived long after birth.\n\nCharles the next born married Mary McGennis, Benraw, Leitrim, Co Down. They had no family. He was a business man who studied in Belfast. He\n\nwas the author of his own “Pedigree of the McCloskey (Lough Emy) family” and local historian. He also compiled and published a booklet of his own poetry. He owned and resided at the premises which is now recognised as the Centra Store at the junction of the Glaslough road on Main Street, Emyvale. He was appointed Peace Commissioner for the County when the 26 counties gained Independence in 1922 and held that position for life. He was elected a member of Monaghan County Council in 1925 election and subsequent elections up until 1942 when he decided not to go forward for election. He was a member of the Truagh Old Age Pension Committee since 1918 and a Director of the Irish Tourist Association since 1925. He was one of the founders of Mullan Mills Boot factory in 1924 and a Director until 1942.\n\nFirst and last verses of one of Charles’s poem MY HEART’S IN COUNTY MONAGHAN which demonstrates his deep affection for his homeland and his pride of place.\n\n“My heart’s in County Monaghan,\n\nWhere it’s sheltered by Tyrone,\n\nThe home of the McKenna clan,\n\nAnd many an Altar Stone.\n\nI loved to climb its little hills,\n\nIn the happy days of youth,\n\nAnd linger round the old corn mills,\n\nIn the winding lanes of Truagh.\n\n………………..\n\nThe mountain stream by Scarna town,\n\nOver rocks, through wooded glen,\n\nWith noisy haste, comes tumbling down,\n\nLosing speed through Tully fen.\n\nThey linger still, those days in mind,\n\nBringing back the joys of youth,\n\nThe peace serene, ‘mongst people kind,\n\nIn the old ‘Green Woods of Truagh.’ “\n\nSusan was born on the 29th March 1882. Susan married Charles Finn and they lived in Glasgow. They had 2 children Kathleen and Patricia both Art teachers. Kathleen entered the Benedictine Order of Nuns on the 8th of December 1953.\n\nCatherine was born on the 19th of January 1884. She was married to Arthur Quinn and they resided in Dumfries, Scotland. They had 2 children Arthur and Margaret. Arthur Jnr. emigrated to New Zealand. Margaret married John Meighan, Dumfries and had 2 children.\n\nJames was the next born. He married Annie McGennis, Benraw, Leitrim, Co Down. They had 3 children Josephine, Patrick and Seamus.\n\nMargaret Ann was born on the 14th of August 1887. Margaret married James Pettigrew. Jim worked in the Engineering Department, G.P.O., Belfast. They had no family.\n\nJohn was born on the 12th of July 1889. John married Mary McMahon in Scotland. They had 2 daughters Maureen and Kathleen. Maureen was married. John died in the year 1951.\n\nPatrick was born on the 11th of March 1891. He was married to Patricia Payne from Scotland. They had 2 children Patricia a teacher in Glasgow and Desmond who was studying for the priesthood in Maynooth College. Desmond did not become a priest. After completing his university degree Desmond lectured in the Social Science faculty.\n\nBridget the youngest married Patrick Kennedy.\n\nThey had 2 daughters Mollie and Annie.\n\nMollie married well known seed merchant from Monaghan town Luke Skeath. Bridget died in June 1921.\n\nNext we have Mary, the only daughter of James and Mary who along with her 3 brothers above remained at home in Ireland.\n\nMary’s date of birth is around the date of her baptism in Donagh which was performed on the 20th of July 1848. I am indebted to Sean Corr, Enniskillen library who lives in Knockatallon for assisting me with Mary’s spouse. I had always relied on the data of Charles McCluskey in which he gives us the name of Peter Mullan as her husband, a farmer from Knockatallon, Scotstown about 7 miles from Emyvale. This error on the part of Charles could well be explained in the fact that Mary had a son called Peter. Besides Charles does not quote primary sources. Mary’s husband was in fact John Mullin as spelt in the Donagh parish marriage register where they were married on the 22nd July 1871. In the year 1947 her granddaughter was married and then living on the home farm. Mary had a daughter Bridget who married John Lawless an engineer. Bridget married John in The Holy family chuch, Belfast on the 26th June 1902. John died about the year 1941. John and Bridget resided in London and they had 3 children. Sean the eldest was born in Belfast where they were still residing since the time of their marriage. Desmond the youngest of the two sons was born on the 18th June 1910 in Monaghan. By this time Bridget’s husband John was employed as an engineer with St Davnet’s Hospital. Their daughter Christened Mary Frances was born on the 2nd May 1913. Desmond continued to reside with his mother Bridget after her husband’s death. He was a Medical Doctor and during the 2nd World War he rose to the rank of Lt. Colonel in the British Army. He was awarded and O.B.E. for his great work in Burma organising relief in the famine areas there. Bridget’s eldest son Sean was secretary of the Irish Club in London. He had his Medical Practice in London also. He died at the age of 58 years on the 15th of October 1965. Their daughter Mary married a Dr. Murphy who had his practice in Lancashire.\n\nJames and Mary’s other 3 sons who emigrated to the United States of America again were John, James and Charles.\n\nHereunder, is (obviously!) a very early picture of one of these 3 sons James and his family.\n\nJames was born on the 17th of July 1841 in Emy, Emyvale, Co Monaghan. He was employed as a section foreman with the B&O Railroad. He died on the 27th of November 1924. His wife was Bridget McGlynn from either Co Donegal or Co Dublin , was born about 1839, and died November 1889. From the data I have received on this family I have tried to match as best as possible the names of the children from their dates of birth. The following is a brief description of each member of James’s family:-\n\nMary was born 26th May 1866.She was christened Mary Agnes. She married Frank E. Pfeiffer on the 21st of August 1888 and together they had six\n\nsons and two daughters. She died on the 9th of July 1928 and is interred at Calvary cemetery in Dayton, Ohio.

(The history of John Thomas and Margaret’s family could not be summarised in a single paragraph so a I have dedicated a separate chapter to this family alone).\n\nWilliam Patrick was born on the 25th of February 1874 in Baltimore, Dayton, Montgomery Co, Ohio. He left home in 4th year at school, was an inventor, and retired at the age of 38 years from plumbing, steam fitting, hardware, and candy and ice cream manufacturing businesses at 5308 Butler St., Pittsburgh, Pa..
