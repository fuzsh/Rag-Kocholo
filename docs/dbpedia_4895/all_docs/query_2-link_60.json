        "text": "HISTORY NEBRASKA MANUSCRIPT FINDING AID\n\nRG1042.AM: John Gneisenau Neihardt, 1861-1973\n\nPapers: 1911-1983\n\nBancroft, Cuming County, Nebraska: Epic poet, Professor\n\nSize: 4.0 cu.ft.; 8 boxes\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nJohn Gneisenau Neihardt was born near Sharpsburg, Illinois, on January 8, 1861, the third child of Nicholas Nathan Neihardt and Alice Culler Neihardt. In 1886 the family moved to a sod house in northwestern Kansas, and then to Kansas City in 1888. In 1891, he moved with his mother and sisters, Lulu and Grace, to Wayne, Nebraska, where he attended Nebraska Normal College, graduating at the age of 16. He finished his first book, The Divine Enchantment, based on Vedanta philosophy, at age 16, and published it three years later.\n\nAfter teaching at a country school for two terms, he moved to Bancroft Nebraska, where he worked with an Indian trader among the Omahas. He edited the Bancroft Blade, a country weekly, for several years there. During this time he lived among the Sioux Indians, becoming an authority on their traditions and customs. His interactions with the Sioux later inspired his writing of Black Elk Speaks.\n\nHe married Mona Martinsen (1884-1958), a sculptress and one time student of Rodin, in 1908. They had four children: Hilda, Alice, Enid, and Sigurd (deceased January 5, 1973).\n\nIn 1912, Neihardt began his major work, A Cycle of the West, devoting 18 years to its writing. He also worked for the Minneapolis Journal [c.1912-1916]. In 1921, the Nebraska Legislature named him Poet Laureate. As literary editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, he wrote book reviews [c.1926-1938]. He was Poet in Residence, and Lecturer in English at the University of Missouri-Columbia from 1949-1965.\n\nNeihardt was a member of a number of organizations, including the National Institute of Arts and Letters, New York; the International Institute of Arts and Letters, Germany; founder of the Westerners; first civilian member, Order of the Indian Wars of the United States, 1927; vice president of the Midwest division of the Poetry Society of America; and chancellor of the Academy of American Poetry (1951-1967).\n\nNeihardt received numerous honors for his literary ability. In 1919, he won the Poetry Society’s national prize and the gold medal for foremost poet of the nation from the Poetry Center of New York. His bust was placed in the State Capitol building in Lincoln Nebraska (1961). In 1968, the Nebraska governor named the first Sunday in August Neihardt Day. That same year the United Poets Laureate International named him Prairie Poet of America. He received the Thomas Jefferson Award from the University of Missouri-Columbia. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln awarded him the Nebraska Builder’s Award in 1972. In 1973, literary experts named his A Cycle of the West as one of the 3000 best books in the 3000 years from Homer to Hemingway.\n\nSeveral colleges and universities in the Midwest granted Neihardt honorary degrees. He was awarded an honorary Litt. D. from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (1917), the University of Missouri (1947), and Midland Lutheran College (1972). He also received an honorary LL. D. from Creighton University in Omaha (1928).\n\nJohn Neihardt died on November 3, 1973, at the age of 92.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE\n\nThe materials in this collection relate to the life and work of John Neihardt. The collection is arranged according to the following series: 1) Writings by Neihardt; 2) Correspondence; 3) Writings About Neihardt; 4) Legislative Resolutions; 5) Scrapbooks; and 6) Miscellaneous.\n\nSeries 1 includes twenty-five folders of manuscript materials relating to the second half of Neihardt’s autobiography, All Is But A Beginning. According to notes made at the time of donation, the twenty-eight legal pads were written at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Julius Young in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mrs. Young apparently helped with the work after Neihardt became ill. The manuscripts are mostly in the handwriting of Neihardt, with some passages in Myrtle Young’s hand. Neihardt died before completing the manuscript, leaving the autobiography incomplete. The legal pads were left in the order in which they were received at the Nebraska State Historical Society.\n\nAlso included in Series 1 are Neihardt’s handwritten and typed prose, arranged alphabetically, and poetry written by John Neihardt. One folder holds a copy of the Nebraska Normal College Song, with lyrics written by John Neihardt. The last part of Series 1 includes book reviews and articles written by Neihardt during his early career working for the Minneapolis Journal and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. His column in the Post-Dispatch was titled “Of Making Many Books.” The reviews are filed chronologically. Researchers should note that only a portion of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reviews, and none from the Minneapolis Journal are contained in this collection. Microfilm copies of these newspapers may be available from other institutions through Inter-Library Loan [ILL].\n\nCorrespondence between Neihardt and various persons form the content of Series 2. The first part of the series contains letters to and from a single individual. The folders are titled alphabetically by the name of the individual, and the letters within each grouping are filed chronologically. The last part of the series contains the remaining general correspondence and is arranged chronologically. A majority of the correspondence is included here, but because some correspondence was directly related to materials in other areas, it was placed in those folders.\n\nSeries 3 consists of writings about Neihardt, including a bibliography of Neihardt’s works [including biographical information], and a 1920 treatise on Neihardt by Julius T. House. Also included are reviews written about Neihardt’s works, filed chronologically; substantial criticism of Neihardt’s literary work, including three articles about Neihardt, and criticism of Neihardt produced for the Western Literature Association Conference in 1977; pamphlets and programs relating to Neihardt; newsletters concerning Neihardt; newspaper clippings and biographical information. The last section of Series 3 consists of miscellaneous excerpts from articles with information about Neihardt compiled by Elmer Holm. The information may relate to the Holm letters in Series 2.\n\nSeries 4 contains legislative resolutions relating to John Neihardt, as well as program materials relating to the unveiling of the Neihardt portrait bust. All relevant information and correspondence has been kept with the original legislative resolutions.\n\nThe scrapbooks of Series 5 contain mostly newspaper clippings about John Neihardt.\n\nSeries 6 contains miscellaneous information about Neihardt, including fragments of an interview between Donald Danker and John Neihardt in 1971; the jacket design for Black Elk Speaks; the wedding announcement of John Neihardt and Mona Martinsen; information about Neihardt’s family history [Hilda Neihardt’s widow’s pension records, and Neihardt’s father’s military enlistment records, etc.]; educational aids for the use of Song Of Three Friends in the classroom; and other materials.\n\nINVENTORY\n\nSeries 1 – Writings by Neihardt\n\nBox 1\n\nFolder\n\nPart A: Manuscript Autobiography\n\nPart B: Manuscript Autobiography\n\nPart C: Manuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nBox 2\n\nFolder\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nManuscript Autobiography\n\nArticle, My Most Unforgettable Character, Jan. 1970\n\nThe Alien, [typescript]\n\nCaptain Marsh, [handwritten, not Neihardt’s handwriting] April, 1973\n\nThe Coming of the Word, [typescript] January, 1973\n\nThe Homecoming of the Bride, [handwritten, not Neihardt’s handwriting], 1973\n\nBox 3\n\nFolder\n\nLaureate Address (Chicago: The Bookfellows, 1921)\n\nPlaymates, [handwritten, not Neihardt’s handwriting], undated\n\nNotes to Song of Three Friends, [handwritten] undated\n\nThe White Radiance, Mimeograph, undated\n\nThe Song of the Indian War (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1925)\n\nPhotocopies of changes by Neihardt for The Song of the Indian War, undated\n\nThe Nebraska Normal College Song, published, undated\n\nThe Quest (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1916)\n\nReviews and articles, 1917\n\nReviews and articles, 1927-1935\n\nReviews and articles, undated\n\nSeries 2 – Correspondence\n\nMrs. Brockway, 1922\n\nRex Carey, 1909, 1959\n\nU.S. Conn, 1926\n\nU.S. Conn, 1931\n\nU.S. Conn, 1932\n\nU.S. Conn, 1934\n\nDanker, 1961\n\nElanita Frye, 1959, 1961\n\nBox 4\n\nFolder\n\nElmer and Mary Holm, 1938\n\nElmer and Mary Holm, 1939\n\nElmer and Mary Holm, 1940\n\nElmer and Mary Holm, 1941\n\nElmer and Mary Holm, 1942\n\nElmer and Mary Holm, Undated and Fragments\n\nRon Hull, 1961, 1965\n\nLouis Ledoux information, undated\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1907\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1908\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1909\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1910\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1911\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1912\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1913\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1914\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1915\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1916\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1917\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1918\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1919\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1920\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1921\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1923\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1924\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1940\n\nLouis Ledoux, 1941\n\nLouis Ledoux, Undated\n\nLetters to Ledoux from other writers, 1908-1911\n\nLetters to Ledoux from Mona Neihardt and others, undated [photocopies]\n\nLetters to Ledoux from Neihardt, 1911-1941 [photocopies of F13-27]\n\nLetters to Ledoux from Neihardt, undated [photocopies of F28]\n\nJohn Madden, 1968\n\nBox 5\n\nFolder\n\nMasters, 1921-1925\n\nReuben Nelson, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1977\n\nAddison E.
