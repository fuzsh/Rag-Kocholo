        "text": "Conn is a masculine English and Irish-language given name,[1] as well as an English-language surname.[2] The origin of the given name is uncertain. It may be related to the Old Irish cond (\"intellect\", \"mind\", \"king\"), or perhaps to the Old Irish cenn (\"head\", \"chief\", \"queen\"). The latter word-origin may have resulted from a popular, but incorrect etymology, applied to the Old Irish terms Leth Cuinn and Dál Cuinn; these terms originally meant \"half of the chief\" or \"half of the king\" and \"tribe of the chief\" but were mistakenly regarded to mean \"half of Conn\" and \"tribe of Conn\".[3] In some cases the given name is as a short form of names that begin with the first syllable Con- (such as the names Conor and Connor).[4]\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican\n\n[edit]\n\nBilly Conn (1917–1993), American boxer\n\nBobby Conn (born 1967), American musician\n\nCanary Conn (born 1949), American musician and non-fiction author\n\nCharles Paul Conn (born 1945), American non-fiction author and university president\n\nCharles G.
