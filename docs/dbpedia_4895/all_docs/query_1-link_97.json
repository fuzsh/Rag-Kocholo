        "text": "www.johnmccluskeyauthor.com I am an author, avid reader, husband and father of two grown children, and currently live in Connecticut. I was born in Chicago and grew up there - the Midwest being a wonderful place to experience early childhood - then moved to Connecticut at nine years old when the family relocated due to my father's job. We lived there until I went to college in Los Angeles where I met my wife. I worked in the IT industry in LA, New York City and Connecticut (returning after many years) and am now retired and devote full time to writing and photography. I write mostly about family dynamics and have done so over many years. My photography centers mostly around New York City, New Orleans and New England. I like to read the classics, and often reread them. My favorite authors are James Agee, Eugene O'Neill, Zora Neale Hurston, Emily Dickinson, James Baldwin, Elizabeth Bishop, Grace Paley, Djuna Barnes, Tennessee Williams, J D Salinger, and really a host of others. I know this list sounds terribly pretentious, but I learned a lot about writing from reading these authors over the years, so they're near and dear to me. And I am fascinated with how well their truths hold up as time marches on. Interview: https://heatherlbarksdale.com/author-interview/john-mccluskey\n\nRead full bio"
