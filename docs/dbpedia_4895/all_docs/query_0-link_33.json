On April 18, 2013, they both pleaded guilty last year to drug conspiracy charges for supplying four pounds of meth to [former Msg. Kevin Wallin, 61] of Waterbury. Laschober awaits sentencing.\n\nFederal prosecutors said the couple sent between one and three pounds of meth to Wallin on a monthly basis for around four years.\n\nProsecutors were looking for an eight-year sentence, while McCluskey's defense team is sought a five-year sentence.\"\n\nWallin was a close, personal advisor to three successive bishops including Walter Curtis, Edward Egan, now the retired cardinal of the New York archdiocese, and William Lori, who was promoted to archbishop of Baltimore.\n\nUnder Lori, Wallin was a chaplain to the Order of Malta and appointed rector of the diocese's cathedral, St. Augustine, located in gritty downtown Bridgeport."
