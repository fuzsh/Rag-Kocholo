        "text": "List of Surname Histories compiled by Brian Mitchell\n\nI have compiled concise, one-page histories (c. 500 words) of 386 surnames, of Gaelic and Planter origin, which are most closely associated, through numerical strength or uniqueness, with North West Ireland (in this instance counties Derry, Donegal, Fermanagh and Tyrone).\n\nOne-page Surname Histories have been compiled for Surnames and Surname Variants highlighted in bold type (e.g. Kane and O’Kane; Hassan and Hasson; Sheils, Shields and Shiels, etc.). These surnames and linked names are recorded in the database of church and civil registers, dating from 1628 to 1930, created by Derry Genealogy which is now accessible online at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.\n\nTo read the surname histories click this link:\n\nhttps://rootsireland.ie/derry/surname-history.php\n\nThese family histories are free to view at no cost and with no limit to those with a current subscription:"
