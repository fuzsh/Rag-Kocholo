Tondro, 1992-2000\n\nMcQuillin: The Law of Municipal Corporations – access through Westlaw.\n\nFor the past several years, almost all newly published items added to the library’s collection have been in electronic format only. These items are accessible in full text through the library’s intranet catalog. Many old print materials have also been digitized and uploaded to the library’s catalog.\n\nTo get a general sense of a subject’s history, however, you may find it useful to browse the library stacks in certain locations to see print copies of older publications (and the occasional newer item that was published both electronically and in print). For publications related to veterans’ affairs, call number ranges include, but are not limited to:\n\n338.48 production – government policies\n\n(defense industry)\n\n355 military science\n\nHard copies of mandated reports that were produced only once or as a limited series are shelved by the number of the act that required the report. Hard copies of mandated reports produced regularly with no set end date (for example, state agencies’ annual reports) are shelved in the stacks by subject.\n\nThe Choice Act and veterans’ educationThe Choice Act and veterans’ education – by Suzanne Hultin, NCSL, 2015\n\nDepartment of Veterans’ Affairs: Office of Advocacy and AssistanceDepartment of Veterans’ Affairs: Office of Advocacy and Assistance – by the Office of Program Review and Investigations, 2015\n\nPreparing for duty: state policy options to sustain military installationsPreparing for duty: state policy options to sustain military installations – by Jennifer Schultz, NCSL, 2016\n\nState policies on service dogs for military veteransState policies on service dogs for military veterans – by James B.

Reports from 1994 to the present are in the library’s file cabinets (aka the “vertical files”) in the red-tabbed folders, as well as online in full text. Older reports are in two sets of bound volumes (one set for the 1970s, and one for 1980-1993) on the library’s shelves.\n\nThe same index headings the library uses for OLR Reports have been used to organize over 600 subject files of materials such as newspaper clippings, court decisions, press releases, pamphlets, and other resources that would be more difficult to locate if they were dispersed throughout the library’s general collection. The subject files are in the blue-tabbed folders in the file cabinets. (Many of the items in these folders have also been digitized by the library, and their electronic versions can be found in the library’s intranet catalog.)"
