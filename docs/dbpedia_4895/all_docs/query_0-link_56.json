        "text": "Leaving a Condolence\n\nStep #1 - Navigate to the Condolences & Tributes tab on the left, and then click on \"View Condolences\".\n\nStep #2 - Click on the gray bar labeled \"Leave a Condolence\" at the top center of the page.\n\nStep #3 - Enter the name of the person who is leaving the condolence message.\n\nStep #4 - Enter the email address of the person who is leaving the condolence message.\n\nStep #5 - Enter a condolence message in the text box. You will be alerted to any misspellings by the system (with a red line under the suspected misspelling, and with a right click of your mouse, you'll be given alternative suggestions).\n\nStep #6 - Complete the \"Captcha\" question, designed to ensure that the response is generated by a human being.\n\nStep #7 - Place a check mark inside the box if you wish to make the condolence message private (optional).\n\nStep #8 - Click the \"Post Condolence\" button.\n\nStep #9 - There is the option to provide feedback about this service. You may choose to enter a comment and select \"Submit Comment\", or simply select \"No Thanks\".\n\nStep #10 - Once the condolence has been submitted, you will be taken to the Condolences page. At this point (if you've not already done so) you can do one of three things: make the condolence private (if you had originally set it to be a public message), modify the condolence, or remove it completely.\n\nFor Families\n\nOnce a condolence has been sent, only the public condolences will be displayed within the Book of Memoriesâ„¢. Private condolences will not be shown. You will be able to view all of the private condolences either by using the Family Log-in feature or having your email address included in the Condolence Email List. This is a list of recipients in which all of the condolences will be sent to (family and/or friends).\n\nEither can be done within the client editor. If you are a family member and have questions about receiving private messages of condolence, please contact us.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nThe condolences will be sent to all email addresses within the Condolence Email List at 4am and 4pm (EST) only.\n\nAll condolences are filtered for keywords that are not appropriate."
