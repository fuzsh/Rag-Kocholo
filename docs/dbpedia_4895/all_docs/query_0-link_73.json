        "text": "Michael “Mikey” McCluskey, 63, of Peekskill, New York, passed away on April 4, 2023, at home with his loving family by his side after a long battle with metastatic melanoma.\n\nHe was born in the Bronx, New York to John and Marie (Ebert) McCluskey. He attended Brewster High School (Class of 1978), where he developed lifelong friendships. Michael retired as a mechanic from UPS in Norwalk, Connecticut, after working there for 35 years. He made many great friends that he considered his family. After retirement, he had a part-time job that he loved at Westchester County Mowing Fairways at Mohansic Golf Course. He was also a proud member of the Tri-State Teamsters Local 191.\n\nHe was a devoted husband, father, and papa. He was proud of his oldest son James for all of his dedication in school and for becoming the husband and father he was, he mentioned him to his doctors often, bringing up that he worked in Pathology in Houston. He was proud of his youngest son Christopher and loved watching him grow into the amazing husband and father that he is. He was proud to hear all of the stories of him showing his sons how to fix and make things with their hands just as he did as a mechanic for so many years. Watching his oldest daughter Samantha raise her son to love the outdoors, especially fishing and camping, just as he showed her as a young girl brought him such joy. To say how extremely proud he was of his youngest daughter Margaret is an understatement, to see her follow her dreams at Iona College and seeing the young woman she was becoming brought such enjoyment to his life. The love he had for his wife Barbara was beyond measure. He thanked her to the very end for all that she had done for him over the last few years, taking him to all of his appointments, caring for his every need, and putting his care first before anything else.\n\nHis grandsons were his everything and he cherished every moment he was able to spend with them. He felt especially blessed to have taken a trip to Lake George last summer that he was\n\nable to spend with them and was hoping to make it an annual trip. He also had a love of camping and racing his R.C. cars that he was planning on showing his grandsons.\n\nHe loved life and always wanted everyone to feel welcomed and loved. Always making close friends wherever he went. He loved to have a good time and joke around. He had an ongoing joke with his loving sister Lillian and whenever he got the chance he would send her pictures or emojis to try to make her laugh. He was always joking around with his amazing nurses at New York Presbyterian Oncology Department especially Mary, which made going to his appointments easier.\n\nMichael is survived and missed by his loving wife Barbara (Perrone) of 23 years; his children: son James and wife Kristine, son Christopher and wife Nicole, daughter Samantha and husband Joseph, and daughter Margaret. He will be forever cherished and remembered by his grandsons, Jackson, Kellan, Brody, Maverick, Jean Luc, and Rowan. He will be missed by his parents John and Marie (Ebert) as well as his sister Lillian and husband Luke, his father-in-law Rocco, sister in laws Patti and Frankie, his nephews Brandon, Johnny, and William, as well as many other family members.\n\nHe was predeceased by his mother-in-law Barbara.\n\nThere are no words that can express how grateful and blessed we are to our family/friends/neighbors who were there for us on the night of his passing. Also, a heartfelt thank you to all of his doctors, especially Dr. Vinit Karur, and the nurses that took such great care of him throughout these past few years. We love you.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to the Cancer Center of New York-Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital in honor of Michael McCluskey.\n\nDonations may be sent to: Office of Development at New York-Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital, 1980 Crompond Road, Cortlandt Manor, NY 10567.\n\nVisitation will be held on Monday, April 10, 2023, from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm at Joseph F. Nardone Funeral Home, 414 Washington Street, Peekskill, NY.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be held on Tuesday, April 11, 2023, at 10:00 am at Church of the Assumption, 920 1st Street, Peekskill, NY.\n\nPrivate Cremation to follow."
