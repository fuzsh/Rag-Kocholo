        "text": "Joe McCluskey must be rated as one of the greatest performers in the history of US distance running. Between 1930 and 1943 he won the AAU steeplechase a record nine times and was three times a winner of a distance race on the flat. Indoors, he won the AAU steeplechase eight times and won the two miles on the flat in 1930. While at Fordham University, he built up an impressive record at the IC4A championships, winning the outdoor two miles twice and the indoor title three times. McCluskey was equally talented and durable as a cross-country runner. He won the individual AAU title in 1932 and was a scoring member of the New York AC team which won the AAU team title in 1941, 1946, and 1947.\n\nA two-time Olympian, Joe McCluskey was unlucky not to win a silver medal in 1932. At the 3,000 m mark he was in second place, but due to an error on the part of the officials, an extra lap was run during which McCluskey dropped back to third place. In 1936 he finished 10th and in 1948 he failed to make the Olympic team for a third time when, at the age of 37, he finished a commendable fifth at the Final Trials.\n\nPersonal Best: 3000S – 9:13.9 (1936)."
