        "text": "Joe McCluskeyÂ (Joseph Paul McCluskey;Â June 2, 1911 â August 31, 2002) was an American Â track and field athelete . During his running career, he won 27 national titles in various distance events and captured the steeplechaseÂ title a record nine times in a 13-year period.\n\nAt the 1932 Summer OlympicsÂ in Los Angeles, McCluskey won the bronze medal in the 3,000-meter steeplechase event. However, his medal could have been a silver. A substitute lap counter failed to hold up the number of the laps remaining the first time the runners went past, and the athletes wound up running an extra lap. McCluskey was second at what should have been the end of the regular race but dropped back to third during the extra lap. When offered the opportunity to rerun the race the next day, McCluskey said, \"A race has only one finish line\"Â and chose to let the results stand making it the only 3,460-meter steeplechase event ever held in Olympic history."
