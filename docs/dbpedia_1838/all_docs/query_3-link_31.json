        "text": "Do you remember (OOOOOoooooo) :O yeah!\n\nAnd (ab meri itni bhi tarif maat karo/ ab me itna bhi kuch khass ni) 😂 .\n\nOfcourse hehehe 😅 !\n\nWhat about the mature flirt (Didi kya ap mere saath ice cream khana passand karo ge ). 😍 😍 😘 😚 .\n\nAnd do u know that in uncensored episodes sinchan use to say to his mother ( bachche churane walli moti budiya / fat old lady who steals kids) 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\nDinner m shimla~mirch(capsicum)😷 😷 .\n\nEvery morning when shin chan wakesup half~a~sleep and see’s his dad he says :-\n\nOh ! Mujhe lagta hai maine apko kahi dekha hai 😶 😅😅\n\nthis one is epic :\n\nHaati mera haati ,mera pyaara hati !🐘🐘🐷🐷🐽🐽\n\nA weird 5 years old kid making the whole world roll~over~the floor laughing.\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅\n\nWe all love shin~chan for his brazen replies,witty nature & his beyond age flirting.\n\nFew questions has arried in the air after the death of the maker of shin~chan (Yoshita Usu). Real story just came out to be depressive.\n\nWhy shin~chan anime was made?\n\nWhy name of the series is “crayon Shin~chan?\n\nIs shin chan going to end with the death of him?\n\nWhy ‘ shinko’ has no background story , why it is mentioned that she’s from future ?\n\nIs it true that shin chan and Hemawaari were real characters,and they both dead? 😭😭😭\n\nBefore you gothrough the real depressive content which will tear u apart .\n\nShinchan is a real life story of a Japanese family called “Nohara’s family”\n\nIt is said that one day shinko just gave a paper to shinchan ,written “take care of Himawari” as if she knows what is going to happen & gave hints about death of both~of’em.\n\nIS SHIN~CHAN REALLY DEAD ?\n\nThe story is that of Misae and her family. Her family consisted of her husband, her kids Shin Chan, Himawaari and their cute little pet Shiro. One day, Shin Chan and Himawari went to the market with their parents for their usual grocery shopping.\n\nSuddenly, Shin Chan observed that his little sister Himawari was crossing the street without any assistance. He ran in order to rescue her. But unfortunately, they met with an accident and both died.\n\nMisae got very depressed after this incident. So, she began depicting the lives of her kids on a scrap-book with crayon of shin chan. That’s also the reason why this show is called ‘Crayon Shin Chan’\n\nShe used to imagine how her son and daughter life would had ,if alive.\n\n――>click here background music<――\n\nThis story inspired Yoshita Usui (the illustrator of the serial) so much that he decided to create an anime by the name Crayon Shin Chan.\n\nYes, all of those sassy, light-hearted moments that we saw on the television were actually the creations of Shin Chan’s mother.\n\nThe story that made us laugh so hard is actually the result of a tragic incident.\n\nAlso in the last episose Shin Chan dieds.\n\nSupposedly, he dies while saving his little sister and the producers decided to cancel the broadcast because they found it to be too depressing.\n\nNow that i know about the tragic death of “Shin~chan” , what should I do / how should i laugh again on his stupid joke 😭\n\n*baka* *baka*生き返ります 😭 😭\n\nIam Tilak_TRS guy with beard & heading nowhere in life,not yet!!!!\n\nDonno how should i block tears leaking through eyes , even if leaking filled up ,my head might blow~up off the pressure *boom*😂😂 😭*cry* cuz u been the only one who had always lighted~up the depressive and ass~a~holic days into bright laughing’s , That creepy smiles u make .\n\n*fall’s on knees crying 😭*\n\n|~~~Shin chan appeared and said~~~|\n\n“””Haati mera pyaraa haati, haatttiii mera pyara haati”””” 🐽\n\n💞💗 Love u buddy, 💞💗"
