        "text": "Seriously is there any episodes with Pokemon parodies or references? Pokemon was a big enough part of pop culture to be parodied. American shows like the Simpsons and South Park parodied, it is only natural for a Japanese show like Crayon Shin Chan to do the same.\n\nI can only imagine what the creative minds of Shin Chan would have done.\n\nJust because we did doesn't mean they'll do it. They've already done parodies of \"Detective Conan\", \"Lupin the III\", and \"Sailor Moon\".\n\nAnyway, I guess I'll give some specific examples of stuff from \"Shin-Chan\" I'd like to see FUNimation work on.\n\nThere was episode I saw where Penny finds a lost little boy and asks Shin to help find his mommy. Shin decides to cheer the boy up by doing a dance with his weener, and of course Penny just gets upset at Shin. After taking a visit to the department store and some other mischief, they finally find his mom. But once they're home and the mom decides to give her son some dinner, he decides to show her the \"dance\" he learned from Shin.\n\nAnother one I really like is \"Worried About a Melon\". In it Mitzi and Shin win a melon in a raffle and Mitzi and Hiro are excited since melons are so expensive in Japan. While Mitzi is out Shin decides to eat some of the melon but then remembers that Mitzi said they're saving it as a special dessert after dinner. Shin sneaks to his room and tries to tape the melon beck together, then he tries super-gluing it, and when he just flat-out destroys the melon he decides to frame Whitey for stealing the melon. Of course Mitzi catches on when Shin shows her the dog tracks leading to the ruined melon, and well, I'm sure you can guess what Mitzi does next.\n\nOne of the best episodes is when Mitzi takes Shin to be on a childrens' show. Shin is watching a little kids' show, the kind where they have other little kids' dancing to music, but he's only watching it for the hot lady hosting the show. Mitzi tells Shin that she got tickets so that Shin can be one of the little kids dancing in an episode of said show. After several times of Shin being obnoxious and harrasing the employees at the studio, he and Mitzi have one last talk and Shin promises to be a good boy for the rest of the time at the studio. Finally Shin-chan is up to dance with the hot lady along with the other kids at the studio, but unfortunately Shin starts doing some of his own sexual harrasment. While the host is trying to compose herself Shin starts climbing around on her body, and calls start coming into the studio of seeing a \"ghost\" on the show. Eventually it ends with Shin pulling down her skirt and the show going off air due to technical difficulties.\n\nAnother episode whose name I can't remember involves Shin's aunt coming over to visit Mitzi, but she's out shopping and she and Shin are alone together. Shin sees her big stomach and explains that she's pregnant, she even lets Shin listen to the baby inside her. They then go down to the supermarket to find Mitzi, but then Shin starts going up to fat people asking if they're pregnant, trying to hear some thumping noises in their stomachs, and asking if their unborn child is gay. Everyone starts yelling and fighting with Shin's aunt telling her to keep her kid under control, and while she's distracted Shin finds his mom and they just leave, without Shin telling his mom where his aunt is.\n\nIf we want to see the earlier episodes I think FUNimation should do all the episodes where new characters are introduced, since it'll make it easier for [adult swim] viewers to grasp that there was once a \"Shin-Chan\" universe where certain established characters in the FUNimation dub didn't necessarily exist. In addition to the famous \"Pregnant Mitzi\" arc, I'd love to see where Shin first meets Nanako, Shin just bumps into her on the street and I don't remember exactly what happens but it's very cute and funny. Then when Nanako meets Mitzi he gets all excited because she gets invited for dinner. Shin spends all day preparing the house for her arrival but gets so tired he sleeps the whole time she's over. Another vignette in that half-hour episode is when Mitzi lets Shin go to the amusement park with Nanako. While he goes to get ice cream for them some guys come over and start hitting on her, but Nanko just replies by saying she's with her boyfriend Shinnosuke. Then when they're on the ferris wheel he has a nervous breakdown while trying to propose to Nanako. At least that's how I remember it.\n\nAll the \"Shin-Chan\" movies look great, if FUNimation only releases one I'll be happy with any of them, whether it's the spy-themed movie where the Noharas meet the three cross-dressers or the one where they go to the Henderlands and go up against the two gay ballerinas. But if I got to choose one I'd choose \"The Adult Empire Strikes Back\". In it a 20th Century Museum opens up in Kasukabe and while Shin and his friends are bored, their parents and teachers are all reliving their cherished childhood memories. Eventually the mastermind behind the museum lets a \"scent\" out that brings all the adults in town to a child-like state, leaving Shin and all the other kids in a disoriented state. Of course Shin and the others make an attempt to fight back against the adult empire, and while there are plenty of funny moments I will say I was surprised there were also plenty of deep serious moments that come close to making you cry. You'll have to see it for yourself. I'd also like to mention the 2007 movie if not for its rousing ending sequence: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akpgzDhGSs4&feature=related\n\nI definitely want to see this vignette done by FUNimation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3Yo7eem3tc . I don't know what the lyrics to the song mean but from what I gather it seems to be \"Shin-Chan\" in a nutshell.\n\nAnd I want to see FUNimation dub the other theme song sequences. Here are the current opening theme sequences: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvX4KFJKkZ4. If I could choose one I'd go with the third.\n\nI saw few of the episodes, the one with the children is defentely one of the better episodes, would love to see that episode. I do hope the FUNimation shows the rest of Kento tournament episode which they showed the beginning of last week.\n\nThe episode with Shin's pregenent aunt that is pre Himawara, at the time Shin was a only child.\n\nI do agree with you, the Nanako episodes are cute. Those episodes show the sweat and kind side of Shin, that we rarely see. I never saw the first Nanako episode, would like to see that. Also as previous mention is the \"A Present For Miss Nanako\" episode in which Shin makes a present for Nanako but is too tired to give it to her at the end. It shows the soft side of Shin, but I don't think that is what FUNimation is looking for, so they might choose not to have to many of those episodes.\n\n\"Taking Care Of Nanako\" - the episode in which Nanako is ill, Shin rushes to her apartment to take care of her. Before he gets there, Nanako fells better and leaves the apartment just as her fat room mate shows up to take a nap. Nanako's father calls and Shin answers the phone, Shin informs him he is in Nanako's apartment and thinking the man is a suitor for Nanako tells him off. Nanako's father rushes to her apartment, while the women in bed who is delious dreaming about someone, who Shin thinks is Nanako motions to Shin to get in bed, Shin is hessident at first since he is only five, but gets in and lies next to the women under the sheets. Nanako's father arrives, takes off the blanket to reveal Shin and Nanako's roomate, and three of them scream in horror. It is a real funny episode, very Three's Company like with the mistaking identiy and misunderstandings.\n\n\"Shin's Gonna Be A Famous Singer\" - Shin playing with his musical toys is drivng Misae crazy. Misae maybe Shin could be a rock star (there is a funny fantasy of Shin playing electric guitar in a concert in front of screaming fans). She enrolls Shin in a music school for gifted children. Shin auditions, and drives everyone nuts as usual with his antics, including him using his butt as a drum. Misae had a funny line of Shin's butt used to being hit. The head of the school tells them that Shin is hopelessly untalented in a very mean spirited way, and that Shin could enroll at the lowest level of the school, but it would a burdan on his staff on a waste like Shin. Misae responds by clugging a symbol to his ear, and tells him off. In the last scene, is Shin playing with his musical toys like he was at the beginning, this time Misae is playing with his musical toys as well. That is one of my favorites, it shows the possitive side of Shin and Misae's relationship, and we see a motherly side of Misae standing up for Shin, and see that even though Shin drives her nuts, she still loves him and will not tolerate anyone being mean to her son.\n\nTravia: Might explain why she gets along so well with Shin, Nanako's dream is to be a kindegarden teacher.\n\nHere is another idea for an episode that who knows may already excist, the episode would be called \"Shin's Rival\" another little boy meets and develops a crush on Nanako, this kid and Shin are in competition to impress Nanako and spent time with her. The kid could be 6 or 7 years old and Shin would have to deal with an older man, LOL Or the kid could be 3 or 4 years old and Shin would have to deal with a younger man, LOL. I think there is an episode called \"Shin's Rival\", about this young ninja kid has a crush on Nene or Penny as she known in FUNi, and thinks he has to defeat Shin to win Nene. It is really a one way rivalory because Shin doesn't even know there is a rivalory. I think it would be great if Shin had a true rival, and Nanako attention is the perfect motivation."
