        "text": "22/12/2016\n\nIn a rather surprising turn of events Nintendo have begun offering episodes of Shin-Chan for both Streaming and digital download via their Nintendo 3DS handheld.\n\nAt the time of writing three episodes are available to stream on the Nintendo Anime Channel, specifically Episode 8, Episode 10 and Episode 16; while the Video Section on the Nintendo 3DS eShop is offering 12 episodes for purchase with a further two episodes offered as a free download. The free episodes on the Nintendo 3DS eShop are Episode 8 and Episode 10 – the episodes which are free to stream on the Nintendo Anime Channel – while the remaining episodes, which are seperated into Volume 2 and Volume 3 with six episodes a piece, cost £1.79 per volume.\n\nThe bizarre aspect of this news is that the English Dub used within these episodes of Shin-Chan are completely different to the previous UNCUT FUNimation Dub, which was released on DVD and streamed on FUNimation, and the TV-Friendly Vielto Dub, which was shown on Fox Kids in both the US and UK. Instead the series features a completely brand new English Dub from an unknown company and, what’s even more interesting, is that the Japanese opening and ending animations are used and are left completely intact and uncut (which isn’t something Nintendo would usually allow seeing as you see some of the characters completely naked). Another bizarre aspect is that the episodes have been cropped (or zoomed in if you prefer) so you missed out on certain aspects of the show.\n\nGenerally it’s great to see more anime being released onto a ‘different-kind-of-service’ but it’s strange to see it handled in this kind of manner. In any event to those that wish to watch Shin-Chan they can do; but don’t expect great things from it as the English Dub is quite mediocre."
