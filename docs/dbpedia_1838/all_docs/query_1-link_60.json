        "text": "Muse Asia announced the screening of Crayon Shinchan the Movie: School Mystery! The Splendid Tenkasu Academy in Singapore. A fan’s screening is slated for September 4, while the general screening is set for September 9. Tickets sales at Golden Village cinemas began on August 26.\n\nAside from the screening, Muse Asia is teaming up with yogurt drink chain Yomie’s Rice x Yogurt and mineral water brand POLAR to promote the upcoming movie screening. Muse Asia’s Hakken! VivoCity outlet will feature the Crayon Shin-chan franchise, and photo backdrops can be found in Plaza Singapura. Posting a selfie with a Yomie’s Rice x Yogurt drink, taking photos with the backdrops, or buying POLAR mineral water nets fans a chance to win a pair of tickets to the fan’s screening.\n\nThe staff of Crayon Shinchan the Movie: School Mystery! The Splendid Tenkasu Academy includes Wataru Takahashi as director and Kimiko Ueno as scriptwriter. The two have been involved with the series for many years. The movie’s theme song is “Hashirigaki” by Macaroni Enpitsu, with a music video for the song released on April 22.\n\nCrayon Shin-chan the Movie: School Mystery! The Splendid Tenkasu Academy is the 29th movie in the Crayon Shin-chan series, which includes a still-ongoing TV series that began in 1992 and has over 1000 episodes as of 2021. The previous movie, Crayon Shin-chan: Crash! Rakuga Kingdom and Almost Four Heroes, was released in 2020. The TV anime and movies are based on the manga by Yoshito Usui.\n\nMuse Asia describes the series as:\n\nShinnosuke and his friends are experiencing a one-week stay as part of the “defense force” of Tenkatōitsu Kasukabe Private Academy (nicknamed “Tenkasu”), an elite boarding school that is administered by a state-of-the-art AI. But when Kazama is attacked, with his intelligence reduced, and strange bite marks left on his butt, the mood begins to change. The Kasukabe defense force joins forces with the school’s dropout student council president Chishio Atsuki to form a group of detectives and shed some light on the mystery.\n\nSource: Muse Asia"
