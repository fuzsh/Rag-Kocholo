The son, like Bart isn't the brightest bulb in the pack, but makes up for it with his clever antics and mischief-making. Shintaro knows just how to push the right buttons of the adults. Sometimes it's intentional, like embarassing his mother in public to get his way. Other times it is through misunderstanding. The humor of shin-chan is the mixture of childhood innocence, irreverant behavior, and gags. If you have ever been a parent or had younger siblings, you can relate.\n\nIf you enjoy comedy in the style of Yotsuba& with less wholsomeness and a ... bit more crassness, look no further. Unfortunately, most will never give this anime a chance due to the infamy of the Funimation release. Please do yourself a favor and avoid the funimation dub like the plague! It follows the Ghost Stories formula of tossing out the script because they think they can write better comedy *spoiler alert: they can't.* If you want a show that tries to be the next Family Guy knockoff written by unfunny hacks, choose the Funimation Dub. If you have any respect for the original work or comedy in general, go watch the fansub and never look back.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThe show's warmth and charm comes from the happiness of a normal family, and the unique personality of Shin-chan that you can't help but feel is charming.\n\nThe world is actually really well-built, populated by people of all sorts of quirks and charms, be it the head over heels couple or the library people who communicate with hand signs. The family -- too -- feels as if it could be your family, and the humour -- despite missing that rare time -- is filled with jokes that are just...you know you shouldn't be laughing at them at your age, but they're just so funny.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThe normal Shin Chan TV series is mainly for shits and giggles, and it does not really try and have a \"message\" or some deep moment. More mature themes and absolute brilliance of story-telling and character development is saved for Shin Chan Movies which there are like 30 of.\n\nI grew up on Shin Chan, Doraemon and such so I have my nostalgia biases circulating in my blood as I'm writing this review but I am absolutely certain that Crayon Shin Chan is worth a watch to at least get familiar with the characters so that you can watch the movies which are DEFINITELY worth ... your time.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNew Author To Succeed to Crayon Shin-chan Manga\n\nAccording to Nikkan Sports, the serialization of manga Crayon Shin-chan will be resumed next summer.
