        "text": "Crayon Shin-chan (Japanese: クレヨンしんちゃん Hepburn: Kureyon Shin-chan?), also known as Shin Chan, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. It follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke “Shin” Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture.\n\nDue to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009, as announced in a broadcast of the anime on October 16, 2009. Although the series formally ended on February 5, 2010, it was announced on December 1, 2009 that a new manga would begin in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui’s team,[3] titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん Shin Kureyon Shin-chan?).\n\nAn anime adaptation of the series began airing on TV Asahi in 1992 and is still ongoing. The show has now been dubbed in 30 languages,[4] has over 900 episodes and 24 full-length films.\n\nBasic information\n\nShin Chan decor in a mall, Hong Kong\n\nTrain in special Crayon Shin-chan vinyl wrapping livery at Kurihashi Station, Japan\n\nCrayon Shin-chan first appeared in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which is published by Futabasha. The anime Crayon Shin-chan has been on TV Asahi since April 13, 1992, and on several television networks, worldwide.\n\nMany of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan’s occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. In fact, some of them cannot be translated into other languages. In Japanese, certain set phrases almost always accompany certain actions; many of these phrases have standard responses. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for instance, saying “Welcome back” (“おかえりなさい” “okaeri nasai”) instead of a using a more suitable wording such as “I am home” (“ただいま” “Tadaima”) when he comes home. Another difficulty in translating arises from the use of onomatopoeic Japanese words. In scolding Shin-chan and attempting to educate him in proper behaviour his parent or tutor may use such a phrase to indicate the correct action. Often through misinterpreting such a phrase as a different, though similar-sounding phrase, or through interpreting it in one sense when another is intended, Shin-chan will embark on a course of action which, while it may be what he thinks is being requested of him, leads to bizarre acts which serve only to annoy his parents or tutors even more. This is not restricted to onomatopoeic words, since almost any word can become a source of confusion for Shin-chan, including English loanwords, such as mistaking “cool” for “pool” (“That’s pool!” or “Pu-ru da zo!” (“プールだぞ！”) for “That’s cool!”).\n\nSome other humorous themes which are repeated in the series are of a more universal nature, such as gags based on physical comedy (such as eating snow with chopsticks) or, as a child, unexpectedly using adult speech patterns or mannerisms. But even there, many of the gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his “Mr. Elephant” impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children’s song “Zou-san” (ぞうさん). Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) “Do you like green peppers?” (ピーマン好き?). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as “How many times did you go to the police?” to tough-looking men or “How old are you?” to elderly people.\n\nThe series works under a sliding timescale where the characters have maintained their ages throughout the course of the series. Though time has passed to allow for the rise and fall of several pop culture icons, marriages, pregnancies, and births of various characters, all the characters still maintain their age at the time of their introduction. For example, if the two major births in the series are taken into account (Shinnosuke’s sister, Himawari, and his kindergarten teacher’s child), Shinnosuke would be seven years old and in second grade, but he is not.\n\nYoshito Usui died on September 11, 2009 after a fall at Mount Arafune. After Usui died, Futabasha originally planned to end Crayon Shin-chan in November 2009. Upon discovering new manuscripts, Futabasha decided to extend the comic’s run until the March 2010 issue of the magazine, which shipped on February 5, 2010.[5]\n\nCharacters\n\nMain article: List of Crayon Shin-chan characters\n\nMedia\n\nManga\n\nComicsOne translated ten volumes of Crayon Shin-chan into English and released it in the United States. Occasional pop culture references familiar to Americans, such as Pokémon and Britney Spears, were added to increase the appeal to American audiences. The manga is mirrored from its original to read from left to right.[6] Starting with the sixth volume, many of the names were changed to the ones used in the Phuuz English version of the anime, even though the dub never aired in North America. This translation is rated Teen.[7]\n\nSince then, American publisher DrMaster took over the licenses of several manga series, including Crayon Shin-chan, from ComicsOne. No new volumes of Crayon Shin-chan were released under the DrMaster imprint.\n\nOn July 28, 2007, DC Comics’ manga division CMX announced the acquisition of the Crayon Shin-chan manga. The CMX version is rated Mature instead of Teen from ComicsOne, because of nudity, sexual humor, and bad language. The first volume was released on February 27, 2008, with uncensored art, and the style of jokes that frequent the Adult Swim dub with some throw backs to the original version, such as his original greeting. However, volume 10 omitted a gag which was in the ComicsOne version.\n\nOn April 11, 2012, One Peace Books announced their release of the manga, which is a reprint of the CMX version, in an omnibus format.[8] Three omnibus volumes were released simultaneously on October 15, 2012. Volume 4 was released on November 13, 2013 and included the Japanese volume 12, marking the first time that particular volume has an English translation.\n\nThe Crayon Shin-chan manga spin-off, Action Mask, is currently available as read-only/print-only subscription from Crunchyroll and Futabasha.[9] The main Shin-chan manga is also available from Crunchyroll using the CMX version, concurrently up to volume 9.[10]\n\nCrayon Shin-chan – Japanese original\n\nNo.\n\nRelease date\n\nISBN\n\n1\n\nApril 11, 1992[11]\n\nISBN 4-575-93292-2\n\n2\n\nJune 12, 1992[12]\n\nISBN 4-575-93298-1\n\n3\n\nAugust 8, 1992[13]\n\nISBN 4-575-93304-X\n\n4\n\nNovember 12, 1992[14]\n\nISBN 4-575-93316-3\n\n5\n\nMarch 12, 1993[15]\n\nISBN 4-575-93324-4\n\n6\n\nJuly 27, 1993[16]\n\nISBN 4-575-93340-6\n\n7\n\nDecember 9, 1993[17]\n\nISBN 4-575-93347-3\n\n8\n\nMarch 28, 1994[18]\n\nISBN 4-575-93358-9\n\n9\n\nJuly 26, 1994[19]\n\nISBN 4-575-93368-6\n\n10\n\nDecember 9, 1994[20]\n\nISBN 4-575-93377-5\n\n11\n\nApril 14, 1995[21]\n\nISBN 4-575-93391-0\n\n12\n\nJuly 18, 1995[22]\n\nISBN 4-575-93404-6\n\n13\n\nOctober 26, 1995[23]\n\nISBN 4-575-93419-4\n\n14\n\nMarch 22, 1996[24]\n\nISBN 4-575-93439-9\n\n15\n\nJuly 18, 1996[25]\n\nISBN 4-575-93457-7\n\n16\n\nDecember 6, 1996[26]\n\nISBN 4-575-93478-X\n\n17\n\nApril 15, 1997[27]\n\nISBN 4-575-93496-8\n\n18\n\nJuly 16, 1997[28]\n\nISBN 4-575-93511-5\n\n19\n\nDecember 12, 1997[29]\n\nISBN 4-575-93542-5\n\n20\n\nApril 17, 1998[30]\n\nISBN 4-575-93560-3\n\n21\n\nJuly 22, 1998[31]\n\nISBN 4-575-93576-X\n\n22\n\nDecember 8, 1998[32]\n\nISBN 4-575-93597-2\n\n23\n\nApril 8, 1999[33]\n\nISBN 4-575-93611-1\n\n24\n\nJuly 27, 1999[34]\n\nISBN 4-575-93634-0\n\n25\n\nDecember 8, 1999[35]\n\nISBN 4-575-93661-8\n\n26\n\nApril 13, 2000[36]\n\nISBN 4-575-93682-0\n\n27\n\nJuly 25, 2000[37]\n\nISBN 4-575-93703-7\n\n28\n\nDecember 8, 2000[38]\n\nISBN 4-575-93721-5\n\n29\n\nApril 18, 2001[39]\n\nISBN 4-575-93734-7\n\n30\n\nJuly 12, 2001[40]\n\nISBN 4-575-93746-0\n\n31\n\nDecember 14, 2001[41]\n\nISBN 4-575-93765-7\n\n32\n\nApril 10, 2002[42]\n\nISBN 4-575-93774-6\n\n33\n\nJuly 18, 2002[43]\n\nISBN 4-575-93792-4\n\n34\n\nDecember 12, 2002[44]\n\nISBN 4-575-93810-6\n\n35\n\nApril 17, 2003[45]\n\nISBN 4-575-93824-6\n\n36\n\nJuly 19, 2003[46]\n\nISBN 4-575-93841-6\n\n37\n\nDecember 12, 2003[47]\n\nISBN 4-575-93868-8\n\n38\n\nApril 15, 2004[48]\n\nISBN 4-575-93888-2\n\n39\n\nJuly 24, 2004[49]\n\nISBN 4-575-93898-X\n\n40\n\nDecember 18, 2004[50]\n\nISBN 4-575-93920-X\n\n41\n\nApril 15, 2005[51]\n\nISBN 4-575-93945-5\n\n42\n\nJuly 23, 2005[52]\n\nISBN 4-575-93959-5\n\n43\n\nDecember 16, 2005[53]\n\nISBN 4-575-93985-4\n\n44\n\nJuly 14, 2006[54]\n\nISBN 4-575-94020-8\n\n45\n\nDecember 8, 2006[55]\n\nISBN 4-575-94053-4\n\n46\n\nJuly 13, 2007[56]\n\nISBN 978-4-575-94110-4\n\n47\n\nDecember 14, 2007[57]\n\nISBN 978-4-575-94142-5\n\n48\n\nJuly 25, 2008[58]\n\nISBN 978-4-575-94182-1\n\n49\n\nJuly 17, 2009[59]\n\nISBN 978-4-575-94234-7\n\n50\n\nJuly 16, 2010[60]\n\nISBN 978-4-575-94289-7\n\nNew Crayon Shin-chan – Japanese original\n\nCrayon Shin-chan – English – ComicsOne\n\nNo.\n\nRelease date\n\nISBN\n\n1\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99194-2\n\n2\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99266-6\n\n3\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99267-3\n\n4\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99270-3\n\n5\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99268-0\n\n6\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99269-7\n\n7\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99271-0\n\n8\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99272-7\n\n9\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99273-4\n\n10\n\n04/04/2005\n\nISBN 978-1-588-99274-1\n\nCrayon Shin-chan – English – CMX\n\nNo.\n\nRelease date\n\nISBN\n\n1\n\n02/27/2008\n\nISBN 978-1-401-21715-0\n\n2\n\n05/13/2008\n\nISBN 978-1-401-21716-7\n\n3\n\n07/15/2008\n\nISBN 978-1-401-21774-7\n\n4\n\n09/02/2008\n\nISBN 978-1-401-21778-5\n\n5\n\n10/28/2008\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22025-9\n\n6\n\n12/30/2008\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22031-0\n\n7\n\n03/03/2009\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22110-2\n\n8\n\n04/28/2009\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22111-9\n\n9\n\n09/01/2009\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22098-3\n\n10\n\n01/19/2010\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22102-7\n\n11\n\n05/04/2010\n\nISBN 978-1-401-22101-0\n\nCrayon Shin-chan – English – One Peace Books (each book containing multiple volumes 1-12)\n\nNo.\n\nRelease date\n\nISBN\n\n1\n\nOctober 15, 2012\n\nISBN 978-1-935-54813-3\n\n2\n\nOctober 15, 2012\n\nISBN 978-1-935-54814-0\n\n3\n\nOctober 15, 2012\n\nISBN 978-1-935-54815-7\n\n4\n\nNovember 15, 2013\n\nISBN 978-1-935-54839-3\n\nAnime\n\nMain article: List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes\n\nAn anime adaptation of Crayon Shin-chan, produced by Shin-Ei Animation, has aired in Japan on TV Asahi since April 13, 1992. The series was originally directed by Mitsuru Hongo from 1992 to 1996, and was replaced by Keiichi Hara from 1996 to 2004. Since 2004, the series is directed by Yuji Muto. The music in the series is composed by Toshiyuki Arakawa. The series was originally going to end in 1994 and have its time-slot replaced by a remake of Umeboshi Denka. However, because the series was a huge hit on TV Asahi, the network decided not to replace it.[67]\n\nAn spin-off series called Crayon Shin-chan Gaiden consisting of three seasons is exclusively streaming on Amazon Prime Video worldwide with English and German subtitles.[68][69][70]\n\nAn English subtitled version of Crayon Shin-chan ran on KIKU in Hawaii from 1992 until December 2001[71] when Vitello Productions acquired the rights. The episodes were translated by Karlton Tomomitsu.[72]\n\nVitello and Phuuz dubs\n\nThe series was first dubbed into English by Vitello Productions in Burbank, California through 2001–2002. During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the United Kingdom, on Fox Kids in Australia and on RTÉ Two in the Republic of Ireland. RTÉ Two has not shown the series since 2003, and on Jetix UK, the series was eventually relegated to shorts in-between programs, with more edits. The dub is of American origin, with veteran voice actors such as Kath Soucie, Russi Taylor, Grey DeLisle, Pat Fraley, Eric Loomis and Anndi McAfee playing the characters. Soucie voiced Shin and Misae.\n\nMany characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones, the original background music was completely replaced with new background music, and scenes with nudity were edited to remove any signs of indecent exposure. Most adult jokes were re-made into family-friendly jokes, and the profanity was edited out. However, the frequent appearance of Shinnosuke’s naked buttocks, as well as humor relating to breast-size and sexual themes, remained in the finished product. Some episodes that displayed adult material and mature content were not dubbed at all. Additionally, the episodes were dubbed out of their original order which created continuity errors. For example, episode 29 shows Shin bringing his classmates to visit his newborn sister, episode 30 shows his sister coming home from her birth in the hospital and in episode 52 it was revealed that Shin was going to have a sister.\n\nIn 2003, phuuz entertainment inc. continued in similar style as the Vitello dub. But their episodes featured a new cast of voice artists (among others Diane Michelle, Julie Maddalena, Peter Doyle). The Phuuz dub was pitched to Adult Swim for an U.S. broadcast, but was rejected, as they felt that it was better suited to a younger audience.\n\n52 episodes have been produced of the Vitello dub and at least 78 episodes of the Phuuz dub. Vitello and Phuuz episodes lasted on an average 21 minutes and contained three segments of 5 to 7 minutes. Some of the dubs of the series, such as the German, Dutch, European Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, French and Latin American Spanish dub, used the Vitello dub as the source for the dubbing. The Dutch, French, German and European Portuguese dub also dubbed the Phuuz dub afterwards.\n\nFunimation dub\n\nFunimation acquired the Shin-chan North America license in 2006.[73] As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America.\n\nFunimation’s version features a Texas-based cast of voice actors. Funimation’s dub takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Similar to the Vitello dub, episodes of the series were dubbed out of their original order, and segments were reordered. Additionally, many characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones. Many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture were added. For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is Jessica Simpson (whose first album was not released until 1999) and which one is Ashlee Simpson (whose first album was not released until 2004), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference Rudy Giuliani and his unsuccessful bid for President.\n\nNew, previously non-existent backstories were created, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters. For instance, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as “Penny”) was suggested to be physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, and this was used as a source of black humor. Principal Enchou was rewritten as a half Romani, half Peruvian man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally injured scores of audience members. Yoshinaga-sensei (known in the dub as “Miss Polly”), Shinnosuke’s teacher, was rewritten as a kinky nymphomaniac, while Shin’s schoolmate, Kazama, (known in the dub as “Georgie”) was portrayed as an absurdly hawkish conservative.\n\nThe dub aired on Adult Swim. All three seasons, 26 episodes per season, have also been released on DVD. Season 3, released in 2011, culminated in the official finale, effectively ending the Funimation series.[74][75][76][77] Netflix streamed the series in the United States from April 6, 2011 until November 13, 2012. Seasons 1 and 2 are available for streaming on the US version of Hulu.[78] Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are available for streaming in the US on the streaming service of Funimation.\n\nLUK Internacional dub\n\nA fourth English dub of Crayon Shin-chan has been produced in Hong Kong by Red Angel Media in 2015[79] and was commissioned by LUK Internacional, the company that produces the Spanish, Portuguese, the second Italian and the second French dubs of Crayon Shin-chan and commissioned the Doraemon dub that aired on Boomerang UK. The dub was translated from LUK Internacional’s Spanish dub, which is close to the Japanese original and has no censorship. The first three volumes of the dub were released in the European and South African Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22, 2016,[80] and the fourth and fifth volumes were released on December 29, 2016.[81] The dub is separated into five volumes, with the first volume being free while the other four cost €1.99/£1.79. The first volume contains two episodes while the other four contain 6 episodes each which makes 14 episodes in total.[82][83][84][85][86]\n\nCrayon Shin-chan in other countries\n\nCrayon Shin-chan is also very popular in many other countries, especially East Asian countries where many of the jokes can be translated.\n\nThe Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium)\n\nThe series aired in the Netherlands from February 1, 2003 until August 25, 2007 on Fox Kids/Jetix and on Kanaal Twee in Flanders (Dutch part of Belgium) from September 1, 2003 until March 18, 2005. According to Shin-chan’s Dutch voice actress, the series was taken off the air in the Netherlands because of complaints by parents. Measured by ratings, Crayon Shin-chan was one of the most successful series ever aired by a Dutch children’s channel. The Dutch dub was produced by JPS Producties and based on the English Vitello and Phuuz dubs.\n\n18.991615 72.845484"
