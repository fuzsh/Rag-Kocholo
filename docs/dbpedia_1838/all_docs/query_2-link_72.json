        "text": "Shin-Chan\n\nShin is a 5-year-old boy who is constantly doing and saying inappropriate things, with hilarious results, much to the dismay and annoyance of those around him. Shin, along with his family, his friends from kindergarten, and some annoying neighbors, ends up turning every day situations into funny adventures.He is the main character, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. His affectionate name is Shin-chan.\n\nShinnosuke Nohara (野原 しんのすけ Nohara Shinnosuke?, Shin-Chan (phuuz))\n\nHe is 5 years old and loves chocolate biscuits, especially \"Chocobi\" and a TV superhero named \"Action Kamen\", but he absolutely hates green peppers. He is attracted to older girls and women, despite his young age, and pays no attention to girls of his own age. He brazenly pursues any girl who catches his eye.\n\nHe shares this trait with his father and paternal grandfather, but this often results in Mom's cruel punishment. The only girl he seems to really like is a college student named Nanako, around whom he becomes shy. Some of his strange activities include dressing up (often as an animal), mooning and drawing an elephant's face on his skin, using his penis as the trunk which he calls him \"Mr. Elephant\". He also makes trouble for others and then criticizes their efforts in covering for him. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever, which includes getting rid of his clothes at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIronically, there have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at various activities including kendo. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness (for example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, getting all wet and dirty in the process and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes.\n\nIn another episode, he gives Masao the change he has even though he knows that his mother will scold him later), but these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. There are also times when Shin Chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others, and in a few rare instances he shows that deep down he really does care for his family, despite his constant disrespect towards them.\n\nThis shows up more often than not in the feature length movies as compared to the regular series episodes. ComicsOne, the first publisher of the English manga, referred to Shin-chan as \"The Bart Simpson of Japan\n\nImpact On Children\n\nShin Chan plays extreme pranks in the cartoon. He flirts with his teachers and other ladies which is a wrong message portrayed in the cartoon. He talks with disrespect to some of his professors and elders. He denies to do any kind of work that his mom tells him to do and he is also shown as doing destructive pranks. All these things should not be done by children. Some people might argue saying that it is just a cartoon and the pranks shown in them should not be taken seriously and should be regarded as pure entertainment. But the only issue we have is children don’t understand that it is just a cartoon and they have a tendency to imitate whatever they see.\n\nIn my opinion, the makers of the cartoon can keep the concept as it is but just make it a little more sober and portray things that will help children in real life. They should give a deeper thought to the character and show Shin Chan doing good stuff so that the popularity of the cartoon is maintained and children imitate the right things in life and they do not get diverted.\n\nVoice: Miki Narahashi\n\nThe mother of the Nohara family from Kumamoto on the island of Kyūshū. She is 29 years old and a typical housewife of post-war Japan, she cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers, and lazes all to varying degrees of success. While at heart a caring and nurturing individual, her positive aspects are often offset by her many shortcomings. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children, she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight. She administers brutal physical and verbal punishment to her relatives, having little patience for their antics. Her famous and symbolic moves includes \"drilling\" others' head with her fists (known as \"guri-guri\") and a series of punches on the head, creating comically large lumps (the punches are mainly thrown by Misae, but other characters have been known to use it as well, such as Hiroshi and even Ne Ne). While she spends as little as possible on the less-essential needs of her husband and son, she loves to splurge on Himawari and herself, though she is noted to have instances of great generosity. Most of her luxury purchases, however, often end up broken, misused or otherwise ruined by her children, sometimes even before she had a chance to try them. She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week or even first day. She is prone to immediately partake in bargain sales when she sees them, thinking she is saving the family money. However, she buys in extreme quantities and also regardless of the uses, which defeats the purpose. Additionally, she secretly hoards money for her own personal use. She is also known to be a terrible driver. Misae also constantly checks Shin-chan's and Hiroshi's behavior around young women and punishes them accordingly (and always seems to be in the right place at the right time when it comes to the latter).\n\nHiroshi Nohara (野原 ひろし Nohara Hiroshi, Harry (phuuz))\n\nVoice: Keiji Fujiwara\n\nFather of the Nohara family from Akita in Northern Japan, and its sole source of income. He met Misae at the age of 29, and after dating for around a year the two wed. He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family bread-winner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. At age 35, he is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take home pay to his wife every month. While his relationship with his family is positive on the whole, there is an abundance of recurring conflict. He and his wife bicker on many different things, from how little he gets for spending money every month, to whose turn it is to give the baby a bath. Misae is also notorious for inflicting violence on Hiroshi whenever she gets very angry (usually when his gaze wanders to younger women). He often dreams about being a playboy while he sleeps as an escape, though this is usually interrupted by some external stimulation. He enjoys a playful relationship with his children; but sometimes they're the source of his daily woes. He loves a cold beer after work and shares Shin-chan's appreciation of TV shows with young women in skimpy clothing, often getting too excited about it for Misae's liking. He will not hesitate to save his allowance for things he wants, but can be seen spending much of it to buy his family creature comforts. A running joke is made of the pungent odor of his feet and his socks are often used as weapons by other members of the family.\n\nHimawari Nohara (野原 ひまわり Nohara Himawari, Daisy (phuuz))\n\nVoice: Satomi Kōrogi\n\nThe youngest child of the Nohara family, born in 1996. A precocious and vibrant infant. While technically newborn, her character has matured and grown more intelligent during her stay in the series. She possess a palpable lust for shiny objects (jewels and precious metals) and brand-name goods, being able to discern a real jewel from a simple piece of imitation (and throwing away the latter). She emulates her mother in her utterly stubborn pursuit of handsome young men who catch her eye, not unlike her brother, who soon discovered that a way to pacify her was to put on a cutout mask of a known handsome actor. In her family, she is an icon of adoration and annoyance, causing trouble she cannot be blamed for given her infantile innocence. She can be extremely fast crawling, tiring out even Shin-chan, and often uses Shiro as a toy. Her name, which is Japanese for \"sunflower\", was chosen by the show's viewership and not the creator.\n\nShiro(シロ Shiro, Lucky (phuuz))\n\nVoice: Mari Mashiba\n\nA white, fluffy pup Shin-chan found in a cardboard box early in the series. While a beloved member of the family, he is the subject of neglect thanks to his owner's forgetfulness and short attention-span. He is a very intelligent dog, often presenting logic and intellect that surpasses his human owners, making him ironically the most \"normal\". As his meals from the Noharas are at best inconsistent, he has developed a talent for foraging, though other times he has to eat Misae's failed culinary experiments. An oddly human-like dog, he is very responsible and painstakingly careful. He takes care of his owners diligently, though often they do not realize his help or understand what he is trying to show them. His doghouse also often ends up becoming a place for Shin-chan to hide himself or something he doesn't want his family to find, and several times ends up being occupied by other creatures and even destroyed. He often plays protector to Himawari, more often than not sacrificing his well being in the process.\n\nShinchan in other countries\n\nCrayon Shin-chan is also very popular in many other countries, especially East Asian countries where many of the jokes can be translated.\n\nIndia\n\nShin Chan Cuppies\n\nWallpapers of Shin Chan"
