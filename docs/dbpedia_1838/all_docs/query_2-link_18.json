        "text": "Okay Golden Geek what are you talking about \"last season\" since last I checked, Crayon Shin Chan is still AIRING In Japan and like the Simpsons is still going with new episodes every year. I know the Manga ended but the anime didn't so for the show there still really isn't a \"last season\" as of now as in \"something to signify the show is over\" because you know it's NOT OVER.\n\nHonestly the reason the dub ended is because well it just couldn't do large enough numbers to jusitfy it continuing on Adult Swim. I mean it didn't do terribly but keep in mind Shin Chan was one of the last series they really tried promoting weekly daily episodes for an anime instead of just you know the Saturday anime slot and were putting it on between reruns of Family Guy and Aqua Teen where it wasn't performing at a high enough number to keep jusitfying doing especially since due to writing style of how they had to make Shin Chan in order to make the comedy make sense as originally a lot of Shin Chan would be otherwise unrelatable puns for a western audience, so yeah it was decided just to end the dub of it. Sub wise the anime still airs in Japan but yeah doubt we'll ever see a full dub of all the episodes ever come to this country.\n\nOkay Golden Geek what are you talking about \"last season\" since last I checked, Crayon Shin Chan is still AIRING In Japan and like the Simpsons is still going with new episodes every year.
