        "text": "Wait a minute I always thought this show was for VERY young children. Why is it airing on Adult Swim if its supposedly aimed at the Sesame Street crowd?\n\nDid it occur to you that maybe because of its content it isn't intended for the \"Sesame Street crowd\"?\n\nThose poor bunnies. They need to get huggled badly.\n\n\"Smack the bunny\" just sounded so much like a masturbation euphemism, it made me laugh.\n\nYeah. Pink and pussy don't go together so well on an animated show. >_>;\n\nAww, c'mon Edo. Leave Billy's pink pussycat Milkshakes alone.\n\nTo be quite honest, I can't stand Shin's US dub voice.\n\nOddly enough, when I was in Spain, they had dubbed Shin-chan too...but they aired it during the children's programing and it was unedited as well(and I liked the Spanish dub Shin better...)....of course, they also aired \"Twelve Kingdoms\" during the children's programing block too.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like was uncensoring Shin's dick in that ep. You think I'd be used to seeing it in an animé by now, but my female instinct says otherwise.X(\n\nChameleon Shin ftw, though. Very innovative use of a bra(for a perverted 5 year old), but how can he see where he's going w/out punching eyeholes?\n\nI saw this thread and decided to give Shin-chan a chance, and it is easily one of the funnier animes I've seen. I'm super stressed out right now and it just cheered me up so much because I was laughing so hard. Someone seriously needs to make an animated GIF out of the a**-dance. I know it's immature, but it seriously makes me laugh enough to terrify my poor roomate.\n\nAnd I love Ench-Man having the Antonio Banderas-esque voice....but is it true they might be cancelling it?\n\nI think it is incredibly *******ized. Its OK but definately not worth pushing away better anime series. I enjoyed watching Inuyasha at 12:30 even if they were reruns and it is an overrated series but way better than Shin-Chan. I was looking forward to reruns of Eureka Seven on Thursdays but ever since it appeared on the schedule it was not only taken off for weekdays it was pushed back into 1:00 AM on Saturdays. I'm glad that it will be taken off and I will be able to enjoy an hour and a half of good anime (Trinity Blood, Bleach, Eureka Seven).\n\nYeah, back on Starmen we've been talking about the dub. I don't know how many times Tomato (Clyde Mandelin) just smiles and nods everytime he goes uncredited, but apparently he stated that he translated the scripts for this show (even though I didn't see his name in the credits). Evan Dorkin and Sarah Dyer punched up the translation though.\n\nHe also noted that Shin-chan was a test dub and we should write Funimation and Adult Swim to see more.\n\nY'know, we can see the \"Pink Pussy[cat]\" clip uncensored right? Rules say I can't post the link though."
