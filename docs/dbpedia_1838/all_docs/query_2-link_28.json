It follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke “Shin” Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbors, and friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture. An anime adaptation of the series began airing on TV Asahi in 1992, and continues to this day.\n\nDue to the death of author Usui, the manga in its current form ended on September 11, 2009, as announced in a broadcast of the anime on October 16, 2009. Although the series formally ended on February 5, 2010, it was announced on December 1, 2009 that a new manga would begin in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui’s team.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Basic information\n\n2 Characters\n\n3 Media\n\n3.1 Manga\n\n3.2 Anime\n\n3.3 Distribution\n\n4 Shin-chan in other countries\n\n4.1 Spain\n\n4.2 South Korea\n\n4.3 Mainland China\n\n4.4 Taiwan\n\n4.5 Vietnam\n\n4.6 Thailand\n\n4.7 Indonesia\n\n4.8 India\n\n4.9 Malaysia\n\n4.10 Philippines\n\n4.11 Latin America\n\n5 Theme songs\n\n5.1 Opening themes\n\n5.2 Ending themes\n\n6 Video games\n\n7 Movies\n\n8 References\n\n9 Further reading\n\n10 External links\n\nBasic information\n\nCrayon Shin-chan first appeared in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which is published by Futabasha. The anime Crayon Shin-chan has been on TV Asahi since April 13, 1992, and on several television networks, worldwide.\n\nMany of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan’s occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his inappropriate behavior. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. In fact, some of them cannot be translated into other languages. In Japanese, certain set phrases almost always accompany certain actions; many of these phrases have standard responses. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for example, saying “Welcome back!” (“おかえりなさい” “okaeri nasai”) instead of “I’m home!” (“ただいま” “Tadaima”) when he comes home. Another difficulty in translation arises from the use of onomatopoeic Japanese words. In scolding Shin-chan and attempting to educate him in proper behaviour his parent or tutor may use such a phrase to indicate the correct action. Often through misinterpreting such a phrase as a different, though similar sounding phrase, or through interpreting it in one sense when another is intended, Shin-chan will embark on a course of action which, while it may be what he thinks is being requested of him, leads to bizarre acts which serve only to vex his parents or tutors even more. This is not restricted to onomatopoeic words, since almost any word can become a source of confusion for Shin-chan, including English loan-words, such as mistaking “cool” for “pool” (“That’s pool!” or “Pu-ru da zo!” (“プールだぞ！”) for “That’s cool!”).\n\nSome other humorous themes which are repeated in the series are of a more universal nature, such as gags based on physical comedy (such as eating snow with chopsticks) or, as a child, unexpectedly using adult speech patterns or mannerisms. But even there, many of the gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his infamous “Mr. Elephant” impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it references the popular Japanese children’s song “Zou-san” (ぞうさん). Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) “Do you like green peppers?” (ピーマン好き?). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults asking such questions as “How many people have you killed?” to tough looking men or, “When are you going to die?” to elderly people.\n\nDuring the beginning of the series; the TV show was mostly based on the storyline in the original manga. As the show progressed, more and more episodes became anime-original. The show works under a sliding timescale where the characters have maintained their ages throughout the course of the show. Though time has passed to allow for the rise and fall of several pop culture icons, marriages, pregnancies, and births of various characters, all the characters still maintain their age at the time of their introduction. For example, if the two major births in the series are taken into account (Shinnosuke’s sister and his kindergarten teacher’s child), Shinnosuke would be seven years old and in second grade, but he is not.\n\nYoshito Usui died on September 11, 2009 after a fall at Mount Arafune. After Usui died, Futabasha originally planned to end Crayon Shin-chan in November 2009. Upon discovery of new manuscripts, Futabasha decided to extend the comic’s run until the March 2010 issue of the magazine, which shipped on February 5, 2010.[2]\n\nCharacters\n\nMedia\n\nManga\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. (February 2009)\n\nComicsOne has translated ten volumes of Shin-chan into English and released it in the United States. Occasional pop culture references familiar to Americans, such as Pokémon and Britney Spears, who has been known to be a fan of the series herself, were added to increase the appeal to American audiences. The manga is mirrored from its original to read from left to right.[3] Starting with the sixth volume, many of the names were changed to the ones used in the Phuuz English version of the anime, even though the anime never appeared in North America. This translation is rated Teen.[citation needed]\n\nSince then, American publisher DrMaster took over the licenses of several manga series, including Crayon Shin-chan, from ComicsOne. No new volumes of Crayon Shin-chan were released under the DrMaster imprint.\n\nOn July 28, 2007, DC Comics’ manga division CMX announced the acquisition of the Crayon Shin-chan manga. The CMX version is rated Mature instead of Teen from ComicsOne, because of nudity, sexual humor, and bad language. The first volume was released on February 27, 2008, with uncensored art, and the style of jokes that frequent the Adult Swim dub with some throw backs to the original version, such as his original greeting. However, volume 10 omitted a gag which was in the Comics 1 version.\n\nOn April 11, 2012, One Peace Books announced their release of three volumes of the manga on October 15, 2012. The One Peace Books version is released as three-volumes-in-one books rather than individual volumes.\n\nAnime\n\nAn English subtitled version of Crayon Shin-chan ran on KIKU-TV in Hawaii from April 1, 1992 through December 1, 2001. Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim airs it occasionally on their anime lineup, now known as a refurbished version of Toonami. An English dubbed version is also available on Netflix.[4]\n\nDistribution\n\nThis section does not cite any references or sources.

(March 2010)\n\nThe Shin-chan anime had an English dub produced by Vitello Productions in Burbank, California in 2002. The dub, with character names changed, ran on Fox Kids (now Disney XD) in the United Kingdom, and on RTÉ Two in the Republic of Ireland in the early 2000s. The dub is of American origin, with actors and actresses such as Kath Soucie, Russi Taylor, Grey DeLisle, and Pat Fraley playing major roles (Soucie plays Shin himself, and his mother). Despite the American origin, this dub was never licensed in North America. The dub is edited for content to some extent, but many scenes—including the frequent appearance of Shin’s naked buttocks, humor relating to breast-size, transsexualism and other sexual concepts—remain in the finished product. RTÉ Two has not shown the series since 2003, and Jetix only usually shows it as shorts in between programs, with more edits. Vitello’s dub was succeeded by Phuuz Entertainment Inc. in 2003, which featured a new cast of voice artists. The Phuuz dub was at one point pitched to Adult Swim, but the network passed on it, feeling it was more aimed at a kid audience.\n\nFUNimation Entertainment acquired the license for the Shin-chan anime in the US as of 2005.[5] As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America. The new dub received a month-long test run on Adult Swim. During this time, only the first six dubbed episodes were aired. Season 1 returned to Adult Swim on April 9, 2007, at a 12:30 am EDT time-slot.[6]\n\nThe new dub features a Texas-based cast of voice actors, and English scripts written by television writers Jared Hedges, Joel Bergen, Alex Muniz, and a few part-time writers. Comic and television writers Evan Dorkin and Sarah Dyer also contributed to the early scripts (episodes 1-6 and 8) for polish/punch-up. The dub is directed by Zach Bolton, and occasionally Laura Bailey.\n\nFUNimation’s dubbing of “Shin Chan” takes many liberties with the source material. Since most episodes do not feature extensive continuity, FUNimation has chosen to take advantage of this by producing episodes of the series out of their original order. As a result, characters such as Ai are introduced much earlier than in the series’ original Japanese run.\n\nThe FUNimation dub is adult-oriented, with many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture, the latter of which makes the series appear to be set in the “present day” (2006), rather than in 1992 (the year the series was first broadcast in Japan). For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is Jessica Simpson (whose first album was not released until 1999) and which one is Ashlee Simpson (whose first album was not released until 2004), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference Rudy Giuliani and his unsuccessful bid for President.\n\nThe show also created new, previously non-existent backstories, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters, including, but not limited to, Penny Milfer’s father (who has yet to appear in the series) being physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, a running gag that the show uses for black humor. The Principal of Shin’s school (“Super Happy Fun Time American School” in the dub) has also been substantially changed, becoming a half gypsy, half Peruvian man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally killed/castrasted scores of audience members. Miss Polly, one of the teachers, has been rewritten as a kinky nymphomaniac, while Shin’s schoolmate Georgie (Kazama in Japanese) has been turned into an absurdly hawkish conservative.\n\nThe use of modern American pop culture references to a show otherwise dated by the times was also used in Geneon’s dub of the Lupin the 3rd 1977 series. Most episodes of the American dub have received a rating of TV-14, for its relatively strong suggestive dialogue (D) and coarse language (L). However, some episodes are rated TV-MA for more offensive language, stronger sexual dialogue, and objectionable humor/content deemed too strong for a TV-14 rating. Outlines of the episodes used by FUNimation can be found online.[7]\n\nPrior to August 1, 2009, FUNimation episodes were streamed online weekly at Adult Swim’s free broadband service, Adult Swim Video. Also, the tenth episode that was dubbed used to be available at AdultSwim.com for free as an interactive video. In addition to watching the episode, one could watch video commentary from the FUNimation staff, booth recordings, script comparisons, bios, show artwork, and other special features. This feature however, has since been removed from the website.\n\nThe first thirteen episodes were released on DVD May 13, 2008, by FUNimation Home Entertainment. Season 2 began airing on Adult Swim on April 12, 2008. While initially airing at 1:30-2:00 am ET/PT, it was later moved to 11:00-11:30 pm ET/PT. However, this only lasted for two weeks, after which the show was pushed back to the midnight slot on August 9, 2008. After the September 6th airing, the show was removed from the broadcast schedule with six episodes of the season remaining, which were still shown on Adult Swim Video as online exclusives. As of November 8, 2008, reruns of the program aired on Sunday nights at 2:30 am ET/PT, but was later pushed to 2am on January 18, 2009.[citation needed]\n\nAccording to the Adult Swim message board, Adult Swim no longer has the broadcast rights to the show as of August 1, 2009, with the episodes no longer viewable on Adult Swim Video, and the show’s subforum on the Adult Swim message board has been removed. A small selection of episodes can still be viewed for free on FUNimation’s Video site.[8]\n\nIn the spring of 2011, FUNimation announced that new episodes of the dub would resume that July with a DVD release.[9] The first of the season 3 episodes debuted on the Hulu website on May 27, 2011,[10] to be followed by the Season 3 Part 1 DVD release, which was released on July 26, 2011[11] and Season 3 Part 2 DVD, which was released on September 27, 2011.[12] Seasons 1 and 2 are available for streaming on Netflix and Hulu.\n\nSeason 3 culminated in the official finale, effectively ending the FUNimation series.\n\nShin-chan in other countries\n\nCrayon Shin-chan is also very popular in many other countries, especially East Asian countries where many of the jokes can be translated.\n\nSpain\n\nShin-chan found a devoted following in Spain since 2001 it appeared on TV3. The show was also later broadcasted on Cartoon Network, Antena 3 and several other channels in four different languages: Basque, Catalan, Galician and Spanish. The show is completely uncensored. Additionally many food products use Shin Chan on the product packaging. It has proved so successful that several Shin-chan movies have been a theatrical released nationally.\n\nDespite its success, some TV channels have had to move the show to night programming or drop it completely after complaints by parents associations who claimed Shin-chan was not appropriate for children. Yoshito Usui visited Barcelona in 2004 in order to promote the Spanish release of the manga, when the show was already airing on Catalonia’s public television channel TV3. Usui was so impressed by Shin-chan’s popularity he decided to thank his Spanish followers by making an episode that takes place in Barcelona.[13]\n\nSpain is the only country outside Japan where a Game Boy Advance game based in the character was released (in 2005 by publisher Atari), with a sequel which was expected to follow in Q3 2006.\n\nAs of August 2012, Shin-chan is still aired in the national channel Antena Neox, which has broadcasted almost 700 episodes.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIn South Korea, the show and comics, titled 짱구는 못말려 (Jjanggu the Unhelpable), are also tremendously popular.[citation needed] Shin-chan’s name is changed into “Shin Jjanggu” (신짱구), which is coined by his original Japanese name and the Korean word “jjanggu” (짱구) for “protruding forehead.” In Korea, the animated version is severely censored compared to the original Japanese version.\n\nMost South Koreans consider it a kids’ cartoon, since many toys and website games there center around 짱구 and is represented as an icon for childish fun there. Scenes revealing Shin-Chan’s genitals are mostly censored, with the exception of a few scenes in which exposure is inevitable, and only few scenes with his buttocks shown remain. Some episodes explicitly displaying adult material are censored, and all mature-themed jokes in the original Japanese version are dubbed into rated-G jokes in Korean to make the series more suitable for children, who were considered the main audience for the show in Korea.[14] However, the comic book version is mostly uncensored, labeled as “for 19 or above.” Now, the new versions of Crayon Shin Chan in Korea are for ages 12 and up.\n\nMainland China\n\nIn China, the show and title “La bi Xiao xin” (蜡笔小新 -lit. “Crayon Xiao xin”, with “xin’ pronounced as “shin”) can be viewed on local channels mostly uncensored and well translated. Despite the fact that legal DVD sets and comics are published, most manga/videos bought in China are counterfeits as with Shin-chan merchandise. Shin-chan merchandise is especially popular among teenagers who often have them as accessories.[citation needed]\n\nTaiwan\n\nIn the Taiwan area, the publisher of Crayon Shin-chan is Tong Li Comics. A Chinese subtitled version of Crayon Shin-chan in Japanese premiered in Taiwan on ETTV on April 13, 1992\n\nVietnam\n\nIn Vietnam, the series’ first 6 books were released in July and August 2006. However, “Crayon Shin-chan” received bad reactions from Vietnamese media due to impertinent and sexual content.[15] Even VTV criticized the series on its main news program. Due to intense public pressure, Kim Dong publisher stopped releasing the series.[16] In December 2011, Kim Dong re-published the series with careful editing and age restriction.[17]\n\nThailand\n\nIn Thailand, they call him “Chin Jung”. Jung is usually used for Chan, when explaining a Japanese character.\n\nIndonesia\n\nShin-chan is one of the most popular anime characters in Indonesia. The anime itself was extremely popular yet controversial. It is the first animated show to have a “BO” rating, then “R-BO” rating (an Indonesian equivalent to the United States rating “PG”). The Comics are published by Indorestu Pasific (Mirrored) and Elex Media Komputindo (Official).\n\nIndia\n\nShin Chan was first broadcast on Hungama TV in 2006, dubbed in Hindi language. It is also dubbed in Tamil and Telugu. Local English dubs are also available for new episodes. The songs that Shin Chan sings are changed into parodies of popular Bollywood hits.\n\nDue to controversy over the behavior, style and attitude towards elders exhibited in the show, the Parents and Teachers Association complained about it claiming that Shin Chan is a bad role model for kids.[18] The show was banned in October 2008 by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India) on account of heavy nudity & profanity.[19] Before the ban, the Hindi version of Shin-chan gained up to 50-60% market share.[20] After many requests from the fans, the Censor boards re-examined and heavily edited the nude scenes and profanity and restarted broadcasting on 27 March 2009.[citation needed] All the mature theme jokes were translated into childish ones. The alcohol his father consumed was edited and said as “juice”.\n\nShin Chan films are also aired in India on Hungama TV; Treasures Of Buri Buri Kingdom (October 2009), Action Kamen vs Higure Rakshas (August 2010), Shinchan in Bungle in the Jungle (April 2011 theatre; May 2011 TV), Shinchan in Adventures in Henderland (December 2011) and the latest Shin chan in Dark Tama Tama thrilling chase (June 17, 2012).While More than 800 episode’s are aired in India. It’s Second Country after Japan to air New Series of Shinchan.\n\nMalaysia\n\nIn Malaysia, Shin-chan’s comic is titled as “Dik Cerdas”, which roughly means “brilliant kid” or “active kid”. Shin-chan’s voice in the Malay language version of the anime is voiced by a 15-year-old. Like in South Korea, pictures revealing Shin-Chan’s genitals were all censored by cutting the scenes. Mandarin versions that also shown in Malaysia however, are not as heavily censored.[21]\n\nCrayon Shin-Chan related merchandises are sold here especially for apparels. There has been a long history on the production of Shin-chan T-shirts, Polo Tees, Pants, socks and other apparel products. The current license of Crayon Shin-chan apparels is held under Multiple Premium Sdn. Bhd. (938039-v). A popular exclusive Crayon Shin-chan boutique is located at Sungai Wang Plaza, Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nPhilippines\n\nThis show was broadcast in the Philippines, uncensored and dubbed in Filipino. Shin-chan was voiced by Andrew E., a multi-platinum awarded, movie actor, rapper, very well known for his suggestive lyrics. His mother is called “Carmen”, his father was called “Bert”, and his dog was named “Puti”, which means white.\n\nAnother version featured a different voice actor (currently unknown) for Shin-chan, and contained jokes pertaining to Taglish.\n\nLatin America\n\nIn Latin America, Shin-chan was originally shown on Fox Kids / JETIX in 2003, but was later moved to a new channel at the time, Animax, in mid-2005. There, the episodes are shown weekdays, 3 to 4 times a day, and are dubbed over the English edited versions of the anime.\n\nTheme songs\n\nThis section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia’s quality standards.
