        "text": "Biggest fan of Crayon Shinchan series.There are a few storys behind Crayon Shinchan.\n\nPlease don’t believe in rumors on Social Media.\n\nI would like to clarify that the story circulating on social media regarding the inspiration of Crayon Shin-chan series is just a false rumor. It is not true.\n\nI’ve been a big fan of the series ever since I first saw it on TV. I have seen all movies, read all mangas and seen almost all episodes in the original version. I have even read critics and reviews from Japan.\n\nThe original author Yoshito Usui before beginning his career as a mangaka worked at a shop called Darakuya store. The founder and owner of the store was Shinnosuke Nikaidō. In 1987, he started his mangaka career by creating a manga called “Darakuya Store Monogatari” inspired by his experiences, which got published in the magazine Weekly Manga Action. Shinnosuke Nikaidō was one of it’s characters and the manga depicted his growing up from a boy to becoming the store owner. The then editor in charge, Katsuyuki Hayashi, suggested Usui that if they make this character as the protagonist of another manga, it would be interesting. In 1990, the manga Crayon Shin-chan appeared in the Weekly Manga Action as a spin-off to Darakuya Store Monogatari. The 7th August 2007 edition of Weekly Manga Action contained a segment Kureyon Shinchan Tanjou Hiwa ( Crayon Shinchan Birth Secret Story) where it was specified that the model person of Shinnosuke Nohara was Shinnosuke Nikaidō.\n\nYoshito Usui created the manga Crayon Shin-chan as he wanted to depict how he was as a child as well as the things he wanted to do as a child but couldn’t. He wanted to be a child with an “adult’s” view. He wanted to express his thoughts through a manga and he thus made Shinnosuke, a character who questions the general norms of the society and the things imposed by adults on children. He also wanted to create a series based on daily life, without any supernatural elements or gadgets or ninjas/samurais, etc. One can relate the series to one’s own life.\n\nThe word “Crayon” was added because Crayon is a popular tool used by Kindergartenners and Shinnosuke is one. This is the original explanation given by the author.\n\nYou can sense the uniqueness which the series has. It has been said by a person from the manga publisher that the series was originally meant for men in their late 30s. That was way back in 1990. But it gradually became popular among youth and children too, so they had to make it more family oriented later.\n\nIn 2005, the Nohara family was declared as permanent residents of Kasukabe city by the government.\n\n2009, Yoshito Usui died in a mountain trekking accident. It is rumored that Usui was depressed and committed suicide.\n\nIn 2010, the former chief editor of Weekly Manga Action said in an interview that as a sign of respect to the late Usui, he and other staff would continue the legacy of Usui into the future through anime, manga and film.\n\nIn 2012, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the anime series, it was said that the series (both anime & manga) would continue as long as the voice actors and manga artists of UY studios are alive.\n\nAs of December 2016, Crayon Shinchan has aired 917 episodes on TV Asahi. Futabasha has published 50 volumes of Crayon Shinchan and 6 volumes of Shin Crayon Shinchan, and many others including movie comics and junior-ban series of Shinchan.\n\nIn August 2016, Amazon prime video Japan started a spin off series . The first, “Alien vs Shinnosuke” aired till October with 13 episodes. The next series “Omocha wars”, started in November 2016.\n\nIn 2016, the series celebrates its 25th anniversary. A special website クレヨンしんちゃん 25周年プロジェクト was created. Even a bus and a train with Crayon Shinchan drawings are being operated specially this year. For regular updates, follow their official Twitter handle @crayon_official .\n\nExamples to show that Shinchan and Himawari would be alive:\n\nThe 2010 movie, “Arashi wo yobu! Ora no Hanayome” (Call the storm! My bride). In this movie we can clearly see the future of Shinnosuke, his family and friends. We could see his old parents living same house, slightly broken. We could see adult Himawari, tall and riding a bike. We also saw Tamiko, who is Shinnosuke’s future bride.\n\nThe presence of Shinko-chan. Apparently this girl has arrived from the future and it’s hinted in the episodes that she’s 5 Himawari herself who is 5 years old, given that she has tried to call Shinnosuke as “Onii-chan” (elder brother) , but quickly changes it to “Onigiri” (rice balls). She also advised Shinnosuke to stop being naughty and also advised to take care of Himawari. Even if Shinko maybe somebody else, it still shows that Shinnosuke has a future.\n\nSo, in short:\n\nShinnosuke Nohara was not any real person.\n\nShinchan, the character, never dies. Neither do the family, friends & acquaintances.\n\nShinchan series is continuing in all forms.\n\nThe story circulating on social media is fake.\n\nThank You for your patience.\n\nSome people are citing an article published on Rocket News, which is – Enter the dark world of anime and manga urban legends .\n\nThis article has clearly stated in bold letters that: “Remember, most of these are not facts, just theories.”\n\nAlso, “Urban Legends” are not facts, they are fanfiction.\n\nSo anyone who still believes in false stories should at least check one’s language comprehension skills first.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI have some quotes from official interviews.\n\n“Before Crayon Shinchan, there was a manga called Darakuya Store Monogatari. Crayon Shinchan is actually a spinoff from one of its characters. Usui and I decided to turn one of it’s characters into an original manga”. — Katsuyuki Hayashi, managing director of Futaba Publishers.\n\n“The character of Shinnosuke is based on the child I want to be.” — Yoshito Usui, original creator of Crayon Shinchan.\n\n“For 20 years, the late Usui dedicated himself to Crayon Shinchan. I believe there were difficult times too. Along with other staff, I want to carry his legacy into the future through manga, anime and film.” — Kenji Honda, former chief editor of Weekly Manga Action, when asked what would happen to the series after the demise of Yoshito Usui.\n\n“In a culture of respecting elders, Shinchan is a symbolic child who challenges the lies and covers of adult society. (…) The Shinnosuke character must have been made by carefully observing boys age around five.” — Tsunehiro Uno, manga critic and Shinchan expert.\n\n“It’s like having a conversation with my own family. I often take hints from interaction with my daughter and reflect them in Crayon Shinchan. So the anime contains a lot of real life experiences.” — Yuji Muto, animation director at Shin-Ei animations.\n\nOverview :\n\nLaugh to hide your tears… He’s rude. He’s crass. He’s unbelievably obnoxious and he likes showing his @$$. He’s Shin, and he’s the star of this train wreck. From superhero sell-outs, hotties and half-tards to bunny abuse and dirty old men, Shin chan’s packed with sweet dead piggy goodness.\n\nJust because an anime features a young protagonist does not necessarily mean that it is an appropriate series to show your children. Young Shinnosuke, or Shin-chan for short, is a very creative young boy that lives with his eccentric parents, Misae and Hiroshi, as well as his Prima Donna younger sister, Himawari, and has loads of unique friends to boot.\n\nEveryday life for little Shin-chan is full of funny (and shocking) moments, most of which stem from his unnatural and sometimes profane use of language, as well as his constant acts of inappropriate behavior. Shin-chan’s famous “elephant” gag is one of the most defining moments in Crayon Shin-chan, simply because it is the epitome of crude comedy, one of the core themes of the series.\n\nCrayon Shin-chan is a hilarious show about the day in the life of a young, curious boy, that captures the awkwardness of growing up as well as the beauty of being true to one’s self, no matter what others say.\n\n2.You might just cry after knowing the story that I came across on a blog. I am assuming this theory is true and sharing it with all you Shin Chan lovers\n\nWe all love Shin Chan for his brazen replies, witty retorts and for his flirting style. That typical sound (OOOOOoooo) till date, brings a child-like happiness to our face. Although our parents used to hate us for watching Shin Chan, but just like us, even they felt the same excitement. Everything related to Shin Chan will forever be etched in our hearts.\n\nBut behind that naughty, jolly kid, there is a shocking, real-life story of a Japanese family that has never been explained on any television channel.\n\nThe story is that of Misae and her family. Her family consisted of her husband, her kids Shin Chan, Himawaari and their cute little pet Shiro. One day, Shin Chan and Himawari went to the market with their parents for their usual grocery shopping.\n\nSuddenly, Shin Chan observed that his little sister Himawari was crossing the street without any assistance. He ran in order to rescue her. But unfortunately, they met with an accident and died.\n\nMisae got very depressed after this incident. So, she began depicting the lives of her kids on a scrap-book with crayon. That’s also the reason why this show is called ‘Crayon Shin Chan’\n\nShe used to imagine how her son and daughter would have been had they been alive.\n\nThis story inspired Yoshita Usui (the illustrator of the serial) so much that he decided to create an anime by the name Crayon Shin Chan.\n\nYes, all of those sassy, light-hearted moments that we saw on the television were actually the creations of Shin Chan’s mother.\n\nAnd the makers never wanted to air the last episode because they did not want the naughty image of Shin-Chan to be diluted. The episode featured Shin Chan’s accident.\n\nAll in all, the story that made us laugh so hard is actually the result of a tragic incident.\n\nRIP Shin Chan and thank you Misae\n\nCrayon Shinchan has a real model person, who was a president of Daraku-ya Shinnosuke Nikaido, Yoshito Usui first comic strip Daraku-ya store story 3 volumes.\n\nYoshito Usui died (accident, killed or kill himself) September 11th 2009"
