We've had it dubbed in Spain since I was 15, I think. Not much of a plot, but you laugh a lot.\n\nAlso, if someone's curious, the films are very interesting. While their main target are children, adults will find a few gags directed to them.\n\nUnknown Neo\n\nYou got in\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nSep 10, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n13,070\n\nAge\n\n40\n\nLocation\n\nUnknown\n\nJun 8, 2015\n\n#3\n\nOh I do like this show. Real shame it didn't last longer. But it's just so funny and the original wasn't too bad either. I saw a movie once. Great that it keeps going after the tragic incident that happened to the creator.\n\nFranGP\n\nI'm going digital\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nJan 23, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n461\n\nLocation\n\nSpain\n\nJun 8, 2015\n\n#4\n\nReal shame it didn't last longer.\n\nHm? I thought it was still running? Well, even if it isn't, I don't think this is a short one.\n\nNevermind, I've seen that it was canceled in 2010. Still, an anime that lasted 20 years and produced over 800 episodes is not short at all. Unless you mean the little kid: he's a flea.

English dub is purely done for older people.\n\nFranGP\n\nI'm going digital\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nJan 23, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n461\n\nLocation\n\nSpain\n\nJun 9, 2015\n\n#6\n\nAlso be aware, the English version is in no way aimed at kids like the Japanese version and many dubs are. English dub is purely done for older people.\n\nI'll give the English dub a try, then. Although I'll add that if I ever have kids, I wouldn't let them watch this. It's quite inappropiate for small children. Maybe 12-14 years old, but in no way younger.\n\nAnd you can make yourself an idea of Shinchan's echo in the media when I tell you that Usui's death made it to the news here\n\nUnknown Neo\n\nYou got in\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nSep 10, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n13,070\n\nAge\n\n40\n\nLocation\n\nUnknown\n\nJun 9, 2015\n\n#7\n\nHm?

I really liked it and was nice to have an anime that's funny and not bad on Adult Swim.\n\n3 seasons of 26 episode isn't a bad run.\n\nEspecially when you consider due to licensing issues (at least as I recall it didn't) season 3 never even aired on TV (which is likely what killed Funimation doing it any further.)\n\nUnknown Neo\n\nYou got in\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nSep 10, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n13,070\n\nAge\n\n40\n\nLocation\n\nUnknown\n\nJun 10, 2015\n\n#9\n\nTrue. And I did see some episodes on Funi's Youtube channel. Same way I saw the 3rd part of Tenchi Muyo. But really, it's a fun show that could have gone on longer here. But oh well. It's Adult Swim.\n\nChaR1ot33r\n\nCompletely digital\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nJun 17, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n672\n\nLocation\n\nEarth-616\n\nJun 17, 2015\n\n#10\n\nHere in India, it airs on a kids' channel called Hungama TV, with *some* censorship, aiming it basically at kids."
