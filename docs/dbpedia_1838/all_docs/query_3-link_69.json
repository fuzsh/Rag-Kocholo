        "text": "Despite being arguably the most iconic character to ever come out of Japan, Godzilla has strangely never made an appearance in any forms of anime. Until now. Thanks to Anime News Network for the heads up.\n\nThat’s right… the Big G himself will appear in an episode of the comedy series “Crayon Shin-chan,” which is based on the manga created by the late Yoshito Usui that has sold over 43 million copies worldwide. The anime also spawned a series of movie spinoffs so this is indeed a hot property in Japan. It follows a kid named Shinnosuke Nohara, or Shin-chan, and the antics of his school and family life.\n\nThe episode will be called “It’s Shinnosuke vs. New Godzilla,” and in it Godzilla will appear in Tokyo Bay, so it falls to our mischievous young hero to put a stop to his rampage. It was produced with the help of Toho to market Godzilla Resurgence and will feature his roar sound effects straight from the movie.\n\nThe episode will air on July 22nd, just days ahead of Godzilla Resurgence’s July 29th release date. Godzilla will also appear in the upcoming game City Shrouded in Shadow."
