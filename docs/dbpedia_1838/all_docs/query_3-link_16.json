        "text": "\"Honey, did you take away the one pleasure in my life that doesnt involve a detatchable shower head?\"\n\nThis is STRANGE...and by strange I mean flat out INSANE.\n\nThe jokes were coming at a mile a minute! It got quite a few laughs from me which is a HELL of a lot more than Super Milk Chan ever gave me so it automatically gets a plus in my book. If the remainder of this test run doesnt maintain this level of funny then im gonna be very dissapointed because so far its left me a good impression.\n\nYay for FUNi dubbing songs again! They don't do that often enough anymore.\n\nOh yea, the rest of the episode was great too. It kinda reminded me of Sealab 2021 (back when it was good) and Space Ghost Coast to Coast. I guess it's kinda-sorta the anime dub version of those types of shows.\n\nShin's voice didn't seem to fit, but it's not like he had all that many lines to say in this episode.\n\nOh, and as if it wasn't obvious...Youtube = Bad.\n\n\"What you guys never seen a shoe phone?\"\n\nShadow Blaziken said:\n\nI think Monica Rial played Tiger Woman (or whatever her name was)...right?\n\nNo I'm pretty sure Monica Rial voiced Ai(the little rich girl).\n\nAnd I think Clarine Harp voiced Tiger Woman.\n\nDai_Maxwell said:\n\nWorst.animation.ever.\n\nYet, better than most of Adult Swim's cartoons like Aqua Teen Hunger Force....\n\nI diddn't have a problem with the animation at all, seems fine to me.\n\nWhen did this episode air anyway? The show started in 1992, is this a recent episode?\n\nDuke said:\n\nShin's voice didn't seem to fit, but it's not like he had all that many lines to say in this episode.\n\nI think it fits. He shouldn't have a cute voice(like Laura Bailey has done many times) & I don't think he would sound right if a male like Aaron Dismuke or Greg Ayres voiced him. He should sound like a weird perverted boy that he is & Laura Bailey does it great.\n\nIn the middle\n\nIt had some decent laughs, but it seemed a bit back and forth on the whole. There was a certain likability to it that made it work, though I'm not quite sure how long that'll last if this is the format.\n\nI'll go with \"alright\".\n\nOn a side note I think I've reached a point where I no longer care what AS can \"get away with\". Nothing really came off as too shocking.\n\nWow! Everyone in this show is so ugly! Somehow makes it easier to enjoy!\n\nThe children in this show are so twisted and weird, especially that Ai girl. Even the baby is troublesome!\n\nLESBIANS!!!\n\nI loved the last segment when everyone became sidekicks and Ench-Man lost track of all the pigs! Aw heck, everything about Ench-Man was really cool!\n\nI have to see the rest of the episodes that AS aquired! The show is so awesome!\n\nA Funi-dubbed ending theme? Haven't heard one of those in a while!\n\nThe Landstander said:\n\nIt had some decent laughs, but it seemed a bit back and forth. There was a certain likability to it that made it work, though I'm not quite sure how long that'll last.\n\nI wonder that too. Not that I don't have confidence in Dorkin and Dyer. I just remember how I watched MXC for a while and I liked it at first, but 30-40 episodes in, the actors would be talking non-stop to try and cram too many jokes in. Not to mention that eventually every joke boiled down to \"Ooo that was ALMOST naughty!\" and I got sick of it. If Dorkin and Dyer can maintain a rapid joke pace while keeping a balance with the obvious \"adult humor\" jokes, they should be fine for a while. After all, people are still digging Duel Masters.\n\nAnd it's nice to see they're not scared of tasteless jokes like the dumpster line. That's one thing I don't like about Steven Foster's re-writes. If there's a situation in a shoe store, there better be a Heather Mills joke.\n\nLook out Hank and Dean.. Shin-Chan will do his hiney dance on you! SCHIZOPHRENIA!\n\nAfter watching this first teaser episode I have to say Shin-Chan really needs a life.. seriously he does.\n\nAs for the Ench-man Segements they're funny (Shin is \"Rocket Pocket boy?\" Oy. *Rubs Temples*)\n\nOkay and really are all those female superheroines (Tiger Woman, Green Leopard and Pink *****, really needed? and are they all teachers? (What haven't you ever seen a Shoe Phone?) I am a mole.....)\n\nall in all a cute laugh but it's No Venture Brothers....In fact, Hank Venture is calling this show.. a Crumb-bum... or maybe a \"Crampon\" It's hard to say...\n\nOh and the baby was funny.. (At least there's very little brat drool on it..)\n\nSCHIZOPHRENIA!\n\nNot really greaty with the animation styles, but still the writers had some fun with this.. I give this first ep, a 7.5 out of 10... but if they ever get the writers to go crazy.. well then maybe I'll consider putting this one on my \"Watch list.\" Otherwise.. it's barely mentionable except for all the women dressing up in Catsuits.\n\nIt got funnier as the show went on... the recurring Ench-Man segments helped in that respect.\n\nThe first Ench-Man segment (his introduction) didn't do anything for me, but the second was better with Rocket Pocket Boy and Tiger Woman's intros (fave jokes: RPB telling TW she was fat to get her attention; TW's personality issues), and the third was downright hilarious (the other teachers getting in catsuits, Shin's friends in the act too).\n\nSegment Two... Ai's just an obsessive nutball, doing everything to get in Shin's dad's good graces, even what Shin's mom considers 'hitting on him' to get closer to her beloved. I can't believe Shin's dad wishes for Ai to 'spontaneously combust.'\n\nSegment Four... Shin's mom and Hima... good stuff. \"Honey, did you take away the one pleasure in my life that doesn't involve a detachable shower head?\" and \"Hima, you're the one we're not supposed to regret!\" Hilarious! (Though I could be biased... Colleen Clinkenbeard's her VA. )\n\nSpeaking of which... I thought someone mistakenly identified Laura Bailey as Shin's mom a week ago. Laura actually voiced Shin. (Or maybe I'm just going nuts.)\n\nScore, score... I guess I'll say borderline 7 out of 10. I work at night, so catching the episodes will be hard... I'm gonna try, though, as this seems it might be worth the effort (don't prove me wrong, Shin-chan!).\n\nDefinately has a certain charm to it. Sort of like the bastard child of Azumanga Daioh and Sealab 2021. Animation was unappealing, but if Amid Midi is to be believed they do some more experimental stuff varying from episode to episode so I at least respect its effort to be different. \"Schizophrenia\" and the whole skit with the dad and Shin's friend both had me LOLing. I don't want to jump onto a bandwagon too early (look at what happened with Bobobo after the wacko premiere), but this could very well be the biggest thing anime on AS has going for it since at least Champloo (and with the weekday run which is practically guarenteed to do better than Saturdays, it could surpase that series' success and get on the level of maybe even AS's original comedies). I give this first episode a B+."
