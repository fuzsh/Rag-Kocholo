        "text": "This blog mainly focus on Shin-chan to analyze the harmony roles that why audiences including me like the characters who apparently have many disadvantages in this cartoon. Here I believe that the reason is harmonious balance of role’s features and I will evaluate briefly with Shin-shan. Generally, the narratives of this work affirm the value of him in either direct or indirect manner and simultaneously represent their faults in humorous ways. Moreover, as mentioned in the last blog, this anime represent lives of the middle class as well as endeavor to attract them, the harmonious balance of figures contribute in affirming them and children as well.\n\nConcerning the characteristic of Shin-chan, he always gives viewers an impression of naughty boy, due to he almost makes a mistake in every episode and always behaviors inadequately such as usually takes off his trousers in public places. However, to some extend, he is a brave and smart boy with many ideas that make sense. For example, he questions some stereotypes shared by others consciously or not. In below screen shots, a girl called Nini (one of Shin-chan’s friends) shows her handkerchief with Lovely-P (a lovely girl cartoon image) pattern to other girls in the kindergarten. Shin-chan says that he also like Lovely-P and Nini contradict that boys should not like this kind of cartoon image, which only ought to be favored by girls. Then Shin-chan asks why can’t boys like Lovely-P and who establishes this rule? Differently, Fengjian – another boy of Shin-chan’s friends also like Lovely-P – feels shame to show his favor.\n\nNini shows her handkerchief with the Pattern of Lovely-P\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: I also want to have one!\n\nNini finds it is strange that Shin-chan likes Lovely-P\n\nTranslation – Nini: Why are you here, Shin-chan?\n\nTranslation – Nini: This is the thing that only girls like!\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: Who regulate this (only girls are permitted to like Lovely-P)?\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: Is that regulated by the president in congress?\n\nIn addition, although Shin-chan always makes trouble, meanwhile he is a sensible 5-year-old boy such as help his mother in buying things or taking care of his little sister (Kwai), who is only 4 years younger than him and is never jealous of she has mother’s attention or love. Below pictures are scenes of taking care of Kwai on his own initiative in a smart way.\n\nShin-chan finds his sister is ripping the paper.\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: Kwai (his sister’s name), you will be scolding by mother, if you ripping the paper.\n\nShin-chan gives his sister a leaflet of jewels.\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: look at this!\n\nKwai is attracted by the images of jewels.\n\nKwai focus on the leaflet and stops ripping the paper and meanwhile Shin-chan clear away the paper\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: Can’t stand\n\nShin-chan also gains affirm from other girls not for his advantages, but the most true himself even his disadvantages. For instance, Shin-chan visits another kindergarten and teaches children here to play football with the naked butt. Then a girl shyly praises his butt.\n\nTranslation – the girl in the left – But Shin-chan’s butt is pretty!\n\nConsidering with his fascination of beautiful sisters (girls), he has a lot of creative ideas and adequate sentences in talking with them according to different occasions, in addition to simplex praise and asking for contact information.\n\nAccosting female who sells juice:\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: Which is your favorite juice?\n\nAccosting female who sells mobile phone:\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: May I install the application of me inside your heart?\n\nAlthough Shin-chan always show his favorite to many different pretty girls, his knows that a wife hopes that her husband only loves her. To be specific, he knows his mother is not allowed his father likes others. Let’s look the picture and the dialogue between Shin-chan and his father during taking a shower.\n\nTranslation – Father: When you see a lovely person (girl), you feel that she is really cute.\n\nTranslation – Father: This is very normal.\n\nTranslation – Father: That is why we feel happy in our lives.\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: However, mother will say this (father think other girls/females are cute) is not happy.\n\nIn addition to know his mother’s mind, Shin-chan can also analyze his father’s thoughts such as the password of his fathers’ mobile phone.\n\nShin-chan wants to open his father’s mobile phone, but he doesn’t know the password of it.\n\nTranslation – Phone (phonetic system): please say the password.\n\nShin-chan guesses his father’s password…\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: Now the number chose by my father might be…\n\nShin-chan guesses the password is 1234 and input the password.\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: one two three four\n\nThe password is correct and the phone is unlocked.\n\nShin-chan is also good at resolving trouble some conditions such as danger and embarrassment. For instance, when Shin-chan stays at home alone, two thefts enter his home and Shin-chan successfully protect himself as well as family property. Below screenshots are another examples that Shin-chan help in stopping an argument between two girls in kindergarten. The background of these pictures is two girls argue about who is the most good at enduring and ask for other boys’ opinions.\n\nTwo angry girls are arguing.\n\nTwo girls decide to ask boys for which of them endure more.\n\nTranslation – Xiaoai (girl in the right): You say who do better in enduring?\n\nFengjian (the boy in the left) don’t know what to say.\n\nTranslation – Fengjian: How can I know this kind of thing…\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: So let me ask you two a question!\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: If you wear the same underwear…\n\nTranslation – Shin-chan: how many days can you accept to keep not changing it.\n\nGirls stop arguing and start to think…\n\nTranslation – Xiaoai: How many days can I wear…?\n\nThese plots above are only small part of scene that represent the special thinking manners or we can call advantages, which apparently not be emphasized by the author, but instead, embedded in the narratives of Crayon Shin-chan. These unconsciously cover or at least neutralize the naughty figure or disadvantages that enable Shin-chan be favored by viewers. This condition not only exists on the characterization of Shin-chan, but his father, mother and many characters as well.\n\nLet’s move on the last example about the father, that a lot of beauties are designed to fulfill Shin-chan’s father’s daydream. As mentioned in the second post, daydream of beauty is the fourth frequent among all his daily behaviors. However, some details also arranged to maintain his characteristic. For example, his wife always hit him but he never hit back, he shows love to his wife more often than dream of beauty, collapses from his imagination of his wife falling in love with another guy.\n\nThis is my last blog on Crayon Shin-chan and I wish Shin-chan, his friends, teacher and family will live happily in screen forever.\n\nThe last two blogs briefly articulated that the creator of Crayon Shin-chan endeavored to attract domestic both of adults and children. Moreover, this blog aimed at further narrowing the niche market into domestic middle class specifically. In general, the channel which this cartoon broadcasted on as well as the narrative of it indicated the situation.\n\nFirstly, with regard of the television channel, TV Asahi Corporation has broadcasted Crayon Shin-chan for more than twenty years. Additionally, texts from this channel were mainly provided for middle-class citizens.\n\nIn the TV Asahi official website, programs were divided into seven categories, including drama, drama remake, formats, entertainment, life style, animation and sports, and most of them could be classified in popular culture. For instance, dramas in this channel had a genre of family lives and romantic stories that might shared by middle class in terms of their tastes and interests. TV Asahi attempted to attract them with various popular cultural works and there was hardly any program under the category of high culture (like documentary) or work representing poverty-stricken conditions for the bottom. Therefore, what this channel offered Crayon Shin-chan was the specifically maximum audience group from middle class that most likely to enjoy it.\n\nSecondly, considering the narrative of Crayon Shin-chan, it was observable that content endeavored to arouse resonance of middle class. For example, in plots, Shin-chan’s mother usually complained on lacking of money and decided to save money. Below two pictures were from different episodes.\n\nIn addition, Shin-chan always talked about his family’s 35-year house loan and father cared about his job for earning more.\n\nGenerally, massive dialogues and scenes were arranged to represented Shin-chan’s family was extremely poor. Paradoxically, the true economic condition of them was not so coincide with those characters’ claims. Below pictures were interesting details in the cartoon which indirectly indicated economic condition in Shin-chan’s family.\n\n(Notice: before seeing pictures, you should always remember those plots were created in 199os which meant the development of economy and some other domains were not as well as nowadays)\n\nShin-chan’s family lived in a big duplex villa with garden and balcony.\n\nThey had their own air conditioner in their house.\n\nThe first car of Shin-chan’s family.\n\nThe second car of Shin-chan’s family\n\nThe third car of Shin-chan’s family\n\nThe fourth car of Shin-chan’s family\n\nShin-chan’s family adopted a homeless dog and its doghouse costed 38,000 JPY (259GBP)\n\nShin-chan’s father’s salary in 1990s for one month was 300,000 JPY (2040GBP)\n\nTranslation– female salesclerk: ‘thanks for your custom, it costs 980 JPY .’\n\nShin-chan’s dog shampoo costed 980 JPY (7 GBP)\n\nThese narratives proved that Shin-chan family was not poor and not rich as well for arrangement of other supporting roles who on behalf of rich people, such as Xiaoai – one of Shin-chan’s classmates in kindergarten.\n\nScene of Xiaoai arrives at kindergaten\n\nIn this scene, Xiaoai went to school by Stretch limousine with a bodyguard.\n\nTill now it was clear that Shin-chan family was inside middle class group. This corresponded to lives of the middle group. Some other living habits of citizens, as a result of economic condition, from this class were also represented such as female had desires and behaviors on life of consumption (Gordon, 2007). For example, although Shin-chan’s mother always tried to save money, she was good at spending / wasting money as well. She always bought expensive goods especially famous brand clothes or things she never or seldom used.\n\nThese sorts of narratives would call middle class group’s resonances and offered them illusion that these behaviors and incidents were normal and daily.\n\nReference\n\nGordon, A. (2007). Consumption, leisure and the middle Class in Transwar Japan, in Social Science Japan Journal, Vol, 10 (1), PP. 1-21. [Online] Available at: http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/1/1 (Accessed at: 7 November 2016)\n\nAs mentioned in the last blog, Crayon Shin-chan treated both adults and children as its niche market and this blog tended to explored more about it target audience. Generally, although the Internal Affairs and Communication Ministry declared that animation has occupied 90% of all Japanese television exports in 2008 (Anne, 2012), Crayon Shin-chan did not intentionally attract international viewers partly for it was early created in 1990. Moreover, this cartoon also had some observable features that arranged for domestic citizens.\n\nOn one hand, considering the design of characters’ appearance, most of animated roles in Crayon Shin-chan were came out with a Japanese look, such as black hair, short noise and round face. This was different from the figure arrangement like golden or colorful hair, in those cartoons aimed at exporting. For instance, Nana was a beautiful college girl who was most liked by Shin-chan’s family and many other roles as well. In other words, she was an acknowledged beauty who could on behalf of characters’ aesthetic in Crayon Shin-chan.\n\nIn the above picture, Nana has black hair, slim figure (such as pointed chin), short nose and without big bust. This character arrangement or aesthetic was closer to the oriental rather than citizens in the west. Moreover, Shin-chan’s father who was one of the main characters, had small eyes with single eyelids that also more common in the east area.\n\nOn the other hand, with regard to the narratives of this cartoon, it to a large extent reflected Japan culture.\n\nHere not only including traditional customs such as wearing kimono and eating seven grass porridge, but subsuming the manner of politician election and more crucial, everyday life of characters which potentially provided similarity as well as kind of approval of viewer’s life such as family stayed inside a ‘Warm Table’ which mostly used in Japan together and talked or watched TV in cold days. Specifically, ‘Warm Table’ was a low table covered with quilt and equipped electronic warming facilities.\n\nLike the picture above, some families which in front of the screen saw Crayon Shin-chan, might also stay in the ‘Warm Table’ and meanwhile, they watched other Japanese cultural components which they also experienced. These sorts of arrangements of the narrative agreed audiences’ sense of selfhood and normalized their lives by representing their daily routines, accidents and habits. This corresponded to Catherine’s view that television served as an important component in formatting citizen’s identities in social and cultural as well (2005).\n\nReference\n\nCatherine, J.

(2012) Cartoon planet: the cross-cultural acceptance of Japanese animation, Asian Journal of Communication, 22:1, (pp. 44-57). [Online] Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2011.622774 (Accessed at: 5 November 2016)\n\nThere was a trend during 1980s that television broadcasting situated in media industry went about targeting audience (Catherine, 2005). Since 1992, as a work kept popular for 27 years, Crayon Shin-chan began airing on Asahi TV channel in Japan, which was succeeding in animation creating and exporting.\n\nThis blog would briefly explore which group was the niche market for Crayon Shin-chan and how did it target them.\n\nNormally, most cartoons were created for children or teenagers, however, Crayon Shin-chan faced to family audiences (Williams, 2000), which means not only children, but adults as well. In addition, massive sexual implications were interwoven in the context only apt for people beyond 18 years old. For example, Shin-chan and his father craze for beautiful female, showing the bra and underwear of Shin-chan’s mother or nude body.\n\nLike these two picture above, hints of sex in Crayon Shin-chan seemed was employed intentionally in attracting adult viewers. It’s worth to mention that the author bring humor elements into plots designing which enabled to offer more fun and reduce shame from certain kind of scenes. For instance, Shin-chan had a classical elephant dance that he took off clothes and showed his buttocks and ‘elephant’. It was a shame to watch a character naked on the screen, but here the naughty five-year-old boy with song and dance made that acceptable to audiences.\n\nIn addition to naked body and women’s personal clothing, there were also some implications about adult’s sexual life. Children might not understand the true meanings of that sorts of plots which adults could make sense of. In episode 555, Shin-chan’s mother was pregnant that they were going to have a second children and the family discussed about this. Here Shin-chan said that he known the process of having a baby and the following dialog between he and his parents contained some sexual hints. Specifically, below were the screen shot and the translation of that plot.\n\nNow I could understand that what Shin-chan sad was different from what his parents meant. However, when I watch this cartoon for the first time in 2000s, I did not mentioned this implication. Moreover, instead of directly sexual description, this category of hint attracted adult viewers; meanwhile to some extends protected children and avoided embarrassment if the whole family watch Crayon Shin-chan together.\n\nFurthermore, Crayon Shin-chan was different from Chinese animation which focused on children with an intention full of didactic like educating children how to behave, communicate, study and so on. This cartoon revealed reality (such as foible and pretension) for adults rather than boring and simplex purpose of teaching.\n\nIn the screenshot above, two young vain female teachers compared and discussed about the size of bust in the bath. Like this manner, issues and affairs were exaggerated to construct humor aiming at letting adult viewers naturally laughed at themselves.\n\nReference\n\nCatherine, J. (2005) ‘Quality/Cult Television: The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer in US Television of the 1990s’, Telefantasy, Chapter 4 (pp. 95-123). http://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3150667/mod_resource/content/0/Johnson%20Telefantasy%20Chapter%204.pdf\n\nWilliams, M. W. M. (2000), Japanese Comics and Religion: Osa Tezuka’s Story of the Buddha, in JAPAN POP! Inside the world of Japanese Popular Culture, edited by Craig, Timothy J, Chapter 6, (pp. 93-114). Published by Routledge.\n\nThis blog is going to examine the situation of female description in Crayon Shin-chan. This domain has attracted many scholars’ attention and they explored traditional feminine stereotypes involving placing females in a subordinate situation of male (Althusser, 1974, quoted by Caradeux and Salom, 2013). In Japan, women strives for equal rights such as education and workforce under the overarching patriarchal society (Kagawa, 2006). In this cartoon, some unequal arrangement of female character still exist, nevertheless, the situation of them is also improved along with the changing status of women.\n\nFirstly, in the portrayal of main character family and some supporting roles, the mainstream dimorphic rule still remain unchanged that women are housewives who stays at home (Ledden and Fejes, 1897) while men working outside. For example, in Shin-chan’s family and his four friends families as well.\n\nSecondly, Gökçearslan (2010) claim that male cartoon figures are more that that of female and the the percentage of female characters worked outside in all women is lower that that of male characters. However, these two distribution of female and male roles in Crayon Shin-chan are not that serious.\n\nAbove chart is a statistic of all supporting roles in Crayon Shin-chan episode from 1 to 200. On one hand, the number of female characters (90) is more than that of male (52). On the other, 56.67% of women ever appear in working situation less than that of male supporting roles with a percentage of 76.92; nevertheless, the gap is not that large. Considering the job of female, most of them works as waitresses, nurse and salesclerks, but there also some women work as teacher, policewomen, doctor and so on outside of household. This can be treated as a unprejudiced representation of female in the area of employment with various occupations. In addition, the description here is better than several works that a research has shown only 13% of female cartoon characters work ( Gökçearslan, 2010).\n\nThirdly, categorization, which is contrary to nominalization, is also worthy to discuss. This concept means a role is not portrayed by being herself or himself, but has to depend on others ( Gökçearslan, 2010). In Crayon Shin-shan, most of the female roles are in this category due to they don’t have personal traits and only exist relate to Shin-chan’s family. Female roles in this cartoon without name and individual personality establish a symbolic group of subordinate of men. In addition, as mentioned in previous blog, more than half of female supporting roles, more than 50% of them are designed to satisfy Shin-chan and his father’s desire. Those female maintain a symbol of beauty and other females who appear not young, slim and good-looking are employed to set off the beauty group.\n\nReference\n\nCaradeux, D.A. and Salom, L.G. (2013). ‘Social Representation of Gender in Award-winner Short Films in Spain’ (from the proceedings of 5th International Conference on Corpus Linguistics, 2013), Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 95, pp.126-135. doi: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.631\n\nGökçearslan, A. (2010). ‘The effect of cartoon movies on children’s gender development’ in Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2(2), pp.5202-5207. doi: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.846\n\nThe last tweet toughly talked about Crayon Shin-chan’s mother, and this one will introduce Crayon Shin-chan’s father. Generally, the same as mother, father is also a round characteristic that could not be summarized into one single sentence. It’s worth mentioning that there are many contradictions in him. For instance, the father sometimes daydream about falling in love with beautiful women in office or bar, however meanwhile he usually show love to his wife and let his wife take care of his whole salary.\n\nBelow is the chart of father’s daily routine\n\nComparing with father’s daily with that of mother, the most common behavior of them is ‘take care of children’. In addition, ‘representation of working’ occupies the second ranking, which coincides with the situation in contemporary Japan that men work outside for economic income and women work domestically. Moreover, in Crayon Shin-chan, the father also do a little housework (comparing with the mother), which might be implied that the father contribute to household affairs.\n\nConcerning about his emotional life, there are mainly three terms here relate to it, which are ‘show love to wife’, ‘daydream of beauties’ and ‘be angry with wife’. ‘Show love to wife’ employed the highest ranking among these three with a percentage of 11, which is more than twice of that in the other two terms. At the same time, the sum of proportion of the later two categories (5%, 4%) is less than the single percentage of the first. Furthermore, comparing with mother, father show love more frequently and get angry to mate less. From the above, the author might prefer to construct a paradox male character who not only cares about the family and wife as well, but keep several disadvantages.\n\nIn addition to earn money, he is arranged to have some other male features, such as drink alcohol or do physical works. Moreover, he is not aggressive for he rarely hit Shin-chan and never hit his wife, though he always be beaten by his wife.\n\nIn my view, each man has his own characteristic, advantage and disadvantage. I can accept the disadvantage of the father in the cartoon or I think he is a good father and a qualified husband. To be honest, if he is single and I am the female college in the animation, I will tend to fall in love with him!!!\n\nI have really addicted in a Japanese cartoon called Crayon Shin-chan, since I was five years old, which was a manga series firstly created in 1990 by Yoshito Usui and began airing on television 2 years later. It depicted a funny adventure of Shin-chan – a naughty 5-year-old boy with his parents, relatives and friends.\n\nDuring viewing, some interesting phenomenons in the cartoon captured my attention. In addition, some funny plots that made people laugh, has profound substance. Therefore, I have attentive watched the first 200 episodes (average 7 minutes) of Crayon Shin-chan and found out this cartoon is peculiar in shaping adult female characteristics, and especially Shin-chan’s mother.\n\nUnder this Japanese mass media outlet, which was a category under the control of male, she was endowed with some unusual power. Here I didn’t mean she was a superwoman or had any super power. Specifically, she was a round character, who had a multiple personality trait that could not be defined with one single characteristic (Forster, 1927). This was quite different from the most of other mothers’ characteristics in Japanese cartoons. For example, in another Japanese cartoon named Chi-bi Maruko, the mother of the main character is a flat character, who was a submissive and hardworking housewife, corresponding with the stereotype raised by Thompson and Zerbinos (1997).\n\nBelow chart was the daily routine of Shin-chan’s mother:\n\n‘Take care of children’ employed the first ranking, but ‘hit children’ with a percentage of 38.5% took up the second, which was nearly four times of the typical mother’s household routine categories: ‘do house work’ (9%) and cook (10.5%). Moreover, she relaxed herself through sleeping in daytime, chatting with acquaintances and eating snacks which had a total frequency of 7.5% that only 1.5 percent less than that of ‘do housework’.\n\nIt was worth mentioning a funny phenomenon: the mother also hit the father in the same way as she hit her son, but the father never hit back. After the father and the son be hit, their heads were often inflated with two large pouches.\n\nIn this cartoon, the mother’s characteristic was complex – she was hard-working for frequently taking care of children, cooking and doing housework; she was gentle for showing love to husband; she was aggressive for often hitting her son; she was trusted for managing the father’s salary and whole family spending. Her presence seemed paradox, but actually is rational. In fact, this animation has deeply influenced me, result in I yearning for her life and dreaming to be a housewife as happiness as her in the future (Now I realize this is unpractical).\n\nReference\n\nForster, E.M.
