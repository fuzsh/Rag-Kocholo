        "text": "Before FUNimation Entertainment attempted to market Crayon Shin-chan in the US in 2006-2011 (with their dub lasting three seasons and 78 episodes), a previous attempt at an English adaptation had been in existence.\n\nCrayon Shin-chan was first localized into English by Vitello Productions in Burbank, California through 2001–2002, when TV Asahi and Lacey Entertainment decided to market the series worldwide. This dub is referred to by fans as the \"Vitello dub\". Shortened to just \"Shin Chan\" (as the later dubs would be), this version was never aired in the US, but it did air in the United Kingdom from April 22, 2002[1] through to 2003 on their version of Fox Kids. The dub was later relegated to only air as shorts on Jetix, or as a slot-filler between other programs, mostly movies that didn’t fill enough time[2]. The show was fully removed from the channel by the end of 2005. Jetix UK seemed to generally dislike the show compared to other feeds, as Vitello episodes were censored and aired sporadically in inconsistent time slots (many memories of viewers online mention either the early morning or late night, but schedules available from April 2002 and April 2005 show the series in evening slots).\n\nIt also aired on Fox Kids[3] in Australia in January 2003, and on Fox8 in the former Fox8 Kids block once the Fox Kids channel shut down in 2004. Outside of Fox, it aired on Network 2/RTÉ Two[4] in the Republic of Ireland as part of the defunct original version of The Den from January 2003 until approximately summer 2005, and on the now-defunct Channel i[5][6] starting on May 3, 2003[7] through at least September 28, 2004 in Singapore. The official Japanese series website also states that it aired in New Zealand beginning in July 2005, but the channel it aired on is unknown. The show was confirmed by entertainment executive Brian Lacey to have been sold there, as well as in Canada and South Africa. However, some other information on the official page pertaining to other dubs does not correspond to information commonly found elsewhere. The dub made its debut in Iceland in subtitled form[8] on January 14, 2003, and aired until August 19, 2008 on the Barnatími block on Stöð 2[9]. It premiered in Israel, also subtitled, in June 2004, on the Telemania block on Arutz HaYeladim, later moving to the newly-formed Telemanga block in 2006, running until the block's closure in 2009.[10]\n\nAlthough the dub was never aired in the United States, it was sold and licensed to Fox Kids while the episodes were still in English-language adaptation. Distributor Lacey Entertainment fully anticipated that Shin-chan would be launched as a strip, and it would do very well. However, Disney acquired Fox Kids, and with that acquisition, Disney advised that they would never broadcast the program, maintaining that the series \"did not fit with the Disney progamming image and strategy.\"\n\nIt was also pitched by Lacey with TV Asahi to both Cartoon Network and its Adult Swim block, whose VP of production Keith Crofford was revealed to be a fan of the series, during 2003, which ultimately failed. As fans of the show already, Adult Swim's staff believed that \"the newly dubbed version felt more appropriate for five year olds and had lost the charm of the original,\" as stated on its website in anticipation of the Funimation dub's test run premiere in August 2006[11]. Three years prior, on May 27, 2003, Sarah Dyer, who also enjoyed the series and later worked as a freelance writer for the Funimation dub's test run with her husband Evan Dorkin, wrote on her blog, \"I'll always be sorry that the attempt to get him for the Cartoon Network wasn't in time. I doubt the current licensee will ever get that show on the air. But you never know.\"[12] Despite no presence in North America, the show gained a lot of attention in other parts of the western world and Europe to make Crayon Shin-chan a larger success worldwide. The license agreement between Lacey Entertainment and TV Asahi expired at the end of 2005.\n\nThis dub contained many famous veteran voice actors that had done work in Western animation. Although the dub was heavily censored and localized, Shin-chan's infamous Buri Buri dance was still in the show. Text edits were also made, along with a new soundtrack. The theme song was composed by John Loeffler and John Siegler, of Pokémon fame.\n\n52 episodes that included 156 segments (episodes lasted 21 minutes and included 3 segments of 5 to 7 minutes) have been produced of the Vitello dub. 140 complete segments of the dub have been found in English, albeit some censored in the UK broadcast, and of 5 segments only a part have been found in English. 60 segments of the Vitello dub were released on Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, which have been uploaded.\n\nIn 2003-2004, Phuuz Entertainment and Media Concepts produced a new season of the English adaptation, being commissioned by Lacey Entertainment to continue in similar style as the Vitello dub, featuring a different pool of Los Angeles-based voice actors known for anime. None of this dub was ever released on DVD, and no segments have appeared on the internet. 52 episodes (156 segments) have been produced of the Phuuz dub, of 151 segments the English name is known. After Lacey Entertainment's license expired, FUNimation acquired the rights to the series and their dub was approved for Adult Swim. Another English dub that was closer to the original was commissioned by LUK Internacional in 2015 and released in 2016.\n\nFox Kids Europe and Jetix Europe Channels B.V. - a British and Dutch media company located in Hilversum (The Netherlands) and London (United Kingdom) - is a media company that oversaw the dubbing and distribution of European dubs based on the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. In 2003 the company was owned by The Walt Disney Company and to a lesser extent by a famous Dutch media tycoon.\n\nThe Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish dubs of the series used the Vitello dub as the source for their dubbing. Of these the Danish, Italian, Greek and Polish dubs did not continue from the Phuuz season afterwards. The series proved to be popular worldwide. Much of the knowledge on the dub has been sourced from its foreign-dubbed counterparts.\n\nIt is not clear which channels may have aired the Phuuz dub’s episodes. According to an edit made to Wikipedia in December 2004, Fox Kids UK premiered a “new series” with a “different voice cast” that month, although the voice actors were at the time unidentified due to the fact that Fox Kids would cut the credits on many of its shows. Mentions on Israeli forums also suggest that the season aired there.\n\nStaff\n\nVoice Cast\n\nVitello\n\nShin Nohara, Mitsy Nohara: Kath Soucie\n\nHarry Nohara, Bo: Eric Loomis\n\nDaisy Nohara, Max: Russi Taylor\n\nCosmo, Miss Uma: Grey DeLisle\n\nNini, Miss Dori: Anndi McAfee\n\nPrincipal Enzo, Masked Muchacho: Patrick Fraley\n\nPhuuz\n\nShin Nohara: Diane Michelle\n\nMitsy Nohara: Julie Maddalena\n\nHarry Nohara: Peter Doyle\n\nCosmo: Hope Levy\n\nMax: Barbara Goodson\n\nBo: Richard Cansino\n\nNini: Michelle Ruff\n\nLucky: Michael Sorich\n\nMiss Dori: Cindy Robinson\n\nProduction Staff\n\nVitello\n\nProducer: Paul Vitello\n\nAssociate producer: Cheryl Pollak\n\nWritten by Leslie Ray\n\nDialogue Director: Paul Vitello\n\nDialogue Editor: Larry Ellis\n\nDialogue Recording: R.D.

For example, in episode 29, Shin brings his classmates to visit his newborn sister. Episode 30 features the baby coming home from her birth in the hospital. In episode 52, it was revealed that Shin was going to have a little sister.\n\nAll segments available were found by the same source on Fox Kids in the UK, uploaded to the Kametsu forums, unless stated otherwise. However, some episodes appear to be sourced from second-generation tapes. All segments stated to be found from Jetix are from the YouTube channel \"Shin Chan\", who has claimed to be in possession of 23 segments. Said user only ever uploaded 13 segments, 10 of which are available. Episodes 8a, 8c, and 17b were claimed for copyright when they were first uploaded and never backed up. Episode 30 was found from Fox8 Kids in Australia, uploaded to YouTube by GreenYoshi92.\n\nOn April 20, 2022, 16 complete segments and one incomplete segment were uploaded to Archive.org by user Philtype, sourced from VHS recordings captured on RTÉ2's The Den block in Ireland. On May 4, 2022, some alternate recordings of previously found episodes were added, including some new uncensored copies or copies in better quality.\n\nIt is possible some episodes were skipped by Fox Kids in the UK. For example, episode 20 is not available from a VHS rip on the channel. The Polish dub carries over the same censorship from the UK, which is also missing episode 20. It is the only foreign dub based on Vitello's dub to use this censorship.\n\nNyaa Download of all found segments prior to April 2022 (including the ones on DVD) (missing 23b) + old version (missing 14a, part of 14b, and 23b)\n\nArchive.org download of all found segments prior to April 2022 (including the ones on DVD) (missing 23b)\n\nArchive.org download of all segments newly found in April/May 2022\n\nMEGA Download of all found segments, edited into full episodes in NTSC with fixed audio (including the ones on DVD) (NOTE: contains episode 23b, mistakenly left out of some other releases) (click on 'Download as ZIP' to download everything at once) / Alternative edits on Archive.org\n\nList of episodes of the Vitello dub with the Japanese titles and episode numbers\n\nIntro\n\nCredits\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries 1 (Fox Kids UK)\n\n# Episode Title Status Notes 1 Playing House Found Available on Shin Chan Volume 1 2004 Australian DVD.

The other segments' names are from the German and French dubs, which translated the Phuuz dub. The French dub, the Brazilian Portuguese dub, the Latin American Spanish dub, and the Dutch dub translated the same number of episodes. A limited number of episodes are also available from the Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish dubs, which included English title cards, with some of the same known segments. It is commonly believed that Phuuz dubbed 78 episodes due to the German dub containing 130 episodes, but Brian Lacey has confirmed that it was only 52, stating that in Germany, the broadcaster acquired more than the 104 episodes originally adapted for the US and global markets.\n\nThere is no footage of the Phuuz dub available in English, only three audio files, sourced from the episodes \"A Day with Daisy!\" and \"A Much Better Mom!\":\n\nShin Chan (Diane Michelle)\n\nHarry Nohara (Peter Doyle)\n\nMitsy Nohara (Julie Maddalena)\n\nCredits from the dub, sourced from the European Portuguese version\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeason 2\n\n# Episode Title Status Notes 53 We All Run Away!
