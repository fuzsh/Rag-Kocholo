Here's more show!\"\n\nThe final one, which usually is \"Yo! Time to go!\" was changed to \"Yo! Nanako!\" (Nanako is the MILF that Shin wants to... you know.)\n\n\"Isn't it time for you to take your pills and fall asleep on the couch?\"\n\n\"You've won the grand prize - a glass of extra creamy boob juice!\"\n\n\"You did the milk man...\"\n\n\"Yes - then I did the meter maid and had a threesome!\"\n\nMilk Gelatin...?!?\n\n\"I doubt those cows got thier teats yanked over this!\"\n\n\"This is like one of dad's secret movies!\"\n\n\"It's just like college without the daterape!\"\n\n\"Are you my wife for the night?...\"\n\n\"Your shower really was golden!\" <-- Double Entendre!\n\nWell now we know where Shin gets it from...\n\nTo treat her like crap so she'll treat you better, press A. <-- LMAO\n\n\"Generic beer and a mystery drink!\" XD\n\nLOL! I love Hiro's reaction to the \"rare handcrafted porcelain figurines of the entire cast of baywatch nights\" E-bay buy.\n\nWow...the nether regions are on full force tonight\n\nHarry Potter -> He's an autistic kid sent to england because he shot his brother, I bought an english phrasebook to help me read it. HAHAHA!\n\n\"Spotted dick is a cake with raisins!\"\n\n\"So that's what they're all eating!\"\n\n\"No, that's the little retarded boy we take care of for tax purposes!\" (And he's STILL wearing the bra! LOL)\n\nNice episode\n\nI didn't realize that this show was going to air.\n\nThen one night after Pee Wee, I caught it. I was suprised. I haven't had an Adult Swim show make me laugh out loud like this in a good while.\n\nI really hope they keep this show on the air, it's a definite change to the current lineup.\n\nI loved Chamelon Shin though.\n\nHis eyes were his mom's Madonna bra. xD"
