Former Indiana Pacer Ron Artest, now known as Metta World Peace, lists two regrets in his NBA career: elbowing James Harden in the face in 2012 while playing for the Lakers and not winning a championship as part of the 2004 Pacers team.

The 2004-05 Pacers were headlined by Jermaine O'Neal and Reggie Miller, while World Peace was coming of the first and only All-Star appearance of his career. The season came undone after nine games, when five Pacers were suspended following a brawl toward the end of their matchup with Detroit.

In a Q&A with GQ Magazine, World Peace dove into the disappointment that followed the "Malice at the Palace" and his ensuing suspension for the remainder of the 2004-05 season.

"Everybody says we could have won it," World Peace told GQ. "We definitely could have won it."

World Peace is promoting an upcoming documentary called "Quiet Storm: the Ron Artest story," which is set to appear Friday on Showtime. The documentary will include the entire footage of the brawl between the Pacers, Pistons and Detroit crowd.

The Pacers would go on to lose to the Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals. World Peace was traded in the following season to the Sacramento Kings.

World Peace won a championship as part of the 2010 Lakers. The Pacers have yet to win an NBA championship.
