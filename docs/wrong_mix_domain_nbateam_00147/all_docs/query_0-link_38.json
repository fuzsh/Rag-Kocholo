        "text": "AP Photo/Matt Slocum\n\nFormer NBA star Metta World Peace had flashbacks to 2004 as he watched a Philadelphia 76ers fan dump popcorn on Washington Wizards star Russell Westbrook.\n\n\"I felt like I was going to run into the stands,\" World Peace said to USA Today's Mark Medina. \"It shook me up a little bit.\"\n\nWestbrook was walking back to the locker room in the fourth quarter when one Sixers fan crossed the line.\n\n\"How do you throw popcorn on a player?\" World Peace said. \"Westbrook was pissed, and he had the right to be pissed. But Iâ€™m so happy that he was around people. Security was incredible.\"\n\nThe 2004 All-Star might be able to speak to Westbrook's state of mind in the moment.\n\nAs the Indiana Pacers were in the closing stages of a victory over the Detroit Pistons in November 2004, tensions between the teams rose following a foul by World Peace on Ben Wallace. With players arguing back and forth, World Peace laid down on the scorer's table, and the situation escalated when a fan threw a drink at him.\n\nWednesday wasn't a repeat of the \"Malice at the Palace\" as security personnel prevented Westbrook from walking into the stands, which World Peace had done in Detroit.\n\nThe 41-year-old told Medina the fan who dumped the popcorn on Westbrook should make a public apology. He also suggested the person should \"have his ass come to [the] arena\" to speak with the 2016-17 MVP personally."
