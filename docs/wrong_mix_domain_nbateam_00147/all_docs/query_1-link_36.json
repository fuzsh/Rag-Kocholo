That’s how we’d like to characterize the team’s potential, over a decade later, because the “absolute worst” actually came true. At this point we’ve spent years viewing that team following its beclouding, due to Nov. 2004’s Malice in the Palace.\n\n[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now | Free NBA Yahoo Cup entry]\n\nThat season’s Pacers squad, despite some early storm and stress, was well on its way toward the championship contention that many had them pegged for preseason when the squad brawled with both the defending champion Detroit Pistons and scores of Pistons fans during the melee at the Pistons’ Palace of Auburn Hills arena. Metta World Peace – then working by his given name of Ron Artest – was the central figure from that brawl.\n\nHe engaged in a needless shoving match with Pistons center Ben Wallace prior to making a show of lying down on the stadium’s scoring table. A thrown drink from a Pistons fan led to Artest somewhat-understandably but no less illogically storming into the stands to take on a bystander and as much of Piston Nation as he could.\n\nThe result? One of the darkest days in league history, a season-long suspension for Artest, and the dissolution of what could have been the only title winner in the franchise’s NBA history. Upon returning to Indianapolis this week, Metta World Peace discussed his sadly sober reflection on where it all went wrong with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes:\n\nMWP went on to credit former Pacers president Donnie Walsh, whom World Peace rightfully credits for putting together “a hell of a team,” for helping keep the vultures at arm’s length when Metta decided to undergo counseling to guide him through his professional and personal frustrations.\n\nStill, at that early point, the talks weren’t enough:\n\nWell, perhaps. I mean, cup-thrower John Green (whom MWP is now friends with) was also a real blankety-blank-blank. Metta World Peace was suspended for using violence to attempt to settle a cowardly, violent act perpetrated against him. He was somehow expected to act above the fray, engaging his mantra and counting to 91 prior to reacting, when something was chucked at him.\n\nMeanwhile, Green took in an almost imperceptible percentage point of what the then-Ron Artest had to deal with (including losing 88 percent of his paycheck that season), because his misstep was merely losing his temper over the goings-on during a blowout sports game?\n\nIn a lot of ways, where Artest truly screwed up was in the season that followed.\n\n[ | Mock Draft | The Vertical | Latest news]\n\n[Follow Dunks Don’t Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nFamously, he shared the cover of Sports Illustrated’s NBA preview issue prior to 2005-06 with Pacer el jefe Larry Bird, as the Pacers (who were bounced out of the second round in 2004-05 by the same Pistons) looked to rebuild in the wake of the suspensions and Reggie Miller’s (probably too-soon) retirement.\n\nThe team was working with a 12-7 record when Artest requested a trade, telling reporters that the Pacers “could win more games without me.” The forward was upset with both persistent trade rumors and what he saw as an inability to thrive within coach Rick Carlisle’s offense. Two prominent frustrations that, oh, 99.9 percent of NBA players deal with at some point in their career without going on record with the press to demand a change of scenery.\n\nThat 99.9 percent doesn’t include many players less than a year removed from throttling the hopes of the franchise’s best chance at a championship, digging the team a basketball hole that would last years and a misguided perception of both Pacer players and NBA athletes that sustains to this day in too many pockets of Indiana to name.\n\nPlaced in the team’s inactive list due to both the trade demand and a wrist injury, the Pacers lessened Artest’s trade value but still managed to secure Peja Stojakovic from the Sacramento Kings in a one-on-one deal midway through 2005-06. Artest went on to help the Kings return to the postseason in 2006, while Stojakovic would only work as a Pacer for four months before his free agent defection and cap space clearin’ turned into – you guessed it – Al Harrington.\n\nAlready fearful of the dwindling interest and attendance in the wake of the Malice at the Palace, watching as a goodly chunk of (speaking from significant firsthand experience, this isn’t weak Indy inference) deplorable incorrigible fair-weather watchers that vowed to never patronize the team’s building nor gift store in the wake of having their worst fears about pro basketball players come true, the Pacers went all out in an attempt to stay relevant.\n\nThis meant refusing to rebuild while shooting for 40-some wins every season. It was only a bit of drafting luck – finding Roy Hibbert and Paul George at draft positions that rarely yield All-Stars – that Indiana once again turned into an NBA powerhouse years later.\n\nYears after, even, Ron Artest’s move to become “Metta World Peace.” Prior to his 2010 NBA championship, and much-needed work in acting as a famed destigmatizer of professional counseling for pro athletes, or anyone else that wanted to listen. Or talk.\n\nMetta World Peace still feels the pain, and not just because he’ll be asked about it every time he passes through Indianapolis or Detroit. He did set the Pacer franchise back years due to his actions in 2004 and 2005-06, but only after turning into an All-Star in Indianapolis following a deal that sent him to the Pacers as a near throw-in caught up in a 2002 trade involving Jalen Rose.\n\nDespite the shattering breakup and subsequent fallout, the booing in Indiana has subsided. And, as noted in Baxter Holmes’ column, Metta World Peace can’t help but want to ascend to his role and the Pacers’ own Bill Buckner (or, depending on how Game 7 works out, Steve Bartman). Taking center stage in cheering as the team finally grabs that ring:\n\nWhat’s important is that Metta World Peace, through his own commitment and the help from the professionals whose guidance he continues to seek out, is open to feeling anything. This time nine, and ten years ago? He was too closed off to acknowledge what hurt.\n\n– – – – – – –"
