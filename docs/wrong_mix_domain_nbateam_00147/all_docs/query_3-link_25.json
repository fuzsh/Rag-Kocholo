        "text": "Metta Sandiford-Artest (born Ronald William Artest Jr., November 13, 1979[1] ) is an American former basketball player. He played for the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA. Artest changed his name to Metta World Peace in 2011, and changed his name to Metta Sandiford-Artest in 2020.\n\nArtest was drafted out of St. John's University by the Chicago Bulls and was known primarily as a defensive stopper. Later, he played for the Indiana Pacers, where he was involved in one of the most vicious NBA fights of all-time.[2] After leaving Indiana in disgrace, he played briefly for a couple teams before settling with the Lakers and becoming the \"Robin\" to Kobe Bryant's \"Batman.\"\n\nToday Ron Artest is respected in the NBA for his loyalty, and his quality play for the Lakers shows that he was worthy of a second chance at an NBA career.\n\nMedia related to Metta World Peace at Wikimedia Commons"
