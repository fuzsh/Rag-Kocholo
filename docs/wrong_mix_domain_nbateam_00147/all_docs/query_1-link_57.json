        "text": "Los Angeles: The mercurial Los Angeles Lakers forward formerly known as Ron Artest officially became Metta World Peace on Friday when a Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner approved the name change.\n\nWorld Peace, who will spend his off-season competing on ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars,” was granted the change just in time for the show’s season premiere on Monday night after clearing up lingering traffic ticket warrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Changing my name was meant to inspire and bring youth together all around the world. After this short delay, my tickets have been paid and I’m glad that it’s now official,” World Peace said in a written statement.\n\nWorld Peace was not in court for the hearing, but was represented by an attorney.\n\nA publicist for World Peace, Courtney Barnes, said the name change would require the Lakers defender to obtain a new driver’s license, passport and other official documents but would not affect his contract with the team.\n\nThe former Ronald William Artest, 31, will sport the new name on the back of his Lakers jersey starting next season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“World Peace has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace but it took many years of research and soul-searching to find a first name that was both personally meaningful and inspirational,” Barnes said. “Metta World Peace felt just right.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorld Peace, perceived by many people as a temperamental yet supremely talented player, is considered one of the NBA’s top defenders and was named the league’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2004.\n\nAs a member of the Indianapolis Pacers, he was suspended for 73 games in 2004 after going into the stands to confront rowdy fans following an on-court brawl with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe joined the Lakers in 2009 and helped lead the franchise to an NBA championship, the first of his career, in 2010.\n\nWorld Peace will be paired with dance professional Peta Murgatroyd on this season’s “Dancing With the Stars,” competing alongside a cast that includes actor David Arquette, transgender activist Chaz Bono, journalist Nancy Grace and reality TV star Kristin Cavallari.\n\nAdvertisement"
