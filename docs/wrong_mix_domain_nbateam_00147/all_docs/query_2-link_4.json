        "text": "Metta World Peace\n\nFounder & Chairman, Artest Management Group\n\nMetta World Peace played professional basketball for 19 years. He won the NBA World Championship with the LA Lakers in June 2010 and received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award â the NBAâs highest citizenship and community service honor â in April 2011. He was selected to the 2005-06 NBAâs All-Defensive Team, was voted by the media as 2003-04 NBAâs Defensive Player of the Year and was the only man with 271 steals in his first two seasons in the NBA, breaking Michael Jordanâs record. His autobiography, âNo Malice: My Life in Basketballâ was released in May 2018 with Triumph Publishing and a documentary on his life in basketball, âRon Artest: The Quiet Stormâ was released on Showtime in May 2019. World Peace is currently pursuing a variety of entrepreneurial projects including the XvsX Sports project he co-founded in 2017 and an NFT project, Meta Panda Club, to bring decentralized basketball community to the masses. Meta Panda Club launched in late spring, 2022, and MPC NFT holders had participation in XvsX Sports first-ever Gold League in fall 2022. World Peace is also known as a prominent mental health advocate, pop culture personality, philanthropist, and media favorite. He raffled off his 2010 NBA World Championship Ring with the proceeds going to his nonprofit, Xcel University (now known as Artest University). The online ring raffle raised more than $650,000. Funds were donated to nonprofits in 5 cities that provide mental health therapists and mental health services to their communities, and to provide scholarships to underprivileged youth in the New York City area. World Peace was part of the 13th season of ABCâs Dancing With The Stars, a contestant on CBSâs first edition of Celebrity Big Brother, and competed on the CBS competition show, Beyond The Edge. He is active in entrepreneurial endeavors, serves as an advisor to several tech start ups, and seeks to help other basketball players who aspire to a pro career with his IRL project, XvsX Sports.
