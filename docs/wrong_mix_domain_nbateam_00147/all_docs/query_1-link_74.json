        "text": "Yesterday we were faced with one of those odd juxtapositions produced by modern sports: the words “world peace” attached to the phrase “ejected for throwing a vicious elbow.” But so it was, after the Los Angeles Lakers’ Metta World Peace (formerly Ron Artest) celebrated a dunk against the Oklahoma City Thunder by jerking his left elbow back and striking Thunder guard James Harden squarely on the side of the head. Harden dropped to the floor, clutching at his ear, and stayed down for about a minute before being helped off the court. He was diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms and didn’t return to the game. World Peace didn’t return either—he was promptly ejected.\n\nWorld Peace’s outburst marred an otherwise incredible game between two Western Conference teams bound for the playoffs, which start this weekend. For three quarters, the Thunder looked, as they often have this season, to be the N.B.A.’s future arrived now: young, dazzlingly athletic, unselfish players who took visible joy in playing basketball. The Lakers, led by Kobe Bryant, seemed to represent the past: creaky, crabby, and, despite their vast experience, old and overmatched. Then the Lakers ran off a sixteen-point fourth-quarter comeback, punctuated by a one-footed desperation three-pointer from Bryant, and later won the game in the second overtime period. In an already frenzied and unpredictable lockout-shortened season, the game revealed the exciting promise of this year’s playoffs, in which it seems that nearly any team that qualifies could win it all. All was well with basketball, except for the moment when it wasn’t.\n\nAfter the game, World Peace apologized to Harden in a brief statement to reporters: “During that play I just dunked on Durant and Ibaka and I got really emotional and excited and it was unfortunate that James had to get hit with an unintentional elbow. I hope he’s O.K.” The sincerity of World Peace’s apology may not be in question, but the facts are, especially regarding his insistence that the act was “unintentional.” Nearly everyone who’s watched video of the event has noted that World Peace must have felt someone nearby, and in his excitement or, to put it more harshly, his barely controlled athletic rage, tossed his elbow back to clear that person out of the way. That’s being generous; it might have been more calculated than that. But we could even take World Peace at his word that he had no intention of knocking Harden to the ground, hitting him in the head, and potentially putting his career or life in jeopardy, and still condemn the act as dangerous. That’s likely what the league will do when it rules soon on what punishment World Peace will receive.\n\nMetta World Peace, of course, has been punished before. Mike Breen, calling the game for ABC, slipped up and referred to World Peace as Ron Artest right after the play, as if the sight of him in the middle of another violent incident on the court caused muscle memory to take over. Breen was the play-by-play announcer in Detroit on November 19, 2004, during the instantly infamous game between the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers, later known as the “Malice at the Palace,” when World Peace, then known as Ron Artest, was at the center of a dizzying, terrifying brawl between fans and players. Artest was suspended for eighty-six games, the longest suspension of its kind in N.B.A. history. He has been suspended several other times, either by his coaches, for various team infractions, or, more seriously, by the league, as in 2007, when he was hit with a temporary ban after he served jail time for a domestic-violence conviction. For years, the name Ron Artest evoked an image of the quintessential out-of-control athlete.\n\nYet teammates, coaches, and others who knew him always insisted that there was another side to Ron Artest. He was a great teammate, a nice person, a misunderstood figure. In 2011, he underwent one of the most notable rebrands in sports history, adopting the goofy but well-meaning name Metta World Peace—done less for reasons of self-promotion (see Chad Johnson’s transformation to Chad Ochocinco) than out of the search for a truly fresh start. Even before the name change, he spoke openly about his struggles with mental health, and about the help he had gotten from a psychologist. He recently became a prominent advocate for mental-health charities. And in a violent year around the world, it has been a good one for World Peace on the basketball court. After two-plus uneven seasons with the Lakers, he had run off nearly a month of solid play, and figured prominently in the Lakers’ plans for the playoffs. That changed on Sunday, as did the general consensus on just what chapter of the World Peace story we were now telling.\n\nLater in Sunday’s broadcast, Breen voiced his disappointment at what seemed like a relapse for World Peace. Breen is a New York broadcaster, and had followed World Peace, in his Artest days, from the Queensbridge projects to his time as a high-school star at La Salle Academy, in Manhattan, and then to college at St. John’s, where he excelled. Breen’s sadness was shared around the league. The first reaction was concern for Harden, who will have to pass a series of cognitive exams to be cleared to play. (The N.B.A., while not normally considered a full-contact league, has joined football and hockey in an overdue existential and practical wrangling with concussions.) That concern was followed closely by a widespread lament: World Peace had reintroduced us all to Ron Artest; he’d spoiled his seventh or eighth, and most likely last, shot at redemption; and, in a way, made fools out of all the people who had defended him over the years. World Peace has lived a troubled life—and much of that trouble he has brought on himself. Still, though, we root for redemption, and want our narratives to have clean, happy endings. The story of Metta World Peace, at least at this point in its arc, has turned back on itself.\n\nPhotograph by Reed Saxon/AP Photo."
