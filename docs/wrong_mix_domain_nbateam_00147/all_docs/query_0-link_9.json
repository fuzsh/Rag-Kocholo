        "text": "Malice at Little Caesars Arena? Doesn’t quite have the same ring to it.\n\nFriday night, though, Detroit basketball fans got a little taste of the Metta World Peace experience. And it would appear World Peace, formerly known as Ron Artest, has not mellowed since his NBA career ended.\n\nPlaying for the Killer 3s of the BIG3 basketball league, World Peace was ejected just a few possessions into his team’s game against Trilogy. World Peace appeared to disagree with an official over a foul call, before taking the ball and kicking it into the air.\n\n“They missed the call. They were trying to get it situated down there and Ron just went and stole the ball from the referee and kicked it,” said former Pistons star and Killer 3s point guard Chauncey Billups. “I told (World Peace) in the locker room, ‘If you were going to kick it, you should’ve put it in the top row, the top deck at least.’ It was a weak kick.”\n\nWorld Peace was immediately assessed two technical fouls and ejected, walking back into the bowels of the stadium as boos rained down upon him.\n\nIt was a much milder incident than the one that happened nearly 14 years ago, when World Peace was involved at the center of a brawl between the Detroit Pistons, the Indiana Pacers and fans at The Palace of Auburn Hills, Detroit’s former home.\n\nMore: Metta World Peace says bye to Palace: ‘A lot of history here'\n\nYet World Peace’s ejection Friday night still brought back memories of the 2004 fight and provoked a strong reaction on social media.\n\nWorld Peace wasn’t the only member of the Killer 3s with ties to the 2004 brawl. Stephen Jackson and Billups played for the Pacers and Pistons, respectively, at the time. For their roles in the incident, Jackson was suspended 30 games while Billups was suspended one game.\n\nBillups was calm when speaking with reporters after the BIG3 game, but bemoaned World Peace’s ejection, as the Killer 3s would eventually lose to Trilogy, 52-39.\n\n“The two missed calls at the start of the game, Ron lost it, Stephen Jackson kinda lost it a little bit, he kinda quit on us in the game,” Billups, who sat out due to injury, said. “We fought. The other guys played well, but those two, those are two of our best players, and we need them, we need them to win. Once Ron was gone, we’re down a player. Al (Harrington)’s very physical, we needed his strength against Al. And it was just tough, it was just tough the rest of the way.”\n\nAccording to Billups, though the game had ended, both World Peace and Jackson were still “hot” in their locker room.\n\n“I told him this, I said listen, ‘Bro, we old. We’re doing this for fun. We’re not in the league no more. This is all for fun. Compete with each other, have a good time, fellowship a little bit over the weekend. But our careers are over. It ain’t that serious,’” Billups said. “So that’s kinda my message. We’re out here just to have fun, compete, have a good time, enjoy the fans of Detroit, enjoy every single city that we go to and go home to our family and chill and relax.\n\n\"That’s what this thing is all about to me. And anything else is too much. We’re done, our careers are over.”"
