Have an account? .\n\nRon Artest officially changed his name to Metta World Peace today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis name change mirrors the personal change he's undergone in the last decade.\n\nToday, he's a fun-loving, harmless wacko who's set to embarrass himself on Dancing With The Stars.\n\nBut he was once a destruction thug who started one of the ugliest brawls in NBA history.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtest grew up in Queensbridge, New York City. When he was 12, he witnessed a player get murdered at a pickup game after another man broke off the leg of a table and stabbed him with it\n\nSource: New York Times via Hoops Vibe\n\nHe attended St. John's University. He was first-team All-Big East, leading his team to a 50-19 record in his two seasons\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was taken 16th-overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 1999 NBA Draft\n\nHe was traded to Indiana in 2002, and started to become the Artest we know today, on and off the court\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe paid for dozens of friends and family members to visit him from Queensbridge. ESPN did a photo essay of his entourage that included 30 different hangers-on\n\nSource: GQ\n\nIn January 2003, he drew comparisons to Dennis Rodman after getting in two \"testy exchanges\" with Heat's coach Pat Riley\n\nSource: Sports Illustrated\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year later he was suspended three games and fined $35,000 for destroying camera equipment after a loss to the Knicks. Here's the damage\n\nSource: Sports Illustrated\n\nDespite his volatile behavior, he had a career year in 2003-04. He made the All-Star team and was named Defensive Player of the Year. But on November 19, 2004, Artest's career took a nosedive\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone threw a drink at Artest toward the end of the Pacers-Pistons game in Detroit, and Ron then charged into the stands and started a wild melee. Artest was suspended from the remainder of the season — losing him $5 million in salary\n\nThe next season, he publicly requested a trade. GM Larry Bird said he felt \"betrayed\" that Artest wanted out after the Pacers stood by him after the brawl. He was traded to Sacramento in January 2006\n\nSource: NBC Sports\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did so-so with the Kings on the court. Off it, he was arrested for shoving a woman in the face and suspended indefinitely by the NBA in March 2007\n\nSource: ESPN\n\nHis career began to turn around when he was traded to Houston before the 2008-09 season. \"I'll be a kid in a candy store,\" he said. \"I'm going to dance with the stars\"\n\nSource: ESPN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe averaged 17 points on a Rockets team that did surprisingly well, making the playoffs. He parlayed his success into a contract with the Lakers\n\nHe didn't have his best statistical years in LA, but he won a title in 2010\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also got help off the court. After winning the title, he thanked his psychiatrist in a strangely touching postgame interview\n\nHe's still doing weird stuff, but it's mostly benign, like going on Jimmy Kimmel in his boxers\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fall, he'll be on Dancing With The Stars\n\nToday, he officially became Metta World Peace\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee another athlete change over time\n\nThe Long Downfall Of Tiki Barber >>\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
