        "text": "Ron Artest was one of the NBA’s bad boys.\n\n“His polarizing personality led to him being involved in some of the most infamous on-court altercations in NBA history. In 2004, World Peace, then a star on the Indiana Pacers, was involved with what the New York Times referred to as the ‘one of the worst’ brawls in sports history when his team played against the Detroit Pistons,” Ebony reported. The incident became known as “Malice at the Palace.”\n\nAs a result nine players were suspended and Artest got an 86-game suspension. This is still the longest suspension in NBA history for a non-drug-related offense. He also had to pay a $5 million fine.\n\nNow the life and times of Artest and the journey in how he became Metta World Peace has been captured in a new Showtime documentary called “Quiet Storm: The Ron Artest Story” (directed and produced by the former ESPN feature producer Johnny Sweet).\n\n“It’s called ‘Quiet Storm.’ It’s the story about Ron Artest. I changed my name in 2011 and [the documentary] is about my early days in the league,” World Peace told Ebony. “It goes through the evolution of my career starting out and getting drafted and situations that got me suspensions in the NBA.”\n\nListen to GHOGH with Jamarlin Martin | Episode 02: Rodney Williams Jamarlin talks to Rodney Williams, founder and CEO of Lisnr, about raising $10 million in venture capital, HBCU endowments that invest in black tech, and how to fire loyal employees you like.\n\n“I watched it and it’s like, Oh boy, I gotta relive these moments,” Metta World Peace, who won a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010, told The Atlantic. “The people I was affecting, we never sat down together, so we never actually experienced those moments together. I never knew how they felt. They didn’t know how I was feeling. On a TV screen, you get a chance to see everything.”"
