        "text": "Metta World Peace turned back into Ron Artest in the second quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers game Sunday against the Detroit Pistons.\n\nAfter Pistons forward Greg Monroe fouled Pau Gasol on a shot attempt, World Peace and Brandon Knight got into it away from the ball under the basket.\n\nWorld Peace grabbed Knight around the neck and waist and got in a little jab to Knight's jaw. When the two were separated, Detroit's Jason Maxiell and World Peace began shouting each other. A time out was quickly called and the two teams went to the bench before the fight escalated.\n\nWorld Peace was charged with a flagrant foul on the play.\n\n\"He's a small guy,\" World Peace said of Knight after the game, via ESPN Los Angeles' Dave McMenamin. \"He was trying his hardest to keep me off him. He worked hard, man. That kid, I don't know where he's from, I don't know what school he went to, because he was guarding me and I was crashing the boards. He's a tough kid, man. He tried to keep me off the glass and he did a good job. That's all I can say. He's a tough kid, very great. He's a tough point guard or shooting guard or whatever he is.\"\n\nWorld Peace had eight points and nine rebounds in the Lakers' 98-97 win."
