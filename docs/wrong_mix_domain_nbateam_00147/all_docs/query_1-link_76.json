        "text": "Metta Sandiford-Artest was feeling wistful on Wednesday, as the 17-year veteran reflected on his involvement in the most infamous brawl in NBA history: \"Malice at the Palace.\"\n\nIn the final seconds of a tense game between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons in November 2004, Pacers star Sandiford-Artest - then known as Ron Artest - ratcheted up emotions with a hard foul on Pistons center Ben Wallace. After a minor fracas between the Pacers and Pistons, Sandiford-Artest retreated to the sideline.\n\nHowever, while lying on the scorer's table, a Pistons fan threw a drink on Sandiford-Artest, causing the temperamental wing to charge the stands. There, he attacked a fan he mistook for the man who threw the drink, causing players from both teams and spectators to devolve into absolute bedlam:\n\nOf the nine players who received discipline from the league for their part in the incident, Sandiford-Artest's was the steepest: The reigning Defensive Player of the Year was suspended for the rest of the season, losing nearly $5 million in salary, and faced further legal consequences, including community service and anger management therapy.\n\nWhile the past was clearly on Sandiford-Artest's mind, he also weighed in on the ongoing NBA Finals, predicting his former team would ultimately take the title."
