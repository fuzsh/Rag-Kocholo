        "text": "THIS POST CONTAINS spoilers for this week’s episode of Fox’s The Masked Singer.\n\nAs Trolls Band Together characters Poppy and Branch searched for clues, sang to ‘NSync and slept during a special Trolls-themed episode of The Masked Singer, a new pink-haired creature was unmasked. NBA champion Metta Sandiford-Artest, the man formerly known as Ron Artest, was unveiled Wednesday as the Cuddle Monster.\n\n“One of the greatest to ever do it on the court,” said host Nick Cannon, following the reveal.\n\nAs Cannon asked about his short-lived experience on the show, Sandiford-Artest said he loved the fluffy character, and that the character’s colorful buttons symbolized energy points, or chakras.\n\n“We’re from the hood,” he said. “Might as well get into it.”\n\nMost of all, Sandiford-Artest said he’s looking forward to his family’s reaction to the show.\n\n“I can’t wait for my grandbaby to see this,” he added.\n\nAlthough the panelists were unable to pinpoint the sports star, panelists Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong praised the basketball icon for his NBA championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 and his defensive skills on the court.\n\n“Truly, you’re a legend,” Jeong said. “I’m star-struck.”\n\nDuring the smackdown, marking Anteater’s second week in the bottom two, Cuddle Monster stumbled over the lyrics to Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling,” as Anteater brought Southern charm to the Trolls pop tune. After a final vote, Anteater was spared.\n\nThe final wild card in Episode Eight, a breathless Cuddle Monster side-stepped to New Kids on the Block’s “You Got It (The Right Stuff).” In response to clues like boxing gloves, a glowing globe with the word “champ,” and sponsorship deals, the panelists guessed NBA players Dennis Rodman, Tristan Thompson, and Draymond Green. Panelist Nicole Scherzinger seemed certain the masked contestant was Shaquille O’Neal. Neighboring panelists clowned Scherzinger when she guessed the basketball legend duked it out with fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, rather than former boxer Oscar de la Hoya.\n\n“I think that Cuddle Monster is someone we’d all love to cuddle with,” Scherzinger remarked prior to the unmasking.\n\nTrending\n\nSandiford-Artest was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1999 and was later recognized as one of the greatest on-ball defenders in the league, winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award in 2004. The former basketball star played 19 seasons and was also involved in the infamous “Malice at the Palace” brawl in Michigan."
