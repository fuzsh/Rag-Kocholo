        "text": "The bad-boy basketballer who sparked one of the most violent on-court brawls in NBA history has had a radical change of heart.\n\nRon Artest, the 31-year-old famed for punching spectators in the closing seconds of a 2004 game between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons, is changing his name to Metta World Peace.\n\nThe eccentric move was revealed by celebrity news site TMZ.com but does not take effect until August 26, giving Artest time to make the required public declarations in his local newspaper.\n\nArtest told TMZ he wanted to be an \"inspiration\" to his fans.\n\n\"It's all about star power, you know, it's all about that positive energy, I've been doing so many positive things lately,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not about changing my image, I always tell people I'll never change, I'm still the same dude from the 'hood.\n\n\"But it's about doing different things and being inspirational, I love being inspirational.\"\n\nArtest, who now plays for the LA Lakers, is best known for inspiring an all-out, on-court biff, during which nine spectators were injured.\n\nDescribed by the sport's administrators at the time as \"shocking, repulsive and inexcusable\", the brawl broke out in The Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan.\n\nA video of the fight - later dubbed 'The Malice at the Palace' - show Artest, then a forward for the Pacers, fouling Pistons' pacer, Ben Wallace.\n\nWallace hits his counterpart in the chest before several players join the scrap on court.\n\nArtest, meanwhile, lies across the scorer's table and pretends to speak to a radio broadcaster, but loses his cool when a spectator throws a cup of Diet Coke - reported at the time to be beer - at him.\n\nI'm silly, I'm always doing something funny or whatever\n\nThe basketballer runs into the stands and attacks the man he (wrongly) believes to be responsible, while Pacer teammate Stephen Jackson follows and lays into a few more fans.\n\nNine spectators were injured and two were taken to hospital. The final few seconds of the game were called off, leaving Artest's team 15-point victors.\n\nArtest, Jackson, Wallace and Pacers' player Jermaine O'Neal were slapped with a combined total of 146 game suspensions.\n\nThe suspension cost Artest almost $5 million in lost wages and a number of years of career turmoil.\n\nHe was traded to the Sacramento Kings in 2006 and then to the Houston Rockets in 2008.\n\nArtest joined the Lakers in 2009, on a five-year deal worth $33 million that has proved something of a personal and sporting renaissance for the fiery player.\n\nLast year he played a crucial role in the Lakers' championship win over the Boston Celtics, thanking his family and team of doctors in a post-game interview.\n\n\"I want to thank my doctor ... my psychiatrist, she really helped me relax a lot,\" he told a television reporter on court.\n\n\"Thank you so much, it's so difficult to play ... there's so much commotion going in the play-offs, and she helped me relax.\"\n\nThere was no mention of his dark past when he spoke to TMZ, just a lot of talk about \"positive energy\", \"star power\" and being \"the same dude from the 'hood\".\n\n\"I'm silly, I'm always doing something funny or whatever,\" Artest, who wants to be known as Mr World Peace when the change is finalised, said.\n\nHe did forget to tell his wife but said she and their children would keep Artest.\n\nHe was not sure if he had okayed the change with his NBA team but said he thought \"World Peace\" would look good on the back of the team's signature yellow singlets."
