        "text": "New York Knicks forward Metta World Peace reportedly had fluid drained from his left knee on Monday. Head coach Mike Woodson hopes that MWP can play tomorrow night against the Indiana Pacers. Per ESPN: “World Peace will miss Tuesday’s game against the Detroit Pistons. His status for Wednesday’s game against the Indiana Pacers is uncertain. World Peace missed Saturday’s game against the Atlanta Hawks with left knee soreness. When the discomfort didn’t subside, the team recommended that World Peace get fluid drained from his knee, sources said. The procedure is believed to be a minor one. World Peace, 34, is expected to return to the floor by the end of the week at the latest. It’s worth noting, though, that World Peace underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in the same knee in late March while with the Los Angeles Lakers. He was originally expected to miss at least six weeks but returned to the court just 12 days later. On Monday, Knicks coach Mike Woodson said World Peace would not travel with the team to Detroit due to a death in the family. His sister, Shalice Holmes-Taylor, died earlier this month. ‘Our condolences goes out to his family and Metta. But he’ll return soon,’ Woodson said.”"
