        "text": "Today is World Peace Day and there's no better way to celebrate than with some photos of Metta World Peace. The man formally known as Ron Artest (which is how we'll refer to him for the rest of this gallery) was born and raised in the Queensbridge projects in Queens, N.Y. and played high school ball at La Salle Academy, a private school in Manhattan. Artest was a McDonald's All-America selection and New York City's Co-Player of the Year after leading his team to a 27-0 record.\n\nAfter St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla caught one of Artest's AAU games, he recuited the Queens native to play for the Red Storm. Artest had a strong freshman year, averaging 11.6 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, and made the Big East's All-Rookie and All-Tournament teams. The Red Storm went 22-10 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1993.\n\nAfter Artest's freshman year, St. John's fired Fraschilla and replaced him with Mike Jarvis. Artest played well for Jarvis, averaging just under 15 points per game to go along with six rebounds and four assists. In this photo, Tarik Turner (left), Zendon Hamilton (second from left) and Artest (holding his daughter) cheer after it was announced that the Red Storm were a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament.\n\nSt. John's advanced to the Regional Finals for the first time in eight years and Artest was voted First-Team All-Big East and a finalist for the Wooden Award as the top college player. After the season, he announced his departure for the pros.\n\nArtest was suspended for the remainder of the 2004-05 season after the famous Pacers-Pistons brawl in Detroit. During his downtime, Artest appeared on NBC's \"Today Show\" to promote his rap album.\n\nArtest poses with Pacers team president Larry Bird before the 2005-06 season. A few weeks later, Artest demanded a trade and was placed on the inactive roster before being shipped to Sacramento for Peja Stojakovic.\n\nIn 2006, Artest released his first album, titled \"My World\" with some controversial lyrics about smoking up before games, hitting the liquor store at halftime and the NBA commissioner. \"David Stern! Damn, David Stern. I gotta teach you bout the ghetto there's some things you should learn.\""
