        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- An Artest, by any other name, plays the same.\n\nThat was Detroit Pistons guard Brandon Knight's perspective after a scuffle started when Metta World Peace -- the former Ron Artest -- grabbed him around the neck late in the first half of the Los Angeles Lakers' 98-97 win at The Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nWorld Peace was assessed a Flagrant-One foul and allowed to remain in the game. Knight insists World Peace threw a punch and should have faced a stiffer penalty after the incident, which occurred with 1:43 remaining in the first half.\n\n\"He threw a punch,\" Knight said. \"He held me at first. I was trying to push him off of me. ... That's when he threw a punch. That's when I tried to push him in the face, or whatever it was, whatever I did.\"\n\nReplays showed that while Knight was defending World Peace away from the ball, the latter threw something akin to a left uppercut while holding Knight around the neck with his right arm. The punch curled and, if landed, did so lightly with the wrist, not the fist.\n\nEven so, a punch usually draws more than a Flagrant-One and Knight said the NBA needs to reconsider the play.\n\n\"I was surprised the ref didn't see him throw that punch,\" Knight said. \"The play needs to be reviewed because he definitely threw a punch.\"\n\nWorld Peace, who under his former name was a central figure in a notorious Nov. 19, 2004 incident at The Palace of Auburn Hills which altered the way NBA teams handle security -- and which resulted in his league-imposed suspension for the rest of the 2004-05 season -- dismissed Knight's claim.\n\n\"If he says that, he says that,\" World Peace said of the punch accusation. \"Whatever. If he says it, whatever.\"\n\nAsked his version of the incident, World Peace was non-committal.\n\n\"I don't really remember,\" he said. \"He was trying his hardest to keep me out of the paint.\"\n\nAfter World Peace threw his left, Knight pushed off with his forearm and broke free.\n\n\"It felt like he threw a punch,\" Knight said. \"That's why I reacted the way I did.\"\n\nWorld Peace's initial decision to grab Knight around the neck seemed to come with no provocation.\n\n\"He just grabbed me,\" Knight said. \"I don't know what his reasoning was. I'm not just going to let nobody just grab me and have no response to it. You've got to hold your ground at some point. So I grabbed him and pushed him off of me and that was it.\n\n\"The play was over. The whistle had blown and he grabbed me around the neck. If somebody grabs me around the neck, I'm not going to just let that happen.\"\n\n--Download the Detroit Pistons on MLive app for iPhone and Android\n\n--Follow David Mayo on Twitter"
