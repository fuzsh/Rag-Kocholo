        "text": "Cunningham got to know and grew to love Artest throughout that time. At that point, he began serving in an expanded role as a producer at KHTK 1140 for several of the station’s hosts, including Grant Napear, Jim Kozimor and Carmichael Dave, while working as the station’s locker room reporter, far from the days of being a call screener for a golf show. Artest would frequently come into the studio for Carmichael Dave’s evening sports talk show. “I don’t know if that was therapeutic for him or if he just really enjoyed it,” Cunningham said. “You kind of saw a different side of an athlete and he was definitely different … He’d be the everyday guy with his quirks and his whatever that he would bring to work with him, but he was so passionate, he was such a hard worker,” said Cunningham, who remembers Artest getting a tooth knocked out during practice and not leaving, simply playing with the tooth in his hand.\n\nAre you talking with teams right now? Metta World Peace: I’m waiting for teams. I can still play. I can play, it’s not even a question man. But, you know, sometimes you don’t get in the game, man. What are you going to do? I’m not going to be upset, I’m going to support. So if I don’t play, like this year on the Lakers I could have averaged 15 or 20 on the Lakers if I played, easily. But you know, I’ll be supportive [if I don’t play]. But the only thing that gets me frustrated with the whole basketball is people think I can’t play anymore. So as a man, I take that personally. But at the same time I’m able to still focus on making sure Julius Randle is doing his thing, and he’s focused, making sure I can give back. But when the season’s over, then I like to explain that I can play, and I can bust people’s ass. But the fans have to understand, it’s not up to me. It’s so frustrating to keep hearing it from the fans. ‘Come back to New York, come to Chicago. Why didn’t you play.’ It’s so frustrating at times.\n\nThough he argued every recent officer involved in the fatal shootings should resign, World Peace acknowledged in general terms that “you can’t lock up every officer for making a mistake.” He believes officers should only serve in an area they previously have lived. And he explained why required psychology courses would diminish incidents. “You need police officers training to protect and serve, of course. But you can’t always be looking out for bad things,” World Peace said. “At the end of the day, if you train a pit bull to bite, the pit bull will bite.”"
