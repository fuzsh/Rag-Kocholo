        "text": "Leading into the network’s Saturday night lineup (Feb. 18), TNT will feature a series of original programs beginning with the NBA Talent Challenge, a competition featuring NBA players demonstrating their off-the-court talents, at 5 p.m. The talent show, produced by Turner Sports in association with Juma Entertainment, will feature eight finalists showing off their special skills, including Miami’s Chris Bosh playing guitar, Phoenix’s Devin Booker playing ping pong, Oklahoma City’s Victor Oladipo singing and Cleveland’s Iman Shumpert and the Lakers’ Metta World Peace and Lou Williams rapping. The telecast will be hosted by Johnson with Barkley, Smith and O’Neal serving as judges. Fan voting will determine the winner from a pool of five finalists.\n\nWorld Peace often forgets where the Lakers are and whom they’re playing. “When you’re in the NBA you don’t care about days of the week,” he said. “Days of the week are not important.” As he said that, Nick Young overheard and mumbled that he usually doesn’t know. “Friday?” Young said, guessing what day it was as he looked toward World Peace. “Wednesday?” World Peace countered, looking just as perplexed. It was Thursday."
