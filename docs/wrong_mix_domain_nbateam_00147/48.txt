NEW YORK -- Metta World Peace has been suspended one game without pay after the NBA confirmed that the Los Angeles Lakers forward hit Detroit Pistons guard Brandon Knight after clutching him around the neck in a game Sunday.

The league office's statement, released this afternoon, acknowledged that World Peace was suspended "for grabbing Brandon Knight around the neck and striking him in the jaw" during the Lakers' 98-97 win over the Pistons.

Stu Jackson, the NBA executive vice president of basketball operations, assessed the penalty after reviewing the incident, which occurred late in the first half.

World Peace will serve his suspension tonight when the Lakers play the Brooklyn Nets here.

World Peace grabbed Knight around the neck and was assessed a Flagrant-One foul. As Knight tried to break away, World Peace threw what appeared to be a short left uppercut. He curled the punch in an apparent effort to pull it.

Knight, normally reserved in media settings, grew animated when asked after the game about the incident and said it "needs to be reviewed because he definitely threw a punch."

World Peace denied throwing a punch when asked by MLive Media Group whether he had thrown one.

"If he says that, he says that," World Peace said of Knight's punch accusation. "Whatever. If he says it, whatever."

World Peace, when he went by his original name of Ron Artest, was a central figure in an infamous Nov. 19, 2004 incident at The Palace of Auburn Hills, while playing for the Indiana Pacers, a brawl which spilled over into the stands and resulted in his league-imposed suspension for the rest of the 2004-05 season.
