Their impact on my life, the creative process, and the completion of this project, cannot be overstated. Through this music, may you live forever.\n\nLove you!\n\nMichael Mayo appears courtesy of Mack Avenue Music Group\n\nPortuguese coaching from Gracinha Leporace and Kleber Jorge\n\nMom: You are the reason I do this nutty music thing! You and Pop’s patience all those years as I practiced far too loud for far too long in the basement made all of this happen. I love you and thank God for you always.\n\nSergio Mendes: You are a mentor and a trusted friend. You kept saying, “take your time” and I trusted you. What started as a conversation at dinner ended up becoming the inspiration for this album.\n\nDori Caymmi: You have been my role model as an arranger and composer since we met years ago. I’m honored with your friendship and your willingness to be a part of such a personal project for me.\n\nGuinga: You are one of the most inspiring composers I’ve ever heard. One session at Estúdio Nas Nuvens in Rio when you played “Trenzinho” for me and Sergio, became one of the first songs I worked on for this album. Thank you a million times over for your music and for playing as only you can.\n\nGracinha Leporace: Wow! Am I really singing with you? This is a dream come true and I can’t believe that it happened on my album. Love you more than you know.\n\nMichael Mayo: I’ve watched you grow as an artist and am humbled to have you contribute your very special gift on this album. Let’s do way more of this making-music-together thing. Love you, my amazing son!\n\nGibi dos Santos: you brought Bahia to the record and I love it. Your percussion made each song a beautiful journey. Muito obrigado meu irmão.\n\nLéo Costa: Without even knowing it, you became one of the heroes of this album. Your patience to help me get the music out of my head and into your drums was invaluable.\n\nAndre de Santanna: Why are you so good? You killed it on every song!\n\nKleber Jorge: The beauty of your playing and the strength of your swing is deep. Thank you for so many years of music together.\n\nKatie, Andre, Gibi, Harrell aka H2O, Kleber and Léo: Whether on the road or in the studio, I love all the music we make together.\n\nJamieson, Caio, Marcel: After hearing how incredible you guys played, it inspired me to play and sing even better. Thank you so, so much!\n\nValerie Pinkston: Your background vocal arrangement on “Don’t Say Goodbye” is crazy good! You, me and Michael sound killin’ together you know! The strength of our enduring friendship means the world to me.\n\nJavier Gonzalez, Andrew Lippman, Jerry Moore: Three of the baddest dudes in the land. We’ve played a lot of music together through the years. Somehow you manage to play all the craziness I write with ease. Thanks for blessing the walls of Pipewind with the beautiful sounds of your horns. Never forget, “top right!”\n\nScott Frankfurt: We did it! I knew from day one I wanted you to mix this album. You’ve created a sonic experience beyond anything I could imagine. The love you gave this music is evident on every bar of every song. Get your suit ready!\n\nSpecial thanks to every artist on this album. I simply cannot thank you enough for your gifts to me. Take note of their names, hire them and pay them well to bless your project. They’re worth it. You can thank me later!\n\nThis four-year journey of love started over a conversation at dinner. The last portion of this album was completed during the Pandemic and, thanks to technology, I was able to finish it even while receiving tracks from Stockholm, Manila, Rio and wherever folks happened to be at the time. I can’t say enough about the love of my life, my ride-or-die, Jen Guess-Mayo. Your support and patience through this process is invaluable. We did it! Love you, baby.\n\nScott Mayo is a Yamaha Performing Artist and exclusively plays Yamaha instruments.\n\n© Scott Mayo Music Inc, ℗ Mayo Naze Music BMI, 2022"
