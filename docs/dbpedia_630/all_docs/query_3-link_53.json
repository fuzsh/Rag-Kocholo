        "text": "String Instruments\n\nOur Violin, Viola, and Cello staff have extensive performance experiences and/or pedagogy degrees. Emphasis is placed on fundamentals and developing tone, technique and musicality as well as standard repertoire. We offer performance opportunities in the form of at least 2 recitals per year, string ensembles, and optional participation in worship band and other ensembles.\n\nOur standard instructors use the Suzuki method books alongside other curriculum. We accept students from age 6 and up, though exceptions are made on a case by case basis."
