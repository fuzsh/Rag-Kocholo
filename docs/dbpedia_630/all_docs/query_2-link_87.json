        "text": "IVAN LINS WITH SPECIAL GUESTS LEILA PINHEIRO AND DORI CAYMMI, LENY ANDRADE WITH SPECIAL GUEST OSCAR CASTRO-NEVES, & MÔNICA SALMASO\n\nKCRW's World Festival 2002\n\nSUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 7:30 PM\n\nThe Hollywood Bowl hosts a celebration of the 40th anniversary of bossa nova when Brazilian songwriter and jazzman Ivan Lins, performing with special guest vocalists Leila Pinheiro and guitarist/composer Dori Caymmi, takes the stage for The Beat of Brazil on September 8. Also appearing are singer Leny Andrade with special guest guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves, and vocalist Mônica Salmaso and her band.\n\nBackbeat Live pre-concert events take place at the Patio, one hour prior to the Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday concerts; free to all ticket holders. The September 8th session features a dance performance by local favorites Viver Brazil.\n\nThe \"romantic and sophisticated\" (The New York Times) music of Brazilian songwriter IVAN LINS has been recorded by such artists as George Benson, Quincy Jones, Toots Theilemans, The Crusaders, and Manhattan Transfer. Born in 1945, Lins came to fame in Brazil in 1970 when Elis Regina had a hit with Lins' \"Magdalena.\" His worldwide debut, \"A Noite,\" appeared in 1979. Ivan Lins' most famous composition, \"Love Dance,\" has been recorded by dozens of jazz artists including Sarah Vaughan, Betty Carter, Nancy Wilson and others. Lins has performed at the North Sea Jazz Festival, London's Royal Festival Hall, and the Monterey Jazz Festival. In September 2000, Telarc released A Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins featuring a stellar group of pop and jazz greats playing some of Lins' most famous material from a decidedly contemporary approach. Lins last played the Bowl in 1995.\n\nBrazilian vocalist LEILA PINHEIRO began studying the piano when she was 10 years old. In 1980, she made her singing debut in Belém and later moved to Rio de Janeiro where she recorded her first record, Leila Pinheiro, with Tom Jobim and Ivan Lins. Since then, she has recorded a string of albums with many musicians of note, including Pat Methany, Milton Nascimento, Jorge Ben Jor, Al Jarreau, and Sharon Isbin. Pinheiro has toured Europe, Japan, North America, and Israel. In 1996, she made her U.S. debut and performed at Carnegie Hall. She recently signed with Universal Music, who will be releasing a collection of live selections in the future. Pinheiro makes her Bowl debut with this performance.\n\nBorn in Rio in 1943, DORI CAYMMI is one of the most accomplished arrangers, composers, and guitartists of his generation working with the likes of Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Milton Nascimento, Tom Jobim, Djavan, Elis Regina, Maria Bethania, and many more. Since the late '60s he has also worked with a plethora of jazz musicians, especially in America, and since 1989 has lived in Los Angeles. He continues to produce his beautifully romantic and impressionist Brazilian music as on his most recent release, Cinema: A Romantic Vision.\n\nBorn in São Paulo in 1971, MÔNICA SALMASO has surfaced as one of the best young voices among the new talents of Brazil. She has recorded and performed with many important Brazilian artists such as Edu Lobo, Marlui Mira, and Guinga, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times describes her voice as \"quietly lustrous and sustained, suffusing each liquid note with languid secrets.\" She released her second album Voadeira (Blue Jackel) in 2002. This performance marks Salmaso's Bowl debut.\n\nLENY ANDRADE is universally recognized as the foremost singer of Brazilian jazz, bossa nova. Since the '60's at the Bottle's Bar in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, to her appearance at the Smithsonian Theater in Washington, DC in 1999, she has been refining the art of interpreting the songs of composers like the late Tom Jobim, her close friend and creator of Brazil's music movement bossa nova.\n\nVirtuoso guitarist, composer, arranger and producer OSCAR CASTRO-NEVES emerged as one of the founding figures of bossa nova in 1962, when he appeared at the first bossa nova concert in the U.S. at Carnegie Hall. As leader of his own quartet, Castro-Neves toured with the Dizzy Gillespie Quintet, the Stan Getz Quartet, the Lalo Schifrin Trio and the Laurindo Almeida Quartet, featuring Ray Brown, Shelley Mann, and Bud Shank. From 1971 until 1981, he was featured guitarist, musical director and vocal coach with Sergio Mendes' Brasil 66, touring extensively and recording over 15 albums. He has recorded with numerous artists including Quincy Jones, Ella Fitzgerald, Herbie Hancock, Barbra Streisand, Michael Jackson, Dave Grusin, Antonio Carlos Jobim, and João Gilberto. Castro-Neves produced the Grammy-award winning Soul of the Tango, with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. His film scores include Blame it on Rio and Gabriela. He last performed at the Hollywood Bowl in 1996.\n\nEDITORS PLEASE NOTE:\n\nSunday, September 8, 7:30 PM\n\nHOLLYWOOD BOWL (2301 N.
