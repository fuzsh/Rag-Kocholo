        "text": "Not only an exceptional guitarist with a wonderful sound and great fluidity, Chico Pinheiro is a composer of originality and maturity, qualities that stand out on his solo recordings. His albums, Meia Noite Meio Dia (2003), Chico Pinheiro (2005), NOVA (2007), There's a Storm Inside (2010), and TRIZ (2012), had the participation of artists such as Anthony Wilson, Dianne Reeves, Bob Mintzer, and Andre Mehmari. Pinheiro won several awards including: Top 10 Brazilian Albums of the Year, Best Latin Jazz Composition of 2010, and Best Latin Jazz Guitarist.\n\nPinheiro is a remarkable presence in and outside of the Brazilian music scene, distinguishing himself as a guitarist, composer, and arranger. He has performed and recorded with the cream of the crop of Brazilian artists such as Joyce, Ivan Lins, Rosa Passos, Dori Caymmi, Danilo Caymmi, and others. He has made his mark internationally, recording and playing with Placido Domingo, Brad Mehldau, Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, and Nnenna Freelon, among many others.\n\nThis workshop will also feature Oscar Stagnaro (bass), Mark Walker (drums), Gilson Schachnik (piano), Fernando Michelin (piano), and Fernando Brandao (flute)."
