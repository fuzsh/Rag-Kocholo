        "text": "Brazilian guitarist and singer. The son of Dorival Caymmi and Stella Maris and brother of Nana Caymmi and Danilo Caymmi's studied piano, guitar and music theory since childhood. His professional debut happened when he accompanied sister Nana on a concert. His main influence comes from his father, João Gilberto, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. In the 1960s, he became a producer, arranger and musical director. His career as a songwriter stood out in that same period, when he had songs interpreted by MPB-4 (\"Cantigo\"), Nana Caymmi (\"Saveiros\", with Nelson Motta) and Elis Regina (\"O Cantador\", with Nelson Motta) in festivals. In the 1970s, he wrote music scores for movies and television shows, and in the 80s he turned toward the international market, settling in Los Angeles. Dori's peculiar way of playing the guitar, with unconventional tunings and creative harmonies, has helped projecting his career outside of Brasil. Other hits: \"De Onde Vens\" (with N. Motta), recorded by Elis and Nara Leão, and \"Festa\", recorded by Jair Rodrigues, Elis and Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66.\n\nShow More"
