Joining the ensemble will be Duo Violão Brasil featuring two virtuoso guitarists from Brasil, Rogério Souza and Edinho Gerber. Don't miss these remarkable artists performing in our historic and acoustically-excellent hall.\n\nThe Artists:\n\nBerkeley Choro Ensemble\n\nHarvey Wainapel - sax & clarinet\n\nJane Lenoir - flute\n\nRicardo Peixoto - guitar\n\nBrian Rice - percussion\n\nDuo Violão Brasil\n\nRogério Souza - guitar\n\nEdinho Gerber - guitar\n\nAbout the Concert:\n\nThe Berkeley Choro Ensemble joins forces with Duo Violão Brasil to present a diverse program of compositions showcasing a history of Brazilian Popular Music. The group will appear in duo, trio and full ensemble settings, featuring works by some of the great composers in Brazil , including Pixinguinha, Baden Powell, Ernesto Nazareth, and others.\n\nAbout the Ensembles:\n\nThe Berkeley Choro Ensemble (pronounced \"shoro\"), is a group of world-class musicians from the SF Bay Area that made its debut in January, 2010, at the Berkeley Public Library. The group celebrates the music, culture and history of Brazil, with a special emphasis on the Choro genre, a style of music which emerged in the 1800's in Brazil, fusing the music of Brazil's European immigrants and the native music of Brazil's indigenous and African-Brazilian population. In particular, the choro sound is somewhat akin to a combination of European classical music, ragtime, and blues. Historically, the choro style influenced Brazil's most famous classical composer, Heitor Villa Lobos, to compose some of the world's most hauntingly beautiful music, the Bachianas Brasileiras. Our repertoire also includes samba, bossa nova, jazz, and the music of Northeast Brazil.\n\nDuo Violão Brasil is the result of guitarists Rogério Souza and Edinho Gerber's reverence for Brazilian guitar, the “violão”, and their desire to explore and expand the musical possibilities of putting two “violões\" together. With repertoire from composers like Pixinguinha, Baden Powell, and Tom Jobim, the duo navigates effortlessly through the many styles of 20th century Brazilian popular music while showcasing original works and inventive arrangements.\n\nAbout the Artists:\n\nFrom a family of professional musicians, flutist Jane Lenoir grew up in Tampa, Florida, and left home at 15 as a scholarship student to the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan and then to Oberlin Conservatory of Music. A performer comfortable in many diverse styles, Jane appears regularly as a soloist, chamber player, orchestral musician, and jazz performer. She first began her study of Brazilian music in 2006, and has since performed with Marcos Silva, Jovino Santos Neto, Hermeto Pascoal, and recorded with Carlos Oliveira and Ceilia Medeiros, Live at Anna's Jazz Island and Brazilian Choro 2009. In 2010 she visited Brazil and studied with Hermeto Pascoal, Jovino Santos Neto, Paulo Sergio Santos, Allessandro Pennezzi and Ted Falcon. She is principal flutist with the Music in the Mountains Festival Orchestra in Grass Valley, and also performs with Sexteto Matiz, an Afro-Cuban ensemble, and numerous jazz, and new music and chamber ensembles in styles ranging from early music (baroque flute) to free improvisation.\n\nSaxophonist/clarinetist Harvey Wainapel (pronounced \"wine-apple\") has performed with the likes of McCoy Tyner, Joe Lovano, Ray Charles, Dave Brubeck, and Joe Henderson. Besides working with these and numerous other leaders, Wainapel has toured extensively under his own name, and has performed in 22 countries. His heavy involvement with the music of Brazil has led to performances with top-level musicians such as Airto Moreira, Flora Purim, Dori Caymmi, Guinga, and Jovino Santos Neto. Wainapel was a featured soloist on two CDs that were final nominees for Latin Grammy Awards™ \"Best Latin Jazz Recording\" (with Jovino Santos Neto in 2004 and with Mark Levine in 2003). Harvey has been called \"one of the most promising and versatile players of his generation\" (All Music Guide to Jazz 1998)\n\nOriginally from Rio de Janeiro and based in the Bay Area, guitarist/composer Ricardo Peixoto is among the top representatives of Brazilian guitar in the US, with a fluid melodic style and a keen compositional sense. His performances explore Brazil's rich and diverse traditions, both in his original work as well as in arrangements of Brazilian classics. His approach is grounded both in the jazz and Brazilian music traditions, but always ventures well beyond their borders, combining rich melodies, sophisticated harmonies, and the unmistakable rhythms of Brazil. Ricardo came to the US on a scholarship to the Berkeley School of Music in Boston, and later continued his studies in classical guitar at the SF Conservatory of Music. He has recorded, performed, and collaborated with, among others, Claudia Villela, Flora Purim and Airto, saxophonist Bud Shank, percussionist Dom Um Romão, Toots Thielemans, Dori Caymmi, Guinga, guitarist Carlos Oliveira, Harvey Wainapel, Marcos Silva and Terra Sul. He has performed throughout the US, Europe, Canada, Japan and Brazil.\n\nPercussionist Brian Rice graduated from the Interlochen Arts Academy and Oberlin College Conservatory of Music with a B.M. in Percussion Performance and Ethnomusicology. A well-rounded musician, Brian is a highly acclaimed performer, educator and recording artist adept at numerous musical styles ranging from classical and jazz, to Latin, Afro-Cuban, and Brazilian, to contemporary and experimental music. Brian's study of the Brazilian pandeiro began in 1986 when the Sao Paulo State University percussion ensemble visited Oberlin and percussionist/composer Carlos Stasi, then a student at SPSU, gave Brian a quick pandeiro lesson after the concert. Since then Brian's obsession with the pandeiro has led him to study with Guello, Marcos Suzano, Airto, Claudio Bueno and Clarice Magalhaes, and his prowess on the instrument has led him to perform with numerous Brazilian artists including, Jovino Santos Neto, Paulo Sergio Santos, Danilo Brito, Dudu Maia and Jorge Alabe. It was studies with Marcos Suzano that inspired Brian to expand his use of the pandeiro outside the Brazilian music world and apply it to Balkan, Celtic, Middle Eastern, Spanish, and Cuban music with great effect.\n\nSon of a Brazilian mother and American father, guitarist and composer Edinho Gerber possesses a rich musical vocabulary developed in the two countries where he was raised: the United States and Brazil. Navigating effortlessly between the genres of choro, jazz, samba, and blues, he is always in search of the intersection points within his dual cultural identity. A staple in the Chicago music scene for many years, he was a highly in demand sideman having played with countless U.S. based Brazilian groups, including Som Brasil, Renato Anesi Trio, A Cor do Brasil, and led the samba-jazz group Zona Sul. He has performed in prestigious festivals and concerts in throughout the United States, Russia, and Japan, and currently resides in Rio de Janeiro where he performs regularly with Duo Violão Brasil and is preparing for the upcoming releases of his debut solo album and of an inventive new cross cultural collaboration with Ben Lamar.\n\nRogério Souza is a guitarist, composer and arranger from Rio de Janeiro. He is one of the most important representatives of the genuine Brazilian guitar tradition. Has since his professional debut in the early 1980's been involved in big events in the Brazilian popular music, specially the choro and the samba, participating as musician, arranger and music director in tv sessions, recordings and concerts. Rogério has played and recorded with a variety of Brazilian top-artists, including Baden Powell, Sivuca, Raphael Rabello, Turibio Santos, Paulinho da Viola, João Bosco, Ney Matogrosso, Ivan Lins, Elizeth Cardoso, Dona Ivone Lara, Elsa Soares, Zélia Duncan, Leila Pinheiro, Paulo Moura, Guinga, Altamiro Carrilho, Cristóvão Bastos and the choro-group Época De Ouro.\n\nAllessandro Penezzi, Jane Lenoir & Friends\n\nIn Concert\n\nSunday 27 August 2017 at 3:00pm\n\nThe Berkeley Hillside Club is delighted to present the brilliant São Paulo guitarist and composer Allessandro Penezzi, flutist Jane Lenoir, and friends in a concert celebrating the release of Jane's new CD, \"Jane Lenoir plays Penezzi.\" The concert will feature Penezzi's original compositions. Don't miss these remarkable artists performing in our historic and acoustically-excellent hall.\n\nThe artists:\n\nAlessandro Penezzi - guitar\n\nJane Lenoir - flute\n\nBrian Rice - pandiero\n\nothers tba\n\nAbout the Concert:\n\nEvery year in late summer in Cazadero, CA, a unique, weeks-long musical retreat called \"Brazil Camp\" draws top musicians from Brazil and around the world to perform, share, teach, learn and enjoy the wide variety of musical forms of Brazil; forms like choro, baião, maxixe, waltz, lullaby, chamamé and more. This year we are extremely fortunate to be able to \"borrow\" one of the Camp's star faculty, the renowned Brazilian guitarist and composer, Allessandro Penezzi, to perform for us. Performing with Penezzi will be virtuoso flutist, Jane Lenoir, whose new CD features Penezzi's original compositions. Joining these two remarkable artists will be another member of the Brazil Camp faculty, Brian Rice, on pandiero. And we wouldn't be surprised if other talented players joined in the fun!\n\nAbout the Artists:\n\nConsidered one of the great Brazilian guitarists of his generation, composer, arranger and guitarist Allesandro Penezzi was born in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil.

The CSQ previewed Part I of the piece at the Club last October to great acclaim and they are now returning with the complete work. Also on the program is a suite of Russian folksongs, performed by the brilliant vocalist Lily Storm, and the premiere of a new work \"Rites\" written especially for the CSQ by Benjamin Leeds Carson. Don't miss these remarkable artists performing in our historic and acoustically-excellent hall.\n\nThe Circadian String Quartet are:\n\nSarah Wood & David Ryther - violins\n\nOmid Assadi - viola\n\nDavid Wishnia - cello\n\nwith special guest:\n\nLily Storm - vocals\n\nAbout the Concert:\n\nThe Circadian String Quartet presents \"Rhythm, Revolution and Ritual: The Rite of Spring Re-imagined.” the first concert in a series of three programs developed to explore the revolutionary sound world from Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring and its links to the explosive events of the decades from which it sprung. This iconic 20th century masterpiece, which infamously caused a riot at its 1913 premiere, struck a powerful nerve in a Europe wracked by political and social tension. Since then, the music has provoked unending fascination with its mix of French harmonies & deep, primal Russian roots. This concert features the Circadian's own version of Stravinsky's masterpiece transcribed for string quartet and percussion.\n\nFor Stravinsky, revolutionary meant making use of ancient Russian folk music. In that spirit CSQ also presents Russian folksongs in collaboration with the brilliant singer, Lily Storm. We are also proud to present the premiere of composer Benjamin Leeds Carson's \"Rites,\" written especially for CSQ as a companion piece for the Rite of Spring. \"Rites\" takes Stravinsky's primal rhythms as a jumping off point for a sometimes humorous and sometimes poignant adventure in rhythmic ritual.\n\nThe Program:\n\nRussian Folk Songs sung by Lily Storm\n\n'Rites\" for String Quartet (3 movements) - Benjamin Leeds Carson\n\nThe Rite of Spring: Scenes of Pagan Rus’ in Two Parts - Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971)\n\nPart I - L'Adoration de la Terre (Adoration of the Earth)\n\nPart II - Le Sacrifice (The Sacrifice)\n\n(Transcribed for String Quartet and Percussion by David Ryther)\n\nThe Ensemble:\n\nBay Area based Circadian String Quartet was founded in 2013 to promote the classical and contemporary string quartet repertoire, in particular music of cultural and folkloric significance.

These pieces have become known as the \"Late Quartets.\" At the time of their composition, however, Beethoven's contemporaries didn't know what to make of them; one commented that \"we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is.\" Composer and conductor Louis Spohr called them \"indecipherable, uncorrected horrors.\" Since that time, however, these works have become revered by generations musicians, scholars, and listeners alike, and indeed sound modern even in the 21st Century. For this concert the Sun Valley Players will be performing one of these venerated works, \"String Quartet No.12 in Eb Major, Op. 127.\"\n\nThe young Dvorak composed his String Quartet No. 5 in F minor early in his career but abandoned it. Seven years later, as his fame spread, he took the lovely, lyrical cantabile from the Quartet and turned into the exquisite miniature that is his \"Romance in F minor, Op.11.\"\n\nThe beautiful cello-bass duo \"Bariolage\" by Shinji Eshima has a multitude of local connections. The piece was commissioned for S.F Symphony players Amos Yang and Charles Chandler in 2015, and Eshima himself was born in Berkeley and is currently a member of the S.F Opera and S.F.
