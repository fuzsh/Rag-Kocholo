        "text": "MúsicaBrasileira\n\nPost by Duane Shimizu\n\nHowever, on track 2 of the album, which is titled\n\n\"Romance,\" Paulo Cesar Pinheiro is given credit as one of the song's\n\nauthors, so there must a Portuguese version somewhere.\n\nDuane,\n\nI was also very puzzled with that after your note. Listening to Sarah's\n\nrendition, I kept hearing that song in Nana Caymmi's voice. So, I began\n\nlistening to Nana's CDs... I checked with a friend of mine, too, and I\n\nbelieve we have the song figured out. We believe it's \"Velho Piano.\"\n\nIt was recorded by Nana, Dori and even Fafá de Belém (in that nice MPB\n\nalbum she did in 2000. Anyway, the rendition with Nana & Cesar Camargo\n\nMariano is outstanding.\n\n--\n\nEgídio\n\nhttp://thebml.com/\n\nhttp://MusicaBrasileira.org/\n\nBR6 David Pietro Heloísa Fernandes\n\nLenine & +\n\nDaniella Thompson\n\nOn [Sarah's 'Brazilian Romance'] album [...] on track 2 of the album,\n\nwhich is titled \"Romance,\" Paulo Cesar Pinheiro is given credit as\n\none of the song's authors, so there must a Portuguese version\n\nsomewhere.\n\nThere is. The original is also called \"Romance.\" It received its first\n\nrecording by the very talented paulista singer Ney Mesquita, who died\n\nlast year at the age of 36 (if memory serves).\n\nNey's CD, titled 'Canções de Dorival e Dori Caymmi' (Dabliú DB 0049)\n\nis wonderful. Eduardo Gudin arranged all the tracks and plays violão\n\non some of them.\n\nIn my July 2001 article on Dabliú Discos I wrote this about the disc:\n\n\"This fine album was released before the recent spate of Caymmi\n\ntributes, and it's a mystery why it never emerged from obscurity, given\n\nthe imaginative choice of material, the singer's beautiful voice and\n\ninterpretations, and the excellent arrangements by Eduardo Gudin, who\n\nalso produced and plays guitar on some tracks. The repertoire is\n\ndivided almost equally between the father's and the son's\n\ncompositions.\"\n\n\"Romance\" is a voice & piano recording. The pianist is Rogério\n\nRochlitz.\n\nI could post the lyrics if desired.\n\n--\n\nDaniella\n\n_______\n\nDaniella Thompson on Brazil:\n\nThe Magazine of\n\nBrazilian Music & Culture\n\nhttp://daniv.blogspot.com\n\nMusica Brasiliensis\n\nhttp://daniellathompson.com"
