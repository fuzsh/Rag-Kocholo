Some say that excellence in your craft and focusing on society are mutually exclusive, but I beg to differ. The masters I’ve worked with, some of the most important names in the history of music, are not only very successful, they’re also humanitarians.\n\n“In music we talk a lot about earth, wind, fire, and water. As a bassist, you have to love being the ‘earth.’ You have to understand the absolute responsibility and power of being the earth. That means providing that solid foundation—time and groove—and creating a feeling that frees up the rest of the band to play. It means being willing to make selfless choices to make the whole picture sound good.\n\n“A great rhythmic power and feeling opens the door to communicating with any kind of music. After that your sound has to be beautiful enough to engage people. If you have everything else intellectually, but don’t have that rhythm and sound, no one will want to listen. Those who get that in their head sooner rather than later are the ones who improve faster.”"
