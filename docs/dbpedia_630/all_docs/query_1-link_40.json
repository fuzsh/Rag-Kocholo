        "text": "ARTIST BIO\n\n“…One of the best singers of all times!… As if it weren’t enough, Joyce is a great composer and plays ace guitar! What an amazing woman!” Antonio Carlos Jobim, 1987.\n\n“Joyce is a Brazilian treasure” DownBeat magazine, 2010.\n\n“Her musical capacity surprised me when, years later, she reemerged playing guitar like the best (in the land of João Gilberto, Dori [Caymmi], [Gilberto] Gil, and João Bosco, this is not a bagatelle), her singing precisely tuned, writing songs with original harmonic and melodic imagination.” Caetano Veloso – 2011\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, the singer, composer, arranger and instrumentalist JOYCE MORENO has in her portfolio 400 recordings of songs she has authored, interpreted by the greatest names in Brazilian popular music: Elis Regina, Gal Costa, Maria Bethânia, Milton Nascimento, Ney Matogrosso, Edu Lobo, Emilio Santiago, Boca Livre, Nana Caymmi, Zizi Possi, Elizeth Cardoso, Simone, Leny Andrade, Mônica Salmaso, and many others. Beyond Brazil, Joyce’s work has been recorded by Annie Lennox, Wallace Roney, Omara Portuondo, Black Eyed Peas, David Sanchez, Jon Lucien, Claus Ogerman, Gerry Mulligan, Till Brönner, and Flora Purim, to name a few. Joyce’s compositions have been featured in film soundtracks (e.g., The Player by Robert Altman and Legally Blonde by Robert Luketic), animations (the Japanese anime Wolf’s Rain, in partnership with composer Yoko Kanno), TV programs, and theatrical productions. Since the beginning of her career, Joyce’s registered trademark has been the first-person feminine voice, which she pioneered; she was the first Brazilian songwriter to express herself in this form, opening the way for countless other artists who followed.\n\nJoyce received four nominations for the Latin Grammy. To date, she has released 33 personal CDs and two DVDs, in addition to numerous compilations and guest appearances. Currently, her work takes her all over the world; she makes annual tours and records new albums in various countries, never losing her feminine Brazilian identity. Each year she performs on the Japanese Blue Note circuit and tours jazz festivals and other venues in Europe and North America.\n\nIn 1997, Joyce broadened her creative output with the publication of her first book, Fotografei Você na Minha Rolleyflex (editora MultiMais), a behind-the-scenes memoir of her early career. From 1998 to 2000, she wrote a weekly column in the Rio daily O Dia.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002, Joyce created an original TV project, the series Cantos do Rio, which presented a panorama of MPB and its creators in Rio de Janeiro. In 2010/2011, Joyce conceived and presented another series for MultiRio: No Compasso da História, Brazil’s history told through popular song in 15 documentaries.\n\nPhoto Credit: Leo Aversa"
