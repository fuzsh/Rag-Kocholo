        "text": "New Jazz News – 3/30/2021\n\nHannah Baiardi – Straight From The Soul (Self-produced): “Michigan-born jazz pianist, vocalist, composer and arranger, Hannah Baiardi is committed to “moving jazz forward.” Hannah’s sound is original and contemporary, drawing upon soul/jazz/pop influences in addition to more traditional jazz artists. Learning by ear, she started playing piano and writing her first songs when she was three. Composing since three, Hannah has crafted a unique sound that lets the subtleties and nuances of her music speak. Her lush harmonies and memorable melodies contribute to a sophisticated sound beyond her years. Known to some as the “unstoppable ear,” Hannah is developing a reputation as a composer/arranger, working with other artists and creating songs with unusual instrumentation. She began transcribing Oscar Peterson by ear at the age of seven and went on to attend the University of Michigan Jazz Studies program where she studied with Ellen Rowe, Geri Allen, and Benny Green. Hannah prefers to blur the lines between genres, marrying the sensibility of jazz with the soul of R&B and the acoustic depth of film music. She welcomes collaboration with artists who are passionate, soulful, and who create music beyond any one genre. Since graduating, Hannah has made it her mission to break barriers between genres and debunk musical stereotypes. She believes, now more than ever, artists should honor their authentic sound regardless of genre. Strongly influenced by Sade, Michael Franks, George Winston, Seal, Babyface, Teena Marie, Diana Krall, Chris Botti, Michel Legrand, Jose James, and Kandace Springs, Hannah positions herself firmly in the Contemporary jazz space with her soulful and evocative approach. Hannah’s music evokes deep feelings and contemplation. Her lyrics radiate empowering messages of hope and her music is listenable and relatable.” (https://www.hannahbaiardi.com/about) She sums things up, ““I am often considered jazzy – not quite (pure) jazz. I am learning to be ok with being somewhere in the middle, as my influences are broad for a “jazz” artist. I truly believe we need to broaden our ears and accept that jazz is evolving. I hope to remain true to my ever-evolving sound and channel the purest form of my musicality. I hope my music brings you a measure of joy and solace.” (https://www.hannahbaiardi.com/about) Click here to listen to the songs on this disc.\n\nYelena Eckemoff – Adventures Of The Wildflower (Self-produced): “Yelena was born in Moscow, Russia, in the Soviet Union. Her parents noticed that she had musical talent when she started to play piano by ear at the age of four. Yelena’s mother, Olga, a professional pianist, became her first piano teacher. At the age of seven Yelena was accepted into an elite Gnessins School for musically gifted children where, in addition to common school subjects, she received extensive training in piano, music theory, music literature, solfeggio, harmony, analysis of musical forms, conducting, composing, and other musical subjects. She was fortunate to study piano with Anna Pavlovna Kantor…Although jazz is associated with improvisation, Eckemoff often writes her tunes out. Her music has been described as classical chamber music in the context of improvisational jazz. She developed a highly acclaimed jazz style that incorporates her classical technique and influences very effectively. With each new record Eckemoff’s distinctive, recognizable approach to melody becomes even more prominent. Yelena Eckemoff uses life and nature’s bouquets as her muse to create the body of work that blends post-modern abstraction, classical thought, and jazz language into a seamless whole.” (https://yelenamusic.com/home/about-yelena/) Backing up Eckemoff’s composing and piano are Tarmo Snari (guitars, theremin, glass harp), Jukka Perko (soprano and tenor sax), Panu Savolainen (vibes), Antti Lotjjonen (bass) and Olavi Louhivuori (drums, percussion). The performances are wonderful!

In fact, he’s the only member who’s been in the group since its inception in 1980. Outside of his Yellowjackets tenure, Ferrante has also recorded and toured with an incredible array of artists, including Lee Ritenour, Joni Mitchell, Larry Carlton, Robben Ford, George Michael, Take 6, Michael Franks, Dave Grusin, and many more. However, throughout his lengthy and successful career, Ferrante had yet to release an album containing his own material – until now – as he’s teamed-up with bassist Michael Valerio and drummer Steve Schaeffer to create the Russell Ferrante Trio and the new album “Inflexion”, which is available now on Blue Canoe Records. The 11 track album contains a mix of originals, covers, and a couple of new arrangements of Yellowjackets tunes.” (https://www.insidemusicast.com/musicasts/2020/25/01-russell-ferrante) Ferrante comments: “Inflexion or inflection comes from the Latin root inflexionem meaning to bend in, to change direction. This music is indeed very personal and intimate and one could say it bends it.” The music is wonderful from end to end and closes with a beautiful and reverent performance of “We Shall Overcome”. Click here for an introduction to this release by Russell Ferrante.\n\nMakram Aboul Hosn – Transmigration (Self-produced): “Makram Aboul Hosn is a frequent performer in the Beirut music scene. You could find him on different stages playing Jazz, Rock, Classical, and Arabic music with different groups all within the same week. Currently working as a Jazz instructor at NDU, he also composes music for his own projects, and writes blogs on music and art/community. Makram plays both electric and upright bass in a variety of styles. He writes Classical works for small chamber ensembles, and Jazz compositions for small and large ensembles of improvisers… After receiving a grant from The Arab Funds for Arts and Culture (AFAC), Makram recorded his second album “Transmigration”, featuring eight of Makram’s compositions. The music was written for 5 saxophones, flutes, vibraphone, vocals, bass, drums, and percussion.” (https://makramusic.com/Home) “On first listen, Transmigration is a swinging album which, with rich orchestrations that run through quintet through to 11-piece ensemble, showcases the intricate arranging skills of its bandleader Makram.\n\nBut, as the name suggests, the music doesn’t rest there. Through-composed ensemble sections, free improvisations and extended percussion features all contribute to make this an album which demands repeated listening, highlighting Makrams broad range of influences which encompass everything from Thad Jones/Mel Lewis, Monk & Mingus to Stravinsky and Ali Farka Touré.” (https://jazzfuel.com/project/makram-aboul-hosn-transmigration/) The music is tricky and delightful all at once. Intriguing and quite enjoyable.

Both of them have a very distinct sound and they fit perfectly to our quintet. The music comes in equal parts from my long-time JBBG – JAZZ BIGBAND GRAZ partner Horst-Michael Schaffer, keyboardist Uli Rennert and myself. After two days we were done and very satisfied – and had material for at least two productions! I believe that we developed something very special with this band and we do have a lot of fun – of and on the stage as well as the studio.” (Heinrich von Kalnein; https://www.natangomusic.com/releases/times-of-change-vol-1/) Thomas Wilding (electric bass) and Tom Stabler (drums, electronics) completed the rhythm section. It’s an interesting blend.

His main instrument is the vibraphone, but he also plays many other percussion instruments. Lackerschmid grew up in Ehingen and now lives in Augsburg, where he operates a recording studio. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Lackerschmid) He has released 16 recordings as a leader, including this new release. I regret that I cannot find any samples on line, but there is some variety as players change from time time. The set is quite listenable.\n\nDavid Larsen – The Mulligan Chronicles (Self-produced): “This album is the result of years of research into the music of Gerry Mulligan. After pouring through hundreds of scores, transcribing many solos, and interviewing a number of players, I have released 13 of my favorite Gerry Mulligan tunes. It was recorded with 4 musicians who all played with Gerry Mulligan. Dean Johnson on Bass, Dave Glenn on Trombone, Bill Mays on Piano, and Ron Vincent on Drums. These world class players bring a familiarity and quality to the music that is just unmatched.” (https://larsenjazz.bandcamp.com/album/the-mulligan-chronicles) This was obviously a labor of admiration for Mulligan’s style. Click here to listen to “Walkin’ Shoes”, the opening performance and a Mulligan original.\n\nJohn Patitucci / Vinnie Colaiuta / Bill Cunliffe – Trio (Le Coq): “John Patitucci was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1959 and began playing the electric bass at age ten. He began performing and composing at age 12, at age 15 began to play the acoustic bass, and then started the piano at age 16. He quickly moved from playing soul and rock to blues, jazz and classical music. His eclectic tastes caused him to explore all types of music as a player and a composer. John studied classical bass at San Francisco State University and Long Beach State University. In 1980, he continued his career in Los Angeles as a studio musician and a jazz artist. As a studio musician, John has played on countless albums with artists such as B. B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Was Not Was, Dave Grusin, Natalie Cole, Bon Jovi, Sting, Queen Latifah and Carly Simon. In 1986, John was voted by his peers in the studios as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences MVP on Acoustic Bass. As a performer, John has played throughout the world with his own band and with jazz luminaries Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Stan Getz, Pat Metheny, Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Michael Brecker, McCoy Tyner, Nancy Wilson, Randy Brecker, Freddie Hubbard, Tony Williams, Hubert Laws, Hank Jones, Mulgrew Miller, James Williams, Kenny Werner and scores of others. Some of the many pop and Brazilian artists he has played with include Sting, Aaron Neville, Natalie Cole, Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Milton Nascimiento, Astrud and Joao Gilberto, Airto and Flora Purim, Ivan Lins, Joao Bosco and Dori Caymmi. John has also worked with film composers Jerry Goldsmith, Ry Cooder, James Newton Howard, Dave Grusin, Henry Mancini, and many others. Since 1985, his association with Chick Corea has brought him worldwide acclaim and put him at the forefront of the jazz world. His many recordings with Chick Corea’s Elektric Band and Akoustic Band, his six solo recordings for GRP Records and his subsequent recordings have brought him two Grammy Awards (one for playing and one for composing)….” (https://www.johnpatitucci.com/bio.html) Click here to listen to the songs on this release.\n\nSchapiro 17 – Human Qualities (Summit): “Human Qualities is the follow-up to the 2020 debut, New Shoes: Kind of Blue at 60. This recording brings back the 17 members of the progressive New York big band. Unlike New Shoes, which offers a thematic focus on Kind of Blue, Human Qualities features seven Jon Schapiro originals and one arrangement – featuring a powerhouse rhythm section, fiercely swinging ensembles, and sterling solo work: Bryan Davis, Andy Gravish, Eddie Allen, Noyes Bartholomew (trumpets); Alex Jeun, Deborah Weisz, Nick Grinder, Walter Harris (trombones): Rob Wilkerson, Candace DeBartolo, Paul Carlon, Rob Middleton, Matt Hong (saxophones); Roberta Piket (piano); Sebastian Noelle (guitar); Evan Gregor (bass) and Jon Wikan (drums). All but one song are original compositions by Jon Schapiro and the style draws the listener to follow the changes as the music charts its own texture. Click here to listen the songs on this release.\n\nJared Sims – Analogy Of The Sun (MCG Jazz): “For this powerful collaboration with Rufus Reid and Matt Wilson, Jared Sims drew inspiration from “The Analogy of the Sun,” the sixth book of Plato’s Republic, in which Plato defines goodness in the world. Defining goodness in the world is the underlying theme of Sims’ music and his original compositions on Analogy of the Sun serve to express that which cannot be easily expressed by words. Sims remarks, “Right now we live in a society that is divided by unanswered questions and this ancient philosophy could be the key to understanding and resolving our current conflicts.” (https://martyashby.com/music/analogy-of-the-sun/) ““I was really trying to do two things when putting this album together,” Sims said. “First, to try to find joy in the world and provide tunes that are both introspective and structurally organic and also give the players a launch pad to explore their playing.” Defining goodness in the world is the underlying theme of Sims’ music and his original compositions on “Analogy of the Sun” serve to express that which cannot be easily expressed by words. I think listeners will be intrigued by the sound of the instrumentation of the lead players,” Sims said. “I can only think of a very small number of albums that have a flute and trombone or a baritone saxophone and trombone as the front line of horns. Perhaps most importantly, I hope listeners know there is a seriousness to the music, but we enjoy playing and hope that some of the moods of the tunes resonate with them when they hear it.” (https://arts.wvu.edu/news/2021/02/23/-wvu-jazz-director-set-for-new-music-release) Sims plays bari sax and flute and is accompanied by Reggie Watkins (trombone), Clifford Barnes (organ), Rufus Reid (bass) and Matt Wilson (drums).

Well-known for his work with soul jazz legends and with groups based around the Hammond B-3 organ, this date is surprisingly Skaff’s first recording in the past 30+ years leading a guitar trio alone without piano or organ. It’s also special set for the legendary reunion of Carter and Heath who worked together with history making results in the early 60s with guitarist Wes Montgomery and on a landmark recording with pianist Bobby Timmons. But, they have collaborated only once since. Skaff takes full advantage of this inspirational setting delivering an album all three are immensely proud of.” (https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/greg-skaff/polaris) This set honors the original performances and also “applies” a new coat of paint to the originals. Click here to listen to the title song.\n\nThrottle Elevator Music – Final Floor (Wide Hive): “Final Floor is eleven new tracks featuring saxophonist Kamasi Washington and trumpeter Erik Jekabson with longtime collaborators and songwriters Matt Montgomery and Gregory Howe. Joining them are Mike Hughes on drums, Kasey Knudsen on Alto Saxophone, Ross Howe on Fender Guitar and Mike Blankenship on organ. As the title indicates, this album represents the final original recordings of Throttle Elevator Music. Final Floor has an upscale energy with elements of rock and punk that fuel the overall sound and dynamically bring an edge back to jazz.” (https://www.widehive.com/discography/finalfloor) Click here to listen to “Caste Off” as the “Final Floor” approaches.\n\nKopasetically,\n\nProfessor Bebop"
