        "text": "Zeca Baleiro\n\nA multi-artist – singer, composer, writer – Zeca Baleiro was revealed on 1997, when Gal Costa recorded his song ‘À Flor da pele”. From then, he recorded several albums and contribute to soundtracks for many TV soap operas and theater productions in Brazil. He also writes musical for children. His “Samba do Approach” is a remarkable example of the vivacity of the Samba genre.\n\nZelia Duncan\n\nShe started her career in 1981, however, only in 1990 launched her first album, ‘Outra Luz’. The success came in 1994 with a new album, ‘Zelia Duncan’. Her remarkable voice makes her one of the best pop-rock singers and composers of Brazil. For some years, she replaced Rita Lee in the classic band “Os Mutantes”, that has its origins in the Tropicalia movement of the 1960s.\n\nLuiz Melodia\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, in one of the most traditional samba neighborhoods, São Carlos, Luiz Melodia is a perfect synthesis of the vitality of Brazilian music. This singer and songwriter produced samba, bossa nova, rock, blues, soul. His most famous song was ‘Codinome Beija-Flor’, recorded by Cazuza in 1989. Luiz Melodia died in August 2017, victim of a bone cancer. Another one revealed by Gal Costa.\n\nRoberta Sá\n\nBorn in 1980, Roberta Sá is one of the revelations of the Brazilian music. Her first album is from 2005, ‘Braseiro’. According to herself, this album is “a declaration of love to the Popular Brazilian music”. The album “Quando o canto é reza” (2010), is a truly encyclopedia of Brazilian popular music.\n\nMaria Rita\n\nDaughter of the Diva, Elis Regina, and the pianist Cesar Camargo Mariano, Maria Rita started her career in 2003 with a solo album that sold more than one million copies. She won 3 Grammy Latino in 2004. It is like the blessing of your mother is over her. She covers a vast repertoire and her interpretation of ‘Encontros e Despedidas’ (by Milton Nascimento) is unique.\n\nAlice Caymmi\n\nAnother great example of family tradition in the Brazilian music, Alice Caymmi is granddaughter of Dorival Caymmi, daughter of Danilo Caymmi and niece of Nana and Dori Caymmi. Alice released her first album in 2012, proving that the music of the family was really in her blood. Original voice and creative way of dialoguing tradition and contemporary Brazilian music.\n\nMart’nália\n\nSinger, composer, percussionist and multi-instrument player, Mart’nália is daughter of the great sambista Martinho da Vila and the singer Anália Mendonça. She is a prove of the renovation of the samba. In her album, ‘Menino do Rio’, she revives majestically the homonymous song by Caetano Veloso and “Estacio, holy Estacio”, by Luiz Melodia.\n\nLenine\n\nBorn in 1959, Lenine is a singer, composer, multi-instrument player, writer and music producer. He has composed more than 500 songs, in several genres such as blues, bossa nova, frevo, maracatur, pop, rock, worldbeat, manguebeat, etc. his first solo record, “o dia em que faremos contato’ is a mixture of northeast Brazilian rhytms, samba and electronica. He owned 5 Latin Grammys.\n\nDiogo Nogueira\n\nSamba is a family tradition in Brazil and many singers and composers come from families with generations of musicians. Diogo Nogueira is one of those. Son of João Nogueira, one of the icons of the Brazilian samba, Diogo continues the family tradition and revitalizes the samba. His “Bossa Negra”, samba from the homonymous album (2014), recorded with the musician Hamilton de Holanda is simply genial.\n\nAline Calixto\n\nA young singer, in her third album now, that explores the ‘samba de raiz’ (rooted sambas). She dialogues two musical traditions, the one from Rio de Janeiro – her origins – with Minas Gerais – where she is based – enriching the expressivity of classical and new sambas with a precious voice. “Flor Morena” is a samba to stay in the history of the genre."
