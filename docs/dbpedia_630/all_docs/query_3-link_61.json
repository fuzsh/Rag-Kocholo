        "text": "February 6 brings two of today’s leading jazz guitarists from Brazil, Romero Lubambo and Chico Pinheiro, who united in September 2021 to record a duo album. Known to Athenaeum audiences from past appearances with Luciana Souza and Trio Da Paz, Lubambo has performed and recorded with many of the outstanding artists of our time, including a range spanning from Dianne Reeves, Michael Brecker, Wynton Marsalis, and Gal Costa to Yo-Yo Ma, Kathleen Battle, and Billie Eilish. Jazziz wrote, “Guitarist Romero Lubambo may be the best practitioner of his craft in the world today... [his] facility, creativity and energy are in a class all their own.” Downbeat commented, “Lubambo is by himself the equivalent of an entire samba band… He tosses melodies, bass lines and rhythms in the air like juggling clubs.” Chico Pinheiro is known to Athenaeum audiences from past appearances with fellow guitarist Anthony Wilson and as the leader of his own quintet with saxophonist Bob Mintzer. Guitar giant Pat Metheny wrote, “There are many incredible guitarists out there. On the top of that list, I'd include Chico Pinheiro.” The Boston Globe called him, “one of the brightest lights on today’s Brazilian jazz scene.”\n\nRomero Lubambo, guitar\n\nChico Pinheiro, guitar\n\nIn 1985, Romero Lubambo came to the United States, and brought with him a new sound in Brazilian jazz guitar. Romero's guitar playing unites the styles and rhythms of his native Brazilian musical heritage with his fluency in the American jazz tradition to form a distinctive new sound.\n\nFrom the cool, sophisticated rhythms of his native Brazil to hard bop, Romero is a guitarist who's comfortable in any musical setting. He is an uncommonly gifted soloist and musical improviser with a steady stream of unpredictably creative musical thoughts and the virtuosity to deliver them.\n\nAfter arriving in New York City, Romero quickly established himself as a \"first call\" session and touring guitarist who was in demand not only for his authentic Brazilian sound, but also for his command with a variety of styles.\n\nLubambo has performed and recorded with many outstanding artists, including Dianne Reeves, Billie Eilish, Angelique Kidjo, Michael Brecker, Yo-Yo Ma, Kathleen Battle, Diana Krall, Herbie Mann, Wynton Marsalis, Gal Costa, Kurt Elling, Kenny Barron, Luciana Souza, Cyro Baptista, Sergio and Odair Assad, Ivan Lins, Grover Washington Jr., Vernon Reid, Flora Purim and Airto, Paquito D'Rivera, Harry Belafonte, Larry Coryell, Gato Barbieri, Leny Andrade, James Carter, Paula Robison, Dave Weckl, Jason Miles, and Cesar Camargo Mariano... among many others.\n\nHe has also established himself as a composer and performer on his own critically acclaimed recording projects as well as on those of Trio Da Paz, a Grammy®-nominated Brazilian jazz trio Lubambo formed with Nilson Matta and Duduka da Fonseca.\n\nLubambo is considered by critics to be \"the best practitioner of his craft in the world today... the guitarist's facility, creativity and energy are in a class all their own\" (Jazziz).\n\nBorn and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, Chico Pinheiro started playing the guitar when he was 6. At 14, he started working as a studio session guitarist and soon began to be called to collaborate with a wide range of artists in his hometown, then in Brazil, then abroad. In 2002 Chico put together a band of his own and started recording as a leader. His first album, 'Meia Noite Meio Dia' (Sony Music/ 2003), was released in 2003 with great reviews at all the most important newspapers and music magazines in Brazil and abroad and was included in the 'Top 10 Brazilian albums of the year' in the major newspapers of Brazil: 'O Estado de São Paulo,' 'A Folha de São Paulo' and 'O Globo.' This well-received debut included special guest vocalists Lenine, Ed Motta, Chico César, and Maria Rita.\n\nHis second release, 'Chico Pinheiro' (Biscoito Fino/ 2005), enjoyed great critical and audience acclaim, once more being included in the 'Top 10 Brazilian albums of the year' by newspapers' O Estado,' 'O Globo' and 'Folha de São Paulo.'\n\nThe third album, NOVA, was released in Dec/ 2007 in collaboration with the American guitarist and composer Anthony Wilson. It was, again, celebrated by critics and the audience.\n\nHis fourth album, There's a Storm Inside (CT Music Japan/ Sunnyside Records, NY, 2010), was released in 35 countries. It included guests such as Dianne Reeves and Bob Mintzer. It was featured on the downbeat, Revista Veja, O Estado de São Paulo, Folha de São Paulo, Jornal O GLOBO, and Revista Rolling Stone among the 'best albums of the year.' This record also won prizes as Best Brazilian Jazz Álbum of the year and Best Latin Jazz Composition of 2010 with 'Mamulengo' in the Latin Jazz Corner Association, USA. Chico also won as Best Latin Jazz Guitarist in the same association.\n\nIn 2012 he released the CD' TRIZ' in partnership with the pianist and composer André Mehmari and singer and composer Sergio Santos.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Downbeat Magazine Annual Critics Poll, Chico has been listed (three times) as \"Rising Star - Guitar.\"\n\nIn 2017 Chico released \"Varanda,\" a unique collaboration project which all major papers and magazines in Brazil and abroad included as 'best of the year' again. His composition \"Varanda\" is performed by Vince Mendoza and the WDR Big Band on the Project \"Focus on Brazil\", along with Milton Nascimento, Edu Lobo, Gilberto Gil, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Villa Lobos.\n\nToday Chico is considered a leading figure in and outside the Brazilian music scene, who has distinguished himself as a guitarist, composer, and arranger. Alongside with his main projects as leader, he also has collaborated with artists such as Placido Domingo, Brad Mehldau, Dave Grusin, Dianne Reeves, Kurt Elling, Danilo Pérez, Nnenna Freelon, Bob Mintzer, Herbie Hancock, Brian Blade (IJD), Ron Carter, Chris Potter, John Patitucci, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, The Israel Chamber Orchestra, The Bob Mintzer Big Band, The Paris Jazz Big Band, The Swiss Jazz Orchestra, The Danish Radio Big Band, The Seasons Guitar Quartet with Anthony Wilson, Julian Lage & Steve Cardenas, Esperanza Spalding, Joyce, Ivan Lins, Rosa Passos, Dori Caymmi, Danilo Caymmi, João Donato, Johnny Alf, Chico César, Ed Motta, César Camargo Mariano, Elza Soares, Luciana Souza, Monarco, Mark Turner, Tom Scott, Joe Lovano, Terri Lyne Carrington, Eddie Gomez, Gary Novak, Lee Ritenour, Abraham Laboriel, Paulinho da Costa, Sammy Figueroa, Cachaíto Lopez (Buena Vista Social Club), Roberto Fonseca, Ari Hoenig, Claudio Roditi, Duduka da Fonseca, Peter Erskine, Giovani Hidalgo, amongst others."
