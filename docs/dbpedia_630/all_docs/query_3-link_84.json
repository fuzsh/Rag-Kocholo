        "text": "In his 2008 book, Outliers, the American intellectual and writer, Malcolm Gladwell, discusses the role of natural ability in achieving world class expertise in a particular skill. In one of the early chapters, he focuses on the work of Stanford professor, Lewis Terman, who sought out child prodigies and followed their subsequent progression into adulthood.\n\nWhat Gladwell finds interesting about these “Termites” – as the studied children were nicknamed – is that, despite having exceptionally high IQs, none fulfilled Terman’s hypothesis that they would grow up to be pre-eminent figures in art, business, science, government or literature.\n\nThe music world is also full of child prodigies, yet few develop into artists of the calibre that would be expected, given the talents displayed at such early ages. They may learn to play complex Mozart pieces with perfect accuracy and exquisite feeling, yet they fail to ape the great composer in his ability to create original work.\n\nThe Exception\n\nStevland Hardaway Morris, better known by his stage name of Stevie Wonder, is one of the few exceptions to this rule. Born six weeks premature, and with retinopathy of prematurity, leading to permanent blindness, Wonder had few of the advantages of life enjoyed by many child prodigies, especially those in the classical oeuvre. Yet it was clear, even at a young age, that he possessed not only a polymath’s command of multiple instruments, but also a creative flair that would see him release original material at the tender age of twelve.\n\nAlthough Stevie is, perhaps best known as a keyboard player, vocalist and songwriter, the harmonica has featured heavily both in his own work and in his contributions to the recordings of other artists.\n\nEarly Success\n\nWonder’s remarkable talent for playing the harp was obvious at an extremely young age. This is evident in rare footage of the Motortown Revue, a series of concerts designed to promote Motown artists in the early 1960s, where a 12 year-old Stevie wows the crowd with a virtuoso performance of ‘Fingertips’ on the bongos and harmonica. Later released as a single, “Fingertips” went on to top the Billboard Pop Singles Chart, giving Wonder his first true hit, and making him the youngest artist to achieve the number one position.\n\nFirst Original Hit\n\nAfter a short period in the wilderness, while his voice underwent the usual changes that adolescence brings, Stevie scored his first self-penned hit with “Uptight (Everything’s Alright)” which displayed a harder, more rock-influenced sound. During this period he was also signed to the Motown songwriting department, which led to him composing songs for himself and labelmates, most notably ‘Tears of a Clown’ which gained Smokey Robinson and the Miracles the coveted number one singles spot.\n\nBack to the Harmonica\n\nTowards the late 1960s the harmonica began to feature heavily again in Wonder’s music: initially in an album of instrumental jazz/soul tracks, entitled ‘Eivets Rednow’, and later with the memorable singles, ‘I Was Made to Love Her’ and ‘For Once in My Life’. It’s a testament to Wonder’s interpretation of the latter that most people assume that he wrote it (in fact it was originally penned by Motown songwriter and producer, Ron Miller, as a much slower piece, intended to be performed in the swing genre).\n\nIn both of these hits, Stevie Wonder displays his trademark harmonica style: virtuosic without being self-indulgent. Compared to the harmonica that featured in other, predominantly folk-based, contemporary chart singles, Wonder’s solos are notable for their complexity, and use of jazz scales, whilst still remaining true to the primary tune of the song itself.\n\nClassic Era\n\nThroughout the 1970s Stevie Wonder matured as an artist, touring with bands such as The Rolling Stones, and developing a sound that was quite distinct from his early Motown work. This period produced his two finest albums: 1973’s ‘Innervisions’ and 1976’s ‘Songs in the Key of Life’, both of which feature heavily in most music magazine’s top albums of all time.\n\nCommercial Success\n\nThe 1980s saw Stevie Wonder build on this critical success with significant commercial achievements, including his first platinum album – ‘Hotter than July’ and the phenomenally popular ‘Happy Birthday’ single, which was part of his ultimately successful campaign to establish Dr Martin Luther King’s birthday as a national holiday in the USA.\n\nOther work included collaborations with Elton John and The Eurythmics, on whose respective singles, ‘I Guess That’s Why They Call it the Blues” and ‘There Must be an Angel’ Wonder played harmonica, with trademark zeal.\n\nLater Years\n\nAlthough the last 25 years has seen a reduction in Wonder’s original musical output, he has continued to contribute to the work of many popular artists, been sampled by others (perhaps most famously, in Coolio’s 1995 hit single ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’, which extensively sampled ‘Pastime Paradise’ from ‘Songs in the Key of Life’), and performed live to huge audiences, at events such as the Winter Olympics and Glastonbury Festival.\n\nStyle and Harmonica Choice\n\nFrom a playing perspective, Stevie overwhelmingly favours the chromatic harmonica. Unlike the more ubiquitous diatonic harmonica, commonly used for folk music and the blues, the chromatic harmonica has a full range of notes, by dint of more holes (up to 16, rather than 10) and a slide, which raises the pitch of each hole by a semitone. The primary downside of the chromatic harp is the additional difficulty in learning to play it. Circular breathing, as commonly practised by classical wind instrument players, is a necessary skill, due to the chromatic harmonica generally requiring a greater amount of air to produce its wider range of notes.\n\nWonder’s use of the chromatic harp is quite distinctive. Harmonica artist, Randy Singer has noted that Stevie manipulates the slide forcibly, whilst using a significant amount of vibrato to achieve a shifting effect. This is mixed with a fluttering effect from his use of the tongue to achieve his trademark sound.\n\nAlthough Stevie now mainly plays a custom made Huang harmonica, many of his recordings feature the Hohner Chromonica Super 64. Players wishing to attempt to replicate his sound will find this a good starting point, as it offers the necessary four octave range at a competitive price point. (As an aside, it’s worth noting that chromatic harmonicas obviate the need to purchase multiple harps, as they can effectively play in any key, making the generally higher initial outlay significantly more bearable).\n\nA slightly cheaper alternative is the Hohner Chromonica 64, which features similar construction but replaces the silver mouthpiece surface of the Super 64 with nickel.\n\nConversely, players who are willing to spend a little more would be advised to look at the Chromonica Super 64X, which upgrades the mouthpiece surface to gold, and produces a louder, richer sound, particularly in the low range, due to its double reed plates.\n\nOf course, while all of these models will give you the potential to play like Stevie, they, unfortunately, won’t instantly imbue you with his talent (more’s the pity!)\n\nIt’s a sad feature of the modern world that a significant event can easily be overshadowed in the popular consciousness if it happens to coincide with a different event that is deemed more newsworthy by the media.\n\nRecent history is littered with examples of this kind of “popularity Top Trumps”, not least of which were Mother Theresa’s death being eclipsed by Princess Diana’s fatal car accident, and Groucho Marx’s passing away being dwarfed by the untimely demise of Elvis Presley.\n\nAnd so, in the week that has given us the death of Chuck Berry, one of the true pioneers of early rock and roll, it is, perhaps, inevitable, that the loss of blues harmonica legend, James Cotton, has been somewhat overlooked.\n\nCotton, who was known for his virtuoso harp work, both as a solo artist and on recordings and performances with a range of blues and rock acts, died of pneumonia on Thursday 16th March 2017 in Austin, Texas, at the age of 81.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn in Tunica, Mississippi, but later moving to West Helena, Arkansas, where he met and was mentored by blues harmonica player and songwriter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Cotton actually began his musical career, albeit the amateur part, as a drummer. It soon became clear, though, that the harmonica was where his talents lay, resulting in him being recruited, in the early 1950s, to Howlin’ Wolf’s band, where he remained for a number of years.\n\nIn 1953, he recorded his first solo record – Straighten Up Baby – for Sun Records, following this with a second single – Cotton Crop Blues.\n\nFrom Blues to Rock\n\nAfter a stint recording and touring with Muddy Waters, Cotton, by then nicknamed “Mr Superharp” in honour of his talent on the harmonica, fronted a number of eponymous bands, including the James Cotton Blues Band. During this time he released a range of live and studio albums, including 100% Cotton, High Energy and Live and On the Move. He combined this work with his own bands with forays into blues rock territory through collaborations with artists such as Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin and Santana, amongst others.\n\nAwards\n\nIn the 1970s he resumed his work with Muddy Waters, which reached its zenith with the Grammy award-winning Hard Again LP, released in 1977. The 1980s brought further Grammy nominations for his Live in Chicago and Take Me Back albums, then in 1996 he received a Grammy in the Best Traditional Blues Album category for his Deep in the Blues LP. His work in the 2000s included Grammy-nominated studio albums, Giant and Cotton Mouth Man.\n\nHe was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2006 and in 2010 was honoured by New York’s Lincoln Center with an all-star concert. The Festival International de Jazz de Montréal paid tribute to Cotton with their 2015 B.B. King Award for his contributions to the blues.\n\nLater Years\n\nCotton continued to tour, even as a senior citizen, and credited this as a means by which he felt younger:\n\n“That’s because I like to see people dance and have a good time,” he told one interviewer. “I like to keep it up, keep it moving. I always liked people like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Santana. I don’t sing much anymore but I don’t let it bother me too much, I just concentrate on blowing harp more.”\n\nPlaying Style\n\nAs a blues harp player, Cotton was renowned for his explosive style, precise choice of notes and tonal variety.\n\nThe New York Daily News described him as, “The greatest blues harmonica player of all time.” NPR Weekend Edition offered a similar tribute: “Conjure up a list of all-time great blues harmonica players, and high up on it you’ll see the name James Cotton.”\n\nPrimarily a diatonic harp player, Cotton tended to use various types of Seydel 1847 harmonicas, including the 1847 Silver, which can be heard on many of his live recordings.\n\nLegacy\n\nCotton’s hard-blowing style has influenced generations of harmonica players, and his work with Muddy Waters was particularly significant in the impact it had on later rock bands, such as the Rolling Stones.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jacklyn Hairston Cotton, two daughters, a son, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nThe Harmonica Company would like to wish all the harmonica lovers out there a Happy New Year! We relaunched the site late 2016 under new ownership and with a much more professional approach.

You can book the course here. We expect to be able to start adding his Sonny Boy’s harmonica range soon too, watch this space.\n\n2017 is the 170th anniversary of Seydel, and with it they have announced the introduction of a special anniversary harmonica called 1847 ONE70, which is a gold plated 1847 Noble with brand new cover plates. We are very proud to be able to say that we will be stocking it, and we will start shipping them out to customers as soon as they arrive in our warehouse.\n\nWhat does 2017 have in store for The Harmonica Company?\n\nIt is our ambition to have a very active 2017, and without giving too much away we are working on expanding our range and announcing some interesting things.

Our accessory range will grow into amps and mics, and we have a large pile of books to start adding to the site in the next month. It is a busy and fun time!\n\nOur initial launch has been wonderful and we couldn’t have done it without our customers support, in such a short period of time since the relaunch we have truly become a global business sending mouth organs to Canada, USA, UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Serbia and Sri Lanka. We are hoping in 2017 we can add many more destinations to the list.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nSo, are you looking to buy your first harmonica? this guide should help you understand the difference between a diatonic, chromatic and tremolo, and help you select your first harmonica (otherwise known as the ‘Mouth Organ’).\n\nThe harmonica is the perfect instrument, it has ease of portability, easy play-ability and extremely affordable in comparison to other musical instruments. Despite there size and price, harmonicas are used in a huge list of different musical genres. The most obvious ones being blues, country, and rock, nevertheless you will hear them played in jazz and classical music too. So what should you select for your first harmonica, well beginners would traditionally start with a 10-hole diatonic harmonica in the Key C, the word “Diatonic” means that the harmonica plays in a standard major (or minor) scale. You can find our range of diatonic in Key C here\n\nDiatonic Harmonicas\n\nThese are the most commonly used harmonicas, and you will find them in blues, folk and often pop music. They are designed to play in a specific key. Nevertheless with different and specific “overblowing” techniques some players have learnt to play them in unofficial keys. It is worth looking for Carlos Del Junco or Howard Levy, they have both created a very good overblowing technique. Known as playing chromatically on a 10-key diatonic harp.\n\nAs already suggested, most music teachers will advise you to get a diatonic (10-key) harmonica in the key C, as your first harmonica.\n\nCheck out our full range of diatonic harmonicas here\n\nChromatic Harmonicas\n\nMost chromatic harmonicas use a button-activated sliding bar to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate. With the right skill and technique, you can play nearly any scale or mode using the chromatic’s “gear shift.”\n\nDue to the larger reeds, it is harder to bend and overblow in comparison to the diatonic. Toots Thielmans and Stevie Wonder were well known to be proficient. Chromatic harmonicas usually come in the key of C or G, however you can learn to play nearly any music that uses the standard 12-tone scale.\n\nCheck out our full range of chromatic harmonicas here\n\nTremolo Harmonicas\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the tremolo-tuned harmonica’s is that it has two reeds per note, with one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. It is this that helps them produce a unique warbling sound. You will find the diatonic version in folk music, however the chromatic counterpart is usually found in Asian rock and pop music.\n\nCheck out our full range of Tremolo Harmonicas here\n\nOur store has huge ranges of different harmonicas, however we also stock amps, mics and books that can help get you started. Do not be daunted by selecting your first harmonica, and if you require lessons, or want to learn how to play, then we have a tutor on hand to teach you via Skype sessions."
