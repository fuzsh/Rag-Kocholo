        "text": "October 5, 2001\n\n8:00 pm\n\nGal Costa with Dori Caymmi & Band\n\nAn Evening of Brazilian Jazz\n\nHerbst Theatre, 401 VanNess Avenue, San Francisco\n\n$30, $40, $50\n\nGroup discounts available at City Box Office only.\n\nTickets:\n\nCity Box Office 415/392-4400\n\nor www.tickets.com\n\nTwo of Brazil’s greatest musicians join their talents to present an evening of Brazilian jazz. Vocalist Gal Costa returns to the Bay Area accompanied by Dori Caymmi & his 5-piece band. Dori’s latest cd Influencias, features Gal. Join us for a wonderful evening of Brazilian favorites and original compositions; bossa nova MPB classics, and jazz.\n\nGal Costa is one of the greatest vocal representatives of Brazilian music for the last thirty years. Born in Salvador, Bahia, Gal made her debut in Sao Paulo in 1965, went on to become the luminous and voluptuous interpreter of the 1970’s, then began touring internationally in the 1980’s. Gal is now considered the first lady of Brazilian music, her striking voice having interpreted the musical creations of almost every Brazilian (as well as many American) composers.\n\nGal was part of the controversial musical movement “Tropicalia”, along with singers/composers Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil in the late 1960’s. Later when Gil and Caetano were exiled in London during the Brazilian military dictatorship of 1970’s, Gal kept the movement alive by continuing to sing their songs at politically radical concerts.\n\nGal has continued to generate delightful surprises throughout her career, while confounding critics and public alike with her mix of rock with baiao, Bahian folklore with pop, samba with blues. The demanding Joao Gilberto considers her to be one of the three best singers of the world; the other two being Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. She performed lovely interpretations of Cole Porter tunes on her CD Plural, and two years ago recorded a double CD in tribute to Tom Jobim, who considered Gal to be the best interpreter of his music.\n\nDori Caymmi grew up surrounded by music. His father Dorival Caymmi, is one of the foremost composers of Brazil. Along with sister Nana Caymmi and brother Danilo, they comprise one of the most musially talented families of Brazil. Dori began his musical path at age 8 on piano, quickly graduating to guitar by the time he was 15. By age 21, he was composing soundtracks for television, and began producing and arranging for other artists, including Gal Costa, Tom Jobim, Milton Nascimento, Sergio Mendes and English pop star Paul Young. He toured internationally with Paul Winter in 1965, and arranged Sarah Vaughan’s album Brazilian Romance in 1987.\n\nGenerally considered a jazz artist, and currently living in the United States, Dori has nonetheless never betrayed his homeland as he continues to compose melodies rooted in Brazilian themes. Dori’s music is an international language. The combination of Dori’s graceful guitar playing and rich voice create lush musical illustrations, which reflect the various influences of Brazilian culture including African rhythms, Portuguese melodies and Brazilian folklore. Thus the name of his latest CD, Influencias , an homage to all the “influences” which have helped to form his unique musical personality."
