        "text": "Teixeirinha, given name Vitor Mateus Teixeira, was a Brazilian musician. Teixeirinha is the diminutive form of the common Brazilian surname of Teixeira. Teixeirinha was born in Rolante, Rio Grande do Sul, on March 3, 1927. Teixeirinha's father, Saturnino Teixeira, died when young Vitor was 6 years old. He had a brother and two sisters. His mother, Ledurina Mateus Teixeira died when Teixeirinha was just 9 years old. Afterwards, he lived with relatives and did many small jobs to support himself, like working on farms, delivering newspapers, etc. At eighteen years of age, he enlisted into the army, but never served. During this time, he worked for the DAER for six years. He left to try a singing career on the radio. Teixeirinha met his wife Zoraida Lima Teixeira in the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, as he traveled through various cities singing on local radio stations trying to start his artistic career. They married in 1957 and moved to Soledade. They then moved to the city of Passo Fundo where Teixeirinha sang on the Municipal Radio of Passo Fundo. Teixeirinha received his first invitation to record in 1959.\n\nCaetano Emanuel Viana Telles Veloso (Portuguese pronunciation: [kaeˈtɐ̃nu emanuˈɛw viˈɐ̃nɐ ˈtɛlis veˈlozu]; born August 7, 1942) is a Brazilian composer, singer, guitarist, writer, and political activist. Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement Tropicalismo, which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the Brazilian military dictatorship. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards. On November 14, 2012, Veloso was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of José Telles Velloso (Seu Zeca), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (Dona Canô), a housewife. He was born in the city of Santo Amaro da Purificação, in Bahia, a state in the eastern area of Brazil, but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the founders of Tropicalismo with a group of several other musicians and artists—including his sister Maria Bethânia—in the same period. However the Brazilian government at the time viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician Gilberto Gil, in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing. He later became popular outside Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nFrancisco \"Chico\" Buarque de Hollanda, popularly known simply as Chico Buarque (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈʃiku buˈaʁki]; born June 19, 1944) is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, guitarist, composer, playwright, writer and poet. He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic and cultural commentary on Brazil. The firstborn son of Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Rome. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and João Gilberto. He performed as a singer and guitarist the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several Tropicalist and MPB musicians, was threatened by the Brazilian military government and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nAntônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim, often hailed as one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, was a pivotal figure in the development and global popularization of bossa nova music. Born on January 25, 1927, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this iconic musician exhibited an early attraction towards music, particularly that which encapsulated the spirit of his Brazilian heritage. He studied music theory, harmony, and composition in his youth, laying the foundation for his phenomenal career. Jobim's professional journey began in the late 1950s when he teamed up with poet Vinicius de Moraes to write a play. This collaboration became a cornerstone for Jobim's career, leading to the creation of songs like \"Se Todos Fossem Iguais a Você\" and \"A Felicidade\", both of which later became classic pieces of the bossa nova canon. However, it was the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", co-written with de Moraes and Norman Gimbel, that catapulted Jobim to international fame. This Grammy-winning song went on to become one of the most recorded songs in history, firmly establishing Jobim's position among the greats of world music. Over his career, Jobim composed more than 400 songs, many of which have been covered by prominent musicians worldwide. His compositions seamlessly blended elements of jazz with traditional Brazilian rhythms, producing a unique sound that left an indelible mark on the music industry. Jobim passed away in 1994, but his legacy continues to live on. His contributions to bossa nova and world music have been celebrated posthumously with numerous honors, including induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Latin Grammy Trustees Award."
