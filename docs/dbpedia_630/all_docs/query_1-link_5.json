        "text": "The history of the Brazilian song is closely linked with the guitar. If other melodic-harmonic instruments – such as the piano, accordion or cavaquinho (small guitar) – appear as tools of established musical elaboration in certain music strands, the guitar stands out as the main instrument used in the manipulation of music elements by those who make songs in Brazil.\n\nThus, the format voice and guitar appears as a determinant parameter for the music that shows vocation to receive a song treatment, even if it is composed with the active participation of an instrument rather than the guitar.\n\nThat parameter establishes itself through the vast production along several generations of singers—guitar-players who have gradually founded the basis for the typical musical handling of the Brazilian song.\n\nJOÃO BOSCO\n\n00:00 voice and guitar equilibrium: Caymmi and João Gilberto\n\nA person who has changed my life was Dorival Caymmi. […]\n\nHe had his steel guitar\n\nand sang powerfully with that voice of his.\n\nGuitar and voice with very similar emissions, both very strong.\n\nUnlike João Gilberto\n\nwho produces a silken voice and a very soft guitar too.\n\nBoth have a tremendous talent to place voice and guitar at the same sonorous level.\n\n00:48 Caymmi: guitar integrated with the composition\n\nAt the same time as the voice inspires the guitar,\n\nthe instrument calls for the voice.\n\nIn the end both merge\n\nbecoming inseparable parts in the composition. [i]\n\n02:10 inseparable parts in the composition\n\n03:06 a very characteristic guitar sound of that author and that voice\n\nSARAIVA\n\nActually Caymmi’s voice and guitar\n\nin spite of being classic\n\nhas musical stimuli that ar still not deciphered\n\nJOÃO BOSCO\n\nAnd perhaps it might be for us not to decipher\n\nonce it presents a mysterious relation between voice and instrument;\n\nrather, it may be a signal for us to know that is in fact\n\nthe very guitar of that voice and that author.\n\nthey are indivisible\n\ninseparable\n\nand both need one another\n\nto work out.\n\nGuinga highlights other artists, from the subsequent generation of Dorival Caymmi, who specially contributed to the multiplication of expressions and styles in the elaboration of a “guitar that meshes with the song”.\n\nGUINGA\n\n00:00 very personal solutions\n\nMilton Nascimento, Chico Buarque, Gilberto Gil, Dori Caymmi.\n\nThey are as important to the guitar as João Gilberto,\n\nbecause they also present very personal solutions.\n\n00:33 Dori\n\nWhen Dori does this:\n\n[Guinga plays and vocalizes Estrela da tarde (Afternoon star) (Dori Caymmi / Paulo César Pinheiro)]\n\nThat is a masterpiece, buddy!\n\nIt has such importance to guitar literature – the same as any of those wonderful pieces.\n\nThe terms “piece”, “guitar literature” and “masterpiece” refer us straight back to the universe of the erudite guitar [i], and somehow claim hybrid legitimacy between the oral and written traditions for the refined goldsmithing done by the composer—guitar-player who composes songs in Brazil.\n\nGUINGA\n\n02:44 a guitar that meshes the song\n\nThose guys taught me more in terms of guitar than the guitar-players themselves.\n\nSARAIVA\n\nDo you mean the accompaniment guitar?\n\nGUINGA\n\nFor me this is not accompaniment guitar.\n\nIt is a guitar that has independent life.\n\nIf you accompany this song in another way\n\nyou won’t get the same exuberance.\n\nThe buddy created a song\n\nand created a guitar that meshes the song\n\nThus, Guinga’s view dialogues with that of João Bosco when he points out that the guitar and voice “mesh becoming inseparable parts of the composition”. In both cases the adhesion between the song and the accompaniment conceived in authorial form leads us to the impression of specific musical gestures that reveal the creation concept of each composer. [i]\n\nLINK with the same idea presented in – 3 – Song: the instrument’s degrees of action in the creative process – in the second category of the schematization. LINK with the idea “I feel it as a song, inside this simple aesthetics, which may be translated with a voice and a guitar without losing its beauty and integrity” presented in – 3.6 – The composer, the songwriter and the grays in between.\n\nUniverse with which Guinga came into contact, albeit not in depth, as a student of the\n\nteacher and concertist Jodacil Damasceno.\n\nLINK with the concept “musical gesture” presented in the introduction of the academic dissertation, whose link for PDF may be found in the second note included in the Introdução."
