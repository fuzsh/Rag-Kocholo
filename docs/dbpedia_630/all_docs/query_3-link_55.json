        "text": "From their roots in the vibrant heart of the San Francisco Bay Area the T Sisters have shared a lifelong musical voyage. Raised in a family that breathed music, these talented sisters have harmonized together since childhood. In an environment where melodies and lyrics were woven into the fabric of daily life, they honed their skills and developed a unique bond that transcends sisterhood. With their mesmerizing vocal harmonies as the centerpiece, the T Sisters create a distinctive and soulful sound. The sisters underpin their seamless vocal blend with Erika's guitar, Rachel's bass, and Chloe's drums, crafting a sound that is rich in heartfelt expression and undeniably effective.\n\nTheir dynamic live performances have led them to share the stage with esteemed acts such as the Wood Brothers, the Indigo Girls, The Brothers Comatose, and Amos Lee. Throughout their career, the T Sisters have released three full-length albums and various EPs, including 2021’s full-length release \"Big Girl Pants.\" This album showcases their growth and maturity as musicians, presenting a rich tapestry of contemporary folk songs that explore love, life, and the trials and triumphs of womanhood, all penned by the sisters themselves. Most recently, the sisters have begun to release singles from their upcoming release “Sheroes,” a short collection of covers of some of their favorite songs written or performed by female artists. This EP will pay homage to the legendary female performers who have left an indelible mark on the music industry. With their exquisite harmonies, deep-rooted authenticity, and a genuine passion for crafting meaningful music, the T Sisters continue to captivate hearts and souls with every note they sing. Their journey is a compelling story of sisterhood, music, and the beautiful tapestry of life in the San Francisco Bay Area, inviting audiences to join them on a heartfelt yet sassy musical adventure.\n\nThe trio combines their original compositions, sparkling improvisations, and infectious energy for a night of fun. Of the band, reviewers have said: “An electrifying, push-the-limits performance style… A tight and enormously talented trio.” (Jazz Times Magazine), “Charged Particles is definitely dazzling.” (Jazz and Blues Report), “Fresh, energized jazz that showcases the trio’s individual technical mastery as well as a cooperative, refined approach to the art form.” (Jazz News Magazine), and “Tight interplay was the watchword as the threesome took difficult fusion themes and applied its own twists with spark and personal flair.” (Los Angeles Times). Downbeat Magazine called the band “something special” and “inventive, invigorating, mesmerizing, beautiful, virtuosic, and lyrical.” LA Jazz Scene said that “all three rhythm section members bring excitement and creativity to the bandstand.”\n\nThe band recently sold out Ronnie Scott’s (in London) and Birdland (in New York City) with tenor saxophonist Tod Dickow and world class trumpeter, Randy Brecker, playing new arrangements of compositions by the late great jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker on the CD, “Live at the Baked Potato!” (Summit Records).\n\nThe CD was named among the best 2021 jazz releases in JazzTimes Magazine, Jazzwise Magazine, the San Jose Mercury News, the Jazz Journalists Association, the 16th Annual Jazz Critics Poll, Glide Magazine, Nippertown Magazine, and more publications. Randy Brecker said the recording is “smoking and intense from beginning to end”. Bill Milkowski, author of Michael Brecker’s biography, said the record is “staggering in its authenticity.” Downbeat Magazine said that the record features “exciting, satisfying stuff”.\n\nIn a concert review, Downbeat Magazine called the quartet “something special” and “inventive, invigorating, mesmerizing, beautiful, virtuosic, and lyrical.” Nippertown Magazine said the quartet’s performance at the Albany Riverfront Jazz Festival in New York was “often thrilling” and “the peak set of the day”. The Oxford Times said their performance at the Spin Jazz Club (in the U.K.) was “brilliant”.\n\nAt this performance, the quartet will play a mixture of their original funky Latin jazz and some of Brecker’s compositions. This will be an evening of drama, emotions, surprise, and virtuosity.\n\nComposer and arranger Jaron Lanier has performed with artists as diverse as Les Claypool, John Zorn, Laurie Anderson, Yoko Ono, Philip Glass, Ornette Coleman, George Clinton, Vernon Reid, Terry Riley, Duncan Sheik, Pauline Oliveros, and Stanley Jordan.

Jaron is also a prolific published writer and regular contributor to the New Yorker Magazine, where he writes about music and technology.\n\nWith the release of his first recording in 2003 entitled Changing Places, Norwegian pianist Tord Gustavsen came forth with a new sound by applying elements of American jazz to the church, classical, and folk music of his youth. The result was an immediately identifiable, Norwegian kind of jazz, a descendant of the original fresh with new sources of inspiration that has won the hearts of music lovers worldwide and established Gustavsen as one of Scandinavia’s leading jazz artists. The trio will preview selections from the upcoming release of Gustavsen’s tenth album for ECM Records.\n\nA pianist of poetic cast, an exceptionally lucid player with a sure sense of melodic structure and an often-astonishing lyrical imagination. - JazzTimes\n\nWith 1.7 listeners on Spotify across 182 countries is a testament to how his music speaks to a worldwide audience. Cool and mysterious, pristine and intensely emotional, the music of Norwegian pianist Tord Gustavsen has earned a vast following while making few populist concessions. Easily the most acclaimed composer and pianist on the Norwegian jazz scene, he’s released a series of critically hailed albums that have climbed high on the Norwegian pop charts, starting with his 2003’s ECM debut Changing Places.\n\n“Audiences can expect a band that is always developing and negotiating this paradox between melodic, lyrical, almost pop music type jazz and the freedom of the moment, and an emphasis on textures and soundscapes in a way. So we are almost like a pop band in cherishing the melodies and feeling that if you are to play melody, it has to sound like it is the most important thing in the world here and now. And we will always come up with new songs and new structures every night. So in that way we are almost like a free jazz band. And this paradox is a beautiful one.”\n\n—\"Tord Gustavsen published on Facebook.\"\n\nHis music is the offspring of American jazz and European culture. From the American masters headopted instrumentation, the concept of playing songs and improvising on them, and the sensitive interaction between improvisers. He applied these ideas and his instinct as a composer to the church hymns of his youth, the classical music he studied, and the Scandinavian folk music of his homeland. The result was a unique, immediately identifiable Norwegian jazz sound, a descendant of the original fresh with new sources of inspiration that has won the hearts of music lovers worldwide and established Gustavsen as one of Scandinavia’s leading jazz artist.\n\nJahari has performed in venues such as Radio City Music Hall in NYC, The Met Philadelphia, Byline Bank Aragon in Chicago, Carnegie Hall in NY, San Francisco Jazz Center, and MANY others.

With equal parts innovative jazz virtuosity and heart-centered vocals, trailblazer Von Roderick mines the essence of classic jazz, rock, and electronica on CELESTIAL HEART and hits his mark.\n\nFeaturing legendary drummer Jim Keltner (John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Steely Dan), adventurous studio ace Mike Valerio and orchestration wizard Gil Goldstein (Wayne Shorter, Pat Metheny), CELESTIAL HEART leads with Von Roderick’s out-of-this-world treatment of Fly Me To The Moon, perhaps even more true to the original song lyrics — a version you didn’t realize you needed until you hear it for the first time.\n\nUtilizing his now signature multiphonics, loops, and spoken word, CELESTIAL HEART cements Von Roderick’s place within the pantheon of the real-deal singing trumpeter.

Jahari gives us chameleonic grooves anchored by impeccable arpeggios that rise and fall against dense, driving rhythms. He effortlessly balances whimsical notions and melancholic chords with fiery percussive statements that capture the complex and sweet moments of life.” - Karas Lamb - Revive Music\n\nJahari will be joined by Miguel Russell, a 21-year-old drummer/producer from South Florida. Originally born in the Bronx NYC, he started playing drums when he was 2 years old when his father taught him how to play. At age 4 he was enrolled in the Harlem School of the Arts, studying under mentor and master drummer, Baba Donald Eaton. At age 5, his professional career began. Eventually, he moved to South Florida at age 6 and continued his professional career. He would go on to play with legends such as Wynton Marsalis, Nestor Torres, Paquito D' Rivera, Pedro Martinez, Candido Camero, Stefon Harris, Stacey Dillard, Dayna Stephens, and more.\n\nThe album was released in May 2018 with an official presentation at the legendary Blue Note in NY, Symphony Space on Broadway, and collaboration at the Lehman Performing Arts Center, alongside flamenco singer Diego el Cigala, before a fantastic audience of flamenco and jazz lovers.\n\nThese performances are a mere handful among hundreds in a career that began in Conde’s childhood in Valencia, Spain. A recognized prodigy, Conde demonstrated perfect pitch at the age of four. His parents gave him his first keyboard, and encouraged him as he began taking formal piano instruction. Conde practiced everything he heard from his father, Alejandro Conde, an acclaimed singer with more than 20 albums to his name, and one of the foremost performers of Copla, the flamenco-infused song book of popular works. Conde earned his first bachelor’s degree in Classical from the Jose Iturbi Conservatory of Music in 2001. From there, he went on to study at L’aula de Musica de Barcelona and earned a Diploma of Excellence in 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Conde was offered scholarships to pursue a second bachelor’s degree from Berklee College of Music. During his tenure at Berklee, his playing matured in his melding of musicality and increasing technical proficiency. He began playing professionally alongside jazz musicians and studied with trumpeter Mike Mossman, alto saxophonist Antonio Hart and pianist Jeb Patton.\n\nIn 2009, Conde met producer Fernando Brunet, with whom he released Jazz and Claps, an album featuring Alex original compositions. The album was released with Contraseña Records and opened the path of jazz and flamenco and stamped the music of Alex Conde as a center and as a mature composer and arranger for small ensemble.\n\nIn 2013, Conde self-produced and released his second album, Barrio del Carmen, a collection of music composed and arranged for the flamenco companies for which he has composed music over the years. The album features flamenco stars including gypsy singer Kina Mendez, nephew of the great Paquera de Jerez, and guitarist Jose Luis Rodriguez, long-time musical director for Cristina Hoyos. The album became a classic on TV programs such as Television Castilla la Mancha, presented by Rocío Sañudo, and in flamenco dance classes, where it is prized for its musicality and structure.\n\nIn 2015, Conde recorded an Iberian-inflected tribute to Thelonious Monk, Descarga for Monk (ZOHO), accompanied by seven-time Grammy-nominated percussionist John Santos and bassist Jeff Chambers, earning international recognition.\n\nToday, Conde has become one of his generation’s pivotal figures in flamenco piano. With a fluid technique, an innovative tonal palette, and an extensive repertoire, he plays with the passion of a young artist and the command of a seasoned veteran and remains in constant demand as both a studio artist and a performer.\n\nSELECTED PRAISES\n\n‘‘... Origins is a tremendous calling card for Alex Conde as composer and pianist. But it’s also a demonstration of the adaptability of Latin jazz, as the genre readily accepts Conde’s flamenco influences. Easily recommended to Latin jazz fans, with the additional spice of a fresh Spanish flavor.”\n\nMARK SULLIVAN, ALLABOUTJAZZ\n\n“... When Alex Conde turns up the power at any given time, he’s like an orchestra all by himself. All of this firepower together with Marcus Gilmore, Conrad Herwig, Dayna Stephens and Luques Curtis makes Origins a very special experience. Mr. Conde is a pianist whose music is sustained by the fecundity of his Spanish roots. Through it all, of course, Mr. Conde is absolutely thrilling.”\n\n— RAUL DA GAMA, LATIN JAZZ NETWORK\n\n“... Gifted Spanish pianist Alex Conde, has his way with the high priest of bop in an adventurous all-Monk program.’’\n\n— JAZZ CRITIC BILL MILKOWSKI\n\n‘‘... [Alex’s] Thelonious Monk is rock solid. Its rhapsodic elegance is informed by all of the mystery and majesty of Monkish-ness. The elemental irreverence of Monk-music has been mastered by the young Spaniard. He worships at the altar of originality, as Thelonious Monk did, pouring his twisting duende into molten chords. His phrases make for lines that erupt with volcanic brilliance and a viscosity that is unlike anything that has been sung of Thelonious Monk in a very long time.”\n\n— RAUL DA GAMA, LATIN JAZZ NETWORK\n\n“... I have the honor of being part of this wonderful project. If you know Alex, you know what I’m talkin’ about. If not, you need to check him out. He’s a virtuoso pianist from Spain, and has prepared some extremely hip arrangements of classic and off-the-beaten-path Monk compositions — just when you thought you’ve heard Monk every way possible. The intimate setting and the sparkling musicianship of my colleagues is a ripe combination.”\n\n— SEVEN-TIME GRAMMY-NOMINATED ARTIST JOHN SANTOS\n\nA professional musician since the age of twelve, Mark is a visionary artist with a background in nonlinear mathematics, sacred systems, and cosmology. As a classically trained bassist and sitar player, he gained extensive experience in orchestral and world music ensembles, jazz combos, and solo sitar performance. While studying North Indian classical music with the legendary sitar and surbahar master Ustad Imrat Khan (younger brother of Ustad Vilayat Khan), Mark began delving deeper into the universal fundamentals of music and its underlying frequency structures. This in turn led him to his quest to develop an instrument that could reproduce his findings. This work culminated in 1999 with Mark being awarded a US patent for his groundbreaking new instrument: Bazantar – a six-string acoustic bass fitted with an additional twenty-nine sympathetic strings and four drone strings. The result is a remarkable instrument that weaves a mesmerizing soundscape of resonance, and evokes all the power of Western classical music with the depth and nuance of Eastern traditions. Read about this incredible invention on https://bazantar.com/about/\n\nFormed in 2017 in response to a need to perform some wonderful yet under-appreciated works by the German-Dutch composer Julius Röntgen, pianist Mark Anderson has set out to perform all 5 Röntgen piano trios over the course of two years, one of which will be performed in the intimate setting of a William Turnbull house on the Inverness Ridge.\n\nThe Röntgen Trio is comprised of Mark Anderson, piano, Antoine van Dongen, violin, and Eric Gaenslen, cello.

Antoine studied primarily with Sandor Vegh at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. Born in Leipzig, Julius Röntgen (1855-1932) wrote over 600 works and was a celebrated musician throughout northern Europe. He lived most of his life in Holland and became known as the “Dutch Brahms”. His post-romantic style is steeped in German musical tradition and is sure to delight new audiences.\n\nJahari Stampley is a Chicago-born pianist who began playing the piano at the age of 14, already winning various competitions including \"Best High School Jazz Soloist Award\" and the National Young Arts Competition.
