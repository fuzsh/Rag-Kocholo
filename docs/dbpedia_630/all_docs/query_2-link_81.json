        "meta_description": "Joyce & Dori Caymmi are two of Brazilian music’s living national treasures. In a less Anglo/US-centric world, they’d be more widely recognized as two of this planet’s living musical treasures. She’s a Carioca - in other words, Joyce is from Rio. Although Dori was also born there, his primary connection is to Bahia (his father Dorival Caymmi was one of the greats of Brazilian music, considered ‘the ultimate Baiano’). Both are superb singers (Antonio Carlos Jobim regarded Joyce as ‘one of the greatest singers of all time’), acoustic guitarists & composers, playful & subtle. Dori is also a noted arranger. The longtime friends make beautiful music together on Rio Bahia. Key colleagues include Joyce’s drummer/spouse Tutty Moreno & their US friend, pianist Kenny Werner. The menu is a tasty mix of new originals & fresh versions of Brazilian classics.",
