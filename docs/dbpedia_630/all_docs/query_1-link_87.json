        "text": "IR: The NEW ARRIVAL album was the first recording of my Quartet. It was recorded in the garage of Marcel, my drummer, and in my favourite way: with no overdubs and with everybody in the same room. Since it was our first recording, I wanted to present the band playing with different concepts. So I composed songs in different styles—although the overall concept is still jazz.\n\nI think I composed at that time songs based on groove, rather than on melodic or harmonic structures. In Europe most jazz musicians compose and play music with a strong melodic concept, rather than groove. The thing I really like about American jazz is that it somehow always has a strong rhythmical aspect, even when the music is melodically or harmonically complex. By the time I recorded this album I was listening to Conrad Herwig and Michael Brecker; so I guess this influenced my style in that period.\n\nAcross the Pond\n\nAG: You’re only the second Dutch student to receive a Master of Music degree from an American school. Do you feel the American and European approaches to jazz education are now more similar, or are there significant differences even today?\n\nIR: Actually, I didn’t study in the States, although I visited America a couple of times to play and teach there. I got a Masters degree in Holland, after I graduated Cum Laude. I then received the degree from an American committee one year after my Dutch graduation.\n\nFor over fourteen years I’ve been teaching at Rotterdam Conservatory: jazz trombone, arranging, coaching bands, and leading the big band. As a matter of fact, several times I attended the International Association for Jazz Education conference. And a few American trombone players had been clinicians in Rotterdam, such as Conrad Herwig, Michael Davis, Bill Reichenbach, and Steve Turre. So I had experienced a bit of the American approach to teaching.\n\nWhat I saw was that everybody was talking about the same principles of trombone playing: air and sound. Sure, everybody has their own way of looking at it; but in general the basic approach is the same. The clinicians from the States used more jazz-related scale-exercises, sometimes more what we call “licks.” And, for instance, Steve Turre showed us how to play in different styles: from New Orleans to hard bop and Latin jazz. In Europe the jazz trombone teachers have their roots still a bit in classical music; so their approach of exercises are related to the classical technique books. But in the end, there is no big difference between the American and European approach today.\n\nI’ve played with various trombonists from the States, such as Ed Neumeister, Bill Reichenbach, and David Taylor; and according to my experience there is no difference in the level of playing across countries, either.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nAG: Who were your primary influences in your youth on your trombone-playing, jazz and otherwise?\n\nIR: Before I started studying the trombone I heard an old record of my parents: 21 TROMBONES, featuring Urbie Green. The sound of this big ensemble was overwhelming, in combination with Urbie’s beautiful tone. So from the moment I took up the instrument, I had this warm, rich sound in my head. I still don’t sound like Urbie, but it’s good to have this blueprint in the back of your head.\n\nAnd as a coincidence my parents had a recording with Jimmy Cleveland on it. I think this guy is underestimated. His solos are so full of energy: smart, controlled, pure jazz. You can hear the past, the roots of rhythm. Later on I was blown away by Frank Rosolino and Conrad Herwig.\n\nI guess the combination of those four trombonists somehow formed my idea of how the instrument could sound in jazz. As for classical players, I always loved the sound of Michel Becquet: this light, French style suits the jazz player very well.\n\nEnsemble Writing\n\nAG: Your 2007 CD, UNTAMED WORLD, captures your writing for jazz trombone ensembles, a wonderful idiom that more trombonists should explore and enjoy. And I see that Warwick Music publishes those charts. I’m sure it was a joy writing for and performing with your friends for the recording, but did you find any particular challenges or delights associated with composing for a jazz trombone ensemble?\n\nIR: Writing for larger trombone ensemble is maybe the easiest of my composing and arranging assignments because I know the instrument and its limitations so well. And trombones sound great together, unlike most other wind instruments. I already mentioned this fantastic group of twenty-one trombones with Urbie Green. As far as I know they made two records; and the sound of that group varies from a warm, symphonic sound to groovy, bright sounds with a bite.\n\nFor my CD UNTAMED WORLD I somehow tried to avoid writing music for only trombone fans. So the tutti parts are as important as the various improvisations, including piano and guitar solos. In fact, this CD is a recording of my quartet plus seven trombones. The only big challenge is maybe to cope with the limitations of the trombone: it’s mainly a slower instrument than the saxophone; and it doesn’t have an exciting high register, like trumpet or alto saxophone.\n\nComposing for classical trombone ensemble, though, is more challenging in my perspective. I wrote a few pieces for The New Trombone Collective and for similar groups in Germany, but the absence of a rhythm section is a big struggle for me. And in general the classical musicians are not used to improvising. So you have to compose every single note from the beginning until the very end. Still, I like writing for trombones the most.\n\nText & Context\n\nAG: Your 2008 CD, THE SHAKESPEARE ALBUM, features vocalist Fay Claassen performing with you and your quartet in a live performance of your settings of Shakespeare sonnets—and two Oscar Wilde poems. To my ear, it’s a very striking sound at the opening of the set, when the listener first hears the very bluesy shaping of Sonnet 32. It immediately lets me know that I’m in for a fresh experience blending older text with modern musical flavors. What inspired you to do this project?\n\nIR: I always wanted to put nice poems to music. In many jazz songs the lyrics are sweet, light; and I was looking for strong text with important meaning. I was inspired by poems of Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, Oscar Wilde, Baudelaire, a French poet, and more. But in the end it turned out to be that the sonnets by Shakespeare were so full of power, interesting rhyme, beautiful language; and somehow it was easy to put it to music.\n\nMy mother was English teacher all her life, and she always encouraged me to do “something” with the text of Shakespeare. I knew Fay; and I hoped she would dare to perform those old, almost sacred, lyrics. It had to be a jazzy approach of the poems, with enough space to improvise: that was clear from the start.\n\nAG: Did you stick with your initial concept for each of the texts you chose, or did you revamp some wholly along the way?\n\nIR: Every sonnet has the same rhythm and number of sentences; so the difficulty was to write eight unique songs. Therefore I focused on the meaning of several sonnets and repeated the text over and over again until I found a specific way to put the sonnet to music. Some sonnets are dark, bitter, or romantic. I tried to capture that mood and find a melody line that matched with the meaning of the specific poem.\n\nAG: This seems to be your first major project linking text and music. Did you find particular ease or challenges in the coupling?\n\nIR: In fact it was easy to do it because I love the poems that much—and because I knew Fay and my group pretty well. I had a very strong idea about how I would perform the sonnets in the first place. My quartet usually plays festivals; we spread a lot of energy; we share the same humor and taste (both musical and gastronomic). In other words, we have a lot of fun on stage. Performing the sonnets shouldn’t change that energy. So the music is still happening: nice grooves, nice solos, and enough room for the vocalist to produce all those “Thou arts” and “Thou didst forsake mes.”\n\nAG: How important has your writing been to your playing—and vice-versa?\n\nIR: Writing music is something else than improvising on stage. I really like the combination of the two. When writing music you can take your time producing lines, think about the effect of your choice of notes, decide where to go and what to do. Improvising is right there, on the spot, creating new music. Sure, improvisations are most of the time based on harmonies that you already know, but it’s another way of creating music. It’s Zen, here and now, playing together, creating music with the help of other musicians, or with the acoustics of a certain hall.\n\nThe fact that I am used to writing music helps me a lot in those situations on stage. It’s easier now for me to make decisions to benefit the group sound and the whole composition, rather than focusing too much on an individual solo: to prevent being carried away by the moment, instead of paying attention to the whole composition.\n\nAG: I see that you’ve kept a core of rhythm-section musicians that you enjoy working with. Have you found it challenging to keep a band together in today’s world and economy?\n\nIR: I have to say that the effects of the economic crisis have influenced the cultural situation in The Netherlands. It’s harder to keep bands playing than it used to be. But at the same time, people need music and fun in times of misfortune; so I think there will be work for us, anyhow. To make a living as a performing artist is maybe a bigger challenge nowadays. Luckily I am playing in over ten bands, subbing in the Metropole Orchestra, and writing music. And the good thing about my own quartet is that I can call them as soon as I have a concert to do, and we can perform the music of any project without rehearsing. We have had enough experience as group by now that we can survive the hard times without losing contact. It’s like family: we always stick together somehow.\n\nMutes & Rigs\n\nAG: When you perform in general, mutes seem to be an important part of your voice. That’s not as true for all players. Is there anything you can share about the choices you make?\n\nIR: The choice for mutes is made by the fact that I actually want to imitate guitar players. And working with vocalists implies that I have to change or sometimes soften my tone. I often use this Humes and Berg Mic-a-Mute. It’s a cup mute with felt inside. It gives a warm but smaller sound. A funny one is the Mel-O-Wah (Ray Robinson). It’s like you play through an old radio. I also play the old plunger.\n\nI love to play funk and jazz-rock-related music with my group. And somehow in my view the natural sound of the trombone is too much related to the jazz music of the fifties. So I sometimes need to change that straight-ahead sound. Besides mutes I’m using now the original Jimi Hendrix Cry Baby, a nice Wah-Wah pedal. I combine that with my Line6 MM4 Modeler, with various phasers and choruses, and with a thing called Whammy: the effect is amazing. The trombone really sounds like a guitar, with all the bends and glissandi. At least I like it!\n\nAG: What equipment are you playing on these days?\n\nIR: I play Kühnl & Hoyer trombones exclusively: model Bart van Lier 480/88. I’ve played this instrument for the last sixteen years, and I really love the clear sound and the clean flexibilities. The instrument fits in all kinds of styles, including classical music. It’s a small-bore instrument; but it has a rich and full sound, with lots of overtones. It sounds mature, but at the same time it’s easy to play.\n\nI don’t change mouthpieces often. Some players can switch easily from one mouthpiece to another. I find it hard to do that. So I stick with a Vincent Bach 7C mouthpiece, sometimes the Kühnl & Hoyer/Bart van Lier mouthpiece. Other mouthpieces with similar rim and cup didn’t appeal to me.\n\nThe Scene and The Future\n\nAG: We’re an international association and journal, and our non-European members could benefit from your assessment of the jazz scene beyond North America. Would you like to share with us the names of some jazz musicians—trombone and otherwise—that we should be checking out? Perhaps some that are well established and some that are perhaps newer to the scene or up-and-coming?\n\nIR: One of our leading trombone players is Bart van Lier. No further introduction is needed. I owe him very much. He inspired me to play the trombone, helped in any way he could. We formed a band together and teach together at the same conservatory. He is a great friend and a true artist.\n\nAnother fine trombone player is my former student, Louk Boudesteijn. Check him out on YouTube: he is a nice soloist.\n\nTrumpet player Rik Mol is maybe the most impressive young talent that is playing at this moment. We play together in Nueva Manteca, a famous Latin-jazz group. He is working on an impressive career right now in The Netherlands and Germany.\n\nTrumpet players Martijn de Laat and Wim Both; saxophone players Tom Beek, Tineke Postma, and Joris Roelofs; guitar players Jesse van Ruller and Martijn van Iterson; and pianist Rob van Bavel are incredible musicians. They will determine the future of jazz in Europe for the coming years.\n\nAG: What advice do you have for trombonists who seek a jazz-related career?\n\nIR: Work hard; be inspired; go deep into the material; imitate your heroes; transcribe solos; and go to sessions and to concerts. And most of all, work hard on the instrument. Jazz musicians nowadays have to play at the same technical level as classical players. Our music is very demanding. Composers like Maria Schneider and Bob Brookmeyer write music on a par with classical music’s performance techniques.\n\nAnd besides the technical skills that you have to develop, you have to take improvisation really seriously. Improvisation is not a big secret—I think everybody can learn to improvise one way or the other—but it is not an easy thing to do. You have to know a lot about harmonies; interval-structures; rhythm; all styles in jazz, Latin-jazz, and jazz-rock; and more.\n\nI have the feeling that jazz music and jazz musicians will be glue between all kinds of music, from classical to world music. It’s because we can handle the instrument in the right way—and that we both read and improvise. And most of the times we can write our own music or arrange the music of other people.\n\nSo despite the fact that it can be hard to make a living as a freelance jazz musician nowadays, it’s the most rewarding way to express yourself. It’s the best choice that I made when I was a kid, anyway.\n\nAG: What’s next for you?\n\nIR: I’m working on a very nice new project with a young vocalist named Elizabeth Simonian. Born on the island of Cyprus to a Swedish mother and Armenian father, Elizabeth found her way to Holland to study music. The project is called Around the World. It’s built around the sphere of Scandinavian and Mediterranean jazz and includes traditionals, originals by some jazz musicians, and new compositions by Elizabeth and me.\n\nIt’s great to work with this group; it takes me to another direction in music: more world music rather than jazz. I’m also doing a lot of writing for several groups, including The Metropole Orchestra and Ben van Dijk. And I’m playing with some bands as a sideman, such as Nueva Manteca, Cubop City Big Band, and The Houdini’s. In the next year I will play with a Italian quartet featuring Emanuele Cisi, traveling Italy.\n\n————————————-(begin sidebar)—————————————\n\nWeb Site:\n\n<www.iljareijngoud.com>\n\nSuggested Discography:\n\nAS A LEADER:\n\nTHE SHAKESPEARE ALBUM (Aliud Records), 2009\n\nUNTAMED WORLD (Maxanter Music), 2008\n\nLIVE IN AMSTERDAM, DVD, (Munich Records), 2005\n\nNEW ARRIVAL (Munich Records), 2003\n\nAS A CO-LEADER:\n\nMEMORIES OF THE FUTURE, Bart van Lier/Ilja Reijngoud Quintet (Munich Records), 2003\n\nNEMESIS, Nemesis Quartet (Challenge A-Records), 1996\n\nCHASIN’ THE GENERAL, The Houdini’s, (Munich Records), 2003\n\nAS A SIDEMAN:\n\nPORTRAIT OF A SILK THREAD, Dutch Jazz Orchestra, (Challenge Records), 1995\n\nARSENIO, Cubop City Big Band, (Tam Tam Records), 2002\n\nSTRANGE FRUIT, Trijntje Oosterhuis and The Houdini’s, (Blue Note), 2004\n\nREVOLUTIONS, Jim Beard, (Intuition Music), 2008\n\nMUSIC FOR STRING QUARTET AND ORCHESTRA, Bob Brookmeyer (Challenge Records), 2008\n\nA GOOD THING, Gino Vannelli (CMM), 2008"
