        "text": "Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim, often hailed as one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, was a pivotal figure in the development and global popularization of bossa nova music. Born on January 25, 1927, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this iconic musician exhibited an early attraction towards music, particularly that which encapsulated the spirit of his Brazilian heritage. He studied music theory, harmony, and composition in his youth, laying the foundation for his phenomenal career. Jobim's professional journey began in the late 1950s when he teamed up with poet Vinicius de Moraes to write a play. This collaboration became a cornerstone for Jobim's career, leading to the creation of songs like \"Se Todos Fossem Iguais a Você\" and \"A Felicidade\", both of which later became classic pieces of the bossa nova canon. However, it was the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", co-written with de Moraes and Norman Gimbel, that catapulted Jobim to international fame. This Grammy-winning song went on to become one of the most recorded songs in history, firmly establishing Jobim's position among the greats of world music. Over his career, Jobim composed more than 400 songs, many of which have been covered by prominent musicians worldwide. His compositions seamlessly blended elements of jazz with traditional Brazilian rhythms, producing a unique sound that left an indelible mark on the music industry. Jobim passed away in 1994, but his legacy continues to live on. His contributions to bossa nova and world music have been celebrated posthumously with numerous honors, including induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Latin Grammy Trustees Award.\n\nCaetano Emanuel Viana Telles Veloso (Portuguese pronunciation: [kaeˈtɐ̃nu emanuˈɛw viˈɐ̃nɐ ˈtɛlis veˈlozu]; born August 7, 1942) is a Brazilian composer, singer, guitarist, writer, and political activist. Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement Tropicalismo, which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the Brazilian military dictatorship. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards. On November 14, 2012, Veloso was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of José Telles Velloso (Seu Zeca), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (Dona Canô), a housewife. He was born in the city of Santo Amaro da Purificação, in Bahia, a state in the eastern area of Brazil, but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the founders of Tropicalismo with a group of several other musicians and artists—including his sister Maria Bethânia—in the same period. However the Brazilian government at the time viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician Gilberto Gil, in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing. He later became popular outside Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHeitor Villa-Lobos (UK: , US: , Portuguese: [ejˈtoʁ ˌvilɐ ˈlobus]; March 5, 1887 – November 17, 1959) was a Brazilian composer, conductor, cellist, pianist, and guitarist described as \"the single most significant creative figure in 20th-century Brazilian art music\". Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous orchestral, chamber, instrumental and vocal works, totaling over 2000 works by his death in 1959. His music was influenced by both Brazilian folk music and by stylistic elements from the European classical tradition, as exemplified by his Bachianas Brasileiras (Brazilian Bachian-pieces). His Etudes for guitar (1929) were dedicated to Andrés Segovia, while his 5 Preludes (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d’Almeida, a.k.a. \"Mindinha.\" Both are important works in the guitar repertory.\n\nJorge Duilio Lima Menezes (born March 22, 1942), is a Brazilian popular musician, performing under the stage name Jorge Ben Jor since the 1980s, though commonly known by his former stage name Jorge Ben (Portuguese: [ˈʒɔʁʒi ˈbẽj]). His characteristic style fuses samba, funk, rock and bossa nova with lyrics that blend humor and satire with often esoteric subject matter. His hits include \"Chove Chuva\", \"Mas Que Nada\", \"Ive Brussel\" and \"Balança Pena\", and have been interpreted by artists such as Caetano Veloso, Sérgio Mendes, Miriam Makeba, and Marisa Monte. Ben's broad-minded and original approach to samba led him through participation in some of Brazilian popular music's most important musical movements, such as bossa nova, Jovem Guarda, and Tropicália, with the latter period defined by his albums Jorge Ben (1969) and Fôrça Bruta (1970). He has been called \"the father of samba rock\", by Billboard magazine. According to American music critic Robert Christgau, Ben and his contemporary Gilberto Gil were \"always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses\"."
