        "text": "Mark teaches single and duo lessons on guitar, bass, ukulele, songwriting, & music theory in all styles and genres to ages 5 and up (no age limit), beginner to advanced.\n\nHe has worked with dozens of special needs kids and adults, acquiring the patience and skills to also successfully teach those who consider themselves slow learners.\n\nThe focus of his instruction often involves teaching the student his or her favorite riffs and songs while simultaneously sharing the “ear training” skills which allow him or her to eventually solve the mystery of “self-instruction”. He can also accommodate the varying learning pace, needs, and desires of each student/client.\n\nMark has developed special drills for organizing left & right hands as well as unique methods for learning chord movements, strumming & picking patterns, and “intuitive memorization”.\n\nThis journey began in 1982 teaching guitar lessons out of his parent’s garage, continuing on and off on a part-time basis (adding bass and ukulele) until it became his primary source of income in 1996, one year after graduating from Sonoma State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Music, Cum Laude in 1995. He won a prestigious Evert B. Person music scholarship in 1994.\n\nMark has been teaching, performing, and recording professionally (solo, duos, bands) for over 30 years all over the Bay Area, mostly with “cover bands” playing everything from classic rock and soul, ska/reggae, blues, jazz, folk to Italian festival music, World music, and so much more.\n\nPlease view his website (www.lessonsonstrings.com) and Yelp page (yelp.com/biz/guitar-lessons-by-mark-benjamin-lafayette) for more info, including an array of verified student/ client reviews, songs from student recitals and other performances, and his original music.\n\nMichael Bang received a B.A. from UCLA and an M.A. from San Francisco State University in music composition. He has been teaching for over 15 years and is skilled at many instruments as well as subjects such as songwriting, home recording, and music theory. His approach to teaching is all about the student. Everyone learns differently, and Michael tailors his lessons to the idiosyncrasies of each person. He encourages everyone to learn multiple instruments, especially very young students. He teaches all ages, and restrictions such as genre, style, or method do not exist in his classes. The goal is always to have fun and see improvement with each lesson!\n\nActive in the local music scene, Michael plays with indie rock band The Riot Professor, garage rock band Tell Me Tell Me, organizes various jazz combos, performs his own solo avant-classical-folk material, and even writes classical chamber music.\n\nBobby has been teaching voice and piano in the Lamorinda area for 14 years. She studied at the Cape Cod Conservatory, the Boston Conservatory, the San Domenico Conservatory and the University of the Pacific.\n\nBobby has been a professional singer since age fourteen. She recorded for Warner Bros Records and Liberty/ UA Records and was nominated for a Grammy in the pop/jazz category. Bobby has performed all over the U. S. at major venues in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Nashville and Las Vegas. She has appeared on many local and national TV shows including The Johnny Cash Show, The Steve Allen Show, The Jonathan Winter’s Show, and the Dinah Shore Show. Bobby has performed in pop, jazz and cabaret venues all over the Bay Area and has won the San Francisco Cabaret Gold Award.\n\nBobby has also had a successful career performing on hundreds of radio and TV commercials including: The Gap, Honda Toyota, Bank of America, Visa, C&H Sugar, A&W Rootbeer, Rice-A-Roni, Safeway and Levi’s.\n\n​\n\n“In teaching both piano and voice I make sure the students receive all the basic fundamentals of music. Then I help them take these basic principals and apply them to various styles of music. We then begin to explore the emotional expression that brings music to life. I strive to make the student’s experience with me not only educational, but also enjoyable. I encourage them to take the love and pleasure of making music with them for life.”\n\nTerry Branam is a professional drummer, author, transcriber, educator, graphic designer and software developer. His work has been featured in many of the industry’s leading publications such as Modern Drummer Magazine, Percussive Arts Society, Hudson Music, Drumhead Magazine and www.drummerworld.com to name a few. He is currently involved as a transcriber and book layout/graphic designer for Hudson Music, Modern Drummer Media, and Wizdom Media as well as contributing to many freelance projects within the industry. Recently, Terry released a tempo/timing app with Gavin Harrison called “Perfect Rhythm” that is currently available for iOS devices on the App Store.\n\n​\n\nAs a performing musician, he has been active over the years within the Chicago and San Francisco music scenes performing with such artists as Jim Peterik (Survivor), Stephanie Rogers, Dayna Malow, SOCKET, Albino! Afrobeat, Matthew Charles Heulitt (Narada Michael Walden), and the highly acclaimed Bay Area prog rock band Raze the Maze.\n\n​\n\nTerry has been teaching for over 30 years, covering virtually every style of music. The most important thing to him is ensuring his students have the most fun while learning at the highest level possible. He uses modern-day technology and “out-of-the-box\" teaching methods within his drum lessons to give his students the tools they will need to survive in today’s music industry.\n\n​\n\nHe deeply enjoys music, and his enthusiasm resonates through the successes of his students!\n\nJen has been teaching at Lamorinda Music since it opened in July of 2009. For four years she assisted in the 4th and 5th grade strings classes at Lafayette Elementary School, Springhill, Burton Valley, and Happy Valley. She also worked as a sectional coach for the Acalanes Violists.\n\nJen has studied the violin and viola for more than 25 years with private instructors, group lessons, and orchestras. She began with classical violin and in 2005 earned a degree from the University of Michigan in classical viola performance. Since her graduation Jen has studied folk guitar with singing, old-time banjo, and a variety of fiddling styles including bluegrass, old-time, and Irish.\n\nIn 2012 Jen received her California teaching certification and is qualified to teach music in the public schools from kindergarten through high school. Jen loves playing and teaching a variety of musical styles and instruments and believes in music as community building. Her goal is for each lesson to be fun, inspiring, and productive. She is currently accepting private students ages eight and older and also does small group classes.\n\nKarl's musical journey started at the Dulce Nombre de Maria Agana Cathedral Bascilica in 1995 as a member of Magnificat, the Agana Cathedral youth choir, Guam U.S.A.
