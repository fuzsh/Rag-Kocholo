        "text": "Born in Sao Joao da Boa Vista, Sao Paulo, Brazil, Badi began studying guitar at the age of fourteen under the tutelage of her father, Jorge, and her brothers Sergio and Odair-the world-renown Duo Assad. As a singer, Badi was chiefly inspired by the talent of her mother, Angelina Assad. In 1984, Badi won the Concurso Jovens Instrumentistas (Young Instrumentalists Contest) and later went on to study guitar at a conservatory in Rio de Janeiro in 1985. Badi wrote Antagonismus in 1988, a solo work where she performed as guitarist, singer, actress and dancer. 1989 saw the release of Danca dos Tons, her first record. In the next few years, Badi performed in numerous important festivals with artists such as Hermeno Pascoal, Milton Nacimento, Pat Metheny, Francoise-Emmanuelle Denis, Mike Stern, Dori Caymmi, the Duo Assad and others. In 1994, she released her first album with Chesky Records, Solo, which quickly launched her career worldwide. Her follow-up, Rhythms, was a tremendous success, garnering a Best Classical Guitar Album nod from the readers of Guitar Player, Best Classical Guitarist from Acoustic Guitar, and scores of other accolades. Badi has been featured numerous times on NPR, appeared on television, and continues to bring her music to fans at festivals and concerts around the globe."
