The benefited projects should be supported by letters from the venue where the exhibition takes place and by organizers (curator, artist, producer, manager).\n\nRESEARCH\n\nIncludes curatorial and/or theoretical-historical researches in process that contribute to the diagnosis and dialogue of contemporary art. Accepted projects must address fields closely related and committed to the study of contemporary artistic practices, and they will result in an exhibition, a publication or an artwork. Funds may be used to support travel expenses, archival research, interviews, materials, among other items.\n\nARTIST RESEARCH\n\nThis support will be given to mid-career artists to develop any part of professional projects. Accepted projects could be in situ art projects or artist residences in institutions considering research and analysis of particular contexts. A prestigious institution and letters of recommendation must back these proposals.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nThis field supports the publication of projects that contribute with its contents and format to promote the understanding, study, and reflection of contemporary art. Accepted projects should be ready for editing and / or publication. The end result can be a physical or digital publication."
