        "text": "Capping a decade of trailblazing exhibitions and programs that have made it Mexico’s leading institution of contemporary art, Museo Jumex will celebrate its 10th anniversary beginning November 2023.\n\nEstablished in Mexico City as the main platform of Fundación Jumex Arte Contemporáneo and created by philanthropist, art collector and Foundation president Eugenio López Alonso, Museo Jumex has achieved international recognition for its dual mission of bringing works of renowned international artists to Mexico for the first time and elevating the work of today’s Mexican and Latin American artists. To commemorate its anniversary, Museo Jumex presents a building-wide exhibition of works from the Colección Jumex, guest-curated by Lisa Phillips, and a commemorative book from Rizzoli International Publications.\n\n“I am deeply proud of everything Museo Jumex has accomplished over the past decade and look forward to the insights and experiences we will offer our wide and diverse audience in the future,” said Eugenio López Alonso. “Museo Jumex has contributed to a thriving Mexico City contemporary art culture with international reach, where innovative art from around the world shares the stage with outstanding works by artists from Mexico and Latin America. To everyone who has participated in our 10-year journey to this milestone, I give my thanks.”\n\nMuseo Jumex’s 10th anniversary exhibition, titled Everything Gets Lighter, presents works from the Colección Jumex by 70 international artists. While providing a critical survey of the collection, with works created between 1964 and 2020, the exhibition highlights poetic and personal responses to light as a healing force for today’s issues. Considering “light” as both illumination and freedom from gravity, Everything Gets Lighter invites audiences to explore themes of ecology, identity, society and spirit through extraordinary contemporary sculptures, installations and paintings. As part of Everything Gets Lighter, Museo Jumex will present Waterfall (1998), a large-scale sculpture by Olafur Eliasson in the museum’s plaza.\n\nIn 2024, in celebration of the anniversary, Rizzoli will publish a book documenting all the exhibitions over the past 10 years, featuring important contributions from internationally renowned artists and curators such as Jeff Koons, Melanie Smith, Jessica Morgan, Humberto Moro, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Patrick Charpenel, María Minera, David Chipperfield and Massimiliano Gioni.\n\nMonumental art installations presented on the museum’s public plaza have included Urs Fischer’s monumental Lovers (2022), Gonzalo Lebrija’s Breve Historia del Tiempo (Brief History of Time) (2020) and Seated Ballerina (2019) by Jeff Koons. Projects including Fritz Haeg & Nils Norman: Proposals for a Plaza; Rirkrit Tiravanija: UFO (Universal Fantastic Occupation) and Michael Lin: Mariposa B1-09 have provided space for public interaction and participation.\n\nAs part of its core mission to bring contemporary art to the public, Museo Jumex’s exhibitions are accompanied by public, community and educational programs in the building and off site. Programs include workshops, lectures, artist-led talks and exhibition tours, symposiums, family activities, guided tours for schools and general audiences, volunteer outreach initiatives and digital projects reaching more than 5,000 people a year."
