Miami-Dade's international\n\n? ? business\n\n» Must-Know Contacts\n\n? ? Meet the players » Strengths/Weaknesses\n\nMiami-Dade has long laid claim to the title of \"Gateway to the Americas,\" and its geographic proximity and cultural affinity for Latin America and the Caribbean have made it an ideal focal point for international business within the hemisphere. In recent years, the area has also attracted interest from European and Asian companies looking for a base from which to enter U.S., Latin American and Caribbean markets.\n\nMiami International Airport and the Port of Miami, the county's largest economic engines, drive the international flow of goods and people to and through the area, and the preponderance of international residents and business expertise has made trade in professional services a growing part of the economy. Law firms, financial services, accounting and healthcare all have significant international components. At the same time, the county faces competition from Atlanta, Houston, Panama City (Panama) and São Paulo (Brazil), each striving to be the center of Latin American business.\n\nMore than 1,100 multinational companies oversee more than $221 billion in annual revenue from offices in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties, according to WorldCity's \"Who's Here\" study. More than 75% of those offices are in Miami-Dade."
