        "text": "MEXICO CITY — Churning and wired, this city is a place of many devotions. Some of them revolve around art. Worshipers throng the Señora de Guadalupe shrine to gaze on a miraculous painting of the Virgin. Secular pilgrims on the hunt for saints crowd Casa Azul, “The Blue House,” Frida Kahlo’s home. Every tourist makes a must-see stop at the National Museum of Anthropology with its hair-raising sculptures of Aztec gods.\n\nBy comparison, relatively few devotees, domestic or foreign, seem to find their way to the city’s museums of contemporary art, of which there are several. Nor are any of those museums firmly fixed on the route followed by the packs of art professionals — curators, collectors, dealers — who ritually travel the planet from one art fair or biennial to the next.\n\nBut with the recent opening of a new museum here, the Museo Jumex (pronounced WHO-mex), at least one institution may find a place on that circuit. That, at least, seems to be the hope of Eugenio López Alonso, heir to the Grupo Jumex fruit-juice empire, who conceived the Jumex as a private museum with internationalist ambitions but a style of its own.\n\nMr. López began to collect some two decades ago, when he was in his 20s, first buying historical pieces of 1960s art, then concentrating on Mexican and international work of his own generation, the ’90s, when Mexico City was buzzing with inventive young artists. His present contemporary collection of more than 2,700 pieces is thought to be the largest of its kind in Latin America. To accommodate it, in 2001 he carved out a display space within the vast complex of Jumex factory buildings in the rough-and-tumble suburb Ecatepec de Morelos to the north."
