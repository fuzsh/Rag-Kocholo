        "text": "Jumex is a very popular brand of juice and nectar in Mexico, as well as with Hispanic consumers in the United States. Jumex is a 100% Mexican company with great values and traditions Grupo Jumex (Jumex Group) was founded on April 27th, 1961, as Empacadora de frutas y jugos (Fruit and Juice Packing, Inc.). Back then the company only had 20 employees, and the company focused on extracting juices and developing nectars with the best fruit production in the country. That same year on the 6th of July, 1961 Jumex released its first production: a 350 ml can of apple juice with no litography and just a label with the Frugo brand on it, and sold to the public for $1.65. Other fruits started being packed after that. Three years later in 1964, came the little blue can in its 350ml presentation, now trademarked under the Jumex name. It can be said that ever since that moment, Jumex has became recognized as the best company of Juices and nectars in Mexico as it earned the trust of consumers from its beginnings. A year later in 1965 production was in high demand, and the Jumex Company had grown a lot.
