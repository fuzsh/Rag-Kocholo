The project approaches language as a tool to reflect power relations, hierarchies, social differences, and historical problems, as well as a cultural system of belonging that can indicate the loss or reconfiguration of certain kinds of identities. The participating artists engage local and historical issues by using experimental language to create a dialogue with the audience, exploring issues of âcustomâ as cultural tradition, U.S. Customs as an immigration agency, and lowrider customization in popular culture.\n\nHappenings\n\nJanuary 29, 2016 Anibal Vallejo: TRANSBORDER https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/anibal-vallejo-transborder/\n\nArtists: Cyrcle, Jan KalÃ¡b, Ox, Rero, Andrey Zignnatto, and AnÃ­bal Vallejo.\n\nTRANSBORDER\n\nJanuary 30 â February 28, 2016\n\nFabien Castanier Gallery\n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA\n\nThe exhibition centers around artists who challenge the idea of boundaries within art, both physical and ideological borders. Each artist presents new work for TRANSBORDER, examining the transitory elements of shape, color, form, and context within art making. The group exhibition takes a survey of how the language of both abstraction and figurative form can be conveyed throughout vastly different corners of the world. Across borders of both time and space, these artists have created connectivity and conversation through creation.\n\nFrom the curator\n\nThis exhibition aims to bring together, in a single physical space, artists from five nationalities, while also focusing on the artistsâ variations in approaches, practices and techniques. So why did I want to bring these artists together in the same space and time? But also, why Transborder?\n\nFirstly, art is for me a pretext for meetings and travel. Art is above all a human adventure. However art is also a coming together of objects, materials, and works that evoke an âemotional shockâ that drives viewers to evolve ideas, perceptions, life trajectories and constructs of reality. I ask you to search your memory for a time that you, as a viewer, experienced a work by an artist you did not know, yet you sensed an inexplicable vibration. That same sensation in that precise moment has driven my desire to curate Transborder, to evoke these emotionally compelled experiences in viewers.\n\nI have the feeling that what unites us all is the fact that we are all in the âfoldâ, i.e. that we have decided to place ourselves consciously or unconsciously to the limit of inside and outside as Michel Foucault suggested. âWe must escape the alternative of outside and inside: we must be the border.â\n\nTOP: Jan KalÃ¡b | Black Planes, acrylic on cut-through canvases, 44 x 48 in.

PÃ©rez Collection\n\nCurated by Patricia Hanna and Anelys Alvarez\n\nDecember 3-6, 2015\n\nMana Contemporary\n\nMiami, FL, USA\n\nDespite the fact that these artists are working in a globalized society, where technology and communication transcend physical boundaries, many continue to construct personal and cultural identities by exploring ideas that are specific to their own experiences and places of origin. The show will examine the idea of building such an identity; how artists use abstraction, architecture, politics and memory to carve out a sense of place; and how these concerns are reflected in PÃ©rez as a collector and in Miami as a developing city. Artists in the show include a mix of well-known and emerging art stars from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay, including: Omar Barquet, JosÃ© Bedia, Jorge MÃ©ndez Blake, Carlos CÃ¡rdenas, Los Carpinteros, Enrique MartÃ­nez Celaya, Eugenio Dittborn, Gonzalo Fuenmayor, Carlos Garaicoa, Guillermo Kuitca, Gilda Mantilla, Moris, Vik Muniz, Oscar MuÃ±oz, DamiÃ¡n Ortega, Liliana Porter, Sandra Ramos, Pablo Rasgado, Camilo Restrepo, Graciela Sacco, Ana Tiscornia, JosÃ© A. Vincench, Ishmael Randall Weeks, and many others.\n\nJorge M. PÃ©rez was named one of the most influential Hispanics in the U.S. by TIME magazine, and is considered a visionary for his contributions to South Floridaâs cultural and artistic landscape, as well as his integration of world-class art into each of his real estate developments.\n\nA Sense of Place is being held at Mana Wynwood Convention Center, 318 NW 23rd Street, Miami, Florida.\n\nHappenings\n\nDecember 3, 2015 Soledad Arias: The Weight of Light https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/soledad-arias-weight-light/\n\nArtists: Fariba Abedin, Adela Andea, Soledad Arias and Lorraine Tady.\n\nThe Weight of Light\n\nDecember 5, 2015- January 2, 2016\n\nRudolph Blume Fine Art / ArtScan Gallery\n\nHouston, TX, USA\n\nThe visible light spectrum is quite dramatic and holds all the colors that humans can see; a beam of white light is made up of all the colors. Visible light is composed of photons, which are the most abundant particles in the universe. These weight-less particles have the ability to form a stream or wave-like pattern that makes up the wavelengths of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Contrast of hue, in painting, enables the painter to establish the interplay of luminous forces. Black and white are the artistâs strongest tools to express darkness and light, but with the advancement in harnessing different light particles, neon and LED lights are new and exciting instruments.This exhibition explores and juxtaposes the visual parameters of light as a physical presence and asa symbolic conjecture.\n\nSoledad Ariasâ work has been exhibited extensively in museums throughout the US and South America. Her wall based neon sculptures engage the viewer with mostly trivial, yet emotionally charged words like âwhite liesâ or âlike you i forgotâ. The impact of the brilliant luminescence and the halo effect of the neon writing potentially transforms the immanence and perception of these phrases.\n\nHappenings\n\nDecember 3, 2015 Arocha + Schraenen, Elena Damiani, Jorge Pedro NÃºÃ±ez & Sergio Vega: The Devil is in the details https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/arocha-schraenen-elena-damiani-jorge-pedro-nunez-sergio-vega-devil-details/\n\nArtists: IvÃ¡n Argote, Arocha + Schraenen, Lothar Baumgarten, Matthew Buckingham, Elena Damiani, Adler Guerrier, Jorge Pedro NÃºÃ±ez, Edgar Orlaineta, Laercio Redondo, Matheus Rocha Pitta, Sergio Vega.\n\nThe Devil is in the details\n\nCurated by Jesus Fuenmayor\n\nSeptember 17 â November 20, 2015\n\nKaBe Contemporary\n\nMiami, FL, USA\n\nThe title of the exhibition âThe Devil is in the detailsâ pretends to point towards the detailsâ appearances in a work of art that unexpectedly allow viewers to comprehend the work (and even history) in a different way, even when this reading betrays our expectations or completely twists a workâs initial intention. Instead of just speaking about how important the use of historiography is for this group of artists, the show draws attention to what Roland Barthes used to call the âPunctum.â That is, that detail in an image (or work) that escapes its own structure, shooting out like an âarrowâ towards the viewer. The artists selected for this exhibition have turned to the representation of history not just as material itself but also as means by which to criticize how history is constructed. They are not just interested in the past tense or simply reviving archival strategies, but in putting the past in relation to the present and the future, creating overlapping temporalities that bring disparate moments together. scottrade site down\n\nHappenings\n\nOctober 28, 2015 Gabriel Sierra: Numbers in a Room https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/gabriel-sierra-numbers-room/\n\nArtist: Gabriel Sierra\n\nNumbers in a Room\n\nSeptember 20, 2015 â January 4, 2015\n\nSculpture Center\n\nNew York, USA\n\nBy modifying and extending the guiding information of the exhibition space, Sierra will restructure the lower level galleries, effacing and confusing distinctions between the architecture, the institution, and the works that comprise the exhibition. The combination of alternative and existing floor plans, signage, and objects in the space all refer to the codes for viewing and maneuvering through the context of an exhibition.\n\nIncreasingly layered in Sierraâs presentation, the various structures comprising an exhibition in an institution create a mirroring effect, where each thing recalls another thing. This indexical accumulation makes it unclear exactly where the exhibition begins and ends, bringing into question the semantics of the various navigational prompts within art institutions. The exhibition structure asks that the visitor adjust to its new form.\n\nSierra (born 1975, San Juan Nepomuceno, Colombia) is based in BogotÃ¡, Colombia and has had solo exhibitions at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago (2015) and Peep-Hole in Milan (2013). Recent group exhibitions include the 56th Carnegie International, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (2013); The Ungovernables, New Museum Triennial, New Museum, New York (2012); and the 12th Istanbul Biennial (2011).\n\nHappenings\n\nOctober 14, 2015 Pia Camil, NicolÃ¡s Consuegra, Elena Damiani, Ximena Garrido-Lecca, Amalia Pica, Pablo Rasgado, Gabriel Sierra and Clarissa Tossin: United States of Latin America https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/united-states-latin-america/\n\nArtists: Pablo Accinelli, Edgardo AragÃ³n, Juan Araujo, Felipe Arturo, NicolÃ¡s Bacal, Milena Bonilla, Paloma BosquÃª, Pia Camil, Bevenuto Chavajay, Marcelo Cidade, Donna Conlon & Jonathan Harker, NicolÃ¡s Consuegra, Minerva Cuevas, Elena Damiani, Mariana Castillo Deball, Ximena Garrido-Lecca, Federico Herrero, Voluspa Jarpa, Runo Lagomarsino, Adriana Lara, Engel Leonardo, Valentina Liernur, Mateo LÃ³pez, Renata Lucas, Daniel Steegmann MangranÃ©, NicolÃ¡s Paris, Amalia Pica, Pablo Rasgado, Pedro Reyes, AdriÃ¡n Villar Rojas, Gabriel Sierra, Clarissa Tossin, Carla Zaccagnini.\n\nUnited States of Latin America\n\nCurated by Jens Hoffmann and Pablo LeÃ³n de la Barra\n\nSeptember 18, 2015 â January 3, 2016\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art\n\nDetroit, MI, USA\n\nThe exhibition United States of Latin America brings together more than thirty emerging artists from Latin America, many of whom will be exhibiting in the United States for the first time.\n\nThe show is based on an ongoing conversation between two curators, Jens Hoffmann and Pablo LeÃ³n de la Barra, who for a number of years have exchanged research and information about artists, artworks, and the overall development of the art world from Mexico to Argentina and the many countries in between. The exhibition is an extension of this dialogue into the galleries of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit via artworks suggested in dialogue format.\n\nUnited States of Latin America features a wide range of works in a variety of mediums, for instance a series of photographs about housing in Havana, a film about the effects of gang violence in Mexico, sculptures reflecting on the involvement of the CIA in Latin American dictatorships, drawings of historical monuments from the future, a floor map about the selling of Brazilian rubber to the United States, boulders from a Colombian river that have been turned into flip-flops, and paintings about the interplay of modernist houses, tropical vegetation, and utopian architecture. The individual artworks touch upon themes such as geography, history, urbanism, memory, colonialism, architecture, war, modernism, social inequality, regionalism, and power. Given how Latin Americaâs realities oscillate between the colonial and the contemporary, between severe economic hardships and enormous financial expansions, between flourishing democracies and suppressive dictatorships, and between great progress and immense regression, the exhibition presents an intentionally fragmented survey, a deliberately disjointed overview, of the region and the art being made there. It allows the viewer a glimpse into a reality that may seem geographically near, but is in many ways far away and unfamiliar.\n\nThe curators invited a number of writers and curators from throughout Latin America to contribute to a glossary of terms that articulate the regionâs historical landscape and conceptual syntax. This glossary will be published in the exhibition catalogue along with a conversation between the curators, texts on all of the artists, images of the exhibited artworks, and a roundtable discussion featuring a number of curators based in Latin America.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with Kadist Art Foundation, United States of Latin America is curated by Jens Hoffmann, MOCAD senior curator at large, and Pablo LeÃ³n de la Barra, guest curator. A range of public programs and educational activities will run concurrently with the exhibition, including a public conversation with the curators, lectures by some of the participating artists, film screenings, and performances.\n\nHappenings\n\nOctober 6, 2015 Marco Maggi: Unfolding https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/marco-maggi-unfolding/\n\nArtist: Marco Maggi\n\nUnfolding\n\nSeptember 10 â October 24, 2015\n\nJosÃ©e Bienvenu Gallery\n\nNew York, NY, USA\n\nLike in the Venice pavilion, Maggi separates the two basic elements of drawing. He draws with paper on the walls in the main space, and presents an installation of pencils in a separate area. âDrawing is a dialogue with a superficy and a certain superficiality. It is a superficial discipline that allows oneself to take distance from the depths of thinking in order to de-multiply an empathy for the insignificant. Drawing for me is like writing in a language that I donât understand. I donât believe in messages or ideas. Ideas have the tendency to become fixed and aspire ultimately to the status of ideology.â (Marco Maggi, 2015)\n\nA portable kit composed of thousands of elements cut-out from self-adhesive paper becomes an insignificant alphabet folded and pasted onto the walls during the months preceding the exhibition. The diminutive papers are disseminated or connected following the traffic rules and syntax dictated by any accumulation of sediments. Some areas throughout the gallery are infected with color, the edge of the wall in red, blue or yellow, like the margins of a misprinted sheet of paper. The colonies of stickers on the walls enter in dialogue with the light upon them. Myriads of shadows and infinitesimal incandescent projections aim to slow down the viewer. The main ambition of the project is to promote pauses and make time visible.\n\nIn Putinâs Pencils, ten pencils are pointed against the wall, held by the tensions of bowstrings, ten arrows ready to be projected. The trajectory of these Soviet era color pencils is frozen, almost going backward in time. Leading to the project room, a ladder made of Fanfold, the already obsolete perforated computer paper, grows upward and downward from two dimensions to three-dimensional space in a symbiosis of hardware and software. Inside the room, two individual panels of cutout stickers face each other. Another wall installation, Stacking Quotes (Black Cachet), suspends bound sketchbooks with fragments of colored stickers pressed within their pages. These small referential stickers act as words cut out from a larger message, recoding the original context.\n\nBorn in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1957, Marco Maggi lives and works in New Paltz, NY and Montevideo, Uruguay.

Collectively, a dialogue surrounding this concept is excavated from Veraâs and Pelenurâs parallel bodies of work, to raise thought provoking questions that are inherent to humanityâs progression on earth, as well as, within society. How can humanity move forward in connection with the land, and how does oneâs consciousness allow this process to unfold? Such primordial concerns with existence have continued through ancient times into contemporary civilization. To investigate Vera and Pelenur in this vein brings to light the association of physical and cerebral conditions, which are key to the balancing act that humanity must perform throughout time.\n\nClaudio Veraâs newest body of work is intensely contemporary and sensual, evolving seamlessly from his most recent series of wooden sculptures. Veraâs works on paper are created through a similar, physically intensive process of carving blocks of wood; however, instead of sculpting the artist deconstructs flat wooden surfaces and turns them into topographies, territories, physical maps, where we can wander endlessly. Vera has consciously altered his medium of choice â a conceptual reflection on deliberate transformation that exists in the structures of nature, the cosmos, and the ideas of contemporary science explored by humankind. Veraâs roots are linked to the Latin American tradition of the âSchool of the South,â as the artist studied for many years under one of JoaquÃ­n Torres GarcÃ­aâs most famous pupils, Julio Alpuy. Like his teacher, Veraâs work embraces and dissolves boundaries, revealing an intimate relation between mankind and the natural world, derived from a deep understanding of organic structures and systems.Martin Pelenurâs newest body of work manifests itself through his use of paint and other synthetic mediums on paper: some forms are painted dense and heavy on the surface, thick with pigment, yet others take on fragile and crystalline structures that seem to emulate the delicate nature of inner thought. Still more, a final group of works are made with commercial packaging tape arranged in lattice form on paper. Each variation of Pelenurâs work shows a progressive creation of simple forms via the human mind. In 2006, the artist started his own self-promoted âPelenur Scholarship,â based out of his studio Ciudad Vieja â translated as âOld City.â Pelenurâs approach to scholarship is untraditional, and his actions in doing so become an extension of his ongoing practice as an artist who explicitly devotes himself to the research of painterly materials and their collaboration with the âmental driftâ that is an integral part of the evolution of society. For Pelenur, the act of painting is an experiment in thought and the inner human discourse that is methodic and repetitive when studied in depth. Even more so, perhaps his superficially manufactured scholarship is reflected in his preferred use of synthetic materials, as opposed to organic, when exploring the progressive nature of human thought.\n\nHappenings\n\nOctober 2, 2015 Monochrome Undone https://abstractioninaction.com/projects/monochrome-undone/\n\nMonochrome Undone\n\nSPACE Collection\n\nCurated by Cecilia Fajardo-Hill\n\nOctober 24, 2015 â April 1, 2016\n\nSPACE, Irvine, CA\n\nArtists: Ricardo Alcaide, Alejandra Barreda, AndrÃ©s Bedoya*, Emilio Chapela, Eduardo Costa, Danilo DueÃ±as, Magdalena FernÃ¡ndez, Valentina Liernur, Marco Maggi, Manuel MÃ©rida, Gabriel de la Mora, Miguel Angel RÃ­os, Lester RodrÃ­guez, Eduardo Santiere, Emilia AzcÃ¡rate, Marta ChilindrÃ³n, Bruno Dubner, RubÃ©n OrtÃ­z-Torres, Fidel Sclavo, Renata Tassinari, Georgina Bringas, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Thomas Glassford, JosÃ© Luis Landet, Jorge de LeÃ³n, Bernardo Ortiz, Martin Pelenur, Teresa Pereda, Pablo Rasgado, Ricardo RendÃ³n, Santiago Reyes Villaveces, Mariela Scafati, Gabriel Sierra, Jaime Tarazona, AdÃ¡n Vallecillo, Horacio Zabala.\n\nThe monochrome as a focus in the SPACE Collection began in a spontaneous form and soon became a systematic field of research. This exhibition is about the contemporary monochrome in Latin America. The monochrome is one of the most elusive and complex art forms of modern and contemporary art. If we think about its origins or meaning, we find that the monochrome is many contradictory things. The monochrome is neither a movement nor a category; it is not an âismâ or a thing. It may be painting as object, the material surface of the work itself, the denial of perspective or narrative, or anything representational. The monochrome may be a readymade, a found object, or an environmentâanything in which a single color dominates. The monochrome can be critical and unstable, especially when it dialogues critically or in tension with modernism. This exhibition is organized into four different themes: The Everyday Monochrome, The White Monochrome, The Elusive Monochrome and The Transparent Monochrome. These themes have been conceived to create context and suggest interpretations that otherwise might be illegible. These may overlap at times, pointing to the multiplicity of content in many of the works. The unclassifiable and variable nature of the monochrome in Latin America today is borne of self-criticality and from unique Latin contexts, to exist within its own specificity and conceptual urgency.\n\nTo purchase the catalogue click here.\n\nâ\n\nEl monocromo, como enfoque de SPACE Collection, comenzÃ³ de forma espontÃ¡nea y a poco se convirtiÃ³ en un campo de investigaciÃ³n sistemÃ¡tico. Esta exposiciÃ³n trata sobre el monocromo contemporÃ¡neo en AmÃ©rica latina. El monocromo es una de las formas de arte mÃ¡s elusivas y complejas del arte moderno y contemporÃ¡neo. Si reflexionamos acerca de sus orÃ­genes o su significado, nos encontramos con que puede albergar muchas cosas contradictorias. El monocromo no es un movimiento ni una categorÃ­a; no es un âismoâ ni una cosa. Puede ser la pintura como objeto, la superficie material de la obra, la negaciÃ³n de la perspectiva o de todo lo representativo o narrativo. El monocromo puede ser un readymade, un objeto encontrado, un cuadro o un ambiente: cualquier cosa definida como una superficie cromÃ¡ticamente uniforme donde un solo color predomina. El monocromo puede ser crÃ­tico e inestable, especialmente cuando se dialoga crÃ­ticamente o en tensiÃ³n con el modernismo. Esta exposiciÃ³n estÃ¡ organizada en cuatro temas: el monocromo cotidiano, el monocromo blanco, el monocromo elusivo y el monocromo transparente. Estos temas han sido concebidos a fin de crear un contexto y sugerir interpretaciones que de otra manera podrÃ­an ser ilegibles. Ãstos pueden superponerse a veces, apuntando a la multiplicidad de contenidos en muchas de las obras. La naturaleza indeterminada, inclasificable y variable del monocromo en LatinoamÃ©rica hoy en dÃ­a es producto de la autocrÃ­tica y de los contextos propios, para existir dentro de su propia especificidad y urgencia conceptual.\n\nProjects\n\nSeptember 25, 2015 Magdalena FernÃ¡ndez: Solo show https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/magdalena-fernandez-solo-show/\n\nArtist: Magdalena FernÃ¡ndez\n\nMagdalena FernÃ¡ndez\n\nCurated by Alma Ruiz\n\nOctober 3, 2015 â January 3, 2016\n\nMOCA Pacific Design Center\n\nWest Hollywood, CA, USA\n\nMagdalena FernÃ¡ndez is the first major museum exhibition of the artistâs work presented in the United States. Organized by Alma Ruiz, Magdalena FernÃ¡ndez features six videos and one site-specific installation at MOCA Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. A well-known and influential Venezuelan artist, FernÃ¡ndez has built her practice upon the foundation of Latin American modernist abstraction that took root in her native country at the beginning of the 20th century. FernÃ¡ndezâs multidisciplinary work incorporates light, movement, and sound, following traditions established by renowned compatriot artists Gego (1912-94), Alejandro Otero (1921-90), and JesÃºs Rafael Soto (1923-2005). FernÃ¡ndezâs artistic practice is deeply connected to the natural world, especially the tropical fauna and flora of Caracas, as well as to formal modernist sensibilities. Her extensive background in graphic designâacquired as a student at the Instituto de DiseÃ±o FundaciÃ³n Neumann, and later as a designer in the studio of minimalist Italian architect-designer A.G. Fronzoni (1923-2002)âhas greatly influenced the visual, sensorial, and experiential aspects that distinguish her work.\n\nThe artist has stood out as one of the most innovating artist of contemporary geometric abstraction. Her multidisciplinary work conjugates light, sound and contemporary criteria of space and use of materials, with some formal concepts of the traditional legacy of optical and geometrical abstraction. FernÃ¡ndezâs video-artistic practice explores the possible relations between abstraction and nature. In her work, the artist proposes a dialogue of visual and sensorial perceptions with space, transforming geometry and abstraction into nature for the senses.\n\nImage: Magdalena FernaÌndez, 1pmS011, 2011, video installation, dimensions variable, photo by Ricardo JimeÌnez, courtesy of Centro Cultural Chacao and the artist.

From a distance, the stacks of thousands of sheets of paper (24,549 total) that are set out in a grid onto the floor suggest a landscape, circuit boards, or an architectural model for an imagined city. Viewed more intimately, delicate sculptural forms have been cut and raised from the top layer of paper, creating shadows that extend along the paperâs surface. The perplexing abstract language of Maggiâs tiny incised paper sculptures promotes longer viewing time and shifts our bodily relationship to an intimate viewing experience.\n\nAccompanying Maggiâs sculptural installation is a related two-dimensional work, Global Myopia (2001), made by carefully pressing into aluminum foil. The network of impressions made to the malleable metalâs surface acts as the artistâs method of drawing, developed from his interest in the printmaking technique of plate etching. He creates a patchwork of lines that impart a sense of movement across the surface of the piece. The pairing of these works emphasizes Maggiâs ability to call attention to the transformation of everyday materials he often uses, such as coated office paper, aluminum foil, apple skins, and plexiglass, as detailed and poetic expressions of the expanded language of contemporary drawing.\n\nMarco Maggi was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He earned his MFA from the State University of New York, New Paltz, and had his first solo museum exhibition at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in 2001. Maggi is representing Uruguay with a site-specific installation of paper and pencils, Global Myopia II, on view through November 22, 2015, at the Venice Biennale in Italy. The Uruguayan pavilion is one of the twenty-nine national pavilions located in the Giardini della Biennale.\n\nHappenings\n\nSeptember 15, 2015 Raquel Rabonivich: Collaborative Performance https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/raquel-rabonivich-collaborative-performance/\n\nArtists: Raquel Rabinovich, Jule Manna, Linda Mary Montano.\n\n7 Hour Collaborative Glandathon: Dance, Pray, Bless at Nancy Donskojâs\n\nAugust 29, 2015\n\nThe Storefront Gallery\n\nKingston, NY, USA\n\nA SEVEN HOUR EXPERIENCE GIVING GRATITUDE TO THE 7 GLANDS\n\nActions:\n\n.

Working together over a two-year period, Open Sessions artists participate in ongoing studio visits and discussions, punctuated by small group exhibitions at The Drawing Center, as well as other self-organized shows in New York and abroad.\n\nName It by Trying to Name It: Open Sessions 2014-15 includes all artists in the program, giving the first floor of the museum over to an exploration of contemporary drawing, encompassing performance, video, sculpture, and installation, as well as traditional drawing forms. The showâs numerous collaborations, in which ideas and materials are shared, emphasize the mediumâs flexibility and process-oriented nature. The exhibition will evolve over its six-week run, as some artworks enter and exit in two-week cycles, while others remain constant throughout the showâs run. Taken as a whole, Name It by Trying to Name It presents a window into nearly two years of thinking about drawing.\n\nHappenings\n\nAugust 20, 2015 Emilia AzcÃ¡rate, Marta ChilindrÃ³n, Diana de Solares & Mariela Scafati: Folding: Line, Space & Body https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/emilia-azcarate-marta-chilindron-diana-de-solares-mariela-scafati-folding-line-space-body/\n\nArtists: Regina Aprijaskis, Emilia AzcÃ¡rate, Valerie Brathwaite, Feliza Bursztyn, Marta ChilindrÃ³n, Mirtha Dermisache, Diana de Solares, NoemÃ­ Escandell, MarÃ­a Freire, Gego (Gertrud Goldschmidt), Anna Bella Geiger, Mercedes Elena GonzÃ¡lez, Ana Mercedes Hoyos, Elizabeth Jobim, Judith Lauand, Ana Maria Maiolino, Marta MinujÃ­n, Mercedes Pardo, Liliana Porter, Margot RÃ¶mer, Lotty Rosenfeld, Ana Sacerdote, Fanny SanÃ­n, Adriana Santiago, Mariela Scafati, Antonieta Sosa, and Yeni & Nan.\n\nFolding: Line, Space & Body / Latin American Women Artists Working Around Abstracion\n\nCurated by AimÃ© Iglesias Lukin\n\nJuly 9 â August 21, 2015\n\nHenrique Faria Fine Art\n\nNY, NY, USA\n\nFolding is the action through which a line turns into a figure, a plane becomes tridimensional, and a painting becomes an object. And beyond all these actions, we see how representation becomes presentation.\n\nSince the historical avant-garde, the quest for an art that transcended the representation of reality has led artists to create abstract art and to focus on the material objecthood of a painting or sculpture. This exhibition presents the work of Latin American women artists from the 1950s through the present day, showing the different ways in which they worked with abstraction and geometry to explore the space of the artwork and that of the spectator, as mediated by the body.\n\nLatin American abstraction has gained recognition worldwide in the last decade. Exhibitions like âInverted Utopias,â curated by Mari Carmen RamÃ­rez and HÃ©ctor Olea in 2004 and âThe Geometry of Hope,â curated by Gabriel PÃ©rez-Barreiro in 2007, presented the diverse abstract movements that developed in the Post War Latin American metropolis, from JoaquÃ­n Torres GarcÃ­a and Escuela del Sur in Montevideo, to Arte Concreto InvenciÃ³n and MadÃ­ in Buenos Aires, the Ruptura group in SÃ£o Paulo and the work of Alejandro Otero and JesÃºs Rafael Soto in Caracas.\n\nIn all of these avant-garde scenes, women artists gainedânot without struggleâa place of recognition and a social circle in which they could develop their profession with relative tolerance. Still, except a few exceptions like Gego, Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape, it is mostly male artists we see represented in museums and art history books. This exhibition does not intend to resolve that problem, which is of a much larger scale, but aims to present some of their production and to explore the formal and creative connections among this diverse group of artists from the continent. This show also chooses to escape the historical understanding of abstraction, which is referred to here not as the Post-war movement but more broadly as a creative strategy that has continued through the decades. In this way, Judith Lauandâs planimetric work of 1960 can be seen alongside the contemporary pyramidal sculptures of Marta ChilindrÃ³n, and the use of the grid in 1950s and 1960s abstraction can be observed in Anna Bella Geigerâs video Passagens II from 1974 or in Emilia Azcarateâs Sudoku series from 2009.\n\nThe earliest-made piece in the show is that of Uruguayan artist MarÃ­a Freire, who co-founded in 1952 the group Arte No-Figurativo along with her husband JosÃ© Pedro Costigliolo, Antonio Llorens and other artists. Works like ComposiciÃ³n vertical (1956), show her interest in orthogonal compositions and planar superimpositions, which along with her use of line demonstrate her interest not simply in abstraction and space but more specifically in dynamism. In a similar spirit, but resulting in a very different work, Judith Lauandâs Concrete 178 (1960) presents a flat geometric composition, in monochrome grays, that through a careful use of lines and planes suggests a volumetric and angular surface. Known as the âDama do concretismo,â Lauand was the only female member of Brazilâs Grupo Ruptura, and created unique works through a very personal use of geometry, mathematics and space.\n\nIn contrast, Mercedes Pardoâs acrylic painting Untitled (c. 1975) explores space recession not through line but using color fields. The Venezuelan artist, who was a pioneer of abstract art in Venezuela along with her husband Alejandro Otero, focused on a sensorial use of color in abstract compositions to achieve the autonomy of painting. Along with Pardo, the other representative of geometric abstraction from Venezuela in this exhibition is Margot RÃ¶mer, whose triptych from the series Plomos Despojados (1995) uses the panel subdivisions to present three variations of a rectangular structure by alternating the color distribution. A similar emphasis in color is seen in Acrylic No. 7, painted in 1978 by Colombian artist Fanny SanÃ­n, who creates a complex arrangement of intersecting rectangles of different purple hues. This simple alteration of tone in one color still allows SanÃ­n to create a rich composition of receding planes that suggests rhythmic movement and dynamism. Indeed, movement is directly incorporated in Essai de Couleur AnimÃ©e, a film made by Ana Sacerdote in between 1959 and 1965 in which she interposes geometric chromatic compositions, animating their shapes.\n\nThe case of Regina Aprijaskis exemplifies the difficulties of being a woman artist and of combining work and personal life. The Peruvian artist was developing a fruitful career and became interested in abstraction in the 1950s and 1960s after two trips to New York, but abandoned painting in 1970 following the coup dâÃ©tat in Peru two years earlier, to work alongside her husband in his factory. Her 1996 acrylic painting Negro, rojo y blanco demonstrates how her interest in geometric abstraction stayed intact after a 26-year hiatus, at the same time the choice of the Peruvian flagâs colors seems to speak directly about her countryâs political and social struggles.\n\nOther works in the show leave color aside and refer to the white monochrome also with the means of exploring geometry and space. That is the case of Ana Mercedes Hoyosâ 1970s series AtmÃ³sferas, where subtle variations of white hues suggest surfaces on the canvas. Similarly, Anna Maria Maiolinoâs Light Image (1971) depends on a simple square embossing on paper to invoke the tradition of the monochrome. The square is also the theme of Gegoâs Dibujo sin papel 79/14, made in 1979. Famous for her ReticulÃ¡reas, or net sculptures, in this work the Venezuelan artist uses wire and metal to frame a piece of the wall, allowing the shadow to become part of the work, continuing the integration of work and exhibition space that allowed her work to spatially affect the spectator.\n\nThe relationship between the gallery space and the visitorâs body became a main topic of interest for artists in the late 1960s, notably within Minimalism and among Western artists, but similar creative inquiries were being made in Latin America. Argentinean artist NoemÃ­ Escandell created sculptural projects such as Rectangles and Squares and Volumes, Bodies and Displacements, both from 1966, in which basic geometric shapes are combined in odd dispositions to affect the tridimensional perception of the object. In Venezuela, Antonieta Sosa was doing similar work with pieces like Stable-Unstable (1967/2014), which put into question geometry and the laws of gravity while simultaneously presenting organically aesthetic objects.\n\nThe body would later be presented directly, rather than invoked, in the work of artists such as Liliana Porter and Yeni & Nan. The Argentine is represented with her 1973 work Untitled (Line), in which her finger is photographed as interrupting a line, one that transcends the frame of the work onto the real space of the wall. In the Polaroid series Cuerpo y lÃ­nea (1977), the Venezuelan duo Yeni & Nan position their bodies along the geometric designs of a tennis court, evolving the linear and geometric tradition of their home country to include performance and body art.\n\nThe urban space is also the canvas chosen by Brazilian conceptual artist Anna Bella Geiger, whose video Passagens II (1974) shows her body creating diagonal trajectories in the grid-like formation of the steps of a stairway. In a similar approach, Lotty Rosenfeldâs ongoing series GeometrÃ­a de la lÃ­nea, begun in 1979, intervenes the infinite number of broken white lines that divide a road with intersecting, transversal lines, in a formal but also powerfully political performance associated to her participation in the CADA group protesting the dictatorship in Chile. The relationship between geometry and power is explicit in Marta MinujÃ­nâs The Obelisk Lying Down (1978). The work, created for the first Latin American Biennial in SÃ£o Pablo, presents the geometrical structure of the famous monumental form lying down, allowing spectators to walk through it in a democratizing and desacralizing gesture.\n\nIn the exhibition we also encounter more expressive uses of abstraction, where experimentation with materials led to more free-flowing forms. This is the case of Mirtha Dermisacheâs graphisms from the 1970s, where the lines drawn by the Argentine artist sinuously move to create abstract texts. The abstract sculpture Untitled (1981) by Colombian artist Feliza Brusztyn, who in 1967 created the famous series of motorized sculptures Las histÃ©ricas, also combines dissonant materials into visually striking, amorphous objects. Trinidanian artist Valerie Brathwaite opts for anti-geometric shapes in her Soft Bodies, a series initiated in 2011, where the hanging and floor fabric sculptures play fluidly between the borders of figuration and abstraction.\n\nAfter all these decades, geometry is still very much present in the work of younger artists. Sometimes the continuity takes place by claiming geometric abstraction directly, like Mercedes Elena GonzÃ¡lezâs series September 1955 (2014), which re-conceptualizes the cover of the inaugural issue of the art and architecture magazine Integral to reevaluate the legacy of modernism in Venezuela. Others adapt geometric abstraction into new formats, like the wood piece Untitled (Free Construction No. 1) (2005) by Diana de Solares. In the case of Elizabeth Jobimâs Wall (2015), geometric shapes invade the wall and floor, overlapping each other and creating optical layers. Emilia AzcÃ¡rateâs Untitled (Sudoku), from 2009 takes the grid of that game as influence and codifies numbers into colors, allowing her to create a meditative abstraction that juxtaposes the gameâs problem with its solution. Formally opposite to this grid but equally colorful is Adriana Santiagoâs Untitled from the series Maracaibo (2015), which combines pompoms into a frame in a playful and appealing tactile composition. The work of Marta ChilindrÃ³n retakes the tradition of dynamic planes and shapes of Gego and Lygia Clark but includes color as a key part of her manipulable works such as 27 Triangles (2011). Finally, Mariela Scafati goes back to the original questions of abstract painting in her works Tu nombre completo and Nueve minutos exactos, both from 2015, which literally âthrough bondage ropesâ and conceptually âby transforming them into objectsâ tense the possibilities of what a painting can be: not a representation but an object, a body itself.\n\nThese interactions between the artwork, its surrounding spaces and the bodies that interact with it are present through the sixty years in which these artworks were created. The formal explorations initiated by the historical avant-gardes have not, as proven by the younger generation, exhausted themselves. This group of women artists from Latin America offer a wide range of answers to these questions, all personal but also collective. The line and the plane not only folded but became the body, expanding the shape of art above and beyond.\n\nAimÃ© Iglesias Lukin\n\nHappenings\n\nAugust 18, 2015 Gabriel Sierra & Clarissa Tossin: MetaModern https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/gabriel-sierra-clarissa-tossin-metamodern/\n\nArtists: Conrad Bakker, Constantin Boym, Kendell Carter, Jordi Colomer, William Cordova, Elmgreen & Dragset, Fernanda Fragateiro, Terence Gower, Brian Jungen, Olga Koumoundouros, Jill Magid, IÃ±igo Manglano-Ovalle, Dorit Margreiter, Josiah McElheny, Edgar Orlaineta, Gabriel Sierra, Simon Starling, Clarissa Tossin, Barbara Visser, and James Welling.\n\nMetaModern\n\nMay 30 â August 30, 2015\n\nScottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art\n\nScottsdale, AZ, USA\n\nThe fresh and provocative artworks presented in MetaModern refer literally and conceptually to modernist design objects of the mid-century. These historic objects have gained the status of icons. It is a testament to their enduring power that they now catalyze a generation of artists too young to have experienced modernism firsthand.\n\nThe notion of modernist design and architecture had its genesis in Europe, particularly during an intense decade of experimentation at the Bauhaus beginning in Weimar, Germany, in 1919. Function and utility were the schoolâs ethos, while the use of modern materials, honesty of form, and an embrace of abstraction were its hallmarks. World War II shifted the activity to this side of the ocean, as European practitioners, including Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Richard Neutra emigrated to the United States and joined the faculties of American architectural schools. Modernism was held as truth by the generations of students they trained: emerging in the 1960s and â70s, these young designers felt they had arrived at a place beyond style. Modernism was the pure and true mode in which to design everything from typography to furniture to architecture.\n\nWhen architects, those removed by several generations from the birth of modernism, came to maturity as designersââFrank Gehry, Charles Moore, and Robert Venturiââthey challenged all that modernism had embraced. Their vocabulary included fanciful embellishment, applied color, decorative patterning, and references to historical styles.\n\nNow, over 90 years after the revolution at the Bauhaus, modernism continues to spark a passion in designers and collectors. The prices of signature objects of the classic modernist era are soaring, and its buildings are being restored and valued as historical monuments. Although vintage Eames rockers have been integrated into contemporary high-end living rooms, they are quite different in these new eclectic contexts. Similarly, artists who incorporate iconic modernist designs in their work today often produce recombinations and modifications that result in an entirely unique mixââor meta, meaning beyond, changed, self-referential, and abstracted from another concept. Using classic elements in new configurations, these artists are making original works of art that comment on the claims of the past in light of the complexities of the present.\n\nThe artists in this exhibition, most of whom were born in the 1960s, adopt the actual vocabulary of the modern movement to question the content of its style and its relationship to history. Their work challenges the tenets of modernism head on. Often ironic and witty, the works in this exhibition offer a thoughtful critique of innumerable issues that extend across the fields of design and history.\n\nHappenings\n\nAugust 12, 2015 Dario Escobar: Summer Hang https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/dario-escobar-summer-hang/\n\nArtists: Ana Bidart, Linus Bill + Adrien Horni, Jonathan Callan, Jacob El Hanani, Dario Escobar, and Julianne Swartz.\n\nSummer Hang\n\nThrough August 12, 2015\n\nJosÃ©e Bienvenu\n\nNew York, USA\n\nAna Bidart explores the possibilities and more so, the impossibilities of drawing. She brings found objects together in space and across time, and her works establish a tangible record of ephemeral relationships encountered. With Disappointme nt she reconstitutes meaning in the potential interaction between a compass, that does not draw, and a coiled wire, that is precariously suspended.\n\nSwiss artists Linus Bill and Adrien Horni create collages and paintings with powerful aesthetics, bold gestures and brave dimensions. Bill and Horni produce work by assembling smaller collages, which later become part of a larger collage. They only determine a final result after countless trials and manipulations to the images (physically and digitally). With NY P.5 TL, the pair continues their ongoing explorations of process, form, and presentational strategy by combining inkjet printing, silkscreen, painting, drawing, and assemblage.\n\nJonathan Callan explores the relationship of disembodied knowledge to embodied experience and materiality, working with publications â books, maps, and photographs â as a source material.Entertaining is made up of 72 separate pages from a cookbook, isolating a single dish or ingredient on each page and removing everything else with sandpaper. Together the dishes (though legible as food when close up) appear as strange planets or discs in space. Some of the dishes are isolated and then completely removed, leaving a ghostly blank. Along with all the pieces where a single aspect of a page is highlighted, Entertaining explores the illustrative notion of the self, the removal of context and the substitution of a painterly space. In fact the background can often seem rendered with pastel or even fresco, and Callan likes to think of Entertaining as a composition of drawings.\n\nJacob El Hananiâs work draws upon the tradition of micrography in Judaism, a technique utilized in decoration and transcribing holy texts. El Hanani creates highly intricate works, like Circle and Line, through the painstaking repetition of minuscule marks repeated thousands of times using ink on paper or canvas. He draws these images without magnification; in order to reduce eyestrain, he rests every ten minutes. The end result is a work of extraordinary detail that appears to be a pattern from a distance, and speaks of the passage of time and the link between the microscopic and the infinite.\n\nDario Escobar is renowned for his sculptural re-contextualization of everyday objects. His work explores concepts of cultural and historical hybridity ultimately attempting to reexamine Western art history from a Guatemalan perspective. Reticula, part of Dario Escobarâs âultramodernoâ project commenting on the failed utopia of modernism in Central America, 50 pool triangles made in Taiwan becomes a relief, and its composition follows a modern grid. Escobarâs work, characterized by the use of materials charged with historical and symbolic meaning, is articulated in a minimalist language like in Yellow Composition, a linseed oil drawing, and the wall sculpture.\n\nJulianne Swartzâs sound works explore the entanglement of subjectivities and sensations through multilayered arrangements. In Almaâs Blanket Israel, sounds are harvested from the everyday: fragments of recordings from people, nature, instruments and environments. Some are intimate, some generic, some identifiable, and some obscure. These sounds, entwined together, weave in and out of aural focus to make a symphonic collage. The dense textile of woven and knotted, colored electrical wires, forms a series of functional circuits that distribute four channels of sound to the numerous speakers interleaved in the weaving.\n\nHappenings\n\nAugust 12, 2015 Ivan Navarro: Storylines https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/ivan-navarro-storylines/\n\nArtists: PaweÅ Althamer, Julieta Aranda, Matthew Barney, Kevin Beasley, John Bock, Carol Bove, Ernesto Caivano, Mariana Castillo Deball, Maurizio Cattelan, Trisha Donnelly, Shannon Ebner, Simon Fujiwara, Ellie Ga, Gerard & Kelly, Simryn Gill, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Rachel Harrison, Camille Henrot, Juliana Huxtable, Rashid Johnson, Matt Keegan, Agnieszka Kurant, Mark Leckey, Lee Bul, Zoe Leonard, Glenn Ligon, Sharon Lockhart, Nate Lowman, Mark Manders, Ryan McGinley, Josephine Meckseper, Zanele Muholi, IvÃ¡n Navarro, Catherine Opie, Gabriel Orozco, Laura Owens, Katie Paterson, R.

In Western culture, painting and sculpture initially evolved to illuminate narratives of religion, patronage, and power. Over the centuries, genre scenes, still lifes, and portraitsâoften created as intricate allegories for religious or historical subject matterâbecame popular as the narrative role of art expanded. In the twentieth century, with the advent of abstraction as a radical break with the past, many artists associated with the avant-garde rejected the figurative and, hence, eliminated explicit narrative content. In the United States and Europe, this tendency culminated during the 1960s and 1970s in Minimal painting and sculpture that foregrounded geometric abstraction and in Post-Minimalismâs examination of process and materiality. The 1980s witnessed a resurgence of figurative art, much of which harked back to expressionistic styles of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nDuring the 1990s, a generation of younger artists embraced the concept of storytelling to articulate the politics of identity and difference, investing both abstract and representational forms with narrative content. Storylines opens with key examples from that decade, which serve as thematic anchors and highlight the museumâs own exhibition history. Most of the works on view, however, were created after 2005 and offer an expansive view of the new paradigms for storytelling forged during the past ten years to communicate ideas about race, gender, sexuality, history, and politics, among other trenchant themes.\n\nBringing together over one hundred works from the Guggenheimâs contemporary collection, Storylines examines the diverse ways in which artists today engage narrative through installation, painting, photography, sculpture, video, and performance. For these artists, storytelling does not necessarily require plots, characters, or settings. Rather, narrative potential lies in everyday objects and materials, and their embedded cultural associations. In projects created through extensive research, acts of appropriation, or performance, the artists in Storylines uncover layers of meaning, turning to individual experience as a means of conveying shared stories, whether real or fictional.\n\nThe recent narrative turn in contemporary art cannot be separated from the current age of social media with its reverberating cycles of communication, dissemination, and interpretation. Seemingly every aspect of life is now subject to commentary and circulation via digital text and images. These new narrative frames highlight the roles that each of us can play as both author and reader, foregrounding the fact that meaning is contingent in todayâs interconnected and multivalent world. As a means of celebrating this dynamic, the museum has invited writers to contribute reflectionsâin prose or poetryâon selected works in Storylines. Engaging the rich historical relationship between literature and art, the resulting polyphony signals the diverse interpretive potential that lies within each object on display. Visitors may access these texts using the Guggenheim app or in booklets located throughout the museum.\n\nHappenings\n\nJuly 21, 2015 Lucia Koch: Solo show https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/lucia-koch-solo-show/\n\nArtist: Lucia Koch\n\nLucia Koch, let there be a set X\n\nJuly 10 â September 4, 2015\n\nChristopher Grimes Gallery\n\nSanta Monica, CA, USA\n\nThroughout her career Lucia Koch has become known for her interventions within existing architecture, either through her use of sculpture, photography, video or colored filters. In this, her second exhibition with the gallery, she will intersect the entire space with a gradient printed on fabric â something that moves in space but is constant, subtle, transformative and never repeating. In addition, ordinary windows will be replaced with colored panels disrupting oneâs expectation, and images of small, empty containers enlarged to architectural scale disassociate the photographs from their references and challenge how we relate to space. Through all of these strategies, Koch elevates basic elements of architecture to effect change in oneâs immediate atmosphere and physical surroundings.\n\nLucia Koch (b. 1966, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. She has recently participated inProspect 3, New Orleans, LA (2015), curated by Franklin Sirmans; Cruzamentos: Contemporary Art in Brazil, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH (2014); A Sense of Place, Pier 24 Photography, San Francisco, CA (2014); and Re-emerge: Towards a New Cultural Cartography, 11th Sharjah Biennial, United Arab Emirates (2013). She has been included in the 11th Biennale de Lyon, France (2011); 27th Bienal de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (2006); 2nd, 5th and 8th editions of the Mercosul Biennial in Porto Alegre, Brazil (1999, 2005 and 2011); and the 8th Istanbul Biennial, Istanbul, Turkey (2003). Her work has been included in such exhibitions as, Another Place, Museum of Modern Art of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (2011), andWhen Lives Become Form, Yerba Buena Center for Arts, San Francisco, CA (2009), which was also on view at Contemporary Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan (2008). Kochâs work is in the collections of such institutions as Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA; Pinacoteca do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and Museu de Arte Moderna de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, among others. In 2016 she will be the subject of a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nHappenings\n\nJuly 16, 2015 Marcius Galan: Empty House Casa Vazia https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/marcius-galan-empty-house-casa-vazia/\n\nArtists: Waltercio Caldas, Lygia Clark, Raymundo Colares, Adriano Costa, Alexandre da Cunha, AmÃ­lcar de Castro, Willys de Castro, Antonio Dias, Marcius Galan, Fernanda Gomes, Jac Leirner, Rodrigo Matheus, Paulo Monteiro, HÃ©lio Oiticica, Lygia Pape, Mira Schendel, Tunga, and Erika Verzutti.\n\nEmpty House Casa Vazia\n\nJun 27 â August 28, 2014\n\nLuhring Augustine\n\nNYC, NY, USA\n\nEmpty House Casa Vazia is a sculpture exhibition featuring a cross-generational group of Brazilian artists whose works engage the legacy of 1950s Neoconcretism. Challenging the rationalism and universal objectivity of early abstraction, the artists associated with this movement sought a means of expression beyond an objectâs immutable formal properties, and embraced a phenomenological, at times participatory, approach in their efforts to expand the vocabulary of sculpture.Empty House Casa Vazia does not aim to tell a genealogical story. Rather, the exhibition forefronts the experiential here-and-now of the works presented, as well as sets the stage for diverse dialogues between iconic historical works and recent statements in contemporary sculpture. These conceptually rigorous and sometimes unassuming works offer critical insight into questions of materiality, tactility, and space. They are drawn together by a shared artistic language that emphasizes an economy of means and, most importantly, by a poetic, often playful sensibility.\n\nHappenings\n\nJuly 9, 2015 IvÃ¡n Navarro & Ishmael Randall Weeks: New Ways of Seeing https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/ivan-navarro-ishmael-randall-weeks-new-ways-seeing/\n\nArtists: Claudia Alvarez, Afruz Amighi, Rina Banerjee, Christian Ruiz Berman, Sanford Biggers, Cui Fei, Leonardo Drew, Rashawn Griffin, Rachel Eliza Griffiths, Wenda Gu, Ginny Huo, Tamiko Kawata, IvÃ¡n Navarro & Courtney Smith, Kambui Olujimi, Cecilia Paredes, Soo Sunny Park, Yinka Shonibare, Nari Ward, and Ishmael Randall Weeks.\n\nNew Ways of Seeing: Beyond Culture\n\nMay 10 â July 12, 2015\n\nDorsky Gallery â Curatorial Programs\n\nLong Island City, NY, USA\n\nNew Ways of Seeing: Beyond Culture features works by emerging and seasoned artists of African/ African American, Asian/Asian American, Latino/ Hispanic, and Middle Eastern heritages who are changing and expanding the vocabulary and agendas of the art world by injecting ideas from their world cultures and experiences. These proactive artists utilize materials and imagery in innovative ways that address themes including race, gender, ritual, craft, and language. Their materials often challenge existing associations and subvert expectations. They break down barriers to create new mythologies. Their works conflate the local and global, past and present, fact and fiction. These artists are âtranscending the limits of individual cultures.â1\n\nThe phrase âNew Ways of Seeingâ acknowledges that many past and present interpretations of culture are flawed, incomplete, or even false. As we know, scholars from ancient to Post-Colonial and Postmodern times had different views and agendas, often excluding women. In another direction, cultures borrow from, adapt, and change each other in myriad ways.\n\nHappenings\n\nJuly 8, 2015 Marcius Galan, Bernardo Ortiz & Eduardo Terrazas: NOW! https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/marcius-galan-bernardo-ortiz-eduardo-terrazas-now/\n\nArtists: Kim Allen, Kari Altmann, Marcela Armas, Jeremy Bailey, Diego Berruecos, Zach Blas, Mariana Castillo Deball, Marcelo Cidade, Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker, Sterling Crispin, Debora Delmar Corp., de_sitio, Claudia FernÃ¡ndez, Francisco FernÃ¡ndez, RadamÃ©s âJuniâ Figueroa, LaToya Ruby Frazie, Melissa Furness, Coco Fusco, Marcius Galan, Anna Bella Geiger, CristÃ³bal Gracia, David Hartt, Karl Haendel, Sarah Anne Johnson, AndrÃ© Komatsu, Robert Longo, Jorge Macchi, Laleh Mehran and Chris Coleman, Erick Meyenberg, Adam Milner, Nuria Montiel and Fernando Palma, Daniel Monroy Cuevas, Aliza Nisenbaum, Fernando Ortega, Bernardo Ortiz, Adam Pendleton, Tania PÃ©rez CÃ³rdova, Jorge Satorre, JoaquÃ­n Segura, Matt Scobey, Skawennati, Eduardo Terrazas, and Ryan Trecartin.\n\nNOW!\n\nJuly 14âAugust 30, 2015\n\n2015 Biennial of the Americas\n\nDenver, CO, USA\n\nThe 2015 Biennial of the Americas is the third iteration of this international festival of ideas, art and culture in Denver, Colorado. The theme of the 2015 Biennial of the Americas is NOW! Today we stand on shifting ground, with one foot in a new geological era and one foot lingering on the structures of the past. The 2015 Biennial of the Americas will dive deep into our present circumstances, seeking to understand contexts, conditions, and challenges across the western hemisphere today.\n\nArtistic program\n\nArtists featured in the 2015 Biennial of the Americas from North, South and Central America and the Caribbean create visual art, music and dance in response to current issues and questions. They address specific situations where they live, as well as concerns shared across borders such as violence, environmental issues, technology, and social justice. Mexico City will form a particular focus in the program following the Biennial of the Americas Mexico City Summit held in June 2014.\n\nProgram highlights\n\nThe artists in the central exhibition of the Biennial of the Americas, Now? NOW! at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver capture complexities of now in the Western Hemisphere. The exhibition OÃ­d el SueÃ±o de una Palabra / Listen to the Dream of a Word at the Biennial Pavilion in Downtown Denver results from a collaboration facilitated by Mexico City curatorial collective de_sitio. They invited a group of practitioners from different disciplines to interact with Museo Comunitario del Valle de Xico, a small, yet exemplary community organization in a marginal outskirt southeast of Mexico City. Vis-Ã -vis: Biennial Ambassadors Residency Exhibition at McNichols Civic Center features four ambitious new projects by artists Matt Scobey (US), Melissa Furness (US), CristÃ³bal Gracia (Mexico) and Daniel Monroy Cuevas (Mexico) developed through the 2015 Biennial Ambassadors Program. Aimed at nurturing creative links and deepening artistic dialogue across the Americas, the program focused for 2015 on connecting Denver and Mexico City through a series of ten-week residency exchanges run by contemporary art organizations ArtPlant and SOMA. Major public commissions by Mexico-based artists Erick Meyenberg and Marcela Armas examine the connection between Denverâs present, past and future.\n\nOpening week festival and arts professional preview\n\nJuly 14 to 19, all-day programming precedes evening symposia, and late night events celebrate the opening of Biennial venues. New this year is the Biennial Pavilion, a site for talks, workshops and performances, programmed with events throughout the summer.\n\nOther highlights include a week-long residency of public performances and workshops by Brazilâs Companhia Urbana de DanÃ§a, presented in collaboration with the Newman Center for the Performing Arts, and a rare presentation of Matthew Barneyâs latest film, River of Fundament, co-presented by the Clyfford Still Museum and Denver Art Museum.

These works manifest the development of a poetics that employs a wide range of strategies in order to address contemporary issues. Tossinâs objects, videos, and installations explore a broad and intricate spectrum of desires, impasses, and utopias, while also establishing their own expressive logic, above and beyond these topics.\n\nDriven by the curiosity of the artist-anthropologist, Tossinâs works are formed through analysis of the politics of space and urban spaces, as well as interrogations into the mappings and discourses of power, relationships of consumption and identity, circulations of symbols and ideas, and the role of architectureâparticularly that of BrasÃ­lia, a modernist monument that she has come to call âhome.â\n\nThe book is bilingual, in English and Portuguese, and includes texts by Moacir dos Anjos, Michael Ned Holte, and Guilherme Wisnik.

The exhibition will reveal contrasts between Geometric Abstraction, with its idealistic and formalist characteristics, and more personal, exotic and political forms of expression. Works include a video of a flying body crossing the US-Mexico border in a semi-circle trajectory, a ceramic turtle resting over a neo-geo-style cube, and a group of photographs of Minimal-like sculptures and paintings with the artist fashionably posing next to them, among others. This presentation is a prelude âtest-driveâ or ârehearsalâ for an exhibition scheduled for later this year in Santiago, Chile at Die Ecke Arte ContemporÃ¡neo.\n\nHappenings\n\nJune 10, 2015 Ricardo Alcaide, DarÃ­o Escobar & Gabriel de la Mora: LÃ­neas de la Mano https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/ricardo-alcaide-dario-escobar-gabriel-de-la-mora-lineas-de-la-mano/\n\nArtists: Esvin AlarcÃ³n Lam, Ricardo Alcaide, DarÃ­o Escobar, Gianfranco Foschino, Juan Fernando HerrÃ¡n, Harold Mendez, Gabriel de la Mora, Ronny Quevedo, and Ana Maria Tavares.\n\nLÃ­neas de la Mano\n\nMay 12 â July 3, 2015\n\nSicardi Gallery\n\nHouston, TX, USA\n\nFeaturing artists from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela, LÃ­neas de la mano (lines of the hand, lifelines) takes as its premise the idea that geometries connect the quotidian moments of our daily lives. Indeed, a line connects two points, A and B, start and finish, end and beginning; lines are defined by this function of connection, even as they continue to move past the points they connect\n\nThe artists in the exhibition use the languages and conceptual frameworks of modernism and abstraction to suggest poetic connections: between people, between historical referents, between political experiences, and between places. The line as connector becomes a way of skillfully addressing fraught histories, and of weaving a set of relationships. LÃ­neas de la mano also considers the tactility of each object. The works exhibited demonstrate a strong relationship to materials and their histories, from the scrap metal of Guatemalan buses, to the thick, sooty texture of an archival photograph transferred to aluminum, to the fabric retrieved from vintage radio speakers.\n\nThe exhibition title playfully alludes to palmistry; the connection is meant to highlight the actions of the hand, implicit in the creation of the work. Astrologer, numerologist, clairvoyant, and palm-reader Cheiro (William John Warner, 1866-1936) writes, âthe handâ¦ denotes the change going on in the brain, even years before the action of the individual becomes the result of such a change.â Read in a different context, it is a compelling statement about the artistic process.\n\nHappenings\n\nJune 5, 2015 Ana BelÃ©n Cantoni https://abstractioninaction.com/projects/ana-belen-cantoni-projects/\n\nAna BelÃ©n Cantoni\n\nThe Soft Gesture\n\nThe Wooden Floor\n\nSanta Ana, California\n\nThe Soft Gesture, a commission by the Sayago & Pardon collection, is the title of a large-scale installation by Colombian artist Ana BelÃ©n Cantoni, created specifically for The Wooden Floor, Santa Ana, CA. Inspired by the studentsâ testimonies of how art and dance empower their everyday lives, Cantoni evokes the human body and its potential for individual growth within communal coexistence by the usage of simple materials that remind the cycles and processes of transformation through movement (cloth and wooden clothespins, as well as ink and graphite on cotton). The Soft Gesture is a vision towards the awakening of primal associations and the creation through physical connections.\n\nDownload the catalogue here.\n\nâ\n\nEl gesto suave, una comisiÃ³n de arte de la colecciÃ³n Sayago & Pardon, es el tÃ­tulo de la instalaciÃ³n a gran escala de la artista colombiana Ana BelÃ©n Cantoni, creada especÃ­ficamente para The Wooden Floor, una organizaciÃ³n sin fines de lucro que capacita a jÃ³venes de bajos ingresos a travÃ©s del baile y programas acadÃ©micos y familiares en Santa Ana, California.

Then the artist will remove the audio leaving just the moving image signal creating an experience of sound through vision that would change and pulsate according to the properties of the sonic composite. The viewer then is pulled into lavish landscapes of continually reconfigured color and mood.\n\nâIn my processes establishing the material is key, and from there it becomes a reductive process where a vast number of possibilities and outcomes are explored until the work reaches proper momentum, purpose, and significance. Moreover, objectifying the ordinary and reinventing the character of found mundane things in life is very interesting to me.â -Richard Garet\n\nClick here to see video\n\nMore info here\n\nHappenings\n\nMay 29, 2015 Clarissa Tossin: How does it travel? https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/clarissa-tossin-travel/\n\nArtist: Clarissa Tossin\n\nHow does it travel?\n\nMay 29, 2015\n\nSamuel Freeman Gallery\n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA\n\nHow does it travel? brings together photographs, sculptures, prints, and site-specific works that analyze movements and their resulting displacements and transformations.

The five artists participating in Multifarious Abstraction present conceptually challenging, loaded and sometimes political explorations of abstract vocabularies in art, which point to unique ways to experience and think on contemporary culture. The five artists are from Latin America, where the division between high and low culture is not as central or as marked as in The United States and Europe. The abstraction proposed here moves away from modernist utopian ideals and pure aesthetics, to dialogue with industrial and popular culture, daily life, inner struggle, politics and gender.\n\nMagdalena Atria is exhibiting free abstract compositions entirely made with plasticine. The artist, who has developed an extensive oeuvre with this material, addresses painting through a material which is malleable, fragile, common and familiar, to produce slowly complicated surfaces that embody âtension between the rational and the emotional, between the personal and the collective, between the existential and the banal, the formal and the symbolic.â Atria attempts to connect the ideal, manifested through abstraction, with the daily and existential dimensions of concrete reality.\n\nAntonio MuÃ±iz is an artist who explores by an intuitive method ways to free the mind and perception from predetermined responses. He employs fumage, a technique for producing organic forms with a burning candle at varying angles and distance from the canvas, thus creating an uncontrolled compositional structure. MuÃ±iz pursues the âgray areaâ, a multidimensional space that is both symbolic and psychological and deconstructs conditioning dualities such as black/white, outsider/insider, and right/wrong. The artist states: âThe gray area is a non-judgmental, non-linear space where we allow ourselves to interact with our environment, breaking free of duality and of conditioned responses.â\n\nRicardo RendÃ³nâs work is informed by his interest in traditional trades and materials, which are for the artist places of âcreative learningâ. He states: âMy work is presented as a system of questioning of the creative practice, of the execution, productive realization and notion of work.â His mediums range from industrial materials, to sand paper, felt and leather; and his techniques from perforating, cutting, nailing, grinding, sanding, gluing, to welding. For Multifarious Abstraction, the artist exhibits work from the two series: Work Area and Lighting Circuits, with materials such as copper and industrial felt. He transforms a plumberâs purposeful and precise procedure for joining copper tubes into the method for creating free standing sculptures which reflect both on traditional knowledge and on contemporary artâs expansive possibilities.\n\nMariÃ¡ngeles Soto-DÃ­az uses the language of abstraction as a way to materialize and connect ideas. Her work explores critically the legacies of modernism, echoing the particular modern historical traditions of Venezuela in dialogue with modernity and abstraction in contemporary culture. For this exhibition she will be showing the site-specific installation The Pink Elephant in the Room, to insert into the White Cube the discussion of gender and racial inequality in the art world. As the artist explains: âThe Pink Elephant in the Room addresses the âinvisibilityâ of these issues through indulging in the color pink as a feminist statement while also re-signifying upon the language of abstract painting.â\n\nRubÃ©n Ortiz-Torres is a multidisciplinary artist who goes back to the late 1980s. His work, whether it be photographs, paintings, movies or sculptures, is informed by a hybrid and original combination of popular and mass culture. One of the key references in his work is the low rider and car industry cultures. In his recent work, he experiments with the auto industryâs most recent advances in car paint. For example, his piece Womb Envy (2014), is made with urethane and thermochromic paint and high-density foam. This orange piece in the shape of a pregnant tummy, when touched with your fingers, becomes marked temporarily in yellow on the workâs surface. His black Mexican and American flags made with urethane and chromo-luminescent paint, exhibited in the show, refer on the one hand to modern issues of anarchist ideology, and on the other, to how these national symbols, especially in the context of recent events in Mexico and the USA (The Baltimore riots), may allow the political minority standpoints in contemporary society to be embodied.\n\nCecilia Fajardo-Hill is a British/Venezuelan art historian and curator.

In an almost casual and brief gesture, I transform myriad of objects, gathered from everyday life, and compile them into different arrangements and situations. I attempt to give order by measuring my time, my work and my possibilities with certain materials and objects â obsessive repetition allows me to develop unique and personal systems. The work reveals in itself the process of its making, its failure or triumph.\n\nI face every work with curiosity and try to understand how I can intervene the least to achieve the most. I look for an inner logic to my process that might lead the viewer to apparent conclusions.\n\nI like to think of my work as an organized world that welcomes chaos and embraces the power of simplicity.\n\nEn los Ãºltimos aÅos mi trabajo se enfoca en una continua investigaciÃ³n de materiales. En un gesto casi casual, transformo una infinidad de objetos, recolectados de la vida cotidiana y los compilo en diferentes arreglos y situaciones. Intento crear orden por medio de sistemas que me permiten medir mi tiempo, mi trabajo y mis posibilidades con ciertos materiales y objetos. La repeticiÃ³n obsesiva me permite crear sistemas Ãºnicos y personales. El trabajo revela en sÃ­ mismo el proceso de su elaboraciÃ³n , su fracaso o triunfo.\n\nMe enfrento a cada trabajo con curiosidad y trato de entender cÃ³mo puedo hacer mÃ­nimas alteraciones para obtener mÃ¡ximos resultados, como puedo crear una lÃ³gica interna que pueda conducir al espectador a aparentes conclusiones.\n\nMe gusta pensar en mi trabajo como un mundo organizado que acoge el caos y celebra el poder de la simplicidad.\n\nSelected Biographical Information\n\nEducation / Training\n\n2001-2007: MFA, Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nPrizes / Fellowships\n\n2015-2016: Keyholder Residency Program, Lower East Side Printshop, New York, United States.\n\n2000-2007: Scholarships â Masterâs Study Program, Embassy of the Czech Republic, Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n2008: Chateau, Centre for Contemporary Art FUTURA, Czech Republic.\n\n2004: Informal Architecture Workshop/Marjetica Potrc, Salzburg International Summer Academy, Hallein, Austria.\n\nSolo Exhibitions\n\n2014: âMeasuring in Spearsâ, Berloni Gallery, London, England.\n\n2014: âRak on Turâ, Brno House Of Arts, G99, Brno, Czech Republic.\n\n2013: âUnoâ, Subte-Centro Municipal de Exposiciones, Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n2011: âTres/Three/Triâ, Galerie Ferdinanda Baumanna, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2010: âThings named after numbersâ, Ps122, New York, USA.\n\n2010: âDosâ, Espacio de Arte ContemporÃ¡neo, Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n2008: âPart-time artistâ, AM180, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2006: âSome girls wander by mistakeâ, Galerie Mladych, Brno, Czech Republic.\n\n2004: âThanks for comingâ, Galerie im Alcatraz, Hallein, Austria.\n\n2004: âJelenovi pivo nelej (Czech palindrome)â, Foundation for Contemporary Art, Gallery Jeleni, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2003: âThe things made by peopleâ, Foundation for Contemporary Art, Gallery Jeleni, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nGroup Exhibitions\n\n2014: âTunnel and Lighthousesâ, Wallspace Gallery, New York , USA.\n\n2014: âHin Mah Too Yah Lat Kektâ, Gallery AMU, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2013: â5X5 CastellÃ³ 2013, Premi Internacional dâart Contemporani, Espai dâart Contemporaniâ, Espai dâart Contemporani, CastellÃ³, Spain.\n\n2013: âGlobal Localsâ, Gallery NTK, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2012: âVistasâ, University of Maryland, Maryland, USA.\n\n2011: âPrague Biennale 5â, Prague Biennale 5, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2010: Circulo de Bellas Artes, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.\n\n2009: âMelting the Potâ, Czech Cultural Center, New York , USA.\n\n2009: âPocket Utopia, Two-week residency program â, Pocket Utopia, Brooklyn, USA.\n\n2008: âMove onâ, Futura Centre for Contemporary Art, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n2008: âWhen I was a little boy, I used to play with girlsâ, Galerie U BÃ­lÃ©ho jednoroÅ¾ce, Klatovy, Czech Republic.\n\n2008: âContemporary Czech Cubismâ, Old town City Hall Gallery, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nPublications\n\nSilvina Arismendi, Planked Boutique (Paris: Onestar Press).\n\nBerloni Gallery, Measuring in Spears (Berloni).\n\nJiri Ptacek, âFor The Perfect Stranger: Home Inside Outâ, Fotograf Magazine, 2012.\n\nâThe Things Made by Peopleâ, Fotograf Magazine, 2008.\n\nKarel Cisar, âSilvina Arismendiâ, Labyrint Magazine, 2008.\n\nJiri Ptacek, âSilvina Arismendiâ, Umelec Magazine, 2004/2.\n\nCollections\n\nCollection of Estee Lauder Companies Inc., New York, USA.\n\nArtists\n\nMay 18, 2015 Pablo Rasgado: Ellipsis https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/pablo-rasgado-ellipsis/\n\nArtist: Pablo Rasgado\n\nEllipsis\n\nMay 9 â June 6, 2015\n\nSteve Turner Contemporary\n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA\n\nThe show features five bodies of work from the last seven years. Rasgadoâs works deal with such natural phenomena as gravity, light and energy along with their attendant resultsâtime and ephemerality. He uses a variety of familiar materialsâdrywall, glass, tape, florescent bulbs, dirt, spiderwebsâto focus on that which is just beyond ordinary perception. In a sense, each work is a clock, recording decay and change over time. Deceptively simple, the works constitute a compendium of phenomena just beyond the grasp of material experience.\n\nPablo Rasgado (b. Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico, 1984) has had solo exhibitions at Steve Turner, Los Angeles (2011, 2012 & 2014); Arratia Beer, Berlin (2012 & 2014); OMR, Mexico City (2013); and Museo Experimental El Eco, Mexico City (2011). He has also had work in group exhibitions at CAM Raleigh (2014); The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2013); Ex Magazzini di San Cassian, Art Collateral Events, 55th Venice Biennale (2013); Herzlya Museum of Contemporary Art, Israel (2013); Museo Carrillo Gil, Mexico City (2012); and Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City (2010). His work is owned by public collections including Wattis Foundation, San Francisco; Perez Art Museum, Miami; Jumex Collection, Mexico City; and The Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

These works convey a distilled presentation of Garetâs practice, ideas, and interests articulated through his investigation of time, media, material and space. Garetâs immersive approach activates sensorial results in the viewer. His hybrid constructions draw attention to the normative function of noise as a consequence of daily life. Further inspiration and intent in Garetâs work are the objectification of the ordinary and his interest in the multilayered complexities of the mundane.\n\nThe title of the exhibition âMeta-residue: input, material, spaceâ deals with the perception of time, its affects and reception of materiality and space, mediated through the idea of meta-residue identifying the essence of what once was but is no longer tangible. This phenomenon is all around us. Not only as content and evidence of life but also as the mechanics that filter into aesthetics through constructs that are created in response to the felt world.\n\nImage: treating pictures like wire 2, 2015, mixed media, 12â³ X 18â³.\n\nHappenings\n\nMay 7, 2015 Ivelisse Jimenez: Else-weres https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/ivelisse-jimenez-else-weres/\n\nArtist: Ivelisse Jimenez\n\nElse-weres\n\nApril 9 â May 31, 2015\n\nDiana Lowenstein Gallery\n\nMiami, FL, USA\n\nSolo show by artist Ivelisse Jimenez.\n\nImage: Blind Enough #4, 2010, Mixed media on canvas, 54 x 48 in.

The artists address the hypothetical question âwhat if?â â as inspired by Pier Paolo Pasoliniâs 1968 film Teorema â contemplating a world turned upside-down, where social tensions can be amplified to the point of poetic subversion, achieving possible transcendence.\n\nImage: Miguel Andrade Valdez, Encofrado ConstruÃ§Ã£o III, 2015.\n\nHappenings\n\nApril 24, 2015 G.T. Pellizzi: Before Completion https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/g-t-pellizzi-completion/\n\nArtist: G.T. Pellizzi\n\nBefore Completion\n\nJanuary 10 â February 14, 2015\n\nHarmony Murphy Gallery\n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA\n\nThe works in this exhibition are inspired by Hexagram 64 of the I Ching (Book of Changes), colloquially referred to as Before Completion. This section of the ancient augury Chinese text addresses the moment of clarity and illumination in the creative process that exists after a work is resolved, but before it is finished.\n\nThis exhibition will feature site specific wall drawings, sculptures, as well as interior and exterior light pieces. These works utilize the materials and vocabulary of buildings-in progress and construction sites, such as snap lines, plaster, plywood, etc., as metaphorical representations of the construction of any work of art. Referencing Flaubert, who famously said: âBooks are not made like children but like pyramids.\n\nG.T. Pellizzi was born in 1978 in Tlayacapan, Mexico. He studied philosophy at St. Johns College and graduated from The Channin School of Architecture at the Cooper Union. From 2001-2011, Pellizzi co-founded and has been involved in various art collectives, including The Bruce High Quality Foundation, with whom he has exhibited at the Whitney Museum of Art, PS1 MoMA, Centre Pompidou, PAC Murcia, and the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo and various art galleries in New York, Zurich, Berlin and London. In the past year he has participated in exhibitions at the Jeu de Paume in Paris, the Museo del Barrio in New York, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver, and at L&M. Gallery in Los Angeles.

Smith, Sergio De La Torre, and Clarissa Tossin.\n\nIn Search of an Exit\n\nApril 7 â May 3, 2105\n\nCurated by the MA class of 2015: Lucia Fabio, Samantha Greggs, Daniela Lieja, Selene Preciado, Heber Rodriguez\n\nHeritage Square Museum\n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA\n\nThe works in the exhibition present situations where individuals or groups of people find themselves in a space and have to negotiate their existence within pre-established and external conditions. Inspired by Jean Paul Sartreâs 1944 play No Exit, the exhibition considers themes of time, existence, freedom, and collectivity through time-based work. The structure of a given environment is a pervasive yet ever-evolving stimulus of human behavior capable of catalyzing a spectrum of reactions, from cultural resistance to immersion. The works in this exhibition, a selection of video installations, sound works, and performances, address the adaptability of the human condition in response to external circumstances.\n\nThe exhibition will take place at the Heritage Square Museumâa living history museum featuring nineteenth-century buildings from Southern Californiaâa choice of location that highlights the human impulse to preserve artifacts. As the characters in No Exit questioned the peculiarity of their surroundings (a Second Empire-style parlor room), the twenty-first-century artworks stimulate a similar assessment of the three Victorian-era houses into which they are placed. The unique setting additionally highlights the prevalence of the built environment and the effects of architecture as preoccupations for many of the artists in the exhibition.\n\nHappenings\n\nApril 6, 2015 Alberto Borea: Mobility and Its Discontents https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/alberto-borea-mobility-discontents/\n\nArtists: Jane Benson, Alberto Borea, Ãngel Delgado, Javier TÃ©llez, Lan Tuazon, Jorge Wellesley.\n\nMobility and Its Discontents\n\nMarch 6 â May 30, 2015\n\nThe 8th Floor\n\nNY, NY, USA\n\nThe exhibition examines the dynamics of mobility and its physical, psychological, socio-economic, geographic, and political boundaries. Mobility and Its Discontents signals a shift in the Shelley & Donald Rubin Foundationâs mission, now focused on broadening public access to artistic and cultural activities in New York City. Featuring artists from Venezuela, Peru, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines, alongside two Cuban artists from the Shelley and Donald Rubin Private Collection, the show brings the Rubinsâ dedication to contemporary Cuban art into conversation with a wider artistic community, reflecting the diversity of New Yorkâs cultural life. The works in the exhibition convey experiences of separation, isolation, and distance, experienced on both a local and global scale, in sites such as the United States-Mexico border, New York Cityâs financial district, and Havana, Cuba. Collectively, they contribute to a dialogue about the barriers encountered in contemporary life, suggesting possibilities for transformation enabled by connectivity and increased access.\n\nImage: Alberto Borea, âWall Streetâ, 2013\n\nHappenings\n\nApril 4, 2015 Luis RoldÃ¡n: Eidola https://abstractioninaction.com/happenings/luis-roldan-eidola/\n\nArtist: Luis RoldÃ¡n\n\nEidola\n\nApril 2 â May 16, 2015\n\nHenrique Faria Fine Arts\n\nNY, USA\n\nA skull can be read as a ruin signifying the vanity of human existence, the inevitable transitory splendor of human life. Ruins are crumbles of our material world, abandoned fragments, hollowed out of the divine spirit that once animated them.\n\nImages give us hope, that particular hope of accessing the world without limits. Images create a special bond with death, as if the birth of the image could both suppress and sustain life. Or even be exchanged for a life. The human skull, this faceless death mask, this skeletal residue with its empty stare that once animated a human face, is an image, an emblem, an allegorical representation of a history, a montage out of which is read, like a picture puzzle, the nature of human existence, its spirit. Yet it is also the figure of its greatest natural decay, the transformation of the body into corpse, and then, into dust.\n\nBut what is really remarkable of the skull as image is the effect it has on recognition. It looks like a figure with something missing; it is at once a body and its ghostly double. It is a cadaver, just as the French theorist Maurice Blanchot notes: âHe is, I see this, perfectly like himself: he resembles himself. The cadaver is its own imageâ.\n\nBut all that isnât so odd after all. Body and image are to resemble each other the same way a shape resembles its mold, emptiness resembles what surrounds it, or an observation or a thought translates into a painting or a sculpture.\n\nLuis RoldÃ¡nâs ever mutable urge to rescue ruinous objects from their fate by imposing upon them new destinies is, in truth, the task of all artists: that of embodying oneâs observations. In the poem âEidolonâ, Walt Whitman suggests that the drive of human creativity is that of issuing eidola. In ancient Greek literature, an eidolon (plural: eidola) was an image, a double, a phantom, a ghostly apparition, a spirit-image of a living or dead person. For the Romans, the same type of spectrum was known as simulacra.\n\nThe gathered objects in RoldÃ¡nâs new piece, Eidola, used to be hat molds. They were the volumes that shaped hollow felts into hats. They stood in the place of the head, like soulless wood brains âas the one Pinocchio must have hadâ constantly searching for another fragment to attach itself to, in pursuit of completeness.\n\nEidola is a legion of sculptures searching for idols and a band of paintings searching for corporeality. In other words, itâs an arrangement of elements that emphasize what is left of them, or, rather, what is missing. The sculptures and paintings organized in the exhibition space are fragments that invite us to continue completing, enlarging, augmenting, researching the myriad hypotheses that might justify their existence. But mostly, their purpose is to provoke our imagination, to make us creators of stories and narratives by suggesting an interplay between observation and materialization, surface and volume, void and being, possessions and desires.\n\nSplit surfaces, pieces in halves and fragments, invoke a certain fear that appears when we stand in front of an open body. It might be the fear not only of having to acknowledge the fragility of life, its brevity, but also the fear of probing and questioning the indivisibility of the human body. In Eidola, surfaces stop being the intangible frontier between interior and exterior. RoldÃ¡n exposes the colorful fleshiness of the parts, and renders, as a visible residue, the delimitation among individuals. These objects are fragments, as we are also fragments, constantly searching for an other who, even if not exact, will complement us, shape us, and make us whole.\n\nAgain, it is not about the independence of parts, but how they come together. Striping down the surfaces, opening a gap, creating a tension between paintings and sculptures, doesnât come from a preoccupation with dissection that seeks to rescue some essence. On the contraryâand this is just an intuitionâRoldÃ¡n grants some sheen to these objects, covering their surfaces with brightness and color, creating new bonds and points of contact that will, in return, renew our gaze over mundane things.\n\nEidola is a res"
