        "text": "The way Kit Hammonds explains things, it takes 10 years to get a museum right, to figure out which artists to exhibit and how to lure large crowds through the doors, to hone a distinct curatorial vision and, just as important, to assemble a behind-the-scenes team that understands the challenges every institution faces.\n\nMuseo Jumex, where Mr. Hammonds is chief curator, has accomplished all of those things, though it has enjoyed some clear advantages getting through its first decade, notably the financial support of Eugenio López Alonso, whose family made a fortune with its Grupo Jumex juice business in Mexico, and who spends considerable sums of money in the name of visual arts. Mr. López founded the museum, built its gleaming home amid the designer retail shops and sleek residential towers in Mexico City’s Polanco neighborhood, and funds its continuing expenses.\n\nWith his backing, the museum has quickly evolved into a major player in the country’s visual arts scene, staging a long list of exhibitions by contemporary Mexican artists, along with blockbuster shows of work by global superstars, past and present, including Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol and James Turrell. Museo Jumex, in a building designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning British architect David Chipperfield, is a crowd-pleasing success.\n\nThe museum operates without a board of directors. The top curators report directly to Mr. López, whose title is president. The arrangement has been murky, at times, and one reason that high-profile staff turnovers are as much a part of the museum’s history as its popular exhibitions of work by Urs Fischer, Gonzalo Lebrija and Pedro Reyes. Mr. López has been framed by Mexican curators and journalists as a rich collector running a vanity project dressed up as a public entity.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
