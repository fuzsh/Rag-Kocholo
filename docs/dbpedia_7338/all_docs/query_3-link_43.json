        "text": "With the exception of a few soap operas and public affairs programs, no TV show has been on the air longer than NBC’s Saturday Night Live, which will embark on its 50th season Sept. 28. And as we approach the 76th Emmys, which will take place just a few weeks before that, it is the most celebrated show in the history of that event. Indeed, SNL holds the records for most Emmy nominations with 341 (Game of Thrones is second with 159) and wins with 89 (GoT is second with 59). And Lorne Michaels, its creator and overseer for all but five of its seasons, holds the record for most Emmy noms for an individual with 106 (Sheila Nevins is second with 77) and has racked up the second most…\n\nWhen Lisa Henson first saw Jim Henson Idea Man, the Ron Howard-directed documentary about her famous puppeteer father, she instantly considered it a success. “It was wonderful to see that Ron had landed it,” Lisa tells THR. “We had hoped that in the storytelling, Ron might be able to channel some of the creativity of Jim Henson and The Muppets, and he brought sketches to life with animation, used stop-motion from time to time, and presented the film in a creative style.” That approach earned the documentary eight Emmy nominations, including outstanding documentary and directing for Howard, as well as nods for cinematography, editing and writing. Was this documentary an immediate yes for you and your siblings? Yes. We had been approached for several years by various documentary filmmakers and companies. Each of…\n\nUntil this year, I worried about Just for Us’ timeliness. Just for Us, if you haven’t seen it, is a comedy show about a Jew — me — who attends a meeting of white nationalists in Queens. Eventually, they cotton on. The show has had a long and blessed life, having wound its way through the anglophone comedy world, finding a nice home on Broadway last summer before alighting on Max this April. However, in its 2018 infancy, I was only a few months removed from the gathering it was based on, and was trawling it through British and Australian comedy venues. Small theaters, pubs above a shoe store, anywhere that would have me. And coupled with the praise (faint!) was the word “timely.” Remember 2018? Those Thai kids had to be rescued…\n\nWhen nominations for the 2024 Emmys were announced, Richard Gadd was intentionally riding the tube in London. “I’ve learned in life, don’t put too much emotional weight behind [things], because if you really want something and it doesn’t go your way, it can be quite devastating, so I didn’t want to reserve a period of time where I would just be sitting, so I just went about my day,” says the creator and star of the streaming phenomenon Baby Reindeer. Gadd’s fear of tempting fate proved superfluous when the seven-part drama — which currently stands as Netflix’s 10th most watched English-language series with more than 85 million views since its release on April 11 — garnered 11 nods, including best limited or anthology series, and best writing and best actor for…\n\nNoah Hawley wasn’t entirely sure how the fifth season of Fargo would end — even as he began to write it. At that point in the series, Dot Lyon (Juno Temple) had persevered through several life-threatening ordeals and at last is at home with her family when Ole Munch (Sam Spruell) — a criminal for hire who’s also a centuries-old sin eater — shows up at her house to collect on a debt he believes she owes him. “When I sat down to write that final sequence, it wasn’t my plan that it would go the way that it went,” Hawley tells THR. “I assumed that Munch would show up at her house, and it would become one final, tense set piece. Then I thought, ‘Well, that’s his scene. What if…\n\nThe message of found community that undergirds Lessons in Chemistry parallels the experience the cast and crew had on the set of the Apple TV+ drama. “I cannot overstate what a beautiful collaboration this was,” says showrunner Lee Eisenberg of the series about a chemist turned cooking show host struggling with loss and the unpredictability of life. “If we had an hour, I would tick off about 100 names of people that I would not be talking to you if not for them.” Chief among them would be actors Brie Larson, Aja Naomi King and Lewis Pullman, who all scored Emmy nominations for their work on the adaptation of Bonnie Garmus’ novel of the same name, which is also up for outstanding limited series. Eisenberg chats with THR about how his most…"
