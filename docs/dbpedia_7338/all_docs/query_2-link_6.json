        "text": "Pausing over lunch, Patrick Charpenel, the new executive director of El Museo del Barrio, grabbed his cellphone. Eager to illustrate the contributions of Latinos to modern art, he pulled up images of charcoal drawings by Marius de Zayas, an art dealer from Mexico who organized the first Picasso show in New York City in 1911.\n\nSome of de Zayas’s own drawings are now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The director’s message was clear: A Mexican curator and artist had left a lasting mark on the New York art world.\n\nMr. Charpenel, also a native of Mexico, and the museum’s fourth leader within the past seven years, is determined to make his own mark while building El Barrio’s bridge to its future.\n\nHe began in October, at a critical time. Financial shortfalls over the last several years have forced staff cuts and reduced operating hours at the museum. A string of high-profile executive departures have created a sometimes acrimonious climate. The museum’s challenges include staying relevant during the seven months that its exhibition space, on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, is closed for renovations. And, as always, El Museo must find a way to balance its Puerto Rican activist roots with efforts to draw a wider audience.\n\n“It’s a museum that has a very direct connection with Puerto Rico,” Mr. Charpenel said. “But the art world doesn’t come often.”\n\nThe new director was friendly and enthusiastic during a recent lunch of Mexican and Latin specialties at El Museo’s Side Park Cafe, occasionally chatting in Spanish with waiters as he described ambitious plans to arrange exhibitions that reflect the varieties of the Latino experience. Ordering a sincronizada — a traditional tortilla-based sandwich — Mr. Charpenel said he would organize panel discussions and publish books to “open a bridge of knowledge” about the cultural contributions of Latinos and to explore subjects like immigration, exclusion and diversity.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
