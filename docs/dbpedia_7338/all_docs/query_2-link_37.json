Entitled Philippe Thomas: art history in search of characters... the exhibition curated by Liberty Adrien and Carina Bukuts features emblematic works, including the retrospective work L’Agence (1993) conceived by the artist at the invitation of the MAMCO, Geneva. Portikus' exhibition space, whose size is almost identical to the gallery for which Thomas originally presented the installation, is divided into two areas: the backstage and the showroom. While the first resembles a warehouse storage with ad campaigns, photographs and other objects and archives testifying to the agency's activity, the latter is a white cube, in which a selection of works is displayed to highlight different aspects of Thomas’s fiction. The lower gallery of Portikus is transformed into a study room in an effort to invite readers to do individual research on the artist.

From her key early sculpture Amerikaans Imperialisme and her video and photographic work from the 1970s, to her sculptures in the 1980s and 1990s, to her more recent paper-based works, the dominant aesthetic codes of the time find themselves recast as rhythm, ellipsis and ambivalence. As Dujourie has said, \"I want to indicate the duplicity (visible/invisible, present/absent) in its totality and make it experienceable.\" This search for what lies at the same time above and below the threshold of experience continues to drive her practice, as evidenced by Mimesis, the monumental bronze sculpture commissioned in 2022 by the City of Antwerp for the Royal Museum of Fine Arts. A solo exhibition by Dujourie will open at Jan Mot on September 7. Works by the artist will feature in Jan Mot's booths at Art Basel (Basel, June 15-18) and Paris+ by Art Basel (Paris, October 20-22).

In his curatorial statement, Chien-Hung Huang describes how \"in the freedom of game, \"children “come into contact” with the environment, skills in handling objects, and the mastery of interacting with their friends. Alÿs’ arrangement and camera lens in particular highlight the “role-playing” and “action decision” within a group, which is a sort of “politicalness” that comes naturally with the game. The “game” suspends all the limits of reality and allows them (and even us) to draw lines and cross them.\" The exhibition is part of the 2022 Kuandu Biennale Time of the Art Society: How to Become Indi-genous? and it will be on view until March 12, 2023.\n\nThe works Ghost Party 2 (2022) and Persona (2022) by Manon de Boer and Latifa Laâbissi will be screened on December 10 from 5 to 7:30 pm at Centre Pompidou in Paris (Petite salle, niveau -1).

An essay by the ethnographer and filmmaker David MacDougall embeds Alÿs’s observations of children’s play in the contexts of childhood studies as well as the history of ethnographic documentary film.\n\nJohanniterkirche Feldkirch presents a solo exhibition by Andrea Büttner in partnership with Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein. It opens today, July 22 and it will be on view until September 23, 2022. Büttner’s work Shepherds and Kings (2017) consists of a double slide projection of 160 historical images, showing how shepherds and kings have been depicted in Nativity scenes throughout art history. This comparative presentation of Büttner’s assembled collection of historical images follows no particular chronology or style, engaging instead in an iconographic exploration of gestures and their implicit resonances with qualities of shame, vulnerability and dignity. (Image: © Andrea Büttner, Shepherds and Kings, 2017)\n\nRemai Modern presents three works by Tino Sehgal that span the breadth of his practice: Yet untitled; This Situation (solo); and This Success/This Failure. Yet untitled is enacted by: Liz Kinoshita and Erik Nevin with local dancers: Peace Akintade, Promita Das, Kirk Ford, Aunya Jayde, Mitchell Larsen, Annika Lessing, Bryn Rawlyk, Dean Stockdale, Tatum Wildeman and Megan Zong. This Situation (solo) is coordinated by Julia Simpson and enacted by Laurel Beyer, Cody Brayshaw, Jaron Francis, Paxton Francis, Jordan Hansen, Danica Lorer, Mannie Mirzaei and Narges Porsandekhial. The artist has also curated a selection of sculpture from Remai Modern’s collection, on view in the museum’s atrium and Connect Gallery. The exhibition is on view until September 5, 2022 at Remai Modern, 102 Spadina Crescent East, Saskatoon SK S7K 0L3, Canada.\n\nFrancis Alÿs' work is part of When Faith Moves Mountains, a major group show presented on the occasion of the reopening of the PinchukArtCentre (Kyiv), 144 days after the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. The exhibition, whose title comes from the large scale project conducted by Alÿs in 2002, brings together works chosen from M HKA/the collection of the Flemish Community and focus on Ukraine as a country open to the world. (Image: Francis Alÿs)\n\nNew episodes of Asi sí, Mario Garcia Torres' podcast are now available on Spotify. Questions like 'what is this work of art about', 'can you explain it' are addressed by the artist about his own work while posing the same questions to other artists friends. For these two new episodes, he interviewed Urs Fischer who's currently presenting a solo exhibition at Museo Jumex in Mexico City.\n\nThe Future Should Always Be Better, Sharon Lockhart's work from 2021 is currently on view until July 31 on the façade of the Pałac Kultury i Nauki (PKiN) in Warsaw, as part of the \"Plac Defilad\" project curated by Paulina Olszewska. Created during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the work was a response to the situation of isolation and closure as well as the inability to participate in social and cultural life. The neon sign was hanging in Hanover on the facade of the Kestner Gesellschaft art institution. Thus, residents walking around the city could enjoy art while staying in the space available to them. Two years after the first presentation, the slogan by Sharon Lockhart takes on a new meaning, added by history itself. Presented in the public space, the work inspires reflection, both in the context of individual stories as well as collective social and political narratives.

The exhibition will present the series From Nothing to Something to Something Else (2018–2019) which features a group of young adults between the ages of sixteen and twenty. The artist does not give them any systematized scenario or instructions for producing the work but simply invites them to play music, dance and spend time together. All three films explore the time span between the already and the not yet, the time of potentiality. The three films are presented along with The Untroubled Mind (2016) in which de Boer observes and films her son’s playful constructions at home over a period of 3 years, setting the duration of each shot at 20 seconds, the length of time one can film with a Bolex 16mm camera when winding it manually.

Since October last year, 250 members have joined IGA from across 53 countries. In March IGA launched its newsletter, a weekly showcase of artists represented by its members. These temporary formations are randomly generated to create combinations of galleries and artists new, established, and rediscovered. Visit www.international-galleries-alliance.org for more information and to subscribe. Our contribution with works by Joachim Koester can be found in the archive section of the IGA’s website.\n\nThe documentary Christophe… définitivement (2022, 1h26) directed by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster and Ange Leccia was officially selected by the Festival de Cannes. The world premiere of the intimate and musical documentary about the French singer will take place on 25 May in Cannes, on the Macé beach, as part of the 2022 Cinema de la Plage lineup.

The presentation and catalogue, which title alludes to Joseph Beuys' famous statement ‘Jeder Mensch ist ein Künstler’ were created together with the Centre Pompidou. The show at West Den Haag varies widely in form, including new productions such as a culinary collaboration with Asad Raza, as well as Bismuth's readymades, photographs, flags, videos, food and even a modified car that once belonged to a famous Belgian art collector. Visitors can taste a new chocolate with a ‘decolonial’ flavor, specially manufactured for the Dutch public. Bismuth stimulates different senses and his work becomes fantasy reality. The coherence is in the way meaning and poetry can be produced from the most mundane activities. Without necessarily wanting to be innovative, and with a strong awareness of his numerous influences, Bismuth has built up a large body of work in which deconstruction of the norm is the way to influence reality and perception of it.\n\nOn March 1st the Cinematek in Brussels is organising a double premiere of works by Manon de Boer and Latifa Laâbissi in presence of the artists (at 7 and 9pm). In Ghost Party (2) (2022, 58'), De Boer and Laâbissi create little fictions with vases, stones and other materials, while giving voice to texts of 'ghosts' from their shared genealogies, like Marguerite Duras, Serge Daney, Casey and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro. In this polyphony of voices and accents their beings blend with others, subtly questioning the politics of language and identity (7pm). Persona (2022, 31') is a film based on Écran Somnambule, a performance by Latifa Laâbissi (2012) in turn based on the film “Mary Wigman tanzt” (1930), an excerpt of “La Danse de la sorcière” (1926). This second screening (9pm) will furthermore include two films by Chantal Akerman Portrait d’une paresseuse (1986, 8’) and J’ai faim, j’ai froid (1984, 13’).

The starting point of this sound installation is de Boer and Laâbissi's continuous dialogue about the numerous voices that inhabit their thinking and bodies. During a long process of exchange and ‘cannibalizing’, the performance Ghost Party (1) (2021) was created that further lead to the production of the film Ghost Party (2) (2022) as well as sound installation Blindsight (2022). While Ghost Party (1) & (2) are currently presented in their duo show at the Frac Bretagne in Rennes (FR) (until 15/05), the film will have its Belgian premiere at the Cinematek in Brussels on March 1st.\n\nNewspaper no. 130 is now online.\n\nAs part of Everybody is an artist but only the artists knows it, Pierre Bismuth's solo exhibition on view until February 28th at Centre Pompidou, the artist will give a talk at the museum on January 13th, at 7pm (in French, Petite Salle, free entry).

It brings together sculpture, film, and photography made across many decades and locations. Among others, Situación de cuatro placas de aluminio (Four Changeable Plaques) (1966), Limit of a Projection (1967), The Violent Tapes of 1975 (1975), and two films, The Desert People(1974), and The Invention of Dr. Morel (2000). Showcasing the ways in which Lamelas makes us aware of how the stories we tell ourselves are shaped by encounters with space and time, all of these works invite us to participate inscenarios in which container, contained, observer, and observed become blurred. On the occasion of the exhibition, a publication has been produced including essays and previously unpublished materials from the artist’s papers. The catalog is available for purchase via University of Chicago Press.\n\nFrancis Alÿs. As Long as I’m Walking (15/10-16/01) at the Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne (CH) presents an overview of the artist’s video work of the last thirty years, with an emphasis on one of the central themes in his practice, namely walking. Through his seemingly insignificant walks, Francis Alÿs not only reimagines the city, he also creates narratives, spreads rumors, maps the social fabric of the place through actions that are sometimes short sometimes carried out over long distances or many hours, by turns dragging, pushing or carrying an accessory that stands in for a clue to reading the fable spun by the body in motion. While Francis Alÿs figures as a protagonist in most of his early videos, he moves behind the camera in a series of works begun in 1999, the Children’s Games or in Reel-Unreel (2011), one of the core works to come out of his explorations in Afghanistan. They are featured in the Lausanne show along with paintings and works on paper. A catalogue is published on the occasion of the exhibition: Francis Alÿs. As Long as I’m Walking, Nicole Schweizer (ed.). With texts by Julia Bryan-Wilson, Luis Pérez-Oramas, and Judith Rodenbeck, and an introduction by Nicole Schweizer. Co-ed. Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts of Lausanne and JRP Editions, Geneva, 2021 (2 editions FR. and EN.).\n\nEverybody is an artist but only the artist knows it, Pierre Bismuth's first solo exhibition at Centre Pompidou, Paris, will open on October 20th and will be on view until February 28th. The title of the exhibition is a paradoxical reinterpretation of a famous statement by the German artist Joseph Beuys (“Everyone is an artist”). It brings together emblematic works alongside others made specially for the occasion. Two new works in particular mark this exhibition: the Saab automobile that once belonged to a great collector of conceptual art, in which the upholstery has been entirely redone and now features the names of the artists included in said collection. The second work, Pierre Bismuth - Chocolat au lait pour amateur de chocolat noir (2021) is based on the artist’s recipe and freely available for visitors to take. “The bachelor [meaning the artist himself] makes his own chocolate”, wrote Marcel Duchamp in the early 20th century. Pierre Bismuth, following in the footsteps of artist-cum-chocolate-makers such as Ed Ruscha and Dieter Roth, is perpetuating this blend of art and cocoa. An exhibition catalog will be published for the occasion, tracing the artist's vast œuvre and including an interview with Jean-Pierre Criqui as well as texts by Bernard Blistène, Marie-José Sondeijker, Dessislava Dimova, Dieter Roelstraete and Asad Raza.\n\nDans les oreilles de… Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, a podcast proposing an immersion in the musical universe of Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, is available now on Radio Nova (FR).\n\nFrom today, the soundtrack of the performatic conference We Shall Not Name This Feeling by Mario Garcia Torres and Sol Oosel is available on Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThe work was conceived for Mario Garcia Torres' exhibition Poetic of Return at MARCO, Monterrey (MX).\n\n@mariogarciatorres @soloosel\n\nTextiles and books from the collection of Seth Siegelaub / Egress Foundation will be included in the exhibition EURASIA − A Landscape of Mutability opening at the M HKA in Antwerp this week. The exhibition seeks to map innovative practices and exchanges that reflect the plurality of cultures, collaborations and conceptions of Eurasia (08/10/2021 - 23/01/2022).\n\nJan Mot's booth at Art Basel (CH) with works by Francis Alÿs, Pierre Bismuth, stanley brouwn, Andrea Büttner, Mario Garcia Torres, Joachim Koester, David Lamelas, readymades belong to everyone®, Vonna-Michell and Ian Wilson (photo: Studio Shapiro).\n\nThis coming weekend WIELS, Brussels organises the premiere of the performance Ghost Party by Manon de Boer and Latifa Laâbissi.\n\nIn 2016, artist/filmmaker Manon de Boer and choreographer/dancer Latifa Laâbissi entered into a continuous dialogue, addressing the multiple voices that inhabit their bodies and thinking. From the exchange, conversation itself emerged as a working tool and a performative form. By capturing and “cannibalising” each other’s influences, a genealogy of shared references appeared. Ghosted by the words of artists and writers such as Marguerite Duras, Anne Carson, Felix Gonzalez Torres and Casey, in Ghost Party, their new and first performance together, de Boer and Laâbissi play with language, accents and voices, meshing their very beings with others.\n\nThe performance will take place at the Wild Gallery (Rue du Charroi 11, 1190 Brussels) on Saturday 18/09 at 6pm and Sunday 19/09 at 4pm. FR with EN subtitles. Tickets via WIELS.\n\nDuring Brussels Gallery Weekend is the last chance to see the exhibition Ian Wilson, David Lamelas.

The artist imagines a Sensodrome for the Serpentine. Will it be speculative and visual fiction? What if an astrobleme became a Sensodrome in the middle of Hyde Park in 2022? Is a Sensodrome a place to stimulate our somatosensory system – a maison de rendez-vous? – a meeting point? Is it a mutant place contributing to the invention of new technologies of consciousness? What if aliens were in love with us? Would it change our relation to our planet and its lifeforms?\n\nOn July 27th, 5 pm EDT Mario García Torres along with the Director of Kunstinstituut Melly Sofía Hernández Chong Cuy, President of Fundación Jumex Arte Contemporáneo Eugenio López Alonso, Chief Curator of Museo Jumex Kit Hammonds and artist Melanie Smith will talk about contemporary art in Mexico over the past 20 years. The conversation that is part of Artforum at Sotheby's live virtual discussions, will start with a discussion of Normal Exceptions, a new exhibition presented at Museo Jumex and further explore questions of cultural identity and the Mexican diaspora, Mexico’s influence over artists’ practice, how Museo Jumex has helped foster emerging artists in Mexico, and the reception of Mexican art by the wider world, both past and present.\n\nFar, America opening on July 23rd at the Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea (CGAC) in Santiago de Compostela is the first retrospective of David Lamelas to be held in Spain after the show dedicated to his films organised by the Centro José Guerrero in Granada in 2009. The exhibition, curated by Pedro de Llano Neira, will present the development of his oeuvre, spanning various periods from his beginnings in Buenos Aires in the early sixties to date, focusing on two major issues: Lamelas's relationship with Galicia (his parents had emigrated from Manzaneda and Castro Caldelas during the Spanish Civil War) and the importance of design and drawing in his artistic practice over the course of his long career, both in the form of independent drawings, as in the Aleph series (1986-1989), and as a means of developing an idea in the fields of sculpture, photography, film and architecture.\n\n© Oliver Ottenschlaeger\n\nFor her exhibition VOLCANIC EXCURSION (A VISION) at Secession in Vienna, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster presents a monumental pictorial collage representing 235 life-size figures from past and present times. The artist describes this condensed environment as a \"fictional transfeminist and antiracist excursion\" gathering \"inspiring friends, non-binary, trans, queer, fluid, hybrid, lesbian, gay, pan, humans and non-humans\". The piece was inspired by the contrast she observed between the lock-down isolation and the many crowded protests, demonstrations and marches that took place recently in Paris. Through this 24 meters-wide and 5 meters-tall panoramic tableau, she refers, among others, to Gustave Klimt's iconography as well as Diego Rivera's mural Sueño de una tarde dominical en la Alameda Central (Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central, 1946–47). On view till September 5th, the installation performs as an engaging, optimistic stage for the visitor's active engagement.\n\nKW Berlin presents the work \"the relationship between your body length and the length and width of the floor, each wall, and the ceiling of this room = 1 : x, 1 : y, etc.\" by stanley brouwn.\n\nSimultaneously works by readymades belong to everyone® and Ilmari Kalkkinen are included in the group exhibition Zeros and Ones at KW which investigates the ways artists operate within their surrounding institutional structures and furthermorese includes Lutz Bacher, Jay Chung & Q Takeki Maeda, Hanne Darboven, Jana Euler, Jef Geys, Tishan Hsu, Silvia Kolbowski, Pope L., Louise Lawler, Carolyn Lazard, Lee Lozano, Henrik Olesen, Sarah Rapson, Margaret Raspé, Ketty La Rocca, Sturtevant, Otto Wagner, and Martin Wong.

The foundation aims to collapse the boundaries between art, culture, human rights and environmental issues. This Element by Sehgal was commissioned for the space, while Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster is presenting Endodrome, a virtual reality environment, shown at the Venice Biennale in 2019. The Library on Fire which is a new commission by Gonzalez-Foerster and Charles Arsène-Henry will be inaugurated in September.

Publication is a key work of Conceptual art representative of the introduction of oral and written language in the context of the visual arts, as well as of \"artist's books\" created at that time, which played a fundamental role in the so-called \"dematerialization\" of the artwork.\n\nThis re-edition happens exactly fifty years after its first print in London, and integrates a series of proposals from artists and critics such as Robert Barry, Daniel Buren, Ian Wilson and Lucy Lippard, together with the previously unpublished contribution by Marcel Broodthaers.\n\nCGAC organised a publication launch with David Lamelas, Mario Garcia Torres and Pedro de Llano which is available online.\n\nOn April 6th, 2021 the gallery will participate in a special online publication event by Antinomian Press dedicated to Ian Wilson: Ben Kinmont.

(white), 1967.\n\nSimultaneously with his show at the gallery, Joachim Koester's solo exhibition at Museum Dr Guislain opens on Saturday 20/03. The exhibition titled Altered States brings work together that investigate unknown territories, both geographical and mental. An ‘altered state of consciousness’ refers to a temporary change in the mental state. The cause is often external, such as a drug or a ritual, but also internal, such as a psychosis or simply a daydream. Koester shares his fascination with the effect of intoxicants with shamans and hippies, but also with psychiatrists. The latter recognised the therapeutic possibilities, but they were also confronted with the destructive power. Joachim Koester’s work delves into the historic context in which drugs were grown, traded and used, and draws parallels with the contemporary situation. Big and small stories impartially reveal our relationship with intoxication.\n\nNewspaper no. 126 is now online.\n\nCreated by the French artist Philippe Thomas, the communication agency called readymades belong to everyone®, for its American version inaugurated in 1987 in New York, and les ready-made appartiennent à tout le monde®, for its French version, is an entrepreneurial structure behind which the artist disappears. MAMCO owns all of this agency, which ceased to operate in 1995. The book The Agency (L'Agence) is the first systematic and exhaustive study of this enterprise which has radically questioned the figure of the author. The book also contains the last unpublished interview with Philippe Thomas, which provides an understanding of the profound coherence of his artistic project. Includes also texts by Paul Bernard and Emeline Jaret. Published by MAMCO in 2021 in both French and English version.\n\nMario García Torres’ survey exhibition entitled The Poetics of Returning which analyses the work that the artist has developed over the last two decades, opens tomorrow at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey (MX).\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition: Mario Garcia Torres, You Are An Essential Part Of Something Beautiful, n.d.\n\nIn early December 2020 the gallery launched a public campaign to save a major public work by David Lamelas, Quand le ciel bas et lourd (1992) situated in the park of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Due to a mistake in the planning of a new entrance for the museum that is currently under renovation, it had become unavoidable to move the work. Last summer the Flemish authorities regrettably withdrew their initial support to rebuild the piece on the same site and the existence of the work is now seriously threatened. Demolition of the piece is scheduled for March 22.\n\nA first letter by Lamelas from September 2020 sent to Jan Jambon, Flemish minister of Culture, asking him to revert his decision remained unanswered. Therefor the gallery decided to launch a campaign asking people to co-sign the artist’s letter. By the time the letter was resent to the minister (December 16) 840 artists, curators, museum directors, critics, gallerists and art lovers from Belgium and all over the world had signed it.\n\nPlease click here to read the letter to Jan Jambon, the list of co-signatories, the reaction from Bart De Baere, director of the M HKA who owns the piece, the reaction from the gallery and artist to De Baere’s response as well as a growing list of press articles and general information on the work.\n\nIf you wish to show your support we still invite you to sign and your name will be added to the list. We will continue to update our website with any new developments.\n\nWatch Practicing Sustainability, a conversation between Tino Sehgal, Marcela Sabino & Caitlin Southwick organised by Next Museum on Feb. 25th, 2021. Thinking about the museum of the future, sustainability certainly plays a big part. The awareness is present, but what can museums actually do to act sustainably? Should the quality of art be evaluated according to the criterion of environmental compatibility? What are the risks and chances of using emerging technologies in arts and culture with regard to climate change?\n\nFrans Masereel Centrum in Kasterlee (BE) will be launching a brand new edition by Tris Vonna-Michell entitled No more racing in circles – just pacing within lines of a rectangle, produced as part of the ongoing project Solitude during Printed Matter' Virtual Art Book Fair starting Feb. 24th. This audiotape box set is both a reflection on the impact of performing several narrations during a concentrated timespan and a selective representation and interpretation of the sound aspects in Tris Vonna-Michell’s artistic practice. The edition is conceived as a numbered box set with 4 audiotapes and liner notes by Jan Verwoert. Commissioned by Frans Masereel Centrum, in collaboration with Mount Analogue.\n\nOn this occasion besides the world premiere of the new edition, a new video work by Tris Vonna-Michell contextualising his participation in Solitude, as well as individual practice, will be launched on YouTube.\n\nToday, February 18th, 2021 at 5pm (CET) Rineke Dijkstra will receive the Johannes Vermeer Award 2020, the Dutch state prize for the arts. The ceremony will be live-streamed on youtube. According to the jury chaired by Andrée van Es, Rineke Dijkstra makes a major contribution to the international prestige of Dutch visual arts with her work. The jury calls her portrait photographs and video installations unique in the world. In its summary, the jury says the following: “This work is for eternity. Few artists have been given the talent to create these types of images.”\n\n(image: Rineke Dijkstra, Arden and Miran, London, February 16, 2020, 2020, inkjet print, 135 x 103,5 cm (image), 159 x 127 cm (frame), edition of 10)\n\nZürcher Kunstgesellschaft acquired Manon de Boer's work Presto, Perfect Sound (2006). The film depicts composer and violinist, George Van Dam, performing Béla Bartok's sonata for violin solo, Presto. Manon de Boer filmed George van Dam six times playing the whole piece while at the same time recording the sound. In order to achieve the ‘perfect’ soundtrack, she gave George van Dam the six sound recordings and asked him to reconstruct the Bartok piece into a perfect sound piece. Afterwards de Boer synchronized the filmed image to this soundtrack. The jump-cuts in the image visualize the cuts in the sound, while the sound sounds continuous. In allowing the audio sequence to dictate the image on screen, de Boer inverts the traditional dominance of image over sound in cinema. The film is a meditation on the relationship between sound and image and offers an intense reflection on a moment of creative concentration.\n\nThe film by Manon de Boer An Experiment in Leisure (2016 - 2019) is available for online viewing in the context of the inauguration of Artica Writings 2021, which is a curated series of texts aiming to influence critical thinking around our oceans and the urgent issues related to ocean health, knowledge and policy. In An Experiment in Leisure excerpts of texts by psychoanalyst Marion Milner (1900-1998) on themes such as concentration, the body, repetition and daydreaming are combined with meditative shots of artists' working spaces and Norwegian coast.\n\nNewspaper no. 125, January 2021 is now online.\n\nPrinted Matter, Inc. is organising a conversation on the book Seth Siegelaub Better Read Than Dead. Writings and Interviews 1964–2013 with co-editors Lauren van Haaften-Schick, Marja Bloem and Jo Melvin, along with artist James Hoff. This event will take place online on January 15th, at 5pm EST. Registration via the Printed Matter, Inc. website required.\n\nDavid Lamelas’ online performance Time 2020-2021 will take place on December 31st to coincide with the transition into the New Year in South-Korea. The performance is organised by Enna Bae and Sung woo Kim in the context of their exhibition Welcome Back currently on view in Seoul.\n\nYou can follow in real time the performance on youtube via this link:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge9h3Dy-GYw&feature=youtu.be\n\nIt will start at 11:45 pm KST (Seoul), 3:45 pm CET (Paris), 9:45 am EST (NYC).\n\nThe film Sandlines, the Story of History (2018-2020) by Francis Alÿs was awarded with the “Best Feature Documentary Award” by the Olympia International Film Festival for Children and Young People.\n\nVisit the festival's page to read more. See the trailer of the film on Francis Alÿs' website.\n\nOver 800 people co-signed David Lamelas' letter to the Flemish Minister of Culture Jan Jambon regarding the removal of the work Quand le ciel bas et lourd. The letter including the list of all co-signatories was resent to Jan Jambon today, asking him for a positive reconsideration of this dossier.\n\nClick here to learn more about this initiative as well as to read the open letter by the director of M HKA Bart De Baere published on December 11th in reaction to our appeal as well as our reply to it (both to be found after the list of the co-signatories).\n\nJan Mot announces participation in Galleries Curate: RHE\n\nIn the first days of the Covid-19 pandemic, an informal group of contemporary galleries from around the world came together to discuss how to navigate through the new challenges of the global crisis as it affected our artists, staff and businesses. As an expression of this unity we initiated GALLERIES CURATE.\n\nGALLERIES CURATE: RHE (RHE from Greek for that which flows) is the first chapter of this collaboration, an exhibition and website themed around a universal and, we hope, unifying subject: water. RHE’s first project will launch on January 4th, 2021, with an online presentation of works by Francis Alÿs, Giovanni Anselmo, and Latifa Echakhch, extending the exhibition A buoy if not a beacon. Continuing in stages through May 2021, additional projects will be added by participating galleries each month.\n\nFollowing the inaugural exhibition GALLERIES CURATE plan to invite new participants and add further curated chapters to a global conversation of thematic relationships between galleries, artists, and their audiences.\n\nThe exhibition Beethoven moves at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna for which Tino Sehgal created a new work entitled This joy reopened to the public on December 7th.\n\nMajor work by David Lamelas in Antwerp threatened with demolition, we ask you for your support.\n\nQuand le ciel bas et lourd (When the sky low and heavy) was realised for the exhibition America. Bride of the Sun: 500 Years Latin-America and the Low Countries at the KMSK (Royal Museum of Fine Arts) in Antwerp (1992). The work deals with the relation between nature and the industrial society as well as with colonisation and questions of oppression, struggle and censorship. Quand le ciel bas et lourd is an extremely rare example in Belgium of a public monument critically reflecting on the colonial past. It is also one of the most important works in David Lamelas' oeuvre.\n\nDue to the ongoing renovation of the KMSK involving a new access to the museum, plans had been developed to move it slightly to the corner of the park surrounding the museum. Unfortunately the Flemish government withdrew its initial proposal that was accepted by the artist and now no longer wants to rebuild the work. A letter by Lamelas asking Jan Jambon, Flemish minister of Culture, to reconsider his decision has remained unanswered. We are therefor launching a public campaign inviting everyone to co-sign the original letter with the artist in the hope the work can be saved from destruction. Please click here.\n\nJan Mot is delighted to announce the representation of Andrea Büttner.\n\nAndrea Büttner (°1972 in Stuttgart, lives and works in Berlin) connects art history with social or ethical issues, exploring broad-ranging topics such as poverty, labour, community, Catholicism, music, botany, and philosophy. Her work is based on thorough research into specific areas or situations, and she often appropriates or references other artists and thinkers including HAP Grieshaber, Corita Kent, Immanuel Kant, Gwen John, Andy Warhol, Dieter Roth and Simone Weil. Her diverse practice is articulated through formats encompassing print, sculpture, weaving, but also photography, video, instruction pieces, and works with live moss and wet clay.\n\nBüttner was first celebrated for her bold use of what is often seen as unfashionable media, namely woodcut and glass painting. Ideas of shame, vulnerability, poverty and embarrassment run throughout her work, countering the romantic and heroic nature associated with much artistic practice. Martin Herbert writes “Büttner’s art can be read as a form of empathy – an exemplary outstretched hand, not from above but from across.” (Artforum March 2015).\n\nBüttner studied at the Royal College of Art in London, Humboldt University of Berlin, and Berlin University of the Arts. She was a nominee of the 2017 Turner Prize and is a winner of the 2009 Max Mara Art Prize for Women. Exhibitions include documenta 13 (2012), Sao Paulo Biennial (2010 and 2018) and solo exhibitions at Museum Ludwig Cologne (2014), Walker Art Center (2014), Kunst Halle Sankt Gallen (2017), Kunsthalle Wien (2016) and Hammer Museum Los Angeles (2017).\n\nPhoto: July Zimmermann\n\nOn December 2nd at 8pm Andrea Büttner and Mason Leaver-Yap (KW Berlin) will have an online conversation on Büttner's newly published book Shame (Koening Books, 2020).\n\nFrom shaming and shamefulness to shame-avoidance and shamelessness, the experience of shame influences our social behaviours, decision-making abilities, and desires. Shame determines what we show and what we hide. And yet, as an emotion that begs for its own concealment, what is the structure and appearance of shame? How does shame interact with the realm of the visible, and where does it surface in visual culture?\n\nRegistration required via reservation@kw-berlin.de.\n\nIn celebration of the new book Seth Siegelaub. Better Read than Dead: Writings and Interviews 1964–2013, the Kunstverein in Amsterdam transforms part of its space into Seth’s Books Bookshop and for the coming month will be selling books exclusively by International General (the imprint of Seth Siegelaub) and about Seth Siegelaub.\n\nTris Vonna-Michell participates in Solitude, an initiative of the Frans Masereel Centrum that commissions six new artistic projects, based on an alternative politics of experiencing art. Deliberately offline, each individual project offers an inspiring context to rethink the connection between art, the bodily and the social, and our mental faculties. Learning from the first half of 2020, and acknowledging our insatiable intellectual hunger, six artists are invited to develop a new work, which people can acquire physically and experience at home – as opposite to from home. In doing so, Solitude strengthens existing artistic practices that ask themselves where to for art, while providing at the same time multiple opportunities to cope with the enduring (self)confinement, without flattening out art. What space is left if seclusion – whether or not chosen by ourselves – is the only option? Other participating artists are Andrea Éva Győri, Taus Makhacheva, Amy Sillman, Nora Turato and Patrick Van Caeckenbergh.\n\nThe gallery became member of the Gallery Climate Coalition (GCC). The GCC is a non-profit organisation founded by a voluntary group of London-based gallerists and professionals working in the arts as an attempt to develop a meaningful and industry-specific response to the growing climate crisis and to facilitate a greener and more sustainable commercial art world. The aim is to provide guidelines and the necessary resources so that we can collectively reduce our carbon footprint by 50% over the next ten years (in line with the Paris agreement), as well as promoting near zero-waste practices.\n\nThe book Joachim Koester. Bringing Something Back (2019) was awarded the Årets vakreste Bøker / The Year’s Most Beautiful Books of 2020 by Grafill, the Norwegian Organisation For Visual Communication.\n\nThe book which was produced on the occasion of Joachim Koester's solo exhibitions at the Camden Arts Center and Bergen Kunsthall centres on a series of “meditation tapes”. The “tapes” explored the various twilight zones between waking and sleeping, and what can be brought back from such semi-darkened mental states in an exhibition context.\n\nA visual essay, compiled by art historian, writer and curator Yann Chateigné, runs through the book and combines Koester’s own works with a selection of archival pictures that visually extends the discourse of the “tapes”, texts and artworks. Furthermore it features an interview with an interview between Yann Chateigné and Joachim Koester.\n\nAuthors: Yann Chateigné, Joachim Koester, Jelena Martinovic, David Toop\n\nEditors: Mai Lahn-Johannessen, Steinar Sekkingstad\n\nDesign: Petri Henriksson / Blank Blank\n\nPublisher: Walther Koenig\n\nSoftback, 166 pages, illustrated in colour and b&w, 200mm x 125mm\n\nSandlines, the story of history directed by Francis Alÿs has been selected for the International Competition of the 7th Porto/Post/Doc: Film & Media Festival, that will take place from November 20th to 29th, 2020.\n\nWe are pleased to welcome you on our new gallery website, which is designed by Marc Hollenstein and programmed by web3000.net.\n\nDavid Lamelas' site specific installation Corner Piece (1966) will be presented as part of the show Collection 1940s–1970s at MoMA New York starting on October 24th. The work will be on view for approximately three years. (Image: Corner Piece at Jan Mot, 2006)\n\nSaturday, October 3, 2020, from 7pm to 2am, Nuit Blanche is organised by the city of Paris, a contemporary creation in all its forms in public spaces, prestigious monuments and buildings that are little known or inaccessible in normal times. On this occasion, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster will take over the peristyle of the Palais Galliera with a sound installation entitled Promenade. The installation invades the peristyle of the Palais Galliera and offers the spectator a very special immersion, in a sound jungle, under a tropical rain. This ephemeral work is part of the Nuit Blanche's Right Bank journey that weaves its way from the Petit Palais - Musée des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris to the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris, crossing the sound limbo, virtual wasps and temples of love in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées or New France, to the Palais Galliera and the esplanade and basin of the Palais de Tokyo.\n\nThe newly published book Seth Siegelaub. Better Read than Dead. Writings and Interviews 1964-2013 gathers selected writings, interviews, extended bibliography and chronology filling the historical gaps in the sprawling network of exhibitions, publications, projects, and collections that constitute Seth Siegelaub’s life’s work. Siegelaub chose the title Better Read than Dead for an anthology of his own writings — one of the projects for which he never found the time. The book was edited by Marja Bloem, Lauren van Haaften-Schick, Sara Martinetti and Jo Melvin and published by Koenig Books, London and Stichting Egress Foundation Amsterdam.\n\nPierre Bismuth's work Coming Soon is published on the website of the David Roberts Art Foundation (Click here)\n\nComing Soon is a fast-paced compilation of the closing seconds of film trailers. It is a familiar final visual in trailers when the alluding, though vague, words ‘coming soon’ are blasted across cinema screens. Bismuth’s compilation is made up of motion pictures by many of the large American film studios and production companies, discernable by the logos that accompany the phrase. Where it is possible to decipher what film is being referred to they are all major motion pictures released around 2002-03, including Johnny English, the original Jackass: The Movie, and the only ‘coming soon’ that is accompanied by moving image; Secretary with Maggie Gyllenhaal.\n\nGhosted by the words of artists and writers such as Marguerite Duras, Anne Carson and Casey, in Ghost Party, their new and first performance together, Manon de Boer and Latifa Laâbissi play with language, accents and voices, meshing their selves with others. The performance is part of the exhibition Risquons-Tout and will premiere at Wiels at the Open School Risquons-Tout (Avenue Van Volxemlaan 316, 1190 Forest/Vorst) on 30th and 31st of October at 6.30 and 8.30pm. This performance was postponed due to the new restrictions. New dates are to be confirmed.\n\nMultiple works by David Lamelas selected by Adam Szymczyk are included in the program of the 22nd edition of experimental film and video festival Videoex 2020 in Zürich.

It is a chronicle of the way in which people develop strategies of survival in and after a situation of conflict.”\n\nFrancis Alÿs, Beirut, March 2009"
