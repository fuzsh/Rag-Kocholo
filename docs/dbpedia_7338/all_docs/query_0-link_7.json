        "text": "Mexican company of beverages\n\nThis article is about the company and the juice brand. For other uses, see Jumex (disambiguation).\n\nGrupo Jumex, S.A. de C.V. (pronounced \"HOO-MEX\"), which is short for Jugos de México (Juices of Mexico), is a brand of juice and nectar from Mexico. The Jumex brand is also popular among Hispanic consumers in the United States. Currently, the Jumex Group (which manufactures Jumex) offers lines of fresh and preserved fruit juices, nectar, children's drinks, milk, smoothies, energy drinks, and sports drinks in Mexico.\n\nIts headquarters are in Ecatepec de Morelos, State of Mexico, in the Mexico City area.[1][2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe origins of Jumex lie with Empacadora de Frutas y Jugos, S.A. (Fruit and Juice Packing Industry, Inc.) and its Frugo brand, which was founded on April 27, 1961. Grupo Jumex began with the vision of Don Eugenio López Rodea, who managed to bottle the first apple nectar in a can of 350-milliliter on June 6, 1961. With the support of his family and community, Jumex was born with only 20 workers and now it has over 4000 workers. The first flavors were apricot, apple, guava, mango, pear, plum and tamarind; today several additional flavors and blends are offered under its brands. The actual Jumex brand and its \"little blue can\" was introduced in 1964. The current company associated with Jumex and other popular beverage brands is the Jumex Group, which consists of Frugosa, Botemex, Jugomex, Alijumex, Vilore Services Corp., Vilore Services, and Vilore Foods, Inc. (U.S.)[3] Jumex is associated with the Mexican foods company La Costeña.\n\nIn 2013, Jumex acquired Kern's.[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCompanies portal\n\nColección Jumex\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
