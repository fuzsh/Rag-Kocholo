        "text": "The new century has witnessed a transformation in the museum field. Museum attendance has increased exponentially since the 1990s, and plans for new museums have emerged as well as renovation and expansion projects, particularly for those institutions specializing in art. Notably, there has been a proliferation of private museums around the world. Private museums can be seen as a distinctive institutional model, confronting head on the issue of art museums as stakeholders in the art market and legitimizing new actors in the art world. This chapter analyzes how the private Museo Jumex in Mexico City, and the Colección Jumex before it, changed the infrastructure and behavior of the contemporary art scene at both the national and international level. Jumex became a legitimizing body that creates value for Mexico from Mexico and projects this value globally. Jumex’s commercial nature also played a role in Mexico’s current position within the international art world. This chapter explores how, under the leadership of the Mexican tycoon and collector Eugenio López and his advisers, this institution fostered the local art scene. An examination of the collection’s establishment, its interaction with the art world, its international visibility, and its constant negotiation with symbolic and economic spheres reveals the distinctive features that have gained Jumex its stature in the local and global scene.\n\nThis essay examines three museums of contemporary art in Lima, Peru: MAC (Museum of Contemporary Art), MALI (Lima Art Museum), and MASM (San Marcos Art Museum). As framed through curatorial studies and cultural politics, we argue that the curatorial practices of these institutions are embedded with tensions linked to the negotiation of regional, national, and international identities, coloniality, and alternate modernities between Western paradigms of contemporary art and contemporary vernacular art in Peru. Peruvian national institutions have not engaged in the collection of contemporary art, leaving these practices to private entities such as the MAC, MALI, and MASM. However, these three institutions have not, until recently, actively collected contemporary vernacular Peruvian art and its by-products, thus inscribing this work as “non-Western” through curatorial practices and creating competing conceptions of the contemporary. The curatorial practices of the MAC, MALI, and MASM reflect the complex and contested musealities and conceptions of the contemporary that co-exist in Lima. This essay will address this environment and the emergence of alternative forms of museality, curatorial practices, and indigenous artist’s strategies that continually construct and disrupt different modernities and create spaces for questioning constructs of contemporary art and Peruvian cultural identities.\n\nThis book brings together recent, multidisciplinary, cutting edge research on the globalization of markets for contemporary art. Focusing on different regions including China, Russia, India, and Japan, the chapters in this book study the extent to which art markets have indeed become global. On the one hand, it focuses on organizations such as the art fairs, Internet platforms, and auction houses which have enabled global flows of contemporary art. It shows how art from places such as the Middle East has been transformed into a new asset class. On the other hand, the chapters highlight the multiple barriers which globalization has encountered in art markets. Although markets for contemporary art have indeed emerged across the globe, cross-border flows of works of art have remained comparatively insignificant. The reasons behind these barriers are explored. They include differences in taste across the globe, trade barriers in countries like India and Brazil, and vested interests of actors in local art worlds like Japan. This book recognizes the coexistence of various ecologies of contemporary art exchange and sketches the presence of resilient local networks of actors and organizations within art markets. Some chapters moreover argue that Europe and the United States continue to dominate the global market, especially when considering rankings of success and participation in the most prestigious commercial events such as Art Basel.\n\nVarious historical and sociological studies focusing on the relationship between gender and art show that women’s participation in the Western art market, although it has incre‑ ased, continues to represent a minority. However, the Brazilian case proves to be something of an exception, in that women artists occupy positions of prestige in local and international rankings. This article examines the specificities of the Brazilian art system, which have enabled certain female artists to gain national and international recognition, an extraordinary feat when contrasted with other international contexts"
