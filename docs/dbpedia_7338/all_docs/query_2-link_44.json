At 1:14 p.m., just over two hours after a loud siren had signaled a citywide drill to commemorate the 1985 event, the same terrifying hum was heard again. “Was this a glitch?” many of us wondered, with our characteristic distrust of state infrastructures and government planning. The piercing noise of shattering windows brought with it the harrowing realization that a tragedy was happening before our eyes, in real time, on the same day that so many of us already remembered with so much sorrow. In the hours of chaos and confusion that followed, those living in the affected areas—which extended beyond Mexico City into the states of Puebla, Morelos, Oaxaca, and Chiapas—experienced a flux of overwhelming and conflicted feelings, from disbelief to paralysis, from fear to courage and solidarity. As telephone lines reached capacity and children left their schools in tears, thousands of us rushed to our homes amid a sea of cars to find out whether our relatives were alive and our homes still standing. I vividly recall my walk in the midday sun, turning left and right in search of 1\n\nthose contours of the city that had vanished. The air carried a strange type of dust, possibly emanating from the rubble. It threw everything out of focus. The sound of ambulances became equally pervasive and seemed to travel in all directions. The sky was populated with helicopters, and the city seemed at once frenetic and close to a standstill. Both fake and real images of the disaster soon began circulating on every available screen at a speed almost synchronized to the pace of the damage, an acceleration ill-suited to the muddled sense of temporality that many of us were feeling. The uncanny return of the memories of 1985 and the almost terrifying symmetry between two September 19s unleashed a puzzling feeling of historical repetition in a country arduously struggling to leave behind a sticky past, a past heavily reliant on the century-old symbols and heroic narratives of the 1910 Mexican Revolution and the seventy-year-long authoritarian regime that had followed.1 As night fell, my mother, sister, and I, having earlier celebrated finding one another alive, headed to one of the affected sites in Colonia del Valle to offer help. We didn’t have a specific address but knew that several buildings had suffered severe damage in the area, some had collapsed, and the number of victims remained unknown. Upon arriving at the first site, we quickly understood that fellow volunteers had little information and that communication was difficult and confusing. The only message we could grasp was that the site was overcrowded and no more help was needed; indeed, the presence of so many people visibly obstructed the movements of rescue teams, ambulances, and rubble trucks. We headed instead to a nearby shelter set up by volunteers in a private school. Here my sister, a medic, was called forward, and I was asked to sort medicines and food. The place was overflowing with first-aid kits, fresh and packed food, clean water, blankets, and people willing to offer help. The zeal and commitment of all those present were exhilarating, but there was also a general sense of chaos. Contrary to what we might have imagined in an era that is often characterized as one of increasing apathy and individualism, the collective response to the tragedy exceeded the capacity of the damaged sites to receive aid. Only hours after the initial shock, thousands of people unwilling to leave the rescue efforts in the hands of the government found ways to reorganize the entire dynamics of the city and of social networks around what seemed like a single set of shared values: the defense of victims’ lives and the possibility of assuaging their losses. Those of us who worked in shelters witnessed an outpouring of aid donated by individuals and families, rich and poor. At the damaged sites, those who worked on the direct removal of the rubble recall that they found themselves shoulder to shoulder with persons from all classes and ethnicities. 2 Introduction\n\nTogether, as Luis Villoro writes in his poem “El puño en alto” (“The Raised Fist”), we began to create a new language for collective action, one in which the raised fist, usually a symbol of protest and resistance, became a call for collective silence,2 for only silence would allow the cries of the victims to be heard. Human chains, human belts, human hugs thus became the cogs of a new kind of social machinery in which emergency led the way to solidarity. The tragedy necessitated that we act as embodied beings capable of giving flesh to a larger body, one able to offer care and create the conditions for shelter. In the days that followed the earthquake, fatigue kicked in, yet many kept their fists firmly aloft so as to continue listening to those left most vulnerable, insisting that the salvage efforts should not cease before all those who could be rescued had been. The newly formed networks of exchange, communication, and participation held fast, yielding a sense of common cause. Many of us began to feel that the seemingly old or dated notion of “the public,” much battered, on the one hand, by authoritarian uses of the term and, on the other, by the fiercely privatizing logics of the neoliberal market, could, once again, be resurrected and reimagined. Yet those days of pervasive uncertainty also raised innumerable questions about what we may consider to be “public” and made visible the many challenges that come with every act of “commoning.”3 During the catastrophe and its aftermath, the idea of the public was continually embodied and disembodied, performed and undone in rapid bursts of emotion, followed by bafflement, confusion, and disagreement, then by excitement and optimism once again. How long would this sense of collective care last, and what would its limits be? Would the new public equally serve the haves and the have-nots, those living in Mexico City and those living in the poorer, bordering states? Which victims would be rescued and comforted first, and why? Whose stories would become more visible? The passing of days saw much of the donated food going to waste, medical supplies being piled up and stored (rather than distributed), and goods being taken from affected homes by unaccountable officials and petty criminals. The altruistic and caring public that had formed soon learned the bitter lesson that goodwill would not suffice to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble or provide shelter to those left homeless. News arrived that more-isolated communities had received scarcely any aid, while richer neighborhoods were overflowing with clear water and other basic goods they did not need.4 The stories of the latter were being overrepresented in the media, while those of the former remained uncommunicated and largely out of sight. This series of questions and paradoxes revolving around the notion of “the public,” together with its temporalities, dynamics, and imaginaries, motivate The New Public Art. The book takes art as a sphere in which new meanings Agoraphilia 3\n\nof the public are not just symbolically represented but also lived, enacted, and brought to life. Some of the sites most visibly affected by both the 1985 and the 2017 earthquakes had historically been considered ”public spaces” while also being closely associated with the nationalist iconography of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) regime. The PRI was born in the aftermath of the ten-year revolutionary struggle that set the constitutional foundations of political and civil life in Mexico during the twentieth century. Having ruled the entire country during most of that period, through a clientelist system whereby citizens’ votes were effectively exchanged for political favors, the party was ousted from the presidency in 2000, only to return, partially transformed, in 2012–2018. The infrastructural damage Mexico City suffered in 1985 may thus be seen as an allegory for the impending demise of the PRI-led postrevolutionary project and the accompanying ideas of public space, public art, and public participation it had shaped. The fifteen-story Nuevo León building in the landmark social housing unit of Nonoalco Tlatelolco, designed by the modernist architect Mario Pani, cataclysmically collapsed, as well as two major towers in the General Hospital, including the gynecological section, with more than a hundred newborn babies inside, only seven of whom survived. A census of the city’s extensive network of public murals, many of which dated back to the immediate aftermath of the revolution, found that out of 550 murals, 95 had “damages of some type,” ranging from small cracks to total destruction.5 If the iconic murals by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco housed at the grandiose Bellas Artes Palace seemed intact after the earthquake, a number of murals in public hospitals and social housing units suffered a different fate. Carlos Mérida’s Leyendas mexicanas (Mexican legends: 1950–1952), a series of architectural plates built into the stairways of Mario Pani’s Benito Juárez social housing unit in the Roma neighborhood, survived only as the décor of a building facing imminent demolition.6 After chiseling the plates from the walls was deemed too dangerous and the proposal to “leave the stairways standing as monuments”—to surely become the ciphers of an increasingly void social revolutionary discourse—was abandoned, Mérida’s mural cycle was left to suffer the effects of dynamite and was never reconstructed elsewhere. Though there was little choice to proceed otherwise to salvage the pieces, their eventual destruction was partly the consequence of years of neglecting Mérida’s public artworks, arguably as a result of his estrangement from official ideas of nationalism.7 Furthermore, state commissions for such monumental works had become rare, and as Robin Adèle Greeley suggests, the old murals had gradually been drained of their sociopolitical meaning and transformed 4 Introduction\n\ninto “patrimony,” while the priista discourse of the revolution had itself lost substance.8 If, as Greeley adds, Mexican muralism had become not just a conveyor of official ideology but a central player in the country’s public sphere—stirring up agitated debates on the desired relationship between the Mexican state and an ethnically and culturally diverse political body—by the 1970s onward muralism’s “message of popular consciousness [had] effectively [been] neutralized.” Foreseeing some of the developments we discuss in this book (to which she is also a contributor), Greeley continues: “The [public art] adventure of the 1920s and 1930s had ended: it would be left to others outside the institutional reach of the state to express a popular national consciousness.”9 The 2017 earthquake inflicted similar damage on the symbolic tissue of the urban commons, although on a lesser scale. Moreover, this tremor impacted a society used to perceiving the representations of the 1910 revolution and previous eras as ghosted relics, the meaning of which has been worn away by a culture of image capitalism prone to rapid discard. During the less than two minutes that the earthquake lasted, the cross that had stood for over two hundred years atop the San Juan Bautista church in Coyoacán fell off the main tower, with passers-by (including my father) running to collect its fragments.10 The imposing Monumento a la Madre (Monument to the Mother), designed in 1949 by the sculptor Luis Ortiz Monasterio and the architect José Villagrán García, which heavily featured the symbolism of mestizaje (miscegenation), was completely ravaged, leaving in its place an empty pedestal surrounded by debris.11 The large-scale architectural complex of the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Obras Públicas (Ministry of Communication and Public Works, or SCOP), conceived by Carlos Lazo in the early 1950s as a modernist example of integration of painting, sculpture, and architecture, deserves mention too.12 In this case, the buildings were so heavily damaged that they remain vacant to this day, yet the murals—by Juan O’Gorman, José Chávez Morado, Luis García Robledo, Guillermo Monroy, and Arturo Estrada—that lined their walls were impressively preserved. It seems that Juan O’Gorman’s innovative stone mosaic mural technique enabled such resilience and, in so doing, saved the complex from total collapse.13 This was a case, in other words, of public art ”heroically” holding up the country’s debilitated infrastructures. How long this precarious salvation will last remains unclear. At the time of writing this introduction, both the murals and the buildings are still standing, but the government has decided to transfer the murals to a new location, purportedly to preserve them.14 The iconic complex of modernist buildings to which the murals belonged is unlikely to survive, a situation that ultimately symbolizes the uncertainty that historic public artworks and public spaces face today. Many of the country’s major Agoraphilia 5\n\ntwentieth-century public projects were spearheaded precisely from the SCOP’s headquarters. Its imminent disappearance thus raises the question of whether the 2017 earthquake delivered a coup de grâce to the symbolic armature sustaining the notions of “the people” and “the public” in postrevolutionary Mexico, turning its old landmarks into cracked, transposed, and simulacral relics. This question underpins the pertinence and urgency of this book. In The New Public Art, scholars and artists, writing as individuals, pairs, and collectives, explore practices and narratives organized around a desire for art to have a tangible public impact. In each of the case studies that follow, however, visions of artistic processes and approaches to community and participation are markedly different from those that characterize historical understandings of public art in Mexico. Through a combination of scholarly chapters and a series of dossiers (or statements) written by artists and artists’ collectives, the premise of this book is that a new, non-state-led understanding of “the public” came into being in Mexico during the temporal arc roughly traced by these two major earthquakes, from the mid-1980s to the late 2010s. Carlos Monsiváis identified the 1985 earthquake as the moment in which “civil society” first emerged in Mexico as an organizing idea for civil opposition to the PRI regime. After the earthquake, and in response to the many government failures during the tragedy, Monsiváis writes that “hundreds of thousands of people drew a new relationship with the government,” moving away from the melancholic expectation of a solution into the search for these solutions.15 This collective transformation in the relationship between the citizenry and the state entailed reclaiming an idea of the “public good” that was different from official versions. Moreover, it gave rise to spatial, symbolic, discursive, and embodied forms of participation able to create and sustain this “good.” The public response to the 2017 earthquake and its aftermath was as much a reenactment of citizens’ involvement in the rescue efforts thirty years prior as it was an attempt to overcome past failings, giving new corporealities and new names to collective problems and common ideals, and generating spaces for public participation aimed not so much toward consensus as toward nonviolent disagreement, debate, and caring dissent. The New Public Art roughly spans the period from what Monsiváis calls the birth of this “civil society” in 1985 to the emergence of a dense amalgam of grassroots projects contributing to the reconstruction efforts in 2017. The latter proliferated in the midst of a large-scale security crisis unleashed by former president Felipe Calderón’s so-called war on drugs (2006–2012), the dire (necropolitical) consequences of which feature heavily in the following chapters. The 2017 earthquake also arrived in the aftermath of more than three decades of 6 Introduction\n\n“structural reforms” and neoliberal transformations of the economy and society that heavily defunded social services and left entire areas of the country exposed to the exploitative dynamics of corporate extractivism and what Sayak Valencia calls “gore capitalism.”16 As the chapters that constitute The New Public Art suggest, during this arduous thirty-year period, a fundamental reconfiguration of the meanings of “the public” and practices of “commoning” has taken place in Mexico, yet past desires and imaginaries associated with such ideals have often also reemerged. The eerie occurrence of both earthquakes on September 19 and the mass public involvement that ensued on both occasions serve here to allegorize the cyclical constitution, disappearance, and reappearance of publics and counterpublics.17 These phenomena also remind us of the significance that historical memory plays in such processes. In his seminal book Publics and Counterpublics, Michael Warner describes publics as “queer creatures.” He adds, “You cannot point to them, count them, or look them in the eye.”18 Publics are elusive because they entail a connection among strangers, creating shared spheres of belonging beyond kin or nation. “They are a kind of fiction that has taken on life, and a very potent life at that,” writes Warner.19 Rather than existing as stable, measurable entities, they are constantly appearing and disappearing, mutating, expanding, falling into oblivion, returning from the past. They have a circular relationship with the discourses and practices that shape them: while publics are shaped by discourse, discourses also attend and respond to the concerns and desires of their imagined publics.20 The New Public Art takes its cue from Warner’s queering of the notion of “the public” to account for the recent history of public art and public spaces in Mexico. Exploring practices that often interweave private and collective experiences, as well as artworks and discourses emerging in peripheral and interstitial spaces, the authors’ collective intention is to move beyond the standardized and limited understanding of “public art” as state-sponsored art and “public spaces” as spaces accessible to everyone. In a context characterized by escalating levels of violence, mass-scale femicide, homicide, and disappearance, The New Public Art bears witness to the proliferation of antimonuments, grassroots memorials, dissident murals, ephemeral street dances, independent archives and libraries, and feminist and queer installations that embody and perform rapidly changing ideas of the public, publics, public art, public space, counterpublics, necropublics, commons, and undercommons. These heterogeneous practices attest to a complex remodeling of the relationship between art and that which is common, collective, public, and assembled. As we seek to show, these practices embrace relationality and community building as ethical horizons, expressed through site-specific attempts to weave closer connections Agoraphilia 7\n\nbetween art and place. Moreover, artists’ collectives involved in human rights work have blurred distinctions between art and activism, working with communities and victims of state violence to create nonofficial spaces of remembrance and memorialization. And though “new public art” has established critical dialogues with previous understandings of public art in the country, its approach to the heroic and nationalist narratives of the Mexican Revolution has aimed at debunking such myths. The dismantling of the so-called public sector in Mexico dates back to at least the early 1980s, when a ferocious neoliberal economic model was introduced by the enfeebled PRI regime. This left the country’s precarious democratic structures vulnerable to the greedy interventions of a corporate and extractivist private sector. The neoliberal undoing of the postrevolutionary state was accompanied by the rapid privatization of public spaces, now transformed into shopping malls or lucrative and hard-to-access housing complexes.21 What Wendy Brown describes as “neoliberal reason” has encroached as a new political moral, reconfiguring most “aspects of existence in economic terms” and quietly undoing “vocabularies, principles of justice, political cultures, habits of citizenship, practices of rule, and above all, democratic imaginaries.”22 One of the “old” democratic imaginaries under attack is that of the public itself, as the large-scale privatization of public goods has made us all too aware of the potential perils of public enterprises and the exclusionary dynamics of public spaces. A collective feeling of agoraphobia driven by financial interest, accompanied by pervasive insecurity and violence, has arguably emerged as Mexico’s “new normal” since the country’s structurally disadvantaged entry into the global markets. How has public art changed, and what has it come to signify under these conditions? How have new dissensual spaces been shaped? How have artist collectives responded to human rights violations, state-imposed public memorials, and the proliferation of drug-related violence in outdoor spaces? In what ways have artists and activists reimagined spheres of collective creation and shared struggle? What Is Public Art? Any attempt at newly defining “public art” in the early twenty-first century would at best be naïve. The history of this notion is long, momentous, and complex. Yet the task is also indispensable for apprehending art’s current imprint on the social and vice versa. If all art is made for a public, the concept of “public art” entails a surplus or an excess in this fundamental relationship. One of this book’s claims is that understanding this excess requires shifting our attention from the presence or absence of public funding to a foregrounding, instead, of 8 Introduction\n\nthe role of artistic practices in everyday forms of social organization, often on the margins of the state. In other words, public art may fall below or outside established political projects or institutions and encompass practices seeking not only to critique a certain regime of aesthetic or political representation but also to articulate new ways of inhabiting spaces, relating to and affecting others, and perceiving or creating spheres of belonging. The term “public art” has all too frequently been used without sufficient critical investigation. Lucy Lippard argues that “not all the varied . . . forms that have come to be called ‘public art’ deserve the name.”23 The usual association of public art with state commissions places narrow emphasis on matters of funding and ownership, thus failing to say anything about the art itself and the individuals or communities involved in its making. The history of state involvement in the arts to promote political agendas has similarly reduced public art in the eyes of a number of scholars to being a sheer bearer of state ideology, the opposite of what participatory and dissensual practices could yield.24 Though the authors in this volume carefully consider the significance of the state’s current and past involvement in the making of art and in defining its meaning and purpose, we problematize any top-down approach to the politics and aesthetics of public art in Mexico over the last three to four decades. In other words, the authors of The New Public Art aim to acknowledge critically the history of the state’s use of the arts to further authoritarian agendas while recuperating Lippard’s resistance to relinquishing the notion of “public art.” This renunciation would not just be a missed opportunity, as she says; it would in itself limit the possibility of public art mattering. In her investigations on the temporality of public art, Patricia C. Phillips argues that “the notion of public may . . . be the most quixotic idea encountered in contemporary culture.” “The public is invented—and re-created by each generation,” she writes, for it is profoundly entwined with the material conditions of social life and the technologies that enable the communication of ideas.25 The mutability of this category necessarily demands a definition of public art that prevents fixity or permanence—such as, for instance, its being tied to the outdoors or to some civil space. As Phillips demonstrates, public art is imbued with the cyclical temporality of the meaning of the public. Its definition must therefore account for that cyclicity by absorbing the quest for the meaning of the public as its fundamental singularity. To put it another way, for Phillips, public art “is public because it is a manifestation of art activities and strategies that take the idea of public as the genesis and subject of analysis. It is public because of the kinds of questions it chooses to ask or address and not because of its accessibility or volume of viewers.”26 This understanding of public art renders Agoraphilia 9\n\nit potentially multiple, generative, and prone to experimentation. Moreover, it situates public art as a fertile ground for political and philosophical reflection, as the chapters of this volume also go on to show. The philosophical relevance of public art has arguably been insufficiently studied not just in Latin America but also in the United States and Europe. While “much has been said about the failures or successes of public art,” Phillips writes, little has been written about “the philosophical questions a [work of] public art may raise.”27 Foremost among these, as she suggests, is the issue of temporality. What are the temporal conditions within which collective meanings emerge and vanish? What processes constitute a collective body or a collective experience and how do they unfold in time? What practices assist democratic creativity over space and time? What trajectories of change do public artworks follow? If public artworks act as performative bodies, producing meaning, subjectivity, and action over time, can artists avoid the perils of obsolescence by privileging historically and geographically situated (ephemeral) interventions? Seeking to address these questions, the authors in The New Public Art stray from a normative approach to defining what is or should be public. Instead, they seek answers in existing practices, analyzing a highly diverse recent history of public art in Mexico that remains underinvestigated and undertheorized. Additionally, they pay homage to and continue the feminist embrace of the notion of public art since the 1980s and celebrate what the art historian Arlene Raven described in 1989 as an “explosion of new forms,” from “street art” to “guerrilla theatre, video, page art, billboards, protest actions and demonstrations, oral histories, dances, environments, posters, murals, paintings and sculpture.”28 As Raven puts it, since the late 1980s, largely thanks to a number of feminist interventions, “public art isn’t a hero on a horse anymore.”29 The proliferation of forms that was already apparent in the 1980s has accelerated even more in recent years, as understandings of agency have expanded not just from a patriarchal to a feminist vision or from the individual artist to collective action, but from a human-centered approach to the recognition and embrace of an ecological realm in which materials, objects, technologies, and living beings coproduce action. The trajectory of change, as this book attests, has been anything but smooth or linear, having been subject to heated polemic, contestation, conflict, and reversal. Almost every transformation has arguably witnessed the anachronistic return of symbols and gestures from a past that refuses to depart unchanged.30 Working along a similar path toward inclusivity and feminist commitment, in the mid-1990s Lippard broadly defined public art as “work of any kind that cares about, challenges, involves, and consults the audience for or with whom\n\n10 Introduction\n\nit is made, respecting community and environment.”31 For her, public art is not (or not necessarily) to be looked at. It looks out. Lippard’s list of “outlooking art” encompasses everything from conventional works for indoor exhibitions “that refer to local communities, history or environmental issues” to site-­specific artworks that significantly engage with communities in their “execution, background information, or ongoing function.”32 Some of the arguably most original or unexpected examples that she mentions in her extensive list include “public-access radio, television, or print media, such as audio- and videotapes, postcards, comics, guides, manuals, artists’ books, and posters,” together with performative actions that travel or appear simultaneously in different locations, “to highlight or link current issues.”33 Like Raven’s, Lippard’s understanding of public art stands out for considering a variety of unconventional media, most notably artists’ books, mail art, performance, and synchronic pieces, which she calls “chain actions.” These are all practices in which women artists have been pioneers and protagonists, and Lippard’s own relationship with them grew out of her involvement in the construction of a feminist art history. As she points out, the concerns of public and participatory art are closely tied to the concerns of feminist art, and women have embraced the category of “public art” more frequently in their writings. Significantly, she adds, both public and feminist art are moved by a desire for art to be useful, though not—or not always—utilitarian.34 An Agoraphilic Vision Though this is not a book about feminism or feminist art, its conceptual points of departure are the writings by Raven and Lippard in the 1980s and 1990s and a series of contributions emerging from feminist debates on public art, in particular Rosalyn Deutsche’s seminal essay titled “Agoraphobia,” which I discuss below. Along the lines of Nancy Fraser’s “Rethinking the Public Sphere,” these thinkers’ shared conviction is that adopting a feminist understanding of public art and public space is particularly telling in the sense that it makes visible the contested and exclusionary character of the notion of the public.35 As they stress, public space has historically been understood in negative terms as falling outside the “private realm” and thus being fundamentally separate from the “feminine” space of the home.36 Even as these divisions have been questioned and redrawn, the official rhetoric of publicity continues to create “significant exclusions.”37 Fraser adds that the boundaries between the private and the public are not naturally given: “what will count as a matter of common concern [is] decided . . . through discursive contestation,” and she argues that\n\nAgoraphilia 11\n\nthis process is often initiated by subaltern publics.38 The New Public Art takes Fraser’s idea of (subaltern) contestation beyond the realm of discourse into a plurality of fields of experience, visuality, affect, and perception. A telling entry point into the discussion of how gender has permeated ideas of the public is the history of agoraphobia, understood as a pathological fear of open or public spaces. A medical category that continues to be in use, the agoraphobic condition was first described by the Austrian psychiatrist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal in 1871, after coming across three male patients who, on approaching “certain large, open public squares ( freie Plätze) in Berlin,” would experience dizziness, trembling, heart palpitations, and an acute fear of dying.39 Westphal’s neologism is based on the Greek notion of the agora, which describes open public spaces, especially marketplaces, where people gathered and assembled. Westphal’s diagnosis was rapidly popularized in Europe, where, during the turn of the nineteenth century, doctors identified a number of primarily male patients with similar symptoms and attributed the disease to “a problem of the liver (Cherchevsky) or the ear (M. Lannois and C. Tournier) . . . insufficient will (Paul Emil Lévy) . . . excessive sex and alcohol (Henry Sutherland) or coffee (Legrand du Salle),” among other causes, like fatigue (Emil Cordes) and childbearing (C. W. Suckling).40 The early detection of agoraphobia among men did not prevent the disease from being considered “fundamentally ‘female’ in character,” described as a “housewife’s disease” by doctors.41 Freud’s writings represent a poignant example of this gender bias. In a series of letters to the German Jewish otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess, written between 1896 and 1899, the founder of psychoanalysis developed a theory of phobias, or “anxiety symptoms,” which includes a description of agoraphobia in women as dependent on a “romance of prostitution” and “the repression of the intention to take the first man one meets in the street” (December 17, 1896). This association of agoraphobia with repressed erotic desire also gained popularity in circulating cultural understandings of this form of fear, and it was used insidiously to stigmatize women. Joanna Bourke points out that a popular textbook in mid-twentieth-century Britain “maintained that agoraphobia was a response to the desire to be raped. The agoraphobic was afraid to go outside, believing that she would faint and fall. But that was exactly the position that the agoraphobic unconsciously desired, being attracted to the idea of sexual molestation.”42 Contemporary clinical descriptions of agoraphobia avoid gendered listings of symptoms, yet the condition continues to be most commonly diagnosed among women, and this tendency is on the rise. In 1987, Robyn Vines argued that “about two-thirds or more of agoraphobics seen by psychiatrists and other health professionals are women,”43 and the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical 12 Introduction\n\nManual of Mental Disorders states that “females are twice as likely as males to experience [it].”44 The agoraphobic condition, which could also be described as the fear of the marketplace, reflects in this sense the extent to which women and minority groups have had to (and continue to) struggle to feel safe in public spaces. The staggering rates of femicide in Mexico and indeed throughout Latin America form part of the insufficiently accounted-for forms of violence that have spread a deathly fear in those spaces theoretically accessible to everyone.45 A seeming paradox at the heart of agoraphobia is that it not only involves the fear of finding oneself in crowded spaces but also encompasses the fear of being alone in the street, in parking lots, in marketplaces, on bridges, or anywhere outside the home. In other words, agoraphobia is the fear of being surrounded by too many disconnected people—a crowd, a mob—or facing the city in solitude. In this latter sense, it can be seen as fear of alienation rather than a fear of community. Kathryn Milun describes this duality as immanent to the “structure of feeling of the urban commons,”46 which never just captures an individual condition but reflects a broader fear that circulates in societies. Agoraphobia, in particular, is symptomatic of the ways in which societies facilitate or repress public debate and conceive of inclusivity, participation, safety, and care. Milun tellingly signals that “agoraphobia appeared . . . during a period of massive migrations from countryside to city, together with the construction of monumental architectural forms that accompanied both metropolitan growth and the rise of the modern nation-state. Nineteenth-century agoraphobics experienced the gigantic squares and boulevards introduced into their cities as hostile environments. They perceived these monumental spaces as ‘empty,’ and suffered intense anxiety that caused them to retreat to the curb, to their homes, and even to their beds.”47 While emptiness and monumentalism continue to trigger fear of public spaces, these are not the exclusive and possibly most prevalent sources of agoraphobic feelings in the present. The neoliberal undoing of the demos (to use Wendy Brown’s phrasing48), the crumbling of the welfare state, and, in certain cases like Mexico’s, the state’s infiltration by organized crime, alongside pervasive surveillance, biopolitical control, and violence, have jointly triggered new, equally hostile waves of agoraphobia in the past decades, pushing many, once again, to retire to their homes and to their beds—with suicide rates and anxiety rocketing throughout the country.49 In discussions about public art, however, the notion of agoraphobia has taken on a more complex and nuanced meaning, shaped by, among others, the writings of the art historian Rosalyn Deutsche. Her book Evictions revisits this concept to analyze the removal of Richard Serra’s Tilted Arc from New York City’s Federal Plaza in 1989. She describes what left-wing critics saw as Agoraphilia 13\n\na neoconservative campaign to remove the sculpture from the plaza based on a purported defense of the plaza’s “public use” and the need of an imagined “public” to enjoy free access and free circulation within it. During the debate, Deutsche argues, the meaning of the public was assumed to be self-evident, whereas, in reality, the use of the term was imbued with (implied) value judgments. She writes that the public “was presumed to be a group of aggregated individuals unified by their adherence to fundamental, objective values or by their possession of essential needs and interests or, what amounts to the same thing, divided by equally essential conflicts.”50 That understanding of the public as a coherent unity capable of reaching so-called democratic consensus through rational critical discussion dates back to Jürgen Habermas’s The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962). In this influential and polemical book, Habermas construes an “ideal type of the bourgeois public sphere,” understood as a sphere between society and the state where citizens discuss matters of common concern to hold the state accountable.51 Yet according to Deutsche, who recuperates the critiques of a number of radical and feminist thinkers, including Fraser, Chantal Mouffe, and Claude Lefort, Habermas’s model primarily generates exclusions—of women, nonwhite subjects, the “non-educated,” the non-liberal-minded, the more-than-human, and so on— and may thus be paradoxically described as agoraphobic, or fearful of a diverse and agonistic public. In this light, agoraphobics become those aiming for “consensus, coherence, and universality” in the public realm, rather than pluralism, heterogeneity, hybridity, and difference.52 Correspondingly, they react with panic to the “openness and indeterminacy of the democratic public.”53 Building on Deutsche’s work, a central claim of this volume is that for a democratic public to emerge, it must also create the conditions that enable the critique of its own nature, its conditions of possibility, and its modes of inclusion and exclusion. Any homogeneous or coherent understanding of “the public” necessarily involves disavowing social difference and social conflict. A radically democratic discussion of the meaning of “the public” involves, by contrast, understanding public space as “the social space where, in the absence of an essential, historical or metaphysical foundation, the very meaning of the social and the terms of its confluence are negotiated, constituted and put at risk.”54 “What is recognized in public space,” writes Deutsche, “is the legitimacy of debate about what is legitimate.”55 How we imagine, represent, or perform these senses of legitimacy and publicity, and how we name and recognize the agents that might contribute to this debate, has enormous consequences for the livability of life in common. The authors of The New Public Art argue that this is a problem that concerns artists not only as individual creators but also 14 Introduction\n\nas common or collective subjects, and as makers of actant objects capable of participating in and shaping material assemblages.56 In so doing, contributors place new understandings of the significance of public art in dialogue with novel forms of decolonial, affect-driven, materialist, and necropolitical critique, while paying particular attention to the roles that not only representations but also materials, environments, networks, processes, and technologies might play in cocreating inclusive forms of collective action and belonging. A Site-Specific Approach This book contributes to theoretical reflection on public art, yet the authors refuse the universalizing vision that has problematically characterized Western art history. Like art, theory can and should remain aware of site specificities. One of the labors of decolonial theory is to critique and renegotiate the relationships between concrete histories and the conceptual possibilities generated by abstraction—through which experiences travel and migrate.57 As readers navigate this book’s case studies and artists’ dossiers, they must be mindful of the singular histories of public art and public space in Mexico. This history is deeply entangled with international political and economic developments but has also been specifically affected by public art’s centrality in the construction of the nation-state in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution. Claudio Lomnitz suggests that the ideology of the revolution was often pragmatic and contradictory; however, the country’s “cultural revolution had radical foundational elements, exemplified by its rabid secularism, its educational programs, and its peculiar brand of modern art for the people.”58 Lomnitz adds that the cultural programs of the revolutionary state were often conceived of as a “second conquest,” in which “Mexican imagery” would harness communitarianism, solidarity, and collective expression, while the spirit of the Indians would “animate the collective project.”59 The muralist movement is the most striking visual expression of this “second conquest,” and both the ideological principles that mobilized it and the relationship between art and the state that it initiated permeated public art in Mexico well beyond the movement’s so-called golden age in the 1920s and 1930s. Attending to this legacy, this book explores the ways in which the postrevolutionary understanding of public art (what Lomnitz terms “the modern art for the people”) began to change with the crisis of the PRI regime, the weakening of the welfare state, Mexico’s turn to neoliberalism, and the country’s wavering transition to democracy. In other words, how do contemporary artists’ and activists’ visions of community and participation differ from those sponsored by the regime that conditioned and shaped Mexican modernity? Agoraphilia 15\n\nBefore I move into a discussion of how The New Public Art addresses these questions, it is important to stress that the postrevolutionary search for communitarianism through public art was closely bound up with a disabling authoritarianism. While the state generously promoted public works and motivated the lay Mexican to visit and enjoy the country’s innumerable monumental public plazas and museums, it also allowed the normalization of social privilege within those spaces and used them as spectacles of allegiance to the regime.60 Moreover, access to state funds for public art was often controlled by informal, illegal, and corrupt networks and bureaucracies, and these funds became a privileged means of co-opting artists and intellectuals.61 By intimidating and repressing independent and dissident projects, as well as promoting unclear rules for free expression and participation, the postrevolutionary state created a ripe environment for the spread of agoraphobic sentiments. Coming to terms with this specific fear and its exclusionary consequences— particularly during moments in which an agoraphilic position would become a matter of life and death, as in the case of the 1968 movement or the 1985 earthquake—is precisely what led to Mexico’s arduous democratic transition, namely, the transition from a one-party rule maintained in power through fraudulent elections, to the slow and all-too-imperfect strengthening of the country’s electoral institutions, leading to the turnover of power across parties and coalitions. The transition was largely led by those who refused to belong to the PRI’s monolithic and monumental idea of “the people,” including progressive students; Catholic organizations marginalized by the staunch secularism of the revolutionary ideology;62 dissident intellectuals who resisted the PRI’s complex machinery of co-optation; and political leaders who split with the PRI and mobilized sectors of the population that had suffered from the contradictions, inconsistencies, and deficiencies of the priista model.63 The close entwinement of the party with the Mexican state meant that the transition to democracy also entailed a gradual and uneven restructuring of the state itself, a process that unfolded in parallel with—and was largely triggered by—a change in economic model from a protectionist to a neoliberal economy. The shining promises of economic and political inclusivity that purportedly would accompany the opening up of the Mexican economy have, however, failed to materialize, as the current unspeakable levels of violence attest. With staggering numbers of missing and murdered people since the onset of the war on drugs in 2006, rocketing levels of femicide, and continual attacks on journalists and activists, the risks of participating in public discussion or occupying public spaces in today’s Mexico are high.64 Those risks span different forms of public visibility and participation: from walking the streets at night 16 Introduction\n\nas a woman to the practice of investigative journalism or the defense of endangered environments. Violence has permeated all aspects of public life and has left its physical traces in public spaces.65 It is in this context that public art has gained unprecedented relevance as a form of participation in the contemporary agora—perhaps more appropriately named in Mexico the tianguis (open-air market)—which Cornelius Castoriadis defines as a public-private space where citizens meet with one another not to make political decisions in the name of the state or to represent one another, but to articulate spaces of community and dissent while practicing politics on a nongovernmental scale.66 The interest of Castoriadis’s definition lies in his treatment of the agora as a space that not only suspends the division between the public and the private but also recognizes a nonexclusively discursive realm of collective interest and action, beyond the limited spheres of the state and the government. Decisively shifting away from their common conception as state-sanctioned art, current expressions of public or “agoraphilic art” are significantly more complex and diverse in terms of the processes of art making involved and the strategies used to knit together common ideals and demands. Resistance against official and propagandistic uses of art has become process- rather than message-driven, thus inscribing public art in the slow temporality of lived experience and direct engagement rather than in an easily appropriated symbolic economy. Furthermore, new understandings of what constitutes authorship have produced a shift away from the established model of the “exceptional” nationalist intellectual—in Carlos Monsiváis’s words—to different models of collective creation and belonging.67 Additionally, in the face of the country’s current human rights crisis, activist and human rights groups have become increasingly involved both in the critique of certain public monuments and in the creation of “grassroots memorials,” in which collective participation defies monumentality, and memory becomes a live process—marked by rituals of mourning and the persistent search for justice. The New Public Art recuperates a history of unflinching artistic dissidence through collective action and explores the theoretical possibilities emerging from situated aesthetic acts produced by agoraphilic bodies. Combining the individual and collective voices of artists and scholars, it critically reexamines the crucial notions of “public art” and “public space” in view of the emergence and proliferation of often collective artistic practices for which, as Phillips suggests, the idea of the public and its mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion have become “the genesis and subject of analysis”—in many cases to give rise to new dynamics of dissent and participation. Moreover, this book and the series of questions it addresses are haunted by a history of significant state Agoraphilia 17\n\nintervention in the arts in Mexico. Authors therefore identify the temporality of public art and its currency as marked not just by linear transformations but also by circularity and return. In the face of new waves of agoraphobia—aggravated by privatization, insecurity, and pandemic fears—The New Public Art refuses to relinquish a claim to the commons nonetheless. Overview of Chapters and Dossiers Titled “New Muralisms,” the book’s opening section explores the relationships between past and present in contemporary public art, focusing on the critique of the muralist tradition in the 1970s and 1980s by artists nevertheless deeply interested in the public and indeed political dimensions of their art. In “New Muralisms after Muralism,” Natalia de la Rosa and Julio García Murillo revisit the notion of “new muralism,” a term coined during the 1970s that they describe as offering critical possibilities for interrogating the meaning of public art during the last decades of the twentieth century. They look, in particular, at a series of historiographic, curatorial, and institutional projects that confronted the instrumentalization of the Mexican muralist tradition to bolster a nationalist ideology, both during the postrevolutionary years and during Mexico’s turn to neoliberalism in the 1990s. Rather than abandoning muralism tout court, these projects recuperated muralist propositions that had been central during the early years of this movement’s development. De la Rosa and García Murillo argue that in artworks by the likes of Felipe Ehrenberg and Melquiades Herrera, and in the theoretical and critical work of Alberto Híjar, Ida Rodríguez Prampolini, and Juan Acha, muralism reemerges as an art in dialogue with experimentation, pedagogy, and conceptualism. Moreover, muralism returned as a renovated and participatory practice, capable of engaging with new and dissident “realisms,” thereby renewing its critical potentiality by leaving behind its aesthetic hegemony and architectural monumentality. This chapter is followed by an artistic dossier put together by Grupo Germen, an artists’ collective originally from Guadalajara, in which they discuss a different practice and understanding of “new muralism.” This involves using graffiti as a means of embellishing disadvantaged neighborhoods on the peripheries of major cities and as a way of strengthening community ties weakened by violence and insecurity. Adopting yet another approach to the critical reemergence of muralism in Mexico, in “Public, Political, and Aesthetic Spaces in Ayotzinapa” Ana Torres discusses a series of murals painted in the aftermath of the painful events of September 26 and 27, 2014, in Iguala, Guerrero, when forty-three students attending the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers’ College were forcibly abducted, then disappeared, having first been allegedly taken into custody by local police officers 18 Introduction\n\nwith ties to organized crime. During the abduction, three people in the vicinity and three student-teachers were killed; the body of one of the latter, Julio César Mondragón, was later found with his eyes gouged out and the skin of his face flayed, a devastating image probably intended to send shockwaves across the country and spread paralyzing fear.68 Torres’s analysis of these murals expands previous scholarship on the historical recurrence and reenactment of ideas of the public by considering the collectively painted murals, located on the walls of Ayotzinapa’s Rural Teachers’ College and in a nearby city, named Tixtla, as expressions of what Paolo Virno describes as a “non-state-run public sphere.” This sphere articulates a form of “publicness” fundamentally distinct from the state’s.69 As collective expressions of both past and present symbols of protest, as well as ritual manifestations of a common will to mourn the disappeared students and the social project of the rural schools, which various governments have tried to dismantle since the 1970s, the murals, Torres says, “teach us to witness violence from unconventional loci of enunciation.” Although the murals respond to a recent event, Torres sees them as “dialectical images” in which flashes from the horrors of history illuminate the present. Moreover, Torres pits the critical, decolonizing gaze that the murals articulate through collective action and collective memory against a hegemonic public sphere dominated by mass media. Agonism thus emerges as the fundamental dynamic of public spheres—a theme we continue to develop in subsequent chapters. This section closes with a dossier on Campamento Audiovisual Itinerante (CAI), a community cinema organization that draws on Indigenous practices of collective decision-making to produce cinema “for and with the community.” Luna Marán, a filmmaker and one of the main organizers of CAI, argues that this experience of community cinema expresses possibilities for cinematic creation distinct from “auteur cinema.” Stemming from rural and Indigenous practices, CAI’s understanding of “collective creation for a common good” is closely linked to the grassroots vision of the rural teacher-training colleges. Titled “Feminist Publics,” the book’s second section addresses a range of feminist artists’ incursions in an affective and counterforensic private-public realm as a means to contest past and present forms of gendered and racialized violence against both the living and the dead. Karen Cordero Reiman’s “Politics of Enunciation and Affect in an Age of Corporeal Violence” analyzes the work of the artist Mónica Mayer, examining two participatory pieces that solicit a politics of solidarity in response to everyday gender violence, while also exploring affective forms of restitution, encounter, and corporeal healing. Cordero describes Mayer as one of the “most consistent referents in Mexican feminist art since the 1970s” and relates her current work to her initial involvement with Agoraphilia 19\n\nfeminism and feminist art in that decade—a time when the feminist movement burst into visibility in public spaces. Mayer conceives of her art as a “social practice” and thereby positions herself within a feminist genealogy that includes Judy Chicago, Arlene Raven, and Suzanne Lacy, among others. Her work intersects the private and the public to foreground the politics of their boundaries. Most important, she crafts a mobile, inclusive, and participatory sense of the collective, leaving behind more stable, passive, and arguably oppressive ideas of “the public” or “the people.” In revisiting the relationship between previous understandings of public art in Mexico and Mayer’s practice, Cordero suggests that “in contrast to the homogeneous, monumental conception of the political body that had characterized muralism and related artistic movements,” women artists in Mexico from the 1960s on “explored the differentiated experiences of bodies and the polysemic and fragmentary nature of corporeal experience in contemporary culture.”70 This interest in the significance of embodied gestures in the production of public spheres of belonging and critique is also present in the “conversational essay” by Colectivo A.M., an artists’ collective dedicated to choreographic production, reflection, and practice. In their essay, the eleven dancers jointly explore the possibilities dance offers for constituting collective and political subjectivities beyond the ephemeral temporality of spectacle. They recall their piece La pista de baile (The Dance Floor, 2015), which involved inviting people to dance for hours in the streets of Los Angeles in the United States and in both Cuernavaca and Mexico City in Mexico. In the process, they interrogate whether there was indeed a public dimension to this experience of dancing in open-air spaces. As they put it, “strictly speaking, [public space is] a space that belongs to no one in particular. But it’s not free either, and not everyone has the same freedom or possibility to move through it. It’s regulated, and its use can be criminalized. It falls within the sphere of the state: it isn’t a field in the middle of nowhere where you can go and do whatever you want. Yet [these] spaces can occasionally offer alternatives to the state.”71 As their choreographic practice shows, such alternatives can be truly transformational and embodied, even if often ephemeral. The next chapter, by Erin L. McCutcheon, addresses the work of another early feminist performance artist, Guadalupe García-Vásquez, who is a contemporary of Mayer but much less known. García-Vásquez seeks to expand the reach of the public beyond what she describes as linear conceptions of space and time, imbuing it with a sense of ritual that she recognizes as inherited from her Indigenous and Afro-mestizo ancestors. She evokes a “necropublic” that McCutcheon theorizes in dialogue with Achille Mbembe’s concept of 20 Introduction\n\n“necro­politics,” on the one hand, and, on the other, with activist practices giving agency to the dead, often victims of femicide, to confront today’s and past injustices. Having only acknowledged her Afro-Mexican ancestry in adulthood, García-Vásquez has developed performative rituals that make perceptible the violence inherent in the historical invisibility of black bodies in the Mexican national imaginary and the ways in which racial categories imposed in colonial times continue to organize forms of exclusion in the present. In this process, she blurs the boundaries between the personal and the public, past and present, the living and the dead, and performance and ritual. If publics and counterpublics are indeed to become forms of “poetic world making,” and spheres that allow some kind of personal and societal healing in the aftermath of violence and trauma, McCutcheon suggests they must encompass necropolitical forms of resistance that refuse to leave the dead behind.72 Expanding the discussions on embodiment and performativity, the next dossier addresses Teatro Ojo’s 2018 experimental stage performance Deus ex machina, in which the Mexico City–based theater collective used “open dramaturgy” to set up a call center in El Galeón theater. From this unusual stage, using a technology that has increasingly been co-opted for the purposes of sales and extortions, Teatro Ojo rang people across Mexico to “materialize voices from the farthest-flung parts of the country” and untangle the “historic knots” that tie them together. They did this before an audience—also embedded in this imagined community—that could attend the sessions for as long as they wished to and could also wander onto the stage. In their conversations, callers asked questions, read news stories, recounted dreams, and evoked the country’s “often anachronistic national imagery.”73 As Laura Furlan from Teatro Ojo recounts, this performance triggered a reflection on the kind of political community that the disembodied voices on the calls constitute and the fears, emotions, and memories that haunt them. The necropolitical discussion continues in the chapter by Carlos Fonseca and Enea Zaramella, where they analyze a series of sound pieces and installations by Teresa Margolles. A former member of the SEMEFO art collective (an acronym standing for Mexico City’s Servicio Médico Forense, or Forensic Medical Service), Margolles has spent the last three decades reflecting on what happens when traces of violence are displaced away from the bureaucratic archival machinery of the state and into the public exhibition space. Whether she is at work filling a gallery with dense fog composed of vaporized water previously used to wash corpses, or transporting, re-creating, and displaying the floor tiles upon which her friend Luis Miguel Suro was murdered, her work is guided by an attempt to exhibit those leftovers of violence that are Agoraphilia 21\n\noften concealed from the public gaze. Fonseca and Zaramella’s text focuses on the forensic and counterforensic dimension of Margolles’s work, which they analyze through the prism of Eyal Weizman’s writings.74 Moving away from the subjective voice of the witness, the forensic approach aims to find truth in the remnants of all that’s left. It explores the stories these remnants can tell us and how they wrestle the truth away from that proposed by the state (hence its counterforensic potential). For years, Margolles has been interested in the wave of violence that has rocked the north of Mexico and, in particular, border towns like Ciudad Juárez. Forensics, to her, offers a solution from within a world where few witnesses survive, and those who do are often terrified into silence. For Fonseca and Zaramella, turning the gallery into a public forum not only focuses attention on the stories forensic remnants have to tell but also interpellates the spectator to rethink central categories such as witnessing, evidence, and truth. A dossier by Diego Flores Magón follows, expanding these reflections on the counterforensic archive. Flores Magón outlines his own involvement in the creation of La Casa de El Hijo del Ahuizote, an archive, a printing press, and a museum that opened its doors in 2015 in the building that once housed the anarchist satirical newspaper strongly opposed to the Porfirio Díaz dictatorship El Hijo del Ahuizote (1885–1903). The primarily reflexive dossier interrogates how to situate an archive at the center of a creative venture; how to give motion to a series of documents destined for stillness and oblivion; and how, in the face of today’s injustices, to create the conditions for the archive to “live dangerously,” reawakening critical voices that may otherwise lie dormant in the dusty pages of El Hijo del Ahuizote. The book continues with a section titled “Antimonuments and the Undercommons” that looks at activist approaches to public art, bringing together a comparative analysis of recent antiracist interventions with two conceptually evocative chapters addressing the notion of the “public memorial.” In “Public Art and the Grammars of Antiracism,” Abeyamí Ortega Domínguez and Sarah Abel argue that “racial discourses have historically played a central role in the narratives and practices of state-sponsored public art.”75 In view of this history, they explore what it means to incorporate antiracist and decolonial positions in artistic practices. To begin to form an answer they compare three different “grammars of antiracism,”76 understood as styles of antiracist activity: first, the 2019 exhibition La nación (The Nation), which displayed works by the Mexico City–based artist Yutsil Cruz looking at the imbrication of racism with mestizaje logics through the representation of Indigenous subjects; second, the performance Buscando a Bruno (Looking for Bruno), in which the muxe artist Lukas Avendaño tells the story of the enforced disappearance of his brother 22 Introduction\n\nBruno in 2018 while simultaneously contesting the historically denied right of Indigenous peoples and sexually diverse communities (those who cohabit in the space of the “undercommons”) to become visible public agents;77 and third, the street murals painted by the Pueblo de Xoco, self-identified as one of Mexico’s pueblos indígenas u originarios (Indigenous or originary peoples/ towns), to express their rage at the rapid gentrification of their locality. Taking their cue from Hannah Arendt, Ortega Domínguez and Abel argue that each of these distinct strategies produces “spaces of appearance” that, on the one hand, resist an “aesthetic regime” in which those “outside the canon of racialized class privilege cannot speak” and, on the other, cultivate a gaze in which public art becomes a “political site for the enactment of social justice and the evolution of civil imagination.”78 This reflection on public art’s activist but also utopian dimensions is akin to the subject of the next dossier, a free public library in Mexico City known as Aeromoto, understood by its founders as an “exercise in micropolitics.”79 Aeromoto was created to collectivize books and practices of reading via gatherings and loans from the immediate community. Resisting the idea of private property, which they see as a damaging fiction sustained by the state, Aeromoto encourages the use of books as shared property and common goods that can foster both embodied and anonymous forms of socialization and community. The authors of the next two chapters propose a discussion on the relationship between public grief and mass-scale death. They address the fundamental issues that public art poses both as a mechanism to search for justice in the face of human rights violations and as a means of “symbolic reparation” that seeks to accord recognition to the victims of such violations. While public memorials are often built as a consequence of the legal responsibility of the state to grant material and symbolic reparations to victims of human rights abuses, the “public” character of such memorials has been the subject of much dispute. In “Menos Días Aquí and Bordamos por la Paz: Grief, Social Protest, and Grassroots Memorialization in Mexico’s War on Drugs,” Adriana Ortega Orozco notes the recurrent rejection of official memorials by victims of drug-related violence in Mexico. She in turn describes the emergence of nonofficial (ritual) forms of memorialization in both physical and online contexts responding to the wave of violence unleashed by President Felipe Calderón’s so-called war on drugs. Defining these as “grassroots memorials,” Ortega Orozco identifies in them a strong link between commemoration and social protest. She argues that grassroots memorials have focused on the individual identification of the victims both to become acts of remembrance and to prevent the victims’ voices from being silenced. Moreover, she suggests that new “memorial communities” form Agoraphilia 23\n\naround this political cause on the basis of affective exchanges and other interactions. These practices thus create threads of continuity and persistence that turn them into much more than ephemeral or quasi-spontaneous expressions of grief and call for an expansion of the definition of the grassroots memorial in the direction of longer-lasting forms of commemoration. A dossier by the Antimonuments collective, which has been placing what they call “antimonuments” across Mexico City since 2014 to protest various instances of human rights violations, complements and expands Ortega Orozco’s analysis of the grassroots memorial and points to yet another contemporary expression of this collective practice. In “Conceptualizing the Public: Femicide, Memorialization, and Human Rights Law,” Michael R. Orwicz and Robin Adèle Greeley discuss the Memorial del Campo Algodonero in Ciudad Juárez, mandated by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2009 as a form of symbolic reparation in the landmark human rights case González y otras v. México (or Campo Algodonero). This monument purportedly commemorates the lives of three young women brutally murdered in gender-related violence in Ciudad Juárez in 2001. It also calls attention to the state’s violation of international human rights law in failing to protect women from systemic discrimination. However, as the authors note, since its inauguration in 2012, the Campo Algodonero memorial has been a site not of public commemoration but of vociferous contestation by the very audience for which it was intended: the families and representatives of the murdered women. The scorn directed at this public monument reveals the contested character of the public while making visible unresolved tensions among what would best be described as a plurality of publics, from the direct victims of femicide and their families to larger political constituencies. The authors in the book’s concluding section, “Migrant Poetics and Capitalist Landscapes,” suspend traditional categories associated with public art and public space, from monumentality to state involvement. Furthermore, they explore shifting spatialities constituted by often invisible flows of capital—which nevertheless result in very concrete forms of spatial exclusion—and by the migratory flows of people to whom any kind of public belonging is often denied. In the first chapter, the architect and artist Arturo Ortiz-Struck explores the relationship between public participation and the living conditions of political bodies. Discussion of public assembly has described public spaces as sites where individuals—or bodies—come together to make a political claim. As Judith Butler suggests, this “presumes that public space is given, that it is already public and recognized as such.”80 Both the privatization of areas formerly seen as “common ground” and the criminalization and repression of certain forms 24 Introduction\n\nof protest tell a different story, one of continuous dispute and struggle for the existence and the signification of political assembly. Civil movements “have depended on the prior existence of pavement, street, and square,”81 qualities of urban space that Ortiz-Struck describes as gradually disappearing within mass-scale new housing developments on the peripheries of major Mexican cities, which have been designed to maximize financial gain. Ortiz-Struck claims that in the last twenty years public policies aimed at building social housing have resulted in the creation of over fourteen million housing units in isolated residential complexes located far away from sources of employment and with deficient access to public services. Although from a financial point of view the strategy has been successful, the resulting urban environments have created precarious living conditions for their inhabitants. A high percentage of the houses have been abandoned, not only due to poor construction and inconvenient location but also because of the prevailing insecurity in desolate and impoverished walled communities. The urban planning of housing complexes tends not to consider a variety of uses of space, including parks and plazas for public exchange and discussion. Common space is reduced to areas for circulation and mock playgrounds with added bits and pieces of greenery. Ortiz-Struck spent years studying these spaces and describing them using Georges Perec’s exercises in street observation. On this basis, he suggests that the social housing model promoted by government institutions in Mexico over the past three decades—reliant on lucrative international investment—is not just ineffective at promoting greater equality and social diversity but directly hinders individuals and families from engaging in collective discussion and public action. Ortiz-Struck’s thinking about the politics of space shifts the locus of public action from an anthropocentric view, focused on the political will of (rational and) organized publics, to a concept of assemblage and assembly that outweighs human agency. In other words, he suggests that we must consider how material assemblages constitute, organize, and potentially transform political entities. This view expands common understandings of “the political” into a more-than-human terrain that Bruno Latour describes by means of the German neologism Dingpolitik, referring to the politics of things, buildings, and landscapes.82 Infrastuctures and their effects on bodies—their capacity not just to support them but also to leave them vulnerable and exposed—have different degrees of visibility and intelligibility, which are themselves objects of dispute and struggle. The dossier that follows, by Brigada Tlayacapan—an interdisciplinary group of architecture students, construction workers, and local residents from Tlayacapan, Morelos—poignantly addresses this agency of Agoraphilia 25\n\nthe land by discussing the Tlayacapan Brigade’s efforts to help in reconstructing the town in the aftermath of the 2017 earthquake while at the same time trying to preserve local traditional construction methods. Rather than being limited to people’s sense of belonging to a certain place, the dossier addresses the notion of collectivity as able to encompass shared, and often historically inherited, knowledges, occasionally put to the test by large-scale environmental phenomena and natural catastrophes. In “Polvo/Polvoriento/Polvareda: The Poetics of Dust, Dissent, and Migration,” Erica Segre addresses the presence of polvo (dust) in the literary and visual imagining of the Mexican landscape and the way it conjures a poetics of migration, displacement, and (subjective) nomadism, dissociated from fixed or stable localities. From Alfonso Reyes’s Visión de Anáhuac (Vision of Anáhuac) and Palinodia del polvo (Recantation of Dust), via Mariano Azuela, Juan Rulfo, and Rosario Castellanos to José Emilio Pacheco and Mario Bellatin in literature, to the artworks of Helen Escobedo, Felipe Ehrenberg, Gerardo Suter, Francis Alÿs, and Teresa Margolles, Segre argues that dust not only evokes disintegration and dispersal but that it has figured, too, as the accumulation of historical and prehistorical deposits that have the potential to gather together and yield form. Increasingly, the scattered materiality and metaphor of dust has become a measure of mobile indeterminacy, linked to the politics and poetics of exodus, migration, depopulation, and violence. For Segre, thinking about and with dust allows an ambivalent revision of the relationships between identity and environment on the US-Mexico border, capable of eroding and moving beyond fixed imaginaries of nation, identity, and belonging. Furthermore, Segre suggests that the “atomized identities” that dust often signifies “prompt a dislocated sentience that may nevertheless have the capacity to mobilize contestation.”83 Segre’s discussion of a land caught between layers of historical deposits and migratory exodus brings us full circle to the questions that motivate this book: What do we understand by “the public” and “public space” in today’s Mexico? How has so-called public art changed since the 1980s? What ought to be its role in the current century? Can a feminist vision continue to motivate us to supersede the old masculinist notion of “agoraphobia”? I believe that these questions remain timely and important. The toppling of statues around the world, even in defiance of lockdown rules during the Covid pandemic, similarly reminds us that public art is not only undergoing rapid transformations but also lies at the core of contemporary struggles for visibility, recognition, and belonging. The new public art, as a practice, as a process, as a performance, and as a “politics of things,” has become a meaningful agora in itself. This art refuses, by means of collective practice, the neoliberal privatization of every aspect of life. 26 Introduction\n\nNotes 1.\n\n2. 3.\n\n4.\n\n5. 6.\n\n7. 8.\n\n9. 10.\n\n11. 12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\nTo everyone’s surprise, Mexico suffered a third earthquake on September 19, 2022.

We seek to study the process through which muralism’s public role was reactivated, in various senses and through a variety of approaches, in a number of practices between 1970 and 1990. The Mexican artist Melquiades Herrera once said that there was a time when “the revolution dismounted its horse”;1 in this text we walk through the itineraries through which muralisms, in the plural, came down from the wall. These are the itineraries that some conceptual and experimental artists undertook during those decades as a form of criticism of the period’s ideological field. Many of these artists were born in the thirties and forties and stood against “la vieja bestia” (the old beast), that is, the modern pictorial tradition in Mexico.2 Over the years, a number of schools of thought with local agendas have employed different terms, from conceptualism to nonobjectualisms, as an entryway into these experimental practices. They attempted to reason through or against “the new” as a critical means of understanding artistic practice and 33\n\nits relationship with the avant-garde. In this chapter, we wish to explore how, in the late seventies and early eighties, Mexican art and art criticism activated a series of disputes in favor of and against heterogeneous modalities of muralism, often from antagonistic positions. Taking into account artists from different generations, we discuss a series of critical approaches to muralism during a period of intense experimentation: David Alfaro Siqueiros and the creation of the Sala de Arte Público; José Luis Cuevas and other abstract painters who produced ephemeral murals; Felipe Ehrenberg and his proposal of portable self-made murals; and Melquiades Herrera’s conceptual and mass-media muralist exercises. As we discuss the work of these figures, we also review analytical constructions formulated by art critics and theorists such as Alberto Híjar, Ida Rodríguez Prampolini, and Juan Acha, who not only oversaw the emergence of committed and conceptualist practices during the 1970s and 1980s but also offered perspectives that subverted cultural hegemony by studying muralism “again.” When we refer to muralism in this text, we allude not only to an artistic current, a monumental format, or a visual movement but also to the process of producing an aesthetic theory linked to public artistic practice.3 Mexican muralism was a political-aesthetic movement led by artists, among whom the most visible were Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros—known as “the three greats” (los tres grandes). Despite most of the scholarly attention being focused on them, the movement was broad, intersectional, and diverse. Due to its proximity to the postrevolutionary state in terms of commissions and methods of production, it became an efficient ideological instrument, yet muralists also articulated political critiques close to socialism and communism. The movement can be periodized around three main eras: the Mexican Mural Renaissance (1920–1925), Plastic Integration (1940–1960), and,4 as we wish to suggest here, New Muralisms (from the 1970s onward). The term “new muralism” first appeared in the conclusion of an article by Juan Acha after the death of David Alfaro Siqueiros in 1974. It also surfaced in a poem written by Melquiades Herrera to commemorate the late “El Coronelazo” (Siqueiros’s nickname) and in various references throughout much of his work, including the video made for public television Uno por 5, 3 por diez (One for Five [Pesos], Three for Ten, 1992). Through the instances we study in this chapter, we contend that “new muralism” does not solely include monumental painting within institutional spaces. Rather, it represents an actualization of the meaning of public art, as well as its political reformulation under the new conditions of late-capitalist economies in Latin America.5 New muralism, in 34 New Muralisms\n\nother words, reviewed, updated, reread, and subverted the mural’s pedagogical, political, and aesthetic system “after muralism.” Muralism: Between Pedagogy and the Museum Octavio Paz issued a judgment against muralism in 1950. Discussing Rufino Tamayo, he argued: “La ausencia de relación entre realidad y las visiones que pretenden expresarla da a buena parte de la pintura de Rivera y Siqueiros y a algunos otros un valor de inauténtico. Cuando su pintura predica, deja de ser lo que ellos quieren que sea: una respuesta orgánica de la realidad”6 (The nonexistent relationship between reality and the visions that seek to express it lies behind much of Rivera’s and Siqueiros’s and others’ work, producing in them a sense of inauthenticity. When their painting preaches, it ceases to be what they want it to be: an organic response to reality). Paz was attempting to negate muralism by reducing it to a type of painted literature in which Rivera was epic, Siqueiros dramatic, and Orozco tragic (although the third, with his anarchic strategies, came off best for Paz). With this narrative, Paz suggested a different artistic genealogy for Mexican art: far removed from “ideology,” isolated from politics, and appealing to the individual.
