        "text": "Project of The Year Award 2022, Architects Newspaper\n\nBest Fa√ßade Award 2022, Architects Newspaper\n\nBienal de Espa√±ola de Arquitectura y Urbanismo XVI BEAU Award\n\nFAD Architecture Award 2023\n\nIV Premio Mini de Dise√±o 2024\n\nIncluded in the list of the most impressive buildings to be finished in 2022 by El Pa√≠s ICON Design.\n\nThe design of Reggio School is based on the idea that architectural environments can arouse in children a desire for exploration and inquiry. In this way the building is thought of as a complex ecosystem that makes it possible for students to direct their own education through a process of self-driven collective experimentation‚Äîfollowing pedagogical ideas that Loris Malaguzzi and parents in the Italian city of Reggio nell‚ÄôEmilia developed to empower children‚Äôs capacity to deal with unpredictable challenges and potentials.\n\nThe design, construction and use of this building is intended to exceed the paradigm of sustainability to engage with ecology as an approach where environmental impact, more-than-human alliances, material mobilization, collective governance and pedagogies intersect through architecture.\n\nThe stacking of diversity as an environment for self-education\n\nAvoiding homogenization and unified standards, the architecture of the school aims to become a multiverse where the layered complexity of the environment becomes readable and experiential. It operates as an assemblage of different climates, ecosystems, architectural traditions, and regulations. Its vertical progression begins with a ground floor engaged with the terrain, where classrooms for younger students are placed. Stacked on top of this, the higher levels are where students in intermediate classes coexist with reclaimed water and soil tanks that nourish an indoor garden reaching the uppermost levels under a greenhouse structure. Classrooms for older students are organized around this inner garden, as in a small village. This distribution of uses implies an ongoing maturity process that is translated into the growing capacity of students to explore the school ecosystem on their own and with their peers.\n\nA more-than-human assembly as the school‚Äôs heart\n\nThe second floor, formalized as a large void opened through landscape-scale arches to the surrounding ecosystems, is conceived as the school‚Äôs main social plaza. Here the architecture encourages teachers and students to participate in school government and to interact with the surrounding landscapes and territories. This 5,000 square-feet central area is over 26-feet high and conceived of as a cosmopolitical agora; a semi-enclosed space crisscrossed by the air tempered by the holm oak trees from the neighboring countryside. A network of ecologists and edaphologists designed small gardens specifically made to host and nurture communities of insects, butterflies, birds and bats. Here, mundane activities like exercising coexist with discussions about how the school is run as a community and what is the way to relate to the neighboring streams and fields. Ultimately, this floor operates as a more-than-human summiting chamber where students and teachers can sense and attune to the ecosystems they are part of.\n\nVisibility of mechanical systems as a pedagogical opportunity\n\nAs an alternative to architecture‚Äôs common efforts to hide mechanical systems, here all services are kept visible, so that the flows that keep the building active become an opportunity for students to interrogate how their bodies and social interactions depend on water, energy, and air exchanges and circulations. The building unapologetically allows pipes, conduits, wires and grilles to become part of its visual and material ecosystem.\n\nThinning, skinning and make fluffy as an affordable environmental strategy\n\nIn the context of Southern Europe, where high-tech sustainable solutions are only available to high-budgeted, corporate or state-promoted buildings, this building develops a low budget strategy to reduce its environmental footprint based on the following design principles:\n\nVerticality to reduce land occupation. Instead of opting for a horizontally-expanding land-occupation ‚Äì as is the case for 90% of school designs ‚Äì Reggio School is a compact vertical building. This design decision minimizes the building‚Äôs footprint, optimizes the overall need for foundations, and radically reduces its fa√ßade rate.\n\nRadical reduction of the construction. No claddings, no drop ceilings, no raised technical floors, no wall lining, no ventilated fa√ßades are used in this building. The overall amount of material used in the facades, roofs and interior partitions of the building has been reduced by 48% just by replacing a big part of the construction by simple strategies or thermal insulation and mechanical systems distribution. The result presents a naked building where the non-edited visibility of its operating components defines its aesthetics.\n\nA thick wrapping of living isolation. Cork wrapping as both thermal isolation and support to more-than-human life. 80% of the envelope of the building is externally covered by a 14.2 cm of projected 9,700 Kg/m3 dense cork. This natural solution, specifically developed by the Office for Political Innovation for this project, is used both in vertical and pitch parts of the building‚Äôs external volume to provide a thermal isolation of R-23.52, double that what Madrid‚Äôs regulations require. This adds to the passive 50% reduction of consumed energy when heating of the school‚Äôs interiors. Beyond this, the irregular surface of the cork projection is designed to allow organic material to accumulate, so that the envelope of the building will eventually become the habitat of numerous forms of microbiological fungi, vegetal and animal life.\n\nMore thinking, less material. Led by researcher and structural engineer Iago Gonz√°lez Quelle, the team has shaped, analyzed and dimensioned the building‚Äôs structure so that the thickness of loading walls can be reduced an average of more than 150 mm compared to conventional reinforced concrete structures. Overall, this implied a 33% reduction in the embedded energy of the building‚Äôs structure.\n\nMATCOAM Sustainability Award 2022\n\nLiving Places ‚Äì Simon Architecture Price 2022\n\nSince the 1980s, vast stretches of land in the formerly-rural county of Molina de Segura (Murcia) have been exploited to create suburbs. The result of this exploitation is a flattening of the land‚Äôs topographies and the destruction of its territorial system of ravines (ramblas). Ramblas constitute a fabric of veins carved by seasonal rainfall in the dry steppe landscape. In them, humidity accumulates and biodiversity flourishes. They constitute corridors of freshness, carbon fixation, and ecological entanglement that play a crucial role in the climatic and earthy stability of Molina de Segura‚Äôs ecosystems.\n\nThe Rambla Climate-House works as a climatic and ecological device. It is part of a series of associative initiatives, developed at the scale of independent citizens, to contribute to reparations for the environmental and climate damage caused by over-urbanization in Molina de Segura. The Rambla Climate-House collects pooled rainfall from its roofs and grey water from its showers and sinks to spray onto the rambla‚Äôs remains and regenerate their former ecologic and climatic constitution. Humidity and conductivity Netro-sensors activate an automatized meteorology that escapes the control of humans to reach the requirements of the reparation process. The house is organized around this elliptical section of rambla, as an observatory in alliance to this reconstructed landscape and as a sequence of interconnected spaces of different widths.\n\nFollowing the reparation of the hydro-thermal conditions of the rambla, glimpses of its former more-than-human life have rapidly re-emerged after a one year period. Now, brachypodiums, myrtles, mastic trees, fan palms, oleanders, and fire trees grow in the elliptical section. Insects, birds, and lagomorphs find shelter in it.\n\nThermally, the construction of the house tests unorthodox ways to maximize energy efficiency. A marble bench around the elliptical section allows residents to cool off by allowing direct contact to the house‚Äôs thermal inertia. A coil exposed to the sun, crowning the elliptic section, provides passive hot water during the entire year.\n\nThe Rambla Climate-House is the result of a collaboration between architects Andr√©s Jaque/Office for Political Innovation and Miguel Mesa del Castillo; the edaphologist Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Mena; and the ecologists Paz Parrondo Celdr√°n and Rub√©n Vives. All are committed to contributing to the growing grassroots movement claiming climate reparation in Murcia. Since its completion, the house has became a demonstrative device. Gatherings with neighbors and members of the extended Molina de Segura community are organized to share insights and experiences on a collective effort to reground Molina de Segura‚Äôs urbanisms.\n\nWinner of Architectural Competition in Restricted Contest\n\nBabyn Yar is a living tragedy that is not sensed. It is not an episode of the past, but a pulsing presence that shapes current existence, and yet remains silenced. At Babyn Yar, since 1941, a part of humanity has been intentionally concealed by being territorialized in a 149 Ha. terrain.This is not a metaphor, but a material presence. The different layers of Babyn Yar‚Äôs grounds, its topographies, aquifers, specific species of trees, paths, infrastructural remains, they are all constituted as the living presence of more than 100,000 bodies that are still segregated, silenced and victimised, and that are still a living testimony of dissidence to totalitarianism, violence and exploitation.\n\nThe question is how can humans, institutions and practices feel, acknowledge, and account for a territorialized crucial part of our existence? A crucial part of our existence that is hidden in the form of a seemingly ordinary territory that persists in time as unscrutinized. The architecture needs to reveal the momentous relevance of the ordinary. The architecture needs to simultaneously laboratize, ritualize and claim. This is what we propose to mobilize architecture as a force that contributes to produce and disseminate knowledge; to instigate feelings, believes and engagement; to provide evidence and claims for memory reparation and vigilance for justice.\n\nWe propose two simple but radical strategies:\n\n1. To territorialize the building of the Former Office of the Jewish Cemetery, in order to allow it to operate as a node and a section of Babyn Yar.\n\nWe propose to raise 20 m. its roof; creating a space of observation, ritualization and collective inquire in between the roof and the building. Allowing to gain the capacity to perceive the entire extension of Babyn Yar. We propose as well to make its basement descend 10 m. below the ground; to reach the point of non-anthropized ground; making visible and accounting for the layers of earth that comprise a big part of the presences Babyn Yar‚Äôs testimonies are enacted by. This underground chamber would be made out of rammed walls fabricated with earth from the site.\n\n2. To connect the building with a serious of light elements distributed in the territorial extension of Babyn Yar that would allow to read from the building the time and space scales in which the memory and presences of Babyn Yar unfold.\n\nFirst Phase completed in 2019\n\nOBSERVATORY\n\nThe Ocean Space installs itself right where the ocean develops; where it becomes critical; where it shows its richness; and where it is disputed, challenged, and jeopardized. Its architecture is not a closed wunderkammer, but an open observatory in live connection with the ocean, a hub where the diversity that composes the ocean can be reached and explored. Nor is it a container; instead it is an access point where one can sense, present, quantify, discuss, and support the ocean.\n\nIMMERSION\n\nThe architectural design of the Ocean Space takes advantage of San Lorenzo‚Äôs generous vertical void, its diagonal light coming from upper thermal windows, and its immediate vicinity to maritime waters in order to create a bodily experience of immersion. The space is conceived as empty but dense, crossed by beams of sunlight, like diving into an ocean. The dense watery void is loosely occupied by translucent, blue-ish, floating platforms made of glass. To move inside the space, one must go vertically from platform to platform thought the dense void, as a diver would do.\n\nINTERSECTION\n\nThe architecture of the Ocean Space promotes the intersection of art, science, politics, story telling, and activism. The space‚Äôs large size allows different activities to happen simultaneously and without division. Contributing to this varied-use space are the furniture, lights, curtains, and the physical dimensions of the space itself. All of this allows the public to mix with itself. It is an infrastructure that promote diverse MODES OF ENGAGEMENT.\n\nOcean Space‚Äôs adjacent areas become a resource for its neighbors. These spaces are conceived as an infrastructure to promote a daily life of environmental engagement. They are equipped as a shared domestic infrastructure with kitchen, coffee makers, rooms for residents, working spaces, access to the Ocean‚Äôs Archive, and available rooms for formal or informal events and gatherings. This works as a shared domesticity promoting the encounter of people sharing an interest in engaging environmentally.\n\nThe architecture of the OCEAN SPACE is a SYSTEM IN PERMANENT EVOLUTION.\n\nThere is no fixed form. It is in a constant state of change. Its architecture is made of modular components. Its platforms can be reconfigured again and again. They can be dismounted and mounted in different compositions to respond to new situations, work, meetings, or formats of action. All these components can travel to the network of locations where TBA21 develops its action: to Jamaica, to London‚Äîanywhere the ocean is being discussed.\n\nNODE OF MULTIPLIED CAPACITIES\n\nThe architecture of the Ocean Space works as a plug-in system, turning the old space of San Lorenzo into a NODE OF MULTIPLIED CAPACITIES allowing for data to be transferred at any point in space. This ecosystem is where action and reflection can benefit from finding the resources needed to expand and gain reach. This is achieved though the introduction of a network of services integrated in the floating platforms that work as a core to which terminals can be plugged into.\n\nLEVELS OF URGENCY. RENDERING ENVIRONMENTAL URGENCY BODILY SENSIBLE\n\nThe different platforms of Ocean Space‚Äîin a direct but conceptually, bodily, and politically effective way‚Äîbring the urgency and the need to discuss the ocean into the space. This is the ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù. It is a move to render abstract scientific information vivid. The first level, a wooden platform floating 40 cm above the level of San Lorenzo, indicates the estimated sea level rise by 2100 if current carbon emissions remain consistent (Source: Delta Commese). The next level of platforms, at 4.19 m., indicates the sea level height predicted by COP21 for 2215.\n\nTHE OCEANIC CHAMBER. A PARLIAMENT FOR THE OCEAN.\n\nThe Ocean Space presents a chamber for a heterogeneous constituency of humans and multiple other species to coexist in the ocean and grow a common understanding and cooperation. It is an elevated space from where the vision of the ocean at the horizon can be seen though the thermal windows. An immersive multimedia invasion of domes and the shared table, as a contemporary version of a planetary fresco, will make it possible to bring into the room the rich life in the South Pacific deep sea, the way sharks perceive the long distance they orientate in, the evolution of Raja Ampat coral reefs. With calibrated optical devices, this chamber will make it possible for humans to expand their sensing capacity to gain criticality and to recognize the agency of others. TBA21 will mediate an interspecies cooperation where the role of the ocean as a space of coexistence can be empowered.\n\nAwarded 2018 Europe Best Restaurant Design\n\nR√íMOLA. A Marble-Made Tent in the Galaxy\n\nThis project transforms the former 1946 garage of Gutierrez Soto‚Äôs most significant building, located in the geographical center of Madrid, into an assembly of bakery, caf√© and experimental restaurant. The original volume and structure of the building is recovered, leaving a 5-meter-high space with massive openings onto the streets.\n\n‚ÄúZahara is a mix of desert, coincidence and cafeter√≠a‚Äù\n\nPedro Almod√≥var, La mala educaci√≥n.\n\nSince 2008, architecture in Madrid has suffered the hegemony of low-wage-based corporative franchises that have concluded a slow invasion of the city. Within nine years, this process has marginalized and set close to extinction the whole material and human context of marble, leather, gold-chrome-plated metal, and rare woods paneling craftwork that has, since the 1960s, been the social base in the development of the network of Madrid‚Äôs cafeter√≠as: shining, comfortable places where anonymous service is provided and where this service, delivered with equal and standardized courtesy to everyone, has quickly turned them into spaces where women and LGBTQ communities. This project is the result of a strategy to work with a small number of super-qualified marble manufacturers, leather upholsterers, metal benders and chrome-platers, rare-wood panelers and artisan varnishers behind the material production of Madrid‚Äôs cafeterias by taking their capacities a step further: to reintroduce into the city‚Äôs ecosystem the counter-austerity dissident space of the independent cafeter√≠a as a resistance to corporative hegemony.\n\nA marble-made tent in the galaxy. Taking advantage of supermarble‚Äôs capacities to resist traction.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s the tiny town of Novelda (Valencia) became the hub for a transnational flow of rare marbles. Now inactive, the town‚Äôs extensive pools of accumulated dusty marbles, onyx, and granites from around the world can be seen as an archeology of pre-austerity times. Whereas brick and hydraulic tiles are stock in a discourse of false authenticity, groundness and faked localism; Novelda marbles now embody a refreshingly contingent value. This ungroundness condition of the marbles is registered by a number of technologies attached to it, such as the glass fiver and resin reinforcements, articulated anchoring systems, intended to render marble as a sort of supermarble, capable not only of resisting compression but also traction. In what has been a unique engineering challenge, the project takes this capacity to its limits, by creating a supermarble-made self-standing tent. The tent accommodates the customers‚Äô tables and allows other uses (including cooking) to being organized in a C-shaped periphery around it\n\nLocated on sloping land leading to the quaint natural port of Cala Vadella in Ibiza, the House in Never Never Land is designed to make compatible the preservation of the environmental richness of the valley it stands in (including a unique presence of migratory birds and small mammals) with the hedonistic life the clients aim to develop in the building and with the long term maintenance of the construction‚Äôs financial exploitability. The design of the house is driven by a cosmopolitical ambition of interspecies mediation, as much as by the will to facilitate the building‚Äôs long term feasibility.\n\nThe configuration of the main building makes possible the expansion of the large living room into a ramped multifunctional outdoor space ending in the first in a series of connected swimming pools. Avoiding any hierarchy, one bedroom is placed on either side of the living room. Bedrooms are separated from the living room with foldable walls. When desired, the party activity in the living room can expand into the bedrooms by simply collapsing the walls that separate them.\n\nTo preserve the environmental richness of the valley, the design of the house incorporates a series of calibrations. The three buildings comprising the compound are elevated from the ground for at least 80% of their footprint. The permeability of the terrain, the animal routes it contains, and its vegetal covering are therefore largely preserved. The geometry of the buildings was shaped to avoid the removal of trees. All services at risk of producing accidental leaks or spills are contained within a concrete vessel, to lower the risk of the house polluting the valley in the long run.\n\nThe compound is divided into three buildings to make it possible for parts of the house to be leased separately, increasing the prospects for the house to be temporarily rented out to make its maintenance financially feasible.\n\nPHANTOM. Mies as Rendered Society\n\nArts Institute of Chicago Permantent Collection\n\nFundaci√≥ Mies van der Rohe\n\nIberdrola Collection\n\nGrupo Konecta Collection\n\nACS Collection\n\nPHANTOM: Mies as Rendered Society is an intervention at the Barcelona Pavilion based on a two-year ethnography carried out by the Office for Political Innovation. The project drew from an account of the role played by the so-far-unnoticed basement included in the 1986 reconstruction.\n\nIn the 1980s, the team responsible for reconstructing the 1929 German National Pavilion in Barcelona included a 1,050 square meter basement with a height of 2.4 meters to facilitate the control and maintenance of the Pavilion‚Äôs services and installations. The team also decided that access to the basement should be made difficult so as to avoid its future use as an exhibition space in which Mies and the Pavilion could be explained. Since the 1980s, the basement has hidden all the things that subvert the illusion that the building is not frozen in the same state as the 1929 spring morning when the Pavilion first opened. The basement is the Pavilion‚Äôs portrait of Dorian Grey, containing broken travertine slabs, faded velvet curtains, and broken sheets of glass. The space also hides everything needed to inscribe the Pavilion in a larger geo-social context: the flags that allow the pavilion to mediate politically, the remains of the commercial activities that the Pavilion hosts, and the kitchen where the Pavilion‚Äôs staff has lunch. For the upper floor to seem metaphysical, the basement needs to accommodate the Pavilion‚Äôs ‚Äúphantom public,‚Äù the well-known notion about politics developed by Walter Lippmann [The Phantom Public (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1925)] that Mies, in 1955, declared to have been the origin of his architectural insight.\n\nPHANTOM: Mies as Rendered Society was presented in 2012. A significant portion of the items safeguarded in the basement upon which the Pavilion was built were distributed to different locations throughout the Pavilion‚Äôs upper floor. It is on view in the Permanent Collection Galleries of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTHE TRANSSPECIES KITCHEN, 2022-Present.\n\nby Andr√©s Jaque / Office for Political Innovation in association with M-Marble Project\n\nCooking, digesting, growing, and decomposing are all the same: an alliance between different forms of life. The Transspecies Kitchen is a project by Andr√©s Jaque / Office for Political Innovation, now installed an active at the Middleheim Museum in Antwerp (Belgium). It is the result of a long process that started in 2021, as an association between the NY and Madrid based office OFFPOLINN and the stone fabrication company M-Marble Project. It is a kitchen that decarbonizes cooking, and relies on fermentation as the primary form of food preparation.\n\nThis kitchen is part of a long running dedication of the Office for Political Innovation to interrogate the architecture of eating processes from an ecopolitical perspective (including the 2003 ‚ÄòTechno-Human‚Äô project, the 2007 ‚Äò1 Liter Oil Banquet‚Äô, and the 2019 hybrid space ‚ÄòRunRunRun‚Äô in Madrid).\n\nThe Transspecies Kitchen\n\nKitchening is less physical than ecological and political. Kitchening is the realm of collective living. It is evidence for the impossibility of individual life. As such, the ultimate form of kitchening is zymology (bacteria and fungi-based fermentation). The Transspecies Kitchen is an outing of digestion, as an infrastructure where the politics of life-making are intervened by post-carbon cooking.\n\nThe Transspecies Kitchen is produced out of pieces of marble thrown off as waste by the stone extraction industry. Only 30% of stones extracted in quarries is industrially used; the rest is immediately converted to waste. The Transspecies Kitchen challenges industry‚Äôs waste making, by recirculating and activating the material value to what was previously disposed of. Stones are barely transformed to become part of the Transspecies Kitchen. No other materials that the stone itself is added. An architectural strategy founded on rawness, that alignes with the kitchening strategy, and invites bodies, communities, and territories alike to step back from industrialization and waste-making.\n\nThis post-carbon kitchen operates as a collective intestine that shows that metabolism is not an\n\nindependent process. Instead, metabolism is a collectively constituted process dependent on more-thanhuman alliances. The Transspecies Kitchen dilutes the boundaries between kitchening, eating, and decomposing, which comprise a continuum of molecular progression.\n\nStarting in July 2024, and during the entire Summer, the Transspecies Kitchen is installed and active in the forest of the Middelheim Museum in Antwerp. The kitchen is used as the site for Antwerphagia, the act of eating and being eaten by/as Antwerp‚Äôs ecosystems. At the moment when toxicity in the soil, and climate crisis shape Flanders‚Äô politics, the Antwerphagia is intended to provide alternative transspecies alliances based on mutual care. These alliances are humanly sensed as taste, smell, intoxication, euphoria, sleepiness, drowsiness, dyspepsia, being high, flatulence, diarrhea, heartburn, acidity, intolerance. Our kitchen is not fuelled by gas, nor by electricity. Transspecies kitchening is the art of counting energy out of molecular sociability.\n\nFor the first time, the Shanghai Biennale will operate as an eight-month, evolving, ‚Äúin crescendo‚Äù project conceived as a collective undertaking by artists, activists, and institutions, and unfolding in three phases between November 2020 and June 2021, challenging the usual art biennale format.\n\nTitled Ê∞¥‰Ωì Bodies of Water, the 13th Shanghai Biennale will advocate for processes of planetary re-alliance relying on transspecies collectivity. Exploring forms of fluid solidarity, the Biennale will convene artists to think beyond human-centered and nation-based narratives, connecting the discussions of bodies with those of the environment.\n\nChief Curator Andr√©s Jaque says: ‚ÄúFrom the depth and tempo of a breath to the evolution of an ecosystem, the Biennale will reflect on how collectivities are made tangible and bodied in wet-togetherness, exploring diverting forms of aqueousness. Beyond the confines of flesh and land, the curatorial proposal considers how discharging, breathing, transfusing, flushing, and decomposing are ways in which bodies exist together.‚Äù\n\nThe president of the PSA Academic Committee, Fei Dawei states: ‚ÄúThe preparation of the 13th Shanghai Biennale took place during the uncertain times of a health crisis. ‚ÄúBodies of Water‚Äù presents itself in fluid forms to accommodate the ever-changing reality, while finding ways to confront conventional exhibition-making methods. The Biennale strives to reach a place previous exhibition forms could not access. More importantly, this exhibition is utterly experimental: in the face of the changing global conditions, curatorial practices will continue to explore the possibilities of self-renewal.‚Äù\n\nThe Biennale is engaging with the history and geography of Shanghai, a long-standing arena for liquid territorial bodies, and the site for this Biennale. The city is intimately connected to the 5,000-meter descent to the East China Sea of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau‚Äôs meltwaters located at the intersection of the Huangpu and the Yangtze Rivers, and in the vicinity of the human-made Jing-Hang Grand Canal. Particles dragged from up to 6,300 kilometers of sediment are metabolized by edible plants at the Yangtze Delta, China‚Äôs most fertile agricultural site. Mineral and organic matter, travelling suspended as part of bodies of water, is then rebodied. Water flowing reconstructs geographies and vitalizes organisms. Not without struggle.\n\nThe Shanghai Biennale, the oldest art biennale in China, will ultimately interrogate its own situation at PSA, a former coal-electric plant that fueled the industrialization of the Huangpu River, a cauldron of accelerated production and bodily mobilization.\n\nThis edition will nurture art as an ecosystem of practices closely connected to different forms of human and non-human knowledge, sense, and intelligence. In close collaboration with Shanghai‚Äôs universities and networks of independent art spaces and activism, the Biennale will build on art‚Äôs interdependency with science, social constructs, technology, and modes of spirituality. Rather than presenting art as autonomous, it will provide a platform to acknowledge the diversity in which research and knowledge-making happens and is disseminated.\n\nTHE PHASES: IN CRESCENDO BIENNALE\n\nFor the first time, the Shanghai Biennale will operate as an eight-month ‚Äúin crescendo‚Äù project, unfolding in three phases:\n\nPHASE 01: A WET-RUN REHEARSAL. November 10‚Äì14, 2020. A summit bringing together contributors to present their work in the form of a performative assembly taking place in the PSA‚Äôs Grand Hall and spreading out to networks of art spaces along the Yangtze River, as well as online.\n\nPHASE 02: AN ECOSYSTEM OF ALLIANCES. November 15, 2020 ‚Äì April 9, 2021. Keeping a permanent post at the PSA, the ‚Äúin crescendo‚Äù project associates itself with infrastructures where online/offline social and communal life are taking place. These include streaming TV channels, social media, university programs, and serial interventions on urban dynamics.\n\nPHASE 03: AN EXHIBITION. April 10 ‚Äì June 27, 2021. Opening with a festival, the Biennale will unfold into an exhibition that will run through PSA and expand into a series of locations along the Huangpu River and across the city of Shanghai.\n\nFor architect, writer, and curator Andr√©s Jaque, architecture is first and foremost a political activity, with every aspect of the discipline shaped by conflicts, negotiations, and compromises between stakeholders‚Äîwhether city council representatives, real estate developers, construction workers, actual or prospective residents, squatters and bystanders. Since he moved to New York in 2010 Jaque, with his Office for Political Innovation, has built a body of work that examines the invisible networks which structure the city: from nail salons administering the social lives of their often undocumented employees to neighborhood funeral parlors competing to create personal bonds with local families in order to keep business afloat. Jaque‚Äôs new performance for the Performa 2021 Biennial, Being Silica, addresses the codependent relationship between New York City and its neighboring territories encapsulated in UltraClear‚Ñ¢ glass, a new building material that became a fixture of new towers across the city in the past two decades.\n\nUnlike standard clear glass which, if viewed from an edge appears green in hue, the edges of UltraClear‚Ñ¢ glass are seemingly transparent with a 91% light transmission rate. Made of silica, a low-iron mineral, this new type of glass aligns with Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs ideals of a pollution-free city, in which skyscrapers residents enjoy expanses of clear blue skies. The highly sought-after Silica, however, is produced through horizontal fracking‚Äì‚Äìa highly toxic process that is banned in New York State.\n\nBeing Silica engages with how much the previous major‚Äôs clean air project for New York happened at the expense of peripheral areas such as Illinois, where silica is extracted, and Pennsylvania, where fracking takes place to produce the energy required to manufacture the new glass. In a 51-minute-long multimedia piece performed for a small group on three consecutive mornings, Andr√©s Jaque and his Office for Political Innovation invited spectators to physically experience the unsettling sound and vibrations emitted from deep within the earth during the process of fracking. Set in a Manhattan skyscraper, Being Silica invites the audience to draw their attention to what is usually transparent and unexamined: the glass that separates them from the exterior. The performance reveals the complex trail of damage behind technologies of civic beautification. Comprising a sound installation interspersed with conversations with anti-fracking activists, the performance unpacks the intertwinement of political, economic, and social questions in construction today.\n\n‚ÄòBeing Silica‚Äô Looks Hard at the Environmental Cost of Supertall Views by Whitney Mallett (Curbed)\n\nAndr√©s Jaque Discusses His Latest Performance, Being Silica (Metropolis)\n\nIntimate Strangers is a multimedia installation, resulting from two years of fieldwork at Grindr‚Äôs headquarters in West Hollywood. The project was produced and first presented at the Design Museum of London.\n\nLaunched in 2009 by Nearby Buddy Finder, Grindr was the first gay-men-oriented Locative Geosocial Media. There are over one million active Grindr users at any time, yet 20% of the company‚Äôs servers are located in countries where gay sex is banned. The app has been seen as a space for LGBT emancipation, providing access to sex for a global population of gay men, of which no less than 11% remain closeted. A limited number of single-men profiles are available for users to check by dragging their fingers across sexy photographs behind the potassium-coated ion-strengthened glass of their smart phones. Grindr has helped to normalize gayness. It has become a place for gay celebrities to be seen, a location for streaming media from JW Anderson‚Äôs 2016 Summer menswear show, and a place for Paper Magazine to recruit models. Grindr has also been seen as a counter-queer space in the age of same-sex marriage. The app has been criticized for its contribution to transforming gay societies from being spaces of rough collective gender activism into becoming networks of confortable lifestyle consumption based on contexts of healthy-looking individuality and one-to-one intercourse.\n\nGrindr is urban but it is not a city. It is not fixed to a piece of land but distributed in unstable constellations. Bodies, mirrors, cellphones, servers, satellites, clothes, skins, backgrounds, software, interfaces, etc. all participate in the making of a collective neural system, unapologetically jumping from one city to another, and into the countryside. Not just accommodated by the urban, Grindr has become a kind of urbanism in its own right. It is both super-immaterial and super-material. It is a network of constantly moving parts, linked by desire. The setting is permanently active, constantly being produced: by updating profiles, by dragging one profile to the next one, by disappearing from one person‚Äôs screen to become available on another‚Äôs. If Buckminster Fuller dreamt of a world of omnidirectional connectivity in the air, Grindr is the fulfillment of his vision. It is an urban enactment in which LGBT realities are made in online and offline realms, where proximity, intimacy, profiling, and the mathematics of sex are experienced and disputed. Urban tribes are defined and empowered, and racial or bodily features‚Äîno blacks, no fems, no fat‚Äîbecome reasons for rejection. Isolated gay men, living in countries where homosexual practices are banned and punished, gain access to an alternative space for interaction. Intolerant governments can also use Grindr to track, harass, and arrest gay men. But at a time when many western cities are being sanitized through gentrification, locative sex has become an urbanism in which emancipation, empowerment, connection, rejection, crime‚Äîlove and fear‚Äîare brought together.\n\nSixty-three years after the iconic exhibition ‚ÄúThis is Tomorrow‚Äù gave birth to British pop art, Whitechapel Gallery summons some of the most challenging architects and artists to anticipate the tensions that will define the future of the planet. For this occasion, Andr√©s Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation worked with video artist and icon of disco Jacolby Satterwhite to propose a trans-sectional architecture that connects the big-scale realms where contemporary societies are being defined: online porn, real estate, interior decoration, in-vitro fertilization, and the offsetting of daily environmental costs. This new regime of environmental, corporeal, aesthetic and financial exclusivity emerges as a substitute for what has historically been the city‚Äôs role in provided a setting for the social: HIGHENDCRACY\n\nDuring the last 15 years, New York City evolved by evacuating its clumsiness, depurating its air and waters, and reclaiming its dumping fields. Post-2008, it became a sanitized, assets-oriented urbanism, a highendcracy of trading air-rights within blocks, LLC-shelled identities, and the reinforcement of the 421-A tax exception‚Äîall of which rendered the city an ecosystem to produce, reproduce, and accommodate value. Now Columbus Circle is the world center for the reinvention of human reproduction. Elective cytoplasm selection, spindle nuclear transfer, cell banks, and surrogacy have been combined in the last decades though archiurban calibrations to make New York the location for a new human type, the citizens of highendcracy.\n\nReal estate rendered New York fully sexualized. Chelsea became the planet‚Äôs most wanted location to turn on Grindr. And as new San Fernando Valleys, rent-spiking Greenpoint and Chelsea are now home to two of the hottest adult studios, Burning Angel and Cocky Boys, where refined productions scape garage-like interiors to shoot their Pornhub scenes, which get millions of views, in sunny, lofty condominiums with views of purified blue skies. This kind of bluish sky was invented as a rendered reality for New York‚Äôs most successful architectural icon, 432 Park Avenue, and then taken as a detail of its architecture by using a fixed, Austrian Eckelt Lite-Wall glass for its windows, designed to intensify the blue part of daylight‚Äôs spectrum. This material adjustment synchronizes the architectural detail with the city‚Äôs territorial project of displacing the environmental cost of its consumptions to rural locations in neighboring states.\n\nIn response to being invited to renovate the CA2M, a museum in central Spain, the project proposes that rather than close the building during remodeling, the museum should remain open so that the architecture itself is an object on display.\n\nRESET CA2M endeavors to show that architecture is much more than the realization of a finished object, but rather requires navigating a tangle of bureaucracies and regulations.\n\nThe original building, constructed in 2008 as a museum of contemporary art, has never worked well for its purposes. The museum recently received a donation of important and significant art‚Äîfrom contemporary giants like Damien Hirst to older artists like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd. This collection, added to the museum‚Äôs original collection, has expanded the institution beyond what the original museum building imagined and intended.\n\nInstead of demolishing the building to construct a new one on the same site, the Office for Political Innovation designed a protocol and master plan to transform the museum without closing the institution, which would affect not only the building but the network of people responsible for running it.\n\nThe project is based on three principles. The first one is to distribute the transformation of the building over time. Rather than a final version of the building built at once, the project is a timeline of actions that accumulate, one on top of the other, to produce a totally different material setting and infrastructure for the museum.\n\nThe second principle is that the process of architectural transformation can be coupled with the contents of the museum. So the actual building of the museum becomes an exhibition. It allows architecture to be discussed, scrutinized, and analyzed by the public, and it becomes an action of enrollment.\n\nThe third one has been conceived as a precautionary principle: by doing things sequentially there is an opportunity for each change to be experienced and discussed‚Äînot only by the architect or museum staff, but by a broader network of affected actors who then have the opportunity to inform the next steps with their opinions of what has already happened.\n\nManifesto for a Sweet Domestic Seoul\n\nDomesticity in Seoul is no longer something that happens in a single place, the house, but rather something that is constructed by connecting different spaces spread throughout the city. Home is not spatially fixed, unitary, and consistent; it is discontinuous, fragmented, and constantly changing.\n\nSeoul is the strategy to segregate social realities to make daily life un-political. But every depoliticizing strategy gets its response. A number of urban home fragments act as parliamentary spaces where diversity is confronted. These are the fragments the project takes into account and prototypes. Discussion can happen in a warm space based on affection. This is our proposal: To bring politics and conflict into ordinary life.\n\nHomes tend to be thought of as places where conflict, diversity, and the public are left behind to find familiarity and a non-political calm. But a number of daily evidences could be seen as an opportunity to think of domestic interiors as places where we get to meet social networks (both online and offline) to manage our associations and to take part in discussion arenas. Shared homes are parliaments in which we get to share our living, get connected, and encounter otherness. Homes are material and non-material conglomerates of problematic limits.\n\nSweet Parliament Home is the making of a politically-activated home. It is a result of five years of research by Andr√©s Jaque Architects on domestic interiors as being political. This idea of home is one in which domesticity lives with the unfamiliar and in which home is made for activism, controversies, and institutional discussion. It is the making of public homey space. Four rooms, available to be used by specialized groups, converge into a common area. The common area works as a calculation device in which differences between groups are made explicit through confrontation; but this confrontation happens around a tended garden, providing the disputes with an affective constitution.\n\nUrbanism has been formally a practice that divides its development into a big hierarchy of scales. It is only when opportunities to both describe and project it as a ‚Äúfoam‚Äù of engaged domesticities arise that notions of collectiveness are incorporated and promoted.\n\nThe design of the first exhibition of the recently created Design, Architecture and Digital Department at the Victoria and Albert Museum, ‚ÄúThe Future Starts Here,‚Äù is the result of a long selection process that resulted in the appointment of the New York/Madrid-based office Andr√©s Jaque / Office for Political Innovation. Curated by Rory Hide and Mariana Pestana, the show examines the way 100 objects and technologies are currently tendering for disputed and diverging options for the future.\n\nIn the show, design moves away from 1950-60s persisting notions of space-age futures to create a series of contexts in which future scenarios, announced by already existing technologies, can be seen integrated into ordinary, recognizable settings, which results in the accumulation of existing architectures: Victorian gingerbread architectures mixed with brutalist architectural components and plastic-made, free topographies‚Äîa colorful, lighted vision of the future where the exhibited objects and technologies, instead of being presented in surprising fantastic realms, can be found as contributors in the making of common situations, inserted in familiar settings (a kitchen, a bathroom, a cafe, a street, a public parlor, a landscape, a corporate office).\n\nStructured as a scalar progression in five acts, the show starts with an immersion into domestic life and the way it is currently being disputed by different notions of desirable evolution of domesticity. The narrative is introduced by a robot designed to do laundry. Following this is an arena where politics, corporations, and civil society confront and interact with each other. A back-lighted section of the planet, organized as a display in vertical levels from the deepest reachable strata of the earth to outer space, contains the way our environments are now being challenged at a planetary scale. This dichroic bubble collects technologies providing space for alternative modes of extending human afterlife. The exhibition concludes with the testimony of Cindy, a woman who uses low-tech prosthetics to deal with the toll severe diabetes has taken on her body, and by providing information and ways for the audience to take action in the making of possible futures. Together, all five acts are intended to reconstruct a sequentially scaling-up approach to a world both divided and convened by the discussions of alternative ways to construct possible futures. The exhibition works as an urbanism of five colorful techno-parliaments, where the use of large signs poses questions that help translate to the V&A audience a discussion in which objects and technology take part.\n\nAs an information platform, the exhibition overlaps five channels of information. The first one is composed of the actual presence in the gallery of the objects and technologies that are being experienced and discussed. Aligned with V&A‚Äôs focus on object-based exhibitions, this show includes an exceptional collection of objects, some quotidian, that gain a new criticality when placed within the context of the exhibition‚Äôs broader discussion. Other objects are totally unknown by the public or are seldom seen. The second channel is formed by the description and referential labeling of all objects, and the uses and contexts in which they take part. The third is the immersion of all objects in architectural and audiovisual atmospheres that provide the opportunity for these technologies to be seen as active and for the museumgoers to experience them as part of daily life. The fourth is constituted by a series of questions that reconstruct each act as an arena in which public collaboration is required to account for the criticality at stake in the various notions of what ‚Äúfuture‚Äù means among the different technologies in the show. The final layer provides opportunities for museumgoers to take action, to express and made public their takes and to contribute them to the discourses the show preserves and communicates.\n\nAndr√©s Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation‚Äôs work redefines the political status of architectural materiality. Rather than focusing on isolated objects, their work explores daily life as the result of the interaction between multiple entities, operating at different scales and temporalities. Bodies, buildings, social media, vegetal species, and natural resources are ensembled in shared projects to which architecture, as a political practice, contributes through intervention, empowerment, rearticulation, disobedience, and confrontation. In the Office‚Äôs work, matter is a multiple, interscalar, and performative reality: a ‚Äútransmateria,‚Äù resulting from the displacement from the bodily to the territorial, from the biological to the geographical, from the offline to the online. Domestic environments, rather than working as places of sweet familiarity, become arenas of difference. In cosmopolitical compositions, different species negotiate the terms of their coinhabitance. Strategies for the public to install itself in the contemporary networks where power happens or to gain an agency in dynamics that are impossible to govern become, in the work of Andr√©s Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation, opportunities to explore specific forms of political action.\n\nInstalled at the intersection of design, research, and activism, the Office‚Äôs work is based on the unveiling of the mechanisms that make architecture operate as an agent of exclusion, in order to then propose strategies and devices capable of challenging these mechanisms. Historical architectural works, such as Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich‚Äôs Barcelona Pavilion or Charles and Ray Eames‚Äôs Powers of Ten, are reconstructed in the work of Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation in order to reveal the conflicts and dependencies that the original projects concealed. In the same way, designs such as the House in Never Never Land, COSMO, Escaravox, and the Plasencia Clergy House reorganize the societies they participate in, so that these projects can act within the tensions and controversies they are part of.\n\nArchitecture does not accommodate the societal; architecture is, itself, society. The Office‚Äôs work makes the claim that architectural devices are equipped with a specific political agency: a form of political autonomy by which the dimensions, the qualities, the ensembles, and the performances that architecture contributes to setting into play constitute themselves as bodies and societies. However, this agency is not absolute, but one negotiated with all the other entities participating in the construction of daily life.\n\n‚ÄòTransmaterial Politics‚Äù presents a selection of the work developed by Andr√©s Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation, organized around four constellations of projects, each gathering multiple formats and methodologies to explore the ways that architecture participates in four notions of the political: Sweet Domestic Arenas, Cosmopolitics, Performing Publicness and Sex and the So-Called City.\n\nSales Oddity. Milano 2 and the Politics of Direct-To-Home TV Urbanism\n\nSilver Lion for the Best Research Project 14th Mostra Internazionale di Archittetura della Biennale di Venezia.\n\nThis research-based installation presents the momentous role that architecture played in Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs rise to power. This installation was first exhibited at the 14th Mostra Internazionale di Architettura della Biennale di Venezia, being awarded the Silver Lion for the Best Research Project.\n\nAccounts of Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs power seldom include two of its key sources: namely, architecture and urban- ism. Whereas his involvement in media is seen as a momentous constituent of his political trajectory, what is often forgotten is that his particular way of reinventing the relationship between politics and media was an architectural invention, developed and tested through the interiors, buildings, landscapes, and urbanism to which he and his team devoted a large part of their time and resources, from the late 1960s to the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1968, Silvio Berlusconi, then chair and owner of urban development company Edilnord Centri Residenziali, started to promote ‚ÄúMilano 2,‚Äù a 712,000-square-meter residential city ten minutes from the center of Milan. Present- ed as an alluring and inoffensive mix of rational architecture and vernacular em- bellishment, Milano 2 embodied a radical urbanism. Conceived as an alternative to the converging and homogenizing culture promoted by state-centered postwar European governments, this new urban model would instead segregate society into differentiated clusters of specialized consumption targets. Life in Milano 2 was structured by a cable television service that would grow to become the corpora- tion now known as Mediaset. Milano 2‚Äôs capacity to integrate the economic, social, and political evolution of its inhabitants was fueled by a series of design strategies meant to coordinate TV programming, interiors, access to commodities and services, architecture, and landscaping into what I will call ‚Äútransmedia urbanism.‚Äù This coordination was intended to render Berlusconi‚Äôs company as the compulsory node in a new context in which purveyors, consumers, and the links that brought them together were reinvented.\n\nAn alternative version of SATC made by Andr√©s Jaque / Office for Political Innovation With the special collaboration of Miguel de Guzm√°n (Imagen Subliminal).\n\nThe Office for Political Innovation discusses the 20th anniversary of New York‚Äôs most influential archisocial manifesto: Sex and the City. This non-stop, ten-week summit stages the most relevant people, places, and processes that played a role in New York‚Äôs cultural shift of the last two decades.\n\nSince the release of SATC‚Äôs first episode in 1998, New York‚Äôs real estate market has doubled. As Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha made their way from Patricia Fields‚Äô thrift-store-heterogeneous-outfits to multi-brand-high-end-opulence, and from one-bedroom rentals to The-World-of-Interiors-like-apartments, New York engaged in an equivalent evolution. The city progressed by evacuating its clumsiness, depurating its air and waters and reclaiming its dumping fields. SATC anticipated what would later become a post-2008, sanitized, assets-oriented urbanism, a highendcracy by which new forms of trading air-rights within blocks, LLC-shelled identities and the reinforcement of the 421-a tax exception rendered the city an ecosystem to produce, reproduce and accommodate value.\n\nAs fictional Charlotte and Miranda struggled to engineer reproduction, and real-life Sarah Jessica Parker‚Äôs daughters were born through surrogacy, Columbus Circle was being transformed as the world center for the reinvention of human reproduction. Elective cytoplasm selection, spindle nuclear transfer, cell banks and surrogacy have been combined in the last decades though archiurban calibrations to make New York the location for a new human type, the citizens of highendcracy.\n\nAs shown in SATC‚Äôs second episode, New York City brought together for the first time Samantha‚Äôs two biggest passions: namely, sex and real estate. Twenty years later, real estate rendered New York fully sexualized. Chelsea became the planet‚Äôs most wanted location to switch on Grindr. And as new San Fernando Valleys, rent-spiking Greenpoint and Chelsea are now home to two of the hottest adult studios, Burning Angel and Cocky Boys, where refined productions scape garage-like interiors to shoot their Pornhub scenes, which get millions of views, in sunny lofty condominiums with views of purified blue skies. This kind of blueish sky was invented as a rendered reality for New York‚Äôs most successful architectural icon, 432 Park Avenue, and then taken as a detail of its architecture by using a fixed Austrian Eckelt Lite-Wall glass for its windows, designed to intensify the blue part of daylight‚Äôs spectrum. This material adjustment synchronizes the architectural detail with the city‚Äôs territorial project of displacing the environmental cost of its consumptions to rural locations in neighboring states.\n\nThe problematic relationship between environment and real estate investment has turned Hong Kong into an arena where citizenship has been increasingly mobilized to discuss architecture and the socio-economic processes in which it takes part.\n\nDespite 73.5 percent of Hong Kong‚Äôs land being undeveloped, it still comes second in the world for metropolitan regions with the most expensive housing stock (an average of $48,543 per square meter) and has the worst access to housing and workspace rentals. This is partially due to government efforts to slow the release of developable land so that huge companies (Swire Properties, MTR, New World, Sino Land, and Sun Hung Kai) can keep the value of their real estate developments and the value of their assets (coming from Southwest Asian industries and markets) from decreasing. These policies find justification in the preservation of environmental resources given Hong Kong‚Äôs terrible pollution; but they have generated an enormous social inequality between those who live in the hills (where most architecture built by international firms is constructed) and those living in the high density valleys.\n\nKai Tak Conflicted Rocks explores the capacity of architecture to subvert in a very literal way the dialectic between natural and constructed; between landscape and architecture. The project shapes a group of artificial mountains that overlap the artificial landscape of the former Kai Tak airfield. The artificial mountains establish a dialogue with the organic mountains that can still be seen behind the corporate skyscrapers of the city skyline. The group of mountains is crossed and joined by a network of alternative and environmental paths.\n\nThe exterior surface of the mountains accommodates an ecosystemic cover designed to improve the environmental conditions of the area. The interior space creates halls for civic and commercial encounters, and is covered by a thick skin made out of dwellings looking onto the bay. These dwellings have direct access to the mountain surface, and they face urban and civic spaces while embracing the artificially natural environment.\n\nManifesta 12, Palermo.\n\nThe Planetary Garden. Cultivating Coexistence.\n\nThroughout history, the city of Palermo has been a laboratory for diversity and cross-pollination. Continuous migration ‚Äì from the Ancient Greeks, the Arabs and the Normans to the recent arrival from Northern Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East ‚Äì has constantly redefined the city and its people. Palermo‚Äôs streets, architecture, parks, cultural legacy and personal histories are the result of a long-lasting syncretism of cultures across the Mediterranean and beyond.\n\nIn the 1875 painting View of Palermo by Francesco Lojacono ‚Äì in the collection of the GAM Museum in Palermo ‚Äì nothing is indigenous. Olive trees came from Asia, aspen from the Middle East, eucalyptus from Australia, prickly pear from Mexico, loquat from Japan. Citrus trees ‚Äì a symbol of Sicily ‚Äì were introduced under Arab sovereignty. The botanical garden of Palermo, Orto Botanico, was founded in 1779 as a laboratory to nurture, study, test, mix and integrate foreign species. Palermo‚Äôs Orto Botanico inspired Manifesta 12 to look at the idea of the ‚Äúgarden‚Äù, exploring its capacity to aggregate difference and to compose life out of movement and migration.\n\nGardens are places where diverse forms of life mix and adapt to co-exist. They allow for crosspollination based on encounter. In 1997, French botanist Gilles Cl√©ment described the world as a ‚Äúplanetary garden‚Äù with humanity in charge of being its gardener. But how to tend to a world that is moved by invisible informational networks, transnational private interests, algorithmic intelligence, environmental processes and ever-increasing inequalities? Twenty years later, the metaphor of the planet as a manageable garden is still attractive, not as a space for humans to take control, but rather as the sites where ‚Äúgardeners‚Äù recognize their dependency on other species, and respond to climate, time, or an array of social factors, in a shared endeavor of caring.\n\nPalermo Atlas, the urban study by OMA, reveals Palermo as a node in an expanded geography of movements ‚Äì of people, capital, goods, data, seeds, germs ‚Äì that are often invisible, untouchable and beyond our control. Palermo is shaped by these flows and journeys, from Somalia to Scandinavia, from Indonesia to Gibraltar and the Americas. Palermo is a global city, but one of the problematic-global, a place where key transnational issues converge ‚Äì from climate change and illegal trafficking to the simultaneous impact of tourism and migration.\n\nPalermo‚Äôs position at the crossroads of three continents makes it an ideal location for Manifesta 12 to investigate some of the key changes of our time. But it is also a place where the current model of globalization is contested with new perspectives on civic engagement. In the 1990s, the Primavera di Palermo social movement against the mafia helped the city emerge from decades of criminal control, with a determination to establish new forms of civic agency. Similar ambitions arise in Palermo today, as it embraces migration and proposes new models of citizenship (the ambition to abolish the residence permit) and human rights (Mayor of Palermo Leoluca Orlando‚Äôs proposal to establish mobility as a human right).\n\nCollaborating closely with Palermitan partners, Manifesta 12 co-inhabits Palermo as a laboratory for the challenges of our time, looking for traces of possible futures. In the context of globalization, Manifesta 12 chooses to be radically local in engaging with the city in all of its diverse components. The Planetary Garden hosts 5 main sections, each touching on key topics of the concept:\n\nGarden of Flows will explore toxicity, plant life and the culture of gardening in relation to the global commons in Orto Botanico.\n\nOut of Control Room will investigate power in today‚Äôs regime of global flows. This part of the biennial takes place in Palazzo Costantino at Quattro Canti, once the political and symbolic center of the city, since long abandoned.\n\nCity on Stage will build on existing opportunities in the outskirts of Palermo to further develop plans that are stuck somehow and have not been realized. Productive collaborations can act as a catalyst and possibly extend into future initiatives in Palermo.\n\nManifesta 12 Publication occupies the space between print and digital with a dynamic publication that will evolve and auto-generate itself as a new issue every day throughout the biennial. Able to be printed on demand, the publication will replace the classic biennial catalogue with a more fluid and collaborative publication for the age of flows.\n\nTeatro Garibaldi hosts a library, caf√© and program of public events, including debates, workshops and film screenings (presentation of films shot in Palermo with introduction and/or Q&A).\n\nExhibition:\n\nManifesta 12, Palermo. The Planetary Garden. Cultivating Coexistence (16.06.18 ‚Äì 04.11.18)\n\nThe S√°bana Santa de Troms√∏ is a seemingly white 60 x 300 cm fabric that was sent inside a shoebox to the Office for Political Innovation headquarters in Madrid by the architect Annike Romuld. The idea was launched a few years earlier during a boring designers meeting in Oslo. The deal established that the Office for Political Innovation would be in charge of making architectural actions using the content of the shoebox with the aim of defining experimentally what could be conceived as an architectural action at that moment.\n\nA detailed study of the packaging could reconstruct the trajectory of the shipping by analyzing the marks on the wrapping paper (stamps, postmarks, customs marks, etc.). The fabric was studied in the same way. The Office for Political Innovation scrutinized it inch by inch, covering all the surface with a thread-counter and extracting some samples to be analyzed in a lab. When the survey was done, the fabric was not as white as it seemed. It had become a space where all the agents and actions in contact with the fabric were represented, a space where a series of social insertions emerged as visible phenomena.\n\nAll detected actions were registered in the fabric with embroidery. The fabric, thanks to the mediation of the embroidery, become then a critical device equipped to promote its own scrutiny. And it is in-between the white fabric and its envelope, in the tension generated between them, where one can find the arguments that make the design a passing point in the process of reconstructing societies.\n\nThe design of the 3rd Istanbul Biennial, ‚ÄúAre We Human?‚Äù, follows four strategies:\n\nInquiring Archipelago\n\nRather than answers, the Biennial provides questions. ‚ÄúAre We Human?‚Äù has been designed as a platform for wide discussion. It is distributed in six different venues, each connected with a specific section of Istanbul‚Äôs dynamic and the networks of interaction in which each takes part. In each venue, the discussion is enacted through a different mode of collective querying: Depo will work as a radio station, Studio X as a lab, Galata Greek School as a school, Bomonti as a time machine, and the Archeological Museum as a wundergallery.\n\nContents from the galleries‚Äô interiors will jump out from their windows. Billboards, buses, and bus stops in between venues will be echoing and expanding onto the streets the debate that the platform\n\nchannels. Rather than a center of diffusion, the Biennial works as a woven-within-the-city questioning platform.\n\nClustered Evidences\n\nThe Biennial brings evidences. They are not celebrated, nor elucidated, but rather displayed for examination. It is not conceived as a collection of isolated installations, but as a sequence of clusters‚Äîconstellations of archaeological, design, artistic, and research work‚Äîmaking it possible to explore their tensions and their capacity to confront and cooperate with each other.\n\nColliding Publics\n\nEvents, presentations, panel discussions, and practical services (caf√©, shop, etc.) are all accommodated within the exhibition spaces. Performances and exhibited works mutually expand and dispute each other. These services are taken as opportunities to interrogate the way they relate to the ‚ÄúAre We Human?‚Äù debate. The gallery collides all groups of people, moods, and attitudes, recognizing all of them as enactors of content and criticality.\n\nTransmedia Constituencies\n\nEvery venue is thought of as a transmedia demarcation. Depo works as a radio station as well as the base for the Superhumanity Network of text production, translation, distribution, and reception. Its offline space will operate as a node in the making of an online cyber community. The calendar of contributions is hosted by a mural timeline that will get progressively covered with arriving contributions from around the world. The actual process of translating the texts will be happening in Depo, where the process becomes visible and unblackboxed to the examination of the Biennial‚Äôs visitors. Studio X becomes the headquarters of the working group that is already composing a timeline of Turkish modern design.\n\nEvery week their meetings are hosted in what is being called ‚Äúthe wunderscanner,‚Äù a device that exhibits the material findings of the group and empowers the capacity of the group to use their findings as instigators of research. Greek School is prepared to become an open-plan and classroom-less satellite of Istanbul‚Äôs schools; students from all around the city were enrolled in the Biennial‚Äôs discussions and activities. Bomonti, expanding its opening hours into the night, is prepared to host daily events within the space of its galleries. A dance floor and the ‚Äú2 Seconds TransBoarding Room‚Äù paired their use as daytime exhibition devices with a nightlife of uncertain interaction, edited online and broadcasted to the already numerous ‚ÄúAre We\n\nHuman?‚Äù network of distant followers.\n\nDependency is the new centrality\n\nFacts. Fourteen percent of people in Upplands V√§sby are considered dependents (994 children under the age of two, 2,208 of adults over 75 in need of care, approximately 904 people with permanent disabilities, and approximately 1,998 people affected by diseases). All of Upplands V√§sby‚Äôs population will depend on social solidarity for an average of 12 percent of their lives.\n\nStatement. The project provides a spatial mediation between domestic and public realms to allocate social care, nursing, and assistance. Solidarity becomes a form of urban centrality. Solidarity is here the new excitement.\n\nDesign Strategy. 1.1. A series of facilities accommodate care: nursing and assistance resources are installed unapologetically in between homes and covered gardens. 1.2. Doors and windows are designed to open directly into the covered garden so the immersion of a shared scenario will provide a passive community integrated assistance. 1.3. A series of mini-apartments for friends or relatives temporarily caring for a community member will be provided under community management.\n\nMoving, non-moving as urban scene\n\nFacts. Daily life in Upplands V√§sby is shaped by the friction of two mutually dependent communities: one community of people displacing the land on a daily basis (45 percent of the actual Upplands V√§sby population: 8,171 ingoing commuters + 13,744 outgoing commuters) and a second community of a predominantly stationary population composed of people living and working in Upplands V√§sby (6,313), unemployed people (1,140), retired people (6,626), students (4,705 in high school), children under school age, and people with disabilities and illnesses.\n\nStatement. To install this friction into Upplands V√§sby‚Äôs ordinary life is the best option to render it as a politically active urban environment. This project translates the tension between moving and staying into an urban form in which the confrontation and co-inhabitance of these two communities is fostered.\n\nDesign Strategy. 2.1. A series of adaptable, soft architectural elements allow similar dwelling units (6 x 6 x 4 height meters) to be suitable for different kinds of working and domestic lives. 2.2. All access points are generated through means of passing through a common covered garden space onto which domesticities and associative activities are expanded. Cultural sensitivities associated with the different displacements in the land, and possibilities for solidarity between people under different living conditions are likely to flourish in this environment of daily life encounters. Conflicts will also emerge as part of daily life and people will find opportunities to manage them in a space where the most immediate social interactions occur.\n\nIII. Parliament City as inter-species hub\n\nFacts. From an ecosystemical point of view, Upplands V√§sby can be considered an eco-tone in which the animal and plant communities at Lake Malare (23 breeding bird colonies) cohabitate with those of the Baltic Sea, the forest, arable land, permanent grassland, and the moraines. These communities have to negotiate their habitats with the growing presence of human ecosystems, mainly related to buildings, agriculture, and infrastructures.\n\nStatement. This project operates as a Parliament City that assumes the challenge of providing an inclusive contract between human and non-human communities.\n\nDesign Strategy. 3.1. As part of the built compound, the project incorporates interlocking spaces for the use of non-human living communities. These spaces will bring continuity to the surrounding ecosystems and will make it possible for the whole system to become an inter-species hub. 3.2. A number of facilities, including compost tanks and water filtering and purifying devices, are designed to create rich fertile environments in which existing species can get biological empowerment.\n\nUn-black-boxing process as metropolitan spectacle\n\nFacts. From energy production, to storage, to distribution and consumption, to the cycles of water use to material transformation to food to metabolic processes, the scenarios of exchange and transformation tend to remain unseen in contemporary, ordinary life, and therefore escape criticism.\n\nStatement. The production of awareness and the transparency of the implications of processes that construct daily life is needed if politically activated citizenship is intended to be promoted.\n\nDesign Strategy. 4.1. A series of open and self-explaining infrastructures are distributed at different points of Parliament City‚Äôs urban fabric. All of them have been designed to make visible and comprehensible the part of the processes that they represent. 4.2. The transparent infrastructural fragments have been designed so that they are also spaces where it is nice to spend time; they become equivalents of parks as social scenes for the political twenty-first century.\n\nUrban Queerness. Against neutrality as a condition for public space.\n\nFacts. A number of domestic activisms are the actual laboratories in which social reinvention happens. Effective public space is not one that avoids the presence of otherness and non-universally shared sensitivities and stances: radical ecologism, homes for LGBT activism and self-empowerment, anti-capitalist squats, self-managed elderly communities, Hare Krishna proselytism houses, Star Trek space communities.\n\nStatement. Considered a Parliament City, the project will host otherness and non-consensual stances as part of its facilities.\n\nDesign Strategy. 5.1. The covered gardens will be the place in which inhabitants gain togetherness on controversial options responding to hegemonic ways of life. 5.2. Curated facilities will be dedicated to this program and periodic discussion between neighbors and activists will be programmed."
