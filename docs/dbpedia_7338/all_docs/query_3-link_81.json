In assessing the significance of art as an asset, Those who purchase the world’s most expensive it is important to distinguish—where possible— art works are unlikely to make money on them, between art collectors and art investors. The key says Sergey Skaterschikov, of Skate’s Art Market difference lies in the value that each assigns a Research, but that does not matter to someone work of art. Whereas a collector may evaluate art who is only interested in the “emotional value” of based on its aesthetic qualities, emotional impact, the piece. or cultural significance—in other words, subjec- tive criteria—an investor will be more motivated These instances aside, the boundaries between by an artwork’s ability to retain, and increase, its collector and investor are not always clear.

Art: An Alternative Asset Class Art Market Metrics The unique characteristics of the art market make it difficult to analyse with traditional metrics. As most artworks are unique and their values are determined by a complex set of cultural, psychological, and economic factors, it is impossible to create a tradable art index. Despite these limitations, some companies have created models that attempt to provide a guide to trends in the art market. Skate’s Art Market Research, for example, has developed a proprietary Top 5000 ranking of the world’s top 5000 most valuable pieces of art based on auction prices (the current breakthrough point is $1.8 million). Sergey Skaterschikov describes it as a comprehensive peer group of the world’s masterpieces, designed to provide information and data for the art market that can be used as if it were a traditional stock or bond market. To ensure accuracy every piece of art is priced in US dollars, separated from its buyer premium, and adjusted for inflation. With each repeat sale of a work of art, an effective rate of return is calculated, which can be averaged across an artist’s portfolio to show which artists are seeing big increases in value. The company’s Art Stocks Index is a market capitalization weighted index that combines 11 publicly traded stocks of companies operating in the art business (eg. Sotheby’s, ArtNet). It is a useful gauge of the art market that closely tracks its biggest component, Sotheby’s, and has generally outperformed traditional equity mar- kets in the last five years. Beautiful Asset Advisors’ set of Mei Moses Fine Art Indices are also oft-quoted in the art market and media. The indices are developed using price information from more than 13,000 repeat sales at public auction, and a methodology that the owners describe as similar to Case-Schiller residential real estate index. At the same time, high transaction and maintenance costs, and low market liquidity ensure that art in- vesting is not without its risks. In particular, commission and taxes (including capital gains) charged on both buyers and sellers means that significant appreciation is required just to break even on the resale an art investment. These factors clearly make art investing unsuitable for those looking for short-term gains: Skate’s annual art market report for 2010 notes that collectors and investors who suffered the worst losses were generally forced to sell after a relatively short holding period. Skaterschikov says the market for non-investment grade art (typically produced by living artists and valued under $100,000) suffered heavily in the 2009 downturn after a boom in the preceding years. In December of that year, The Art Trading Fund, a London-based ‘hedge fund’ specializing in the lower-to-middle range of the market, shut down after just two and a half years in operation. Glob- ally, the number of art funds is estimated to have diminished from over 50 before the financial crisis to around 20 (exact numbers are unavailable). Contemporary art, especially from China, also suf- fered a backlash after a period of intense speculation and soaring prices, though some highly desir- able works in this market have remained extremely resilient. 14\n\n15.

Latin American Art Top Fairs for Latin American Art ART-BASEL (Miami) Art Basel Conversations | Art Collections | Collectors as Producers One of the leading art fairs in the world, Art Basel has become increasingly popular to view the work of Latin American artists, and is now considered a gateway between North and South in the Americas. Capitalizing on Miami’s large Hispanic population and rapidly-maturing art scene, the fair includes exhibitions from more than 250 galleries from all over the world, with special areas for performance and video art. The fair is held annually, in December. The 2010 event—the ninth so far—was attended by a large number of Latin American, and especially Brazilian, collectors, according to media reports. Shortly after the fair opened, Wilfredo Lam’s 1944 painting “Les Fiancés” sold for $3 million, a clear record for the Cuban artist (the previous record was set at auction just a month earlier). 28\n\n29. Latin American Art PINTA (New York, London) Pinta Fair 2010 – New York PINTA is an art fair dedicated to presenting the best modern and contemporary Latin American art. Launched in 2007, PINTA gathers around 50 exclusive galleries to showcase art from the region. An innovative feature to the fair is its museums acquisition program, which uses a system of matching funds to incentivize the purchase of works by museums and artistic institutions. This initiative, accord- ing to PINTA, is a significant step in the “unstoppable globalization of Latin American art”. According to Alejandro Zaia, one of the founders of the fair, the latest edition in New York (November 2010) was by far the most important and expansive so far. In a sign of PINTA’s growing appeal in the US, the 2010 fair was relocated to Pier 92, where the prestigious Armory Show is held, and was at- tended by more American than Latin American collectors. After a successful inaugural London-based PINTA fair in 2010, Zaia is optimistic that the 2011 event will capture even more interest, providing valuable exposure for Latin American artists in Europe. 29\n\n30. Latin American Art ZONAMACO (Mexico DF) Though much smaller than BASEL, the Mexican Contemporary Art Fair is now the biggest and most important art fair in Latin America. By dedicating a large proportion of space to emerging artists from the region, ZONAMACO is becoming an important launch pad for Latin American artists looking for greater exposure in the US and, to a lesser extent, Europe. This year’s ZONAMACO will run from April 6th to April 11th 2011 and will include more than 70 exhibitors from 10 nations. 30\n\n31. Latin American Art ArteBA (Buenos Aires) Not as globally significant as MACO, but Buenos Aires’ annual art fair is the longest running in the region, and focuses almost exclusively on art from Latin America. The emphasis of the five-day fair is to showing off the diverse work of local artists to the estimated 120,000 visitors rather than simply creating a place for collectors to pick up new pieces. A big, and popular, section of each edition, named ‘barrio joven’ (young neighborhood), is reserved for emerging talent. After using the bicentenary of several Latin American nations in 2010 as a way to promote the re- gion’s art history, 2011 will celebrate the fair’s 20th anniversary. 31\n\n32.

Latin American Art Skate’s Markets Rankings of Latin American Artists Ruffino Tamayo As the global art market increasingly tends to favor the more established and more liquid names, the market for Latin American art will continue to work towards new auction records for Rufino Tamayo, currently the world’s most valuable artist born in Latin America (Mexico) based on Skate’s Top5000 list of the world’s most valuable art. With over $22m in market cap, 5.47% in annualized ERR on repeat sales and #157 ranking among global artists, there is plenty of upside for Ruffino Tamayo market to expand in the coming years as Latin American elite increasingly recognizes the importance of Tamayo’s artistic legacy and his exceptional role as the price leader for Latin American art on the global scene Above: Ruffino Tamayo Amigo de los pájaros (friend of the birds) 1994 oil on canvas LA County Museum of Art 37\n\n38.

Add to that that they are by far the 2nd and 3rd most valuable artists of Latin Ameri- can origin (both are Mexican), and you have an exceptional equity story for both artists for many years to come. While Kahlo is generally considered to be the superior artist, and has become a cult figure, both artists will continue to generate price records for Latin American art in a near future. Above: Frida Kahlo Autorretrato con changuito (Self-Portrait with Small Monkey), 1945 © Collection Museo Dolores Olmedo, Xochimilco, México 38\n\n39. Latin American Art Roberto Matta, Fernando Botero and Wilfredo Lam For those global art investors looking for Latin American diversity (that is not Mexican and first-gener- ation American artists of Latin American origin) coupled with proven liquidity on significant price level (over $1m per artwork), there is no way to go other than to reach these three names: Matta, Botero and Lam. Roberto Matta is the world’s most valuable Chilean artist who is also ranked # 310 in Skate’s Top5000 ranking. Matta’s estate is represented by Pace Gallery in New York and this limits free float, transparency and number of market makers for Matta art that otherwise should have taken off much strongly supported by investors from one of the region’s most vibrant economies. Fernando Botero is not only Columbia’s most valuable artist in Skate’s Top5000, but he is also the most valuable Latin American living artist, a regional equivalent of Andy Warhol -- with $4.1m in market capitalization, Botero’s value in Skate’s Top5000 is just 1.3% of Richter’s value suggesting significant upside potential should the market clearly accept Botero as the region’s most valuable living artist. Finally, after Mario Carreño and Felix Gozalez-Torres, Wilfredo Lam is the third most valuable artist of Cuban origin in Skate’s Top5000 list and someone with perhaps the most interesting market develop- ment potential thanks to Chinese ancestors of Lam (his father emigrated to Cuba from China). Born in Cuba with Chinese and African blood in his veins, Lam lived for the first 21 years in Cuba and then moved to study in Europe where he became a truly international artist that kept faithful to his parents and motherland roots. This makes for a wonderful branding story and remaining the world’s most valu- able Cuban artist after Mario Carreño and Felix Gozalez-Torres, Wilfredo Lam is definitely the name to watch.

Resources More Latin Art Resources █ Galleries The undisputed global centers of modern and contemporary art are New York and London, which both have the essential elements of the art market: advisors, artists, auction houses, collectors, edu- cational institutions, museums and, of course, galleries. Berlin, Paris, Milan, Shanghai/Beijing/Hong Kong, and Zürich have many, but not all of these elements. The latter are gallery-centric cities. New York and Miami have significant concentrations of galleries that exhibit Latin American art, which can also been seen more selectively in London and Paris. The major Latin American cities all have galler- ies, of course, but none have yet emerged as “powerhouse” galleries on the global scene. █ Art Fairs There are now more than 200 hundred art fairs globally, the largest and most significant of which are Art Basel, Art Basel Miami Beach, Frieze (London), The Armory Show (New York). Several other fairs (for example, those in Brussels, Chicago, Cologne, Madrid, Shanghai, and Turin) routinely present selections of exceptional regional and international art. During the 2010/2011 art season, Art Basel Miami Beach and The Armory Show both offered special presentations of Latin American galleries and artists, highlighting the growing importance of Latin American art and its associated participants, collectors, galleries, and institutions alike. █ Auction Houses Among the major auction houses, Sotheby’s, Christie’s, Phillips de Pury, and Bonham’s all maintain representative offices in Latin America, yet none of them maintain exhibition spaces and auction floors in the major centers of the Latin American art market, including Miami. There are a handful of smaller auction houses in major Latin American cities, but the volume of works they offer is consider- ably less robust and the significance of the work is rivaled, if not surpassed, by the auction houses in New York and, to a lesser extent, London. 43"
