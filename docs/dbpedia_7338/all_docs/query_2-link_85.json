        "text": "Putative neuroprotective agents in neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nDodd, Seetal; Maes, Michael; Anderson, George; Dean, Olivia M; Moylan, Steven; Berk, Michael\n\n2013-04-05\n\nIn many individuals with major neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, their disease characteristics are consistent with a neuroprogressive illness. This includes progressive structural brain changes, cognitive and functional decline, poorer treatment response and an increasing vulnerability to relapse with chronicity. The underlying molecular mechanisms of neuroprogression are thought to include neurotrophins and regulation of neurogenesis and apoptosis, neurotransmitters, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cortisol and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and epigenetic influences. Knowledge of the involvement of each of these pathways implies that specific agents that act on some or multiple of these pathways may thus block this cascade and have neuroprotective properties. This paper reviews the potential of the most promising of these agents, including lithium and other known psychotropics, aspirin, minocycline, statins, N-acetylcysteine, leptin and melatonin. These agents are putative neuroprotective agents for schizophrenia and mood disorders. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nNeuroprotective \"agents\" in surgery. Secret \"agent\" man, or common \"agent\" machine?\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAndrews, R. J.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe search for clinically-effective neuroprotective agents has received enormous support in recent years--an estimated $200 million by pharmaceutical companies on clinical trials for traumatic brain injury alone. At the same time, the pathophysiology of brain injury has proved increasingly complex, rendering the likelihood of a single agent \"magic bullet\" even more remote. On the other hand, great progress continues with technology that makes surgery less invasive and less risky. One example is the application of endovascular techniques to treat coronary artery stenosis, where both the invasiveness of sternotomy and the significant neurological complication rate (due to microemboli showering the cerebral vasculature) can be eliminated. In this paper we review aspects of intraoperative neuroprotection both present and future. Explanations for the slow progress on pharmacologic neuroprotection during surgery are presented. Examples of technical advances that have had great impact on neuroprotection during surgery are given both from coronary artery stenosis surgery and from surgery for Parkinson's disease. To date, the progress in neuroprotection resulting from such technical advances is an order of magnitude greater than that resulting from pharmacologic agents used during surgery. The progress over the last 20 years in guidance during surgery (CT and MRI image-guidance) and in surgical access (endoscopic and endovascular techniques) will soon be complemented by advances in our ability to evaluate biological tissue intraoperatively in real-time. As an example of such technology, the NASA Smart Probe project is considered. In the long run (i.e., in 10 years or more), pharmacologic \"agents\" aimed at the complex pathophysiology of nervous system injury in man will be the key to true intraoperative neuroprotection. In the near term, however, it is more likely that mundane \"agents\" based on computers, microsensors, and microeffectors will be the major impetus to improved\n\nThe Promise of Neuroprotective Agents in Parkinsonâs Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeidl, Stacey E.; Potashkin, Judith A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nParkinsonâs disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Since there are limited treatment options for PD, neuroprotective agents are currently being tested as a means to slow disease progression. Agents targeting oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation are prime candidates for neuroprotection. This review identifies Rasagiline, Minocycline, and creatine, as the most promising neuroprotective agents for PD, and they are all currently in phase III trials. Other agents possessing protective characteristics in delaying PD include stimulants, vitamins, supplements, and other drugs. Additionally, combination therapies also show benefits in slowing PD progression. The identification of neuroprotective agents for PD provides us with therapeutic opportunities for modifying the course of disease progression and, perhaps, reducing the risk of onset when preclinical biomarkers become available. PMID:22125548\n\nCurcumin: a potential neuroprotective agent in Parkinson's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nMythri, R B; Bharath, M M Srinivas\n\n2012-01-01\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized as a movement disorder. The motor symptoms in PD arise due to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the ventral midbrain thereby depleting the dopamine levels in the striatum. Most of the current pharmacotherapeutic approaches in PD are aimed at replenishing the striatal dopamine. Although these drugs provide symptomatic relief during early PD, many patients develop motor complications with long-term treatment. Further, PD medications do not effectively tackle tremor, postural instability and cognitive deficits. Most importantly, most of these drugs do not exhibit neuroprotective effects in patients. Consequently, novel therapies involving natural antioxidants and plant products/molecules with neuroprotective properties are being exploited for adjunctive therapy. Curcumin is a polyphenol and an active component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), a dietary spice used in Indian cuisine and medicine. Curcumin exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is neuroprotective in neurological disorders. Several studies in different experimental models of PD strongly support the clinical application of curcumin in PD. The current review explores the therapeutic potential of curcumin in PD.\n\nTo what extent have functional studies of ischaemia in animals been useful in the assessment of potential neuroprotective agents?\n\nPubMed\n\nHunter, A J; Mackay, K B; Rogers, D C\n\n1998-02-01\n\nA general consensus is being reached on the use of a combination of mortality and functional end-points in clinical trials of neuroprotective agents. However, to date, few preclinical studies have examined the effects of putative neuroprotective agents on functional outcome after ischaemia. The data described in this review show the importance of combining both histopathological and neurobehavioural studies when evaluating the neuroprotective efficacy of anti-ischaemic agents in animal models of cerebral ischaemia. Here, Jackie Hunter, Ken Mackay and Derek Rogers argue that measures of functional improvement in models of ischaemia should be incorporated to characterize further the neuroprotection afforded by a compound that could aid the selection of doses and end-point measures in early clinical trials.\n\nÎ-aryl-N-alkyl nitrones, as potential agents for stroke treatment: synthesis, theoretical calculations, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and brain-blood barrier permeability properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nChioua, Mourad; Sucunza, David; Soriano, Elena; Hadjipavlou-Litina, Dimitra; AlcÃ¡zar, Alberto; Ayuso, Irene; Oset-Gasque, MarÃ­a JesÃºs; GonzÃ¡lez, MarÃ­a Pilar; Monjas, Leticia; RodrÃ­guez-Franco, MarÃ­a Isabel; Marco-Contelles, JosÃ©; Samadi, Abdelouahid\n\n2012-01-12\n\nWe report the synthesis, theoretical calculations, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of (Z)-Î±-aryl and heteroaryl-N-alkyl nitrones as potential agents for stroke treatment. The majority of nitrones compete with DMSO for hydroxyl radicals, and most of them are potent lipoxygenase inhibitors. Cell viability-related (MTT assay) studies clearly showed that nitrones 1-3 and 10 give rise to significant neuroprotection. When compounds 1-11 were tested for necrotic cell death (LDH release test) nitrones 1-3, 6, 7, and 9 proved to be neuroprotective agents. In vitro evaluation of the BBB penetration of selected nitrones 1, 2, 10, and 11 using the PAMPA-BBB assay showed that all of them cross the BBB. Permeable quinoline nitrones 2 and 3 show potent combined antioxidant and neuroprotective properties and, therefore, can be considered as new lead compounds for further development in specific tests for potential stroke treatment.\n\nWine Polyphenols: Potential Agents in Neuroprotection\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBasli, Abdelkader; Soulet, StÃ©phanie; Chaher, Nassima; MÃ©rillon, Jean-Michel; Chibane, Mohamed; Monti, Jean-Pierre; Richard, Tristan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThere are numerous studies indicating that a moderate consumption of red wine provides certain health benefits, such as the protection against neurodegenerative diseases. This protective effect is most likely due to the presence of phenolic compounds in wine. Wine polyphenolic compounds are well known for the antioxidant properties. Oxidative stress is involved in many forms of cellular and molecular deterioration. This damage can lead to cell death and various neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases. Extensive investigations have been undertaken to determine the neuroprotective effects of wine-related polyphenols. In this review we present the neuroprotective abilities of the major classes of wine-related polyphenols.

Neuroprotective agents can prevent and/or modify the course of neurological disorders. Despite being underestimated, riboflavin offers neuroprotective mechanisms. Significant pathogenesis-related mechanisms are shared by, but not restricted to, Parkinsonâs disease (PD) and migraine headache. Those pathogenesis-related mechanisms can be tackled through riboflavin proposed neuroprotective mechanisms. In fact, it has been found that riboflavin ameliorates oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and glutamate excitotoxicity; all of which take part in the pathogenesis of PD, migraine headache, and other neurological disorders. In addition, riboflavin-dependent enzymes have essential roles in pyridoxine activation, tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, and homocysteine metabolism. Indeed, pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of pyridoxine, has been found to have independent neuroprotective potential. Also, the produced kynurenines influence glutamate receptors and its consequent excitotoxicity. In addition, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase requires riboflavin to ensure normal folate cycle influencing the methylation cycle and consequently homocysteine levels which have its own negative neurovascular consequences if accumulated. In conclusion, riboflavin is a potential neuroprotective agent affecting a wide range of neurological disorders exemplified by PD, a disorder of neurodegeneration, and migraine headache, a disorder of pain. In this article, we will emphasize the role of riboflavin in neuroprotection elaborating on its proposed neuroprotective mechanisms in opposite to the pathogenesis-related mechanisms involved in two common neurological disorders, PD and migraine headache, as well as, we encourage the clinical evaluation of riboflavin in PD and migraine headache patients\n\nNeuroprotective and Cognitive Enhancement Potentials of Baicalin: A Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSowndhararajan, Kandhasamy; Deepa, Ponnuvel; Kim, Minju; Park, Se Jin; Kim, Songmun\n\n2018-06-11\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by the gradual loss of neurons. The development of effective neuroprotective agents to prevent and control neurodegenerative diseases is specifically important. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in selecting flavonoid compounds as potential neuroprotective agents, owing to their high effectiveness with low side effects. Baicalin is one of the important flavonoid compounds, which is mainly isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (an important Chinese medicinal herb). In recent years, a number of studies have shown that baicalin has a potent neuroprotective effect in various in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal injury. In particular, baicalin effectively prevents neurodegenerative diseases through various pharmacological mechanisms, including antioxidative stress, anti-excitotoxicity, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, stimulating neurogenesis, promoting the expression of neuronal protective factors, etc. This review mainly focuses on the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancement effects of baicalin. The aim of the present review is to compile all information in relation to the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancement effects of baicalin and its molecular mechanisms of action in various in vitro and in vivo experimental models.\n\nThe therapeutic potential of the cannabinoids in neuroprotection.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrundy, Robert I\n\n2002-10-01\n\nAfter thousands of years of interest the last few decades have seen a huge increase in our knowledge of the cannabinoids and their mode of action. Their potential as medical therapeutics has long been known. However, very real concerns over their safety and efficacy have lead to caution and suspicion when applying the legislature of modern medicine to these compounds. The ability of this diverse family of compounds to modulate neurotransmission and act as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agents has prompted researchers to investigate their potential as neuroprotective agents. Indeed, various cannabinoids rescue dying neurones in experimental forms of acute neuronal injury, such as cerebral ischaemia and traumatic brain injury. Cannabinoids also provide symptomatic relief in experimental models of chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease. This preclinical evidence has provided the impetus for the launch of a number of clinical trials in various conditions of neurodegeneration and neuronal injury using compounds derived from the cannabis plant. Our understanding of cannabinoid neurobiology, however, must improve if we are to effectively exploit this system and take advantage of the numerous characteristics that make this group of compounds potential neuroprotective agents.\n\nNeuroprotective Effects of Galantamine on Nerve Agent-Induced Neuroglial and Biochemical Changes.\n\nPubMed\n\nGolime, RamaRao; Palit, Meehir; Acharya, J; Dubey, D K\n\n2018-05-01\n\nNeuroprotection from nerve agent such as soman-induced neural damage is a major challenge for existing drugs. Nerve agent exposure can cause many neural effects in survivors arising mainly due to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition or death within minutes. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying the nerve agent-induced multiple neurological effects is useful to develop better and safe drugs. The present study aimed to understand the molecular response during soman exposure and to evaluate the neuroprotective efficacy of galantamine on nerve agent-induced neurotoxic changes. mRNA expression studies using quantitative real-time PCR revealed significant changes in S-100Î², Gfap, c-fos, and Bdnf in the hippocampus and piriform cortex after soman (90Â Î¼g/kg, s.c) exposure. Immunoblot analysis showed acute soman exposure significantly increased the protein levels of neuroglial markers (S100-Î² and GFAP); c-Fos and protein oxidation in discrete rat brain areas indicate their role in nerve agent-induced neurotoxicity. Induction of BDNF levels during soman exposure may indicate the recovery mechanisms activation. AChE was inhibited in the blood and brain up to 82% after soman exposure. Antidotal treatment with galantamine alone (3Â mg/kg) and galantamine plus atropine (10Â mg/kg) has protected animals from nerve agent-induced intoxication, death, and soman-inhibited AChE up to 45% in the blood and brain. Animal received galantamine displayed increased levels of neuroprotective genes (nAChRÎ±-7, Bcl-2, and Bdnf) in the brain suggest the neuroprotective value of galantamine. Neuroglial changes, c-Fos, and protein oxidation levels significantly reduced after galantamine and galantamine plus atropine treatment indicate their potential antidotal value in nerve agent treatment.\n\nArgon gas: a potential neuroprotectant and promising medical therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nArgon is a noble gas element that has demonstrated narcotic and protective abilities that may prove useful in the medical field. The earliest records of argon gas have exposed its ability to exhibit narcotic symptoms at hyperbaric pressures greater than 10 atmospheres with more recent evidence seeking to display argon as a potential neuroprotective agent. The high availability and low cost of argon provide a distinct advantage over using similarly acting treatments such as xenon gas. Argon gas treatments in models of brain injury such as in vitro Oxygen-Glucose-Deprivation (OGD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), as well as in vivo Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) have largely demonstrated positive neuroprotective behavior. On the other hand, some warning has been made to potential negative effects of argon treatments in cases of ischemic brain injury, where increases of damage in the sub-cortical region of the brain have been uncovered. Further support for argon use in the medical field has been demonstrated in its use in combination with tPA, its ability as an organoprotectant, and its surgical applications. This review seeks to summarize the history and development of argon gas use in medical research as mainly a neuroprotective agent, to summarize the mechanisms associated with its biological effects, and to elucidate its future potential.

Lidocaine has been tested in patients for its potential protective effect on postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This mini-review summarizes the laboratory and clinical evidences and discusses its clinical applications as neuroprotective agent. PMID:27186318\n\nNitric Oxide Donors as Neuroprotective Agents after an Ischemic Stroke-Related Inflammatory Reaction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRojas-MayorquÃ­n, Argelia E.; OrtuÃ±o-SahagÃºn, Daniel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCerebral ischemia initiates a cascade of detrimental events including glutamate-associated excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium accumulation, formation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane lipid degradation, and DNA damage, which lead to the disruption of cellular homeostasis and structural damage of ischemic brain tissue. Cerebral ischemia also triggers acute inflammation, which exacerbates primary brain damage. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress (OS) and downregulating the inflammatory response are options that merit consideration as potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke. Consequently, agents capable of modulating both elements will constitute promising therapeutic solutions because clinically effective neuroprotectants have not yet been discovered and no specific therapy for stroke is available to date. Because of their ability to modulate both oxidative stress and the inflammatory response, much attention has been focused on the role of nitric oxide donors (NOD) as neuroprotective agents in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Given their short therapeutic window, NOD appears to be appropriate for use during neurosurgical procedures involving transient arterial occlusions, or in very early treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and also possibly as complementary treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson or Alzheimer, where oxidative stress is an important promoter of damage. In the present paper, we focus on the role of NOD as possible neuroprotective therapeutic agents for ischemia/reperfusion treatment. PMID:23691263\n\nAstaxanthin as a Potential Neuroprotective Agent for Neurological Diseases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWu, Haijian; Niu, Huanjiang; Shao, Anwen; Wu, Cheng; Dixon, Brandon J.; Zhang, Jianmin; Yang, Shuxu; Wang, Yirong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNeurological diseases, which consist of acute injuries and chronic neurodegeneration, are the leading causes of human death and disability. However, the pathophysiology of these diseases have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatments are still lacking. Astaxanthin, a member of the xanthophyll group, is a red-orange carotenoid with unique cell membrane actions and diverse biological activities. More importantly, there is evidence demonstrating that astaxanthin confers neuroprotective effects in experimental models of acute injuries, chronic neurodegenerative disorders, and neurological diseases. The beneficial effects of astaxanthin are linked to its oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic characteristics. In this review, we will focus on the neuroprotective properties of astaxanthin and explore the underlying mechanisms in the setting of neurological diseases. PMID:26378548\n\nNeuroprotective potential of high-dose biotin.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCarty, Mark F; DiNicolantonio, James J\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA recent controlled trial has established that high-dose biotin supplementation - 100â¯mg, three times daily - has a stabilizing effect on progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although this effect has been attributed to an optimization of biotin's essential cofactor role in the brain, a case can be made that direct stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by pharmacological concentrations of biotin plays a key role in this regard. The utility of high-dose biotin in MS might reflect an anti-inflammatory effect of cGMP on the cerebral microvasculature, as well on oligodendrocyte differentiation and on Schwann cell production of neurotrophic factors thought to have potential for managing MS. But biotin's ability to boost cGMP synthesis in the brain may have broader neuroprotective potential. In many types of neurons and neural cells, cGMP exerts neurotrophic-mimetic effects - entailing activation of the PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK pathways - that promote neuron survival and plasticity. Hippocampal long term potentiation requires nitric oxide synthesis, which in turn promotes an activating phosphorylation of CREB via a pathway involving cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid beta suppresses this mechanism by inhibiting sGC activity; agents which exert a countervailing effect by boosting cGMP levels tend to restore effective long-term potentiation in rodent models of AD. Moreover, NO/cGMP suppresses amyloid beta production within the brain by inhibiting expression of amyloid precursor protein and BACE1. In conjunction with cGMP's ability to oppose neuron apoptosis, these effects suggest that high-dose biotin might have potential for the prevention and management of AD. cGMP also promotes neurogenesis, and may lessen stroke risk by impeding atherogenesis and hypertrophic remodeling in the cerebral vasculature. The neuroprotective potential of high-dose biotin likely could be boosted by concurrent administration of brain\n\nTherapeutic neuroprotective agents for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPandya, Rachna S.; Zhu, Haining; Li, Wei; Bowser, Robert; Friedlander, Robert M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal chronic neurodegenerative disease whose hallmark is proteinaceous, ubiquitinated, cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons and surrounding cells. Multiple mechanisms proposed as responsible for ALS pathogenesis include dysfunction of protein degradation, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. It is therefore essential to gain a better understanding of the underlying disease etiology and search for neuroprotective agents that might delay disease onset, slow progression, prolong survival, and ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Because riluzole, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment, prolongs the ALS patientâs life by only 3 months, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. In this review, we focus on studies of various small pharmacological compounds targeting the proposed pathogenic mechanisms of ALS and discuss their impact on disease progression. PMID:23864030\n\nPsychopharmacological neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease: assessing the preclinical data.\n\nPubMed\n\nLauterbach, Edward C; Victoroff, Jeff; Coburn, Kerry L; Shillcutt, Samuel D; Doonan, Suzanne M; Mendez, Mario F\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis manuscript reviews the preclinical in vitro, ex vivo, and nonhuman in vivo effects of psychopharmacological agents in clinical use on cell physiology with a view toward identifying agents with neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative disease. These agents are routinely used in the symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Each agent is reviewed in terms of its effects on pathogenic proteins, proteasomal function, mitochondrial viability, mitochondrial function and metabolism, mitochondrial permeability transition pore development, cellular viability, and apoptosis. Effects on the metabolism of the neurodegenerative disease pathogenic proteins alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau, including tau phosphorylation, are particularly addressed, with application to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Limitations of the current data are detailed and predictive criteria for translational clinical neuroprotection are proposed and discussed. Drugs that warrant further study for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease include pramipexole, thioridazine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, lithium, valproate, desipramine, maprotiline, fluoxetine, buspirone, clonazepam, diphenhydramine, and melatonin. Those with multiple neuroprotective mechanisms include pramipexole, thioridazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, lithium, valproate, desipramine, maprotiline, clonazepam, and melatonin. Those best viewed circumspectly in neurodegenerative disease until clinical disease course outcomes data become available, include several antipsychotics, lithium, oxcarbazepine, valproate, several tricyclic antidepressants, certain SSRIs, diazepam, and possibly diphenhydramine. A search for clinical studies of neuroprotection revealed only a single study demonstrating putatively positive results for ropinirole. An agenda for research on potentially neuroprotective agent is provided.\n\nDesign, synthesis and biological evaluation of LX2343 derivatives as neuroprotective agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Guanglong; Wang, Junwei; Guo, Xiaodan; Lei, Min; Zhang, Yinan; Wang, Xiachang; Shen, Xu; Hu, Lihong\n\n2018-02-10\n\nA series of LX2343 derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as neuroprotective agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) inÂ vitro. Most of the compounds displayed potent neuroprotective activities. Especially for compound A6, exhibited a remarkable EC 50 value of 0.22â¯Î¼M. Further investigation demonstrated that compound A6 can significantly reduce AÎ² production and increase AÎ² clearance, and alleviate Tau hyperphosphorylation. Most importantly, compound A6 could ameliorate learning and memory impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The present study evidently showed that compound A6 is a potent neuroprotective agent and might serve as a promising lead candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Based on accumulated knowledge of the neurodegenerative and neuroprotective processes that occur in motoneurons after root avulsion, we built up protein networks and converted them into mathematical models. Unbiased proteomic data from our preclinical models were used for machine learning algorithms and for restrictions to be imposed on mathematical solutions. Solutions allowed us to identify combinations of repurposed drugs as potential neuroprotective agents and we validated them in our preclinical models. The best one, NeuroHeal, neuroprotected motoneurons, exerted anti-inflammatory properties and promoted functional locomotor recovery. NeuroHeal endorsed the activation of Sirtuin 1, which was essential for its neuroprotective effect. These results support the value of network-centric approaches for drug discovery and demonstrate the efficacy of NeuroHeal as adjuvant treatment with surgical repair for nervous system trauma.\n\nThe Neuroprotective Disease-Modifying Potential of Psychotropics in Parkinson's Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLauterbach, Edward C.; Fontenelle, Leonardo F.; Teixeira, Antonio L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNeuroprotective treatments in Parkinson's disease (PD) have remained elusive. Psychotropics are commonly prescribed in PD without regard to their pathobiological effects. The authors investigated the effects of psychotropics on pathobiological proteins, proteasomal activity, mitochondrial functions, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, trophic factors, stem cells, and neurogenesis. Only findings replicated in at least 2 studies were considered for these actions. Additionally, PD-related gene transcription, animal model, and human neuroprotective clinical trial data were reviewed. Results indicate that, from a PD pathobiology perspective, the safest drugs (i.e., drugs least likely to promote cellular neurodegenerative mechanisms balanced against their likelihood of promoting neuroprotective mechanisms) include pramipexole, valproate, lithium, desipramine, escitalopram, and dextromethorphan. Fluoxetine favorably affects transcription of multiple genes (e.g., MAPT, GBA, CCDC62, HIP1R), although it and desipramine reduced MPTP mouse survival. Haloperidol is best avoided. The most promising neuroprotective investigative priorities will involve disease-modifying trials of the safest agents alone or in combination to capture salutary effects on H3 histone deacetylase, gene transcription, glycogen synthase kinase-3, Î±-synuclein, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), apoptosis, inflammation, and trophic factors including GDNF and BDNF.

L-theanine has been historically reported as a relaxing agent, prompting scientific research on its pharmacology. Animal neurochemistry studies suggest that L-theanine increases brain serotonin, dopamine, GABA levels and has micromolar affinities for AMPA, Kainate and NMDA receptors. In addition has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models possibly through its antagonistic effects on group 1 metabotrophic glutamate receptors. Behavioural studies in animals suggest improvement in learning and memory. Overall, L-theanine displays a neuropharmacology suggestive of a possible neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing agent and warrants further investigation in animals and humans.\n\nNeuroprotective role of Agmatine in Neurological Diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Weilin; Gao, Liansheng; Li, Tao; Shao, Anwen; Zhang, Jianmin\n\n2017-08-08\n\nNeurological diseases have always been one of the leading cause of mobility and mortality world-widely. However, it is still lack of efficient agents. Agmatine, an endogenous polyamine, exerts its diverse biological characteristics and therapeutic potential in varied aspects. Moreover, there has been numerous studies demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of agmatine in varied types of neurological diseases, including acute attack (stroke and trauma brain injury) and chronic neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease). The potential mechanism of agmatine -induced neuroprotection includes anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, brain blood barrier (BBB) protection and brain edema prevention. In this review, we will introduce the neuroprotective effects of agmatine and the underlying mechanisms in the setting of neurological diseases.

Dantrolene, an inhibitor of the ryanodine receptor, inhibits intracellular calcium release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum and might serve as novel agent for neuroprotection and other applications in the Neurointensive Care Unit. Methods We reviewed the available data of dantrolene as a potential neuroprotective agent through literature searches on Ovid, Pubmed and Google Scholar. Results Dantrolene provides neuroprotection in multiple in vitro models and some in vivo models of neural injury. Its efficacy has an early and narrow time-window of protection. We briefly summarize its other pharmacologic effects that may have potential applications for patients in the neurointensive care unit. Areas with the need for continued research are identified. Conclusion Targeted use of dantrolene in selected ICU disease models of anticipated neural injury, such as impending ischemia from vasospastic syndromes, might provided neuroprotection.

The number of regenerating neurites was counted after 7 days of culture, followed by performing TUNEL and DAPI staining. The ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to the number of DAPI-stained nuclei was calculated. Immunohistochemical examinations for the active form of caspase-9 and JNK were performed. All of the neuroprotectants increased the number of neurites and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells. However, the number of neurites was significantly higher, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-9- and JNK-immunopositive cells was fewer in the retinas incubated with the combined three agents. Combination solutions containing citicoline, TUDCA, and NT-4 should be considered for neuroprotective and regenerative therapy for AGE-related retinal degeneration.

Using CMZ as a lead compound, neuroprotective methiazole (MZ) analogues were developed, and neuroprotection and GABAA receptor dependence were studied. Experimental Approach:âEight MZs were selected from a novel library, of which two were studied in detail. Neuroprotection, glutamate release, intracellular calcium and response to GABA blockade by picrotoxin were measured in rat primary cortical cultures using four cellular models of neurodegeneration. GABA potentiation was assayed in oocytes expressing the Î±1Î²2Î³2 GABAA receptor. Key Results:âNeuroprotection against a range of insults was retained even with substantial chemical modification. Dependence on GABAA receptor activity was variable: at the extremes, neuroprotection by GN-28 was universally sensitive to picrotoxin, while GN-38 was largely insensitive. In parallel, effects on extracellular glutamate and intracellular calcium were associated with GABAA dependence. Consistent with these findings, GN-28 potentiated Î±1Î²2Î³2 GABAA function, whereas GN-38 had a weak inhibitory effect. Neuroprotection against moderate dose oligomeric AÎ²1â42 was also tolerant to structural changes. Conclusions and Implications:âThe results support the concept that CMZ does not contain a single pharmacophore, rather that broad-spectrum neuroprotection results from a GABAA-dependent mechanism represented by GN-28, combined with a mechanism represented in GN-38 that shows the least dependence on GABAA receptors. These findings allow further refinement of the neuroprotective pharmacophore and investigation into secondary mechanisms that will assist in identifying MZ-based compounds of use in treating neurodegeneration.

With the advent of hypothermia as therapy for term hypoxicâischemic encephalopathy, there is hope for repair and protection of the brain after a profound neonatal insult. However, it is clear from the published clinical trials and animal studies that hypothermia alone will not provide complete protection or stimulate the repair that is necessary for normal neurodevelopmental outcome. This review critically discusses drugs used to treat seizures after hypoxiaâischemia in the neonate with attention to evidence of possible synergies for therapy. In addition, other agents such as xenon, N-acetylcysteine, erythropoietin, melatonin and cannabinoids are discussed as future potential therapeutic agents that might augment protection from hypothermia. Finally, compounds that might damage the developing brain or counteract the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia are discussed. PMID:20207600\n\nNeuroprotection and neurotoxicity in the developing brain: an update on the effects of dexmedetomidine and xenon.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlam, Azeem; Suen, Ka Chun; Hana, Zac; Sanders, Robert D; Maze, Mervyn; Ma, Daqing\n\nGrowing and consistent preclinical evidence, combined with early clinical epidemiological observations, suggest potentially neurotoxic effects of commonly used anesthetic agents in the developing brain. This has prompted the FDA to issue a safety warning for all sedatives and anesthetics approved for use in children under three years of age. Recent studies have identified dexmedetomidine, the potent Î±2-adrenoceptor agonist, and xenon, the noble gas, as effective anesthetic adjuvants that are both less neurotoxic to the developing brain, and also possess neuroprotective properties in neonatal and other settings of acute ongoing neurologic injury. Dexmedetomidine and xenon are effective anesthetic adjuvants that appear to be less neurotoxic than other existing agents and have the potential to be neuroprotective in the neonatal and pediatric settings. Although results from recent clinical trials and case reports have indicated the neuroprotective potential of xenon and dexmedetomidine, additional randomized clinical trials corroborating these studies are necessary. By reviewing both the existing preclinical and clinical evidence on the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine and xenon, we hope to provide insight into the potential clinical efficacy of these agents in the management of pediatric surgical patients.

Compounds 7, 8 and 11 showed a significant neuroprotective effect on neuroblastoma cells subjected to Ca(2+) overload or free radical induced toxicity. These compounds are modest AChE inhibitors [the best inhibitor (11) is 50-fold less potent than tacrine], but proved to be very selective, as for most of them no BuChE inhibition was observed. In addition, the propidium displacement experiments showed that these compounds bind AChE to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE and, consequently, are potential agents that can prevent the aggregation of beta-amyloid. Overall, compound 8 is a modest and selective AChE inhibitor, but an efficient neuroprotective agent against 70mM K(+) and 60microM H(2)O(2). Based on these results, some of these molecules can be considered as lead candidates for the further development of anti-Alzheimer drugs.\n\nSmall Molecule Anticonvulsant Agents with Potent In Vitro Neuroprotection\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, Garry R.; Zhang, Yan; Du, Yanming; Kondaveeti, Sandeep K.; Zdilla, Michael J.; Reitz, Allen B.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSevere seizure activity is associated with recurring cycles of excitotoxicity and oxidative stress that result in progressive neuronal damage and death. Intervention to halt these pathological processes is a compelling disease-modifying strategy for the treatment of seizure disorders. In the present study, a core small molecule with anticonvulsant activity has been structurally optimized for neuroprotection. Phenotypic screening of rat hippocampal cultures with nutrient medium depleted of antioxidants was utilized as a disease model. Increased cell death and decreased neuronal viability produced by acute treatment with glutamate or hydrogen peroxide were prevented by our novel molecules. The neuroprotection associated with this chemical series has marked structure activity relationships that focus on modification of the benzylic position of a 2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl sulfamide core structure. Complete separation between anticonvulsant activity and neuroprotective action was dependent on substitution at the benzylic carbon. Chiral selectivity was evident in that the S-enantiomer of the benzylic hydroxy group had neither neuroprotective nor anticonvulsant activity, while the R-enantiomer of the lead compound had full neuroprotective action at â¤40 nM and antiseizure activity in three animal models. These studies indicate that potent, multifunctional neuroprotective anticonvulsants are feasible within a single molecular entity. PMID:22535312\n\nBy improving regional cortical blood flow, attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and sequential apoptosis galangin acts as a potential neuroprotective agent after acute ischemic stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Shaojing; Wu, Chuanhong; Zhu, Li; Gao, Jian; Fang, Jing; Li, Defeng; Fu, Meihong; Liang, Rixin; Wang, Lan; Cheng, Ming; Yang, Hongjun\n\n2012-11-09\n\nIschemic stroke is a devastating disease with a complex pathophysiology. Galangin is a natural flavonoid isolated from the rhizome of Alpina officinarum Hance, which has been widely used as an antioxidant agent. However, its effects against ischemic stroke have not been reported and its related neuroprotective mechanism has not really been explored. In this study, neurological behavior, cerebral infarct volumes and the improvement of the regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of galangin in rats impaired by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced focal cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, the determination of mitochondrial function and Western blot of apoptosis-related proteins were performed to interpret the neuroprotective mechanism of galangin. The results showed that galangin alleviated the neurologic impairments, reduced cerebral infarct at 24 h after MCAO and exerted a protective effect on the mitochondria with decreased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). These effects were consistent with improvements in the membrane potential level (Dym), membrane fluidity, and degree of mitochondrial swelling in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, galangin significantly improved the reduced rCBF after MCAO. Western blot analysis revealed that galangin also inhibited apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner concomitant with the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, down-regulation of Bax expression and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, a reduction in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, the reduced expression of activated caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). All these data in this study demonstrated that galangin might have therapeutic potential for ischemic stroke and play its protective role through the improvement in rCBF, mitochondrial protection and inhibiting caspase-dependent mitochondrial cell death pathway for the first time.\n\nNeuroprotective and Anti-Aging Potentials of Essential Oils from Aromatic and Medicinal Plants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAyaz, Muhammad; Sadiq, Abdul; Junaid, Muhammad; Ullah, Farhat; Subhan, Fazal; Ahmed, Jawad\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe use of essential oils (EOs) and their components is known since long in traditional medicine and aromatherapy for the management of various diseases, and is further increased in the recent times. The neuroprotective and anti-aging potentials of EOs and their possible mechanism of actions were evaluated by numerous researchers around the globe. Several clinically important EOs and their components from Nigella sativa, Acorus gramineus, Lavandula angustifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Jasminum sambac, Piper nigrum and so many other plants are reported for neuroprotective effects. This review article was aimed to summarize the current finding on EOs tested against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia. The effects of EOs on pathological targets of AD and dementia including amyloid deposition (AÎ²), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic hypofunction, oxidative stress and glutamatergic abnormalities were focused. Furthermore, effects of EOs on other neurological disorders including anxiety, depression, cognitive hypofunction epilepsy and convulsions were also evaluated in detail. In conclusion, EOs were effective on several pathological targets and have improved cognitive performance in animal models and human subjects. Thus, EOs can be developed as multi-potent agents against neurological disorders with better efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness. PMID:28611658\n\nTopiramate as a neuroprotective agent in a rat model of spinal cord injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nNarin, Firat; Hanalioglu, Sahin; Ustun, Huseyin; Kilinc, Kamer; Bilginer, Burcak\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTopiramate (TPM) is a widely used antiepileptic and antimigraine agent which has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in various experimental traumatic brain injury and stroke models. However, its utility in spinal cord injury has not been studied extensively. Thus, we evaluated effects of TPM on secondary cellular injury mechanisms in an experimental rat model of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). After rat models of thoracic contusive SCI were established by free weight-drop method, TPM (40 mg/kg) was given at 12-hour intervals for four times orally. Post TPM treatment, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were significantly reduced and reduced glutathione levels were increased, while immunoreactivity for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 was diminished in SCI rats. In addition, TPM treatment improved the functional recovery of SCI rats. This study suggests that administration of TPM exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI.\n\nEvaluation of nicotine and cotinine analogs as potential neuroprotective agents for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Jie; Adam, Bao-Ling; Terry, Alvin V\n\n2014-03-15\n\nThe currently available therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related forms of dementia are limited by modest efficacy, adverse side effects, and the fact that they do not prevent the relentless progression of the illness. The purpose of the studies described here was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the nicotine metabolite cotinine as well as a small series of cotinine and nicotine analogs (including stereoisomers) and to compare their effects to the four clinically prescribed AD therapies.

Cultured L-MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence through the use of specific MSC marker antibodies. Conditioned media were collected from normoxia- and hypoxia-treated L-MSCs to assess neurotrophic effects. Neuroprotective potentials were evaluated through the use of in vitro hypoxic cortical neuron culture and in vivo rat focal cerebral ischemia models. Neuronal morphology was confirmed by immunofluorescence with the use of anti-MAP2 antibody. Post-ischemic infarct volume and motor behavior were assayed by means of triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and open-field testing, respectively. Human growth antibody arrays and enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to analyze trophic/growth factors contained in conditioned media. Isolated human L-MSCs highly expressed CD29, CD90 and CD105 but not CD34 and CD45. Mesenchymal lineage cell surface expression pattern and differentiation capacity were identical to MSCs derived form human bone marrow and adipose tissue. The L-MSC normoxic and hypoxic conditioned media both promoted neurite outgrowth in cultured cortical neurons. Hypoxic conditioned medium showed superior neurotrophic function and neuroprotective potential with reduced ischemic brain injury and improved functional recovery in rat focal cerebral ischemia models. Human growth factor arrays and enzyme-linked immunoassays measurements showed neuroprotective and growth-associated cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], VEGFR3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor -2 and hepatocyte growth factor) contained in conditioned media. Hypoxic exposure caused VEGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor upregulation, possibly contributing to neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. L-MSCs can secrete various neurotrophic factors\n\nFuroxans (1,2,5-Oxadiazole-N-Oxides) as Novel NO Mimetic Neuroprotective and Procognitive Agents\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchiefer, Isaac T.; VandeVrede, Lawren; Fa\n\n2012-08-31\n\nFuroxans (1,2,5-oxadiazole-N-oxides) are thiol-bioactivated NO-mimetics that have not hitherto been studied in the CNS. Incorporation of varied substituents adjacent to the furoxan ring system led to modulation of reactivity toward bioactivation, studied by HPLC-MS/MS analysis of reaction products. Attenuated reactivity unmasked the cytoprotective actions of NO in contrast to the cytotoxic actions of higher NO fluxes reported previously for furoxans. Neuroprotection was observed in primary neuronal cell cultures following oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Neuroprotective activity was observed to correlate with thiol-dependent bioactivation to produce NO{sub 2}{sup -}, but not with depletion of free thiol itself. Neuroprotection was abrogated upon cotreatmentmoreÂ Â» with a sGC inhibitor, ODQ, thus supporting activation of the NO/sGC/CREB signaling cascade by furoxans. Long-term potentiation (LTP), essential for learning and memory, has been shown to be potentiated by NO signaling, therefore, a peptidomimetic furoxan was tested in hippocampal slices treated with oligomeric amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}) and was shown to restore synaptic function. The novel observation of furoxan activity of potential therapeutic use in the CNS warrants further studies.Â«Â less\n\nBalancing paediatric anaesthesia: preclinical insights into analgesia, hypnosis, neuroprotection, and neurotoxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, R D; Ma, D; Brooks, P; Maze, M\n\n2008-11-01\n\nLogistical and ethical reasons make conducting clinical research in paediatric practice difficult, and therefore safe and efficacious advances are dependent on good preclinical research. For example, notable advances have been made in preclinical studies of pain processing that correlate well with patient data. Other areas of paediatric anaesthetic research remain in their infancy including mechanisms of anaesthesia and anaesthetic neuroprotection and neurotoxicity. Animal data have identified the potential 'double-edged' sword of administering anaesthetic agents in the young; although these agents can be neuroprotective in certain circumstances, they can be neurotoxic in others. The potential for this toxicity must be balanced against the importance of providing adequate anaesthesia for which there can be no compromise. We review the current state of preclinical research in paediatric anaesthesia and identify areas which require further exploration in order to provide the foundations for well-conducted clinical trials.\n\nFerulic acid-carbazole hybrid compounds: Combination of cholinesterase inhibition, antioxidant and neuroprotection as multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents.\n\nPubMed\n\nFang, Lei; Chen, Mohao; Liu, Zhikun; Fang, Xubin; Gou, Shaohua; Chen, Li\n\n2016-02-15\n\nIn order to search for novel multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents, a series of ferulic acid-carbazole hybrid compounds were designed and synthesized. Ellman's assay revealed that the hybrid compounds showed moderate to potent inhibitory activity against the cholinesterases. Particularly, the AChE inhibition potency of compound 5k (IC50 1.9Î¼M) was even 5-fold higher than that of galantamine. In addition, the target compounds showed pronounced antioxidant ability and neuroprotective property, especially against the ROS-induced toxicity. Notably, the neuroprotective effect of 5k was obviously superior to that of the mixture of ferulic acid and carbazole, indicating the therapeutic effect of the hybrid compound is better than the combination administration of the corresponding mixture.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an inflammogen derived from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, which promotes neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone have been reported as neuroprotective steroids useful for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, several 16-arylidene steroidal derivatives have been evaluated as neuroprotective agents in LPS-treated animal models. It was observed that 16-arylidene steroidal derivatives 1a-d and 6a-h considerably improve LPS-induced learning, memory, and movement deficits in animal models. Biochemical estimations of brain serum of treated animals revealed suppression of oxidative and nitrosative stress, acetylcholinesterase activity, and reduction in TNF-Î± levels, which were induced through LPS mediated neuroinflammatory mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration of brain. Of all the steroidal derivatives, 16-(4-pyridylidene) steroid 1c and its 4-aza analogue 6c were found to be the most active neuroprotective agents and produced effects comparable to standard drug celecoxib at a much lower dose and better than dexamethasone at the same dose in terms of behavioral, biochemical, and molecular aspects.\n\nNeuroprotective, neurotherapeutic, and neurometabolic effects of carbon monoxide.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahan, Vicki L\n\n2012-12-27\n\nStudies in animal models show that the primary mechanism by which heme-oxygenases impart beneficial effects is due to the gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO). Produced in humans mainly by the catabolism of heme by heme-oxygenase, CO is a neurotransmitter important for multiple neurologic functions and affects several intracellular pathways as a regulatory molecule. Exogenous administration of inhaled CO or carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORM's) impart similar neurophysiological responses as the endogenous gas. Its' involvement in important neuronal functions suggests that regulation of CO synthesis and biochemical properties may be clinically relevant to neuroprotection and the key may be a change in metabolic substrate from glucose to lactate. Currently, the drug is under development as a therapeutic agent and safety studies in humans evaluating the safety and tolerability of inhaled doses of CO show no clinically important abnormalities, effects, or changes over time in laboratory safety variables. As an important therapeutic option, inhaled CO has entered clinical trials and its clinical role as a neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic agent has been suggested. In this article, we review the neuroprotective effects of endogenous CO and discuss exogenous CO as a neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic agent.\n\nVoltage-gated K+ channel modulators as neuroprotective agents.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeung, Yuk-Man\n\n2010-05-22\n\nA manifestation in neurodegeneration is apoptosis of neurons. Neurons undergoing apoptosis may lose a substantial amount of cytosolic K+ through a number of pathways including K+ efflux via voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels. The consequent drop in cytosolic [K+] relieves inhibition of an array of pro-apoptotic enzymes such as caspases and nucleases. Blocking Kv channels has been known to prevent neuronal apoptosis by preventing K+ efflux. Some neural diseases such as epilepsy are caused by neuronal hyperexcitability, which eventually may lead to neuronal apoptosis. Reduction in activities of A-type Kv channels and Kv7 subfamily members is amongst the etiological causes of neuronal hyperexcitation; enhancing the opening of these channels may offer opportunities of remedy. This review discusses the potential uses of Kv channel modulators as neuroprotective drugs.\n\nBench-to-bedside review: Molecular pharmacology and clinical use of inert gases in anesthesia and neuroprotection\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest in the clinical use of inert gases. In the present paper we review the use of inert gases as anesthetics and neuroprotectants, with particular attention to the clinical use of xenon. We discuss recent advances in understanding the molecular pharmacology of xenon and we highlight specific pharmacological targets that may mediate its actions as an anesthetic and neuroprotectant. We summarize recent in vitro and in vivo studies on the actions of helium and the other inert gases, and discuss their potential to be used as neuroprotective agents.

However, it has limited capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus potentially limiting its protective capacity. Recent studies demonstrated that intranasal drug administration is a promising way in delivering neuroprotective agents to the central nervous system. The current study therefore aimed at determining whether intranasal administration of G-CSF increases its delivery to the brain and its neuroprotective effect against ischemic brain injury. Transient focal cerebral ischemia in rat was induced with middle cerebral artery occlusion. Our resulted showed that intranasal administration is 8-12 times more effective than subcutaneous injection in delivering G-CSF to cerebrospinal fluid and brain parenchyma. Intranasal delivery enhanced the protective effects of G-CSF against ischemic injury in rats, indicated by decreased infarct volume and increased recovery of neurological function. The neuroprotective mechanisms of G-CSF involved enhanced upregulation of HO-1 and reduced calcium overload following ischemia. Intranasal G-CSF application also promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis following brain ischemia. Taken together, G-CSF is a legitimate neuroprotective agent and intranasal administration of G-CSF is more effective in delivery and neuroprotection and could be a practical approach in clinic.\n\nRecent Updates in Neuroprotective and Neuroregenerative Potential of Centella asiatica\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLokanathan, Yogeswaran; Omar, Norazzila; Ahmad Puzi, Nur Nabilah; Saim, Aminuddin; Hj Idrus, Ruszymah\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCentella asiatica, locally well known in Malaysia as pegaga, is a traditional herb that has been used widely in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and in the traditional medicine of other Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia. Although consumption of the plant is indicated for various illnesses, its potential neuroprotective properties have been well studied and documented. In addition to past studies, recent studies also discovered and/or reconfirmed that C. asiatica acts as an antioxidant, reducing the effect of oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. At the in vitro level, C. asiatica promotes dendrite arborisation and elongation, and also protects the neurons from apoptosis. In vivo studies have shown that the whole extract and also individual compounds of C. asiatica have a protective effect against various neurological diseases. Most of the in vivo studies on neuroprotective effects have focused on Alzheimerâs disease, Parkinsonâs disease, learning and memory enhancement, neurotoxicity and other mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and epilepsy. Recent studies have embarked on finding the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection by C. asiatica extract. However, the capability of C. asiatica in enhancing neuroregeneration has not been studied much and is limited to the regeneration of crushed sciatic nerves and protection from neuronal injury in hypoxia conditions. More studies are still needed to identify the compounds and the mechanism of action of C. asiatica that are particularly involved in neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. Furthermore, the extraction method, biochemical profile and dosage information of the C. asiatica extract need to be standardised to enhance the economic value of this traditional herb and to accelerate the entry of C. asiatica extracts into modern medicine.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Clematichinenoside (AR) and its underlying mechanisms. MCAO mode was performed in rats and OGD/R model in primary cortical neurons to investigate the neuroprotective effect of AR. The rate of apoptotic cells was measured using TUNEL assay in cerebral cortex and flow cytometric assay in cortical neurons. Apoptosis-related proteins such as bcl-2, bcl-xl, and bax and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, cPKC, p90RSK, and CREB in ischemic penumbra were assayed by western blot. Furthermore, we made a thorough inquiry about how these proteins play roles in the anti-apoptotic mechanism using targets-associated inhibitors step by step. The results revealed that AR could activate both ERK1/2 and cPKC which resulted in p90RSK phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus. Moreover, CREB, a downstream target of p90RSK, was phosphorylated and then bound to cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE) to activate apoptosis-related genes, and finally ameliorate ischemic stroke through preventing neuron death. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that AR could be used as an effective neuroprotective agent to protect against ischemic stroke after cerebral I/R injury through regulating both ERK1/2 and cPKC mediated p90RSK/CREB apoptotic pathways.

Here we review some of the recent advances in the search for disease-modifying drugs for ALS based on their putative neuroprotective effetcs. A number of more or less established agents have recently been investigated also in ALS for their potential role in neuroprotection and relying on antiglutamatergic, antioxidant or antiapoptotic strategies. Among them Talampanel, beta-lactam antibiotics, Coenzyme Q10, and minocycline have been investigated. Progress has also been made in exploiting growth factors for the treatment of ALS, partly due to advances in developing effective delivery systems to the central nervous system. A number of new therapies have also been identified, including a novel class of compounds, such as heat-shock protein co-inducers, which upregulate cell stress responses, and agents promoting autophagy and mitochondriogenesis, such as lithium and rapamycin. More recently, alterations of mRNA processing were described as a pathogenic mechanism in genetically defined forms of ALS, as those related to TDP-43 and FUS-TLS gene mutations. This knowledge is expected to improve our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism in ALS and developing more effective therapies.\n\nBBB-Permeable, Neuroprotective, and Neurotrophic Polysaccharide, Midi-GAGR.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakani, Vishruti; Jang, Yong-Gil; Christopher, Kevin; Judy, Wesley; Eckstein, Jacob; Hensley, Kenneth; Chiaia, Nicolas; Kim, Dong-Shik; Park, Joshua\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAn enormous amount of efforts have been poured to find an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among those, neurotrophic peptides that regenerate neuronal structures and increase neuron survival show a promise in slowing neurodegeneration. However, the short plasma half-life and poor blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeability of neurotrophic peptides limit their in vivo efficacy. Thus, an alternative neurotrophic agent that has longer plasma half-life and better BBB-permeability has been sought for. Based on the recent findings of neuroprotective polysaccharides, we searched for a BBB-permeable neuroprotective polysaccharide among natural polysaccharides that are approved for human use. Then, we discovered midi-GAGR, a BBB-permeable, long plasma half-life, strong neuroprotective and neurotrophic polysaccharide. Midi-GAGR is a 4.7kD cleavage product of low acyl gellan gum that is approved by FDA for human use. Midi-GAGR protected rodent cortical neurons not only from the pathological concentrations of co-/post-treated free reactive radicals and AÎ²42 peptide but also from activated microglial cells. Moreover, midi-GAGR showed a good neurotrophic effect; it enhanced neurite outgrowth and increased phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB) in the nuclei of primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, intra-nasally administered midi-GAGR penetrated the BBB and exerted its neurotrophic effect inside the brain for 24 h after one-time administration. Midi-GAGR appears to activate fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and its downstream neurotrophic signaling pathway for neuroprotection and CREB activation. Additionally, 14-day intranasal administration of midi-GAGR not only increased neuronal activity markers but also decreased hyperphosphorylated tau, a precursor of neurofibrillary tangle, in the brains of the AD mouse model, 3xTg-AD.

We compared the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of supercritical extract of Bacopa monnieri and rosemary antioxidant extract obtained from Rosmarinus officinalis as well as their combination to examine the effects on human glial (U-87 MG) and embryonic mouse hypothalamus cells. Bacopa monnieri extract, rosemary antioxidant extract, and their combination (1:1) are not cytotoxic in both glial and embryonic mouse hypothalamus cell lines up to 200 Î¼g/mL concentration. The combination of extracts of Bacopa monnieri + rosemary antioxidant has better antioxidant potential and antilipid peroxidation activity than either agent alone. Although the extract of Bacopa monnieri + rosemary antioxidant showed almost similar inhibition of phospho tau expression as Bacopa monnieri or rosemary antioxidant extract alone, the combination has better inhibitory effect on amyloid precursor protein synthesis and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor production in hypothalamus cells than single agents. These results suggest that the extract of Bacopa monnieri + rosemary antioxidant is more neuroprotective than Bacopa monnieri or rosemary antioxidant extract.\n\nMeclizine-induced enhanced glycolysis is neuroprotective in Parkinson disease cell models.\n\nPubMed\n\nHong, Chien Tai; Chau, Kai-Yin; Schapira, Anthony H V\n\n2016-05-05\n\nMeclizine is a well-tolerated drug routinely used as an anti-histamine agent in the management of disequilibrium. Recently, meclizine has been assessed for its neuroprotective properties in ischemic stroke and Huntington disease models. We found that meclizine protected against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced apoptosis and cell death in both SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary cortical cultures. Meclizine increases the level of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), which activates phosphofructokinase, a rate-determining enzyme of glycolysis. This protection is therefore mediated by meclizine's ability to enhance glycolysis and increase mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Meclizine represents an interesting candidate for further investigation to re-purpose for its potential to be neuroprotective in Parkinson disease.\n\nNeuroprotection and Anti-Epileptogenesis with Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-06-01\n\nantioxidant, SS-31 in the pilocarpine (PILO) model of status epilepticus (SE), the kindling seizure model and the tetanus toxin (Tx) model of epilepsy...neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic agent in three experimental models of epilepsy.

Demonstrated that neuroprotective effects when exposed hypercapnic hypoxia-mediated protein synthesis increased S-100B, mainly due to the action of carbon dioxide, and not oxygen deficiency. Neuroprotective effects of HSP-70 due to hypoxia, but the combined effect of hypoxia and hypercapnia gives a significant increase in the synthesis of HSP-70 in comparison with the isolated effect of hypoxia. Vascularization activated equally as hypoxia and hypercapnia, without adding significant effects in combination. This suggests dominant effect hypercapnia, hypoxia compared in neuroprotection mechanisms related to protein S-100B, but not the protein VEGF, hypercapnia and potentiate the neuroprotective efficacy of hypoxia-related protein HSP-70.\n\n[Neuroprotective effects of curcumin].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Yong; Wang, Pengwen\n\n2009-12-01\n\nTraditionally, turmeric has been put to use as a food additive and herbal medicine in Asia. Curcumin is an active principle of the perennial herb curcuma longa (commonly known as turmeric). Recent evidence suggests that curcumin has activities with potential for neuroprotective efficacy, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiprotein-aggregate activities. In the current review, we provide the newly evidence for the potential role of curcumin in the neuroprotective effects of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\nCoptis chinensis Franch. exhibits neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nFriedemann, Thomas; Otto, Benjamin; KlÃ¤tschke, Kristin; Schumacher, Udo; Tao, Yi; Leung, Alexander Kai-Man; Efferth, Thomas; SchrÃ¶der, Sven\n\n2014-08-08\n\nThe dried rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch. (family Ranunculaceae) is traditionally used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and diabetes. Recent studies showed a variety of activities of Coptis chinensis Franch. alkaloids, including neuroprotective, neuroregenerative, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is no report on the neuroprotective effect of Coptis chinensis Franch. watery extract against tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH) induced oxidative damage. The aim of the study is to investigate neuroprotective properties of Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome watery extract (CRE) and to evaluate its potential mechanism of action. Neuroprotective properties on t-BOOH induced oxidative stress were investigated in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Cells were pretreated with CRE for 2 h or 24 h followed by 2 h of treatment with t-BOOH. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CRE, cell viability, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the apoptotic rate were determined and microarray analyses, as well as qRT-PCR analyses were conducted. Two hours of exposure to 100 ÂµM t-BOOH resulted in a significant reduction of cell viability, increased apoptotic rate, declined mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increased ROS production. Reduction of cell viability, increased apoptotic rate and declined mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) could be significantly reduced in cells pretreated with CRE (100 Âµg/ml) for 2h or 24h ahead of t-BOOH exposure with the greatest effect after 24h of pretreatment; however ROS production was not changed significantly. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that the expressions of 2 genes; thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1, were significantly regulated. Down regulation of TXNIP was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Due to its neuroprotective properties CRE might be a potential\n\nParamedic Initiation of Neuroprotective Agent Infusions: Successful Achievement of Target Blood Levels and Attained Level Effect on Clinical Outcomes in the FAST-MAG Pivotal Trial (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy - Magnesium).\n\nPubMed\n\nShkirkova, Kristina; Starkman, Sidney; Sanossian, Nerses; Eckstein, Marc; Stratton, Samuel; Pratt, Frank; Conwit, Robin; Hamilton, Scott; Sharma, Latisha; Liebeskind, David; Restrepo, Lucas; Valdes-Sueiras, Miguel; Saver, Jeffrey L\n\n2017-07-01\n\nParamedic use of fixed-size lumen, gravity-controlled tubing to initiate intravenous infusions in the field may allow rapid start of neuroprotective therapy for acute stroke. In a large, multicenter trial, we evaluated its efficacy in attaining target serum levels of candidate neuroprotective agent magnesium sulfate and the relation of achieved magnesium levels to outcome. The FAST-MAG phase 3 trial (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy - Magnesium) randomized 1700 patients within 2 hours of onset to paramedic-initiated, a 15-minute loading intravenous infusion of magnesium or placebo followed by a 24-hour maintenance dose. The drug delivery strategy included fixed-size lumen, gravity-controlled tubing for field drug administration, and a shrink-wrapped ambulance kit containing both the randomized field loading and hospital maintenance doses for seamless continuation. Among patient randomized to active treatment, magnesium levels in the first 72 hours were assessed 987 times in 572 patients. Mean patient age was 70 years (SDÂ±14 years), and 45% were women. During the 24-hour period of active infusion, mean achieved serum level was 3.91 (Â±0.8), consistent with trial target. Mg levels were increased by older age, female sex, lower weight, height, body mass index, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, and higher hematocrit. Adjusted odds for clinical outcomes did not differ by achieved Mg level, including disability at 90 days, symptomatic hemorrhage, or death. Paramedic infusion initiation using gravity-controlled tubing permits rapid achievement of target serum levels of potential neuroprotective agents. The absence of association of clinical outcomes with achieved magnesium levels provides further evidence that magnesium is not biologically neuroprotective in acute stroke.

Heparin possesses non-anticoagulant properties, including modulation of various proteases, interactions with fibroblast growth factors, and anti-inflammatory actions. Senile dementia of Alzheimerâs type is accompanied by inflammatory responses contributing to irreversible changes in neuronal viability and brain function. Vascular factors are also involved in the pathogenesis of senile dementia. Inflammation, endogenous proteoglycans, and assembly of senile plagues and neurofibrillary tangles contribute directly and indirectly to further neuronal damage. Neuron salvage can be achieved by anti-inflammation and the competitive inhibition of proteoglycans accumulation. The complexity of the pathology of senile dementia provides numerous potential targets for therapeutic interventions designed to modulate inflammation and proteoglycan assembly. Heparin and related oligosaccharides are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects as well as inhibitory effects on proteoglycan assembly and may prove useful as neuroprotective agents.

Data Sources National Library of Medicine PubMed literature review. Data Selection The mechanisms of neuroprotection by progesterone are reviewed, and the preclinical literature using progesterone treatment in adult animal models of TBI are summarized. Unique features of the developing brain that could either enhance or limit the efficacy of neuroprotection by progesterone are discussed, and the limited preclinical literature using progesterone after acute injury to the developing brain is described. Finally, the current status of clinical trials of progesterone for adult TBI is reviewed. Data Extraction and Synthesis Progesterone is a pleotropic agent with beneficial effects on secondary injury cascades that occur after TBI, including cerebral edema, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity. More than 40 studies have used progesterone for treatment after TBI in adult animal models, with results summarized in tabular form. However, very few studies have evaluated progesterone in pediatric animal models of brain injury. To date, two human Phase II trials of progesterone for adult TBI have been published, and two multi-center Phase III trials are underway. Conclusions The unique features of the developing brain from that of a mature adult brain make it necessary to independently study progesterone in clinically relevant, immature animal models of TBI. Additional preclinical studies could lead to the development of a novel neuroprotective therapy that could reduce the long-term disability in head-injured children, and could potentially provide benefit in other forms of pediatric brain injury (global ischemia, stroke, statue epilepticus).

Cells obtain creatine from a diet rich in fish, meat, or dairy and by endogenous synthesis from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine in an approximate 50:50 ratio. Animal studies have shown that creatine may provide fetal neuroprotection when given to the mother through her diet in pregnancy. It is important to assess whether maternally administered creatine in human pregnancy (at times of known, suspected, or potential fetal compromise) may offer neuroprotection to the fetus and may accordingly reduce the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as cerebral palsy and associated impairments and disabilities arising from fetal brain injury. To assess the effects of creatine when used for neuroprotection of the fetus. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2014). We planned to include all published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials. We planned to include studies reported as abstracts only as well as full-text manuscripts. Trials using a cross-over or cluster-randomised design were not eligible for inclusion.We planned to include trials comparing creatine given to women in pregnancy for fetal neuroprotection (regardless of the route, timing, dose, or duration of administration) with placebo, no treatment, or with an alternative agent aimed at providing fetal neuroprotection. We also planned to include comparisons of different regimens for administration of creatine. We identified no completed or ongoing randomised controlled trials. We found no randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review. As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review, we are unable to comment on implications for practice.

Techniques that focus on modeling emergence, such as agent-based modeling and multi-agent simulations, are of particular interest as they support the discovery of pathways that may have never been observed in the past. Thus far, these techniques have been primarily applied at the multi-cellular level, or have focused on signaling and metabolic networks. We present an approach where emergence modeling is extended to regulatorymoreÂ Â» networks and demonstrate its application to the discovery of neuroprotective pathways. An initial evaluation of the approach indicates that emergence modeling provides novel insights for the analysis of regulatory networks that can advance the discovery of acute treatments for stroke and other diseases.Â«Â less\n\nIdentification of Potentially Neuroprotective Genes Upregulated by Neurotrophin Treatment of CA3 Neurons in the Injured Brain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalik, Saafan Z.; Motamedi, Shahab; Royo, Nicolas C.; LeBold, David\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAbstract Specific neurotrophic factors mediate histological and/or functional improvement in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In previous work, several lines of evidence indicated that the mammalian neurotrophin NT-4/5 is neuroprotective for hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons after experimental TBI. We hypothesized that NT-4/5 neuroprotection is mediated by changes in the expression of specific sets of genes, and that NT-4/5-regulated genes are potential therapeutic targets for blocking delayed neuronal death after TBI. In this study, we performed transcription profiling analysis of CA3 neurons to identify genes regulated by lateral fluid percussion injury, or by treatment with the trkB ligands NT-4/5 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The results indicate extensive overlap between genes upregulated by neurotrophins and genes upregulated by injury, suggesting that the mechanism behind neurotrophin neuroprotection may mimic the brain's endogenous protective response. A subset of genes selected for further study in vitro exhibited neuroprotection against glutamate excitotoxicity. The neuroprotective genes identified in this study were upregulated at 30âh post-injury, and are thus expected to act during a clinically useful time frame of hours to days after injury. Modulation of these factors and pathways by genetic manipulation or small molecules may confer hippocampal neuroprotection in vivo in preclinical models of TBI.

Treatment with diethylmaleate (1 mM), buthionine sulfoximine (500 microM) or menadione (10-50 microM) caused diffuse GT1-7 cell degeneration, as assessed by using either the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay or the fluorescent dyes fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Pre- and/or co-exposure of the cells to nicergoline significantly prevented diethylmaleate- or buthionine sulfoximine-induced neuronal death, whereas nicergoline was ineffective against menadione-induced toxicity. This effect was concentration-dependent and was mimicked by the classical antioxidants idebenone and vitamin E, and did not depend on interference with protein kinase C. Interestingly, the antineurodegenerative activity of nicergoline and vitamin E or idebenone was not additive, suggesting that these compounds share some intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for their protective effects. In conclusion, the present data indicate that nicergoline has neuroprotective activity, possibly mediated by the antioxidant activity of the molecule, and give support to the potential use of nicergoline in the prevention and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nEffect of Combination Therapy with Neuroprotective and Vasoprotective Agents on Cerebral Ischemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Jiping; Yang, Bei; Xiu, Baoxin; Qi, Jinchong; Liu, Huaijun\n\n2018-05-01\n\nBecause most tested drugs are active against only one of the damaging processes associated with stroke, other mechanisms may cause cellular death. Thus, a combination of protective agents targeting different pathophysiological mechanisms may obtain better effects than a single agent. The major objective of this study was to investigate the effect of combination therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) after controlled ischemic brain injury in rabbits. Animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: sham group, saline-treated control group or NGF+VEGF-treated group. Animals received an intracerebral microinjection of VEGF and NGF or saline at 5 or 8 hours after ischemia. The two specified time points of administration were greater than or equal to the existing therapeutic time window for monoterapy with VEGF or NGF alone (3 or 5 hours of ischemia). Infarct volume, water content, neurological deficits, neural cell apoptosis and the expression of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were measured. Compared with saline-treated controls, the combination therapy of VEGF and NGF significantly reduced infarct volume, water content, neural cell apoptosis and the expression of caspase-3, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and improved functional recovery (both p<0.01) when administered 5 or 8 hours after ischemia. The earlier the administration the better the neuroprotection. These results showed that the combination therapy with VEGF and NGF provided neuroprotective effects. In addition, the time window of combination treatment should be at least 8 hours after ischemia, which was wider than monotherapy.

One possible explanation for this is that a deeper understanding is required of how endogenous mechanisms act to confer neuroprotection. This mini-review reports the proceedings of a recent workshop âNeuroprotection and Neurorepair: New Strategiesâ (Iguazu Falls, Misiones, Argentina, April 11â13, 2011, Satellite Symposium of the V Neurotoxicity Society Meeting, 2011) in which four areas of active research were identified to have the potential to generate new insights into this field. Topics discussed were i) metallothionein and other multipotent neuroprotective molecules; ii) oxidative stress and their signal mediated pathways in neuroregeneration; iii) neurotoxins in glial cells, and iv) drugs of abuse with neuroprotective effects.
