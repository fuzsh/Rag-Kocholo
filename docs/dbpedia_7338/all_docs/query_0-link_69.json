Aaron and Barbara Levine (United States)\n\nWhile Aaron makes money as a lawyer suing Big Pharma, the passion that he and his wife Barbara share is a love for conceptual art. “I’m a Duchamp wacko,” Aaron told artnet News. “I’m also On Kawara crazy,” Aaron added. The couple’s collection includes works by On Kawara, Robert Barry, Christopher Williams, Joana Vasconcelos, and Marcel Duchamp (they own 25 of the Frenchman’s seminal works).

After selling a Basquiat for $57 million at Christie’s in May, Lindemann found himself bidding, unsuccessfully, for a Calder mobile. That frustrated purchase notwithstanding, Lindemann tells artnet News that he has successfully chased down other Calder sculptures this year, along with a number of works of Oceanic tribal art. Lindemann says he also spends a small fortune on vintage race cars.\n\nSebastian Siegel and Eugenio Lopez Alonso in Awakening World (2012).\n\nImage: Courtesy www.imdb.com.\n\n54.

In 2013, the David Chipperfield-designed Museo Jumex brought Mexico headlong into the global art circuit. The museum, which includes some 2,000 artworks, boasts first-rate pieces by contemporary masters including Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Brice Marden, John Chamberlain, and Louise Bourgeois.\n\nEric Fischl and Michael Lynne at Guild Hall Academy of the Arts Lifetime Achievement Awards Dinner, March 8, 2016.

Michael Lynne (United States)\n\nMovie mogul Lynne (he’s the co-founder of New Line Cinema and producer of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) started collecting when he was a young showbiz lawyer in the early 1980s. According to the New York Post, he horse-traded legal advice in exchange for artworks by then-unknown talents like Cindy Sherman, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Richard Prince, and Julian Schnabel. Lynne’s collection has since swollen to include works by hundreds of present-day blue chip and emerging artists.

Yusaku Maezawa (Japan)\n\nIf only all collectors were like Yusaku Maezawa. The Japanese fashion mogul dropped $98 million on two consecutive days in May, making him a hero of New York’s spring auctions. Between May 1 and May 2 at Christie’s, he bought an untitled 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat for a record $57.3 million, as well as works by Richard Prince ($9.6 million), Jeff Koons ($6.8 million), Alexander Calder ($5.7 million), Bruce Nauman ($1.7 million), Adrian Ghenie ($2.6 million), and Christopher Wool ($13.9 million). By the time Maezawa’s shopping cart was full, he’d spent enough to cover one quarter of Christie’s total evening sale profits for the spring, according to Bloomberg. The collector is now among the most talked about—and newest—high rollers on the scene.\n\nFatimah and Eskander Maleki.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy patrickmcmullan.com\n\n57.

Moscow’s answer to London’s Tate Modern, Mikhelson’s new museum will differ from traditional art museums. As the collector told the Moscow Times, he aims for V-A-C to function “as an ‘agora’ — a place where young artists can actively interact with each other and connect with the global art scene.”\n\nSimon and Catriona Mordant.

She also clearly has a sense of humor about it. Prada reportedly has a Carsten Höller slide behind her office desk that she uses to leave her office at night. She and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, own more than 900 works of modern and contemporary art, most of which they display at their Fondazione Prada spaces in Venice and Milan.

Howard and Cindy Rachofsky (United States)\n\nThe Texas-based collecting couple was included in our 2016 Dallas power list for good reason. Their collection consists of roughly 800 works of contemporary art that mostly fall within two broad themes: minimalism and representational work that explores “the post-war notion of identity” (in the words of the collection’s website). Among the artists represented in the collection are Robert Gober, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Mark Grotjahn, Mona Hatoum, and Gerhard Richter. In 2012, Howard founded the Warehouse with his friend Vernon Faulconer, who passed away in 2015; its 16 galleries occupy 18,000 square feet of exhibition space for works drawn from both couples’ private collections as well as pieces purchased jointly with the Dallas Museum of Art.\n\nEmily Rales and Mitch Rales at Americans for the Arts 2010 National Arts Awards, October 18, 2010.

Built near the couple’s house in Potomac, Maryland, that first effort is getting an expansion in the guise of a new 170,000-square-foot museum building that will quadruple Glenstone’s existing exhibition space. According to the Washington Post’s Philip Kennicott, “when finished, sometime in 2017, Glenstone will rank in the top tier of privately endowed contemporary art institutions.” The Rales’ high-end collection includes work by Richard Serra, Ellsworth Kelly, Alberto Giacometti, and Jackson Pollock.\n\nDavid Roberts.

Subsequent stories about a high-profile divorce with his ex-wife and his appearance in the Panama Papers have only served to keep the Russian collector in the headlines. Among the artworks Rybolovlev is said to own are works by Vincent van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nTony Salamé (right), with Roselee Goldberg, Cecilia Alemani, Massimiliano Gioni, at a dinner celebrating Paola Pivi’s inaugural exhibition at Galerie Perrotin, New York, September 17, 2013.

The planned museum will occupy five forested hectares and will display the sort of monumental works Tek favors, including Anselm Kiefer’s Velimir Khlebnikov: Fates of Nations: The New Theory of War (2011–14), which consists of two huge vitrines containing rusting miniature submarines. “I am definitely making something very high end,” Tek told the Financial Times last year. “It will be quite expensive to go in, about $100, but once inside everything will be free.” He plans to open the park in 2017.\n\nSheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani (right), with David Beckham at a tennis match in Doha, Qatar on February 27, 2015.

Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani (Qatar) NEW!\n\nHer excellency the Sheikha is the daughter of the former emir of Qatar and the sister of the country’s current emir, which probably makes her the most powerful woman in the art world—thanks to what CNN reports is a $1 billion annual purchasing budget. Acquisitions include major Warhols, Lichtensteins, Bacons, and Hirsts, as well as Paul Cezanne’s The Card Players (1895)—for which the Qataris paid $250 million (a record price for a work of art at the time)—and 11 Mark Rothko canvases, which cost a reported $310 million. The Jean Nouvel-designed National Museum of Qatar is reported to cost $34 million and is scheduled top open in 2016.\n\nSteve Tisch at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts 50th Anniversary Gala, Celebrating the Past/Creating the Future, April 4, 2016.

Steve Tisch (United States) NEW!\n\nMovie producer and chairman of the NFL’s New York Giants, the billionaire Tisch has an outsize appetite for blue chip art that recently led him to build a 4,500 square foot private museum in his LA backyard. Among the works on view are Ed Ruscha’s large-scale painting A Blvd Called Sunset (1992) and Gerhard Richter’s gray-and-white Two Women at Table (1968). The producer of Forrest Gump is also a major contributor to LACMA and was instrumental in that museum’s purchase of Christian Marclay’s The Clock (2010).\n\nFrancesca von Habsburg attends the Montblanc De La Culture Arts Patronage Award 2016 at Historisches Pumpwerk on June 01, 2016 in Berlin, Germany.

Francesca von Habsburg (Austria)\n\nImperial archduchess Francesca von Habsburg is not merely haute European royalty (she is married to Karl Habsburg-Lothringen, head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine). Her single-minded collecting has also garnered comparisons to America’s art-crazy heiress Peggy Guggenheim. Von Habsburg’s Vienna-based foundation, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, was founded in 2002. Since then it has developed a reputation as an incubator for socially minded art projects (exhibiting artists include Olafur Eliasson, Ernesto Neto, and Kutlug Ataman). TBA21 is planning a long-term “Oceans Pavilion” for Venice that von Habsburg hopes to launch during the summer of 2017 at the 57th international Venice Biennale.\n\nAlice Walton.

Alice Walton (United States)\n\nThe richest woman in the world ($33.2 billion), Walton founded the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, in 2011 to house a selection of masterpieces from her expanding collection. A museum spokesman tells artnet News that Walton, in her capacity as board chair, was recently involved in the following museum purchases: Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s Untitled (L.A.) (1991), Faith Ringgold’s Maya’s Quilt of Life (1989), and Alma Thomas’s Lunar Rendezvous-Circle of Flowers (1969). Additionally, Walton’s museum announced in March that it is planning to transform a defunct 63,000-square-foot Kraft cheese plant into a new space for contemporary art. The new museum is expected to open in 2018.\n\nDerek and Christen Wilson at The Kitchen’s Spring Gala Benefit at Cipriani Wall St., New York, May 22, 2014.\n\n© Patrick McMullan\n\nPhoto-JIMI CELESTE/patrickmcmullan.com.\n\n92. Derek and Christen Wilson (United States) NEW!\n\nIn 2014, the Wilsons gave a $1 million gift to the Nasher Museum at Duke, where Derek is a trustee. They followed up by donating several works of art and committing to the purchase of three others. Their own sprawling collection includes works by Christopher Wool, Sterling Ruby, Sol Lewitt, Joe Bradley, and Aaron Curry. Christen, meanwhile, sits on a dizzying number of arts associations: she’s co-chair of the North American Acquisitions Committee for the TATE Modern, chair of the Nasher Program Advisory Committee, member of the Soluna Advisory Panel Committee, member of the Whitney Performance Art Committee, and c0-chair of TATE Artists Dinner.\n\nRobert and Nicky Wilson.

Wynn was revealed by the New York Times to be the buyer of Francis Bacon’s Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), which she purchased for a staggering $142.4 million at Christie’s New York. According to the Los Angeles Times, Wynne recently pledged $50 million towards LACMA’s $600-million new building. Last year, she said that museum would be “prominently considered” as the recipient of her famed Bacon painting when she goes “to the craps game in the sky.”\n\nLu Xun attends the “Alex Prager Exibition” Press Preview at Galeries Lafayette on October 19, 2015 in Paris, France.

Liu Yiqian and Wang Wei (China)\n\nIt was a big year for Liu and Wang, who followed up their 2014 purchase of a Chinese porcelain cup for $32 million by buying the world’s second-most-expensive painting at auction: Amedeo Modigliani’s Nu couché (1917), sold at Christie’s New York for $170.4 million. Liu has also made news for announcing plans to open a Chonqing outpost of his Long Museum, which already has two locations in Shanghai, and for acquiring shares of the Beijing Council International Auction Company. He also made waves this year at Art Basel for purchasing the mammoth Gerhard Richter canvas at Marian Goodman.\n\nPoju Zabludowicz and Anita Zabludowicz.

Anita and Poju Zabludowicz (United Kingdom)\n\nAnita established herself as an adventurous collector well before founding three physical spaces in as many locations: north London, New York’s Times Square, and in Poju’s native Finland. The couple, with a 5,000-piece collection, completely eschews the current art-flipping phenomenon and is largely dedicated to supporting emerging artists. In 2014, Anita told the New York Times, “We prefer artists who like to work on long term projects with institutions. The get-rich quick painters are another story.” At this year’s Armory Show, George Vamvakidis of Athens’s Breeder Gallery told artnet News that the Zabludowicz Collection had bought Jannis Varelas‘s The Cowboy for $30,000.\n\nJochen Zeitz.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Nick Hunt/ Patrick McMullan.\n\n98. Jochen Zeitz (South Africa)\n\nThe former chairman of the sportswear company Puma founded the Zeitz Collection in 2002; following that, the collection’s treasures were spread between spaces in the US, Kenya, Spain, Switzerland, and South Africa. In September 2017, all of that will change with the opening of the $38-million, 100,000-square-foot Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town. The museum’s director and curator, Mark Coetzee (formerly head of the Rubell collection in Miami), has put together what many consider to be the leading collection of contemporary art from Africa and the diaspora.\n\nQiao Zhibing.
