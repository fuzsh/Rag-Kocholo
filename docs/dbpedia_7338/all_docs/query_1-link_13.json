        "text": "Mexico City has long been a power player in the realm of architecturally significant museums, from Pedro Ramírez Vázquez’s 1964 Museo Nacional de Antropología to Fernando Romero’s recent Museo Soumaya. That legacy continues today with the opening of the travertine Museo Jumex.\n\nSituated across from Soumaya, in the Nuevo Polanco design mecca known as Plaza Carso, the Jumex is the first David Chipperfield project in Latin America; it’s also home to the region’s most significant contemporary art holding, run by Eugenio López Alonso, the visionary heir to the Grupo Jumex fruit juice empire. For Alonso’s money, the sawtooth roof—and the third-level skylit Galería 3 beneath it—is Jumex’s pièce de résistance, meant to “bathe the art” in natural light in a “space that is generous but not monumental.”\n\nFor this much-anticipated opening, the space is home to the exhibition “A Place in Two Dimensions,” an art-fueled dialogue between seven sculptures by the late Fred Sandback opposite 50 works from the collection, including Donald Judd’s copper wall-mounted light installation Amber Stack, one of Jeff Koons’s equilibrium tanks—featuring two “Shaq Attaq” basketballs—and hometown-hero Gabriel Orozco’s Oval Billiard Table, which explores mathematics and typography.\n\nThe second floor will feature the first Mexico-based retrospective on the mythmaking practice of the late American artist James Lee Byars, while Damián Ortega’s installation of moving household objects, Cosmogonía doméstica, holds court on the ground-floor patio. Meanwhile, the library basement plays host to an exploration of Fernando Gamboa’s impact on the country’s burgeoning contemporary art scene. “What functions well in Los Angeles may not in Bogotá or, for that matter, in Mexico City,” says Alonso. “First and foremost, a museum must be in dialogue with its city, intervene in its sociocultural fabric and be a participant, engage its urban context.” He wants Jumex to serve as a “refuge from the urban noise of the megalopolis.” That's no small task in a city of 20 million."
