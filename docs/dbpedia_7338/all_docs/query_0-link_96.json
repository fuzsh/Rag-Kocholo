Throughout Hopgoods Career he has appropriated and re-imagined pop and underground culture in a variety of different ways. Attended Goldsmiths College https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldsmiths,_University_of_London graduating in 1994 with a BA in Fine Art. The same year he had two solo shows Arrivals Departures at Karsten Schubert Gallery and Waddington Gallery (now Waddington Custodial) in Cork Street, London.

His work has been shown at Galleries in New York, Sydney , Berlin, Italy, London and Los Angeles. The illusionary nature of Hopgood’s Work, which literally plays with the idea of existence, appearance and reality through the practical use of projection. He creates a liminal space for the viewer, one that exists in a state of transference from reality to dream and back again. The projection on solid plaster forms. which in itself is n index of another figure, only becomes ‘alive’ when the projector is present. His Neon Work has been exhibited at The Museum Of Modern Art / Kenny Goss Foundation in Dallas for the MTV Staying Alive Foundation.\n\nExhibiting in a group show in 2012 at The South Bank, London called Platform Six which offers a snapshot of London-based LGBTQ+ artists.\n\nNow based in LosAngeles, Hopgood's work is in several international collections including The Jumex Museum Mexico https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colección_Jumex The Groucho Club https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Club and The Vinik Foundation. Exhibited at The Maddox Gallery https://maddoxgallery.com/artists/257-carl-hopgood/overview/\n\nHopgood’s Wing Mirror Piece, a celluloid caprice involving what should be a simple film of moving traffic shot forwards through the side window of a moving car but that is in fact complicated not only by being projected onto both a side and an end wall, distorting the depicted space, but by being projected over an actual wing mirror that corresponds to the same mirroring the film, reversing the image and reflecting it onto the side wall to create a series of inversions and perspectives that shouldn’t be there. Common sense and empirical wisdom are played off against contradiction and incongruity to construct a series of paradoxes that attempt to subvert our ideas of the ‘normal'\n\nJohn Tozer Art Monthly review of Life Is Elsewhere curated by Alex Farquharson"
