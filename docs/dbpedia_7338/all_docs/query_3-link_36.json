        "text": "A key figure in Mexican conceptual art, Ulises Carrión (1941, San Andrés Tuxtla, Mexico – 1989, Amsterdam) was an artist, editor, curator, and theorist of the post-1960s international artistic avant-garde. Texts by Guy Schraenen, Felipe Ehrenberg and João Fernandes, among others, illustrate all aspects of his artistic and intellectual work. From his early career as a young, successful writer in Mexico to his numerous activities in Amsterdam where he cofounded the independent artists' run space In-Out Center and founded the legendary bookshop-gallery Other Books and So (1975–79), the first of its kind dedicated to artists’ publications."
