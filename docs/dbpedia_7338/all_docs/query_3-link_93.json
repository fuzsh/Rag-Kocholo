It was just one of a number of new price highs set in 2012–13 that demonstrate just how decisively the market for modern and contemporary art, at the top end, shrugged off the effects of the 2008–9 financial crisis and powered back to reach heights that eclipse even the 2007 season, the peak of the previous art market boom. Indeed, 2013 stood out in art-market history as its highest grossing, ever, for sales of fine art at auction. This book is an attempt to answer that question: to show how the whole art trade has profoundly changed in this century and how it is still evolving. The total value of the art market, including all categories, was estimated at $65.7 billion in 2013, a figure which comprises both dealer and auction sales; it has grown by 154 per cent since 2003.2 For fine art at auction – paintings, sculpture, photography and drawings – the total was $12.05 billion in 2013.3 Unlike in other industries, exact 9\n\nbig bucks figures are impossible to obtain. Dealer sales are not public, nor are the increasing number of sales over the internet. Auction figures, while often considered transparent, can be skewed by financial instruments and ‘buy-ins’ – works that do not sell. And the auction price may not be the final value if a work is bought by a dealer and marked up. Many indices to track the performance of art have been created, alongside the growing interest in art as an asset class. None are perfect, and a recent study has found that they may be over-optimistic in their calculation of the returns on investing in art.4 A recent book, Art as an Investment? A Survey of Comparative Assets by Melanie Gerlis, concludes that art is a very fragile asset from an investment point of view.5 The ascendency of contemporary art, which now completely dominates the market, is the most notable of these changes. Between 2004 and 2012 this market grew by 564 per cent in value – far eclipsing the previous traditional heavyweight category of Impressionist and modern art.6 This is partly due to the lack of supply – there is a diminishing inventory in all other sectors – but is also due to the changing profile of collectors; an overlap between the worlds of art, fashion, luxury and celebrity; the impact of emerging economies; and the sharply increased interest in art as an investment. It also reflects changes in the wider world, notably the nature and polarisation of wealth, and the impact of globalisation and the internet. Contributing substantially to growing this market have been the new players. Foremost are art fairs, which have burgeoned across the world to an extraordinary degree. The internet has zipped information on art, artists, exhibitions and events around the world, provides a new selling platform for art and reaches a far younger demographic than the ‘old’ market ever could. ‘Superstar’ curators and art advisors have played a major role in determining artists’ credibility and their validation in both the notfor-profit and for-profit fields, and indeed the permeability between the two – as curators move from the public to private sectors – is increasing. Public museums, once standing aloof from ‘the market’, are 10\n\nIntroduction increasingly involved with this new world. Even the most traditional ones now show contemporary art or commission artists’ interventions so as to be inclusive and remain relevant to their time. The fashion for private museums, the billionaire’s ‘must have’ in the twenty-first century, has triggered and accelerated demand for high-impact works by ‘brand-name’ artists. Apart from those in China, where some also feature traditional art, these private spaces overwhelmingly exhibit contemporary art – further boosting the fame and fortunes of living artists. The art market is a large mansion with many rooms, and contemp­ orary art is just one of them – and even within that room there are enormous variations. The present ‘winner takes all’ scenario concerns just a small number of living and recently dead artists, whose work is chased by a growing pool of ultra-wealthy buyers, anxious to acquire the trophy works that will give them incontestable bragging rights. And the higher the price the better in this billionaires’ playground. In many cases we are not even talking about ‘art’ anymore. The production, indeed over­production, of some living artists puts their work squarely into the category of luxury goods. Some of these changes in the art market have an echo in the fashion industry, which moved from a personal, artisan-led trade in the 1970s to the corporate, branded behemoth companies we see today. This is the world I look at in the following pages. It is only a partial view of the art market, the one that is most visible and in the news this century. Indeed, the picture of a totally booming market for modern and contemporary art should be nuanced – the strong top end disguises a weaker situation further down the scale, particularly among mid-market galleries, who are classically squeezed between the big operations and the smaller, lighter emerging dealers. This scenario is still being played out, with the mid-market galleries the most under threat. I shall come back to this in Chapter 2. I have been helped by so many people when writing this book that it would be impossible to name them all. Some are quoted by name, 11\n\nbig bucks many others did not want to be identified. I extend my heartfelt thanks to them all. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues at The Art Newspaper for their unfailing support and unquenchable good humour over many years. My thanks also go to my commissioning editor Lucy Myers of Lund Humphries for excellent suggestions as to structure, and to Howard Watson for his eagle-eyed copy-editing. Any mistakes are, of course, entirely my own. Finally, thanks to my husband Christopher, for his constant belief in me, and to my children Sacha, Olivier, Benjamin and their wives for sharing me with the art market.\n\nNotes Currencies.

Auction prices. Auction houses publish pre-sale estimates, both for individual works of art and for the final results of the sale, without taking into account the buyers’ premium. This varies from 12.5 per cent to 25 per cent depending on the hammer price, and depending on the auction house. (As of December 2013, Christie’s and Sotheby’s charged 25 per cent on works up to $100,000, 20 per cent on works between $100,001 and $2 million, and 12.5 per cent thereafter.) These fees must be added to the final hammer price. In this book, prices with premium are given unless otherwise indicated.\n\n12\n\nPrologue Gagosian Throws a Party\n\n‘It smelt and tasted of money, but cold money.’ Guest at Gagosian’s opening in Le Bourget airport\n\nWednesday 17 October 2012: The invitation was one of the most hotly sought-after in the autumn season. The thick card, with what looked like a field of golden wheat on the front, fell through Parisian letter­ boxes with a thud a few weeks before. Inside, a rather mysterious X-shape invited the recipient to the opening of a show by the German artist Anselm Kiefer, as well as the dinner afterwards. The party was being held to celebrate the launch of Gagosian’s newest space in Le Bourget, at the time the twelfth outpost of the mega-dealer’s art empire, which spans the world from Beverly Hills to Hong Kong. Larry Gagosian, the acknowledged master-dealer of his age, who had started his career 30 years earlier selling posters in a Los Angeles car park, was opening a second space in Paris and, to cap it all, right in a private airport. As someone commented at the party: ‘Before, billionaires could jet into a city to visit an art gallery – but they still needed a limo to get there. By putting his new space in an airport, Larry has eliminated the need for the limo!’ The 250-odd guests in Le Bourget that night were offered another form of transport – a train. While Gagosian’s white-cube space, in a former 1950s hangar, was capacious, with 1,650 square metres, it was too small for the number of guests. In any case it was filled with an installation of a caged-in, golden wheat field, along with paintings of flower-strewn meadows in the adjoining galleries, some so freshly painted that you could smell the oil. So after the vernissage of the show that evening, guests were rattled in a small shuttle 300 metres down the road to another, far bigger hangar, hired for the occasion. Here the interior was mostly plunged into darkness, but the aviation theme was strong: blue lights around the walls and red spotlights on the tables, which were laid out in the form of a cross, lit with lines of LED lights like a landing strip. This, then, as guests realised, was the ‘X’ in the invitation. 15\n\nbig bucks But what really made them gasp were three full-size private jets, looming out of the darkness, parked between the arms of the cross. To one side, a flashing black-and-white checkerboard dancefloor pulsated to the music of a DJ. Among the international smorgasbord of guests were artists – Californian Ed Ruscha in open shirt and bootlace tie, Anselm Kiefer in sober white shirt and French Marcel Duchamp prize-winner Tatiana Trouvé in patterned black-and-white; architect Jean Nouvel, responsible for the elegant refit of the gallery; collectors, including the Irish hotel mogul Paddy McKillan, Greek financier Dimitri Mavrommatis, and French photographer and philanthropist Jean Pigozzi in a colourful shirt; decorator Peter Marino; members of the Picasso family; Swiss/Spanish film star Vincent Pérez; and museum curators, among them Suzanne Pagé, who now buys art for Bernard Arnault, the luxury-goods mogul who owns Dior, Dom Pérignon, Louis Vuitton and much else besides. Then there was a smattering of European princely scions and art dealers, including Jay Jopling of White Cube, with his girlfriend, the Asian-American actor Hikari Yokoyama, and Thaddaeus Ropac, a bigleague art dealer fresh from opening his own new mega-space – bigger than Gagosian’s – in Pantin, just outside Paris. Ropac had inaugurated his space with a show by Kiefer, long planned, before Gagosian suddenly announced that he too would open his new space with Kiefer. ‘I’m speechless!’ said a stunned Ropac when he heard the news.7 But the art market is a ruthless jungle: the only concession was moving his opening to follow that of Ropac. Badly placed on a table near the exit, Ropac quickly left the party. Permanently tanned, Gagosian has been compared to a lion, or more unkindly, to a shark. The leonine comparison is the most apt: with his full head of crisp grey hair, snub nose and strong jaw, along with his don’t-mess-with-me demeanour, at the time Gagosian was the undisputed leader of the pack, the dealer who revolutionised the way contemporary art was sold. He turned his galleries, and many of the artists he represents, into ‘brands’ recognised across the world. 16\n\nPrologue He was the first art dealer ever to create a worldwide network of art galleries, which he uses to run a global art enterprise that represents 77 artists and handles dozens more; his empire was reported, in 2012, to generate revenues of almost $1 billion a year.8 Gagosian appears to be single-mindedly focused on his business: he has no children and no apparent succession plan. He does have girlfriends, the present being Chrissie Erpf. She was at his side at the Le Bourget party, seated at one end of the giant ‘X’ table with the more important guests. As the evening wore on some guests took the dance floor, in a desultory fashion: many were concerned more about getting back to Paris. The whole evening was, says one guest, ‘A demonstration of luxury, power and money. The evening was glamorous, impressive, but somehow grim: it smelt and tasted of money, but cold money.’ Gagosian’s party encapsulated much of the scope of this book, bringing together most of the players and the themes we shall meet in the coming pages: the glamour, the exclusivity, the spending and the global nature of the market today. The art market has always had glamorous parties, but nothing on the scale or ambition of that evening. The market has had its prolific artists, but historically none were able to produce so much, so fast, thanks to armies of assistants and a globalised world. It had seen a few international dealerships such as Wildenstein or Marlborough, but nothing on the global scale of Gagosian. It had seen a ‘branded’ gallery in Duveen, but nothing with the scope, size and influence of today’s mega-dealers. It had seen a handful of massively wealthy collectors, such as Henry Huntington or Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, but nothing comp­ arable to the pool of 2,170 billionaires across the globe, worth an aggregate total of $6.5 trillion, reported in 2013.9 Contemporary art has seen other peaks, for example in late nineteenth-century Europe, but had never seen the art of today become so fashionable, desirable and sought-after on a global scale. Perhaps most importantly, it had never seen museum building – mainly due to 17\n\nbig bucks private initiative – taking place simultaneously in so many countries, with all vying for the latest, largest and most striking contemporary artworks. And it had never seen the hordes of intermediaries, advisors, agents, bankers, socialites, art fund managers and independent curators who had appeared, riding on the coat tails of the boom. In the following chapters we shall look at all these different players: how contemporary art has become the overwhelming force in the market; how dealers and auctioneers went global; and why art prices have rocketed so high that one player quite seriously believes that he will see a $1 billion artwork in his lifetime.\n\n18\n\nPart i The Players\n\nThis page has been left blank intentionally\n\nChapter 1\n\nAuction Houses From Dusty Booksellers to The Art People\n\n‘I am convinced I will see a work of art sell for $1 billion in my lifetime.’ Francis Outred, head of contemporary art, Christie’s 10\n\n12 November 2013: It was a freezing evening in New York as sleek black limousines with tinted windows disgorged their passengers in front of Christie’s Rockefeller Center saleroom in New York. As the visitors hurried into the building, passers-by were photographing the reflecting orange flanks of the ten-foot high, polished steel Balloon Dog, 1994–2000, by Jeff Koons, positioned outside. The slick, shiny sculpture was one of a handful of big-ticket items going on sale in that evening’s post-war and contemporary art evening sale, all expected to shatter existing records: a Bacon triptych was, indeed, widely tipped to set a new world record for any work of art sold at auction. So the excitement was intense as potential bidders, top dealers, collectors and moneyed prospects pressed through the glass doors to pick up their bidding paddles and place tickets. Those deemed not quite as important were directed to a side room, linked by video to the main saleroom up a double staircase on the first floor. Christie’s had heavily hyped the sale with an extravagant marketing campaign focused particularly on the Koons, rebranding its catalogues in orange and placing inserts even in its Dubai sales material. The piece, claimed the firm in its press release, was the ‘Holy Grail for collectors and foundations . . . and has always communicated the prominence and stature of its owner,’ hammering the message home with: ‘To own this work immediately positions the buyer alongside the very top collectors in the world and transforms a collection to an unparalleled level of greatness.’ The promotion was taken, indeed, to a new level of hyperbole; even Christie’s head of contemporary art, Brett Gorvy, weighed into the heavy sell, writing to clients that seeing the offerings in the coming event had rendered him ‘almost speechless’. So intense was the interest in the run-up to the sale that Christie’s made a last-minute change to the schedule, adding an extra 15 minutes to the start time to accommodate the 1,400 visitors – and, more intriguingly, moving the Bacon (Three Studies of Lucian Freud, 1969) from a 23\n\nthe players comparatively lowly position as lot 32 to lot 8A. Why? Christie’s said that it meant those who were likely to bid on other items would do so knowing the outcome of the Bacon – and outside observers pointed out that Chinese buyers love the auspicious figure eight . . . The most cherished clients of the auction houses do not attend these evening sales openly: they are whisked into the buildings via separate entrances and hidden in ‘sky boxes’ overlooking the room, from where they can watch the auction and talk by telephone to the staff. That November evening, Christie’s had so many of these special clients that it built another skybox at the back of the saleroom, with one-way glass so the guests could see but not be seen – making it look a bit like a duck blind, as one observer noted. There was a palpable sense of excitement as the smartly dressed crowd jostled to find its seats – some clutching miniature balloon dogs. Auctioneer Jussi Pylkkänen started by reading out the lot numbers of works that came under financial arrangements of one sort of another, mainly ‘guaranteed’, either by Christie’s itself or by third parties, meaning that someone had already promised to buy them at an undisclosed price. As the list of these works lengthened – 23 lots out of the 69 on offer – the audience murmured and then burst out laughing. In total, Christie’s or outside guarantors had underwritten about $500 million worth of the art on offer that evening. Auction houses always start such sales with a sure-fire winner to get the room pumped up: in this case, it was the fashionable artist Wade Guyton, whose ink-jet print set a new record at $2.4 million, well over its $500,000–$700,000 estimate. Other successes followed – a Jean-Michel Basquiat at $12 million, a Christopher Wool at $26.5 million, another record, and then Pylkkänen paused, drew in his breath as the Bacon came up: ‘Let’s start this at $80 million,’ he said: seven bidders jumped in, some in the room, others bidding through Christie’s staffers on telephones. The increments – the amounts by which the bids were increased – were going in multiples of $5 million; at $100 million, a 23-year-old Korean, Hong Gyu Shin, raised his 24\n\nAuction Houses paddle. Super-dealer Gagosian pulled out after $105 million, but at $122 million, there were still two bidders in the fray, who were represented by Christie’s Xin Li, deputy chairman Asia, and Lock Kresler, head of private sales. Pylkkänen’s hammer finally fell at $127 million for Kresler as the room applauded; he was later revealed to have been bidding for the New York dealer William Acquavella. Christie’s staff – all wearing the obligatory black – scurried to a small knot of journalists standing on one side of the room to give them the final price including fees: $142.2 million. Within minutes a newsflash had gone out: the price set a new record for any work of art at auction, smashing the previous record holder, Munch’s The Scream, 1895, which had made almost $120 million at Sotheby’s just 18 months before (Sotheby’s New York, 2 May 2010), although if adjusted for inflation, Van Gogh’s Portrait of Dr Gachet, 1890, sold at Christie’s in 1990 for $82.5 million, achieved the higher price in relative terms ($147.42 million in 2013).11 Meanwhile, the auctioneer was sweeping on: three lots later the Koons came up. Like the Bacon, it was guaranteed by a third party; it had been sent for sale by print mogul, art collector and dealer Peter Brant; in the room, the gossip was that its sale had been underwritten by the state of Qatar. Balloon Dog was one of five created in the 1990s, and the four others – each in a different colour – already belong to well-known collectors: the beleaguered hedge-fund mogul, Steven A. Cohen, whose SAC fund had paid a $1.8 billion fine for insider trading the week before; Los Angeles collector Eli Broad; Christie’s owner François Pinault; and the Greek industrialist Dakis Joannou. The estimate was $35 million–$55 million, but this time there were only two bidders, one of them the New York mega-dealer David Zwirner. Telephone pressed to his ear, he bid up to $49 million, dropped out, entered again, but finally lost the lot to the other bidder at $52 million, making a final price with fees of $58,405,000 – a new record for any living artist at auction. After the sale, Christie’s 25\n\nthe players triumphantly announced that its total of $691,583,000 was the highest amount ever made in any art auction. A stunning 11 lots had sold for over $20 million each. And despite that evening’s buying orgy, the same crowd pressed into Sotheby’s glass-and-steel York Avenue premises the following night. More money was splurged on art, with Warhol’s Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), 1963, racing past its $60 million-plus pre-sale estimate to make $105.4 million, again a new artist record at auction. The two evening sales alone raised over $1 billion: the Bacon, it emerged later, was bought by William Acquavella on behalf of Elaine Wynn, ex-wife of the Las Vegas gambling tycoon Stephen Wynn, himself also an avid art collector.\n\nSotheby’s and Christie’s – the luxury brands of the art world There are thousands of auction houses in the world – the French site Artprice says it collates results from 4,500 of them, although the industry leader Artnet goes for a more modest 1,500. In 2013, the line-up of the biggest was: 1. Christie’s, $7.12 billion 2. Sotheby’s, $6.3 billion 3. Beijing Poly International Auction Co., 7.88 billion yuan (CNY) (around $1.3 billion) 4. China Guardian Auctions Co., 55 billion yuan (CNY) (around $1.08 billion) 5. Bonhams, $895 million.12 Another significant player in the market for contemporary art is the New York-and London-based Phillips, which does not communicate figures.13\n\n26\n\nAuction Houses Christie’s belongs to the luxury-goods mogul François Pinault, who bought it for just over $1 billion in 1998 through his holding company, Artémis. Sotheby’s is a publicly quoted company without a controlling shareholder. Poly is part of a sprawling conglomerate that includes the Chinese army. China Guardian is a privately owned company established in 1993. Bonhams is also privately owned, and has been through a number of changes since its founding in 1793. Today it belongs to Robert Brooks and a business partner, the Dutch entrepreneur Evert Louwman. Phillips belongs to a Russian luxury-goods group, Mercury, and has carved out a niche market in the contemporary art field, selling recently produced works by younger artists as well as design and photography. Its accounts are not public, but it expanded into expensive new quarters at 450 Park Avenue in New York in 2010 and has bought a £100 million building in London’s Berkeley Square for its saleroom. The ‘big two’, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, remain far and away the dominant firms. Their combined figures, depending on the year, account for about 80 per cent of the market at the top end;14 in the contemporary art sector, they alone generated over half of total art sales at auction – about $800 million in 2013.15 This is not because they hold more sales, but because the value of their sales is so much higher than elsewhere. Except for the occasional blip, and until the Chinese houses emerged as players after 2004, virtually all high-value works of art sold at auction went through Sotheby’s and Christie’s; Phillips de Pury accounts for just one on the list of the 48 top prices paid for art.16 All attempts to muscle into this duopoly have failed, most spectacularly at the beginning of the twenty-first century, as we shall see later. Sotheby’s and Christie’s have been a key element in the transformation of the art market in the twenty-first century. While the ‘big box’ dealers and a tsunami of art fairs have also played a significant role, the auction houses, with their powerful marketing departments and global reach, have been the motor of the market’s growth. They have created and stimulated demand, particularly in the emerging economies, and been the public ‘face’ of the market with its constant 27\n\nthe players flow of news about high prices, press profiles of personable auctioneers and fashion-oriented features in magazines about the specialists. Back in 1999, however, both firms were on the ropes after revelations that they had colluded to fix commission fees in the early 1990s: Sotheby’s then majority shareholder, the ‘shopping mall king’ A. Alfred Taubman, went to prison for a year, while Christie’s, which had handed over evidence of collusion, was not prosecuted, although both firms had to pay a total settlement to clients of $512 million. But with new ‘clean pair of hands’ chief executives and a rising art market, particularly after 2004, the firms were able to put the scandal behind them rapidly. Sotheby’s and Christie’s are the luxury brands of the market, and they have grown in lockstep with consumer luxury brands. They embody some of the essential qualities of consumer luxury brands: a long history; personal service; elitism; exclusivity.17 While their names have long been recognised as ‘top of the market’ in the established markets of the US and Europe, this is particularly important in emerging economies. Here the names ‘Sotheby’s’ and ‘Christie’s’ are aspirational, prestigious ‘foreign’ brands. Culturally, bidders from new markets tend to favour the auction process, which they see as more transparent; some Asians, many of whom love gambling, are seduced by the competitive element of auction. And in addition the Asian respect for longevity means that the auction houses’ extended history is an enormous plus, and it is significant that when Christie’s held its first auction in Shanghai in September 2013, it missed no occasion to hammer home its foundation date of 1766. Since 2010, Christie’s has been run by Steven Murphy, who arrived from a music and publishing background, and he brought with him a change of culture in the firm. The firm’s newest recruits now come from a business background, rather than an arts one, and Christie’s is aggressively seeking ways to move beyond the traditional ‘auction house’ profile and into a more consumer-oriented one. It now calls itself ‘The Art People’, with colour advertisements that show specialists posed very much in the Vanity Fair style of photo-shoots about 28\n\nAuction Houses celebrities. Murphy has been responsible for bolstering the marketing, ‘content’ and digital side of the business, recruiting from consumer-­ brand specialists and the publishing industry. While Christie’s, Sotheby’s and to a lesser extent Phillips are renowned today for their high-octane, ‘branded’ auctions that attract banks of television cameras, headline-hitting prices and a glamorous, cosmopolitan audience, the auction world was a totally different business until the mid-twentieth century. Sotheby’s was founded as a book auctioneer, although this was not the dusty pursuit one might imagine today: books and libraries were prestigious accoutrements of a gentle­man’s world.18 Christie’s, founded soon after Sotheby’s, specialised in pictures and furniture, and from all accounts James Christie was a remarkable salesman and silver-tongued auctioneer who was famed for his eloquence in the auction box.19 Even in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the auction houses behaved in many ways that would be recognised today – enticing clients with smart catalogues, selling art by private treaty and even extending credit to prospective buyers, but these were not the core of their businesses. Auction houses, large and small, were principally suppliers on the ‘wholesale’ market selling to dealers on the secondary, or resale, market. Major collections were more likely to be sold through art galleries than through an auctioneer well into the twentieth century, as auctions were still considered not prestigious enough. The art market then, and for decades to come, was still a secretive, closed place where business was transacted on a handshake between people who generally knew each other. Auctioneering was just as pers­ onal: dealer James Roundell, who was at Christie’s between 1973 and 1993, remembers: There were no paddles until 1988; the bidders held up their hands, and the auctioneer called out the name of the person – ‘£1,000 to Smith’ for instance. If it was an unknown person then a staffer would get their name. It was generally the 29\n\nthe players convention that auctioneers did not disclose, as the sale was going along, whether a lot was unsold. Instead they would call out a fictitious name from a prepared list, for example players for Chelsea football club! If buyers at an auction could not tell what was being sold and what was not then it made the sale seem to be going better than it in fact was.20 The anecdote reveals what a small world it was. This was partly due to the distribution of wealth, which was concentrated in far fewer hands. Until the late twentieth century, there were under 100 buyers in the world for major works of art, those that fetched over $5 million: ‘Twenty years ago, 20 per cent of the Forbes 500 were our clients,’ says Thomas Seydoux,21 formerly with Christie’s, now working in the dealing partnership Connery Pissarro Seydoux. It was a largely pers­ onal world, and one which did not require much long-distance flying except to the US and Japan, let alone knowledge of very different cultures and languages.\n\nNew money, new buyers All this changed at the end of the twentieth century. With the disappearance of communism in Russia, and the shift in China towards commercial liberalisation (even if the political system remained communist), coupled with the 1991 economic liberalisation in India, suddenly there were vast new markets to exploit – and a growing number of wealthy consumers hungry for the consumer goods that they had never had, and the desire to flaunt their money with prestige products. Today, say auctioneers, the number of buyers at a high level – over $5 million – has exploded to about 1,000 or more. ‘We don’t even know them, and they come in at the top from the start,’ says Seydoux: ‘For a major contemporary painting we might make a special catalogue to send to prospective clients,’ says one auction house specialist: ‘We might print 500, and of those there could be 100 possible, and 50 30\n\nAuction Houses strong candidates at that level.’ Globalisation means, he says, that buyers can come from all over: ‘Every season we see a different part of the world stepping up – Hong Kong, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, Malaysia, now even Azerbaijan’ (see Chapter 7).22\n\nGlobalisation Globalisation is certainly the key reason the auction houses have grown to the mega-businesses they are today. For a start they were far better placed to capitalise on the growing wealth around the world compared to dealers, as they already had a network of contacts in countries such as Russia, China and India. They had marketing machines that enabled them to penetrate these new markets far more swiftly than could dealers, who overwhelmingly functioned out of a single country. And the auction houses pack their advisory boards with well-connected people from across the world. Christie’s boards, for example, include the Turkish collectors Kemal Has Cingillioğlu, Çiğdem Simavi and Usha Mittal, wife of the Indian steel-magnate Lakshmi Mittal, the 41st richest person in the world according to Forbes, while Sotheby’s has Pansy Ho, daughter of Hong Kong’s ‘king of gambling’ Stanley Ho. It is a truism that art follows money, and as newly rich countries’ economies grew, so the auction houses were there to ‘educate’ them on buying art. From the 1950s on, Sotheby’s and Christie’s were expanding internationally: Sotheby’s was the first auction house to hold a sale in Hong Kong in 1973; Christie’s opened in New York in 1977 and held its first sale in Hong Kong in 1986. Christie’s and Bonhams opened in Dubai in 2006 and 2008 (Bonhams ended sales there in 2011). But the real prize, from 2004 onwards, was the exploding Chinese market, which in 2011 briefly became – according to its reported figures – the biggest market for art in the world (see Chapter 7). At end of 2013, Christie’s held its first sale in India, in Mumbai, raising INR96.6 million ($15.5 million), double pre-sale expectations. 31\n\nthe players Along with expanding internationally, the other major change in auctioneering was the transformation of the business base. Until the late twentieth century, the auction houses’ main focus was selling works of art at auction on behalf of consignors, and getting rewarded by commission – very low or inexistent in the case of the vendor, higher in the case of the buyer.23 They did not hold their own inventory, nor had they yet aggressively developed services to buyers and sellers or started their prolonged assault on the dealer sector. Supply being crucial in the art market, the auction houses realised that the way forward was modern art. In the 1970s Old Masters ruled the roost, with an Andrea Mantegna – The Adoration of the Magi, 1462 – retaining the top spot as the most expensive work of art sold at auction until 1987. But things changed after Vincent Van Gogh’s 1889 Sunflowers made £22 million at Christie’s in London in 1987, the first time a modern painting had beaten an Old Master. The sale sent an electric shock around the world, hitting headlines everywhere, because it went to the Japanese firm Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance. It marked the beginning of a three-year boom driven by Japanese buying. Impressionist and modern art would dominate the market in the 1980s and 1990s, but here also supply was finite and diminishing, as the best pieces were cherry-picked for museum collections, disappearing from the market forever.24 The auction houses quickly realised that the lucrative new potential was in a field that until then they had hardly touched: contemporary art. Today, contemporary art has become the biggest-grossing part of Sotheby’s and Christie’s business. In 2013 Christie’s sold $2 billion worth of art in the post-war and contemporary art category; Sotheby’s reported $1.4 billion in its contemporary art category. The two houses define the category a little differently, Christie’s treating artists as ‘post-war’ when their most formative period was post-1945; and ‘contemporary’ when they are living: Sotheby’s doesn’t make this distinction and essentially the two categories cover the same period. 32\n\nAuction Houses It seems astonishing, today, the level of controversy provoked by the auction houses’ first forays into this market. The conventional wisdom was that contemporary art was the dealers’ preserve, and only appeared at auction after a generation. But a watershed moment had happened back in 1973, with the Scull sale at Sotheby’s New York. The 50 contemporary American works on offer – by the likes of Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol – had been recently bought by a New York taxi-fleet owner, Robert Scull. He had bought heavily, then flipped it all into auction for a then-unprecedented $2.2 million total. Jasper Johns’ Double White Map, one of his target works from the 1960s, bought for $10,000, made $240,000; Rauschenberg’s Thaw, purchased in 1958 for $900, sold for $85,000.25 The auction provoked outrage and, according to Scull’s wife, a dust-up with Rauschenberg: the venerable critic Irving Sandler claimed that Rauschenberg accosted Scull after the sale and shouted: ‘Kiss me – I like to be kissed when I’m being fucked!’ As Sandler told the story, Rauschenberg never spoke to Scull again,26 but in retrospect that sale was a key turning point, leading the auction houses towards the contemp­orary art market and also turning the market into an investment or commodity market.27 Nicholas Maclean of the art dealership Eykyn Maclean points out: ‘The perfect market is where you know you have a constant supply, and only contemporary art can provide this. And art dealers will always try to support the market for their artists.’28 A further boost came in 1998, when the luxury-goods tycoon François Pinault bought Christie’s for $1 billion. As a collector of contemp­orary art and as the owner of a host of branded products, his influence was decisive in transforming the auction business. He encouraged the head of contemporary art, Philippe Ségalot, to develop his department, which he did with gusto, for example by organising the Think Pink party at Christie’s in 1999, wearing a Pink Panther tail sticking out from under his dinner jacket to promote the sale of Jeff Koons’ Pink Panther, 1988. The work sold for a then astonishing $1.8 million on 16 November 1999 at Christie’s New York, going to newsprint magnate Peter Brant. 33\n\nthe players ‘I underbid it, and afterwards someone came up to me and said, “Aren’t you insane?”’ says the Swiss-born, globe-trotting curator, art dealer and auctioneer Simon de Pury. ‘I responded: “Yes, insane for not getting it.”’29 Pink Panther resold on 10 May 2011 at Sotheby’s New York for over $16.8 million (under its $20 million to $30 million pre-sale estimate, and coupled with a guarantee). In 2004 an auction of contemporary art smashed the $100 million barrier for the first time, and set 30 new auction records for artists from Jackson Pollock to Takashi Murakami. Within a year the $100 million total was swept away when in November 2005 Sotheby’s racked up $157.5 million in its contemporary art sale in New York. And while contemporary art plunged in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008–9, it recovered astonishingly quickly. Since 2011 it has been the biggest grossing part of both Christie’s and Sotheby’s businesses, as we have seen, particularly at the high end. The majority of the 80 lots that sold for over $14 million in 2013 were from this sector,30 and they generate huge amounts of media attention and are the main focus of the major auction houses.\n\nThe final frontier – wet paint art The next step for the auction houses, after selling contemporary art on the secondary market, was to sell art directly from the studio on the primary market, a tactic that they have been exploring for some years now. One way was to buy an art gallery, but as we shall see this was not a success. Nevertheless, the auction houses do sell directly from artists in emerging markets such as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China, where the gallery system is not well established, where the benchmark for prices remains auction results and where artists gallery hop. Selina Patta Sumbung, representative of Christie’s in Indonesia, and freshly arrived in the art business from the finance industry, told me in Singapore: ‘We are going to be selling young artists’ works; we need to broaden the base of our buyers, bring in younger people.’ Asked if galleries were unhappy about this, she said: ‘Christie’s is a 34\n\nAuction Houses brand, and we need to move it along, modernise it and make it better known, not just remain a saleroom for older art.’31 The most famous, or even notorious, direct sale took place at Sotheby’s London in 2008, when Damien Hirst bypassed his dealers, Gagosian and White Cube, and consigned 218 works to the auction house. The directfrom-the-production line works were made for a new money market – sparkling and gilded, they shouted ‘bling!’ and were a re-run of the artist’s greatest hits, but with the volume turned up, so to speak. On the first day of the sale the financial services company Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, but the second day of the sale progressed as spectacularly as the first. With nothing apparently unsold, the auction raised £111 million, although subsequently various unconfirmed reports claimed that the auction house had given long payment terms and even that some winning bids – up to 30 per cent – were never settled (see Chapter 8). Sotheby’s has always maintained that the sale was a success. Other artists were thought to be interested in doing the same thing, notably Takashi Murakami, but the financial crisis that swept through the world and continued for the following 18 months ended any such projects at the time.\n\nFinancial services and guarantees As well as engaging massively in the field of contemporary art, the auction houses have been expanding in other ways, notably in the financial services sector. Because of their far greater capitalisation, they are able to offer financial guarantees to sellers in a way that dealers generally are less able – or willing – to do. Guarantees are not new, and in their simplest form – which auction houses call ‘naked’ or a financier might call ‘plain vanilla’ – are quite simple: the auction house promises a certain price to the vendor, whatever the outcome of the actual auction. If a painting fails to sell, then the auction house pays the vendor and keeps the art, either re­­ offering it in a subsequent sale or offloading it privately. If the painting sells under the guaranteed sum, then the auction house pays out the 35\n\nthe players guaranteed sum to the vendor. If it sells for more, then depending on the contract, the ‘overage’ or ‘upside’ would be split between auction house and vendor. The use of guarantees has gone in and out of fashion along with the strength of the market – in boom times they appear, only to disappear when times are tough. They exploded at the end of the twentieth century, came back to bite the auction houses and then morphed into something very different after the 2008–9 global financial crisis. In 2013 they returned strongly. Guarantees are widely credited with contributing to today’s booming art prices as they reassure vendors that they can successfully sell publicly – and reward those who underwrite the sales. One of the first people to use a guarantee was Sotheby’s chairman Peter Wilson, who in 1956 promised £35,000 for Nicolas Poussin’s The Adoration of the Shepherds (c.1633–4) to its owner. While he lost money at the sale – the work sold for just £29,000 – it achieved a record price, and the publicity generated more than compensated for the downside. Shortly after the sale, the Adoration was consecrated by being acquired from the winning bidder by London’s National Gallery, where it still hangs. However, this case was exceptional and it was only in the early 1970s that guarantees started to be used more regularly, notably by Sotheby’s to bag the Scull collection. In the wake of the mid-1970s oil crises they disappeared, only to be revived at the turn of the century by Louis Vuitton Moët and Hennessy (LVMH) in what has become a case study in commercial suicide. In 1999 LVMH, which belongs to the French luxury-goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, bought Phillips, an auction house founded in London in the eighteenth century, for $125 million. Arnault then transformed the firm into ‘Phillips de Pury and Luxembourg’, bringing in Simon de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg, two very wellconnected former auction-house specialists and dealers, to run it. Arnault and Pinault, owner of Christie’s, are rivals, each owning massive luxury-goods conglomerates. Pinault already owned Christie’s; Arnault’s idea was to create a new, sleek and well-financed competitor 36\n\nAuction Houses to Sotheby’s and Christie’s and turn Phillips into a luxury ‘brand’ that would get a seat with them at the top table. LVMH poured money into the venture, but the only way it could obtain consignments was by ‘buying’ them via guarantees. In 2001 in New York it sold 72 French and German works of art from the Los Angeles collectors Nathan and Marion Smooke, offering them the biggest guarantee in auction history – almost $180 million. The sale raised just $86 million, leaving LVMH staring at a huge loss. Its shareholders rebelled at the level of losses – reported to be $400 million32 – in the wake of the economic downturn after September 2001 and in 2002 the firm threw in the towel, selling Phillips to Simon de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg. As the art-market boom mounted, in 2004–7, so did guarantees. Sotheby’s promised a total of $902 million in its 2007 sales, double the amount for 2006 and up from $131 million for 2006.33 Christie’s, as a private company, does not reveal such interesting data. The sourcing for auction and negotiations with vendors take place about three months before each sale, and in 2008 the auction houses were caught out by the September crash. The May auctions in New York that year had been fruitful, raising over $1.5 billion. So the salerooms had made over-optimistic promises to vendors for the November sessions and were locked into prices that, after the financial meltdown in September, suddenly became totally unrealistic. The November sales at Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips de Pury brought in under half the predicted totals.34 For example, Christie’s 75-lot sale saw a punishing 37 works fail to find buyers, including Peter Doig’s Pine House (Rooms for Rent), 1994, estimated at up to $6.5 million and guaranteed. Having become Christie’s property, it was reoffered at the firm’s London sale in October the following year, where it made just £1.4 million ($2.3 million). Chastened, the auction houses stopped the guarantees for a time, but they soon crept back. This time they were in a different guise, and one that many consider to be problematic. New symbols flowered in auction catalogues, notably a horseshoe-shaped one that signalled an ‘irrevocable bid’ at Sotheby’s in 2008. 37\n\nthe players How it works is this: the auction house finds someone who promises a certain amount for a work of art. If no one bids any higher, then the bidder gets it, paying the normal buyer’s premium. If it goes higher, then the auction house shares the upside with the bidder, in an arrangement that may be 50/50 or on a sliding scale. There is a difference between Christie’s and Sotheby’s, in that Christie’s rewards the third-party guarantor just for participating, whereas Sotheby’s only pays out when the work goes to another bidder. Sotheby’s invariably couples irrevocable bids with a guarantee, meaning that the irrevocable bid, in the words of its UK chairman Melanie Clore, ‘becomes the reserve’.35 Whatever the outcome, the work is effectively pre-sold in advance of the auction, making something of a mockery of the whole process. The auction houses don’t see it in this light, of course, and argue that it has been a powerful argument to bring in consignments for sale. The fundamental issue is one of transparency, and dealers – who are hardly beacons of transparency themselves – complain that Christie’s system, when the third-party guarantor is rewarded whatever the outcome, means that the actual price published is different from the one paid, since the guarantor gets a kick-back. In this context it is interesting to note, on Christie’s website auction ‘results’ page, the tiny question mark above the price attained for the Bacon and the Koons – both guaranteed – at its November 2013 sale. ‘Price Realized is hammer price plus buyer’s premium and does not reflect costs, financing fees or application of buyer’s or seller’s credits,’ the question mark reveals, meaning, essentially, that the exact final price is unknowable to anyone but the buyer, seller and some of the auctionhouse staff. A tiny pool of collectors and dealers are believed to be supplying the guarantees, notably the Mugrabi family (see Chapter Eight), the Qataris, Peter Brant and New York dealer William Acquavella,36 something that certainly reinforces the ‘inner circle’ nature of the art business at the top. As we saw, in its 12 November 2013 auction Christie’s had 38\n\nAuction Houses various such arrangements for 23 of the 69 lots, while Sotheby’s filings showed that it had $206.4 million in guarantees on its sale the following night. Whatever the ethics of the guarantee system, it has certainly been a major factor in wooing owners of major art to sell at auction, has almost certainly led to price inflation, and has been an important factor in flipping the market, at the top end, towards auction. Another inducement offered to clients with the most attractive works for sale goes under the curious name of ‘enhanced hammer’. This means that not only does the auction house waive the normal seller’s fees of about 10 per cent, but it agrees to give all or part of the buyer’s fees – which can be up to 25 per cent – to the vendor or to the thirdparty guarantor. In the case of the Koons’ Balloon Dog mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, its owner Peter Brant had cut a deal with Christie’s to receive all the buyer’s fees up to a certain, undisclosed price, which trade sources rumoured was $70 million. The sculpture did not make that level, and in an interview with the New York Times, Brant said that as a result Christie’s had made no money from the sale at all.37 But bringing in a really stellar work of art encourages other vendors to put their works into the same sale, which is why the auction houses are prepared to take a financial hit on that consignment. However, this fierce competition is increasingly having an impact on the firms’ bottom lines: while Christie’s does not reveal profits, Sotheby’s has consistently noted thinning auction commission margins and in 2013 increased its buyers’ fees because of this (Christie’s followed suit a few months later). Guarantees are not the only way the auction houses have expanded their business model in the twenty-first century. They increasingly offer financial services to clients, from taking art as collateral against loans to lending money to secure consignments. These loans can be advances to clinch a deal, in which case a small symbol alongside a lot number, indicating that the firm has a ‘financial interest’ in the lot, often means that a loan has been made to the vendor. Rates of interest vary from 9 per cent to 25 per cent – a lower rate being applied 39\n\nthe players by auction houses on works they will be selling, as opposed to loans against a collection.38 Such financing can occur before a sale. In the case of the Elizabeth Taylor collection, for example, Christie’s is believed to have obtained a contract to sell her property well before her death. In exchange she was given a multimillion line of credit, at a time when her business, House of Taylor, was struggling.39 The investment paid off: the Elizabeth Taylor sale, held in December 2011, was a knockout success, raising $157.7 million and selling every single item offered, from a massive 33-carat diamond ring that made $8.8 million to a pair of faux fur Louboutin heels sold online for $780 after the main auctions.\n\nAttacking the dealer territory: private sales and selling shows The area which has seen the greatest expansion by the auction houses this century is private sales. As with everything else, this is not new – indeed, such sales have been conducted by auction houses as far back as their foundation: James Christie even managed to sell privately some ivory chairs and a sofa to King George III in 1781 (they are still in the Royal Collection).40 In 2000 Christie’s sold just $185 million privately; Sotheby’s didn’t even separate out such sales until 2005, when it published a figure of $271.8 million. Compare with 2013, when both Christie’s and Sotheby’s announced $1.2 billion each in private sales. In this realm, the auction house matches a buyer and a seller, taking a percentage on the way past – ‘On the same level as the saleroom premium,’ says Alex Platon, formerly head of private sales at Sotheby’s London.41 The system works two ways, with vendors sometimes choosing not to take the saleroom route and asking the auction house to find a private buyer. Discretion, the avoidance of possible family recriminations and the fear of the work being ‘burned’ by 40\n\nAuction Houses failing to find a buyer at auction are all reasons. Alternatively, buyers may ask the auction house to look out for a particular work. The auction houses have ‘got the best address books in the world,’ says Francis Outred, head of contemporary art at Christie’s. It is customary in the art world to say that the auction houses ‘know where the bodies are buried’, meaning the firms know the locations of works of art, even if they are not actually for sale. A quick call or visit to the owner, a persuasive conversation – and the work may become ‘available’ if the price is right. Thomas Seydoux says that in the Impressionist and modern field, in 2012, 50 paintings worth over $20 million were sold – 40 of them privately. The danger here is that if none of the prospects bite, then the work of art will go to auction, where it is ‘burned’ because it has already been exposed to possible buyers. And surely, I wondered, private sales cannibalise the auctions by taking works that otherwise would go under the hammer? Platon says not: ‘For a start, if five people bid on, say, a Picasso, then there are four disappointed clients when it sells. That is an opportunity for us to try to find them comparable works.’ By muscling into the domain of private sales, Sotheby’s and Christie’s are functioning exactly like dealers, and as the twenty-first century advanced, so they ramped up their attack on their territory. As well as acting as an intermediary between buyer and seller, they looked to plug other gaps in their business – such as acquiring inventory for sale and becoming dealers themselves. ‘Traditionally, Sotheby’s and Christie’s fought each other for about 40 per cent of the market. Then in the early 1990s, they realised that the growth would come from attacking the other 60 per cent, the part held by dealers,’ says Roundell. The first step in this process came when Sotheby’s and the New York dealer William Acquavella bought the inventory – 2,300 works of art – of the Pierre Matisse Gallery for $153 million, in 1990. This was gradually resold over the following years, but in 2011 Sotheby’s investment in the partnership – the remaining inventory – still stood at $46.9 million. One failed attempt was the purchase, 41\n\nthe players again by Sotheby’s, of the André Emmerich Gallery in 1996. The idea was to handle artists’ estates, but the gallery soon lost a significant one, the Albers estate, and Sotheby’s closed the gallery in 1998. Undaunted by these examples, Christie’s pursued the idea of vertical integration by attempting to enter the primary market. In 2007 the firm bought the British art gallery Haunch of Venison from Harry Blain and Graham Southern, provoking much shock and protest by art dealers, who saw this as the potential end of art galleries altogether. If the auction houses could successfully sell ‘wet paint’ art, then primary-market dealers were left with no role at all. Blain, a personable former stockbroker, had founded the gallery with Southern, who was formerly with Christie’s in 2002, and they were successfully racking up good sales both in the primary and in the secondary markets. At the time of the acquisition, Haunch of Venison was turning a £1.6 million profit on turnover of £66 million.42 Among the bold-name artists they represented were Bill Viola, Richard Long and Turner Prize-winner Keith Tyson. Christie’s owner François Pinault was a client, and the firm wanted to find a way into the primary market as well as using the gallery to broker secondary-market sales. At the time, Haunch was considered a competitor to other major players such as Hauser & Wirth or White Cube, with a good roster of artists. But almost immediately after the controversial takeover, some of Haunch’s artists left, including Tyson. Replacing them proved problematic – as an arm of an auction house, Haunch was debarred from most art fairs, hampering its ability to attract artists, who want the international exposure that fairs can give them. After a splashy initial exhibition in New York, two museum professionals recruited in 2009 quickly departed.43 Blain and Southern left the firm in 2010 to set up their own gallery after trying, and failing, to buy it back from Christie’s. Still seeking ways to expand their markets, and with the private-gallery route proving problematic, the auction houses found another solution. Sotheby’s inaugurated what it calls a ‘dedicated private sale exhibition 42\n\nAuction Houses gallery’, S|2, in its York Avenue headquarters in New York in 2011, and it organises six curated exhibitions there a year. Christie’s uses its Rockefeller building to hold temporary exhibitions, and both houses have been far more aggressive since 2012 by developing exhibitions across the world. In 2004 Sotheby’s started selling sculpture in an annual show in Isleworth, Florida, followed by another in Chatsworth House (the British stately home of board member the Duke of Devonshire). Christie’s held a first show – of work by Barry Flanagan – at Lord Rothschild’s Waddesdon Manor in 2012. In 2013 Christie’s and Sotheby’s expanded by opening private selling spaces in London, adding to those they already have in Hong Kong. Some are held in collaboration with dealers, as was the case with a sale of Yayoi Kusama works in Hong Kong in 2012, when the Japanese artist’s Tokyo dealer Ota supplied the consignments. Sotheby’s ‘Beijing Art Week’ in December 2013 also featured a number of dealersent works including a $50 million Rembrandt (it didn’t sell). As far as the results are concerned, the salerooms have taken another leaf out of the dealers’ book, in that they do not have to communicate results, nor indeed do they distinguish private sales from selling exhibitions in their annual reports.\n\nThe battle of volume v. value While Sotheby’s and Christie’s are often confused in the public mind, much to the chagrin of their respective press offices, they have different marketing strategies: Sotheby’s has concentrated on a highervalue policy, although it refuses to give the minimum value of a single consignment it will accept. Christie’s, unsurprisingly, has a tactic adopted from the luxury-goods industry, that of segmenting its market. So it seems plausible that it is financing its higher end through lower-value sales made either through its lower-value Christie’s South Kensington outlet in London or by its growing online business. The firm does not disclose minimum values – it says ‘it all depends, in the sale of a collection there may be low-value items’ – but a rough 43\n\nthe players calculation from lots sold would put the average price in the region of $60,000 in 2012. One can surmise that the powerful guarantees it was offering in 2013 – many of them not laid out to third parties – could well come from the more profitable lower end of the business. Sotheby’s sold 35,300 lots in 2013 making an average lot value of $148,000, a figure which includes wine.44 These different strategies were the subject of a vicious activistshareholder attack on Sotheby’s in October 2013, when Daniel Loeb of Third Point Capital – which had increased its holding of Sotheby’s stock (stock market symbol BID) to 9.3 per cent – launched a broadside against the company’s policies.45 Loeb pointed to a ‘deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie’s . . . Strategically, we cannot help but ask if ceding the market for lower value lots to your key rival has allowed them to generate profits and relationships with emerging collectors which they are using to compete against you at the top of the market.’ Loeb also complained that Sotheby’s had insufficiently appreciated the growth of the markets for modern and contemporary art, and was lagging behind Christie’s in China, the Middle East, private sales and in its online strategy. And Loeb called for the departure of William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby’s chief executive. Loeb’s attack particularly focused on Sotheby’s weakening position compared to Christie’s – in 2012 the French-owned firm sold $6.3 billion, up 10 per cent over the previous year, whereas Sotheby’s sales dropped by 7 per cent, with $5.4 billion. In the all-important contemp­orary art sector, Christie’s was outpacing its rival – it reported $1.6 billion of sales in 2012, up 34 per cent over 2011, while Sotheby’s in the same year reported sales of $1.3 billion, up only 8 per cent. It is not clear if there was a connection, but shortly after the November New York auctions Sotheby’s long-time auctioneer and head of its contemporary art department, Tobias Meyer, left the company – although his contract was finishing and he left ‘by mutual decision’. Christie’s also had a high-profile departure, that of Amy Cappellazzo, chairman of post-war and contemporary art develop­ment 44\n\nAuction Houses and responsible for the firm’s push into internet sales. Both Meyer and Cappellazzo announced they intended to work privately,­­with Cappellazzo saying: ‘The market has changed considerably, it’s now a vast industry, and there are tremendous opportunities.’46 Cappellazzo soon announced that she was going into partnership with the leading art advisor Allan Schwartzman and forming a company called Art Agency Partners. A third departure in 2013 was Alex Platon from private sales at Sotheby’s France, again to set up on his own. These wellconnected powerhouses will certainly be bringing more competition to the private-sales departments of the auction houses in the coming years.\n\n45\n\nThis page has been left blank intentionally\n\nChapter 2\n\nDealers The Emergence of the Mega-gallery\n\n‘You sell more if you have a bigger space.’ Tobias Meyer, former head of contemporary art at Sotheby’s 47\n\n16 October 2013: As autumn leaves scurried around London’s Regent’s Park, a bevy of muscular guards stood watch on Gagosian’s stand inside the annual Frieze art fair. On the booth were just five pieces – all by Jeff Koons, and all extremely pricey. One was a painting and the other four were sculptures, including the shiny Sacred Heart (Blue/ Magenta), a candy-shaped treat with a bright bow; an upright lobster; a cat hanging in a sock; and the final one, a confection of bright yellow rubber ducks suspended in a tyre. The most expensive piece was the heart, priced at a toothsome $22 million (in an edition of three plus one artist’s proof ); the lobster was around $7 million, and the ducks were priced at $5 million. The guards were window-dressing, to an extent, as it was unlikely anyone would try to lift them off the stand; they were mainly there, the guards explained to enquirers, to prevent sticky fingers sullying the perfectly polished pieces. The reason for the muscle-flexing was more a power play between two art dealers – the ‘king’, Larry Gagosian, who despite his vast empire was just beginning to show some cracks, and the heir apparent to the title, the German-born, New York dealer David Zwirner, whose booth was smack-bang opposite Gagosian’s at the fair. Earlier in the year Zwirner had held an exhibition of sculptures from Koons – white plaster figures holding shiny blue gazing balls such as one might see in a garden centre – despite Gagosian representing him. It was not the only chink in the Gagosian armour: earlier in the year, Zwirner had snaffled the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama from Gagosian. And the previous year Gagosian had lost representation of Damien Hirst as well as being involved in some damaging, publicly reported lawsuits. Gagosian was not taking this lying down, of course: at the same time as the Gazing Ball exhibition, he mounted his own, much bigger show of Koons’ work, including three shiny balloon animals up to 12-foot tall, ‘Lined up,’ as critic Jerry Saltz noted: ‘like cabin cruisers 49\n\nthe players at a boat show.’48 Six months later, Koons became the most expensive living artist at auction – and Gagosian still represents him. The battle lines were drawn: the outcome is still being played out. The art market has seen two seismic shifts of power and money in this century: firstly, the rise of the auction houses, as we saw in Chapter 1, and their increasing encroachment on the dealers’ territory. The second is the polarisation of the dealer world, with the emergence of a few ‘mega-galleries’, with multiple spaces in different countries, staff counts of 100 or more, tens of dozens of artists on their rosters and attendance at a dozen or more fairs a year. They have the means to hire renowned curators, produce museum-quality non-selling exhibitions accompanied by swanky catalogues – and ensure that their artists get the best possible endorsements, both in the for-profit and the not-forprofit fields. At the same time, and in contrast to the monolithic auction market, dominated by the Sotheby’s/Christie’s duopoly, the rest of the dealer world is highly fragmented. It remains highly individualistic, with relationships still very personal in nature. Art economist Dr Clare McAndrew reckons there are roughly 295,000 art dealers in the world,49 a figure that does not, however, reflect the reality that only 10 per cent account for 60 per cent of the market. McAndrew says that just a handful (1 per cent) make sales of over $70 million every year. The bulk of dealers (90 per cent) are small businesses with under $1.4 million in annual turnover. While her research covers all dealers, from those handling antiquities to galleries representing young emerging artists, contemporary art is the field of all the major art galleries today, and is a direct reflection of the boom in the market for post-war and contemporary art. This in turn reflects two things: firstly, with the growth of the overall market for art, only contemporary artists can feed demand with a continuous supply; and secondly, a profound shift in the profile of wealth, taste and art collecting, which we shall look at in Chapter 4. 50\n\nDealers Things were not always thus. Contemporary art used to be a minor part of the art market, with the major money going into Old Masters and modern art. Dealers did not have the status they have today: Gilbert Edelson, one of the founders of the Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), recounts that in the early 1960s museums required dealers to use the side entrance when visiting: ‘They were considered a bit shady,’ he says.50 ‘The real taste-makers early on were the museum committees, perhaps even more so than the dealers,’ says Adam Sheffer, director at the New York gallery Cheim & Read.51 The shift from museums being the taste arbiters to dealers setting the agenda happened gradually, and was mirrored by the shift from the dealers’ role of buying and reselling to representing contemporary artists. That has continued to develop, ultimately leading to an identification of the artist with a gallery that has become today’s ‘branding’. One significant element that changed the contemporary art world, and which set the stage for what would happen in the twenty-first century, was 1980s prosperity and Wall Street. This boom period of ‘greed is good’, the catchphrase from the 1987 film Wall Street, washed into the art market as into other sectors. This was a period of outrageous speculation, art funds and highly leveraged buying by the Japanese, particularly between 1987 and 1990. While the focus was still mainly on Impressionist painters such as Van Gogh and Renoir, the heightened interest in art and the huge prices it was achieving also impacted on the contemporary market. Artists such as Julian Schnabel (whose work is recognisable in some of the shots from the film) became feted celebrities – ‘arrogant rock stars’, says Olav Velthuis, author of Talking Prices.52 ‘It was a moment where power in the boardroom was associated with the finer things in life, along with buying real estate and art – they were part of the trappings of wealth,’ says Sheffer. The long art-market slump that followed the 1990 property crash – a time when according to dealers sales came to a complete stop – was also the period that saw the beginnings of what have become today’s 51\n\nthe players mega-dealers. In the later days of the ‘superstar artist’ phenomenon, Larry Gagosian was building his empire, having earned his nickname of ‘Go-Go’ because of his aggressive pursuing of art on the resale market in the 1980s. He was the trailblazer for this new breed of dealer, the others being Hauser & Wirth, Zwirner, White Cube and Pace. All operate on the primary market, representing living artists, handling secondarymarket works, and most look after artists’ estates, which can be highly lucrative.53 Only one, White Cube, does not – yet – handle any estates; its then exhibitions director, Tim Marlow, said: ‘Actually it’s probably because the artists we work with are all alive and they’re all the same age as I am or Jay [Jopling, owner of the gallery] is . . . we can’t really go to them and say when you die can we have your estate.’54 These mega-dealers have multiple locations around the world,55 from Beijing and Hong Kong to São Paulo, Beverly Hills and a cluster of European locations such as Athens, Paris, Zurich and Rome. These ‘big box’ galleries almost completely control the artists at the top end of the contemporary art market, and maintain their markets, if necessary, when works appear at auction. Their global spread has also had the effect of concentrating the market on a few well-known artists. ‘You buy the same art whether you are in Russia or China,’ says Thomas Seydoux: ‘There is a conformity of the global market, of taste and buyers, and it’s due to the internet, and also partly due to decorators; they all do the same work for clients.’ This homogenisation has the effect, of course, of driving the prices for a few top artists higher and higher – at least, while the boom in contemporary art lasts. As well as spreading globally, the big dealers have also spread physically by opening immense new galleries – sometimes on an astonishing scale. In New York in 2013, Hauser & Wirth opened a 24,700 square foot gallery on 18th Street in a former discotheque and roller rink. Its entrance is like a temple – up four broad flights of steps alongside walls adorned with Martin Creed candy-coloured stripes. At the top, almost hidden by a vast desk, are the receptionists, while above them 52\n\nDealers flash blown-up images of all the gallery artists. The cavern­ous space was inaugurated with a sprawling exhibition by Dieter Roth, complete with a jumbled artist’s studio with one of the artist’s sons actually working away at a table at the back. In 2014, Hauser will increase its empire with Durslade Farm in Somerset, set in 100 acres of farmland around a group of listed buildings – a farmhouse, stables, cow sheds, piggery, threshing barn and other outbuildings. Back in New York, two blocks away from Hauser’s roller rink, another gigantic art space rose in 2013 from a destroyed three-floor parking garage. David Zwirner called in his favoured architect, Annabelle Selldorf, to create a museum-like locale. Rising to five storeys with a roof garden above, the gallery boasts a series of dazzling, almost featureless white spaces of minimalist elegance, and suitably kicked off with a Dan Flavin show. It is Zwirner’s third such gallery in the district, giving him a total of 70,000 square feet of exhibition space. Beating them all is, of course, Larry Gagosian. Just being taken on by Gagosian – who waits until another dealer has nurtured a budding talent, and then pounces – can boost an artist’s earnings by at least 20 per cent immediately and, longer-term, can confer superstar status, turning the artist into a ‘brand’. Gagosian, as noted in the Prologue, runs 13 galleries, spread through three continents, handling 77 artists or estates. Nothing pre-destined Gagosian for this: he does not come from an art background; he built up his empire through a sharp eye, acute business sense and a ferocious determination to succeed. ‘He is completely insecure because of his family background; you need to understand that. That’s what lies behind his driving ambition,’ says one art dealer.56 A number of years ago at a panel in Dubai, Gagosian recounted two anecdotes, one concerning his wardrobe as an adolescent, and one concerning an early collection of coins as a young man. In both cases he proudly showed off his possessions – only for the person to whom he was showing them to reveal that he had something much better. So he quietly wrapped up his things, he said, and put them away. 53\n\nthe players The story of Gagosian’s climb to his present position (he is worth $300 million, according to various sources, and Forbes published his firm’s turnover at $925 million in 2012)57 has been often recounted. As mentioned, his career was launched in the early 1970s when he started selling posters while working as a car park attendant. By 1979 he had opened a gallery in New York and already had reeled in clients such as Eli Broad, the housing billionaire and collecting kingpin of Los Angeles, and producer Douglas Cramer, selling them works on the secondary market. But the key moment was the meeting with art dealer Leo Castelli in 1980. ‘He absolutely engaged Leo and Leo was absolutely fascinated by Larry . . . he loved being around him, he loved his energy, he loved his dynamism and they went into business together at 65 Thompson,’ says Sheffer. In her biography of Castelli, Annie Cohen-Solal gives an example of Gagosian’s chutzpah: walking together, Castelli had shaken hands with a modestly dressed man. Gagosian continues the story: ‘We walked on, and I asked him, “Who was that man?” “There’s no one like him,” he replied, “He’s one of today’s greatest collectors!” So I asked him, “Why don’t you introduce me?” and we went back, and he said: “This is Larry Gagosian, this is Si Newhouse.” I asked Si for his telephone number and wrote it on my pack of cigarettes, and the following day, I called him.’58 In 1988, Gagosian spent a sensational $17 million buying Jasper Johns’ False Start at Sotheby’s sale of the Ganz collection – for Si Newhouse, who in the meantime had become his client. Gagosian is a controversial figure: he has been involved in a number of high-profile lawsuits, which may not have put him or his business practices in the most flattering light. He is currently engaged in a court battle with the billionaire collector Ron Perelman over the purchase of a Jeff Koons sculpture (see Chapter 8), and he is not a member of the invitation-only Art Dealers Association of America. London dealer James Roundell defends him, however: 54\n\nDealers Gagosian has really raised and kept the profile of the art gallery at the top; without him the market would be much weaker. He’s a good thing for the commercial market, he lends it glamour and a ‘face’ and his galleries give depth and variety to the art that is for sale in the contemporary market. The PR departments of the major auction houses would like people to believe that all the market activity is taking place in the auction arena. The publicity Gagosian attracts helps to demonstrate that the market is not one-dimensional, and that there is a lot happening in the dealer sections of the market. Matthew Carey-Williams, a director of White Cube in London, concurs: ‘Larry has his place in the history of this particular profession. What he’s done and what he will be noted for is the expansion of the primary or the bringing together, the primary and the secondary as one and really challenging auction houses as the only people that were allowed to sell secondary work.’59 And even Gagosian’s bitterest critics acknowledge that he puts on acclaimed, museum-quality shows – such as late Monet in 2010, Lucio Fontana in 2012 and a number of knockout Picasso exhibitions. Where Gagosian’s brilliance lies is not in nurturing artists – he usually lets other galleries do that – but in turning them into ‘brands’ just as his gallery is also a ‘brand’. He sells to many of the world’s biggest collectors, including the billionaire hedge-fund manager Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, record executive David Geffen and publisher Peter Brant, to name but a few. With an impressive roster of clients and a rich list of big-grossing artists, plus connections to art historian Diana Widmaier Picasso and lucrative estates such as that of Robert Rauschenberg, Gagosian has dominated the market since the 1990s. In 2013 his empire ran to 153,000 square feet (14,200 square metres), more, noted The Art Newspaper,60 than the entire exhibition space of Tate Modern, including the oil tanks. And what he has understood, as the party described in the Prologue demonstrates, is that you have 55\n\nthe players to spend money to make money. A Gagosian party – its ultra-thick invitation card sometimes delivered by special courier – is the place to be seen, in the best location, with the best people.\n\nGetting bigger . . . and bigger While Gagosian’s real-estate empire beats that of his fellow ‘megadealers’, Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, Pace and White Cube are expanding physically, as outlined earlier in this chapter. These rival galleries are also run by larger-than-life figures: David Zwirner, in contrast to Gagosian, comes from an art background: his father was the wellknown German dealer Rudolf Zwirner. Ivan Wirth, from Switzerland, is married to Manuela, daughter of the department-store magnate and art collector, Ursula Hauser. Pace is in the hands of father-and-son Arne and Marc Glimcher, Arne having started the gallery in 1960 in Boston. White Cube belongs to the well-connected Jay Jopling, son of a British cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher. The sheer size of these galleries is a major characteristic of the art trade in the twenty-first century. Asked why the physical space of a gallery is so important, Sotheby’s former auctioneer Tobias Meyer once told me: ‘You sell more if you have a bigger space.’ Artists in the twenty-first century want galleries on the scale of their ambitions, and the vast white cubes deliberately evoke museums, conferring a sort of cultural imprimatur in the visitor’s mind. Tim Marlow, speaking when he was the director of exhibitions at White Cube, was, however, more nuanced: ‘Our model is not to make bigger and bigger spaces, but you have got to be flexible, you’ve got to give artists something that is ambitious enough, that doesn’t feel like a small scale, domestic-market-driven space. That is not going to make a reputation for an artist and it’s certainly not going to make an impact in a place like Hong Kong or São Paolo.’ What is certain is that size does matter in the art world, and supersized pieces sell for more. The current fashion for contemporary art 56\n\nDealers is driven by the demand from private museums and art spaces for high-impact artworks, which are generally on a large scale as well. When the Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi joined Gagosian, he started making a new series of very large paintings: perhaps the artist’s practice, but also chiming neatly with Gagosian’s clientele, which likes the big. Art Basel, the top art fair in the world, even devotes a mega-hall, Art Unlimited, to these sometimes ridiculously outsized works. As an example, the largest sculpture in the world is planned for Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Christo’s The Mastaba, a 150-metre-high, flat-topped pyramid made from 410,000 multicoloured oil barrels and installed in the desert 150 miles from Abu Dhabi city. Its cost would also be gigantic: $340 million, which would make it the world’s most expensive sculpture as well.61 Responding to the trend, in 2013 a new fashion started sweeping through the art world – inflatable pieces, which cleverly solved the problem of making huge works by making transportable ones. At the Frieze New York art fair, Paul McCarthy’s gallery, Hauser & Wirth, installed his 80-foot-high Balloon Dog right outside the tent – and sold it for just under $1 million. Other examples were at the 2013 Venice Biennale, with Mark Quinn’s Alison Lapper Pregnant, a blow-up version of his Fourth Plinth sculpture in London’s Trafalgar Square in 2005, and Inflation!, a whole exhibition of such pieces on the site of the coming M+ museum in Hong Kong in 2013.\n\nDealing on a huge scale: the Nahmads and the Mugrabis To the five mega-galleries we have mentioned have to be added two families who function as dealers and traders in the market: the Nahmads and the Mugrabis. Both are, in the words of New York journalist Andrew Decker, ‘the mega-dealers nobody knows’.62 The Nahmad family consists of brothers David and Ezra and their children; the patriarch, Giuseppe, known as Joe, died in 2012. It was he, according to his obituary in the 57\n\nthe players Financial Times, who ‘Essentially . . . regarded the buying and selling of art as a futures market.’ Two nephews run galleries, one in New York, one in London (see Chapter 8). David’s son Helly runs a space in the upscale Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue; Ezra’s son, also called Helly, runs the gallery in Cork Street, London. Both Hellys have younger brothers named Joe, also in the art business. The Nahmads are familiar figures in the saleroom, where the extended family, including assorted wives and girlfriends, camp in the front row under the auctioneer’s nose and, unlike any other bidder in the saleroom, dispense with a bidding paddle altogether, so wellknown are they. Heavily invested in the Impressionist and modern art market, the Nahmads have been reported to have inventory worth some $4 billion, including 300 Picassos worth $900 million, all held in a Geneva warehouse; David Nahmad was reported by Forbes to be worth $1.75 billion in 2013.63 They have a symbiotic relationship with the auction houses, through whom they sell extensively. ‘They are always one step ahead,’ says one dealer: ‘They always owe more than they are owed, by also putting works of art on consignment.’64 It is impossible to confirm the financial arrangements between the firm and the auction houses, but dealers claim that the Nahmads and other major trade buyers benefit from long payment terms and highly advantageous commission rates. While the Nahmads focus on the Impressionist and modern market, the Mugrabis, a family of private trader/dealers of Israeli origin (father Jose, sons Alberto and David), dominate the market for Warhol and Basquiat, and buy heavily into more contemporary material such as Koons, Hirst, Christopher Wool and Richard Prince. Their holdings run to over 3,000 works, with 800 Warhols alone (see Chapter 8). While attention is often concentrated on the top five galleries, there are 100 or so major dealers close behind, with most focusing on the primary market, although some concentrate on the secondary market. 58\n\nDealers An instant snapshot of virtually all the major dealers in the world in modern and contemporary art can be found by looking at the exhibitor lists for the major art fairs, which also include up-and-coming galleries in the younger sections. All these dealers operate at the top end of the market, but below them there is a vast hinterland of smaller but still significant gallerists. It is practical to separate them into three levels – the top end; then the middle tier, which might have up to a dozen employees; and then the ‘mom and pop’ stores, which are small operations with just two or three employees. In the contemporary market these small galleries are very import­ ant, as the ‘hunter-gatherers’ of new talent; the gallerist might have been at art school themselves, before setting up in business. If successful, as they mature, so do their artists and indeed collectors, who – and this is obviously a generalisation – often are of the same generation. The personality of the dealer is crucial to the art trade. As a result, there are few dynasties in the dealer world: galleries often wither or lose their significance after the disappearance of their founder, and only rarely have children been able to carry on the flame. The great names of the past – Kahnweiler, Vollard, Duveen, Agnew’s, Lefevre, Arthur Tooth, Galerie Charpentier – are no more; legal problems have beset Wildenstein and Knoedler, with the latter closing in 2011 (see Chapter 8). The problem, then, is how to ensure the survival of the business: ‘This is the holy grail for all of us,’ said Marlow, at the time director of exhibitions at White Cube, ‘That you transcend your gener­ation, working with the artists you grew up with, and also finding younger, emerging artists. And a lot of major dealers have also looked to a generation of older artists. That way you reinforce your programme from both ends.’ But while the biggest galleries, with their huge financial clout, and the smallest galleries, with their light structures and low overheads, are best placed to survive in today’s market, this is not the case for the midsized galleries. They are classically the ‘squeezed middle’, whose costs are not as compressible as in the smallest structures, and who need to 59\n\nthe players maintain a presence at art fairs in order to retain their endorsement and, indeed, their artists. Their problem is classically the migration of artists – or poaching – towards the bigger, better established galleries. For the artists, this is a career choice – the larger galleries can give them greater exposure, particularly international, underwrite higher production costs and boost their prices. For the gallery, it can be lived as a betrayal. Marianne Boesky, for example, was devastated by the departure of Takashi Murakami to Gagosian in 2006 after she had promoted him for seven years. In France, Kamel Mennour, who first showed today’s stars Adel Abdessemed and Kader Attia, saw both depart. ‘It was hard, I was depressed for six months after Adel left,’ Mennour said at a panel in Barcelona in 2013. Abdessemed is now with David Zwirner. The question to ask is whether the fact of being taken on by Gagosian or one of the other top gallerists is self-fulfilling and makes the artist a success, or whether the gallerist just recognises and develops existing talent and star potential. By being able to turn an artist into a ‘brand’, by exhibiting them around the world; by being able to fund shows in national museums, and by placing work in leading collections, the galleries can create a star. We are too close to them, for the moment, to know who will be the durable survivors in the art world, but a cautionary anecdote comes from The Art Dealers, a series of interviews conducted in the 1980s by Laura de Coppet.65 In her interviews half of the artists cited by the dealers are indeed now established as major names – Lichtenstein, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, Judd. But many others are lesser known today: Judy Pfaff, Ned Smyth or Richard Bosman, for example. And yet Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend and Annina Nosei – all renowned for their discrimination and perception, cite Julian Schnabel as the most promising artist of their time, one sure to succeed and endure. While Schnabel is still around, no one today would consider him as significant as the major names cited above. The list of nominees for Britain’s Turner Prize over the years reveals, along with well-known names today, others that rapidly dropped from public view. 60\n\nDealers How dealers control supply The problem with the contemporary art market, from the dealers’ point of view, is that supply is more or less infinite, as long as the artist is alive and producing. In all other sections of the market, the inventory is restricted and indeed shrinking, as works go into private foundations, collections and museums, in many cases never to re-emerge. (Many European national museums are barred by law from deaccessioning, or selling their holdings; US museums are less strict and do sell works donated or purchased in the past, sometime to great outcry.) For historic art, rules of supply and demand operate, and are seen at their greatest extreme in the auction room, where a few potential buyers battle it out for a prize work. But contemporary art poses a different problem, as dealers are faced with promoting the reputation of an artist and justifying the price structure. The role of the gallery is to promote an artist by ‘placing’ – the euphemism for selective selling – work in the best possible collection, making sure that there is a good geographical spread as well as prestigious destinations. For galleries trying to boost their artists’ reputations, this process of endorsement is easiest for a successful artist: the gallery will have a waiting list and chose which buyers to sell to; for those disappointed, the only other way to buy a work is to wait until one comes up at auction, and then slug it out with whoever else wants it. This explains why there can be a considerable disparity between gallery and auction prices. The market darling in 2011–12 was the hotly sought-after German painter Gerhard Richter, whose market is tightly controlled by his long-term dealer Marian Goodman, with whom he has been since 1985. One of Richter’s late abstracts (Abstraktes Bild [809-4], 1994) sold at Sotheby’s London on 12 October 2012 for £21.3 million. Goodman says she has to be increasingly vigilant about whom she sells work to: ‘Gerhard and I do the pricing together, and we’re certainly not trying to match auction prices,’ she told Art and Auction magazine in June 2012: ‘One of the things we have to be careful of 61\n\nthe players is speculators, and we are very careful about the prospective owners. This is necessary and we advise it because our prices are so very much lower than auction prices. Gerhard himself has said that the auction prices are crazy.’66 So, dealers have created an artificial rationing system to keep control over work and prices, even beyond the first sale. Maintaining the price is important, because setting a price on a work of contemp­ orary art is inevitably quite arbitrary. Unless it comprises expensive materials, such as Terence Koh’s gold-plated faeces, sold in glass cases at Art Basel in 2007 for $500,000, or indeed Damien Hirst’s $100 million diamond-studded skull, For the Love of God, 2007,67 the cost of making a painting, for instance, is minimal. Because dealers ration art in this way, they also need to control the auction process, where they cannot set prices. They have two ways of doing this: firstly, by bidding on their own artists’ work to ensure prices don’t fall below the gallery level. This ‘support’ also extends to encouraging their collectors to buy at auction when a work comes up for sale. Where a hot, ‘rationed’ artist is concerned, the gallery will try to prevent ‘flipping’ or resale for a higher price by selecting who to sell to, and by making the buyer sign a resale agreement by which they promise to offer a work back to the gallery first. While these agreements are generally thought unenforceable in law, they probably do have some weight, if only moral. This ‘rationing’ of art is normally carried out discreetly, but a court case in 2010 lifted the lid on the normally secretive deals. That year a Miami real-estate promoter, Craig Robins, brought an $8 million breach of contract action against the David Zwirner gallery, claiming it had reneged on a promise to sell three Marlene Dumas paintings to him. Court documents revealed that Robins had previously resold a Dumas painting through Zwirner, but had asked the gallerist to keep this confidential. Dumas is opposed to resale of her works and Robins wanted to be able to buy more of her work. However, Zwirner did tell Dumas and as a result she blacklisted Robins from buying any more of 62\n\nDealers her work on the primary market. It turned out that she kept a ‘black list’ and a ‘grey list’ of collectors forbidden from buying her art: the people on the ‘grey list’ were, according to Dumas ‘not to be called crooks’ but were also not to be sold to ‘for the time being’. At the next Dumas show, Zwirner did not offer three paintings to Robins, leading to the lawsuit. The judge found that there was no evidence of a confidentiality agreement to keep the initial resale secret, and the two sides finally settled the case without prejudice on either side. Until now, we have mainly focused on the upper end of the art market, and this is the part that has produced the most heat in the twenty-first century. But with the emergence of the ‘mega-galleries’ and an increasingly polarised world as far as wealth is concerned68 – the two phenomena are intertwined – there is increasing pressure on the ‘squeezed middle market’: in a panel at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London, February 2013, ICA director Gregor Muir noted the erosion of buying by upper-middle-class professionals who come from academic, medical or accounting backgrounds. And in an interview for The Art Newspaper, Brian Washburn of New York’s Washburn gallery, said: ‘People are buying the young, hot artists for speculation or the big established names from a certain period. They aren’t focusing on the middle market.’69 One sign was the closure, in 2013, of the highly regarded Parisian Galerie Jérôme de Noirmont. De Noirmont spelt out the problem very clearly in a letter sent to all his clients: The future appears to be in certain specialized niches for simple structure galleries, and in the branding of mega-galleries, just as powerful as they are big with several international locations. It would therefore be necessary to move to the next level to continue to ambitiously serve the artists in this increased comp­ etition. That would mean enlarging our premises, recruiting numerous employees including several on a high level, and greatly expanding the list of represented artists [. . .] Such 63\n\nthe players a significant development implies huge investments in terms of finance, time and energy along with major risk taking and responsibility. Personally, not wanting to leave France, such an expansion seems unrealistic to us. The top galleries are, today, very different from the operations of the twentieth century. While the personality of the dealer remains essential, they are also highly professional enterprises with forceful press officers – and most also hire outside public relations companies. They use state-of-the-art technology for invoicing, inventory management and so on. Monitors can track who is in the gallery, what works of art visitors look at first, which they look at longest. And staff behind the reception desks have mug-shots of leading collectors, artists, even critics, so that if one comes in, they can alert those higher up. A director will shortly amble by – quite by coincidence of course. Some dealers regret today’s emphasis on the money-making side of the business. ‘The missing element in the art world which has been atrophying and been pushed aside in recent years is the cultural conversation,’ says Michael Short, who has worked as a dealer in New York and London: ‘The reason why this or that artist should be worth so much money is because of his or her contribution to the culture, and that’s not even part of the discussion anymore.’70\n\n64\n\nChapter 3\n\nArtists From Starving in Garrets to Founding Their Own Museums\n\n‘Then artists became stars, exhibitions became events and Anselm Kiefer came in a helicopter to the opening of his show in the gallery.’ Collector and dealer Paul Maenz71\n\n10 July 2013, New York: Three days before, a number of artists, dealers, critics, actors and curators had received an emailed invitation to a super-secret event: a six-hour performance of rapper Jay-Z’s song ‘Picasso Baby’, in Pace Gallery’s Chelsea space, to be turned into a video by Mark Romanek. ‘Attendance at this performance constitutes your consent to be filmed. Everyone in attendance will be required to sign a release granting the right to use their likeness from the performance for any and all purpose,’ warned the invitation. Despite the secrecy, by the time the likes of artists George Condo, Mickalene Thomas, Rashid Johnston, Andres Serrano and Lawrence Weiner; film director Jim Jarmusch; art historian Diana Widmaier Picasso and prominent critic Jerry Saltz were being ushered into the gallery, some fans had gathered in the street outside in clusters and the police were directing operations. Inside, eight cameras were being set up and guests were being asked if they wanted to perform face-toface with Jay-Z in the roped-off centre of the space. The reference was clear – Jay-Z was inspired for his video by performance artist Marina Abramović’s The Artist is Present, which saw her sitting in MoMA facing visitors for a total of 736 hours (14 March–31 May 2010). Jay-Z finally entered the room dressed in a simple white shirt with a prominent gold necklace, bracelet and watch; as the waiting crowd whooped and applauded, he stepped lightly on to the platform and started rappi"
