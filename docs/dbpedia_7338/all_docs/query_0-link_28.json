        "text": "J ulieta Gonz√°lez, the artistic director of the Museo Jumex in Mexico City, is a key member of a community of museum curators transforming the way we see Latin America‚Äôs cultural history. She decided to take the job in July 2015, in the wake of a widely-reported controversy caused by the museum‚Äôs cancellation of a Hermann Nitsch retrospective. Pressure from animal rights activists, angered by the Austrian artist‚Äôs use of blood and carcasses, led to the resignation of her predecessor, Patrick Charpenel. Since then, Gonz√°lez has brought her knowledge and experience to the Jumex‚Äôs ambitious endeavor ‚Äì to support contemporary Mexican art and function as an incubator for cultural innovation.\n\nShe now heads one of the region‚Äôs most recognised and well-funded institutions. The Museo Jumex was founded in 2013 by Eugenio L√≥pez Alonso, a member of the multi-billion-dollar Grupo Jumex family. L√≥pez had spent 20 years amassing a 2,700-work collection of Latin American and international contemporary art, focused on work from the 1960s onwards. Originally housed in the Jumex factory in the suburbs of Mexico City (the Galeria Jumex, still open today by appointment), these works became the heart of the elegant David Chipperfield-designed structure in the neighborhood called Nuevo Polanco.\n\nThe Jumex Museum holds a privileged position in the city as a privately funded institution. This contrasts with the network of museums managed by the country‚Äôs Secretar√≠a de Cultura, which continues to enact budget cuts. According to Gonz√°lez, museums like the Museo Jumex, and the public, university-run museum Museo Universitario Arte Contempor√°neo ‚Äìwhere Cuauht√©moc Medina is the chief curator‚Äì are key to bringing international exhibitions to Mexico and creating exhibitions from Mexico that will travel abroad.\n\nGonz√°lez was born in Venezuela. Initially studying architecture, she earned an MA in cultural studies at Goldsmiths, London, and was a curatorial fellow at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. According to Gonz√°lez, her path to her position at the Museo Jumex, and in Mexico more broadly, began in the three years she spent at the Tate Modern in London (2009‚Äì12), as the museum‚Äôs associate curator of Latin American Art (following in the footsteps of MUAC‚Äôs Medina).\n\nAt the Tate she greatly expanded the collection of works from Latin America, building upon Medina‚Äôs legacy, and transforming the institution‚Äôs collection into one of the most diverse and comprehensive in the world. This dedication to the region‚Äôs contemporary art history has become a driving force in Gonz√°lez‚Äôs career: ‚ÄúIn a sense my life‚Äôs work‚Äù. She began to research how artists in Latin America, and more specifically Brazil, rooted their practice in local knowledge and culture rather than Western art movements. ‚ÄúMy strategy was to recover a series of artistic practices in Latin America, the understanding of which had until then been consigned to the rubric of conceptualism, which I find reductive and limiting,‚Äù Gonz√°lez says.\n\nGonz√°lez is part of a group of Latin American curators working around the world ‚Äì a list that includes curators such as Medina, the independent curator Gerardo Mosquera, formerly of the New Museum, and Mari Carmen Ram√≠rez, a chief curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston ‚Äì who are pioneering new ways of understanding Latin American art history. Curators in this group have all created landmark exhibitions showing the ways in which artists from the region have integrated local codes, derived from popular culture, pre-Colombian history, and the impact of dictatorship, into their work as a means of resisting the authority of Western avant-garde practices, and instead bringing in a local audience and creating a sense of social urgency and situated identity.\n\nAn early contribution to this greater trend came with Gonz√°lez‚Äôs 2013 exhibition Juan Downey: A Communications Utopia, which she curated at the Museo Tamayo Arte Contempor√°neo, also in Mexico City. In this show, Gonz√°lez framed the Chilean artist‚Äôs work, which had up until that point been understood in terms of Western video art practice, in the context of how technology was used in Latin America during the Cold War. ‚ÄúIt was informed by my curiosity for finding new associations and relations within an artist‚Äôs work or within an artistic movement, and creating contextualised frameworks, which could offer artworks a greater sense of specific meaning.‚Äù\n\nGonz√°lez is conscious of the role the Museo Jumex plays in the international perception of Latin American identity. Last year she mounted her most important curatorial project, Memories of Underdevelopment, part of the Getty Foundation‚Äôs Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA. The Jumex was one of the few Mexican institutions to house one of the Getty exhibitions, which spanned some 70 museums in Southern California in 2017 and have continued to tour across Europe and Latin America.\n\nMemories of Underdevelopment, which was shown in San Diego and Mexico City, included nearly 400 works produced in Latin America during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The exhibit marked an unprecedented curatorial exploration of the early contemporary art histories of Latin America. It examined the ways in which artists such as Lygia Pape, Le√≥n Ferrari, H√©lio Oiticica, and Eugenio Dittborn (to name a few) created art that responded to the corruption and unequal development borne out of a history of colonialism. Gonz√°lez describes it as a ‚Äústrategy of resistance to a logic of cultural and economic development, seen as one that renewed the colonial logic‚Äù.\n\nGonz√°lez is also committed to furthering new discourse between Mexican, Latin American and international art histories, and to establishing Museo Jumex as a place for ‚Äúnew cultural readings‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúWe ended last year and began this year with a media-oriented programme that includes Kit Hammonds‚Äô exhibition devoted to television‚Äôs impact on contemporary art and Catalina Lozano‚Äôs exploration of female voices within the Jumex collection, something that has unfortunately until now been absent from the museum‚Äôs programme,‚Äù she says. Next is a series of exhibitions that look at the ‚Äúartist as trickster‚Äù, starting with Appearance Stripped Bare: Desire and the Object in the Work of Marcel Duchamp and Jeff Koons. The show will feature over 70 works and will be curated by Massimiliano Gioni, the artistic director of the New Museum.\n\nAs well as the programme, Gonz√°lez is transforming the infrastructure and idea of the museum itself. One of her earliest projects, The Natural Order of Things, in 2016, saw her use L√≥pez‚Äôs collection to invite the public to question the ‚Äúmuseum as a structure of knowledge, as well as its classificatory strategies‚Äù. Previously reliant on guest curators, the museum has also hired a permanent curatorial staff, made in-house programming a priority, and produced innovative exhibitions."
