        "text": "DANI LEVINAS\n\nMexico - March 10, 2020 - El País (Spain)\n\nWhat does a great collector do and why is it there is not one like another? No one knows for sure, but there is consensus that certain attributes must be present: esthetic passion, keen eye, to be discerning and a pioneer, a conception of the collection as a whole that, seen integrally, reflects its time and poses indelible questions in the spectator, and of course, a taste for risk. How much risk? Depends of each case, although if we are talking about Eugenio Lopez, the more the better.\n\nThe audacity of this patron, philanthropist and collector has allowed for his works to multiply their worth several times, something he is proud of. Yet, what is most important to him is that his work has enabled a public who would otherwise not have access to contemporary artist of the highest level, to have that access and at the end be profoundly moved by the experience.\n\nLopez Alonso is not an orthodox collector. He wasn’t destined to be one. He says whatever he feels like saying, because he gives very few interviews and because his profile resembles more that of a rock star than a man of sophistication and culture. It is not what he is used to and yet when Lopez speaks, he is open, entertaining and captivating.\n\nIn this case, he talks for over 60 minutes in his fabulous home in Lomas de Chapultepec, Mexico City, built in 1976 and renovated in 2015 by Luis Bustamante, where, in his library, he welcomes El Pais. Everything here is cutting edge contemporary, and because of the excellence that surrounds us, it gives the impression that each detail was conceived by itself and that the hand that leads it were an unexpected and indefatigable reincarnation of Lorenzo de Medici.\n\nDressed completely in black, this Mexican born collector starts the interview exhibiting the edges of an apparently vain character. However, as we start conversing, the shell begins to give way. Lopez reveals, that behind the façade, there is a very personable man, proud that things have gone well in his life, and above all, a socially sensitive man, personally and artistically.\n\nInheritor and multiplier of one of the great fortunes of his country, Lopez acquired works of incalculable value during the crisis, among them those of consecrated artists such as Cy Twombly and Roy Lichtenstein. Moreover, he never speculated with the works he purchased, rather he followed the instinct that guides all great collectors, and democratized the access to art through his Jumex Foundation for Contemporary Art and later with the Jumex Museum founded in 2013, a majestic legacy for his country.\n\nThe Jumex Museum has exhibited James Turrell, Marcel Duchamp, Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol -the Warhol of the wildness of the 60’s- among others that form the 3,000-piece Lopez’ collection.\n\nHe is a member of the board of such relevant institutions as the Tamayo Museum and the MOCA Los Angeles and has been honored with multiple prizes and tributes for the excellence of his collection and his philanthropic endeavors. Maybe that is why each answer he gives is direct and sincere, a haven.\n\nLopez throws one of the most pleasing darts of the evening. “The first art piece I acquired was by Roberto Cortazar in 1990. I had been drawn to his work and from the time I first saw it I began to feel this mindset not only towards collecting, but to have something appealing and beautiful, something that would be mine at a time when I was just 22 years old. However, I did not start collecting seriously until 1994 when I came to the United States. And this gave me great pleasure, to start seeing artists without my knowing about them was a fantastic stimulus”, he asserts.\n\nAnd then he adds: “In the beginning, Esthella Provas and Patricia Marshall helped me, but I didn’t fully understand what this was about until I went to an auction house. There I understood that it was a far-reaching world and that I should know it thoroughly. The most amazing thing that happened to me in life is to have the parents I had, who once again showed who they were. My father, who knew about the masters such as Goya and Velazquez but knew nothing about contemporary art not withstanding being an intelligent man with almost infallible instincts, supported me”.\n\n“In the beginning of the 90’s -Lopez continues- the art market’s value suffered a huge drop, and I was seeing beautiful (fascinating?) works as I traveled to meet gallerists, to visit museums and biennials, and read incessantly about the history of art. So, even though I evaluated the economic factor, and it is true that there are works that 25 years later have increased their worth enormously, this universe interested me for passion rather than for investment”. He clarifies that he is normally more attracted to an abstract language than a figurative, although there really isn’t an element that he can point to a priori that determines which work he chooses, which leads him to collect pieces from renowned artists as well as emerging artists.\n\n“In the marketplace there is ample offer, there are fairs, auctions and galleries. It’s impossible to buy everything from everyone, right?”, he adds smiling. Amidst compliments and personal idols such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning and Antoni Tapies, he places the departing point for his collection on abstract expressionism. Towards the end of the 90’s, because there was no more room in his apartment and because of the importance his collection had acquired, it folded into the gallery of the Jumex factory in Ecatepec, and later became the Jumex Foundation, an effort that was applauded by the international press before it was recognized nationally. All leading up to the inauguration of the museum in Mexico City, which left Lopez Alonso with such a deep emotional imprint that today, between chuckles, he compares it to a postpartum experience.\n\nWhat happens after the birth, even if it’s years later? One answer is what each philanthropist decides what will be the ultimate destiny of his collection. “The idea is for the collection to stay in Mexico and for it to continue. How to fund this is something I have yet to decide”, he underlines.\n\nThe most social facet of this collector is clear in his scholarships for young people to study abroad and in the system, he uses to subsidize free access to his museum.\n\nServing as an unexpected end and with conceptual coherence, Eugenio Lopez adds, “The first time I saw a Cy Twombly I was captivated: the truth is no one in the world enthralls me as much as he does. Moreover, if things go well in the country, in the business and in my life -because one depends only on oneself- the future will be brilliant. Further from the vanity of what one does, there are moments that surprise you to the core, as when a very emotional woman thanked me for giving her the opportunity to see a Jeff Koons in person in our Mexico. I remember the way she said it and get goosebumps. It is then you confirm this is well worth the effort.” Perhaps this is his way to show that he never repeats himself."
