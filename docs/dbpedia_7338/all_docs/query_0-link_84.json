        "text": "Art Toronto\n\nArt Toronto is pleased to announce FOCUS: LATIN AMERICA, a curated section of the fair highlighting galleries and projects from across Mexico, Central, and South America.\n\nFOCUS: LATIN AMERICA is presented in partnership with Americas Society, New York.\n\nMexico City and Berlin-based independent curator Abaseh Mirvali is responsible for the 2015 curatorial project. Currently, she is curating a solo show of Canadian-Iranian artist Abbas Akhavan for FLORA ars+natura, in Bogotá, Colombia, for spring 2016, as well as an exhibition of the Brazilian artist Jac Leirner for Fondazione Giuliani in Rome for the fall of 2016.\n\nShe curated the first exhibitions in Latin America of the Turner Prize winner, artist Simon Starling, presented in the Luis Barragán House and Studio, and the Experimental Museum, El Eco, in Mexico City in 2015. She is the author of the concept & program development of the 2013 edition of The Biennial of the Americas where she served as CEO, Executive Director and Comisaria from 2011 to 2013. Between 2005 and 2008, at the invitation of Eugenio López Alonso, Ms. Mirvali was Executive Director of the Fundación/Colección Jumex, where she consolidated and developed one of the most distinguished collections of contemporary art for a private institution in Latin America.\n\nThis presentation will exhibit works by Eduardo Basualdo (ARG), Matías Duville (ARG), Max Gómez Canle (ARG), Catalina León (ARG), Mateo López (COL) and Milena Muzquiz (MX), all of whom are being exhibited in Toronto for the first time.\n\nNicole Franchy, From the series Infiernillo II. Collage on cotton paper, 200 x 100 cm.\n\nCourtesy of the artist and Gonzalez Y Gonzalez Gallery, Lima, Peru and Brussels, Belgium\n\nOf the project Mirvali writes: “Inheriting the artistic concerns of the second half of the twentieth century, where artists began to challenge the integrity of the two-dimensional work of art, the traditional painting on canvas, and its frame,(1) the selected artists for this presentation explore the limits of traditional disciplines such as painting, sculpture, drawing, to go beyond them. They take the concept and experiment with the physical nature of the canvas, the frame, the paint and other materials and in doing so challenge the viewer to negotiate a new relationship with the works. The curatorial concept envisioned is inspired by artists whose language presents a dialogue between art and architecture, a questioning of reality, expansion of the traditional languages and a demand that the viewer engage more closely with the works. The presentation is more a display of six solo artist presentations that share concerns about the artistic process and the need to go beyond the traditional artistic techniques. These artists leave behind the folklore, going beyond the stereotypes that sometimes are associated with the work by artists from Latin American and simply focus on their practice.”\n\n[1] The Twentieth Century: Painting to object, Tate Gallery.\n\nEight Participating Galleries\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the participation of eight galleries from across Latin America:\n\nGalería Enrique Guerrero (Mexico City, Mexico)\n\nGalería Lucía de la Puente (Lima, Peru)\n\nGalería Machete (Mexico City, Mexico)\n\nGalería Baobab (Bogotá, Colombia)\n\nGonzalez Y Gonzalez (Lima, Peru and Brusseles, Belgium)\n\nRevolver Galería (Lima, Peru)\n\nYael Rosenblut Gallery (Santiago, Chile)\n\nQuimera del Arte (Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n\nPLATFORM Lecture Series\n\nConcurrent programming for FOCUS: LATIN AMERICA includes lectures and panel discussions by leading international artists and curators.
