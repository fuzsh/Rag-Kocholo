Eugenio López Alonso, John Baldessari, María Minera, Jessica Morgan, Juan Villoro, Rosario Nadal

This book is an introduction for all of those who are not familiar with the past, present and future of Fundación / Colección Jumex (today Fundación Jumex Arte Contemporáneo), who might be wondering who we are, and more importantly, where we are going at a time when new standards and criteria are emerging, and collecting is being redefined; an era in which everything is being questioned, including the role of private collections and organizations; when globalization and geographic expansion have forced cultural institutions to assume new challenges and opportunities; and in which the rapid growth of the contemporary art world has pushed us to create partnerships and develop and expand our research, and especially, our educational programs. Through their texts and conversation, María Minera, John Baldessari, Eugenio López Alonso, Jessica Morgan and Juan Villoro have tried to contextualize the role and significance of the Fundación Jumex Arte Contemporáneo in the art world, today.—Rosario Nadal
