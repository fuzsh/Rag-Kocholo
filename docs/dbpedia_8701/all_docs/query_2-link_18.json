The late BVK Sastry has written that it was the Srikanteswara temple at Nanjangud.\n\nHappening to be in Mysore en route to Bandipur, I managed to visit the place, dragging along Sarada and the boys, all the embodiments of reluctance. The town is still old-worldly with some lovely bungalows (though a few ugly ones have come up).\n\nThe temple is essentially Dravidian. What is stunningly beautiful is a the prakaram which is topped by a series of small alcoves, each with a unique figurine in it.\n\nI am uploading this from a slow connection and so will put up more pix later. The Shiva is Srikanteswara while the Goddess is (surprise!) Parvathy. There is an emerald linga that is said to give eye sight and which Tipu Sultan worshipped to get his elephant cured of weak vision.\n\nI found no traces of any Devadasi cult here. But the temple is worthy of BNR Ammal’s stature!"
