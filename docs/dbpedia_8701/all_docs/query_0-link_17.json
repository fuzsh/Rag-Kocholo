        "text": "Born in England on June 22, 1966, Sriram had his early schooling in Madras and then in Calcutta. His bachelors in engineering from the College of Engineering, Delhi, in 1987, was followed by a masters in business administration specializing in marketing and advertising from Delhi University. Sriram then moved on to a varied career in marketing and advertising before joining his family business in Chennai. Carnatic music has been a passion for Sriram since the age of six, when his grandmother began to teach him the basics, in the family puja room. This, combined with a great interest in history, has led him to study the art form to depth with special reference to its great personalities. In 1999, Sriram, along with Sanjay Subrahmanyan, the eminent Carnatic Vocalist, set up www.sangeetham.com, a website devoted to spreading awareness about Carnatic music and its heritage. During the December music season in Chennai, Sriram conducts heritage walks in the city covering locations connected to Carnatic music. Besides being a frequent contributor on the Fine Arts in Madras Musings and the Indian Express, he has co-authored a quiz book on Carnatic music. Since 2004, he has also been the Contributing Editor of Sruti, the classical music and dance magazine. Sriram is married to Sarada, an entrepreneur in the field of education. They have two sons, Avinash, aged 9 and Abhinava, aged 7.\n\nRead more"
