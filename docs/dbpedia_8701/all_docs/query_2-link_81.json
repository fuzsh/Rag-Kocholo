        "text": "\"This is a movie that has been in Singeetham's mind for a while now and he knew that he couldn't make it if the casting wasn't perfect. He feels that the story of Nagarathnamma is going to be something that appeals to everyone, regardless of language and culture. He unequivocally thinks that Anushka is one actor who could embody the spirit of the musician and has initiated deliberations with her to a satisfactory response,\" reveals a source.\n\nAnushka, who earlier reprised the role of 13th Century warrior queen of the Kakatiya dynasty, Rudhramadevi, has been choosing films that were both challenging and have good shelf-life. She will next be seen in the cross-culture film Nishabdham. On the other hand, Singeetham has last directed Welcome Obama (2013).\n\nTo be bankrolled by TG Vishwa Prasad under People Media Factory, the untitled film has dialogues by Sai Madhav Burra. The film, which will be made in four South-Indian languages, is expected to go on floors later this year."
