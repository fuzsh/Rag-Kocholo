        "text": "Bangalore Nagarathnamma was an Indian Carnatic singer, cultural activist, scholar, and courtesan. A descendant of courtesans, she was also a patron of the arts and a historian. Nagarathnamma built a temple over the samadhi of the Carnatic singer Tyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru and helped establish the Tyagaraja Aradhana festival in his memory. Within a male dominated festival, she was the feminist aggressive enough to ensure that women artists were given equality to participate in it. She \"was among the last practitioners of the devadasi tradition in India,\" and the first president of the Association of the Devadasis of Madras Presidency. She also edited and published books on poetry and anthologies. Wikipedia"
