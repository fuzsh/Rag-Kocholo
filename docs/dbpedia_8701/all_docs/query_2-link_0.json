        "text": "When he decided to give her shelter, he thought of taking his wife’s permission. This is how their conversation went.\n\nNarahari Rao (N): I wish to say something to you. I need your permission.\n\nWife (W): You are asking for my permission? Is that even acceptable? Just tell me what you need from me.\n\nN: It’s not that. This is a special matter. From the past few days, I have come to greatly admire the music of Nagaratnamma. She sings extraordinarily. I want to regularly visit her home to savour her music. Let me know if you are against the idea. If you are, I will abandon it right away.\n\nW: My wish is to fulfil your wish.\n\nN: I shall see to it that you are not troubled by it in any manner.\n\nW: What trouble could I possibly have? You have done everything there is to do for raising a family. Our children are all grown up and independent. We have married off our daughters. Our sons are well-educated. And it is our duty to see to it that you are comfortable and happy.\n\nThis is how that great mother gave him her permission.\n\nAfter she set her mind on this, she said a vision of Thyagaraja’s Samadhi came to her in a dream one night. The very next day, she reached Tiruvayur, Thyagaraja’s final resting place. With the help of some friends, she scouted the whole place and finally managed to locate his Samadhi.\n\nAfter this, she met the concerned Government officials, obtained the required manpower, and built a beautiful Sitarama temple at the spot of his Samadhi. In the process, she exhausted everything she had earned. She sold her house in Sahukarpet in Madras and used that money for the temple. If memory serves me right, she got thirty-thousand rupees for that house. It was a princely amount in those days. This apart, she sold all her jewellery—gold, silver, and all kinds of precious stones.\n\nWhen Bangalore Nagaratnamma built her Sahukarpet house in Madras, she invited the formidable musician Bidaram Krishnappa all the way from Mysore to deliver a concert on the occasion of her housewarming ceremony. All the important connoisseurs from Madras were present at the concert as well. One of them included Kasturirangan Iyengar, the proprietor and publisher of The Hindu newspaper. The concert was a delightful success. At the conclusion, Kasturirangan asked:\n\n“Will this musician agree to sing at any other venue? How about my house?”\n\n“With pleasure.”\n\nAs soon as he heard this, Kasturirangan said, “What we are really interested in is a singer who can sing Kannada Devaranāmas (literally, “songs of God”). We have enough and more musicians here who can sing Tyagaraja compositions. We really wish to listen to devaranāmas.”\n\nBidaram Krishnappa happily agreed. In my view, this was the stepping stone for Krishnappa’s immense popularity in Tamil Nadu’s music circles.\n\nMysore Memorial Hall\n\nNagaratnamma was innately magnanimous. Envy and jealousy were alien to her nature. However, she had one unfulfilled ambition. She wanted to build a memorial hall each in Mysore and Tiruvayur. She said, “I have spent everything that God has given me on temples and pujas. In the Tamil country, I have numerous people who will give me money if I ask them. Within the Nattukottai Chettiar community, I personally know several wealthy people. Just one person can give me the entire funding for the memorial. However, they will dedicate the memorial to the person of their choice. If that occurs, what will happen to the self-respect of Mysore? The glory of the Kannada people needs to shine in Tyagaraja’s memorial as well. People who visit Tiruvayur from Mysore must have a place where they can obtain easy accommodation. Also, the memorial must have a facility for those who are interested in learning Carnatic classical music. This is the reason I have come here to seek donations.”\n\nNagaratnamma was endowed with a great sense of humour. Talking about herself, she once remarked, “I was Nagaratna (literally, “precious stone or jewel on the head of a snake”) by birth, then became a Bhogaratna (jewel of pleasure), and I’m now a Rogaratna (jewel of disease).”\n\nI said, “You forgot two more.”\n\nShe asked, “what?”\n\nI replied, “One: Ragarathna (jewel of musical ragas); Two: Tyagarathna (jewel of sacrifice). Pleasure and disease are temporary. But your music impacts your listeners permanently. It becomes part of their joys and stays with them forever. It elevates their lives. And the living symbols of your sacrifice will remain permanently in Tiruvayur.”\n\nThe moment she heard this, she folded her hands and said, “You please keep these words to yourself.”\n\n|| Satyam Sivam Sundaram ||"
