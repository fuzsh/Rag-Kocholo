        "text": "Purandara Dasa, also known as the Father of Carnatic Music, was a legendary composer, poet, and social reformer who left an indelible mark on the musical landscape of South India. Born as Srinivasa Naayaka, he underwent a transformative journey, renouncing his past to dedicate his life to the service of God. His immense contributions to Carnatic music, including the structuring of its basic lessons and the composition of thousands of soul-stirring songs, continue to resonate with music enthusiasts even today. Additionally, Purandara Dasa’s commitment to social reform, advocating for inclusivity and religious harmony, further solidifies his iconic status. In this comprehensive article, we delve into the life, music, and lasting legacy of this revered musical genius, exploring his profound impact on Carnatic music and his significant role in shaping society.\n\nEarly Life and Spiritual Transformation\n\nBirth and Background\n\nPurandara Dasa, originally named Srinivasa Naayaka, was born into a merchant family in Purandaraghada (some sources mention Kshemapura in Shivamogga) in Karnataka, India. His father was Varadappa Nayaka and mother Leelavathi. He lived during the 15th and 16th centuries, a time when South India was culturally vibrant and thrived under the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nMiserliness and Divine Intervention\n\nSrinivasa Naayaka had gained a reputation for being miserly. However, legend has it that one day, Lord Vishnu himself appeared before him, disguised as a poor Brahmin, seeking alms. Ignoring the Brahmin’s plea, Srinivasa Naayaka offered him a small quantity of food. As he tried to serve the food, it magically multiplied, revealing the divine nature of the guest. Realizing his folly and the importance of generosity, Srinivasa Naayaka experienced a profound change of heart.\n\nBecoming a Haridasa\n\nInspired by the divine encounter, Srinivasa Naayaka renounced his material possessions and embraced a life of devotion. He became a Haridasa, a servant of God, and dedicated the rest of his life to the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and musical expression.\n\nAssociation with Shri Vyasathirtha\n\nSrinivasa Naayaka sought guidance and knowledge under the tutelage of Shri Vyasathirtha, a prominent Madhwa guru and the rajaguru (royal preceptor) of the Vijayanagara kingdom. Under the guidance of his guru, Srinivasa Naayaka underwent further transformation and emerged as Purandara Dasa. The word “Dasa” signifies his role as a humble servant of God, and he began composing his kritis using the ankithanaama (pen name) “Purandara Vittala.”\n\nPurandara Dasa: The Architect of Carnatic Music\n\nContributions to Music Education\n\nOrganizing the Basic Lessons\n\nPurandara Dasa played a pivotal role in structuring the fundamental lessons of Carnatic music. He systematized the learning process by organizing the musical concepts into various modules, which included Sarali varases (basic exercises), Janti swaras (sequences), Alankaras (ornaments), Lakshana geetas (songs illustrating musical concepts), Prabandhas (compositions), Ugabhogas (lyrical compositions), Daatu varase (musical compositions with fixed rhythmic patterns), Geetams (simple songs), Sooladis (musical compositions with mathematical patterns), and Kritis (elaborate compositions). Many beginners use Riyaz app to get started with these basic carnatic vocal lessons.\n\nIntroduction of Raaga Maayamalavagowla\n\nPurandara Dasa introduced the raaga (melodic framework) Maayamalavagowla as the basic scale for music instruction. This raaga served as a foundation for students to develop their musical abilities and understanding.\n\nGraded Lessons and Learning Structure\n\nPurandara Dasa devised a graded approach to music education, providing a systematic progression of lessons for students. This structured learning approach facilitated the gradual development of skills and knowledge, ensuring a strong foundation in Carnatic music.\n\nCompositional Style and Mastery\n\nLanguage and Lyrics\n\nPurandara Dasa composed his songs mainly in Kannada, the local language of the people in the Vijayanagara kingdom. His lyrics were simple yet profound, employing telling phrases and similes that resonated with the common people. His compositions were accessible, making them relatable to a wide audience.\n\nExploration of Ragas\n\nPurandara Dasa’s repertoire featured an exploration of numerous ragas. He identified and documented 84 ragas, including popular ones such as Kalyani, Varali, Todi, Bhairavi, and Saveri, which are still widely performed and cherished today. His expertise in ragas allowed him to evoke specific emotions and create a rich musical experience for the listeners.\n\nInfluence on Hindustani Music\n\nPurandara Dasa’s musical contributions were not limited to Carnatic music alone; they also had a significant impact on Hindustani music. Renowned Hindustani classical artists like Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Basavraj Rajguru, and Vidushi Gangubai Hanagal have incorporated his compositions into their kutcheris (concerts), often presenting them as bhajans (devotional songs).\n\nNoteworthy Compositions\n\nKannada and Sanskrit Repertoire\n\nPurandara Dasa’s prolific output resulted in a vast collection of compositions, totaling approximately 475,000 songs in both Kannada and Sanskrit. His compositions encompassed various themes, including devotional songs, dance-oriented padams (featuring nayaka-nayaki bhava, depicting the hero and heroine), and rare musical forms.\n\nMusical Forms and Themes\n\nPurandara Dasa’s compositions explored a wide range of musical forms, including kritis, keertanas, and padams. His songs narrated stories from mythology, celebrated Lord Krishna’s adventures, expounded the philosophical teachings found in the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavadgita, and expressed deep devotion to Lord Krishna. Some of his compositions playfully teased and praised the deity, showcasing his versatility as a poet and composer.\n\nPopular Songs and Their Significance\n\nPurandara Dasa’s songs continue to be cherished and performed by musicians and enthusiasts. His compositions, such as “Nanupaalimpa,” have become iconic within the Carnatic music repertoire. Tyagaraja, one of the Trinity of Carnatic music, praised Purandara Dasa in his composition “Prahalada Bhakti Vijayam.” Many of Tyagaraja’s famous songs, including “Bide ninna pada,” are patterned after the compositions of Purandara Dasa.\n\nPurandara Dasa as a Social Reformer\n\nPopularizing Kannada for Worship\n\nPurandara Dasa recognized the barriers faced by the common people who could not understand Sanskrit, the prevalent language for religious rituals and worship. To make devotion and worship more accessible, he composed most of his songs in Kannada, the vernacular language spoken by the people of the Vijayanagara kingdom. By doing so, he ensured that everyone could participate in devotional practices and connect with the divine.\n\nAdvocacy for Social Equality\n\nBreaking Barriers of Caste and Religion\n\nPurandara Dasa’s compositions often emphasized the importance of unity and equality, challenging the rigid caste and religious divisions prevalent in society. His songs promoted inclusivity, encouraging people from all walks of life to come together in devotion and harmony.\n\nCritique of Materialistic Pursuits\n\nPurandara Dasa’s compositions also criticized the materialistic pursuits and greed for power prevalent in his time. He urged individuals to prioritize spiritual growth and selfless service over the desire for wealth and conquest. His songs served as a powerful commentary on the societal issues of his era.\n\nLegacy and Influence on Society\n\nPurandara Dasa’s impact as a social reformer extended beyond his musical contributions. His emphasis on equality, compassion, and spiritual values inspired a generation of individuals to question societal norms and work towards a more inclusive and harmonious society. His teachings and compositions continue to be revered and celebrated, carrying forward his message of social reform and unity.\n\nRemembering Purandara Dasa\n\nLast Year and Musical Legacy\n\nPurandara Dasa spent his final years in Hampi, where he had the honour of singing in the durbar (royal court) of King Krishnadevaraya. The mantapa (hall) where he resided in Hampi is now known as the Purandara Dasa Mantapa, a sacred site for musicians and music lovers.\n\nAnnual Aradhana Celebrations\n\nEvery year, during the months of February and March, the aradhana (commemorative) celebrations of Purandara Dasa are held on the pushya bahula amavasya (no moon day) of the Indian chandramana calendar (lunar calendar). These celebrations, observed with deep religious and musical fervor, bring together musicians, art aficionados, and devotees from Karnataka, South India, and various other centers around the world.\n\nPurandara Dasa’s profound influence on Carnatic music and his contributions as a social reformer make him a revered figure in Indian history. His music, with its soul-stirring melodies and poignant lyrics, continues to captivate audiences, while his messages of unity, equality, and devotion resonate across generations. Through his structured approach to music education, Purandara Dasa laid the foundation for the Carnatic music tradition, shaping the way it is taught and performed to this day. Furthermore, his efforts to break down societal barriers and promote inclusivity have left an indelible mark on the fabric of Indian society. Purandara Dasa’s legacy lives on, inspiring musicians, social activists, and seekers of spiritual enlightenment, as his words and melodies continue to touch hearts and minds, transcending time and boundaries.\n\nOther Famous Musicians to Follow\n\nBangalore Nagarathnamma\n\nSrimad Walajapet Venkataramana Bhagavatar\n\nAriyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar\n\nJon B.
