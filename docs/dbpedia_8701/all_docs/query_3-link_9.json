        "text": "Bangalore’s vast, uncontrolled growth over the years as a result of the IT boom has forced the city to grow much faster than Kempe Gowda’s original plans for it. The former farms and villages that once surrounded the city have all been transformed into vibrant neighborhoods and micro-towns that provide some relief to the masses of people that migrate there in search of jobs and, consequently, places to reside. Here are a few desirable areas to consider for real estate investing.\n\nSadashivanagar\n\nUndoubtedly one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city is Sadashivanagar. Numerous political figures and Sandalwood actors call it home, including former Chief Ministers S. M. Krishna, Ramakrishna Hegde, Dharam Singh, Veerendra Patil, D Devraj Urs, and Bangarappa, as well as former Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda and the founder of the Cafe Coffee Day chain, V. G. Siddhartha. Bangalore’s enormous, unchecked growth over time as a result of the IT boom has compelled the city to expand far more quickly than Kempe Gowda had expected.\n\nAll of the formerly rural fields and villages that once surrounded the city have been turned into thriving communities that offer some respite to the masses of people that move there in search of work and, accordingly, housing.\n\nThe nearest job hub to Sadashivanagar is Manyata Tech Park. It’s around 8.4 km and 14 minutes away. Malleswaram, Vyalikaval, Palace Grounds, and RMV Extension are the nearest neighborhoods in the vicinity. While Stella Maris and Thirumala Vidyanikethan are the prominent educational institutions here, Vikram, Fortis, and Apollo are the nearest healthcare centers. Orion, Mantri Square, Garuda, and UB City are the nearest shopping malls. Sankey Road is the major stretch of connectivity here. Transport facilities are good in Sadashivanagar. BMTC buses, cabs, and autos are easily available.\n\nJP Nagar\n\nJP Nagar, also known as Jayaprakash Narayan Nagar, is situated between Kanakapura Road and Bannerghatta Road. One of Bengaluru’s premier residential areas, it spans 2,500 acres and is divided into 9 parts. Some of the famous people who have lived or are now living in JP Nagar include Former CM HD Kumarswamy, politician and actor Ambareesh, Sudeep, Tara, former cricketer Javgal Srinath and popular playwright Girish Karnad.\n\nElectronic City, the IT hub of Bengaluru is 17.5 km and 30 minutes away from JP Nagar. Bannerghatta Main Road which houses many employment hubs like the Divyashree Techpark, IBC Knowledge Park, Kalyani Magnum, and Jigani Industrial areas is just 8 to 12 km away. Jaynagar, Banashankari, Bannerghatta Road, and BTM Layout are the neighboring localities. While Oxford, Sherwood, Narayana e-techno, and IIMB are educational institutions situated nearby, Green city, Invivo, Dr. Kamini Rao hospitals, and Apollo clinic are the nearest health centers. Central, Meenakshi, and Gopalan Innovation malls are your nearest shopping options. And the Outer Ring Road is the major stretch of connectivity here. Transport Facilities are good in JP Nagar. A good number of BMTC buses provide excellent connectivity between JP Nagar and the rest of the city. Access to prestige sanctuary is also easy from jp Nagar.\n\nJayanagar\n\nJayanagar means Victory City in Sanskrit. One of the oldest, wealthiest, and most well-planned neighborhoods in south Bengaluru is this one. Jayanagar used to be thought of as the city’s southernmost point. However, Bengaluru has expanded beyond those limits in modern times. Jayanagar is divided into 10 blocks. Of which, the 3rd and 4th blocks are largely commercial hubs and the rest are mostly residential. Infosys co-founder and Chairman Emeritus N R Narayan Murthy, two other co-founders K Dinesh, SD Shibulal, GM Rao- Chairman of GM Group, and Former MP Ananth Kumar have their residences in Jayanagar.\n\nIT corridors of the Outer Ring Road, Sarjapur Road, and Electronic City are just 18 km away from Jayanagar. JP Nagar, BTM Layout, Banashankari, and Basavanagudi are the nearest neighborhoods in the vicinity. Poorna Pragna, RV Girls High School, Bangalore Hospital, Ramakrishna, Apollo Speciality, and Sagar hospitals are the nearest educational institutions and healthcare centers situated nearby. Jayanagar 4th block and the Forum mall are the nearest shopping centers. Jayanagar is well connected to the rest of the city through the Outer Ring Road, Bannerghatta Road, and Kanakapura Road. Jayanagar 4th Block bus stop has BMTC buses running to various parts of the city. Autos and cabs too are easily available here.\n\nJayanagar shares proximity with the Bengaluru City Junction Railway Station. The locality enjoys decent metro connectivity through the Jayanagar Metro Station, coming under the Green Line. Completion of the Yellow Metro Line from RV Road to Bommasandra will further enhance the connectivity of Jayanagar. 1, 2, 3, and 4 BHK flats, individual houses, and plots are available within an average price range of Rs 60,00,000 to Rs 12,00,00,000.\n\nBanashankari\n\nOne of the biggest and oldest localities in south Bengaluru is Banashankari. With segregation at the stage, phase, and block levels, it’s one of the finest planned neighborhoods. The Banashankari Temple, which is situated on Kanakapura Road, gave Banashankari its name. It is situated where Outer Ring Road, Mysore Road, and Kanakapura Road converge. Banashankari is where Upendra and Srujan Lokesh’s homes are.\n\nOffices in Banashankari, JP Nagar, Bannerghatta Road, and Kanakapura Road form the nearest employment clusters. Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Basavanagudi, Jayanagar, and J.P. Nagar are some of the localities situated close to Banashankari. While Acharya Patashala, BMS Law College, and KIM’s medical college are the prominent educational institutions, Excelcare, Motherhood, and BMS are the nearest hospitals. Banashankari BDA complex, Gopalan Promenade, and Gopalan Arcade are the go-to shopping destinations for the residents of Banashankari. The connectivity and transport facility of this locality is efficient and well-established. BMTC Volvo buses, autos, and cabs are easily available here. Also, Banashankari has a metro station of its own, coming under the green line.\n\nRajarajeshwarinagar\n\nRajarajeshwari Nagar, also referred to as RR Nagar, is a developed neighborhood located in Bengaluru’s southwest. It bears the name of a goddess whose temple is found in this area. Rajarajeshwari Nagar is situated along Mysore Road and is flanked by many well-established neighborhoods like Kengeri, Nagarbhavi, and Banashankari. Some of the well-known layouts in Rajarajeshwari Nagar include BEML and BHEL. Rajarajeshwarinagar is home to actors Darshan, Avinash, Malavika Avinash, Ganesh, Amulya, and Rachita Ram.\n\nThe Global Village Tech Park, located in Rajarajeshwari Nagar hosts prominent IT companies. Kumbalgodu and Bidadi industrial areas are located between 11 to 25 kilometers. One can also take the NICE Road from Mysore Road to reach their work destinations in Electronic City. Kengeri, Nagarabhavi, and Banashankari are the areas located near Rajarajeshwarinagar. Orchids International, Marigold International & RV Engineering College are prominent educational institutions nearby.\n\nBGS and Rajarajeshwari Hospitals are the nearest healthcare centers. Gopalan Mall and Gopalan Arcade Mall are the go-to destinations for the residents of Rajarajeshwarinagar. Mysore Road, NICE Road, Uttarahalli Main Road, and the ORR enhance the connectivity factor of the locality.\n\nBuses from the BMTC run frequently between Rajarajeshwari Nagar and the rest of the city. It is very simple to find cabs and autos here. While the Mysore Road metro station now has metro connectivity, Kengeri, the closest railway station, is 5.6 kilometers away. It will be extended to Kengeri in the next months, and Rajarajeshwari Nagar is 4.8 kilometers away from the Kengeri metro station. 1, 2, 3, and 4 BHK flats, individual houses, and plots are available for Rs 38,00,000 to Rs 3,25,00,000."
