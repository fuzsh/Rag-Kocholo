One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, she has received several awards, including a Filmfare Award, and was featured by Forbes Asia in their 30 Under 30 list of 2018. Born in Ayodhya and raised in Bangalore, Sharma had her first modelling assignment for the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in 2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a model. She made her acting debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the highly successful romantic film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), which earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. She rose to prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films' romances Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012); the latter, in which she played an aspiring filmmaker, won her a Best Supporting Actress award at Filmfare.

Born on January 5, 1986, in Copenhagen, Denmark, she was raised in Bangalore, India, where her prowess in badminton reflected the sporting legacy of her father, Prakash Padukone, an internationally acclaimed badminton player. Despite her early inclination towards sports, Deepika was drawn to the performing arts, a passion that led her to drop out of her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College, Bangalore, and enroll in Anupam Kher's acting school in Mumbai. Padukone's career trajectory took a sharp upward turn when she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om, starring opposite Shah Rukh Khan. Her portrayal of dual roles won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, kickstarting an illustrious career that would see her delivering numerous critically acclaimed performances.

After publicly disclosing her battle with depression in 2014, she founded the Live Love Laugh Foundation to raise awareness about mental health issues in India. Her efforts in this area have garnered international recognition, leading TIME magazine to include her in their list of 100 most influential people in the world in 2018.

Shetty's career in the film industry spans over 15 years, during which she has appeared in a variety of roles that showcase her versatility as an actress.
