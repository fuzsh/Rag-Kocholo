        "text": "Continuing the series started here.\n\nToday we shall look at the history of one of the greatest artistes to have graced the world of Carnatic Music, one who dared to challenge a patriarchal, victorian society and emerge victorious. A true feminist, she shattered glass ceilings wherever she went, and contributed much to the inclusion of women and especially devadasis into Carnatic Music at a time when society was very much victorian in its morals. A lady who was years ahead of her time, her power and determination to ensure that the world is more equal and inclusive of women was so strong, that even Tyagaraja wasn’t spared!\n\nI could start by telling the readers facts like when she was born (3rd November 1878) or who her parents were (Puttu Lakshmi and Vakil Subba Rao of Nanjangud/H D Kote), but this post is dedicated to her fierce feminist spirit, and shall feature accounts of some of the many struggles she faced and actions she took.\n\nA. Her musical education-\n\nAs her mother was a devadasi, her father was never really around much. So she was brought up by her mother, and trained in the arts as well as the devadasi traditions. She also trained in Sanskrit under a scholar in the Mysore court, whom she always referred to as “Shastri”, between the ages of 2 to 5. Now even Shastri abandoned her out of fear of being associated with devadasis, when she was initiated into the devadasi tradition at the age of five. Unpertubed, she continued her education under her maternal uncle Venkataswami and also learnt music and dance for a long while in the gurukula of Munuswamy. It should be noted that Munuswamy was a third generation shishya in the Tyagaraja shishya parampara, through Walajapet Krishnaswamy Bhagavathar and Walajapet Venkataramana Bhagavathar.\n\nAfter this, at the age of 15, she gave her first vocal recital, and was so good, that even the Maharajas of Mysore were duly impressed. The then prominent vidvan, Bidaram Krishnappa, who unlike others of that age was far more progressive in his thinking, took her under his wing and gave her advanced training in music. He polished the gem that Nagarathnamma was, and her music acquired such sheen and beauty, that the then Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar appointed her the Asthana Vidushi, She was probably the first woman to occupy such an exalted position in the royal court!\n\nNot satisfied by this, she set her eyes on conquering Madras, then considered the Mecca of Carnatic music. An expert in both Harikatha rendering and Carnatic music, she soon rose to fame, while also attracting her fair share of detractors. She would brush them all aside, and was a most practical woman, with a fine business acumen also.\n\nWe can see how popular she was as an artiste, and also how smart she was with her finances, when we see that from the peak of her musical career (1910) to her death, she paid income tax on an annual income of Rs. 2 Lakhs!!!\n\nB. Radhika Santwanamu-\n\nAfter she established herself as a force to reckon with in the spheres of the performing arts, she began campaigning for the rights of women, particularly the Devadasi. At the height of the anti-nautch movement when all over TN society was cracking down on the Devadasis and harassing them, she boldly stood and tried her best to protect their rights and help the oppressed and harassed women. She became the first president of the Association of the Devadasis of the Madras Presidency, and took several steps towards offering financial and social support to her fellow devadasis. At the same time, she was an ardent and fierce supporter of feminist rights. She was a fierce advocate for the freedom of expression, even the expression of one’s sexuality. She argued against the victorian repressive outlook of society at the time, and strived to achieve a more inclusive, progressive world.\n\nAround this time, she discovered that great book, the Radhika Santwanamu. A poetic work by another Devadasi Muddupalani, written in chaste Telugu sometime between 1757 and 1763, this was a work depicting the Madhura Bhakti between Krishna and Radha, at a time when he was marrying Ila. It deals with the art of lovemaking entirely from a woman’s point of view, and specifically addresses the issue of how a woman’s wants and needs in every sphere of life, are deemed secondary and inconsequential when compared to a man’s wants or needs. This work of art was now almost lost, and Nagarathnamma tirelessly worked to find the complete manuscript. She left no stone unturned and worked extremely hard to find the Radhika Santwanamu. After years of searching, she finally found the entire manuscript. She then sought to republish it, and also publish a translated version. But, because of the titillating content of the work, not many were willing to aid her in this initiative. Undeterred by the criticism she was subjected to and the lewd comments now being made about her, she finally got it, as well as the translation published in 1910. As she famously stated, “I cannot let this book go no matter how many times I read it..it is as adorable as Lord Krishna”.\n\nSoon after it was published, there was an uproar. The book, published 150 years after the original manuscript was written by Muddupalani in Telugu, was reviewed by Kandukuri Veeresalingam who, though a supporter of most women’s causes, attacked some of the erotic contents of the book as being totally “inappropriate for women to hear let alone be uttered from a woman’s mouth.” Nagarathnamma strongly defended her version of the book and counterattacked saying that there was very much more titillating content included in the book titled Vaijayantivilasam, which the critic (Veeresalingam) had reviewed and accepted for printing. She protested against this double standard and questioned him and all the others attacking her thusly- “Does the question of propriety and embarrassment apply only in the case of women and not men?”.\n\nThe book was so controversial, there was a petition before the government to ban it. At that time, the ruling British government too looked down upon Devadasis, and would discriminate against them. The government records of the time reveal how regressive their thought process was. The records, refer to the book in this manner.\n\nThis book has been written by a prostitute and edited and translated by another prostitute\n\nDespite her fierce arguments and movements to prevent it, the book was banned, as were 8 other books she published. However she did have the last laugh, when after independence, her will prevailed on the new Chief Minister, who had the order banning the books rescinded. She remains one of the few to challenge the will of the govenment and prevail.\n\nC. Tyagaraja Aradhana-\n\nThis story actually begins before Nagarathnamma’s time. Approximately 60 years after Tyagaraja attained Siddhi and took on prithvisamaadhi in the large graveyard in Thiruvaiyyaru, two of his youngest disciples, Umayalpuram Krishna Bhagavathar and Umayalpuram Sundara Bhagavathar decided that an aradhana at their guru’s samaadhi was a lovely notion and would be a fitting means of paying respect to their guru. The story goes that Tyagaraja himself appeared in their dream and ordered this. Why Tyagaraja was completely uninterested for 60 years, and then suddenly hit upon this idea is a question that nobody asked, and nobody answered. Tyagaraja passed away in 1847, and these men came here in 1905.\n\nNow when they came to the graveyard, they saw that there were so many sanyasis buried there. It is said that Thiruvaiyyaru was like Kashi, a place where moksham is guaranteed to all who pass away there. So hundreds of people would come there to eke out their final days and be buried. Most graves there were unmarked, as was Tyagaraja’s.\n\nThese two were aged 5 and 10 when Tyagaraja passed away. But clearly they had amazing memory. They managed to recognize Tyagaraja’s tombstone. How? They pass by the stone and hear the chants of “Rama Rama”. Funnily enough, 100 years back when the samadhi of Bodhendra Swami in the same graveyard was discovered, then too the means of discovery was hearing the tomb chanting “Rama Rama”. So maybe all the ghosts of Thiruvaiyyaru are pious Rama bhaktas!\n\nThey erected a granite slab behind the tombetone they identified, and declared that this has been renovated by Krishnan and Sundaram. As they were quite old by this time, their disciples Thillaisthanam Pacchu Bhagavathar and Thillaisthanam Narasimha Bhagavathar start conducting the Aradhanam.\n\nNow to organize a programme, one needs capital. To obtain the money required to finance the aradhanam, they went to Madras and started conducting harikathas on the life of Tyagaraja, hoping that hearing of his life would incentivise the businessmen and dubashs to contribute to the project. And it is at this point that Tyagaraja’s life is completely twisted and manipulated. Fictitious narratives were built around him to create a larger-than-life persona. Examples include-\n\nTyagaraja passed away at the age of 32. No he did not. He lived to the ripe old age of 80.\n\nTyagaraja brought a dead man back to life by singing “Na Jivadhara”. He did no such thing.\n\nTyagaraja was a great sanyasi who practiced renunciation for a large part of his life. No he became a sanyasi three days before he died.\n\nAnd many others. To this day we place Tyagaraja on a high pedestal, and deify him, which is certainly not right. To respect a person for their talent, compositional ability and their glorious contributions is one thing, but to make up stories for the same is not. Tyagaraja is great even without these tall tales, and his mahatyam shines better when we accept him as a human who was blessed with musical ability, not as the supernatural.\n\nBut the plan largely succeeded. The Thillaisthanam brothers were richly funded and plans were made for organizing the Aradhanam. Naturally the very first decision they took regarding the Aradhanam was that women will not be allowed to participate. The next decision taken was that the Isai Vellalars would be further away from the shrine.\n\nBut things were not so rosy for them after all. They now had the money, but fell out over how the funds should be allocated. They publicly abused each other, and even sent each other open postcards filled with insults and curses. The Thiruvaiyyaru Gossip Community (henceforth to be called the TGC) was bustling. Their vitriolic outbursts culminate in Thillaisthanam Narasimha Bhagavathar leaving Thiruvaiyyaru to perform the Aradhanam in Kumbakonam!\n\nThillaisthanam Narasimha Bhagavathar dies within a year of conducting the Aradhanam in Kumbakonam. Naturally the TGC is saturated with stories of how Tyagaraja has cursed Narasimhan for not conducting the Aradhanam in Thiruvaiyyaru. The fact that Narasimhan was old and suffering from a variety of diseases was of course irelevant to the discussion.\n\nSo now the Narasimhan party is forced to come back to Thiruvaiyyaru. But they could still not make amends with the Pacchu party. They fought like the cats and dogs. And so it was decided that the Narasimhan party would come 5 days before the Aradhanam, and end their Aradhanam on the Pushya Bahula Panchami, while the Pacchu party would come on the Pushya Bahula Panchami and perform their Aradhanam for 5 days after. The two parties would never see or meet each other. And thus were born the “Periya Katchi” and the “Chinna Katchi”.\n\nThis arrangement was highly suitable for the TGC. They were being given free food and good music for 10 days. And so whenever any attempts were made by the katchis to unite, the TGC would work very hard to ensure that such attempts remain unsuccessful. The Madras chapter of the TGC would spread gossip like always, and the two katchis trusted the TGC more than each other.\n\nTyagaraja was treated like a king for these 10 days. But was completely ignored for the remaining 355. Birds would shit on his grave, people would spit paan on it, and it was just a dirty stone slab for 355 days of the year. It is at this point of time that Nagarathnamma enters the story.\n\nNagarathnamma, using her own money, renovates the tomb. She then wanted to go ahead and build a shrine over the samadhi, for which she needed to buy the land. But then the authorities, and Tyagaraja’s descendants told her that the land cannot be sold, for its an inalienable trust (especially not to a woman). Knowing that every man has a price, she then buys lush agricultural land of the same dimensions as the graveyard on the banks of the Cauvery, and proposes an exchange. It is then that the authorities realise that the trust isn’t as inalienable as that, and they readily agree to the exchange! The entire graveyard is now Nagarathnamma’s property.\n\nNagarathnamma then builds a shrine over the samadhi, between 1921 and 1926. She also consecrates a granite idol of Tyagaraja, which she personally designed and had constructed. All through this both katchis praise her and compliment her for the work she is doing.\n\nBut, come 1927. The katchis assemble and are about to begin the Aradhanam. Then Nagarathnamma walks in. Immediately, all the musicians put their instruments down and tell her that a woman has no place in the Samadhi. When she argues that the Samadhi exists as it is purely due to her efforts, they tell her that that’s irrelevant. Nagarathnamma, ever the feisty one, takes them to court. She locks the Samadhi up, there is a brawl and everyone comes to blows, and the police have to come in and break the doors of the Samadhi open to let the Aradhanam take place. They decree that the Aradhanam is open to all, including women. But the two katchis still don’t allow the Aradhanam to take place peacefully. And so she decides to take her party behind the Samadhi and perform the Aradhanam there. This party of hers was called the Pengal Katchi.\n\nNow the TGC was thrilled, thinking that they would now have a fine feast, with three katchis arranging for grand meals. But Nagarathnamma, ever the smart one, arranged for feeding only the musicians who were a part of her katchi. She and her troupe of 40 Devadasis from Madras arrived in a grand style, and performed the Aradhanam with great gusto and pomp. Also, her marketing skills were excellent, and using some trusty TGC members, ensured that her troupe was the star of the 3 Aradhanams that year. Their celebration was so grand and festive, that no resident of Thiruvaiyyaru even bothered about what the Periya and Chinna katchis were doing. They all came to see what Nagarathnamma had organized.\n\nThis circus of 3 katchis continued for a good 20 years, till 1942.\n\nIn 1940 and 1941, attempts are again made to unite the three factions. By this time, the TGC too saw no benefits in continuing this charade. And so, Malaikottai Govindaswami Pillai of the Periya katchi, Nagarathnamma of the Pengal katchi, and Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar of the Chinna katchi finally unite in 1941. But Nagarathnamma agrees to the unification under only one condition which was non negotiable-“the property is still mine, and so women should always be allowed to participate in the Aradhanam”. In fact in her will, she bequeathed her vast fortune and property to the Aradhanam trust with a codicil-” This property shall be allowed for the purpose of conducting the Tyagaraja Aradhanam only as long as women artistes are allowed to perform in it.”.\n\nHer acerbic tongue- Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, the bitterest opponent of the unification, hated Nagarathnamma’s guts with all the force he could muster. He would often criticise and insult her bitterly, insults which she usually took in her stride. After the unification, while his Harikatha performance was going on she once slowly ascended the stage and sat next to him. She then said that she has always had a wish to sit next to him and hear him perform, for she considered him the embodiment of Tyagaraja. Hearing her sarcastic comments, the crowd goes wild, and jeers and claps. He grits his teeth and continues the harikatha, but never returns to the Aradhanam again.\n\nHer determination and resolve– Once Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar jeered at her, and caustically remarked that there is one aspect of the Aradhanam that she would never be able to touch-the shraddham given to Tyagaraja. Hearing of this, Nagarathnamma decided that she would prove him wrong. She assembled a group of Brahmins, and performed the Shraddham at her house, and ensured that the Brahmins, after performing the rituals, would put the Akshintalu on her head and thus symbolically pass on all the benefits and virtues of the Shraddham to her.\n\nHer performance- She of course held her profession in high regard, and would always preface her performances with the statement “I am a devadasi, I bow to the Lord”. To her, the primary concern was always that of gender parity. She was also extremely well known for her renditions of the renditions of the ragam Yadukulakambhoji, and it was said that none could equal her in rendering that ragam, particularly the krithi Sri Rama Jaya Rama.\n\nShe continued playing an active role in conducting the aradhanam until her death. And when she finally passed away in 1952, the TGC, the trust, and all the others unanimously agreed that, for her efforts and work towards conducting the Aradhanam, she deserves to be buried right next to Tyagaraja. And so the ground was opened up, and she was laid to rest next to Tyagaraja. To this day, she remains the only woman to be buried there. A statue of Nagarathnamma was sculpted and placed inside the shrine on her tomb directly facing Tyagaraja’s statue.\n\nAnd so, that was a brief narrative of one of the most influential personalities to have graced the world of Carnatic Music. I only hope all of us are inspired by her determination, her resolve and her strength!\n\nSee you all in my next post!"
