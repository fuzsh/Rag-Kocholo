CONGRESS WILL LIKELY FORM GOVERNMENT AS IT HEADS FOR MAJORITY\n\nThe current chief minister of Karnataka, B Bommai of the BJP conceded defeat as the Congress leads in 130 out of a total of 224 seats, practically guaranteeing the Congress the right to form a government without relying on coalitions. As of this update, the BJP is trailing far behind, leading in only 68 seats. The Janata Dal (S) performed better than some sections expected and leads in 22 seats. The election saw a voter turnout of 73.19%, the highest ever recorded in the history of elections in Karnataka. And is seen as a mass mandate for secularism and a resounding rejection of divisive, religion-based politics.\n\nNOTE: THE LIST OF BANGALORE BASED MLAs IN THIS STORY WILL BE UPDATED AS SOON AS THE RESULTS ARE MADE OFFICIAL.\n\nList Of Bangalore City MLAs - Karnataka Election 2018\n\nBY-ELECTION UPDATE\n\nBangalore, 11 November 2020\n\nIn the recent by-election, Munirathna Naidu won the RR Nagar seat for the BJP. Local sources say that his victory was less about what party he represented and more in recognition of his visible good work during the pandemic, which appealed greatly to the local electorate.\n\nUPDATED ON FEBRUARY 2020\n\nThe following table is the corrected list of MLAs following the 2019 by-elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly following their resignations of 15 MLAs who walked out of the government. Of the 15 seats contested BJP won 12. (More details below in this article.)\n\nUPDATE: SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS MLAs DISQUALIFICATION BUT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTEST ELECTIONS\n\nBangalore, 13 November 2019\n\nThe Supreme Court of India ruled that the 17 MLAs (14 from Bangalore) who had been disqualified by the Speaker of the State Assembly are allowed to contest elections. However, the apex court upheld Speaker's decision to disqualify the MLAs, whose resignations led to the fall of the previous government.\n\n\"In a parliamentary democracy, morality is equally binding on the government and the opposition,\" the Supreme Court said, upholding then Speaker's decision to disqualify the rebels in July.\n\nConstituencyNamePartyAnekalB ShivannaCongressB T M LayoutRamalinga ReddyCongressBangalore SouthKrishnappa MBJPBasavanagudiRavi Subramanya L ABJPBommanahalliSathish Reddy MBJPByatarayanapuraKrishna Byre GowdaCongressC V Raman NagarS RaghuBJPChamrajpetZameer Ahmed Khan B ZCongressChickpetUday GarudacharBJPDasarahalliR ManjunathaJDSGandhinagarDinesh Gundu RaoCongressGovindrajnagarV SomannaBJPHebbalByrati SureshCongressHosakoteMTB NagarajuCongressJayanagarSowmya ReddyCongressK R PuramBasavaraja Byrathi (Re-elected)BJPMahadevpuraAravind LimbavaliBJPMahalakshmi LayoutK Gopalaiah (Re-elected)BJPMalleshwaramDr Ashwath Narayan C NBJPPadmanabhanagarAshoka RBJPPulakeshinagarAkhanda Srinivasa Murthy RCongressRajajinagarS Suresh KumarBJPRajarajeshwari NagarMunirathna NaiduBJPSarvagna NagarK J GeorgeCongressShanthinagarN A HarisCongressShivajinagarRizwan Arshad (Roshan Baig - Resigned)CongressVijayanagarM KrishnappaCongressYelahankaS R ViswanathBJPYeshwanthpurS T Somashekar - (Re-elected)BJP\n\nUPDATE: 14 MLAs disqualified by speaker. Five from Bangalore.\n\nThe following article has been edited to reflect those MLAs who were disqualified by the Speaker of the Assembly around the end of July in connection with the floor test that brought down the 14-month-old Congress-JD(S) government in Karnataka. Five MLAs from Bangalore were among those disqualified. “The disqualified MLAs cannot fight elections until the expiry of the term of the 15th assembly,” Ramesh Kumar told the media.\n\nThis is the revised list of Bangalore City MLAs from the 28 constituencies of Bangalore. This list has been compiled from various sources.\n\nA reading of our article, Karnataka Election Bangalore Constituencies 2018 Winners (click here), will reveal that the mandate of the Bangalore constituencies clearly favoured the Congress. This article (click here) provides some interesting perspectives.\n\nUpdated list of Bangalore City MLAs\n\nThe following table was most recently updated on August 10, 2019.\n\n**Vijayakumar B N of the Jayanagar constituency passed away just before the elections. (According to a report in Times Of India, Bangalore May 04, 2018. https://explo.in/2HShV6C)\n\nOn 31 May 2018, Munirathna, 49, of the Congress won the Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency by defeating his rival Muniraju Gowda of the BJP by over 40,000 votes. The election in this constituency was held later than the 12 May 2018 polling date, when authorities discovered thousands of fake voter IDs relating to the constituency.\n\nAbout the Karnataka Legislative Assembly\n\nThe Karnataka Legislative Assembly is the lower house of the bicameral legislature of Karnataka state in southern India. Karnataka is one of the seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses. The two houses are the Vidhana Sabha (lower house) and the Vidhana Parishat (upper house).\n\nThe members of the Vidhana Sabha are directly elected by people through adult franchise. The members of the Vidhana Parishat are elected indirectly by members of local bodies, teachers and graduates.\n\nThere are 75 members of the Vidhana Parishat. Members of the Vidhana Parishat or Legislative Council normally have a term of six years, and are generally known as MLCs.\n\nThere are 224 members of the Vidhana Sabha or the Legislative Assembly of Karnataka state. One member is a representative of the Anglo-Indian community nominated by the Governor of Karnataka. The state of Karnataka is divided into 225 constituencies used to elect the Legislative assembly.\n\nThe next Assembly elections are scheduled for May 12, 2018.
