        "text": "Vijaya Lakshmi Manne, our beloved mother and wife, was known for lighting up the room with her laughter, her energetic and vibrant personality, and her immense kindness to everyone around her.\n\nBorn in Andhra Pradesh in India, Vijaya was one of five children of D. Mangathayaramma and D. Ranganayakulu and raised by D. Nagarathnamma in Appikatla village. She married Kishore Babu Manne who she knew since childhood. They moved to the United States with three young children and eventually settled in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Making a new life together, she learned a new culture and language while proudly carrying her traditions. She forged deep friendships that lasted throughout her lifetime, and she was a safe haven for numerous friends, loved ones, nieces, nephews and grandchildren.\n\nVijaya enjoyed movies, gardening and flowers, board games, card games, sudoku, and cryptogram puzzles. She never seemed to tire with her boundless energy. She was often out and about with her friends and family, exploring new places, shopping and bargaining for the best deals. She had an incredible saree collection. She knew every Telugu movie and could be found late at night catching up on serials. Vijaya loved spicy food and green chile, and she always had a Coca-Cola in hand. She was an incredible cook who shared her love for food with everyone around her, hosting lively dinner parties and making dosas on the weekends with her family. Outgoing and boisterous with friends and relatives, her voice and laughter filled the room.\n\nVijaya had a warm heart. She welcomed guests and visitors as friends, treated her friends like family, cared for everyone's children as her own, and amusingly tolerated a parade of dogs, rabbits and pets. She always checked on and made time for people. With an excellent memory, she knew every detail about each person. She helped unconditionally, no matter how big the need, and was a shoulder to cry on and someone to playfully joke around with. Vijaya loved and cared for her grandkids, raising them as the lights of her life. She will always be their fun and funny \"ammamee\" who blessed us all with the strength of her heart and love.\n\nVijaya is remembered by her husband Kishore, children Kiran, Venu and Sireesha, son-in-law Pavan, grandchildren, and many cherished relatives and friends.\n\nServices will be held on Wednesday, February 14th from 9:00-11:00 am at French Funerals, 7121 Wyoming Blvd NE. Puja at 9:00. Memorial/viewing at 10:00. Lunch will follow at 11:00.\n\nPedda Karma Last Rites Ceremony will be held on Friday, February 16th from 9:00-11:00 am, followed by lunch, at the family home. Please contact the family for directions.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to a charity/nonprofit of your choice in honor of Vijaya Manne"
