        "text": "While the answer lies in British imperialism, its far-reaching repercussions were not so simple. The British administration thought of this as a solution to keep their native soldiers from being distracted. By putting a rate on the time of courtesans, the British administration was successful in protecting their soldiers at the cost of dehumanising the courtesans, reducing them to a commodity.\n\nDid you know that Nagarathnamma's commercial success made her the first woman to pay income tax? Her rags to riches story are one of a kind that can inspire every individual to do better amidst unfavourable conditions.\n\nEven though the society managed to shun the publication of her work, it saw the light of day when Tanguturi Prakasam, the then Chief Minister of Madras, identified it like a pearl in the necklace of Telugu literature."
