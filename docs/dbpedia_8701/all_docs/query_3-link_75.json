        "text": "Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, is home to a wide range of Non-Governmental organisations (NGOs) that are tirelessly working to improve the quality of life of local citizens. The city is making a difference in the lives of people living in the city and the surrounding areas. From providing educational opportunities to the marginalised and poor to taking up social causes and initiatives, NGOs in Bangalore are working around the clock to make the city more inclusive, sustainable, and prosperous. Their range of diverse services includes everything from providing education and health services to ensuring environmental sustainability and combating poverty.\n\nDiya Foundation (DIYA) is a vocational training centre in Bangalore that provides life skills and employability education to adults with intellectual challenges. Founded in 1999, DIYA aims to empower individuals overlooked after completing primary schooling. Their structured training program has positively impacted over 200 adults, significantly changing their self-esteem, independence, and productivity.\n\nDIYA focuses on equipping adults with intellectual challenges to become valuable societal contributors. Through their training, participants learn essential skills such as personal grooming, household and financial management, social skills, occupational guidance, and employability skills. The foundation envisions a society where individuals with disabilities and their families live with dignity, pride, and confidence.\n\nOver the years, DIYA has achieved significant milestones. They have partnered with organisations like ProVision India to explore new vocational training avenues. Additionally, they have collaborated with companies like Hindustan Unilever Limited and Sodexo India Onsite Services to provide employment opportunities for their participants.\n\nMaria Seva Sangha originated from the visionary efforts of Ms Ethel Brito, a prominent social worker deeply concerned about the disadvantaged communities in Bangalore during the 1970s. In 1981, she established Maria Seva Sangha to address the pressing needs of the underprivileged, realising her dream of improving their quality of life.\n\nMs Brito identified several critical issues that demanded immediate attention. She recognised the financial constraints hindering deserving students from pursuing higher education and the plight of poverty-stricken children attending school on empty stomachs. Additionally, she witnessed the scarcity of housing for battered women, widows, and low-income families and the growing number of elderly individuals needing care and shelter.\n\nWith a group of like-minded individuals, Ms Brito formed Maria Seva Sangha as a voluntary organisation. They obtained registrations, tax-exemption status, and FCRA sanction, building credibility with the public. Through the support and goodwill of generous donors, the Sangha gradually amassed the necessary financial resources to launch various projects benefiting economically deprived children, widows, families, and senior citizens.\n\nEstablished in 2003 by a group of professionals, Sikshana Foundation has embarked on a transformative journey in collaboration with government institutions to enhance the quality of education in public schools. Their mission is to develop sustainable and scalable modules that seamlessly integrate with existing government workflows, resulting in improved education outcomes.\n\nInitially focusing on improving learning outcomes in primary schools, Sikshana successfully implemented the “Prerana” program, adopted by the Karnataka Education Department and implemented in over 50,000 schools across six states.\n\nTheir flagship initiative, Grama Digi Vikasana, aims to transform Gram Panchayat Libraries into Digital Transformation Centers in partnership with the Rural Development & Panchayat Raj Department.\n\nSikshana Foundation continues to significantly impact the education landscape through its unwavering dedication and focus on integrating technology. Their initiatives empower students, teachers, and the entire ecosystem, driving positive transformations in public schools across multiple states in India.\n\nThe Akshaya Patra Foundation is an Indian NGO headquartered in Bengaluru, Karnataka, with a mission to combat classroom hunger and support the education rights of children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nImplementing the PM POSHAN Abhiyaan (formerly known as the Mid-Day Meal Scheme) in government and government-aided schools, Akshaya Patra addresses malnutrition and ensures children receive fresh and nutritious meals every school day.\n\nSince its establishment in 2000, Akshaya Patra has utilised technology to expand its reach and impact. Its state-of-the-art kitchens have gained recognition worldwide and serve as a subject of study. Collaborations with the Government of India, state governments, corporates, individual donors, and well-wishers have been instrumental in its growth.\n\nFrom initially serving 1,500 children in five schools, Akshaya Patra now provides wholesome meals to over 2 million children from 22,367 schools across 15 states and two union territories in India.\n\nKutumba, a registered NGO since 1991, has been dedicated to supporting families and assisting children and women facing mental and physical challenges. With a history of over 30 years, Kutumba has profoundly impacted many individuals’ lives. The organisation has cared for over 50 children with intellectual disabilities and supported over 850 young women with physical challenges.\n\nThese women have emerged as financially independent and emotionally stable individuals. Through their group foster care program, Kutumba ensured that these girls received a safe environment, proper nutrition, and vital psychosocial support.\n\nKutumba’s mission is rooted in opening doors of opportunity for families, offering counselling, care, and nurturing to the vulnerable. Their overarching vision revolves around empowering individuals, families, and communities through education, counselling, and training."
