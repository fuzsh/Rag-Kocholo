        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Bob Einstein, the comedian who played bumbling daredevil Super Dave Osborne in the 1980s, has died.\n\nDeadline reported Einstein, 76, was recently diagnosed with cancer.\n\nHis career began behind the camera, writing for The Smothers Brothers and Sonny & Cher. Einstein’s acting career took off in the early ’80s with Super Dave appearing on the Canadian sketch comedy series “Bizarre.” The klutzy Evel Knievel-like character was spun off on to his own show, “Super Dave,” which ran on Showtime from 1987-1991. A Super Dave movie was released in 2000.\n\nIn recent years, Einstein became known for playing Larry David’s friend/nemesis Marty Funkhouser on “Curb Your Enthusiam.” He also had a recurring role on “Arrested Development.”\n\nHis brother, actor-director Albert Brooks, mourned the loss on Twitter.\n\n“R.I.P. My dear brother Bob Einstein. A great brother, father and husband. A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever,” Brooks posted."
