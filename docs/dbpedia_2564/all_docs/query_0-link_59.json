        "text": "Production sound travels the desolate countryside for Director Scott Cooper’s genre film.\n\nThe film opens on the wide plains of the West, a family tending to its prairie farm. Safe, happy. Until it’s disrupt­ed by a group of wild Comanche on a war path of massacre and thievery. The father, mother and two daughters have little chance. One after another, they fall to the ground, breath leaving their body. Clutching her wounded baby girl, Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike) hides herself until the calamity calms—a reminder of life in Southwest 1890s America.\n\nDirector Scott Cooper (Black Mass) wanted to honor the legacy of the Western genre in Hostiles, but blend modern themes of reconciliation, healing and equality into the nar­rative. Set in 1892, Army Capt. Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is exhausted from decades of battle and sees retirement around the bend. Reluctant, because of their dark history, he’s tasked with escorting Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi), a dying Cheyenne and his fam­ily from New Mexico to the tribal grasslands of Montana. As the discordant group journeys from the isolated Army outpost of Fort Berringer, they encounter the widow Quaid, and later, the hostile Comanche. In order to survive the 1,000-mile trip, they’re forced to confront their preconceived notions of one another and band together in a story of compassion and tolerance that tests the resilience of the human spirit and our wiliness to change.\n\nJosé Antonio García finds a moment to rest on the location-heavy shootProduction Sound Mixer José Antonio García, alongside Boom Operator Jonathan Fuh and Sound Utilities Daniel Duerre and Daniel Carlton, captured the audio to the location-based shoot. Both Local 695 members, García and Fuh have been a team for decades now. “We met twenty-eight years ago on a low-budget, nonunion proj­ect,” recalls Fuh. “His boom operator at the time didn’t show up and the UPM gave José my num­ber to call. The rest is history.”\n\nThe two mesh well because they share similar high expec­tations in the work they produce and seemingly enjoy the same movies. As Fuh puts it, García comes from Mexican new wave cinema, knowing directors like Alejandro Iñárritu (The Revenant) and cinematographers like Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity) with Fuh’s background stemming from Taiwanese new wave filmmaking. And it shows how well they work together, having been nominated for an Oscar on Ben Affleck’s Argo and CAS Award noms for Babel, Iron Man 3 and Clint Eastwood’s biopic of American pilot Chesley Sullenberger, Sully.\n\nHostiles was their third project of 2017, sandwiched between the short Carne y Arena and the Dan Gilroy feature Roman J. Israel, Esq. “The locations of this film were challeng­ing. I couldn’t tell you how many times we had to shut down because of thunder or lightning in the area,” says García. Production roamed the horizons of New Mexico and Colorado to create the visual grammar as Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi (Silver Linings Playbook) shot ana­morphic, pairing Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2s (G-series, T-series lenses) and Kodak stock.\n\nWardrobe attracted sound’s attention early on as Costume Designer Jenny Eagan (Beasts of No Nation) used wool for the Army suits worn by Capt. Blocker and his men. Characters, more or less, dressed in the same attire which allowed sound to collaborate with costume to sew in special pouches for wireless transmitters. “Acoustically, wool is very loud and you can hear the mic rustle against the fabric, so we needed to find the right placement for our mics,” notes García. By using Countryman B6s, they were able to hide the tiny lavalier behind buttons, and for Bale’s character, the mic was placed inside the scarf instead of the body. “The B6s don’t have as great of a sound as the Sankens or DPAs, but they did very well protecting us against the wind,” adds Fuh.\n\nSince nearly eighty percent of the movie was exterior loca­tions, wind was a constant battle with sound changing out its wind protection for the boom during heavier gusts. As with many productions today, two cameras shot wide and tight frames so the sound team reacted by wiring actors and finding the best place for the boom. “We always try to get as close to the action as possible,” Fuh says. “The radio mic will always win, but we always have a wild track on the boom because it may not be that bad when it comes time for post.” Instead of a monitor on his boom, Fuh relies on knowing what kind of lens is on the camera to bring him closer to the scene. Sound also recorded wild tracks of wind for post that includes Supervising Sound Editor/Re-recording Mixer Skip Lievsay, Sound Designer/Re-recording Mixer Paul Urmson and Sound Designer Craig Berkey.\n\nCharacters traveled through the valleys and mountains by horseback, and while production minimized dialog sequences of them riding, plenty still existed. The camera was mounted on either an electric golf cart with an arm and stabilizing head, or when action was intensified, a suspension buggy was brought in. Sound needed to be bag-ready, covering up to six different actors at a time. There’s some instances where they traveled with their own mule to get through the mountains or would set up a remote wireless system in order to get closer to the action with minimal equipment.\n\nSound needed to be cautious working with the horses as to not make them nervous. “We were limited to what we could boom,” admits Fuh. “We had to be really gentle about it as you don’t want to trick or put them in a panic with actors riding them. You almost have to be like a ninja so you’re not seen or heard.” Cooper went to great lengths to create accurate depictions of Native people. A team was on set to help actors with gestures, rituals and language. A significant amount of the dialog was spoken in the Northern Cheyenne dialect to firm the cultural and historical integrity of the film. The multilingual García had to pick up the language quickly to decipher when actors would stop and start talking. “I have a natural way with lan­guage and it really boiled down to needing to learn the first and last few words or sounds to mix accordingly.”\n\nWhen the story reaches Fort Winslow, a resting stop for the travelers, Blocker is asked to take a prisoner to a nearby city to face sentencing. The confined is Sgt. Charles Wills (Ben Foster), who knows Blocker’s grim history well. Expected to face certain death, Wills tries to persuade Blocker to release him and questions why he’s escorting Yellow Hawk instead of killing the family as they ride toward Montana.\n\nOne rainy night, Wills is tied to a tree pleading his case. Water-resistant mics were able to cut through the weather and capture the dialog. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case for another scene when Master Sgt. Thomas Metz (Rory Cochrane) spoke to Blocker about leaving the convoy. “What we didn’t expect was how soft-spoken this movie would be,” says García. “We were able to get through it all except this particular scene with Rory. They had so much rain coming down on set and there was a canopy overhead creating this drum sound. It was too much.” The production mixer made Cooper aware of the situation, but because of the visual demand of the scene, it would require looping in post—something every sound mixer tries to avoid but happens in nearly every film.\n\nA scene that took sound in a new direction was a song accompanied by guitar around a nighttime campfire. It was meant to be playback with lip sync, but since the actor had a decent voice, they recorded it live. The lav was placed on the outside of his shirt behind the button and caught the instrument and voice perfectly.\n\nFor this shoot, and the many others García and Fuh have done together, they approach each scene like water. Whatever the shape of the production, they flow into the open spaces they are given. García admits this project had an astounding group of people. “It really starts with Scott. We enjoyed working with him. His energy is contagious and he’s enthusiastic. He has a way of conveying his message that makes our job and everyone else’s life easier.”\n\nReport from the Young Workers Committee\n\nby Eva Rismanforoush\n\nOccupational stress has long been acknowledged as a serious health hazard in the industrialized workforce. It is as an underlying factor of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, substance abuse, and it does not distinguish between ethnicity, gender or class. Workplace stress is also directly linked to chronic psychological disorders such as anxiety, panic attacks and major depression. We are often exposed to extreme weather conditions, environmental and health hazards that can range anywhere from rattlesnakes, structually compromised buildings, airborne pathogens and hazardous chemicals, etc.\n\nAs members of the entertainment industry, we face some of the most adverse jobsite conditions and hours in the developed world. We spend seventy-plus hours a week on set during a regular TV season or a feature film. We are often exposed to extreme weather conditions, long hours, environmental and health hazards that can range anywhere from rattlesnakes, structurally compromised buildings, airborne pathogens and hazardous chemicals, etc. But we work because it is a central part of our lives and we creatively thrive through it. However, as exhilarating and interesting the job may be, the sheer magnitude of daily logistical efforts and close personal interactions can cause stress.\n\nOur bodies are equipped with a natural coping mechanism, which is activated when a potentially dangerous situation is detected. It is called the “fight or flight” response. It always proceeds in the same manner: the danger stimulus, the removal of the danger and a state of relaxation.\n\nWhile this mechanism has been crucial to our survival as a species, it is designed to only activate in isolated instances. “Fight or flight” served our ancestors well as they fought off natural predators. Yet as the developed world becomes increasingly safe for humans, the American Psychological Association reports that stress levels in the twenty-first century are higher than ever.\n\nToday, many of our stressors come in a much subtler form and stem from a broad variety of factors. Whether it is increased productivity demands, muscle strains from booming increasingly long digital takes, dealing with trying personalities or never being appreciated for the quality of work we produce. All of these causes can trigger a “fight or flight” response. But we got so used to working in demanding environments that we may be unaware of the body’s reaction. And whether we are aware of it or not, the constant “on-alert” state is cumulative and takes a toll on our physical and emotional well-being. Bruce McEwen, a neuroscientist at the Rockefeller University, recently revealed that exposure to three weeks of stress can change mammalian brain-architecture. Forcing his rats to swim, among other adverse activities, shrank the dendrites in their amygdalae, the parts of the brain that control emotional responses, decision-making and memory. Some of these effects are reversible, but such changes increase the risk of anxiety disorders and depression. McEwen also linked chronic stress to a reduction in the overall neuron number.\n\nWHAT IS STRESS?\n\nStress is a household term used to describe a hormonal surge in our bodies resulting from physical and mental strain in adverse circumstances. Hans Selye, Director of University of Montreal’s Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, first coined the term stress in his letter to the British journal Nature in 1936. Selye’s “general adaptation syndrome” (GAS) study, which was later renamed “stress response,” revealed morphological changes in mammals due to prolonged and excessive secretion of naturally occurring stress hormones.\n\nCOPING WITH STRESS\n\nOur bodies are vastly resilient while malleable to the environment. Neuroplasticity, the ability of neurons to reorganize to compensate for injury and disease, allow us to recover to some extent. Kelly McGonigal, Psychologist at Stanford University, suggests that altering how we process stress determines its detriment or benefit. Living without it is improbable, but learning how to use it to your advantage can lead to an overall healthier & happier existence.\n\nThis means ending a stress cycle in rest and recovery, whether by not checking emails & social media on the weekends, taking more holidays or going for a walk in the middle of the day. In the right mindset, stress can even be performance enhancing.\n\nEven Hans Selye distinguished stress reposes into “eustress” and “distress” later on in his career.\n\nBut how do you get there? We thought it best to harness the knowledge from some of our most esteemed colleagues, who have been in this line of work for decades. They have all found engaging ways to process stress and lead healthy and productive lives. Here are their thoughts, please enjoy!\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“The job itself comes with built-in stress because of the fluid nature of it. Home life is hard to keep balanced. Early on, I had to make the choice to accept these conditions completely or not. Once I chose, I committed. Having committed relieves much of the stress and making sure that your loved ones know that you are not the boss of your time can help relieve potential stress. On the job, I always prepared for scenario A, B, C or the unknown. I operated from a position of being ready for anything at any time and not letting it ruffle my feathers if things changed, because, they always do. Pull a rabbit out of a hat, change a pigeon into a bouquet of flowers. The stress of the job goes away when you accept:\n\n1. You have no control and nothing is predictable\n\n2. You have done your homework even though the call sheet and script can be torn up and thrown out at any time\n\n3. Piss-poor planning makes for piss-poor performance = stress\n\n4. You have all the tools and tricks handy to handle every situation\n\n5. You are able to pull out these tricks at a moment’s notice\n\n6. Never be lazy, always be busy and alert. The minute you slack is when the s**tstorm hits\n\n7. You have the confidence to jump in and do what needs to be done, especially under fire\n\n8. You have accepted the fact that you will be working until they tell you that you can go home\n\n9. Be happy that you have chosen this work every day. No one is holding a gun to your head to stay, so might as well spread a positive attitude so your work environment can be fun and rewarding\n\n10. Realize that there are many people who would be more than happy to take your place\n\n“With all of these things in mind, kick your shoes off and unwind with a glass of vino at the end of a long hard day and try to catch some zzz’s”\n\n– Peggy Names, Boom Operator\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“I’ve always felt that the film business is what you make it. It is intense; there is big money at stake every day. Pressure builds, tempers flare and it becomes cumulative among departments as it spreads down from the top. The trick is, as I see it, is to recognize the tsunami coming your way and prepare accordingly. Certainly, preparation is key. But I’ve always told my assistants that as the production company gets crazier, you get calmer, to the point where you are almost comatose. My dad taught me to ‘work hard and go home.’ I’ve lived that for forty years in the business. It’s worked for me.”\n\n– Randy Johnson, Boom Operator\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“I’ve had many different relationships with stress in my forty years in 695. I’ve dealt with it most every way possible, from alcohol or reefer, to exercise and meditation. I feel the key to dealing with it is to know yourself and to know what stress is. For me, it’s been an evolving relationship through the decades. When I started out, it was like young love and I was high on stress, thinking it was like romantic love, all-consuming and that it would always be like this. It was exciting but exhausting and not sustainable. As the years piled up, I learned to give my all between call and wrap and then shut that door as I got into my van to drive home. This became my time. I dreamed up projects, personal or family, listened to music, anything was cool as long as it wasn’t work-related. For me, it is paramount to have your own life that you maintain and respect as much as your career life. I love family (which can have its own stresses), hiking, playing drums or ukes, painting, photography, fine food with friends, travel and sleep. After all these years, it is easy to keep stress in check when I have a balance of work and play. That and the joy I get from the world-class education I receive observing and marching in the ‘Grand Parade’ of life. It is hard to stress what was or might be if you are actively living in the here and now.”\n\n– Crew Chamberlain, Sound Mixer\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“To get a handle on stress at work, I begin with arriving to set early. Being consistently punctual to your location is paramount and sets the tone for the day.\n\n“Do your homework: Knowing where you’re at in the script and its shooting schedule is a good way to keep the stress monsters at bay. If you know there will be a scene at a waterfall or a big dance number, you will be able to prepare for it and be prepared when it happens. Smaller details like day/night number gives you an indication of costume and wiring changes.\n\n“Taking care: Exercise is another key to fighting stress and yoga has done that for me. It keeps me centered and my attitude in check.\n\n“Nutrition: I will be the first to say, I love pizza for a second meal, complementary food trucks and my morning espresso, but food does have an effect on your mood and your stress level. Moderation is the key and knowing when to curtail the caffeine definitely helps.\n\n“Humor, Thought = Empowerment and Positive Thinking: I’m very fortunate to get to listen to actors act, the telling of jokes and experiencing sublime and scary words and descriptions. For me, humor and just sitting there thinking, leads to a positive outlook about my situation. That leads to empowering my mind and confidence level. How do I get there? I need to be honest with myself and what’s bugging me and deep always clears my head. I can then focus on sound for the scene or try to help others. Wanting to do the best job I can and rooting for the success of others is a direct result of empowering your mind.”\n\n– George A.

I put in 240 hours in 19 days. This included travel, working double shifts, on top of the usual rigors of my job. To add to that, I experienced personal distress, any of which would be a large task to take on with a normal job situation. I remember walking onto the truck, and sitting at my record station, when my gut said, ‘If you don’t take time off soon, you will die. You can’t keep going at this speed.’ I booked a vacation for four days immediately. I went away to a wellness spa in the desert. I turned off my phone for a week, and didn’t tell anyone where I went (except for my mom). Four days was not enough, but it was enough to bring me down from the adrenaline high that I had been riding on for so long, in order to come back and sleep solidly. After that, I decided to take another 2½ weeks off.\n\n“During this time, I realized I needed to create somewhat of a routine. The lack of structure this business lifestyle affords me is not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. Here are some of the things I started to do:\n\nI started with my diet—I cut down on drinking, carbs, sugars, dairy. I bring all my own food to set with me, even when I travel. The snacks I bring are organic, easy on digestion, yet filling and satisfying.\n\nI recognize I may not always get eight hours of sleep, but the few hours of sleep I do get, should be quality sleep.\n\nI routinely see a chiropractor and massage therapist while I’m in town.\n\nI don’t drink while traveling because it is dehydrating.\n\nI travel with a foam roller to stretch and work out.\n\nI always upgrade my seat when flying for more leg room. This is my time to rest when I’m traveling.\n\nI try to drink a gallon of water every day.\n\nI try to exercise, which usually means stretching in the morning and evening.\n\nI always leave the truck for fifteen minutes and walk— seeing sunlight is essential.\n\nI learned how to quiet my mind.\n\n“Lately, there’s been a focus on small enjoyments of life. When we are constantly go-go-go, you need to take a minute to enjoy life. Find a small joy that takes you out of your day.\n\n“I have had jobs that have caused health issues due to stress, and I’m lucky that I have been able to recover from them. Last year, I went through a breast cancer scare, which made me take a look at my life and examine what I find most important.”\n\n– Jillian Arnold, Digital Asset Manager\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“Stress management and proper set etiquette is really what separates the A-listers from the rest of us. We work in an industry where the creative process often demands to make things happen against seemingly impossible odds. I have been screamed at in my face for issues that were not related to me, I have scrambled around troubleshooting in front of one hundred-plus people all waiting on video to fix the problem and asked to do the impossible over and over. I rarely get yelled at anymore (thankfully), but I tell all the guys on my team that when you do, it’s not personal. There is legitimate pressure rolling down from above. I worked on The Revenant and Chivo, the DP, was incredibly demanding at moments. I just worked with Chivo two days ago on a commercial and it was a totally different experience.\n\n“There are a few tricks that can help avoid unnecessary trouble. I make a practice of introducing myself to the agency on a commercial so if there are any issues with image, they know they can come to me personally to fix it rather than complaining to the producer. It’s simple but it works. Also, communication with the 1st AD is paramount. Newcomers must realize they are responsible for communicating their needs. If you need ten minutes to solve a complex request, you must explain that to an AD. They are your lifeline to make sure the people who matter know what’s happening and to give you the appropriate time.\n\n“No one enjoys the looks you get when the company is waiting for video. I learned that the hard way years ago working with a fantastic director, Rupert Sanders. I was on my first job with him, was brought on by the producer to impress him. She had seen me perform well in many difficult situations so I had credibility with her. Things had been going well until we set up for a difficult choreographed shot with horses, mud and explosions that required a big reset. Just as we were about to call action, the image from the wireless went out and monitors went dark. I intensely wondered what could be wrong as the scene went on. We cut and the director turned and just said, ‘Bye bye, Willow.’ It was in the days of film, so there was no way to play it back and he asked me why I didn’t stop the shot. I was mostly confused & embarrassed that I didn’t make the call and realized right then, it was my job to do so.\n\n“A big part of handling stress is how you recover after a mistake. Often we get blamed for issues that may be camera- or power-related or may indeed be on us as video assist technicians. Sometimes criticism is valid. I despise that moment but handle it by telling myself I am good at my job and trust that by the end of the show, they will see how that moment was not indicative of my normal routine. Professionalism is key and it’s important to remind yourself that everyone is dealing with stress in their respective departments. But what we can do is focus on the job, keep your eye on the ball and maintain confidence. Even if you just threw an interception, you must believe that next throw is going to be a touchdown.”\n\n– Willow Jenkins, Video Engineer\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“1.

Recognize your own signs of burning out: One thoughtless action could ruin weeks of relationship building.\n\n5. Try not to be competitive, but rather, collaborative. The film industry is always expanding.\n\n6. Make personal plans—Even if they have to change a lot; life moves quickly and you don’t want to realize it’s too late for certain things.\n\n7.

Every day is filled with challenges and often annoyances and I think it’s important to check those at the stage door. Home life becomes just that—home life and nothing intrudes on it or its routines. I find the people I’ll be working with and for to be an extremely important factor on choosing jobs. It makes all the difference when the people you work for are good to you. You pay it right back at them. When you are genuinely happy and have a good attitude, it is way less likely that those who work around you who may have a bad attitude to be able to affect you.\n\n“I feel like if we worked fewer hours per day (max twelve on twelve off—but ideally, ten hours call to wrap), we would all be much happier. If I could have dinner at home or out any night of the week I wanted yet still work a full day, I would be even happier. And mind you, it’s not necessarily about the dinner … It’s about the time.

Earlier this year, I took four months off and managed my daughter’s fast-pitch softball team and participated in their school events for the first time ever. My husband and I agree, taking care of the kids is much harder than our day jobs (he’s a grip) … So after a stint with the kids, we are actually ready to go back to work. We also always take time off for those precious moments you can’t get back, like trick or treating. It’s important to work with people who also value family or personal time, because it really helps minimize burnout. Taking a day off once in a while isn’t going to stop the show, and it can benefit a fellow 695 member who really needs hours. Win-win!\n\n“One thing I now take more seriously is my health. I no longer put work before annual physicals or illness. Our yearly physical is one of the best benefits of our health insurance, so use them! And if I’m sick, I stay home. Last thing I want to do is make my fellow crewmembers ill. No one is going to think you’re a hero when you’re coughing all over set.\n\n“I love hour walk always. I get outside, walk or ride my bike and rack up some vitamin D. I’ll take care of small errands like washing the car or hitting the Rite Aid. Five lunch hours correlate to a big chunk of my weekend, so if I don’t have to spend it buying shampoo, I’m thrilled. Drinking enough water is always a challenge for all of us, but staying hydrated does wonders for your energy level. Joe Foglia and I remind each other to hit the bottle all day long.\n\n“I absolutely take into account the people I’ll be working with, the type of project, the commute and the season length. Hour-long episodic can be a grind, so unless you’re working with people you enjoy, it won’t work. We spend more time with our work families than our real families.

However, I’m certainly not stress-free. When the stress arrives, the best thing for me, if possible, is to remove myself physically from the situation that is causing it. That can be relatively easy in everyday life but can sometimes be hard to do on set. Usually, I can find a nice quiet corner somewhere to unwind. The timing is the tricky part. Outside of the workplace, playing the drums or guitar has always been a wonderful activity to help me get away from it all and clear my head. However, my absolute favorite all-around tension-relieving, mentalcleansing activity is going for a strenuous run at the beach. It never fails to return me to a tranquil state of mind.”\n\n– Mark Agostino, Music Playback & Live Recording Mixer\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n“It is no secret what a difficult business we have chosen.

Despite the heroic efforts of our dearly departed Haskel Wexler, just getting home from work can be quite hazardous. As a long-term survivor in production sound—thirty-six years since I bought my first Nagra (that’s a little scary when I see it in writing!)—I am very happy to be asked to contribute some ideas about stress management.\n\n“Love what you do, but not to the exclusion of all else; given the crazy number of hours we work, it is hard but important to seek balance in your life. The job can be incredibly frustrating, learn to not go home bitter. That makes showing up the next day a lot easier. On the other hand, sometimes the best thing you can see is that job in your rear-view mirror. Know when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em. There are more jobs than one and sometimes the one you have is not really the one for you.\n\n“Our work is in many ways, so very hard. Even if you’re not hauling cable or setting c-stands or building sets or swinging a boom with a wind-screened shotgun at full extension, the work is physically demanding. Even if you’re not directing the movie or doing a budget or a schedule or mixing a scene with nine mics and playback, our work is mentally demanding.\n\n“Here’s what I do to keep myself prepared to meet the challenges of our workplace that are maybe a bit different than others: I ride my bicycle. I mean, I really ride my bike(s). On weekends I do long rides, often with a group, including gran fondos or century-type rides. Most days at work, when lunch is called, I get to my sound trailer, do a quick Superman change into my cycling togs, jump on my “at-work” bike, and pedal away from the set as fast as I can for 30-50 minutes, 8 to 15 miles. It’s not much, but when I’ve been stuck at my cart all morning on a dark stage, or I’ve had some frustrating moments, or whatever, it allows me to get my heart pumping, muscles working, my eyes can focus on infinity, my senses sharpen and I can play in the traffic where the phrase “thrown under the bus” is not a metaphor! It is amazing how this breaks up the day and revitalizes me for the second half. It’s amazing how many little lunch routes I know around LA. Almost wherever I find myself shooting, I’m rarely too far from somewhere I’ve already been and have ridden—the city is smaller and more connected than you think. Downtown? MacArthur Park to Griffith Park by way of Chinatown and Elysian Park is a great ride! Universal/Disney/Warners? Griffith Park is right there. Hollywood? Get to the hills. Santa Clarita? So many ways if it’s not too hot. The Culver Studios? The Ballona Creek Bike Path is just around the corner, also some good climbing at the Overlook Park on Jefferson.

Features\n\nby Mark Ulano CAS AMPS\n\nThe members who embody Local 695 are more than just production sound engineers. We proudly represent video engineers, television broadcast engineers and projection engineers alike. As the union continues to grow, in part by the increase in on-set demand and advancements in technology; our picture brothers and sisters are adopting new workflows to meet those complex requests in feature films and television broadcasts.\n\nChris Kieffer, a Y-4 Video Engineer (Video Assist, Video/24- Frame Playback) in Local 695, is part of an intriguing group of video graphic operators at Warner Bros. Production Sound and Video Services. Pioneered by Rick Whitfield, the small team of creatives are able to deliver end-to-end video graphics for intricate projects. In our fall 2016 issue, Vince Parker, who is also part of the team, highlighted the process while working on Passengers, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. We sat down with Kieffer to learn more about the unique workflow.\n\nPS&V: On-screen graphics. Is that a generic term used in the industry?\n\nChris Kieffer: Well, usually we get Video Graphic Supervisor or Video Graphics. I’ve even gotten one 24-Frame Playback Operator. I’ve gotten Playback Graphic Supervisor. I mean, it’s all of them. There’s just so many different ones, but usually it comes down to Video Graphics.\n\nPS&V: Who pioneered this group at Warner Bros.?\n\nCK: Vince Parker and Rick Whitfield have been working for a long time together. Vince was the guy who did graphics and programming and playback with Rick on set. They were like this little group and then as productions got bigger, they needed more help. Rick would hire our department to come in, design everything, and then Vince and his team would program it and build it.\n\nI was brought into it to do a project with Rick and while I was doing that, I needed some help. And he’s like, well, who do you want and I picked Coplin LeBleu. He came in. We worked great together and I’ve been going back to Coplin and other guys constantly over time.\n\nPS&V: What differentiates you from traditional video graphic operations?\n\nCK: A lot of the times when you work on a project, you might just hire a graphics company that only does graphics. And then, you’ll hire your playback guys to play it back on set.\n\nWe try to do all of it. We design, animate and program all of the onscreen content and use our playback guys and our gear on set. What we try to do is bring everything together—from pre-production to design and on-set operating.\n\nPS&V: How big is the team?\n\nCK: There are six of us as far as doing the graphics, programming and on set. But then we have the guys in the back also who supply, rig all the gear and get everything ready, too, in our rental department.\n\nPS&V: How do new job opportunities come along?\n\nCK: Different ways but generally word of mouth and guys who’ve worked with us previously. On Deepwater Horizon, we worked with Production Designer Chris Seagers.\n\nPS&V: How did the process start?\n\nCK: For Deepwater Horizon, Chris Seagers called me knowing I was at Warner Bros. He wanted us to bring all our guys and do our thing. I went out there to talk to him, went over the script—what he wanted—and we agreed to do the project.\n\nThen I’ll come back and start doing all the lead design— coming up with what it’s going to look like—and bring in 695 members who do on-set playback or graphics. It’s hard, there’s not too many of them that can do both. Usually, you have a playback guy or a guy who does graphics but not both.\n\nPS&V: It’s like Pro Tools in a way. There are those who know the on set and others who know the studio side but few do both.\n\nCK: Yes. It’s a hard mix to find. And the ones who do have both skill sets are always busy.\n\nPS&V: Is the part of the skill set to be able to respond improvisationally right then and make it work?\n\nCK: Yes, definitely. In minutes, when we’re turning the camera around, you’ve got that much time to change your graphics. At the last minute, Set Decorator might just roll a medical cart onto a set and they know I’ll be able to power it up and figure out a way to get whatever graphic they need up on the monitor. Props will hand me a briefcase, pop it open, and there’s a monitor inside, and now I’ve got to figure out how to make this thing work so sometimes there’s a lot of engineering involved, too. Never a dull moment.\n\nPS&V: Can you describe in a little more detail the creative workflow and the interaction with other departments that ends with the on-set graphics we see up on the screen?\n\nCK: Every show’s different but it starts with the Art Department. They develop the concepts and the look for the project. On a show I’m working on now, for example, they send me the concept art and set drawings and a list of the various devices they expect to have on set … things like interactive iPads on door panels for keypads or airlocks, screens built into consoles, big wall displays or just displays on laptops and cellphones or TVs or whatever.\n\nBased on the designs we’ve received, we build all of the video graphic elements and have the Set Decorator or the Director or both sign off on them. Based on what hardware we’re going to be working with, I’ll then have to engineer it all so we can work with it smoothly on the set. And sometimes, they’ll need us to program interactivity into the various devices so actors can trigger the sequence and make the scene look real. Or we have to figure out how to get our graphics into existing equipment, like some old piece of electronics or whatever it is that they need.\n\nSo throughout the whole process, we’re working pretty closely with the Production Designer, the Set Decorators, and the Prop Department, all of us ready to change things in case they change their mind at the last minute … which is pretty much a typical day for us.\n\nPS&V: Is this something that’s evolved more recently? A kind of real-time interactive?\n\nCK: Yes. We try to be as flexible on set as we possibly can. There’s just times when you can’t because of the scope of something.\n\nPS&V: Are the tools changing so you can be more flexible?\n\nCK: Definitely. Before it was a lot of Adobe Flash and other programs. You could do those changes on set, but that software itself is not really being supported or updated anymore.\n\nWe’re kind of moving things over to game engines like with unity because that gives us flexibility. Right now on The Last Ship, for example, everything on that show changes the day of, twenty times a day.\n\nPS&V: Right there?\n\nCK: Right then and there. Constantly.\n\nPS&V: How do those changes get worked out on set?\n\nCK: It depends on the director or whoever is making the change. But usually, we’ll look at it, and for example, they’ll say, “Can we have this guy more over here?” or “Can we just move or scale this or change something subtle?”\n\nWe’ll then relay it back to the playback guy or the graphics guy to make that change, hopefully, within enough time before they’ll begin shooting. Sometimes they don’t want to wait. So then it’s going to be as it is or you can make it green or blue or whatever you want.\n\nPS&V: Going green or blue means that they’re going to come back and do it in post?\n\nCK: Yes.\n\nPS&V: Do they reach out to you at that point?\n\nCK: They could but it depends on the show. It could go to a visual effects house or the editors or something like that. If it’s easy enough, we’ve done it sometimes where we’ll shoot, like, let’s say it’s a radar on The Last Ship. Vince would put up a graphic without all the blips of where the ships are because they just aren’t sure where they’re going to go. We’ll shoot that and then in post, the editors can add the ship’s blips where they need to be.\n\nPS&V: Would that be one of those times where you provide graphics for pre-production, production and post?\n\nCK: Exactly. Sometimes it’s not even just delivering the playback graphics we created to visual effects. We actually even do the visual effects—the actually finals out to film. So we try to cover the whole spectrum so when they come to us for onscreen graphics, we can provide everything.\n\nPS&V: Do you see any trends in terms of onset visual graphics and playback versus green screen?\n\nCK: People want to always implement new technologies like curved screens or transparent LCDs. Those are all cool, but we rarely have the time and the budget to actually explore those things.\n\nSometimes you get lucky on big features but it always kind of comes back to the same thing where we try to have as much in camera, as much flexibility as possible and just go from there.\n\nPS&V: What projects are you working on now? Are any done remotely?\n\nCK: Pacific Rim Uprising. Followed by Rampage and Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Pacific Rim Uprising is in China and we’re doing everything remotely and then sending it out to China for playback on set.\n\nPS&V: People don’t realize all the work it takes to get those images on screen.\n\nCK: Yup. That’s the magic.\n\nPS&V would like to thank Chris Kieffer for providing some great insight into their work. If you’d like to learn more, check out Warner Bros.

One of his achievements of that time was the seminal recording Jazz Samba, by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd. In the early 1970s, the great recording engineer, Val Valentin, brought Ed in on what would be his first television mixing experience.\n\nHere is a story from Jeffrey Fecteau:\n\nI was very fortunate to be Ed’s lead A2 on his first television show. I think it was 1972. He had just finished recording and mixing an album for Frank Sinatra announcing his coming out of retirement, called Ol’ Blue Eyes Is Back. He was asked by Frank to oversee the music mix on a TV special with the same name. Another audio engineer had been hired to mix the music for the TV show. Ed was in a production meeting with Producer/Director Marty Pasetta and staff. When Marty was explaining to the TV audio engineer how he wanted the PA, Frank’s monitors and the orchestra laid out, the other engineer told him it couldn’t be done, which led to a heated debate. At this point, Marty turned to Ed and asked if it could be done. Ed said yes. Marty asked him if he would be willing to take over the show. Ed said yes. The other person was relieved of his duties. That was how Ed started his career in TV. And that was the beginning of a very long and blessed relationship between us. I worked with him on most of the major events and Emmy Award-winning shows that he mixed. He was a truly kind-hearted man and a great friend. He will be sorely missed.\n\nIn 1981, Ed helped to form Greene, Crowe & Company, the premier television mobile facilities provider of that time.\n\nCharles Fernandez shares these kind words:\n\nOur business has lost a true icon, a legend and a kind, quiet gentleman. Ed Greene was one of the finest men I’ve ever known. I will always remember him pulling his van up to the mobile unit to drop off gear or walking up the backstairs to the audio booth with a piece of equipment under his arm. His work ethic was like no other, something he has passed down to his kids.\n\nI was one of the very few fortunate ones to have the pleasure of working at Greene, Crowe & Company for fifteen years. Ed always had a smile. We often enjoyed talking about our families.\n\nHis life was filled with some of the most incredible accomplishments. I loved to hear his stories and he had many. He was the master of his trade and will truly be missed. God bless you Ed. Off to a better place. When the trumpets sound off in heaven, no doubt Ed will be at the mixer. Love you, my friend.\n\nThoughts from longtime friend Murray Siegel:\n\nHis embrace of new technology, new techniques and new ideas was an inspiration. He faced challenges with assurance and rarely failed to come out the other side with a smile.\n\nBut even more impressive was his willingness to share what he learned. Above and beyond equipment and tools, he didn’t hesitate to take a chance on someone new. I was an elementary school teacher. With his kindness and help, I became a “sound guy.”\n\nEd is defined by his curiosity and his generosity.\n\nThe way I think about production, the way I work, the man I am, all are informed by having worked with and watched Ed Greene.\n\nThis is his legacy.\n\nHe was a pioneer, a mentor, a colleague, a friend. Our lives are not diminished because he’s gone. Our lives are richer because he is in them.\n\nSome thirty-five years ago, I was working on a show mixed by another audio icon, Ken Becker. It was among the first live-music shows mixed in stereo at KTLA. To make sure things went well, the production company brought in Ed as an advisor. That was the first time I worked with him. Ken later remarked that it was like working with a lifelong friend he had just met. I wish I could go back to that audio booth and listen to the two of them tell stories.\n\nFred Tator relates this one that Ed told while they worked together at Complete Post.\n\nEd was in a small village in Eastern Europe shooting something or other. The people of the village were very kind. They fed the crew dinner and breakfast each day. In the morning, they had fresh eggs and bread. In the evening, they had some kind of meat that had a strange taste. Ed said he couldn’t figure out what it might be. It wasn’t quite beef or veal. It wasn’t quite pork. So he called it “vork.” The last evening there, the host asked if there was anything special the crew would like for dinner. They said some chicken would be nice. The interpreter told the hosts and the hosts gave them a weird look and then got to work preparing the dinner. The chicken was delicious. The next morning at breakfast, there was only bread. When asked why there were no eggs, the host gave them a look like you can’t imagine. Apparently, those breakfast eggs came from the chickens they had eaten for dinner.\n\nFast-forward to our last visit with Ed in rehab. The TV was on and Ed said in a whisper that he was bored. I said I bet you’d like to get out and get something to eat. Again he whispered, “Mexican.” I said, “How about some vork.” With that, Ed gave us a nice big smile. We said our goodbyes. And that’s my last image of Ed.\n\n“Kennedy.”\n\nEveryone has great stories of working with Ed. Many are humorous. Some brief reminiscences are recorded on the rack room walls at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. My favorite, a quote from a PL conversation: “I can’t talk! I can’t talk! I can’t even listen!” Even in chaos, there was humor.\n\nAndy Strauber recounts these memories:\n\nI will always remember two things about our Mr. Greene.\n\nWhen we first met, sometime last century, I was always amazed by the fact that he never seemed to label his console. No matter what show it was, there were no Ed Greene labels on however many desks he was using for that particular show. If there were any labels at all, it was because the truck engineer had started patching the show based on the paperwork (from some other version of the same show) that Ed would produce.\n\nThe other thing was how we would end music. We never just cut it off. When the producer or director wanted the music to end, we always took it out as if there was a band playing. “Wait for it,” Ed would say.\n\nMost directors did not even notice what we were doing. They just wanted the music to end. But Ed wanted it right. And it made a difference.\n\nLong hours, short turnarounds and red-eye flights were all part of Ed’s work life. Mark Weber remembers:\n\nIn the eighties, we were doing a shoot for a week with sixteen-hour days. I was amazed to find that, even though I arrived a half-hour before the call, he had beaten me to work. He did the next two days as well. I remarked to Joe Kendall that I got in early to beat traffic, and no matter how early I came in, Ed always beat me to work. He said, “That’s because he’s sleeping underneath the console.” I said, “Oh.” That thought hadn’t occurred to me.\n\nPatrick Baltzell shares this story:\n\nOne of the many interesting projects that I did with Ed Greene was the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. We were on site rehearsing and recording the musical elements for three weeks. These types of projects are primarily track playbacking, including the performances, underscores, announcements and voice-overs. The Opening Ceremony was four hours of continuous tracks. During the rehearsal process, dozens of edits are required to correct timings of cast movements, etc. Ed was using a brand-new Akai DR16 digital recorder for this project. The night before the Opening Ceremony, Ed was making some final edits and the Akai DR recorder failed. The memory limit had been reached and the music files overwrote the operating system files. No warning and no protection of the OS had been written into the software. Ed Greene and his assistant, Dave Farragher, stayed up all through the night to rebuild the four-hour show from the source reels and all of the edits and “pull ups” done from memory. The rest of us mortals would have written this off as a career ender. Not Ed Greene.\n\nWhen I asked a few people to contribute these memories, it was clear that the personal relationships forged were deep and true.\n\nFrom Debbie Fecteau:\n\nEd Greene: Mentor, Father figure, friend. Ed was a man who took a chance on me, and to him I owe my entire career. He taught me so very much and, at the same time, always had an ear to listen and give me not only professional advice, but personal life advice as well. Many long days at work, coupled by many laughs and many memories made. I will always be grateful for all he taught me in all aspects of life. Thank you, Eddie, for everything. And, a huge thank-you to his family for sharing him with us all these years. He will be missed very much by very many.\n\nSean McClintock reflects:\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time thinking about Ed Greene since I heard of his illness, and really realized how important he was to me, both professionally and personally. I first worked with him almost thirty years ago and was told he was a legend in the TV audio business. I fully expected him to treat me like the wet-behind-ears, inexperienced, too-bigfor- my-own-britches kid I was. He didn’t. He treated me with respect, kindness and generosity, as he did everybody I ever witnessed him interacting with. He always had time to answer a question, to tell a funny story or relate experiences from his remarkable life.\n\nHe essentially invented how entertainment TV audio is done, and none have ever done it better. Everyone who’s ever worked with him has stories of him mixing incredibly complex shows with orchestras, pop bands and production elements by himself, with consoles stacked up around him and leaning up against the walls of the control room. And with frightening few notes and labeling!!! When he left the Capital Concerts, it literally took five people to replace him (no offense if you guys are reading this, he just really was that good!).\n\nAs great as he was professionally, he was an even better person. Always funny, always with a great story he told so well, and always genuine and sincere. Thanks, Ed, for all the great times, and all you taught me. It was a privilege to know you and work with you. All my love and thoughts…\n\nNot long before Ed passed away, I was privileged to visit him. He was not in great shape; health issues were apparent, but he greeted me warmly, then asked, “Are you on hiatus, too?” Although his breathing was labored, we had a good conversation. The room was noisy with hospital machines and visitors; The Chew, a daytime talk show, was blaring from his television. After a few minutes, the segment was winding up, and one of the hosts threw to a break.\n\nNow, I swear this next part is true. Without looking up, Ed’s right foot flexed to press down on the applause pedal taking the show to commercial. I could only smile.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, he was getting tired, we said our goodbyes and he closed his eyes. I sat quietly until he fell asleep, then I thanked him for everything. I didn’t think it would be our last visit, but I am very grateful for that brief time.\n\nI can’t tell you how many shows I worked with Mr. Greene. It was a lot.\n\nAnd not enough.\n\nThank you, Ed. I will always be grateful for the way you shared your knowledge, making me better at my job. But even more, I will be forever grateful for having such a kind, gentle, decent friend. We all will.\n\nby Sam Hamer with Jennifer Winslow\n\nKathryn Hahn & Kevin Bacon. (Photo: Jessica Brooks)\n\nSaying the title of this show, whether placing orders with a vendor or simply telling friends and family, gets their attention. The title I Love Dick is based on a series of “love” letters by Kathryn Hahn’s character, Chris Kraus, written to Kevin Bacon’s character, Richard, aka Dick. It is a story of obsession and “female desire,” gone awry. Published first as a book, then as a stage play, then as a TV show for Amazon, when Jill Soloway came onboard.\n\nPart way through mixing season three of Transparent, I was asked to work on another show created by Jill Soloway and Sarah Gubbins and I jumped at the chance. Having been fortunate enough to have worked with Jill and the Topple family since Transparent season two, I was very excited and appreciative to get to work on another project with the same group. The first thing I did was make sure my Boom Op, Eddie Casares, and Utility Ted Hamer were available and interested. It says a lot for the work environment at Topple when both Ted and Eddie were immediately excited at the opportunity.\n\nKathryn Hahn, Griffin Dunne & Kevin Bacon. (Photo: Leann Mueller)\n\nThe production methodology on this show is far from traditional, some might say odd, I say unique. Being on I Love Dick (and Transparent) is unlike any production I have been involved with before or since. We start the day with a gathering of the crew and cast called ‘Box.’ This is the moment where anyone can get up and speak about whatever is on their mind. It seems counterintuitive to spend five to forty minutes talking and listening first thing in the morning, but it brings us all together in a way that doesn’t happen everywhere. It reminds us that we are all on the same side, on the same project and working toward the same goal. Production can be stressful, locations can be challenging, daylight is finite, time is money, this is a morning moment and it reminds us that we are one family with one heart connection. Because we are able to share such personal moments with one another via the Box, it allows us to build a very strong trust between the crew and actors. This ultimately, helps with the work by creating an environment where the actors are comfortable to have a Boom Operator in the room during many very intimate sex and nude scenes. It is very nice to be respected and trusted enough to have the emotional IQ appropriate for such scenes and not have to have the sound or performances suffer.\n\nJennifer Winslow booming in the tiny jail cell set.\n\nThe shooting itself is very free-flowing, there are scripts, but the actors are allowed and encouraged to explore the part. This means, scenes often end up veering pretty far from the script, both in mood and stage direction. The show is shot handheld and is very organic with scenes developing from the first rehearsal, often on camera, to ‘Moving on!’ As with many shows of a similar freeform nature, we rely heavily on wireless lav mics, with two cameras (sometimes three) seeing anything at any time. However, because of the subject matter of the show, costumes may come off at any moment, so the boom operator must always be aware and available. It is an intricate and beautiful dance that Eddie Casares performs with the Camera Department, every shot, every day!\n\nKevin Bacon as Dick meeting Kathryn Hahn as Chris for the first time. (Photo: Patrick Wymore)\n\nThere are many last-second decisions being made in the creative moment that can be very difficult for sound to keep up with. Eddie’s sensibilities with regard to story and the director’s intentions give him the ability to make quick decisions with the boom and allows us to continue without breaking up the action.\n\nOne of the joys of working with Jill as a director is the confidence in what is being shot, what is needed and what specific coverage is required to make the scene work. With that skill, it makes it really comfortable for us to know what we need to cover the scene. Oftentimes, we will shoot big scenes with ambient music, onscreen musicians, background wallah or offscreen commotion. It can be very unnerving from a sound perspective, but what may seem like chaos after the first few passes, eventually becomes beautifully crafted where things often play as if it were in front of a live audience, intimidating, but exciting. Watching Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Hahn and Griffin Dunne flesh out those scenes was truly a wonderful and privileged experience.\n\nSam Hamer mixing with his bag-rig. (Photo: Jessica Brooks)\n\nEddie had to leave a few weeks from the end of the show due to a family commitment and we had to find someone that could jump into the deep end, have the appropriate sensibilities, set presence and personality to take over. My first call was Jen Winslow. Having worked with Jen before, I knew she would be a great fit and she blended in seamlessly to the mix, without missing a beat.\n\nJennifer Winslow: “My first day on I Love Dick, I walked onto the camera truck and met the show’s allfemale camera crew. For the first time in my many years in the business, I have never been on a show that was as female dominant as Dick. We unloaded the gear, chatted some and pushed into the set. I noticed a big difference in the tone immediately, and was warmly welcomed on that first morning, when we gathered in a circle around a rather large apple box signed and decorated by all those who have stepped foot upon it. This Box moment was such a surprise, the whole crew stopped what it was doing and came together. I’m so used to rushing onto set, watching the first scene rehearsal, listening to the director and DP devise our shots, and coming up with a strategy to get my department the best sound in the most efficient manner. Well, none of that happened. Box took at least a half-hour off the top of our day, every day. What a great way to start the day!`\n\nMixer Mack Melson in Marfa, Texas. (Photo: Patrick Wymore)\n\n“Empowered and feeling good, immediately after that, I was thrown into an eight-page scene with six actors, all talking some scripted, some ad-libbing, all moving. I have filmed documentary style before and I quickly went back to that style of booming. Grabbing the most important sound to the story, using all my senses, listening for the key dialog as it was being generated, split-second, off the top of the heads of our actors. We had two to three handheld cameras, dancing and circling, creatively composing shots as we went on and on and on. The directors don’t always call ‘Action’ and ‘Cut.’ Instead, they say, ‘Off you go’ and ‘Thank you.’ That took a little getting used to, but again, the edict of this show is to be respectful of all involved, not to yell or get loud, unless safety is an issue. I was inspired and thrilled at how quickly I bonded with our two female camera operators, Julie Kirkwood and Shelly Gurzi, and their assistants, Zoe Van Brunt and Faith Brewer. We were in very tight, cramped quarters often. In one scene, I had to share a small space in a jail cell with six female actors and the camera crew while we shot a long, feminist-messaged ad-lib scene. This was an extraordinary experience and one I hope to repeat in the future. There was a slogan going around set inspired by Madame Gandhi, one of our actors and band members, ‘The Future Is Female.’ Needless to say. Jill Soloway and Sarah Gubbins are feminists and not afraid to get political.\n\nBoom Operator Eddie Casares with his newborn son and wife.\n\n“One special experience that really stuck with me on the show was an impromptu dance party we had shooting at a dusty location called the Skid in Pico Canyon. It was the end of a long, windy day when we moved into a small crowded room in a double-wide trailer. We were about to begin a long scene when our director, Andrea Arnold, instead of waiting for the final cast members to get ready, asked Sam for help. Ted always has a speaker available on set in case the director calls for mood music. He wheeled the speaker into the crowded room, hooked up the iPod and the dancing began. This particular night, we had a young cast of art students, no rehearsal, no line readings or stage direction. No UPM breathing down our necks. Only dancing with Andrea leading the pack for twenty minutes. What a fun way to reenergize the cast and crew. After the music stopped, we all geared up and began shooting the scene. We shot straight through and finished up in record time. This was definitely my first experience with a random dance party during the workday, led by the director. We had many female directors, with exception of Jim Frohna, the DP, who was so invested emotionally in the show, it was like having another they on set. I got to the point where I didn’t see gender as a primary defining characteristic of my co-workers, as it should be in a workplace. The set of I Love Dick proved to be more than I’d ever hoped to find in Hollywood. The gender equality came from the top down. They talked the talk and walked the walk, which is often rare on a film crew, especially when stress, anxiety and time push the crew to its limits.”\n\nArt students. (Photo: Jessica Brooks)\n\nWe use a pretty standard package of Lectrosonics wireless with Sanken COS-11 lavs and Sound Devices recorders. We added some Lectrosonics SSM transmitters to help with pack placement on some of the more tricky and minimal costumes, with the help of our wonderful on-set costumer, Pamela Waggoner. Pamela always worked with Ted to get the best sound even with the most challenging costumes.\n\nI have been using a Sennheiser EW 300 stereo IEM system for monitoring. I send all of the wires post-fade to one channel of the transmitter and a pre-fade boom to the other. This allows the boom operator to listen to the boom feed prefade, while the Utility can monitor both the boom and any wires I may be using. It is a very useful tool for this type of shooting, allowing the boom op to concentrate solely on the boom regardless of what last-second wires may be used.\n\nKathryn Hahn. (Photo: Leann Mueller)\n\nThe show takes place in Marfa, Texas, many of our exterior scenes had to be set in some pretty dusty desert-like environments which were pretty tough on the gear. Ted and I formulated ways to avoid all the mess and thus, a total redesign of the cart was born. The priority being able to close up everything and batten down the hatches! I also took the opportunity to increase my track count from the Sound Devices 788T to the 688, which is working out nicely so far.\n\nWorking with my brother, best friend and excellent Utility technician Ted, has been really tremendous. He is always looking one step ahead and preparing for it in advance, so we don’t have to scramble to pull something off in the moment of a new creative decision. He gets a lot of praise from our cast for having so many tricks and solutions for wireless mic and pack placement. It’s really nice to have someone on set to bounce ideas off of, help make technical decisions and as always, try to have a good laugh along the way. It has also become clear over the years that people seem to really like the fact we are brothers working together, it always elicits a good reaction.\n\nI also want to thank Mack Melson for mixing the Texas portion of the show and for everything sounding so good.\n\nMack Melson: “I met Jill through the UPM from Texas. Happily, I was available. My first impression was that I thought they were all nuts. On prep day, we had a beat change meeting with the actors, Jill and all the Department Heads, and I wasn’t sure what I had gotten myself into. It didn’t take long before I was dancing along with them. What an amazing group, and I don’t believe I’ve ever worked with a more positive and kind bunch of folks. Love ’em all! My Boom Operator was Patrick Wylie, Utility Audra Hughes, and they both fit in perfectly. Box, Box, Box, words you really come to appreciate. The whole experience reminded me why I got into filming in the first place.”\n\nMixer Sam Hamer, Utility Ted Hamer & Eddie Casares.\n\nLastly, I would like to give a shout-out to our Post Department, Supervisor Wade Barnett, Re-recording Mixers Andy D’Addario and Gary Gegan. They have to piece it all together from what sometimes seems like sonic chaos and yet, it always turns out wonderfully by the time they are through. With the cast giving one hundred percent at all times, even when off camera, I always make the effort to capture every word and nuance of off-screen dialog. We don’t need to worry so much about overlaps when all conversations are ‘on mic.’ Jill knows when they really want something clean and we often just pick up that moment.\n\nWe all loved working with the cast and crew on this big family and we all Love Dick.\n\nby Courtney M. Goodin\n\nWhen I started looking at some of the new small PCs to host some of the video playback software tools I have written over the last two decades or so, I discovered a large number of choices from various manufacturers that were quite capable and surprisingly, small and inexpensive.\n\nMany in the film and TV business have been stuck in the walled garden of Apple for so long, they haven’t ventured outside to see what is available to run some of the tools available or necessary to do our work. For on-screen video playback, most people are using the only small option available from Apple, the Mac Mini, which is overpriced and whose case is carved from a solid block of aluminum making it problematic to hide behind a display (no, gaffer tape won’t hold them). Besides video playback, many Production Sound Mixers are running a Mac Mini on their cart using BoomRecorder or Gallery Metacorder as a primary recording tool. They may have the need every now and then to run some utilities for Venue control or mixer configuration or sound file editing or conversion. A solution in the past has been to just install Windows on the Mac under Bootcamp or using Parallels, VR Fusion or some other virtual machine software. Well, that comes at a cost. A standalone license of Windows costs more than $100 and the virtual machine software another $79 or so and of course, if there is a hardware failure of the Mac, you lose both systems. Also, the Apple Bootcamp drivers and the virtual machine drivers are not very good and most don’t support hardware acceleration for video decoding. There is a solution that can be cheaper and more versatile, and that is a separate mini-Windows PC and a HDMI/USB KVM switch.\n\nIntel started things off in the tiny PC market with their NUC (New Unit of Computing), which were small reference designs of single-board computers about the size of a two inch stack of CDs and about forty percent smaller than the Mac Mini. Then they introduced the first Stick PC that contained a full PC in a package about the size of a double pack of gum or a bloated USB thumb drive. Many of these are small enough to be stuck to the back of your monitor and are light enough (only 1.5 to 2.7 ounces) to support their own weight off the built-in HDMI connector. Some are completely fanless, so they make a good way to turn any HDTV or monitor into a full PC, which can be used on a soundstage or recording studio without having to worry about additional noise.\n\nMy use however, was for video playback on set, and I made some amazing discoveries in these small PCs. They are very capable of playing back HD (H.264 encoded) video. Specifically, I found that the units based on the Intel Bay Trail quad core Atom Z3735F chipset like the Azulle Quantum Access Stick PC and the original Intel Stick PC were even able to decode and play back up to nine HD video files simultaneously at full frame rate. This is very useful for simulating security video consoles or TV studio multiview displays. Although they are tiny, they are full Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 computers and will run any software that will run on your average Windows desktop. They support tenpoint touch screens and have built-in WiFi 802.11 a/b/n and Bluetooth 4. The most common configuration for these Atom SoC (System on Chip)-based machines is 2GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of eMMS storage for the operating system and programs and/or media files. Most have flush mount slots for a Micro SD card for additional storage that allows you to expand your storage an additional 32GB to 128GB pretty cheaply and is easily removable so you can pop it out and load it up with your video from another computer. Although these chips are actually 64-bit quad core CPUs, most use the 32-bit version of Windows since they only have 2GB of non-upgradeable onboard RAM, so don’t need the additional 64-bit OS overhead necessary for addressing more than two gigabytes of RAM.\n\nThe stick versions can plug directly into an HDMI port on any monitor or TV and some can even pull power from a nearby USB port on the back of the TV. (Most require about 2.5 amps of 5-volt power so beware; this may not work on your set.)\n\nNewer versions of the small PCs use the next-generation Atom Cherry Trail line of chips like the X5-Z8300 that run a little faster base clock speed and include USB 3 support. But I believe that USB 3 support takes a toll on video playback performance and interferes with WiFi and Bluetooth throughput. On most of the Stick PC form factors, the antennas for WiFi and Bluetooth are just copper traces printed on the circuit board. And because of the tiny board, there is not enough on-board real estate to move them out of the range of the EMI from the CPU, GPU and especially, the USB 3 ports. This interference can reduce the range and increase packet loss in the WiFi and Bluetooth radios. This is especially problematic on a film set that is full of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz RF pollution from wireless focus controls and HD video transmitters. Not to mention the hundred or so smartphones pinging the stage’s WiFi to pick up email, tweet or stream the latest YouTube meme while the idle on-camera artists await their moment of glory. Of the units I tested, only the Quantum Access Stick moved the antennas outside the case, which makes them much better at WiFi connectivity and fewer dropouts if using Bluetooth for streaming audio. The QA Stick also has the older Bay Trail chipset and it doesn’t support USB 3, which is a good thing for my use. The additional increased polling speed to support the USB 3 buss takes critical interrupt time away from the GPU and CPU for decoding and display. Of course, if your application doesn’t include playing back more than three or four video files simultaneously, you may not notice the hit on the video playback performance in the newer Cherry Trail Z8300, although the interference of USB 3 with WiFi and Bluetooth is still an issue.\n\nThe good news is that these fully functional PCs with a full licensed version of Windows 10 Home are priced around $100-$175. Some are even available for as low as $79 if you shop around. They are available from a large number of suppliers in a variety of configurations and cases with some supporting VGA ports and additional USB ports and LAN ports or analog audio outputs (All support digital audio embedded in the HDMI output). All use the Intel Graphics on-chip integrated GPU and the drivers support hardware (GPU) decoding of most compressed video and audio formats like H.264 and HEV or MP3. Because of the single-chip design and internal memory pipelining, this allows them to decode several streams of HD video simultaneously without putting too much strain on the CPU.\n\nIn my quest, I tested a variety of configurations and models from no-name units ordered directly from China with names like Tronsmart and VoYo to name brands like Asus, Lenovo, Intel or Azulle. Most had the same 2GB RAM and 32GB eMMC HD configuration, although some are available in 4GB RAM and 64GB or even 128GB eMMC hard drive.\n\nIn this class of machines, heat is your enemy and can cause a degradation of performance if the unit gets too hot. They all include Intel’s thermal power management in the EFI BIOS, which will throttle down the clock speed of some of the cores and even halve the GPU clock speed if the chip’s temperature exceeds a point that would cause damage to the chips or board. This speed throttling is dynamic and transparent to the user unless you are pushing the unit to the max (like playing back nine videos at the same time). Because of this, the Stick PCs from Intel and those based on their reference board design include a tiny fan (about ¾” in diameter) to help dissipate some of the heat when running full tilt. There is a slightly audible whine heard from these fans if you put your ear right down within a few inches of them, but it will probably be inaudible in most environments. The Azulle Quantum Access Stick has no fan and a sealed case without vent holes but surprisingly, in my testing, it seemed to be able to handle heat dissipation better than the units with fans and vents. Perhaps this is because of the case design that seems to be made of a metal or carbon particle impregnated plastic with a ridged surface on both sides to act like a heat sink to dissipate the heat over a larger surface area using simple convection. And as mentioned above, it is the only one that moves the antennas off the circuit board so they can spread the components out some to help dissipate heat.\n\nSome of the larger units like the VoYo or the Kangaroo have internal lithium polymer batteries which can run the units for a short period of time from twenty minutes for the VoYo to several hours for the Kangaroo if you lose external power. This can come in handy on the set where things get unplugged by accident all the time without warning or you have to move from one location to another without having to shut down.\n\nAll the units mentioned here now come with Windows 10 installed and some are even Dual Boot with Windows and Android 4.4 installed. Although, those units with dual OS have a lot less free space available on the 32GB eMMC internal drive. Most with Windows only, have about 13GB-18GB free and the dual boot with Android drops that free space down to about 8GB to 12GB. However, all units reviewed here have Micro SD card slots so the storage can be expanded cheaply with 32GB to 128GB Micro SD cards. They will all run Microsoft Office full version and will do an admirable job running PowerPoint, Excel or Word. They can play Adobe Director files for interactive display. I have even run older versions of Photoshop (ver. 7) or Photoshop LE and other useful utilities like Video-to-Video encoding software or open source recorders/players like VLC and Audacity. They all have at least one full-size USB port (type A) and some add a second full-size or micro-size OTG USB port. The larger units also throw in a LAN port and USB 3 ports for interfacing external storage or adding additional displays. That’s right; with a small outboard Pluggable DisplayLink USB dongle, you can add an additional two displays. So, one of the small sticks can actually feed three different displays at the same time. If you want them to display 30-frame video at full speed, you may have to drop the resolution of the additional displays down to 720p. (A limitation of the USB 2 port.)\n\nAlthough there is not room in this article to review them, if you need an integrated touchscreen display, there are many Windows tablet PCs available using the same chipsets as the stick and all about one-fourth the cost of the cheapest iPad. Also, small laptops like the Lenovo 100S or 2-in-1 (tablet/laptop combos) like the Vulcan VTA1005XBM 32, are under $200. I’ve even found eight-inch tablets like the CHUI H8 with 1920×1080 ips touchscreens and USB ports and external HDMI connector for around $150.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CAVEATS\n\nFor my use (video playback sources), I found the Quantum Access Atom Z3735F units to be the best. Their lack of USB 3 (which I don’t need) improves their performance and the external antenna makes the WiFi and Bluetooth performance much better. If I can find them, I prefer the Windows 8.1 OS for playback. I can install a thirdparty UI like “Classic Shell” to deal with the lame 8.1 tile-based user interface and get back to an interface more like Windows 7. Windows 10 improved the user interface somewhat, but the problem with Windows 10 is that Microsoft removed the ability to turn off automatic updates in the latest versions and one thing you don’t want is to suddenly have your on-set monitor tell you to stand by while it downloads five gigabytes of “important” updates. You can turn off automatic updates in Windows 8.1 and as long as I don’t use these devices for surfing the net to questionable websites, I don’t have to worry about viruses or security holes. If I’m not using WiFi to remotely control the unit, I can just put the OS in Airplane Mode. None of these units come with keyboards or mice, so you will have to add a Bluetooth or USB keyboard and or mouse or touchpad. I am partial to the iPazzport mini- Bluetooth keyboard (model KP-810-19BT). It is about the size of a small TV remote and has a built-in touchpad for mouse control and thumb-operated keyboard with all the keys of a full-sized keyboard, including F1-F12 and cursor arrow keys. This unit is small enough to slip in my shirt pocket or stick behind the monitor with a little Velcro. Besides the Bluetooth version, they also make an RF 2.4 GHz model that has a mini-USB dongle. These can be had for under $20 if you shop around on Amazon or eBay.\n\nTip: If you are stuck with Windows 10 and need to be on the internet for some reason, you can change an advanced setting in the network configuration panel to treat your WiFi access point as a “Metered” connection. This will prevent Windows from automatically checking for and downloading updates over any wireless connection designated as “Metered.” However, if you plug in an Ethernet cable that has an internet connection, it will suddenly go to town downloading tons of updates without asking permission. This, while it happens in the background, can adversely affect video playback smoothness or worse case, ask you to restart the computer after it finishes downloading.\n\nThe small Stick PCs are small enough to slide two or three of them into the pouch on my laptop case with their small power supplies and a small iPazzport wireless keyboard/touchpad and be ready for any video playback “emergency.” You know the one, where the Director or Producer comes up and says, “I know we didn’t talk about it but can you put up this animated logo on these three sixty-inch displays that the Art Director built into the set last night?” You can save the day and maybe even get a little more box rental for the extra video source feeds.v\n\nby Daron James\n\nWill Smith in Bright, set in a world where mystical creatures live side by side with humans. A human cop is forced to work with an Orc to find a weapon everyone is prepared to kill for. (Photo: Scott Garfield)\n\nWillow Jenkins’ first credit on a fi lm was “Master of Time and Space.” The joke title was given to him by Producer Butch Robinson and First Assistant Director Mike Ellis on The Original Kings of Comedy, a documentary directed by Spike Lee. But it was absolutely fi tting as his persistent hard work managed to catch the eye of Lee during production in San Diego, California. “I’m very thankful for the career I have now and I tribute a lot of it to Spike,” says Jenkins during a morning phone call.\n\nA Madison Wisconsin, native, the film enthusiast was living in San Diego taking on free production jobs to get his foot in the door while his wife finished her master’s degree. “I remember getting a call for a two-week paid gig and I was so stoked to be there. I really worked my ass off and day one, a PA comes over and says, ‘Spike wants to see you.’ I thought there is no way this is true because I hadn’t even seen him yet, but it was. I went over and Spike motioned for me to lie down next to him as we surveilled the Navy beach set and then asked me to clean up some debris off the beach so I did. The next day, he sees me working and tells me to go get a car for lunch. When I did, he said, ‘Get in, you’re driving.’”\n\nFrom that moment on, Jenkins continued to work on the project as his driver and assistant, traveling to Hawaii, then to Texas and New York, always being there for Lee when he needed him—a master of time and space. “He saw something in me and gave me an opportunity I didn’t want to spoil. It was my fi rst project with him and I’ve managed to work on almost everything he’s done since.”\n\nSpike was the one who suggested Jenkins to consider becoming a Video Assist Operator. “Growing up, I was the kid who always wanted to set up your home entertainment system or plug things in. I honestly just enjoyed being on a film set but in retrospect, Spike nailed it. I absolutely love this job. You’re right in the middle of it all, seeing the director’s creative process and you still have these massive technical challenges that need to be overcome.”\n\nWillow Jenkins readies his system for a multiple stage shoot while Carlos Patzi sits in the background preparing a second system. Transferring footage and getting ready to handle two stages the following week. (Photo: Scott Garfield)\n\nThis year alone, you’ll see Jenkins’ name scroll by in the credits on four feature films as Key Video Assist or Video Assist. “It’s been busy to say the least,” says Jenkins, who’s schedule started to fi ll after finding himself on The Revenant, his most demanding project to date. “That was a film where you had to push yourself to a whole new level. We traveled to the southernmost part of Argentina to finish the movie, which was wild because the entire crew and our equipment flew together on a private 767 aircraft. It took about twenty-seven hours to get there because we had to wait six hours on the ground while refueling in Peru for fog to clear in Ushuaia,” he recalls.\n\nWhen they did arrive, the camera crew wasted no time testing lenses in subzero temperatures well beyond midnight with Jenkins and Video Assist Rob Lynn following suit checking their own equipment. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ASC, AMC utilized five different cameras for the swift-moving production, making it necessary for Jenkins and Lynn to utilize a separate wireless system for each package. “We had no choice but to be quick, super mobile and keep batteries hot. It was important to have the wireless up at all times so they didn’t need to wait for our signal to lock.” While Lynn stationed himself at a briefcase running QTAKE, video assist software, and their own channel of headsets for constant communications, Jenkins was acting as a human tripod for a roving camera, holding a handheld monitor for Director Alejandro Iñárritu and Leonardo DiCaprio, who was very involved. “I had to stand five feet from them basically at all times,” laughs Jenkins.\n\nThe process trailer getting set to pull out.\n\nWhile 2017’s releases of A Futile & Stupid Gesture (Director David Wain), The Evil Within (Director Andrew Getty) and The Circle (Director James Ponsoldt), starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson had challenges of their own for the operator, larger obstacles loomed on Bright by Director David Ayer.\n\nThe big-budget Netflix original film set to be released December 2017 ushers viewers inside a present-day fantasy world where humans coexist with mythical creatures. Will Smith stars as Ward, a Los Angeles Police Department officer who patrols the night watch with an orc cop named Jakoby played by Joel Edgerton. When an evil darkness emerges, they fight to protect a young female elf (Lucy Fry) and a forgotten-yet-powerful relic she holds that can alter their existence.\n\nWillow rigging a wireless feed for Jake Scott.\n\nIt was Production Sound Mixer Lisa Piñero who recommended Jenkins for the job. “When I met with David, we were having a great conversation when it abruptly stopped. When I was officially hired the next day, I was told we had a great interview and found that when he makes up his mind, he doesn’t spend anymore time on it. That quality translated well with him as a director on set which was a great thing,” says Jenkins.\n\nFor the first sixty production days, Jenkins operated seven days straight working Saturday-Wednesday on Bright and Thursday-Friday on another series he committed to, Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later. “The turnarounds weren’t bad and the material we were doing on Wet Hot was completely different.”\n\nThe process trailer getting set to pull out.\n\nBright had a two-man team every day with a third filling several times during production. There was also a second unit with two additional video assist operators. “For the main unit, it was me and mostly, Willie Tipp, Carlos Patzi and Byron Echeverria swapping out week by week but we also had Michael Bachman, Chris Kessler and Anthony Perkins on days where we needed three,” says Jenkins. “I’m so thankful Damiana Kamishin, the Production Supervisor, allowed us to do this project properly. Major credit goes to her and Producer Adam Merims for being wise and approving my requests as much as they did.” Carrying out the second unit stunt test days was Dave Schmalz and the second unit shooting was handled by Anthony Perkins and Chris Kessler until Jenkins helped out during the last week of intense stunt work.\n\nThe schedule called for three months of night shoots without breaking for lunch, moving through practical locations in the rain and cold. Gear needed to be hidden and far away behind buildings while still offering viewing feeds for the director and Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov, who preferred to be right in the action.\n\nTom Hanks stars in STX Entertainment’s The Circle.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nTo prepare, Jenkins reads the script but it doesn’t tell him how the crew will operate. It’s important for him to adjust to the shooting methods of the director and cinematographer on each project. “During pre-production, I will talk to the ADs or anyone who’s worked with the director before to get as much information as I can,” notes Jenkins. “I’ll then try to find out how many cameras there will be, and on Bright it was two but a lot of times three. I’ll try to find out how the ACs work if there is somehow a focus monitor that sits off somewhere. I will also find out who the key grip is and see how they work. Then I’ll add up all the variables and find out what’s the best way we can approach the project.”\n\nSince audiences will be watching on Netflix and it allowed Ayer and Vasyanov to be close to the action, they wanted to see the footage through an iPad. “Roman lived on the iPad Pro. He was actually lighting by it in many ways so he would know how it would translate to dailies later.” Wireless systems that transmit video like Teredek’s Bolt 3000 series were crucial to the work. On-set cameras would send a wireless feed to the DIT cart run by Arthur To. Then To would send a Rec. 709 or an image with a LUT to Jenkins’ cart where he could feed set monitors and video village. Four rotating iPad Pros had QTAKE installed on them for Ayer and Vasyanov to select one camera or split screen up to four to watch a live feed or playback footage. “Arthur and I had to figure out a system to get the iPads up and running as quickly as possible because a lot of the times Roman would want it even before camera was off the truck.”\n\nSound Mixer Lisa Piñero and Director David Ayers\n\nThe crew found that out on the second day while shooting a scene that closed off a busy Los Angeles intersection—Alvarado and 7th near Langer’s Deli. “We shut down the whole street in all directions and this was our first big setup with three hundred extras all outfitted in other-worldly makeup and dress. We quickly deduced where we needed to be and where video village had to go and it was pretty far from the action. And just as we got settled, Roman was already asking for his iPad. He really didn’t know who we were so we needed to make a good first impression. The first challenge was power. Then as soon as we connected to Arthur, the DIT, Roman instructed him to move about 175’ down the street toward the action and away from us. With every second counting, we were thankfully able to get our feed from the DIT by asking Arthur to move back six feet just in time. Once we got our system going, set decoration stepped in to hide our transmitter while Willie [Tipp] got electric to help us with power. When we handed off the iPads, we found out they were getting into a police cruiser and decided to back up further down the road to start the run—something we didn’t factor in. Luckily, the wireless system worked and we managed to pull it off,” Jenkins admits. “It was one of those moments where you say to yourself, so this is how it’s going to be? Wow, OK. But then you develop a system, find your groove and it makes things easier.”\n\nThe team became very efficient with the iPad system and particularly good adapting to challenging interference issues Jenkins looks forward to employing the system on future projects. “Our job is a lot about anticipation. We would try and read their minds and be handing them the iPad the moment they turned to ask us.”\n\nIn The Revenant, renowned filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman, Babel) directs Leonardo DiCaprio on set.

Echeverria handled the video assist on the second unit since Ayer needed to be involved in both sets at the same time. “The challenge for us was making sure he could see everything everywhere at any given time,” says Jenkins.\n\nThey ended up running snake cables and wireless between the stages and sent feeds in both directions to make the setups at L.A. Center Studios identical. “Doing this allowed David to run back-and-forth between sets with his iPads. We used a roving monitor with a live switcher attached to the top so he could manually choose the feed between the three main stage cameras and the two cameras from the action unit stage. It was a technological feat to give him the ability to review a shot next door, send approval to the action unit director or see a rehearsal or grab an iPad to view all the cameras at once or select them individually.”\n\nWhen asked about working with Ayer, Jenkins says, “He’s a phenomenal person who surrounds himself with the best of the best as far as crew and talent goes. Once you get to know his sense of humor, which is very dark, and he starts saying hysterical things that bring the level down, you know you’re doing your job right because that’s his way of complimenting you.”\n\nby Michael Krikorian CAS\n\nStudio photos by Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nThis Is Us is an hour-long single-camera episodic TV show produced by 20th Century Fox for NBC with wall-to-wall dialog. I received a call to work on the pilot last year late February and was blown away when I read the script. I’m a tough critic when I read through scripts but the pilot moved me. It was by far one of the best scripts I have read and I was extremely excited to be working on it.\n\nI called Erin Paul to boom and Tim O’Malley for utility and lucky for me, they both were available. Erin, Tim and I had worked with each other on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., American Horror Story and a few other shows on their double-up units. We became fast friends, worked well together and got along great, which to me is a godsend. I can’t recall ever having a disagreement with Erin or Tim, except when Tim doesn’t let Erin and I know that crafty brought some hot food onstage. Erin and I give Tim the works but of course, it is all in fun.\n\nErin Paul and Tim O’Malley at the grocery store.\n\nThe show was picked up with a scheduled start date for the and of July. We had a pickup order for thirteen episodes, but after our first episode aired, we received an order for sixteen episodes, then shortly after that, they bumped it up to eighteen.\n\nMichael Krikorian CAS at the controls.\n\nAs with most TV shows, it is important that we capture the dialog with the best means possible in the environment we are given. Boom Operator Erin Paul is the frontman, he reads through the sides and nails down his cues. Erin is solid and smooth with the mic and in full communication with our camera operators working out the framing. Tim, sound utility, preps the wireless mics and handles all the wiring of our actors. His wiring skills are spot on and he is familiar with all the current equipment, making him invaluable to our sound team. On top of that, the actors love him. Erin, Tim and I talk through the scene after we have seen a marking rehearsal, and we stay alert and pay attention to what is up next. A well-informed crew will always be ahead of the curveball.\n\nMixing our night shot.\n\nOur first season was shot on the Paramount lot on two stages and a swing stage. Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth’s (Susan Kelechi Watson) house is on one stage while Jack and Rebecca’s (played by Milo Ventimiglia and Mandy Moore) house is on another. The exterior scenes of the houses are shot on location, while most of the Pennsylvania and New York exterior scenes are on the backlot.\n\nMusic playback day with Mark Agostino.\n\nIt is a fast-paced show, with lots of moves per day, and because of that, we have to have everything on the follow cart for our next location. To make our moves quicker, we often load up on a stake bed. Luckily for us, we have an AD Department that keeps us well informed.\n\nThere are times we need to take a stand for sound. In keeping with the style of the show that the producers want, Yasu Tanida, the Director of Photography, uses hard lighting and some practicals to light the set. The show is full of time jumps, flashbacks and present-day scenes, so the lighting changes depending on what time period we are in. For the most part, Yasu does accommodate our requests and stays away from wide and tights and helps with the lighting where he can. When Erin can’t get what is needed with one boom because he will have to cross through some lights, Tim will come in and utilize a second boom. We zone-out the booms and at times, fl y a wire in the mix until the actor crosses the lighting threshold into our booming zones. It gets tricky in the larger scenes but we are always able to come up with some creative way to get what is needed. I find we can get the dialog a bit tighter sounding with two booms, especially with all the overlapping we do. Our directors like the natural feel of the acting with overlaps. We don’t stop or redo a take for sound, though there are times when I’ll request to record a certain line clean. I’ll bring up my concerns to the director if the line gets buried and more often than not, we will do another take to get the line cleaner. This is a show with wallto- wall dialog and our objective is keeping the actors out of the ADR stage. If we can make a simple adjustment to get what we need, I’ll be sure to request it. Yasu and our directors have been pretty fl exible and easy to work with.\n\nAn interior scene with Milo Ventimiglia and Mandy Moore “A Handful of Moments.”\n\nWe wire everyone who has scripted lines when we aren’t restricted by wardrobe or a shirtless actor and on occasion, we will wire actors even if they don’t have any lines. We communicate with our directors to see if they are expecting any dialog adjustments and try to get a jump on it and wire that actor. We often get some great reaction sounds that make it to air. When it comes to mixing the show, the actors generally stick to the script but when they change it up, we have enough time to make the needed adjustments. The actors have been great to work with and we have had no pushback when it comes to putting mics on them.\n\nSusan Kelechi Watson as Beth, Ron Cephas Jones as William.\n\nWhile This Is Us is a straightforward show when it comes to recording the dialog, we sometimes have music playback with our Pro Tools 11 rig. The playback cart has a MacBook Pro running PT11 with a MOTU 828x interface. We use a Mackie 1204, Phonak Earwigs, QSC 2450 amps and JBL SRX715 passive speakers. We’ve had Jeff Haddad, Mark Agostino and Gary Raymond in to run the playback. For non-sync atmosphere, we get a handful of stems to suit what our actor wants to hear. Primarily, it is Mandy Moore needing playback, but we also had a live record with Chrissy Metz (Kate) and also Brian Tyree Henry (William’s cousin Ricky). We use speakers onstage and earwigs for the band during scenes that have dialog over music. This gets us the best results for capturing the band and the dialog simultaneously. I started in music recording, so anytime we do live music records, it makes for a fun time and a great challenge.\n\nErin Paul at William’s AA group.\n\nWhen we do driving scenes, it is a mix of free driving and process trailers. I’ll pull my recorder off the cart and Tim will start wiring up "
