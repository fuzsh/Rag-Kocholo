        "text": "Super is at the hospital because of a mishap while he and Donald were giving a tour of the new comedy park area. Super tried out the Comedy Ride and went through the Surprise Tunnel. The surprise turned out to be the car blowing up and Super getting hosed in the face. Back in the studio, Kelita sings \"The Strong One\". Super is visited in the hospital by Rummy Bishop, who Donald believes is Super's favourite comic. Jerry Reed sings \"Guitar Man\". It seems Super is going to be okay, but they decide to send him for more x-rays just to be sure."
