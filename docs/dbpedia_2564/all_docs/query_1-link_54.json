        "text": "The cast Curb Your Enthusiasm are paying tribute to one of their own following the sad news that comedian and actor Bob Einstein has passed away after a battle with cancer.\n\nEinstein played Larry David's long-time frenemy Marty Funkhouser on the HBO series, and was also beloved by generations of comedy fans for bungling countless death-defying feats as TV stuntman Super Dave Osborne for more than 30 years.\n\nNews of his passing was announced by his brother, actor Albert Brooks, who tweeted on Wednesday (January 2): \"R.I.P. My dear brother Bob Einstein. A great brother, father and husband. A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever.\"\n\nAlso paying tribute to Einstein were several of his Curb Your Enthusiasm co-stars. David said there was \"no-one like [Einstein]\" in a statement to CNN, while Richard Lewis shared his \"shock\" at his passing in multiple remembrances on social media.\n\n\"I’m in shock. I knew him forever,\" Lewis tweeted. \"To his loved ones. His long career is hard to match. His role on #curbyourenthusiasm was excruciatingly brilliant! Our cast and crew will be devastated. He was so loved. He told me how much he loved LD [Larry David] and Curb. RIP buddy.\"\n\nAlso remembering Einstein was David's former on-screen wife Cheryl Hines, who shared: \"We lost a friend today. ♥️ thanks for all of the laughs on Curb Your Enthusiasm. Our love to Bob’s family. #BobEinstein #SuperDave. The comedy world will miss you.\"\n\nEinstein appeared in the most recent ninth season of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, which received mostly positive reviews when it premiered in the autumn of 2017.\n\nHBO has since ordered a tenth season, which went into production last October. It is not yet known if Einstein was able to film any episodes before his passing."
