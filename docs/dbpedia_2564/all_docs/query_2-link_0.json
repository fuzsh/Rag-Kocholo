        "text": "Super Dave is late for his new show, but his car arrives performing handbrake turns. Super attempts to open his show with a question period. Ray Charles sings \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\". At the Super Dave Memorial Sports Arena, the Super Dave Slam Dunkers perform acrobatic slam dunks. Fuji helps Super Dave perform the \"Ultimate Slam Dunk\" using a hydraulic catapult that will raise him upright and shoot him into the air where he will catch the ball and slam dunk it.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, we're stopping... no we're not.\" Instead of raising him upright, the catapult smashes him into the glass basketball backboard. Later, while inspecting the controls, the entire hoop rig falls on him.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"I'm bleeding internally, Mike, but I think I'll have a little gauze for dinner and then I'll be fine.\"\n\nThe Last Word: He thanks the Super Dave slam dunkers, Ray Charles, and Carol Burnett. \"I'd like to tug my ear and say a special goodnight to you, but I can't move my arms.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: A white four door.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Beige and dark purple plaid jacket, white shirt, red tie and hanky, black pants (Later bright yellow), black shoes.\n\nSpecial Guest Star: Carol Burnett, who heckles Super Dave at the start of the show.\n\nSuper Dave interviews a woman in the audience who dubiously claims to have had Elvis Presley's baby, and a woman who claims to be carrying Warren Beatty's child. Jenny Jones performs standup comedy. Super Dave originally plans to play \"Vehicle Tag\" with Fuji, but instead shows off the new Outdoor Lip-Synching Concert Area, where he plays the piano and lip-synchs to \"The Name Game\" by Shirley Ellis.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Fuji, mistakenly thinking they are still going to play \"Vehicle Tag\" runs over him with a monster truck during his encore performance.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Yeah, putz, I'm perfect. My intestines look like your pants. I just wish I had my hands back so I could give you the finger.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"Remember, kids, don't try this stunt at home. On second thought, don't watch this show at home.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red motorbike and sidecar.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Bright yellow jacket, white shirt, red tie and hanky, red, yellow, and black plaid pants, white shoes.\n\nAt the Super Dave Confidence Training Area, Super Dave, accompanied by Donald, receives the \"Man of the Year\" award from the Academy of Human Performance. Robert Gruenberg juggles a chainsaw, an egg, and an apple. Kathy Walker and Bill Roberts do impersonations of Joan Rivers and Sonny Bono, rounding it off doing Sonny and Cher singing \"I Got You Babe\". At the Super Dave Vehicle Safety Centre, Super Dave acts as a crash test dummy and drives into a wall to demonstrate the dangers of not buckling up.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, I'm speeding up, and I can see the wall, and I'm dead.\" After crashing the car, getting out, and giving some additional tips, Super Dave states he doesn't have the energy to return to the car. Mike, trying to help, suggests the car be brought to him, which ends up running him down.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"You know, Mike, I don't know if I ever told you this before, but glass is good roughage. Yeah, Butt-breath, I'm perfect.\"\n\nThe Last Word: A seatbelt safety poem:\n\n\"Roses are red,\n\nMike you're a putz,\n\nif I hadn't been wearing my seatbelt,\n\nI could have squashed my knees.\"\n\n(\"I would have said nuts, but my knees are where my nuts used to be.\")\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red hovercraft.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and purple plaid jacket, red tie and hanky, white shirt, black pants. Later: Bright yellow jacket, red tie with diagonal white stripes, red hanky, white shirt, black pants.\n\nSuper Dave attempts to do a comedy sketch with Cynthia Belliveau and John Hemphill entitled \"Plastic Surgery to Celebrity's Pets\" in which Super plays the Doctor. The Smothers Brothers Tom and Dick sing a lively Spanish tune, but Tom screws it up (accidentally?) by singing in German and Dick begins his insult rampage, which results in Super lecturing the Brothers about cussing on television. At the Heavy Metal Motorcycle Preparation Area, Super Dave attempts the \"Super Ride Straight to Hell\" in which he will jump a three inch wide ramp and land on another three inch wide ramp across the field.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Here we go, going down and heading for the track. Rockets kick in... and I missed it.\" He crashes into a shed.\n\nThe Last Word: A poem for all his horse loving friends:\n\n\"Roses are red,\n\nViolets are blue,\n\nThe next time you see Thunderclap,\n\nHe'll probably be glue.\"\n\n(\"Just kidding. Don't write me, I love animals. I hired Mike, didn't I?\")\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave rocket dirt bike.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Sky blue jacket, red and white striped tie, white shirt, red hanky, black pants, black shoes.\n\nSpecial Guest Star: John Davidson sings \"Let Your Love Flow\" right before Super Dave's stunt, while Super Dave unsuccessfully tries to remain seated on a wild horse in the background.\n\nA press conference at the Municipal Court House reveals that Super Dave is bringing Time magazine to court for accusing him of being a frivolous spender. A news report comes on regarding the death of a famous Elvis Impersonator, and many fellow impersonators come to pay their last respects. Comedian Rip Taylor performs prop comedy and does a tribute to Super Dave. At the Super Dave Vehicle Safety Centre, Super, with help from Fuji, attempts to explain to the public how to avoid becoming a victim of a \"Bump and Rob\".\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, I'm looking in the mirror, and I can judge Fuji's about 30 yards behind me. I check again, he's about 10 yards. I check again, and my life is over.\" Instead of just bumping Super's Car, Fuji flattens him into a wall with a cement truck. While Super is incapacitated, Fuji grabs his wallet and takes Mike out to dinner.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Be sure you tune in next week because we're going to show you some never before seen Super Dave home movies. They're my X-rays.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red motorbike and sidecar.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Bright yellow jacket, red tie with grey stripes, red hanky, sky blue shirt, black pants, black shoes.\n\nSuper opens the show by thanking his fans for their support and shows the video from BIZARRE of him lip-synching \"9 to 5\" by Dolly Parton. Steve Allen wants to play the piano, but Super Dave pressures him to play \"Soap Opera Mad Libs\" instead with the audience. In the Super Dave Compound's vast marshland, Super Dave and Donald show off their giant Pan-Lux board which was built despite protests that it would never stay up in the swamp. Donald also shows his plans for the Super Dave Prayer Tower.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I see a 700 foot Pan-Lux board that someday is gonna bring me great pleasure. Unfortunately, it's not today.\" Turns out the Pan-Lux board can't stand up in the swamp after all, and it falls on him.\n\nThe Last Word: He promises the audience they'll still hear Steve play, but they run out of time right as they cut back to the studio.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave Swamp Vehicle, with tank treads.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, grey, white and black striped tie, white hanky, white shirt, white pants, black shoes.\n\nMike Walden announces that Super Dave is going to attempt to break the triathlon record! Matt Fundal from the \"Super Dave Hula Hoop School\" performs hoop tricks. Super begins the course by swimming, while Fuji Hakayito follows in his boat with a harpoon in case of shark attack. K.D. Lang sings \"Tune Into My Wave\". Super, despite being injured, moves on to cycling. The Nylons sing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". Super then attempts the running part of the triathlon and goes on to break the record!\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: During the swimming, he does indeed get attacked by a shark, and Fuji accidentally shoots him multiple times. While he is cycling, he gets knocked down by a van. After the running, he is exhausted and needs an ambulance. The ambulance arrives, running Super Dave over and dragging him away a good distance.\n\nThe Last Word: \"If you feel like it, you could applaud for another few seconds, cause i'm going to be in this bowing position for at least a mile and a half.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: On waterskis behind the Super Dave Boat, making a rather undignified landing.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, grey, white and black striped tie, white hanky, white shirt, black pants, black shoes.\n\nSuper plays \"Meet the Audience\" where he talks to audience members and asks what they do, including a humorous pair who play armpit music, and an unlikely looking woman who just became a mother. Ronnie Hawkins, the head of the \"Super Dave Rock and Roll School\", sings \"Mary Lou\" by Bob Seger. At the Super Dave Test Site, General Earl Pennington from the US Armed Forces helps Super Dave demonstrate his new invention, \"Bullet Proof Paint\" by having his men shoot at Super while he is in a car.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Mike, impressed by the demonstration, asks the general to up the ante by getting his men to use heavy artillery on the car. The bazooka finishes him off.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"I'm too upset to even swear.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"I would like to squeeze his fat face until his butt turned the colour of his coat. Here I am, a human marshmallow, left alone to drive myself to the hospital. The star of my own show. Great, now the battery's dead. What difference does it make? I'm dead too.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: Super Dave's \"Bullet Proof Painted\" car.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and purple plaid jacket, white shirt, red tie and hanky, navy blue pants, black shoes.\n\nSuper Dave makes a passionate stand against the colourization of old black and white films. A dance act is planned with \"The Christopher Dancers\", but as only one of them shows up, Super dismisses him. KD Lang sings \"Angel with a Lariat\". The lone Christopher Dancer returns and manages to perform a group act, to \"ABC\" and \"The Love You Save\" by the Jackson Five. On the compound, Super Dave tries to perform the \"Invisible Wall\" stunt, in which Fuji will sprinkle Magic Dust on the ground, and Super will drive a car with no brakes through it, and the \"Invisible Wall\" created by the dust will stop the car before it hits a bulldozer.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: The invisible wall does not work, and Super crashes right into the bulldozer. And as if that isn't enough, the bulldozer driver misunderstands Fuji's request to make room for the ambulance and drives forward, flattening the car.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Yeah, I'm fine. This is exactly what I wanted to happen.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"Uh oh, I have no pulse. It looks like I'm not gonna live. Well, at least if I die, I could be on Geraldo Rivera.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: A red ATV.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and purple plaid jacket, white shirt, red tie and hanky, beige pants, yellow shoes. Later: Same, but with white pants and brown shoes.\n\nSuper Dave talks to Leo Thompson, a \"Kiss Doctor\" who improves people's lives simply by kissing them. He tries it on audience members and it seems to work, but when he tries it on Super Dave, the Super one is less than pleased! Super Dave holds the Million Dollar Contest where a \"Mystery Superstar\" comes out and plays a song, and viewers have to phone in and guess the title and the artist. At the Super Dave Chapel, Super attempts to do a concentration exercise where Super will tell a joke and Fuji will keep trying to distract him.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Fuji's idea of a distraction is to drop a wrecking ball on Super. He ends up as his signature \"Head on Shoes\", which miraculously still manages to walk around.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Sure, putz. I've never felt better in my life.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"You know, I may have lost my balance and part of my breath, but at least I still have my dignity.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: A red motorbike.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and purple plaid jacket, red tie and hanky, white shirt, black pants, black shoes.\n\nSpecial Guest Star: Jerry Lee Lewis as the \"Mystery Superstar\".\n\nSuper and Donald show off the new Super Dave Plastic Surgery Area, where Super brings out \"Donny Osmond\", who has had a massive height reduction. He and Super lip-synch to Donny and Marie's \"I'm a Little Bit Country\". Jean and Michel Foubrac, from the Super Dave bicycle compound, play \"La Marche de Toreador\". At the Super Dave Osborne Racing Facility, Fuji explains his new computer system for cars that tells exactly what needs fixing when you pull into a service station. Super Dave attempts to use this system to set a new record for a pit crew stop time on the race track, using the Super Dave Race Car.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"No oil, no gas, no tires. And that's about it. Oh, no brakes. Brakes are important, kids.\" He crashes into a wall.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, I'm perfect, putz.\"\n\nThe Last Word: A very unpleasant thing he would like someone to do to Fuji with the steering wheel.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave hydra-hulled speedboat, then later the red Super Dave ATV.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Bright pink corduroy jacket, white shirt, dark red tie with white and black stripes, dark red hanky, white pants. Later: Bright red jacket, red, white and black striped tie, white shirt, white hanky, white pants.\n\nSteven Kolodny shows his first Super Dave compilation video. Super Dave and the Super Dave Band attempt to play \"Stump the Band\" with the audience, where audience members name a song, and if the band can't play it, they get a free dinner. KD Lang sings \"Rock Stock and Teardrops\". Super Dave has had Jim and Tammy Bakker's old house flown into the compound, which Super will attempt a stunt with. In an attempt to purge his soul, he will set fire to the house and ride his Super Dave Atomic Bike through it.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Jim and Tammy, here I come! Woo-hoo! Torch the living room, and Tammy's bathrobe! Oh it's hot! It's too hot! I'm on fire!\" Super Dave comes out the other side, and when the fire is put out, his appearance has changed dramatically.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Yes, Mike, I'm all right, and I feel like I've had a big weight off my shoulders now, and when I wake up in the morning and look at myself in the mirror, I'm not going to look like a fool anymore.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"I don't know why, but I have this sudden urge to shop.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white ATV.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and bright green floral pattern jacket, green tie and hanky, white shirt, bright beige pants.\n\nSuper Dave opens the show introducing the \"Super Dave Wheel of Good Fortune\" contest, where chosen contestant Rusty Lightbody will take part. Super talks to Herb Normis and Louise Duart, who claim they can channel people. Liberty Silver sings \"Let It Begin Tonight\". Super then returns to the contest, where he will be strapped to the wheel as it spins, and Gary, the head of the Super Dave Archery School, will shoot arrows at him. When an arrow hits any of the prizes on the wheel, be it $500, a Mike Walden Wardrobe, or lunch with Fuji, Rusty will win that prize.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Gary isn't such a good archer after all. Super gets nailed with arrows three times. However, the judges decide to give Rusty a cheque for $1500 anyway, which Super vainly tries to grab back.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"No, I'm not all right this time! I'm dying! There's three arrows in me, okay?\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"Why am I saying Good Night Everybody? I've got three arrows in me and I'm spinning!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave blue helicopter.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, white shirt, white hanky, red white and black striped tie, white pants.\n\nSuper Dave welcomes Tony Cox, head of the network, who is up in the box. He then holds the Super Dave Recollection Contest, where audience members watch a clip of one of Super's stunts, and win prizes for remembering a specific detail about the clip. Two of the clips feature the Super Dave Stunt School from BIZARRE. After the contest, Tony berates Super Dave for how he presents his show, much to Super's annoyance. Bobby McFerrin sings \"All I Want\". Super and Fuji present their new \"Presidential Safety Vehicle\" that allows the President of the United States to present himself in a parade. The vehicle features a seat enclosed in safety glass which is height adjustable, and the \"Goodwill Hand of Peace\" which is a giant hand that waves at the crowds.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I'm gonna move up about six inches, almost to the top of the glass. You'll see this.\" Fuji raises the seat much too high, and Super smashes through the enclosed glass ceiling. \"Could you lower me down a bit, if it's not too much trouble?\" Fuji then lowers the chair much too low, and Super goes right through the floor. \"Fuji, can you give me a hand?\" (click) \"Wrong button.\" The giant hand then falls on him.\n\nThe Last Word: A request to tell anyone who sees Fuji to *bleep* off.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave Motorbike.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, navy blue tie with bright yellow stripes, white shirt, white hanky, black pants.\n\nSuper Dave is at the Osborne Memorial Hospital due to an awful accident. He was rehearsing the show introduction with the girls' softball team at the Super Dave Memorial Sports Arena, where a powerful magnet caused a bus to run into him. Back at the studio, Veronique Belliveau sings \"Make a Move on Me\". The doctor is wheeling Super in for an operation to remove the fragments of magnet from his body. Glen Campbell sings \"Light Years\" and \"Gentle on My Mind\". The operation was a success, despite the fact that the doctor's surgical instruments kept getting stuck to Super.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: They weren't able to remove the magnet completely. A water fountain and a cart nail him as he tries to leave the hospital.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Oh, that was right in the spinal cord! Oh, that hurt!\"\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white and black striped tie, white shirt, white hanky, white pants with black and red check pattern.\n\nIt's the annual holiday show! Super shows off his Super Dave Walk of Fame and presents Mike Walden with his very own star. Liona Boyd plays \"Parranda\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". Super Dave introduces Bob Speca, a student of his who shows off his big domino layout. Fuji helps Super prepare his \"Christmas Human Cannonball\" stunt, where he will be shot out of a cannon, do a triple flip, land in a chimney, come out of the fireplace, and deliver presents to children.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Merry... too far! Oh!\" He gets fired too far, but then he ends up in a net, and assures the audience he's okay. Then he tries to jump off the net and ends up falling flat on his face.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Normally, I'd go to the hospital right now, but I've got some important presents to deliver. Happy holidays, everyone!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave \"Sleigh Jeep\".\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white and black striped tie, white hanky, white shirt, white pants. Later: Green jacket, dark red and pale green striped tie, red hanky, white shirt, red pants.\n\nSuper Dave talks with Larry King who has accused him of having plastic surgery merely to improve his looks, and Super tries to prove he only gets it for health reasons by showing tapes of his various stunts. Colin James performs \"Voodoo Thing\". Super shows off the plans of his new \"Super Dave Kid Land\" which includes Fuji's new invention, the \"Coaster Carousel\", a variable speed merry go round which can go slow to super fast and prevents falling off caused by sudden stopping.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: The carousel goes faster and faster, stops with apparently no harm done. But due to a flaw in Fuji's design, the momentum is really built up, and Super flies out the window a few seconds after.\n\nThe Last Word: \"I'm going to Disneyland! I'm going to stop off at the hospital first and get a wooden horseshoe taken out of my *quack*, but I'm going!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red, white and blue ATV.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pale pink corduroy jacket, white shirt, dark red tie and hanky, white pants, white shoes.\n\nSuper Dave talks to two women who have had cosmetic surgery done, albeit to a bit of an extreme. The Razorbacks perform \"It's Saturday Night\". At the new Super Dave Swim Stadium, the Super Dave diving team performs some spectacular dives. Fuji helps Super attempt to perform a quadruple flip from a 40 foot tower into an 8 foot tank.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, I'm going to start out with a full wing span... and... the pool is empty!\" Super Dave goes Splat. Fuji then attempts to rectify this mistake and turns on the water. A huge geyser erupts and throws Super into the air, and he plummets to the ground again.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, putz, I'm perfect.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"If my doctor is watching, i just want to say that this week I broke my back, last week I broke my neck, the week before I broke my knees. Stop bugging me about my cholesterol!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave six-wheeled \"Subterannean Vehicle\".\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Bright yellow jacket, red tie and hanky, white shirt, dark blue and white plaid pants, black shoes.\n\nSuper and Donald open the new mime area on the compound, where several students are shown and Super Dave's prize mime performs his \"Bubblegum City\" act. Dan and Paula Hankins are scheduled to perform a duet singing \"Touch Me in the Morning\" by Diana Ross, but the couple unfortunately broke up and Dan comes up with the solution of performing the duet all by himself in becoming a man and woman combination. Fuji assists Super with performing the \"Nunji\" stunt, which is essentially Super blindfolding himself and driving a race car, and Fuji will give him a surprise at some point.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I wonder what my third Nunji is?\" The \"surprise\" turns out to be a crane picking up the car and putting it into a crusher.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah Mike, I'm fine. That was just one terrific Nunji.\"\n\nThe Last Word: A poem about his Nunji:\n\n\"This Nunji was tough, as you can plainly see,\n\nMy body is not connected, I'm footloose and fancy free,\n\nI'm held by a thread, I'm even afraid to cough,\n\nSo let me just say goodnight, and Fuji, *honk honk*.\"\n\n(\"Sorry we beeped that, it's just that my kidney accidentally hit the horn\")\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave motorboat, and then later the Super Dave motorcycle.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: White jacket, black hanky, black tie with little grey stripes, white shirt, black pants. Later: Black jacket, dark red and black striped tie, white shirt, no hanky, grey pants.\n\nSuper Dave and his lawyer Bernie Weinthal are at municipal court trying to stop an embarrassing book from being published, which claims Super treats his workers like dirt. Back at the studio, Super and the Super Dave Band play \"Name That Song\" with the audience, where they have a chance to win prizes. Fuji demonstrates his new state of the art car alarm which uses a computer to tell whether or not a specific person is trying to get in the car, and the car reacts appropriately.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: The car responds to Super trying to start the car by blowing up.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Fuji, I need help. Mike, help me. Somebody. Does anybody know I'm dying here?\"\n\nSuper Dave Band leader: \"We know that one!\" (they play \"Copacabana\")\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave motorbike.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and purple plaid jacket, red tie, white hanky, white shirt, black pants.\n\nSuper presents Steve Allen with the Super Dave Academy Hall of Fame Award for his incredible comedic skills. Steve performs his \"Letters to the editor\" sketch. KD Lang sings \"I'm Down to My Last Cigarette\". Super introduces the \"Super Dave Cycle Troupe\" who perform bicycling feats. Super prepares to perform his \"Rocket Bike Straight to Hell\" where Super will go around a loop, do a flip, and land on another ramp. In addition, Fuji will drive a truck under the ramp with a ring of fire on the roof. However, just when Super is about to get on the loop, he is distracted when a piece of the ramp falls off.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, we'll start over. Tell Fuji that we'll start with one…\" Fuji, however, has not been distracted, and drives the truck through, which mows Super down.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, putz, I'm perfect. I just wanted to get out of the sun for a minute. I'm fine, no problem.\"\n\nThe Last Word: He asks Fuji to drop him off at a graveyard so he can visit himself.\n\nArrival Vehicle: A gold hotrod.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pale yellow jacket, pale yellow tie with tiny grey circles, red hanky, white shirt, black pants.\n\nSuper Dave announces it is cameraman Ed Jackman's birthday. Super wants him to sing, but Ed wants to juggle instead. The Razorbacks sing \"Lower Beverly\". At the office of Super Dave's personal physician, Dr Sidney Karlman, Super is presented with an award from the International Medical Association for the Daredevil Athlete Entertainer of the Decade. Super is so touched he gives special hugs to both Mike and Dr Karlman (he doesn't throw the award away either). We are treated to a replay of the \"Balloon Ball\" stunt from BIZARRE.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: The doctor informs Super that he will be receiving another award shortly for the \"Man who has had the most X-rays on the planet\". As a result of all those x-rays, Super's arm falls off.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Jack, if you can hear me in the booth, take a shot of the wastebasket. I'm waving goodnight.\"\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Sky blue jacket, red tie with white stripes, red hanky, white shirt, black pants.\n\nSuper Dave has been accused by \"Business Week\" of selling himself out. Super attempts to dispel this by showing how fair the prices are on all his merchandise, and how he is willing to set a limit. Ronn Lucas shows how to make a puppet with old socks, creating a lady puppet and a turtle. Super Dave gets strapped into a chair and attempts to hold on to the back of the Super Dave pickup truck for 30 seconds while Fuji tries to drive it away. However, he only manages to hold on for 29 seconds and calls it quits.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Wait a minute! Untie my hands first!\" Mike gives the signal for Fuji to drive off. Super's arms get stretched out very long, then an ambulance runs over them when it arrives.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh, sure putz! I'm perfect! Why don't you stretch my tongue out? I could be a tripod!\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"Please don't feel sorry for me because I have 17 foot long arms. At least now I can finally hug Oprah Winfrey.\" (\"Don't get upset, Oprah. I know you lost all that weight, but like all the rest of us you'll eventually put it back on. So have some cookies and milk and enjoy the joke.\")\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white jeep, then later the Super Dave mini mobile.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow and purple plaid jacket, red tie, red hanky, white shirt, black pants. Later: Pale yellow jacket, red tie and hanky, white shirt, dark blue and white plaid pants.\n\nAt the Super Dave Confidence Training Area, Donald explains how they prevent people escaping from the chambers. Robert Gruenberg juggles three burning chainsaws in a circle of fire. Jakob Armen is supposed to do a drum solo, but he is too scared to come out of his dressing room so little Jakob Armen Jr performs a solo in his place. At the Super Dave Film Stunt Area, Donald shows how a scene of a car being riddled with bullets works, by simply cutting the shot to a dummy car with a dummy Super Dave as the driver. The shooting is triggered by saying a secret word.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"You know what? You were close.

Donald attempts to prove them wrong by showing a tape of four overweight women from 2 months ago, then bringing the women out now after they lost all that weight. Super Dave has also been accused by \"Time\" magazine of keeping a three million dollar satellite dish for himself rather than using it for the show. He attempts to denounce this by having the Smothers Brothers all the way from Los Angeles on the monitor. They sing \"Boil Them Cabbage Down\" and get messed up when Tom misses his cue. At the Super Dave Tarmac, Fuji helps Super perform the \"Chair Ski Ride to Death\" stunt, where Super will sit on a chair with skis, and a rocket powered truck will pull him and make him go up a kick ramp and jump a bus.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Ready, get set, go! Oh my lord…\" Fuji accidentally puts the truck in reverse and backs over him.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave!

Perhaps you could first untie my hands!\" (he gets dragged off)\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave motorbike and sidecar.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pale yellow tie with tiny black circles, blue shirt, white pants, and accidentally Fuji's cardigan, which he swaps for a red, purple and black plaid jacket with no hanky.\n\nSuper introduces Roy Firestone from ESPN, who does impressions of celebrities singing the national anthem (with a huge portrait of himself in the background).

Super plans to do his \"90-90 ride to death\", where he will speed up on his sled, and a helicopter will fly toward him and hook onto his helmet with a chain and carry him off. The problem is, they need the weather report from Fuji first.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: He gets run over by a train.

The Super Dave Band is also present to play the national anthem as motivation. The new training program involves studying videos of your opponent, using a computer to find which fighter you are most like, and sparring with a boxing robot.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"It's not going to work!\" The robot punches him so hard, he goes flying out the window.\n\nThe Last Word: \"We have a rule at the compound that if you're knocked down, you have to take a mandatory eight count, even if you're not hurt.

Fuji and Robbie help Super perform the \"Atomic Yo-Yo Through Life\" stunt, where Super gets into a giant Yo-yo and a giant hydraulic hand will raise it up and down.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Wait a minute, gentlemen... I'm in the yoyo here!\" Before they can attach the rope, one of his crew accidentally bumps the Yo-Yo and he goes rolling down the hill and down the cliff.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Well, I guess it could have been worse.

Super shows off the new billiard pool area and introduces his prize student Gene Catron, who has made a setup of dominoes, cues, triangles, and billiard balls. Fuji helps Super perform the \"Atomic Jack in the Box\" stunt, where Super will get into a giant Jack in the Box, \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" will play, and Super will be shot up to the top of a giant Christmas tree and sing a holiday song.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: The lid fails to open when Super pops up, and as a result he becomes the Head on Shoes, which his crew then kicks to the top of the tree.

Super and Donald give a tour of their \"Noise Pollution House\", whose ambience and interior decoration allows the tenant to just ignore the various noises from outdoors when their house is in a noisy area, by playing soothing sounds and having relaxing pictures. They demonstrate the house being in a freeway area, near an airport, near a police station, and near a train track.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Get a train sound. I gotta do it. Quickly, because I got a stunt to do! Any kind of train sound! Make woo-woo with your mouth!\" Donald has a train drive through the house.\n\nThe Last Word: (He's too far away)\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white ATV.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, red, white and grey striped tie, white shirt and hanky, white pants and shoes.\n\nSuper Dave introduces \"Sweeps week\", and the network is trying to boost ratings by having Super talk to attractive women in the audience.

Super and Fuji give a tour of the new \"Storybookland\" area of the compound, where families can come visit and re-enact their favourite children's stories. Super and Fuji re-enact the Three Little Pigs, where Super plays the pig and Fuji plays the big bad wolf.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Well, you took care of the stick house and the straw house, how are you going to blow down my brick house? Huh?\" The big bad wolf can't blow down the house of bricks, so he blows it up instead. With dynamite.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Well, that's my show. I hope you enjoyed it. I know I had a blast.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The hippo-boat.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Green jacket, pale yellow tie with little black circles, white shirt and hanky, pale yellow pyjama pants with black and white race cars.\n\nAt the Super Dave Confidence Building Area, Super and Donald introduce Jose the Gardener, who sings a lively tune and plays the guitar.

A young man named James tells a golf joke before sending it to Mike Walden. Super and Fuji show off the new Super Dave Water Park, where Super tries out the world's highest tube water slide, called \"Ride the Wild Goose\", while blindfolded to make it more exciting.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, I think I should be coming out now! I'm coming to the bottom! Here I come!\" The slide ends at the top of a cliff, and he plummets down to the beach. The ambulance then fails to secure him in the back as they drive off, and he falls out and gets dragged by a rope.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Guys, could you at least turn me over? I'd like to get an even tan.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave hovercraft, then later the Propane Copter Vehicle.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, pale yellow tie with little black circles, white shirt and hanky, white pants.

They round off the party by showing Steve Kolodny's latest compilation video.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I just wish Fuji had been able to share this moment with us and see this cake.\" In an effort to make the restaurant more authentic, Fuji drives a Studebaker through the wall, and it runs right over him.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Let's just try to enjoy the last few minutes of my birthday. Actually, more like the last few minutes of my life.\"\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Blue jacket, blue and white striped tie, white pants and hanky, white shoes\n\nSuper and Donald give a tour of the new lumberjack area, showing the axe throwing range, the two man log sawing competition, the woodchopping area, the chainsaw sculpting area, the log rolling pool, the log cabin area, and finally the log climbing area. Super is going to climb a forty foot log, sit in a chair at the top, and ring a bell. In the studio, Kim Carnes sings \"Just to Spend Tonight with You\". Super's climb seems to be going well. Doug and the Slugs sing \"Love Shines\". Super finally reaches the top, and reveals the log is also a ride called \"Timber\" where the log will rise up, then fall over into a bag.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Ready, timber into the bag! Here we go... wrong way! Stop! No!\" The tree falls into a log cabin.\n\nThe Last Word: Comments on how it took his staff 30 seconds to make a chair and it only took 10 for him to make a coffin.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red jeep.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, white shirt and hanky, red, white, sky blue and black striped tie, white pants, black shoes\n\nSuper introduces John Petterson, the winner of the Super Dave Touchdown for Dollars contest.

Super, Fuji, and John Petterson round off the show with the touchdown to dollars, where Super will sit in a giant football, and a giant hydraulic arm will throw it towards a target for a chance to win prizes.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Instead of throwing it through the air, the arm spikes the ball into the ground.

Super drives the \"Super Dave Cola Car\", which is a motorized vending machine, around the compound while the Super Dave Cola Jingle plays!\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Hi everyone! How are you doing? Goodbye…\" Fuji accidentally runs over him with the cola truck while trying to find his way out of the compound. Fuji then backs over him to ask Mike for further directions, and drags him off.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave!

Dan Hill sings \"Sometimes When We Touch\". Super and Fuji give a tour of the new Remote Control Models area, demonstrating boats, cars, and planes. Fuji is flying a remote control Cessna plane, but the sound distracts Super so he asks Fuji to turn it off.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Gee, what a great way to spend a day.\" Unluckily, the plane Fuji is flying turns out to be an actual plane, which falls right on top of him.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Just read my eulogy, putz. I'm a dead man.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"I'd be crying right now, like most athletes do when they end their career, but I can't. My tear ducts are underneath my shoes.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white motorbike.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, pink, purple and grey swirl pattern tie, white shirt and hanky, white pants.\n\nSuper brings up motivational speaker Mitchell Zeidwig, who claims you can do anything if you just put your mind to it and say \"I Can Do It\".

The Razorbacks sing \"My Way or Highway\". Super and Fuji show off the new Super Dave Golf Course, where Super Dave shows his own special swing.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Fuje, let me ask you one question. I've got water over here, I've got sand over here. That's kind of difficult, but I'm here in one and I'm shooting for a double eagle. What makes this hole so difficult?\" A tree falls on him.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, I'm perfect. Does movement indicate if I'm all right? Well, I'm not moving, putz. I need help.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"Maybe someone could call the city dump and fill in my divot.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave helmet shaped golf kart.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pale yellow jacket, multicoloured horizontal striped tie, white shirt, black hanky, black pants and shoes.\n\nSuper is at the hospital because of a mishap while he and Donald were giving a tour of the new comedy park area. Super tried out the Comedy Ride and went through the Surprise Tunnel. The surprise turned out to be the car blowing up and Super getting hosed in the face. Back in the studio, Kelita sings \"The Strong One\". Super is visited in the hospital by Rummy Bishop, who Donald believes is Super's favourite comic. Jerry Reed sings \"Guitar Man\". It seems Super is going to be okay, but they decide to send him for more x-rays just to be sure.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Careful guys! All right, and... no floor.\" The orderlies accidentally wheel him into an empty elevator shaft.\n\nThe Last Word: (He's down the shaft.

But the control doesn't work, and Super frustratingly gets out of the water.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Fuji then realizes he forgot to switch the control on, and he activates it. Super is blown away in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Last Word: \"With the little time we have left, I'd like to ask for three favours. One, someone check to see if my insurance is paid up. Two, please include me in your prayers tonight. Three, I could use some help in turning over. I think this side is done.\"\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, multicoloured horizontal striped tie, white shirt and hanky, white pyjama pants with black check, black shoes.\n\nSuper holds his fan appreciation contest, where audience members have to try to make a free throw for a chance to win a thousand dollars.

Donald shows his work on the stairs, his new roof garden patio, and the newly renovated study and master bedroom, and finishes by showing off the extensively redone bathroom, featuring a bathtub made into a jacuzzi and a sauna bath.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"You know something, one thing I forgot to ask you, what did we do structurally to reinforce the bathroom?\" They didn't do anything to reinforce the bathroom floor. The bathtub comes crashing through the ceiling on top of him and sends him right to the basement.\n\nThe Last Word: \"I've heard of a quick way to add on a second bath, but this is ridiculous.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red quad.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, pink, grey and blue striped tie, white shirt, white pants, white hanky and shoes.\n\nSuper holds a contest where audience members try to do impressions.

Super does a commercial for Garbane and fills his car to try it for the first time.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"So when you think about it, I don't know any real reason why you shouldn't be using Garbane. Do you?\" He starts the car, and it and the nearby station go up in a colossal explosion.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Of course putz, I'm perfect. Why shouldn't I be? The only thing that happened is I went through the driver's seat into the trunk like a blazing torpedo. I'm fine. I've never felt better.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"If only I were Bill Cosby, I could live off my reruns.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white four door.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Green jacket, grey and black paisley pattern tie, white shirt and pants, white hanky.\n\nSuper once again brings up motivational speaker Mitchell Zeidwig to prove you can accomplish anything just by saying \"I Can Do It\".

I can sell myself as bait.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The miniature train ride.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, pink, grey and purple swirl pattern tie, white shirt and hanky, white pants.\n\nAt the Super Dave animal area, Super explains how the Wall Street Journal accused him of spending money on himself rather than his petting zoo. He and Donald give a tour and finish at Simba the elephant's enclosure where Simba gets tested for Steroids. Back in the studio, the crew have taken a random man and woman from the audience and given them extensive makeovers. One of them then does an impression of Dionne Warwick singing \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\". Super and Fuji show off the new mobile lifting for health truck, which will bring weight lifting equipment to people. Super demonstrates the bench press by getting Fuji to bring the weights down from the truck, which Fuji does with great difficulty.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Now, while you're waiting for more weight, it's a good idea to shut your eyes and dream about the weight you'll be lifting.\" Fuji comes up with the brilliant idea to get the weights out of the truck faster by tilting the box up. The whole shebang falls on him.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah putz, I'm perfect.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"I've heard of having the weight of the world on your shoulders but this is ridiculous.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white quad, then later the Super dave red jeep.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white and light blue striped tie, white shirt and hanky, white pants.

In the room with a big wall of monitors, Super shows videos of some of his past stunts. Super explains how the building used to be the recreation area, and the monitor room used to be ping pong tables. Hearing this, Fuji excitedly wants to play ping pong.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I don't really think we have the time, Fuje.\" The monitor array falls from the wall on him, turning into a ping pong table. Fuji and Mike happily play a game.\n\nThe Last Word: Mike asks him if he wants to play, he replies not now because of a headache.\n\nArrival Vehicle: A very tiny red car.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow jacket, white shirt and hanky, white pants, white and blue striped tie, white shoes.\n\nSpecial Guest Star: Roy Firestone from ESPN.\n\nSuper once again brings up his cable puller William Tyler, who performs with his dummy, Lester, ending with a lively country tune. Colin James sings \"Five Long Years\" from his self-titled début album. At the Super Dave Car Safety and Heavy Equipment Area, Mike confides in us that he and Fuji will be playing a prank on Super later on, because Super loves blooper shows but he's never been in one. Super gives a tour of the area, showing various heavy vehicles, and the simulator which shows what happens when you don't wear your seatbelt, another simulator to test reaction time, and a device which wakes you up if you doze off driving.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I don't see anything…\" The special blooper turns out to be Fuji smashing a heavy digger shovel on the reflex test car while Super is in it.\n\nThe Last Word: He calls 911 and says it feels like \"Raymond Burr is sitting on my shoulders trying to see the Rose parade\".\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red and white quad.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow jacket, red tie and hanky, white shirt, white pants, black shoes\n\nWilliam Tyler and Lester's Song:\n\nChecked into this room just a while ago\n\nCalled a lady friend that I know\n\nSaid I'll ring you right back but she was busy just then\n\nStaying awake, a sick old man\n\nWell, I'm sitting in a motel in Morgan city\n\nLooking at a crooked picture on the wall\n\nThe TV don't work, I got a headache\n\nAnd the woman that I'm waiting for\n\nShe didn't call at all\n\nThought I would go out somewhere, to get a bite to drink\n\nHitting the booze, trying not to think\n\nI met a wheeling waitress at a roadside bar\n\nShe said she'd meet me at my place, it wasn't very far\n\nWell, I'm sitting in a motel in Morgan city\n\nLooking at a crooked picture on the wall\n\nThe TV don't work, I got a headache\n\nAnd the woman that I'm waiting for\n\nShe didn't call at all\n\nI went back to my room, I laid on my bed\n\nLean back so I can rest my head\n\nThen the telephone rang cool as a cucumber\n\nI picked it up, it was a wrong number\n\nWell, I'm sitting in a motel in Morgan city\n\nLooking at a crooked picture on the wall\n\nThe TV don't work, I got a headache\n\nAnd the woman that I'm waiting for\n\nShe didn't call at all\n\nIt's once again time for the best of Super Dave! Audience members name what they want to see. We see Super Dave's electrician Carl Hodges doing his impressions, Super and Fuji playing Three Little Pigs at Storybookland, and finally Evander Holyfield at the Super Dave Boxing Area. Finally, Tony Cox, the president of the network, requests to see the Drive to End Highway Profanity. Super explains that it will be the last show, but Tony Cox insists the show go on, even going as far as to consider offering Super a new contract, which Super automatically assumes means he will be getting three more years. Tony Cox bows to pressure from the audience and renews Super's contract.\n\nThe Super One (doesn't) get hurt: But Tony Cox's pride sure does.\n\nThe Last Word: Replay of \"King of the Road\".\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: (Mike is only seen in Flashbacks.)\n\nOn the shores of Lake Osborne, Super explains how Ted Koppel has accused him of signing a major tennis shoe deal and exploiting it.

Super and Fuji show off the special house they built for Ray Charles, and decide to play a little trick on him by rearranging the furniture from one room to another. Super gets in the bed and plans to surprise Ray!\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"One thing, Fuji. What did the spare room used to be before we made it a bedroom? The garage?\" Ray Charles drives a car in and flattens the bed.\n\nThe Last Word: \"I now know who Ray's talking about when he sings 'Born to Lose'.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave \"Amphi-Vehicle\" car boat.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white and light blue tie, white shirt and hanky, black check white pyjama pants. Later: Blue jacket, white, black, red and blue striped tie, white shirt and hanky, white pants and shoes\n\nIt's the holiday show! At Super's Souvenir village, Super and Donald show off the area with an anti-pollution theme, and there are many decorations sold at the gift shop made from trash items. They also show the picture area where kids can have their picture taken with Santa. Kids can also take a special ride up the chimney, which Super tries out with disastrous results. Back in the studio, Super has been given $3000 to give to three lucky people in the audience, and he draws three random seat numbers. Loreena McKennitt sings and plays \"Greensleeves\" on the harp, which also ends in an unfortunate mishap. Back at the souvenir village, Fuji helps Super try out the \"Super Dave's Recycled Raft Ride\", which is a white water raft ride with a \"surprise ending\".\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"This is going to be fun, I'm not supposed to look.\" The \"surprise\" turns out to be a crane picking up the raft and putting it in a car crusher.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Oh, look at this. I found my lips. Now if I could just find my cheek. Let's see, it's not under my knee. No, not under the elbow. Oh, here it is! I've got my lips in my cheek! Now if I just had some mistletoe, I could kiss my life goodbye.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white Motorbike with a really cramped sidecar, then later the \"Super Dave Holiday Shoe Surprise Car\".\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Green jacket, red tie and hanky, white shirt and pants, white shoes.

Michel Lauziere once again tries to do an act on the show, performing musical tricks. Super and Fuji open the new Super Dave Fast Food restaurant, which Super claims will serve healthy food made and served by graduates of the Super Dave food university. Super introduces the chef, who like the previous chef is an aspiring singer. They end the tour by showing how they strive to get an order done in the shortest time by having Fuji order at the drive thru.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"And now, Mr Hakayito, you can drive through and get your order with ten seconds to spare!\" Fuji drives right through the restaurant wall and mows him down. He then gets dragged off by the van because Fuji fails to realize he's underneath.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Just take me to a drive through hospital. I could use a new McHeart. And a couple of McLungs. Maybe even a McSpleen!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave box van.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Green jacket, white, black and green striped tie, white hanky, pale blue plaid pyjama pants.\n\nDanny Menendez, one of the show's electricians, opens the show by juggling. Michelle Wright sings \"New Kind of Love\". Super and Fuji revisit Storybookland, where there have been new areas added, and they reenact \"Little Red Riding Hood\", with Super as Red and Fuji as the wolf. The story is supposed to end with Red getting rid of the wolf while he is in grandma's house by triggering the Murphy bed.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I knew this wouldn't work.\" Fuji reveals there is no murphy bed, but rather a \"murphy chair\", which Super activates and gets slammed into the wall. He then gets it again with a \"murphy rug\". Resigned to his fate, he lies on the bed and tells Fuji to just finish him off. Fuji activates the \"murphy wall\", which crushes him.\n\nThe Last Word: Calling for help using his duck whistle.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave swan boat.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pale yellow jacket, navy blue and white plaid pants, red hanky, red tie, yellow shoes.\n\nAt the Super Dave Equestrian Academy, Super and Donald give a tour of the stables, showing Super's favourite horse Darla, the horse washing area, and the saddle room. Bernie Weinthal is seen riding a very small mule, and Jean Paul Peret the famous rider performs some dressage exercises, then Super tries out some exercises himself. Sue Medley sings \"Dangerous Times\". Audience member Dave Ellis tells a parachuting joke before sending it to Mike Walden. At the new Super Dave Bungee School, Fuji explains how they improve discipline and concentration in students by using the mantra \"Blue skies, clean air, and the weight is perfect!\", and throwing down a dummy weight first. One of Super's prize students, Austin, performs a jump. Super then gets ready to do his own jump.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Blue skies, clean air, the weight is tied to your waist!\" \"You're shitting me!\" Fuji throws Super's dummy weight off, not realizing that the weight is tied to Super. After the fall, Super then calls for an ambulance, and Fuji decides to bungee one down, right on top of Super.\n\nThe Last Word: He remarks about how colourful heaven is, then realizes he's actually in Mike's hamper.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave mini quad.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pale yellow jacket, navy blue and white plaid pants, red hanky and tie, black shoes.

However, the Super Dave Band shows up instead. (The Super Dave Band also causes a surprise when they know a SECOND song.) At the new Super Dave international raceway, Super tries to break his own record doing a lap around the track in the Super Racer. Fuji has improved the track to make it more challenging by hiding land mines on it, which the Super One accidentally hits. Back in the studio, Laura Branigan sings \"Never in a Million Years\". Super appears to be okay, but he still needs to go to the hospital for testing, so he gets put in an ambulance.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"You know, there are still land mines on this track!\" While the paramedics are talking to Mike, the ambulance rolls away and hits another land mine.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Ball game!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red moped.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow jacket, blue and white striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants\n\nCrystal Gayle sings \"Never Ending Song of Love\", while Super joins in playing the accordion. Fuji and Super give a tour of the new miniature golf course, where every hole features a TV screen with a tape of one of Super's stunts. At the 18th hole, the golfer will get into a big plastic ball, and a giant Super Dave statue will hit them down a special course that looks like a pinball machine towards the hole for a chance to win a million dollars. Super gives it a shot.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Here comes a hole in one, I'm ready to roll!\" The statue hits the ball way too hard, and he goes careening through a billboard.\n\nThe Last Word: A joke about a golf ball that can't be lost.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, pink, white, grey and black striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants.\n\nSuper is upset because the Wall Street Journal has accused him of wrongfully spending money that should be spent on making new areas on the compound for children. Super denounces this by showing the \"Old Lady Who Lived in a High Tech Shoe\" area. Michel Lauziere once again tries to be on the show by performing stunts using giant balloons. En Vogue sings \"Lies\". Super and Donald show their new \"Geiger Car\", which can scan for anything underground and feed it to a computer bank nearby. Super tries it out by driving around the test area while Donald sits at the console, and it works when Super finds something metallic in the ground.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Train tracks? Double check that. I'm going to back up.\" A train comes along and smashes into the car.\n\nThe Last Word: He comments about seeing a strange smoking red object under the train.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red jeep.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Bright blue jacket, red and white striped tie, red hanky, white shirt, white pants. Later: Red and purple plaid jacket, red tie, white hanky, white shirt and pants.\n\nSuper and Bernie are disgusted that the network wants to boost ratings by having scantily clad women on the show. He has some women give their outfits to him so he can show how revealing they are, and rounds it off by having the girls do a dance. Clarence Clemons performs \"Garden of Memories\". Super and Fuji give a tour of the new Super Dave's Safety Mart, which has advanced security features to deter shoplifters. As an added precaution, the till area has an air jet gun disguised as a pen.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Let me tell you the beauty of this whole thing. You're looking at a five inch pen that just delivered four tons of atomic air pressure! Normally, when an instrument like this delivers one ton of air pressure, the kickback is like an elephant! But Fuji completely eliminated the kickback! How did you eliminate it, Fuje?\" Fuji explains that the kickback is delayed. Super flies through the back wall.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Hey, I got a stamp on my hand. From one of the milk cartons. It says I go bad in 3 seconds.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: A white SUV.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, pink, white, grey and black striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants. Later: Pale yellow jacket, pink, white and blue plaid pajama pants, red hanky, white shirt, rainbow striped tie.\n\nSuper is at the hospital yet again. It's the ten year anniversary of the opening of the compound, and Donald was helping him rehearse his big number at the opening where he flies around on wires lip-synching to \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" by Bette Midler. A miscalculation occurred and he crashed right through the bulb wall. Randy Travis sings \"Singing the Blues\". Super is incredibly depressed that he is in the hospital during this special evening, and Donald, disgusted that the orderlies just left Super in the hall, finds a nice small room to put him in. The Northern Pikes sing \"Kiss Me You Fool\". Super is still determined to do the show for his fans, so he has Donald take him back to the studio on his stretcher against the doctor's orders. On his return, the audience gives him a standing ovation. The bulb wall has even been replaced, and the billboard says \"We Love You Super\".\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"I'm dead!\" Due to a maintenance error, the new bulb wall only has one speed: Super Fast. It slams down and crushes him.\n\nThe Last Word: \"If I'd known this was going to happen, I would have continued to eat meat.\"\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Blue jacket, white and blue striped tie, white hanky and pants.\n\nAt the new Super Dave Driving School, Donald and Super reveal their plans for a Senior Citizen Driver Training Program, which has been criticized by Newsweek. Super denounces the claims by having his prize student, Bill, drive the training car. Mitchell Zeidwig performs on the piano with a string quartet, and Super has him play the piano while hanging from a chandelier to earn $1000 for the \"I Can Do It\" foundation. Super and Fuji show off the new \"Yacht Car\", which is an RV and a Yacht together that can go on water and on land. Super proudly drives it to the boat ramp while \"Beyond the Sea\" by Bobby Darin plays.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"You know what? I just realized something. I didn't turn onto the Pillman boat ramp, I turned onto the Pillman pier instead! I forgot, everyone! I'm going to turn around! Look out! Uh oh…\" He goes through the railing, and into the soup!\n\nThe Last Word: \"Look at this. I'm on the bottom of the ocean, sitting upside down in a car boat, surrounded by electrical equipment. I could have been shocked.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white quad, then later the Super Dave 1920s car.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Blue jacket, white and blue striped tie, white hanky and shirt and pants.

Super and Donald visit the recently opened Senior Citizens' Boxing Club, where Super introduces George Foreman as the trainer. Super shows off his prize students who are better, stronger, and faster thanks to George's training program. Super and George each coach a senior contender to box, and they have a senior citizens' boxing match.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"They wear a protective cup.\" George demonstrates the importance of an athletic cup by nailing Super in the crotch. Amazingly, he survives. He then calmly asks Donald to drive him in his limo to the Pet Cemetery, where he walks up to an open grave and falls in it.\n\nThe Last Word: He composes his own eulogy, then despairs about how he doesn't have a will.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, pink, white, grey and navy striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants.\n\nSuper and Donald show off Super's new aviary, along with birdwatcher Gerry Bennett. They take a look at several species while Super is the unfortunate target of bird activity. Ray Charles sings \"Born to Lose\". At the new Super Dave's Parade Village, Super, Mike, Fuji, Donald, and Bernie show an entirely computerized parade. Donald designed the floats, Fuji remotely operates them, Bernie handles the legal problems, and Super uses it to promote his new lip-synching album. The parade gets going while the five of them ride the last float and lip synch to the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\", with Super leading from the top of the float. Unfortunately, their float breaks down at a crossroads.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Well, fix this float. Or we might have an accident!\" The rest of the floats work fine, and the parade crashes through the float and mows him down, while the rest of the gang sings on.\n\nThe Last Word: (He's too far away.)\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave black jeep.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red and purple plaid jacket, red tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants. Later: Red jacket, red, pink, white and grey striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants.\n\nSuper is celebrating \"Elvis week\", and decides to hold an Elvis Recollection Contest, where the Super Dave Band will play an Elvis song, and audience members guess the song title.

He begins by showing off his boat, the SS Super, with its special engine which he hopes to get up to 330 miles per hour with. Back in the studio, Michelle Wright sings \"Wide Open\". Super manages to break the record, but something goes wrong with the engine so he takes it back to the docks. Glen Campbell sings \"Rhinestone Cowboy\". The engine is unfortunately shot, and Super is disappointed that he wasn't able to break the record by more.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Rafael, tell me when the boat's on the trailer.\" Rafael the hoist operator drops the boat on his truck, and Super is unfortunately inside.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Rafael, your green card is in my wallet.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white pickup.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Blue jacket, red, white, black and blue striped tie, red hanky, white shirt with black stripes, white pants and shoes.\n\nSuper once again challenges Mitchell Zeidwig to back up his claims by having him perform stunts while playing the piano. At the new Super Dave indoor arena, Fuji helps Super with his \"Pent-athalon of Stunts\", where he will be doing five dangerous stunts, one for each night. The present stunt is Super going up against \"Robosaurus\", a giant robot dinosaur that can breathe fire. Super will drive his red Super Dave sports car around the arena, and Fuji will operate Robosaurus, trying to catch him. Fuji demonstrates the robot's fire breathing, and he accidentally burns through the scoreboard monitor's support wire, which Super is unfortunately caught under. Back in the studio, Celine Dion sings \"Any Other Way\". The badly injured Super is put in an ambulance.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Don't do anything else!\" Fuji has the robot pick the ambulance up and chew it to bits.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Well, not a total loss. At least now you finally know who killed Laura Palmer.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white golf cart.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white, black and blue striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants.\n\nAt the Super Dave Antique Car Auction, Donald has helped Super set up the space for some of Ron Fawcett's prize automobiles.

Super and Jim Roswold show a couple of commercials for Nike featuring Super Dave. Super also awards Jim with a Super Dave Hall of Fame plaque. Super and Fuji give a tour of the new Super Dave Museum of Modern Art, showing off several pieces ending with the \"Piano Vault\", which is a player piano with a secret safe hidden somewhere that opens when you play a specific song.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"This is not only spectacular, but it's fun!\" The safe door is actually under the bench, which Super is sitting on.

Donald and Super hold a class in filmmaking, where they show how chroma-works with a blue screen, by using equipment in their special trailer to do overlays. Super will do his demonstration by diving from a scaffold into a chroma-key blue bag which is overlaid with a film of water to make it look like he is diving into a pool.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"It's a Super Dave swan dive! Into the bag!... into the truck!\" He misses the bag and winds up in the trailer. Due to his injuries, his face turns a perfect chroma-key blue.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave!

Fuji and Super give a tour of the new Super Dave Safe Soccer Stadium, which has measures in place to prevent fights between players and spectators, and to ensure the referee's safety. The biggest feature is the ejection seats people can use to escape if a riot erupts. Super intends to simulate a riot by having rows of seats filled with cardboard cutout people move closer to him until he decides to eject.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Fuji brings the rows of seats together too fast, and he gets crushed between them.\n\nThe Last Word: He pleads with Fuji and Mike to get him out of the stands.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave convertible Wonder Cycle.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white, grey and black striped tie, black, white and red plaid pyjama pants, white hanky and shirt\n\nSue Medley sings \"Love Thing\".

The planes that people ride in are actually controlled by Fuji in a special control unit on the ground. Super goes up in one of the planes and flies over the whole compound, and even chases another plane simulating an air combat, and makes a perfect landing. The school also offers the \"Ultimate Flying Experience\" at the highest price. Mike wants to know what it is, and Fuji explains that it simulates the plane actually getting hit by gunfire.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"On the ground? Well, how will I know if I'm hit?\" Fuji demonstrates by blowing up the plane, with Super unfortunately still inside.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Yeah, I'm a marshmallow, putz. I need help.\"\n\nThe Last Word: A poem called \"My Last Flight\":\n\n\"I flew like the wind as never before,\n\nI soared as the eagle with clouds at my door.\n\nMy senses were singing my worries were nil,\n\nI knew if I landed I might lose the thrill.\n\nBut duty does call so down I did drop,\n\nI shed a few tears as I knew I must stop.\n\nBack on the ground blue is my mood,\n\nA messy charred mass, I'm airline food!\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white quad.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, red, white and blue striped tie, white shirt with black stripes, white hanky, white pants and shoes.\n\nDan Menendez comes back and does a juggling act, and briefly tries a ventriloquism act.

Inside the house, there is a padded floor and walls, furniture made from food in case of emergency, a Super Dave survival guide, a phone with an airbag in it, and finally a chair loaded with springs that will not move around if there's an earthquake. He demonstrates this by having Donald and the crew shake the house. Super wants to simulate a bigger earthquake, but the crew isn't strong enough.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"An 8... and now it feels like a 9 to me... I think we have a 10!\" Donald has a bulldozer push the house over a cliff.\n\nThe Last Word: He loudly berates Mike's wardrobe.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white jeep.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow, green, black and white plaid square pattern jacket, black tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nRodney McCray from the Chicago White Sox is inducted into the Super Dave Hall of Fame, and George Brett and Rocket Ismail are also present for the occasion.

Donald and Super introduce the Children's TV Hall of Fame area of the compound, and perform \"Mr. Osborne's neighbourhood\" (A spoof of Mr. Rogers' Neighbourhood) with Super as Mr. Osborne, and Donald as Mr. Conductor, learning about trains. Mr. Osborne visits \"Train Land\" and also learns not to put his hand on the miniature train tracks, while Mr. Conductor gets locked in the closet. Mr. Osborne tells us an un-child friendly story about a duck named Wilbur.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Now, what I want you to do for Mr. Osborne is I want you to shut your eyes and I want you to wish for something as hard as you can. And I'm sure it will come true for Mr. Osborne. Are you wishing?…\" Mr. Osborne certainly didn't wish for a train to crash through the house and run him down!\n\nThe Last Word: (He's too far away.

Stunt fist fights and gun fights also happen from time to time to entertain the crowd. Super has a shootout with Jimbo North, and he gets shot and flies backwards through a window. He seems to be okay, though, and he explains how the stunt worked using a cable attached to his back and pulled by a car, as well as breakaway glass and mats.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Turns out it was not breakaway glass after all. Super needs medical attention, and Fuji calls for the car to take him to the hospital. \"I'm still attached!\" He fails to realize Super is still tied to the car, and it drags him away.\n\nThe Last Word: He screams in pain as he is dragged off.\n\nArrival Vehicle: Super Dave's horse, Dynamite.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Dark green jacket, white tie with black stripes, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nSuper tries to open the show with a poem he wrote, but he is interrupted once again by Michel Lauziere trying to impress Super with various tricks.

They have a game where Super plays Kevin, and Fuji and Mike play the robbers. Super stays in the house that's filled with fun traps, and Fuji and Mike will arm themselves with toys from the truck. Every prank Super plays that successfully hits the opponent earns points, and Fuji and Mike score points the further they get in the house.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Oh, I can't believe it. They're so lazy, they're driving up!\" Fuji decides to get them in by driving the truck through the front door, and it flattens him.\n\nThe Last Word: One feeble cry for help.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave black quad.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Red jacket, white, black and yellow striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nAt the Super Dave International Raceway, Super and Fuji introduce a special race where each car is sponsored by a male celebrity, but driven by a female celebrity.

To make him feel better, Mike shows a flashback of the Super Dave cola car.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: Fuji activates the remote control which controls the bed, and the bed throws him out the window.\n\nThe Last Word: He screams as Fuji messes with the hospital bed.\n\nArrival Vehicle: A red pickup.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, deep purple tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nSuper and Donald open up the new Casino Circus, featuring games where you can win credit at the general store. One of the games is \"Stunt Wheel\", where you bet on specific stunts to come up on the wheel, and you need to answer a trivia question to win. The demonstration gives us a flashback of the \"Atomic Yo-yo\" stunt. They also demonstrate the slot machine, which gives a flashback of the \"Outdoor Lip Synching Area\". Super continues on to \"Shoot for the Stars\", where you shoot a basket to win money. The tour ends with the \"Matilda\" game where you sit on one end of a seesaw, and a 4000 pound dummy of a woman falls on the other end and you get launched up and grab a money bag. The dummy moves around, and you have to make it drop at the right moment.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"...Drop?\" The dummy lands right on Super, and he becomes the Head on Shoes. Donald shoots him in the basket and wins a million dollars.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Yeah, putz, I'm perfect. Why wouldn't I be all right? I'm a head on shoes. The tongue in my tennis shoes replaced the tongue in my mouth. I'm fine. Why don't we go bowling?\"\n\nThe Last Word: He asks Donald to buy him a tombstone with an inscription:\n\n\"Roses are red,\n\nViolets are blue,\n\nHe's the only human being\n\nto have died in his shoe.\"\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Black and grey block pattern jacket, red bow tie and cummerbund, red hanky, white shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nCeline Dion sings \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\".

First it slams him through the table top, then sends him flying through the window.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, I'm perfect, putz. I've got nearly four pounds of glass in my ear, and two rubber fists holding my kidneys.\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"You know, Mike, when I get out of here, I'm going to squeeze your sternum so hard that your tongue's going to pop out and cover that fat face of yours.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Pago Jet, making a rather undignified landing.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Yellow jacket, red tie with grey stripes, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nSuper Dave participated in a contest where you make your own commercial, and he shows a commercial he made for Bugle Boy Jeans.

He rounds off the tour with the Super Dave Haunted House Ride, which has \"Monster Mash\" by Bobby Pickett and the Crypt Kickers playing.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Okay, then I'll just go through the door and stop... no I won't!\" Turns out the ride is unfinished, and the track ends at a cliffside. He and the car plummet to the ground.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, putz, I'm perfect. I just flipped 11 times off a mountain and fell 400 feet and landed on rocks in a toy car. I've never felt better in my life. Is there anything else you can say other than \"Are you all right'?'\"\n\nThe Last Word: \"Help.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave black go-kart.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink, white and purple plaid jacket, white tie and hanky, white shirt and shoes, pale purple pants\n\nCandi and the Backbeat sing \"The World Keeps on Turning\". At the new Super Dave Ace Award Hall of Fame, Super has won his own Ace Award Ceremony after waiting so long for it. Fuji and Super give a tour of Super Dave memory lane. We see caricatures of guest stars, Super's outfits, and Super Dave memorabilia. You can even watch video clips of his stunts and check out the actual Ace Award ceremony. Super then dedicates the whole building by signing his name in wet cement in the middle of the building, which will then be sealed up.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"Oh, when are you going to do that?\" Fuji decides to seal up the wet cement by dropping flooring on it. Super happens to be under it at the time.\n\nThe Last Word: \"Oh, look at this. I just found a pair of Jimmy Hoffa's cufflinks.\"\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave camera car.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Grey and black paisley pattern jacket, red tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nSuper tries to hold a contest where viewers guess how many bulbs are in the \"SD\" shown on the billboard, but he is once again interrupted by Michel Lauziere trying to impress the audience with his tricks. On the Super Dave Super Barge SS Super, Fuji helps Super to perform his big stunt to get into the Guinness book of records, where Super will be put in a straitjacket, locked in a safe, put underwater, and will solve a Rubik's cube in two minutes. As an added precaution, explosive charges and communications have been rigged into the safe in case of emergency. Back in the studio, Clarence Clemons performs with his band.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"All right, but this better work. I'm losing air. I'm pushing it.\" Super is unable to get the straitjacket off, so he sets off the charges on the door. The door doesn't open, however. He sets off the other one, and it blows him right through the bottom of the safe. Fuji tries to help by setting off charges in his shoes, and he gets blown into the air.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, putz, I'm just perfect. I just experienced a 40 minute wash and spin cycle in two seconds. I'm a human torpedo. Do I look all right?\"\n\nThe Last Word: Hopelessly pleading for help.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white supersonic boat.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Pink jacket, blue and grey striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nAt the Super Dave Rolling Green Acres Memorial Golf Course, the 18th hole has just been finished. As Super plays the hole, Fuji then reveals what the land the final hole is on used to be. In the studio, Super brings a young man, Tony Ford, up on stage for his \"Place the Face Contest\", where he has to identify photos of celebrities, then play Jerry Lee Lewis's \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" on the piano. At the Super Dave test track, Fuji helps Super demonstrate the \"Ultimate Safety Vehicle\". A semi goes through and mows the vehicle down, and Super analyses the collision on his computer to see how much impact each part got in order to improve the safety features. He intends to send the truck through again, but he reads a glitch in the system, and orders the truck not to hit the car.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: The truck mows him down instead.\n\nThe Last Word: (He's too far away. We can't hear him.)\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave white golf cart, then later the Super Dave black pickup.\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Blue jacket, white and blue striped tie, white hanky and shirt, white pants and shoes. Later: Yellow jacket, red tie with grey stripes, red hanky, white shirt, white pants and shoes.\n\nFuji and Super open up the new \"Super Dave Autograph Pavilion\" by having Super sign autographs for little children and asking them their favourite stunt. Super then gives a heartfelt speech about not charging for autographs. Billy Vera sings \"At This Moment\". At the Super Dave Car Show of the future, Super shows off several cars powered by alternative energy sources, as well as some fancy bicycles. Fuji demonstrates his own invention, the \"Friend\", which is a car that responds to the owner's requests by tapping a secret code on the surface of the vehicle.\n\nThe Super One gets hurt: \"It's not working.\" He tries to open the hood, and the car doesn't respond. Fuji tells him to try harder, and the hood flies open and whacks him in the head. He then gets suffocated by the air bag, then nailed again by Fuji opening the trunk. Mike then accidentally slaps the car, resulting in the car starting up and driving through the wall.\n\nSuper Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?: \"Oh yeah, putz, I'm perfect. Why don't you stick your thumb in your mouth and blow hard enough to explode that fat little face of yours?\"\n\nThe Last Word: Pleading for them to get him out of the car.\n\nArrival Vehicle: The Super Dave red \"Electro Car\".\n\nMike Walden's Outfit: Blue jacket, white shirt with black stripes, white and blue striped tie, white hanky, white pants and shoes. Later: Same outfit, but with red, white and blue striped tie."
