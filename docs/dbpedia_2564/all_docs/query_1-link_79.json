        "text": "The hard right group behind the “No” campaign is amassing a multi-million dollar war chest to take down its next opponent: the Australian Greens. Advance has called the Greens the “single biggest threat to freedom, security and prosperity in Australia” – and they have big plans to target their voters ahead of the next election.\n\nToday, special correspondent for The Saturday Paper Jason Koutsoukis on who is behind Advance… and why they believe they can flip progressive women to the hard right.\n\nOnline therapy services like BetterHelp are expanding into Australia – recruiting Australian psychologists while capitalising on the failings of a mental health system that’s difficult to navigate. But are patients actually better off with subscription-based therapy apps?\n\nToday, clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Ahona Guha on the dangers of app-based mental health support and what happens when you turn psychologists into gig-economy workers.\n\nSenator Linda Reynolds is suing Brittany Higgins over a series of social media posts claiming that she was an uncaring and unsupportive boss in the wake of her allegations that she was raped in parliament house. So is taking a rape survivor to court the best way to restore your reputation?\n\nToday, Richard Ackland on Senator Linda Reynolds’ defamation case and why some politicians are so quick to sue.\n\nThree years ago, Hazara human rights activist and photographer Muzafar Ali watched as the Taliban re-took control of Afghanistan.\n\nLast month Muzafar returned to Afghanistan at great personal cost, to document what life is like there three years on from the fall of Kabul. He found a network of underground schools where girls are risking their lives to get an education.\n\nNeale Radley was in his early 40s when he dived off a houseboat and hit a sandbar, becoming a high needs quadriplegic. With no family members able to look after him, he was faced with limited options and ended up in aged care.\n\nNow, a clause in the government’s new aged care act could mean that more younger people will end up in aged care, potentially unwinding decades of work to prevent this from happening.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympics has been phenomenal for women in sport. But sporting achievements have been overshadowed by the abuse levelled at two female boxers over unfounded speculation about their sex.\n\nToday, Sam Squiers on the moral panic about ‘fairness’ in women's sport – and the long and insidious history of scrutinising the bodies of female athletes.\n\nThe fight over how to teach children to read has been called a forever war, as outdated methods linger in Australian classrooms for decades and states protect schools’ right to teach how they wish. With a third of Australian children not being able to read well, we’ve hit a turning point, with Victoria joining other states in finally mandating the best way to teach reading.\n\nToday, Martin McKenzie Murray on why “vibes-based learning” stuck around for so long and how children should actually be taught to read.\n\nIn the weeks since he was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance has been labelled by some Democrats as ‘weird’. Now the man who started the ‘weird’ line of attack, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, has been chosen as Kamala Harris’ running mate for the Democratic ticket. Walz has been described as a plain speaker with ‘dad appeal’, in stark contrast to his opponents, but is being ordinary enough to win over the average American voter?\n\nToday, Dr Emma Shortis, what the two VP nominations say about their respective parties.\n\nHardly any foreign journalists have been into Gaza since Israel’s bombings began. The Economist’s editor-in-chief Zanny Minton Beddoes is one of the few who has.\n\nOn a recent trip, Zanny visited the streets of Jerusalem, the Knesset, Gaza and the West Bank, and spoke to dozens of people about what will happen to Gaza when, or if, the fighting stops.\n\nIn the final months of her life, the Labor MP Peta Murphy was the chair of a parliamentary inquiry into the impact of gambling on Australians. After hearing from the gambling industry, dependent sporting codes and families impacted by gambling addiction, her position was unequivocal: all ads for online gambling should be banned. It’s been more than 14 months since the government received her recommendations and yet the proliferation of gambling ads has continued unabated.\n\nNow, the government could be set to water down a ban, in favour of caps on the number of ads per hour.\n\nIt was supposed to be a routine call out when four police officers attended a property in regional Queensland just before Christmas in 2022. The young officers approached the house, looking to do a routine welfare check, when they were fired on. After a siege that lasted hours, six people were killed, including two constables.\n\nNow, an inquest is looking into the events that led to the deaths and asking how Australia’s first fundamentalist Christian terror attack happened.\n\nAt Sydney Airport on a muggy night in 2022, a group of volunteers from Sydney’s northern beaches wait to greet a family of refugees they had never met. They’re part of an ambitious new pilot program in which a sponsoring community acts as the safety net for refugees rather than government-funded services. But two years on, the program’s successes are hitting constraints.\n\nToday, Cheyne Anderson on whether the experiment is a sustainable pathway to settlement, or a shortcut to positive government PR.\n\nIt wasn’t so long ago that renewables pundits glowingly described hydrogen as the “Swiss Army knife” of renewable technologies, able to be turned to almost any purpose. But more recently the gas has become an expensive and painful point of political debate, with experts tempering their praise and big backers scaling back projects.\n\nToday, Mike Seccombe on how the green hydrogen dream evaporated.\n\nWhen Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to twenty years jail for sex trafficking crimes, journalist and writer Lucia Osborne-Crowley was there in the courtroom.\n\nBut the more Lucia learned, the more she came to understand the trial as a sham, with many other unnamed, powerful accused perpetrators associated with Epstein and Maxwell still protected, to this day.\n\nIt was one of the biggest corporate scandals the country has ever seen when it was revealed that PwC had used confidential government information to enrich itself and its corporate clients.\n\nSince then there have been more than a dozen inquiries and investigations, yet important questions remain unanswered.\n\nThe government looks set to introduce new laws to overhaul electoral rules. The minister responsible says he wants to address the “growing threat of big money in politics”, with rules like a requirement that all donations over a thousand dollars be disclosed, caps on the amount that can be donated, and a requirement that those donations are made public in real time.\n\nA cap on spending is also on the table – somewhere around a million dollars per candidate, per seat, which is significantly less than many of the teals spent to win.\n\nClimate activist Katta O’Donnell sued the Australian government for failing to disclose how much climate change would impact the value of government bonds. It was a world first case, and she won. But the experience left her feeling more disillusioned than ever and determined to find another way to make change.\n\nToday, Katta O’Donnell on why she believes direct action is the way forward on climate.\n\nThe productivity commission has recommended an overhaul of Australia’s charitable giving rules and is calling out private school building funds specifically as a sign of the randomness and the incoherence of the current system. The federal government is open to reform, except when it comes to private schools.\n\nToday, national correspondent for The Saturday Paper Mike Seccombe on the divide between our richest and poorest schools and the influence wealthy parents have on the Labor government.\n\nThe National Indigenous Australians Agency has referred the white chief executive of the Anindilyakwa Land Council to the National Anti-Corruption Commission over his plan to take a personal 10 per cent stake in a mining project on Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nToday, Gunaikurnai and Wotjobaluk writer Ben Abbatangelo on the plan and the man who stood in its way.\n\nWith just over a hundred days to go until the US election, Joe Biden has announced he’s dropping out of the race. His decision comes after weeks of pressure from donors and colleagues to drop out.\n\nToday, senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre Bruce Wolpe on the key players who pushed Biden out and whether Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump.\n\nThe news has been full of harrowing stories of violence against women in the first half of 2024.

Now there are questions over who knew what, when, and what it means for some of Australia’s largest infrastructure projects.\n\nToday, Martin McKenzie-Murray on the fallout from the union’s upheaval.\n\nAs Australia stares down the barrel of a climate crisis, with the climate wars back in the news and the added push for nuclear energy – the importance of whistleblowing in exposing environmental harms is being highlighted now more than ever.\n\nToday, Regina Featherstone, on how whistleblowers are an untapped resource in the pursuit of a safer climate.\n\nAfter spending nine months in a coma at the hands of her former partner, Shenane Hogg discovered her abuser had amassed $56,000 of debt in her name. Her story is just one of many that was heard at a parliamentary inquiry into how the financial system can be used to abuse women.\n\nToday, Karen Barlow on the sharp rise in financial abuse, and why we’re failing to prevent it.\n\nThe attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump shocked the United States, with prominent politicians condemning the use of violence as un-American. But does that reaction downplay just how pervasive political violence has been in US history?\n\nToday, Nick Bryant, on America’s long and sordid tradition of violence and dangerous rhetoric.\n\nFederal Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has been stressing his closeness to both his home state of Queensland, and to his Coalition partners, the Nationals. Already he has promised to crack down on crime, slow immigration, break up supermarket monopolies, and deliver an energy revolution powered by nuclear. So will the upcoming Queensland state election be a testing ground for Dutton’s federal agenda?\n\nToday, Jason Koutsoukis on how Peter Dutton is marketing himself, and whether Australia is ready to look more like Queensland.\n\nWhen Mostafa Azimitabar was imprisoned on Manus Island, he took up painting using the only supplies available to him – coffee and a toothbrush. Mostafa survived the brutality of Australia’s asylum seeker detention system for more than eight years.\n\nFreed in 2021, he now lives in Sydney. But he paints from the edges of a country whose systems remain hostile towards him, as he navigates temporary visas with no stability, at constant risk of deportation.\n\nThe royal commission into aged care highlighted just how difficult it can be to achieve accountability when someone in care is harmed, especially when the abuse is at the hands of those running the nursing homes and home care services. The federal government is attempting to remedy this with new laws that could see directors and management jailed in particularly egregious cases.\n\nToday, Sarah Holland-Batt on whether the government's new laws will be enough to turn around the disaster that is our aged care system.\n\nMargaret Simons keeps an eye on the influence of defence, foreign affairs and security communities in Canberra – and recently the story of one think tank, China Matters, caught her attention. The influential group, dedicated to bettering Australia’s understanding of China, was defunded during a time of aggressive posturing towards the superpower.\n\nToday, Margaret Simons on why this think tank came undone, and how a crew of anti-China politicians called ‘the Wolverines’ led the attack.\n\nJournalists from The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald are reeling from a recent announcement that Nine Entertainment will slash 200 jobs across the company.

The blueprint, called Project 2025, is more than 900 pages, and includes calls to sack thousands of civil servants, expand presidential power, and dismantle federal agencies.\n\nToday Dr Emma Shortis on Project 2025, and the threat of ‘a second American Revolution’.\n\nWhen people think of the CFMEU, Australia’s powerful and fearsome construction union, they picture its top dog, John Setka. But as he prepares to step down from the union’s Victorian branch, current and former colleagues say his legacy has been so poisonous to the union that he may have even destroyed it.\n\nToday, Martin Mckenzie-Murray on the power and legacy of CFMEU boss, John Setka, and what comes next for the union.\n\nSebastien Lai woke up one morning in 2020 to find dozens of missed phone calls – his father, the Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, had just been arrested.

Then we were told it was a weather station. But now, of course, we know the installation deep in the Northern Territory outback is a US spy base. Which isn’t to say it’s any less secretive – we still don’t know a huge amount about what goes on there.\n\nToday, editor of Declassified Australia and contributor to The Saturday Paper Peter Cronau, on how he discovered the base’s new technology and what it means for Australia’s safety.\n\nNuclear power has been politically toxic in this country for generations.

He was the longest serving treasurer in Australian history and under the then prime minister John Howard, he transformed our economy into what it is today.

The first is that it makes an immense difference to many lives. The second is that it’s wildly expensive and is projected to cost even more in the future. So how to reconcile those two realities?

And can international law survive the scrutiny it’s now under?\n\nToday, expert in international law and professor at the University of California Davis Chimene Keitner on the warrants now drawing attention from around the world.\n\nThe members of this federal Labor government have been pretty disciplined on not publicly criticising party policy. So it raised a few eyebrows when MPs from inner-city seats took aim at the government’s Future Gas Strategy.\n\nToday, national correspondent for The Saturday Paper Mike Seccombe, on what’s behind the gas plan and why a little “sanctioned dissent” might be part of a broader electoral strategy.\n\nJulian Assange’s lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, describes the long, meandering court process Assange has faced as “punishment by process”.
