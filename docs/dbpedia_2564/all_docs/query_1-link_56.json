        "text": "Emmy-winning actor, comedian and writer Bob Einstein, creator of the bumbling stunt man Super Dave Osborne, died today at age 76.\n\nDeadline was the first to report the news on Einstein’s death in Indian Wells, Calif. The outlet reported that Einstein had recently been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nEinstein also played recurring character Marty Funkhouser on more than 24 episodes of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” the hit HBO comedy with Larry David. He also played Larry Middleman on “Arrested Development.”\n\nThe Super Dave character appeared on “Bizarre” from 1980-85, as well as on Showtime’s “Super Dave” from 1987-91. Super Dave, who would always appear in a red-white-and-blue jumpsuit, was a daredevil whose stunts would go horribly wrong, leading to him being hit by a wrecking ball or crushed in car compactor.\n\nEinstein, born in 1942, served as a writer on “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” and “The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour” in the 1960s and ’70s."
