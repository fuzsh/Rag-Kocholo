        "text": "If you are at risk of voice loss or have a condition that can progressively impact your voice, Personal Voice can help. It’s a simple and secure way to create a voice that sounds like you. Read through a series of randomly chosen text prompts to record 15 minutes of audio that can be used to generate a voice that sounds like you. This feature uses on-device machine learning to keep your information private and secure. And Personal Voice seamlessly integrates with Live Speech, so you can type what you want to say and have your iPhone, iPad, or Mac speak it aloud in your Personal Voice.\n\nMagnifier works like a digital magnifying glass, using the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of anything you point it at — from a prescription bottle to a candlelit menu. For those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Image Descriptions, Text Detection, and Point and Speak.\n\nIf you’re standing in line, you can use People Detection to determine a person’s proximity to you. Door Detection can help you navigate by identifying doors, text, and the presence of symbols — such as a restroom symbol, a no smoking symbol, or an accessible-entrance symbol — within a few feet of you. Image Descriptions and Text Detection let you hear more about people, objects, landscapes, and text in your camera’s field of view. And Point and Speak makes it easier to interact with physical objects that have text, like household appliances, keypads, or labels on files. As you point and move your finger over or under different buttons or elements, your iPhone or iPad reads the text out loud, so you can perform everyday activities and tasks with more ease and independence.\n\nA collection of settings supported across product platforms helps you customize your onscreen display according to your personal preferences. Make text easier to read with Bold Text or Larger Text. You can also invert colors, increase contrast, or apply color filters to adapt your screen in ways that best support your vision preferences — and on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV you can reduce transparency. These settings can be applied on an app-by-app basis in iOS and iPadOS. And in macOS, you can even customize the fill and outline color of your pointer to make it easier to spot onscreen.\n\nVoiceOver is an industry-leading screen reader that describes exactly what’s happening on your device. On Apple Vision Pro, VoiceOver speaks the name of each item you look at — explore the screen by pinching and holding your right index finger and thumb. You can also use VoiceOver gestures to explore the screen in order, from top to bottom and left to right. And on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or HomePod, you will receive audible descriptions or braille output of onscreen content when using compatible braille devices. You can explore details about the people, text, table data, and other objects within images. VoiceOver can also describe a person’s position in relation to objects in images, so you can relive memories in greater detail. Customize settings such as pitch range for your preferred built-in voices. Siri voices work better with VoiceOver, too. With the latest advancements in our speech synthesis technology, Siri speech is smooth and expressive, even at high speeds.\n\nCaptions can benefit everyone — people who are deaf or hard of hearing, those wanting to follow along in loud environments, and those who want to enhance their understanding and recollection of a conversation. Live Captions offer real-time transcriptions of speech, audio, and video content. Turn on Live Captions during Phone or FaceTime calls or with any media content in your apps or browser. Or use them to stay connected during in-person conversations. You can customize the look of your captions to suit your needs and preferences. Captions are generated on your device, so your conversations remain private and secure.\n\nApple has worked with top manufacturers to create hearing aids, cochlear implants, and sound processors designed specifically for Apple devices. Apply your audiologist’s presets without having to rely on additional remotes, or adjust your own levels as you move from quiet environments to louder ones. Support for bidirectional hearing aids allows those who are deaf or hard of hearing to have hands-free Phone and FaceTime conversations. And you can easily keep track of your notifications by having Siri announce them through your Made for iPhone hearing device.\n\nAssistiveTouch for Apple Watch lets people with upper-body limb differences use their Apple Watch without ever having to touch the display or controls. Using built-in motion sensors and on-device learning, Apple Watch detects subtle differences in muscle movements and tendon activity, letting you control the display through hand gestures like a pinch or a clench. Answer incoming calls, control an onscreen motion pointer, and access Notification Center, Control Center, and more. You can also use AssistiveTouch for Apple Watch to run shortcuts with Siri to complete tasks or modify VoiceOver and Switch Control settings on your iPhone.\n\nAssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS helps you adapt standard gestures — like pinch, rotate, or swipe — to make them more comfortable for you. You can make other actions, like changing volume, accessible from the AssistiveTouch menu. And with Apple Vision Pro, you can assign gestures, such as single tap, double tap, or long press, to run custom actions when you interact with the AssistiveTouch menu button. If certain gestures don’t work for you, swap them with a gesture that does or create a touch that’s all your own. You can also customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu and connect assistive pointer devices via Bluetooth and USB.\n\nAssistive Access makes it easy for people with cognitive disabilities to tailor iPhone and iPad to reduce cognitive load and suit their specific needs. Designed with feedback from individuals with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters, this feature helps people focus on the activities they enjoy most and that are foundational to iPhone and iPad — connecting with friends and family, taking and sharing photos, and listening to music.\n\nAssistive Access offers a distinctive interface with high-contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help individuals and trusted supporters focus the experience in specific apps — Phone and FaceTime (which have been combined into a single Calls app), Messages, Camera, Photos, and Music. You can also choose a more visual, grid-based layout for your Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout if you prefer text."
