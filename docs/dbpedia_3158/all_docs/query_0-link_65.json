        "text": "Meta AI’s Ilama 3: The Most Awaited Intelligent AI-Assistant\n\nMeta has released Llama 3 pre-trained and instruction-fine-tuned language models with 8 billion (8B) and 70 billion (70B) parameters. These models have new features, like better reasoning, coding, and math-solving capabilities. They set a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) for models of their sizes that are open-source and you can use. This release builds upon the company's commitment to accessible, SoTA models. Llama 3 technology stands out because it focuses on capabilities that are tuned to specific instructions. This shows that Meta is serious about making helpful, safe AI systems that align with what users want. The Llama 3 family of models utilizes over 400 TFLOPS per GPU when trained on 16,000 GPUs simultaneously. The training runs were performed on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters. In this article, you will learn: What we know so far about the underlying Llama 3 architecture (surprisingly, it’s not a Mixture of Experts; MoE). Key capabilities of the multi-parameter model. Key differentiators from Llama 2 and other models. The performance on benchmarks against other SoTA models. Potential applications and use cases. How you can test it out and plug it into your application now. Here’s the TL;DR if you are pressed for time: Llama 3 models come in both pre-trained and instruction-following variants. Llama 3 promises increased responsiveness and accuracy in following complex instructions, which could lead to smoother user experiences with AI systems. The model release includes 8B, 70B, and 400B+ parameters, which allow for flexibility in resource management and potential scalability. It integrates with search engines like Google and Bing to draw on up-to-date, real-time information and augment its responses. It uses a new tokenizer with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. This enables it to encode language much more efficiently. It offers notably improved token efficiency—despite the larger 8B model, Llama 3 maintains inference efficiency on par with Llama 2 7B. Understanding the Model Architecture In addition, training the model was three times more efficient than Llama 2. In this section, you will learn the architectural components of Llama 3 that make it this efficient: Model Architecture with Improved Tokinzer Efficiency Like many SoTA LLMs, Llama 3 uses a Transformer-based architecture. This architecture allows efficient parallelization during training and inference, making it well-suited for large-scale models. Here are the key insights: Efficiency Focus: Adopting a standard decoder-only Transformer architecture prioritizes computational efficiency during inference (i.e., generating text). Vocabulary Optimization: The 128K token vocabulary offers significantly improved encoding efficiency compared to Llama 2. This means the model can represent more diverse language patterns with fewer parameters, potentially boosting performance without increasing model size. Fine-Tuning the Attention Mechanism: Grouped query attention (GQA) aims to improve inference (text generation) for the 8B and 70B parameter models. This technique could improve speed without sacrificing quality. Long Sequence Handling: Training on 8,192 token sequences focuses on processing longer text inputs. This is essential for handling complex documents, conversations, or code where context extends beyond short passages. Document Boundary Awareness: Using a mask during self-attention prevents information leakage across document boundaries. This is vital for tasks like summarizing or reasoning over multiple documents, where maintaining clear distinctions is crucial. Surprisingly, its architecture does not use Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which is popular with most recent LLMs. Pretraining Data Composition Llama 3 was trained on over 15 trillion tokens. The pretraining dataset is more than seven times larger than Llama 2's. Here are the key insights on the pretraining data: Massive Dataset Scale: The 15T+ token dataset is a massive increase over Llama 2, implying gains in model generalization and the ability to handle more nuanced language patterns. Code Emphasis: The dataset contains four times more code samples, which improves the model’s coding abilities. Multilingual Preparation: Over 5% more non-English data than used to train Llama 2 for future multilingual applications exist. Though performance in non-English languages will likely differ initially. Quality Control Rigor: The team developed data filtering pipelines to build high-quality training data. They used heuristic filters, NSFW removal, deduplication, and classifiers to ensure model integrity and reduce potential biases. Data Mixing Experimentation: The emphasis on experimentation with varying data mixes highlights the importance of finding an optimal balance for diverse downstream use cases. This suggests Meta understands that the model will excel in different areas based on its training composition. Scaling Up Pre-training Training LLMs remains computationally expensive, even with the most efficient implementations. Training Llama 3 demanded more than better scaling laws and infrastructure; it required efficient strategies (scaling up pre-training) to achieve highly effective training time across 16,000 GPUs. Here are key insights on scaling training: Scaling Laws as Guides: Meta leans heavily on scaling laws to determine optimal data mixes and resource allocation during training. These laws aren't foolproof but likely enable more informed decision-making about model development. Continued Improvement with Massive Data: The 8B and 70B models show significant log-linear improvement up to 15T tokens. This suggests that even large models can benefit from more data, defying the notion of diminishing returns within the dataset sizes explored. Parallelization Techniques: Combining data, model, and pipeline parallelisms allowed them to efficiently train on up to 16K GPUs simultaneously. Reliability and Fault Tolerance: The automated error detection, hardware reliability focus, and scalable storage enhancements emphasize the practical realities of training huge models. 95%+ effective training time is remarkable! The team reported a 3x increase in training efficiency over Llama 2. This is remarkable and likely due to a combination of the abovementioned techniques. The most important thing to remember is that bigger models can do the same work with less computation. However, smaller models are still better because they are better at generating responses quickly. This makes choosing the right model size for the job even more important. Instruction Fine Tuning Meta's blog mentioned Llama 3 is fine-tuned in instructions-following. This likely involved specific fine-tuning techniques on datasets designed to improve the model's ability to understand and execute complex instructions. Here are key insights: Hybrid Finetuning Approach: Meta combines several techniques for instruction-tuning—supervised fine-tuning (SFT), rejection sampling, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and direct policy optimization (DPO). This multi-pronged strategy suggests flexibility and tailoring to specific use cases. Data as the Differentiator: The emphasis is on the quality of prompts and preference rankings as prime drivers of aligned model performance. This highlights the involvement of fine-tuning techniques and data curation. Human-in-the-Loop: Multiple rounds of quality assurance on human annotations remind us that human feedback remains vital for aligning and refining these complex models. Reasoning and Coding Benefits: PPO and DPO with preference ranking data significantly boosted Llama 3's performance on reasoning and coding tasks. This underscores the power of these techniques in specific domains. Answer Selection Fine-Tuning: Intriguingly, models can sometimes 'understand' the correct answer but struggle with selection. Preference ranking training directly addresses this, teaching the model to discriminate between output possibilities. Recommended: Training vs. Fine-tuning: What is the Difference?

Summarization: Llama 3's ability to process long input sequences and fine-tuned understanding of instructions position it well for text summarization. It might condense articles, reports, or meeting transcripts into key points. Model Evaluation Performance Benchmarking (Comparison: Gemma, Gemini, and Claude 3) The team evaluated the models' performance on standard benchmarks and tried to find the best way to make them work in real-life situations. They created a brand-new, high-quality set of human evaluations to do this. This test set has 1,800 questions that cover 12 main use cases: asking for help, coming up with ideas, sorting, answering closed questions, coding, creative writing, extraction, taking on the role of a character or persona, answering open questions, reasoning, rewriting, and summarizing. Llama 3 70B broadly outperforms Gemini Pro 1.5 and Claude 3 Sonnet. It is a bit behind on MATH, which Gemini Pro 1.5 seems better at. But it is small enough to host at scale without breaking the bank. Here’s the performance benchmark for the instruction-following model: Meta Llama 3 Instruct model performance. Meta Llama 3 Pre-trained model performance. Let’s look at some of these benchmarks. MMLU (Knowledge Benchmark) The MMLU benchmark assesses a model's ability to understand and answer questions that require factual and common-sense knowledge.

As soon as your model sees real-world data, its performance drops below what you expected. This is a common production machine learning (ML) problem for many teams—not just yours. It can also be a very frustrating experience for computer vision (CV) engineers, ML teams, and data scientists. There are many potential factors behind these. Problems could stem from the quality of the production data, the design of the production pipelines, the model itself, or operational hurdles the system faces in production. In this article, you will learn the four (4) reasons why computer vision models fail in production and thoroughly examine the ML lifecycle stages where they occur. These reasons show you the most common production CV and data science problems. Knowing their causes may help you prevent, mitigate, or fix them. You’ll also see the various strategies for addressing these problems at each step. Let’s jump right into it! Why do Models Fail in Production? The ML lifecycle governs how ML models are developed and shipped; it involves sourcing data, data exploration and preparation (data cleaning and EDA), model training, and model deployment, where users can consume the model predictions. These processes are interdependent, as an error in one stage could affect the corresponding stages, resulting in a model that doesn’t perform well—or completely fails—in production. Organizations develop machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models to add value to their businesses. When errors occur at any ML development stage, they can lead to production models failing, costing businesses capital, human resources, and opportunities to satisfy customer expectations. Consider the implications of poorly labeling data for a CV model after data collection. Or the model has an inherent bias—it could invariably affect results in a production environment. It is noteworthy that the problem can start when businesses do not have precise reasons or objectives for developing and deploying machine learning models, which can cripple the process before it begins. Assuming the organization has passed all stages and deployed its model, the errors we often see that lead to models failing in production include: Mislabeling data, which can train models on incorrect information. ML engineers and CV teams that prioritize data quality only at later stages rather than as a foundational practice. Ignoring the drift in data distribution over time can make models outdated or irrelevant. Implementing minimal or no validation (quality assurance) steps risks unnoticed errors progressing to production. Viewing model deployment as the final goal, neglecting necessary ongoing monitoring and adjustments. Let’s look deeper at these errors and why they are the top reasons we see production models fail. Reason #1: Data Labeling Errors Data labeling is the foundation for training machine learning models, particularly supervised learning, where models learn patterns directly from labeled data. This involves humans or AI systems assigning informative labels to raw data—whether it be images, videos, or DICOM—to provide context that enables models to learn. AI algorithms also synthesize labeled data. Check out our guide on synthetic data and why it is useful. Despite its importance, data labeling is prone to errors, primarily because it often relies on human annotators. These errors can compromise a model's accuracy by teaching it incorrect patterns. Consider a scenario in a computer vision project to identify objects in images from data sources. Even a small percentage of mislabeled images can lead the model to associate incorrect features with an object. This could mean the model makes wrong predictions in production. Potential Solution: Automated Labeling Error Detection A potential solution is adopting tools and frameworks that automatically detect labeling errors. These tools analyze labeling patterns to identify outliers or inconsistent labels, helping annotators revise and refine the data. An example is Encord Active. Encord Active is one of three products in the Encord platform (the others are Annotate and Index) that includes features to find failure modes in your data, labels, and model predictions. A common data labeling issue is the border closeness of the annotations. Training data with many border-proximate annotations can lead to poor model generalization. If a model is frequently exposed to partially visible objects during training, it might not perform well when presented with fully visible objects in a deployment scenario. This can affect the model's accuracy and reliability in production. Let’s see how Encord Active can help you, for instance, identify border-proximate annotations. Step 1: Select your Project. Step 2: Under the “Explorer” dashboard, find the “Labels” tab. Encord Active automatically finds patterns in the data and labels to surface potential issues with the label. Step 3: On the right pane, click on one of the issues EA found to filter your data and labels by it. In this case, “Border Closeness”; click on it. “Relative Area.” - Identifies annotations that are too close to image borders. Images with a Border Proximity score of 1 are flagged as too close to the border. Step 4: Select one of the images to inspect and validate the issue. Here’s a GIF with the steps: You will notice that EA also shows you the model’s predictions alongside the annotations, so you can visually inspect the annotation issue and resulting prediction. Step 5: Visually inspect the top images EA flags and use the Collections feature to curate them. There are a few approaches you could take after creating the Collections: Exclude the images that are border-proximate from the training data if the complete structure of the object is crucial for your application. This prevents the model from learning from incomplete data, which could lead to inaccuracies in object detection. Send the Collection to annotators for review. Recommended Read: 5 Ways to Improve the Quality of Labeled Data. Reason #2: Poor Data Quality The foundation of any ML model's success lies in the quality of the data it's trained on. High-quality data is characterized by its accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and relevance to the business problem (\"fit for purpose\"). Several common issues can compromise data quality: Duplicate Images: They can artificially increase the frequency of particular features or patterns in the training data. This gives the model a false impression of these features' importance, causing overfitting. Noise in Images: Blur, distortion, poor lighting, or irrelevant background objects can mask important image features, hindering the model's ability to learn and recognize relevant patterns. Unrepresentative Data: When the training dataset doesn't accurately reflect the diversity of real-world scenarios, the model can develop biases. For example, a facial recognition system trained mainly on images of people with lighter skin tones may perform poorly on individuals with darker skin tones. Limited Data Variation: A model trained on insufficiently diverse data (including duplicates and near-duplicates) will struggle to adapt to new or slightly different images in production. For example, if a self-driving car system is trained on images taken in sunny weather, it might fail in rainy or snowy conditions. Potential Solution: Data Curation One way to tackle poor data quality, especially after collection, is to curate good quality data. Here is how to use Encord Active to automatically detect and classify duplicates in your set. Curate Duplicate Images Your testing and validation sets might contain duplicate training images that inflate the performance metrics. This makes the model appear better than it is, which could lead to false confidence about its real-world capabilities. Step 1: Navigate to the Explorer dashboard → Data tab On the right-hand pane, you will notice Encord Active has automatically detected common data quality issues based on the metrics it computed from the data. See an overview of the issues EA can detect on this documentation page. Step 2: Under the issues found, click on Duplicates to see the images EA flags as duplicates and near-duplicates with uniqueness scores of 0.0 to 0.00001. There are two steps you could take to solve this issue: Carefully remove duplicates, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets, to avoid skewing the class distribution further. If duplicates cannot be fully removed (e.g., to maintain the original distribution of rare cases), use data augmentation techniques to introduce variations within the set of duplicates themselves. This can help mitigate some of the overfitting effects. Step 3: Under the Data tab, curate duplicates you want to remove or use augmentation techniques to improve by selecting them. Click Add to a Collection → Name the collection ‘Duplicates’ and add a description. See the complete steps: Once the duplicates are in the Collection, you can use the tag to filter them out of your training or validation data. If relevant, you can also create a new dataset to apply the data augmentation techniques. Other solutions could include: Implement Robust Data Validation Checks: Use automated tools that continuously validate data accuracy, consistency, and completeness at the entry point (ingestion) and throughout the data pipeline. Adopt a Centralized Data Management Platform: A unified view of data across sources (e.g., data lakes) can help identify discrepancies early and simplify access for CV engineers (or DataOps teams) to maintain data integrity. See Also: Improving Data Quality Using End-to-End Data Pre-Processing Techniques in Encord Active. Reason #3: Data Drift Data drift occurs when the statistical properties of the real-world images a model encounters in production change over time, diverging from the samples it was trained on. Drift can happen due to various factors, including: Concept Drift: The underlying relationships between features and the target variable change. For example, imagine a model trained to detect spam emails. The features that characterize spam (certain keywords, sender domains) can evolve over time. Covariate Shift: The input feature distribution changes while the relationship to the target variable remains unchanged. For instance, a self-driving car vision system trained in summer might see a different distribution of images (snowy roads, different leaf colors) in winter. Prior Probability Shift: The overall frequency of different classes changes. For example, a medical image classification model trained for a certain rare disease may encounter it more frequently as its prevalence changes in the population. If you want to dig deeper into the causes of drifts, check out the “Data Distribution Shifts and Monitoring” article. Potential Solution: Monitoring Data Drift There are two steps you could take to address data drift: Use tools that monitor the model's performance and the input data distribution. Look for shifts in metrics and statistical properties over time. Collect new data representing current conditions and retrain the model at appropriate intervals. This can be done regularly or triggered by alerts when significant drift is detected. You can achieve both within Encord: Step 1: Create the Dataset on Annotate to log your input data for training or production. If your data is on a cloud platform, check out one of the data integrations to see if it works with your stack. Step 2: Create an Ontology to define the structure of the dataset. Step 3: Create an Annotate Project based on your dataset and the ontology. Ensure the project also includes Workflows because some features in Encord Active only support projects that include workflows. Step 4: Import your Annotate Project to Active. This will allow you to import the data, ground truth, and any custom metrics to evaluate your data quality. See how it’s done in the video tutorial on the documentation. Step 5: Select the Project → Import your Model Predictions. There are two steps to inspect the issues with the input data: Use the analytics view to get a statistical summary of the data. Use the issues found by Encord Active to manually inspect where your model is struggling. Step 6: On the Explorer dashboard → Data tab → Analytics View. Step 7: Under the Metric Distribution chart, select a quality metric to assess the distribution of your input data on. In this example, “Diversity\" applies algorithms to rank images from easy to hard samples to annotate. Easy samples have lower scores, while hard samples have higher scores. Step 8: On the right-hand pane, click on Dark. Navigate back to Grid View → Click on one of the images to inspect the ground truth (if available) vs. model predictions. Observe that the poor lightning could have caused the model to misidentify the toy bear as a person. (Of course, other reasons, such as class imbalance, could cause the model to misclassify the object.) You can inspect the class balance on the Analytics View → Class Distribution chart. Nice! Recommended Read: How to Detect Data Drift on Datasets. There are other ways to manage data drift, including the following approaches: Adaptive Learning: Consider online learning techniques where the model continuously updates itself based on new data without full retraining. Note that this is still an active area of research with challenges in computer vision. Domain Adaptation: If collecting substantial amounts of labeled data from the new environment is not feasible, use domain adaptation techniques to bridge the gap between the old and new domains. Recommended Read:A Practical Guide to Active Learning for Computer Vision. Reason #4: Thinking Deployment is the Final Step (No Observability) Many teams mistakenly treat deployment as the finish line, which is one reason machine learning projects fail in production. However, it's crucial to remember that this is simply one stage in a continuous cycle. Models in production often degrade over time due to factors such as data drift (changes in input data distribution) or model drift (changes in the underlying relationships the model was trained on). Neglecting post-deployment maintenance invites model staleness and eventual failure. This is where MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) becomes essential. MLOps provides practices and technologies to monitor, maintain, and govern ML systems in production. Potential Solution: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) The core principle of MLOps is ensuring your model provides continuous business value while in production. How teams operationalize ML varies, but some key practices include: Model Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools to track performance metrics (accuracy, precision, etc.) and automatically alert you to degradation. Consider a feedback loop to trigger retraining processes where necessary, either for real-time or batch deployment. Logging: Even if full MLOps tools aren't initially feasible, start by logging model predictions and comparing them against ground truth, like we showed above with Encord. This offers early detection of potential issues. Management and Governance: Establish reproducible ML pipelines for continuous training (CT) and automate model deployment. From the start, consider regulatory compliance issues in your industry. Recommended Read:Model Drift: Best Practices to Improve ML Model Performance. Key Takeaways: 4 Reasons Computer Vision Models Fail in Production Remember that model deployment is not the last step. Do not waste time on a model only to have it fail a few days, weeks, or months later. ML systems differ across teams and organizations, but most failures are common. If you study your ML system, you’ll likely see that some of the reasons your model fails in production are similar to those listed in this article: 1. Data labelling errors 2. Poor data quality 3. Data drift in production 4. Thinking deployment is the final step The goal is for you to understand these failures and learn the best practices to solve or avoid them. You’d also realize that while most failure modes are data-centric, others are technology-related and involve team practices, culture, and available resources.\n\nApr 24 2024\n\n8 M\n\nMeta’s Llama 3.1 Explained\n\nMeta has released Llama 3.1, an open-source AI model that rivals the best closed-source models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Anthropic’s Claude 3, and Google Gemini in flexibility, control, and capabilities.

With greater computing power and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms, AI is approaching a new era where large multimodal models dominate the AI landscape. Reports suggest the multimodal AI market will grow by 35% annually to USD 4.5 billion by 2028 as the demand for analyzing extensive unstructured data increases. These models can comprehend multiple data modalities simultaneously and generate more accurate predictions than their traditional counterparts. In this article, we will discuss what multimodal models are, how they work, the top models in 2024, current challenges, and future trends. What are Multimodal Models? Multimodal models are AI deep-learning models that simultaneously process different modalities, such as text, video, audio, and image, to generate outputs. Multimodal frameworks contain mechanisms to integrate multimodal data collected from multiple sources for more context-specific and comprehensive understanding. In contrast, unimodal models use traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms to process a single data modality simultaneously. For instance, You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular object detection model that only understands visual data. Unimodal vs. Multimodal Framework While unimodal models are less complex than multimodal algorithms, multimodal systems offer greater accuracy and enhanced user experience. Due to these benefits, multimodal frameworks are helpful in multiple industrial domains. For instance, manufacturers use autonomous mobile robots that process data from multiple sensors to localize objects. Moreover, healthcare professionals use multimodal models to diagnose diseases using medical images and patient history reports. How Multimodal Models Work? Although multimodal models have varied architectures, most frameworks have a few standard components. A typical architecture includes an encoder, a fusion mechanism, and a decoder. Architecture Encoders Encoders transform raw multimodal data into machine-readable feature vectors or embeddings that models use as input to understand the data’s content. Embeddings Multimodal models often have three types of encoders for each data type - image, text, and audio. Image Encoders: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice for an image encoder. CNNs can convert image pixels into feature vectors to help the model understand critical image properties. Text Encoders: Text encoders transform text descriptions into embeddings that models can use for further processing. They often use transformer models like those in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) frameworks. Audio Encoders: Audio encoders convert raw audio files into usable feature vectors that capture critical audio patterns, including rhythm, tone, and context. Wav2Vec2 is a popular choice for learning audio representations. Fusion Mechanism Strategies Once the encoders transform multiple modalities into embeddings, the next step is to combine them so the model can understand the broader context reflected in all data types. Developers can use various fusion strategies according to the use case. The list below mentions key fusion strategies. Early Fusion: Combines all modalities before passing them to the model for processing. Intermediate Fusion: Projects each modality onto a latent space and fuses the latent representations for further processing. Late Fusion: Processes all modalities in their raw form and fuses the output for each. Hybrid Fusion: Combines early, intermediate, and late fusion strategies at different model processing phases. Fusion Mechanism Methods While the list above mentions the high-level fusion strategies, developers can use multiple methods within each strategy to fuse the relevant modalities. Attention-based Methods Attention-based methods use the transformer architecture to convert embeddings from multiple modalities into a query-key-value structure. The technique emerged from a seminal paper - Attention is All You Need - published in 2017. Researchers initially employed the method for improving language models, as attention networks allowed these models to have longer context windows. However, developers now use attention-based methods in other domains, including computer vision (CV) and generative AI. Attention networks allow models to understand relationships between embeddings for context-aware processing. Cross-modal attention frameworks fuse different modalities in a multimodal context according to the inter-relationships between each data type. For instance, an attention filter will allow the model to understand which parts of a text prompt relate to an image’s visual embeddings, leading to a more efficient fusion output. Concatenation Concatenation is a straightforward fusion technique that merges multiple embeddings into a single feature representation. For instance, the method will concatenate a textual embedding with a visual feature vector to generate a consolidated multimodal feature. The method helps in intermediate fusion strategies by combining the latent representations for each modality. Dot-Product The dot-product method involves element-wise multiplication of feature vectors from different modalities. It helps capture the interactions and correlations between modalities, assisting models to understand the commonalities among different data types. However, it only helps in cases where the feature vectors do not suffer from high dimensionality. Taking dot-products of high-dimensional vectors may require extensive computational power and result in features that only capture common patterns between modalities, disregarding critical nuances. Decoders The last component is a decoder network that processes the feature vectors from different modalities to produce the required output. Decoders can contain cross-modal attention networks to focus on different parts of input data and produce relevant outputs. For instance, translation models often use cross-attention techniques to understand the meanings of sentences in different languages simultaneously. Recurrent neural network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks are popular choices for constructing decoders to perform tasks involving sequential, visual, or generative processes. Learn how multimodal models work in our detailed guide on multimodal learning Multimodal Models - Use Cases With recent advancements in multimodal models, AI systems can perform complex tasks involving the simultaneous integration and interpretation of multiple modalities. The capabilities allow users to implement AI in large-scale environments with extensive and diverse data sources requiring robust processing pipelines. The list below mentions a few of these tasks that multimodal models perform efficiently. Visual Question-Answering (VQA): VQA involves a model answering user queries regarding visual content. For instance, a healthcare professional may ask a multimodal model regarding the content of an X-ray scan. By combining visual and textual prompts, multimodal models provide relevant and accurate responses to help users perform VQA. Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image Search: Multimodal models help users build powerful search engines that can type natural language queries to search for particular images. They can also build systems that retrieve relevant documents in response to image-based queries. For instance, a user may give an image as input to prompt the system to search for relevant blogs and articles containing the image. Generative AI: Generative AI models help users with text and image generation tasks that require multimodal capabilities. For instance, multimodal models can help users with image captioning, where they ask the model to generate relevant labels for a particular image. They can also use these models for natural language processing (NLP) use cases that involve generating textual descriptions based on video, image, or audio data. Image Segmentation: Image segmentation involves dividing an image into regions to distinguish between different elements within an image. Segmentation Multimodal models can help users perform segmentation more quickly by segmenting areas automatically based on textual prompts. For instance, users can ask the model to segment and label items in the image’s background.

Devin, for instance, is an advanced AI software engineer who writes code based on user requirements without manual intervention. Machine Learning Frameworks Providers of AI as a service sell multiple solutions to help users quickly build and deploy AI applications. These frameworks have AI functionalities that streamline model development, deployment, and monitoring. Google Cloud AI is a good example, offering multiple AI services to summarize large documents, deploy ML image processing pipelines, and help create chat apps with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) APIs allow users to connect different systems for shared communication and help build an integrated platform to perform specific tasks. AIaaS providers offer APIs that let users create complex end-to-end solutions with AI capabilities that integrate seamlessly with existing tech infrastructure. The Open AI API is a good example, as it allows users to integrate state-of-the-art generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models into custom AI applications. Data Labeling Data labeling is a crucial process in AI development that involves annotating data points to create accurate, relevant, and consistent datasets to train AI models. AIaaS platforms offering data labeling services include pre-built models that understand input data to automatically label items and check label quality, speeding up the annotation process. Popular AI-based data labeling platforms include Encord, LabelBox, and Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Benefits and Challenges of AI as a Service Like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), AIaaS allows users to have better accessibility to AI for building complex AI technologies. But, how to determine if your use case requires AIaaS solution? One practical way is to understand the benefits and challenges AIaaS involves. Below are the most significant benefits and challenges associated with AIaaS. Benefits The primary benefits that AIaaS offers include scalability, productivity gains, enhanced automation, and cost-effectiveness. Scalability AIaaS allows users to scale their operations according to demand quickly. It significantly benefits small businesses that can upgrade their AIaaS plans instead of building in-house AI solutions. For instance, a startup running a chatbot on an e-commerce site can subscribe to higher-tier packages to handle increasing customer queries. Productivity Gains AIaaS platforms allow technical staff to identify and resolve issues more efficiently, leading to better decision-making and increased productivity gains. For instance, AI-based data labeling platforms compute relevant quality metrics that indicate where the issue lies. It helps annotators and reviewers fix labeling errors quickly with minimal effort. AIaaS solutions can also include forecasting models that can predict key performance metrics to allow for more proactive action. According to McKinsey, combining such AI platforms with other technologies can boost productivity by 3.4 percent annually. Enhanced Automation AIaaS lets you quickly automate routine tasks through AI agents and easy-to-use APIs that can seamlessly integrate with your existing AI infrastructure. For instance, AIaaS platforms can help businesses build real-time pipelines to perform data pre-processing tasks on extensive datasets. The platforms can also flag issues and allow users to focus on finding efficient solutions. Cost Effectiveness AIaaS is more cost-effective than in-house AI systems as businesses do not have to manage the infrastructure themselves. For instance, a business wanting to build its proprietary AI solution must bear the costs of staff recruitment and compatible hardware and software while ensuring proper employee training. In contrast, businesses can quickly integrate AIaaS platforms into their existing system or use cloud computing for more optimal performance. Additionally, AIaaS providers will perform maintenance and upgrade procedures so users can allocate their resources to more relevant tasks. Challenges Although AIaaS allows businesses to use cutting-edge technology to optimize workflows, a few issues make choosing the right AIaaS provider challenging. Data Privacy Issues AI applications involve a significant amount of sensitive customer data to perform efficiently. However, businesses using AIaaS platforms run the risk of exposing their data sources to the AIaaS provider, who has access to all sensitive information. Recent reports show that 93% of organizations suffered two or more identity-related breaches in 2023. The situation can lead to data breaches, causing the business to incur heavy losses. For instance, weak vendor security protocols can lead to data leaks, which can significantly reduce customer confidence and cause a loss of market. Businesses must verify data privacy procedures and compliance certifications the vendor follows to avoid such incidents. Vendor Lock-in Changing vendors can be costly as migrating from one platform to another involves staff retraining, time spent discussing requirements, and possible downtime that disrupts daily business operations. A recent survey shows that around 47% of businesses cited vendor lock-in as a significant concern. Organizations can avoid vendor lock-in issues by assessing the vendor’s market experience, customer reviews, and commitment to meeting the organization’s strategic goals in the long term. Less Customizability AIaaS platforms often lack customization options, as users cannot access the low-level code of AI algorithms. The problem worsens for businesses that operate in dynamic environments and require frequent feature changes and upgrades. For instance, a business analyzing user reviews may find that a generic sentiment analysis model on an AIaaS platform performs poorly on a customer group in a different geographical location. The reason could be their different language or expressions to provide feedback. A hybrid approach combining AIaaS models with in-house custom solutions can help mitigate these issues. Constant collaboration with vendors can also help them understand your changing needs. Skills and Knowledge Gap Although AIaaS providers manage the backend infrastructure, users still need AI expertise to use the platform to its full potential. However, finding the right talent is challenging as AI technology evolves rapidly. A survey reports that 48% of tech leaders say the lack of appropriate staff with relevant AI expertise is the most significant roadblock in AI implementation. A possible solution includes choosing vendors with dedicated support staff who can help users become familiar with all the platform's features. Businesses can also conduct regular training to help build technical acumen as new AI technologies emerge. Choosing the Best AIaaS Platform The above-mentioned benefits and challenges give you a reasonable starting point for understanding how to choose a suitable AIaaS platform. However, selecting the best platform can still be overwhelming due to vendors offering multiple solutions. Below is a brief list of factors you must consider when investing in an AIaaS framework. Functionality: Check if the platform contains all the relevant features for your specific use case.
