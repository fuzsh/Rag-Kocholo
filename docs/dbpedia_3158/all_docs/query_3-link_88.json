        "text": "I've been using SwiftKey for a few years now. I started with my cell phone and now I have it on all 7 devices we have in our home. It's a must have for anyone who can appreciate just how much it does and without even realizing. It keeps track of your choice of words and easily guesses and or auto corrects as you go. Can't begin to imagine how much time just that alone has saved me/my family over the years. It does it with such accuracy that when I had to use someone else's device I was amazed. I didn't realize how much this simple app did for me in my every day typing of texts, sending emails, even searching the web. It took all of 30 seconds into using my friends tablet for me to stumble over such basic words, but in a good way. I'd gotten so used to SwiftKey guessing my desired word after only the first or second letter.\n\nI recommend SwiftKey to anyone who has an electronic device used for texts, emails, notes, calendars, and any and everything in between and can appreciate the time this app saves you.\n\nI'm team SwiftKey 1000% and I never take the time to leave reviews for anything. I mean ever which clearly shows just how awesome this app is. You will not be disappointed!!!\n\nBeen using this app since way before Microsoft bought it. And I didn't even mind the little label on the space key that says \"Microsoft SwiftKey\". But the new toolbar is horrific. First there is an ugly square button on the left (btw... it doesn't even match any of the keyboard themes) for Bing. Bing. Really? The one search engine that no one likes. And also there is no way to remove the button or even allow you to change it to a real search engine. The center of the toolbar now has a border which is ugly and they added an icon menu on the right that doesn't even do everything the original toolbar could do and now I have to press another button. Stop forcing Bing on people and don't fix what isn't broke. I'm praying this is just a nightmare and that everything will go back to normal by the next update or I'm shopping for a new keyboard. Addendumâ¦ You made the button a little more theme-friendly, but I still don't want it. And if you read EVERY other review since you added it, I am clearly not alone. Nobody wants Bing and NO ONE wants to be forced into it. Everyone has their preferred search engine. This is also why so many people are switching to Mac. No one wants to be forced into anything. This is wrong! Fix it!\n\nUpdate:\n\nIncreasing to 3 stars as they at least have an option to remove that dumb button to that search engine that no one likes. But stop making changes now! Just fix the bugs and be done with it.\n\n1) Misses a lot of words; for instance i can't even simply type \"you're\" (i don't rely on auto correct and as you can see from this, Swype doesn't properly capitalize \"i\" like word flow did, it also doesn't space words properly but it does get apostrophes right. 2) Requires full keyboard access just to use the swiping feature. Blah. 3) There's a third thing but i forgot what it is since these keyboards mess up my train of thought with their problems. Word flow didn't do that. Yeah, i would use word flow still if it worked on my iPhone x but i had some issues so tried to check this out. Back to Swype i guess.\n\nEdit: The âteamâ responded to my review after SIX YEARS. As we know, MS often changes the features and abilities of apps, adding and removing features as they go along like theyâre throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. The point being a review from six years ago is hardly relevant, why are you wasting time now addressing only the smallest issue I brought up (#2) in the review? Iâll add a new negative note that I thought of it, the amount of space available for your app is reduced because this keyboard uses more space. Some apps donât like that, putting things you need to see while typing iâm the covered area. It appears this is not configurable in the keyboard to turn off unused features if youâre only trying to get swiping, but Apple includes that now (except for the aforementioned ability to recognize and capitalize âIâ)."
