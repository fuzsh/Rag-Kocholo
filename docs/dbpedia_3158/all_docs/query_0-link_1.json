        "text": "Microsoft's Smart Personal Objects Technology initiative released its next generation of Smart Watches for MSN Direct.\n\nThe ABACUS Smart Watch 2006 has a thinner bezel and more stylish bands from Fossil Inc. but also doubles the storage capacity of previous watches and improves upon download speed of content from MSN Direct Channels.\n\nAs part of the MSN Direct Smart Plan ($39.95 value), content includes news, weather, sports scores, movie times, traffic and horoscopes, among other things; and for $20 more per year consumers can receive MSN Messenger personal messages and Microsoft Office Outlook calendar sync, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe smart phone is available online at Brookstone.com, Amazon.com and MSNDirect.com for $179 and includes a one-year subscription to the MSN Direct Smart Plan.\n\n\"This new generation of Smart Watches gives wearers greater choice, convenience and value,\" said Eric Lang, general manager of the SPOT initiative at Microsoft. \"With the ABACUS Smart Watch 2006, we not only refined the aesthetics, but also significantly enhanced the technology within the watch and are pleased with this latest extension of the SPOT vision.\""
