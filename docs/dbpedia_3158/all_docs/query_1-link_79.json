        "text": "Timing is everything — especially if you’re a business leader considering emerging technology investments. AI, blockchain, virtual reality, even quantum computing and the rest of the Essential Eight can drive business growth. But without the right approach, they can result in wasted investments, shareholder frustration and uncertain futures for the executive champion. Cautionary tales abound — from the VHS rental days through the dot.com bust to premature forays in extended reality. Still, there are success stories, companies that have created whole new markets, revenue streams and business models.\n\nSo, what determines if your emerging tech strategy is prescient — or premature? How do you avoid falling for hype or falling behind? How do you balance these efforts with other pressing needs such as cloud migration, compliance obligations and day-to-day operations?\n\nWe designed our 2023 Emerging Technology Survey to help answer these questions. The results, along with our first-hand experience within PwC and with clients, can help you make the most of these technologies: how to develop a strategy, execute effectively and grow trust with stakeholders every step of the way toward delivering positive business outcomes.\n\nOur survey shows that a few companies — very few — are getting these technologies right. Executives in these organizations report significantly higher benefits from emerging tech in general, and from generative AI (GenAI) in particular, than their peers. With the help of tech-specific governance and of workforce transformations, many are even using emerging tech to build trust with stakeholders.\n\nWe call these companies — 7% of respondents in our survey — EmTech Accelerators. Our survey data not only identifies these companies, it pinpoints four practices that likely explain their success.\n\nWhere investments are flowing: EmTech in US business today\n\nIn 2016, we identified a set of emerging technologies, which we call the Essential Eight. Since then, they have moved from the lab into boardrooms and living rooms, offices and schools, storefronts and manufacturing facilities.\n\nSeveral of the Essential Eight stand apart. AI, helped by GenAI’s extraordinary scalability, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are used at scale at many companies today. Other emerging tech (virtual reality, augmented reality, advanced robotics and blockchain) can deliver significant value but may have been back-burnered or are serving limited use cases. Still other technologies (quantum computing and neuromorphic computing, of which neural interfaces are a subset) are promising but several years away from major business relevance. Our data shows that investments reflect this reality, with AI (including GenAI) topping the list. In fact, 55% of respondents say their company invested in AI — it was a top-3 investment priority — in the last 12 months, more than any other technology listed.\n\nWhile AI is the clear leader, each of these technologies is gaining traction. A majority of executives who responded, (89%) tell us their companies are increasing their overall technology budget, which may be used to fund emerging tech initiatives. For example, 37% of executives whose companies are adopting GenAI in the next 12 months say they’re funding it through a net increase in their tech budget. When it comes to human resources, 28% of respondents report that at least one fifth of their workforce is involved in emerging tech as part of their primary job function. Yet, even as most companies are investing in emerging technologies, the EmTech Accelerators do so differently.\n\n1. Think big: Use emerging tech for reinvention\n\nFor EmTech Accelerators, the technologies are primarily about transforming business models and market expansion. Given how fast these technologies are advancing, these companies often look outside their industry for use cases to adopt and then adapt to create new customer experiences, differentiated employee experiences, and growth strategies for their specific marketplaces and lines of business.\n\nIn the past, a measured approach to emerging tech has often seemed wisest. Today, many of these technologies are already too valuable to treat as isolated experiments or pilots. The time has come to see what works to deliver the outcomes you seek, then roll out applications at scale. And — to take a lesson from the EmTech Accelerators — it can be advantageous not just to aim for operational efficiencies. Aim for new operations.\n\n2. Commit to it: Allocate the right resources\n\nEmTech Accelerators are far more likely than others in our survey to invest more financial and human capital in emerging technologies — and they’re doing so shrewdly. Their people investments, for example, often emphasize upskilling to build trust among internal stakeholders. Many are also working to instill a culture of innovation. EmTech Accelerators are also more likely to say it’s very important for their workforce to be adaptable and flexible (76% versus 57%) and to have collaborative skills (79% versus 55%).\n\nFlexibility and collaboration are especially important, since value from emerging technologies often comes from new sources. Throughout your company, employees without technical backgrounds may discover new applications. Business leads and technologists working together may come up with new solutions. Perhaps because emerging tech opportunities for sustainability are growing, EmTech Accelerators are also more likely (65% versus 44%) to deem green skills very important.\n\n3. Think convergence: Integrate your emerging tech\n\nEmerging technologies play well together. IoT sensors, for example, produce data, which AI can gather and analyze for predictive maintenance, workplace safety, customer engagement and other uses. Blockchain and digital assets can not only help transfer value securely, but also engage customers and improve business processes — with the help of AI. Quantum and neuromorphic computing may soon provide exponentially greater computing power, which will help enhance everything from extended reality (XR), which encompasses both AR and VR environments, to GenAI personal assistants.\n\nOver four fifths of EmTech Accelerators understand this integration imperative. This integration may be helping them implement more of the Essential Eight technologies across more parts of the business, especially because of data. The more that these technologies work together, the more data you can gather and use. This data can lead to better-performing tech and better-supported decisions for greater ROI today and possibly even more valuable implementations tomorrow.\n\n4. Drive integration: Embed emerging tech into your business strategy\n\nOnly when emerging technologies are part of your business strategy can they fulfill their full potential. On their own, your technologists may not know or understand the products, services and experiences that your customers and employees need and desire. It’s your business and functional leads who have this information. When business leads and technologists collaborate — and align with existing tech systems and other transformation initiatives — they can transform both customer-facing and internal operations.\n\nBusiness leads should work together to assess the company’s strategic goals. They can then work with technologists on a plan for how emerging tech, in conjunction with cloud and other technologies, can help meet these goals. These collaborations will be helpful as you continue to implement emerging technologies. They can help create value, accountability and trust. Key stakeholders will be more likely to trust that your tech initiatives will deliver valuable benefits if they were part of design and implementation."
