        "text": "Transform banking into the digital age\n\nImagine your funds safeguarded with AI-based fraud protections, control over what personal data your bank stores and how it’s used and cash brought right to your door. Welcome to the branchless bank.\n\nFinancial services firms face increasing pressure to modernize in order to meet consumer demand for digital services—but most grapple with the complex regulatory and privacy issues surrounding such changes. How can banks offer a superior experience and adapt to evolving regulation?\n\nHyper-personalize experiences: Tailor financial planning based on customer behaviors and buying trends regardless of channel, while helping to create a seamless flow of data between digital and physical channels.\n\nProtect customer data: Provide greater security with AI-driven fraud protection across products and strengthen privacy by giving customers control over how their data is stored and used.\n\nInnovate with branchless banks: Serve customers wherever they are with to-the-door cash delivery and notary services, fully digital loan processing and secure account onboarding from any location.\n\nCreate personalized care through better insights\n\nImagine doctors able to perform surgery with robotic assistance, care teams with instant access to worldwide datasets for patient diagnosis and remote experts able to assist with complex procedures through virtual reality. The new approach to healthcare is here.\n\nToday’s healthcare consumers expect easier access to their care team, efficient processes and increased collaboration between payors and providers. How can you deliver the highest quality healthcare at scale?\n\nPersonalize patient care: Use enhanced telehealth, VR immersive treatments and timely mobile messaging to help provide a 360-degree view of patient preferences and data.\n\nUnify care teams: Leverage insights and patient data to help improve care team collaboration and inform treatment decisions that can meet regulatory and compliance requirements.\n\nDeliver the future of care: Offer next-generation outpatient and in-hospital treatment experiences through the convergence of virtual reality, robotics and patient data analysis.\n\nEvolve for the future with smart factories\n\nImagine real-time visibility into your entire supply chain, automated, robotic response to changing demand and the ability to model new products and line changes without risk.\n\nManufacturers face a constantly shifting landscape–rapidly changing consumer preferences, supply chain challenges and the push for net zero. How can manufacturing companies remain nimble?\n\nBuild an agile factory: Get a digital view of your factory for real-time insights into operational efficiency, worker productivity and customer satisfaction for improved decision-making.\n\nCreate a resilient supply chain: Gain greater visibility across each function of your supply chain with automated intelligence and tracking of parts, delays and shipments to respond efficiently to unforeseen changes.\n\nInnovate digitally: Simulate new product designs and changes on the production line to model opportunities, identify risks and forecast which scenarios will deliver the greatest ROI.\n\nCreate lasting impressions with smart venues\n\nImagine curated merchandise sent right to your seat, app updates on the shortest concession lines and an enormous, mixed-reality team mascot racing on the field. This is the future with connected technology.\n\nSports fans are returning to stadiums, but are no longer satisfied with just “watching the game.” Teams and venues must compete for their spending and attention. How can smart stadiums reimagine the fan experience?\n\nUpgrade operations: Use data and IoT sensors to help make the fan experience as seamless and safe as possible.\n\nEnhance experience: Teams can now use customer preference data to help build loyalty and deliver unique physical, digital and virtual experiences that fans will always remember.\n\nBoost facilities: Reduce carbon emissions, use less energy, recycle waste and align with fans who believe sports should be doing more to act sustainably.\n\nReimagine the shopping experience\n\nPicture smart shopping carts guiding you to products based on your preferences, greener delivery options and automatic payments, so you don’t need to checkout. Shop in the store of the future, today.\n\nTo remain competitive in today’s highly fragmented market, retailers should offer a stellar in-store experience that also dovetails intelligently with customers’ online brand engagement. How can businesses transform the shopping journey?\n\nDigitize the store: See how customers move through your physical space while monitoring inventory and transactions—allowing you to provide tailored recommendations that will help drive sales.\n\nEmpower employees: Advance service and sales by decreasing employee time spent on manual tasks and delivering actionable customer insights to store staff in real-time.\n\nWin customer loyalty: Provide a curated, frictionless shopping and delivery experience that aligns with your customers’ values, which keeps you top of mind for their next purchase."
