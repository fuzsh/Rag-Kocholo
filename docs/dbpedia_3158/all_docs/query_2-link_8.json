        "text": "From smart cities and cars to smart stethoscopes and dog collars, Internet of Things (IoT) examples are becoming more commonplace every day.\n\nFormer Google and Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt made this bold IoT prediction during a panel at the World Economic Forum back in 2015: “[T]he Internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses, so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with, that you won’t even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time.”\n\nWe’re not there yet, but we could be soon. With the number of connected devices expected to reach 27 billion by 2025, consumers will undoubtedly encounter IoT devices. To help understand how IoT works and how connected we really are, let’s take a look at real-life Internet of Things examples and the companies behind them.\n\nConnected Cars and IoT\n\n1. Audi’s connect® System\n\nAudi drivers can choose from a slate of Audi connect® plans, which offer various connectivity features for Audi vehicles. With this IoT system, drivers can receive their EV’s charging status, control a vehicle’s interior temperature and review data on their driving behavior — all from their phone. Audi has doubled down on connectivity by forming a partnership with Cisco to keep its connected vehicles secure.\n\n2. IoT Fleet Tracking from Zubie\n\nZubie offers real-time GPS for rent and business fleet tracking while monitoring vehicle health and driver performance. If a driver is in the habit of braking hard or accelerating rapidly, that information can be used to track maintenance and avoid potential accidents as well as increase fuel efficiency.\n\n3. Tesla’s Connectivity Service\n\nWhile Tesla is known for making strides in the electric vehicle market, connectivity plays a big part in Tesla’s cars too. All cars come with connectivity features that provide access to features through Wi-Fi only, in addition to basic maps, navigation and music streaming. Users can purchase Tesla’s Premium Connectivity to access all connectivity features through cellular data as well as Wi-Fi.\n\nTesla also gives drivers the option to connect to their vehicle through the Tesla app, which can access the vehicle’s charging history and climate controls and be used to schedule service and roadside assistance.\n\nRead More on IoTIoT in Education: 10 Connected Classroom Examples\n\nSmart Home Appliances and IoT\n\n4.
