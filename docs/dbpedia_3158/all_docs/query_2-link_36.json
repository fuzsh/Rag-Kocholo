        "text": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL) manages the SAVER Program to assist emergency responders in making procurement decisions. Since its inception in 2004, the SAVER Program has produced more than 1,100 publications. These publications—which include focus group, market survey and assessment reports, as well as technotes, application notes, handbooks, guides and other documents—are described in detail on the SAVER Document Descriptions page. They provide valuable information to assist responders and purchasers with procurement decisions.\n\nSAVER publications often contain a list and description of standards relevant to specific types of equipment. TheSAVER Guidance for Use of Standards When Selecting and Purchasing Responder Equipment explains how to make practical use of this information for procurement. It covers what standards are, why they are important, how to verify that standards are met, and how to include requirements for the use of standards in procurement efforts."
