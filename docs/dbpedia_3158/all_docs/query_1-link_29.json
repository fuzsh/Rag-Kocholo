        "text": "Smart Digital Assistants\n\nApplications for smart digital assistants such as Siri and Cortana can provide many benefits for users. Amazon Echo represents a trend toward a new breed of appliance-based personal assistants. Utah is planning to create applications that leverage these technologies. Learn More\n\nTransportation\n\nThe Utah Department of Transportation has developed IoT technologies as part of its overall strategy for Intelligent Transportation Systems as a way to improve traffic flows, reduce accidents, and create a more friendly transportation environment. The program developed a structure that will allow UDOT to actively manage, in real-time, its traffic signal systems which will help traffic flow as efficiently as possible along any given roadway corridor.\n\nSmart Buildings\n\nA smart building, like a smart home, is an intelligent space that optimizes efficiency, comfort, safety, and more by collecting and analyzing sensor data to help building managers visualize information and make fast and precise decisions. DTS will support DFCM and others as they work to implement smart building technologies.\n\nWater Systems\n\nThe critical nature of water in Utah has motivated state and local water managers, as well as federal partners to leverage a variety of smart, network-connected technologies to improve how we conserve and distribute this valuable resource.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThere are numerous IoT technologies that will improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare. Utah state government is already a user of many connected health systems in its clinics and healthcare facilities. There will also be a regulatory function. The Utah Education and Telehealth Network provides connectivity to many remote healthcare services.\n\nIoT and Mobility\n\nToday's smartphones, tablets, and other smart wearable devices provide the user with a growing array of useful services. For example, ontime.utah.gov provides the user with real-time information about nearby bus stops, Trax and Frontrunner schedules, etc. based on location information. Utah.gov provides the same user with information about public meetings in the local area or nearby parks, schools and government offices, as well as job opportunities.\n\nClimate\n\nA variety of IoT technologies have been deployed in Utah with the potential of having a positive impact on climate change. These include air sensor networks, smart transportation systems including coordinated traffic signals, smart electric power grid technology, and smart irrigation systems.\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring\n\nSensor networks are helping the state of Utah improve the way we interact with the environment. For example, the iUtah network provides resources and data to explain how factors such as population growth, climatic variability, land use change, and human behavior affect the sustainability of our water resources. Connected air monitoring stations collect and report air quality data 24/7. This data is invaluable in helping assure cleaner air, water, and the earth around us.\n\nPublic Safety\n\nUtah's law enforcement agencies leverage connected technologies to save lives and improve public safety. Officers are equipped with body and vehicle cameras. A media server is being built to create interoperability amongst different systems for state and local jurisdictions.\n\nConnected Drones, Vehicles, and Robotics\n\nUtah state government uses drones or unmanned aerial systems (UAVs) for a variety of functions such as emergency management, search and rescue, natural resource management, precision agriculture, and tracking of invasive plant species. The UAV data can be fed to state data engines for real-time or delayed processing.\n\nStatewide GPS Network\n\nTURN GPS is a statewide network of permanently located GPS receivers supported by the Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC) in the Department of Technology Services. Through partnerships between Cities, Counties, State, and Private Companies, the network generates real time high accuracy GPS positioning. TURN GPS is used for a range of precision GPS applications including surveying, engineering, construction, and GIS data collection.\n\nUSTAR RIoT Program\n\nThe USTAR RIoT program supports economic development across the state through acceleration of technologies in Robotics and IoT industries. RIoT also schedules meetups and industry events to connect innovators, scientists, engineers, investors and business professionals around the Internet of Things."
