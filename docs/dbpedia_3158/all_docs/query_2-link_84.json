        "text": "NVIDIA is the Engine of AI\n\nNVIDIA engineers the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. We build new AI services that help companies create their own AI factories.\n\nReinventing Modern Graphics\n\nNVIDIA RTX™ taps into AI and ray tracing to deliver a whole new level of realism in graphics. This year, we introduced the next breakthrough in AI-powered graphics: DLSS 3.\n\nConnecting Our Physical and Digital Worlds\n\nOmniverse, our platform for industrial digitalization, enables industries grounded in physical processes to become software-defined and connect large, highly skilled teams.\n\nDriving Automotive Growth\n\nGenerative AI and digitalization are reshaping the $3 trillion automotive industry, from design and engineering to manufacturing, autonomous driving, and customer experience. NVIDIA is at the epicenter of this industrial transformation.\n\nCredit: WPP, McLaren; Koenigsegg; BMW; Rimac\n\nSupercharging Healthcare\n\nWith NVIDIA, healthcare institutions can harness the power of AI and high-performance computing to define the future of medicine.\n\nAccelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing\n\nData centers are already about 1-2% of global electricity consumption and growing. This is not sustainable for operating budgets and our planet. Acceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and net zero.\n\nLike No Place You’ve Ever Worked\n\n“NVIDIA is reshaping the future of computing. We’ve built a culture where people can do their life's work. We are a learning machine. The mission is boss. Everyone has a voice.” — Jensen Huang\n\nSee Careers"
