        "text": "Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0, which encompasses IIoT and smart manufacturing, marries physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management. While every company and organization operating today is different, they all face a common challenge—the need for connectedness and access to real-time insights across processes, partners, products, and people.\n\nThat’s where Industry 4.0 comes into play.\n\nIndustry 4.0 isn’t just about investing in new technology and tools to improve manufacturing efficiency—it’s about revolutionizing the way your entire business operates and grows. This resource will provide you with an in-depth overview on the topic of Industry 4.0 and IIoT, including information on the following:\n\nThe Evolution of Industry from 1.0 to 4.0\n\nBasic IIoT Concepts and Glossary of Terms\n\nSmart Manufacturing Use Cases\n\nWhom is Industry 4.0 For?\n\nBenefits of Adopting an Industry 4.0 Model\n\nChallenges to Consider and Overcome\n\nHow Epicor Can Help Your Business\n\nThe world of manufacturing is changing. To survive and thrive now, you have to be willing to invest in Industry 4.0. This resource will help you get started.\n\nInternet of Things\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of computing devices, machines, and objects or people that are interconnected. Data can automatically be transferred over a network.\n\nSome examples of IoT in action include wearable smart devices, connected cars, smart cities (i.e., pollution or traffic being monitored with smart technology), smart homes, and smart appliances. Through IoT technology, we are more responsive and more efficient with our resources, and identifying areas for improvement. (No one is home during these hours, so the smart thermostat should adjust the temperature to reduce heating costs.)\n\nIn manufacturing, the IoT is used to create smart factories that are more efficient and productive with sensors and devices to gather data, optimize processes, and identify and offset potential problems.\n\nIn terms of energy consumption, IoT can be used to create smart grids that help us reduce and improve our energy usage.\n\nBeyond manufacturing, IoT has the potential to revolutionize other industries (i.e. distribution, retail, healthcare) and it will continue to become better at understanding our needs and being more adaptive to them.\n\nIndustry 4.0 or Internet 4.0?\n\nIndustry 4.0 and Internet 4.0 are often used interchangeably, but they don't mean the same thing.\n\nIndustry 4.0 references the fourth industrial revolution, the 21st-century digital transformation underway now. It's characterized by the use of automation, advanced data analytics, and smart and autonomous systems.\n\nInternet 4.0, by contrast, refers to the next generation of the Internet, with faster speeds, more connectivity, smart machines, and more immersive experiences.\n\nInternet 4.0 is early in development but shows the potential to revolutionize healthcare, transportation, entertainment, and how we do business, including production, manufacturing, and distribution.\n\nHow Did We Get to Industry 4.0: Evolution of Industry from 1.0 to Present Day\n\nBefore digging too much deeper into the what, why, and how of Industry 4.0, it's beneficial to first understand how exactly manufacturing has evolved since the 1800s. There are four distinct industrial revolutions that the world either has experienced or continues to experience today.\n\nThe First Industrial Revolution\n\nThe first industrial revolution happened between the late 1700s and early 1800s. During this period of time, manufacturing evolved from focusing on manual labor performed by people (and animals) to a more optimized form of labor performed by people through the use of water, steam power, and other types of machine tools.\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the world entered a second industrial revolution with the introduction of steel and the use of electricity in factories. The introduction of electricity enabled manufacturers to increase efficiency and helped make factory machinery more mobile. It was during this phase that mass production concepts like the assembly line were introduced as a way to boost productivity.\n\nThe Third Industrial Revolution\n\nStarting in the late 1950s, a third industrial revolution slowly began to emerge, as manufacturers began incorporating more electronic—and eventually computer—technology into their factories. During this period, manufacturers began experiencing a shift that put less emphasis on analog and mechanical technology and more on digital technology and automation software.\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0\n\nIn the past few decades, a fourth industrial revolution has emerged, known as Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the emphasis on digital technology from recent decades to a whole new level with the help of interconnectivity through the Internet of Things (IoT), access to real-time data, and the introduction of cyber-physical systems.\n\nIndustry 4.0 offers a more comprehensive, interlinked, and holistic approach to manufacturing. It connects physical with digital and allows for better collaboration and access across departments, partners, vendors, products, and people. Industry 4.0 empowers business owners to better control and understand every aspect of their operation, and allows them to leverage instant data to boost productivity, improve processes, and drive growth.\n\nBasic IIoT Concepts and Glossary of Terms\n\nThere are hundreds of concepts and terms that relate to IIoT and Industry 4.0, but here are 12 foundational words and phrases to know before you decide whether you want to invest in Industry 4.0 solutions for your business:\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP): Business process management tools that can be used to manage information across an organization.\n\nIoT: IoT stands for Internet of Things, a concept that refers to connections between physical objects like sensors or machines and the Internet.\n\nIIoT: IIoT stands for the Industrial Internet of Things, a concept that refers to the connections between people, data, and machines as they relate to manufacturing.\n\nBig data: Big data refers to large sets of structured or unstructured data that can be compiled, stored, organized, and analyzed to reveal patterns, trends, associations, and opportunities.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI): Artificial intelligence is a concept that refers to a computer’s ability to perform tasks and make decisions that would historically require some level of human intelligence.\n\nM2M: This stands for machine-to-machine, and refers to the communication that happens between two separate machines through wireless or wired networks.\n\nDigitization: Digitization refers to the process of collecting and converting different types of information into a digital format.\n\nSmart factory: A smart factory is one that invests in and leverages Industry 4.0 technology, solutions, and approaches.\n\nMachine learning: Machine learning refers to the ability that computers have to learn and improve on their own through artificial intelligence—without being explicitly told or programmed to do so.\n\nCloud computing: Cloud computing refers to the practice of using interconnected remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process information.\n\nReal-time data processing: Real-time data processing refers to the abilities of computer systems and machines to continuously and automatically process data and provide real-time or near-time outputs and insights.\n\nEcosystem: An ecosystem, in terms of manufacturing, refers to the potential connectedness of your entire operation—inventory and planning, financials, customer relationships, supply chain management, and manufacturing execution.\n\nCyber-physical systems (CPS): Cyber-physical systems, also sometimes known as cyber manufacturing, refers to an Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing environment that offers real-time data collection, analysis, and transparency across every aspect of a manufacturing operation.\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of some of the core concepts related to Industry 4.0, you’re ready to dig deeper into how smart manufacturing can revolutionize the way you run and grow your business.\n\nWhat are Cyber-Physical Systems?\n\nCyber-physical systems merge together physical systems and cyber systems, just as the term implies. This means using machine learning, AI, and computational elements to enhance real-world physical processes.\n\nSome examples of cyber-physical systems include:\n\nAutonomous vehicles\n\nSmart grids\n\nSmart cities\n\nSmart manufacturing\n\nThese cyber-physical production systems continually take in and analyze data around, and then optimize driving, energy delivery, and other physical processes.\n\nThese are just a few use cases. Cyber product systems are revolutionizing our world. The National Science Foundation, a U.S. government agency, believes these systems can solve our nation's most pressing issues when it comes to healthcare, transportation, energy, sustainability, and the environment.\n\nSmart Manufacturing Use Cases\n\nOne of the best ways to understand the concept of smart manufacturing is to think about how it could be applied to your business, or a business similar to your business. Here are three use cases that can help you understand the value of Industry 4.0 in a manufacturing operation:\n\nSupply chain management and optimization\n\nPredictive maintenance/analytics\n\nAsset tracking and optimization\n\nWe'll go into each of these three areas in more detail.\n\nSupply chain management and optimization\n\nIndustry 4.0 solutions give businesses greater insight, control, and data visibility across their entire supply chain. By leveraging supply chain management capabilities, companies can deliver products and services to market faster, cheaper, and with better quality to gain an advantage over less-efficient competitors.\n\nPredictive maintenance/analytics\n\nIndustry 4.0 solutions give manufacturers the ability to predict when potential problems are going to arise before they actually happen.\n\nWithout IoT systems at your factory, preventive maintenance happens based on routine or time. In other words, it's a manual task.\n\nWith IoT systems in place, preventive maintenance is much more automated and streamlined. Systems can sense when problems are arising or machinery needs to be fixed and can empower you to solve potential issues before they become bigger problems.\n\nPredictive analytics allows companies to not just ask reactive questions like, “What has happened?” or “Why did it happen?” but also proactive questions like, “What is going to happen?” and, “What can we do to prevent it from happening?”\n\nThese types of analytics can enable manufacturers to pivot from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance.\n\nAsset tracking and optimization\n\nIoT technology can be used to track inventory and equipment, monitoring their location and movement. IoT technology provides continual, real-time data about the condition of these assets, flagging needed maintenance and repairs to minimize production downtime and optimize production outputs.\n\nWho Is Industry 4.0 Right For?\n\nHow do you know when or if your business should invest in Industry 4.0?\n\nIf you’re able to check off most of the items on this list, it’s probably safe to start evaluating Industry 4.0 technology and solution providers and allocating the resources needed for deployment:\n\nYou’re in a particularly competitive industry with a lot of tech-savvy players\n\nYou’re having a hard time recruiting to fill vacant jobs at your organization\n\nYou want better visibility across your supply chain\n\nYou want to identify and address issues before they become bigger problems\n\nYou want to boost efficiency and profitability across your entire organization\n\nYou want everyone on your team to have informed, up-to-date, relevant views of production and business processes\n\nYou want richer and more timely analytics\n\nYou need help digitizing and making sense of information\n\nYou want to improve customer satisfaction and customer experience\n\nYou want to improve product quality or keep product quality intact\n\nYou want a more integrated enterprise resource planning system that spans not only inventory and planning, but also financials, customer relationships, supply chain management, and manufacturing execution\n\nYou want a consistent and flexible view of production and business operations tailored to specific areas or users in your organization\n\nYou want real-time insights that help you make better, faster decisions about your business each day\n\nStill not sure if Industry 4.0 is right for you? Keep reading to learn about some specific ways it can help you and your business.\n\nBenefits of Adopting an Industry 4.0 Model\n\nIndustry 4.0 spans the entire product life cycle and supply chain— design, sales, inventory, scheduling, quality, engineering, and customer and field service. Everyone shares informed, up-to-date, relevant views of production and business processes—and much richer and more timely analytics.\n\nHere is a quick, non-exhaustive list of some of the benefits of adopting an Industry 4.0 model for your business:\n\nIt makes you more competitive, especially against disruptors like Amazon. As companies like Amazon continue to optimize logistics and supply chain management, you need to be investing in technology and solutions that help you improve and optimize your own operation. To stay competitive, you have to have the systems and processes in place to allow you to provide the same level of service (or better) to your customers and clients that they could be getting from a company like Amazon.\n\nIt makes you more attractive to the younger workforce. Companies that invest in modern, innovative Industry 4.0 technologies are better positioned to attract and retain new workers.\n\nIt makes your team stronger and more collaborative. Companies that invest in Industry 4.0 solutions can increase efficiency, boost collaboration between departments, enable predictive and prescriptive analytics, and allow people including operators, managers, and executives to more fully leverage real-time data and intelligence to make better decisions while managing their day-to-day responsibilities.\n\nIt allows you to address potential issues before they become big problems. Predictive analytics, real-time data, internet-connected machinery, and automation can all help you be more proactive when it comes to addressing and solving potential maintenance and supply chain management issues.\n\nIt allows you to trim costs, boost profits, and fuel growth. Industry 4.0 technology helps you manage and optimize all aspects of your manufacturing processes and supply chain. It gives you access to the real-time data and insights you need to make smarter, faster decisions about your business, which can ultimately boost the efficiency and profitability of your entire operation.\n\nAs mentioned, this list is not exhaustive—there are many more benefits to consider. To read about more benefits, explore our manufacturing software page.\n\nChallenges to Consider and Overcome\n\nAs you consider whether or not to invest in Industry 4.0, you may be thinking about some of the potential challenges associated with incorporating new technology and processes into your organization. You’re not alone. Here are some of the most common questions that most business owners think about when it comes to smart manufacturing:\n\nQuestion #1: Will our business data and customer information be safe?\n\nAs the threat of cyber-hacking continues to intensify each year, many businesses are worried that investing in cloud-based technology and moving data out from behind their own walls will leave their businesses and data vulnerable to attackers. Epicor keeps information safe and secure by leveraging deep security expertise and deploying stringent cyber-security measures for all customers that invest in Industry 4.0 technology.\n\nQuestion #2: Will I be able to get support from my team?\n\nThe short answer to this question is yes. While implementing new technology and a new business model can be hard for some people to accept and adopt, you can ultimately get support from your team by clearly setting expectations up front, stating the purpose and benefits of investing in Industry 4.0 technology, and being open and transparent with your team throughout the entire implementation process.\n\nQuestion #3: Do we have the resources and staff to implement and manage this technology?\n\nWhen you invest in cloud-based technology, you don’t have to rely so heavily on your IT team to manage and maintain systems. Instead, you benefit from regular updates and maintenance performed by the service provider. For example, to avoid the ongoing implementation and upgrade challenges ERP has historically presented, some companies are choosing cloud-based ERP or software as a service (SaaS). As with cloud storage, the cloud ERP provider assumes the costs otherwise borne by IT to build and maintain infrastructure. A cloud-based ERP system provides all of the benefits of ERP without requiring dedicated IT infrastructure or staff, and frees those resources to be used in other IT tasks.\n\nQuestion #4: Will I know how to leverage data to make more informed decisions?\n\nYes! Epicor can provide you the knowledge, training, and documentation you need to understand how to use data to change, improve, and grow your business.\n\nHow Epicor Can Help Your Business\n\nEpicor can help you implement Industry 4.0 technology into your manufacturing business.
