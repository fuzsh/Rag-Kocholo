        "text": "Digital Twin\n\nGeospatial digital twins provide unparalleled context and high-resolution data integration for better business decisions\n\nWhat is a digital twin?\n\nMirroring the real world with GIS\n\nA digital twin is a virtual representation of reality, including physical objects, processes, and relationships. When built on a foundation of geography, it becomes a geospatial digital twin.\n\nGeospatial\n\nAccurate representations of complex systems require robust maps and spatial analytics from geographic information system (GIS) technology.\n\nTime aware\n\nGIS-based digital twins go beyond 3D models as they reflect change over time—showing historic, current, and future states.\n\nScalable\n\nFrom single facilities to large built and natural systems, geospatial digital twins scale to meet changing needs.\n\nCreating a living replica\n\nA digital twin of Boston integrates vast datasets—from zoning and transportation to public safety—to give decision-makers one view of real-time conditions and potential scenarios.\n\nWho uses geospatial digital twins?\n\nForward-looking organizations around the world advance planning, operations, network management, environmental, design, and construction work with Esri’s trusted GIS technology. Learn more in the geospatial digital twin ebook.\n\nCross River Rail\n\nVodafone\n\nPrague\n\nCisco\n\nThe Nature Conservancy\n\nDesign and construction\n\nCross River Rail Delivery Authority\n\nIn Brisbane, Australia’s fastest growing city, Cross River Rail used a sophisticated digital twin to build the city’s first underground railway. Visualizing existing infrastructure above and below ground minimized disruptions and a virtual reality tool allowed the team to tour designs.\n\nNetwork management\n\nVodafone\n\nThe high-resolution digital twin for Britain—representing 245,000 square kilometers—provides an immersive 3D experience. Anyone at the carrier can view infrastructure, customers, and the invisible signals the company creates and sells to strengthen signals and customer satisfaction.\n\nPlanning\n\nPrague Institute of Planning and Development\n\nA digital twin helps planners and designers strike the right balance of development, climate change mitigation, and historic preservation to ensure a high quality of life for residents.\n\nOperations\n\nCisco\n\nTo serve its customers in more than 130 countries, Cisco created a digital twin that connects logistics, field services, planning, order management, and sales support. The GIS-based simulation provides near-real-time awareness and enables an efficient supply chain.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nPoint Conception and The Nature Conservancy\n\nCapturing archaeology, wildlife, and vegetation details in a geospatial digital twin reveals conditions such as high-water flow events, key relationships in critical habitats, and the best ways to protect one of the United States’ most biodiverse places.\n\nEsri is at the forefront of digital twin technology\n\nLeading the way in developing innovative solutions\n\nEsri is a committed member of the Digital Twin Consortium, an authoritative association that drives the adoption of digital twin technology. By participating in the consortium's initiatives, Esri advances digital twin capabilities and fosters collaboration among industry leaders.\n\nGain exceptional clarity\n\nExplore an unmatched holistic view of assets, operations, and possibilities with a real-time integrated digital twin.\n\nVisualize comprehensive data\n\nDynamic, interactive visualizations unite vast amounts of data from sources including business systems, sensors, and information models.\n\nSimulate and predict outcomes\n\nComprehensive models show how plans and ideas would impact places, people, and the bottom line in a risk-free, virtual environment.\n\nMake complex systems easier to understand\n\nOne view shows infrastructure, assets, and movement to streamline workflows and decision-making.\n\nRich visualizations speed understanding\n\nViewing above- and below-ground infrastructure with a digital twin provides an intuitive way to understand projects, such as the Grand Paris Express, throughout its lifecycle.\n\nThe power of data—amplified\n\nUnite diverse datasets, gain spatial context, and build a mature digital twin with the robust capabilities in Esri enterprise GIS technology.\n\nAdvanced data integration\n\nConnect proprietary data and add layers such as terrain, demographics, and climate risk to deeply understand relationships and outcomes.\n\nDynamic modeling\n\nUse interactive models built with precise location data and other essential inputs such as building information to answer critical questions.\n\nImmersive environment\n\nBring buildings and cities alive. Transport stakeholders to a site with game-like 3D models that transform collaboration and problem-solving.\n\nLayered models inform action\n\nUnderstanding the relationships among disparate data—such as noise, solar radiation, and building information modeling (BIM)—generates new insights on sustainability in Sweden."
