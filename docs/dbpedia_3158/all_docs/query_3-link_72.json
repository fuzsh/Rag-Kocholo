        "text": "“Microsoft and Samsung share a long history of innovation and collaboration, and today’s announcements mark the next stage in our partnership,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. “Our ambition is to help people be more productive on any device, anywhere – and the combination of our intelligent experiences with Samsung’s powerful, new devices makes this a reality.”\n\nIntroducing Seamless Productivity Across Devices\n\nConsumers live and work across multiple devices, and the need for better and easier connectivity is clear. Today’s cross-device experience can be fragmented—users on a PC have to interrupt their flow to look over at their phone, open an app to then send images, videos or files to their PC. Instead, they want a world in which their content syncs automatically, so they can start a project in one place on one device, and pick it up on another, without distractions.\n\nAs mobile-first users make up a larger share of the workforce, the demand for more seamless connectivity will only increase. According to the analyst firm CCS Insight[1], 42% of employees spend more than three hours a day working on a mobile device, which is even higher for millennial employees at 51%. This partnership enables users to now have a unified experience across multiple devices wherever they are.\n\nSamsung and Microsoft are also bridging the gap between mobility and performance with the new Samsung Galaxy Book S, which offers an always-connected solution that brings the smartphone experience to a laptop. The Galaxy Book S has built-in LTE connectivity, a powerhouse battery life and an ultra-slim, lightweight design to usher in a new mobile computing experience.\n\nBuilding on an Established, Successful Relationship\n\nSamsung and Microsoft have had a long-standing partnership focused on making computing more productive and powerful. Starting with Galaxy Note10, Microsoft’s most popular productivity solutions for smartphones will be seamlessly integrated into Galaxy products and services:\n\nEnhanced Outlook Experience: The preferred mobile email and calendar solution on more than 100 million devices, Outlook helps customers connect, organize and get things done. Outlook brings email, calendar[1], contacts and files together, all in one app – helping you save time and focus on what matters. Galaxy Note10 features an optimized and integrated Outlook app, which enhances work and personal communications as well as time management. The enhanced S Pen with the Galaxy Note10 allows users to get short previews when hovering over emails, calendar events and contacts.\n\nOneDrive Cloud Storage: Beginning this fall, Samsung Gallery offers the option to sync with Microsoft OneDrive services — so users can access their photos and videos from across their devices[2], and don’t have to worry about whether they recently backed them up.\n\nSeamlessly Flow Between PC and Mobile: Link to Windows is built into the Galaxy Note10’s Quick Panel, so it’s simple and convenient to send messages, manage notifications, sync photos and mirror your phone[3] on users’ PCs[4]. This continuity of services will create a critical connection with any Windows 10 PC saving users the extra time and trouble of physically switching between their Galaxy Note10[5] and PC.\n\nIndustry-Leading Productivity for Business\n\nWith the Galaxy Note10, Samsung and Microsoft will also commit to empower businesses to be even more productive. This partnership will offer enterprise users improved remote access to their enterprise workspace, including the full suite of Office applications.\n\nA Commitment to Ongoing Collaboration\n\nSamsung believes an open and collaborative approach will set the new standard for meaningful innovations that prioritize quality, security and experience. This approach is crucial in breaking down technology barriers and creating opportunities for consumers. Samsung has consistently demonstrated this belief through a long history of open collaboration with other industry leaders. In the years to come, as cloud computing and advanced intelligence progress and network speeds rapidly increase, the partnership between Samsung and Microsoft will only become more important. Together, Samsung and Microsoft will pioneer new technologies and deliver the innovations that will transform the way users work.\n\n[1] “CCS Insight: Employee Workplace Technology Survey, 2019” (www.ccsinsight.com)\n\n[2] Full integration with two-way sync of Outlook calendar and Samsung calendar app functionality is expected later in 2019.\n\n[3] OneDrive files may be made available for offline use. Otherwise internet access required. Fees may apply.\n\n[4] Phone screen mirroring requires a Windows 10 PC running the May 2019 Update (1903). Galaxy Note10 and the PC must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n[5] Users must link their mobile phone to their PC through ‘Link to Windows’ on their mobile phone where available, or through ‘Your Phone app’ on their PC. Your Phone app comes preinstalled on PCs with the Windows 10 October 2018 Update or later, and is downloadable for Windows 10 April 2018 Update or later versions. Requires a Microsoft Account and an Android 7.0+ phone.\n\n[6] For Windows 10 Version 1803 or later and Android 7.0 (Nougat) or later."
