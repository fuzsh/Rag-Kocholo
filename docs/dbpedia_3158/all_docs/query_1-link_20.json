        "text": "Smart city technology solutions\n\nWhen governments embark on a smart city project, they often invest in a combination of intelligent digital solutions. These smart city technologies are designed to work together to connect the community, enhance the lives of city residents, drive sustainability efforts, improve infrastructure, and support economic growth.\n\nHere are a few examples of innovative smart city solutions:\n\nCloud computing\n\nCloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, networking, databases, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet, as opposed to a local server or personal computer.\n\nBecause this technology offers a lower price tag and easier access, cloud solutions have become increasingly popular for consumers, businesses, and governments. Plus, organizations typically only pay for the cloud services they use. This helps businesses and city governments control operating costs and scale cloud solutions as they grow.\n\nMany city agencies are migrating their applications, workforce systems, and other critical government information from local storage to the cloud to accelerate innovation, increase efficiency, and cut costs. This allows governments to be more agile and resilient while helping to protect sensitive personal data. Cloud solutions also allow city staff and residents to securely access information remotely—which is essential for the continuity of government services.\n\nCloud computing has become an essential smart city technology because these solutions allow governments to:\n\nReduce costs since they don’t have to invest in hardware and software, set up and run on-site data centers, or manage the infrastructure.\n\nScale as they grow and deliver the right amount of IT resources when and where they’re needed.\n\nEnsure better performance through a worldwide network of fast, efficient, and secure datacenters.\n\nImprove security and protection of city data, apps, and infrastructure.\n\nWork faster and access vast amounts of computing resources within minutes.\n\nBoost productivity of city managers, employees, and IT teams.\n\nMaintain business continuity with easy data backup and disaster recovery.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of a computer system to mimic human-like cognitive functions, such as analyzing data, learning from new information, and solving problems. Using math and logic, the computer system simulates human reasoning to make informed decisions.\n\nAn artificially intelligent computer system can make predictions or take actions based on patterns in existing data. AI can learn from its mistakes to increase accuracy in the future. A mature AI system can process new information quickly and accurately, making it useful for complex scenarios, including self-driving cars, image recognition programs, and virtual assistants.\n\nCity governments are tapping into AI in coordination with other solutions like IoT, edge, and blockchain. AI enables these smart cities to improve interaction with the community, rapidly distribute information to the public, conserve energy and water, and power everything from smart buildings to smart streetlights to smart traffic.\n\nFor example, many smart cities now use AI chatbots to offer residents quick and accurate answers and information online. Additionally, some governments have invested in AI sensors to collect and analyze transportation data and streamline traffic flow. These predictive technologies are changing the way cities run and enhancing quality of life for urban residents.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an assortment of equipment, products, and devices that are connected to the cloud and designed to collect and securely transmit data. IoT allows organizations to quickly gather and use data to make fast, informed decisions. This technology for smart cities offers timely and relevant insights, allowing organizations across all industries to operate more efficiently and improve customer experiences.\n\nSmarter cities around the world are using IoT sensors to instantly capture and understand data. The insights provided by IoT give city managers a deeper understanding of what’s happening across their communities in near real time. This smart city technology also allows governments to connect intelligent infrastructure, monitor processes remotely, perform real-time tracking, and improve operations across the city.\n\nSmart city governments are increasingly using IoT for two important tasks—remote monitoring and predictive maintenance.\n\nRemote monitoring allows administrators to monitor assets, such as vehicles and heavy machinery, either continuously or at regular intervals. This allows city managers to track the asset’s location, performance, and condition. The insights city governments gain from this smart city technology can help them:\n\nDecrease fuel, maintenance, and service costs.\n\nRefine city government processes.\n\nProvide a better experience for the population.\n\nReduce wear and tear on vehicles and machinery.\n\nIncrease the number of service appointments per day.\n\nRoute vehicles more efficiently.\n\nImprove resident security and city employee safety.\n\nPredictive maintenance incorporates machine learning software to analyze data, predict outcomes, and automate operations. This technology allows city managers to identify and overcome issues before they become a major problem. Predictive maintenance helps smart city administrators:\n\nPinpoint mechanical or operational issues that are leading to failure or slowdowns.\n\nDetermine which spare parts to maintain in inventory for repair issues.\n\nPredict and prevent equipment failures before they occur.\n\nGovernments that invest in IoT can use this smart city solution to deliver greater value to the public, connect with people in a more personalized way, reduce materials and labor waste, and boost operational efficiency.\n\nBlockchain technology\n\nBlockchain is a decentralized, digital database with information that can be used and shared simultaneously within a large, publicly accessible network. Organizations and governments are investing in this innovative technology to create more efficient supply chains, simplify complex processes, reduce fraud, and quickly verify transactions.\n\nBlockchain allows network participants to share data reliably and transparently without a centralized administrator. This feature is particularly helpful for city governments. That’s because cities typically include a large number of stakeholders who need to securely exchange information to maintain operations, make critical decisions, and streamline services.\n\nSmart cities use blockchain solutions to:\n\nEasily and securely exchange data.\n\nEncourage cross-agency collaboration.\n\nGain a single view across city supply chains.\n\nReduce fraud and verify financial transactions faster.\n\nCreate smarter and more efficient supply chains.\n\nSimplify processes for reconciling data disputes in auditing and regulatory compliance.\n\nManage energy usage, urban development, and population growth.\n\nEdge computing\n\nEdge computing is the process of placing computing infrastructure closer to the actual data source. This reduces network latency (delays in data communication) and excessive bandwidth usage, while ensuring service continuity—even when cloud connections are intermittent.\n\nSmart cities around the world are using edge computing combined with IoT, AI, and cloud solutions to ensure continuity of critical government services and infrastructure.\n\nIn coordination with other technologies, edge computing solutions enable city governments to:\n\nAddress latency or connectivity issues by processing data close to the source.\n\nProcess, sort, and analyze IoT or datacenter data so they can determine what to act on immediately and what to store in the cloud.\n\nAnalyze data for quick, actionable insights using AI and machine learning.\n\nTransfer network data efficiently and easily between the cloud and the edge.\n\nRun applications at remote locations for faster transactions and less bandwidth constraints.\n\nMeet regulatory compliance by using machine learning models that help alert administrators to potentially sensitive data.\n\nFor example, London’s Heathrow Airport uses edge, AI, and machine learning combined with a 3D scanner to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking.\n\nAugmented reality (AR)\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is technology that creates a computer-generated image overlay onto a real-world setting, giving the user a composite view. Many organizations are using this interactive technology to train employees and provide workers with a clear view into areas they can’t easily reach or see.\n\nWith advanced AR solutions, users can accomplish a variety of tasks that would be far too difficult or dangerous without this smart technology. For example, some city workers use mobile devices that overlay an image of utilities and assets when looking underground. This enables workers to see where pipes are located under a street and determine their operating condition. King County in the Seattle area has been recognized for using a mixed reality device to train operators at a wastewater treatment plant.\n\nSmart city governments also tap into AR to:"
