        "text": "Smart consumers in Chicago will benefit from energy savings programs like the Retrofit Chicago Residential Partnership. Retrofit Chicago is helping homes and businesses achieve 20% energy efficiency improvements to help people save money and improve the environment. Retrofit programs will help families and businesses take advantage of their smart meter savings opportunities by further reducing energy waste. You can take advantage of free energy assessments, free installation of energy saving products, and connect to financing and other resources to help you complete an energy efficiency retrofit of your house or residential building.\n\nCall 844.922.1222 or visit Retrofit Chicago Residential Partnership website. After you sign up a Retrofit Chicago partner will contact you with resources to make your house or residential building more comfortable and affordable. Start saving energy and money today\n\nThrough the City of Chicago's Retrofit Chicago program, Mayor Emanuel identified energy efficiency as a priority for strengthening Chicago to make the city the most affordable, competitive, and sustainable city of the 21st century. Retrofit Chicago and Smart Grid support the City's environmental roadmap, Sustainable Chicago 2015, and its goals to improve citywide energy efficiency by 5 percent and to establish Chicago as a hub for the growing sustainable economy\n\nYou can create an online ComEd account to better manage your electricity use to save money on your electric bills. With a smart meter, you can view daily and hourly usage information, sign up for weekly usage reports and enroll to receive high- usage alerts when your usage is trending higher than usual.\n\nFor additional information and access to your electricity use data, you can use Green Button Download. Coming later in 2016, this tool will have additional features to give customers the ability to share their energy use data with third party vendors for additional management opportunities.\n\nCurrently ComEd offers Hourly Pricing and Peak Time Savings programs. Customers can enroll in both programs for additional savings.\n\nComEd’s Peak Time Savings Program allows you to earn a credit on your electric bill for voluntarily using less electricity during Peak Time Savings Hours. There’s no cost to enroll and no penalty if you don’t participate in any Peak Time Savings Hours. You can learn more and enroll in the program by visiting the Peak Time Savings Program website.\n\nHourly Pricing (formally known as Residential Real-Time Pricing or RRTP) lets customers pay the hourly, market price of electricity. For this program, the price you pay may vary from hour to hour based on wholesale market prices.\n\nParticipants have access to hourly prices of electricity, and will receive high price notifications and alerts in addition to other useful information. Individual cost savings are not guaranteed and will vary month to month based on weather, market conditions, and usage habits. However, the more participants avoid using electricity when hourly prices are high, the more they can potentially save with Hourly Pricing.\n\nSince the Hourly Pricing program began, participants have saved an average of more than 15% on electricity supply as compared with what they would have paid with ComEd's fixed price rate. By enrolling and simply lowering your use during high price times, you can start saving money. You do have to have a smart meter already installed or have another temporary meter installed that can measure hourly electricity usage. There is a small monthly fee of $0.39 on your utility bill to participate and you do have to enroll in the program for 12 consecutive months.\n\nYou can learn more and enroll in the program by visiting the Hourly Pricing Program website or calling 888.202.7787."
