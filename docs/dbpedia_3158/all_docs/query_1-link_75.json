        "text": "What Are SMART Goals for Managers?\n\nSMART goals for managers are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound objectives that guide the actions and performance of a unified team. These goals often drive forward the business and the individuals involved.\n\n“Leadership goals are different from individual goals because they focus on fostering a shared vision and direction for a group, as well as developing processes to ensure that this shared purpose is met,” explains Richard Nolan, the Chief People Officer of Epos Now. “Leadership goals should be focused on creating an atmosphere of collaboration and trust among members of the team so that everyone can work together efficiently and effectively.”\n\nUnlike OKRs, SMART goals focus on the path to achieving the goal instead of only the end result. Learn more about the difference between OKRs and SMART goals.\n\nHow to Set SMART Goals for Leaders\n\nTo set SMART goals for leaders, ensure they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Choose ones that help individuals drive the overall goals of the business.\n\nTo learn how to write SMART goals for leaders, follow the steps below:\n\nClarify Your Leadership Vision\n\nConsider the overall business and leadership goals you want to achieve. Identify the roadblocks preventing you from achieving them, and create a plan to address those roadblocks and help you incrementally achieve your larger business goals.\n\n“It’s important for leaders and managers to remember not only their end goal, but why they want to achieve it,” says Nolan. “Holding yourself accountable for understanding how your leadership will impact the organization as you set out toward achieving those objectives will help ensure success.”\n\nBreak Down Your Vision Into SMART Goals\n\nSMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound to make it easy to measure progress and ensure they can be met. “I recommend approaching competency and performance goals with precision planning. Break down your goal into subgoals you need to accomplish each week or month in order to achieve them by a certain deadline,” suggests Nolan.\n\nAssess the Impact of Each Goal\n\n“Leadership goals should be broad and overarching,” says Lilian Chen, the Co-Founder and COO of Bar None Games. Your goals should build on one another and focus on their overall impact on the business. Prioritize goals based on the changes required to make them. For best results, start small and build up to larger goals.\n\nMake Adjustments as Necessary\n\nIf a goal is not as achievable as initially set, consider changing it, altering the timeline, or breaking it down into smaller goals.\n\nCelebrate Successes\n\nAcknowledge and celebrate with your team when you achieve goals. Not only is it beneficial for morale, it can help motivate everyone to continue working toward larger, future goals.\n\nLeadership SMART Goal Examples\n\nSMART goals for leadership can include expanding the business presence and improving employee development and retention. They also involve aligning smaller team goals to larger company thresholds and making large-scale business processes more efficient.\n\nHere are six examples of SMART goals for leadership:\n\n1. Develop Internal Talent\n\nLeadership will implement a talent identification process and establish mentoring relationships for high-potential employees with the goal of increasing internal promotions by 20 percent in the next two years.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to identify employees with a potential for promotion, mentor them, and increase the number of internal promotions.\n\nMeasurable: Compare the current number of internal promotions with the total after you implement talent identification and mentorships.\n\nAchievable: The goal uses employee reviews to identify talent and encourages veteran employees to take on mentorship responsibilities.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because developing internal talent is more affordable and results in more engaged employees.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to two years.\n\n2. Develop a Growth Mindset\n\nBy the end of the year, the leader will engage in monthly learning activities, such as reading books on personal development or attending relevant conferences or events.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to develop a habit of learning that will contribute to a growth mindset.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable by keeping track of the books read and conferences or events attended.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable because many leadership and personal growth books are available for free from the library and the leader can choose to attend local and affordable events.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because leaders who set an example of the pursuit of personal knowledge and growth can demonstrate the benefit of thinking more broadly in both personal and professional situations.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to be achieved by the end of the year and occurs on a regular cadence.\n\n3. Improve Employee Onboarding\n\nBy the end of the quarter, the leader will improve the employee onboarding process by creating standardized materials and conducting feedback surveys at the end of the onboarding period.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to enhance the onboarding process for new employees and their trainers by standardizing the materials used and conducting feedback surveys to both trainers and incoming employees.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable by comparing the results of feedback surveys over time.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable with the help of HR personnel and by creating a centralized, accessible repository for new onboarding documents.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because current employees say they wish the onboarding process had been structured more thoughtfully.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the quarter.\n\n4. Create a Plan to Open an Additional Retail Branch\n\nBy the end of the year, the leader will have a plan in place to open an additional retail branch, including a detailed project plan for the entire process, buildout plans confirmed, a location under contract, and all required permits.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to put in all of the preliminary work to open a new retail location.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable by checking requirements off a list, including a project plan, a construction buildout plan, a location rental, and required permits.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable because it is within the scope of projects the company has undertaken in the past.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because leadership has identified a new, profitable market that is suitable for the business.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to complete planning by the end of the year.\n\nLearn how writing SMART project objectives can set you up for success.\n\n5. Reduce Ambiguity of Job Descriptions\n\nBy the end of the quarter, the leader will perform an audit of all existing job descriptions, requirements, and expectations, and update them to match the current state of those jobs as they exist in the company today.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to audit existing job descriptions, requirements, and expectations, and edit them to reflect the actual state of those jobs within the company.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable because progress can be tracked on a list of job titles within the company.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by setting aside time over the next quarter to perform an audit and update the copy.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because many roles have evolved over time and their descriptions and job titles no longer match the current work environment.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the quarter.\n\n6. Decrease the Time Spent in Meetings\n\nBy the end of the month, the leader will implement a standardized meeting agenda that the team can populate ahead of schedule to improve the efficiency of the time spent in meetings and decrease the team’s total meeting time by 10 percent each week.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to implement a standardized meeting agenda to use their time together more efficiently and decrease the overall time spent in meetings each week.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable by comparing the team’s total time spent in meetings per week before and after implementing the new agenda.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by customizing a meeting agenda template to suit the team’s needs.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because staff report they are spending too much time in meetings, reducing the time available to complete work.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the month.\n\nLeadership Development SMART Goals Examples\n\nSMART goals for leadership development might include focusing on building relationships, exploring mentorship opportunities, and learning to coach. They can also focus on ways to develop team members for their own leadership roles.\n\nHere are four examples of SMART goals for leadership development below:\n\n1. Be a Better Coach\n\nTo become a better coach by the end of the year, the leader can set a SMART goal of learning and practicing coaching techniques during monthly conversations with each team member.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to be a better coach by learning coaching techniques and applying them in team conversations.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable by adding a question related to coaching on employee feedback surveys and gathering those results.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable because many free online resources are available to learn to be a better coach.\n\nRelevant:\n\nThe goal is relevant because coaching is a valuable skill in leadership and employee development. “Having managers become coaches is effective, meaningful, and more fulfilling for their direct reports,” explains Dr. Liz Kofman-Burns, Ph.D. Sociologist and Co-founder at DEIB consultancy Peoplism.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the year, aligning with the next employee feedback survey.\n\n2. Share Your Own Experience\n\nThe leader will include a professional anecdote of a lesson they have learned in each quarterly company address to help future leaders identify areas in their lives that may be impactful to their prospects and help them grow.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to help future leaders identify areas in their experience that might be instrumental to their development by having senior leadership share anecdotes from their own professional lessons learned.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable by ensuring that each company address includes a professional lesson learned by an executive level leader.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by setting aside two to three minutes of each address to include this information.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because it can help promising employees identify areas of growth in their own professional lives and careers.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to each quarterly address.\n\n3. Start an Employee Mentorship Program\n\nBy the end of the year, leadership will implement an employee mentorship program in which seasoned staff can help more junior members of the team gain experience and grow within their roles.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to create a mentorship program that benefits both junior and senior members of the team to develop practical and leadership skills in their existing roles.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable due to tracking the number of mentors and mentees that sign up for the new initiative, as well as tracking their career progress over time.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable using a volunteer model or by offering an incentive for employees to participate.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because employees gaining knowledge and experience both in their roles and as mentors is good for morale and engagement.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the year.\n\n4. Focus on Building Relationships:\n\nLeadership will organize quarterly networking and social events to aid in building personal and professional relationships within the organization.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to encourage employees to build relationships with one another by participating in networking and social events.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measurable based on the events occurring each quarter.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by setting aside time and budget to organize the events.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because employees who have better relationships form more cohesive teams.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is recurring and time-bound to the end of each quarter.\n\nSMART Goal Examples for Developing Leadership Competencies\n\nSMART goals for developing leadership competencies focus on building soft skills that lend themselves to effective leadership. Goal examples can include improving active listening, cultivating an open mindset, building empathy, and learning from your mistakes.\n\nHere are five examples of SMART goals for developing leadership competencies below:\n\n1. Become More Adaptable and Open-Minded\n\nThe leader will engage in weekly self-reflection exercises to help identify and overcome personal biases with the goal of becoming more adaptable and open-minded in their thinking.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to become more adaptable and open minded by identifying and overcoming personal biases.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measured as the leader completes exercises each week.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable using books and videos to explore different self-reflection exercises.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because a dynamic workplace requires leaders to be capable of flexible thinking.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal reoccurs weekly.\n\n2. Improve Active Listening\n\nLeadership will improve active listening skills by practicing active listening techniques in at least three conversations per week and by seeking feedback from two colleagues on their progress after two months.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to improve active listening skills by learning and using proven techniques.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measured by receiving feedback from colleagues.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by taking the time to seek out and learn these techniques, as well as practicing them in important conversations.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because active listening helps you get the most out of critical conversations, retain more information, and provide more insight on the topic.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal will be measured after two months.\n\n3. Build Emotional Intelligence\n\nOver the next year, leadership will learn to build their empathy and emotional intelligence by reading four books on empathy and emotional intelligence and by participating in a quarterly leadership book club discussion.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to learn to build emotional intelligence and empathy by reading highly rated books and participating in discussions with other leaders.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measured as leadership reads and discusses each book.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable because reading one book and having one group discussion per quarter is a reasonable expectation of leadership.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because emotional intelligence and empathy can help leadership better relate to employees and customers.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of a year.\n\n4. Give Positive Feedback More Often\n\nBy the end of the month, leadership will improve the quality and frequency of positive feedback provided to the team by dedicating at least 15 minutes per week to record positive feedback and implement regular recognition and appreciation in a weekly recap email.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to give more frequent positive feedback to members of the team.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measured each week when the weekly recap email is released.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by spending 15 minutes to identify the things the team did well that week.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because positive feedback helps employees feel valued and acknowledged by leadership.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the month.\n\n5. Learn From Your Mistakes\n\nLeadership will hold or sit in on lessons learned meetings at the end of major projects to break down mistakes and learn how to help teams avoid them in the future.\n\nSpecific: The goal is to participate in lessons learned meetings to help identify and avoid risks and mistakes.\n\nMeasurable: The goal is measured as each meeting is held at the end of a project.\n\nAchievable: The goal is achievable by implementing a company-wide policy of holding a post-mortem meeting after all major projects.\n\nRelevant: The goal is relevant because documenting and breaking down mistakes is one of the best ways to ensure they do not occur on future projects.\n\nTime-Bound: The goal is time-bound to the end of the next major project.\n\nSMART Goal Examples for Improving Leadership Skills\n\nSMART goals for improving leadership skills should focus on gaining industry-relevant knowledge and certifications, seeking feedback, attending industry events, and building a network.\n\nHere are three examples of SMART goals for improving leadership skills:\n\n1.

You can copy and paste these goals into your own documents directly or customize them to match your personal and professional goal-setting needs. Be sure to consider the needs of your business and your unique leadership position when adapting these goals for yourself.\n\nWhy Do Managers Use SMART Goals?\n\nManagers use SMART goals because they help set clear expectations, track progress, and achieve success in a structured manner. They are useful for leaders to communicate goals clearly and can be referenced easily for review and development conversations.\n\n“SMART goal setting has helped me be a better team leader and manager by allowing me to focus on what is important and to prioritize tasks. I can create a clear roadmap to success, and my team can follow it there,” Chen explains.\n\nIn fact, when teams have an experienced manager, they feel that work quality is higher, more efficient, and more collaborative. Many managers find SMART goals to be one of the best ways to develop their own skills and gain the experience needed to better serve their teams.\n\nWhy Is Setting SMART Goals Important in Leadership Development?\n\nSMART goals are important for leadership development because they create clear, measurable objectives. They help set the example that leadership should follow when creating goals for their teams and projects.\n\n“Goal setting is incredibly important because it helps define clear intentions with measurable outcomes,” says Nolan. “Setting achievable milestones allows leaders to track progress along every step of their journey. As someone who started out leading small teams with very tight budgets before gradually taking on larger management roles across multiple divisions — doing this has helped me make more educated decisions while allowing me oversee growth more effectively than I ever thought possible.”\n\nHere are some of the many reasons that setting SMART goals can help develop better leaders:\n\nClarifies Goals and Objectives: SMART goals are a positive way to communicate clear goals and objectives, as well as a plan for achieving them. This can help encourage an open and visible style of management, which many teams appreciate.\n\nEasy to Track and Determine Success: Developmental goals are only useful if you are able to easily measure their success. SMART goals have success metrics built in, so you can track where you’ve been and where you’d like to end up.\n\nEnsure Developmental Alignment With Company Goals: SMART goals make it easy to compare your personal leadership development goals with those of the organization. By clearly stating your goals, you can ensure they are in the best interest of both you and the company.\n\nHelps Identify Areas of Weakness or Potential Improvement: Goals can help you identify areas of improvement by highlighting where you or your team is falling short. If you do not achieve your SMART goals the first time, reassess, ensure the goal is still realistic, and then make a new plan to achieve it.\n\nPromotes Accountability: Goal setting promotes accountability for the team and for leadership. You are responsible for achieving the goals you set and for helping your team do the same. In fact, people who write down their goals, commit to goal-driven actions, and report regularly on their progress are 70 percent more likely to achieve their goals than those who do not.\n\nBetter Promotion Decisions: “Bias creeps in when there are no structured procedures to determine compensation, bonuses, and promotions, which can result in unjust outcomes that run the risk of demoralizing talented employees,” explains Kofman-Burns. “A fair performance management system that incorporates SMART goals can help companies ensure that they are rewarding their top performers.”"
