        "text": "The first was the development of the ARM microprocessor, originally designed in the early 1980s by Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber at the British company Acorn Computers. At the time ARM stood for Acorn RISC Machines—it's now a separate company called Advanced RISC Machines.\n\nARM chips are important because they very efficiently feed instructions to the circuits on the microprocessor, providing abundant computing power while demanding comparatively little energy.\n\nMost smartphones are now fitted with ARM microprocessors. The low-power processor means that impressive computing can be fitted into a package with a small battery, and smartphones have become progressively thinner and sleeker, light enough to drop in a shirt pocket.\n\nAt the same time they have acquired an ever-increasing array of features, such as touch screens and GPS receivers, in addition to the standard cameras and music players.\n\nThe second advance was the upgrading of mobile networks from second generation (2G) systems to the third generation (3G).\n\n3G networks made it possible to transmit data at a rate high enough to send and receive video, making multimedia access a possibility. Today these networks have developed even further, with the arrival of 4G in 2012 and recent experiments with 5G.\n\nWhen Britain's government held an auction in April 2000 to sell licences to operate 3G networks in the UK, six companies between them paid an astonishing £22.5 billion—four times the government's estimate.\n\nAlthough at first many were stunned by the huge expenditure, in the long run these companies have not regretted their purchase. Underpinned by 3G, the mobile phone became a portal to a whole world of information and entertainment, capable of downloading text, images and video, sending emails and tweets, or browsing the web."
