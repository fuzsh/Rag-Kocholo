In fact, companies that automate their operations mainly to cut their workforces will see only short-term productivity gains, say the authors. Their research, involving 1,500 firms in a range of industries, shows that the biggest performance improvements come when humans and smart machines work together, enhancing each other’s strengths. People need to train AI agents, explain their outputs, and make sure they are used responsibly. AI agents, in turn, can assist people with information gathering, data crunching, routine customer service, and physical labor, thereby freeing them for higher-level tasks that require leadership, creative thinking, judgment, and other human skills. To get the most out of AI, companies need to redesign their business processes. After deciding what needs improvement—their operational flexibility, speed, or scalability; their decision making; or their ability to personalize products and services—they can devise appropriate solutions. That will mean not only implementing AI technology but also developing employees who can work effectively at the human-machine interface. The authors describe how a number of firms are already taking these steps and optimizing collaborative intelligence. But many more should follow their example.",
