OSTP is responsible for ensuring that the best science, research, data, tools, and technologies are brought to bear to implement the President’s Climate Action Plan, including by overseeing the activities of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)—a coalition of 13 Federal agencies conducting rigorous science to predict future climate change, understand climate change impacts, and provide the tools needed to address them.\n\nStatement by OSTP Director Holdren: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Approves Physical Science Report (Sept. 27, 2013)\n\nBlog and Progress Report: President Obama's Climate Action Plan: Taking Action for our Kids (Sept. 20, 2013)\n\nText of the President's Climate Speech on June 25, 2013\n\nClimate Action Plan Info-graphic\n\nUSGCRP Website\n\nBlog: Global Change Research to Benefit the Nation\n\nNational Climate Assessment\n\nThe Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates that a National Climate Assessment (NCA) be conducted every four years, resulting in a report to the President and Congress that synthesizes the best available science on the state and impacts of climate change in the United States—including on sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, transportation, and ecosystems. The next NCA report is due in 2013 and a draft version has already been produced by an independent advisory committee, with contributions from 240 expert authors from academia; local, state, and Federal governments; the private sector; and the nonprofit sector; and drawing from technical input papers submitted by more than 1,000 contributors. A final NCA report is expected to be released in early 2014.\n\nThe 2009 National Climate Assessment\n\nThe draft 2013 National Climate Assessment\n\nThe National Climate Assessment website\n\nBlog: Expanding the Climate Change Conversation\n\nBack to top\n\nPromoting Open Data, Open Government, and Open Science\n\nMy Data\n\nThe My Data initiatives are part of the Obama Administration’s efforts to empower Americans with secure access to their personal data, and increase citizens’ access to private-sector applications and services that can be used to analyze their own data for a growing array of useful purposes. For example, in 2010, the Department of Veterans Affairs created Blue Button, a simple tool that gives patients access to their own health records. Blue Button has become a powerful catalyst to motivate health providers and health plans to give patients access to their own health information. Today, more than 88 million Americans have digital access to their health records or health claims. Other efforts in the Departments of Energy, Commerce, Education and other Federal entities are helping citizens access their own information as fuel for more informed, effective decision making.\n\nBluebutton on HealthIT.gov\n\nIntroducing Blue Button Plus\n\nBlog: Green Button: Enabling Energy Innovation\n\nOpen Data\n\nThe Obama Administration is committed to responsibly unleashing data from the vaults of government to fuel the innovation that grows the economy while also advancing government efficiency and accountability. On May 9, 2013, President Obama signed an Executive Order, making open and machine-readable data the new default for government information, taking historic steps to make government-held data more accessible to the public and to entrepreneurs while appropriately safeguarding sensitive information and rigorously protecting privacy. To build on this landmark effort to open up data across government, the Administration has also launched—through OSTP—several Open Data Initiatives aimed at scaling up open data efforts across the Health, Energy, Education, Finance, Public Safety, and Global Development sectors.\n\nWhite House Open Data Initiatives\n\nBlog: Open Government Data Spurs Entrepreneurship and Jobs\n\nOpen Data Executive Order\n\nOpen Data Policy\n\nOpen Government\n\nThe Obama Administration firmly believes that openness in government strengthens our democracy and promotes a more efficient, effective, and accountable government. OSTP is a leader in support of President Obama’s historic Open Government Directive that requires Federal agencies to take specific steps to achieve key milestones in transparency, participation, and collaboration. You can see all Open Government Directive milestones here; track progress across the executive branch on the Open Government Dashboard; and read about how the Obama Administration is changing the way Washington works in the Progress Report to the American People.\n\nThe President’s Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government\n\nThe President’s Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act\n\nThe Open Government Directive\n\nObama Administration Open Government Status Report\n\nNational Action Plan for the United States of America\n\nOpen Government Self-Assessment Report for the United States of America\n\nOpen Science\n\nBy making scientific knowledge available to the broadest set of potential users, open science accelerates innovation and improvements in health, energy, environmental protection, agriculture, national security, and other important areas. The Obama Administration has supported open science by increasing access to the results of Federally funded scientific research. On February 22, 2013, OSTP Director Holdren issued a memorandum directing all Federal agencies with more than $100 million in annual research and development (R&D) expenditures to develop plans for increasing public access to the scholarly publications and digital data resulting from the research they support. As these plans are completed and made public, Federal agencies are requiring their research staff and scientists they fund to plan for long-term preservation of and access to their research data, and to make their research publications accessible to the public via agency-designated repositories. These and related open-science efforts can enhance reproducibility and boost returns on Federal investments in R&D.\n\nOSTP Memorandum\n\nBlog: Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Science\n\nOSTP Public Access Forum\n\nPresidential Innovation Fellows\n\nThe Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program pairs top innovators from the private sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators inside government for 6- to 13-month “tours of duty” focused on developing solutions that can save lives, save taxpayer money, and fuel job creation. The first round of five projects was launched in August 2012, with 18 inaugural Fellows. The second round of the program launched in the summer of 2013 with nine projects. PIFs have a unique opportunity to serve our Nation and make an impact on a massive scale.\n\nBlog: Throw Your Hat in the Ring for Round 2 of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program\n\nFirst Round PIF Bios\n\nSecond Round PIF Projects\n\nPIF FAQs\n\nTech for Disaster Response\n\nOSTP is partnering with a number of organizations and Federal agencies to build innovative, technological, and crowd-sourced disaster-response tools that can dramatically improve the Nation’s ability to respond to large-scale disasters. Following Hurricane Sandy, for example, OSTP collaborated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop a new documentation system to help citizens more easily find housing and receive financial housing assistance. OSTP also coordinated with companies to provide information about open gas stations, restaurants, and hotels so the supply and demand challenges after a national disaster could be addressed more efficiently than before.\n\nBlog: Innovating for Life-Sustaining Solutions During a Disaster (Oct. 24, 2013)\n\nWhat Startups Taught the White House During Disaster (Mashable)\n\nBlog: Innovating to Improve Disaster Reponse and Recovery\n\nTech vs. Trafficking\n\nThe Tech vs Trafficking Initiative is a joint effort of the White House Council on Women and Girls, the Office of the Vice President, and OSTP to combatchild sex-trafficking by turning the tables on traffickers and harnessing technology to stop them. On July 25th, 2012, the Administration put out a call to action and convened a group of technology innovators from the private and public sectors to brainstorm ways to effectively leverage technology to fight against child sex trafficking in the United States. Tech innovators across the country have responded with enormous ingenuity by building and deploying a growing array of apps to help law enforcement find traffickers and bring them to justice, identify and rescue victims, and help victims connect to services and assistance.\n\nProgress Report: The Obama Administration's Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking at Home and Abroad (Sept. 25, 2013)\n\nBlog: All hands on Deck: Renewing the Call to Combat Human Trafficking (Sept. 25, 2013)\n\nJoining the Fight to End Human Trafficking\n\nBlog: Working Together to Combat Human Trafficking\n\nFact Sheet: the Obama Administration Announces Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking at Home and Abroad\n\nRemarks: President Obama's Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Speech\n\nBack to top\n\nAdvancing Basic and Applied Science\n\nApplying Behavioral Insights to Better Design Policies and Programs\n\nPursuant to Executive Order 13707 (\"Using Behavioral Science Insights to Better Serve the American People\"), the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST) is working with Federal departments and agencies to make government more efficient and effective by using insights about how people engage with, participate in, and respond to policies and programs. As a result of SBST projects, more members of the military are saving for their retirement, more students are going to college and better managing their student loans, more veterans are taking advantage of education and career counseling benefits, and more families are securing health insurance coverage.\n\nSBST.gov\n\nFact Sheet: President Obama Signs Executive Order; White House Announces New Steps to Improve Federal Programs by Leveraging Research Insights\n\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences Team: Annual Report (pdf)\n\nBig Data Research and Development Initiative\n\nAnnounced in March 2012, the Big Data Research and Development Initiative aims to make the most of the fast-growing volume of digital data. By improving the ability to extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of digital data, the initiative promises to help solve some the Nation’s most pressing challenges. The Administration has encouraged multiple stakeholders, including Federal agencies, private industry, academia, state and local government, non-profits, and foundations, to develop and participate in Big Data innovation projects across the country.\n\nOn November 12, 2013, dozens of public and private organizations met at a White House-sponsored “Data to Knowledge to Action” event to announce an inspiring array of Big Data-related collaborations. These collaborations were the product and culmination of over a year of activities catalyzed by teams at OSTP, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program, and Federal agencies to support the Big Data innovation ecosystem; such activities included workshops, one-on-one conversations with potential collaborators, Requests for Information, invited speaker lectures, and more.\n\nBlog: Big Announcements in Big Data\n\nBlog: Big Data is a Big Deal\n\nBiotechnology Policy\n\nAdvances in biotechnology have the potential to drive advances in human health, biofuels, renewable chemicals, and agriculture. OSTP is working with agencies (including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture) to update the Federal Government’s strategy for regulation biotechnology products. Such an update has not been undertaken since 1992, and the landscape for biotechnology products has changed considerably since then.\n\nBlog: Improving Transparency and Ensuring Continued Safety in Biotechnology\n\nThe BRAIN Initiative®:\n\nThe BRAIN Initiative — short for Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies — is a bold research initiative designed to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. Launched with approximately $100 million in the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 Budget, the BRAIN Initiative ultimately aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. The BRAIN Initiative will accelerate the development and application of new technologies that will enable researchers to produce dynamic pictures of the brain that show how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought. These technologies will open new doors to explore how the brain records, processes, uses, stores, and retrieves vast quantities of information, and shed light on the complex links between brain function and behavior.\n\nBlog: BRAIN Initiative Challenges Researchers to Unlock Mysteries of Human Mind\n\nWhite House Fact Sheet: BRAIN Initiative\n\nWhite House Info-graphic: BRAIN Initiative\n\nBlog: 21st Century Grand Challenges\n\nPresidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues website\n\nForensic Science\n\nA number of reports, including the 2009 National Research Council report, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, have highlighted the complex challenges facing the US forensic science community, including fragmentation and funding disparities among the field’s many sub-disciplines; lack of evidence-based standards for some forensic tests; weak ties between the academic research community and practicing forensics providers; and the lack of a unified, national agenda for improving the forensic science disciplines. OSTP is working with the Department of Justice, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation to develop a pragmatic research agenda to strengthen the forensic sciences.\n\nBlog: NIST, DOJ Form Commission to Develop Guidelines for Forensic Labs\n\nDear Colleague Letter - Opportunity for Breakthroughs in Fundamental and Basic Research and Education\n\nMaterials Genome Initiative\n\nThe Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) is a multi-agency initiative designed to create a new era of policy, resources, and infrastructure that support U.S. institutions in the effort to discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials twice as fast as typically occurs today, and at a fraction of the cost. Launched by the President in June 2011, MGI generated $63 million in FY 2012 research grants across multiple agencies and catalyzed commitments from more than 60 companies and universities to advance the MGI through their own business, research, and education practices.\n\nThe Material Genome Initiative website\n\nBlog: Materials Genome Initiative: A Renaissance of American Manufacturing\n\nBlog: Materials Genome Initiative for Global Competitiveness\n\nBlog: New Commitments Support Administration’s Materials Genome Initiative\n\nBlog: Support Grows for President Obama’s Materials Genome Initiative\n\nBlog: $25M in Research Awards to Advance Administration’s Materials Genome Initiative\n\nNational Nanotechnology Initiative\n\nNanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is a major interagency R&D initiative in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, sharing a vision of “a future in which the ability to understand and control matter at the nanoscale leads to a revolution in technology and industry that benefits society.” The scope of the initiative is broad, ranging from fundamental research to development and commercialization. The NNI is overseen by a subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council (co-chaired by OSTP) and is supported by a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office.\n\nSpurring Innovation\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing\n\nIn response to recommendations from the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the NEC and the OSTP are working with agencies to increase their investment in advanced manufacturing research and development. These investments include Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, public–private collaborations designed to bridge the gap between basic research and product development in areas such as additive manufacturing, photonics, digital manufacturing, light-weight metals, and flexible electronics. NEC and OSTP are also encouraging agencies to identify advanced manufacturing technologies that are ripe for expanded investment and collaboration between government, industry, and academia. Examples include advanced materials manufacturing, continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, and synthetic biology.\n\nGrand Challenges\n\nA key component of the Administration’s Strategy for American Innovation is the identification and pursuit of grand challenges—ambitious but achievable goals that will require advances in science and technology and have the potential to capture the public imagination. Examples include the President’s BRAIN Initiative, the Department of Energy’s SunShot (make solar energy as cheap as coal by the end the decade), NASA’s Asteroid Grand Challenge (detect/respond potentially hazardous asteroids), and the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge (reducing maternal and newborn mortality in the first 48 hours after birth).\n\nThe Administration is also encouraging companies, foundations, and universities to get involved as well. For example, UCLA is pursuing a Grand Challenge called Sustainable LA—with the goal of making the LA region 100 percent sustainable in terms energy, water, and biodiversity by 2050. In a letter to President Obama, the deans of over 120 engineering schools pledged to scale-up at the externally organized Grand Challenge Scholars Program, which empowers undergraduate students to use a Grand Challenge as the central organizing principle for their coursework, research, service-learning, international experiences, and entrepreneurial activities.\n\n21st Century Grand Challenges\n\nBlog: We the Geeks: Grand Challenges\n\nRemarks by the President on the 150th Anniversary of the National Academy of Sciences\n\nBlog: Brain Initiative Challenges Researchers to Unlock Mysteries of the Human Mind\n\nBlog: Electric Vehicle Grand Challenge Targets Technology and Cost Breakthroughs\n\nThe Grand Challenges of the 21st Century: Prepared remarks of Tom Kalil (pdf)\n\nBlog: 21st Century Grand Challenges\n\nA Strategy for American Innovation\n\nIncentive Prizes\n\nThe Obama Administration has taken important steps to make incentive prizes a standard tool for open innovation in every Federal agency’s toolbox for addressing our Nation’s most pressing challenges. The Administration, in partnership with private-sector and philanthropic partners, is using prize competitions to spur innovation, solve complex problems, and address national priorities. The use of prizes in the public sector has expanded under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. Since then, more than 250 prizes have been offered by over 50 departments and agencies.\n\nImplementation of Federal Prize Authority: Fiscal Year 2012 Progress Report (pdf)\n\nChallenge.gov website\n\nBlog: Challenge.gov: Two Years and 200 Prizes Later\n\nBlog: Audacious Goals in Eye Research\n\nBlog: DOE Vehicle Data Challenge Fuels Innovation\n\nBlog: Using Incentive Prizes to Tackle the Middle-School Math Gap\n\nBlog: Help NASA Power the International Space Station\n\nBlog: Unleashing Innovation & Deepening Democracy Through Prizes\n\nFact Sheet and FAQ on Prize Authority in the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act\n\nBlog: Congress Grants Broad Prize Authority to All Federal Agencies\n\nGuidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government\n\nInnovation for Global Development\n\nIn collaboration with Administration partners, OSTP implements the Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, which commits the U.S. to leverage its unparalleled capacity for science, technology, and innovation to accelerate progress in areas such as global health, food security, nutrition, clean energy, and financial inclusion. OSTP places particular emphasis on the identification and scale-up of game-changing development technologies, often through mechanisms that engage non-traditional development actors and new innovation tools such as grand challenges, incentive-based financing, open data, patent pools, and impact investing.\n\nAnnouncing the National Impact Initiative at the UK’s G8 Social Impact Investing Forum\n\nHanging Out to Innovate for Global Good: Development Innovation Ventures\n\nNew Tools to Help the Hungry and Malnourished\n\nUSAID Launches Development Labs at Seven Universities\n\nFact Sheet: Harnessing Innovation for Global Development\n\nLab to Market\n\nThe Federal Government invests over $140 billion per year in research and development. While this Federally-funded R&D has led to the creation of new products and new industries, many potential breakthroughs could be more effectively translated from the laboratory to the marketplace. To improve the commercialization of Federally-funded research, the Administration is taking steps such as: (1) providing university researchers with access to entrepreneurship training; (2) giving startups greater access to unique research facilities at national labs; (3) making it easier for entrepreneurs to find and license the intellectual property from agencies such as NIH; and, (4) increasing the two-way flow of people between national labs, industry, academia, and the entrepreneurial sector. For example, more agencies are supporting NSF’s Innovation Corps program, which is teaching scientists and engineers how to determine whether their invention has commercial potential.\n\nBlog: From Lab to Market: Accelerating Research Breakthroughs and Economic Growth\n\nBlog: \"Lab to Market\" Initiatives Transforming New Ideas into New Jobs\n\nPerformance.gov\n\nNational Robotics Initiative\n\nIn June, 2011, President Obama announced the NRI (National Robotics Initiative), a multi-agency initiative designed to support research and development in robotics science and technology. The NRI aims to create new opportunities in diverse areas including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, space exploration, national defense, homeland security, civil infrastructure, and education. In 2012, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the US Department of Agriculture issued a new NRI joint program solicitation of more than $50 million to develop the science and technology for robots that can safely co-exist and operate in close proximity to humans. Leaders from academia, industry and government have developed a roadmap for robotics research, development and education, presented to the Congressional Robotics Caucus in March 2013.\n\nWe The Geeks: \"Robots\"\n\nDeveloping the Next Generation of Robots\n\nSupporting the National Robotics Initiative\n\nThe Road to Cutting Edge Robots\n\nSmart Cities\n\nNew technologies such as sensors, cloud computing, and Big Data have the potential to help communities reduce traffic, fight crime, foster economic growth, manage the effects of a changing climate, and improve the delivery of government services. The Administration is partnering with cities, universities, companies, and foundations to make the most of these opportunities. Agencies like NSF, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are increasing their investment in research and development and pilots to advance smart cities. The initiative includes collaborations such as the MetroLab Network, a coalition of over 20 city-university partnerships that have committed to launch over 60 smarty city projects.\n\nBlog: Launching a Smart Cities Initiative to Tackle City Challenges with Innovative Approaches\n\nSpace Policy\n\nA key tenet of the President’s Space Policy is to encourage and partner with American commercial space companies so that NASA can focus on pushing the frontier of exploration by sending humans to an asteroid and Mars. Just as the early days of government and military air travel paved the way for commercial airliners, one of the goals of the President’s Space Policy is to turn space into the next commercial frontier by using innovative contracting methods that enable collaboration between the U.S. Government and the private sector. The Administration’s priorities in space include advancing a U.S. commercial crew transportation industry, continuing to fund robust programs in Earth and space science, extending the International Space Station program until at least 2020 to foster scientific and technological advances, and more.

The President has led a government-wide effort to expand access to capital, cut red tape, and accelerate innovation through executive actions. He also called on Congress to do its part, resulting in bipartisan legislation such as the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. And, recognizing that this is not a job for government alone, the President also called on the private sector to do more for entrepreneurs. Today, independent organizations such as the Startup America Partnership are stepping up to mobilize resources and grow strong startup communities across the country.\n\nStartup America White House website\n\nBlog: Startup America for a Stronger America\n\nBlog: A Whole-of-Government Commitment to Inclusive Entrepreneurial Growth\n\nObama Administration Announces $2 Billion in Resources to Support Job-Creating Startups\n\nUS Ignite Partnership\n\nThe US Ignite Partnership is an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit with a mission to catalyze 60 advanced, next-generation applications capable of operating on gigabit broadband networks over the next five years in six areas of national priority: education and workforce development, advanced manufacturing, health, transportation, public safety, and clean energy.
