        "text": "Updated April 7, 2022\n\nLooking behind the marketing hype\n\nWhat’s in a name? “Smart” has become a marketing buzzword. If a product is “smart,” the implication is that it will make life better in some way for the user than its “dumber” counterpart. But looking beyond the feel-good higher tech fuzzies, just what is smart technology?\n\nDefining smart technology\n\nSo, what is smart technology? Surprisingly, pinning down a definition can be difficult. Is it connectivity with the Internet? Is it artificial intelligence? A built-in capacity to learn from the environment? Is it app driven? Or is it a combination of all those aspects?\n\nNetlingo offers this definition of smart tech:\n\nThe term “smart” originally comes from the acronym “Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology” but become widely known as “smart” because of the notion of allowing previously inanimate objects—from cars to basketballs to clothes—to talk back to us and even guide our behavior.\n\nAn article on Medium.com by Yogesh Malik defines three basic kinds of smart tech.\n\nSmart devices have some automation and can be easily programmed through an intuitive user interface. For example, think a simple microwave, coffee maker, or toaster. However, more and more are now connected to a network, helping to blur the line between a smart device and a connected device. Examples are smart coffee makers, smart bulbs, smart speakers, and smart security cameras.\n\nSmart connected devices are remotely controlled and monitored via Bluetooth, LTE, Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity. Apps or voice are the gateway. In the real world, most people equate smart with connected. And as more automated devices are redesigned, it could well mean there will no longer be a distinction.\n\nIoT devices are software-defined products that are a combination of product, application, analytics, and the Internet/networking. Think of smart cities, smart factories, and smart homes. IoT devices also create more value than smart or connected devices. Examples might be smart locks, AI security cameras, luggage trackers, irrigation sprinklers, and programmable dash buttons.\n\nIt’s highly possible that in a few years, everything will be so interconnected that the above three distinctions are no longer meaningful.\n\nSmart home advantages\n\nThe term “smart home” usually means many devices tied together. They may or may not have one common app or voice assistant.\n\nAlthough automation has been around for decades, the smart tech era is adding more devices with a new, personal spin. Among other things, smart tech can save energy and make the home more secure. It can catch water leaks before they become disastrous. It makes kitchen and housecleaning chores easier. And it changes up lighting and entertainment options to match moods.\n\nThanks to their voice-activated personal assistants, smart speakers and smart TVs are often the gateway to creating a connected smart home.\n\nOnce considered a novelty by consumers, the power of voice assistants is now apparent. As smart homes encompass a wide variety of tech, more and more smart household devices are compatible with voice assistants—as well as their own app.\n\nSmart home acceptance\n\nA 2020 survey of Americans across all age groups revealed some very interesting statistics and trends:\n\n65% percent of Americans have at least one smart home device, and many purchased the smart technology because it’s better for the environment.\n\n82% percent of men have a smart home device versus 49% of women. Also, 71% of men are considering purchasing another smart home device in the next six months versus 34% of women.\n\n74% percent of those who are very concerned about climate change have a smart home device versus 58% who are somewhat concerned and 42% who are not that concerned.\n\nNortheast residents are most likely to have smart home technology, while those in the Midwest are least likely. Northeasterners also reported the most concern about climate change.\n\nTheir survey also revealed the most popular smart home devices. Smart TVs were not included:\n\nSmart device buying trends\n\nIn January 2022, CTA released their US Consumer Technology One-Year Industry Forecast, 2017 to 2022. There’s a lot of meat in it, so it’s best to look at some key graphics that show spending trends and number of units sold since 2017. “e” means estimated and “p” means projected.\n\nSmart home\n\nCTA found that since Americans were spending more time at home due to COVID-19 they created a surge in smart home technology adoption.\n\nSmart speakers and displays\n\nCTA also confirmed that smart speakers and displays are the primary gateway devices for building a greater smart home ecosystem.\n\nDIY security and thermostats\n\nDIY security continues to gain in popularity as an easy way to monitor different areas of the home while smart thermostats promise energy savings.\n\nSmart appliances and home robots\n\nSmart wearables\n\nWatches that are smart are just the tip of the rapidly expanding health and fitness category.\n\n“Connected exercise equipment exploded onto the scene in a big way as consumers had to shift the way to work out during the pandemic. The adoption of the at home workout has been extremely quick and CTA expects that to continue in 2021 and in 2022.”\n\nHousehold penetration rates of select consumer technology\n\nAs you’ll see from this chart, smart devices continue to find their way into more and more homes.\n\nHome smart home\n\nHopefully, this Be the Expert article has helped answer the question, “What is smart technology?” From the consumer standpoint, it’s any device—with a free app or AI voice—that the user can control via wireless connectivity. It must offer a tangible convenience and, if possible, energy savings.\n\nIt should be noted there are several smart devices that meet the criteria but are too expensive or not practical enough to gain widespread appeal. Certain devices for smart bathrooms come to mind such as toilets, bidets, showers, mirrors, toothbrushes, and tubs.\n\nHowever, that can change. MarketWatch is projecting a global growth of 7.4% in 2022, with recycling a key factor.\n\nIn the not-so-distant future, smart appliances may well make consumers more aware of the IoT side of smart. After all, refrigerators with food recognition technology that can autonomously place grocery orders and dishwashers and ranges that run self-diagnostics and let users know what parts to order are already here. As sales continue to climb, and hopefully price points fall, more and more appliances will utilize IoT.\n\nBe sure to check out what Petra carries in the way of smart technology—especially for the home.
