        "text": "Who Can Take the Credits\n\nYou may be able to take the credits if you made energy saving improvements to your home located in the United States in 2023.\n\nHome.\n\nA home is where you lived in 2023 and can include a house, houseboat, mobile home, cooperative apartment, condominium, and a manufactured home that conforms to Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards.\n\nYou must reduce the cost basis of your home if a residential energy credit is allowed for any expense for any property. The increase in the basis of the property that would result from the expenses will be reduced by the amount of the allowed credit.\n\nMain home\n\nYour main home is generally the home where you live most of the time. A temporary absence due to special circumstances, such as illness, education, business, military service, or vacation, won't change your main home\n\nCosts.\n\nFor purposes of both credits, costs are treated as being paid when the original installation of the item is completed, or, in the case of costs connected with the reconstruction of your home, when your original use of the reconstructed home begins. For purposes of the residential clean energy credit only, costs connected with the construction of a home are treated as being paid when your original use of the constructed home begins. If less than 80% of the use of an item is for nonbusiness purposes, only that portion of the costs that is allocable to the nonbusiness use can be used to determine either credit.\n\nThe residential clean energy credit (Part I) is available for both existing homes and homes being constructed. The energy efficient home improvement credit (Part II) is only available for existing homes.\n\nIRS guidance issued with respect to the energy credit under section 48, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2021-41, does not apply to the residential energy credits.\n\nAssociation or cooperative costs.\n\nIf you are a member of a condominium management association for a condominium you own or a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, you are treated as having paid your proportionate share of any costs of such association or corporation.\n\nIf you received a subsidy from a public utility for the purchase or installation of an energy conservation product and that subsidy wasn't included in your gross income, you must reduce your cost for the product by the amount of that subsidy before you figure your credit. This rule also applies if a third party (such as a contractor) receives the subsidy on your behalf.\n\nResidential Clean Energy Credit (Part I)\n\nIf you made energy saving improvements to more than one home that you used as a residence during 2023, enter the total of those costs on the applicable line(s) of one Form 5695. For qualified fuel cell property, see Lines 7a and 7b, later.\n\nYou may be able to take a credit of 30% of your costs of qualified solar electric property, solar water heating property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, battery storage technology, and fuel cell property. Include any labor costs properly allocable to the onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of the residential clean energy property and for piping or wiring to interconnect such property to the home. The credit amount for costs paid for qualified fuel cell property is limited to $500 for each one-half kilowatt of capacity of the property.\n\nQualified solar electric property costs.\n\nQualified solar electric property costs are costs for property that uses solar energy to generate electricity for use in your home located in the United States. No costs relating to a solar panel or other property installed as a roof (or portion thereof) will fail to qualify solely because the property constitutes a structural component of the structure on which it is installed. Some solar roofing tiles and solar roofing shingles serve the function of both traditional roofing and solar electric collectors, and thus serve functions of both solar electric generation and structural support. These solar roofing tiles and solar roofing shingles can qualify for the credit. This is in contrast to structural components such as a roof's decking or rafters that serve only a roofing or structural function and thus do not qualify for the credit. The home doesn't have to be your main home.\n\nQualified solar water heating property costs.\n\nQualified solar water heating property costs are costs for property to heat water for use in your home located in the United States if at least half of the energy used by the solar water heating property for such purpose is derived from the sun. No costs relating to a solar panel or other property installed as a roof (or portion thereof) will fail to qualify solely because the property constitutes a structural component of the structure on which it is installed. Some solar roofing tiles and solar roofing shingles serve the function of both traditional roofing and solar electric collectors, and thus serve functions of both solar electric generation and structural support. These solar roofing tiles and solar roofing shingles can qualify for the credit. This is in contrast to structural components such as a roof's decking or rafters that serve only a roofing or structural function and thus do not qualify for the credit. To qualify for the credit, the property must be certified for performance by the nonprofit Solar Rating Certification Corporation or a comparable entity endorsed by the government of the state in which the property is installed. The home doesn't have to be your main home.\n\nQualified small wind energy property costs.\n\nQualified small wind energy property costs are costs for property that uses a wind turbine to generate electricity for use in connection with your home located in the United States. The home doesn't have to be your main home.\n\nQualified geothermal heat pump property costs.\n\nQualified geothermal heat pump property costs are costs for qualified geothermal heat pump property installed on or in connection with your home located in the United States. Qualified geothermal heat pump property is any equipment that uses the ground or ground water as a thermal energy source to heat your home or as a thermal energy sink to cool your home. To qualify for the credit, the geothermal heat pump property must meet the requirements of the Energy Star program that are in effect at the time of purchase. The home doesn't have to be your main home.\n\nQualified fuel cell property costs.\n\nQualified fuel cell property costs are costs for qualified fuel cell property installed on or in connection with your main home located in the United States. Qualified fuel cell property is an integrated system comprised of a fuel cell stack assembly and associated balance of plant components that converts a fuel into electricity using electrochemical means. To qualify for the credit, the fuel cell property must have a nameplate capacity of at least one-half kilowatt of electricity using an electrochemical process and an electricity-only generation efficiency greater than 30%.\n\nCosts allocable to a swimming pool, hot tub, or any other energy storage medium that has a function other than the function of such storage don't qualify for the residential clean energy credit.\n\nJoint occupancy.\n\nIf you occupied your home jointly with someone other than your spouse, each occupant must complete their own Form 5695. To figure the credit, the maximum qualifying costs that can be taken into account by all occupants for qualified fuel cell property costs is $1,667 for each one-half kilowatt of capacity of the property. The amount allocable to you for qualified fuel cell property costs is the lesser of:\n\nThe amount you paid, or\n\nThe maximum qualifying cost of the property multiplied by a fraction. The numerator is the amount you paid and the denominator is the total amount paid by you and all other occupants.\n\nThese rules don't apply to married individuals filing a joint return.\n\nExample.\n\nAva owns a house with Bruce where they both reside. In 2023, they installed qualified fuel cell property at a cost of $20,000 with a kilowatt capacity of 5. Ava paid $12,000 towards the cost of the property and Bruce paid the remaining $8,000. The amount to be allocated is $16,670 ($1,667 x 10 (kilowatt capacity x 2)). The amount of cost allocable to Ava is $10,002 ($16,670 x $12,000/$20,000). The amount of cost allocable to Bruce is $6,668 ($16,670 x $8,000/$20,000).\n\nEnergy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Part II)\n\nSection A—Qualified Energy Efficiency Improvements\n\nYou may be able to take a credit equal to 30% of the sum of:\n\nThe amount paid or incurred for qualified energy efficiency improvements installed during 2023,\n\nThe amount of the residential energy property costs paid or incurred in 2023, and\n\nThe amount paid or incurred for home energy audits during 2023.\n\nHowever, this credit is limited as follows.\n\nA total combined credit limit of $1,200 for qualified energy property.\n\nA credit limit of $600 for any qualified energy property item.\n\nA combined credit limit of $600 for all exterior windows and skylights.\n\nA credit limit of $250 for any qualifying exterior door and $500 total for all qualifying exterior doors.\n\nA combined credit limit of $2,000 for heat pump and heat pump water heaters; biomass stoves and boilers.\n\nA credit limit of $150 for home energy audits.\n\nSubsidized energy financing.\n\nAny amounts provided for by subsidized energy financing can't be used to figure the energy efficient home improvement credit. This is financing provided under a federal, state, or local program, the principal purpose of which is to provide subsidized financing for projects designed to conserve or produce energy.\n\nQualified energy efficiency improvements.\n\nQualified energy efficiency improvements are the following building envelope components installed on or in your main home that you owned during 2023 located in the United States if the original use of the component begins with you, the component can be expected to remain in use at least 5 years, and the component meets certain energy standards.\n\nAny insulation material or system and air sealing material or system that is specifically and primarily designed to reduce heat loss or gain of a home when installed in or on such a home.\n\nExterior windows and skylights.\n\nExterior doors.\n\nFor purposes of figuring the credit, don't include amounts paid for the onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of the building envelope component.\n\nTo qualify for the credit, qualified energy efficiency improvements must meet certain energy efficiency requirements. See Line 18a through Line 20a, later, for details.\n\nSection B—Residential Energy Property Expenditures\n\nResidential energy property costs are costs of new qualified energy property that is installed on or in connection with a home that you used during 2023 located in the United States. Include any labor costs properly allocable to the onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of the energy property. Qualified energy property is any of the following.\n\nCertain electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters; electric or natural gas heat pumps; central air conditioners; and natural gas, propane, or oil water heaters.\n\nNatural gas, propane, or oil furnaces and hot water boilers.\n\nCertain biomass stoves and biomass boilers.\n\nCertain improvements or replacements of panelboards, subpanelboards, branch circuits, or feeders.\n\nTo qualify for the credit, qualified energy property must meet certain energy efficiency requirements. See Line 22a through Line 25a and Lines 29a Through 29e, later, for details.\n\nHome energy audits.\n\nHome energy audits costs are costs for an inspection of your main home located in the United States and a written report was prepared by a certified home energy auditor that:\n\nIdentifies the most significant and cost-effective energy efficiency improvements for the home, including an estimate of the energy and cost savings for each improvement; and\n\nIs conducted and prepared by a certified home energy auditor.\n\nTo qualify for the credit, home energy audits must meet certain requirements. See Lines 26a Through 26c, later, for details.\n\nJoint ownership of qualified property.\n\nIf you and a neighbor shared the cost of qualifying property to benefit each of your main homes, both of you can take the energy efficient home improvement credit. You figure your credit on the part of the cost you paid. The limit on the amount of the credit applies to each of you separately.\n\nMarried taxpayers with more than one home.\n\nIf both you and your spouse owned and lived apart in separate main homes, the limit on the amount of the credit applies to each of you separately. If you are filing separate returns, both of you would complete a separate Form 5695. If you are filing a joint return, figure your energy efficient home improvement credit as follows.\n\nComplete lines 17a through 30 of a separate Form 5695 for each main home.\n\nFigure the amount to be entered on line 30 of both forms and enter the combined amount on line 30 of one of the forms.\n\nOn the dotted line to the left of line 30, enter “More than one main home.” Then, complete the rest of this form.\n\nAttach both forms to your return.\n\nJoint occupancy.\n\nIf you owned your home jointly with someone other than your spouse, each owner must complete their own Form 5695. To figure the credit, enter the amounts you paid for these items on the appropriate lines of Form 5695, Part II. The amount allocable to you is the smaller of:\n\nThe amount you paid, or\n\nThe qualifying credit of the property multiplied by a fraction. The numerator is the amount you paid and the denominator is the total amount paid by you and all other owners.\n\nThe credit limit for each property is as follows.\n\n$1,200 for insulation or air sealing material system.\n\n$250 for one exterior door and $500 for all exterior doors.\n\n$600 for windows.\n\n$600 for central air conditioners.\n\n$600 for natural gas, propane, or oil water heaters.\n\n$600 for natural gas, propane, or oil furnace or hot water boilers.\n\n$600 for improvements or replacements of panelboards, subpanelboards, branch circuits, or feeders.\n\n$150 for home energy audits.\n\n$2,000 for heat pumps and heat pump water heaters; biomass stoves and biomass boilers."
