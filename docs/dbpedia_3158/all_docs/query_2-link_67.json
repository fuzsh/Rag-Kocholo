Yeah, if I bought it, please don’t touch?” If so, you just might be part of the Beyhive. Or maybe you're just an avid listener of throwback playlists.\n\nBut Beyoncé knew what she was talking about. And though she might’ve been telling someone to get lost, she made it clear that her belongings were hers (and they were off-limits). You likely feel the same about your favorite jacket or a piece of jewelry you bought to celebrate a special occasion. Personal property is precious, and it should be treated as such.\n\nThis concept is not lost on insurance companies. They have a whole category of protection dedicated to just your belongings. But it’s up to you to let them know exactly how much they’re worth, and you can accomplish that with a proper home inventory. Because while Beyoncé might say that nothing is Irreplaceable, you know better when it comes to your most prized possessions.\n\nClick here to jump straight to our list of recommended home inventory apps.\n\nWhat to include in a home inventory\n\nIf the idea of creating an inventory of all the contents in your home makes you want to run for the hills, don’t tie up your laces just yet. While you do need to gather a lot of information for a home inventory, the process isn’t as tedious as you might think. In fact, you can even take a video of your home or provide pictures for proof of what you own. But if you do want to go the more detailed route, make sure to mark down the following for each item during your inventory:\n\nA description\n\nA picture or video\n\nThis will allow you to prove its previous condition to your insurance provider\n\nCost at the time of purchase\n\nCurrent appraised value\n\nThis isn’t required and is only recommended for extremely rare or expensive items\n\nDate and location of the purchase\n\nThe receipt (or picture of it) if you have it\n\nSerial number\n\nWhy is a home inventory important?\n\nBefore getting started, you may ask yourself, “is a home inventory really necessary?” Great question. A home inventory is pretty important, as it’ll help you determine how much personal property coverage you need for your belongings. You’ll also be grateful you made one if you ever have to file a claim with your insurance provider. Not only will it help you remember exactly what you have in your home should you lose multiple items in a break-in or a house fire, but it’ll also ensure you can get the full value of your items when filing a claim.\n\nWhat is a home inventory app?\n\nFrom devices that make your life easier to tech offered with home insurance policies, you can’t buy a home (or even take care of your current home) without hearing about the latest technology. Creating a home inventory is no exception. A home inventory app is an application for your phone or tablet that helps you keep track of all your belongings, their value and location.
