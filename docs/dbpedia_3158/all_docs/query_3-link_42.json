        "text": "Featured article by Calvin Paige, Independent Technology Author\n\nWhile technology can be confusing and overwhelming at times, there are also many reasons to fall in love with it. One of these being is that it can help you in your career and in making your life easier overall.\n\nThere are seven ways in particular that technology can be a lifesaver when it comes to getting ahead professionally. It’s worth diving into these topics in more detail if you’re at a crossroads with your job and want to build a successful future for yourself in the workplace. Let these ideas inspire and motivate you to want to do more with technology when it comes to your career and moving on up the corporate ladder.\n\n1. Online Learning\n\nOne way technology can help you in your career is how it allows you to learn and improve your skills from anywhere, and at any time. For example, if you’re currently a marketing professional then you might want to think about obtaining a higher education such as getting your graduate certificate in marketing so you can land a better job in the future. Hop online to get signed up, and after completing the coursework, you’ll have the proof to show that you’re educated in your area of expertise and can help your company to perform better overall. The best part is that you can hold down a full-time job while you study and take the coursework from the comfort of your own home.\n\n2. Networking\n\nIn addition, technology can help you to build up your network of connections and get to know more people in a short amount of time. There are several online networking platforms to join and choose from these days that will allow you to seamlessly network with others whenever you choose. Make sure your profile is current and easy to read so that anyone looking for employees such as yourself can get to know you a little bit online before reaching out to you.\n\nNetworking online not only allows you to connect with potential customers, but to also reach out to individuals like yourself who work in the same industry and to share valuable knowledge and information with each other.\n\n3. Getting Organized\n\nTechnology can also help you in your career by allowing you to get better organized at work. For example, there’s project management software to take advantage of and other tools and resources that will assist you in decluttering your online space and files. Take time to sort through and organize your files into folders on your computer and make sure you can quickly find what it is you’re looking for at all times.\n\nIn addition, use email to communicate and document conversations so that you can access and refer to this information at a later date and stay organized.\n\n4. Being More Productive\n\nOne of the best parts about using technology is that it helps to make you more productive in general. No longer do you have to use pencil and paper to figure out calculations or wait to meet with someone else in person to go over edits or corrections related to work projects. Instead, you can input all of this information online, or in the cloud, and work with others no matter where they’re located around the world. Mundane and repetitive tasks can now be completed with the click of a few buttons, and you’ll find you have a lot of additional time in your schedule for more important matters you need to address.\n\n5. Conducting Research\n\nIt’s possible that you’re someone who depends on gathering and looking up information for your job on a regular basis. In this case, technology can help you in your career by allowing you to conduct research instantaneously as long as you have access to the internet. No longer do you have to wait around for answers from others, but instead you can take matters into your own hands by going online and finding what you need to do your job.\n\nUse technology to look up and retrieve the information you require in a timely manner so you can complete your projects efficiently and effectively and then be rewarded for your hard work.\n\n6. Use an Infographic Resume to Stand Out\n\nA resume is an essential tool for job seekers, as it presents a summary of their qualifications and achievements to potential employers. A well-crafted resume can help job seekers stand out from the competition and land job interviews. However, traditional resumes can be dull and unengaging, making it hard for job seekers to capture the attention of employers. This is where an infographic resume comes in. An infographic resume uses visual elements such as graphs, charts, and images to present information in a more visually appealing and memorable way. This makes it easier for job seekers to showcase their skills and achievements, and stand out from the crowd. Infographic resumes are also highly shareable, making them an effective way to increase visibility on social media platforms and build a personal brand. Overall, an infographic resume is a great way to make a lasting impression on potential employers and improve the chances of landing a job interview.\n\n7. Finding A New Job\n\nFurthermore, you never know when you’re going to get sick and tired of your current position and want to look for a new job. Doing so is relatively straightforward, as you can apply for open positions from your laptop or mobile phone. You’re also not limited as to what jobs you can apply for when you have the option to work remotely.\n\nTechnology now allows for more and more people to work from home or other locations without the need to be in a physical office. Advance your career and get ahead by using technology to find new job opportunities in a wide variety of locations and industries so that you can work a role that you find gratifying and is a good fit for you.\n\n8. Time & Life Management\n\nThese days it’s easy to get so swept up in your job and working, that you forget about your own needs. However, it’s important that if you want to be successful in your career, you should also take care of yourself and manage your time more effectively. There are apps, calendars and other tools out there that will allow you to do this online, so that you’re always on top of your schedule and never late for another appointment again.\n\nThere are also health trackers and apps you can use that will help you monitor your exercise, eating and sleep habits so that you can stay healthy as a working professional who is always on the go.\n\nTo reach more senior positions in your career and perform well at your job, you’re going to need to be healthy and have a lot of natural energy. Let technology help you with this endeavor so that you can keep on track with your self-care and not let your job performance slip over time."
