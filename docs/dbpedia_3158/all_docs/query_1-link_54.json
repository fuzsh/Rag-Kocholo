        "text": "1960s\n\nOne of the most important institutions in high technology history began when Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the best-known figures in semiconductor technology, decided to form a new company together. Together with a small cadre of colleagues and connections drawn from their years in the Silicon Valley tech industry, Noyce and Moore set out to create a new kind of company, one dedicated to continuous innovation and the firm belief that their technologies would change the world.\n\n1970s\n\nA young Intel grew to be one of the biggest, most important companies in tech. The company introduced several industry-changing technologies that paved the way for inexpensive computing to become ubiquitous in modern life. Most importantly, the company introduced the world's first programmable microprocessor, followed by several generations of improvements that helped the device reach ever-greater levels of application. Meanwhile, corporate growth kept pace with its technological prowess as Intel moved into new facilities, new countries and new business avenues at an astonishing pace.\n\n1980s\n\nSemiconductors continued to make inroads into every aspect of American life with Intel leading the way. The launch of the IBM PC in 1981 heralded the beginning of a decade where the personal computer would come into its own as a business tool, while breakthroughs in other areas of semiconductor engineering expanded Intel's reach in everything from cars to supercomputing. The company’s victories were hampered by multiple industrywide slumps, however, which Intel met with its characteristic combination of innovation and commitment.\n\n1990s\n\nThe advent of the World Wide Web and user-friendly web browsers prompted a massive increase in consumer computing, bringing greater fame and fortune to Intel. Intel secured its position as a leader in the new market through a combination of successful products and effective brand promotions, including the now famous “Intel Inside” campaign and the Intel Bunny People. By the end of the decade, Intel had not only experienced phenomenal growth and provided game-changing technologies — it had become a household name.\n\n2000s\n\nIn a decade bookended by big market declines in 2001 and 2008, Intel continued to invest in Research and Development and new production processes and sites. The company’s efforts allowed it to navigate the tumultuous times far better than its peers even as it helped to popularize game-changing technologies like wireless computing and multicore processors.\n\n2010s\n\nIntel became a key player in the proliferation of “smart” devices that maintained wireless connections to cloud servers to perform tasks standalone devices can't. The company’s technology powered the countless end-user devices found in households throughout the world, from kitchen appliances to unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), as well as the high-intensity servers that processed the data those devices generate and the networks that kept the connected devices connected. At the same time, the company launched pioneering initiatives to foster diversity and ensure conflict-free materials sourcing, showing that Intel's corporate responsiblity initiatives, like its products, were always on the cutting edge.\n\n2020s\n\nIntel entered the 2020s ready to continue creating world-changing technologies that would improve the life of every person on the planet. Throughout its history, Intel had been at the forefront of creating the data-centric world, and the company itself had evolved along with that world. In its sixth decade, Intel focused on technologies that were unimaginable when it was founded, such as artificial intelligence, 5G wireless networking and intelligent edge computing. Yet even as the company’s fields of development changed in awe-inspiring ways, Intel remained committed to making the world safer, healthier, more inclusive and more sustainable, even as the COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges."
