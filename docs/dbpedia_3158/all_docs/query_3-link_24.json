        "text": "Advanced computing and data analysis underpin a lot of our research into new energy technologies, including algae biofuels. We augment our in-house resources, which include high performance computer clusters and a staff of data scientists, with partnerships that open up even more opportunity for innovation. For example, in 2019 we signed a potentially pathbreaking agreement with IBM in the field of quantum computing. According to Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development (pictured opposite), this ambitious collaboration aims to provide us with capabilities ‘‘to simulate nature and chemistry that we've never had before.’’\n\nExxonMobil maintains a fundamental research and development program unmatched in the energy industry. Our goal is to search for new energy solutions that can help us tackle the dual challenge of meeting the world’s growing energy needs while minimizing environmental impacts.\n\nExxonMobil is the first in our industry to leverage autonomous drilling in deep water. We developed a proprietary drilling advisory system, currently being used in our Guyana operations, that leverages artificial intelligence to determine the ideal parameters for drilling. It also allows for closed-loop automation, which controls the drilling process without human intervention.\n\nCombining more than a century of drilling experience into an automated system to maximize rates of penetration while minimizing technical issues provides multiple benefits for our operations. First, this technology improves drilling safety and efficiency through consistent, repeatable operations. Second, it eliminates repetitive tasks for rig personnel, allowing them to focus on other work.\n\nExxonMobil is collaborating with Microsoft to use IoT technologies in our operations in the Permian Basin to monitor and optimize a vast number of widely dispersed field assets. Data is collected from an extensive network of sensors and stored in the cloud, allowing our engineers, scientists, and analysts seamless, real-time access from anywhere. The insights we glean from this data are used to enable performance optimization and workflow automation. Over the course of a field’s life this can lower costs, increase production, and reduce methane emissions.\n\nUsing advanced digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to make our Permian operations more efficient is a first step as we move towards closed-loop automation, a process that allows systems to recognize and respond to events without human intervention.\n\nNew digital solutions are transforming the experience we provide to our customers, from lubricant analysis to pay-at-the-pump mobile applications to digitally enabled car maintenance offerings.\n\nExxonMobil is collaborating with IBM, Amazon and other digital leaders to offer consumers new payment options at Exxon- and Mobil-branded service stations in the U.S., including ‘Alexa, pay for gas.’ This digital technology, leveraging your vehicle’s Alexa-enabled device or the Alexa app, provides a new contactless method of payment for our retail consumers with potential to reach over 60 million US households that leverage Alexa in their home and on the go.\n\nExxonMobil is also working with technology companies to develop digital platforms bringing suppliers together with customers and consumers to provide a superior mobility experience. ExxonMobil is teaming up with Tencent, Tuhu, and a distribution holding company to establish an car maintenance experience built on a digital framework. The joint venture will grow the Mobil 1 car care network in China and leverage the strength of all the partners to provide a high-quality, digitally enabled, comprehensive car maintenance experience."
