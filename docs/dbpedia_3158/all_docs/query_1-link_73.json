        "text": "Today customers expect to be able to conduct their business, do their work and live their lives by using the latest digital technologies. They expect this ability from wherever they are, anytime they want, by using the device of their choice and with all the supporting information and personalized content they need close at hand. The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to meet these expectations.\n\nEvery organization’s digital transformation implementation is different. It can begin with a single focused technology project, or as a comprehensive enterprise-wide initiative. It can range from integrating digital technology into existing processes and products, to reinventing processes and products or creating entirely new revenue streams by using still-emerging technologies.\n\nBut experts agree that digital transformation is as much about business transformation and change management as it is about replacing analog processes or modernizing existing IT. While often led by a company’s chief information office (CIO), it requires the entire C-suite to align on new technologies and methodologies that can improve customer experience, empower employees and achieve business goals.\n\nThe earliest, headline-making examples of digital transformation—Uber, AirBnB, Netflix—used mobile and cloud computing technologies to reimagine transactions and, sometimes, disrupt entire industries. The COVID-19 pandemic drove transformative innovations to better support remote and hybrid work. Today, organizations are applying artificial intelligence (AI), automation and other technologies to streamline workflows, personalize customer experiences, improve decision-making, and respond more quickly and effectively to market disruptions and new opportunities.\n\nDigital transformation can help companies increase customer loyalty, attract talented employees, foster competitive advantage and build business value. McKinsey research found that between 2018-2022, digital leaders achieved about 65% greater annual total shareholder returns than digital “laggards.”1\n\nBusiness model transformation is a fundamental change in the way that an organization delivers products, services and value to its customers, investors or stakeholders. Examples include:\n\nDelivering video through digital streaming, instead of physical disks (Netflix, Hulu)\n\nEnabling anyone with a car to make money driving, without purchasing a medallion (Uber, Lyft)\n\nAllowing customers to deposit checks without visiting the bank (mobile deposit)\n\nOrganizations pursue business model transformation for any number of reasons—for example, to meet changing customer expectations, boost flagging sales, or differentiate themselves in a highly competitive market. They might also see a chance to disrupt a market or industry in their favor with a new business model—or have a need to respond to a disruptive competitor.\n\nOrganizations are incorporating digital innovation into their products, and into the way their products are developed, produced and delivered.\n\nThe most obvious examples involve the embedding of digital technology into everyday products. Automobiles, for instance, are continually transformed in this way. Innovations range from the ability to view and operate a smartphone from a car dashboard, to sensors that prevent crashes and unintended lane changes, to vehicles that incorporate computer vision, geolocation, machine learning and robotic process automation (RPA) to operate with minimal or no human intervention.\n\nBy implementing Internet of Things (IoT), operational technology and automation on the factory floor, manufacturers can speed production, reduce errors and defects and eliminate manual labor. By adopting agile or DevOps practices organizations can speed software development. Companies can also add value and competitive differentiation by offering technology alongside their existing services—witness the tracker apps offered by shipping companies and pizza vendors.\n\nCustomer experience, or CX, is the sum of customers’ perceptions resulting from all their interactions with a business or brand—online, in-store and in day-to-day life.\n\nIn the end, all digital transformation journeys lead to the customer experience domain. Continually improving the customer experience is a competitive imperative for most organizations.\n\nIn the digital age, continually improving the customer experience requires continual digital innovation. It’s not just that customers expect to be able to do business anytime, anywhere and on any device—today customers depend on it.\n\nThey plan their mornings knowing their phones tell them exactly how long it takes to drive to work, and their evenings knowing they can meet the food delivery driver at their door. They ignore customer service call center hours, knowing they can get answers 24/7 from a chatbot. They stop saving receipts knowing that they can download their bank and credit card history at tax time (or anytime).\n\nCustomers count on these and scores of other digital innovations, and they are ready to count on new ones. Successful digital transformation positions organizations to anticipate and deliver the next innovations and experiences customers will want."
