        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently one of the hottest buzzwords in tech and with good reason. The last few years have seen several innovations and advancements that have previously been solely in the realm of science fiction slowly transform into reality.Â\n\nExperts regard artificial intelligence as a factor of production, which has the potential to introduce new sources of growth and change the way work is done across industries. For instance, this PWC article predicts that AI could potentially contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2035. China and the United States are primed to benefit the most from the coming AI boom, accounting for nearly 70% of the global impact.\n\nThis Simplilearn tutorial provides an overview of AI, including how it works, its pros and cons, its applications, certifications, and why itâs a good field to master.Â\n\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. Learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language comprehension are all examples of cognitive abilities.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.\n\nAlso Read: AI Skills You Need to Stand Out\n\nWeak AI vs. Strong AI\n\nWhen discussing artificial intelligence (AI), it is common to distinguish between two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI. Let's explore the characteristics of each type:\n\nWeak AI (Narrow AI)\n\nWeak AI refers to AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks and are limited to those tasks only. These AI systems excel at their designated functions but lack general intelligence. Examples of weak AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation algorithms, and image recognition systems. Weak AI operates within predefined boundaries and cannot generalize beyond their specialized domain.\n\nStrong AI (General AI)\n\nStrong AI, also known as general AI, refers to AI systems that possess human-level intelligence or even surpass human intelligence across a wide range of tasks. Strong AI would be capable of understanding, reasoning, learning, and applying knowledge to solve complex problems in a manner similar to human cognition. However, the development of strong AI is still largely theoretical and has not been achieved to date.\n\nTypes of Artificial IntelligenceÂ\n\nBelow are the various types of AI:\n\n1. Purely Reactive\n\nThese machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work. For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win.Â\n\n2. Limited Memory\n\nThese machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant based on the location data that has been gathered.\n\n3. Theory of Mind\n\nThis kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on this type is yet to be built.Â\n\n4. Self-Aware\n\nSelf-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies. They will be intelligent, sentient, and conscious.\n\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning\n\nLet's explore the contrast between deep learning and machine learning:\n\nMachine Learning:Â\n\nMachine Learning focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Here are key characteristics of machine learning:\n\nFeature Engineering: In machine learning, experts manually engineer or select relevant features from the input data to aid the algorithm in making accurate predictions.\n\nSupervised and Unsupervised Learning: Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data with known outcomes, and unsupervised learning, where algorithms discover patterns and structures in unlabeled data.\n\nBroad Applicability: Machine learning techniques find application across various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.\n\nCheck Out: Best AI and Machine Learning Courses in 2024\n\nDeep Learning:Â\n\nDeep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. Here are key characteristics of deep learning:\n\nAutomatic Feature Extraction: Deep learning algorithms have the ability to automatically extract relevant features from raw data, eliminating the need for explicit feature engineering.\n\nDeep Neural Networks: Deep learning employs neural networks with multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), enabling the learning of complex hierarchical representations of data.\n\nHigh Performance: Deep learning has demonstrated exceptional performance in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, often surpassing traditional machine learning approaches.\n\nHow Does Artificial Intelligence Work?\n\nPut simply, AI systems work by merging large with intelligent, iterative processing algorithms. This combination allows AI to learn from patterns and features in the analyzed data. Each time an Artificial Intelligence system performs a round of data processing, it tests and measures its performance and uses the results to develop additional expertise.\n\nWays of Implementing AIÂ\n\nLetâs explore the following ways that explain how we can implement AI:\n\nMachine Learning\n\nIt is machine learning that gives AI the ability to learn. This is done by using algorithms to discover patterns and generate insights from the data they are exposed to.Â\n\nDeep Learning\n\nDeep learning, which is a subcategory of machine learning, provides AI with the ability to mimic a human brainâs neural network. It can make sense of patterns, noise, and sources of confusion in the data.\n\nConsider an image shown below:\n\nHere we segregated the various kinds of images using deep learning. The machine goes through various features of photographs and distinguishes them with a process called feature extraction. Based on the features of each photo, the machine segregates them into different categories, such as landscape, portrait, or others.Â\n\nLet us understand how deep learning works.Â\n\nConsider an image shown below:\n\nThe above image depicts the three main layers of a neural network:\n\nInput Layer\n\nHidden Layer\n\nOutput Layer\n\nInput Layer\n\nThe images that we want to segregate go into the input layer. Arrows are drawn from the image on to the individual dots of the input layer. Each of the white dots in the yellow layer (input layer) are a pixel in the picture. These images fill the white dots in the input layer.\n\nWe should have a clear idea of these three layers while going through this artificial intelligence tutorial.\n\nHidden Layer\n\nThe hidden layers are responsible for all the mathematical computations or feature extraction on our inputs. In the above image, the layers shown in orange represent the hidden layers. The lines that are seen between these layers are called âweightsâ. Each one of them usually represents a float number, or a decimal number, which is multiplied by the value in the input layer. All the weights add up in the hidden layer. The dots in the hidden layer represent a value based on the sum of the weights. These values are then passed to the next hidden layer.\n\nYou may be wondering why there are multiple layers. The hidden layers function as alternatives to some degree. The more the hidden layers are, the more complex the data that goes in and what can be produced. The accuracy of the predicted output generally depends on the number of hidden layers present and the complexity of the data going in.\n\nOutput Layer\n\nThe output layer gives us segregated photos. Once the layer adds up all these weights being fed in, it'll determine if the picture is a portrait or a landscape.\n\nExample - Predicting Airfare Costs\n\nThis prediction is based on various factors, including:\n\nAirlineÂ\n\nOrigin airportÂ\n\nDestination airport\n\nDeparture date\n\nWe begin with some historical data on ticket prices to train the machine. Once our machine is trained, we share new data that will predict the costs. Earlier, when we learned about four kinds of machines, we discussed machines with memory. Here, we talk about the memory only, and how it understands a pattern in the data and uses it to make predictions for the new prices as shown below:\n\nAI Programming Cognitive Skills: Learning, Reasoning and Self-Correction\n\nArtificial Intelligence emphasizes three cognitive skills of learning, reasoning, and self-correction, skills that the human brain possess to one degree or another. We define these in the context of AI as:\n\nLearning: The acquisition of information and the rules needed to use that information.\n\nReasoning: Using the information rules to reach definite or approximate conclusions.\n\nSelf-Correction: The process of continually fine-tuning AI algorithms and ensure that they offer the most accurate results they can.\n\nHowever, researchers and programmers have extended and elaborated the goals of AI to the following:\n\nLogical ReasoningÂ\n\nAI programs enable computers to perform sophisticated tasks. On February 10, 1996, IBMâs Deep Blue computer won a game of chess against a former world champion, Garry Kasparov.\n\nKnowledge Representation\n\nSmalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language that was created to underpin the ânew worldâ of computing exemplified by âhuman-computer symbiosis.â\n\nPlanning and NavigationÂ\n\nThe process of enabling a computer to get from point A to point B. A prime example of this is Googleâs self-driving Toyota Prius.\n\nNatural Language ProcessingÂ\n\nSet up computers that can understand and process language.\n\nPerceptionÂ\n\nUse computers to interact with the world through sight, hearing, touch, and smell.\n\nEmergent IntelligenceÂ\n\nIntelligence that is not explicitly programmed, but emerges from the rest of the specific AI features. The vision for this goal is to have machines exhibit emotional intelligence and moral reasoning.\n\nSome of the tasks performed by AI-enabled devices include:\n\nSpeech recognitionÂ\n\nObject detection\n\nSolve problems and learn from the given dataÂ\n\nPlan an approach for future tests to be done\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence has its pluses and minuses, much like any other concept or innovation. Hereâs a quick rundown of some pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nIt reduces human error\n\nIt never sleeps, so itâs available 24x7\n\nIt never gets bored, so it easily handles repetitive tasks\n\nItâs fast\n\nCons\n\nItâs costly to implement\n\nIt canât duplicate human creativity\n\nIt will definitely replace some jobs, leading to unemployment\n\nPeople can become overly reliant on it\n\nLet us continue this article on What is Artificial Intelligence by discussing the applications of AI.\n\nApplications of Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has a wide range of applications across various industries and domains.
