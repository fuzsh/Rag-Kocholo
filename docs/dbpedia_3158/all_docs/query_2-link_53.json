        "text": "Safety Check\n\nThis section in iOS Settings helps you disconnect your iPhone from people, apps, and devices you no longer want to be connected to.\n\nNew\n\nSensitive Content Warning\n\nSensitive Content Warning helps you avoid seeing unwanted images and videos that may contain nudity by initially blurring them. It works in Messages, with AirDrop files, in FaceTime video messages, and in the Phone app when receiving a Contact Poster. This feature is optional and you can turn it on in Privacy & Security settings. All image and video processing occurs on your device, meaning that neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content.\n\nPrivacy Nutrition Labels\n\nProduct pages on the App Store feature a section that provides developers’ self‑reported summaries of some of their privacy practices in a simple, easy‑to‑read label. This shows how developers are collecting and using your data, including information like your location, browsing history, and contacts. This is part of ongoing work to increase transparency and control over your data, and Apple will continue to update this feature and work with developers to ensure that users can make informed choices.\n\nApp Tracking Transparency\n\nYour devices carry the story of your life. We believe you should have a choice in how apps track and share your data with other companies for advertising or with data brokers.\n\nStarting with iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, apps are required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. You can change your preference for any app or prevent apps from asking for permission entirely in Settings.\n\nApp Privacy Report\n\nSee at a glance what your apps have been up to when you turn on App Privacy Report. A section in Settings shows how often your location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts have been accessed during the last seven days. It also reveals which domains apps have contacted. Together with Privacy Nutrition Labels, this feature gives you a more complete picture of how the apps you use treat your privacy.\n\nPasteboard permission\n\nApps need to get your permission before accessing the pasteboard to paste content from another app.\n\nThird-party apps and permissions\n\nApple gives you transparency and control over the data you share with apps. Apps may request access to things such as your location, contacts, calendars, or photos. You’ll receive a prompt with an explanation the first time a third-party app wants to use this data, so you can make an informed decision about granting permission. Even if you grant access once, you can always change it later in Settings. iOS and iPadOS require developers to get your permission before tracking you or your device across apps and websites owned by other companies for ad targeting, for ad measurement purposes, or to share your data with data brokers.\n\nNo app can access the microphone or camera without your permission. In iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 or later, when an app uses the microphone or camera, your device displays an indicator to let you know it is being used –– whether you are in the app, in another app, or on the Home Screen. And Control Center shows you when an app has recently used the microphone or camera. In iOS and iPadOS, access to the camera is disabled for an app when it is in the background.\n\nSometimes apps need to know what other devices are on your local network, like when you’re trying to connect to a smart TV or printer. Starting with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, apps need to ask your permission before scanning your local network.\n\niOS and iPadOS also let you know when an app accesses your Clipboard, so you can confirm that it receives access to only the items you expect.\n\nData and privacy information\n\nData and privacy information screens make it easy to understand how Apple will use your personal information before you sign in or start using new features. When you see the Data and Privacy icon, you’ll find helpful information on what personal data may be shared and how it will be used to improve your experience.\n\nLocation data\n\nSometimes it’s useful for your device to know your location, like when you’re setting up meetings in Calendar or getting directions. Location Services on your device uses a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and mobile towers to figure out where you are. Apple gives you control over the collection and use of this location data on all your devices. Starting with iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and watchOS 7, you can choose whether apps have access to your approximate location — an area of about 10 square miles — rather than your precise location. Location Services is not on by default. You can enable it when you first set up your device, and you can always turn it off if you change your mind.\n\nData and Privacy page\n\nTo give you more control over your personal information, we provide a set of dedicated privacy management tools on your Data and Privacy page. These tools give you the ability to get a copy of your data, request a correction to your data, deactivate your account, or delete your account.\n\nAnalytics\n\nIf you choose to opt in, your iOS and iPadOS devices can collect analytics about your device and any paired Apple Watch and send it to Apple for analysis. This analysis helps Apple improve products and reduce problems like apps crashing. The collected information does not identify you personally and can be sent to Apple only with your explicit consent. Analytics may include details about hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your devices and applications. When it’s collected, personal data is either not logged at all, removed from reports before they’re sent to Apple, or protected by techniques such as Differential Privacy.\n\nThe information we gather using Differential Privacy helps us improve our services without compromising individual privacy. For example, this technology improves QuickType and emoji suggestions, as well as Lookup Hints in Notes.\n\nWe identify commonly used data types in the Health app and web domains in Safari that cause performance issues. This information allows us to work with developers to improve your experience without revealing anything about your individual behavior.\n\nIf you give your explicit consent to share iCloud Analytics, Apple can improve Siri and other intelligent features by analyzing how you use iCloud data from your account, such as text snippets from email messages. Analysis happens only after the data has gone through privacy-enhancing techniques like Differential Privacy so that it cannot be associated with you or your account.\n\nAdvertising\n\nApple is committed to delivering advertising in a way that respects your privacy. Apple‑delivered ads may appear on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. The Apple advertising platform does not track you, nor does it buy or share your personal information with other companies. Your Apple Pay transactions, Health app data, and HomeKit app data are not used by the Apple advertising platform to deliver ads. Your App Store search and download history may be used to serve you relevant ads. In the Apple News and Stocks apps, ads are served based partly on what you read or follow. This includes the topics and categories of the stories you read and the publications you follow, subscribe to, or enable notifications from. The stories you read are not used to serve targeted ads to you outside these apps. You can view the information Apple uses to deliver relevant ads to you in Settings. You can also turn off Personalized Ads at any time in Settings to stop receiving targeted ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. Turning off Personalized Ads will limit Apple’s ability to deliver relevant ads to you but may not reduce the number of ads you receive. The Apple advertising platform doesn’t serve ads to children under 13 years old and Managed Apple IDs. In addition, Apple has strong guidelines for apps in the Kids category of the App Store, including prohibiting apps in the category from including third-party analytics or third-party advertising.\n\nLockdown Mode\n\nLockdown Mode helps defend against highly targeted spyware by providing optional protection for a specific group of users who face sophisticated digital attacks, such as those from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Lockdown Mode in iOS 16 or later, iPadOS 16 or later, macOS Ventura or later, and Apple Watch hardens device defenses and limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the effectiveness of these spyware attacks.\n\nSix-digit passcodes\n\nSetting a passcode is the most important thing you can do to safeguard your device. The passcode on your Touch ID– or Face ID–enabled device is automatically set to six digits, creating a million possible combinations. You can also enable Erase Data in Settings to have your device wipe itself clean after 10 incorrect guesses.\n\nTouch ID and Face ID\n\nTouch ID and Face ID provide intuitive and secure authentication with the touch of a finger or a simple glance. Your fingerprint or face data is converted into a mathematical representation that is encrypted and used only by the Secure Enclave in your Mac, iPad, or iPhone. Since fingerprint and face data is so personal, your device takes extraordinary measures to protect it. This data can’t be accessed by the operating system on your device or by any applications running on it. And it is never stored on Apple servers or backed up to iCloud or anywhere else.\n\nFind My\n\nEnabling Find My for iPhone, iPad, and Mac helps keep you connected to your device, even if it’s lost or stolen. Find My is built in a way that protects your privacy. It’s enabled automatically when you sign in to iCloud on a new device. You can see where your device is on a map — and where it has been — so you improve your chances of recovering it. If you’re unable to get your device back, you can remotely erase the personal data on it. Apple receives this location information only when you locate your device, turn on Lost Mode, or enable Send Last Location. Location data is only retained for 24 hours so we can display the last known location of your device. Find My also automatically turns on Activation Lock, which requires your Apple ID to be entered before anyone can erase or reactivate your device.\n\nThe Find My network harnesses hundreds of millions of Apple devices with Bluetooth technology. It helps you detect missing devices or items near other Apple devices and reports their approximate location back to you. This entire process is end-to-end encrypted, so your missing device’s location and information remains protected from Apple and third-party manufacturers.\n\nTwo-factor authentication\n\nTwo-factor authentication is the best way to keep your information safe because it adds a second layer of security to your Apple ID. It’s designed to ensure that even someone who knows your password can’t access your account. When you sign in on a new device or from the web, a verification code will be displayed automatically on all your trusted devices. Enter this code along with your password and you’ll be signed in. Anyone who can’t provide both your password and the verification code will be kept out. Once signed in, you won’t be asked for a verification code on that device again unless you sign out completely, erase the device, or need to change your password for security reasons.\n\nAirTag alerts\n\niPhone will inform you of an AirTag that doesn’t belong to you but is detected to be traveling with you. Once it has been discovered, you can get instructions on how to disable it. To further guard against unwanted tracking, an AirTag separated from its owner for an extended period of time will play a sound to draw attention to it."
