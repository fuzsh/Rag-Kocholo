        "text": "The Healthcare Technology Report is pleased to announce The Top 100 Healthcare Technology Companies of 2022. The awardees on this year’s list represent the absolute best in the healthcare technology space. From companies like Novartis with more than 100,000 team members around the globe, to numerous smaller startups with just a few dozen employees in a single office, these companies are changing the face of the industry. They are leveraging their considerable talent to find innovative solutions to the most pressing issues in healthcare, and they are saving countless lives and extending healthspans in the process.\n\nSome of this year’s awardees include Hologic, whose growth across breast and skeletal health, diagnostic solutions, and GYN surgical solutions is driven by the clinically proven ability of its products to detect, diagnose, and treat illnesses and other health conditions earlier and better; Integra LifeSciences, which offers a broad portfolio of products and solutions for dural access and repair, cerebral spinal fluid management, and neuro-critical care; and Axtria, whose best-in-class cloud-based analytics platforms have leveraged AI and machine learning to help life sciences operators make the most of their data for the benefit of their clients.\n\nThe top 100 companies this year represent a range of specialties, from genomics to pharmaceuticals, lab testing, therapeutics, data analysis, and much more. What they have in common is the impact they are having on patients’ lives, whether through direct treatment or by providing advanced, game-changing products and services to treatment providers. They are driving the industry forward and creating an environment in which better care for all is possible. Please join us in celebrating The Top 100 Healthcare Technology Companies of 2022.\n\n1. Novartis\n\nCategory: Biotech\n\nAs one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, Novartis has continued to break new ground in delivering innovative medical solutions to almost 1 billion people around the world. It employs approximately 125,000 individuals in its international offices and production facilities, most notably from its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland and Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nNovartis was born out of the 1996 merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, and the new company quickly grew to push the boundaries of achievement in cancer-fighting drugs and other essential pharmaceutical products. The company has attracted a great deal of praise from industry and civil organizations for the benefits of its generic drugs, which have been praised by the Access to Medicine Index for widening access to medicine among underserved populations. Amid a difficult period for multinationals, Novartis has shown impressive growth in its major brands, and its continued developments in multiple sclerosis treatments have been met with international acclaim.\n\n2. Stryker\n\nCategory: Medical Devices\n\nMichigan-based medtech company Stryker is recognized as an industry leader in the field, designing and manufacturing devices used in hospitals and care facilities in more than 100 countries. Stryker’s main offerings are divided into the segments Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine, the latter of which has seen groundbreaking advances in recent years. Boasting more than 46,000 employees around the world, the company has posted a remarkable four decades of consistent growth over its lifetime, reporting over $17 billion in sales in 2021.\n\nFounded as the Orthopedic Frame Company by Kalamazoo orthopedist Dr. Homer Stryker in 1941, the company has made a name for itself in its production of medical devices that quickly become indispensable for modern health care. Stryker has frequently been hailed as a forward-thinking workplace, having been named to Fortune’s list of the world’s best workplaces five years in a row. Most recently, it has made waves with the launch of its new Global Technology Center, a unique 150,000-square-foot R&D facility in New Delhi designed to supercharge the company’s capacity to develop new life-saving innovations.\n\n3. Edwards Lifesciences\n\nCategory: Medical Devices\n\nEdwards Lifesciences is the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. Driven by a passion to help patients, the company collaborates with the world’s leading clinicians and researchers to address unmet healthcare needs, working to improve patient outcomes and enhance lives. As the pioneer of many products considered industry standard, including the transcatheter aortic valve replacement, Edwards’ products are sold in approximately 100 countries around the world. Founded by engineer Miles “Lowell” Edwards in 1958, the company has 16,000 employees around the world with manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Singapore, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe Edwards Lifesciences Foundation supported more than 250 global charities in 2021 and continued its work with Every Heartbeat Matters, the Foundation’s primary philanthropic initiative, to improve the lives of 2.5 million additional underserved structural heart and critical care patients by the end of 2025.\n\nTo advance social equity, Edwards established a Social Impact Investment Fund with $100 million to support economic development in predominantly Black and underserved communities in the U.S. When Edwards was established as a separate company from Baxter in 2000, the company was formed around a credo which serves as a reminder to always put patients first, and that as a company Edwards will remain committed to making a positive impact on the quality of life for patients around the world.\n\n4. Centura Health\n\nCategory: Consumer HealthTech\n\nFaith-based health care nonprofit Centura Health is known as a leader in high-quality health care services throughout Colorado and western Kansas. Its network of 17 hospitals and 6,000 physicians are responsible for delivering the best possible medical outcomes to traditionally underserved communities across the region. Centura traces its roots to a dedicated, compassionate order of Catholic sisters in 1882, and has pushed since its founding 25 years ago to deliver on that mission of building healthy people and communities.\n\nAs befits an organization that was founded on the value of altruistic service, Centura has developed a reputation as an invaluable supporter of local communities, launching initiatives to promote food security, mental and behavioral health, and rural community care. It has contributed a great deal of resources and attention to supporting community hospitals and rural communities in seven different countries, and recently issued a $5 million health equity and advancement grant to help regional organizations enhance health outcomes across the board.\n\n5. Hologic\n\nCategory: Medical Devices\n\nHeadquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Hologic and its team of more than 6,700 have created an innovative medical technology company whose purpose is to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day.

It does so by modernizing the diagnostic testing industry through a national network of labs and customized solutions. Included in its testing product lineup are: screenings for COVID-19, colorectal cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and infectious disease, to name a few.\n\nFounded in 2005, BioIQ has undergone several significant changes over the years. Formerly based in Santa Barbara, California, in 2019, it moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia.

Intarcia Therapeutics\n\nCategory: Biotech\n\nIntarcia Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for chronic diseases. It was founded in California in 1995 under the name BioMedicines—a name that it maintained until 2004, when company leaders decided to change it to its present form. Later, in 2013, the company went bicoastal by relocating its headquarters to Boston, while keeping its manufacturing facility in Hayward, California. Today, on top of Boston and Hayward, Intarcia also has a physical location in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where it continues to work on discovering and developing peptides for its drug delivery system.\n\nCurrently, the company's flagship product, Medici Drug Delivery System, has the potential to transform the prevention and management of serious chronic diseases.

Caption Health\n\nCategory: Software & Data\n\nFounded in 2013 and headquartered in Brisbane, California, Caption Health’s mission is to detect disease early—when there is the highest potential for impact—by leveraging artificial intelligence and ultrasound. Its team of best-in-class entrepreneurs, engineers, and clinicians are committed to transforming care, expanding access, and reducing costs.\n\nArtificial intelligence and ultrasound technologies are not new. Yet nobody had integrated the two to drive early disease detection and create better healthcare experiences until Caption Health. It makes imaging for early disease detection possible, thus supporting an informed and personalized care pathway that saves time, resources, and positively impacts lives.\n\nUltrasound can be difficult to master—taking years of specialized training to learn—and image quality can vary. Simply performing the exam involves unnatural hand-eye coordination and unintuitive visuals. Traditional ultrasound software doesn’t provide instruction on how to move the ultrasound transducer to capture an image, or any real-time feedback on the quality of images being captured. However, with Caption Health’s technology, any healthcare professional can capture diagnostic-quality ultrasound images thanks to AI guiding them through every step of the scanning and image-capture process in real time.\n\n79. Transcenta\n\nCategory: Biotech\n\nIn September 2021, Transcenta Holding was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

Since then, Transcenta has become one of China's unequivocal success stories.\n\nAlready, the company has established a global footprint with numerous locations around the world, including in China's biggest cities. Furthermore, the company has opened physical locations in Boston, Princeton, and Los Angeles. As a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, Transcenta fully integrates antibody-based biotherapeutics discovery, research, development, and manufacturing.
