        "text": "The term âInternet of Thingsâ or IoT was first coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999. But it was only when Gartner added IoT to its list of new emerging technologies in 2011, that it started to gain global momentum. As of 2021, there were 21.7 billion active connected devices in the world today, out of which more than 11.7 billion (54 percent) are IoT devices. This means that there are more IoT devices in the world than there are non-IoT devices.\n\nHave a look at the video below that will help you understand IoT and how it works.\n\nWhat is IoT?\n\nIoT is an umbrella term that refers to the billions of physical objects or âthingsâ connected to the Internet, all collecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.Â\n\nWhile IoT has been in existence since the 90s, recent advances in a number of different technologies have made it more practical, such as:\n\nAccess to affordable and reliable sensors\n\nIncrease in the availability of cloud computing platforms\n\nAdvances in machine learning and AI technologies.\n\nIoT devices can range from small ordinary household cooking appliances to sophisticated industrial tools. Each IoT component has a Unique Identifier (UID) and they can also transmit data without the assistance of humans.\n\nTypes of IoT\n\nThe networking, communication and connectivity protocols depend largely on the specific IoT application deployed. Just as there are many different IoT devices, there are many types of IoT applications based on their usage. Here are some of the most common ones:\n\nConsumer IoT - Primarily for everyday use. Eg: home appliances, voice assistance, and light fixtures.Â\n\nCommercial IoT - Primarily used in the healthcare and transport industries. Eg: smart pacemakers and monitoring systems.Â\n\nMilitary Things (IoMT) - Primarily used for the application of IoT technologies in the military field. Eg: surveillance robots and human-wearable biometrics for combat.\n\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT) - Primarily used with industrial applications, such as in the manufacturing and energy sectors. Eg: Digital control systems, smart agriculture and industrial big data.Â\n\nInfrastructure IoT - Primarily used for connectivity in smart cities.Â Eg: infrastructure sensors and management systems.Â\n\nBecome a Software Development Professional\n\n13 % CAGR\n\n30 %\n\nFull Stack Java Developer Masters Program\n\nKickstart Full Stack Java Developer career with industry-aligned curriculum by experts\n\nHands-on practice through 20+ projects, assessments, and tests\n\nFull Stack Web Developer - MEAN Stack\n\nComprehensive Blended Learning program\n\n8X higher interaction in live online classes conducted by industry experts\n\nprevNext\n\nHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\n\nMayur Kharad\n\nProduct Engineer , IKS Health\n\nDuring the lockdown, I realized I needed to upskill myself, and my journey with Simplilearn has been fantastic. I learned many things during the full stack java developer course, thanks to trainer Virendra Sharma. I've always wanted to work in this sector, and after completing my certification in Fullstack Java Development, I got placed at IKS Health through Simplilearn.\n\nManish Maccha\n\nSoftware Engineer , SolvenTek\n\nI was looking for a new job with a better salary and position, so I knew I needed to upskill. My experience with Simplilearn was very good. Each topic was innovative and interesting, with quality content. After completing the full stack java developer course, I landed a new job with Neo Geo Info Technologies with a 30% salary hike.\n\nprevNext\n\nNot sure what youâre looking for?View all Related Programs\n\nWhy is IoT Important?\n\nIoT has made it possible for the physical world to meet the digital world and cooperate with each other. It offers numerous benefits to organizations by enabling them to automate and simplify their daily tasks.Â\n\nAs IoT grows exponentially year on year, companies are leveraging the tremendous business values it can offer. Here are some of the most important benefits of IoT:\n\nTo generate new business models and revenue streams\n\nTo improve business decisions through data-driven insights from IoT dataÂ\n\nTo increase productivity and efficiency of business operations\n\nTo enhance customer experience\n\nAlthough the worldwide spending on IoT has been significantly impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a study by IDC shows that it will achieve a CAGR of 11.3 percent over the 2020-2024 forecast period.\n\nWhat Are IoT Devices?\n\nIoT devices are hardware devices, such as sensors, gadgets, appliances and other machines that collect and exchange data over the Internet. They are programmed for certain applications and can be embedded into other IoT devices. For example, an IoT device in your car can identify the traffic ahead and send out a message automatically to the person you are about to meet of your impending delay.Â\n\nHow do IoT Devices Work?\n\nDifferent IoT devices have different functions, but they all have similarities in terms of how they work. Firstly, IoT devices are physical objects that sense things going on in the physical world. They contain an integrated CPU, network adapter and firmware, and are usually connected to a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server. It also requires an IP address to function over the network.Â\n\nMost IoT devices are configured and managed through a software application. For example, an app on your smartphone to control the lights in your home. Some devices also have integrated web servers, which eliminates the need for external applications. For example, the lights switch on immediately when you enter a room.Â\n\nExamples of IoT Devices\n\nHome SecurityÂ\n\nThe key driver behind smart and secure homes is IoT. A variety of sensors, lights, alarms and cameras (all of which can be controlled from a smartphone) are connected via IoT to provide 24x7 security.Â\n\nActivity TrackersÂ\n\nSmart home security cameras provide alerts and peace of mind. Activity trackers are sensor devices that can monitor and transmit key health indicators in real-time. You can track and manage your blood pressure, appetite, physical movement and oxygen levels.Â\n\nIndustrial Security and Safety\n\nIoT-enabled detection systems, sensors and cameras can be placed in restricted areas to detect trespassers. They can also identify pressure buildups and small leaks of hazardous chemicals and fix them before they become serious problems.\n\nAugmented Reality GlassesÂ\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) glasses are wearable computer-enabled glasses that help you get extra information such as 3D animations and videos to the user's real-world scenes. The information is presented within the lenses of the glasses and can help users access Internet applications.\n\nMotion Detection\n\nMotion sensors can detect vibrations in buildings, bridges, dams and other large-scale structures. These devices can identify anomalies and disturbances in the structures that could lead to catastrophic failures. They can also be used in areas susceptible to floods, landslides, and earthquakes.\n\nBecome a Data Scientist by learning from the best with Simplilearnâs Caltech Post Graduate Program In Data Science.
