These allow providers across the world to monitor patients and administer proactive care. These sensors are worn on the body and monitor vital health signs like temperature and heart rate to give healthcare providers more information and insights on the progression of diseases, illnesses, and overall health.\n\nThese biosensors helped the world track the spread of COVID-19 by monitoring patients to detect symptoms and other signs of the virus. Medical staff could monitor patient data thanks to the devices and avoid unnecessary exposure.\n\n2. Telehealth and Remote Care\n\nUp to 78% of patients reported feeling satisfied about their experience with telehealth services. Additionally, 68% of physicians say they’d like to increase the use of telehealth in their practice.\n\nMany of us are now familiar with telehealth, which became a popular choice for healthcare providers and patients during the pandemic. With the help of conferencing technology, providers could virtually treat patients over video call, provide prescriptions, and perform follow-up visits.\n\nPart of this virtual care was the use of medical portal technology to build secure online healthcare portals to help providers and patients track treatment, store health records, and collect and access data from wearable devices or clinic visits.\n\nWhile the use of telehealth and remote care became prevalent after the onset of the Covid pandemic, it is clear that both patients and practitioners have found benefits in the use of this technology and hospitals will continue to use it.\n\n“Telemedicine significantly decreased odds of ICU mortality.” – Critical Care Medicine\n\n3. Connected Emergency Response Solutions\n\nConnectivity can greatly improve the efficiency and response times of emergency care, something that can be the difference between life and death. With modern healthcare smart technology, it’s possible to share data between ambulances, physicians, first responders, and accident and emergency departments in a reasonable amount of time that facilitates real-time responses.\n\nThis technology enables faster communication, video calls with doctors from inside ambulances, quicker patient histories, and easier hospital admittance with history and conditions already established.\n\nOn arrival, doctors can already have patient data on-hand—including vital signs, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc.\n\n4. Smart Hospital Management\n\nSmart hospital management can help improve efficiency and effectiveness, improve patient experience, and help doctors by connecting digital systems to make it easier to access information like bed occupancy, device usage, equipment status, materials and supply counts, and other operational data.\n\nTracking this information and using it in decision-making can improve resource management, reduce waste, and help hospital staff avoid not having what’s needed due to bad tracking or incorrect data collection.\n\nSmart hospitals are going to play an incredibly important role in the future of healthcare using a series of sophisticated technologies such as AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and telehealth.\n\nThe IoT\n\nIn the realm of smart hospitals and digital transformation in healthcare, the Internet of Things serves as a driving force. By allowing medical devices and sensors to communicate with one another, hospitals gain real-time insights into patient health. This facilitates something we covered earlier, remote patient monitoring, allowing healthcare providers to track vital signs, manage chronic conditions, and intervene proactively.\n\nAdditionally, IoT streamlines hospital operations by optimizing asset tracking – ensuring medical equipment availability and functionality. Energy management is also improved, with IoT systems self-regulating energy consumption for cost-efficiency.\n\nLastly, patient flow within the hospital is also enhanced as IoT-enabled systems track movements, minimizing wait times and improving overall operational efficiency.\n\nIoT forms the foundation for smart hospitals, fostering connectivity and data exchange for better patient care and operational excellence.\n\nAI\n\nArtificial Intelligence stands at the forefront of innovation, and smart hospitals are no exception. AI's capacity to analyze vast datasets expedites diagnostic processes, aiding healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely decisions.\n\nThis technology also powers predictive analytics that enable the identification of potential health risks, giving patients more preventative care options. On the patient-experience side of things, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants enhance patient engagement, providing instant responses to queries, appointment scheduling, and very basic advisory ability.\n\nOn the administrative front, AI automates tasks like billing and data entry, streamlining operations. This not only frees up valuable time for healthcare providers but also contributes to a more efficient and patient-centric healthcare environment.\n\nAI plays the role of the cognitive powerhouse here, augmenting healthcare capabilities and improving outcomes across the board.\n\nMHealth\n\nMobile Health (MHealth) is a pillar when it comes to patient-centric care in smart hospitals. With the widespread popularity of smartphones, MHealth applications empower patients to actively participate in their well-being.\n\nRemote patient monitoring becomes seamless, as individuals can track health metrics and share real-time data with healthcare providers.
