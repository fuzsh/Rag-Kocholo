For e-commerce logistics, logistic labels donâ€™t need to be fancy. These labels are purely functional and contain important information about a product or parcel to make sure they are easy to identify, register, track, and trace.

From simple blank labels for printing barcodes or QR codes to smart labels using technologies like RFID, at Asteria, we have a long tradition of making sure you get what you need when you need it, always for the best price.
