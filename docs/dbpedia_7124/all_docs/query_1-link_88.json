        "text": "UCC-128 Label Format\n\nThe UCC-128 is a code on an item that tells any computer all about it. It uses shortcuts called Application Identifiers (AI) to share important details, including the item expiration date, item quantity and item weight. The UCC-128 acts as an advanced label that can provide various details about the item when it’s scanned.\n\nHow is the UCC-128 used?\n\nThe UCC-128, now called GS1-128, is a special kind of barcode that stores information about things you buy. This can include where the items came from and when they should be sold by.\n\nHere’s why it’s really useful:\n\nAre you a developer?\n\nIf you’ve got an advanced technology team who understands APIs (application programming interface) then you should check out our Dev Center. We have API connections for Shipping Labels, Packing Slips and Order Transactions which are always up-to-date with your customers’ trading partner requirements.\n\nWhether your trading partner is asking you to comply, or your business is looking to implement the GS1-128 labels into your supply chain, your next step is to find a solution that makes the labels easier to build.\n\nYou could log into FedEx or UPS to create your labels for each individual order—or you could use an EDI solution that has that technology included.\n\nInterested in learning more?"
