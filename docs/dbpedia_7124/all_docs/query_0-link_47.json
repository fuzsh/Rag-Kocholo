        "text": "Localize Commerce extension resources and label files\n\nThis article explains how to modify labels in the point of sale (POS) user interface (UI), POS messages (error, warning, and information), receipt labels, and error messages for Commerce Scale Unit or Commerce Runtime Services (CRT). You can also add custom error messages for in the same way. However, for new POS extension labels, you should use the localization framework in the POS extension.\n\nPOS labels and messages (error, warning, and information)\n\nThis section explains how to modify POS UI labels and POS messages by overriding the default strings.\n\nOverride POS UI labels and messages\n\nYou can override the default strings in the POS by using the language text entries on the Language text page. Follow these steps to change POS strings.\n\nSign in to Commerce.\n\nGo to Retail and Commerce > Channel setup > POS setup > POS profiles > Language text.\n\nOn the Language text page, on the POS tab, in the POS language text grid, select the Add button to add the language ID, text ID, and text for the string that you want to override.\n\nFor example, you want to change the label of the Operator ID field on the POS sign-in page to Employee ID for US English (en-us). In this case, add the following entry in the POS language text grid.\n\nLanguage ID Text ID Text en-us 502 Employee ID\n\nNote\n\nFor information about how to get the text ID for POS strings, see the next section.\n\nOn the Action Pane, select Save.\n\nGo to Retail and Commerce > Retail and Commerce IT > Distribution schedule.\n\nSelect the Registers (1090) job, and then select Run now.\n\nAfter the data is pushed, you'll need to wait up to one hour for the localized string cache to refresh. When the refresh of the string cache is complete, sign out and sign back in to Store Commerce to display the changed labels. You can also force a cache refresh by restarting Retail Server.\n\nGet the text ID for POS strings\n\nTo get the text ID for a POS string, open Store Commerce for web. Press F12 to launch the developer command tools and select the Console tab to open the JavaScript console. Run the Commerce.Helpers.DeveloperModeHelper.setDeveloperMode(true); command in the JavaScript console to turn on the developer mode.\n\nAfter enabling the developer mode in the JavaScript console, navigate to the Settings page in POS, under the Developer mode, set Developer Mode to Yes. Set Show Strings IDs to Yes. Sign out of the POS, and then sign in again. The POS now shows the strings IDs in front of all the labels and messages.\n\nError messages or receipt strings\n\nThis section explains how to modify error messages, or receipt strings, by overriding the default strings. It also explains how you can add new, custom error messages, or receipt strings.\n\nOverride error messages or receipt strings\n\nSign in to Commerce.\n\nGo to Retail and Commerce > Channel setup > POS setup > POS profiles > Language text.\n\nOn the Language text page, click the Add button to add the language ID, text ID, and text for the string that you want to override.\n\nFor example, when users enter an incorrect user name or password during sign-in, the POS shows the following error message: \"We didn't recognize the user name or password. Please try again.\" For US English, you want to change the message to \"Please enter valid user name or password.\" In this case, add the following entry in the language text grid.\n\nLanguage ID Text ID Text en-us Microsoft_Dynamics_Commerce_Runtime_InvalidAuthenticationCredentials Please enter valid user name or password\n\nNote\n\nFor information about how to get the text ID for error messages and receipt strings, see the next section.\n\nOn the Action Pane, select Save.\n\nGo to Retail and Commerce > Retail and Commerce IT > Distribution schedule.\n\nSelect the Registers (1090) job, and then select Run now.\n\nGet the text ID for messages or receipt strings\n\nGo to â¦\\RetailSDK\\Documents\\Resources.\n\nIn Visual Studio, open one of the following resource files:\n\nTo modify error messages: RuntimeExceptionMessages.resx\n\nTo modify receipt strings: RuntimeReceiptMessages.resx\n\nFor every message in the resource file, Visual Studio shows a name and a value.\n\nIn the Value column, search for the text that you want to change.\n\nCopy the name that corresponds to that value. You enter this name as the text ID in the language text grid.\n\nAdd custom error messages or receipt strings\n\nYou can also add new error messages or new receipt strings, on the Language text page. In this way, you support localization instead of hard-coding everything in the code.\n\nFor example, you want to add a new exception message in US English (en-us) and UK English (en-uk). In this case, add entries that resemble the follow entries on the Language text page.\n\nLanguage ID Text ID Text en-us Microsoft_Dynamics_Commerce_CustomId1 My new message in US English en-uk Microsoft_Dynamics_Commerce_CustomId1 My new message in UK English\n\nThe following example shows how to use this new message in your CRT extension code."
