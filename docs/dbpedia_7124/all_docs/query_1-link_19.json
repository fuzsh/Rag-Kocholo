Labels provide information to the customer. The process of putting identification marks on the package is known as Labelling. Labelling includes information like the name of the products, expiry and manufacturing date, instructions for use, weight, price, etc.\n\nTypes of Labels\n\nLabels can be of the following types:\n\nSimple Tag: Such tags are usually attached to local products like sugar, wheat, pulses, etc. They provide basic information about the quality or price of the product.\n\nElaborate Tag or Descriptive Tag: Such tags are used by branded products. They provide detailed information about the use, performance, features, etc., of the product.\n\nSometimes statutory warnings which are essential for products, like cigarettes, tobacco, liquor, etc., are also printed on the label. For example, ‘Smoking causes throat cancer’ is mentioned on the cigarette label.\n\nFunctions of Labels\n\nDescribe the product and specify its contents: Since the customers cannot meet each and every customer personally, labelling is used to communicate and share information about the product to the customer. All the information related to the product such as content, price, instructions to use, etc., is printed on the product by the manufacturer. For example, labels of ready-to-eat food products have a complete description of how to serve the food.\n\nIdentify the products and brands: Identification of products from various types of products available in the market can be easily done with the help of labelling. A label helps a customer to identify the product. For example, Amul products can be easily identified because of the Amul girl printed on the label.\n\nHelps in grading: Products can be graded with the help of label. For example, Amul milk is of different types: Amul full-toned milk, Amul Full cream, Amul Gold, etc.\n\nPromotes sales: Label attracts customers and promotes sales. They also help in promotional schemes, like 25% extra, Buy 2 get 1 free, 4 kg + 2 kg free, etc.\n\nProvides information required by law/ legal requirements: Legal requirements are also fulfilled with the help of labelling as it is a legal compulsion to print batch number, content, MRP, weight, volume, etc. There is also a legal compulsion to provide statutory warning in case of certain products, like cigarettes, liquor, etc. Appropriate safety warnings should be mentioned on the labels of hazardous goods. For example, the Danger (Skull and Crossbones) symbol is mentioned on the label of rat kill.\n\nPlease Login to comment..."
