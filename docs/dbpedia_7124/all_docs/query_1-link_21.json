        "text": "Last update: Mon Jul 17 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nCommerce includes a high level of integration with major shipping carriers, which gives you access to carrier shipping systems to track orders, create shipping labels, and more. Shipping labels can be created for regular shipments and products with return merchandise authorization. In addition to the information provided by the shipping carrier, the label also includes the Commerce order number, number of the package, and the total quantity of packages for the shipment.\n\nShipping label workflow\n\nShipping labels can be produced at the time a shipment is created, or later. Shipping labels are stored in PDF format and are downloaded to your computer.\n\nStep 1: Merchant submits shipping label request\n\nThe merchant/store manager completes the information necessary to generate labels, and submits the request.\n\nStep 2: Request sent to carrier\n\nCommerce contacts the shipping carrier, and creates an order in the carrierâ€™s system. A separate order is created for each package that is shipped.\n\nStep 3: Carrier sends label and tracking number\n\nThe carrier sends the shipping label and tracking number for the shipment."
