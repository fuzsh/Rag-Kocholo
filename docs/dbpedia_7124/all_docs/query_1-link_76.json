        "text": "Hi Extensions board,\n\nLike many other Dynatrace users, we have started to look into the JMX extension and the 2.0 framework, seeing the current builtin metrics will deprecate soon. I was watching the Observability Clinic \"A Practical Guide to JMX Monitoring with Dynatrace\" featuring James Kipson from Dynatrace to get an idea of how to setup this new extension.\n\nWe will use the Dynatrace provided JMX Extensions for Tomcat & Weblogic, and use the out of the box metrics they provide. This is why I hope the new Extension approach will provide the same metrics we have had untill now. I dont see us writing our own Extensions in the foreseeable future.\n\nChallenge 1:\n\nWe have a hard time getting the new extension to work flawlessly, and logs does not provide much help either. I have enabled the required OneAgent features (JMX Metrics Extension 2.0) as well as the Extension Controller.\n\nI have two processes where the connection pool metrics get data, but the new App Server- and Thread metrics introduced in version 2.2.1 does not return any data. We have these metrics available through the old view.\n\nChallenge 2:\n\nI have Tomcat processes where neither connection pool, web request or thread metrics work. The configuration is stuck in pending, and the only log output says \"Monitoring configuration updated\". The processes have been restarted many times, and frankly I dont know how to adress this issue from here.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nToday we have the option on a Tomcat process level to click the \"Further details\" and get metrics on threads. We utilize this alot! With the new extension the approach seem to be on the process view, click the options button (3 dots) and choose Metrics and log analysis. This navigation feel less intuitive than the old navigation. Is this change permanent, or something the will be improved in the future?\n\nThank you very much for any help provided.\n\nCopenhagen - Denmark"
