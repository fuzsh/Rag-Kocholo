        "text": "Who We Are\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States is the world’s largest business organization. Our members range from the small businesses and chambers of commerce across the country that support their communities, to the leading industry associations and global corporations that innovate and solve for the world’s challenges, to the emerging and fast-growing industries that are shaping the future. For all of the people across the businesses we represent, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a trusted advocate, partner, and network, helping them improve society and people’s lives.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nSince our founding, the U.S. Chamber has advocated for policies that help businesses create jobs and grow our economy. Building on a strong legacy of trust and track record of success, we help today’s businesses start, grow, and thrive in a complex and constantly changing macro environment. We inform our members with timely policy analysis and legal advice, connect them with leaders in business and government through world-class events and intimate gatherings, and equip them with tools and resources to help them succeed. Above all, we serve as their ally and champion on Capitol Hill, in the courts, in the state houses, and in markets around the world. No matter who or where our members are, we are their seat at the table and voice in the debate.\n\nWe advocate, connect, inform, and fight for business growth and America’s success.\n\nWhat We Believe\n\nWhile the country has changed since the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was established over a century ago, our foundational belief has not. We believe in the ability of American businesses to improve lives, solve problems, and strengthen society. And throughout the years, a clear pattern has emerged. When citizens, business leaders, and government officials work together, America works. There are greater opportunities for better jobs, new industries, and fairer laws. Communities thrive, the economy grows, and our nation’s positive influence in the world increases. When that partnership breaks down, those opportunities and the country’s optimism fade."
