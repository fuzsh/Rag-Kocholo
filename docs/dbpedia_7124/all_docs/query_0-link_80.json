Based upon the products or content customers order and engage with, the brand can pivot and digitally curate future messaging within all active channels to better serve customer needs and expectations.\n\nTo achieve unified commerce, brands must invest in the total connectivity of all technologies to capture customer sentiment and preference over time, thereby allowing the brand to pivot messaging by channel to maximize conversation and conversions.\n\nThis unified commerce ideology will become the future table stakes relationship driver between brand and consumer. As the world becomes more connected, customer demand experiences that go beyond just adding products to the cart and checking out – they expect interaction, engagement and conversation – all of which will increase customer lifetime value and revenue."
