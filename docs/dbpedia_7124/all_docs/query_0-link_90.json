        "text": "1.1 ⇛ 1.2 Adjustment of criteria\n\nThe section “What can carry the Nordic Swan Ecolabel” has been adjusted as well as the requirements O1, O7 and O18. There is a minor change in Appendix 1.\n\n1.0 ⇛ 1.1 Adjustment of criteria\n\nSeveral adjustments have been made:\n\nRequirement O3 and O4: the least hired subcontractors, which in total amount to a maximum of 20% of the cost of all purchased transports may be exempted from the requirement O4, and from point c, d and e in requirement O3.\n\nRequirement O9: a limit was introduced which means that 95% (instead of 100%) of the biodiesel volume must be documented free of feedstocks with a high iLUC risk\n\nRequirement O10: The requirement for follow-up of subcontractors was harmonized with requirement O13\n\nRequirement O15: the license holder's requirements on subcontractors only apply to points 3, 4 and 5 (not points 1 and 2).\n\nThe new version is called 1.1 and valid until 31 march 2027.\n\n1.0: New product group\n\nNordic Ecolabelling adopted version 1.0 of the criteria for 111 E-commerce logistics on 7 March 2023.\n\nThe criteria is valid until 31 March 2027.\n\nIn the background document below you will find reasoning and facts behind the specific requirements in the criteria document.\n\nHere you can also read the comments, requirement for requirement, from the public hearing.\n\nIf the documents are in a Nordic language, you can get help in understanding the sections you need by contacting the product specialist in your chosen country below.\n\nBackground document\n\nEnglish / 1.2\n\nConsultation comments\n\nSwedish / 1.2\n\nOnline shopping has grown strongly in the last decade. When we choose delivery option, we as private individuals have become transport selectors. The climate issue is an extremely important issue, as are energy efficiency, fuel and the electrification of vehicles. Another important sustainability issue is employment conditions and working conditions for the drivers who carry out the transports. In addition, there are unclear and unverified environmental claims for e-commerce deliveries in the checkout.\n\nThese are the most important reasons why Nordic Ecolabelling has developed criteria for a completely new area, e-commerce logistics. The goal is to guide online shopping consumers in the Nordics to a credible and more sustainable delivery option through the Nordics' official environmental label, the Nordic Swan Ecolabel.\n\nNo. The Nordic Swan Ecolabel covers the entire national network of e-commerce transportation of one operator. An actor does not have to cover the entire country to become a licensee, it is enough to have a coverage rate of at least 50% of that country's inhabitants, but an actor's network / system cannot be divided into smaller pieces that are ecolabelled.\n\nAnother important principle is that a licensee must be responsible for both long-distance (line-haul transport) and delivery to the customer (last mile transport).\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to make effective demands on returns when the labelling covers your transport network. The number of returns is mainly influenced by our buying behaviours. Also the e-commerce companies can do a lot to reduce unnecessary returns, such as charging for return transport, having clear size specifications and shutting down the few consumers who systematically abuse the right to return. Many e-commerce companies in the Nordics work actively in this area.\n\nE-commerce differs from retail because goods are often transported directly from the warehouse to the end consumer and not via a store. This means that the consumer not only receives the packaging around the product itself, but also the transport packaging (secondary packaging), which in turn increases resource use and waste quantities. Effective packaging of an e-sold item is an important prerequisite for an overall good level of filling in the cars. But it is the e-commerce company that decides on the packaging and that packs before transport. One of the requirements for the Nordic Swan Ecolabel create financial incentives for e-commerce to make the packaging more efficient and reduce the amount of air in the transport packaging.\n\nRenewable fuels (biofuels) reduce the climate impact compared to fossil fuels. Renewable raw materials in fuel can have a negative impact on climate, biological diversity and soil conditions in the countries where the raw material is produced. At the same time, they can be based on residual products and have a very low climate impact. From a life cycle perspective, they can therefore be both really good but also really bad. For the actual climate benefit to become real and for biofuel production not to compete with food and feed cultivation, there are minimum requirements for climate performance in the European Renewable Energy Directive (REDII).\n\nIn the Renewable Energy Directive, ambitious requirements have been introduced which will gradually phase out raw materials with so-called high ILUC risk (ILUC = Indirect Land Use Change). In the Nordic Swan Ecolabel, these raw materials are already prohibited. Currently, the EU only assesses primary palm oil as a raw material with a high ILUC risk. PFAD, a by-product from palm oil production, is handled in slightly different ways in the legislation of the different Nordic countries. In these criteria for e-commerce logistics, the Nordic Ecolabel harmonize with national classifications of PFAD. For Sweden, Denmark and Norway this means that PFAD is classified as a raw material with high risk of ILUC but not in Finland. Hence, the criteria prohibit primary palm oil and PFAD in Sweden, Denmark and Norway (95 %). In Finland primary palm oil is prohibited. This is compensated by more ambitious requirements for Finland in other parts of the criteria.\n\nIt is not possible to set the requirement for sustainable raw materials in renewable fuels as strict in Finland as in other Nordic countries because, unlike other countries in the EU, they still classify PFAD as a residual product (and not a by-/co-product). There is also no mass balance system established on the Finnish market. For Nordic Swan Ecolabel e-commerce transport not to lead to an increased demand for PFAD in Finland, other requirements partly apply. The requirement for a share of renewable energy does not apply at all to Finnish companies. This is compensated by the fact that the requirements for vehicle fleets, new investments in vehicles and home deliveries have been adapted to be extra driving for performer in Finland.\n\nTo consume sustainably, everyone should ask themselves before a purchase decision: Can I repair what I already have? Do I need to buy a new one? If the answer is \"yes\", choose ecolabelled for reduced impact on the environment. And now there is also the opportunity to choose an ecolabelled delivery option when Nordic consumers shop online."
