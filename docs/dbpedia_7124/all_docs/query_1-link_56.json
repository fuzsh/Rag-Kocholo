        "text": "Are you familiar with white label vs private label? Designing and manufacturing your own products and selling them on your eCommerce website is an adventure in and of itself. Once you have a minimum viable product (MVP), an eCommerce SEO strategy and eCommerce PPC can get you initial traffic that leads to sales.Â\n\nBut what if you didnât need to spend time producing your own goods? Is there a way to be profitable without creating new products? There is, and itâs called private labeling. Private labeling is when one business sells goods to another business that markets and sells them under different branding.Â\n\nLearning about white label vs private label and how to leverage it is an important step in discovering how to become a wholesaler, how to run a dropshipping business, or starting an eCommerce business. Read the essentials of private labeling, how itâs used, and white label vs private label.\n\nWhite Label vs Private Label\n\nWhen it comes to white label vs private label, note that private labeling is different from white labeling. Private labeling is when a product line is sold exclusively through one retailer, like AmazonBasics. White labeling is the process of selling a generic product to multiple retailers, who brand and price the product for their target market.Â\n\nPrivate Label Definition: What Does Private Label Mean?\n\nPrivate labeling is when a supplier or manufacturer produces goods that are retailed, packaged, and sold exclusively by a third party. This means that the first company profits by selling goods to third parties, and the third party profits by selling to consumers.Â Private labeling is used widely in today's eCommerce landscape, including for private label dropshipping.\n\nBenefits of Private Label vs White Label\n\nThe private label process is useful for a variety of reasons. One, it allows companies strong in manufacturing capability to maximize their profits. They donât need to worry about heavy marketing and retailing when they can sell products to companies that are skilled in these areas.Â This is one of the biggest differences when it comes to white label vs private label.\n\nTwo, it provides companies that donât yet have work in process inventory or finished goods inventory products to sell. When you donât need to produce the goods yourself, you can commit more time to your eCommerce marketing strategy and reading how to increase eCommerce sales. It also makes questions like, âIs dropshipping worth it?â much easier to answer, because thereâs less work to do on your part.\n\nThis principle benefits parties throughout the supply chain, as well. Wholesalers profit when their products reach B2B (see B2B meaning) and direct to consumer companies, often through an online marketplace. This means wholesale marketing strategies and growing wholesale sales are of primary focus for these companies.Â\n\nThree, it makes concerns like wholesale vs. retail price easier to resolve. When a third party buys goods from a supplier, often through a wholesale purchase agreement, they donât have complicated costs to cover in pricing. They simply need to include the expense of acquiring the product--which is part of the cost of goods sold--and add a margin (see markup vs margin).Â\n\nPrivate labeling is common in industries of all kinds, from food and electronics to information products and clothing. Itâs a practice that allows businesses of any size and scope to retain their key competitive advantages.Â\n\nMost wholesalers are happy to sell raw materials inventory that a third party later sells as merchandise inventory, by way of private labeling. It gives businesses all throughout the supply chain an opportunity to sustainably grow profit and maintain a high fill rate.Â\n\nWhen a customer purchases a privately labeled product, unless theyâve done extensive research, they wonât be aware of this. Generally, private labeling doesnât affect customers at all. If anything, private labeling allows retailers to spend more time on eCommerce marketing and branding--the main vehicle for generating consumer interest.\n\nWhat Is a Private Label Brand?\n\nA private label brand is a business devoted to creating products that third parties can sell as their own. They donât market, brand, or retail any of their own goods. They are focused solely on manufacturing products that are sold to other companies, who sell them to other businesses or consumers.Â\n\nPrivate label brands also support kitting, which is the process of packaging related products in the same box. This gives a third party increased flexibility in what kinds of products they sell and in what ways.Â\n\nPrivate label companies are typically not in close contact with people other than the businesses working with them, or individuals who love industry research and reading eCommerce books. This is to everyoneâs benefit, as it reduces confusion and builds brand loyalty. Keep this in mind when understanding the difference of white label vs private label.\n\nPrivate Label Brands Are Developed and Managed By...\n\nPrivate label brands are developed and managed by retailers. Naturally, the term âretailâ is broad and can imply everything from a retail store chain down to the individual staff members working in a store. A retail office is composed of various team member specialties that ensure private label goods achieve maximum ROI.Â\n\nSupply chain specialists are responsible for managing how raw goods are transformed into ready-made products for selling, and every step in between. These professionals oversee the stages of private label goods in order to become successful in-store brands.Â\n\nSupply chains are complex and involve numerous moving parts on any given day. There are material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, government agencies, wholesalers, retailers, and more. Supply chain experts ensure each element is in cooperation with the others, including wholesalers.\n\nInformation products are private label products that aren't managed by supply chain specialists. Information products, like eBooks, courses, and audio downloads, are used by many types of eCommerce businesses. These products answer a specific question (or multiple) for the person who bought them. They can also be bought, modified, and sold without involving physical supply chains. This is a crucial part of white label vs private label.\n\nPrivate Label vs. Brand\n\nWhen thinking about private label vs. brand, numerous differences come to mind. Itâs important to understand the differences in order to market your business properly.Â\n\nHere are the primary differences:Â\n\nPrivate label products are sold with no branding; branded goods are marketed via specific product characteristics.Â\n\nPrivate label companies profit by selling manufactured goods to other businesses; brands profit through their productsâ margin revenue.Â\n\nPrivate label companies usually sell only to other businesses; brands may sell as a B2B business or a B2C business.Â\n\nPrivate Label Brands Examples\n\nKnowing how powerful private labeling can be, youâre probably thinking about examples of private label brands. While some private label companies donât advertise their goods, youâd be surprised at the businesses right under your nose.Â\n\nHere are some private label brand examples:Â\n\nIKEA (assemble-your-own home and office furniture)\n\nOriginal Use (young menâs street clothing)\n\nTesco Everyday Value (pre-packaged grocery store items)\n\nUniversal Thread (womenâs denim)\n\nPrologue (working womenâs clothing)\n\nHeyday (consumer electronics)\n\nSmartly (everyday consumer products)\n\nMost Successful Private Label Brands\n\nWhile private labeling can help any venture become profitable, there are a few companies that stand out.
