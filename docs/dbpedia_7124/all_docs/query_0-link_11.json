        "text": "Where commerce, content and culture meet\n\n67% of global consumers expect companies to address their changing needs in new ways.\n\nThink of the experiences that people have on platforms. We can buy products, watch movies, play games, listen to music, get fashion advice, check the weather, purchase groceries, watch live sports and more. It’s commerce. It’s culture. It’s fun. It’s informative. It’s one seamless experience.\n\nAnd in a world where people see it on social, research it on Amazon, shop it in stores and share it on Instagram, partnerships between retailers and media players are bringing commerce, content and culture even closer.\n\nBrands have had to adapt to more significant changes in the last three years than in the last decade. One of their biggest creative challenges today? Transforming how brand and performance marketing is done to bring creative concepts to commerce.\n\nBrand experience is for commerce. Commerce is for brand experience.\n\nThe case for creative commerce\n\nIt’s non-negotiable to build brands for commerce instead of simply being brands that are in commerce.\n\nWhere there’s commerce, there’s brand experience. Yet for many traditional brands, product details are on product display pages (PDPs)—the focal points of entire buying journeys. But brand experiences aren’t.\n\nOn the other hand, consider what digital native brands are doing in commerce. Their PDPs are product experience pages (PXPs). Brand experiences move as their customers do, from URLs to IRL back to URLs.\n\nA critical reminder: This marriage of performance marketing and brand marketing isn’t just for B2C companies. All customers are people first—B2B is B2C is D2C. That makes creative commerce non-negotiable for all digital marketing."
