        "text": "We've been working with Blend for well over a year now. We were looking for a growth agency with excellent experience in Shopify, and Blend has most certainly fulfilled that need.\n\nThey have truly been an extension of our digital team over the past months, providing complete re-designs of key areas across our websites, countless optimisations, and ongoing improvements and maintenance.\n\nFrom their development support to design and marketing, they have exceeded expectations and driven great results. They're true digital experts, as well as being the most friendly and supportive team.\n\nSpecial mention to Kelly, who is the loveliest and most helpful human you’ll have the pleasure of working with, her ability to ease stress and communicate even the most technical of updates knows no bounds.\n\nIf you’re looking for an honest agency that goes above and beyond, Blend is most certainly the team for you, I can’t recommend them highly enough.\n\nI'm the founder and owner of NI Candle Supplies - we provide a unique customer experience in the wholesale candle making supplies industry. I commissioned Blend Commerce to create a website that was both user-friendly and appealed to both B2B and B2C users, It was also crucial that it was easy for us to manage, especially with having to juggle the other elements of running my business. As a result of working on the Shopify store setup, we have an amazing website that has received a lot of positive feedback, sales are going well and we are really pleased with how everything has come together.\n\nIt was great to work with a small, yet knowledgeable team - something that competitors could not necessarily offer us. Adam (who leads the marketing team) has great marketing skills and our blog posts are brilliant! Peter knows the development side inside out! We really appreciated the on-going support following launch, and this was very useful as we strive to grow the business rapidly. We also feel that the ability to access social media management services through their sister company, Blue Pineapple, was fantastic - it's so much easier to have everything in one place!\n\nIf you're looking to launch your Shopify store, I'd absolutely recommend Blend Commerce. Blend took our dream and made it a reality, one that has come together even better than we could have possibly imagined. We are blown away by not only our website but how all of our marketing and email communications look and work seamlessly. Thanks so much!\n\nBlend Commerce recently assisted us with the transfer from Mailchimp to Klaviyo including the set up of all of our campaigns. In addition to making the transition seamless, they did a fantastic job in providing comprehensive training to ensure we are up to speed with the way Klaviyo works. We regularly utilise Blend's services both in continuing to improve our site and in for our marketing and firmly believe Blend's fresh approach has played a massive role in helping us achieve success so quickly!\n\nA few months ago I was on the hunt for an agency to do our store redesign. My one key goal was that I needed to INCREASE MOBILE CONVERSIONS in a big way.\n\nWhen I began talking to Shopify agencies, I started to stress about the project. I sure most merchants know how that feels.\n\nMy big fear was that it would be a never-ending project and that I might end up with something worse than what we started with… and I had visions of costs getting out of control for hidden \"extras\" that I didn't even understand.\n\nI had worked with Blend Commerce on a few small projects, and ultimately decided to hire them for the big job!\n\nWe started with a store wireframing and then a roadmap for our store redesign. Their roadmap service outlined a firm scope of work and fixed cost for the project before I committed to the redesign.\n\nMy big issue was that our mobile traffic was growing fast, and we needed to improve mobile conversion. When I started thinking about a new site, our mobile traffic was 70%.\n\nBy the time we hired Blend our mobile traffic was around 80%, and my mobile conversion was averaging less than 2%, so it was obvious that I needed to take action and fast.\n\nAfter working with Blend as a partner, I can say that I really didn't experience any of the horror stories I've heard about and was afraid might happen. In fact, we've had some great improvements since launching our new site 6 months ago. I really think that much of the improvement can be attributed to Peter and the team at Blend. Our new site is pretty amazing.\n\nAs an example, here are some stats:\n\n- Mobile conversion rate is up 26%\n\n- Overall conversion rate is up 16%.\n\n- Revenue from mobile is up 40%\n\n- Overall revenue is up 26%\n\n- Mobile bounce rate is down 28%.\n\nI have been heavily involved with e-commerce and social media marketing for a number of years. I know there are lots of choices when it comes to hiring an Agency to design a new site.\n\nFor me, what stood out was that Blend didn’t come to the project with preconceived ideas. They asked what I wanted to achieve and then stayed focused on that. They didn't muddy the waters with a lot of extras and \"bells and whistles\". They understood that user experience and increasing conversions on mobile was our \"one big thing\". I wanted to design for mobile first, and they actually made a point of showing me everything on mobile first and walking me through the user experience. In fact, a few times Peter had to remind me to get off the desktop version and approve the mobile pages first!\n\nThe whole team was super responsive to our needs, and after the project was completed, they didn’t disappear. They actually continue to be a source of support when I need help.\n\nI do, and will continue to, recommend Blend Commerce to online merchants looking to get the best from Shopify.\n\nIt is great that Blend have a small and focused team, but this does mean that they only take on a few projects at a time. I think it's worth the wait.\n\nThe guys really do bring a lot to the table and have tons of experience. They offered up some suggestions that added real value. They were flexible when it made sense and kept me focused on our goals.\n\nGreat team and great results!\n\nBeing based in Australia, we were initially sceptical about working with a Shopify development partner so far away. Different countries, different currencies, different cultures.\n\nWe needn’t had worried at all about working with Blend. By means of introduction to the project, Kivari, the label, is an Australian bohemian-luxe fashion brand. Designed for the modern free-spirited bohemian woman. Due to a solid growth period and in order to continue this level of growth, the brand needed a refresh, starting with the website. We were ultimately aiming for a cleaner design to really highlight the amazing photography and garments, and created a better user experience. Crucially, we needed advanced backend controls to improve internal efficiencies as we grew.\n\nAfter working with Blend for a very short period, I found that communication wasn't a problem nor a blocker. I loved the fact that I was able to speak and communicate directly with the lead developer on the job, who also acted as the project manager.\n\nWe felt that this was a big point of difference in the management of the project, not offered by other comparable Shopify Expert agencies.\n\nAs a result of the project, we now have an exceptional mobile responsive website that is easy to use, even for internal stakeholders with little Shopify experience. We have a new theme which can be easily edited in the future but currently serves the purpose of showcasing our garments and branding effectively. In essence, we’ve been able to add a great new asset to our business.\n\nIn addition to the above, Blend offer great turn around times and a competitive package price, given the team’s demand and credentials.\n\nI would absolutely recommend Blend for a client looking to upgrade their Shopify theme to Turbo. Blend are extremely well versed in using and developing this theme and are constantly striving for perfection and customer satisfaction along the way.\n\nWe can certainly see why Out of the Sandbox selected Blend as partners. I couldn't rate Blend Commerce higher. They were able to deliver a great site with amazing customer service and support, both before, during and after launch.\n\nU Suck at Golf is a lifestyle apparel company geared toward the average everyday golfer. Our goal is to bring out the lighter side of the game with funny and unique products that every weekend golfer can relate to, while still offering the quality that our customers will trust on and off the course. USAG started out of the passion for embracing this f***ed-up game and to move away from all the seriousness and stigmas that are often associated with the sport. It started with one viral t-shirt and almost a year later here we are with over 10,000 shirts shipped.\n\nAfter the success we saw in the first year, we felt that we were really leaving a lot on the table as we had no experience in building out a site or brand whatsoever. We contacted Blend Commerce in hopes of improving the overall trustworthiness of our website. This included things such as branding, navigation, and optimization for conversions.\n\nBlend Commerce were amazing, to say the least. Their lead developer, Pete, worked with us every step of the way to develop a website that we were happy with and on the same page with. He completely restructured the navigation, which is flawless right now and added an “ease of use” for the customer. We also gave the site a more branded feel by incorporating consistent fonts and color schemes. Last, we restructured the product pages to add “trustworthiness” and give our customers confidence in shopping with us.\n\nWe saw an immediate increase in our Conversion rate and are now averaging about 4.5%, which is still not the best, but much higher than where we were at about 2%.\n\n(Pre-Blend: Jan 1st - May 30th - 1.73%… Post-Blend: Jun 1st - Jun 13th - 4.3%)\n\nWe feel that Blend Commerce has put laid the foundation for us and we can keep on increasing that number through our marketing in the coming months.\n\nOverall Blend Commerce were a pleasure to work with and responded to all of our requests immediately. I would be confident in recommending them to anyone looking to improve their website. Being the average Shopify store owner, we have no experience in coding and website development and can only take it so far, which is fine when first starting out, but when looking to scale your store to the next level, I believe that the investment with Blend Commerce will surely pay off.\n\nI approached Blend with a very complex project for Certainly Wood earlier in the year. They were very good at going into detail with me on the requirements of the project, spent time understanding the different systems which we use to process orders and scoped a very detailed plan for the delivery.\n\nThe next phase of design was equally as efficient: they produced a design which I could easily give feedback to, but it did not require many significant changes either. The Blend team seem to understand what our brand was about and designed the website better that we initially imagined.\n\nDevelopment followed after that - we were on a tight deadline to deliver the project which meant some pressure was put onto the Blend team to deliver quicker, and whilst we did see a delay in start of the project, the final product was great.\n\nI was very impressed with their follow on support, as well. Once the hand over was done, the Blend team continued to monitor our orders to make sure the system was functioning as expected. I was not expecting this and we were very grateful to have received further support after the project was completed.\n\nWe have worked with other agencies in the past and many times we experienced issues, mainly because of the lack of personalised approach. We often felt that there was a real lack of commitment from the agencies, they were too large to care about a single project. Blend felt like a great in-between, large enough to bring a serious variety of expertise, but small enough to apply care to their work.\n\nWorking with Blend was refreshing. Thank you to the whole team. I can only but highly recommend them."
