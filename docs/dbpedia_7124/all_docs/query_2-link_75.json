        "text": "International Certificate of Origin Council (ICOC)\n\nThe ICC World Chambers Federation (WCF) International Certificate of Origin Council (ICOC) is a global forum of trade facilitation experts that advocates for chambers as issuing agents of Certificates of Origin (COs) around the world.\n\nAll chamber members of ICC are welcome to join and contribute to the work of the ICOC.\n\nICOC was set up to enhance and promote the unique position of chambers as issuing agents of Certificates of Origin through collaboration, which is achieved by implementing the following strategies:\n\nCoordinated engagement with international, regional and national governments and agencies through ICC structures.\n\nEstablishment of an International Certificate of Origin Accreditation Chain, based on CO Guidelines, which sets international best practices for issuing procedures.\n\nDevelopment of a series of international training programmes to enhance the level of chamber professionalism and competency in CO issuance.\n\nAssistance in the identification and use of advanced technologies in the delivery of COs and trade documents.\n\nPromotion of the liberalisation of issuance of Preferential CO to chambers by customs authorities.\n\nAdvocacy for the recognition and acceptance of electronic CO by governments.\n\nDigitalisation of CO\n\neCO Task Force\n\nICC WCF has developed a set of online tools to keep pace with the rapid shift to e-business and improve efficiency in serving the business community.\n\nMany chambers around the world already issue Electronic Certificates of Origin (eCO), which are secure, efficient, cost-effective and transparent. However, more needs to be done to increase their acceptance.\n\nRecognising the long-term benefits of digitalisation, the eCO Task Force was created to enhance and raise the level of acceptability of eCO by stakeholders, as well as provide a forum to share expertise and experiences. The task force also provides assistance to chambers of commerce seeking support in the implementation of a digital system for the issuance of eCO.\n\nThe following work of the eCO Task Force has been made available to date:\n\neCO Best Practices\n\nGuidance on how to promote further acceptance\n\nHow can you verify the authenticity of COs online?\n\nThe CO verification website is a secure platform enabling customs authorities to verify the authenticity of COs issued by participating accredited chambers through a unique CO number and accreditation code. It reinforces mutual trust by ensuring that COs are issued in accordance with international standards.\n\nAdvantages of the platform:\n\nAccreditation that verifies adherence to internationally accepted standards.\n\nPlatform security that is only available to chambers and their technical providers.\n\nEfficiency in allowing customs authorities and others involved in the CO verification process, to check authenticity online.\n\nStandardisation of data.\n\nThe number of users of the ICC CO verification website has grown significantly in recent years and we’ve upgraded the platform to become a more modern, secure and innovative interface. The website now displays additional information, such as a description of the goods and the countries of origin and destination, and enables customs authorities to review the complete CO form, via a redirection to the issuing chamber’s system or its national verification website.\n\nThe option of scanning the QR code on the CO instead of manually inputting the information has also been added to the new website."
