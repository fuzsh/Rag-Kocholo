This type of commerce has revolutionized the way people shop, allowing them to find and buy products in just a few clicks, without geographical limits. Thanks to its flexibility and convenience, e-commerce continues to evolve, significantly changing the way consumers and businesses interact.\n\nAs shipments continue to increase and box size diversity continues to increase, finding the ideal labeling solution can be challenging. However, Arca has the perfect answer: the print apply Linerplus 4.0 with electric cylinder, available in both 600mm (23.62″) and 1000mm (39.37″) lengths. The electric cylinder has advanced features, such as automatic height adjustment and application point detection, allowing high productivity and maximum precision labeling of boxes with different heights, avoiding missing or bad labeling. Features that make this labeling system particularly suitable for the e-commerce industry. Labeling becomes a highly efficient and rapid process.\n\nThanks to 4.0 technology and its high level of integration with other automation systems, Linerplus 4.0 can be easily implemented in an existing production line, ensuring a smooth workflow. With the addition of a second print apply labeler Linerplus 4.0, the 4.0 control unit allows either Non-Stop labeling (therefore no line stops for changing the label roll) or Tandem labeling to double productivity.\n\nE-commerce is a business model that allows to buy and sell products or services using the internet as the main platform.
