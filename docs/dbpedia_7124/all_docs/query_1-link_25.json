        "text": "'display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any article...'\n\nThe term 'immediate container' does not include package liners. Any word, statement, or other information appearing on the immediate container must also appear 'on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, or the retail package of such article, or is easily legible through the outside container of wrapper.'\n\nSection 201(m) defines 'labeling' as:\n\n'all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter\n\n(1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or\n\n(2) accompanying such article' at any time while a device is held for sale after shipment or delivery for shipment in interstate commerce.\n\nThe term 'accompanying' is interpreted liberally to mean more than physical association with the product. It extends to posters, tags, pamphlets, circulars, booklets, brochures, instruction books, direction sheets, fillers, etc. 'Accompanying' also includes labeling that is brought together with the device after shipment or delivery for shipment in interstate commerce."
