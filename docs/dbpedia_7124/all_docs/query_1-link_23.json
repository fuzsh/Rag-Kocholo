Once you open the editor of a product these two buttons are provided at the bottom of the screen. (screenshot) I want to provide different labels for these buttons e.g. \"Update\" rather than \"Save\". I have changed many labels for other components and editors via locale*.properties files. I am just not able to identify for these ones.\n\nI have tried looking for these labels by searching through many of the *.properties files in my extensions as well as the Hybris OOTB properties files. I cannot find where these are configured.\n\nIf someone knows where I need to look or how this can be done would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks"
