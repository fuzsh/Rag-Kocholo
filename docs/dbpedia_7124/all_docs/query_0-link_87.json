        "text": "Necessity is the mother of invention.\n\nGreat ideas are born from a need to fix something that isn’t working or to create something new where there is currently a void.\n\nThis is the origin story for commerce media.\n\nAs a result of consumer calls for privacy, the digital advertising industry is undergoing a transformation. It’s a positive change that puts consumers in their rightful place at the center of the advertising ecosystem, but also a difficult one that has raised more questions than answers. Amidst all the talk about how responsible addressable advertising can work moving forward, commerce media has risen as a solution.\n\nCommerce media gives marketers and media owners what they need (a safe and simple way to still drive growth through advertising).\n\nIt gives consumers what they want (relevant ads, on their terms).\n\nAnd it keeps the open internet thriving (because that’s where discovery, innovation, and choice rule).\n\nIn short, commerce media is the next big thing—which means the time to get familiar with it is now. In this guide, learn exactly what commerce media is, why it’s trending, and how it solves the industry’s most pressing needs.\n\nAt its simplest, commerce media connects marketers and media owners to first-party data and to each other so that everyone can bring richer experiences to consumers while enabling closed-loop measurement.\n\nTo look at it another way, commerce media brings programmatic advertising and retail media together and widens the field to include non-retail businesses—all on the open internet where the control is in the hands of the marketers and the media owners.\n\nKey point #1\n\nA first-party data-based solution\n\nProvides access to a large set of privacy-safe first-party data that can be leveraged in a variety of ways.\n\nKey point #2\n\nOpen\n\nConnects marketers and media owners on the open internet, where control and transparency reign, and where discovery, innovation, and choice thrive.\n\nKey point #3\n\nIntelligent\n\nUses large-scale commerce data (purchase and intent data) that is applied via artificial intelligence (AI) built for commerce to:\n\nGain audience insights\n\nImprove online targeting\n\nDeliver relevant experiences\n\nConnect online activity to online and in-person outcomes\n\nKey point #4\n\nFull-funnel\n\nEngage audiences at all stages from discovery to consideration and conversion and throughout acquisition and retention, while driving measurable commerce outcomes at each stage.\n\nKey point #5\n\nFor media owners, too\n\nCommerce media is also the means by which media owners (publishers and retailers) can enrich their first-party data and inventory and package it for advertisers\n\nKey point #6\n\nAudience-first\n\nEnables marketers to put aside a channel-by-channel approach and create advertising strategies based on high-value audiences across all channels, devices, and formats.\n\nKey point #7\n\nMore relevant\n\nLarge-scale data and AI improve ad relevancy which leads to better user experiences and performance.\n\nKey point #8\n\nMeasurable\n\nUnderstand the full impact of digital efforts and connect every campaign, even those for awareness and consideration, to downstream online and in-store KPIs (such as sales, leads, and visits).\n\nKey point #9\n\nAddressable\n\nMarketers and media owners can connect their first-party data to find matches and build, scale, and activate addressable audiences.\n\nWhat’s commerce data?\n\nA set of purchase and intent data that gives insight into consumer behaviors and journeys and can be used to deliver superior outcomes. It includes:\n\nPage and product views\n\nProducts added to cart\n\nProducts purchased (online and offline)\n\nAd clicks\n\nContextual data from publishers such as URLs, contextual categories, and keywords\n\nProduct info like categories, SKUs, prices, descriptions\n\nIdentifiers such as hashed emails, hashed phone numbers, and visitor IDs (such as random IDs stored in first-party cookies)\n\nBigger is better\n\nThe bigger the commerce data set, the more insights you can get.\n\nFirst-party is best\n\nCommerce data that is based on first-party data will be vital for continued addressability and personalizing experiences.\n\nCommerce doesn’t only happen online.\n\nOur Shopper Story survey shows that physical stores are still as powerful a draw today as they were in 2019: Nearly six in ten consumers look forward to shopping in stores when they have time.2 In addition, what starts online might end in a physical location, and vice versa. And increasingly, they both happen at the same time. Our research showed that more than half of consumers make purchases on their phone while inside a store – either from that retailer, or a competitor’s website.3 Commerce media puts the audience first, facilitating the omnichannel journey that works for them—and connecting ad spend to results wherever they happen (online or in-person).\n\nWhat’s changed is how often people buy online while inside a store:\n\nClick & Ship\n\n51%\n\nmake purchase on their phone while inside a retailer’s store from that retailer’s website — up from 38% in 2019.\n\nScan & Scram\n\n58%\n\nmake purchase on their phone while inside a retailer’s store — more than 1.4 times the 42% who did so in 2019.\n\nThe Takeaway?\n\nMost consumers still include stores as part of their consideration process, but the competition for where they end up buying is getting fiercer\n\nCommerce media’s inventory is on publishers across the open internet, in addition to retailers and marketplaces.\n\nThis opens all kinds of acquisition and retention opportunities for all kinds of businesses. Like, say, reaching new customers while they stream content with video ads, influencing them while they read a related article with contextual ads, retargeting them after they’ve visited your site or a retailer partner’s site, and reengaging them after they’ve become a customer.\n\nCommerce media, retail media, performance and brand marketing: what’s the difference?\n\nCommerce media is a new category, and that often comes with some confusion. Some use the term interchangeably with retail media. Others see it as the next evolution of retail media. Still others think it sounds like performance marketing with a different name. Let’s clear things up.\n\nCommerce media takes the retail media model and expands it. It includes a broad network of publishers across the open internet, in addition to retailers. And it enables non-retail and non-endemic advertisers, in addition to retail advertisers, to use commerce data and AI to more effectively engage audiences on those publishers and retailers. It also includes a wide range of formats and channels to meet full-funnel objectives, from video and CTV to contextual and sponsored product ads. Commerce media brings all of this together in one place.\n\nCommerce MediaRetail MediaPerformance MarketingBrand Marketing Full-funnelYes.\n\nCan be used for discovery, conversion, and retentionSometimes.\n\nSome retail media providers offer a variety of display formats that allow brands to build awareness, drive point-of-purchase sales, and retarget retailer audiences.No.\n\nPrimarily a bottom-funnel tactic focused on driving and optimizing for conversions.No.\n\nPrimarily a top-funnel tactic focused on awareness and optimizing for reach and impressions.

Works for non-retailer advertisersYes.\n\nCommerce media works for retail and other businesses, such as classifieds, travel, and finance.No.\n\nRetail media is focused on helping brands that sell products on retailers.Yes.Yes. Connected supply and demand for closed-loop measurementYes.\n\nCommerce media directly connects marketers and media owners.Yes.\n\nRetailers and their brand advertisers are directly connected through retail media.No.No.\n\nAt the same time, our research shows that more consumers than ever are using options like BOPIS (buy online, pickup in store) and click and collect and that they still highly value the in-person experience of physical stores: Four in 10 don’t like to purchase unless they can see and touch items in a store.5\n\nHow we can connect with consumers is (still) changing: Growing privacy regulations and the possible phase-out of third-party cookies have marketers and media owners looking for new ways to responsibly reach and monetize audiences.\n\nPrioritizing first-party data strategies is now a must for retailers and publishers: Because of the point above, marketers are focused on gathering and growing first-party data. Publishers preparing for declining CPMs from the loss of third-party cookies are expanding their first-party data strategies. Retailers are also exploring more ways to monetize their valuable first-party assets. Connecting marketers with these media owners is a win-win for all parties.\n\n“The opportunity for us in the post-third-party cookie ecosystem is that we are the owners of our data. We are the only ones who know and understand our users, who have a repeat relationship based on the first-party cookie.”\n\nTrade marketing is shifting to digital: Brand dollars are following their consumers online. 92% of EU7 and 76% of US brand advertisers8 say their growth depends on retail media advertising.\n\nConsumers are turning to the open internet more than ever: Consumers don’t just shop on Amazon or search on Google. Our research shows that more shoppers are now starting their product search on retail and brand websites, which are surpassing online marketplaces and search engines as the leading first touchpoint.\n\n66%\n\nof time is spent on the open internet9\n\n7 in 10\n\nconsumers told us that before buying products they’ve never bought before or important products, they frequently read informative articles on the open internet.10\n\nNew Head of Commerce roles emerging in agencies: People in these roles are spearheading a 360° approach to commerce, overseeing everything from search and display, to shopper marketing and retail media. Their goals are to break down silos and take an audience-based approach rather than a channel by channel or retailer by retailer approach.\n\n69%\n\nof marketers and media owners said that removing channel silos was a top priority for future-proofing their digital marketing efforts1\n\nThe commerce media ecosystem is comprised of three main players: Marketers, Media Owners, and Consumers. Each has their own goals, challenges, and needs that we’ll dive into.\n\nMarketers\n\nBrands, retailers (more specifically, the brand/digital/growth marketers and media planners and buyers within them), and the agencies that support them are the demand side of the commerce media ecosystem. They want to activate addressable advertising campaigns that can reach in-market consumers from discovery through to purchase, with a focus on driving and measuring outcomes at each stage.\n\nMarketers need:\n\nCommerce data and AI to better understand consumers.\n\nTapping into a global commerce dataset enables marketers to identify interest and intent patterns to enrich audience targeting and personalization. The more commerce data marketers can get their hands on, the smarter their campaigns.\n\nMarketers need:\n\nFirst-party data-based advertising solutions.\n\nIf and when Google ends support for third-party cookies, first-party data will be the way forward. Having enough first-party data is an issue, especially in the current system where many steps of matching and syncing can lead to data loss. Marketers will need commerce media solutions that help them both secure and activate privacy-safe first-party data to meet full-funnel objectives.\n\nMarketers need:\n\nOptions in addition to walled gardens for more reach and more control.\n\nIn a Forrester Consulting survey we commissioned, 80% of North American8 and 77% of EU respondents7 want to reduce their dependency on walled gardens. Couple this with the fact that a majority of global ecommerce is done outside of Amazon, and there is a compelling need for commerce media on the open internet.\n\nMarketers need:\n\nThe ability to tie advertising spend to outcomes.\n\nWhether it’s awareness, traffic, leads, or sales, marketers need to be able to measure the impact of digital advertising as consumers move through the funnel.\n\nMarketers need:\n\nAs few platforms as possible to streamline management.\n\nCommerce media on the open internet is inefficient and requires using multiple platforms, including demand side platforms (DSPs), supply side platforms (SSPs), and retail media platforms.\n\nMedia Owners\n\nPublishers, retailers, and marketplaces are the supply side of the commerce media ecosystem. These players want to sell their advertising and promotions inventory to marketers.\n\nMedia owners need:\n\nSolutions to help them monetize their first-party audiences and data and increase yield.\n\nFor retailers, the tech stack needed to successfully take on the role of publisher is too much for most to do in-house. Likewise, publishers looking to get more from their inventory need external commerce data and AI assets to help them do so.\n\nMedia owners need:\n\nTo be able to capture more advertiser spend.\n\nA self-contained commerce media ecosystem can simplify the process and reduce fees that eat up media owner profits today.\n\nMedia owners need:\n\nSolutions to manage first-party data collection, rights, and activation.\n\nTo build up their privacy-safe, opted-in data, publishers need commerce media solutions that can help them educate consumers, capture their consent, and give them the ability to manage their preferences.\n\nMedia owners need:\n\nControl.\n\nMedia owners need control, over data access and pricing and over content to ensure relevancy.\n\nConsumers\n\nConsumers are the beating heart of the ecosystem. It is their call for more privacy and control that is reshaping the ad industry and informing the nascent commerce media category. Only by working together can marketers and media owners deliver the experiences that will garner the trust and loyalty of consumers moving forward.\n\nConsumers need:\n\nThe ability to control marketers’ and media owners’ usage of the data that they agree to share.\n\nConsumers need to clearly understand the value exchange of consenting to the use of their data and be able to manage that consent to opt in or out at any time.\n\nConsumers need:\n\nRelevant experiences.\n\nThe appeal for more control doesn’t mean that consumers are no longer interested in relevant experiences. Marketers and media owners that can meet consumers in a moment of want or need with the right content will be rewarded with higher engagement.\n\nConsumers need:\n\nTo be able to still access high-quality digital content, discover new things, and have freedom of choice.\n\nAdvertising is what makes all of this possible today by providing the funds media owners need to continue to provide original and diverse products and content on the open internet.\n\nSurvey respondents are also seeking commerce media partners to help them optimize performance and improve agility. When Forrester Consulting asked which capabilities were most valuable in selecting a commerce partner, 63% said the ability to compare and optimize performance across channels and retailers and 59% said the ability to measure performance and adjust campaign spend in real-time. Nearly half (47%) of respondents also seek partners who can provide access to a large amount of first-party data.\n\nThe commerce media space is quickly advancing to deliver on these needs by making it easier for marketers and media owners to work together efficiently.\n\nThe goal is to connect them in an open marketplace via a single interface. In this marketplace, data can be shared to link identity, create and scale addressable audiences, and activate them through a variety of channels and formats. Measurement and optimization will be possible across channels and retailers all from one place, for a truly holistic view.\n\n“Companies who enable publishers and advertisers to safeguard consumer rights while connecting first-party data on both the buy and sell side are going to define the next chapter of personalized advertising.”\n\nEach player gets what they need to succeed, from data to technology to connections, creating a self-sustaining system and a virtuous circle where all mutually benefit:\n\nMarketers\n\nget enough addressable audience reach and measurable results to continue running campaigns\n\nMedia owners\n\nget ad revenue to continue to develop/improve content to attract audiences\n\nConsumers\n\nget richer experiences from trusted marketers and media owners\n\nFuture-proof your advertising.\n\nThings like privacy, cookies, addressability, and accountability are keeping the digital ad industry up at night. More consumers are online than ever, but the ability to give them personalized experiences is getting harder. Commerce media for these big changes upending the industry, because it’s rooted in first-party data. First-party data is the future of digital advertising because it is the key to responsibly linking identity across environments and creating addressable audience reach.\n\nMarketers who want to have a big enough audience to reach if and when third-party cookies are phased out need to start increasing their access to first-party data now. Commerce media helps them achieve this in three ways:\n\n1\n\nIt expands the reach of their own first-party data by enriching it with a larger set of first-party commerce data, which can be used to build new audiences\n\n2\n\nIt increases the effectiveness of targeting and personalization to engage high-quality audiences who will be more likely to opt-in to share their data, thereby growing the addressable audience pool\n\n3\n\nIt reduces the data loss that occurs from the many steps of matching and syncing that happens in the current system\n\nFor publishers who face decreasing yield when support is ended for third-party cookies, commerce media can help make up the difference, providing the technology and the data they need to turn their own data into a more attractive offering for advertisers.\n\nFor retailers, commerce media enables them to monetize their data and audiences without needing to invest in building their own retail media platform. It also gives them the tools they need to acquire and convert consumers. This means they can both grow their ad business and increase product sales in one place.\n\nFor both publishers and retailers, commerce media offers increased demand from those looking to reach audiences on the open internet. By matching first party data across demand and supply, it also increases the addressability of their inventory, resulting in more spend from buyers.\n\nStreamline and close the loop\n\nCommerce media solves the fragmentation challenge, enabling marketers and media owners to simplify growth and use less tech, rather than more.\n\nBy directly connecting marketers and media owners, commerce media makes it easy to track the impact of digital campaigns on KPIs (such as sales, leads, visits), both online and offline. This ability to connect media spend to actual purchase data provides the accountable advertising that marketers are keen to shift their budgets to.\n\n6 out of 10\n\nmarketers and retailers (as media owners) say the top benefits of taking a commerce media approach are improved CX (63%), increased growth (65%), and increased profitability (61%)1\n\n65%\n\nIncreased growth\n\n63%\n\nImproved customer experience\n\n61%\n\nIncreased profitability\n\nPut consumers first\n\nConsumers want their data rights respected. But this doesn’t mean that consumers are no longer interested in relevant experiences. Commerce media powers both responsible and relevant advertising. Because of its audience-first approach, commerce media is built to serve consumers’ needs and evolve as they evolve.\n\nConsumers also want to be able to access a variety of content, products, and services. Through commerce media, marketers and media owners power the advertising that supports diversity and choice on the open internet.\n\nGet control, transparency, and balance\n\nAs the walls of the walled gardens grow ever higher, options that preserve marketers’ access to and control over first-party data are critical. Commerce media is on the open internet, where all players have the freedom to access and keep their data, use any partners they wish, dictate pricing, and maintain control over the consumer experience. It’s a way to reduce dependence on walled gardens and build a more balanced strategy that meets consumers in all the places they spend their time—and where there are no walls blocking the view of the customer journey.\n\n“Building, establishing and maintaining a relationship with customers—not just for a single conversion but throughout their lifetime with a brand—is increasing in importance for every contemporary marketer I’ve worked with. When a brand understands the customer and every part of their journey and owns the data attached to that, walled gardens will not exist as they do now.”11\n\nCommerce Media Benefits\n\nMarketersMedia OwnersConsumers Achieve scalable addressability, with audiences and personalization powered by first-party data.Earn more ad revenue by monetizing owned first-party data and audiences.See ads only for things they've actively shown an interest in, and only from advertisers that they have consented to.
