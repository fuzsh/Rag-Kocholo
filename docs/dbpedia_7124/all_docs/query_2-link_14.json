It creates ready-to-ship custom-sized mail packages in a unique operation capable of integration with a labeler and multi-carrier shipping software and gathering and reporting data on exceptions to handle order fulfillment.\n\nUsing the minimum amount of packaging material for each item, the 3322 system can operate at up to 20 packages per minute and the finished packs are labeled and ready to ship.\n\nID Technology’s 252 print and apply labeling system handles the shipping labels and the data for each label can be provided from one of our NiceLabel custom apps, or the printer can integrate with the ERP or warehouse management software."
