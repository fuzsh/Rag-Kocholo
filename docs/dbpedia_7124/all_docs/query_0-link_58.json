        "text": "We see that more and more brands are offering this channel in addition to in-store sales. These new merchants are adding to the e-commerce consumer offering alongside the pure-players who offer only this digital sales channel.\n\nAs a result, competitive pressure increases and it becomes important to ensure an impeccable quality of service to the end customer. The challenge behind these considerations is first of all the loyalty of consumers through a spotless customer experience.\n\nThis aspect is all the more important as the «bad buzz» is never far away! Social networks now offer a powerful voice for disgruntled customers, and it’s no longer uncommon to find stories of bad experiences when receiving parcels on Twitter, for example. Under the #excessivepackaging banner, many customers of large retailers complain about disproportionate or damaged packaging and do not hesitate to directly challenge the companies responsible. Selling a product that satisfies the customer also means delivering it properly… and a successful delivery also requires proper packaging! An essential element, the packaging is a reflection of the product it carries, the first contact between the customer and the merchant. If the parcel arrives damaged, the customer will be disappointed, will not place a new order and worse, as we have just seen, will make negative publicity for the responsible brand. To avoid this, the packaging must meet several criteria:\n\nThe parcel is in a way the embodiment of the brand, and this is all the more true when dealing with a 100% e-commerce brand. It thus conveys with it all the values and image that the brand wishes to reflect: aesthetics, humor, luxury, seriousness, etc.\n\nThis packaging customization also serves a commercial purpose. Thus, the carton can become an advertising medium or marketing lever that can host promotional messages related to particular commercial events (Christmas, Easter, sales, Black Friday, Valentine’s Day, etc.). The moment when a parcel is opened is an important and privileged moment for the end customer, who discovers the long-awaited products. It is important to take advantage of this increased state of buyer attention to present new products printed directly on the packaging.\n\nThe package can also be customized according to the wishes of the end customer, for example as a gift offered and delivered to a loved one. This gives the customer the opportunity to print a personalized photo or message for the person receiving the parcel.\n\nThis printing solution can be valuable for logisticians managing multi-brand activities and wishing to offer their customers brand-customized packaging services. The enormous advantage of this type of solution: the ability to print the transport label directly onto the carton, in order to save paper"
