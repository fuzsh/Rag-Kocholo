I’ve seen it’s powerful impact first hand on our family’s farms.”\n\nHelen Russell, CEO\n\nBrand | Equator Coffees\n\n“Fair Trade Certified is an amazing initiative. What it does is it raises consciousness around what is possible when you use business as a force for good in the world. Any company that adopts the Fair Trade model is making a statement in terms of who they are and what their vision is. Consumers want ethically sourced products, and that’s what Fair Trade is all about. That’s why you see so many other companies buying Fair Trade products.”\n\nSteve Shriver\n\nCo-Founder, CEO | Eco Lips\n\n“Fair Trade Certified products take all stakeholders into account, not just the shareholders. We can confidently say that Eco Lips products are sustainably and ethically sourced, ensuring the growers are treated and compensated fairly.

We have seen firsthand how the partnership with Fair Trade for almost 10 years can scale our reach and take on an important role in our company culture, helping us push our mission to another level.”\n\nSoren Bjorn, President\n\nProducer | Driscoll’s of the Americas\n\n“We reached the conclusion that we would benefit from having an outside party look at what we were doing. For our customers and consumers, it wasn’t enough to tell them that we were doing a great job. We really needed a partner. We looked long and hard at who could help us and decided to go with Fair Trade USA. They became our partner in verifying and communicating that we are doing a great job throughout our supply chain.”\n\nResources & Articles\n\nLearn about Certification\n\nBy partnering with us, you’ll be joining a diverse network of producers, companies, shoppers, and advocates who are committed to building a more equitable model of trade.\n\nWhat We Certify\n\nJoin Us\n\nThe Fair Trade Community is a gathering place for Fair Trade shoppers, advocates, allies, and donors, united as changemakers creating a better world.\n\nFair Trade Community"
