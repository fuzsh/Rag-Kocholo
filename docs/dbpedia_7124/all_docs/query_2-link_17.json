        "text": "A private label, also known as a store brand or own brand, refers to a product manufactured by one company but sold under the brand name of another company, typically a retailer or distributor. In essence, private label products are created to be exclusive to a particular retailer, allowing them to offer unique products that differentiate them from competitors. These products are often developed to meet specific quality standards, price points, or target demographics set by the retailer, providing consumers with alternatives to national or name-brand products."
