Refer to the table below for more information.\n\nAt the top of main content - Recommendations appear above the main content area just below the top navigation bar.\n\nAt the bottom of main content (default) - Recommendations appear below the main content area and before any other content blocks on the page, such as Related Products.\n\nRecommendation at top of home page\n\nRecommendation labels\n\nThe label that is assigned to a recommendation in the storefront affects how shoppers interpret its relevancy to them. The following labels are frequently used for each type of recommendation.\n\nRecommendation at top of search results"
