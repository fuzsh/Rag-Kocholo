        "text": "The FCC had an auction where TV station owners could sell spectrum to wireless services. Only 175 stations sold any spectrum, 145 of those stations will go off-the-air. Thirty stations plan to move to the VHF band, 17 stations to VHF-Lo, and 13 to VHF-Hi. About 1000 stations, that did not sell spectrum, will be required to change UHF channels. There are about 8000 stations in the U.S."
