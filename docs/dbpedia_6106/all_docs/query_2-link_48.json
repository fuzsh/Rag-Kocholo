        "text": "For the real-life channel 7 in New York City, see WABC-TV on Wikipedia. For the radio station on 94.5 FM in Hemlock, Michigan, see WCEN-FM, also on Wikipedia.\n\nWCEN (channel 7), branded as News 7 New York, is a television station in New York City, serving as the flagship of the Central Television Network. Owned by the network's Central Networks Corporation division alongside independent WNYW (channel 52), their studios and offices have been located in the Daily News Building on East 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. The station's transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1955, Mark Richardson was issued a broadcast license for a new television station in New York City. His goal was to offer programming to audiences that were not targeted by the television stations already on the air at the time, with his stated mission being to \"serve the underserved\". It took three years to build the station, but when WLNY-TV, channel 7's original call letters, finally went on air on July 16, 1958, it began broadcasting a general entertainment format featuring older off-network shows from the 1950s, anime, live-action shows dubbed in English, older movies during the day, public domain movies, and Asian programming after 7:00 p.m. weekdays and 4:00 p.m. weekends. WLNY was the first U.S. broadcaster to carry Asian-language programming.\n\nAlong with three other stations respectively in Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Mixopolis and with the sign-on of a new station in San Francisco, these became the original stations of the Central network as it expanded its coverage from Canada to the United States. With the foundation, WLNY became the current WCEN on September 4, 1966.\n\nDespite two ownership changes: Capitol States Communications bought out Central and merged with the network in 1984, the combined company Capitol States/Central was then sold to Quebecor in 1986. As such, the station did not heavily preempt network programming unlike its local competitors or its sister stations.\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WCEN, and several other New York City area television and radio stations were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center; both of the complex's main towers collapsed due to fires caused by the impact. One of WCEN's broadcast engineers, named Phil Trudeau, died in the tragedy, including 39 other engineers from rival stations. WCEN's satellite feed froze on the last video frame received from the WTC mast, an image of the North Tower burning and the start of the impact of the South Tower; the image remained on-screen for much of the day until WCEN was able to set up alternate transmission facilities with now-sister WNYW, which transmitter is located in Garden City. Since then, WCEN has transmitted its signal from the Empire State Building.\n\nWebsite history\n\nseven.wcen.com (1996-2001)\n\nwcen7.com (2001-2020)\n\nwcen.com (2020–present)\n\nProgramming\n\nWCEN has long presented events such as the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, the Columbus Day Parade, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting. They have sponsored an annual two-day Health & Fitness Expo Fair at MetLife Stadium every summer. The station has sponsored a Food Drive together with local retailer Stop & Shop named \"Feeding Our Families\" which has been held on the second Saturday in April since 2017. Beginning in 1995, they were the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual New York City Marathon. From 2010 to 2014, the station was an official local broadcast partner of Discovery Times Square.
