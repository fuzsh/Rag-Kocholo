        "text": "Keith Kelly was born in SC. Whether ministering to local non-churched families and individuals or riding around as a law enforcement chaplain, Pastor Keith absolutely loves having the opportunity to serve God in Greer. Keith is careful to give all glory and honor to God. After all, as he says, “it’s all about Jesus anyway!”\n\nWhile His Vineyard’s ministerial reach is far, he loves being a husband, Dad and Pops more than anything in the world.\n\nPastor Allen Elder is a native of Greer, SC. He grew up in the Greer and Duncan area. He has served Southern Baptist Churches in South Carolina for 30 years. He is a graduate of James F. Byrnes High School, Spartanburg Community College, and Newburgh Bible College. Allen is also a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. He has a passion for training church leaders as pastors, deacons, and as faithful church members. His single-minded focus is the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations.\n\nAllen and Connie met in the tenth grade at Byrnes High School in 1976. They were married in 1985. Connie is employed with District Five Schools where she works in the computer lab at Berry Shoals Intermediate School. She has also coached girls sports within the district.
