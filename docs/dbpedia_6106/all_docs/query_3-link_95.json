        "text": "VTN is the result of praying, planning and discerning on how best to reach the fast growing millions of people for Jesus Christ from the sub-continent of India and around the world. With the encouragement of respected evangelical leaders and with hard work, God helped us in the launching of VTN, India’s first Christ-Centered, family -friendly Channel. It is an understatement to say that we are overwhelmed with the response thus far where television/online content is viewed extensively, from the viewers outside of India.\n\nGod is truly using VTN to reach millions of people who had not heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We are growing and spreading into new areas and freely availalbe on several IPTV platforms outside of India in USA/UK/Europe & Asia . Currently we operate four Digital Stations in Ohio State .Our vision and desire is to grow even more and capture the whole world for Christ.\n\nSince the launch of The Tobago Inspirational Network (TIN) in February 2012, there have been many testimonies of lives being touched. From healings, to restoration of families, financial and educational advancement, the lives of viewers continue to be impacted.\n\n​\n\nThe Tobago inspirational Network is a 24-hour gospel television channel broadcast on the Trico Cable Network in Tobago. We also broadcast on the Atlantic Cable Network in Georgetown, Guyana. TIN is also available on the Wiimax Live TV Network and our app is accessible on Google Play. The channel features 90% local content, including praise and worship, messages, health and fitness programmes, bible and family discussions. Our objective is to not only make the channel available in the Caribbean, but worldwide.\n\n​\n\nThe vision behind the channel is to provide low-cost television programming to create a wider scope for the gospel to reach the masses.\n\n​\n\nIn 1976, God gave Blackie a vision to start a television program. It was produced and aired on the local ABC affiliate. The Lord’s message to Blackie (confirmed through prayer and prophesy) was that He would not only provide for the television program, but for a television station as well! Later that same year, the application for Son Broadcasting was filed with the FCC.\n\nEarly in 1977, a fundraising goal was established. Blackie trusted the Lord to bring the $500,000 that was needed for the establishment of the television station. KDAZ held a seven day radio share-a-thon to raise the necessary funds to launch KCHF TV. By the end of the week, $481,000 had been raised, and the entire $500,000 goal had been met just three days later.\n\nOver the next few years, there were many miracles, despite the opposition that was levied against the station. Raising funds, getting building permits and seeing all construction completed took a mighty move of God. But He was faithful! On January 21, 1984, Channel 11, Son Broadcasting, went on the air.\n\nThese many years later, KDAZ and KCHF remain faithful, broadcasting messages of hope and healing to the people of New Mexico. Son Broadcasting has been an example of fine Christian programming and will continue to “Let the Light Shine In” until the return of Christ!\n\nMy calling to media ministry started with a vision to win more unsaved Chinese people for the Kingdom of God. Most of them have been nurtured in false religions worshiping false gods for generations. They strive for success but live in bondage and deception. When I met Christ, I knew He is the only answer to life. Since then, I devoted myself to the gospel through organizing evangelism conferences and gospel luncheons and dinners. However, these earnest attempts only reached a limited number of people, and I felt dissatisfied.\n\nIn 1998, a group of Taiwanese Christians and church leaders received a vision from God to establish a Christian TV channel ─ GOOD TV, and God called me to this ministry to start the first Chinese Christian TV network in the world. By God’s providence and miraculous guidance, GOOD TV has grown and expanded into a global multimedia platform for the gospel reaching Chinese people around the world.\n\nThe Walk Television Network is changing ownership but its mission will continue to operate as a nationwide television network designed to educate viewers “to better comprehend and appreciate the rich Judeo-Christian legacy and to apply such principles to their daily lives.”\n\nTW Broadcasting, LLC, the new owner of The Walk TV, will be operating the network from the facilities of WGGS TV in Greenville, South Carolina. WGGS is one of the longest running Christian television stations in the United States.\n\nA new website and on-air look for The Walk TV debuted during the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in February 2020. Viewers can access The Walk TV through its network of broadcast affiliates and through online streaming accessible on the website and on Roku.\n\nWhile “A New Journey Begins” on The Walk, TW Broadcasting thanks Jim West and his staff for the vision for the launch of this network and the many years of dedication in providing a platform to:\n\nExplore the Past-through documentaries, teaching, biographies, dramas to better understand ourselves, our culture, our heritage and the principles upon which America was founded.\n\nEnjoy the Present-by visiting favorite destinations, local festivals and get to know the unique people who have made this country great, learning about contemporary political and social issues and seeing them from a biblical perspective.\n\nEnvision the Future-by examining the trends, issues and technological discoveries that are shaping our future in an effort to leave a rich legacy to future generations.\n\nWe are entertainment in your home or on the go, anytime and anywhere you are, specially designed for you, your friends and the loved ones in your life, available to you 24-hours a day... everyday at your fingertips.\n\nLIVE STREAMING\n\nWe will bring you the latest in LIVE streaming technology from in the field, boots on the ground, citizen reporters and content creators alike. We will be streaming LIVE events, up close and personal, in real-time from destinations around the globe and from all continents!\n\nWe make programming available for children, teenagers, in addition to the whole family. We play movies that you can watch with your family. Vida TV believes in the local community and for that reason we do specials that highlight the good things happening in our area too.\n\n​\n\nVida TV is very intentional about reaching the billennial generation (bilingual millennials). We are excited to put a spotlight on the diversity that exists within Latino culture. Billennials and their families want to see someone they can relate with on TV in a positive light.\n\nOur heart-centered purpose is to bring women, especially those who have survived abuse or trauma, to a safe gathering place where they feel valued and worthy of love through various subjects that are close to women’s hearts. We also desire to see them fully healed and restored while growing spiritually by the teaching of God’s Word & the hearing of uplifting stories of God’s goodness and great LOVE. Jesus Christ is the name that is preached and brings a unifying bond amongst every viewer feeling a true bond and a genuinely connected TV family."
