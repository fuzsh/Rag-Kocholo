        "text": "These are my primary TV stations: the ones that serve the Greenville - Spartanburg - Asheville - Anderson Designated Marketing Area (DMA), as designated by Nielsen Media Research (the TV ratings people). This DMA basically covers the piedmont area of northwest South Carolina (the âupstateâ) and the mountains of western North Carolina. My home city of Clinton lies about ten miles from the southeastern edge of this DMA.\n\nThe transmitters of the major network stations are scattered north of Greenville, in the North Carolina mountains, 53 to 82 miles from Clinton. Because of their elevation, I have line of sight to them despite their distance, and can get very good to excellent reception with a rooftop antenna system. The most extreme examples are WLOS (ABC) and WUNF (PBS, UNC-TV) whose transmitters are on Mount Pisgah, near the Blue Ridge Parkway south of Asheville NC, at an elevation of about 5800 feet above sea level. I have good reception for WLOS and fairly good reception for WUNF, even though theyâre 82 miles away.\n\nIndoor antennas are mostly hopeless here, at least for me. Before these stations shut down their analog transmitters in February and June 2009, my wife was able to get mediocre reception on one analog channel (WSPA, channel 7) using the built-in ârabbit earâ on a small TV in our kitchen area. Now, with a simple UHF loop antenna and a DTV converter box, she can get a single, different station (WMYA, channels 40.1 and 40.2, broadcasting on physical channel 14). At least this single digital station gives much better picture and sound than she got on analog channel 7 before!\n\nThe newest entry here is W65DS, a low-power station which mostly shut down its analog signal on channel 65 in fall 2009, and started its digital signal on about 20 August 2010. Although the FCC database still lists the station as W65DS (as of 28 August 2010), the digital signal identifies itself as W28DB-D."
