Health Agency Calls for Greater Investments in Global Health\n\n(WHO will strive to double spending in developing countries) (760)\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) will work to double public spending on health in developing countries in the years ahead, according to a statement from WHO Director-General Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland.\n\nSpeaking at the WHO 109th Executive Board meeting in Geneva January 14, Brundtland said research conducted by a United Nations commission indicates that $66,000 million will be needed between now and 2015 to meet the health needs of developing nations. She said about half of that amount will need to come from developing nation governments and the other half from international assistance.\n\n\"Disease is a drain on development,\" Brundtland said. \"Conversely, investments in health are a concrete input into economic development.\"\n\nBrundtland also cited the importance of this year's World Summit on Sustainable Development, saying that WHO will stress the linkages between health and poverty reduction in the months leading up to the August meeting.\n\nThe link between health, economic development and a nation's well being is gaining increasing attention from world leaders. In the communiqu?from its 2001 summit, leaders of the G-8 nations affirmed their commitment to help developing nations strengthen their capabilities to control disease. To that end, the G-8 governments have pledged $1,300 million to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\nThe following text is also available in French at http://www.who.int/inf/en/pr-2002-01.html\n\nFollowing is the WHO press release:\n\n(begin text)\n\nWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\nWHO Information Office\n\n14 January 2002\n\nWHO TO PUSH FOR $66 BILLION INVESTMENT IN HEALTH\n\n14 January, Geneva -- An effort to more than double current investments in health in developing countries will be a key focus of the World Health Organization (WHO) activities in the years to come, the Organization's head said today.\n\n\"As health takes on a more central role (in development), the expectations for the developing countries to prioritize health will be growing,\" Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland said at the opening of the World health Organization's 109th Executive Board meeting, today. \"But no matter how much the least developed countries invest, there will be a substantial gap which needs to be filled through development assistance. By 2015, (...) US$66 billion will be needed, of which just over half will have to be covered by international development assistance.\"\n\nThe figures are based on estimates from the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health which last month presented a report saying a drastic scaling up of investments in health for the poorest countries would lead to a six-fold return in the form of increased economic growth.\n\n\"Disease is a drain on development\" Dr. Brundtland, said. \"Conversely, investments in health are a concrete input into economic development.\"\n\nDr Brundtland pledged that WHO would assist countries as they increase their investment in health and work to improve efficiency and results.\n\n\"The WHO Secretariat will work with countries as they pursue the ideas in this Report. We will also incorporate the Report's analyses and conclusions into relevant international, regional and national events,\" Dr Brundtland told the 32 person Board.\n\nWHO's Executive Board meets twice a year. Together with the World Health Assembly, it forms the Organization's governing body.\n\nIn her speech, Dr Brundtland stressed the importance of this year's World Summit on Sustainable Development, calling it a \"major milestone in the work towards a world where we all can live in safety and with dignity, without undermining future generations' ability to do the same\".\n\nDuring the months leading up to the August Sustainable Development Summit, WHO will stress the central role of health in the development process and the linkages between health and poverty reduction. Dr Brundtland added, \"We will stress the health risks and determinants beyond communicable diseases, and the impacts of economic globalization on health.\"\n\nThe Director-General noted progress on a number of fronts, including negotiations to create an International Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis, and the drafting of a global strategy for infant feeding.\n\nShe also said that she would advice the Board to accept the recommendations of an expert committee to retain stocks of the smallpox virus for continued research into vaccines and treatment.\n\nShe said that a detailed global assessment of health systems performance will be published as part of the World Health Report in 2003.\n\nMrs Myriam Abel, Director of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Vanuatu, is chairing the current session, which is scheduled to last until January 21.\n\n(end text)\n\n(Distributed by the Office of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State.
