The capstone sequence of courses (ENVIR 490–491–492) is required for all UW seniors majoring in Environmental Studies. These courses are designed to provide students with hands-on experience in environment-related work, to improve their written and oral communication skills, and to help them prepare for their next steps after graduation—either in graduate school or in a career field. As such, the reader/grader will copyedit not only traditional academic products (rough and final drafts of papers) but also resumes and work plans.\n\nMore information about the Capstone course series can be found at:\n\nhttp://depts.washington.edu/poeweb/students/capstone/capstone.html\n\nResponsibilities include:\n\nThe capstone reader/grader’s primary role is to help the capstone instructor copyedit student work.

Familiarity with multiple types of writing, an interdisciplinary teaching background, and experience with capstone or career-preparation courses are also desirable.\n\nTo apply please send your resume and cover letter to Tikvah Weiner at tweiner@uw.edu. Applications must be received by Tuesday, September 6th.\n\nWe are continuing our investigation of the ecological effects of geoduck clam aquaculture on beaches in Puget Sound. We’ll be doing a variety of work over the next two months: collecting/preserving benthic core samples, photo-quadrats, epibenthic pump and excavation samples, crab and fish tagging and tissue collection. This work will take a lot of people-power to complete and we’re looking for folks to help out. The remaining dates for August are below. Please respond Kate McPeek <mcpeek@uw.edu> with questions.\n\nDETAILS:\n\nEach day we’ll depart from the loading dock on the west side of the Fisheries Sciences Building (FSH, aka SAFS; across from Recycled cycles). Please try to be there about 10 minutes before the departure time so we can load all of the gear. We will most likely head straight to our research sites without delay so plan on packing a travel mug if you need java to keep yourself motivated. Once we get to the sites we’ll give everyone an overview of the survey design and divide up into groups to complete tasks. Our trips typically take 8 hours.\n\nITEMS YOU SHOULD BRING:\n\nDress in layers and expect to get muddy/dirty. This time of year a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are often a good idea. If you have rubber boots, please bring them. You should also bring rain gear (rain pants or overalls might help you stay a bit cleaner too). If you’re lacking boots or rain gear, please let us know and we’ll find something for you. You should also pack a lunch. Please let me know if you have any questions. Again, thank you for contributing to this study. We appreciate your help.\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\nTuesday, 9/6/2011: depart UW at 1:30AM; Foss site (core samples, photos, epibenthic pump samples)\n\nWednesday, 9/7/2011: depart UW at 2:30 AM: Manke site (core samples, photos, epibenthic pump samples)\n\nThursday, 9/8/2011: depart UW at 4:30 AM: Foss site (Fish recapture study)\n\ncheers,\n\nSean\n\n*****************************************\n\nP.
