        "text": "During a visit to the White House she discussed new initiatives to fight tuberculosis and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains with Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of Health Donna Shalala, and president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn. And in the first visit by a WHO Director-General to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bruntland announced details of a multi-agency, multi-program malaria initiative called Roll Back Malaria (RBM).\n\nDuring her speech to NIH scientists and administrators, Brundtland said that as WHO's reorganization takes hold (Nature Med. 4, 992; 1998), it will be in position to direct worldwide public health research and intervention instead of merely serving as an information clearinghouse."
