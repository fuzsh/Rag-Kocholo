        "text": "Dr. Gro Brundtland is a highly respected former Norwegian Prime Minister and International envoy.\n\nDr. Brundtland began her domestic political career as the Norwegian Minister for Environmental Affairs (1974-79). In 1981 she became Norway’s first, and to date, only female Prime Minister, a role she reprised twice more from 1986-89 and 1990-96. During this period she became internationally renowned for the high proportion of female ministers appointed to her cabinet.\n\nDr. Brundtland has also held leading positions in many international organisations. In 1983 she chaired the World Commission on Environmental Development (WCED) – widely referred to as the “Brundtland Commission”- that resulted in the Our Common Future report, still held as a landmark publication of Sustainable Development. In 1998 Dr. Brundtland, a medical doctor by training, was elected Director-General of the World Health Organisation."
