        "text": "The Norwegian series Power (Makta) will focus on Norway’s former Prime Minister and prominent leader of the Labour Party, Gro Harlem Brundtland.\n\nThe series just received NOK10 million from the Norwegian Film Institute towards its NOK 136 million budget.\n\nAccording to the NFI, Power will follow the internal power struggle in the Norwegian Labour Party in the late 70s, as Brundtland navigates her path to become Labour leader and eventually Norway’s first female Prime Minister.\n\nBrundtland has been an influential figure in Norwegian politics, leading the Labour Party three times to victory (1981, 1986 to 1989, 1990 to 1996). Trained as a physician, she is also a former director general of the World Health Organisation, and a leading advocate of environmental sustainability.\n\nAccording to the media outlet ‘Dagsavisen’, Power will be the first TV drama about Brundtland and the Norwegian Labour Party’s recent history.\n\nThe 12-part series is created by seasoned writer Johan Fasting (Home Ground) together with actors Silje Storstein (Witch Hunt, Young & Promising) and Kristin Grue (Beforeigners, The Machinery) who both came up with the idea.\n\nDirector Yngve Sve Flikke (Home Ground, Ninjababy) serves as concept director. Motlys’ Kathrine Hagen and November Film’s Camilla Brusdal are producing for NRK. Details about the ambitious TV show will be unveiled closer to the start of principal photography, in the fall 2021.\n\nTwo other TV series received support from the Norwegian Film Institute:\n\nJonas is produced by The Oslo Company for Discovery Networks Norway. The series centres on Sara and Jonas who meet by chance when a subway has to be evacuated in Oslo. Emotions flare up again between the former lovers, but Sara soon discovers that Jonas has a dark secret-a close link with the far-right movement.\n\nThe show is created by Marie Hafting (Young & Promising), who also serves as co-writer with Erika Calmeyer (Nudes) and seasoned writer Nikolaj Frobenius (Insomnia, Pioneer). Stian Kristiansen (Witch Hunt, Home Ground) is concept director.\n\nKlasse VIS is an animated series for children, created and directed by Marianne Müller and Trond Jacobsen for Bivrost Film & TV.\n\nThe NFI also supported two feature films:"
