        "text": "Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products for a variety of purposes described below, including to operate effectively and provide you with the best experiences with our products. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a Microsoft account, administer your organizationâs licensing account, submit a search query to Bing, register for a Microsoft event, upload a document to OneDrive, sign up for Microsoft 365, or contact us for support. We get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experience with our products and communications.\n\nWe rely on a variety of legal reasons and permissions (sometimes called âlegal basesâ) to process data, including with your consent, a balancing of legitimate interests, necessity to enter into and perform contracts, and compliance with legal obligations, for a variety of purposes described below.\n\nWe also obtain data from third parties. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third-party sources vary over time and include:\n\nData brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.\n\nServices that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.\n\nCommunication services, including email providers and social networks, when you give us permission to access your data on such third-party services or networks.\n\nService providers that help us determine your deviceâs location.\n\nPartners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.\n\nDevelopers who create experiences through or for Microsoft products.\n\nThird parties that deliver experiences through Microsoft products.\n\nPublicly-available sources, such as open public sector, academic, and commercial data sets and other data sources.\n\nIf you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a Microsoft account provided by your organization, please see the Products provided by your organization and the Microsoft account sections for more information.\n\nYou have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When you are asked to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to operate and provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to operate and provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product youâre using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use the data will not work for you.\n\nThe data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make (including your privacy settings), the products and features you use, your location, and applicable law.\n\nThe data we collect can include the following:\n\nName and contact data. Your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.\n\nCredentials. Passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.\n\nDemographic data. Data about you such as your age, gender, country, and preferred language.\n\nPayment data. Data to process payments, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number) and the security code associated with your payment instrument.\n\nSubscription and licensing data. Information about your subscriptions, licenses, and other entitlements.\n\nInteractions. Data about your use of Microsoft products. In some cases, such as search queries, this is data you provide in order to make use of the products. In other cases, such as error reports, this is data we generate. Other examples of interactions data include:\n\nDevice and usage data. Data about your device and the product and features you use, including information about your hardware and software, how our products perform, as well as your settings. For example:\n\nPayment and account history. Data about the items you purchase and activities associated with your account.\n\nBrowse history. Data about the webpages you visit.\n\nDevice, connectivity, and configuration data. Data about your device, your device configuration, and nearby networks. For example, data about the operating systems and other software installed on your device, including product keys. In addition, IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), regional and language settings, and information about WLAN access points near your device.\n\nError reports and performance data. Data about the performance of the products and any problems you experience, including error reports. Error reports (sometimes called âcrash dumpsâ) can include details of the software or hardware related to an error, contents of files opened when an error occurred, and data about other software on your device.\n\nTroubleshooting and help data. Data you provide when you contact Microsoft for help, such as the products you use, and other details that help us provide support. For example, contact or authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with Microsoft, data about the condition of your device, and the products you use related to your help inquiry. When you contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded.\n\nBot usage data. Interactions with bots and skills available through Microsoft products, including bots and skills provided by third parties.\n\nInterests and favorites. Data about your interests and favorites, such as the sports teams you follow, the programming languages you prefer, the stocks you track, or cities you add to track things like weather or traffic. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favorites can also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.\n\nContent consumption data. Information about media content (e.g., TV, video, music, audio, text books, apps, and games) you access through our products.\n\nSearches and commands. Search queries and commands when you use Microsoft products with search or related productivity functionality, such as interactions with a chat bot.\n\nVoice data. Your voice data, sometimes referred to as âvoice clipsâ, such as search queries, commands, or dictation you speak, which may include background sounds.\n\nText, inking, and typing data. Text, inking, and typing data and related information. For example, when we collect inking data, we collect information about the placement of your inking instrument on your device.\n\nImages. Images and related information, such as picture metadata. For example, we collect the image you provide when you use a Bing image-enabled service.\n\nContacts and relationships. Data about your contacts and relationships if you use a product to share information with others, manage contacts, communicate with others, or improve your productivity.\n\nSocial data. Information about your relationships and interactions between you, other people, and organizations, such as types of engagement (e.g., likes, dislikes, events, etc.) related to people and organizations.\n\nLocation data. Data about your deviceâs location, which can be either precise or imprecise. For example, we collect location data using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (e.g., GPS) and data about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. Location can also be inferred from a deviceâs IP address or data in your account profile that indicates where it is located with less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.\n\nOther input. Other inputs provided when you use our products. For example, data such as the buttons you press on an Xbox wireless controller using the Xbox network, skeletal tracking data when you use Kinect, and other sensor data, like the number of steps you take, when you use devices that have applicable sensors. If you attend an in-store event, we collect the data you provide to us when registering for or during the event and if you enter into a prize promotion, we collect the data you input into the entry form.\n\nContent. Content of your files and communications you input, upload, receive, create, and control. For example, if you transmit a file using Skype to another Skype user, we need to collect the content of that file to display it to you and the other user. If you receive an email using Outlook.com, we need to collect the content of that email to deliver it to your inbox, display it to you, enable you to reply to it, and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Other content we collect when providing products to you include:\n\nCommunications, including audio, video, text (typed, inked, dictated, or otherwise), in a message, email, call, meeting request, or chat.\n\nPhotos, images, songs, movies, software, and other media or documents you store, retrieve, or otherwise process with our cloud.\n\nVideo or recordings. Recordings of events and activities at Microsoft buildings, retail spaces, and other locations. If you enter Microsoft Store locations or other facilities, or attend a Microsoft event that is recorded, we may process your image and voice data.\n\nFeedback and ratings. Information you provide to us and the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, survey data, and product reviews you write.\n\nTraffic data. Data generated through your use of Microsoftâs communications services. Traffic data indicates with whom you have communicated and when your communications occurred. We will process your traffic data only as required to provide, maintain, and improve our communications services and we do so with your consent.\n\nProduct-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those products.\n\nYou can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft. You can control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Microsoft or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:\n\nControl the use of your data for personalized advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt-out page.\n\nChoose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from Microsoft.\n\nAccess and clear some of your data through the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\n\nNot all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form.\n\nWe provide aggregate metrics about user requests to exercise their data protection rights via the Microsoft Privacy Report.\n\nYou can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained with tools Microsoft provides to you, which are described below, or by contacting Microsoft. For instance:\n\nIf Microsoft obtained your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time.\n\nYou can request access to, erasure of, and updates to your personal data.\n\nIf youâd like to port your data elsewhere, you can use tools Microsoft provides to do so, or if none are available, you can contact Microsoft for assistance.\n\nYou can also object to or restrict the use of your personal data by Microsoft. For example, you can object at any time to our use of your personal data:\n\nFor direct marketing purposes.\n\nWhere we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party.\n\nYou may have these rights under applicable laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but we offer them regardless of your location. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.\n\nIf your organization, such as your employer, school, or service provider, provides you with access to and is administering your use of Microsoft products, contact your organization to learn more about how to access and control your personal data.\n\nYou can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, using various tools we provide. The tools most useful to you will depend on our interactions with you and your use of our products. Here is a general list of tools we provide to help you control your personal data; specific products may provide additional controls.\n\nBing. If you are signed into Bing, you can view and clear your stored search and chat history on your privacy dashboard. If you are not signed into Bing, you can view and clear stored search history associated to your device in your Bing settings.\n\nMicrosoft account. If you wish to access, edit, or remove the profile information and payment information in your Microsoft account, change your password, add security information or close your account, you can do so by visiting the Microsoft account website.\n\nIf you have a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) public profile, you can access and edit your data by signing in at MSDN forum.\n\nMicrosoft privacy dashboard. You can control some of the data Microsoft processes through your use of a Microsoft account on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. From here, for example, you can view and clear the browsing, search, and location data associated with your Microsoft account.\n\nMicrosoft Store. You can access your Microsoft Store profile and account information by visiting Microsoft Store and selecting View account or Order history.\n\nMicrosoft Teams for personal use. You can find out how to export or delete Teams data relating to your personal Microsoft account by visiting this page.\n\nOneDrive. You can view, download, and delete your files and photos in OneDrive by signing into your OneDrive.\n\nOutlook.com. You can download your emails in Outlook.com by signing into your account and navigating to your Privacy and data settings.\n\nSkype. If you wish to access, edit, or remove some profile and payment information for Skype or change your password, sign in to your account. If you wish to export your Skype chat history and files shared on Skype, you can request a copy.\n\nVolume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). If you are a Volume Licensing customer, you can control your contact information and subscription and licensing data in one location by visiting the Volume Licensing Service Center website.\n\nXbox. If you use the Xbox network or Xbox.com, you can view or edit your personal data, including billing and account information, privacy settings, and online safety and data sharing preferences by accessing My Xbox on the Xbox console or on the Xbox.com website.\n\nNot all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form. We will respond to requests to control your personal data as required by applicable law.\n\nYour communications preferences\n\nYou can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this web form. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.\n\nYour advertising choices\n\nTo opt out of receiving personalized advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.\n\nYou can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply. You can view our third party ad partners on the U.S. State Data Privacy Laws Notice, and opt-out of data sharing with third parties at our opt-out page.\n\nFor Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.\n\nBecause the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.\n\nYou can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).\n\nBrowser-based controls\n\nWhen you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:\n\nCookie controls. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement.\n\nTracking protections. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge. This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.\n\nBrowser controls for \"Do Not Track.\" Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.\n\nCookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows, for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.\n\nOur use of cookies and similar technologies\n\nMicrosoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:\n\nStoring your preferences and settings. We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, depending on your settings, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft website, we store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device. Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.\n\nSign-in and authentication. We use cookies to authenticate you. When you sign in to a website using your personal Microsoft account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.\n\nSecurity. We use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.\n\nStoring information you provide to a website. We use cookies to remember information you shared. When you provide information to Microsoft, such as when you add products to a shopping cart on Microsoft websites, we store the data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information.\n\nSocial media. Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service.\n\nFeedback. Microsoft uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback on a website.\n\nInterest-based advertising. Microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described in the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.\n\nShowing advertising. Microsoft uses cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen, for example, so you do not see the same one repeatedly.\n\nAnalytics. We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.\n\nPerformance. Microsoft uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps us keep our websites remain up and running.\n\nWhere required, we obtain your consent prior to placing or using optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website; or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication. Please see the âHow to Control Cookiesâ section below for more information.\n\nSome of the cookies we commonly use are listed below. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the primary purposes for which we typically set cookies. If you visit one of our websites, the site will set some or all of the following cookies:\n\nMSCC. Contains user choices for most Microsoft properties.\n\nMUID, MC1, MSFPC, and MSPTC. Identifies unique web browsers visiting Microsoft sites. These cookies are used for advertising, site analytics, and other operational purposes.\n\nANON. Contains the ANID, a unique identifier derived from your Microsoft account, which is used for advertising, personalization, and operational purposes. It is also used to preserve your choice to opt out of interest-based advertising from Microsoft if you have chosen to associate the opt-out with your Microsoft account.\n\nCC. Contains a country code as determined from your IP address.\n\nPPAuth, MSPAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth, WLSSC, MSPProf. Helps to authenticate you when you sign in with your Microsoft account.\n\nMC0. Detects whether cookies are enabled in the browser.\n\nMS0. Identifies a specific session.\n\nNAP. Contains an encrypted version of your country, postal code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on your Microsoft account profile.\n\nMH. Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser. This cookie identifies the advertiser, so the right ad is selected.\n\nchildinfo, kcdob, kcrelid, kcru, pcfm. Contains information that Microsoft account uses within its pages in relation to child accounts.\n\nMR. This cookie is used by Microsoft to reset or refresh the MUID cookie.\n\nx-ms-gateway-slice. Identifies a gateway for load balancing.\n\nTOptOut. Records your decision not to receive interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft. Where required, we place this cookie by default and remove it when you consent to interest-based advertising.\n\nWe may also use the cookies of other Microsoft affiliates, companies, and partners, such as LinkedIn and Xandr.\n\nThird Party Cookies\n\nIn addition to the cookies Microsoft sets when you visit our websites, we also use cookies from third parties to enhance the services on our sites. Some third parties can also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites. For example:\n\nCompanies we hire to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics, place cookies when you visit our sites.\n\nCompanies that deliver content on Microsoft sites, such as videos or news, or ads, place cookies on their own.\n\nThese companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services.\n\nThe following types of third-party cookies may be used, depending on the context, service or product, as well as your settings and permissions:\n\nSocial Media cookies. We and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on our websites. Theyâre used to connect your activity on our websites to your social media profiles so the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests.\n\nAnalytics cookies.We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better and the third parties can develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by Microsoft. For example, analytics cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.\n\nAdvertising cookies.We and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads by recording which ads you've already seen. They're also used to track which ads you click on or purchases you make after clicking on an ad for payment purposes, and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, they're used to detect when you click on an ad and show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.\n\nRequired cookies.We use required cookies to perform essential website functions. For example, to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, and measure audiences. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.\n\nWhere required, we obtain your consent prior to placing or using optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website; or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication.\n\nFor a list of the third parties that set cookies on our websites, including service providers acting on our behalf, please visit our third party cookie inventory. The third party cookie inventory also includes links to those third partiesâ websites or privacy notices. Please consult the third party websites or privacy notices for more information on their privacy practices with respect to their cookies that may be set on our websites. On some of our websites, a list of third parties is available directly on the site. The third parties on these sites may not be included in the list on our third party cookie inventory.\n\nHow to control cookies\n\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by selecting Settings > Privacy and services > Clear Browsing data > Cookies and other site data. For more information about how to delete your cookies in Microsoft browsers, see Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge Legacy, or Internet Explorer. If you use a different browser, refer to that browserâs instructions.\n\nAs mentioned above, where required, we obtain your consent before placing or using optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website; or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication. We separate these optional cookies by purpose, such as for advertising and social media purposes. You may consent to certain categories of optional cookies and not others. You also may adjust your choices by clicking âManage cookiesâ in the footer of the website or through the settings made available on the website. Certain features of Microsoft products depend on cookies. If you choose to block cookies, you cannot sign in or use some of those features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies will be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, are deleted and will need to be recreated.\n\nAdditional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the tracking protections feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.\n\nOur use of web beacons and analytics services\n\nSome Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.\n\nIn addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us to, for example, develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website. It also allows us to understand your activity on the website of a Microsoft partner in connection with your use of a Microsoft product or service.\n\nFinally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by visiting any of the following sites: Adjust, AppsFlyer, Clicktale, Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics (requires you to install a browser add-on), Kissmetrics, Mixpanel, Nielsen, Acuity Ads, WebTrends, or Optimizely.\n\nOther similar technologies\n\nIn addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or \"Flash cookies\") and Silverlight Application Storage.\n\nLocal Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies.\" Websites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use Local Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies\" to store data on your computer. To learn how to manage or block Flash cookies, go to the Flash Player help page.\n\nSilverlight Application Storage. Websites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, see the Silverlight section of this privacy statement.\n\nFor users under the age of 13 or as specified by law in their jurisdiction, certain Microsoft products and services will either block users under that age or will ask them to obtain consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it, including when creating an account to access Microsoft services. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.\n\nOnce parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. Learn more about parental consent and Microsoft child accounts.\n\nParents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, the parent or guardian can manage their childâs information and settings on their Family Safety page and view and delete a childâs data on their privacy dashboard. Accounts that require parental consent to be created are automatically included as part of the family group of the individual who provided the consent for account creation. For child accounts that do not require parental consent to be created (e.g., for children who are over the age at which parental consent is legally required), the parent or guardian may still use a family group, but must add the child account to their family group after the account is created. See below for more information about how to access and delete child data.\n\nBelow is additional information about the collection of data from children, including more details as related to Xbox.\n\nAccessing and deletingâ¯childâ¯data. For Microsoft products and services that require parental consent, a parent can view and delete certain data belonging to their child from the parentâs privacy dashboard: browsing history, search history, location activity, media activity, apps and service activity, and product and service performance data. To delete this data, a parent can sign in to their privacy dashboard and manage their childâs activities. Please note that a parentâs ability to access and/or delete a childâs personal information on their privacy dashboard will vary depending on the laws where you are located.\n\nAdditionally, a parent can contact our privacy support team through the privacy support form and, following authentication, request that the data types on the privacy dashboard together with the following data be deleted: software, setup, and inventory; device connectivity and configuration; feedback and ratings; fitness and activity; support content; support interactions; and environmental sensor. We process authenticated deletion requests within 30 days of receipt.\n\nPlease note that content like emails, contacts, and chats are accessible through in-product experiences. You can find more information about data you are able to control within Microsoft products by visiting our Privacy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).\n\nIf your childâs account is not a part of your Microsoft family group and you do not have access to your childâs activity on your privacy dashboard, then you need to submit a request related to your childâs data through the privacy support form. The privacy team will ask for account verification before fulfilling the request.\n\nTo delete all of your childâs personal information, you must request deletion of the childâs account through the close your account form. This link will prompt you to sign in with your childâs account credentials. Check that the page shows the correct Microsoft account, and then follow the instructions to request that your childâs account be deleted. Learn more about how to close a Microsoft account.\n\nAfter you submit the request to close your childâs account, we will wait 60 days before permanently deleting the account in case you change your mind or need to access something on the account before it is permanently closed and deleted. During the waiting period, the account is marked for closure and permanent deletion, but it still exists. If you want to reopen your childâs Microsoft account, just sign in again within that 60-day period. We will cancel the account closure, and the account will be reinstated.\n\nWhat is Xbox? Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft. Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms. This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.\n\nWhen users sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on an Xbox console, we assign a unique identifier to their device. For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the consoleâs operating system they are using.\n\nXbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\n\nData we collect when you create an Xbox profile. You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old or as otherwise specified by your jurisdiction. With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network. During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group. We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security. If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.\n\nWe collect limitedâ¯information about children,â¯includingâ¯name, birthdate, email address, and region.â¯When you signâ¯your childâ¯up for an Xbox profile,â¯they getâ¯a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you createâ¯your childâs Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharingâ¯information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network.â¯Your childâs privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.\n\nData we collect. We collect information about your childâs use of Xbox services, games, apps, and devices including:\n\nWhen they sign in and sign out of Xbox, purchase history, and content they obtain.\n\nWhich games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.\n\nPerformance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and network connection, including any software or hardware errors.\n\nContent they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.\n\nSocial activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.\n\nIf your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.\n\nXbox diagnostic data. If your child uses Xbox console, Xbox will send required data to Microsoft. Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\n\nGame captures. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other playersâ game clips and screenshots can capture your childâs in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your childâs privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.\n\nCaptioning. During Xbox real-time (âpartyâ) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it. This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox.\n\nData use. Microsoft uses the data we collect when your child uses Xbox to improve gaming products and experiencesâ making it safer and more fun over time. Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with curated experiences. This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.\n\nXbox data viewable by others. When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presenceâ¯(which can be set to âappear offlineâ or âblockedâ), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network. Depending onâ¯how you set your childâs Xbox safety settings, theyâ¯might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.\n\nSafety. In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips your child uploads, conversations they have, and things they post in clubs and games).\n\nAnti-cheat and fraud prevention. Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. Such technologies may create digital signatures (known as âhashesâ) using certain information collected from their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, and how they use that device. This can include information about the browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system.\n\nXbox data shared with game and apps publishers. When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product. This data may include: your childâs Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your childâs in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your childâs presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.\n\nThird-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies. You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your childâs data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.\n\nLearn more at Data Sharing with Games and Apps.\n\nTo stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed. Some publisher access to your childâs data may be revoked at microsoft.com/consent.\n\nManaging child settings. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a childâs information and settings on their Family Safety page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their Xbox Privacy & online safety page.\n\nYou can also use the Xbox Family Settings app to manage your childâs experience on the Xbox Network including: spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, viewing your childâs Xbox activity, and setting age ratings and the amount of screen time. Xbox-specific Family Safety settings will apply on Xbox console or via Xbox on PC or mobile device but may not be applied on other platforms.\n\nLearn more about managing Xbox profiles at Xbox online safety and privacy settings.\n\nLearn more about Microsoft family groups at Simplify your familyâs life.\n\nLegacy.\n\nXbox 360. This Xbox console collects limited required diagnostic data. This data helps keep your childâs console functioning as expected.\n\nKinect. The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control game play. For example:\n\nIf you choose, the camera can be used to sign in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition. This data stays on the console, is not shared with anyone, and can be deleted at any time.\n\nFor game play, Kinect will map distances between the joints on your childâs body to create a stick figure representation to enable play.\n\nThe Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play. The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms.\n\nThe Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.\n\nLearn more about Kinect at Xbox Kinect and Privacy.\n\nIf you are a U.S. resident, we process your personal data in accordance with applicable U.S. state data privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This section of our privacy statement contains information required by the CCPA and other U.S. state data privacy laws and supplements our privacy statement.\n\nPlease note that recent changes to the CCPA and other state data privacy laws are set to take effect in 2023; however, the rules implementing some of these laws have not yet been finalized. We are continuously working to better comply with these laws, and we will update our processes and disclosures as these implementing rules are finalized.\n\nPlease also see our U.S. State Data Privacy Laws Notice and our Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy for additional information about the data we collect, process, share and disclose, and your rights under applicable U.S. state data privacy laws.\n\nSale.

In some situations, Microsoft may process de-identified data. Data is in this state when we are not able to link data to an individual to whom such data may relate without taking additional steps. In those instances, and unless allowed under applicable law, we will maintain such information in a de-identified state, and will not try to re-identify the individual to whom the de-identified data relates.\n\nDisclosures of personal data for business or commercial purposes. As indicated in the Reasons we share personal data section, we share personal data with third parties for various business and commercial purposes.

In certain situations, we may allow a third party to control the collection of your personal data. For example, third party applications or extensions that run on Windows or Edge browser may collect personal data based on their own practices.\n\nMicrosoft allows advertising companies to collect information about your interactions with our websites in order to deliver personalized ads on Microsoftâs behalf. These companies include: Meta, LinkedIn, Google, and Adobe.\n\nMicrosoft 365, previous versions called Office 365, is a collection of subscription productivity services and applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote, among others. Office is the one-time purchase version of these applications available on PC or Mac and includes Access and Publisher. Both Microsoft 365 and Office are comprised of client software applications and connected online services (or web apps in the case of Microsoft 365 for the web) that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. For more details about Outlook, see the Outlook section of this privacy statement.\n\nVarious cloud-based Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing, and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. You can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office apps. For more information, see Account Privacy Settings.\n\nOffice Roaming Service. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your settings, including your privacy settings, up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365 or Office apps. When you sign in to your apps with either your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the service syncs some of your customized settings to Microsoft servers. For example, the service syncs a list of most recently used documents or the last location viewed within a document. When you sign in to another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. When you sign out of your apps, the service removes your settings from your device. Any changes you make to your customized settings are sent to Microsoft servers.\n\nUpdates from Microsoft. Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run, Microsoft AutoUpdate (for Mac), or Microsoft Update (for some versions of Office) to provide you with security and other important updates.\n\nThese services can automatically detect the availability of online updates for Microsoft 365 or Office apps on your device and download and install them automatically.\n\nDiagnostic Data. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Microsoft 365 or Office apps secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a userâs name or email address, the content of the userâs files, or information about apps unrelated to Microsoft 365 or Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.\n\nRequired. The minimum data necessary to help keep apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device itâs installed on.\n\nOptional. Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.\n\nSee Diagnostic Data for more information.\n\nConnected Experiences. Microsoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. A subset of these connected experiences is also available in Office. If you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to help keep these connected experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected. See below for additional information about required service data.\n\nWorking with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences.\n\nExperiences that analyze your content. Experiences that use your file content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.\n\nExperiences that download online content. Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.\n\nYou can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office client apps. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below. These controls are not available when using Microsoft 365 for the web, since you will already be cloud-connected. For more information about accessing these controls, see Account Privacy Settings.\n\nIf you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.\n\nEssential services. There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 and Office functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See Essential Services for more information.\n\nRequired service data for connected experiences. As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience. This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences. We refer to this data as required service data.\n\nRequired service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience. Your text and the translation are not stored by our service. Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Microsoft 365 or Office app.\n\nSee Required service data for more information.\n\nCopilot Pro. Available as a separate subscription service in select countries, the Copilot Pro features that appear in Microsoft 365 provide AI-powered productivity capabilities through real-time conversational experiences by applying large language model (LLM) processing on the content you choose to provide in Microsoft 365 apps including Word, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, and PowerPoint. Copilot Pro is not available for use in Office. When used with available Microsoft 365 apps, Copilot Pro will use the content in your files only when you ask it to perform a specific action on that specific content - for example, when you ask Copilot Pro to help you rewrite a paragraph in a Word document or ask Copilot Pro to generate a to-do list from your notes in OneNote. Similar to connected experiences, required service data is collected during your use of Copilot Pro that includes information related to its operation that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\n\nSee Copilot Pro: Microsoft 365 apps and your privacy for more information.\n\nOther Productivity Apps. Microsoft provides several productivity apps separate from Microsoft 365 and Office, including Whiteboard (a free form digital canvas using touch, type, and pen), To Do (a cloud-based task management app), and Sticky Notes (a desktop notes app).\n\nThe apps use various cloud-based services to provide you with functionality from other Microsoft products, such as providing images from Bing in Whiteboard, recommending suggested tasks to add to My Day in To Do, and taking advantage of Sticky Notes' integration with Outlook.\n\nUsing device capabilities. Some Microsoft 365 applications make use of your device capabilities using certain features. In PowerPoint, the presentation recording feature can access your device microphone and camera to record presentations with audio and video. Your device microphone is also accessed via the Record audio feature and when using Speaker Coach. As you speak, Speaker Coach gives you on-screen guidance about pacing, inclusive language, use of profanity, filler words, and whether youâre reading the slide text. When creating a PowerPoint presentation, you can also use the Screenshot and Screen clipping features to capture screen contents. Some Microsoft 365 applications, PowerPoint, Word, and OneNote, provide Dictate, a connected experience which lets you use speech-to-text to author content using your microphone. In Word and OneNote, the Transcribe connected experience converts speech recorded directly in the app using your microphone or using a speech audio recording to a text transcript with each speaker individually separated. OneNote can insert photos or record video using your camera. All Microsoft 365 apps along with To Do and Whiteboard have sharing functionality that accesses your contacts to allow you to share your documents with others in your contacts list. Applications will not access your device capabilities until you begin using the feature.\n\nYou can manage your microphone and camera access settings in the Windows Privacy Settings menu. Go to Start > Settings > Privacy or Privacy & Security. To learn more about how to control your privacy settings in apps, see Windows privacy settings that apps use.\n\nThis section applies to the consumer offering of Teams; if you are using Teams with a school or work account, see the Enterprise and developer products of this privacy statement.\n\nTeams is an all-in-one collaboration and communication hub. Teams lets you stay organised and connected across your entire life. Teams allows you to call people with voice or video calling. Teams allows you to easily find people, files, photos, conversations, tasks, and calendars in one convenient and secure place.

With your consent, you can share your location with friends and family.\n\nAs part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication. Microsoft may share this information with Enterprise customers when you interact through meetings and chats with end users who are using their school or work account. For instance, if you engage in a Teams chat with a user who is using Teams associated with their school account, Microsoft may share your information with that user's school as part of providing the Teams service.\n\nTeams profile. Your Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information. Your Teams profile may be visible to Enterprise customers and their end users when you engage with an end user of an organization in chats and meetings.\n\nTeams contacts. With your permission, Teams will sync your device, Outlook, and Skype contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device, Outlook, or Skype address books. You are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time. If you choose to stop syncing your device, Outlook, or Skype contacts, or you are inactive on your device, any contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams. If you wish to invite any of your device, Outlook, or Skype contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations. You can block users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.\n\nNotice to non-user contacts. If your information appears in the device, Outlook, or Skype address books of a Teams user who chooses to sync their device, Outlook, or Skype contacts with their Teams contacts, Microsoft may process your data in order to determine whether you are a current Teams user and to allow Teams users to invite you to the service, including via SMS and email. As long as the Teams user continues to be active on Teams on their device and continues to enable contact syncing with the applicable device or service, your information will be stored on our servers and we will periodically process your information as a part of the Teams userâs contact syncing experience to check whether you have subsequently joined Teams.\n\nLearn more about how we process your information in connection with the contact syncing feature offered to Teams users.\n\nIf you do choose to join Teams, you will appear as a suggested new Teams contact for any Teams users with your information in their device, Outlook, or Skype address books.

If you gave your consent to use those third-party contacts on other Microsoft apps and services, these contacts will still be available to those other Microsoft apps and services.\n\nYou can remove third-party contacts from all Microsoft apps and services by removing third-party accounts from Teams. Please note that removing a third-party account from Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services that also use that third-party account.\n\nTeams calendar. You can also choose to sync your Teams calendar with calendars from third-party providers. You can stop syncing your Teams calendar anytime by removing a third-party account from Teams. If you have consented to use third-party data on other Microsoft apps and services, please note that removing this third-party account data in Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services.\n\nLocation sharing. You can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams. You are in control and can stop sharing at any time. Sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.\n\nPush notifications. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.\n\nIf you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.\n\nChats and meetings with Enterprise customer end users. Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses, as well as individual users. Please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement if you are using Teams with a work or school account. If you engage in Teams meetings or chats with end users of organizations, the data you share with the end users is subject to their organizationâs policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries related to your data shared through chats and meetings with an organizationâs end users, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to the organizationâs administrator.

To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companiesâ services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that companyâs privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers.\n\nSkype Manager. Skype Manager lets you manage a groupâs (such as your familyâs) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their Skype account page.\n\nPush notifications. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company.

If you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.\n\nTranslation features. When you use Skypeâs translation features, Skype collects and uses your conversation to provide the translation service. With your permission, your data may be used to help improve Microsoft products and services. To help the translation and speech recognition technology learn and grow, sentences and automatic transcripts are analyzed and any corrections are entered into our system, to build better performing services. This data may include manual transcription of your voice clips. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.\n\nRecording features. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.\n\nSkype bots. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.\n\nCaptioning. Certain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning.

If a user activates this feature, other call participants will not receive a notification. Microsoft uses this voice and text data to provide captioning of audio for users.\n\nCamera Features. When you use the camera feature in Skype, you can choose to enhance your video and images with third party lens services. Lens is a feature that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to transform your selfies in a fun way, such as making you look like your favorite animal. Using the camera in Skype, you can select the lens feature that is incorporated in the Skype to transform your face and hands. Depending on which lens you choose, your video and images may be processed to extract information about the location of different areas on your face and hands. The extracted data is used for the sole purpose of applying AR effects to your face and hands. None of this data is used to personally identify you. This data is processed for the duration of the session on your device only, and then deleted immediately. This data is not sent to Skype or any third party.\n\nBing services include search and mapping services, as well as other apps and programs described in this section. Bing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\n\nWhen you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\n\nAI-enhanced Bing search. Bing search now includes an AI-enhanced web search functionality, using Microsoft Copilot in Bing, which supports users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through the chat experience, and sparking creativity by helping users create content. Copilot in Bingâs use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bingâs core web search offering as described in this section. More information about Copilot in Bing is available at Copilot in Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI.\n\nSearch suggestions. For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings. There are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser. Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in the search box in Windows 10 and Windows 11. If you choose, you can always hide the search box or icon on the taskbar.\n\nBing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\n\nRetention and de-identification. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.\n\nPersonalization through Microsoft account. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\n\nManaging search history. When youâre signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search and chat history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Microsoft Copilot in Bing are also remembered as âRecent activityâ. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.\n\nThird-party services that use Bing. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\n\nData passed to destination website. When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visitâsuch as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, https://www.bing.com/).\n\nSharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties. We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\n\nWhenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' or online servicesâ web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Certain features in Microsoft Edge, such as when you open a new tab in the browser, connect you to Microsoft Start Content and your experiences with such content is covered by the Microsoft Start section of this privacy statement. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.\n\nMicrosoft Edge for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows 10 and later and is also available on other supported versions of Windows and macOS.\n\nData about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Clear Browsing History.\n\nMicrosoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:\n\nSettings and More. Allows you to manage your favorites, downloads, history, extensions, and collections.\n\nCollections. Allows you to collect text, images, videos, and other content in a note page in your browser. When you drag content into your collection, it is cached on your device and can be deleted through your collection.\n\nWebsite Pin to Taskbar. Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.\n\nMicrosoft collects data necessary to provide features you request in Microsoft Edge. When signed into Microsoft Edge using your Microsoft personal account or work or school account, Microsoft Edge will sync your browser data saved on your device across other signed-in devices. You may choose which browser data to sync, including your favorites, browsing history, extensions and associated data, settings, open tabs, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), passwords, payment information, and other data types as they become available. If you choose to sync extensions that you acquired from third-party web stores, a copy of those extensions will be downloaded directly from those web stores on your synced device(s). If you have turned on Password Monitor, your saved credentials are hashed, encrypted and sent to Microsoftâs Password Monitor service to warn you if your credentials were detected as part of a malicious attack or a breach. Microsoft does not retain this data after the check is complete. You can disable or configure syncing in the Microsoft Edge settings.\n\nWhen you sign into Microsoft Edge with your Microsoft personal account or work or school account, Microsoft Edge will store your accountâs privacy preferences. Microsoft Edge will use the stored preferences to migrate your accountâs privacy choices across your signed-in devices, including during Windows device set up or when you sign into Microsoft Edge with your account on a new device.\n\nMicrosoft Edgeâs Search and site suggestions uses your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search recommendations. Microsoft Edge sends the information you type into the browser address bar to the default search provider configured in the address bar to offer search recommendations as you type each character. You can turn off these features at any time in the browser settings. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge sends your search queries, standard device informa"
