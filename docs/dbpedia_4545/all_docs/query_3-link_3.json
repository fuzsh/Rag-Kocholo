        "text": "On June 18th, 2022, the World Swimming Championship began in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The international competition included a discipline called artistic swimming. A young athlete, Anita Alvarez, a member of the American team, took part in the artistic swimming round. Thanks to AFP's sophisticated technology and know-how in underwater photography, this unbelievable scene was captured by AFP photographer Oli Scarff and it gave rise to some surreal images of this rescue."
