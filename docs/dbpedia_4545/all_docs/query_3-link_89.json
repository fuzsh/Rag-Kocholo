Credit card is subject to credit qualification.\n\nYou may not qualify for an additional Wells Fargo-branded credit card if you have opened a Wells Fargo-branded credit card in the last 6 months.\n\nYou may not be eligible for introductory annual percentage rates, fees and/or rewards bonus offers if you have the card product you are applying for or opened one within the last 48 months – even if that account is closed and has a $0 balance.\n\nFootnote 1. To qualify for the 20,000 bonus rewards points, a total of at least $1,000 in net purchases (purchases minus returns/credits) must post to your account within 3 months from the date your account is opened. These bonus rewards points will show as redeemable within 1 – 2 billing periods after they are earned. Cash advances and balance transfers do not apply for purposes of this offer and may affect the credit line available for this offer. ATM transactions, cash advances of any kind, balance transfers, SUPERCHECKS™, cash equivalents such as money orders and prepaid gift cards, casino gaming chips, wire transfers, off-track wagers, lottery tickets, or bets or wagers transmitted over the internet, fees or interest posted to a linked account, including but not limited to returned payment fees, late fees, and monthly or annual fees, do not earn rewards points. Refer to the Summary of the Wells Fargo Rewards® Program Terms and Conditions and the Wells Fargo Autograph Visa® Card Addendum for details. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 2.

Redeem for Purchases allows you to redeem your Wells Fargo Rewards® online for a statement credit to your eligible Wells Fargo credit card account. To be eligible for Redeem for Purchases, transactions must be $1 or more and you must have enough rewards to redeem for the entire amount of the transaction.

Rewards redeemed for purchases will be deducted from your rewards account balance immediately and all rewards redemptions are final. Statement credits will post to your account in 5 to 7 business days. Redeem for Purchases is offered subject to the Wells Fargo Rewards® Program Terms and Conditions and Addendum for the Wells Fargo Autographservice mark℠ Card.

Pay with Rewards (“PWR”) feature allows you to redeem your available Wells Fargo Rewards® (”rewards”) online through participating PWR merchants toward qualifying purchase transactions with your eligible Wells Fargo credit card (“card”) account. To be eligible for PWR feature, cardholders must first verify the PWR sharing preference setting is enabled. This preference can be set at any time by going to Pay with Rewards Preferences. When your PWR sharing preference is enabled, all cardholders who use and have access to your card, including authorized users on your card, will be able to view and redeem the rewards associated with that card through the PWR feature when the card is provided by you or your authorized users to a PWR merchant. Rewards are not earned on any portion of a transaction redeemed through the PWR feature. Transactions qualifying as eligible for PWR redemption may change at any time and without notice. Rewards redeemed through PWR will be deducted from your rewards account balance immediately and all PWR redemptions are subject to the Return/Cancelation Policy of the merchant. Refer to the Wells Fargo Rewards® Program Terms and Conditions and Addendum for the Wells Fargo Autographservice mark℠ Card, the participating PWR merchant User Agreement, and the Pay with Rewards Terms and Conditions for more details. ←back to content Return to Footnote 4\n\nFootnote 5. Cellular Telephone Protection can reimburse the Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card cardholder for damage to, theft of, or involuntary and accidental parting of a cell phone. This is supplemental coverage not otherwise covered by another insurance policy (for example, cell phone insurance programs, or your homeowner’s, renter’s, automobile, or employer’s insurance policies) and may be applied after all other insurance is exhausted. Reimbursement is limited to the cost to repair or replace your original cell phone, less a $25 deductible with an allowable maximum of two paid claims per 12-month period. Each approved claim has a benefit limit of $600. This benefit does not cover cell phones that are lost (i.e., mysteriously disappear). This protection is only available when cell phone bills are paid with a Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card. The coverage does not apply if the cell phone bill is paid from a Wells Fargo Debit Card, Wells Fargo Business Credit Card, Wells Fargo Commercial Card or from a card that is linked to a Line of Credit. Eligible cell phones are the lines listed on your most recent cellular wireless service provider’s monthly billing statement for the billing cycle prior to when the incident occurred. Electronic failure or issues related to the software of the device are not covered. Cellular Telephone Protection coverage begins the first day of the calendar month following the payment of your first cell phone billing using your Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card, and remains in effect when you continue to charge your total monthly cell phone bill to your Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card. This protection may not be equivalent to or better than other applicable coverage. For complete coverage benefits and exclusions regarding this protection, refer to the Guide to Benefits.\n\nNote:\n\nCall your cellular provider (or sign on to their website) and request to set up automatic payments. Setting up automatic payments is not required to qualify for Cellular Telephone Protection; however, you need to pay your monthly cell phone bill with your Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card to get up to $600 protection. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 6. Coverage provided by this benefit is secondary. In order for coverage to apply, you must pay for all of the cost to rent the car with your eligible Wells Fargo Autographservice mark℠ Card. Cardholder must decline coverage from the rental company to be eligible for this benefit. Certain vehicles are not covered. A maximum benefit amount and certain restrictions and limitations apply. Please review the Wells Fargo Autograph Visa® Card Guide to Benefits for details. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 7. Travel and Emergency Assistance Services provide assistance and referral only. Cardholder is responsible for the cost of any actual medical, legal, transportation, cash advance, or other services or goods provided. Certain restrictions and limitations apply. Please review the Wells Fargo Autograph Visa® Card Guide to Benefits for details. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 8. Current fee for a standard service call will be confirmed at the time service is requested. Rates apply to vehicles up to 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight only. Cardholders are required to pay the service provider for mileage over five miles. Emergency roadside assistance and towing may not be available in all areas. The roadside assistance and towing service provider is solely responsible for any liability associated with use of roadside dispatch services. Certain restrictions and limitations apply. Please review the Wells Fargo Autograph Visa® Card Guide to Benefits for details. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 9. Visa credit cardholders can get an emergency cash advance disbursed or a card replaced within one to three business days, in some cases, within 24 hours, after issuer approval. Any cash advance fees and interest charges that are associated with your credit card account will apply. If you need to replace your card or want help with receiving emergency cash, contact the Visa Global Customer Care Services at: 1-800-397-9010 or call the Visa direct line at 1-303-967-1096 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Please refer to your Wells Fargo Autograph Visa® Card Guide to Benefits for details. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 10. You must activate a deal and use your eligible card to make purchases directly with the merchant providing the deal by the expiration date. Purchases must satisfy all the requirements in the My Wells Fargo Deals Terms and Conditions and the Deal Terms in order to qualify for the deal. Cash back will not be earned on any portion of a purchase transaction that is paid for with store credit, gift certificates, or other payment types. If you pay using a digital wallet or through a third-party provider, or if the merchant uses a mobile or wireless card reader to process your payment, you may not have fulfilled the requirements to redeem the deal and receive the cash back. Cash-back transactions will appear in the form of a statement credit on the eligible card account within 90 days of the deal expiration date. Cash back or statement credits may be reversed if a qualifying purchase is returned or canceled. Refer to the My Wells Fargo Deals Terms and Conditions for details appliable to all eligible cards. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 11. You won't be held responsible for promptly reported unauthorized transactions, subject to certain conditions. For more information, please review the applicable Consumer Credit Card Customer Agreement and Disclosure Statement. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 12. You must be the primary account holder of an eligible Wells Fargo consumer account with a FICO® Score available, and enrolled in Wells Fargo Online®. Eligible Wells Fargo consumer accounts include deposit, loan, and credit accounts, but other consumer accounts may also be eligible. Contact Wells Fargo for details. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply.\n\nPlease note that the score provided under this service is for educational purposes and may not be the score used by Wells Fargo to make credit decisions. Wells Fargo looks at many factors to determine your credit options; therefore, a specific FICO® Score or Wells Fargo credit rating does not guarantee a specific loan rate, approval of a loan, or an upgrade on a credit card. ←back to content\n\nFootnote 13. This experience is for eligible Wells Fargo Autographservice mark℠ cardholders; other Wells Fargo cardholders may be eligible if tickets become available. Simply pay with your eligible Wells Fargo credit card during the specified sales window. The availability of tickets is limited and available only on a first come first serve basis.

Wells Fargo Visa Signature® cardholders are responsible for the payment of any and all charges associated with any goods, services, reservations, or bookings purchased or arranged by the Visa Signature® Concierge on cardholders’ behalf.

In cases where one of the benefits is not available at a hotel, the hotel may provide a substitute benefit of equal value. Some hotels may provide one of the benefits as a standard feature of the room being booked. In those cases, the hotel may or may not provide a substantial benefit of equal value. Resort fees that cover any of the benefits are not reimbursable. Reservations must be booked either on a Visa Luxury Hotel Collection website or through Visa Concierge for benefits to apply.
