Submit evidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant is the beneficiary of a Permanent Labor Certification Application that was filed at least 365 days before the period of admission authorized under AC21 106(a) and (b) begins. You may show this by submitting a copy of a print out from the Department of Labor’s (DOL’s) website or other correspondence from DOL showing the status of the H-1B nonimmigrant’s Permanent Labor Certification Application. If more than 180 days have passed since DOL certified the Permanent Labor Certification Application, also submit a copy of Form I-797 Notice of Receipt for Form I-140 establishing that the Form I-140 was filed within 180 days of such DOL certification;\n\nOR\n\nBased on a Pending Form I-140.

Failure to provide necessary information about the H-1B nonimmigrant may result in a delay in the adjudication or denial of your application for employment authorization.\n\nAs a standalone application because you are currently in H-4 status and do not need to extend your statusThe Lockbox address found on our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 web page."
