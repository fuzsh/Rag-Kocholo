        "text": "About PGA\n\nBringing together the producing team in film, TV and emerging media\n\nThe Producers Guild of America is a non-profit trade organization that represents, protects and promotes the interests of all members of the producing team in film, television and emerging media.\n\nLearn more about us\n\nMember Exclusive Programs\n\nStrength of the Community\n\nPGA members benefit from being part of a community that is more than 8,400 strong with decades of experience in all facets of producing. Members share a deep commitment to giving back and paying it forward within their Guild – whether its volunteering to mentor others or making their first calls when staffing up.\n\nVoices and Faces of the Guild\n\nMeet Some of Our Members\n\nStephanie Allain\n\nJulius Tennon\n\nTonya Lewis Lee\n\nMelanie Cunningham\n\nLori McCreary\n\nThe Application Process\n\nJoin PGA\n\nPGA is a professional trade association. Membership is not automatic.\n\nThe Application Process\n\nThe Vetting Process takes 30 – 90 days\n\nFor membership requirements and costs to join\n\nFor membership qualifying platforms and festivals\n\nFor more information on the Benefits of Joining\n\nApply Now\n\nRequirements for Membership\n\nMembership is based on Guild-recognized qualifying credits and years in the industry.\n\nQuick rule of thumb, you’ll need one of the following for eligibility:\n\nEnough qualifying producing credits within last 7 years for feature films\n\nEnough qualifying producing credits within last 5 years for other formats\n\nReceipt of the PGA Producers Mark (“p.g.a”) on 2 or more feature films with qualifying distribution (automatic qualification)\n\nProducer nominee for the Oscars and Producers Guild Awards and apply within 2 years of your nomination(automatic qualification)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I get health insurance if I join?\n\nUnlike our sister guilds, we do not have a PGA administered health plan. However, there are health care options we connect eligible members to, including the Motion Picture Industry Health Fund Plan.\n\nI recently received “p.g.a.” designation for my screen credit. Am I now a member?\n\nNo. PGA membership and the Producers Mark (p.g.a.) are two completely different designations with separate processes for approval. Membership in PGA is not a requirement to receive the Producers Mark, a certification mark which PGA licenses to the producer(s) of feature-length productions that are identified as performing a majority of the producing functions on a specific motion picture in a decision-making capacity.\n\nI’ve applied for membership before but was denied. How can I be reconsidered?\n\nBefore you re-apply, be sure to check our membership requirements. Criteria can change over time, so check back regularly. Still have questions? Please email applications@producersguild.org\n\nWhat Committees and Groups can PGA members join?\n\nThere are more than a dozen PGA Committees and Groups which any PGA member can join.\n\nIndustry Love\n\nInitiatives\n\nProducers shoulder the responsibility for the tone and tenor of productions. As such, the Guild has established a number of tentpole initiatives for which it is a leader within the industry. Collectively, these initiatives help lead the industry and culture forward.\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging\n\nA Commitment to being One Guild - inclusive and representative of all\n\nPGA Create, a new immersive lab for emerging and mid-career creative producers from backgrounds underrepresented in the industry\n\nMust submit with project in active development, financing or packaging\n\nThe Application for the 2024 Scripted Cycle has closed. Join the mailing list for notification about the next open cycle.\n\nEmployment\n\nIs your company, network, streamer or studio looking to hire?\n\nProducers Mark (p.g.a.)\n\nA certification mark for feature-length productions\n\nIdentifies which producers performed a majority of the producing functions on a specific motion picture in a decision-making capacity\n\nProducers who meet this standard may use the Mark (p.g.a.) next to their names in the onscreen credits and ads for a specific motion picture.\n\nCheck out the requirements\n\nSafety\n\nProducers set the culture and tenor on a set\n\nResources:\n\nFor Independent Productions: Set Etiquette Training (free harassment prevention training and two-hours of free legal consultation related to the training)\n\nFor Individual Producers: Contract Services’ Safety Pass Program (PGA members can access special deals on safety training videos here.)\n\nFor Members of Guilds, Unions and Film Schools: Educational Workshops to help make everyone on your set feel comfortable (for info, email ipsi@producersguild.org)\n\nProduction Safety Playlist on our YouTube channel – #MakeItSafe\n\nSustainability\n\nBest practices to make your production more sustainable\n\nLatest Edition\n\nProduced By magazine is published four times a year. Producers Guild members receive a complimentary subscription with their membership.\n\nWe collect information via cookies in order to analyze use of our Site and improve your experience.
