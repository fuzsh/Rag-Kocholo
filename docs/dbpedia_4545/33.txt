Please enjoy this message from Hugh Jackman, Co-Chair of the ESSENTIAL Campaign Committee, as we celebrate the public launch of the Fundâ€™s ESSENTIAL Campaign!

Founded in 1882, the Entertainment Community Fund is a national human services organization here to meet the needs of our entertainment community with a unique understanding of the challenges involved in a life in the arts.

Support the Entertainment Community Fund or join as a member to enjoy benefits like access to Broadway house seats. Your generosity will help our community in times of need or crisis.
