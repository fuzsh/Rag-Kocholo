It describes how succulents evolved as the Earth's climate changed over millions of years, forming deserts where forests once stood. Succulents developed thick leaves, stems, or branches to store water efficiently, allowing them to survive in dry conditions. The document provides background on succulents before delving into their classification and features in later chapters.",
