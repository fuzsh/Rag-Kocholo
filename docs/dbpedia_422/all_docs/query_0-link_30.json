Missour1 Botanical Garden Vol. LIV No. 1 Bulletin January 1966 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR paar purpose of the Annual S& Report is to put into the OT ¥e record the state of affairs a corst of the Garden for the current year. In this way the Board of Trustees are given a written statement by the Director and the public is kept informed of progress within the insti- tution. I can start with nearly the same opening statement as did Dr. William Trelease who wrote on 14 January 1890: “On assuming control of the Garden, on the 12th of September last, I found that much work was necessary to place many parts of the establish- ment in repair, so as to insure their > preservation.” I began my duties on 7 September instead of the 12th, and I am pretty certain I found things in better repair than did Dr. Trelease In fact I should like to express my gratitude to Henry Hitch- cock, President of the Board of Trus- tees, and Leicester B. Faust, Vice Presi- dent, for their devoted efforts during 75 years ago. the two years the Garden was without a Director. The Director’s residence was redec- orated, air-conditioning installed, and the grounds around it put in first rate condition. For this we are most grate- ful to the Board of Trustees and particular to A. Timon Primm III who served as liaison between the Board and the contractors. The past year, 1965, was a good one for the Garden. Total attendance re- corded by the main gate turnstiles was approximately 490,000 persons, the largest for any single year in the his- tory of the institution A_ pleasant summer, a warm spring, and an ex- tremely sunny autumn combined with the sculpture show (and a well groomed garden) to produce the great attend- ance. The highlight of the year was the display of 30 great pieces of sculp- ture during the month of October within and around the lily ponds be- tween the main gate and the Clima- tron. The Sculpture Show was spon- sored by the Saint Louis Bicentennial Corporation. This was one of the truly great exhibits of art in America, a perfect combination of sculpture and plants, of reflected images, of geometrical contrasts, of color and form rarely seen in any community. Over 70,000 persons witnessed the showing (among other masterpieces) of Rodin’s Shadow, Small Shadow, and John the Baptist Preaching; Re- noir’s Large Bather; Henry Moore’s Woman on Steps and Standing Figure, and Mother and Child; Maillol’s Sum- mer, Venus, Standing Female Figure with Necklace, and Hommage A Debussy; Marcks’ Orion and Three Graces; and two remarkable mobiles, Rickey’s Five Lines in Parallel Planes and Calder’s Five Rudders. To the in- (1) 2 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN The Bicentennial Scultpure Exhibition was centered around the water lily pools. PHOTO COURTESY SHAW CAMERA SHOP stitutions and individuals who loaned and arranged the pieces, the Garden and the people of Saint Louis are eternally grateful for the privilege they had of this cultural inspiration throughout all of October 1965. Mr. Mark W. Paddock assumed the position as Administrative Assistant to Mr. Pad- dock came to the Garden with edu- Dr. Gates on September 1. cational and professional experience in botany, ecology, geography and wild- life management. For almost ten years he has had positions in the University of Colorado’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research involving research, administration and management. Prior to that he was game biologist with the Idaho Fish and Game Department. Al- though he has been in the Mountain West since entering the University of Colorado as an undergraduate, Mark is a native of the Midwest. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Darwin Mark- ley Paddock, still reside in the old family home at Clinton, Iowa, on the banks of the Mississippi River. The grounds have been especially well maintained this year. James Hampton the superintendent, and _ his crew, are to be commended for this. The old citrus and alcove greenhouses running west from the display house were repainted and new fibre glass roofs installed. The translucent green of the fibre glass gives them a cool, clean look which is refreshing. The southern half of this structure is to be used for permanent public plantings, and the northern half as an amateur MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 3 display house. Four new growing houses and a large head house are being constructed to replace the old struc- ture demolished earlier in the year. A parking lot was built behind the green- house for the use of those working on amateur displays and at other special events at the garden. Construction was begun during the autumn, of an office building for the Chief Engineer and Superintendent of Operations, Greenhouse Supervisor, Floriculturist, and other staff. This building is to be known as the Parks Building; its construction was made possible by a bequest from the James J. Park estate. It is our intention to maintain all parts of the Garden in absolutely first rate order. Towards this end the ex- terior of the Henry Shaw Town House containing the administrative offices and the herbarium-library building has been painted and_ reconditioned. Other structures will be similarly treated as the need arises. Since annual reports were not pre- pared for 1963 and 1964 it is impor- tant to mention some of the major physical improvements to the Garden during those years. Primarily through the generosity of Leicester B. Faust, the main entrance area of the Garden received a much needed face-lifting in the summer of 1964. New lily ponds, walk-ways and plantings were installed Aside from improving the appearance of this area, the new pools especially will save us scores of hours of maintenance by almost eliminating the need for con- stant weeding in the pools. Since 1963, a beautiful, large new rose gar- den has been developed a few hundred feet northwest of Tower Grove House. This rose garden, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. John S. achieved rapid distinction under the Lehmann, _ has conscientious attention of Mr. Alfred Saxdal, Rose Grower. The St. Louis Garden Club and the St. Louis Herb Society were responsible for the fine development of the fenced garden just to the rear of Tower Grove House. An “Old Fashioned Flower Garden” re- miniscent of a gentlemen’s garden in the days of Henry Shaw occupies the west half and a wonderfully fragrant herb garden occupies the other half of this area. LIBRARY a HE following is a report concern- ing the status and progress of the library in the words of its librar- ian, Dr. George B. Van Schaack. During 1965 the library continued to discharge its duties of acquisition, exchange, binding and_ circulation more or less normally. But in several respects the year was marked by an upswing in activity, accomplishment and recognition. Beginning the year with only two full-time permanent members, the staff was increased by fifty per cent in July when Dr. Frank Pershe entered upon his appointment as assistant librarian. Dr. Pershe, who in June was granted a degree in library science, has in addition much 4 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN formal training in forestry in Europe and wide forestry experience both there and in South America. The year’s budget for personnel was larger than ever before, and with the extra funds three other positions were filled temporarily on a full- or part-time basis, all relating to the curatorial activities discussed below. The library was used substantially more than in recent years, as the Gar- den’s program in writing the Flora of Panama was stepped up, as the publi- cation of the Garden’s scientific jour- nal, the Annals, returned to normal size and frequency, and as the re- searches of new staff members both at the Garden and at Washington University got under way. There was also a noticeable increase in its use by students from universities in neigh- boring states. Accomplishment in acquisition was substantial; in addition to the normal influx of hundreds of serial publica- tions which come by exchange or subscription there were purchases of many Russian periodicals to fill gaps in the more than two score titles we currently receive from the Soviet Union, of a full set of the Bulletin of the Alpine Garden Society, of several useful bibliographic tools, such as the Bibliotheca Walleriana, of facsimile re- prints of 19th century reference works as well as of older herbals not in the Garden’s large collection of originals, and of one original herbal of 1549. This last is an edition of Dioscorides of particular importance since it con- tains the only paper by Valerius Cor- dus published during his brief lifetime; he was one of the major founders of plant taxonomy as it developed in the 16th century. Finally, hundreds of other items were purchased — of smal- ler value but of much importance to the functions the library serves, chief- ly in systematic botany, plant geo- graphy and horticulture. Curatorial accomplishment included the oiling of all the leather bindings in the library — this took a half-time employee some eight months. A full- time temporary employee, during the same eight months, repaired scores of books. Dozens of other volumes were rebound by a Saturday employee who has worked for us for more than two years. Although funds were available for extensive regular binding, the total number of volumes so bound was only 352. Preparation of volumes for bind- ing is a more or less skilled operation — with its present size there is doubt- fully enough time for the staff to devote more effort to such prepara- tion. A most satisfying item on the score of accomplisment was the initiation of a program to repair the library’s very old rare volumes. Three of these, dating 1474, 1484 and 1542, were sent to the extra bindery of the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co. in Chicago where they were restored most expert- ly and excellently under the direction of Mr. Harold Tribolet. For this type of work it is not easy to find competent craftsmen, nor is it easy to pay the high prices which this repair entails. The three books re- stored this year all fall into the cate- gory of museum material; the volume from 1474, for example, is the second printed edition of an early 14th MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 5 century work on agriculture by an Italian lawyer and landholder, Piero de Crescenzi — both in its content and in its physical form it is rare, and, in the latter, a beautiful early example of printing. There are dozens of other books, just as precious, which need restoration, and hundreds of others of slightly less ‘status’ but of no_ less scientific importance which must be expertly repaired before they can be used. The program has started, but it can continue only if a special fund is maintained! HERBARIUM HE outstanding collection of dried plant specimens reached an accession number of 1,808,335 as of 31 August 1965. During the year ending 31 August, 13,335 accessions were added to the herbarium chiefly from North, Middle and South Ameri- ca, Africa and Russia. The dynamic leadership of the herbarium under its new Director, Dr. Walter H. Lewis, is strengthened by the addition to the staff of Dr. Derek Burch as Assistant Botanist. Dr. John D. Dwyer and Dr. André Robyns, Research Associates, continued to work on the Flora of Panama. Dr. Dwyer spent the sum- mer in Panama collecting. Dr. André Robyns prepared manuscripts on sev- eral families of the Flora of Panama, including the Hibiscus family, the Malvaceae, and did laborious checking of several manuscripts submitted by specialists on the subject. Dr. John Ridgway, newly appointed Assistant Professor of Botany at Washington University, was appointed Curator of Bryophytes and Dr. H. Wayne Nich- ols, Associate Professor of Botany, continues as Curator of Algae. Pub- lications by members of the herbar- ium staff totaled 23. The herbarium received a total of 123 registered visitors during the year from Australia, Canada, France, Swit- zerland and most of the United States. Many of these visitors spent from a few hours to several days studying plants contained within the herbarium. In addition, numerous high school and university student groups were shown the collections. FLORA OF PANAMA rR. Robert E. Woodson, late Cura- D tor of the Herbarium, began the preparation of a Flora of Panama about thirty years ago. Since his death in November, 1963, Dr. Cutler has been in charge of administering the National Science Foundation grant which supports most of this project. In past years about 70 different bot- anists have contributed the parts of the flora which have been published in the “Annals of the Missouri Botani- cal Garden’’. xf ~ 4 est en, OO 1 AS ae” a MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN The new Rose Garden, started in 1963, reached near perfection in 1965. PHOTO COURTESY SHAW CAMERA SHOP ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM 6 (is 12th Annual Systematics Sym- & posium, again supported by the National Science Foundation, was on the subject, ““The contribution of cyto- genetics to the determination of phy- logenies.”” The Symposium provides an opportunity for botanists and zoolo- gists to compare ideas on problems of scientific classification. For the past two years the number of participants TREE AND §S A BOTANICAL garden must have its collection of living plants pro- perly labeled. For many years the Men’s Garden Clubs of this region have worked with our staff to keep has been restricted, partly because meeting space is limited, but mainly because intensive interchange of ideas seems to proceed better in a limited group. About 180 biologists attended 15-16. Many of the participants came early the meetings last October or stayed on afterwards to consult the Garden’s collections and library and to exchange ideas with our staff. HRUB LABELING the trees and shrubs clearly and cor- rectly labeled. This year, again, Mr. Arthur Krueger organized a group which replaced or repaired several hundred of the labels on our plants MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 7, ANNALS HE following is a brief report concerning the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden in the words of its Editor, Dr. Walter H. Lewis. The highlight of the year was the publication of the Robert E. Woodson, Jr. Memorial Issue as Volume 52, Number 3. This issue contained 27 articles, plus prefatory remarks from the many students, friends and co- workers of the late Dr. Woodson. The Annals of the Missouri Botani- cal Garden is a scientific journal in the 52nd year of publication devoted primarily, though not exclusively, to the results of systematic studies of plants. In recent years the journal has published by and large only the sys- tematic results of higher plants and then largely in a restricted region, Panama. This year some progress has been made in expanding the scope to include research papers of more gen- eral systematic interest and in the future it is hoped that sufficient funds will allow us to include publication on cryptogamic systematics as well as other research fields. However, the journal should remain as a whole sys- tematic in nature. Designed as a journal to encompass the research contributions from the botany staff of Washington Univer- sity as well as the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Annals has been a non- review publication. This year an Edi- torial Committee was established so that all articles submitted to the Editor could be reviewed and _ this policy has been consistently followed throughout the year. Whenever the Editorial Committee felt incapable of adequately reviewing an article, the Editor requested reviews elsewhere. The Editorial Committee consists of the Editor and John D. Dwyer, H. Wayne Nichols, Andre Robyns, and George B. Van Schaack. RESEARCH CONCERNING USEFUL PLANTS R. Edgar Anderson, Curator of Useful Plants, continued work on several publications when his other obligations to the Garden permitted. Aside from being Editor of the Bulle- tin, and active in research, Dr. Ander- son is continually in demand as a highly accurate, voluminous and will- ing source of botanical and horticul- tural information. His active life in botanical gardens for over four de- cades has prepared him uniquely for this purpose and the Garden’s staff as well as outside amateurs and profes- sionals place a considerable burden on Dr. Anderson’s time with requests for information, In addition Dr. Ander- son gradually took it upon himself to acquaint St. Louis area citizens and its medical profession with the litera- ture on Poisonous Plants. The result was greatly increased interest in plant- poisoning dangers and how to deal with emergencies. Dr. Anderson him- self receives numerous calls from anxious parents and_ hospitals. A mimeographed concordance of all available literature was sent to hos- pitals, physicians and Garden Staff members likely to be called on plant- poisoning cases. 8 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN Dr. Hugh Cutler, Curator of Useful Plants, continued his research on the evolution of cultivated plants, aided by a grant from the National Science Foundation. Most of the work this year was concerned with the history of the gradual development of corn and of the many kinds of squashes and gourds. These plants are espe- cially suited for such studies because there are many related wild plants with which they hybridize and be- cause archaeologists are able to supply dated specimens which record the changes in the plants which have gone on for more than 8,000 years. During the past year about 50 lots of speci- mens from more than 200 prehistoric sites and from some modern Indian groups were studied and 26 reports sent out. An unusual series of wild squashes collected by an entomologist in Mexico was found to have crossed with cultivated forms. Most of the collections came from the Southwest and from the Mexican and South American highlands and dry areas where conditions permit the preserva- tion of archaeological materials and where most of the wild relatives of New World crop plants grow. A biology student, William Eickmeier, works as a part-time laboratory assis- tant, and sorts, measures and_ labels collections as they are received. A large amount of material has come from the salvage and study operations of archaeologist in the Mississippi Valley. This is being stu- died by Mr. Leonard Blake, an amatuer archaeologists who has been doing this work in his spare time for the past eight years. Since his retirement early this year, Mr. Blake spends two days a week working on our collections. A joint paper on this work was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology at the Uni- versity of Illinois in May. The Garden is one of the very few places which is actively engaged in the study of the history of useful plants. We have frequent visitors who study our collections or request aid in identification or interpretation of their own materials. Dr. Martin Cardenas, from the University of Cochabamba, Bolivia, spent a week at the Garden in August, studying collections of An- dean plants with Dr. Cutler. FLORAL DISPLAYS lie flower shows during 1965 were superb and Mr. Paul Kohl, Floriculturist, has prepared the follow- ing summary of the year’s activities. The annual orchid show opened with a preview for the Friends of the Garden on February 5 and continued through February 28. Camellias were in full bloom in the Linnaean House during February. Twenty-five new varieties added to the collection in 1964 bloomed for the first time. The tulip show was scheduled to open March 7 but the opening date was postponed until March 10. to coincide with the three-day Bicenten- nial Garden Symposium sponsored by the St. Louis Garden Club. MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 9 March 27 and 28 the Metropolitan St. Louis African Violet Society used the floral display house for its thir- teenth annual African Violet Show. April 2 Friends of the Garden were invited for a preview of the Spring Flower Show which undoubtedly is one of the most colorful shows of the year. The azaleas, cinerarias, gen- istas and marguerites dominated the show, but numerous other plants like browallias, calceolarias, felicias, nas- turtiums, snapdragons, stocks, daffo- dils, hycacinths and tulips enhanced the show. For Easter Sunday many lilies were added to the display. The Spring Show continued through April and in early May, Lady Washington pelargoniums were shown. On May 15 and 16 the St. Louis Horticultural Society held its spring flower show in the display house. This was followed by an exhibit of hydrangeas until June 20. The Rose Show, staged by the Rose Society of Greater St. Louis, had been scheduled for May 22-23 but the show was post- poned until May 29-30. Since the hydrangeas occupied the south section of the flower house the rose show was staged at the rear of the hydrangeas. During July and August, caladiums, begonias, fuchias and gloxinias oc- cupied the small formal garden in the flower house. A one-day gladiolus show, sponsored by the Southwestern Chapter of the II- linois Gladiolus Society, was held in the rear of the flower house on August 1. From September 4 through Septem- ber 12 the Henry Shaw Cactus Society staged a cactus and succulent show. September 25-26-27 the Greater St. Louis Dahlia Society held its show and this was as usual a large and colorful display. October 22-23 the Allied Florists exhibited their various bou- quet and table decorations. A preview for the Friends of the Garden opened the annual Chrysan- themum Show on November 5. This show continued through November and then on December 3 another pre- view for the Friends opened the Poin- settia Display. Poinsettias in pink, red and white dominated the show, but Christmas cherries and peppers, white chrysanthemums, —kalenchoes and rosemary plants added variety. The beds in the main plaza, Henry Shaw’s garden at the rear of the resi- dence and the Linnaean garden were planted and maintained throughout the summer. The bedding plants in the main garden were removed after the close of the Sculpture Exhibit on October 31. The beds were then re- shaped and planted with five thou- sand tulip bulbs. When the old greenhouse range was closed in early May for demolition all plants had to be moved to temporary quarters in the frames and the lean-to greenhouse. Fans and pads were in- stalled at the ends of the house to effect some cooling and in it all of the chrysanthemums and poinsettias were started, The chrysanthemum hang- ing-baskets and cascades were also grown here. New growing houses are being erected, but these will not be available until sometime next year. In the interval temporary facilities in the tropical greenhouses are being used but for lack of cool temperature green- houses in which to grow the plants this may be a lean year for the spring flower show. 10 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN CLIMATRON, EXOTIC RANGES AND AQUATICS HE following report by Ladislas Cutak, Superintendent of Green- houses concerns the status and pro- gress of the Climatron, Exotic Ranges and Aquatics during the year 1965. The phenomenal growth of plants in the Climatron remains a source of wonderment to the visitor as well as the employee. This unique structure, though only five years in operation, has achieved maturity in record time. It is amazing how rapidly plants grow when constant warmth, adequate moisture, abundance of light and movement of air, play a contributing part. Throughout the year, heavy to light pruning is carried on. This often becomes a major job for days, parti- cularly when the larger trees are in- volved. The average visitor probably does not realize how many species of plants are being grown, and although some die or are removed for various reasons, there are always at least one thousand different kinds on display. New plants are added as they become large enough to transplant. We are search- ing constantly for plants of ornament- al value, plants that are of economic interest, or that play an important role in the lives and legends of primitive as well as civilized peoples. The Clima- tron is really a ‘library’ of important living plants. In July the Superintendent of the Greenhouses, through the kindness of a Board member, made a trip to Hawai for the express purpose of viewing and studying plants as grown and used in tropical gardens and also to observe how some greenhouse exo- tics can become naturalized in the ideal Hawaiian climate to the point of becoming weeds. Four of the major islands were visited: Oahu, Kauai, Maui and Hawaii. Seeds and plants were collected, some already growing and others to be shipped from time to time to enhance our collections. The Honolulu Botanic Gardens are playing an important role in this project, but there are also several individuals taking active part. The jungle lake in the Climatron with the unique Aquatunnel has con- tinued to be a problem even after trying various methods to hold down the growth of algae, mostly on the Plexiglass cover. In December, the major task of removing 70 tons of sand from the pool was undertaken and the pool cleaned. It is hoped that a method will be found to keep the pool free of algae, because this aqua- tunnel is one of the Climatron’s most interesting features. The two Desert Houses flanking the Climatron received heavy pruning in early January. Many of the succulents like cacti and spurges (euphorbias) reached the glass roof, so with the help of the outside crew this project was acomplished during days of incle- ment weather. New labels were at- tached to most of the plants. In the South African Desert House a display of “Brilliant Star’ Kalanchoes was a feature for several weeks in the Spring. The brilliant scarlet-red starlike blos- soms added color to the scene. The desert is not always a drab place — MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 11 in flower it becomes a glorious sight. The orchid collection under the able management of Mrs. Marion Pfeiffer continues to thrive. Some new hy- brids were obtained in exchange and an attempt has been made to maintain flowering plants all year round, parti- cularly for the annual Orchid Show in February, the displays in the Clima- tron, for the decoration of the Henry Shaw House and the two bouquets furnished the Veiled Prophet Queen in the Fall, and also to take care of emergency decorations at Garden functions. The water lilies are a great summer attraction in the Garden. In order to assure a good display of flowers, tubers must be planted in heated tanks in- doors about January. As they pro- gress, the plantlets are shifted into larger pots and finally set out in boxes BUILDING, GROUNDS M R. James Hampton, a member of the Garden’s staff for twenty years, was appointed Superintendent of Operations and Chief Engineer in January 1965. Under his conscien- tious, tireless supervision, the mainte- nance, engineering and grounds opera- tions of the Garden have achieved great progress in 1965. The fine appearance of the grounds this year has been mentioned previously, and in the outdoor pools to develop into magnificent specimens. The outdoor boxes were made ready to receive pre- pared soil on April 13 and then water was put into the pools ten days later. The actual planting of water lilies was begun on May 4th and within a month the growth response was amazing, which precluded a fine display for the summer. The hybrid Amazon Water Platters outdid themselves again this year and because the year was excep- tionally mild, large leaves remained into October. The other Nymphaeas continued to blossom well into No- vember, but finally the last of them were removed and the pools drained on November 22nd. The propagation of the water lilies was entrusted to the care of Mr. Charles Kreher and he did a magnificent job. AND OPERATIONS it is not necessary to go into detail of the year-around effort by an under- maned staff which brought the gen- eral outdoor appearance of the Garden to its best level in several decades. Reconditioning and extensive main- tenance of facilities in an organization of this size and nature is always a large job. However, the task is compound- ed when the buildings are so very old and the equipment often outdated. 12 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS @) NE of the most important services provided by the Garden for the Saint Louis region is the educational programs for children and adults in botany, horticulture, and nature. Mr. Kenneth Peck, Instructor, is respon- sible for these programs and reports on educational activities. lies following statistical breakdown reflects the number of visits made by people attending all phases of education programs at the Garden in 1965, Saturday Morning Program for Children 2,519 Plant Science Program for Grade School Children 2,889 Tours of Climatron and Grounds by Garden Staff 2,731 Tours of Climatron and Grounds by Volunteers 2,651 Pitzman Nature Program for Children 4,770 Adult Horticulture Courses 528 Total visits to education programs 16,088 The Saturday Morning Program is beginning its 8th year, having started in December, 1958. The Plant Science Program began modestly in 1959 and has grown steadily from a few hun- dred children to several thousand an- nually. This program is a service to the elementary schools in the St. Louis area. Teachers and their classes visit the Garden for lessons in botany. Tours of the Climatron and grounds are given by Garden staff and volunteers. The following volunteers relieved staff for other duties and did a fine job of acquainting groups with the Garden: Mrs. Paul Britt, Mrs. Cecil Criger, Mrs. J. A. Deeble, Mrs. Virginia Hay, Mrs. Emily Horner, Mrs. H. D. Kip- ling, Mrs. Jos. Lembeck, Mrs. George Pring, Mrs. G. J. Samuelson and Mrs. I. G. Tremain; Messrs. W. C. Berke- meyer, Phil Conrath, Dan O’Gorman, Gil Pennewill and Clifford Rhoads. A new course for adults in grafting and budding was given in February. This was a one-session course taught by James I. McCaskill. The other courses which have been offered reg- ularly in the past, were given by Clarence Barbre, Raymond Freeborg, Robert Gillespie and Kenneth Peck. With educational services expanding the way they have recently, the Gar- den urgently needs new or vastly improved educational facilities. An educational complex containing class- rooms, lecture hall, displays, offices and washrooms is another ‘“‘must” to consider in the near future. PITZMAN NATURE PROGRAM — 1965 I SHE past summer was the eighth year for the Pitzman Nature Program for children. It was a busy and successful summer even though MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 13 The lure of making their own Christmas wreaths drew over 350 children to the Garden’s Saturday morning program last December. Twelve volunteers assisted Ken Peck in the elbow to elbow exercise held in the Experimental Greenhouse. no attendance records were established. Rain was the biggest problem this year as it fell on ten of the forty attend- ance days. Those acquainted with classroom and = auditorium facilities will appreciate the difficulties in get- ting 130 to 200 children indoors and keeping order. Approximately 80‘, of the more than 600 youngsters who attended over the summer were eligi- ble for the certificates given those children who completed the program faithfully. The classes were taught by an en- thusiastic group of high school and college young people. Jean and Fred Bardenheier and Veronica Friel, all students at St. Louis University were PHOTO BY MARK PADDOCK with us again. Alan Meyers, a student at Princeton University, taught for the first time along with Ann Wynne, a senior at Nerinx Hall in Webster Groves. Robert Crandall, Kevin Friel, and Bill Eickmeier (who has been with the program for three years) served as assistants. In cooperation with Mr. Earl Hath, President of the St. Louis Audubon Society, it was possible to give another full summer of bird study. Those responsible for organizing study ma- terials and giving the classes on birds were Mrs. Cecil R. Criger and Miss Sarah Owen, both of whom have been extremely faithful this year as in past seasons. Assisting them in teach- 14 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN ing were Misses Saundra Dexter and Carolyn Reynolds, Mrs. R. K. Kirk- patrick, Mrs. Catherine Arhos, Robert Guenther, Ray Schlund, and Steve Hanselmann, Something that is difficult to ap- preciate about a program like this is that, while it appears to be the same on the surface each year, many changes are made in the course ma- terial presented from year to year. One of the new activities this summer was an exercise in mapping. Authentic map symbols were used and the chil- dren mapped an area around a lake, locating a dozen or more trees and indicating their positions on the map. A new talk on wilderness survival proved to be of interest even though it suggested that good wilderness foods include grubs, dragonflies, and por- cupine livers. Cultures of some of the larger, swimming colonial forms of algae were obtained for observation under the microscope. This sparked a considerable amount of interest, par- ticularly among the younger children. The response to this program over an eight year period has been rewarding. Some of the young people who have been students (and some of them in- structors or assistants) are already in colleges and universities preparing for careers in science. We are, indeed, grateful to Mrs. Pauline Pitzman Eades for considera- tion in making funds from the Pitz- man Charitable Trust available for this program. ARBORETUM Vite a staff of only one full- time assistant plus a part-time laborer, Mr. Frank Steinberg did an admirable job keeping the 1600 acre Arboretum at Gray Summit in good condition. Mowing of the grounds and lawns is the largest single job at the Arboretum, but pruning, spraying, clearing, cutting and rou- tine maintenance of the roads and buildings fill in most of the remaining hours spent by the Arboretum staff. Prinicipal improvements in 1965 in- clude new roofs for the pump room and storage shed, 100 tons of crushed rock for the roads and redecoration of the greenhouse residence which was rented starting in August. The Arboretum is open to the pub- lic every day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and autos are permitted to drive around the Pinetum Lake throughout the year. Roads beyond that point are open to the public for cars in April and May when the dogwoods, redbuds, and daffodils are in bloom. Of course, walking is permitted on the entire grounds at any time the Arboretum is open and the trails through the wild- flower filled “glades” and adjacent woodlands are especially interesting. MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 15 aes Grove House, the coun- try home of Henry Shaw, contin- ued as a popular attraction in 1965. Approximately 30,000 persons visited the historic home. A project of the Historical Committee of the Women’s Executive Board, Tower Grove House has received increasing recognition and publicity in the past few years as the citizens of St. Louis became more in- terested in the history of their city during the Bicentennial celebration Miss Nell Rives manages the house with the assistance of one paid hostess each day. These hostesses are assisted in turn by two or more volunteer hos- tess-guides who donate their time. A total of 53 volunteers participated on a regularly scheduled basis in 1965. On December 4 the Historical Com- mittee entertained at a tea honoring the volunteers who gave of their time in 1965. The Veiled Prophet’s Queen of Love and Beauty gave a reception for the school children of Greater St. Louis in the Tower Grove House on October 9. Another special attraction is the annual decoration of the house for the Christmas season. This delightful proj- ect is carried on by different commit- tees each year and over 1000 visitors come to see the beautiful Victorian style Christmas decorations. At the rear of the house are three special, small gardens that have direct relation to Tower Grove House. Two of them, the Herb Garden and the Old Fashioned Flower Garden (see above) have been discussed previously. The Cutting Garden was used for the first time in 1965, after being developed by the Midwest Regional Council of Men’s Garden Clubs for the use of Tower Grove House. Twice each week fresh flowers from this cutting garden are made into appropriate ar- rangements by members of a special committee of volu nteers. 16 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN FRIENDS OF THE GARDEN i Flac year of 1965 was a very suc- cessful one for the Friends of the Garden. Under the able direction of Mrs. Lee I. Niedringhaus, president until May, and Mrs. Edward L. Bake- well, Jr., the current president, the Friends achieved new heights. The year opened ambitiously with the “My Fair Lady’ Premiére. A large, enthusiastic crowd participated in this special project resulting in a substantial $25,000 contribution to the Missouri Botanical Garden. The friends enjoyed four delightful flower show preview parties during the year and had a special treat on September 30 when a Preview Party accompanied the Bicentennial Sculpture Show open- ing and the grand opening of the new Garden Gate Shop. Mrs. Leslie J. Gleason became exe- cutive secretary in October, replacing Sally D. Carr, now Mrs. Edwin Cox, II. We at the Garden appreciate tre- mendously the memberships in the Friends that have been maintained during the year and welcome all new members. The income from these memberships is extremely important to the operation of the Garden. An important activity of the Friends is the operation of the Garden Gate Shop for the benefit of the Gar- den. It was opened in early summer in the south wing of the main gate and replaces two previous shops: a gift shop in the Tower Grove House and a smaller shop in the present location. Operations of the Garden Gate Shop are under the direction of the presi- dent of the Friends and the co-chair- men for the shop, Mrs. John Hayward and Mrs. John Wallace. Mrs. Edwin F. Stuessie is the shop manager. The sales force is comprised of volunteers who spend from one day a month to one day a week of their time helping at the shop. The Garden Gate Shop has proven to be very popular with visitors to the Garden in its first months of oper- ation. With its bright pleasing ap- pearance, friendly efficient staff and high quality selection it no doubt will continue to attract many through its doors. care to.

Edgar Anderson was editor D and principal contributor to the Bulletin of the Missouri Botanical Garden in 1965. Dr. ability to make botany interesting and Anderson’s give even the lowest weed a sparkling personality is unsurpassed; we are for- tunate that he was able to assume the editorship of the Bulletin in 1963. Dr. Anderson’s report for 1965 follows: As for many years there have been ten issues of the Bulletin, appearing the first part of every month except July and August. There has been a total of 156 pages, thus averaging nearly 16 per number. Eleanor Mc- Clure contributed timely horticultural advice for five of the issues, a feature which was widely enjoyed in this area. Mr. Edgar Denison of Kirkwood wrote (and illustrated) a detailed article on how to analyze the comparative values of various fertilizers on the St. Louis market. He demonstrated that there was little correlation between the price charged for the fertilizer and its value in terms of available nitrogen, phos- phate, and potash. It was much ap- preciated by many of the best amateur gardeners in St. Louis, and its sale was actively promoted by members of the Men’s Gardening Clubs in the metro- politan area. The September number introduced a St. Louis historian, Dr. William M. Shankland, to those concerned with the history of Mr. Shaw and his Gar- den, and he has contributed further interesting details about forgotten or little known phases of the Garden’s history which will be published the coming year. An article “On the Bad Habits of Certain Shade Trees” was appreciated by a number of street tree experts and kas been republished in trade and botanical periodicals on both the east and west coast. It dealt with the bad features of several much planted or- namental trees, which if better under- stood would have more appropriate use in parks, private gardens, and along streets and avenues. The Bulletin is mailed to Friends of the Garden, it is sent in exchange for various horticultural and botanical publications, and it is subscribed to by various individuals and libraries at $3.50 per year. As of December first the number of each of these were as follows: Friends of the Garden — 3100; Exchanges and Subscriptions — 360. Davip M. Gates THE LITTLE TREE There was a little tree That people like to see. When people went by The tree went up high; But when the people go, The tree goes down low. Now the tree is sad, People come to see him, — He is glad. — Heather Gates 8 years 18 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN WEEDS, BOTANISTS, AND CHEMISTS TALKED the other day with a pro- fessor of botany who spends a small part of his spare time as a consultant for a firm of chemical manufacturers. Since he has done part of his work in the tropics I thought perhaps they were using him in connection with an extensive or intensive search for an- cient herb remedies that might lead to modern drugs. Such work is indeed going forward in this particular com- pany but they have hired my friend for a far simpler purpose; he is teach- ing them about weeds, what kinds there are, how they are classified, what their common and scientific names are, how to learn to know them accurately. All this is connected with the com- pany’s business in weed-killers. Several different efforts are afoot. He is help- ing to set up, on college campuses, short, intensive training courses for young salesmen. He does a little lec- turing and some conferring. The com- plicated technical control of weeds with modern weed sprays has made it necessary for more key personnel to be accurately informed about weeds than when they were kept down with hoes and cultivators. There are hundreds of kinds of weed sprays on the market and hundreds of kinds of weeds in fields and gardens. Few weeds behave precisely the same to any one spray; some of them react very differently. Even a junior sales- man now profits from technical infor- mation about the naming and classifi- cation of weeds. When the botany professor first began to describe his ef- forts for the firm I wondered if their main purpose might not be to have someone like him lined up on their side during the country’s bitter disputes about pesticides and herbicides. How- ever, as he went into further detail I realized how perfectly he was filling their very genuine need for a teacher and student of weeds. All this has led me to reflect a little on the attitudes of human beings to- wards the weeds they try to kill. A strange, deep connection between kill- ing and loving has been commented on by more than one student of human behavior. Lion hunters, duck hunters, trout fishermen, frequently develop a deep-seated fellow feeling, almost a passionate love, for the animals they pursue. When weeds were controlled by aggressive hand-hoeing, a good many able American farmers took a personal interest in the weeds on their farms. If they met a botanist who could tell them their names and some- thing of their histories they would quiz him at length about points of no conceivable practicality. They would be delighted, for instance, to learn that pineapple-weed (Mactricaria matra- carioides), crushed in the fingers, smells like ripe pineapple and is really quite a different plant from the rank- smelling dog-fennel (Anthemis cotula) it frequently grows with in American farmyards. (To casual inspection a pineapple-weed looks like a smaller, somewhat aborted plant, of dog- fennel). Can it be that among those who most earnestly develop herbicides a growing interest in weeds for their MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 19 own sake is already developing emo- tional overtones? It has seemed to me for some time that herbicides might lead biologists to a deeper appreciation of the tangled relationships between plants and ani- mals which are closely associated with each other. Had we only suspected what was going to happen when Washington University sprayed __ its dandelions someone might have re- corded the results with scientific pre- cision. For years the University had not had bad lawns, as lawns go in St. Louis, but every spring there had been a magnificent display of dande- lions. All children, and a good many adults who were young at heart, had rejoiced in them, and the students chose each year a “Dandelion Queen.” The remnant seed stalks, however, tended to look pretty messy at Com- mencement time. As soon as herbicides came on the market, the lawns were intensively sprayed. The dandelions almost dis- appeared but the grass, in parts of the campus, was more inferior as turf. Be- tween the Quadrangle and the Chapel there were more little bare spots than in former years and there was a con- spicuous increase in chickweed. This had not been one of the areas where the dandelions made a really beautiful display. It had been largely a mixture of thin grass and struggling dandelions but there had never been enough chickweed to notice. Now it was con- spicuous and became unsightly as it slowly died off with the approach of really hot weather. The dandelions apparently had been helping to keep it in check and now most of them were eliminated. For several years the chick- weed continued to be a matter for general comment but no one thought of electing a chickweed queen. Then new construction in this part of the campus brought graver problems for the turf. Chickweed continues but the struggle for existence in the lawn has entered a new phase. From the in- creasing number of inquiries the Gar- den receives each spring about control- ling chickweed in the St. Louis area, one might suspect this is a general problem. EpGAR ANDERSON IN MEMORIAM — MARGUERITE URBAN KRUEGER QO' ALL the volunteers who have served the Garden in so many ways none helped us more and bothered us less (asking nothing in return) than Mrs. Arthur J. Krueger. Behind her considerate friendliness was a brilliant college-trained mind and a vast common sense. Those who worked the closest with her appreciated her quiet way of relieving tensions with a few dryly humorous phrases when groups of various kinds worked together on a complicated project. Some of us on the Garden staff delighted in the way she, to the very end of her life, kept a sharp eye out for plants which were new to her, whether they were garden flowers, forest trees, weeds, or wild flowers. She died peacefully in her sleep, after a few days of illness, on January 9. 20 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN PROGRAM OF SATURDAY ACTIVITIES FOR 1966 JANUARY 1 Holiday.

Miussourt Botanical Garden Vole Livy to, 2 Bulletin February 1966 THE OPEN SPACE GOUNCIL TOR IEE ST. LOUIS REGION =\" WwW\" unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room”—no room for gardens, for trees, birds, flowers, and parks—for wandering and wondering. When Isaiah bewailed congestion, most people lived on the land. Today more and more of us are crowding into urban areas which obliterate the nat- ural landscape as they sprawl over the countryside. Land is destroyed, air and water polluted, natural beauty rav- ished. Man lives in inhuman urban ghettos, tense and nervous or bored and indifferent, ever farther from open land and the solace of nature. And what of our own home? Cra- dled in the Ozarks and washed by great rivers, St. Louis, the gateway to the west, is gateway to a frontier that is no more. But we are fortunate. Along the rivers and in our rough hills we do have left to us some bits and pieces of wild land, land which can soothe and heal, instruct and inspire. If we do not seize these green islands at once, they will vanish under the bulldozer, and our children will joggle in metal boxes for hours to reach their like. Recognizing that a pleasant natural environment within an hour’s drive of the central city is being rapidly and irretrievably lost, the Open Space Council for the St. Louis Region has been formed to initiate and support efforts to: Set aside sufficient lands and waters for parks, forest preserves, and rec- reation purposes; Control destructive urban develop- ment of open country unsuitable for such development; Protect our natural resources from pollution; and Support appropriate zoning, and land management that recognizes recrea- tional values. The Open Space Council has already identified a number of areas in the St. Louis region which should be pre- served in their natural state, and others, like the lower Meramec, which should be developed for intensive rec- reational use. We are working toward their protection and acquisition. Believing each Friend of the Gar- den to be a friend of ours, we would welcome your support and _participa- tion in our program. Regular mem- bership is $10, supporting $25. In- (1) quiries should go to Membership Vice- Chairman Mrs. Jay G.

MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 3 THE GOLDEN LARCH, PSEUDOLARIX AMABILIS ORTICULTURALLY, the golden larch, though known to com- paritively few of our gardeners, is one of the peculiar treasures of the St. Louis area. Ever since it was discov- ered in China in 1853, discriminating collectors have been trying to get hold of likely young specimens for their collections. In a Kirkwood garden there are four old trees which have been seeding themselves in the neighborhood for several decades. As these seedlings have become increasingly known and cherished, they have been spread to other gardens, including the Missouri Botanical Garden. The group of them increases not only garden beauty in our whole community but can furnish a back-log of information about a spe- cies which in the Occident is still too little known and too incompletely un- derstood. Rehder, for instance, follow- ing English authorities, includes in his technical description of the golden ‘it. dislikes € larch the flat statement, limestone soil.” The Kirkwood trees are growing and seeding themselves above limestone on a hillside where the soil is not deep. There are evidently points still to be worked out about the golden larch’s tolerance of lime. The golden larch is not just another larch, though like that tree it is excep tional among cone-bearers in shedding its leaves in the autumn and going through the winter with bare branches. It is in a genus by itself. Though it is known as a fossil there are no other living species. Its needles are much larger than those of a true larch. They oS / are 2 inches long, up to an eighth of an inch wide and so flat that it seems inappropriate to call them “needles” and one reverts to saying “leaves,” which would of course be perfectly correct. The size, number, and ar- rangement of the leaves give the branches a feathery appearance. Trees up to twenty-five years old or so have more the habit of a cedar of Lebanon than of a larch, particularly when seen from a hundred feet away. The differences are not just superficial; the more one digs into technicalities the more unique is the golden larch. The stamens are borne on_ special little leafless spurs, the cones come to pieces when they are ripe just as do those of the true firs, and the pollen when seen under the microscope has wings at either end, not like that of larches but of the pines. The cones are larger than those of the true larches. They can be up to three inches long and two inches wide. In midsummer before they ripen and turn brown they are a clear cela- don green and with their reflexed scales have the look of little roses made out of smooth green leather. The foliage of the golden larch, when conditions are just right, can develop so regularly, and so much in one plane, even over a large portion of a branch, that it gives the appearance of pattern weaving or of tapestry. The basic elements in the design are the short shoots and the long shoots. The latter form the framework of the branches; the former produce the spurs, slender branchlets set at fairly 4 MISSOURI BOT'ANICAI regular intervals all along the branch- es. Each spur is terminated by the short shoot of the current year. Dur- ing the growing season this will be a flattish rosette, three or four inches across, of around thirty leaves arching gracefully towards the neighboring rosettes. For year after year the spurs bear nothing but short shoots. Each year’s growth adds one little rounded dark bump to the spur. These little branches do not increase in diameter perceptibly. When examined closely they look like tiny dark wooden beads, jammed closely together on a gently curving wire. Even after ten or twen- ty years, however, they maintain their separate identities; one can count the “beads” and learn just how many years that particular spur has been growing. By contrast with the short shoots on the spurs, the long shoots which are laying down the main framework of the trunk and branches are a little sloppy looking seen close at hand. Farther away they become a feathery green plume and add to the decorative aspect of the tree. In late spring they are vigorous green shoots with a scat- tered irregular spiral of arching flat green needles at the base, passing into a more clustered zone at the still- elongating tip. By late summer the twig has become a light red-brown. It already looks woody but has a waxy, sometimes almost violet overcast. The needles become closer together towards the apex and there is a final circle of them close together just below the terminal bud. They stand out away from the twig and at different angles. With a little patience one can make out that there is more regularity in . GARDEN BULLETIN their attitudes than there seems to be. Those which arise from the underside of the twig point forwards; those from above tend to arch upwards and outwards. All along the twig at the base of some of the needles are the scaly little buds which will open out next spring into short shoots or, much more rarely, a long shoot about to start a side branch. The golden larch was discovered in south-eastern China in 1853 by the great English plant explorer, Robert Fortune. He was out in China for some years as the representative of the Royal Horticultural Society, collecting seeds, bulbs, potting up seedlings, root- ing cuttings (as for instance the first Forsythias to arrive in Europe). All these were sent back through the mails or in sealed, glass-sided Wardian cases, lashed to the masts of sailing ships, up out of the reach of damaging. salt spray. He found the golden larch growing wild in Chekiang and Kiangsu, signifi- cantly in that part of China for which Dr. Li has recently presented convinc- ing evidence as the original home of the Ginkgo. He had already met the golden larch in cultivation being grown as a bonzai in a large pot and trained to look like an ancient Cedar of Lebanon. Robert Fortune made extraordinary efforts to introduce the golden larch into Europe. After he got back to England he published a detailed sum- mary of his Chinese introductions on February 25, 1860, in The Gardener’s Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette (as this distinguished old journal was known in those days). He warned his MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 5 A two year old twig bearing 15 A long shoot at the end of the short shoots. first season. See pages 3-4. PHOTO, COURTESY SHAW CAMERA SHOP 6 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN readers that the golden larch would be difhcult to get: “It will be very rare in Europe for many years to come, owing to the difficulty of getting seeds to germinate after the long voyage. Knowing the importance of a tree of this kind, and that it was almost im- possible to propagate it in this coun- try, | used every means in my power to introduce its seeds in large quanti- ties and in good condition. They were sent by the overland mail—some in letters through the Post Office, and others in small packages—for several years in succession, and were often sown in England in less than two months from the time they were gath- ered from the trees in China. Out of all sent home only one despatch [sic] vegetated freely, all the others were complete failures. All the plants of any size now in England were dug up in the woods of China and sent home in Wardian cases.” Though good plants of it reached England it has never done so well there as in the eastern United States and in northern Italy. The English summers are apparently too cool for its best de- velopment. There was for some years a remarkable tree at Pallanza, a small resort town on Lago Maggiore in north Italy. It was situated on a small tongue of land running out into the lake, the warmest and most sheltered spot in the vicinity. The first tree in the United States was brought over to the Parson’s nurs- ery in Flushing, Long Island (now a part of Greater New York). It was imported in 1859, apparently from a sale of Fortune introductions, as a small tree three feet high. When seen by Professor Sargent in 1895 it was still surviving near the famous Weep- ing Beech. The latter (for some dec- ades at least) survived in a small park all its own, so presumably this golden larch disappeared early in the twen- tieth century. An outstanding American specimen of golden larch also fruited and seeded on the shores of a small lake. The Hunnewell family of Wellesley, Massa- chusetts, maintained a choice arbore- tum at their estate on Lake Waban, It bore fertile cones in 1893 and seedlings which came up near the tree were the source of specimens in other American collections. A tree at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston fruited for some years but the seeds were sterile or practically so. About 1932, noticing that a smaller tree nearby had reached fruiting age, I persuaded the late Mr. William Judd, a very skillful propagator, to make an- other trial. It seemed that if inbreed- ing had anything to do with the steril- ity, there was now an opportunity for cross pollination. To our delight the seeds germinated so well that they looked like a coating of ground pine in the propagating flats. A fine lot of young seedlings were raised from them and were widely distributed. Since that time the Arnold Arbore- tum trees have continued to have fruitful years, though for a time the dust from nearby quarries was hinder- ing the trees. In response to.a request for information about their seed and its fertility, Mr. Alfred J. Fordham, the Propagator of the Arnold Arbore- tum recently wrote me as follows: MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 7 “| have been observing the fruiting habits of Pseudolarix amabilis quite carefully each year for the past six years and have noticed that on alter- nate years we have had heavy crops of viable seeds. However, this year is the off year but a few cones have been produced on one tree; they are quite scattered and are not producing in the usual manner with great numbers on certain branches. We also have ger- minated this a number of times in re- cent years with very good success. | have not worked with counted num- bers but do know that the percentage is very high. Our best success with this subject has been to provide it with two months of cold stratification after which a general germination occurs very quickly. “Another point is that the few scat- tered cones that have been produced this year are almost devoid of viable seeds. I checked three cones yesterday and found only three sound seeds. Our specimens of ‘Golden Larch’ at the Arboretum are now in superb con- dition. The dust from the quarries is no longer a problem as they no longer exist. I assume there has been an op- portunity for cross pollination here at the Arboretum but have not checked this carefully. I have noticed the conelets at pollen time, both male and female, but have not checked to see whether or not the same condition prevailed on all trees.” One of the reasons the golden larch is not better known in the United States is because for several decades it has been at least somewhat confused in the trade with the much commoner and much more ordinary Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis). Wt was nat- ural that this confusion should have come about. The Japanese larch was once commonly known as Larix kaem pferi, the golden larch as Pseudo- larix kaempferi as well as Larix ama- bilis. When I was on the staff of the Arnold Arboretum [ visited two or three collections of fine trees in which were proudly exhibited specimens of a “golden larch” that turned out to be A few years later in one of the best nurseries merely the Japanese Larch. in the United States I was shown a whole row of young Japanese Larches € which were being sent out as “golden larches.””, Quite recently Mr. Clarence Barbre of Webster Groves bought seeds of golden larch from a reliable firm which proved to be a species of Larix when they came up. I have no Lower branches of a golden larch with a hand to show the scale. Twigs near the hand are bearing only short shoots. Below the hand four long shoots branch out near the base of the figure. PHOTO, BRIAN GORDON. 8 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN means of knowing how general this confusion may be. The Kirkwood colony of golden larches apparently traces back about fifty years by the size of the four oldest trees. They are all on land which was part of the old John Curlee estate on Sappington Road in Kirk- wood, Missouri. As I found out more and more about these trees I became increasingly puzzled as to how several rare trees could have made their way out to Sappington Road in the early nineteen hundreds. In those days few Americans knew about Pseudolarix, but a number of eastern aristocrats were pulling wires to get hold of healthy seedlings for their collections; I have never heard of anyone who se- cured a whole group of them. The John Curlees, I was told, had all died or moved away but through an old friend of the family I was put in touch with a daughter of John Curlee who is married and living in Greater St. Louis. She remembered the trees at once and said they were already on the place when her family moved there when she was a young girl. She im- mediately had a good suggestion as to how they probably got there. John Curlee acquired the estate from John Blair, who in addition to some fine native oaks had planted such unusual trees as the Bald Cypress and taken good care of them. Mrs. James Blair had been most successful as the official hostess for the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. When the Fair was finally over and the exhibits were dispersed, she was given many choice things by the friends she had made among the exhibitors. The golden larches might well have been acquired by the Blairs in this way. To me this seems almost certain. In 1904, before the days of Horticul- tural Quarantines, foreign nurserymen came over bag and baggage for the Fair and brought in quantities of exotic material. We know that tubbed specimens of young golden larches had been available in China before that time. Well cared-for young specimens of golden larch would be just the thing for part of an oriental garden or background for an oriental restaurant. What could have been more likely? So far as I can see they might well have been brought over either from Japan or from China. Today the four largest (and appar- ently oldest) trees are growing towards the top of the gentle, undulating north slope on which the various seedlings are to be found. This immediate area is no longer a very desirable site for choice conifers, though the four old golden larches are standing it remark- ably well. Immediately to the north of them “Sappington Spur,” an en- trance drive to part of the old Curlee property, has been cut into the side hill just below the trees; it must cer- tainly have affected their water sup- ply. Immediately on their southern flank is the private entrance to what was once the Curlee home, a large, dignified, squarish mansion. Bordering them on the east is a small garage. Between it and the boundary fence along Sappington Spur (almost imme- diately under the northernmost tree, though well screened from public view) is a pile of brick and other rubble. MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN a3 The Blair trees from which the Sappington Golden Larches originated. Ppins 4 The four trees vary in diameter at breast height from about fifteen to twenty inches. It is apparently the northernmost of these trees which has been the most prolific source of seed. In the best seed year seedlings came up thickly among the bricks and rubble, where they were nicely shaded. Two years ago, in spite of an early summer drought, one young seedling was still to be found there in early September. Several hundred feet down the slope, between Sappington Road and the first house on the Spur, is the next largest 10 MISSOURI BOTANICAL of the trees. It is smaller in diameter and less mature in form than those at the top of the slope, though apparently growing in a more advantageous situ- tion. It has fruited at least once and might be either the oldest of the seed- lings or one of the original trees set out by the Blairs. Everything consid- ered it is more probably a seedling; golden larches, given good growing conditions, can increase in height very rapidly. News of these interesting trees be- gan to spread in horticultural circles in St. Louis in 1945 when the James McClure family moved into their home on Sappington Spur. Mrs. McClure wore a small specimen to the Garden as a corsage. It was identified and the trees were then appreciated for their rarity as well as their beauty. The McClures, and other families in the neighborhood, have treasured the seed- lings and protected them from rabbits. There are now about twenty to thirty trees of various sizes on the hillside; some of them have come up as far as three hundred yards down the hill. Quite a number of young trees have been passed on to other gardens in the St. Louis area. Gradually quite a fund of knowledge about them has been ac- cumulated. Apparently one of the difficulties of growing these trees in the Occident has been that aside from Fortune’s original transplants, we have been dealing with an inbred group. The Sappington golden larches have evidently been cross-pollinated. They have naturalized themselves vigorously for an exotic conifer in Missouri. They have apparently fruited a little every year, though more heavily some years GARDEN BULLETIN than others and very heavily indeed in one year (about 1946). It has long been known that the seedlings require shade; Fortune wrote pungently about how nof to treat them a century ago: “Nothing can be worse for small plants of this kind, in small pots, to be alternately baked in the sun and de- luged with water.” The Sappington golden larches in addition to cross- bred vigor have had adequate shade. The gentle north slope and the protec- tion of other trees must have been helpful, particularly in drought years when hot dry winds out of the South- west can blow for a week at a time. In September of 1963, after quite se- vere drought, particularly in the early summer, it was evident that shade, even after the seedling stage was passed, had been beneficial. On this hillside, when protected from wild rabbits, they have done amazingly well. One, for instance, was in a nursery bed in which propa- gation under constant mist was being carried on for three years. The soil became so water-logged that two young oaks were killed but the golden larch grew so vigorously that it had to have its side branches pruned back to keep it out of the way of the other choice plant material. Another young tree had its leader blown out when it was about 10 feet high. It recovered so quickly that it is now difhcult to find the point at which a side branch took over, even after the tree has been pointed out. One seedling was bitten back to the base by rabbits but it sprouted up again and grew into a vigorous plant. Two of the Sappington trees were MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 11 presented to the Garden by the Feder- ated Garden Clubs in 1953. Choice plant material was set out and the area was dedicated on May 22nd. The golden larches have grown well. They are now about 20 and 30 feet high and every year become of more interest to visitors. Their beautiful lower branches have been somewhat damaged by chil- dren running through the Garden, grabbing branches as they run, an ever-increasing problem both inside the Climatron and out-of-doors. Trees in the background have pro- vided shade, particularly for the larger specimen, and the Museum Building itself has helped to break the force of hot southwest winds. Neither tree has shown any winter injury. The only serious problem with these golden larches in St. Louis has been needle blight. In the last five years this has become increasingly common on bald cypresses (Taxodium), the true Cedars (Cedrus), the dawn-red- woods (Metasequoia) and the golden larch (Pseudolarix). All of these when uninfected have particularly attractive foliage which seems to be more sus- ceptible then the harsh needles of the other conifers. With small specimens this can be controlled by spraying with Zineb, a process which becomes more difficult and expensive with large trees. The golden larches at the Garden for the last two years were unaffected. Both at the Garden and in the Sap- pington area it has been apparent that golden larch trees which are moderate- ly shaded by nearby but not overhang- ing trees are less effected than those with more sunshine. The discoloration made by the leaf spot organism, though certainly not beneficial to the tree, is rather natural looking and reminiscent of the autumn coloration. This is handsome but fleet- ing. For a very few days the leaves turn from green to gold, then quickly fade to red brown as they begin to fall. They are in truth, ‘Golden Larches,” for only a few days a year. On the specimens at the Garden some of these red brown leaves linger longer than the others and year after year be- come more attractive in the autumn landscape. In the original Chinese for- ests where many trees were involved the mingling of green and gold and redbrown may have been much more spectacular. EpGarR ANDERSON HEAD START FOR SPRING SEEDLINGS By ELEANOR Ope of the pleasantest of winter pastimes is starting seedlings in the house. And it can be a profitable project as well, for you can. select seeds of the latest flower introductions and choose hybrid vegetable varieties that have built-in disease resistance. McCLURE Furthermore, your home-grown seed- lings can be moved into the garden at the most propitious time and with a minimum of shock. As a result, they can benefit from the fine growing weather that so often comes in very early spring. 12 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN However, if your Project “Head Start” is to be a genuine success, you should exercise care and restraint, in about equal parts. Carried away by pre-spring enthusiasm (and __ those bright pictures in the catalogue), you may be tempted to start too soon, sow too many seeds, and plant too thickly. These difficulties can be avoided if you limit early seed sowing to just a few varieties and plant just enough to produce the approximate number of plants actually needed in your garden. When selecting seed, give preference to slow-growing flowers that really need a head start. Among annuals that may be planted now are salvia, ver- benas, petunias, snapdragons, annual hollyhocks and asters. Fibrous be- gonias and bedding dahliahs may be grown from seed, as well as perennials like dianthus, gypsophila, coreopsis, shasta daisies, and various kinds of columbines. One of the best ways to get a start of delphiniums is to sow seeds in early spring. Seeds of onions and Chinese cabbage need an early start, but sweet peppers and tomatoes should not be planted before March 15. Tomatoes that are started too soon are apt to become lanky, anemic-looking weaklings. Many of the hoary old theories about transplanting have been dis- proved. We now know that digging and resetting seedlings does not “pro- mote strong root growth.” On the contrary, each move can bring a set- back. Tomatoes, for example, will produce earlier and heavier crops when their growth has not been checked at any point between germination and fruiting. Transplanting shock can be prac- tically eliminated if you start your seeds in the convenient little peat pots. An easy way is to plant just two or three seeds in each pot. The weakest ones can be weeded out after germina- tion, leaving the strongest seedling. The peat seems to stimulate the roots, so that they make a very dense and fibrous growth. Asa result, the plants can be handled with ease, even after the pots have partly disintegrated. At planting time the seedling, pot and all can go right into the ground. As an aid to germination, either per- lite or sphagnum peat can be substi- tuted for dirt. The perlite can be purchased in large bags from any firm that sells building supplies. The small white granules (which are an expand- ed lava) are superior to sand, for they provide a very light and airy medium. Unlike vermiculite, the perlite never becomes soggy or compacted. Sphagnum moss, which can be ob- tained from a florist, should be rubbed through a screen made of fine-mesh hardware cloth. Like perlite, the moss provides fine aeration and excellent drainage, thus encouraging rapid and sturdy root growth. Moreover, seed- lings grown in these inert and nearly sterile materials are not subjected to damping off and other soil-borne dis- eases. There will be no packing or crusting of the surface, nor excessive washing when pots are watered. The pots should be filled to the top with the moss or perlite and then tapped lightly, to make it settle a bit. Large seeds may germinate better with a light covering. Very small seeds, like petunias, can be scattered thinly MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 13 on the surface. As the plantlets de- velop, the sturdiest ones can be lifted with very little disturbance to their roots. They may be replanted in a pot or tray that will afford ample elbow room. When started in either perlite or sphagnum, seedlings should be fed once or twice a week with a weak fertilizer solution—half strength Ra- pid-Gro, for example. This will give them a well-balanced ration. Another good system is to partly fill pots or flats with garden loam, leaving room for an inch of perlite or sphagnum on top. The seeds then germinate readily, but as the roots develop they can pene- trate into the soil to find an ample food supply. These materials—peat pots, trays, growing medium, and packets of sol- uble fertilizer—may be purchased in handy seed-starter kits that are now widely available. Some kits will have small heating cables that can be used beneath the pots, thus speeding ger- mination and growth. Most helpful of all, perhaps, are “grow lights” to overcome the biggest handicap of the window sill garden: insufhcient il- lumination. Even when grown in a sunny south window, seedlings tend to bend to- ward the light, and then look thin and leggy compared with the © sturdy plants grown in a greenhouse. This condition can be corrected by adding an ordinary incandescent bulb, sup- ported by three wire legs and provided with a shade to direct the light to the proper spots. Natural daylight’ can thus be balanced, so that plants won’t have to keep turning toward the window. For a larger seedling population there are fluorescent grow lamps that are like the ones used for African violets. Beneath these strong lights the seedlings can be grown in close to greenhouse conditions. This means, too, that they may be grown in any spare room, or even in the darkest corner of the basement. The enthusi- astic hobbyist can make a fairly per- manent installation, with batteries of lights installed above shelves or tables. One portable unit, which is sold at a St. Louis nursery, has a sturdy metal frame about five feet tall, supporting three wide shelves. Each shelf has its own light unit. The lights may be turned on and off automatically by an electric timer, much like the ones used in henhouses. A good schedule: lights on at 7 a. m., off at 11 p.m. Very small seedlings need high light intensity and should be brought to within two or three inches of the lights. This can be done by placing them on a small carton, a wooden box, or a platform made of stacked-up bricks. Whether grown in pots or flats, or windowsills or beneath lights, the seed- lings will appreciate higher humidity than is found in the average home. One way of increasing humidity: place the pots or flats on large trays or pans covered with gravel. Water should then be poured into the trays and kept at a low level, so that the containers do not actually stand in the water. Small trays or flats of plants can be given nearly greenhouse humidity if they are kept inside a turkey-sized 14 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN plastic refrigerator bag. A section of plastic sheeting or shower curtain can be used to increase the humidity for plants growing on shelves beneath fluorescent lights. Seedlings are ordinarily grown for only a few weeks in these plant “in- cubators.”” It may be necessary to find roomier quarters for some on a glassed- in porch. Sometimes it is possible to enclose basement window wells with plastic to make small greenhouses. Most cold-tolerant plants (pansies, columbines, and cabbages, for ex- ample) can be moved to a cold frame in early March if the weather is “nor- mal.” A simple but very workable frame can be made with four boards nailed together and fitted with a sash of glass or plastic. Another very simple plan is to use a heavy wire frame that can be draped with plastic sheeting to make a small dome-shaped or tent-like shelter. TIME TABLE FOR STARTING SEEDLINGS FEBRUARY PERENIAL FLOWERS THAT PREFER COOL GERMINATION — (cold-resistant seedings that should be hardened off and exposed to somewhat cooler tem- perature, so that they can be planted outside in early spring): hardy alyssum (Basket of Gold), hardy candytuft, pinks, and other rock garden peren- nials; perennial campanulas (like peach bells), columbines, various types of delphiniums, including Chinese, Bella- donna and Bellamosa varieties, and tall- growing hybrids like the Round Table series; gaillardias, coreopsis, shasta dai- sies, tufted pansies (violas). ANNUALS THAT TAKE A LONG TIME TO MATURE BECAUSE THEY GROW sO sLOWLY. They must be protected from frost and should not be planted in the garden before May 1. Included are petunias, snapdragons, new varieties of coleus, and fibrous rooted begonias. HarDY VEGETABLES THAT CAN BE SET OUT IN THE GARDEN IN VERY EARLY SPRING: cabbage, cauliflower, celery, parsley, and onions. Beets and lettuce can be started in pots for early transplanting. Marcu 1-15 Annual flowers: ageratum, verbenas, annual pinks, torenia, salvia, Vinca rosea, dwarf bedding dahlias. Vegetables: sweet peppers, Chinese celery, and broccoli. MarcH 16-31 Annual flowers that grow rapidly: asters, calendulas, cockscomb and the decorative celosias, Chinese forget-me- (baby’s- breath), annual phlox, scabiosa. nots, annual — gypsophilia Vegetables: eggplants, tomatoes (preferably wilt-resistant and hybrid varieties for best performance). APRIL 1-15 Annual flowers: annual alyssums, cosmos, various types of marigolds and zinnias. These seedlings can be moved to the garden in early May. Vegetables: cucumbers, melons, and even pole lima beans can be started in peat pots. These tender vegetables can be moved to the garden after April 15 if they are placed beneath a plant pro- tector. Otherwise it is best to wait until early May. MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN 15 THE ALCOHOLIACEAE: A MONOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT M* studies of this unusual family of plants began eight years ago this last Christmas when I received from the first man to recognize it, an inscribed copy of his invaluable en- cyclopedia.* Later editions of Exotica grew larger and larger, less easy to hold in the hand, and I finally carried my own copy over to the office. In easy reach of the telephone, it has been invaluable in answering questions about the kinds and names of house- plants which come to me from scien- tific collegues and the general public. It was not until last summer while using one of Mr. Graf’s convenient indices, to answer a phone call, that in running my eye down a column it lighted on the specific name “cocacoli- ensis.” As soon as I had a spare mo- ment I went back to the “Index of Plant illustrations” to find the whole reference. This was quite a job, for after a long telephone conversation all my mind retained was the word “coca- coliensis” and a vague impression that it was in a genus fairly far along in the alphabet. When I found the reference it was a surprise. It indicated that Rumandia cocacoliensis was illustrated on page 000, and there was no such page. This made it fairly certain that Mr. Graf, a dignified and successful business man (who produces Exotica in his so- called spare time) was up to some sort of monkeyshines, yet he definitely does *Exotica. Pictorial Cyclopedia of Indoor Plants. Alfred Byrd Graf. Julius Roehrs Company, Book Department, Rutherford, N. J. 1957. (There are several editions.) not look like that kind of person. I searched for Rumandia in one or two books and found no mention of such a genus. Then I tried some of the other indices in Exotica and finally con- sulted Mr. Byrd’s ingenious coded summary of botanical and_ practical information on page 500. It was all there under ‘R’ and in this reference he had really been kicking up his heels: Rumanpia Alchoholiaceae craw cocacoliensis (Antilles) ‘Cuba libre,’ tall, stemless, succulent, with brown, frosty bloom, often with lemon flavor; good in summer: keep cool. The code symbols “CIS” and “W,” I looked up in the proper place. The first indicated “Useful in cool, inter- mediate, and hot Tropics” the latter “Never allow such plants to dry out.” Further study and consultation with experts yielded only negative informa- tion. I could find no references to Rumandia in later editions of Exotica, and though two of my colleagues have known Mr. Graf longer than I have, they had never stumbled on to_ his botanical analysis of the Cuba libre, nor could they suggest what further mischief he might be up to with the name Rumandia. Perhaps some reader of the BULLETIN can give a clue as to any significance, beyond “rum and I.”’ At least we now have a short item to lay beside Edward Lear’s classical foolishness, in the world’s pitifully small store of Botanical Nonsense. EpGar ANDERSON 16 MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN BULLETIN BOOK REVIEW Creative Decorations with Dried Flowers — Dorothea Schnibben Thompson. Hearthside Press, N. Y. 1965. $6.95. TT attractive primer of 125 pages was written by the wife of a Chemistry professor who helped her develop the drying of flowers with silica jell so that much of their color was retained for some time after dry- ing. It deals exclusively with that technique though it scarcely mentions its particular difficulties. Some of the decorations illustrated in color would be attractive in almost any living room but the manual as a whole is as feminine as a_ boudoir. Among other items it illustrates and gives full directions for: (1) Plastic butterflies in pastel shades, bearing dried red celosia blooms to make the body look velvety while clusters of dried forget-me-nots form blue spots (2) A lady’s hat of peach-basket size, completely covered on the wings. with dried flowers and dried leaves. (3) Painted sardine tins with gold beading around the edges, made to ex- hibit tiny toy animals and dried flow- ers on the walls of a child’s bedroom. All of this is very jolly, and I am sure the little girls were delighted with such bright bits of nonsense. How- ever, before he tip-toes away, may a male reviewer suggest that the book might also have included such stately arrangements of dried flowers and leaves as those one sees at Charlottes- ville, Williamsburg and Natchez. A comparatively small group of southern gentlewomen have developed the pro- duction and display of dried flowers into a fine art. The manual’s in- clusive title would suggest that such decorations could well have been illustrated.
