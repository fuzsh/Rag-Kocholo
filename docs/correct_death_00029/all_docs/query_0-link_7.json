        "text": "Gustav Anderman was an interstellar mercenary, who, during the 16th Century PD, took control of the planet Potsdam and the New Berlin System, founding the Andermani Empire.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHe was born in 1442 PD[1].\n\nThe planet (then known as Kuan Yin) was in a desperate situation at the time of his arrival. Because its native microorganisms made agriculture almost impossible, the colonists were on the verge of starvation. Anderman, a highly intelligent and competent leader, brought in modern microbiologists and genetic engineers, who developed new, microbe-resistant food crops. The colonists were only too happy to accept Gustav's leadership, and honored him by renaming the planet Potsdam and adopting German as their national language. Anderman proclaimed himself Emperor Gustav I soon afterwards. (HH6)\n\nAlong with Cutler Gensonne, he later overthrew Ronald Devane and took control of the Nimbalkar System. Some time later, Gensonne attempted a coup against the Emperor, and Gensonne left to found the Volsung Mercenaries. (MA2)\n\nIn 1546 PD, Anderman died after an extended illness, and his son, Andrew, assumed the throne as Gustav II. His daughter, Florence Hansen, attempted to oust Andrew shortly after he assumed the throne, but the coup ultimately failed. (MA4)\n\nCharacter[]\n\nDespite being a gifted leader, Gustav was a decidedly eccentric individual. He genuinely believed himself to be the reincarnation of Frederick the Great. To that end, he dressed up in period costume from Frederick's time, and designed the dress uniforms of the military to look similar. As of the time of Gustav XI, his uniform designs were still in use. (HH6)\n\nKlaus Hauptman once privately reflected on the similarities between Gustav and Napol√©on Bonaparte; while the armchair strategists of Manticore, such as Reginald Houseman, professed to despise both men as uncultured warmongers, the scale and audacity of what they achieved was sufficiently impressive to inspire envy, and even a temptation to imitate their example. (HH6)\n\nWork[]\n\nEmperor Gustav I later wrote a book, Sternenkrieg, explaining his philosophy on war. (HH2)"
