As a volunteer at the South Mountain Recreation Area, you are about to assume an important role in the preservation of 11,000 acres of public land, two national historic monuments, Maryland’s first State Battlefield and one of Maryland’s most popular multi-use recreation parks. Your duties and responsibilities will ensure the safety of and provide a great experience for 680,000 visitors. The success of the operation of the South Mountain Recreation Area is a direct result of our volunteers.\n\nBe safe and enjoy your time and the work you do with us.\n\nVolunteer Opportunities\n\nCamp Hosts\n\nThere are many benefits to hosting in a state park in Maryland. By working 25-30 hours a week, you camp for free in a beautiful setting and become part of our family. Water, sewer and electric are all included.\n\nGreenbrier has 165 campsites. We stay very busy during our camping season and there is a lot to do. Duties for hosts include:\n\nIntroducing yourself to each of your campers as they arrive and supplying them with Greenbrier’s camping rules and information about the park and surrounding area.\n\nCleaning the campground bathrooms. Although we have a cleaning crew, it will be your job to make sure the bathrooms are clean during the times when the cleaning crew is not here. Also, you will need to inspect the bathrooms for necessary repairs.\n\nCleaning the campsites after they are emptied (grills, trash, raking the pads). The fire rings can be heavy, so you should be capable of lifting 20 pounds.\n\nOrganizing weekend activities and programs for the campers.\n\nPicking up trash throughout the park, especially in the evenings after a busy day.\n\nAssisting park staff with other aspects of the park’s operation.\n\nAssisting with special functions or activities.\n\nStaffing the toll booth or camp office.\n\nMonitoring the park’s trails so that they stay clean and beautiful for the visitors.\n\nWe will provide an orientation/training class to all hosts. A camp host is a very important job. You make people feel welcome. A host can turn a negative experience into a positive one.\n\nPicking Up Trash on the Beach\n\nThere is a beautiful white, sandy beach at Greenbrier. Camp hosts are assigned days to pick up trash, including holidays and weekends. We supply you with latex-free gloves, trash-pickers and trash bags. You would just need to bring appropriate footwear for a sandy beach and a desire to pick up all kinds of trash, from cigarette butts to beach toys. The beach is within easy access of the parking lot.\n\nTrail Overseer\n\nWith almost 11 miles of trails, Greenbrier State Park can always use volunteers to walk the trails and pick up trash, note fallen trees and other trail maintenance issues, and in general, be an extra pair of eyes and ears in the more remote sections of the park. You would need appropriate footwear (the trails can be very rocky), clothing and gear, including drinking water. We would supply trash latex-free gloves, trash-pickers and trash bags. Most of the trails are classified as moderate to strenuous, so be prepared for some fairly steep hills and rocky terrain. Some training and familiarity of the park would be required.\n\nThe Appalachian Trail is a footpath across 2,168 miles of Appalachian Mountain ridgelines from Georgia to Maine. Almost 40 miles of the A.T., as it is affectionately known, cross Maryland, most of which follow the ridgeline of South Mountain.\n\nApplachian Trail History\n\nIn 1921, Benton MacKaye, a Harvard-educated forester and self-styled philosopher, came up with a revolutionary idea: a linear park, extending from Georgia to Maine. Thousands of volunteers and many legislators helped make it happen. With the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps, the trail became a reality by 1937.\n\nTrail users of all types enjoy the A.T. -- most just for short day hikes or an overnight backpacking trip. Others set out for weeks or months on the trail. Hundreds of people each year \"thru-hike\" the trail -- hike the entire length of the trail in one season. This takes four to six months, lots of planning and incredible strength of body and mind. Others who hike the entire trail may take many years to do it, as time, money and other constraints restrict them to doing a section at a time. Either way, it is a rewarding experience.\n\nMaryland's 40 miles are considered fairly easy by A.T. standards, with only a 1,650 foot change in elevation from the low point at the Potomac River (250' elevation) to the high point at High Rock (1,900' elevation). There are few rocks and steep climbs compared to other parts of the trail in other states. However, it still offers plenty of challenges and some impressive scenery. For beginning backpackers, those getting in shape for longer trips and those with just a few days to spend on the trail, the entire length of trail in Maryland can be done in a four or five day backpacking trip. Trail shelters and backpackers' campgrounds are spaced approximately a day's hike apart.\n\nScenic overlooks and historic sites provide a great destination for those looking for a challenging day hike. Some popular day hikes include hiking from Greenbrier State Park to Annapolis Rock and Black Rock, from Greenbrier to Washington Monument State Park and from Gathland State Park to Weverton Cliffs.\n\nRemember, the Appalachian Trail can be strenuous with steep slopes and difficult footing. Please follow safe hiking practices. For more detailed information about the A.T. in Maryland, you can purchase the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club's Maps 5 and 6 -- Appalachian Trail across Maryland and the Appalachian Trail Guide to Maryland and Northern Virginia -- at the Greenbrier visitor center or camper registration office.\n\nWhether your goal is scenic beauty, history, bird and wildlife watching, exercising or just wanting to get away from it all, the A.T. offers all these things and much more. Help protect the beauty of the trail by following Leave No Trace practices -- leave nothing but footprints, and take nothing from the trail but memories.\n\n​Popular Day Hikes Along the Appalachian Trail\n\nDestination: Annapolis Rock (elevation 1700')\n\nAccess Point: Parking lot on Route 40, one-quarter mile east of Greenbrier.
