To ensure the safety of our visitors and protection of the park’s natural resources and facilities, the park has a limited capacity.\n\nDuring periods of high visitation, when the park’s capacity is reached, the park will be closed and traffic will be turned away from the park entrance. When that occurs, no additional vehicles/visitors will be allowed to enter the park, including those with members of their party who may already be in the park. If you are not traveling in the same vehicle with others in your party, we suggest that you all arrive at the same time.\n\nWhen the park is closed due to being full to capacity, individuals and groups with shelter and/or camping reservations will be admitted, as parking is reserved for those purposes.\n\nBased on recent experience and visitation trends, and depending on good weather, Cunningham Falls State Park will likely fill to capacity and close on Memorial Day and Fourth of July holiday weekends, and other weekends during the course of the summer. Please take this into consideration when planning your trip.\n\nCell Phone Service:\n\nPlease DO NOT rely on cell phones for communication while in the park. Many phones and carriers do not get service in the Catoctin Mountains.​​​​​​\n\n​\n\nAlerts\n\n​​​\n\nLake, Beach and Falls Area Closures​\n\nOn warm spring/summer weekends, the Lake, Beach and Falls Area of Cunningham Falls State Park may close due to capacity limitations. All traffic will be turned away from the entrance. The area usually re-opens in the afternoon. If you are not traveling with your party we suggest that you all arrive at the same time to insure the best chance that you will all get in.\n\nNo Cellular Service\n\nPlease be advised that most areas of Cunningham Falls State Park have very limited cellular service. Your phone may not work at the park. Please plan ahead. If you are meeting another party within the park, please make sure to set up a time and location to meet.\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nCunningham Falls Hiking\n\n​Although many visitors wish to get an up close view of the spectacular natural attraction, swimming is prohibited and climbing is not advised at the falls. This policy is in place for the safety and protection of both the visitors and of the natural resource. Park staff has responded to hundreds of accidents at the Falls, most of which have been a direct result of visitors slipping or falling while attempting to explore the falls. In addition to visitor safety, we are dedicated to protecting, conserving and enhancing our natural resources. By eliminating human impact at the Falls, we are ensuring that the falls will be preserved as a wild and natural resource.\n\nHelp us protect our treasures. Please no hiking or climbing off of the trail in or around Cunningham Falls (McAfee Falls).\n\nFirewood Alert\n\nFirewood for camping can be purchased onsite or from a local vendor. Please do not bring firewood from great distances into the park. The Emerald Ash Borer and other forest pests are known to spread through the transportation of firewood. Please help us keep our trees safe. For more information please visit The Maryland Park Service Firewood Policy web page\n\nIron Masters Ruins\n\nThe iron masters ruins in the Manor area of Cunningham Falls State Park are temporarily closed to the public.\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n​\n\n​​​\n\nVirtual tour of the Catoctin Furnace African American Cemetery Interpretive Trail\n\n*Virtual Program*, may be accessed at any time\n\nThe Catoctin Furnace African American Cemetery represents what is thought to be the most complete African American cemetery connected with early industry in the United States. More than 100 individuals who labored at the iron-working furnace and in its surrounding community from the 1770s to the 1840s were buried there. The trail begins in Cunningham Falls State Park at the ruins of the historic Catoctin Furnace and leads to an overlook near the African American cemetery. Panels explain the ironmaking process, explore the historic buildings and tell the story of the workers who lived and worked in the furance and village. The trail is an unpaved smooth, ADA-style path that is approximately half a mile long with two viewing platforms. Open daily during park hours.
