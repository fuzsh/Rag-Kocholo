The death of Jasper Lockwood, which took place at his home, No. 1910 Buckingham road, Los Angeles, on Mar 17, 1915, removed one of the pioneer railroad men of Southern California. Mr. Lockwood had been in the employ of the Southern Pacific Railroad from young manhood until his retirement at the age of sixty years, having been assistant superintendent of the road, a position to which he had risen from that of telegraph operator. He was one of the few men remaining who had ridden on the Golden Spike Limited in April, 1876, the first through train between San Francisco and Los Angeles..\n\nOn December 26, 1844, Mr. Lockwood was born in Madrid, NY and came west to Nevada as a young man, finding employment with the Southern Pacific Railroad there, with which company he was associated continuously thereafter until his retirement from actual service in California. In the Southern California city of Los Angeles he was one of the organizers and charter member of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and of Pentalpha Lodge No. 202, F & A M . For six years he and his wife had charge of the Los Angeles office of the real estate dealer, George H Peck in the Lankershim building, Mr. Lockwood's own interest in real estate being evidenced by the fact that he built six houses in Los Angeles, three of which he occupied temprorarily. He was married in California to Mary B. Cord, who was born in Indiana but removed to the Pacific coast with her parents when an infant. Her father, Thomas A Cord, was a pioneer settler of Oakland, Cal., who later lived at Pomona, where he was a pioneer settler and where he was an extensive land owner. The one daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Lockwood is Nell Lockwood, the well known contralto singer of Los Angeles, soloist in the First Methodist Church of this city, and a pupil of Estelle Hart Dryfus and also of Cecil Fanning, the famous baritone singer of New York.\n\n7.

WITHERBEE PASSES AT MORLEY\n\nCAME OF EARLY FAMILIES OF BUCKS BRIDGE\n\nBorn, Florence Lockwood, in Old Stone House on , Road from Morley to Bucks BridgeMarried Charles M. Witherbee Jan. 26, 1881A Home Woman, Deeply Interested in Morley Library AssociationThe Witherbee\n\nFamily.\n\nMrs. Florence Lockwood Witherbee, wife of Charles M. Witherbee and mother of Carl M. Witherbee of this village, passed away at her home in Morley about 9 o'clock Thursday evening, after an illness of about a year, following a stroke. Funeral service was conducted at the home Sunday after noon at 2:30, the Rev. Arthur O Northrup of the Wesleyan Methodist Church officiating. Interment at Evergreen Cemetery, Canton. The bearers were old friends and near neighbors in the vicinity of Bucks Bridge and Morley, as follows: Otis Dandy, Leon Bartholomew, William Finnimore, William Rowen,Simon Westaway and Royal Westaway.\n\nMrs. Witherbee was born at the old Lockwood home, a short distance from Bucks Bridge on the road toward Morley on Feb. 21 1856, the daughter of John Murray and Sarah Hall Lockwood. Both the Lockwood and Hall families were of the early families of that section of the towns of Potsdam, Lisbon, Morley and Canton, all four towns abutting each other in that vicinity. The old stone house\n\nwhich Mrs. Witherbee was born still stands by the road, on the bend of the river in the town of Potsdam, still occupied by a member of the Lockwood family.\n\nHer early life was spent in the vicinity of Bucks Bridge and here Charles M. Witherbee of the Witherbee family of Morley came to court her in the seventies and eary eighties. The marriage of the two took place in the Lockwood home on Jan. 26, 1881, the Rev. Samuel Short, minister of the locality at the time, officiating. There are not many who attended that wedding nearly fifty-eight years ago who are sill alive today.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Witherbee in the succeeding years farmed it and for some years Mr. Witherbee was engaged in the making of cheese. About eighteen years ago they removed to the old Witherbee home at Morley as you make the turn before crossing the bridge on the road from Canton. Here at this time lived a cousin, Louisa I. Witherbee, a graduate of St. Lawrence University, class of 1873, who passed away something over a year ago.\n\nDuring tha years following the coming to Morley Mrs. Witherbee has lived a quiet and home life. She was wrapped up in her family and the home. Outside of this she took a deep interest in the Morley Library and the Library Association and spent a great deal of time with this. She was president of the association. She might be likened in this respect to members of the band of devoted women who a few years ago brought into life Canton library and made it one of the vital things of the community.\n\nShe was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, but attended he Wesleyan Methodist Church of Morley on account of nearness and convenience in attending.\n\nThe life of Mr. and Mrs. Witherbee during all those years from that January day in 1881, was the ideally happy one. They were blessed with a family of three children, all of whom are now living and in health, having their own\n\nfamilies, a son and daughter residing in this village and a daughter, a resident of the town outside of the village of Canton.\n\nThe husband, Charles M. Wither probably Charles Miner Witherbee, the name Miner being that of his father. The name of Witherbee dates well back in the history of the town of Canton. It is recalled that two of the older Witherbees were Miner and Luther Witherbee, tannery men of Morley.In the early days Morley, like other\n\ncommunities throughout the country, had among industries a tannery. The Witherbee brothers and the tannery at Morley are still remembered by the older people of\n\nthe town. Of the sons of Miner Witherbee were Joseph V., Luther, Daniel, Silas O., and Charles M. The three former, it is recalled, were all students at St. Lawrence University, Joseph and Daniel graduating, and Silas who was a\n\nmember of the class of '67 left St. Lawrence before graduating and entered Columbia University, receiving\n\nan M.D. degree in 1867. He died within the month in the\n\nMiddle West at the advanced age of 92 years. Joseph V., long an educator in Brooklyn and principal of schools 69, 24 and 106, was of the class of '80 of St. Lawrence\n\nand received a B.A. degree from Harvard in 1881. He is still living, at present at Winter Park, Florida, a neighbor of his old friend, Irving Bacheller, the North Country\n\nwriter. Miss Lois I. Witherbee, above mentioned as a cousin, was daughter of Luther Witherbee, brother of Miner, and a cousin of the four Witherbee boys.\n\nCharles M. Witherbee is in his eighty-fifth year and in excellent health, well preserved physically ind mentally for one of his years. Mrs. Witherbee leaves besides the husband, Charles M. Witherbee, a son, Carl M. Witherbee, and a daughter, Mrs. Mildred Collins, wife of George Collins, both residents of this village, and another\n\ndaughter, Mrs. Cora Woodbridge, wife of George Woodbridge, a resident of the town of Canton. There\n\nare also two sisters, Miss Louisa M. Lockwood of Bucks Bridge and Mrs. Mary Dowd, who resides with her daughter at Queens Village, Long Island.
