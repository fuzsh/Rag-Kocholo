        "text": "Hello Alpha,\n\nIn order to help a little more information would be needed, like date of birth, death. Where did he die? Records are held in the area where the event happened. His birth record you would need to request in Denmark. If he died in the Philippines his death records should be there. Unfortunately there are too many Frederick Johnsons in the US records all over why a little more information would be helpful. What was the name of his wife or the names of his children?\n\nSabine\n\nHello Pitzie,\n\nwe are searching one and the same person Captain Frederic Johnson.\n\nit caught me by surprise that someone is searching for him.\n\nanyway, I want to be connected with you and also we could share some info about him.\n\nmay I know who you are and your family? and where you at now\n\nhoping to hear from you\n\nAlpha\n\nIf he was born in Denmark and maybe died in Denmark did you check old newspapers in Denmark for obituaries for example for 1913?? In accordance to a book he had very bad bone cancer eating in to his leg so dying from wounds sounds like a possible cause of death. A family tree also suggested that he was married to a Philippines woman but they did not have any children.\n\nIf you know he is your great grandfather, there are no records out there with any vital dates?? Did you work your familytree back step by step? Usually all vital records have information also about close family members.\n\nBy checking for example ancestry you also will find military records for the Philippines for around 1910. A Frederick Johnson was among the soldiers but it needs more digging to identify him. The unit is noted and also that he was absent with leave."
