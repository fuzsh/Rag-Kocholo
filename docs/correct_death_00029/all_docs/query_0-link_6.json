        "text": "The final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s life – and his unceremonious end – still fascinate and confound, perhaps in equal measure.\n\nTo any students of history familiar with the events of Germany’s tumultuous past, the idea that one of the most hated despots to have ever lived would die by his own hand – contrary to any glorious end he may have desired or the cold justice he deserved – seems ironic at best, perhaps even darkly comical in its absurdity. His death in the concrete Führerbunker would come to symbolise the end of one of the bloodiest wars in human history – even though the capitulation of Nazi Germany would not take place until eight days later. So great was the personality and myth surrounding this one man.\n\nHis role, cast as the central figure responsible for orchestrating the continental downfall of Europe, seems assured. His legacy – while not as resplendent as he may have desired – has meant that his name will go down in history for future generations as a byword for evil.\n\nBut the earthly end of this caricature madman could not have been more human. Flawed, desperate, and petulant. Punctuated by a suicide – and an hastily performed funeral.\n\nOne involving a pyre of dirt and kerosene – in the garden of the New Reich Chancellery.\n\nThe event widely acknowledged as signalling the moment the Nazi party seized power in 1933 came on January 30th – as party leader, Adolf Hitler, was appointed Chancellor by ailing President Paul von Hindenberg. The musical chairs of German politics of the 1920s and 30s had resulted in the fall of countless governments – and Chancellors and cabinets vested with power only to see it snatched from their hands within weeks or days.\n\nHitler’s appointment as Chancellor on January 30th was far from inevitable – and uncertain up until the minute of his confirmation. It would take less than a month for the Nazi party to confirm that the jitterbug swing of the Weimar era be replaced by a jackbooted march to the sound of a different drum.\n\nFollowing a fire in the German parliament, on the night of February 27th 1933, emergency measures were introduced to suspend civil liberties and allow the Nazis – as the leading political element – to crack down on opposition. Imprisoning and torturing politicians, suppressing dissenting voices, and closing down publications deemed a threat to public good. All in a move towards establishing a single party state – one where all roads would lead to one man, Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe passing of the Reichstag Fire Decree (or Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State as it was officially known), issued on February 28th 1933, would provided the legal basis for these actions.\n\nWhen the so-called Enabling Act (officially the “Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich”) passed in parliament on March 23rd 1933, plenary powers would be effectively devolved to Adolf Hitler – in his role as Chancellor and head of cabinet. Leaving the Nazi leader now able to issue laws without parliamentary oversight, thus transforming Germany into a legal dictatorship overnight.\n\nOn assuming power, Hitler had inherited an office on the Wilhelmstrasse government street. The Reich Chancellery was actually a former city palace built for the Polish Prussian prince Antoni Radziwiłł who had married the niece of King Frederick the Great.\n\nDesignated as the future Führer’s official address, its dimensions and decoration – those ‘fit for a soap company’ – would do little to satisfy the Nazi leader’s desire to impress on visitors the power and granduer of the kind of German Reich he envisioned. Despite the enlargement of the Chancellery and the addition of an underground Vorbunker air raid shelter in 1936 – it was deemed wholly inadequate to the Führer’s needs.\n\nIn 1938, construction began on an enlarged New Reich Chancellery, on the adjacent Vossstrasse, designed by Albert Speer – the ‘first architect of the Third Reich’ and future Minister of Armaments. Both Speer and Hitler would later work on plans to transform Berlin into the world capital, Germania.\n\nKeeping with Hitler’s insistence on monumental design, Speer would oversee the construction of a huge court of honour (Ehrenhof), where visitors would be greeted by two statues from sculptor, Arno Breker, named “Wehrmacht” and “Partei” (“Armed Forces” and “Party”). Passing through double doors measuring 17 feet high, and along a gallery 145 m (480 ft) long – twice that of the Hall of Mirrors in Versaille – diplomats and dignitaries would reach Hitler’s cavernous 400m2 office suitably reassured that they were in the presence of one of the most powerful leaders on the planet."
