        "text": "This study intends to convey to an English-speaking professional audience letters of America’s first male saint, John Nepomucene Neumann (1811-1860), which he wrote during the period of his studies in Bohemia, i. e., in Budweis 1823-1833 and Prague 1833-1835. The last letter was written while leaving his native country, Bohemia, for the USA in 1836. Twenty-five letters have been preserved from the concrete years 1824-1836. With one exception, they have never been published. Besides Neumann´s Spiritual diaries (1835-1839) and his Autobiography (1852), which have long since been published, these letters are very valuable for getting to know the personality and context of the early life of the future saint. All those letters were originally written in German. They are preserved in archives in Italy, the Czech Republic and the USA.\n\nThe study focuses primarily on presenting the current state of scientific research of an important figure of Czech and American religious life of the nineteenth century, John Nepomucene Neumann (1811-1860), canonized in 1977. His legacy regarding his life and his thinking is still vividly reflected globally, especially in the American, Czech, German, and Austrian professional theological and Church-historical community. It also wants to show new perspectives on the research of those parts of Neumann’s life and the subsequent process of canonization that took place in his native Diocese of České Budějovice (Bohemia, now the Czech Republic), in broader contexts of events in the Habsburg monarchy, as well as in the Catholic Church, theology and society of nineteenth-century Europe.\n\nThe process of the canonization and beatification of John Nepomucene Neumann began in 1886 in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Diocese of Budweis. His canonization was completed in 1977. The study presents the as yet uncharted topic of the informative process in the Diocese of Budweis in 1886-1888, including a follow-up examination of John Nepomucene Neumann’s written estate in 1891 and other activities and events related to the Neumann’s process of beatification and canonization up to the beginning of the so-called Apostolic process in December 1896. This study seeks to describe in more detail the ecclesiastical legal process of the whole case; in addition to the context, it seeks to show in a broader horizon the so-called second life of John Nepomucene Neumann in the Diocese of Budweis, which was associated with the spread of his spiritual legacy.\n\nJohn Nepomucene Neumann is an important figure, especially in Czech and American religious life in the nineteenth century. This study intends to present John Neumann’s study years in Budweis in the years 1823-1833. Above all, it reflects newly and critically on Neumann’s diaries and letters, his autobiography, and other sources in confrontation with new knowledge about the various contexts of Neumann’s life. Broader contexts are formed by life in the then Habsburg monarchy and the Diocese of Budweis itself. The narrower context concerns life itself in the town of Budweis. The closest monitored context is the specific educational and formation institutions that Neumann attended in Budweis: the Piarist gymnasium (1823-1829), the Institute of philosophy (1829-1831), and the episcopal seminary (1831-1833).\n\nThe process of the canonization and beatification of John Nepomucene Neumann began in 1886 in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Diocese of Budweis. His canonization was completed in 1977. The study presents an as yet uncharted topic of the apostolic process in the Diocese of Budweis in 1897-1901 and other activities and events related to Neumann’s process of beatification and canonization in the Diocese Budweis until the decree on Neuman’s heroic virtues was issued in 1921.\n\nRudolf Chytil (1910-2004) was a Czech Redemptorist who was persecuted and even imprisoned during communist totalitarianism. For part of his priestly life, he was forced to work as an ordinary labourer. He used his linguistic talent, especially in translating works dedicated to John Nepomucene Neumann. None of his translations have ever been published. His most important work is an ensemble called “Neumanniana”, which contains translations of Neumann’s autobiography, his letters, letters from his family and friends, and family documents. This study provides readers with an extensive introduction to Chytil’s “Neumanniana”, in which he seeks to answer why Neumann never received a single letter from his loved ones when he was in the United States."
