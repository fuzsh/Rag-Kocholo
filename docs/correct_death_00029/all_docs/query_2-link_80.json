        "text": "Rossbach war (1757), during the Seven Years War, was one of the few examples where it was the Prussian cavalry and artillery, not the infantry, that were the deciding factors of the battle.The opposing Austro-French army of 40,000 troops had marched south, in an effort to take the Prussian army in the flank. Although at first believing that they were retreating, Frederick soon woke up to the danger and set off to meet them with his army of 20,000.Taking advantage of the cover provided by a long ridge, General von Seydlitz led the Prussian cavalry south in an effort to meet the enemy cavalry head-on. Their initial charge was resisted stoutly by Austrian cuirassiers, allowing the French cavalry to rush in to support. However, when von Seydlitz ordered in his reserves, the allied cavalry buckled and fled.The Prussian artillery had set up on the heights to the northeast, and bombarded the advancing French infantry mercilessly as they advanced. This, and the sight of their cavalry in flight, sent tremors throughout the ranks.And then the Prussian infantry advanced. As the French army came within musket-shot, they were shredded by disciplined Prussian volleys from the leading battalions. When von Seydlitz’s cavalry took them in the flank, their lines collapsed entirely, and they fled the field in disorder. The Prussians suffered 600 casualties to almost 10,000 of the enemy.Frederick later boasted that \"I won the battle of Rossbach with most of my infantry having their muskets shouldered.\" He had a point. In less than ninety minutes, the Prussians had wiped the French from the field with with a fraction of their entire force: 18 artillery pieces, 3,500 horsemen, and three battalions of infantry.Following his shattering victory at Rossbach, Frederick went east to confront the Austrians, his battle-weary forces marching a distance of 300km in 12 days. As he was wont to do, Frederick had seriously underestimated the size of the enemy force, and when his army of 35,000 met the Austrian army at Leuthen, he found that he was facing an army of 65,000 soldiers. But, as at Rossbach and Soor, superior numbers counted for little when facing the Prussians.The Austrian army formed up by the village of Leuthen, facing the Prussians. Taking advantage of the fog that covered the battlefield, Frederick feinted a frontal attack, while moving the bulk of his army south. He used a series of low hillocks to first move his infantry past, then beyond, the Austrian left flank. Once the columns were in position, the entire force formed up at a right angle to the Hapsburg line. And as the Prussian artillery opened up on the enemy, Frederick ordered his infantry to attack.Marching in staggered or “oblique” formation , the Prussians rolled up the Austrian left flank, the weakest part of their line. Astonished by the sudden appearance of the Prussian troops on their left, the Austrians attempted to turn their line 90 degrees and face the enemy head-on.But it was no use. The Hapsburg troops on the left - Lutheran Württembergers - had no stomach to face fellow Protestants in battle. They fired off a few volleys, but as soon as Frederick’s blue-coated legions broke through the haze, they turned and fled, crashing into the Bavarians rushing to reinforce them, who also broke and ran.The Austrian regiments withdrew to the village of Leuthen, where they attempted to make a stand. Prussian Lifeguards and Grenadiers led the assault on the village, aided by devastatingly accurate artillery fire, and after long, grinding close-quarter combat, they succeeded in taking the Austrian positions. The white-coats withdrew, and when they were hit on the flank by the Prussian cavalry, it was all over.The Austrian army had been utterly routed by a force that it had outnumbered 2:1, in what I would judge to be the greatest-ever Prussian feat of arms. The Prussians had lost 6,500 men, while the Austrians had lost 22,000, including 17 generals, 116 pieces of artillery, 51 standards, and their national pride.In August, 1786, he ordered the army to go through a number of sham fights. While witnessing one of these he caught a chill which brought on an illness from which he never recovered.At about twelve o'clock on the night of his death, one of his dogs which was sitting near him was shivering with cold, and Frederick said \"Throw a quilt over him.\" These were the last words which he spoke, and at half past two he was dead."
