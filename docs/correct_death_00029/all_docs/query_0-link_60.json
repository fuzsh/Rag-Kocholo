Paul Colby was happy when he rose into the air with his great bomber on Feb. 3, 1945. He thought he was on his last mission before he could return to his home and his family, whom he has seen only once for five days, in all the time from his enlistment in the air corps to his going overseas. It was, indeed, his last mission. He was killed in action. His body is coming home on the U. S. Army Transport Haiti Victory.\n\nPaul was the youngest son of Mr. and Mrs. Earl Colby, 118 Woodstock st. His older brothers Lester and Laverne were also overseas. Paul was graduated from Crystal Lake high school in 1941, then worked for the National Grain Yeast Co. until he enlisted in the air corps on Jan. 10, 1943. He went first to Muskogee, Okla., then to San Antonio, Tex., Shephard Field, Tex., Sioux Falls, S. D., El Paso, Tex., Topeka, Kan., Yuma, Ariz., and then was sent to Biggs Field, Tex., for the B-21 bomber training program. In Aug. 1944 he shipped overseas.\n\nWith the 93rd bombardment group he started bombing Germany two years before the Allies invaded Africa. By early 1945 his group was distinguished as the first to complete 300 combat missions. He had a part in getting glider-borne gasoline to the men surrounded by the Germans at Bastogne.\n\nOn Feb. 3, 1945, he was reported missing in action over Germany and then in March his parents received the heartbreaking telegram informing them that he had been killed in action.\n\nFrom the\n\nCrystal Lake Herald\n\nCrystal Lake, Illinois\n\n(McHenry County)\n\nThursday, June 2, 1949\n\nFuneral Services\n\nfor T/Sgt.

Funeral services will be held in the Querhammer Funeral chapel at two o'clock Saturday afternoon, the Rev.

He was graduated from Crystal Lake Community high school in 1941, enlisted in the U. S. Army Air corps on Jan. 10, 1943, and in Aug. 1944 shipped overseas. With the 93rd bombardment group he started bombing Germany two years before the Allies invaded Africa. By early 1945 his group had already distinguished itself as the first to complete 300 combat missions. What was to have been his last bombing mission before his return to the United States, was, instead, his supreme sacrifice.\n\nA memorial service was conducted by the Rev. George B. Draper in the Methodist church.\n\nHe was buried in the United States military cemetery in Neuville-en-Condroz, nine miles southwest of Liege, Belgium. The cemetery was under the constant care and supervision of United States military personnel, but decision was made to discontinue it last October and Mr. and Mrs. Colby requested that their son's body be returned home for final burial. They had received the posthumous award of the Purple Heart and a citation of honor from the U. S. Army Air Forces, reading as follows:\n\n\"He lived to bear his country's arms. He died to save its honor. He was a soldier....and he knew a soldier's duty. His sacrifice will help to keep aglow the flaming torch that lights our lives...That millions yet unborn may know the priceless joy of liberty. And we who pay him homage, and revere his memory, in solemn pride rededicate ourselves to a complete fulfillment of the task for which he so gallantly has placed his life upon the altar of man's freedom.\"\n\nIt was signed by H.
