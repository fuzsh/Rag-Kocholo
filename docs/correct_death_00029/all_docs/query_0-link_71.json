Please return to Kurenets Home Page and click NEW GUESTBOOK.\n\nI talked to Chaya Esther Nee Gurevitch/ Horwitz-Raich in New Haven, Connecticut. She was known in Kurenets as Chaya Gurevitch, the daughter of Chayim Israel Gurevitch. Chaya Esther (first cousin of my grandfather; Meir son of Mordechai gurevitz) had five much older brothers and two older sisters who were related to her only from her fathers side. Chayim Israel was married to the daughter of Shmuel Malach Alperovitz. She died in 1917. From her mothers side she had a sister and a brother from her mothers marriage to a Pilskin. Her mother was originally from Miadel and she would visit the cemetery there where her parents were buried. Her paternal sister Leah Nee Gurevitch-Benes lived in Kurenets. Her husband was Zusia. They didnt have any children. They perished on 10-9-1942. Her other paternal sister, Rachel nee Gurevitch-Mula lived in Svir. She had a son Volvel, and two daughters. Her maternal sister Sonya lived in Dolhinov. She was married to Kaminkovitz. They had four or five sons. They all perished in Dolhinov. Her maternal brother was Rabbi Pilskin, who lived in Baltimore. He had a son who was a rabbi in Israel. From her five paternal brothers, one lived in Minsk  Yehoshua. He survived the war and returned to Minsk. One of his sons perished and the others whereabouts is unknown to Esther. Her other four brothers moved to New Haven, Connecticut many years before the war. Chaya Esther was hiding with her neighbors in Kurenets. Leibe and Freida-Bilka Ziskind and their three daughters, Dvora, Rivka, and (?). On that day, the Germans came to kill the residents of Kurenets. They hid underneath hay piles for a few days and then they were able to escape to a nearby village, where a Christian farmer who knew the Ziskind family told them how to reach the Narutz forest, where other people from Kurenetz were hiding. They were able to reach the forest and they spent two years hiding there with many others from Kurenets. Today Chaya Esther is responsible for the meetings of the Holocaust survivors in the New Haven area. She told me about other survivors, such as Sonya from Dolhinov and her husband Baruch Markman from Kurenets, and Charles Gelman (who was known as \"Chetzkel Tzimerman) and his sister Dishka (who lived in New York).\n\nGurevitz family pictures;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/gurevitz.html\n\nMany other families pictures could be found if you scroll down the page;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/kurenets.html\n\nfor pictures of the Gurevitz/ Horwitz family click here\n\nFor; Alperovitz | Baksht | Berkovitz | Cheres | Davidson | Dinnerstein | Dubin | Gordon | Greenhouse | Gurevitz | Katz | Katzowitz | Kopilovitz | Kramnik | Kremer | Krivitsky | Meirovitz | Norman | Podberesky | Potashnik | Rabinovitz | Rabunski | Shiniyuk | Sosensky | Shulman | Swirsky | Turov | Zaltzman | Zimmerman | Ziskind | Zusman for the families pictures click and then scroll downs\n\n- Thursday, February 14, 2002 at 21:39:51 (PST)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would like to thank Roger Rice for the beautiful pictures of the KRIVITSKY\n\nFamily and for the two books that his great uncle David Krivitsky wrote c 1948.\n\nDavid dedicated the one of the books to his sisters Liba (Rice) and Chana and I think to the memory of his brother Harry (It is written in Yiddish)\n\nOne of the poems is dedicated to his sister Liba Rice another to his brother; Harry Kamin. Many poems are dedicated to friends. Amongst them childhood friends from Kurenitz; To Moris Cohen who also wrote in the kurenitz Yizkor book;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_matia.html.\n\nAnother was dedicated to His childhood friend; Chaim Zalman Shulman.\n\nAharon Meirovitz was very kind and translated it to Hebrew and asked me to post it here. You could find it in two parts;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pix/israel/61101_23b_heb_b.gif\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pix/israel/61101_23c_heb_b.gif\n\nAharon chose the poem for the love that David had for his hometown Kurenitz that he left so many years before. Most of the krivitsky family lived in New Haven. Some (Like Alexander) changed their last name to Winik.\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/krivitsky.html\n\nclick for pictures of the Krivitsky family\n\nUSA -\n\nDear Eilat:\n\nShalom, while doing a search for EINBINDER I found (see below) a message that you left in a guestbook........\n\nI just had a new discovery. I had been reaching a branch of my\n\nMothers family with the surname, Skolnik or Shkolnik, all this time.\n\nI have now learned that the family name in the beginning to mid 1800's\n\nWas changed from EINBINDER.\n\n<blockquote type=cite cite>Vetter Mendel Einbinder was Dovid's brother. Another brother was Chatzkle Alperowitz. The original family name was Einbinder. In order to avoid conscription into the Russian army, Chatzkle and Dovid took different surnames. Chatzkle changed surname to Alperowitz and Dovid changed surname to Skolnik\n\nDovid Skolnik was my great great grandfather. He was from a place not far from Vilna called Vileika / Wileika. His brother Chatzkle Alperowitz lived in a small town called Dunilowitz.\n\nThe many of my Skolnik and Alpert(owitz) family are located in New Haven CT.\n\nThis is all I know at the present. I've just started looking into my\n\nEinbinder family.\n\nDoes any of this information sound familiar???\n\nAll the best,\n\nJay Lenefsky -Israel\n\nhotdog@netvision.net.il\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nEilatGordn@aol.com wrote:\n\nShalom,\n\nI am starting a shtetl page for Krasne, Belarus.\n\nin the eidb I found; ;Anbinder,Chaje Krasne, Russia 1913 63y\n\n54 Anbinder,Schame Krasna 1906 35y\n\n55 Anbinder,Zyzic Krasne, Russia 1913 18y\n\nAlso my relatives are the Einbinder family of New Haven who came from Kurenets in the 1920s' (next to Krasne, in the area of Vileyka).

There were a few other Einbinder families in Kurenits as in Dolhinmov- Yitzhak Einbinder was a well known partisan from Kurenitz - read the story of Zalman Uri Gurevitz (my mothers first cousin); http://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_gurevitz.html\n\n\"Amongst us were Benjamin (Nyomka) Shulman, Shimon Zirolnik, Yitzhak Einbender, Mordechai (Motik) Alperovitz, Nachoom Alperovitz, and I. Our original troop leader was Kopel Spektor, a man of all seasons- an athlete, a bookworm, a mathematician, and a generous and dedicated person. He was like a father to us. During the days of the Soviets, he was a technician and a cartographer in the central train station in Molodechno, 30 kilometers from Kurenets. He was graduate of a technical institution in Vilna and an extremely capable man......One of Vlodia's men dressed as a policeman and took Noach Dinnerstien, Eliyahu Alperovich, Yitzhak Einbender, Nyomka Shulman, Yankale Alporevitch and I . We pretended we were prisoners going to work in the Vileyka camp, the partisan was very convincing in his roll as a cop. When we arrived we had to hide for many hours till nighttime came. All together there were about 40 people at the meeting. They pretended that it was a dance party. Inside everyone was armed. Berta introduced Vlodia as the commissar of the partisan Otriad. Vlodka said we must forget each others names; each one will get a nickname. We would work secretly, and most importantly make sure that no traitors infiltrated our group\"\n\nmichaelp55@hotmail.com writes:\n\n<< Shalom!\n\nMy mother's maiden name is Kurinets, and we come from Bobruisk, Belarus, but my mother always said that family came from the town of Kurinets.

The Klors have homes in Hamden, CT and in Delray Beach; FL.\n\nBoris was born in Michalishek in 1921. Sara was born in Vileyka. her mother was from the Norman family (a relative of Shalom and Moshe Norman) Her father was from the Baskin/ kooperstooch family of Ilja. The original last name was Baskin but some of the family changed their last name to Kooperstooch to avoid serving in the Russian army prior to the First World War. I found some Information on the Baskin family by using a search engine. I will post it in the next note.\n\nSaras' family moved from Vileyka to Michalishek when she was still a young child.\n\nShe practically grew up with Boris Klor. As they grew they fell in love. Sara moved to Vileyka during the rule of the Soviets (1939-1941) It was easier the get a job in Vileyka that had many official Soviet offices.\n\nIn the summer of 1941, the day before the German invaded the Soviet Union, one of Saras' sister came for a visit in Vileyka as summer vacation started. Both sisters were able to get on a train to Russia during the first days of the German invasion. They survived the war somewhere in the eastern regions of Russia. Unknown to them a brother was also able to arrive in Russia. Two sisters were in German camps. One Perished and the other survived.\n\nBoris klor is the only person who survived the war from his entire family. He was taken to ghetto Vilna with most of the Jews of his shtetl. He was able to escape in 1943with a group of 27 young people mostly from Grodno, who were helped by some Jewish partisans from the Narootz forest. It took them five days to reach the forest. they were able to bring nine pistols. He later joined Warshilov Brigade under markov. he served there with many from Kurenets, Svir, Myadel, Postov, Krivichi and more. he knew many families from Kurenets who hid in the area. For a short time he also served in the jewish unit under Yosef Glazman. He told me about rivka Gvint, Rivka Alperovitz, shimon Zimerman, Sara and Moshe Alperovitz (Rashkas'- my great grandmothers' sister) Ester Reich (Chaya Gurevitz the daughter of Israel- my great grandfathers' brother) and Zalman, Gershon, Lea and their father- Natan Gurevitz, the brother of my grandfather)\n\nAfter the war Sara and Boris found each other. They came to Germany via Poland and tried to get papers to settle in Israel. Saras' grandmother from the Baskin family- was in the U. S for many years. she looked for survivors and when she found them she was able to get papers for them and they all came to America. .\n\nI found a site with relatives of Sara; BASKIND FAMILY HISTORY\n\nhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jlevinson/moearticle.html\n\nBy Moe Baskind\n\nAs I at last begin writing a history of our family, my greatest regret is that my sister Rose is not alive. She would have given me much information of an interesting nature that I only possess slightly.\n\nOur family came from what is now either Poland or Lithuania.(now Belarus) We are classed however as Litvoks. My fathers family lived in a village called Ilya. If you can find a large map of Russia or Poland you might spot it. I once saw it on a map, but I don't recall what book. It is somewhat south of the larger city of Vilna.\n\nMy father, born about 1861 was the second oldest of a family of six boys and one girl. The oldest although in my cousin Joseph Baskind's book he calls him Menachim Mendel. Next was my father, Avrum Pesach, then David \"Cooperstock,\" followed by Hirschl, Itche, Rivka (who became an Arian) and Shmeul. In Russia the eldest son was exempt from army duty so somehow David was made the eldest son of a Cooperstock family. They were the only family that never came over, although some of the children came here, and some landed in Israel.\n\nHow they all made a living before coming to America, I can't tell you. Their parents names were Berel and Rashi. Their father died rather young, and they were all out on their own when youngsters. Their mother died about 1904 or 1905, and I believe at the time, only my Aunt Rivka was living in Europe.\n\nHow well I remember the peculiar custom prevailing then that when a letter came from Europe announcing the death of a parent or close relative, the news was kept from the immediate family member. Sometimes, for a year. It would seem that this would have an effect on saying kaddish, and why a death was kept secret, I don't know.\n\nChai Mendel who landed and stayed in New York was a shammes and part reverend. He was the father of Joseph, a prominent member and General Secretary of the ARBEITER RING, the national Jewish Labor organization. His other children were Louie, who has some children living in Miami Beach. Tillie Broida, who lived in Pittsburgh for a while, and then moved to New York, and Fannie, who also lived in New York. The other son who stayed in New York was Uncle Schmuel. The was the father of Rose Somberg, now living in Cleveland.\n\nI believe Uncle Hirshel, the father of Dinah Slavin, Minnie Baskind, Beckie Minister, Rose Kohl, and Manny was the first to arrive in the United States. His wife, Tante Sarita, was distantly related to the Brudno family of Cleveland and perhaps that is why they came to Cleveland. The Brudno's already had a large stogie factory in Cleveland. I remember it on lower Broadway. It must have been five or six stories high. When Uncle Hirschel came to Cleveland, he immediately went to work for the Brudno's. My Aunt Sarita was very proud of her ancestor, Menasseh of Ilya, who is mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britanica as one of the five famous pupils of the Vilna Gaon. That is why there are so many Emanuel's in their family.\n\nTante Rivka married an Arian who was either a first or second cousin to the Baskind's. They were the last of my fathers family to come over and consisted of Ida Newmeyer, George who lived in California, Rose, now with the Blonder company and retired. Harry a druggist who passed away early in life, and Ben, the only one born in this country Ben passed away in 1973. The reason they came later was due to the inability of my Uncle Isaac Arion to enter this country on his first attempt. How well I remember his efforts, only to be turned away at Ellis Island in New York because of weak eyes. I don't remember how many times he tried but finally made it.\n\nMy Uncle Itche came over as a single man, and then brought over his future wife Sarah. I vaguely remember their wedding, although Minnie Baskind says she remembers it well. I think it about 1901 or 1902. They had four sons and one daughter. All the sons became the famous druggists of Cleveland. Harry, the oldest became the first Jewish Chairman of the State Pharmacy Board in Ohio. Perhaps the first Jew in that capacity of any state. Harry died in 1975. Next was Jack, now retired, who recently celebrated his 75th birthday. Then came Al and David, who passed away early in life, and last, the only girl Florence. Of course all of these cousins of mine have numerous children. There were many other cousins from Uncle Schmuel's family as well.\n\nNow some information of my mother's family. She was born about 1863. They were not poor as my fathers. Her father and mother, Beritche and Pia, lived in Kablonka, a small village not too far from Ilya. My grandfather inherited the rights to the lease of a grain mill plus some small acreage of land. I call it rights because they were not allowed to own any land. However their ancestors received that right from the Poretz or Count who owned the land for many miles around.\n\nMy mother had an older sister Shana who married a specter and had one son, Abe. None of Abe's children survive today. Other children of Shana are Dinah Kline, who had several children. Gute Friedland, who had Dorothy and other daughters and sons whom I don't remember.\n\nA younger brother of my mother Moshe Hirschel Alpert had to leave a daughter in Europe because of illness. Another daughter was Freda Rubenstein who lived in Denver and passed away in 1976. Freda had a son and a daughter. Her daughter lives in Denver and is called Mrs. Mosco. Abe, a son of Moshe Hirschel was a druggist, now passed away. How many children, I don't know....\n\nto read Moe Baskin's story click here\n\n-\n\nhttp://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/collections/exhibits/tam/JLC/2origins.html\n\nThe Jewish Labor Committee (JLC) was founded to provide a presence for Jewish labor in the councils of the American trade-union movement and in the Jewish \"establishment,\" and to mobilize labor in the struggle against fascism.\n\nIts founding meeting, at Central Plaza on New York's Lower East Side, on February 25th 1934, brought together more than a thousand delegates representing the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), Amalgamated Clothing Workers, United Hebrew Trades, Workmen's Circle, Jewish Daily Forward Association, and a number of smaller groups. Baruch Charney Vladeck, general manager of the Forward, was chosen president; David Dubinsky of the ILGWU, treasurer; Joseph Baskin of the Workmen's Circle, secretary; and Benjamin Gebiner, also of the Workmen's Circle, executive secretary. Holding that only a broad-based workers' movement could overthrow Hitlerism, the JLC emphasized its labor orientation and nonsectarian philosophy. Its aims were to support Jewish rights everywhere, support all progressive and democratic anti-fascist groups, aid refugees, and educate the American labor movement (and the general public) about the Nazi threat.\n\nThe JLC was the brainchild of B.C. Vladeck, a brilliant writer and organizer who was known for the elegance of his Yiddish oratory and who was adept at navigating the perilous waters of New York immigrant politics. Vladeck, like most of the early generation of Jewish American labor and socialist leaders, had served his political apprenticeship in the famous \"Bund\" or General Jewish Workers' Union of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.\n\nThe Bund was a Jewish social-democratic party (legal in Poland, illegal in Russia), which sustained its own network of schools and cultural/fraternal institutions devoted to the strengthening of Yiddish culture and socialist values. Generally hostile to both Zionism and Communism, it was associated with the social-democratic Second International. In many areas, the founders of the JLC were translating and adapting lessons learned in the ranks of the Bund for use in the very different social milieu of America.\n\nWorkmen's Circle\n\nHS 2330.W6 B3 1951 Y.

We lived on a farm.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: We are recording some\n\nreminiscences on Sunday, March the 10th, 1980,\n\nsome of Mom's and Aunt Bea's reminiscences of\n\nwhat life was like when they lived in Europe.\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Seventy-six years ago.\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Well, I lived all my childhood on an estate which belonged to a Polish count. His name was Shizdevski (phonetic spelling). It was a beautiful surroundings; hills, wood-covered, nuts that we used to go in the summer and gather them, dry them and have them for the winter.\n\nThere were lakes where my brothers used to get up at four o'clock in the morning and go fishing and were always successful. There was a beautiful stream that ran right through the estate; clear water, not like what you see here. Wildflowers on the hills and meadows, an orchard full of pears and plums and apples within a few steps of our kitchen door.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: Well, now, you rented this land; why did you have to rent it?\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Jews in Russia were not permitted to hold any kind of land.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: Did you pay the count money, or did you give them part of the --\n\nEEDA HURWITZ: No. We paid him. on the farm, we raised cows.\n\nBEA WEINBERG: We had a dairy.\n\nREEDA HURWITZ: We had a dairy. And we had chickens. We had geese. And we had ducks and our own --- the chickens laid, we had our own eggs and our own vegetables. We had a garden. We had all kinds of vegetables for making pickles and sauerkraut and all the edible vegetables; potatoes, carrots.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: Who worked the farm and\n\nraised the vegetables and took care of the cows\n\nand chickens and everything?\n\nBEA WEINBERG: We had the mujiks, what were known as the mujiks, the Russian peasants who lived right in little houses on the farmland.\n\nBEA WEINBERG: They were paid and they were given enough of the vegetables, the fruits and all.... SYLVIA LEVINSON: What would they be\n\nequivalent to what we know? Is there anything equivalent to that in this country?\n\nBEA WEINBERG: I don't think so.\n\nBURTON LEVINSON: We have tenant farmers.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: Would that be like that?\n\nFREEDA HURWITZ: No. We used to give them\n\nshares of the --\n\nNow, we had a dairy, as was mentioned before. And the milk would be sent over. There was a boy that was also, probably, a Jewish boy that would get fifty or sixty dollars a year.\n\nAnd the milk would be loaded in tremendous vats, like, see, and he would take it to the market. There was a market on certain days in the little town; what was it?\n\nFREEDA HURWITZ: Danilovich.\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Danilovich it was called.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: And that was the closest\n\nlittle town to you?\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Yes. Yes.\n\n9 FREEDA HURWITZ: Yes.\n\n10 SYLVIA LEVINSON: So when you are talking\n\n11 about little, how many people lived there? Was\n\n12 it like a --\n\n13 FREEDA HURWITZ: Like a village.\n\n14 BEA WEINBERG: I wouldn't say, because I\n\n15 don't know, and I wouldn't want to speak as to\n\n16 how many.\n\n17 FREEDA HURWITZ: It wasn't as big as\n\n18 maybe, maybe as big as Lebanon or those little\n\n19 places around.\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Well, we don't know how big Lebanon is.\n\n22 SYLVIA LEVINSON: But it was where the farmers would bring their --\n\nBEA WEINBERG: It was small. It is what you call, what is known in Yiddish literature as a shtetl.\n\nFREEDA HURWITZ: Yes, a shtetl. There were a lot of Jewish people there, a lot of Jewish people.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: About how far would you\n\nimagine your --\n\nBEA WEINBERG: I would say twenty miles.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: About twenty miles from\n\nthere?\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Yes.\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: And then he would sell\n\nthe milk?\n\nBEA WEINBERG: He would sell the milk and bring the money. And we had I don't know how many cows, a lot of cows and sheep and geese; not ducks much because we didn't have any water ....\n\nSYLVIA LEVINSON: And those were the\n\n2 Alberts, then.\n\n3 FREEDA HURWITZ: Yes. Alperovich was\n\n4 their name in --\n\n5 BURTON LEVINSON: You see, these places\n\n6 where they lived was what was known as the Pale\n\n7 of Settlement. And that was the land that was\n\n8 set aside where only Jews could live and where\n\n9 only Jews could trade. That was the Pale of\n\n10 Settlement in Russia.\n\n11 SYLVIA LEVINSON: So that was where Aunt\n\n12 Sonny and what, the Fettershimmin (phonetic\n\n13 spelling).\n\n14 FREEDA HURWITZ: Yes, the Fettershimmin.\n\n15 BEA WEINBERG: When we lived --\n\n16 SYLVIA LEVINSON: Whose brother was that,\n\n17 Grandma's brother?\n\n18 FREEDA HURWITZ: It --\n\n19 SYLVIA LEVINSON: Papa's sister.\n\n20 FREEDA HURWITZ: Papa's sister.\n\n21 SYLVIA LEVINSON: Oh, she was grandpa's\n\nBEA WEINBERG: Yitzhak didn't live -- he\n\n13 lived in Postov.\n\n14 FREEDA HURWITZ: In Postov.\n\n15 SYLVIA LEVINSON: Where was Postov.\n\n16 BEA WEINBERG: Postov was, I suppose,\n\n17 about forty miles away\n\n22 sister.\n\nclick here for the rest\n\n-\n\nI am searching for my great grandfather Harry Simon.

Velvel had thirteen children (with more then one wife) most of his children came to the U.S c 1900 and settled in New York. Some if his children were:\n\n1. There was a son Motel  Morris Alperovitz who lived in New York and changed his last name to Alpert. He had two children.\n\n2. A daughter Chaya Zipa married.. Taryevitz. They had four children. Two of them never came to the U.S. Motka and Zalman lived in Gorki after the war. 3.\n\n3. There was a daughter Ester Goss who lived in New York and had a son and a daughter.\n\n4. Another daughter was liza Dimond of New York\n\n5. Michaels mother was Gitel who was born c 1895. She married Chaim Gitelman and moved to Krivich to open a shoes manufacturing business. In Krivich Michael and his sisters were born. (Michael 1920?). Later own the family returned to Kurenitz. From 1934- 1937 michael attended the \"Tarbut\" School in Dolhinov. In 1939 Michael left the Kurenitz area and lived in Gorki. During the war he was in the far southeast region of the Soviet Union. After the war ended he was in germany and tried to get papers to go to Israel but was not able to. During that time he found out that both his mother and his father had a large family in the U.S that was looking for any relatives who survived. In 1949 he came to the U.S. The only other relatives who survived were the Norman brothers.\n\n6. Meir Aharon Alperovitz died in Kurenitz before the war. See end of text post for information about his family.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nToday I called Shalom Norman in Israel. He told me that every year he attends the memorial meetings for the Jews who perished in Vileyka. The meetings are held during Purim since most of the residents of Vileyka and other Jews who worked there from near by shtetls, were killed during Purim of 1942. In 2002 the meeting will be held on the 28 of February.\n\nMost of Shaloms' family was able to escape from Vileyka by train to Russia during the first days of the German occupation. Shalom thinks that hundreds of people from Vileyka were able to escape by trains, and most of the towns Jews survived.\n\nFrom reading the Yizkor books of other communities in the area and talking to people I know that it is not so in other communities. At the most about 10% of the Jews survived and very few of them were able to escape during the first days. Most who tried were turned back when they reached the old Polish-Russian border. Many did not try because they had no idea of the coming horrors.\n\nIn 1939 when the Russian invaded they sent people to Siberia but did not kill any.\n\nSo most people in other communities were then under the impression that only the communist Jews would be in danger from the Germans and others, especially women and children would be safe.\n\nLater I called Reuven Norman in Israel. Reuven was about sixteen in 1941. I asked him if he knew if most of the Jews of Vileyka were saved. He said that hundreds escaped by taking trains and others (like him) later on, but more Jews from Vileyka perished then escaped. He said that he would try to find the numbers. He told me that hundreds escaped because Vileyka had a train station and two trains were able to go deep in to Russia during the first days of the occupation by Germany. I asked Reuven why his family did not try to escape. He told me that his father was a guard at the palace in St. Petersburg in 1914. At the start of World War I he was sent to the front and was captured by the Germans. He was a P.O.W for four years and felt that the Germans treated him very fairly during that time. He truly disliked the communists- and said \"The Germans are very civilized people as far as my experience goes- why would they be different now?\"\n\nThe family did not question his decision. At that time the father ruled.\n\nA few weeks later, some time in July of 1941 he immediately volunteered to work when the Germans gave an order to all the Jewish man to come.\n\nWith another about fifty Jewish men from Vileyka he was a taken to work. All day they dug holes in the ground and at the end of the day they were shot and fell in the holes they dug. Some local Christians, who watched it, later told their families about it.\n\nReuven told me that he was hiding in Kurenets with his grandfathers family during the first months of the war.\n\nHis mother was the daughter of Meir Aharon Alperovitz of Kurenitz. She was a sister to Yermiyau, herzel, Shlomo and Feyga Michla Shmukler. Meir Aharon had a sister who married an Eidelman in Krivichi and had a son Michael who now lives in Florida. Yermiyahu and Hertzel Alperovitz died in the Vileyka camp. Both were very helpful to the other people in the camp and hertzel was one of the organizers of the escape. Hertzels wife Leyka survived the escape, Her sister Liba was killed and her husband Mordechai and the two children survived. After the war Leyka married Mordechai Alperowitz (the father of Yeoash). The youngest brother Shlomo was a prisoner of war since 1939. (He was in the Polish army). The family received letters from him for two years until the Germans started the war with Russia. They do not know where he perished.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nI called Reuven Norman in Israel. His mother was the daughter of Meir Aharon Alperovitz of Kurenitz.

They must be- I just misspelled the name. There was a shtetl by the name of Krivich near Kurenets the family must have come from there when Jews took last names c 1820's.\n\nI would \"love\" to have pictures of David and the rest of the family. Also any stories in English or Yiddish.\n\n\"Images\" by David Krivitsky\n\nThe year is 1880. My gloomy, little hometown is a hamlet surrounded by a thick forest and wide, open fields. Her lingering and winding streets converge at the vast, circular focal market. A variety of size and sorts of stores, from the \"huge\" mercantile enterprise of Pini, the metal goods merchant, to a tiny kiosk that belongs to Basha Beyle, the oil merchant, crowd the market. On most days of the week one would find Jews wandering around the market without purpose. The arrival of market day signals the awakening of the sleepy town and affords the poor merchants a flashing glance of prosperity. The hatters repair the hats, the tailors clean the shabby clothing, and the various peddlers prepare bags and sacks to buy all manner of produce: from chickens, to potatoes, to hay. Everyone awaits the farmers that will bring the harvest of their land and toil. My small shtetl contains 300 families; all together about 1500 souls. Some tailors, a few shoemakers, a number of blacksmiths, a small amount of butchers, three big synagogues, and two minyans. A few \"melamdim\" (teachers), \"talmud torah\", and many \"chadarim\". The big world is far from here, and a foreign concept to the inhabitants. They know only the neighboring towns Vileyka, Smorgon, and Molodechno. Of Vilna and Minsk: most townspeople had only heard, very few had actually traveled so far. Most of the people who had traveled had left originally to serve under the Tzar's army. These men tell amazing tales, stories that could not be believed by anybody in their right mind.\n\nThere was a young boy named Bentze Dodge's. He was the son of one of the wealthiest families in the region. His father was an agricultural merchant. They had an extravagant home in the middle of the central market. Behind the main house stood their barns and storage rooms. Bentze would never mingle with the town's children. He was a son of the \"highest status family\" every one else was beneath them. It was not matter that could be easily overlooked considering his uncle was the famous Mr. Bitzkovsky from Smorgon! Bentze had a little puppy, and because he had to keep it a secret from his father, he hid the puppy in one of the barns, and there he would feed and care for him. Bentze poured the affection he withheld from his peers into this little puppy. He would think constantly of new ways to please the little pet. One day he decided that he would begin warming the puppy's food. The boy put a makeshift stove in a hidden corner of the barn, and from then on, he would warm the dog's food. A day came when Bentze was not carefully watching the cooking. A fire started and spread to the hay that was next to the little stove, the flames grew and grew. The boy was very scared, and instead of running home and getting help to extinguish the fire, he escaped from the barn with the dog, dashed across the adjacent garden, and hid in the \"shtable\" (the torah study place) of the Chassidim. It took but a few minutes, and the whole barn was engulfed in flames. In only an hour all of the homes and the stores in the central market were in flames. The flames swallowed the little wooden shacks. Like wild beasts, they jumped from home to home, from street to street, gaining might with each new conquest, until they consumed the whole town with a red, burning rage. The little ashes flew to the farthest homes like smoldering black butterflies. Soon the town was covered with a cloud of dark smoke. The central market leapt with flames. The confused Jews deserted the town and ran first to the fields and gardens behind their homes and then in the direction of the neighboring village of Poken. They carried babies, bags, and dishes - whatever they could save. At evening time, all that was left of the community were the fireplaces and the blackened frames of the buildings that had stood only hours before. The ashes and dust had finally begun to settle. Broken plates and sacks of bedding cluttered the outlying fields. The abandoned bits and pieces appeared to the returning townspeople like open graves. As the smoke disappeared, the totality of the destruction became more and more obvious. Except for Eliyahu Yehosha's mill, and a few homes in the far end of Miyadel Street, the whole town had surrendered to the fire. Days passed, and the Kurenitz community began regaining its old spirit. Townspeople began rebuilding the stores and houses. When they had finished rebuilding the town was nicer than it had been before. Ringing the markets were modern, two story homes. The new stores were built in the fashion of Smorgon. They had even built shelves in the barns. The new synagogues were larger and more beautiful. How had the inhabitants been able to afford to rebuild a town that exceeded what they had ever had before upon the ashes of their old homes? This was a riddle that no one knew how to answer.\n\nBentze grew up and was a student in the high school in nearby Vileyka, and when he graduated, he went to the city of Dvinsk to further his education. In the town amazing stories about Bentze circulated. The people said that he was so successful in Dvinsk, that the governor of the whole province respected him and often invited him to his home for teatime. Others would say that Bentze was leading a movement to abolish the Tzar's authority. Yet others said that Bentze was coming to Kurenitz anytime, and would take care of abusive employers like Asher the haberdasher, that enslaved his assistants, , and Eliahu the blacksmith, who spent his days in the house of prayers, instead of working in the smithery, or the shoemaker Yerachmiel. Rumors spread that Bentze was planning to come to town to assist his relative Masha Bitzkovsky from Smorgon in dividing her father's riches amongst the laborers.\n\nOne morning Bentze appeared! Pandemonium reigned. No one had seen such a personality before. Bentze was tall, he wore spectacles and a black top hat, and carried a cane in his hand and a fancy shawl over his shoulders. A few young women who worked as tailors claimed they knew the truth about this charming and inexplicable man. This was a prince that pretended to be Bentze and had arrived to search for his lost princess. It didn't take many days until everyone had discovered the true reason for his visit. Bentze had remembered for all of his days the annihilation that had arrived at his hands, and agonized about how to pay for his crime. He swore a vow that one day he'd repay the town for the destruction he had caused. And now he had returned to fulfill his promise. Bentze gathered a group of children, boys and girls belonging to the poorest families and established a school to teach them Russian and math. His students approached their non-religious studies with the same enthusiasm as they put into their religious studies. People in town began expressing their discomfort with what was happening. The religious people started threatening|But we're talking about Bentze Dodgs', who had drank tea with the governor of the whole region! I don't know if Bentze repaid the town for the destruction he caused, but this I know for sure: Bentze helped to enlighten dozens of boys and girls, and encouraged them to explore the world passed the pale of settlement They will remember him with deep love, and I am one of them.\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_images.html\n\nto read another story by David click here\n\n-\n\nTo: Eliat Gordin Levitan\n\nFrom: Roger Rice, Somerville, Massachusetts\n\nre: Krivitisky family\n\nFirst, thanks for all your work on the terrific Kurenets website. I have been surfing in search of family history and came across the site yesterday. Towards the end of the Read Natives, Descendants and Others link is the following \"Looking for family of:\" entries- Krivitsky Bessi and David, New Haven, Connecticut and also Alexander Winnick, attorney, New Haven, Father's surname: Krivitsky.\n\nMy grandmother, Lillie (or Libby) Krivitsky was from Kurenets and came to the US around 1898. Her parents were Aaron and Rose (Stein) Krivitsky. She was married to Morris Rice (or, more accurately Reis/Reiss) on June 10, 1906 in New Haven.\n\nMy great uncle David Krivitsky (Libby's brother) was a Yiddish poet and, I am told, an anarchist and political radical of his time. I remember David's periodic visits to New Haven in the 1950's (he slept on my grandmother's sofa, sometimes for weeks on end). At some point in time I asked about two volumes of Yiddish poetry and essays published by David, which sat on my father's bookshelf. I was assured that they were worthless and that I could have them. One book (1948, Grenich Printing, N.Y.) is entirely in Yiddish (which, unfortunately I don't read). The second (1959, same publisher) is entitled Fun Bagin Biz Farnacht (From Dawn to Twilight) and five of the poems are translated into English. Each book has a picture of David (taken I would guess at ages 50 and 70 more or less).\n\nI have a clear recollection of an exchange between David and a cousin, Leo Zimmerman, in which David was describing the experience of laying on his back at night in the Arizona desert and looking up at the stars. Leo wasn't buying the wonder of David's story and replied, \"We have stars in New Haven too\" and suggested that looking at stars wasn't a paying job. I also recall that some time in the 1950's my grandmother received a letter from a niece who was a doctor in Novo Sibersk. I do not know her name, or what became of her.\n\nRegarding your inquiry about Alexander Winnick and particularly the listing of \"Father's surname: Krivitsky\". Al Winnick was for many years the law partner of my late uncle, Milton Rice. I knew that there was a family relationship but never quite understood what that was.\n\nI hope that this is somewhat helpful. If you or anyone else want me to copy David Krivitsky's books or pictures I'd be glad to do so. If anyone has further information about my grandmother's parents and siblings (birth dates, parents names etc.), or about David Krivitsky or the Novo Sibersk relatives I would appreciate any information, including suggestions about how to pursue such inquiries. Also, I notice that one of the translations in the stories section (entitled \"Images\") is by a David Kribitsky. Any chance that Kribitsky and Krivitsky are one in the same?\n\nRoger Rice rlr@shore.net\n\nSomerville, MA USA -\n\nNancy Holdan wrote;\n\nMy Svir website is up. It is just for a preview until I get more information.\n\nhttp://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Svir\n\nnholden@interserv.com\n\nI am pasting here some information from the site;\n\nOur Small Town - Swir\n\nExtracts from a book from the Yivo Institute in New York written in Yiddish. The extracts (ca. 8 pages on the description and history of the town Swir) were sent to Belarus SIG by Arnold H. Wolfe, who had them translated into English by a friend.\n\nThe town of Swir, where we saw for the first time in our lives the rays of the sun: the town that first heard our childish delight; the town where our first tears dropped: the town in which we played and joked throughout our childhood; this was the town that became a part of ourselves like our own flesh and blood.\n\nA long street with two squares and a few small alleys actually made up the whole of Swir, and despite the description it was, in our eyes, the children of Swir, nicer than any other town. Truthfully speaking there were no brick houses in Swir. It was only one side wall and all the other parts of the house were built of wood. The roofs were covered either with shingles, metal or plain straw. Throughout our lifetime many houses grew old. There were houses which were practically sunken in the earth up to the windows. Some homes did not even have wooden floors.\n\nIt was a rarity to have plumbing in the town of Swir. Most of the water was derived from a well quite far away, and yet it seemed a wonder that no one hated this place. On the contrary, everyone was tied to this town with their very lives.\n\nAnywhere a person of Swir was to be found, be it in New York or Los Angeles, in Buenes Aires or in Cuba, in Paris or in Brazil, in London or Tel-Aviv, in that place the one same heart was beating. All of them are bound like brothers and sisters, their lives like one, and all this because of the forlorn little town in a section of Vilna.\n\nThe town was very friendly. Even the nature around us was a witness that our grandparents knew where to build their homes. From one side a stream, and from the other side a lake, and the stream actually flows out of the lake near the houses of the town. Around and around were forests, fields and small towns. The town was not dipped in milk and honey, rather in green fields and flowers and as far as the eye could see were various fruit trees. There were apple and pear trees, plum and cherry trees, and blueberries without end.\n\nDuring the summer the town was surrounded by ears of corn and stalks of wheat. In the winter is was covered with a big white blanket of snow. The Jews of Swir , therefore, lived a very contented life. In the old huts there lived good people and devoted friends. Everyone felt secure in their homes, like a bird in its nest, that is, until the wild barber came and the nest together with is birds was broken and destroyed. Woe! Woe unto the faithful and devoted birds of Swir! Woe! Woe unto their burned and destroyed nest.\n\nHighlights of the History of Swir\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of historical material and documentation is missing, thus making it difficult to relate the exact history of Swir. Not only was our whole city destroyed, but also our cultural and social life was uprooted. We were physically uprooted from our very origin, as well as geographically lost. The sources for further basic knowledge are lost to us today. Unfortunately, the generation that could have enriched us with its knowledge has perished. Yet we made an effort to relate the history of this town in a concise form.\n\nIt is clear that the town carries the name of the great Duke Swerski. His dynasty ruled for hundreds of years over all the surrounding areas. It is also said that on the peak of the mountain there stood a beautiful castle. In his honor not only was the town named after him, but also tens of families named themselves after the great Duke. It was extremely difficult for us to confirm with certainty if the families today named Swirski spread throughout the world originated from Swir.\n\nAccording to all estimations the Jewish community was is existence for hundreds of years. The old cemetery can be a witness to this as most graves are sunken in the earth. The few monuments whose engraving was still legible dated back one hundred and fifty years. The ledger that had all the deaths recorded on it, and their place of burial was passed from one generation to the next, and was an important historical document.\n\nMost Jews of the town wandered in from surrounding towns or close cities. It is difficult to know today whether they came of ther own free will or because of the decree from the Czarist regime that Jews must leave the towns. Therefore, many families who were forced to leave carried the name of their town. The Fuzileher, Shpialer, Dubnikirer according to the origin of their town, for example, the Kurgatkes originated from the town of Kureniaz, Miadler and Shuentzianer. The big fire that broke out at the end of the century practically wiped out the city. Therefore there are no old historical buildings or antiques left. The synagogue was rebuilt after the fire in a modern style.\n\nThe town endured many wars. Napoleon and his army reached there. There is a legend that the Swirer hills thinned out through him. Through the First World War the town practically remained unharmed because the fighting front was further away by several kilometers. Later however, by the Polish-Bolshevik War in 1920 there was a battle before the town was captured.\n\nThe stronghold of the Polish Army was on the hill of Swir, while the yet stronger Bolshevik Red Army was located at the other side of the river. During the fierce battle between the two armies which heavily destroyed many homes, the Jews escaped to the cemetery. The cemetery was in close proximity to the city. The day after the surrender of the Polish Army the Jews returned to their homes.\n\nThey later found out that it was a coincidence that they were saved because they all hid behind the trees of the cemetery. The Russian Army saw that there were large groups of people hiding there and mistook them for the Polish. They were prepared to fire with their artillery when they heard the cry of a child and the sound of animals. They realized then that they were only civilians. In that war an eleven year old boy was wounded. He was Velvel, the son of the Chassid.\n\nThe people who remained alive claimed that after the Second World War the greatest majority of the town was destroyed. The synagogue became level with the earth. The whole area was virtually uprooted. The Christian neighbors made the area into gardens. No vestige of Jewish life, as it was, remained. Most tragic of all, was that from approximately 200 families who lived there, remained only 100 survivors. These people were scattered all over the world, but the majority of them are in Israel.\n\nGeographical and Economic Situation\n\nEven from a distance of 5 to 6 kilometers the contours of the town are visible in the blue sky and extend long and narrow. Especially visible is the hill, the Swir Everest in the middle of the market place, and the Swirer skyscraper the Yedes wall.\n\nThe German occupation of the First World War extended the railroad to Constantine.\n\nSwir is geographically located in west White Russia. The neighboring towns and distances are as follows:\n\nKabilnik - 20 Kilometers\n\nMichlisbak - 21 Kilometers\n\nSventzion - 37 Kilometers\n\nKurenetz - 49 Kilometers\n\nSmargon - 42 Kilometers\n\nAside from the fact that the town was above sea level and the paths were cemented, it was still very muddy on rainy days.\n\nIn back of the town there were lots of mud puddles. The farmers used to go to town through the mud as a short cut. In a dry summer they picked up their pants to their knees and splashed through the mud. During the fall and Spring it was impossible to pass through the mud.\n\nOn the other side of town the ground was normal.\n\nThere were 1900 people in the town of Swir - 1100 Jews and 800 non Jews. Among the gentiles there were White Russians and Poles. It was difficult to differentiate who belonged to which nationality, because many rich people found it below their dignity to admit they belonged to the White Russian nationality. They broke their teeth in order to speak like Poles and claimed they belonged to the Polish nationality. They let these people have their way, in letting them think they were Polish.\n\nThe Jews lived in \"The Street of the Third of May\", which starts at the cloister and goes till the horse market, a length of about one kilometer. That marked the boundaries of the town. Many Jews also lived in smaller streets.\n\nThe people called Staravieren and tens of families built a village at the side of the river and called Sloboda.\n\nMost of the Jewish people in Swir were merchants. In front of every house on the main street where goods were sold, there were many different types of stands. There were textile, dry goods, hardware, building materials, bakeries, butcher and other stands as well. For many people these stands were not their only means of sustenance. In many families it was the job of the wives and daughters to take care of these stands.\n\nThe men were the dealers, and dealt in many different trades. Some dealt with wheat in large scale production. They used to purchase the wheat at the market and exported large quantities to Vilna. Another dealt in the same manner with potatoes, with fruit, with poultry, with eggs, with leather skins, with pig hair and many others. There were many merchants who were occupied only during certain seasons of the year, like fruit gardeners. Besides this, there were many peddlers, and those who worked with their hands like shoemakers and tailors. The Jews of Swir received the main financial help from the bank and the town's Jewish Charity Organization. According to a report from Vilna, there were a total of 140 members who belonged to the Jewish Charity Organization.\n\nThe greatest majority of the Jewish congregation lived very modestly, and yet they were very satisfied and happy. Unfortunately, when the Second World War broke out this contented life was utterly destroyed.\n\nfor the site http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Svir click\n\n-\n\nSzlesinger,Bejle Kurenice, Poland 1921 16y 12 Szlesinger,Chaye Kurenice, Poland 1921 10y 13 Szlesinger,Frzuk Kurenice, Poland 1921 15y going to their father; Solomon- in New York\n\n.\n\nUSA -\n\nDina and Julius Sassinski were brother and sister\n\nDina was born June 15, 1881 in Kurpnitz\n\nShe married Abraham Levine born 1895 in Bialystok, Poland and married 1913 at Kurpnitz, Vilno, Poland.

Scanning attached.\n\nThe first one is an enquiry she had submitted to The Red Cross in Jerusalem on December 11th 1941. It is printed in Polish language on a Red Cross official form as follows: \"Salitenik Bela, from Tel Aviv, 7 Nezah Israel St., Palestine is asking the Red Cross to find out and to let her know the whereabouts and of her mother Freyda Kramnik and family, from Volozhin, Market Square 7, Novogrudek District, Occupied Poland - Belarus\" . The enquiry bears several stamps \"Jerusalem Postage office\", \"Palestine Censor pass\", \"Red Cross Committee  Geneva\" and \"January 9 1942\".\n\nThe second document is the Red Cross in Geneva official answer, typed in Minsk, dated September 23th 1942. It tells in German language that the Gebits comissar in Vileyka could not find out Freyda Kramniks whereabouts.\n\nIt was all the Red Cross in Minsk agents had to tell.\n\nIt happened on the spring and summer months of 1942 when the Nazis executed hundreds of thousands Jewish families in Belarus. The mass slaughters were accomplished at daylight, in sight of the local gentiles, accompanied by music, dancing and ringing the church bells. The sondercomando expeditions acted at this time overall the entire Belarus-Litwak Yiddish Land. Frantz Karl Hess, second lieutenant of the thirty second \" Zondercommando\" had accomplished on may 1942 his bloody acts in Volozhin, Vishnievo, Dolginov and Ivia brutally killing hundreds of Jewish children, men and women among the thousands executed by his unit and its local assistants. (See Frranz Karl Hess Trial in Volozhin Yizkor Book, page 576)\n\nIt was done before the eyes of the entire local gentile population.\n\nThe Red Cross agents certainly knew it, but did not yell. They did not tell a word.\n\nPorat Moshe\n\n972-3-5230085\n\nByron St, 10\n\nTel Aviv 63411\n\nporatm@netvision.net.il\n\nto read Berla story click here\n\n-\n\nMy grandfather Zalman (Sam) Scolnik and his brother Jassel(?) emigrated from Kurenets to Lewiston, Maine in 1908 to join another brother Yudel (Julius) who was already there.

I was told that there are two Shalom Niormans in Rishon LeZion!!\n\nI took both numbers and one of them kept ringing busy (always on the net!).\n\nI called the other number and the young man who answered as Shalom Norman said that he had never seen the Vileyka site but his father Eli was from Vileyka!! I called Eli Norman from Rishon and he told me that he was born in Vileyka but he does not know; Shalom or Moshe or Avi Norman. He left Vileyka as a young boy in July of 1941 when the Germans arrived. He left for Russia with his family and in the last few years- all who are still alive from his Norman family live in Israel. His fathers name was Shalom Norman and since he left vileyka as a very young child he could not give me much information.\n\nSince the other Shalom Norman was still unavailable and it was getting to late to call in Israel, I called Shalom's brother; Moshe Norman\n\nWoodbridge, CT USA.\n\nMoshe had a \"huge\" amount of information to tell;\n\nHis father; Zvi Hirshel Norman was born in 1924 in vileyka. He was the son of Shalom and Rosa Norman. (Rosa's family owned a hotel prior to 1939.) Zvi Hershel had a sister who died of illness long before the war. He had a brother named Izik who was born in 1929.\n\nSometime after Vileyka became part of the U.S.S.R (September 1939) Rosa took her youngest son to Moscow, to visit her brother; Leyzer, A General!!! In the Red Army.\n\nThey found themselves in Russia when Germany invaded the Vileyka area. Zvi Hirshel Norman took a large amount of money from the store he worked as soon as the invasion started and boarded a train to Russia. The soviets were very suspicious of him for his last name that sounded German to them and for the large amount of money that he had. They decided that he was a spy for Germany and sent him to Siberia.\n\nLater he Joined the Red Army and after the defeat of the Germans he moved to Vilna near his uncle; Zusman Norman who also survived the war by escaping to Russia.\n\nLater zvi Hirsh Norman Married Asia and had; Mosahe who is 54 years old and Shalom who is 48 years old. Moshe remembers that during the Jewish holidays his uncle Zusman Norman took him to the synagogue in Vilna.\n\nThe uncle; Izik norman(born in 1929 in Vilyka) fell into a bad company and in his youth lived the live of a\" Russian hooligan\" robbing trains.

My grandparents, Aaron and Rachel Shklyar (first cousins, both named Shklyar), came from Minsk Goberniye, but I do not recall the shtetl name.\n\nAlthough I have not up to this time heard of Dolhinov, I am submitting this query because I noticed long lists of the names Gitlin and Benenson. My grandmother's sister Itteh married a Benenson (also a first cousin, exact relationship uncertain), no children. Two of her other sisters, Riveh Minyeh and Guteh, married Gitlins (two brothers). Another sister, Esther, married a Henkin (Genkin, Genkind, etc). There were also two brothers, Zalman and Dodya, who remained in Russia. Both apparently were killed at Borisov.\n\nMy grandmother's mother's maiden name was Drayzin, and my grandfather's mother's maiden name was Minkoff.\n\nZalman Shkliar also appears in the Minsk marriage records for 1912, but I am puzzled as to why only one name is listed in each of these records, some of them obviously male and others female.\n\nMy grandfather had a brother Shimon Shklyar, who apparently died before 1898 and left a wife and two children. His sister Minyeh married an Edelkind. He also had an apparently much older half-sister (presumably paternal), name unknown. I say much older because she had a son Maileh Levine, born about 1874, who left for Israel in 1914.\n\nCan anyone connect with any of these details?

Juni 1998\n\nRezensentin/Rezensent: Zalman Alpert (alpert@yu1.yu.edu) aus New York City\n\nThe 6th Lubavitcher rebbe is quoted as saying that there were 3 types of Lubavitcher chassidim,those who study the doctrines of Chabad, those of Chabad descent, and those who observe Chabad customs and pray according to the Chabad rite,may I add 1 more type , the Chabad Hassid devoted \"Mekushar\" to the rebbe, . In the last 50 years the latter category has dominated the Chabad scene,as Chabad became inseparable from its 7th generation leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (died 1994). This book is authored by men who fall into the first 3 categories of Chabad Chassid. Alpert descended from the well known Alperowitz clan of White Russia speaks for those who were never completely comfortable with being a follower of Rabbi Schneerson, yet were spiritual seekers, and proud of their Chabad heritage. Naor's introduction is an excellent short summary of the intellectual history of the movement, and is especially useful for its copious notes of various origin. Alpert's stories are memorable, yet a feeling of gloom, depression and death hang over them. Chabad stresses joy, celebration,inwardness but not gloom, and loss of hope, interestingly no where do Alpert and Naor discuss the role humor, joy drinking, and communal celebration play in the life of Chabad. In addition I can't understand why Naor does not discuss the role prayer and meditation play in Chabad. As a historical note, I wonder why Naor does not mention Rabbi Israel Noach Schneersohn of Nezhin as a Chabad rebbe ?Finally Naor and Alpert choose not to discuss Chabad since 1994, do they have any thoughts on the future ? The book leaves me with 2 unanswered questions : Who is Reuven Alpert ? and will there be another Lubavitcher rebbe?\n\n.\n\nUSA -\n\nDate: 12/17/01 7:03:53 AM Pacific Standard Time\n\nFrom: alperowitch@yahoo.com.br (Fernando Alperowitch)\n\nReply-to: fernando@alperowitch.com.br\n\nTo: eilatgordn@aol.com\n\nDear Sir\n\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate you for the excellent work you have done, to put all this valuable information together. I was very impressed with the web site...my sincerely thank you.\n\nSince you had studied a lot about Kurenets, I believe you can help me and my family to better understand what have happened with my ascendants and who knows, contact a relative. My grand father came from Kurenets to Brazil in 1929. He had studied in 2 Yeshivot in the region (Minsk and one more) and after receiving letter from a uncle that had migratted to Brazil, he came here to meet him - the anti-semitism in Polland / White Russia was already fearing the Jews.\n\nHis name is Isaac Alperowitch, son of Israel de Kassaf (the butcher) and Chaja. My grandpa had 4 brothers and 2 sisters: Shmeron, Zundel, Yoshke, Abram David, Itkha and Chana. Israel de Kassaf Alperowitch (my g grandfather) was son of Abram David and Hassia. Chaja, my g grandmother was daughter of David and Chassy.\n\nI know there were a number of families Alperowitch at Kurenets, but I would like to know if you know this specific part of the family, and /or have any information about their fate.\n\nI thank you in advance\n\nBest Regards\n\nFernando Alperowitch\n\nSão Paulo, Brazil\n\nDear Fernando,\n\nI am so happy to hear from you. About a year ago I called your grandfather in Brazil to tell him about the site.\n\nI am in touch with the grandchildren of your great grandfather (Israel) brother; Yiza Michael who was murdered at a young age c 1910; Shimon Zimerman is the son of Zirel nee Alperovitch (first cousin of your grandfather)\n\nYou could read his story at http://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_zimmerman.html\n\nYehoash Alperovitch is the son of Liba, the sister of Shimon Zimermans' mother.\n\nYou could read his story at;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_ghetto.html\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_blockade.html\n\nI also talked to Zalman Alpert of Yeshiva University (New York) the son of Mendel (son of Chaim Yizhak the brother of your great grandfather; Israel)\n\nThere was another first cousin of your grandfather; Zalman.

All of a sudden, I smelled smoke. In panic, we leapt into the bushes, fearing that there were people nearby who might see us. Our eyes were searching, our ears were listening, and our minds wondered what the origin of this smoke could be. Could it be shepherds from the neighboring village that made a bonfire in the woods? Or maybe it was Jews who had escaped? All of a sudden, I saw a group of people, gathered a short distance from the road. It was Israel Alperovitz, our town's butcher, his wife Chaya, their son Yosil, and the wife of Zondil their other son. They must have heard us approaching, because they ran into the forest. I wanted to calm them down, but I knew it was dangerous to yell, so I waved my hands and gave them signals saying that they should lie on the ground. They recognized me, and lay down on the ground, sighing with relief. When we reached them, we asked them why they had chosen a rest place so near the road. Not only were they resting there, but they had started a bonfire that could easily reveal their whereabouts. Israel replied that they were afraid to enter the deep woods. The women asked desperately, \"What will happen to us? Who will be with us? Where will we go?\" I was very familiar with the surrounding area and I said, \"First we must go to the deeper woods, in the middle of the forest, as far as we can from the road. \" I was still full of energy, and eager to fight against our bitter fate. My senses were sharpened, and in my heart I had many ideas and thoughts about how to survive. But they looked so defeated. We walked towards the deeper woods for about an hour. When I thought that we were a good distance from the road, we sat down and built a small bonfire. Israel brought out from his bag his talit and tfilin, and said, \"Look, Yitzhak. God bless, I succeeded in taking this so that at least I will have a talit at the hour of my death.\" We sat on the ground and Israel told us how he was saved, and how he succeeded to leave town on the day of the slaughter: Early in the morning, he had walked to the minyan to pray. He made his way through the empty lots amongst the homes in the alley. While he was walking, he ran into some Jews who told him that the Germans had come into the town and were kidnapping Jews. Immediately, he ran home and led his family to their hiding place under the floor, where they sat the entire day. At night they abandoned their hiding place, and walked to Poken village, to the home of the gentile Kashtzook, who was extremely gracious. He took them under his wing, gave them a loaf of bread, and walked with them all the way to the forest. Israel was a very religious Jew. He didn't touch the bread. All he ate were the potatoes he had baked in the fire. Around three in the afternoon, a young village girl who looked about seventeen, came from the woods. When she saw us, she waved as if she was giving us a signal, and then she ran away. We still don't know how to explain the signal. A few minutes later there was a barrage of gunshots that seemed to come from the side of the road. We stomped the fire out, destroyed any signs of our having been there, and ran into the woods. I ran first, and everyone else was behind me. We ran for five kilometers, until we found a niche hidden between two small hills, where we lay until darkness came. Where Are We Going? We were three families traveling together. The Rugbin family, Israel Alperovitz family, and my family. We all wondered where exactly we were. The children were lying quietly, saying nothing. They were not a burden. It was as if they understood that we were in a world of horrible occurrences, and that they had to be responsible and acclimate themselves to the situation. We were thirsty and hungry. I estimated that we were somewhere near the village Hob. I remembered that near the village there was a little river, named Maentenna. From my estimation, we were also about three kilometers from the village Stidiyonka. The villagers from Stidiyonka were known as very cruel gentiles. So where should we go, to Hob or to Stidiyonka? In Hob I also knew there were many isolated farm houses, and that lessened the danger, so we chose to go to Hob. We held hands as we walked so that we wouldn't get lost in the darkness. It was the middle of the night by the time we reached the river. We didn't have any cups or anything else we could drink from, so we all fell to the ground and drank directly from the river. From there, we walked through the fields and headed towards the first farm we encountered. There was no light in the house. When we knocked, the farmer asked, \"Who is there?\" I answered, \"Itzka from Kurenitz, the son of Netka from Shvashzapole\". He knew me before the war. He approached the window and gave me half a loaf of bread and some onions. We went on, to another farm, and there they also gave us half a loaf. We took some vegetables from the garden, as well as a big gourd that was next to one of the fences, and with all these supplies we returned to the women and children that were waiting at the edge of the river. It was getting very late. We didnt have a watch, but we knew it was after midnight. We entered the woods, but couldn't find our original spot. For three hours we roamed around. All of a sudden Israel said, \"My dears, I have no energy to continue. I'll stay here.\" He was much more tired than the rest of us because he didn't eat the bread, so we stopped and lay down on the ground, bundling up with each other. When we woke up, it was already light. A plane flew over the woods, and the sound was unbearable. We realized that today was Rosh Hashanah. Israel put on the talit, stood next to a tree and prayed. He announced that we must pray for all of our townspeople. When he said this, we all started to cry, and we couldn't console ourselves. This was the first big cry after fifteen horrible months. We cried for all that had occurred to us. As the sunset, we continued our journey. We walked towards the village Tzavolitkes. When we were about three hundred meters from the village, we met with more of the towns surviving Jews. To my surprise, my sister Rivka with her husband and children, my brother Hilka with his wife, and the daughter of my other brother were among them. I never imagined that anyone of my family survived. They, in turn, had never imagined that I had survived. They lived on Mydell Street, at the spot where the murderers started the killing spree. Once again, we stood there crying, and then continued our journey. Now we had twenty-seven people among our ranks. We entered the village. It was clear to us that as Jews, we belonged to the night. The night, from now on, would be our day. The gentiles didn't dare leave their homes at night. They feared the dark. In this village, we got some bread and onions. That night, we rested in an area between the villages Varoniyatz and Tsavolitzkes, in the middle of the forest. The night was cold, the forest was very dry, and we were dying of thirst. We squeezed plants and sucked their juices. All of sudden, Rogovin remembered that in one of the farms there was a villager that owed him some money for a sewing machine he had bought. We searched for the house of this gentile, and he gave us bread and a pail of milk. We went to him before nighttime. He refused to .....\n\nMachum Alperovitz wrote....\n\nOn those days of horrors, the Jews of the town were not allowed to have contact with each other, so we don't even know the extent of rebelling, particularly in the cases of families who did not survived. However, even the little that we know makes me feel deep respect for my townspeople. Another tale I must tell is that of Israel Alperovich.\n\nIsrael was a deeply religious Jew. When he escaped with his family to the woods, he continued keeping Kosher. He starved for many days but did not allow himself to eat the bread and other food brought from the villagers, fearing that the food was not kosher. Israel only ate potatoes that he baked in the fire and, eventually, he died of starvation. I see much heroism in his deed: he never lost his spiritual essence and his deep beliefs. When I compare his final journey to the journey of the many thousands of Russian POW's who while passing trough our town fought each other to get to food that was thrown to them, I can particularly respect him.\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/stories_n_alperovich.html\n\nNachum Alperovich: Chapters from the Underground\n\nIsrael story;\n\n-\n\nWWI Civilian Draft Registrations\n\nName Birth Date Ethnicity Birth Place City/County State\n\nPhilip Alper 1890 W Kurenitz Vilna Russia NYC (Manhatta# 138 NY\n\nReuben Alper 20 Feb 1895 W Dolhinow Vilna Russia NYC (Manhatta# 161 NY Jacob Alper 1 Sep 1886 W Wileka Wilna Russia NYC (Manhatta# 161 NY\n\nMorris Alper 24 Sep 1895 W Wilayka Vilna Russia NYC (Manhatta# 161 NY\n\nSolomon Joseph Alper 23 Apr 1888 W Vilna Vilna Russia Birmingham# 3\n\nAL Bernard Alperowitz 16 Jun 1893 W Vileka Vileka Russia NYC (Bronx)# 11 NY Alex Alperowitz 20 Dec 1895 W Wilna Schwentzen__ Russ.
