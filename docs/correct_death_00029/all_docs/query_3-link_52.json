        "text": "Monocacy Aqueduct\n\nDescribed by historians as one of the finest canal structures in the nation, the Monocacy Aqueduct is constructed primarily of large granite blocks that came from nearby Sugarloaf Mountain. Construction began on the historic structure in 1828 and completed in 1850, making what is still the largest aqueduct over the C&O Canal. Today, crossing the aqueduct is part of the C&O Canal Towpath and is a popular spot for bicyclists and hikers.
