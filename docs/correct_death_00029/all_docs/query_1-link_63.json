Crumb Memorial Library houses SUNY Potsdam’s main book collections, as well as research resources, faculty offices and the College Archives. Located on the second floor of the Lougheed Learning Commons, the Crumb Library is named for the longest-serving president in College history.\n\nDr. Crumb was the eighth, and longest-serving, president of the institution known today as The State University of New York at Potsdam. He joined Potsdam State Teachers College in 1946, which became part of the new SUNY System upon its founding two years later, and Dr. Crumb oversaw the construction of the new campus on Pierrepont Avenue.\n\nDuring his 21 years leading the College, Dr. Crumb paid special attention to building the institution’s library collections, from 8,000 texts when he arrived, to more than 110,000 volumes at the time of his death. The College therefore named its newly built library complex in his honor, upon its opening in 1967. Learn about Dr. Crumb’s legacy through this online exhibit created by students in conjunction with the College’s bicentennial.\n\n“The years you have spent here have seen our college, and the great university of which it is a part, keep pace with the growth and prosperity which has blessed our whole country. Our people, stronger and richer than ever, are determined as never before that their children shall have the best possible education. It is in a sense a tribute to your skill and scholarship that the people of this state have given freely of their wealth to build a new home for this college. And our proud new campus is built not of brick and mortar alone, but of the fidelity to truth of the thousands who have gone before you into the service of children. All they ask of you, and all we ask of you, is that same fidelity.”\n\n– Dr. Frederick W. Crumb, letter to Potsdam State graduates, 1953"
