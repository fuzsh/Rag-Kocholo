        "text": "Jennifer Aniston is celebrating her friend! The 51-year-old actress took to her Instagram Story on Tuesday to send Courteney Cox some belated birthday wishes. The actress turned 56 on Monday.\n\nIn the first of four posts, Aniston shared a pic of a smiling Cox, writing, \"Happy birthday to this amazing human.\"\n\nA pic of the ladies spending time together came next, as did one of Cox making a silly face. Aniston even apologized for being a day late in marking the occasion.\n\nThe last shot was a throwback from the women's time starring on Friends, on which Aniston played Rachel Green and Cox played Monica Geller.\n\nOn Cox's actual birthday, her other Friends co-star, Lisa Kudrow, shared photos of her and Cox snuggling with two dogs.\n\n\"Happy birthday @courteneycoxofficial,\" Kudrow captioned her post. \"My genius generous gorgeous grounded great good FRIEND I love you\"\n\nCox herself celebrated getting another year older by sporting a black bikini and diving into a pool with a giggle.\n\n\"Gracefully diving into this next year... #oaf,\" she captioned the clip.\n\nWatch the video below for more on Cox's birthday celebration."
