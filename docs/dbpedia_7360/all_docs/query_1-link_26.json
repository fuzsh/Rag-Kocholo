        "text": "Courteney Cox played the skinny and motherly Monica on the super-popular sitcom Friends from 1994-2004. The blue-eyed brunette dropped out of Mount Vernon College for Women in 1983 to sign with the Ford modeling agency, and soon had a splashy cameo in the music video for the Bruce Springsteen single Dancing in the Dark (she's the girl Springsteen pulls onstage to dance). Courteney Cox also had a recurring role as a girlfriend to Alex Keaton (Michael J. Fox) on the show Family Ties. In 1994 she joined the founding cast of Friends, which ran for 10 seasons and made stars out of Cox, Jennifer Aniston and their four co-stars. Cox also was a hit as the harpy reporter Gale Weathers in the Scream series of horror films (Scream in 1996, Scream 2 in 1997 and Scream 3 in 2000). She has kept busy mainly on TV, howeer, playing a gossip magazine editor in the TV series Dirt (2007-08) and then, starting in 2009, playing an aggressive 40-something divorcee in Cougar Town. Her other films include 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001 with Kevin Costner) and The Longest Yard (2005, with Adam Sandler)."
