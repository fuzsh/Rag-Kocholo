        "text": "Courteney Cox’s 20th birthday tribute to her daughter Coco includes showing how time truly flies, and how much her daughter has changed already!\n\nOn June 13, Cox shared a series of photos with the caption reading, “Happy birthday to my beautiful, sweet, kind, sensitive and creative Coco. You never cease to make me laugh. I love you sooooo much co to the lo. ♥️♥️♥️”\n\nIn the photos, we see Courtney and Coco in the present time, with their same smiles and long dark hair. Then, we get adorable throwback photos of Coco, starting with her as a blondie kid with cucumbers on her eyes, then her even blonder at the beach, and her as a pre-teen making a funny face (and with much darker hair).\n\nAs you can see, Coco has changed so much over the years, going back and forth between dark brown and blonde!\n\nFor those who don’t know, the Shining Vale star and her ex-husband David Arquette welcomed their daughter Coco in June 2004.\n\nIn a previous, dual interview with Courteney and Coco for Courteney’s previous docu-series 9 Months on Facebook, Coco asked her mom to describe her as a child in a single sentence. “Absolutely adorable, curious, incredible sense of humor, and quirky,” Cox said. And in another part of the interview, Cox revealed the three words to describe her pregnancy to Coco, with Coco asking: “Describe your pregnancy journey with me in three words.” Courteney said, “Exciting, emotional, great.”\n\nHappy belated birthday Coco!"
