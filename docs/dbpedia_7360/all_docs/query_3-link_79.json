        "text": "Courteney Cox has quite literally dived into the next year of her life, with Friends pal Jennifer Aniston sharing the love for the star on her 56th birthday.\n\nThe Monica Geller actress, who truly doesn’t look like she’s aged in years, cracked up fans as she shared a slow-mo video of herself not so gracefully diving into a pool to the soundtrack of New Radicals’ You Get What You Give.\n\n‘Gracefully diving into this next year… #oaf,’ she wrote in the caption.\n\nWith fans and friends wishing her a happy birthday, Jennifer shared a string of sweet photos and messages for her former co-star.\n\n‘Happy birthday to this amazing human,’ she wrote next to a gorgeous snap of Courteney, adding one of the pair of them and writing: ‘I love you, C.C.’\n\n‘Sorry I’m late,’ she pointed out, next to a photo of Courteney looking less than impressed, and finishing up her messages with a Friends throwback (what else?!) and adding: ‘The end.’\n\nJen’s not the only Friends star to be sharing the love for Courteney, with Lisa Kudrow sharing a string of snaps of the actress.\n\n‘Happy birthday @courteneycoxofficial my genius generous gorgeous grounded great good FRIEND I love you,’ the Phoebe Buffay actress wrote.\n\nName us a better trio, we dare you.\n\nElsewhere, the likes of Isla Fisher, Octavia Spencer, and Kate Hudson wished Courteney a happy birthday.\n\nAnd the star’s birthday comes just a day after her daughter Coco’s, with the teenager turning 16 this week.\n\nThe Friends actress shared a sweet throwback clip of a young Coco whizzing around an ice rink to celebrate the occasion, writing: ‘Happy sweet 16th Cocolo. You’re my little quirk of the universe. I love you ♥️♥️♥️’.\n\nCourteney is isolating with Coco in Los Angeles, while her boyfriend, Snow Patrol musician Johnny McDaid, quarantines in London.\n\nThe mother-daughter duo have been occupying their time by binge-watching Friends and belting out Demi Lovato covers.\n\nThe Cougar Town actress recently played the piano while Coco sang away to Demi’s hit Anyone in a video, putting us all to shame with their talent.\n\nWe wouldn’t have expected anything else from them, tbh.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : The Salisbury Poisonings pays tribute to Dawn Sturgess in heartbreaking final episode"
