        "text": "Courteney Bass Cox is an American actress who got her start in the public eye as a model with Ford Modeling Agency.\n\nCox was born on June 15, 1964 in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nAfter high school Courteney studied architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College for Women. She stayed for a year before dropping out to model and study acting.\n\nIn 1984, she appeared in Bruce Springsteenâ€™s music video \"Dancing in the Dark\".\n\nEarly film and television roles in Cocoon, Family Ties and Seinfeld sustained the actress until her most well known role as Monica Gellar on the hit sitcom Friends, which made its entire cast household names.\n\nFriends ran for ten seasons and all of the principal cast members received Emmys for their work on the show except Cox.\n\nDuring her years on Friends, Cox played the role of Gale Weathers in the highly popular Scream trilogy. It was on the set of Scream that Cox met her husband, David Arquette.\n\nArquette and Cox were married in 1999 and had a daughter, Coco, in 2004."
