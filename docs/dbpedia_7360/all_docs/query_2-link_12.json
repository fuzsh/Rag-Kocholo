In this two-part Season Three premiere, Jessica's search for a relative, long believed dead, leads her to the circus and murder under the big top.\n\nMy Last Words\n\nWhile J.D. and Turk are psyched about their annual \"Steak Night\" festivities, they prioritize giving comfort to a dying patient and spend the evening by his side; the new Chief of Medicine continues to make things tough for everyone at Sacred Heart."
