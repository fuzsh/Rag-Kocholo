        "text": "More than 15 years after the series finale of \"Friends,\" the cast is still there for each other.\n\nCourteney Cox celebrated her 55th birthday on Saturday the best way we can think of: with her old sitcom co-stars, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow.\n\n\"How lucky am I to celebrate my birthday with these two???\" Cox captioned an Instagram post. \"I love you girls. So much ♥️\"\n\nKudrow later posted a goofy selfie of herself and Cox with a filter set to look like they both had mascara running down their cheeks.\n\n\"Just remembering Court, I will ALWAYS be older than you,\" she wrote.\n\nCox's response: \"Only wiser my sweet. Never older. I love you.\"\n\nAwww, Pheebs!\n\nLast week, Aniston opened up to Ellen DeGeneres about the possibility of a \"Friends\" reunion. The actress said she's changed her mind about getting the cast back together onscreen, though nothing is planned for the \"immediate future.\"\n\n\"Well, ‘no’ was getting me nowhere, ‘maybe’ was getting me nowhere. So, I don’t know, I thought I’d try ‘yes.’ See what happened,\" she said, adding that “anything can happen.”\n\nAniston continued: \"The girls would do it and the boys would do it, I’m sure.\"\n\n'I'll be there for you': Courteney Cox would 'do anything' to act with the former 'Friends' cast"
