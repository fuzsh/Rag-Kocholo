        "text": "BIRTHDAY STAR: Actor Courteney Cox was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on this date in 1964. This birthday star portrayed Monica Geller on “Friends” from 1994-2004. She also played Pat Phelps on “Shining Vale” and Jules Cobb on “Cougar Town” as well as appearing on episodes of “Modern Family,” “Shameless,” and “Drunk History.” Cox’ film portfolio includes roles in “Scream,” “Mothers & Daughters,” and “Bedtime Stories.”\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): It may be surprising to learn that you could be admired and cherished for your genuine and charming disposition. You might place the emphasis on sensibility whenever sensitivity makes you feel out of your depth in social activities.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Don’t jump to conclusions or give in to delusions. You may be supported with lasting friendships and could be met with an unexpected romantic proposition if single. Embrace fun and lighthearted social gatherings that may arise.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Being a good friend may have benefits as well as drawbacks. You might become a safe space for someone to share their problems or worries. Having the positive belief that everything can work out better than you expected could serve you well.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Give in to the urge to take a brief time out to take a breather. Consider finding a peaceful place to study in solitude and you might be able to put the pieces of a puzzle together. Don’t let a misunderstanding turn a happy partnership into a battleground.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Pleasant surroundings could raise your spirits and soothe everyday stresses. Break out a favorite self-care ritural to invite more peace and tranquility. Wash away your cares to enhance your charisma to others.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Home might be where the heart is, but you can extend your inner circle outside of the four walls. Consider cultivating friendships with people who share your philosophy, and they could become a lasting and positive influence in your life.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): A partner or loved one could be charming but unpredictable. Consider keeping the lines of communication open by being fair and non-judgmental and you may earn more than your fair share of goodwill and appreciation.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Indulge your senses, enjoy creature comforts, and treat yourself to the absolute best. You may feel called to buy yourself a new outfit or go out for lunch with friends. You deserve to celebrate having an abundance of resources or time.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Even the oldest dog can learn some new tricks if there is enough incentive. If your desire is powerful enough you could succeed at whatever you attempt. Consider learning all you can about a subject before you take action.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Maybe you feel out of place in a group gathering, or family get together, but that can be okay if you need space. If single, someone may be willing to make a long-term commitment, but you might not be sure that is what you want.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Life may be complicated, and love may be as well. To get along with other people you sometimes could benefit from a simple smile. You may know how to gracefully navigate social interactions and keep things running smoothly.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): You may try to be more sensitive to the delicate feelings of someone who admires you. Your favorite person might yearn for adventure and to escape from the mundane tasks of everyday life but doesn’t know how to express it.\n\nIF JUNE 15 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: You may possess loads of energy and enthusiasm so might get more accomplished during the next four to five weeks. However, even the most thought-out plans may be derailed by fantasies and wishful thinking. Don’t be distracted by hopes and dreams in July. In August you may have ample energy to use in constructive activities and might become more of a self-starter with plans that require your full and undivided attention. Because you are passionate about getting results you might burn the midnight oil to achieve your aims and possibly get closer to making significant progress. A transitional period that may span September and early October could be both challenging and exhilarating. Consider embracing unusual ideas and welcome new people into your life, who could uplift your spirits and may help you achieve your dreams.\n\n_______\n\nGet a free personal astrology calendar: https://bit.ly/FreeAstroCal Use code FreeAstroCalendar See best & worst days here: https://bit.ly/BWDays\n\n©2024 Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
