        "text": "She’s still got it.\n\nCourteney Cox re-created her dance moves from the 1984 music video for Bruce Springsteen’s hit song “Dancing in the Dark.”\n\nCox, 59, did the impromptu performance for a new TikTok trend and shared a clip of it on social media on Sunday.\n\nIn the video, the “Friends” alum is wearing a blue sweater and jeans as she awkwardly dances to “Smalltown Boy” by Bronski Beat.\n\nThe words, “Asking my mom how she danced in the 80’s,” pop up on the screen.\n\nThen, Cox suddenly rips off her sweater to reveal a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band T-shirt, as she enthusiastically dances to “Dancing in the Dark.”\n\nThe video also cuts to a clip of Cox and Springsteen, now 74, dancing onstage in the music video that came out 40 years ago.\n\n“1980’s dancing…in the dark,” Cox captioned the clip.\n\nFans were obsessed with Cox revisiting her past and praised her 2024 dance moves.\n\n“Welp. Now this trend can end. Courteney wins!” one person commented.\n\n“This is genius! And you’ve still got the moves,” another person said.\n\n“Claim to fame classic indeed,” a different fan wrote.\n\nSome of Cox’s celebrity friends commented as well, including Jennifer Garner who said, “You win!”\n\nCox was 20 years old when she was cast in the “Dancing in the Dark” music video directed by Brian De Palma. She was pulled out of the crowd to dance on stage with Springsteen on the opening night of his “Born in the USA” tour in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\n\nShe looked back on the audition process in 2022 during an interview on “The Howard Stern Show.”\n\n“I thought I was in the wrong place. I was like, ‘I don’t know what they’re doing, but I can’t even bend my leg. This is it,’ ” she said. “I went into Brian De Palma’s office. He put on the music and said, ‘Well, you dance.’ And I thought, ‘Right now? Here? In front of you? Just the two of us?’ “\n\nIn 2017, Cox said in an interview with Off Camera that the music video “got me in the door to so many places,” even though she didn’t want to be the person picked by Springsteen to go onstage.\n\n“I didn’t want to dance in front of 30,000 people. It was a full concert, and we did the song twice, back to back,” she recalled.\n\nAfter the music video came out, Cox landed several guest roles on television before she was cast as Monica Geller in “Friends,” which premiered in 1994 and shot her to worldwide fame."
