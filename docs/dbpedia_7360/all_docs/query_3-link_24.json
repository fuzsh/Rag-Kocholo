        "text": "Jennifer Aniston is still there for Courteney Cox.\n\nThe \"Morning Show\" actress shared a sweet tribute Saturday to her \"Friends\" co-star in honor of Cox's 60th birthday. Aniston, 55, posted a slideshow of photos of the two together on Instagram, which ended with a screenshot of them blowing each other kisses on a FaceTime call.\n\nIn a heartfelt caption, Aniston described Cox as \"powerful, magical, mystical, interesting, interested\" and \"ferociously talented.\"\n\n\"She's funny like no other, STUNNING on the inside and out,\" the actress wrote. \"Independent in the most gorgeous way, cares for everyone even if she doesn’t know you. Terrified of dogs even though I've never known her NOT to have at least two of them. Fiercely loyal to the end. She'll redecorate a room like nobody’s business. Spot a smudge on a window from a mile (literally) away. She doesn't care what other people think!!\"\n\nAniston concluded that she \"can't imagine a world without her,\" and \"it's one of my great honors to call her one of my best friends for life.\"\n\nIn the comments, Cox wrote that Aniston's birthday tribute left her \"in tears.\"\n\n\"That's the sweetest thing I've ever read,\" she commented. \"I love you so much.\"\n\n'Don't make me cry': Jennifer Aniston tears up discussing 'Friends' 30th anniversary\n\nIn February, Cox shared her own tribute to Aniston in honor of the actress' birthday.\n\n\"Happy Birthday my sweet Jenny Louise,\" she wrote. \"Also don’t know why I call her that … but I sure do love you.\"\n\nAniston and Lisa Kudrow both reunited with Cox last year when the \"Scream\" star was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In a speech at the time, Aniston called Cox, who played Monica Geller on \"Friends,\" a \"good human\" and an \"extraordinary friend.\"\n\n'Friends' reunion: Courteney Cox joined by Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow for Walk of Fame star ceremony\n\n\"From the beginning when we met her, she was immediately inclusive, warm, loving (and) interested in everything about you,\" she said.\n\nKudrow, meanwhile, credited Cox with the fact that the \"Friends\" cast became \"one of the closest, most loving and supportive casts in the history of television,\" and Cox thanked her \"beautiful friends\" for being there for her at the ceremony.\n\n\"It's so nice that you came out and showed up for me in public the way you do so often in private,\" she said. \"I love you.\"\n\nCox got nostalgic on social media ahead of her 60th birthday by re-creating her dance from Bruce Springsteen's 1984 \"Dancing in the Dark\" music video.\n\n\"1980's dancing … in the dark,\" she captioned her TikTok.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra, USA TODAY"
