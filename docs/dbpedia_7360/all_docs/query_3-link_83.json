        "text": "It looks like Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston have taken the Friends theme song lyrics to heart all these years, because they're still there for each other — even through milestone birthdays! Jennifer celebrated turning the big 5-0 with a star-studded shindig this past weekend, and Courteney couldn't resist giving her on- and offscreen pal an adorable shout-out on social media.\n\nMonica Geller — er, I mean Courteney — shared a radiant selfie with her former costar, writing, \"The world definitely got brighter the day this girl was born.\" Ain't that the truth! She added, \"Happy birthday sweetheart! I Love you!\" Needless to say, Friends fans flooded the comments with plenty of heart emoji and calls for a reboot of the popular sitcom. *Sigh* If only! Now, please excuse me while I binge-watch all the Thanksgiving episodes of Friends and frame this photo in honor of Jen's 50th."
