Donto requested the court to appoint an independent administrator to manage his mother's fortune rather than his stepdad. A California judge ruled in favour of Artis becoming— he became the conservator and took $350,000 to care for Etta's bills and other expenses.

We actually worked things out the day before Momma died. I think she would have been very happy.
