The release comes via Morgan|Husband|Feraud, the talented trio comprising James Morgan on guitar, Gary Husband on drums/synth/pianos, and Hadrien Feraud on bass. Guest artists include saxophonist Eric Marienthal and percussionist Joey De Leon. The EP is another stellar addition to James Morgan’s discography, following last year’s captivating Ghost Jazz Trio Groovin Smooth album.\n\nThe EP consistently unveils a range of quality songwriting, co-written and arranged by James Morgan and Dean Brown (to whom the EP title track is dedicated). “On the Edge” opens the EP with evident charisma, melding expressive guitar lines with steady rhythmic smoothness. Reverberating, soaring guitars inject around mid-point, pairing with dexterous rhythmic flair for a gripping ascent. “A Feather’s Touch” follows with vibrant piano work, while Eric Marienthal’s saxophone shines on the subsequent title track; its enveloping, emotive character meshes with tasteful piano for a lounge-friendly contemplation.\n\nEP closer “Samba Sky” fuses thunderous guitar progressions with dynamic percussion, featuring Joey De Leon. Resonating guitars, tropical-friendly keys, and brisk percussive pulses come together with riveting entrancement. A Soul in Time is a compelling display of talented musicianship and memorable songwriting.\n\nMorgan|Husband|Feraud A Soul in Time by Morgan Husband Feraud\n\n—"
