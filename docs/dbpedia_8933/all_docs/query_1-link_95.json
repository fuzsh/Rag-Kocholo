        "text": "James Martin may front his own show on primetime TV each, but the celebrity chef prefers to keep out of the spotlight when it comes to his personal life.\n\nThe ITV presenter has been in a relationship with his long-term girlfriend Louise Davies since 2011, but has no plans to propose or start a family. Find out everything you need to know about James below...\n\nWhen asked about plans to walk down the aisle, James told the Sunday People in 2019: \"No, it doesn't interest me in the slightest, mainly because I've catered for so many weddings, really.\n\n\"I admire people who do it, that's fine, but I'm quite happy. I don't need to spend 60 grand on a day, no, I'm more than happy thanks.\"\n\nThe 50-year-old explained that he prefers to spend his hard-earned cash on his hobbies and interests, namely his car collection which includes a Chevrolet Corvette, a Lotus 340R, a 1948 Maserati and two retired Formula One motors.\n\nDON'T MISS: Why this year will be James Martin's most ambitious one to date\n\n\"My mates come round to my house and they look into my garage and I go, 'These are my babies, these are my things,' but you know, it's each to their own, isn't it?\" he said.\n\nJames and Louise have been dating since 2011\n\nJames also revealed that he and his long-term partner Louise are not planning a family, with the celebrity chef instead preferring to focus on work. James met TV producer Louise when he participated in Celebrity Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in 2010.\n\nWhile the chef didn't win big on the competition, he did catch the eye of the TV producer and the pair have been dating since 2011. The couple tend to keep a low profile, with James rarely speaking about his girlfriend in public or sharing photos of her on social media.\n\nJames admitted he is not planning a family\n\nDespite focusing on his job, James admitted that he is cutting back his workload. He decided to quit his presenting role on Saturday Kitchen in 2017 after witnessing a man fall to his sudden death.\n\nThe traumatic incident forced him to reassess his work-life balance, with James explaining: \"I was doing a gig abroad and I was chatting to a gentleman the same age as me with a similar work ethic, really keen on work. He went on stage literally five minutes after I spoke to him to do an awards ceremony and he died before he hit the floor.\"\n\nSEE: Celebrity chefs' stunning homes: John Torode, Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver and more\n\nThe presenter, who was speaking on Loose Women, continued: \"Just all of us were in total shock, and I got back on the plane and thought, 'Now I'm going to re-address the balance.'\" The star also said that he is back cooking in his restaurant, something that he \"loves\"."
