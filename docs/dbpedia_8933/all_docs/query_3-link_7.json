        "text": "Pippa Middleton and her husband, James Matthews, have remained out of the royal spotlight in recent years. While Pippa has been a star on the royals scene since her sister Kate married Prince William, James has a less prominent public profile.\n\nHere's everything we know about the dad of three.\n\nHe married Pippa in 2017.\n\nPippa and James were married on May 20, 2017 in an intimate ceremony at St. Mark’s Church in Englefield.\n\nJames works in finance.\n\nAccording to the International Business Times, James is the chief executive of Eden Rock Capital Management Group, a hedge fund that he launched more than 20 years ago. He named the group after his father's Eden Rock hotel in St Barths.\n\nHis net worth is a bit of a mystery.\n\nFollowing his engagement to Pippa, news sources approximated his total value to be upwards of two billion pounds—but there has never been an official confirmation of that number.\n\nLike Pippa, he's a sports enthusiast.\n\nPippa Middleton and James Matthews at Wimbledon in 2017.\n\nThe duo has taken part in athletic events from Norway's Birkebeiner, the world's largest ski race, to Otilo, Sweden's 47-mile swim/run competition and are often seen in the stands at Wimbledon.\n\nHe's a few years older than Pippa.\n\nWhile it's hardly a May-December romance, James has nearly a decade on his wife: He is 46 and Pippa is 38. Reportedly, the pair had been dating for less than a year when James popped the question, but they had a previous relationship in 2012.\n\nThe couple attended Wimbledon for Men’s Semi Final Day on July 12, 2018, just a few months after announcing their pregnancy.\n\nPippa and James now have three children: Arthur Michael William Matthews, born October 2018, Grace Elizabeth Jane Matthews born March 2021, and Rose Matthews, born July 2022.\n\nHis family is in the hotel business.\n\nHotel Eden Rock\n\nHis parents, David and Jane Matthews, own the luxurious Eden Rock Hotel in St. Barths, where James and Pippa have vacationed. A self-made millionaire, James's father has also held jobs ranging from race car driver to door-to-door salesman. His mother is an artist.\n\nHe owns Bucklebury Farm Park.\n\nBucklebury Farm Park is a farm and petting zoo in Berkshire, and as of April 2024, it's open to book as a wedding venue, or an event space for birthday parties, corporate retreats, and more.\n\nSpencer Matthews, his brother, is a reality star.\n\nSpencer Matthews kisses wife Vogue Williams in August 2019.\n\nJames isn't the only Matthews brother in the public eye. His brother Spencer has starred in several reality shows including, Made in Chelsea, which followed wealthy British twentysomethings and the British version of The Bachelor. He also briefly appeared on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.\n\nNever one to shy away from the spotlight, Spencer has made headlines in the past for , and his past relationships before marrying model Vogue Williams in 2018. The couple welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Theodore, that year.\n\nThey welcomed a daughter in July 2020, and another son in April 2022.\n\nJames's older brother Matthew died tragically at 22 after becoming the youngest British person to summit Mount Everest's legendary peak. James and his family established the Michael Matthews Foundation in his honor, a charity organization that promotes education by building schools in remote areas. James also has a half-sister named Nina, who keeps a low profile.\n\nHe was just a few years ahead of Prince William at Eton College, but he never attended university.\n\nWhen it comes to dating, Pippa and Kate have at least one thing in common: they prefer Eton men. Both William and James attended the famous British boys' boarding school. James skipped higher education to train as a trader at Spear Leeds & Kellogg, which became part of Goldman Sachs.\n\nHe is beloved by his in-laws.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge released a statement after news of Jame and Pippa's engagement broke saying they were \"absolutely delighted.\""
