        "text": "FOLLOWING her split from Curtis Buchanan, Christina Ricci moved on with James Heerdegen.\n\nThe Wednesday actress went on to wed the latter, and their marriage lasted nine years.\n\nWho is Christina Ricci's ex-husband, James Heerdegen?\n\nOn October 26, 2013, Christina Ricci tied the knot with her first husband, James Heerdegen.\n\nChristina and James held their wedding at Harold Pratt House & Peterson Hall in New York City.\n\nSimilar to the former, the latter also works in entertainment.\n\nHe is a cinematographer and dolly grip, meaning a production crew member responsible for moving the camera dolly.\n\nHe has also worked in the camera and electrical department for many films and TV shows.\n\nJames' credits include Birdman, Elementary, Captain Phillips, Sex and the City, and Men in Black 3.\n\nOn August 8, 2014, it was announced Christina gave birth to her first and only child with James; a baby boy named Freddie.\n\nWhile discussing motherhood and her first marriage, the Emmy Award nominee told The Edit via Vanity Fair: \"I'm a completely different person than I was before I had my child.\n\n\"Marriage shows you your flaws in how you deal with things, and having a child forces you to grow up at the speed of light.\"\n\nHow did Christina meet James?\n\nIn 2011, Christina and James first crossed paths on the set of ABC's Pan Am.\n\nThe former was the co-lead of the now-defunct series, while the latter was a camera technician.\n\nBy February 2012, Christina and James were confirmed to be dating.\n\nBy February 2013, it was revealed the two were engaged.\n\nWhy did Christina and James divorce?\n\nOn July 2, 2020, Christina filed for divorce from James and attributed their split to irreconcilable differences.\n\nChristina filed the motion the day after she was granted an emergency protective order against James.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, she was granted a restraining order against him.\n\nThe legal documents specified he was to stay 100 yards away from her and was granted no visitation rights to their son.\n\nAccording to the filing, the Yellowjackets star was subjected to years of physical and mental abuse.\n\n\"I feared for my life and the life of our son,\" she said in the documents.\n\nJames denied all of Christina's allegations and tried to file a restraining order of his own against her, the attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the former couple's divorce was finalized."
