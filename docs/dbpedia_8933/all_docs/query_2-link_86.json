        "text": "Barbra Streisand confessed it wasn’t exactly love at first sight when she and her husband of 23 years, James Brolin, were set up on a blind date.\n\nThe music icon revealed to Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night’s episode of The Tonight Show that it’s actually surprising she and Brolin ever went on a second date considering the first thing she said to him was a smart remark about his new haircut. “I expected a guy with a brown beard and brown, wavy hair, like a mountain man,” she explained. “And I saw a guy that had all his hair cut off, no beard, and I walked by him. I put my hand through his hair and said, ‘Who fucked up your hair?’” She added that while her husband told her “he knew [right away]” that she was the one based on that comment, Streisand was a little more hesitant, saying it “took me a few days.”\n\nShe went on to explain, “We were set up as a blind date, and I was so shy that I came into the house and I went downstairs to be with the children and play with them until I had to sit down at the table.” Brolin has three children from his two prior marriages. Eventually, however, Streisand warmed up to the actor and the pair married in 1998. The singer was also previously married to actor Elliott Gould for eight years with whom she shares one child, Jason Gould.\n\nIn an interview with The Talk from June, Brolin said that all this time together during the pandemic has actually made their relationship stronger than ever. “I like women who say their peace, and I’m a calming factor, and she gets me up and doing things I wouldn’t normally accomplish. It’s like a perfect situation, the two of us,” the actor told co-host Sheryl Underwood. “We, for a long time, were put out by COVID. And a lot of people, their marriages haven’t gone well during these 15 months. We’ve literally fallen in love over this period of time, just being stuck together every day and making it work.” He added, “Neither one of us have ever gone out the door [after] an argument and we are good at talking things out. And 23 years is better than ever, I must say.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
