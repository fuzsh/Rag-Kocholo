        "text": "GOOD Morning America's James Longman has revealed a major life update with his husband Alex Brannan.\n\nThe 36-year-old foreign correspondent for ABC News posted a cheerful photo of him and his significant other over the weekend - celebrating their marriage.\n\nLongman captioned his post: \"Mr and Mr (celebration emoji) Small disclaimer: this was just the legal bit.\n\n\"Just thought it would be romantic to come back from Ukraine and make it official.\n\n\"Big fun wedding next year for all our family and friends.\"\n\nThe pair made their marriage official at the Old Marylebone Town Hall in London on Sunday.\n\nIn response to the exciting news, 20/20 co-anchor Amy Robach commented: \"Yesssss!!!!! This makes me so happy - congratulations you two beautiful people.\"\n\nA second commenter wrote: \"Beyond happy for both of you. May you two continue to blow the gates open even wider for the rest of the world, through your work and your love.\"\n\nBrannan also took to his Instagram page to share the news with the same image.\n\nHe playfully captioned his post: \"Don’t worry guys, I made him sign a prenup.\"\n\nOne Twitter user commented: \"You don't know me but I'm so happy for you guys.\n\n\"Congratulations! May you find happiness in each other and grow old together. Cherish one another. I can only dream of having what you have.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Congratulations!! Now that you put a ring on it- he’s got to stay home with you and out of harm’s way!\"\n\nTheir heartwarming marriage comes as Longman has been working in Ukraine to report on the war with Russia.\n\nThe pair got engaged in June 2020 and Longman posted a video of the touching moment.\n\nHe captioned the post: \"We're engaged.\n\n\"I asked Alex in the garden while his mum filmed, trying to stop his nephew from running over to us.\n\n\"And then the rest of the family came over. There was quite a lot of crying.\""
