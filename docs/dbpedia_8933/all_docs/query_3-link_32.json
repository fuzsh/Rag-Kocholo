These forms must be filled out in person.\n\nGetting Married in New York State is also available in Portable Document Format (PDF, 172KB, 2pg.)\n\nThe Marriage License\n\nNote:\n\nThe following is general information. Please contact the clerk where you plan to purchase the license for specific requirements, office hours and further information.\n\nWhere do you get a marriage license?\n\nA couple who intends to be married in New York State must apply in person for a marriage license to any town or city clerk in the state. The application for a license must be signed by both applicants in the presence of the town or city clerk. A representative cannot apply for the license on behalf of the applicant. This applies even if the representative has been given a Power of Attorney.\n\nNotarized marriage license affidavits signed by the applicants cannot be substituted for their personal appearance.\n\nIs there a waiting period?\n\nYes. Although the marriage license is issued immediately, the marriage ceremony may not take place within 24 hours from the exact time that the license was issued.\n\nThe 24-hour waiting period may be waived by a judge or justice of the Supreme Court of New York State or the county judge of the county in which either party to be married resides.\n\nHow long is the license valid?\n\nA marriage license is valid for 60 calendar days, beginning the day after it is issued. If a party to the marriage is active U.S. military, the solemnization period may be extended to 180 calendar days. The applicant must provide proof to the issuing clerk at the time of application.\n\nHow much does the license cost?\n\nIf the marriage license is issued by a town or city clerk in New York State outside of New York City, it costs $40. This fee includes the issuance of a Certificate of Marriage Registration. This certificate is automatically sent by the issuing clerk to the applicants within 15 calendar days after the completed license is returned by the officiant (person who performs the marriage ceremony). It serves as notice that a record of the marriage is on file. Couples who do not receive a Certificate of Marriage Registration within four weeks of the wedding should contact the town or city clerk who issued the license.\n\nIf the license is to be issued by the City Clerk of the City of New York, please contact the New York City Clerk's Office for current fees and requirements. The City Clerk's Office can be reached at (212) NEW-YORK or via its website at New York City Marriage Bureau.\n\nIs a premarital physical exam required?\n\nNo premarital examination or blood test is required to obtain a marriage license in New York State.\n\nWho can get married?\n\nAge Requirements\n\nMarriages of minors under eighteen years of age is prohibited. If either applicant is under 18 years of age, a marriage license cannot be issued.\n\nProof of Age and Identity\n\nBoth parties are required to present to the clerk documentary proof of age. Possible documents include those listed below. Contact the clerk's office where you plan to purchase your license to find out what they require.\n\nA certified copy of a birth record,\n\na certification of birth issued by the state department of health, a local registrar of vital statistics or other public officer charged with similar duties by the laws of any other state, territory or country,\n\na baptismal record,\n\na passport,\n\nan automobile driver's license,\n\nany government or school issued identification card that contains a photograph of the applicant,\n\na life insurance policy,\n\nan employment certificate,\n\na school record,\n\nan immigration record,\n\na naturalization record,\n\na court record or any other document or record issued by a governmental entity, showing the date of birth.\n\nFamilial Restrictions\n\nA marriage may not take place in New York State between an ancestor and descendant, siblings (full or half blood), an uncle and niece or nephew or an aunt and niece or nephew, regardless of whether or not these persons are legitimate or illegitimate offspring.\n\nPrevious Marriages\n\nInformation regarding previous marriages must be furnished in the application for a marriage license. This includes whether the former spouse or spouses are living, and whether the applicants are divorced and, if so, when, where and against whom the divorce or divorces were granted. A certified copy of the Decree of Divorce or a Certificate of Dissolution of Marriage may be required by the clerk issuing the marriage license.\n\nName Change Options\n\nEvery person has the right to adopt any name by which he or she wishes to be known simply by using that name consistently and without intent to defraud. A person's last name (surname) does not automatically change upon marriage, and neither party to the marriage is required to change his or her last name. Parties to a marriage need not take the same last name.\n\nOne or both parties to a marriage may elect to change the surname by which he or she wishes to be known after the marriage by entering the new name in the appropriate space provided on the marriage license. The new name must consist of one of the following options:\n\nthe surname of the other spouse;\n\nany former surname of either spouse;\n\na name combining into a single surname all or a segment of the premarriage surname or any former surname of each spouse;\n\na combination name separated by a hyphen or a space, provided that each part of such combination surname is the premarriage surname, or any former surname, of each of the spouses.\n\nOne or both parties to a marriage may elect to change the middle name by which he or she wishes to be known after the marriage by entering the new name in the appropriate space provided on the marriage license. The new middle name must consist of one of the following options:\n\nthe current surname of the spouse electing to change his or her name;\n\nany former surname of the spouse electing to change his or her name;\n\nthe surname of the other spouse.\n\nThe use of this option will provide a record of your change of name. The marriage certificate, containing the new name, if any, is proof that the use of the new name, or the retention of the former name, is lawful. The local Social Security Administration office should be contacted so that its records and your social security identification card reflect the name change. There is no charge for this service.\n\nTo change the name on your NYS driver license or non-driver identification, contact the Department of Motor Vehicles for information.\n\nWhether you decide to use or not use this option at the time of your marriage license application, you still have the right to adopt a different name through usage at some future date. However, your marriage license cannot be changed to record a surname you decide to use after your marriage.\n\nIf you plan to use your married name at work, be sure to have your name changed in Social Security records. This way, you will get credit for all your earnings. It's easy and it's absolutely free. Contact any Social Security office. You can find the address and phone number of your local Social Security Office at http://www.ssa.gov.
