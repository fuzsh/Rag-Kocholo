        "text": "Savannah James has carved her own path amid the worldwide fame of her husband LeBron James. This year, Savannah kicked off her new podcast, \"Everybody's Crazy\" -- and it quickly became a hit, solidifying her position as a force to be reckoned with in media.\n\nIt's been a busy few months for Savannah aside from podcasting. Recording of \"Everybody's Crazy\" episodes has been put on a brief pause, as LeBron is with the United States men's national basketball team at the Summer Olympic Games in Paris while the couple's eldest son, Bronny, prepares to enter the NBA this fall as one of his dad's Los Angeles Lakers teammates. Fans have been on the edge of their seats, wondering if the hugely-popular podcast will return soon with new episodes -- and now, they have their answer.\n\n\"Everybody's Crazy\" and everybody wants season two\n\nIn an Instagram reel published on Saturday, Savannah revealed that \"Everybody's Crazy\" -- which she co-hosts with April McDaniel -- will return with new episodes on Aug. 6. She has teased the new season as \"even crazier,\" which might take some doing as the unique call-in show has already received rave reviews and significant attention."
