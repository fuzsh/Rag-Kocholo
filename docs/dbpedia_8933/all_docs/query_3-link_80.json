        "text": "Christina Hall and her soon-to-be ex-husband, Josh Hall, seemed to have a picture-perfect romance—until July 15, when both Josh and Christina filed for divorce.\n\nWhat happened to quash the HGTV’s third marriage? The former couple both cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split.\n\nBack when her relationship with Josh was still in bloom, Christina explained on Instagram that she and Josh had been dating in strict privacy for “several months” before she went public with their relationship in July 2021.\n\n“I met Josh when I wasn’t in a state of fear or fight-or-flight. … I had taken time off social, hired a spiritual coach, and smoked a Bufo toad (which basically reset my brain and kicked out years of anxiety in 15 mins),” Christina said on Instagram. “When we met this past spring, the synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore.”\n\nFact: Christina seems to dig romantic relationships with men in the real estate industry. Her first marriage to her “Flip or Flop” co-host, Tarek El Moussa, lasted over 10 years, and their TV series ended in 2022 after 10 seasons.\n\nJust in case you’re keeping track, Christina separated from her second husband, Ant Anstead, in September 2020, and their divorce became final in June. They had been married since December 2018.\n\nChristina and Josh, who tied the knot in September 2022, settled in a modern farmhouse on 23 acres in Franklin, TN. The southern suburb of Nashville was their home base while filming the first season of “Christina in the Country,” the countrified spinoff that chronicled the HGTV stars’ expansion of their business on the other side of the country.\n\nAlas, there will be no more series featuring the couple; as a lookback, here are a few surprising facts every HGTV fan should know about Josh Hall.\n\n1. He’s a real estate agent in Austin\n\nJosh is a real estate agent at Spyglass Realty, having relocated to Austin, TX, in 2017 “after visiting and falling in love with its beauty,” he explained in his bio. “I just could not leave without buying a home of my own in this little slice of heaven. I was actually born not too far from Austin, at Fort Hood Army base, where my father was stationed.”\n\nYet while his bio and contact information used to be proudly displayed on Spyglass, all that’s there now is his square-jawed headshot.\n\n2. He’s not a real estate snob"
