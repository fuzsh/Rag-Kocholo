The couple have been married since 2013 and are still head over heels crazy about each other. Keep reading to learn more about Jessie and Eric’s relationship.\n\nWho Is Eric Decker?\n\nEric was born and raised in Cold Springs, Minnesota. He was born on March 15, 1987, to his parents Tom and Sue. The former athlete continued his education in his home state, as he attended the University of Minnesota. Not only was he on the football team, but also played baseball as well. However, he stuck to football after being drafted by the Denver Broncos in 2010.\n\nWhen Did Jessie James Decker Meet Eric Decker?\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars alum met Eric in 2011 through mutual friends. “He was in Arizona training, and I got a text from my girlfriend who said, ‘I’m having dinner with this guy I’m seeing, and this other guy just showed up, and he’s stunning,’” Jessie revealed to Access Hollywood in 2013, who responded, “Show him a picture of me, and see if he’s into it.”\n\nEric liked what he saw and got Jessie’s number, initiating contact via text messages. But the singer made him work for their budding romance. “From now on, if a man wanted me, he was going to have to show it. So I made Eric chase me,” she confessed in her 2018 memoir, Just Jessie.\n\nWhen Did Jessie James Decker and Eric Decker Get Married?\n\nThe pair got engaged on April 1, 2012, after a year of dating. Jessie announced the news via Twitter and wrote, “We are blessed to have found each other and to have supporters like you all.”\n\nJessie and Eric married on June 22, 2013, at St. Francis of Assisi church in Castle Rock, Colorado, as Eric was playing for the Denver Broncos at the time and called the city home. After the intimate ceremony in front of their closest family and friends, the newlyweds celebrated their reception at Castle Cliff Estates. Jessie donned a stunning strapless Vera Wang “Hayley” gown, which viewers got to see her pick out on the couple’s E! reality show, Eric & Jessie: Game On, which premiered in September 2013.\n\nWhat Is Eric Decker’s Job?\n\nEric played in the NFL for eight seasons as a wide receiver. After the 2010 draft, he played for the Denver Broncos from the 2011 to 2013 season. He signed a five-year, $36.25 million deal with the New York Jets in March 2014. He was released by the team after only three seasons and went on to play for the Tennessee Titans under a one-year ,$3.85 million deal in 2017. Eric announced his retirement from the NFL in August 2018. He and Jessie starred on their E! reality show through 2017.\n\nThese days, Eric is on daddy duty. “He’s a stay-at-home dad now,” Jessie told Life & Style in 2019, gushing, “He’s amazing at it. I always am like, ‘What can’t you do?’ He’s so great at it, and he loves it.”\n\nWhat Is Eric Decker’s Net Worth?\n\nAs of 2022, Eric has a net worth of $20 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nDo Jessie James Decker and Eric Decker Have Kids?\n\nThe couple wasted no time in starting a family. Less than nine months after their wedding, Jessie and Eric welcomed their first child, daughter Vivianne Rose, on March 18, 2014. She was quickly followed by the pair’s first son, Eric Jr., on September 4, 2015. They became a family of five with the arrival of another son, Forrest, on March 31, 2018.\n\nIn August 2023, the couple proved they weren’t done adding to their family after they revealed they were expecting baby No. 4.\n\n“Good morning,” Jessie captioned an Instagram clip on August 22. In the clip, fans saw the “I Still Love You” singer walking onto a balcony with a white teacup.
