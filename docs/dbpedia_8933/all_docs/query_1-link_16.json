        "text": "Then again, when you hail from a family with as much money as the Rothschilds, it takes things to a whole new level.\n\nFor hotel heiress and erstwhile fashion designer Nicky Hilton – herself thought to be worth US$100 million according to Celebrity Net Worth – marrying into the Rothschild billions has only compounded her wealth.\n\nTogether, they’re very, very rich. But what do you do with so much cash?\n\nWhile they undoubtedly live in the lap of luxury, with the socialite Hilton still moving high fashion and Hollywood circles, Rothschild takes a much more low-key approach. He doesn’t have social media, rarely attends events, and has remained much more private about his lifestyle than his famous wife.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the handsome scion who hails from one of the world’s richest families:\n\nJames Rothschild was born into a very wealthy family\n\nBorn and raised in London, James Rothschild hails from one of the most famous European banking dynasties in history, with the Rothschild’s banking roots dating all the way back to the Napoleonic wars in the late 18th century. His parents are Amschel Rothschild, who died by suicide in 1996 according to the Independent, and Anita Patience Guinness, who hails from the Guinness dynasty (yes, the one famous for the Irish beer).\n\nHe is a financier\n\nAccording to his bio on Rockefeller Capital Management, Rothschild is a founder and managing partner of Tru Arrow Partners, “a global growth technology firm built around family capital”. He is also the co-founder of West Arrow, a New York based investment and advisory firm, according to the site.\n\nAs a result, he has worked in both London and New York over the course of his career.\n\nThe “trillion-dollar wedding” of the century at Kensington Palace\n\nPer the Evening Standard, the two lovebirds met at Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone’s marriage to James Stunt in 2011.\n\nHilton previously tied the knot with financier Todd Meister in 2004, whom she married in Las Vegas, but the marriage ended that same year.\n\nHe shares three children with Nicky Hilton\n\nThe couple have three kids together: two daughters – Theodora “Teddy” Marilyn, five, and Lily-Grace Victoria, seven – and a one-year-old baby boy who was born last July.\n\nAre the Rothschilds richer than the Hiltons?\n\nAlthough it’s difficult to determine the exact bank balance of anyone, it is without a doubt the Rothschilds that have accumulated the most money over successive generations. In fact the family remains one of the wealthiest in modern history."
