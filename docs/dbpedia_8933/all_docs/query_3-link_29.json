        "text": "#International_Snakebite_Awareness_Day Today 19th September! International snakebite awareness day. Let us take the pledge for an effective snakebite management. Snakebite Do's.. 1. Don't panic! - snakebite is a medical emergency that can be treated well at a hospital. 2. Stay calm and call for help, rush to the nearby hospital where Antisnake venom(ASV) is available. 3. Don't take more time to get done with firstaids.. note that every single minute values a life! 4. Keep the victim calm and watch for signs of envenomation during transport and brief it to the doctor while reaching the hospital. Don'ts on Snakebite: 1. Don't try to cut and bleed or try to suck at the bite site. 2. Please do not approch faith healers. 3. Do not take the victim to quack practitioners. *These may increase the complications and lead to death! Let's join hands and spread the awareness. Dr.N.S.Maanoj www.user.org.in\n\nAll efforts to stop the blood proved abortive. Bella was really injured from the accident. Her left knee was severely fractured by impact with the tarred road after she was knocked down by a reckless driver. The man's reckless driving was a lot to take, but Bella's injury needed urgent attention and we couldn't risk searching for the hit-and-run driver first. We were impatiently waiting for the Doctor... Little did we know that the real tragedy was even yet to happen. No, Bella didn't die. The awaited doctor arrived fully kitted and began to treat a slight bruise on Bella's forehead. Everyone but Dr X. was left in an unexplainable level of surprise. How come he skipped the badly injured knee, and focused on her forehead like it was all that mattered? A loud noise filled the ward when Dr X. began to remove his gloves in preparation to leave the ward. \"I'M FEELING THE PAINS ON MY KNEE & NOT MY HEAD!\" That was when we (including you) all realised that this story never happened. And it was just put together to show you how catastrophic it is when people fail to tackle the major pain of their audience. Your audience surely have the deep knee pains they suffer from. But if you don't research properly... You'll be carried away by the little bruise on their forehead (acclaimed pain) and think that's the real pain. What would the result be? FAILURE. But that can be avoided. Just make enough research about your audience and talk directly to their deepest pains. That way... They'll beg you to take their money in exchange for the solution. Stay Sharp.\n\nWhat can you do to help your heart? It’s a question we get a lot, and especially during American Heart Month in February. American Heart Month is a time to pay special attention to understanding, preventing, and treating heart disease - which, unfortunately, is still the number one killer of Americans. With that in mind, here’s a short list of heart-friendly activities you can try this month, and every month: * Engaging in at least 5 30-minute sessions of moderate physical activity per week * Reducing or outright ceasing your intake of cigarettes, cigars, or vaporizers * Maintaining healthy blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels * Finding ways to reduce stress and relax, like meditation We’d like to add one more: obtaining your CPR certification! Everyone has a heart, and learning how to save one is never a waste of time."
