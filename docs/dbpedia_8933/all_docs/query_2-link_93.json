        "text": "A Texas man who chopped his wife’s head off just months after they got married has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for the heinous crime.\n\nJared James Dicus’ trial concluded on Wednesday, more than a year after he decapitated his 21-year-old bride, Anggy Diaz, in their home near the town of Magnolia outside Houston.\n\nDicus, now 23, pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to four decades in prison with his earliest parole date not until 2043, ABC 13 reported.\n\nAuthorities found Diaz’s body in a pool of blood after she was stabbed multiple times in January 2023. Her severed head was discovered in the shower.\n\nThe pair had only tied the knot in October 2022, though the nuptials came as a surprise to friends and family.\n\nFollowing the slaying, Dicus confessed to murdering his spouse, the Waller County Sheriff’s Office said last year.\n\n“Waller County does not tolerate domestic violence. Heinous crimes like this one will not go unanswered,” Waller County District Attorney Sean Whittmore said in a statement last week, according to the station.\n\n“We will seek justice for the victims of domestic violence and send a message to the perpetrators that here, we fight for our victims.”\n\nThe plea agreement prevents Dicus from appealing the verdict and sentence. The pre-trial deal was also struck after Dicus was deemed competent for trial amid questions over his mental capacity.\n\nProsecutors also discussed the plea agreement with Diaz’s family before going forward with it, ABC 13 reported."
