You will see for yourselves at conference that our speakers have been selectively picked to ensure that we deliver the best CPD on the topics our delegates want to hear.\n\nJames, after graduating, spent 11 years in dairy practice which included an internship at Bristol university. In the last 12 years he has been doing dairy consultancy work mainly focusing on nutrition. His main research interest is milk fever prevention. James is a special lecturer at the university of Nottingham. At conference he will be delivering lectures on ‘Milk Fever’ and ‘pinchpoints in cow feeding’ among others.\n\nDavid Tisdall has 10 years of farm animal practice. He led the transformation change towards more responsible antimicrobial use on farms, achieving more than a 90% reduction in the use of critically important antimicrobials alongside improving herd health. David will be speaking on ‘understanding medicine use’, ‘transforming medicine use’ and ‘taking steps towards a proactive approach to managing bovine lameness at herd level’.\n\nFor more information on our speakers and the lecture topics that they will cover at conference click here"
