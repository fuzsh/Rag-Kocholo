        "text": "Keira Knightley and James Righton are serving up a good time.\n\nThe couple, who have often remained out of the public eye since their 2013 nuptials, stepped out for a day of tennis at Wimbledon July 10.\n\nFor the occasion, the Pirates of the Caribbean star, 39, kept with the event’s traditional clothing guidelines in a long white dress with a black bow at the shoulder. She accessorized the look with black-toed, nude heels, a white handbag and straw hat wrapped in a bow.\n\nFor his part, James, 40, wore a dapper brown suit complete with matching beige button-down and striped tie.\n\nThe pair—who share daughters Edie, 9, and Delilah, 4—both finished off their looks with sunglasses as they watched the men's quarter final match between Taylor Fritz and Lorenzo Musetti as well as Elena Rybakina and Barbora Krejcíková's victories in the women's tournament."
