Honestly, thank you to everyone.\"\n\nDeborah set up the fund during the final few weeks of her life while she was at her parents' house.\n\nReflecting on those heartbreaking weeks, her husband Sebastian said: \"It was just such a difficult time. It's hard to articulate just how hard it really was.\n\nHer husband added: \"I think she died in probably one of the best ways you could have hoped to die with this terrible disease.\n\n\"She died surrounded by her mother, her father, her sister, me, all of us holding her hands and being there for her.\n\n\"It was, as much as it can be, there was a peace to it as I think she had done everything she could have hoped to achieve.\"\n\nBBC Breakfast airs daily between 6am and 9.15am on BBC One."
