        "text": "Grace James (Karimah Westbrook) is a Main-Character in \"All American\". Grace is the mother of Spencer James and Dillon James. She is a Courthouse Clerk. Grace is the girlfriend of Micah Richards; as well as the ex-wife of the late Corey James; not to mention was romantically involved with Billy Baker -- whom she'd eventually have an affair with.\n\nGrace is a woman who's learned to do it all on her own. Raising two boys isn't easy, especially when you're the one keeping the dinners hot and the lights turned on. Sometimes it requires leaning on Spencer a little more than she'd like to admit, but that doesn't stop her from instilling how important a future is for both her children and remaining focused on letting nothing get in the way of that.\n\nSeason One[]\n\nSpencer is conflicted on whether or not to move to Beverly High but Spencer's mother, Grace, convinces Spencer it's an opportunity he has to seize. When Spencer is forced to move in with Billy and his family, these two families and their vastly different worlds are drawn together. They will discover that the differences that divide us on the surface hide a deeper connection - the complicated, imperfect humanity that unites us all.\n\nSpencer's worlds come together to celebrate his birthday in Beverly Hills. Billy finds himself forced to spend some quality time with Grace and defend his decision to marry outside of the culture.\n\nSpencer wants no parts of his father's return. Spencer learns the real reason his father left when he was growing up and is devastated by the truth.\n\nSeason Two[]\n\nGrace and Corey have a tough conversation regarding their family. It's Billy, Corey and Grace's 25th high school reunion which brings up a lot of memories and unfinished business.\n\nWith Spencer, Grace, Dillon and Darnell reeling from the news about why Corey may have left, they set out on a mission to find him. After locating Corey and trying to convince him to go home with them, the weekend turns out to be just what everyone needed.\n\nWith Spencer in bad shape, Grace, Billy, Laura, Olivia and Layla rush to his side. Knowing there is a big decision he needs to make, the community from both Crenshaw and Beverly Hills rally around him to show support. Billy and Grace are concerned that Spencer is going to push himself too hard before he is ready, which could make things worse for Spencer in the long run.\n\nSpencer is ready to get back to football in order to impress recruiters, but he must prove to Billy and Grace he is not pushing himself before he is ready."
