        "text": "JESSIE James Decker has mutual friends to thank for her NFL player husband Eric and their now family of six.\n\nBefore Eric met Jessie, he built a career as a professional football player.\n\nWho is Eric Decker?\n\nEric is from Cold Springs, Minnesota, and began his sports career playing college football and basketball at the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn 2010, he was drafted into the NFL by the Denver Broncos.\n\nSince then, he has played on four teams as a wide receiver: Denver Broncos, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and the Tennessee Titans.\n\nAfter playing with the Patriots, Eric retired from football in August 2018.\n\n\"To be honest, I was kind of emotionally and mentally checked out of football at that point,\" he said about ending his career.\n\nHow did Eric and Jessie meet?\n\nEric and Jessie began dating in 2011 after being introduced by mutual friends.\n\nJessie recalled the exchange to Access Hollywood in 2013 saying, “He was in Arizona training, and I got a text from my girlfriend who said, ‘I’m having dinner with this guy I’m seeing, and this other guy just showed up, and he’s stunning.’”\n\n“Show him a picture of me, and see if he’s into it.”\n\nAfter Eric initially reached out, the country singer changed her philosophy about dating, putting the ball in Eric's court.\n\n“From now on, if a man wanted me, he was going to have to show it,” she wrote in her 2018 memoir, Just Jessie. “So I made Eric chase me.”\n\nThe pair got engaged in 2012 and eventually tied the knot in Colorado in 2013.\n\nSince then, they have welcomed four children: Vivianne in 2014, Eric Jr. in 2015, Forrest in 2018, and Denver in 2024.\n\nWhat is the couple up to?\n\nEric Decker was spotted with his kids to cheer Jessie's Dancing with the Stars debut in September 2022, per People.\n\nAt the time, three of the couple's children joined the big event all dressed up to cheer their mom up.\n\n\"Good luck Mommy and Alan,\" said the children to the camera.\n\nOn February 9, 2024, Jessie and Eric announced that they welcomed thier fourth child.\n\nThey made the announcement in an Instagram post on Sunday, February 18, 2024.\n\nShe captioned her post: \"Our beautiful boy is here, Denver Calloway Decker.\"\n\nIn the first pic, Jesse was in her hospital bed holding her bundle of joy while Eric looked down at his newborn son."
