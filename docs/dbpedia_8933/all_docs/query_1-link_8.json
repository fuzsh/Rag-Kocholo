        "text": "James Corden has actor Dominic Cooper to thank for his marriage to wife Julia Carey.\n\nCooper first introduced The Late Late Show host to Carey in 2009, and the couple wed three years later. Today, Corden and Carey are proud parents to three children: son Max and daughters Carey and Charlotte.\n\nThough Carey, whom Corden affectionately calls Jules, often accompanies her husband to red carpet events and even royal weddings, she doesn't speak publicly about her life with the Into the Woods actor.\n\nIn April 2022, Corden announced his departure from The Late Late Show. A few months later, he opened up about his family's impact on the decision. \"My kids are getting older, their grandparents are getting older, and it perhaps just felt like the right time for us as a family to be freer in our decisions,\" said the Tony winner.\n\nCorden also made headlines in October 2022 when he was banned from N.Y.C. restaurant Balthazar due to alleged poor conduct in the establishment. In one account, owner Keith McNally said the TV host \"began yelling like crazy to the server\" after the kitchen messed up Carey's brunch order of an egg yolk omelet and salad (twice).\n\nCorden later spoke about the drama on The Late Late Show, explaining that Carey was given food \"she was allergic to\" after explaining her food allergies. When the order came back wrong a second time, Corden recalled, \"In the heat of the moment, I made a sarcastic rude comment about cooking it myself.\"\n\nMcNally said Corden \"apologized profusely\" over the phone and the restaurant owner rescinded the ban.\n\nSo, who is Corden's wife? Here's everything to know about Julia Carey and her relationship with the former late-night TV host.\n\nShe met Corden through another celebrity\n\nCorden's longtime friend and former roommate Cooper is responsible for Carey and Corden's first introduction. In 2009, Carey was working for the nonprofit Save the Children and Cooper asked Corden to attend one of the organization's events.\n\nAfter the Preacher star introduced the two, Corden became interested right away, he told PEOPLE's Jess Cagle in a 2018 episode of The Jess Cagle Interview.\n\n\"I said, 'Hi, Jules. You might be the most beautiful woman in the world,' \" he explained. \"She said, 'Well, thank you very much. That sounds like something you say a lot.' And I said, 'I've never said it before in my life.' That was it. That was it, really. I was in. And by an absolute miracle, so was she.\"\n\nShe planned her future with Corden the night they met\n\nWhat started as a joke became a reality when Carey and Cordenbegan planning their potential future together that same night.\n\n\"We sat and we very jokingly kind of planned the rest of our lives together an hour and a half after we met,\" the CBS host explained to PEOPLE. \"As a joke! We were just talking. And we were both talking about how much we felt like we were now past the notion of going out every night — that we had hit the age where the prospect of a quiet night in was glorious.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I remember saying to her, 'Well, what about on Friday? We could do nothing together. You could come over and we could just do nothing. And then maybe we could do nothing on the Saturday, and we could do nothing on the Sunday. And if our evenings are enough of nothing, then maybe this would become something.' And she said, 'That sounds like a fun idea.' \"\n\nThey bonded over staying in and skipped going out on dates\n\nDuring an August 2021 episode of The Late Late Show, Corden opened up further about meeting Carey for the first time and why they skipped going on dates entirely.\n\n\"Jules and I never went on dates,\" said Corden. \"The night we met, we talked about how we were both bored of going out all the time and that we were going out too much and we were drinking too much and having too good of a time.\"\n\nThe pair began dating soon after their initial meeting, but they were planning for the future from the very beginning: \"I was like, 'How many children are we going to have? Are we going to have a dog?' Joking around,\" he added. \"At the end of the night, we had a little sort of smooch in the back of a cab.\"\n\nCorden thanked her in his Tony acceptance speech\n\nBefore Corden hosted the Tony Awards, he won one. In 2012, he took home the award for best performance by a leading actor in a play for his role in One Man, Two Guvnors and gave his thanks to Carey on stage as they both teared up.\n\n\"My girlfriend, Julia, gave birth to our son five days before we started rehearsals. She is my baby mama and I can't wait to marry her,\" he told the audience. \"Seriously, I would not be holding this if it wasn't for her. She made me say 'us' instead of 'I' and 'we' instead of 'me,' and I love her. Thank you very much.\"\n\nShe married Corden in 2012 — and Matt Smith almost ruined their wedding day\n\nCorden proposed to Carey in December 2010. He gave thanks to fans via Twitter for sending their good wishes after news of their engagement broke, writing, \"Thanks so much for your kind messages. I feel very lucky indeed!\"\n\nThe couple tied the knot almost two years later. Their ceremony took place at Babington House in Somerset, England, on Sept. 15, 2012. Though all eyes should have been on the bride and groom, pal Matt Smith's drunken behavior was one of the day's most unforgettable moments.\n\nIn 2018, The Crown star joined his friend for an appearance on The Late Late Show where they reminisced about the evening, which left Smith with a scar on his chin from tripping on a staircase.\n\n\"I fell in a fire[place] twice … and then your dad put me in a car and was, like, 'Come on, Matt, son, it's time.' \"\n\nDespite Corden's dad doing his best to get Smith to go home, Smith admitted to escaping from the car and going back in for more fun at the party.\n\nShe is a mother of three\n\nThe couple have three children. Their son, Max McCartney Kimberley Corden, was born in March 2011 and was given his first middle name as a nod to Paul McCartney. He shares his second middle name, Kimberley, with his father.\n\nTheir daughter, Carey, was born in October 2014, just before the family relocated to the United States from London and before Corden started as the host of The Late Late Show. Carey, of course, has her mother's family name.\n\nIn December 2017, they welcomed daughter Charlotte to the family. Corden was scheduled to host his show on the night of her birth, but asked friend Harry Styles to fill in at the last minute. Bryan Cranston stepped up the following night while the couple spent time with their newborn.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles with Corden and their kids\n\nIn 2014, the couple moved from the U.K. to Los Angeles — just a few weeks after daughter Carey was born.\n\nThe TV host told Ross King during an appearance on ITV's Lorraine: \"All credit to my wife, who agreed to move when our daughter was 5 weeks old and our son was 3, and that is a massive thing, an undertaking.\"\n\nHowever, when Corden announced in April 2022 that he would be exiting The Late Late Show in 2023, he told Deadline that he and wife Carey \"genuinely don't know\" if they'll return to the U.K. from California.\n\n\"It's something we think about and we talk about a lot, but we haven't really made a decision on that yet,\" he added. \"That's the life side of things which we'll figure out.\"\n\nEventually, Corden and his family did decide to move back to England. During his last Carpool Karaoke segment, which aired on April 24, 2023, the father of three spoke to his guest, Adele, about leaving Los Angeles.\n\nIn the segment, when Adele asks what he'll miss most about hosting The Late Late Show, Corden talked about his friends on the show before calling his time in Los Angeles \"a brilliant adventure.\"\n\nStill, he said he's \"just so certain\" that \"it's time to go home.\"\n\nShe and Corden have attended the Met Gala nearly ten times\n\nCorden and Carey attended the Met Gala for the first time in 2016 — and Anna Wintour has invited the couple every year since."
