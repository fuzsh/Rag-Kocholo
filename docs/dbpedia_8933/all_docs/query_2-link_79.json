        "text": "NORWICH - Judith L. James, 70, passed away on August 3, 2024, with her family by her side. Judith was born in Oneonta to the late Rex and Virginia (Bouton) Parker. She was also predeceased by her husband, John James; her stepson, Jeff Aitken; and her granddaughter, Macie. Survivors include her current husband Robert Aitken, of Norwich; her sister JoAnn and Jerry Shultis, of Meredith; her nephews Michael and Samantha Shultis, along with their son Cameron, and Christopher and Kelly Shultis, along with their children Peyton and Maddox; her daughter in law Cassidy Aitken, along with her daughter, Harper; her sisters in law Vicki and Steve Goodyear, and Margie and Kevin Heannings; her brothers in law Tom and Jen Aitken, and Don and Sherry Aitken; the entire James family; as well as many dear friends.\n\nJudith worked for many years as a secretary for Dr. Frank in Norwich and later in the billing office of New York Central Mutual. She will be remembered as someone with a quick wit and a great sense of humor. As a young girl, she raised a horse named Champ and that began her lifelong love for her pets. She was also very talented with growing flowers around her property and was a loyal fan of the Cleveland Browns. She also enjoyed relaxing with a cold Genesee beer.\n\nJudith's family will receive friends 5-7 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 15 at R.J. Fahy Funeral Home, 116 N. Broad St., Norwich. Funeral services will take place privately at the convenience of her family. In lieu of flowers, donations in Judith's memory may be made to Chenango County SPCA, 6160 County Road 32, Norwich, NY 13815."
