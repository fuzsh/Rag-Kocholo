Married for 20 years. Happy anniversary honey.\"\n\nLooking back on the milestone on Entertainment Tonight, James Brolin said that his secret to a long-lasting marriage is couples therapy.\n\n\"I do believe in counselling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage,\" he said. \"Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time.\"\n\nJames's birthday comes just months after his wife brought the audience to tears at the SAG Awards.\n\nBarbra Streisand was awarded the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award at a ceremony on February 27, and made a rare public appearance to make the rousing speech.\n\nAfter reaching the podium to rousing applause, Barbra kicked off her speech with a comedic tone, saying: \"This is such a wonderful award to get, because you know in advance you're going to get it.\"\n\nBarbra Streisand and James Brolin's beautiful 25-year marriage: A relationship timeline\n\nBarbra Streisand facts: Singer's age, husband, children, net worth and more revealed\n\nBarbra Streisand confirms she has officially quit showbusiness: \"I want to live life\"\n\nBarbra Streisand handpicks lesser-heard classics for new Evergreens compilation\n\nPaying tribute to her Jewish predecessors who paved the way for her career to blossom and call an end to prejudice, Barbra detailed the magic of the movies as well as her \"first crush\" in Marlon Brando.\n\n\"That make-believe world was much more pleasant than anything I was experiencing. I didn't like reality,\" Streisand said.\n\n\"I wanted to be in the movies, even though I knew I didn't look like any of the other women on the screen. My mother said, 'You better learn to type,' but I didn't listen. And somehow, someway — thank you, God — it all came true.\"\n\n\"It's really a privilege to be part of this profession,\" she added. \"For a couple of hours, people consider the theatre to escape their own troubles. What an idea!\"\n\n\"Moving pictures on a screen. And I can't help but think back to the people who built this industry. Ironically, they were also escaping their own troubles.\"\n\nBarbra then went on to list the birth names of Jewish people who fled persecution in Eastern Europe and changed their names, which later laid the foundations of cinema as we know it today.\n\n\"They were all fleeing the prejudice they faced in Eastern Europe, simply because of their religion. And they were dreamers to like all of us here tonight. And now I dream of a world where such prejudice is a thing of the past,\" Streisand said."
