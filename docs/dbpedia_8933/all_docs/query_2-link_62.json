        "text": "April 8, 2024\n\nThis was my first time reading a book by Erica James and I think I'm in the minority in saying it wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nThe premise of the novel is the breakup of a forty year marriage and how the whole family deal with the emotions and inevitable change in dynamics this betrayal brings. Not only does Kip ask Louisa for a divorce on Boxing Day but announces that he's leaving Louisa for their son's ex girlfriend, Zoe.\n\nWith an opening like that I was expecting fireworks, however, for me this didn't happen. I think the story gets lost with too many POVs, and too many subplots. I would have liked more focus on Louisa and her journey from feeling secure in her marriage and home to having to sell up and start afresh on her own. But instead of the anger and grief you'd expect someone to feel during a marriage breakup, Louisa just seems to accept and forgive far too easily. She even helps Kip when he makes some horrendous decisions in his new relationship with Zoe. I found this unbelievable and unrealistic.\n\nThe ending of the book is saccharine and I feel its completely far fetched to have everything resolved in the space of just twelve months.\n\nThank you to Netgalley and HQ for providing me with a copy to read and review.\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\n2.5 rounded up.\n\nI really could not get over the artificial sweetness of this book. It did not reflect the reality of what would’ve been a monumental disaster for any family.\n\nThe adult children came across as pompous and entitled. Thank goodness for Caro but she only appears occasionally.\n\nAs for the ending - it makes Disney look cruel! Not my cup of tea at all.\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nSo disappointed in this one I always look forward to reading Erica's books but, this one just didn't hit the mark for me. Too much bickering between husband , wife and children which made this book depressing. Such a shame as I love her books usually. My thanks to netgalley and the publishers for giving me the opportunity to read this book in return for an honest review.\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\nWhen you reach for this book you can expect a captivating portrayal of the intricacies of family dynamics, love, and betrayal. At its heart, the novel delves into the aftermath of an unexpected revelation that shatters the seemingly idyllic life of the Langfords.\n\nLouisa and Kip Langford, a couple emblematic of enduring love and stability, find their world upended when Kip drops a bombshell on Louisa: their decades-long marriage is over. The aftermath of this declaration sends shockwaves through the family, leaving Louisa reeling and forced to confront a reality she never imagined. James navigates the emotional turmoil that follows such a revelation, delving deep into the psyche of her characters as they struggle with betrayal, heartbreak, and the prospect of starting anew.\n\nCentral to the narrative is the exploration of self-discovery amidst chaos. As Louisa navigates the aftermath of her shattered marriage, she embarks on a journey of introspection and reinvention. James paints an expressive picture of resilience as Louisa confronts the challenges of rebuilding her life and rediscovering her sense of identity in the wake of betrayal.\n\nThe novel also explores the complexities of love and desire, particularly as it pertains to age and societal expectations. Kip's infatuation with Zoe, his son's ex-girlfriend, serves as a catalyst for the unravelling of his marriage to Louisa. The author explores the intricacies of intergenerational relationships and the consequences of pursuing forbidden desires.\n\nWhat makes this book special is James' ability to craft multifaceted characters that resonate with authenticity. From Louisa's quiet strength to Kip's flawed vulnerability, each character is filled with depth, inviting you to empathize with their struggles and triumphs.\n\nThe prose is richly atmospheric, transporting you to the quaint English countryside where the Langfords' drama unfolds. Through vivid descriptions and evocative imagery, James creates a world that feels both familiar and immersive, drawing you deeper into the narrative with each turn of the page.\n\nThis is a compelling family drama that resonates on a deeply emotional level. With its gripping storyline, colourful characters, and evocative prose, Erica James has crafted a novel that explores the complexities of love, betrayal, and self-discovery with both sensitivity and depth.\n\nhttps://featzreviews.com/an-ideal-hus...\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\nI usually love Erica James novels but this one didn’t have the same appeal. I listened to it on Audiobooks and kept checking how much longer I had to listen to the perfect Ashley and Caro and sanctimonious Louisa before something exciting happened. It never did\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\nAn infuriating read with a sappy end where everything magically worked out. Any legitimate hurt or anger was swept away by other characters, and the cheating husband was forgiven by everyone and able to have his perfect family, including his self sacrificing ex wife who fixed the mess he made. I wish I’d stopped reading.\n\nAugust 16, 2024\n\nI enjoyed this gentle family drama. I thought that the female characters were the stronger ones and more attractive. I liked the setting which was local to me , good to read some familiar names.\n\nThe only parts which I did not enjoy were the ones on counselling which just felt too self indulgent.\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nWell what can I say, but one of those nice fluffy family ones I like\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nFirstly, I should say this is not my usual genre but I need a break from murder and psychological thrillers every now and again, so I chose to read this.\n\nLouisa and Kip are a couple who’ve been married for a very long time, they have three grown up kids, twins who are both married and have a daughter each and Angus the youngest. Kip announces on Boxing Day that he’s leaving Louisa for Angus’ ex-girlfriend. The book then follows the turmoil of the next year.\n\nI was invested in the story and did keep page turning but it was all a bit too much too quickly. Having been through a divorce myself, things can move quite quickly if you want them too and you can both be amicable but I’m not sure I would be as ‘saintly’ as Louisa if my husband had done to me what hers had done to, not just her, but her son as well. Maybe when everyone has plenty of money it makes a big difference? But the reality of divorce rarely leaves everyone satisfied, financially stable and on good terms with everyone within a year!\n\nHowever, having said that, I did enjoy the book even though I found myself rolling my eyes at how perfect everything turned out. It’s a light hearted read if you like family dramas/chic lit. I just wouldn’t be in a hurry to read another.\n\nMy thanks go to the author, the publishers and NetGalley for an advanced reader copy of this book.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nAs one would expect, this is very well written. There is a large cast of characters and we see the events through many different eyes.\n\nAfter thirty years of marriage, Kip tells his wife Louisa that he’s leaving her and setting up home with their son’s ex girlfriend. He does this at the most insensitive moment.\n\nThis was a great premise and one can only enjoy the fallout and the developments that ensue. I would have given this more stars but for Louisa who was almost ready for sainthood as she behaved so perfectly and unselfishly for most of the book. Sorry I just couldn’t buy into this sentimentalised view. The final scene at Christmas was just so over the top saccharine-sweet as to make me want to throw my book at the wall. It’s a tribute to the writer’s skill that I actually got so involved. An enjoyable read nonetheless.\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nI usually love Erica James but this was utterly unrealistic and actually it made me angry. To trivialise such a monumental initial betrayal and have it resolved so perfectly and leave a second betrayal completely forgotten- this isn’t real life and it’s actually offensive for those who have suffered similar situations and not managed to sit down for a perfect family Christmas together. Erica, what on earth? As for the brief journey into therapy- this was beyond a joke. So ludicrous it was painful! Erica where have you gone?! Who is this imposter?!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\nDidn’t really like some of the characters.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\nDid not disappoint. Super storytelling of everyday life. Couldn't stop reading, finished in 24 hours.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nSo, Joanna Trollope, take note, as this is how to write a good multi-generational book. I’m thinking of your last one ‘Mum and Dad’, which was so outdated.\n\nAnyway, I loved this book until the end when I found it too saccharine. How everything worked out for all was a bit unbelievable: Louisa was a saint who put up with too much from Kip, her ex and a right little piece of you know what; the adult children were fine and I especially liked Caro, the wise daughter in law.\n\nKip went off the rails when his new girlfriend Zoe became pregnant with twins. His daughter Arabella split up with her husband because he took his daughter by his first marriage’s side every time. Louisa got a new boyfriend. Kip came back to Zoe and they all become one happy family together\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nAn Ideal Husband is an uplifting family drama novel by Erica James.\n\nBlurb -\n\n💓The Langfords are a perfectly happy family. Louisa and Kip, happily married for nearly forty years, have raised their children and are now just settling into a new phase of life where they’ll have more time for themselves. Everything seems perfect. But then, one Boxing Day after a lovely family Christmas, Kip tells Louisa that their marriage is over. It’s not something Louisa saw coming. And what he tells her next is even more he’s fallen in love with their son’s ex-girlfriend, Zoe, the woman who broke Angus’ heart. So just like that, Louisa’s marriage is over… and her new life can begin. A gorgeous, gossipy family drama of a couple navigating a divorce, a woman on a journey of self-discovery, and an older man getting his just deserts.\n\n💖 Review -\n\nThis is the first book that I have read by the author and it definitely won't be the last. I couldn't put the book down. The author's writing is beautiful and easy to follow. I loved the story and the characters. I really enjoyed the novel and I would definitely read more by the author. I highly recommend it.\n\n💞 Thank you to HQ and the author, Erica James for my copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\nLouisa and Kip, have happily married for nearly forty years, have raised their three children and are now just settling in to live on their own and enjoying their grandchildren. When Kip drops the bombshell that he wants a divorce because he has met someone else. And it isn't just anyone, it is his Son Angus's ex girlfriend Zo.\n\nThe books deals with the strain that this brings on to the paternal relationship and the stress of Louisa trying to start over again. This is true family drama. Whilst the children are absolutely disgusted with their father, especially Angus. I found Louisas attitude to it all little bit unbelievable. She wasn't exactly devastated at the end of her 40 year marriage as I would be only having been married for half of that time.\n\nThis is the first time I have read a book by Erica James but I am sure it won't be the last. I didn't absolutely love the book but I did enjoy her writing style and character development. Especially Caro.\n\nThank you NetGalley and HQ Publishing for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\nMay 8, 2024\n\nDull heteronormative tale of a perfect wife, shit on by her previously perfect husband and the reactions of their perfect grownup kids. Cardboard characters drinking merlot, yawn\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nKip and Louisa Langford have been married for over forty years. They have three children, twins Arabella and Ashley, and Angus their youngest child, though all grown up and away from home. Christmas is always a special time at Charity Cottage when all the family, along with partners and grandchildren, descend. As usual Louisa is in domestic bliss, surrounded by her nearest and dearest. Come Boxing Day when the masses have departed, Louisa is brought down to earth with a massive bump when Kip asks for a divorce. The story follows the angst and anguish along with the trials and tribulations of a fractured family.\n\nTold from various points of view the reader comes to know and get the perspective from each character. However, due to so many POV there is a lot of repetition and I did skip a fair amount of pages, with no detriment to the plot.\n\nMy second Erica James book and IMO not as good as A Secret Garden Affair. I found this story to be overlong with an unbelievable ending. I appreciate that Louisa had a forgiving nature, but a halo must be winging its way to her!\n\nAn ok read, not to my taste but I understand the appeal and James’ many fans will love it.\n\nThank you NetGalley and HQ.\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nThe Langford family was torn apart when patriarch of the family, Kip, announces on Boxing Day that he wants a divorce from his wife Louisa. He is leaving her for his son's ex-girlfriend though they claim nothing ever happened between them while Zoe and Angus were still seeing each other. Though he was cheating on Louisa for several months prior to leaving her.\n\nKip is determined to the carefree life he feels like he's now entitled to but only a couple of months later he gets Zoe pregnant. This is not what he wanted and he ends up bailing on her then as he wonders if he made a mistake he starts to fall into a depression and suffers from panic attacks.\n\nThe novel doesn't really have any point to it but I like the way that each member of the family has their own POV so we get to see the whole picture from everyone's perspective. I enjoyed the story but I didn't love it for a couple of reasons, the conversations between family members often felt stilted and it wasn't written in a way that really flowed properly, and there was no end point to the story.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and HQ Stories for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.\n\nMarch 23, 2024\n\nI always look forward to a new book by Erica James as she has been a favourite author for many years and this new novel did not disappoint. It was an engrossing read which I found hard to put down.\n\nThe Langford family are thrown into turmoil on Boxing Day when Kip announces that after over 30 years of marriage, he is leaving his wife for a new life with a much younger woman. Louisa is then devastated even further when he arranges for the sale of their house with no prior warning. The book deals with the fallout from this event for Louisa and her three adult children.\n\nThe story is told through multiple POV and seeing things from differing points of view gives the story a lot of depth. It would be easy to see Kip and his new love as the villains of the piece but instead we feel a lot of sympathy for them as their situation unfolds. Erica James does a great job as usual of portraying real characters in realistic situations and there were certainly scenes that resonated with me. I particularly liked the character of Cleo who had a very down to earth view of things which didn’t always endear her to the rest of the family. As well as marriage breakdown, the book also takes a look at mental health and how we can have unrealistic expectations of ourselves which was interesting.\n\nLouisa’s character was the only slightly off note in the book as she seemed almost too good to be true and less believable than the others. She moved very quickly to acceptance of the situation after being treated shockingly by Kip. The ending was also a bit too ‘happy ever after’ for me even allowing for the fact that this is a novel and I expected it to have a positive conclusion.\n\nOverall though, this was an excellent read and Erica James remains an author whose books I look forward to reading. Thank you to Net Galley and the publishers, HQ, for allowing me to read this ARC in exchange for my honest review.\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nChristmas in the Langford household. Mum Louisa, Dad Kip, children Ashley, Arabella and Angus. Grandchildren Heidi and Peggy. Christmas Day went well, all happy and then – Boxing Day Kip told Louisa that he wanted a divorce. Louisa is in complete shock. Kip also tells her that he is in love with a lady called Zoe who happens to be the ex girlfriend of their son Angus and their children’s age. The family begins to fall apart. The family cannot understand how their father could do this after many years of marriage and find it hard to come to terms with Kip’s betrayal of their mother. Things get worse as divorce looms and the family home is sold. Louisa is devastated to lose the home where the children were brought up in but eventually realises that she has no choice but to “get on with it”. Once she starts house hunting Louisa finds a home she feels she can grow old in. Louisa’s life looks up but Kip realises that maybe his moving on was a mistake. The reason for this is that he misses his children who are so against his relationship with Zoe and to top everything off Zoe is pregnant. A spanner in the works of his so called care free life. The book continues quite rapidly and you wonder whether the family will ever gel again. Kip goes through dramas, has counselling and slowly realises life is good, his family are accepting and Louisa’s personality is such that she can encompass the new dynamic of life today. It helps, of course, that Si comes into her life. I enjoyed this book\n\nApril 28, 2024\n\nI really love the characters Erica James creates, and this is another wonderful example of a story that contains many threads and such different challenges faced by families.\n\nAt the heart of the story are Louisa and Kip who have been married for 40 years and seemingly happy, or so Louisa thought! Kip demands a divorce and has already moved onto a new relationship with a much younger woman, who just happens to be an ex of his own son!! Talk about make life complicated for yourself!\n\nSo we are left to witness the fall out and the impact that such a big change has on the whole family, as each character gets their own POV told. It's a book that really plays with your emotions as from the outset you expect to feel sympathy with Louisa and being inside her head you see all the insecurities play out as to why this is happening.\n\nWe also see the impact on each of the adult children, alongside going through their own challenges within their relationships and it really brings to light the blended family issues that can arise!\n\nIt's all about starting over, forgiveness and finding that good in a bad situation and I think each character gets that chance to put their perspectives across so that you can empathise and see just how complicated the emotions of a human can be! It would be very easy to stay bitter and seek revenge in such circumstances, but the storyline allows the characters to see how negative that could be for their own headspace! A really absorbing family drama read!\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nI thought that this book started off really well. Louisa and her husband Kip are happily married (or so it appears) and have three adult children. On Boxing Day, Kip drops the bombshell that he doesn’t love Louisa anymore and reveals that he is leaving her for his younger son’s ex-girlfriend. The aftermath of this decision throws the entire family into disarray.\n\nThe next few chapters are told from the perspective of different characters - as I read on, I noticed that I went from feeling sorry for Louisa because of her horrible husband's actions to feeling sorry for Kip because he just wanted to be happy. My own reactions intrigued me - I didn't know whose side I was on. I was really interested to read how Kip and Louisa were negotiating the breakdown of their marriage. However, things deteriorated a little after that. As the book continued, Louisa’s personality became more and more unbelievable to me. She is endlessly patient, reasonable and forgiving - it got to the point where I wondered just how badly a person would have to behave to actually make her reveal a character flaw.\n\nThe latter part of the book felt like as though it was rushing to tie up all the loose ends so I deducted one star for this and the improbability of Louisa's sainthood. This was my first time reading an Erica James novel and I will probably read more. I do like how she delves into the way in which marriage breakdown affects various family members and shows it from differing perspectives.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and HQ for an advance copy.\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nLouisa and her husband Kip have been married for forty years, they have three grown up children, twins Ashley and Arabella and youngest son, Angus, it's a happy marriage, or so she thought until Boxing Day when Pip declares he wants a divorce, the family home needs to be sold and he's been having an affair with Angus's ex girlfriend Zoe! Louisa's world comes crashing down around her and the fallout has far reaching consequences with the rest of the family too.\n\nAn Ideal Husband is the latest family drama by this author who knows how to bring characters to life through the pages of her books and this one is no exception. The story is told from all perspectives of the main characters; Louisa who feels she must be to blame for the split, Kip who is loving having the freedom to do as he pleases, their three children who are questioning what their childhood hero is thinking, and Zoe who believes she's found the man of her dreams, but nothing in life is ever that straightforward. This is a complex story with many layers which, when stripped back, revealed more in-depth reasons why Kip made the decisions he did and blew his family's world apart, I was Team Louisa all the way, except for how she handled the whole thing, the woman is a saint!! Another great read from this author that I definitely recommend.\n\nI'd like to thank HQ and Netgalley for inviting me to read this book, I will post my review on Goodreads now and Amazon on publication day.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nI really enjoyed this read.\n\nThis was the story of Louisa and her family. Louisa until recently was married to Kip, they had adult children. Twins, Ashley and Arabella, and Angus their youngest son. Louisa now finds herself having to sell the family home, Charity Cottage, because Kip declared on Boxing Day that he was in love with another woman, and he was leaving Louisa. They were to be divorced and it was a shock to Louisa as she had not expected anything wrong. What's worse is that Kip has left Louisa, for Angus's ex girlfriend, Zoe, who is much younger than Kip.\n\nTheir children don't want to have anything to do with their father right now, but the couple share grandchildren so she is aware that they will need to team up in some ways. Ashley is an estate agent and willing to help his mum to look for somewhere else to live but she can't face that at the moment.\n\nThe story that follows is one of the whole family, written easily to read in short chapters, and gives us an insight into how the family dealt with their father's betrayal of their mother. With dramas from all members of the family throughout, it made for a very interesting read. It was nice to read all the events that happened, and discovering if anybody actually got a happy ending. There were plenty of twists and turns in this story and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThis is my first book by Erica James but I would be keen to read more of her work.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nWhen Kip, Louisa's husband of 40 years, announces that not only does he want a divorce but that he has been having an affair with their youngest son's ex-girlfriend for months Louisa is shocked. She thought that they had a wonderful marriage and happy family. As the ramifications of Kip's announcement spread through the family Louisa and his three adult children question everything they thought they knew about a man they had all respected and what their family will look like in the future. As a year of upheaval progresses Louisa make reluctant peace with her new life and begins to plan a new future, the children navigate their own relationships with their parents. Meanwhile, Kip, carefree for the first time in his life is relishing his new relationship but reality is about to come bouncing in to burst his new romantic bubble.\n\nThis is a brilliant contemporary take on love, divorce, modern family dynamics and mental health all wrapped up in an easy to read to read, entertaining contemporary fiction. This is holiday reading for anyone who wants a bit of substance with their family drama and non-traditional happy ending. I liked that the family's relationships were not simplistic representations and each character got to tell their own story. I also liked that Kip's \"mid-life crisis\" was given context and space to develop beyond the \"older man / younger woman\" trope.\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nWonderful book.\n\nI've read a few of Erica James' early books quite a few years back, and loved them, so it was a real treat to get back to this author.\n\nLouisa Langford. She's doing something as normal as driving home from the farm shop at the beginning of the book. But what will be her story? What will happen?\n\nI like this: Normal, everyday things that many go through, so, even though it's fiction, it's totally believable. You can empathise with the characters, and get totally involved as events unfold.\n\nThis got off to a great start, and I was soon hooked. Lovely descriptions and scene-setting, also brilliant dialogue and discussions between the characters.\n\nSo quick, easy, and relaxing to read, I loved it. I liked how she wrote chapters from different characters' points of view, so you were able to see their side, see their reasonings; sympathise-it wasn't saying one character was in the right and another in the wrong. She perfectly captures the steps forward and back in dealing with and getting over a break up.\n\nPure reading joy. So accurate, so easy to glide through. About everyday scenarios lots of families encounter. You can identify with the characters, and lose yourself in their stories.\n\nLovely country village life, agas etc. friends, family, life's ups and downs.\n\nA wonderful book.\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nErica James is an old favourite of mine, so it’s a bit of a no brainer for me to choose her books! She has the ability to write interesting situations that seem very realistic with characters that have problems we all face. An Ideal Husband is no exception to this.\n\nWe follow several members of the same family; Louisa who’s been married to Kip for forty years, and their three children. At the start of the novel, Kip has put the family home on the market without telling Louisa who he’s left for another woman. The conflict between the couple and their children who have all taken their mother’s side is the main driver of the narrative. Louisa feels that she’s at fault for not noticing how her husband was struggling whilst he is enjoying his freedom. Their children, all adults, are shaken by how badly their father, their childhood hero has behaved.\n\nThere are ups and downs within the family as we track their first year since the break up and how they are all moving on/dealing with the fallout.\n\nWhilst these are not light topics, the novel is fast paced and enjoyable. I found it incredibly gripping and read it in two days. Erica James has not lost her touch and I was very pleased to spend time within this realistic world.\n\nThank you to netgalley, Erica James and the publisher for an advanced copy of this ebook in exchange for a review.\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nIf you are a fan of contemporary family saga, then An Ideal Husband is the novel for you.\n\nThe storyline revolves around the Langford family; parents Kip and Louisa, their adult children, Arabella, Ashley (with their respective partners and children), and Angus.\n\nFrom the opening pages, the Langford family are in crisis, as husband Kip has announced his intention to divorce his wife Louisa, and move in with his girlfriend, Zoe - who happens to be the ex-girlfriend of his youngest son Angus.\n\nWith multiple PoV, the reader is provided with an insight into the thoughts and emotions of each character, thus adding an extra element of depth and substance to the storyline. And helps to avoid the reader from automatically associating stereotypes with characters such as Kit. We were given the opportunity to learn about his \"side\", and emotions, rather than his simply being \"the cheating husband\". Mind you, I'm still Team Louisa!\n\nAn Ideal Husband is the story of a year within this complex family where family dynamics, love, health and divorce are all\n\nThis is a brilliant contemporary take on modern family dynamics as they encounter love, divorce and mental health issues. All wrapped up in a humorous and easy to read tale."
