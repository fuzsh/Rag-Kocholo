He’d never seemed unhappy – and they’ve raised three children together.\n\nFor months, Kip has been secretly seeing a younger woman – and if that wasn’t bad enough – it’s the woman who broke their youngest son’s heart.\n\nNow Kip is moving out and embarking on a new life with Zoe, and Louisa is left to pick up the pieces. Their beloved family home, Charity Cottage, is up for sale, and tensions are running high.\n\nYet, despite the betrayal and anger, when Louisa lays eyes on what might be a unique and welcoming new home, she feels a first glimmer of hope that life might be taking a turn for the better.\n\nAnd while Louisa is making exciting plans, Kip finds himself facing challenges of his own and begins to learn that living the dream may not be as simple as he thought…\n\nSunday Times bestseller Erica James returns with a sparkling tale of new starts and second chances.\n\nPraise for An Ideal Husband\n\n‘So, so good… shades of dark and light in every character which are gloriously done.
