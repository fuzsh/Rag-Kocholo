        "text": "What (and Who) Is Next of Kin?\n\nNext of kin refers to a person's closest living relative(s). Individuals who count as next of kin include those with a blood relation, such as children, or those with legal standing, such as spouses or adopted children. A person's next of kin often takes precedence over others in inheritance cases, especially when a will isn't established.\n\nUnderstanding Next of Kin\n\nNext of kin refers to individuals who share a relationship through blood, marriage, or adoption. This relationship helps establish who would receive a portion of a person's estate by the laws of descent and distribution if there is no will. In this context, the next of kin is the spouse.\n\nInheritance rights use the next of kin relationship for anyone who dies without a will and has no spouse or children. Surviving individuals may also have responsibilities during and after their relative's life. For example, the next of kin may need to make medical decisions if the person becomes incapacitated, or take responsibility for their funeral arrangements and financial affairs after their relative dies.\n\nA legally and properly executed will that covers inheritable property usually takes precedence over next of kin inheritance rights.\n\nIf the deceased person left no will, their estate passes to a surviving spouse in nearly all states. If the couple is divorced, postnuptial agreements may terminate or alter these rights. If a surviving spouse remarries, it generally does not affect their inheritance rights.\n\nIn the absence of a surviving spouse, the person who is next of kin inherits the estate. The line of inheritance begins with direct offspring, starting with their children, then their grandchildren, followed by any great-grandchildren, and so on.\n\nThe legal status of stepchildren and adopted children varies by jurisdiction. If the deceased had no offspring, the line of inheritance moves upward to their parents. If the parents are no longer alive, collateral heirs (brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews) are next in line.\n\nJurisdiction Over Next of Kin\n\nThe specifics of determining next of kin and inheritance vary by jurisdiction. Matters involving inheritance in certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, are handled in accordance with various succession laws. In other countries, next of kin laws are in place for settling the estates of people who die intestate.\n\nIn the United States, the right of a relative to inherit or receive property by inheritance exists through the operation of state laws and legislative action. State law establishes next of kin relationships and inheritance priorities.\n\nThe legislature of a state has plenary power, or complete authority, over the distribution of property within the state borders. The deceased's estate becomes state property if no legal heir is identified.\n\nWhat if someone dies in one state and owns assets in another? With personal property, the law of the state where the decedent resides generally supersedes the laws of other states.\n\nInsurance and Retirement Plans\n\nThe recipient(s) of proceeds from a decedent's life insurance policy, or their retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRA), are designated in a different way than other bequeathable assets. The funds from these instruments typically go to the beneficiaries listed by the decedent on these policies or the accounts themselves, even if the decedent designated different people in a will.\n\nNext of kin status is irrelevant unless the decedent was married and lived in a community property state. If so, by law, the surviving spouse is entitled to an equal portion of any funds earned or accrued during the marriage, unless the spouse had signed a waiver. If the spouse is also deceased, and there are no living listed beneficiaries, those assets may flow to the deceased's next of kin, depending on state law.\n\nCertain other rules apply to individuals who inherit retirement plan assets. Those rules have been modified following the passage of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act. Under the new law, IRA beneficiaries must cash out their inherited retirement account within 10 years. There are certain exceptions, such as for people who are chronically ill or disabled, and children under the age of 18.\n\nNext of Kin Responsibilities\n\nBeing designated as someone's next of kin carries significant legal responsibilities. One of the primary responsibilities of next of kin is to make decisions on behalf of the individual in case they become unable to make decisions for themselves. This could come up prior to that person's death, whether due to illness, injury, or incapacitation.\n\nThe next of kin can play a role in making serious healthcare decisions for the individual. This responsibility is particularly important when the individual is unable to communicate their wishes. Take a situation where someone is in a coma: the next of kin may be called upon to provide consent for medical treatments or end-of-life decisions.\n\nThe next of kin may also have legal responsibilities and authority. They may be tasked with handling the individual's assets, paying bills, and managing investments. This responsibility becomes much more prominent when there is no will.\n\nNext of Kin vs. Power of Attorney\n\nNext of kin and power of attorney are two distinct legal concepts that confer different roles for an individual. Next of kin typically serves as a default designation when there is no formal legal document specifying decision-making authority. On the other hand, a power of attorney is a legal document that grants one person authority to act on someone else's behalf.\n\nThe powers granted in a power of attorney can vary widely depending on the terms of the document. They often include managing financial affairs, making healthcare decisions, and conducting legal transactions. Note that the power of attorney documentation may be for specific actions. Being next of kin may designate a more broad, less defined set of responsibilities.\n\nAnother key difference between next of kin and power of attorney is the level of control and authority each confers. Being next of kin does not necessarily grant decision-making authority. You usually don't get this kind of power unless it's explicitly stated by law. A power of attorney, on the other hand, does grant explicit legal authority. It's a more formalized, enforceable way of designating responsibilities.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNext of kin refers to a person's closest living relative, such as children or a spouse.\n\nIn estate planning, next of kin is important in that next of kin typically takes precedence over any other individuals for an inheritance, usually when a will does not exist.\n\nEach country (and sometimes different jurisdictions within the country) have different inheritance rights. Most often, the spouse inherits the estate. If there is no spouse, then it is usually the children. If there are no children, the next of kin relationship continues to find the closest living relative."
