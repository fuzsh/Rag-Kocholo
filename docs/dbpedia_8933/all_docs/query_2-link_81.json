        "text": "LeBron James is eagerly awaiting the debut of his wife Savannah James' upcoming podcast, \"Everybody's Crazy.\" The announcement of the podcast's release date sparked excitement for the couple, adding another dynamic dimension to their already busy lives.\n\nSavannah James, stepping into the podcast arena alongside April McDaniels, promises a unique and offbeat experience for listeners. While LeBron's own podcast, \"Mind the Game,\" co-hosted with former NBA sharpshooter JJ Redick, delves into the intricacies of basketball, Savannah's podcast appears to explore a different realm, hinting at a more quirky and candid approach.\n\nWith the first episode set to drop on April 30, LeBron couldn't contain his enthusiasm, taking to Instagram to share his support for his wife's new venture. Reposting Savannah's announcement, he accompanied it with a caption that echoed his excitement for what's to come, showcasing the couple's unwavering support for each other's endeavors.\n\nThe teaser for \"Everybody's Crazy\" offered fans a glimpse into the podcast's unique format, inviting them to call in and engage in candid conversations with the hosts.\n\nCompeting in the NBA Playoffs\n\nWhile the James duo juggles their personal ventures, LeBron remains focused on his basketball responsibilities, particularly as the Los Angeles Lakers compete in the 2024 NBA Playoffs."
