        "text": "James \"Jim\" Matchinsky, age 85, passed away peacefully on July 27, 2024. A Memorial Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, September 14, at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Melrose with interment following in St. Patrick’s Cemetery. Military honors will be by the Melrose Veterans Honor Guard. A Rosary will be held at 4 pm with parish prayers at 6:30 pm September 13, followed by visitation until 7 pm, at the Patton-Schad Funeral Home in Melrose.\n\nBorn on May 11, 1939, in Melrose, Minnesota, Jim was a cherished husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend. He is survived by his loving wife of 61 years, Rose, his children, Michael (Jill), Ann (Kevin Costello), Wendy (Mark Ell), Karl, Gary (Susan), twelve grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, brother Alan (Karen), and sister-in-law Margaret (Bob). He was preceded in death by parents Frank (Bud) and Helen Matchinsky, brothers Robert and Richard, and sister-in-law Jace.\n\nJim was an avid entrepreneur and adventurous in all his professional endeavors. After graduating from Melrose High School, he proudly served in the U.S. Army where he was stationed in Germany studying and practicing in the medical field. He was honorably discharged in 1961 and married his high school sweetheart the following year. Careers as a pharmaceutical sales rep and a restaurant owner covered five states before his move back home to his beloved Melrose. Jim joined Melrose State Bank working in insurance and real estate until his entrepreneurial spirit took over and he and Rose bought the Hardware Hank store and a small hobby farm in Grey Eagle. He was active as a member of the Jaycees, the Chamber of Commerce, St. Mary’s choir, and much more. In 1981 Jim packed up the family and moved to Tempe, Arizona to start his final career in wholesale printing as an owner/operator of Business Cards Tomorrow. This evolved into three locations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, all of which are still in operation today.\n\nBeyond his professional life, Jim loved hunting, fishing, music, and entertaining. He passionately enjoyed all activities surrounding Birch Lake and the mountains of Arizona. There was nothing more important than his family as he looked forward to summers and holidays spent with his grandkids, extended family, and friends. Jim was a devout Catholic, deeply committed to his faith. He was a generous supporter of the Church, charities, and helping those in need. His kindness and philanthropy touched many lives and left a lasting impact on those around him.\n\nJim will be remembered for his remarkable life, filled with love, laughter, and faith. He leaves behind a rich legacy and his spirit will continue to inspire those who knew and loved him."
