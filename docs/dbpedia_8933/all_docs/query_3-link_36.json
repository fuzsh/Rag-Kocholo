        "text": "Jana Kramer found love across the pond.\n\nThe country music star first hinted that she was in a new relationship during a January 2023 episode of Whine Down with Jana Kramer, though she didn't mention Allan Russell's name at the time. Later that month, she made their relationship Instagram official.\n\nPrior to revealing the identity of her then-boyfriend, Kramer had vocalized her qualms about entering a new relationship. Among her concerns included long-distance and uncertainty.\n\n\"I don't know if this is my forever person,\" she explained on the podcast. \"But, like, I'm not going to push away love just because I've been hurt before. I'm going to embrace it. I'm going to have fun.\"\n\nAfter six-and-a-half months of dating, Russell proposed to Kramer. The couple wed in July 2024 after welcoming their first child together, a son named Roman James, in November 2023.\n\nRussell marks the singer's first public relationship since she and boyfriend Ian Schinelli split in April 2022. Kramer was also previously married to Mike Caussin from May 2015 to July 2021 when they finalized their divorce. She and Caussin share two children: daughter Jolie Rae and son Jace Joseph.\n\nHere's everything to know about Allan Russell.\n\nHe's a former soccer player from Scotland\n\nRussell was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland prior to starting his professional soccer career with Hamilton Academical in 1999. He played four years on the professional football club, making sixty league appearances within that period.\n\nThe former Scottish athlete spent several years playing for various premiere leagues across the UK — including St. Mirren, Macclesfield Town, Mansfield Town and Airdrie — before attracting interest from Scottish Premier League teams in 2008 and ultimately signing with Kilmarnock.\n\nWhen his contract expired, Russell took his international talents across the pond and signed with the American football league, the Carolina RailHawks, in July 2010. He repped the North Carolina team for one year before playing as both a defensive midfielder and a striker for California's Orange County Blues FC until 2014.\n\nHe's currently a soccer coach in England\n\nRussell took his soccer expertise from player to coach when he joined the England staff as a striker coach in March 2017. His work was particularly recognized and praised after an impressive goal during the team's matchup against Panama in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn April 2022, Russell returned to his native Scotland for a brief stint with Aberdeen Football Club before taking on the role of set-piece coach for Norwich City Football Club.\n\nHe met Kramer on a dating app\n\nIn September 2021, Kramer told PEOPLE that dating apps weren't for her. \"I literally hated it,\" she said at the time. However, the online match-making method seemed to work out for the singer because it's what led to her initial connection with Russell.\n\nAlthough admittedly skeptical at first, Kramer revealed on her Whine Down with Jana Kramer podcast that she'd give her international connect a shot. \"It just feels different,\" she on the Jan. 9 episode. \"Who I am in this relationship is who I've always wanted to be.\"\n\nHe posted with Kramer for the first time on Valentine's Day\n\nWhile Kramer made her relationship with Russell public in January 2023, the soccer player made his romance with the singer Instagram official a month later on Valentine's Day. He shared an adorable photo of him cuddling up to Kramer and their dog.\n\nRussell paired the heartwarming photo with a simple, yet sweet caption. \"Babe x,\" he wrote alongside a red heart.\n\nHe made his red carpet debut with Kramer at the iHeart Radio Music Awards\n\nTwo months after Kramer revealed she was in a new relationship, the singer made her red carpet debut with Russell at the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards in March.\n\n\"I'm happy. I'm in a great relationship. He's a wonderful man, and I've got amazing, healthy kids. I'm blessed. I feel very blessed,\" she told PEOPLE about her relationship with the soccer coach. \"I'm in a new chapter, and it feels really nice. For the first time I'm really embracing it, and I'm trying to sink in that I deserve this new chapter.\"\n\nOn her Whine Down podcast, Kramer opened up about blending families with Russell, who has a son.\n\nHe and Kramer share one child\n\nRussell and Kramer welcomed their son, Roman James, on Nov. 13, 2023.\n\n\"Allan and I are both overjoyed and truly grateful to announce the birth of our son. We feel blessed to have been given the chance to create something so special together,\" the couple told PEOPLE. \"James (his middle name) was both of our grandpa's names, so that was a nod to them.\"\n\nThe soccer coach also has a teenage son from a former relationship.\n\n\"He's splitting his time because he has a 15-year-old son in England. We make it work,\" Kramer told PEOPLE of their long-distance relationship. \"He is such a fun [dad].\"\n\nHe proposed to Kramer after six months of dating\n\nKramer explained how Russell proposed to her when speaking on the Whine Down with Jana Kramer podcast in May 2023. She said that the magical moment happened during a small pool party that she and her beau were hosting.\n\nAs it wrapped up, Kramer said that Russell suggested they go with her kids for a walk up to the new house they’re building. \"It was a really beautiful night, and me and the kids were all sitting… on the front porch of the steps, and just looking out at the view,\" she said.\n\n\"And he said my name, and I got up or whatever and then he got down on one knee, and Jolie just started jumping up and down. It was the cutest thing ever, it's like she knew what was happening,\" Kramer gushed.\n\nThe star said she \"kind of blacked out\" at that point, but remembers Russell saying, \"You're the love of my life\" and asking for her hand in marriage. \"We just both started crying, and it felt very sentimental given the front porch of the new house, new beginnings. It just felt right,\" she said.\n\n\"It was perfect. We were actually supposed to be in Jamaica but something happened with the resort so we ended up staying here, but honestly that's exactly what I would have wanted, was at the house,\" she continued. \"I don't need the roses and the whole glam setup.\"\n\nHe and Kramer wed in July 2024\n\nThe couple tied the knot on July 13, 2024, at the Carnell Estate in Scotland. Roughly 35 guests were in attendance, including Kramer's eldest children, Jolie and Jace.\n\n“I just knew that I wanted to marry him. We had talked about just going away and doing it ourselves, but it was important for me to have the wedding for Jolie and Jace, so they can see that we're married now,\" the One Tree Hill alum told PEOPLE.\n\nThe wedding paid homage to Russell's Scottish heritage. He donned a kilt at the altar and the reception featured haggis pie and ceilidh (traditional Scottish music)."
