        "text": "Lord Ivar Mountbatten still hasn't got used to the idea of having a husband. 'I just find it quite odd; he confides, before laughing with a deep roar. 'I suppose I'm quite tra­ditional.' It's been exactly a year since the 56-year-old married James Coyle, 57. Ivar is the first member of the extended British Royal fam­ily to come out publicly as gay. The lineages of the Windsors and Mountbattens are closely interwo­ven; Ivar is related to both the Queen and Prince Phillip. Ivar's father, David Mountbatten, was first cousin to Prince Philip, and 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven, whose uncle Louis Mountbatten was the last Viceroy of India, and mentor to Prince Charles.\n\nThe small ceremony took place in the chapel at Bridwell, Ivar's Grade-I listed home in Devon, that stands white as a wedding cake at the crown of its own deer park. It was a far cry from his very grand first wedding to Penny Thompson in April 1994. On that occasion, the groom wore white tie and guests included Prince Edward and Princess Margaret, who helped Penny to stick pins into her hair to help keep the giant family tiara from toppling off. The lavish re­ception after the service was held at Moyns Park, the vast Elizabethan house in Essex that Ivar inherited from a cousin. This time round, there were no Royal witnesses, though the Earl and Countess of Wessex were invited and sent their warmest wishes.\n\nAfterwards, the 64 guests, who included Ivar's three daugh­ters from his first marriage, drank Pol Roger and were serenaded by a gospel choir. And the best man? That was none other than Penny, who has given the new couple her fullest support.\n\nOnly ten years ago, for a member of the Royal Family to come out as gay and remarry to a man would have been unimaginable. But things are changing fast. This summer, Prince William said it would be 'absolutely fine by me' if one of his children was gay, and would 'fully support any decision they make'. It's a sign of the speed at which public attitudes to gay equality have changed more broadly that Ivar and James say they have yet to receive a single negative reaction from anyone. 'When I mentioned it to Ella [Ivar's eldest daughter] she was very cool about it,' he says. 'All her friends go on weekends where they snog each ocher, boy or girl, then go back and tell each ocher. I think that generation are just totally unfazed by it all.'\n\nWhat about the older genera­tion? Ivar's mother, Janet, 81, has a reputation for being somewhat formidable. 'The older generation of my family have seen and done it all before. They were quite wayward in the 1940s. My aunt Nada [Nadejda Mountbatten, 2nd Mar­chioness of Milford Haven] was a lesbian. You've got to try every­thing once, that's what my mother always said.'\n\nHas Ivar's decision to come out been good for the Royal family? 'Well, you would hope so!' he laughs. 'But then they don't really talk about it. I mean, the royals, they don't communicate very well.'\n\nWe are sitting in the small but elegant library at Bridwell, which has been Ivar's home for more than 20 years. He bought it in 1997 with Penny, after downsizing from Moyns when Ella was just one. She was followed by Alexandra in 1998 and Louise in 2002. The house is a handsome pedimented home that perfectly lends itself to large-scale entertaining. A bright yellow oval entrance hall leads on to two symmetrical sitting rooms and a large, contemporary grey dining room. Framed photographs of royal occasions, such as a picture of the Queen and Ivar on the royal yacht Britannia, give clues as to who lives here, but otherwise the style is clas­sic and neutral. Adjoining the main house is a light-filled conservatory which can seat 50 for lunch or dinner, and away from the main house is a wisteria-clad orangery with room for a further 50, where Ivar and James' wedding reception took place.\n\nWhen Ivar and Penny divorced in 2011, he planned to sell Bridwell. After two decades of running the estate, he had wanted a fresh start and planned to go travelling. Even though he always knew he was bi­sexual, and had told Penny before they got married, he didn't think he wanted to be openly gay after the divorce. 'I still wasn't comfort­able with it at that point,' he says now. 'I went on a few dates, and that's when I thought, \"do I really want to go down that route again, of having girlfriends?\" Even though that's what I was most comfortable with, because I was used to it.' But everything changed when he met James. They met by accident in the Farinet bar in Verbier when James, who works as a senior cabin crew for an airline, mistook Ivar for his ski instructor and shouted 'hello!' across the bar.\n\nListening to them talk now about their relationship, it is strik­ing how conventional and old-­fashioned it all sounds: the hours of intimate phone conversations, the awkward first dates, the comical small disasters. 'We used to speak to each ocher so much over the phone that it was a bit like being on Cilia Black's Blind Date, talking to each other through the screen,' says Ivar. They quickly knew they wanted to be together, and within weeks James had been introduced to Ivar's Family. 'He doesn't hang around,' says James. 'And chat's the delightful thing about Ivar, he makes his mind up about some­thing and sticks to it. There's no game playing, to a degree where you're almost looking for the catch. He's so straightforward and remarkably easy to love.' Both agree that meeting each other was the moment that emboldened them to commit to a new way of life. James had also spent years trying to bury his sexuality. He grew up as one of four, and remembers his father re­ferring to him as 'the queer one' when they were young. The sense of relief and freedom they both feel today is palpable. Perhaps most remarkable of all, there seems to be no losers in their story.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Olivia Henson, the new Duchess of Westminster? Let Tatler reveal all\n\nOlivia Henson and Hugh Grosvenor, Duke of Westminster married at Chester Cathedral on Friday 7 June. The Marlborough alumna has snapped up one of the most eligible bachelors in the land, so who is the bride?\n\nPenny has a new partner and Ivar's three daughters are entirely accepting of their father's choice, speaking of it without embarrass­ment over lunch. It's hard to imag­ine a more relaxed set-up. When James has a spare ticket on a long haul flight, he will take one of the girls with him, and they will share his hotel suite: he has taken them each to San Francisco, Rio and Hong Kong. 'I think they like hav­ing another man in the house,' says Ivar. 'Better than a step mother who could have turned out to be a step-monster.' James agrees. 'It's one thing that could have gone really badly wrong for the relationship. If even one of the daughters had been unhappy about it I don't think it would have worked. But we all get on incredibly well. I like to think they can confide in me.' For James, having no children of his own was one of the great sadnesses of being gay. 'So this is the icing on the cake. I've got a husband and a ready­made Family. Also Penny has been so open and kind about it. It has been lovely.'\n\nBefore moving to Bridwell, Ivar had run Moyns, where he was brought up. He recalls life there in the Seventies and Eighties as being 'like Downton Abbey. We had a huge staff - two footmen, fleets of people in the kitchen, and seven gardeners. It was one of the last houses to be run like that' The house was left equally to Ivar and his brother George by their mater­nal cousin Ivar Bryce, an old friend of Ian Fleming's on whom the character of James Bond was partly based. But in the end it became too much work and Ivar sold up.\n\nRead More\n\nThe real Queen Charlotte: revisiting the royal’s remarkable life on the anniversary of her birth\n\nQueen Charlotte may be a popular character in the Bridgerton universe. But Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the real Queen Charlotte, was a captivating historical figure\n\nThere have been times when Bridwell, though 'a fifth of the size of Moyns', has also been too much. It has been on the market twice in the last five years, last year for £5 million, but has not sold due to the difficult market conditions caused by Brexit. But now with James in his life, Ivar has once again committed to run­ning the house, which he has de­veloped into a successful wedding­ hire venue. Together they plan to evolve it further, moving out of the main house into the lodge which they will refurbish and extensively remodel into a large, comfortable house, allowing them to rent the main house out for conferences, away days and more weddings.\n\nIt's clear that James has fitted in well to life at Bridwell. He is the more domestic of the two, the consummate host, forever offering drinks and setting guests at their ease. He admits to having a bath­room full of lotions and potions, whereas Ivar doesn't use any products and is happier outdoors in tattered old jeans and a T-shirt. 'He's not vain at all, oh my god no,' says James. 'When we first met he had this scraggy beard and was bright red from skiing, having not applied any suncream properly.' In fact, Ivar is happiest when chopping logs with a chainsaw or darting around the park on a motorbike. He likes teaching James the ways of the countryside, showing him how to drive tractors or herd deer. When they go on holiday together, Ivar will make James go abseiling or sky­diving, when all James wants is to lie on a beach. 'He's like my little Action Man doll,' Ivar says. 'I like to teach him things, make him do things he's not used to. You know when you're a kid you had a little Action Man that you threw out of a window or made a parachute for? I do that with James.'\n\nRead More\n\nHugh Grosvenor: How the UK’s richest man under 40 stays normal\n\nHe inherited the title and the family business worth £10 billion. But as the Duke of Westminster marries Olivia Henson, revisit this investigation, published in the September 2017 issue of Tatler, which revealed that Grosvenor has almost no control over the wealth that defines him\n\n'We make a very good team,' says James, turning to the topic of the wedding business. 'We have young couples who come over looking to get married, and I only let Ivar talk to them for about five minutes as he starts saying ''Are you sure? Do you know how much it costs to get married? You will probably gee divorced...!'\" Ivar roars with laughter. 'Sometimes if they come along with their parents I will say \"Well of course we were married here\". And there will be a raising of an eyebrow.' I sense that Ivar likes to shock. 'I suppose I do quite like to shock. Why not?' He tells how one of their assistants, Vicky, 'who is quite proper', says it's important to wheel Ivar in 'because she says they like to see the nob.' So Ivar has a plan to appear one day in a twinset and pearls. ‘I would love to see her face. So yes, I suppose I do quite like to shock.’"
