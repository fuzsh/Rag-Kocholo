        "text": "Paul has been getting plenty of praise for the book – and has had a supportive girlfriend along the way. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight this week, the 41-year-old opened up about his relationship with the British superstar saying, “It’s important to support those who support you. And we support each other, so it’s great.”\n\nIt’s been a busy few weeks for the multimillionaire agent. Paul, whose net worth is said to hover around US$120 million, just revealed that he’s also set to team up with acting legend Denzel Washington to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, an association that helps kids.\n\nAnd that’s not all. The news comes amid rumours that Paul and Adele might’ve tied the knot! Per the Independent, the “Hello” songstress was spotted with a giant diamond ring, weeks after calling Paul her “husband” more than once.\n\nHere’s what we know about Adele’s potential new hubby:\n\nRich Paul had a tough childhood\n\nPaul’s memoir details his childhood, growing up in a crime-ridden part of Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1980s and 1990s. His mum reportedly struggled with drug addiction and sometimes didn’t come home. “I was never really a kid,” he told People.\n\nWhen asked about Adele’s reaction to his book, said in the same interview, “It was very emotional. I think a lot of it probably hit home, so yeah, it was a difficult read [for her].”\n\nHe’s a sports agent for NBA superstars like LeBron James\n\nPaul has clearly come a long way in his life and is now revered for being one of the most sought-after sports agents out there. Besides being the right-hand man to NBA icon LeBron James, the 41-year-old founder of Klutch Sports Group counts Sacramento Kings’ De’Aaron Fox, Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green, LA Lakers’ Anthony Davis and Chicago Bulls’ Zach LaVine among his top clients, per Sportskeeda.\n\nWill Adele and Rich Paul have more kids?\n\nBoth Adele and Paul have kids from previous relationships.\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Entertainment, Paul has three children – including one who’s in university – and has already said he’s open to having more in the future. “As a young dad, growing a business, it was pretty tough,” he told E! News. “But now, looking as an older dad, if I was to have more kids, I’m looking forward to being a different dad.”\n\nAdele, aged 35, seems keen on the idea too. “I definitely want more kids,” she told Elle last year, “I’m a homemaker and I’m a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music.” The “Easy On Me” songstress shares a 10-year-old son Angelo with her ex-husband, Simon Konecki.\n\nHe’s been linked to Adele since 2021\n\nAdele – whose own net worth is believed to be US$220 million – shared her love story with Rolling Stone, telling the publication that she first met Paul through mutual friends at a party in 2021. Per Harper’s Bazaar, things got serious by the summer of that year.\n\nTheir romance has moved quickly, and by 2022, they moved into a US$58 million mansion in Beverly Hills formerly owned by Sylvester Stallone.\n\n“We’re in a good space. Happy,” Paul told CBS Mornings in October. “She’s superb. We’ve been great for each other.”\n\nAs for the marriage rumours, he did not confirm nor deny the speculation, simply stating that he’s “not the type of person” to delve into his personal life.\n\nThey go on double dates with LeBron and Savannah James\n\nTalk about the ultimate double power couple! It seems like Adele has got on nicely with Paul’s pals including LeBron James and his wife Savannah. The iconic foursome were spotted hanging out at Kevin Love and Kate Bock’s wedding last summer."
