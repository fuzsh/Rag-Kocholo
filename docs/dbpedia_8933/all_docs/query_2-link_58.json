        "text": "If you’ve ever wondered if something was wrong with you…\n\n…or wondered if you’ll ever fall in love…\n\n…or if your heart cried over all the adventures you’ll have to tell your husband about someday, instead of make with him…\n\nI’ve been there.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m sitting here at my favorite place on earth: a local coffee shop.\n\nThe glossy, wooden tables and deep red walls set nicely against the Alaskan mountains in the distance. That’s right: I’m at a coffee shop in Anchorage, Alaska! (Can I just take a moment to do a happy dance?!) My husband James had some clients to see up here, and we decided to turn it into our one-year anniversary trip!\n\nYou see, this week is a big week. Yesterday was our first wedding anniversary. Thursday is my 30th birthday.\n\nAnd this past weekend was my “13 Going on 30” birthday party — celebrating both my inner teen and 30-year-old body.\n\nThe party was complete with hair & body glitter, a candy bar, Polaroids and a “yearbook” to sign, and was held in a COFFEE SHOP. (I felt SO LOVED — thanks to my hubby and bestie for throwing this amazing party!!)\n\nBelow I’ve included a couple photos — I try not to put people up on my social media without their permission, so I’ve included one of me and two of my closest girlfriends (we tried painting our eyes bright teenage colors though you can’t see it well here) as well as one of me and my hubby, James. 🙂\n\nSo here we are at age 30. Just twelve short months that seem to contain a lifetime have passed since we said “I do.” And every day, I am so thankful we did.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis is the question that plagued me all through high school, college, and my early 20s: How will I know if someone is the one I want to spend my life with?\n\nI thought it would be a gut feeling. I thought that somewhere deep inside, my heart would immediately know when I met “the one.”\n\nAnd that did happen for me. Three different times. With three different guys. And sadly, none of them were my husband James!\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis was our first married Valentine’s Day…and it ended up hilariously different than we expected!\n\nFirst, I have to give some back story.\n\nLast year was our first Valentine’s Day together. We stayed with my grandparents to celebrate in one of our favorite cities: Austin, TX. We frequented classy restaurants, explored the city in 70-degree weather, and filled our days with shooting lessons and tandem biking in adorable outfits.\n\nIt was the exact opposite of this year.\n\nActually, side note: Last year was the first Valentine’s Day James had ever spent with a girl, and one of the few I’d ever spent with a guy. Most of his Valentine’s Day were spent watching chick flicks with guy friends (for real), and mine were spent watching chick flicks with girl friends.\n\nSo of course, I was thinking: Our first married Valentine’s Day is going to be SO romantic.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nYesterday was my husband’s 28th birthday,\n\nso he decided to celebrate the fact that this was the last time his age would be a mathematically “perfect number” … by celebrating each of the factors of 28 (the factors are: 14, 7, 4, 2, and 1). (He explains it more in the video below.) He decided this meant doing the following things:\n\nSeeing 14 special people\n\nGetting 7 free birthday foods\n\nDoing 4 random acts of kindness\n\nDoing 2 athletic activities\n\nWatching 1 birthday movie\n\nWe did it ALL!! (And boy am I tired today.)\n\nThis celebration involved two things in particular that he LOVES: People and food.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m such a creeper for capturing this, but couldn’t resist. Walked out of the bedroom at 6:30 this morning to see my husband and three of his friends praying over their families, community, and world. 😍💓 Girls, THIS is a man worth waiting for!! Not someone who’s perfect, but someone who loves Jesus and cares about others with everything he’s got, even when no one is looking.\n\nYou basically can’t get much more newlywed than us, so friends keep asking what our most shocking discovery of marriage has been thus far, and each time we say:\n\nWe can’t sleep while cuddling!\n\nAt least not yet. James’s body is just SO WARM, it’s like my own space heater! So at first I’m curled up next to him, shaking with cold, but then next thing you know I’m throwing off the covers from what feels like heat stroke!\n\n(And James does not like when I throw off the covers. He likes his covers to be like “lasagna,” with every layer pulled up nice and high, and so he starts asking why I’m messing up his “lasagna.”) (Only he would describe his cover arrangements as one of his favorite meals.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThat question tormented me all through high school…and college…and my twenties.\n\n“What if I miss him?”\n\n“What if I marry the wrong person?”\n\n“What if I never meet ‘the one’?”\n\nAnd then it would all come back around to: “How do I know if someone is ‘the one’?”\n\nI’m not even going to pretend to know the answer to that question. I may be married, but that “knowing” still feels very much a mystery.\n\nHowever, I do want to share the things that made me feel incredibly confident that I wanted to marry James (my husband of 10 weeks. You can’t get much more newlywed than us! ;-))\n\nI never thought I’d feel confident about getting married; I was terrified of the prospect with the guys I previously dated! And yet…I walked down the aisle without fear. Full of excitement.\n\nSo this blog is about why I was quite sure that James was “my one.”\n\nAnd how meeting “the one” three times helped me find “my one.”\n\nContinue reading →"
