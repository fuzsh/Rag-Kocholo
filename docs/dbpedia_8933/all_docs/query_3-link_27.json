        "text": "Kate Middleton's sister-in-law is one interesting woman. Alizee Thevenet, a financial expert, married Kate's brother James Middleton in France in 2021.\n\n\"Mr & Mrs Middleton ‚ù§Ô∏è üá¨üáß üá´üá∑,\" Middleton wrote on social media after their wedding. \"Yesterday I married the love of my life surrounded by family, friends and of course a few dogs in the beautiful village [of] Bormes-les-Mimosas. Words cannot describe how happy I am ‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nSo who is James's wife? Here's what to know about Alizee Thevenet.\n\nThey reportedly met in 2018.\n\nPer the Daily Mail, Middleton and Thevenet had been dating for around 10 months when they got engaged, and first met in a London bar.\n\nThevenet speaks three languages.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn, Thevenet can speak Spanish and English, in addition to her native French. Given that she grew up between six different countries‚ÄîGermany, Indonesia, Chile, France, Belgium, and England‚Äîit's hardly surprising that she's picked up some foreign languages.\n\nShe's an accomplished financial analyst.\n\nThevenet holds a Master's degree in Investment and Finance from Queen Mary University of London, and has been working in the London financial industry for years.\n\nThevenet and Middleton arrive at Lady Gabriella Windsor‚Äôs wedding.\n\nThevenet's dad likes Middleton as much as she does.\n\nIn January, Jean-Gabriel Thevenet opened up to the Daily Mail about his daughter's beau. \"James is a very charming man,\" he said. \"I am very happy that Alizee is together with James. I know she is very happy. We keep our fingers crossed for them... James and the Middleton family are very charming. We have a lot of admiration for the whole Middleton family‚ÄîJames, his sisters and his parents.\"\n\nThevenet and Middleton have been seriously dating for some time now.\n\nThe couple was first spotted together when they went to the Henry van Straubenzee Memorial Fund‚Äôs Christmas Carol Service at St. Luke‚Äôs Church in 2018 (although Thevenet made an effort to shield her face from the paparazzi). Soon after, they were seen vacationing in St. Barts along with James's sister Pippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews. And in mid-May 2019, they made their first real appearance together at Lady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston's wedding.\n\nThe couple first announced their engagement on Instagram in fall 2019.\"‚ù§Ô∏èShe said OUI ‚ù§Ô∏è\" Middleton wrote at the time. \"Our secret is out but we couldn‚Äôt be happier to share the news ü•Çüçæ #jalizee üá¨üáßüá´üá∑\"\n\nShe also loves dogs.\n\nLike her husband, Alizee is a dog lover. Here's their Christmas pic from 2022:"
