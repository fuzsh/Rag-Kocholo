His two spells at Craven Cottage - the first during 2014-15 on loan from Middlesbrough for the final stages of the season, and the second spell for one month to cover the recently acquired but injured Luke Garbutt were largely successful for James and the fans were impressed. An attacking left back by trade, James had played for Doncaster Rovers and Middlesbrough prior to his loan moves. His performances led to many fans wanting a permanent signature during the summer of 2015.\n\nCareer[]\n\nBefore Fulham[]\n\nFulham (2015)[]\n\nJames joined the club on 25 March 2015, in a loan move until the end of the season from Middlesbrough, with the deal seeing Fernando Amorebieta travelling in the opposite direction. He only made five appearances for the club, yet the fans were impressed by his displays and there were calls for Fulham to attempt to sign him permanently.\n\nAfter an early injury to the recent loan signing Luke Garbutt, Fulham signed James once more on loan on 28 August 2015, this time on a one month loan. Fernando Amorebieta again went in the opposite direction for the remainder of the season.\n\nAfter Fulham[]\n\nFulham Statistics[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason League League FA Cup League Cup Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals 2014-15 Championship 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 2015-16 Championship 12 0 0 0 0 0 12 0 Total 17 0 0 0 0 0 17 0\n\nDisciplinary[]\n\nSeason 2014-15 0 0 2015-16 2 1 Total 2 1\n\nFulham Matches[]\n\n# Season Date Comp Opposition Venue Result Score Additional Information 1 2014-15 3 Apr 2015 CHMP Brentford Home Lost 1-4 2 2014-15 7 Apr 2015 CHMP Charlton Away Drew 1-1 3 2014-15 10 Apr 2015 CHMP Wigan Home Drew 2-2 4 2014-15 15 Apr 2015 CHMP Rotherham Home Drew 1-1 5 2014-15 18 Apr 2015 CHMP Blackpool Away Won 1-0 6 2015-16 29 Aug 2015 CHMP Rotherham Away Won 3-1 7 2015-16 13 Sept 2015 CHMP Blackburn Home Won 2-1 8 2015-16 19 Sept 2015 CHMP Sheff Wed Away Lost 2-3 57' 9 2015-16 25 Sept 2015 CHMP QPR Home Won 4-0 10 2015-16 29 Sept 2015 CHMP Wolves Home Lost 0-3 11 2015-16 4 Oct 2015 CHMP Charlton Away Drew 2-2 12 2015-16 24 Oct 2015 CHMP Reading Home Won 4-2 13 2015-16 31 Oct 2015 CHMP Bristol City Away Won 4-1 87' 14 2015-16 3 Nov 2015 CHMP Burnley Away Lost 1-3 15 2015-16 7 Nov 2015 CHMP Birmingham Home Lost 2-5 48', 49' 16 2015-16 28 Nov 2015 CHMP Preston Home Drew 1-1 58', 89' 17 2015-16 5 Dec 2015 CHMP Nottm Forest Away Lost 0-3\n\n[]\n\n2014-15 squad 1.
