        "text": "Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu were married on May 1, 1967, at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, \"in the second floor private suite of Milton Prell, principal owner of the Aladdin and a longtime friend of Elvis' manager, Col. Tom Parker,\" reported The Commercial Appeal.\n\n\"It took only eight minutes for Nevada Supreme Court Justice David Zenoff, a short (5-foot-7), distinguished looking man, to marry them.\n\n\"The couple promised to 'love, honor, cherish and comfort.' The word 'obey' was not used.\"\n\nFourteen guests were in attendance. The \"best men\" were Elvis pals Joe Esposito and Marty Lacker. The maid of honor was Priscilla's sister, Michelle Beaulieu.\n\n\"Elvis wore a formal brocaded suit with vest,\" the newspaper continued. \"The bride wore a semi-fitted floorlength gown of white chiffon over satin with seed pearl and bugle bead trim on the bodice. The gown had a six-foot-long train and she wore a double-tiered rhinestone crown with a full illusion veil. She carried pink rosebuds on a white Bible given her by Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Presley.\" (Mrs. Presley in this case was Dee Presley, second wife of Elvis' father, Vernon; Elvis' mother, Gladys, had died nine years earlier.)\n\nELVIS AT OVERTON PARK: Inside the historic 1954 concert that launched the King's career\n\nElvis and Priscilla met in 1959 in West Germany, where Elvis was stationed after being drafted; he was 24, she was 14. Priscilla (born Priscilla Ann Wagner) was there because her stepfather, Air Force officer Paul Beaulieu, also was on duty in Germany. (Her biological father, James Frederick Wagner, a U.S. Navy pilot, was killed in a plane crash when Priscilla was less than 6 months old.)\n\nElvis and Priscilla divorced in 1973. Now 79, Priscilla never remarried.\n\nOn their wedding date, Elvis was 32, and Priscilla was 21."
