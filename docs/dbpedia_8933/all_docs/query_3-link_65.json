        "text": "James Hepburn, 4th earl of Bothwell (born 1535?—died April 4, 1578, Dragsholm Castle, Sjaelland, Denmark) was the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. He evidently engineered the murder of Mary’s second husband, Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, thereby precipitating the revolt of the Scottish nobles and Mary’s flight to England, where she was imprisoned by Queen Elizabeth I and eventually executed.\n\nThe son of Patrick Hepburn, 3rd earl of Bothwell, Hepburn succeeded to his father’s title in 1556. Although a Protestant, he supported the Roman Catholic Mary of Lorraine, who was regent for the young queen Mary Stuart, in her struggle against the Protestant Scottish nobles. Upon the death of Mary of Lorraine in 1560, Mary Stuart assumed control of the government, and in 1561 Bothwell became a member of her Privy Council. But he was soon embroiled in a feud with the powerful but deranged earl of Arran. Having been accused by Arran of plotting to kidnap the queen, Bothwell was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle in March 1562. He escaped the following August and, after a period of detention in England, reached France in September 1564.\n\nThe following year Bothwell was recalled to Scotland to help suppress the rebellion of Mary’s half-brother, James Stewart, earl of Moray, who had opposed her marriage (in July 1565) to Lord Darnley. Bothwell then won the queen’s affection by acting with loyalty and resourcefulness during the critical events surrounding the murder on March 9, 1566, of her secretary, David Riccio, at the instigation of Darnley. By the end of the year Mary had made Bothwell the most powerful noble in southern Scotland, and she encouraged him to become her husband."
