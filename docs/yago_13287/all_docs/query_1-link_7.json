        "text": "\"The warmth of an exquisite piece of wood in a cool contemporary design -- that to me is a thing of beauty.\"\n\nMany of Carol Jackson's contemporary furniture pieces are designed around mathematical and scientific principles. Captivated at an early age by the beauty inherent in physics and math, she majored in those fields and now brings ideas from the world of science to her artistry. Topics ranging from geometric theorems to the behavior of subatomic particles provide inspiration for her unique designs.\n\nJackson places exceptional pieces of naturally finished wood in starring roles, supported by contrasting elements of ebonized ash and satin anodized aluminum. Inlays of ebony and aluminum express the design concept. This palette of materials, together with spare but elegant forms, define her unique contemporary style.\n\nAfter earning degrees in physics, math, and computer science and working for 25 years in software engineering, Jackson followed her heart to the study of architecture and furniture design. Through a three-year graduate program at the University of Oregon, she focused on furniture design and received a master of architecture degree. With more than 35 years of woodworking experience, she brings her designs to reality.\n\nREAD MORE"
