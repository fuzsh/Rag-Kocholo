        "text": "Phil use to be such a great character. He was an all rounder -he was believable . He was kind without being soft you knew you couldn‚Äôt take the pee but you also knew you‚Äôd get treated fairly.\n\nOver the years he‚Äôs turned into his brother but without the vulnerability.\n\nI know we all change over the years but he was meant to be in his prime here surely this would be the time where he‚Äôd be wanting to shoot everyone not when he got wiser ?\n\nI wonder if Steve Mcfadden still believe in the character or if he just goes along with it cause it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs paid to do?\n\nSurely the likes of him Adam Woodyate and Lettisha Dean can see it‚Äôs not the same show it was ?\n\nWatching Classic Eastenders has made me realise that the character has truly run its course. While it makes for good entertainment value at times it seems nothing more than a parody of Grant at his volatile worst.\n\nSometimes it honestly does seem like some of the older actors on the show are going through the motions, probably for the same reasons why The Rolling Stones still tour or Rod Stewart releases crap albums every year. Think about itüòâ\n\nSo true I always thought when Ross Kemp left that they missed him and tried to turn Phil in to a copy of him.\n\nI watched the other week with the boat crash and I thought the same that the character just does the same thing year after year .\n\nAnother ‚Äúbaddie‚Äù comes on the square has a run in with Phil,Phil gets the better of him after 9mths of tedious build up and then goes to Portugal for 3 mths and just leaves whoever he‚Äôs with at the time to look after his house kids and business.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Steve Mcfadden cares anymore ,it‚Äôs money for old rope for him he comes and goes as he pleases and if he feels like taking 6mths off he does.\n\nThat's it, in a nutshell. Watching yesterday's classic episode next to the current one shown on Tuesday you can clearly see a 95% character transformation. The only thing that seems to remain is the way he says \"uh\" mid-sentence üòÇ\n\nAt the moment there's a teaser that Phil may buy the Vic in order to win Sharon back following the whole boat saga. For Pete's sake - in reality a successful dodgy businessman like Phil Mitchell wouldn't still be living in the \"ends\" after all that's been. How many time can they own/buy/sell the same businesses without just moving on?\n\nFor me Ian seems to be the only original who hasn't had a character transplant and is just as annoying and conniving as ever. Sharon's mix of vulnerability and ballsyness remains but can often fall into self-parody. Kathy seemed to acquire some level of sophistication when she came back from the dead but still remains as before.\n\nIn the words of a now-defunct US website. Eastenders has truly \"jumped the shark\" and probably did so when it turned 30...\n\nFunny exactly what I think,that‚Äôs when I stopped watching. It every day Thought they dragged the ‚Äúwho killed Lucy‚Äùstoryline on for far too long for it just to be Bobby who killed her but I swallowed that. I thought the live episode when you found out who done it was great,Great acting by everyone and it wasn‚Äôt revolved about Danny dyer and his family for once. But it felt once Dominic Tread-well Collins left the whole thing just fell to pieces.\n\nWillmott-Brown coming back could have been a brilliant storyline but again just went on for too long. I stopped watching religiously when Max left Jane in a burning building and was the reason Steven died but they just brushed it under the carpet.\n\nIt‚Äôs like you said about Phil buying the Vic,it‚Äôs the same old characters doing the same thing again and again -how many times have we had the ‚Äúwilll they /won‚Äôt they ? Storyline with Kay and Alfie? They was good characters once but I can‚Äôt stand them now, personally I feel the Slaters have run their course but they don‚Äôt have any interesting characters to replace them with? It always intrigues me that Corrie have managed to evolve Characters like Ken and Gail for 60 years and keep them interesting while Eastenders just repeats and repeats storylines that were once good over and over again.\n\nPhil probably will buy the Vic for Sharon cause let‚Äôs face it who else can they have in it that viewers are going to want to see everyday?\n\nI can‚Äôt think of anyone other than Sharon and Phil who they could get to run it who would be believable? But like you said would a man who‚Äôs meant to be in his sixties now really be wanting to buy an eastend boozer when pubs in the eastend are closing everyday(pre-covid19 days)?"
