        "text": "Hello dear friend,\n\n​\n\nI'm Dr. Carol Hull-Jackson, and welcome to our Healing Ministry Page. We're glad to have you here.\n\nThe Lord has been taking us on an extraordinary journey of discovering His power to heal the body (physical healing) and the soul (inner healing).\n\nAt salvation and through the finished work of Christ on the Cross, our Spirit man is instantly redeemed. Yet, living in a fallen world, our bodies still experience brokenness and various sicknesses, as do our souls. Thus, the powerful transformation we experience in our Spirit man must be effectively worked out in our bodies, minds, emotions and will.\n\nPraise the Lord that Jesus is sufficient for all things, heals physical ailments, and restores our broken souls. Through Christ's Spirit and His word, we are given the spiritual tools and empowerment to bring His healing and the ministry of reconciliation to our fallen world, one person, family and community at a time.\n\n​\n\nAs we build this page, you will find links to resources, training sessions and meetings we will host specifically for healing ministry (physical and inner healing). If you need healing, are interested in our Soul Care and Inner Healing sessions, or are looking for a community of believers to grow in the healing ministry, you've found the right place. Let's connect.\n\n​\n\nVerses:\n\nPs 23: 1-3 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.\n\n​\n\n2 Chron 7:14 (KJV)\n\nIf my people, called by my name, shall humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."
