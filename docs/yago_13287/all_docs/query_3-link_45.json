        "text": "On Wednesday, October 27, 2021, our loving and all-wise God called home to her eternal rest, Elder Carol Ann Jackson. She was born on November 13, 1944, in Norfolk, VA to the late Samuel and Lula Bradley. She was an Honors Graduate of I.C. Norcom High School, Class of 1963, and worked as a Private Hospice Caregiver with various agencies until she retired.\n\nWhile working as a Private Duty Hospice Nurse, she brought many souls to Jesus Christ. She showed love to all her patients and served them with great care and compassion. She was well loved by her patients and their families. Some of these families became a part of her extended family.\n\nCarol was a licensed Elder and faithful member of St. Mark Church of Deliverance in Portsmouth, VA, for more than 50 years. She was a prayer warrior, covering her leaders and their family, church family, the nations, and her own family in fervent prayer. A woman full of wisdom who spoke softly. But, when she spoke, her words were few, but powerful and full of God’s anointing.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her grandparents- Reuben and Edith Mitchell; father, Samuel T. Bradley, Sr. and mother, Lula Bradley; two daughters-Sharon Freeman and Cynthia Baynes; late husband Howard Jackson, Sr.\n\nCarol is survived by her brother, Samuel T. Bradley, Jr.; seven loving children-Angela Perry (John), Lisa White, Andrea Jackson, Sonya Chapman, and Tammy Hart (Robert). She will be missed by 27 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews and a host of other relatives and friends."
