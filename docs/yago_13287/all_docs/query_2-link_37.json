        "text": "Pivoting from an en masse event to individual and small-group walks has only bolstered The Floating Hospital’s first Annual Walk for Families\n\nA surge of the Covid-19 Delta variant msy have altered The Floating Hospital’s plans for its first Walk for Families, but it didn’t dampen the spirit of those who found a way to walk in solidarity anyway. Origina!y created as an in-person walk from Midtown Manhattan across the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge to celebrate the opening of the new clinic, the event was reimagined as a walk-when-and-where-you-want fundraiser during the month of October.\n\n“When we pivoted from an in-person event to a mostly virtual event, we weren’t sure how it was going to shake out,” said Ellen Barker, executive director of the clinic’s foundation. “We couldn’t be sure of the level of enthusiasm or participation with an event that didn’t rely on face-to-face interaction and in-person community building.”\n\nBut no moss grew under the feet of the organization’s many ardent supporters, with a surge of support from sponsors inside and out of the community, making the $100,000 fundraising goal, within reach.\n\nThe walk also revitalized a focus on health and fitness, and even spurred a bit of healthy competitiveness among the clinic’s departments who formed teams to raise funds.\n\n“I believe it is important to participate and to promote these events among the staff and among anybody connected with The Floating Hospital, because initiatives like this create awareness about the clinic and its mission,” says Ivan Romero, director of the Families in Temporary Housing outreach program. Romero formed a five-person team from his division and walked the Queensboro Bridge together with a goal to raise at least $400. “When our patients see our dedication and devotion for the wellbeing of families living in shelters, they get a sense that there are organizations like ours that will advocate for them and be with them during difficult times in their lives.”\n\nNot to be outdone, other walk teams formed, too, like Sreeta Quintana’s quintet from the operations staff. Naming themselves the “TFH United Warriors,” they exceed their goal of raising $600 by at least 30%. Yet another team organized in the name of devoted Floating Hospital board chair, Carol Campbell, who recently was diagnosed with brain cancer. With 25 members, “Team Carol” planned to walk the Central Park reservoir and raise $5,000 in her honor.\n\nThough the walk pivoted from its original design, it demonstrated that with a little creative thinking, The Floating Hospital’s 150-year-old mission still marches strong.\n\nThe Floating Hospital thanks all who have supported the first annual walk, with special thanks to Presenting Sponsor Wunderman Thompson and lead “Block Sponsors” Alera Group, Greiner-Maltz and Lamb Insurance Services.\n\n— Amy Zavatto"
