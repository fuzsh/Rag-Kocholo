        "text": "Carol desperately wants her family to succeed in life, as she never did. If you can turn down the volume to hear the words she’s hollering, she actually talks a lot of sense. It's just a shame she often gets people’s back up before they have the chance to realise it...\n\nCarol went through a hard time when she found a lump in her right breast, ultimately discovering that she had breast cancer. After lying to David, she finally opened up to him, as well as telling Bianca and Sonia."
