        "text": "Anthony Barringer ‘Tony’ of Olivebridge, NY, passed away on May 11, 2022. He was 84 years old. Tony was born on December 10, 1937 in Kingston; he was the son of the late Floyd and Lena (Constable) Barringer.\n\nTony was a lifelong area resident. On July 12th 1958 he married the love of his life, Janet (Calhoun) Barringer at the Samsonville United Methodist Church and together raised their family in Olivebridge. Sadly, Janet died in 2014 after 56 beautiful years. Tony had worked for IBM in Kingston for 30+ years. After his retirement he drove school bus and really loved doing that for the kids. Tony fixed everything for everybody, when something wasn’t working you knew to “Just call Tony”. He enjoyed hunting and fishing, he was an incredibly talented craftsman having created beautiful pieces for all his grandchildren in his woodworking shop. He enjoyed traveling cross country and loved stopping at the beach. Many times it was just putting the kids in the car and driving the countryside. And he couldn’t say enough about his favorite meal at Taco Bell. He will be deeply missed by his family and all who knew him.\n\nTony is survived by his children, Connie Rogers (Dan) of Olivebridge, and John Barringer (Lisa) of Olivebridge; his grandchildren, Cheyenne Fletcher (Ron), Eli Guillon (Gwenn), Adam Guillon (Kelly), Alice Guillon (Jared), Tyler Barringer (Danielle), Danielle Xue (Tony), and Audrey Rogers; his great grandchildren, Aria, Avari and Tenley; his siblings, Carol Jackson, Robert Barringer, Gertrude Kaiser, and Joan Warnecke; and several nieces, nephews and extended family.\n\nBesides his parents and his wife Janet, Tony was predeceased by his brothers, Lawrence and Vincent Barringer.\n\nVisiting will be held on Tuesday, May 17th from 6-8pm at H.B. Humiston Funeral Home, Kerhonkson. On Wednesday, May 18th visiting will be from 9-10am and the service will begin at 10am at the funeral home. Burial will follow at Palentown Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in Tony’s name to the Ronald McDonald House Charities Inc., 26345 Network Place, Chicago, IL 60673-1263 and/or to the Olive First Aid Unit, PO Box 151, Shokan, NY 12481."
