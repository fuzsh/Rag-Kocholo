Though kind and warm-hearted, Carol is Bianca’s mother, and is similarly quick-tempered, overbearing and always right. Or at least that’s what she thinks…\n\nCarol desperately wants her family to succeed in life, as she never did. If you can turn down the volume to hear the words she’s hollering, she actually talks a lot of sense. It's just a shame she often gets people’s back up before they have the chance to realise it...\n\nAfter forgiving Bianca for the affair with Dan Sullivan, they started getting along well again. Which brought the Jackson clan together, until the tragic death of her son, Billie.\n\nCarol went through a hard time when she found a lump in her right breast, ultimately discovering that she had breast cancer. After lying to David, she finally opened up to him, as well as telling Bianca and Sonia.\n\nPlayed by Lindsey Coulson.\n\nGallery\n\nVideos"
