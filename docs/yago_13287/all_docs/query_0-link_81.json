        "text": "I love books set in National & State Parks, so I jumped at the chance to read & review the Romance in the Park series of contemporary romances by Katherine Robles! These are all standalone titles, set in different parks, so you can pick up with whichever one most interests you and go from there.\n\nWHITEWATER WISHES by Katherine Robles\n\nSERIES: Romance in the Park #1\n\nGENRE: Contemporary Romance (Christian)\n\nPUBLISHER: White Rose Publishing\n\nRELEASE DATE: June 16, 2023\n\nPAGES: 173\n\nBridget plans to spend her summer working as a white water rafting guide and studying for her beautician’s license exam. She isn’t looking for romance, and she isn’t impressed with nerdy nurse Drew when he steps into her raft. She’s looking for a strong man like the father she failed, but she finds it hard to resist Drew’s passion for life.\n\nAs a hospital nurse, Drew loves helping people to heal, but after one of his younger patients dies, Drew feels the need to seize the day. So, he faces his fear of open water and goes white water rafting. He’s attracted to Bridget, but meeting his dream girl couldn’t have come at a worse time. His best friend is in trouble and Drew must decide how far he’s willing to go to keep his friend’s secret.\n\nWhen injury capsizes Bridget’s career, they’ll need strength beyond their own to keep their love afloat.\n\nI have never in my life had the desire to go whitewater rafting but if I did I would want Bridget as my guide! I also never thought I would fall in love with a character over a water snake but that’s what happened to me with Drew! Both protagonists of Whitewater Wishes are developed and engaging, and I was soon invested in their story.\n\nI really enjoyed Bridget’s friendly personality and how she put others at ease, easily incorporating people into her circle. People like Drew, a hospital nurse who is daring to brave his fears the day they meet. He’s much more reserved than Bridget’s adventurous spirit and watching them balance each other is both sweet and entertaining. I respected him as a man of integrity early on in the book, and he cements this first impression more than once as the story progresses. The contrast between Drew vs. Bridget when it comes to doing difficult things is poignant, and the character growth around this point – particularly in Bridget – is heartwarming.\n\nBottom Line: Whitewater Wishes by Katherine Robles is a layered story of two people who begin navigating life’s rapids together as friends who share a mutual attraction, an instant connection, that slowly builds to a sweet romance. I appreciated the ‘real life’ issues that the author weaves into the characters’ lives – bumpy patches that cover everything from coming-of-age hurdles to tougher stuff like trauma, addiction, and life-threatening health issues – and the faith discussions that naturally occur in those circumstances. And in between, readers are treated to cute scenes that keep the mood from getting heavy. A quick but compelling read that will leave you smiling!\n\n(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book which I received from the author. All views expressed are only my honest opinion.)\n\nMy Rating: 4 stars / enjoyed it!\n\nKissingBook Level: 2 / warm rosy glow of sweetness\n\naffiliate links used\n\nFALLING FOR FOREVER by Katherine Robles\n\nSERIES: Romance in the Park #2\n\nGENRE: Contemporary Romance (Christian)\n\nPUBLISHER: White Rose Publishing\n\nRELEASE DATE: August 4, 2023\n\nPAGES: 184\n\nHillary needs a major change in her life. She’s stifled by an entry level IT job in the Virginia suburbs and longs to move to Washington D.C. where she can make a difference in the world.\n\nWhen Javier comes to her rescue in Great Falls National Park, Hillary likes everything about him except for the gorgeous fiance hanging on his arm. But things are not as they seem. He enlists her help to renovate a homeless shelter, and romance blossoms over paintbrushes and pipes until a career-launching opportunity arises.\n\nHillary can chase her dreams, but they might cost her Javier’s heart.\n\nBefore I say anything else about Falling for Forever, I have to note that Hillary and Javier’s meet-cute is my favorite in this series. I could just see it playing out in my head, from the interrupted climb/photo session to the dead car battery to the surprising twist in the meet-cute that I didn’t see coming. I think you’ll be left grinning just like I was!\n\nI loved Javier right from the beginning, and the more I got to know him the more I loved him. Like Drew in Whitewater Wishes, Javier is a man of integrity and selflessness. His heart for the homeless shelter in need of help won me completely over to his side, and I appreciated this outward focus to his character. Hillary was a bit pricklier and tougher for me to get to know. I wanted to reach into the pages, grip her gently by the shoulders, and tell her that none of what consumed her is important in the long run. But I also remember being that age (vaguely lol) and having to learn those lessons the hard way… which is what Hillary must navigate – along with her budding relationship with Javier – in Falling for Forever. I enjoyed watching her grow deeper in ‘practical faith’, the kind that impacts our daily lives in everything from how we respond to people to how we do our work. I also really liked her Dad – he’s so endearing in a ‘classic dad’ kind of way.\n\nBottom Line: Falling for Forever by Katherine Robles is sweet and insightful, with a gentle romance and dashes of humor. The multicultural aspect to this story gave it a variety of vibrant layers beyond ‘just’ the developing relationship between Javier & Hillary (and the faith themes), and as someone with experience in blending cultures I had a blast watching it happen very true to form in this book. If you’re looking for a story that challenges you to grow, while also entertaining you with great characters and light romance, then Falling for Forever should be your next read!\n\n(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book which I received from the author. All views expressed are only my honest opinion.)\n\nMy Rating: 4 stars / loved it!\n\nKissingBook Level: 2 / warm rosy glow of sweetness\n\naffiliate links used\n\nAGAPE AFTER ALL by Katherine Robles\n\nSERIES: Romance in the Park #3\n\nGENRE: Contemporary Romance (Christian)\n\nPUBLISHER: White Rose Publishing\n\nRELEASE DATE: September 22, 2023\n\nPAGES: 167\n\nWhen Vanessa meets Tony on a camping trip in Hickory Run State Park, she’s not looking for love. She’s already engaged to Collin, a man who checks everything on her list: smart, handsome, and a Christian.\n\nWhen, against Collin’s wishes, she signs up for a Biblical Greek class, Tony inspires her, and a deep friendship develops between them. As she finds her voice, she begins to yearn for a different future than the one she had planned. Are her doubts just cold feet or is she about to marry the wrong man?\n\nThere’s always a fine line in writing a romance where one of the protagonists is already in a committed relationship, much more so when he or she is engaged. Yet, Katherine Robles walks this line beautifully and keeps everything above board, avoiding any semblance of cheating while still allowing the needed character development and growth.\n\nReaders can tell early on that something’s a little off in Vanessa’s relationship with her fiance Collin. He might check all the boxes on paper but in practice he immediately comes across as needy and raised some red flags for me. Warning signs that, if I had a friend in a relationship with someone like that, would become the topic of a concerned conversation. I appreciated the process that Vanessa went through (including staying grounded in prayer and the Word) as she gradually realized these relationship issues and how they were affecting her. And I really liked how the author used the Greek class that Vanessa takes to help bring these issues to the forefront.\n\nBecause most of this story is about Vanessa re-evaluating her relationship with Collin, there’s not a lot of focus on romance. Her friendship with Tony stays firmly within those boundaries, and Tony’s respect of her relationship with Collin makes him even more admirable. The contrast between the two men is obvious, and I loved how the author allowed the comparison without forcing it. Yet, even though the plot centers mostly on Vanessa’s growth, there is the hope of a loving relationship tucked away in the wings, waiting for the right moment to blossom.\n\nBottom Line: Agape After All by Katherine Robles combines sweet friendship and a hint of romance with an important life lesson, much like the other two books in this series. Also like the other two books, the faith message is practical and applicable to all of us. The story flows naturally and the characters are layered and solidly developed. I really liked Vanessa and Tony’s personalities, had to grit my teeth at Collin a lot (lol), and even learned some Greek! An entertaining story set against beautiful scenery!\n\n(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book which I received from the author. All views expressed are only my honest opinion.)\n\nMy Rating: 4 stars / enjoyed it!\n\naffiliate links used\n\nKatherine Robles enjoys traveling and hiking with her husband and four sons.
