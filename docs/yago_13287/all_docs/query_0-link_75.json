        "text": "On the way to the police station, Carol is feeling pleased with herself while Cindy is worried about Steven. When they arrive they are all informed that they will be held overnight, charged and face court in the morning.\n\nIn the fallout from the riot, the residents of the Square go to the Vic and receive a drink on the house from Peggy. Ruth brings Clare to the Vic where Peggy and Grant can look after her, while Bianca goes to look after Sonia and Billie.\n\nDavid goes home to clean himself up and change his clothes. He discovers the dead cat under Joe's bed. He demands that he get rid of it then goes to the hospital to inform Ian of Cindy's arrest. Joe tells a distraught Nellie that he has found Mandoo and buried her.\n\nSarah tells Phil and Kathy that Joe overheard Pat and Roy talking about the car lot fire. Phil and Kathy go to Pat and Roy's to confront them and Phil loses his temper when Roy reminds him that he is lucky to be alive, unlike the man that burned to death when he set fire to the car lot.\n\nWhile Alan and Nigel discuss the notoriety of the riot and parenting, the women discuss the riot, parenting and relationships. Collectively, they conclude that they should be proud of themselves for standing what they believe in and fighting for their community. Carol and Lorraine bond over their past relationships with David and his inability to be faithful. They talk about his mystery married woman - unaware that it is Cindy. Pauline expresses her upset when Carol talk's about \"community spirit\", forgetting how the community had shunned both Arthur and Mark.\n\nGrant announces a lock in at the Vic and the next morning he finds most of the Square asleep in the bar.\n\nDespite legal advice, Pauline pleads not guilty as do the others. They are all released and return to Albert Square with a round of applause from the residents. Except for Cindy, who goes to the hospital to be with Steven and David."
