        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — The Christian Chronicle has appointed Audrey Jackson as managing editor, a key role overseeing production of the monthly print edition.\n\nJackson, 25, joined the Chronicle as associate editor in August 2021 after her graduation from Harding University in Searcy, Ark.\n\nRelated: The right person to join our news team\n\n“My time at The Christian Chronicle has helped develop my journalistic skills, and I look forward to continuing to grow in this new role,” Jackson said.\n\nA print journalism major, she came to the Chronicle highly recommended by her professors as a skilled, versatile storyteller and photojournalist. She earned straight A’s in her time at Harding and has matched that level of excellence in her work with the Chronicle, Editor-in-Chief Bobby Ross Jr. said.\n\n“Audrey boasts exceptional visual arts skills and has become a key member of the small team that edits and designs the print edition of the Chronicle,” Ross said. “She also played a key role in our first full-scale print redesign in 24 years, a new look we were excited to unveil last month.”\n\nIn her nearly three years with the Chronicle, Jackson has traveled around the world to pursue interesting and important stories, from a COVID-19 hospital ward in Honduras to refugees in Ukraine to impoverished girls in South Africa. She has done on-the-ground reporting and photography on interfaith relations in Israel, Christian education in Australia and faith-based organizations in Turkey.\n\nCloser to home, she has covered tornadoes in Kentucky and Oklahoma, ethnic diversity in Chicago and New York and the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n“Audrey is an editor’s dream journalist and photojournalist — always ready to hit the road and go to the story,” Ross said. “And in all of her work, she adheres to strong moral and ethical standards tied to her strong Christian faith.”\n\n“Audrey is an editor’s dream journalist and photojournalist — always ready to hit the road and go to the story. And in all of her work, she adheres to strong moral and ethical standards tied to her strong Christian faith.”\n\nErik Tryggestad, the Chronicle’s president and CEO, also praised Jackson’s work.\n\n“It was a real coming-of-age moment for me when we hired someone who, when I started working for the Chronicle, was 2 years old,” Tryggestad said. “But Audrey jumped in like a seasoned pro and made herself an indispensable part of what we do here. She’s innovative and tenacious. It’s been so much fun watching her get invested in this ministry and make it better.”\n\nJackson’s Aussiedoodle (Australian shepherd/poodle mix), Gandalf, spends most of his days in the Chronicle’s offices and serves as the staff’s emotional support specialist. Tryggestad promoted Gandalf to chief emotional support specialist.\n\n“It seemed only fair,” Tryggestad said. “I didn’t want to create any disparity or friction in the Jackson household. And Gandalf truly is a good boy.”"
