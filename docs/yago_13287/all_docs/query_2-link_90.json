        "text": "The saying goes, that beyond every great man, is a great women. That statement continues to ring true in the Jackson story. This exploration of Faith would not be complete without mentioning the women. Stephanie Jackson, wife of Dean Jackson and mother of of five children. Eloise Jackson, wife of Jack Jackson, Sr. and mother of four children. In every memory shared from Faith, Carole and Florinda, the recurring theme was family. Rodeo is a labor of love, a family affair, and even the horses become a part of the family. As Florinda, recalls when it comes to rodeo and caring for animals there is a high expectation for all, no matter whether you are female or male. However, as women there is a dual expectation to care for animals and care for the household.\n\nAs a matrilineal society there is a deep responsibility for Diné women to set the tone for the family and these stories of success would not be possible if it were not for the support of women like Stephanie and Eloise Jackson who as educators themselves, raised successful children. It was this ideal that prompted Carole to relocate her family and Faith back to the reservation from Tucson, Arizona when she was in fourth grade. The family moved to Coyote Canyon, New Mexico. As Carole puts it, she wanted Faith to understand who she was and to do that, she needed to get her “home.” It would not have been in Carole’s father teachings, she stated, if her children did not know the Diné way of life. With this new sense of direction, and new involvement with family, Faith soared in her training and in competition.\n\nFaith has a deep understanding of the female influence and notes prominent woman as her heroes - her mother, Carole Jackson Holyan; her aunts Dr. Debbie Jackson Dennison, Charlene Jackson, Deanna Jackson; and her cousin Kassidy Dennison, fellow rodeo champion. She has taken lessons and advice from these powerful women and when she is heading into competition time, she tells herself: score sharp, rope sharp. Keep sharp, Faith. Ahéhee’."
