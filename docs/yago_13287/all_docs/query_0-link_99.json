        "text": "Alan calls the ambulance, which arrives promptly. Huw and Lenny are waiting in the café for Alan to get back, and decide to go to the chippy instead, so go out and see the ambulance. Huw says they should have done something, and Lenny says they didn't know what he'd do. Huw says they knew exactly what Ted was going to do.\n\nIn the Vic, Sanjay is saying that Ted is a saint not to have killed Robbie for what he has done, then someone rushes in and says there's an ambulance outside Robbie's house. Sanjay says \"I don't blame Ted at all, good luck to him, they should never have let Robbie out.\" Tony runs out saying he should have gone with Ted, and Alan shouts at him \"look what he's done!\" The ambulance men restrain Alan, saying there have been enough injuries for one evening.\n\nAlan goes to the hospital with Robbie and mutters to himself that Carol will kill him for letting this happen, and he should have been there for Robbie. Robbie wakes up to scream about a pain in his stomach, and he's taken off for emergency surgery for internal bleeding and to have his spleen removed.\n\nCarol and Bianca return, Carol goes home and discovers the news, while Bianca goes to see Ricky. Ricky tells her that Ted's after Robbie now, and he didn't do anything, and Sarah's obviously unstable and made it all up, because he didn't do anything. He also apologises for losing the £3,000 and says he will get it somehow. Bianca says he doesn't have to, and she's also blown half the wedding money, but she's changed her mind and wants to get married anyway, without the big do. She also says she's sorry and should have given him the chance to explain. Ricky is thrilled.\n\nTed hides from the police and Kathy and Phil see him in the café, and tell him they're looking for him. Phil says he should have been more careful and there are ways of doing these things - get someone else to do it for a start. Ted says he wouldn't have got the satisfaction then. In the Vic later, Phil and Grant discuss what a mess it is and Phil says Ted's so stupid he deserves to go to prison. Lorraine says that Ted was out of order. Grant agrees and said he should have checked with Sarah first. Lorraine is horrified that he seems to condone the action if it's true she was raped. Grant says yes, because rape is unacceptable. Lorraine says she is sick of people justifying Ted's behaviour and Joe could have been the next victim of his shotgun approach.\n\nCarol goes to the hospital and thanks Alan for what he's done. Alan says she has nothing to thank him for and it's all his fault, he's let her down, and Bianca, and now Robbie.\n\nTony sees Ted and tries to get the story straight. He says this is a real mess and Ted shouldn't have done it without knowing what really happened. Ted tells him that Alistair said Robbie did it. Tony asks what he did exactly.\n\nIn the Vic, Carol and Alan arrive and Carol starts having a go at Ted. Peggy tells her to leave, but Grant lets Carol say what she has to. Peggy looks annoyed at being overruled. Carol tells Ted that Robbie didn't \"rape\" Sarah, but he consented to have sex with her and obviously Ted can't accept that she's just like any other girl! Ted is annoyed. Carol says she'll tell the police where he is and let them deal with it. Peggy tells Ted that more than likely the police will turn a blind eye in cases like this. The police arrive shortly and Ted insists he didn't do it. Peggy tells him he should go with them as they are on his side. He says he will sue the police for wrongful arrest, and they point out that they haven't arrested him, but just asked him to go with them to help with their enquiries.\n\nIn the café, Blossom is irritated by Sanjay still being incredibly biased about the \"rape\" and tells him to shut up as he's talking rubbish. Ian comes in and Huw and Lenny go up to him and apologise profusely and ask for a truce, they're fed up with the vendetta. Ian is surprised but agrees and Huw and Lenny turn to each other and say \"Now we'll really get him\" when he's left, as they are still planning some hideous revenge.\n\nAt the hospital Alan and Carol are very close and Alan tells Carol that it is all over with Frankie, and he will never be caught out like that again, he can't believe he fell for it. Carol is non-committal about taking him back and trying again."
