The residents of the Square confront the property developer and when he shrugs the blame to the council, they tear the fences down.\n\nCindy arrives back at the Square and smashes up the developer's car. Pauline hands her a pole but the police stop her before she can do further damage.\n\nThe uprising spills into the Square and in the confusion, Nigel is pushed into a police officer and is promptly arrested. Alan is also arrested when he tries to stop the police from arresting Carol. Cindy, Pauline, Carol, Lorraine, Alan and Nigel are all taken to the police station."
