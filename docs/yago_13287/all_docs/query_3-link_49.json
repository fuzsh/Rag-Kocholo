        "text": "EastEnders' Lindsey Coulson, who plays Carol Jackson, is quitting the soap for the third time.\n\nThe actress, who first arrived in Walford 22 years ago, has said that the \"time is right to move on\".\n\nAppearing on screen way back in 1993 with the Jackson family before leaving after four years.\n\nLindsey, 54, came back to Albert Square very briefly in 1999 which coincided with on-screen daughter Patsy Palmer's exit as Bianca.\n\nShe then made a full-time comeback in 2010 before making her announcement that she would be once again leaving EastEnders.\n\nLindsey told the Daily Star on Sunday: \"I've had a fantastic time playing the formiddable Carol Jackson and although I miss everything about EastEnders, I feel the time is right to move on.\"\n\nAs Carol Jackson, Lindsey has had some fantastic story lines during her time on the soap including her award-winning performance when her son Billie died from alcohol poisoning.\n\nLindsey picked up the Best Dramatic Performance at the British Soap Awards back in 2011 for her emotional scenes when her son died at his 22nd birthday party.\n\nIn 2012 Michael French returned as Carol's childhood sweetheart David Wicks and the pair enjoyed a short-lived reunion before David suffered a heart attack on their wedding day.\n\nCarol was also diagnosed with breast cancer, and EastEnders' top boss Dominic Treadwell-Collins expressed his delight that the actress decided to sign on for an extra year to play out the storyline.\n\nHe added: \"The door will always be open for Lindsey to return to EastEnders. EastEnders has always been so lucky to have an actress of Lindsey's calibre to return to EastEnders.\""
