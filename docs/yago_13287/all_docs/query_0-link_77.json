        "text": "Though English-born, Carole Shelley spent almost her entire award-winning career in the theatre in America, becoming one of Broadway's mainstays and a true pioneer of the American theatre.\n\nShelley was born in London, England, to Deborah (Bloomstein), an opera singer, and Curtis Shelley, a composer. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Carole stayed busy on all fronts in the entertainment industry in films, television and, of course, the live stage. Her Broadway credits include \"The Odd Couple\" (her Broadway debut) playing the hilarious Gwendolyn Pigeon, the intended blind date for the hapless Felix, a role she reprised for the film Ein seltsames Paar (1968) and in the later television series (Männerwirtschaft (1970). Also on Broadway, she starred in \"The Miser\", \"Stepping Out\" (Tony nomination), \"The Elephant Man\" (Tony Award, Best Actress), \"Hay Fever\", \"The Norman Conquests\" (LADCC Award), \"Absurd Person Singular\" (Tony nomination) and \"Loot\".\n\nHer national tours include \"Broadway Bound\", \"The Royal Family\" and \"Noises Off\". She also worked off-Broadway, in plays including \"The Film Society\", \"London Suite\", \"The Destiny of Me\", \"Richard II\" (New York Shakespeare Festival), \"Later Life\" (Drama Desk nomination), \"Cabaret Verboten\", \"What the Butler Saw\", \"Little Murders\", \"Twelve Dreams\" (Obie award), \"Tartuffe\".\n\nReturning to London, she replaced Maggie Smith in \"Lettuce and Lovage\" (she had gone to America to star in the Broadway run of the play) in the West End. Always interested in remaining busy, she never turned down a good opportunity for work and acquitted herself admirably, stepping into such long running hits as \"Cabaret\", \"Show Boat\", \"The Last Night of Ballyhoo\" and \"Noises Off\".\n\nShe kept busy in films, too, appearing in Quiz Show (1994), Willkommen in Wellville (1994), Aus dem Dschungel, in den Dschungel (1997), Ein Vermieter zum Knutschen (1991), and provided some delightful vocal characterizations for many Disney animated features: Hercules (1997), Aristocats (1970), Der Glöckner von Notre Dame (1996) and Robin Hood (1973).\n\nCarole Shelley died on August 31, 2018, in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nIn honor of Shelley's work on Broadway the marquee lights of The Gershwin Theatre, The Walter Kerr Theatre, The Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, and The Imperial Theatre were dimmed on September 5, 2018 at 6:45 PM for one minute in her memory.\n\nWhether portraying a glum, withering wallflower, a drab and dowdy housewife, a klutzy maid or a cynical gossip, eccentric character comedienne Alice Ghostley had the ability to draw laughs from the skimpiest of material with a simple fret or whine. Making a name for herself on the Tony-winning Broadway stage, her eternally forlorn looks later evolved as an amusingly familiar plain-Jane presence on TV sitcoms and in an occasional film or two during the 50s, 60s and 70s.\n\nAlice was born in a whistle-stop railroad station in the tiny town of Eve, Missouri, where her father was employed as a telegraph operator. She grew up in various towns in the Midwest (Arkansas, Oklahoma) and began performing from the age of 5 where she was called upon to recite poetry, sing and tap-dance. Spurred on by a high school teacher, she studied drama at the University of Oklahoma but eventually left in order to pursue a career in New York with her sister Gladys.\n\nTeaming together in an act called \"The Ghostley Sisters\", Alice eventually went solo and developed her own cabaret show as a singer and comedienne. She also toiled as a secretary to a music teacher in exchange for singing lessons, worked as a theater usherette in order to see free stage shows, paid her dues as a waitress, worked once for a detective agency, and even had a stint as a patch tester for a detergent company. No glamourpuss by any stretch of the imagination, she built her reputation as a singing funny lady.\n\nThe short-statured, auburn-haired entertainer received her star-making break singing the satirical ditty \"The Boston Beguine\" in the Broadway stage revue \"New Faces of 1952\", which also showcased up-and-coming stars Eartha Kitt, Carol Lawrence, Hogan's Heroes co-star Robert Clary and Paul Lynde to whom she would be invariably compared to what with their similarly comic demeanors. The film version of New Faces (1954)_ featured pretty much the same cast. She and \"male counterpart\" Lynde would appear together in the same films and/or TV shows over the years.\n\nWith this momentum started, she continued on Broadway with the short-lived musicals \"Sandhog\" (1954) featuring Jack Cassidy, \"Trouble in Tahiti\" (1955), \"Shangri-La\" (1956), again starring Jack Cassidy, and the legit comedy \"Maybe Tuesday\" (1958). A reliable sketch artist, she fared much better on stage in the 1960s playing a number of different characterizations in both \"A Thurber Carnival\" (1960), and opposite Bert Lahr in \"The Beauty Part\" (1962), for which she received a Tony nomination. She finally nabbed the Tony trophy as \"featured actress\" for her wonderful work as Mavis in the comedy play \"The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window\" (1965).\n\nBy this time Alice had established herself on TV. She and good friend Kaye Ballard stole much of the proceedings as the evil stepsisters in the classic Julie Andrews version of Cinderella (1957), and she also recreated her Broadway role in a small screen adaptation of _Shangri-La (1960) (TV)_. Although it was mighty hard to take away her comedy instincts, she did appear in a TV production of \"Twelfth Night\" as Maria opposite Maurice Evans' Malvolio, and graced such dramatic programs as \"Perry Mason\" and \"Naked City\", as well as the film Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962). She kept herself in the TV limelight as a frequent panelist on such game shows as \"The Hollywood Squares\" and \"The Match Game\".\n\nEnjoying a number of featured roles in such lightweight comedy fare as My Six Loves (1963) with Debbie Reynolds, Der Mann in Mammis Bett (1968) starring Doris Day, and the Joan Rivers starrer Ja, lüg' ich denn? (1978), she also had a small teacher role in the popular film version of Grease (1978). Alice primarily situated herself, however, on the sitcom circuit and appeared in a number of recurring 'nervous Nellie\" roles, topping it off as the painfully shy, dematerializing and accident-prone witch nanny Esmeralda in Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964) from 1969-1972 (replacing the late Marion Lorne, who had played bumbling Aunt Clara), and as the batty friend Bernice in Sugarbaker's: Mann muss nicht sein (1986).\n\nIn 1978 Alice replaced Dorothy Loudon as cruel Miss Hannigan in \"Annie\", her last Broadway stand. Alice would play the mean-spirited scene-stealer on and off for nearly a decade in various parts of the country. Other musicals during this time included \"Take Me Along\", \"Bye, Bye Birdie\" (as the overbearing mother), and the raucous revue \"Nunsense\".\n\nA series of multiple strokes ended her career come the millennium and she passed away of colon cancer on September 21, 2007. Her long-time husband of fifty years, Italian comedic actor Felice Orlandi died in 2003. The couple had no children.\n\nEllen Corby was born Ellen Hansen on June 3, 1911, in Racine, Wisconsin. She played many uncredited bit parts from the late '20s through the '30s. Ellen would not be seen on the big screen again until 1945 in Cornered (1945). In 1946, she appeared in 14 films, although mostly in small, minor roles. One of them was in the Christmas classic Ist das Leben nicht schön? (1946). One of the highlights of her career came about in 1948 in Geheimnis der Mutter (1948) as Aunt Trina. Ellen garnered a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which was ultimately won by Claire Trevor in Gangster in Key Largo (1948). The Oscar nomination didn't send her to the heights she had hoped. This wonderful actress continued in roles that were mostly minor compared to some of her contemporaries. However, it was television where she would receive the acclaim that had eluded her on the screen. Time after time she played parts that were absolutely outstanding. One of the funniest was as Myrt \"Hubcaps\" Lesh in The Andy Griffith Show (1960). She was the ringleader of a gang that stole cars and then sold them, and she sold Barney Fife a stolen car that turned out to be a real lemon. The series that brought her worldwide recognition, though, was the highly acclaimed Die Waltons (1972) as Esther \"Grandma\" Walton. The role got her Emmy awards in 1973, 1974, and 1975. Although a stroke in 1976 slowed her down, Ellen still made appearances on the series. Her last TV appearance was in 1997 in the TV movie Die Waltons - Nachwuchs für John Boy (1997). On April 14, 1999, Ellen died at the Motion Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. She was 87 years old.\n\nPenny Marshall was born Carole Penny Marshall on October 15, 1943 in Manhattan. The Libra was 5' 6 1/2\", with brown hair and green eyes. She was the daughter of Marjorie (Ward), a tap dance teacher, and Anthony \"Tony\" Marshall, an industrial film director. She was the younger sister of filmmakers Garry Marshall and Ronny Hallin. Her father was of Italian descent, originally surnamed \"Masciarelli,\" and her mother was of German, Scottish, English, and Irish ancestry.\n\nPenny was known in her family as \"the bad one\"... because not only did she walk on the ledge of her family's apartment building, but she snuck into the movies as a child and even dated a guy named \"Lefty.\" She attended a private girls' high school in New York and then went to the University of New Mexico for two and a half years. There, Penny got pregnant with daughter, Tracy Reiner, and soon after married the father, Michael Henry, in 1961. The couple divorced two years later in 1963. She worked as a secretary for awhile. Her film debut came from her brother Garry Marshall, who put her in the movie Der türkisfarbene Bikini (1968) with the talented Debbie Reynolds and James Garner. She also did a dandruff commercial with Farrah Fawcett - the casting people, of course, giving Farrah the part of the \"beautiful girl\" and Penny the part of the \"plain girl.\" This only added to Penny's insecurity with her looks.\n\nShe then married Rob Reiner on April 10, 1971, shortly after getting her big television break as Oscar Madison's secretary, Myrna Turner, on Männerwirtschaft (1970). She also played Mary Richards' neighbor, Paula Kovacks, on Oh Mary (1970) for a couple of episodes. However, her Laverne & Shirley (1976) fame came when her brother needed two women to play \"fast girls\" who were friends of Arthur Fonzarelli and would date Fonzie and Richie Cunningham on Happy Days (1974). Penny had been working on miscellaneous writing projects (\"My Country Tis Of Thee\", a bicentennial spoof for Francis Ford Coppola and \"Paper Hands\" about the Salem Witch Trials) with writing partner Cindy Williams. Cindy happened to be a friend and ex-girlfriend of Henry Winkler's, so Garry asked the two to play the parts of these girls. The audience saw their wonderful chemistry, and loved them so much, a spin-off was created for them.\n\nPenny was well-known as Laverne DeFazio. She and Rob had divorced in 1980. The show ended three years later, half a year after Cindy Williams left the show due to pregnancy (her first baby, Emily, from now ex-husband Bill Hudson)... they wanted Williams to work the week she was supposed to deliver.\n\nSoon after, Penny began directing such films as Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986), Big (1988) and Eine Klasse für sich (1992). Her hobbies included needlepoint, jigsaw puzzles and antique shopping. She was best friends with actress Carrie Fisher and was godmother to Carrie's daughter, Billie.\n\nPenny died at 75 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAbundantly busy and much-loved Asian-American actor who became an on-screen hero to millions of adults and kids alike as the wise and wonderful Mr. Miyagi in Karate Kid (1984), the sparkling Noriyuki Morita was back again dishing out Eastern philosophy and martial arts lessons for Karate Kid II: Entscheidung in Okinawa (1986) and Karate Kid III: Die letzte Entscheidung (1989), and even for Karate Kid 4 - Die nächste Generation (1994). However, putting all that karate aside, the diminutive Morita actually first started out as a stand-up comedian known as the Hip Nip in nightclubs and bars, and made his first on-screen appearance in Modern Millie - Reicher Mann gesucht (1967). He quickly adapted to the screen and showed up in small parts in such comedy films as The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968), alongside Don Knotts, and in Evil Roy Slade (1972) supporting John Astin. He also appeared in such popular series as Sanford and Son (1972) and M*A*S*H (1972).\n\nMorita got his next break playing the often-perplexed restaurant owner Matsho \"Arnold\" Takahashi in 26 episodes of the hugely popular sitcom Happy Days (1974) between 1975 and 1976, and again between 1982 and 1983. Morita was quite in demand on the small screen and also scored the lead in his own police drama Ohara (1987), and guest-starred on other high-profile television series including Magnum (1980), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989) and Allein unter Nachbarn (1998). Although most often used as a minor character actor, he remained consistently busy and occasionally lent his vocal talents to animated features such as Mulan (1998). However, his real strengths lay in portraying slightly oddball or unusual characters in offbeat films. He died at age 73 of natural causes at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 24, 2005.\n\nGenial character comedian Bernie Kopell is undoubtedly best known as Dr. Adam Bricker, doling out sage advice on TV's Love Boat (1977) for its entire run of ten seasons and 250 episodes. He once described the experience as \"a paid vacation. We got to be in 98 countries\". While this may have been his longest engagement on a series, his most memorable comic creation remains the iconic Siegfried in Mini-Max oder die unglaublichen Abenteuer des Maxwell Smart (1965).\n\nBernie was born in Brooklyn, of Ukrainian and Jewish ancestry, as Bernard Morton Kopell to Abraham Bernard Kopell (1905-1965) and his wife Pauline (née Taran, 1911-2011). After finishing high school, he studied at New York University, graduating in 1955 with a bachelor of fine arts.\n\nA year later, Bernie was drafted into the U.S. Navy, happily accepting the opportunity to serve as librarian at the Naval Operations Base, the Naval Air Station at Norfolk, Virginia, and (between 1956-57), aboard the World War II battleship U.S.S. Iowa. He later quipped \"I got to read more books than I'd gotten to read at NYU, so it was just a glorious thing for me.\"\n\nBack in New York after demobilization, Bernie was invited to Los Angeles by fellow NYU alumnus James Drury (of Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962) fame). His first agent turned him down for being 'not handsome enough to be a leading man, not ugly enough to be a heavy.' For a while, he earned a crust as a taxi driver and vacuum cleaner salesman. A chance audition for casting director Marilyn Howard (then Marilyn Bodgen) then led to a small part in an early CBS daytime soap, The Brighter Day (1954), as a Cuban bad guy named Pablo. Bernie's aptitude for dialects impressed TV execs to the extent that he found himself typecast as Mexicans or Puerto Ricans in episodes of Make Room for Daddy (1953), Jack-Benny-Show (1950), Mein Onkel vom Mars (1963) and The Flying Nun (1967). Ultimately, his innate ability to bring levity to any scene earned him numerous guest starring turns on sitcoms like McHale's Navy (1962), Hoppla Lucy! (1962), Petticoat Junction (1963), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962), Run Buddy Run (1966) and Green Acres (1965).\n\nAt the age of 33, Bernie got his first big break, cast as KAOS chief Siegfried in Get Smart by executive producer Leonard Stern. This character, replete with leather jacket, neat moustache and Heidelberg duelling scar, was essentially the primary nemesis of Control agents 86 and 99. Bernie, by his own admission, adopted Siegfried's German accent from an Austrian psychiatrist he was visiting at the time. The character became so popular with fans that the actor would often be asked to sign autographs with the catchphrase \"we don't shush at KAOS, Shtarker\". A classic line from the episode 'Rub-a-Dub-Dub... Three Spies in a Sub' has Siegfried explaining to Don Adams \"As you go through the world of espionage Shmart, you will find that there are the good guys and the bad guys. I happen to be one of the bad guys.\"\n\nIn between Get Smart and Love Boat, Bernie alternated dramatic roles with comic ones, appearing in a wide variety of shows, ranging from Wo alle Wege enden (1969) (as a TV executive), Der Nachtjäger (1974) (Dr. Gravanites) and the live-action CBS children's sitcom The Ghost Busters (1975) (as Dr. Frankenstein) to the Mel Brooks spoof of Robin Hood, Robi Robi Robin Hood (1975) (a recurring role as Alan-a-Dale). He appeared in nine episodes of Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964), variously as the ancient Postlethwaite, aka Mr. Apothecary, the hippie warlock Alonzo, psychiatrists Chomsky and Rhinehouse and the Siegfried clone Baron von Fuchs). Bernie also had a co-starring role in a short-lived 1973 sitcom, Mode, Mädchen und Moneten (1973), as a salesman for a ladies' clothing manufacturer in New York. His more recent appearances have included an ill-fated men's room attendant in Monk (2002), a coroner in Charmed: Zauberhafte Hexen (1998), a hayseed in My Name Is Earl (2005), a Holocaust survivor in Hawaii Five-0 (2010) and a senior citizen in the medical sitcom B Positive (2020).\n\nFor the stage, Bernie has appeared in Los Angeles productions of Death of a Salesman, and, as a Russian peddler, in The 49th Cousin. He had a leading role as Lenny Ganz in the Neil Simon farce Rumors at the Whitefire Theatre, Sherman Oaks (1996-97). As late as 2022, he headlined off-Broadway, alongside Hal Linden, as biblical characters Lou and Bud in Ed. Weinberger's comedy play, Two Jews Talking. Seemingly impervious to age, Bernie continues make regular appearances in films and on TV, albeit in smaller supporting roles. He is an avid tennis player and has hosted pro-celebrity tennis and golf tournaments with proceeds benefiting the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nTap dancing at the age of 16 months, pert and pretty Elinor Donahue has been entertaining audiences for six decades. Born Mary Eleanor Donahue in Tacoma, Washington, on April 19, 1937, she appeared as a radio singer and vaudeville dancer while a mere toddler, then was picked up by Universal Studios at the age of 5.\n\nCast in minor child roles in such pictures as Mister Big (1943), the precocious youngster eventually moved to MGM but didn't attain the juvenile stardom of a Margaret O'Brien or Elizabeth Taylor, whom she supported in both Tanz ohne Ende (1947) and Die süße Falle (1952), respectively. Still and all, Elinor's talent and wholesome appeal was recognized and the 50s brought her into the TV era.\n\nElinor became more accessible, finally winning nationwide \"girl-next-door\" notice in her late teens as the oldest daughter of \"ideal\" parents Robert Young and Jane Wyatt in the classic family show Vater ist der Beste (1954). Suffering more than her share of teen angst, she played Betty (\"Princess\") Anderson from 1954 to 1960.\n\nBy the time the series was finished, Eleanor was blossoming into a pretty, wholesome, romantic ingénue. She became Andy Griffith's first longstanding girlfriend on The Andy Griffith Show (1960) for one season, but then suffered a major slump. She revived in the 70s with steady roles on Männerwirtschaft (1970) (as Tony Randall's girlfriend), Pilot (1977) as a typical sunny mom, and as a guest for countless other shows, including Barnaby Jones (1973), Newhart (1982) and Golden Girls (1985).\n\nAn extremely pleasant personality, she was primarily tapped into playing nice, friendly, non-flashy parts in both lightweight comedy and dramatic. Possessing a suitable voice for commercials and cartoons, she has lately found recurring roles on Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993) and a few soaps, including California Clan (1984) and Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965), the latter in which she played a rare malicious part.\n\nThough she may not have had much of a chance to shine in her career, Elinor has certainly been a steady, reliable player who has not let her fans down with her obvious warmth and pleasing disposition. Into the 90's, guest appearances included \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Coach,\" \"Friends,\" \"Herman's Head,\" \"Ellen,\" \"Cold Case,\" and a recurring role as \"Rebecca Quinn\" on Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993). Her last credits were several appearances as a judge on Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973) in 2010 and a featured role in the film Plötzlich Prinzessin 2 (2004).\n\nThe widow of TV executive producer Harry Ackerman (he was 25 years her senior), whose list of credits included Erwachsen müsste man sein (1957), Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964) and Gidget (1965), and a mother of four sons, Elinor married third husband, contractor Louis Genevrino, in 1992. In 1998, she published a memoir entitled \"In the Kitchen with Elinor Donahue\", in which she relived some of her memories of Hollywood along with providing more than 150 of her top-grade recipes."
