        "text": "Michelle is in high spirits following her kiss with Geoff as she enters the courtroom.\n\nBianca witnesses Alan and Blossom arriving on the Square in the back of a taxi and is quick to inform Carol of what she has seen. Carol heads to Number 25 where she learns that Alan is moving Blossom in with them immediately. Unimpressed, she argues with Alan, making Blossom uncomfortable.\n\nNigel enlightens Phil to a BMW in the Arches. Phil and Grant race over to the Arches, realising Jimmy has set them up to be arrested. Phil gets the car up and running and Grant then drives it away before the police arrive.\n\nThe coroner classes Pete and Rose's deaths as accidental after hearing from a vehicle examiner. Will makes a derogatory remark on the way out of the room, provoking Arthur and Ian, who decide to confront him outside the court. Michelle wonders what is going on when the men are gone for some time and witnesses them arguing with Will. Arthur and Ian do not to tell her what is going on.\n\nDavid pays Ricky the weekly Â£50 that Pat owes to Ian.\n\nBlossom calls a taxi to take her back to her flat but Carol feels bad so stops her going. She gives her Bianca's bedroom and moves Bianca in with Sonia. Bianca is unhappy with the situation, wanting her own bedroom.\n\nJimmy is shocked when Phil and Grant return to the Vic with smug faces. They demand Jimmy turns out his pockets and after getting his money, warn him never to return.\n\nAfter arriving back home, Michelle decides to ask Ian what Will was saying to him outside the courtroom. Arthur intervenes and encourages Michelle to drop the conversation, but she deduces from their behaviour that the crash was not an accident and the Chapmans killed Pete and Rose."
