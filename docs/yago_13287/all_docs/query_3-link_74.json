She was born June 3, 1936, in Long Beach, California, a daughter of Fredrick William and Dona Jane Creer Jackson. Her childhood was spent in Long Beach, California, and at the age of 11,the family moved to Spanish Fork, Utah, where she attended school, graduating from Spanish Fork High School. She married Mark Allen Boyack on October 3, 1956, in the Salt Lake LDS Temple. They have three daughters. She enjoyed gardening and yard work, crafting and sewing. She liked bowling and participated in league play for a while. She loved a clean house and loved to cook for her family. She made excellent homemade candy. She was a cancer survivor, which added to the compassion she already had for others. She was very kind to those in need, visiting the elderly and taking treats to them. She supported her husband’s numerous baseball pursuits. Carol was employed for a time as a secretary at Fritzi’s sewing plant; and, she also worked for Dr. Richard Johnson as a dental assistant. She is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where she was active in a stake Primary presidency, along with various other callings over the years. She loved to serve. Surviving Carol are her daughters: Diane (Jon) Welch, Sue (Dave) Washburn, and Sheri (Rick) Tolley. She is also survived by 10 grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and one on the way; as well as by her sister, Jane Backman. She is predeceased by her parents; husband; and brother, Paul Jackson. We would like to thank Ashford Assisting Living, Dr. Von Welch; and Monique, with First Choice Hospice, for their attentive and tender care of our mother.
