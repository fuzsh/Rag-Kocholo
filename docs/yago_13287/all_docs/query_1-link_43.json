        "text": "Q&A with the Artist\n\nTell us how your work is made.\n\nMany of my table tops feature aluminum inlays that are cut from extruded pieces of aluminum such as solid rods or square hollow tubes. These are glued into drilled holes or matching shapes routed into the table top; then the surface is sanded smooth in a drum sander. My Lace coffee table has inlays of aluminum cut from a sheet of aluminum and inlaid into the wood top. A CNC machine uses a vector file that I create on my computer to cut the aluminum and rout the matching design in the wood.\n\nWhat makes you passionate about the medium you work with?\n\nThe warmth of an exquisite piece of wood in a cool contemporary design -- that to me is a thing of beauty. I never tire of selecting the perfect board for a piece. Some designs call for a straight linear grain; others come to life with just the right curve in the grain. As a furniture designer and maker I am motivated by the thrill and challenge of creating something beautiful that is new and unique. No other experience comes close.\n\nWhat is something unique about you or your practice?"
