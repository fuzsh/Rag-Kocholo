        "text": "Disintegration ‚Äì The Cure (1989 UK)\n\nHonestly, I did not start branching out musically until my freshman year of high school, and by this comment I mean that I was usually that ‚ÄúTop 100 girl/Top 100 Classic Rock girl,‚Äù with a healthy mix of Nirvana and Dave Matthews Band (DMB b/c I had a crush on a guy who loved that band, so duh‚Ä¶ I love them too. But actually yes, they are great! At least the album Crash and their Live at Red Rocks album).\n\nOne of the main contenders on my stellar musical journey was the character Peyton Sawyer from the WB TV show, One Tree Hill. She had the best taste in music, she collected records, she was interesting, she was mysterious, she was sexy in her own way, and I wanted to be just like her. I even bought a leather jacket because she swore by one. After I started watching the show, I learned about bands such as The White Stripes, Pixies, The Cure (which is why we are here), Jimmy Eat World, Ryan Adams, Tegan & Sara and many, many more! *Side note: OTH was one of the first shows that Robert Plant allowed Led Zeppelin songs to be featured. Plant‚Äôs daughter was a fan of the show!* I became so enthralled by the music on this show. It‚Äôs actually quite incredible how each episode featured probably 5 or 6 alt/country/folk songs. I was also watching The OC too which introduced me to Death Cab, Rooney, The Kooks, The Killers, etc. 2000s alt rock was a gateway drug into my music appreciation. Jack White helped to get me deeper in the Zeppelin catalogue.\n\nBut anyways back to The Cure and Peyton Sawyer‚Ä¶ in one of the scenes when Peyton is explaining to her mother when she fell in love with music, she says to her the first time when she heard Disintegration she fell in love with music all over again. And that moment really struck me. I said I fall in love with music over again every day. How can this one record really make that moment much more elaborated? So I sat down and I listened to the record. From start to finish, beginning to end. And by golly, I felt it. I felt what she was talking about, this album really is enchanting, consuming and such a perfect transitional record. All the songs flow so perfectly into each other. The writing is superb, the instruments are perfectly used through out the album. It‚Äôs a real treat to the mind, body and soul. It‚Äôs solemn where it needs to be, it‚Äôs upbeat where it needs to be. It‚Äôs sentimental, precise, and pin-point. So yes, this album makes you fall in love with music all over again. But also, there are other albums that do that too. It‚Äôs just nice to have many options to help bring the music lover back to its roots.\n\nNow Caroline, you might ask, what are these other albums that help bring you back to ‚ÄúPhase 1?‚Äù To the musical blueprints? Well, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm doing. It‚Äôs my goal to listen to all the music I can, so that I can give you, the reader and confidant, records that help to make you fall in love with music all over again, as many times as you can. ‚ú®\n\nSome FAQs:\n\n‚Äì if you like the album Oracle Spectacular by MGMT, you will love this album. Just saying, mane. They are different but have some distinct similarities üíï\n\n‚Äì my favorite songs from the album (even though I recommend that you first listen from start to finish) are as follows:\n\n‚ÄúLovesong‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs so lovely and some of my absolute favorite lyrics of all time. ‚ÄúWhenever I‚Äôm alone with you, you make me feel like I am home again.‚Äù üé∂ it‚Äôs enchanting. I relate these lyrics to my favorite songs and music\n\n‚ÄúFascination Street‚Äù ‚Äì ooooh it‚Äôs so groovy, and so much fun! If you are listening to it on vinyl, it‚Äôs the perfect transition piece from the gorgeous ‚ÄúLovesong‚Äù to the vinyl intermission to the other side of the record ‚ú®\n\n‚ÄúPictures of You‚Äù ‚Äì this song is one of the greatest breakup songs of all time. And it‚Äôs even more relevant in our time period. It talks about how the guy is missing his lover and how the only thing he has are the memories and the pictures of his lover and he wishes he could live in those again üíïüò≠ it‚Äôs very beautiful but yet so heartbreaking at the same time. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs extremely relatable.\n\n‚Äì my copy of Disintegration is the Original US Press, Elektra, 1989.\n\n‚Äì please enjoy this gorgeous album, and let me know what other albums I should test out for this whole, ‚ÄúThey will make you fall in love with music all over again‚Äù campaign I‚Äôm embarking on! I hope you will also join me ü§òüèº\n\nThe 70s in Music ‚Äì 1971, A Brief History and Why It Matters ‚Äî Tequila Tuesday*\n\nYes, I wrote this drunk‚Ä¶ but I hope you all enjoyed my brief history of the 1970! So let‚Äôs get a moving on to the year that is entitled ‚Äúthe best year in Rock N‚Äô Roll history.‚Äù Also, let me note that while binge watching ‚ÄúParenthood‚Äù and writing this blog, both of my worlds have collided. Isn‚Äôt it funny how that happens! No joke, there has been a comment about ‚ÄúWild Horses‚Äù by The Rolling Stones on their 1971 album Sticky Fingers they are recording an album for Ceelo Green in the recording studio Janis Joplin recorded Pearl and I Got Dem Ol Kozmic Blues Again Mama, and Bob Dylan‚Äôs music is constantly playing. No matter what decade you are talking about, Bob Dylan is always a contributor. Well enough with my ramble, let‚Äôs ‚Äúramble on‚Äù to the info you came here to read about‚Ä¶ ü§òüèº\n\nRecord Lingo/Fun Fact: ‚ÄúGatefold‚Äù ‚Äî this means that the record opens up like a book, and their is usually some sort of collage, picture or message located inside the record. This is usually the case on 2 LP records. Because two cardboard slots are needed üôÇ Note: If an album has a gatefold, i will provide the picture!\n\n1971\n\nWhy is it the greatest year? Well I‚Äôll tell you, Rock was on top. The Powerhouses were releasing new music, there was new amazing technology that allowed for new sounds in music, venues were being shut down and new ones were being created, and the genres of music were morphing and changing rapidly getting rid of the previous ‚Äúcanons‚Äù placed on such genres as rock and pop.\n\nMany of the top contenders in rock release records that allow for their new artistic expression of the rock genre. Bands like Jethro Tull and Yes release albums in the progressive rock genre (aka the progression of the psychedelic rock which dabbles in the folk, classical, and jazz music. This usually meant that music was produced more for the listening pleasure rather than for viewing live or dancing to the music. The art was the whole act of recording the song instead of playing the song live). Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Who and Alice Cooper release their hard rock albums. The band T.Rex hits the scene with the release of their electric album introducing a sub-genre called Glam Rock (aka a style of rock that includes outrageous costumes, glitter, hairstyles that were not the initial focus before. Pretty much the artist would be as flamboyant as the world would let them). Elton John releases the album Madmen Across the Water which features his singles ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù and ‚ÄúLevon‚Äù and he starts tittering that Glam Rock sub-genre line. Also, this year John Lennon releases his second studio album Imagine, with the title track as the first single. Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell, and Carole King enter the music scene with their debut albums. Janis Joplin‚Äôs album Pearl is released four months after her passing with the single ‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee‚Äù topping the charts. The Osmond brothers form together their little band and start recording their first record. Bill Withers, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and Sly and the Family Stone hit the funk/soul music scene. Also, the UK and Australian cross-pollinated band The BeeGees comes on the scene. Mid-year, the music industry is rocked with the passing of the great Jim Morrison. He is found dead in the bathtub from apparent drug overdose by his longtime girlfriend. This causes the whole ‚Äúpsychedelic rock‚Äù age to come to a halt. The end of the year calls for the release of a new age artist named David Bowie who releases his album Hunky Dory that includes the song ‚ÄúChanges‚Äù and shows his first attempts at the new Glam Rock sub genre.\n\nSo with all of this being said and the addition of the soundtracks and musicals that were added during this year, this might possibly be the best year of music. Many greats were born, showcased, rose up, and left the earth during that year. But I have a feeling things were just starting and life was about to get even better in the music world. Stay tuned for that narrative üôÉ\n\nOh to be a rock but not to roll‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äì ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven‚Äù by Led Zeppelin (1971)\n\nListed below are all of the albums I own from this beautiful year. **Please note that my collection is growing every day so I will be adding üôÇ\n\nThe Four Symbols or The Fourth Album aka Led Zeppelin IV- Led Zeppelin ‚Äî the band releases their fourth and probably most famous album at the end of the year. This album included the songs ‚ÄúWhen the Levee Breaks‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Dog‚Äù ‚ÄúRock and Roll‚Äù and of course the most famous, overly played ballad but respectfully artistic masterpiece, ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven.‚Äù The album was meant to be unnamed and attempted to be anonymous in order to not be compared to the band‚Äôs previous studio albums. The album now is considered either The Fourth Album or The Four Symbols. As you will notice below, the album artwork reflects this anonymous plea with no trace of the band‚Äôs name, album name, or any credits to the band itself. But the album does include a certain symbol that was chosen by each member of the bands\n\nFavorite Songs\n\n‚ÄúWhen the Levee Breaks‚Äù (my favorite song from this album. The drum is intoxicating and the beat is infectious. That is why it has been used as a backing to a lot of songs ‚Äî see ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Hurt Yourself‚Äù by Beyonc√© feat. Jack White and ‚ÄúRhymin‚Äô and Stealin'‚Äù by the Beastie Boys)\n\n‚ÄúGoing to California,‚Äù ‚ÄúRock and Roll,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Dog,‚Äù and of course ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven‚Äù #classichowcanyounotlikeit\n\nTapestry ‚Äì Carole King ‚Äî I love this album and this artist. She has that unique and enchanting voice. It‚Äôs not overpowering or too much, it‚Äôs always just right. It‚Äôs simple. A lot of these songs were written in collaboration with singer/songwriter James Taylor who later comes to marry one of the artists included in this post (hint it‚Äôs not Carole üòÇ)\n\nFavorite Songs\n\n‚ÄúI Feel The Earth Move‚Äù ‚Äì this was one of my mom‚Äôs favorites growing up. I can remember her singing along to this and taping her feet on the floor while she gets ready. She was always so beautiful and done up after that, so I always think of this song as one of the most beautiful songs in the world.\n\n‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù ‚Äì and this is a good follow-up to that. I like how it it reminds you to ‚Äúget up every morning with a smile on your face and show the world you‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere You Lead‚Äù ‚Äì I mean how can you not LOVE THIS! It‚Äôs the Gilmore Girls‚Äô theme song, another one that reminds me of my mother, whom I love too much! üòò\n\n‚ÄúWay Over Yonder‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman)‚Äù ‚Äî are my other favorites. Wow. This album is just stunning. Please give it a listen.\n\nGolden Bisquits ‚Äì Three Dog Night ‚Äî this album is actually quite unfamiliar with me. Apparently it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbest of‚Äù the first in the band‚Äôs history. I haven‚Äôt really listened to it. This was given to me by my mom‚Äôs boyfriend who loves tons of cool music, so I know I‚Äôll love this! But it‚Äôs next on my list. So I‚Äôll update you on the info when I get to it üòâ here‚Äôs the pic!\n\nQuick Listen Favorites ‚Äî from the first listen they are very California Rock. Use a lot of organ sounding keyboards and simple guitar riffs with strong vocals that mimic that of Jim Morrison from The Doors\n\n‚ÄúMama Told Me (Not to Come)‚Äù ‚Äì very bluesy and with organ keyboards. The sound is very late 60s and early 70s.\n\n‚ÄúEasy to Be Hard‚Äù ‚Äì it sounds very old school, 50s rock ballad, and you‚Äôve got the whole Doors sounding organ keyboard. It kind of has that ‚Äúbring me to church‚Äù chorus\n\n‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù and ‚ÄúTry A Little Tenderness‚Äù ‚Äì covers of both the classics, their version of Try actually chart topped\n\nHistoric Dead ‚Äì The Grateful Dead ‚Äî not very familiar with this album. So I‚Äôm just going to leave this here. I would love to get with a dead head about these Dead albums I have. I don‚Äôt know too much about the band. Only what I‚Äôve read on the internets\n\nMadmen Across The Water -Elton John ‚Äìthis album features one of my favorite Elton John songs ‚ÄúTiny Dancer.‚Äù The songs on this album are the first to feature songwriting crew from Elton‚Äôs friend, Bernie Taupin and the last to feature his longtime band members Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson. Tiny Dancer is iconic and it‚Äôs featured in my favorite movie Almost Famous‚Ä¶ Fun Fact: that one scene after they pick up Robert from the house party in Kansas and they are all on the bus and start singing ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù together is one of my favorite movie scenes and I‚Äôve actually written a paper on that scene for my screenwriting class back in college! Also, another fun fact, they use those familiar chords to contribute to the incidental music in phonic reference to the character Penny Lane. Because she‚Äôs perfect this song is perfect.\n\nFavorite Songs:\n\n‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù and ‚ÄúLevon‚Äù\n\n(Grateful Dead) Skulls and Roses aka Skull F**k ‚Äì Grateful Dead ‚Äî the album with all the names. This album was a compilation album for the Dead. This album had so many names due to the fact that the band wanted the name to be ‚ÄúSkull F**k‚Äù because the record was going to ‚Äúblow the people‚Äôs minds‚Äù but the record company announced that they didn‚Äôt think the record would even be placed on any shelves with that written on the album. So they opted for the album to be printed with no title. This album is recorded live. The songs are carefully selected by the band members. Also, since the ever growing use of recording equipment at their shows, they tried to get the super fans attention by posting an address with ‚ÄúDEAD FREAKS UNITE‚Äù in bold and all caps, in hopes that this would satisfy them and the recorders would just enjoy the shows instead of profiting from them. *note the address no longer works üòÇ\n\nThis album is full of the Dead‚Äôs take on classic country, folk, and bluesy songs. It‚Äôs really a musical treat.\n\nFavorite Songs:\n\n‚ÄúMama Tried‚Äù ‚Äì their rendition of Merle Haggard‚Äôs classic is the perfect cross of blues and country\n\n‚ÄúBertha‚Äù ‚Äì this one is just classic Grateful Dead sounding\n\n‚ÄúBoss Man Blues‚Äù ‚Äì this is a good anthem to listen to on your way home after a long day at work\n\n‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee‚Äù ‚Äì I love this song, and their cover of it is phenomenal and simple\n\nSticky Fingers ‚Äì The Rolling Stones ‚ÄîFun Fact: I saw almost all of these songs performed live at The Rolling Stones Zip Code Tour in Nashville, July 2015. It was the anniversary of their album and they showcased it. Oh, I was also SIXTH row üòç\n\nI love this album because it has roots to my home. First of all, the song ‚ÄúWild Horses‚Äù was recording in the famous Jackson Highway Recording Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (about two hours from where I live). They just reopened the studio for viewing back in Jan of this year and I‚Äôve yet to make it there but it‚Äôs on my bucket list. When this song was recorded the band was filming their feature film documentary Gimme Shelter and they actually played footage of the song and didn‚Äôt release the name of it or give any indication of it even ever being released. When they released Sticky Fingers in April, that was the first time the song had been ‚Äúnamed.‚Äù\n\nFavorite Songs:\n\n‚ÄúWild Horses‚Äù ‚Äî you can also check out the wicked version of this song sung by The Sundays. This is the song that Angel and Buffy dance to at Buffy‚Äôs prom, their ‚Äúlast‚Äù dance together. The perfect emotional song for one of the saddest moments on television üò≠\n\n‚ÄúBrown Sugar‚Äù and ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù great funky ballads that you really can‚Äôt help but sing a long to, be careful they will stick in your head\n\n‚ÄúDead Flowers‚Äù this song is one of my favorites due to the fact that he is crying out to the crowd about those ppl who will love you to your face but ‚Äúgive you dead flowers at your wedding.‚Äù He fires back with the line ‚ÄúI wont forget to put roses on your grave.‚Äù\n\nAnticipation ‚Äì Carly Simon ‚Äî yep you guessed it, this beauty comes to marry James Taylor in the years ahead. This album is a narrative of her state of mind while she awaits her first date with famed musician Cat Stevens. So the entire album is about her over-analyzing the effects this is going to have on her when she goes with the musician on a date. The ending track is the perfect closing to the album in which she pleads to the musician that she‚Äôs got to have him in her life. I love this album because she really captures the emotions and anticipation you get before going out and meeting someone for the first time, and the emotions of dating and getting to know someone. Especially, getting to know yourself while getting to know someone.\n\nFavorite Songs:\n\n‚ÄúAnticipation‚Äù ‚Äì the title track is a very simple track that chronicles the singer‚Äôs plea for her lover to stay with her throughout the rest of the day. ‚ÄúThese are the good ole days.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve Got to Have You‚Äù ‚Äì this song is my favorite because it is simple and romantic. It was written by Kris Kristofferson (the songwriter of ‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee‚Äù) so it kind of has that same feel of desperation but a lot more muted and suited for the calming voice that is Carly Simon.\n\nFavorite Songs:\n\nPearl ‚Äì Janis Joplin ‚Äî there really is so little yet so much I can say about this album. It‚Äôs phenomenal, it‚Äôs the perfect tribute and salute to the late great Janis. It features the beautiful story telling song of ‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee‚Äù about her torrid love affair with a roadie that ends with heartache and desperation. The thing I love about this album is how it showcases all over musical talents. Her voice, her instrumental work, and her songwriting. She was taken way too soon from this world. This album is a precious ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù and a must for any record collector.\n\nFavorite Songs:\n\n‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee‚Äù ‚Äì her long breathy vibrato at the end of the song makes the whole cinematic journey of the song worth it\n\n‚ÄúMercedes Benz‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy Baby‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA Woman Left Lonely‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFeelin‚Äô good was easy Lord, when ‚ÄúJanis‚Äù sang the blues.‚Äù\n\nThe following artists entered the scene during 1971: Earth, Wind and Fire, Foghat, New York Dolls, Sister Sledge, Wings, The Charlie Daniels Band, Carly Simon, Rita Coolidge, Thin Lizzy, The Doobie Brothers, REO Speedwagon, Bonnie Raitt, ELO, America\n\nThe following bands dis-banded in 1971: Derek and the Dominos and The Monkees #RIP\n\nThe following music artistic entered the world during this wonderful year: Mary J Blige, Kid Rock, Jonathan Davis (koRn), Questlove, Lil Jon (YEAH!), Sara Evans, Erykah Badu, Max Martin (the Grammy award winning producer of Britney Spears and Taylor Swift‚Äôs 1989 and many more), the other 2/3s of TLC (Lisa ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù Eye and Chili), Timberland, Missy Elliott, Marky Mark, Tupac, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Alison Krauss, DJ Spinderella, ‚ÄúSit me next to Fred Durst‚Ä¶‚Äù, Bone Crusher (who is NEVA scared), Boy Banders Kevin Richardson (BSB) and Chris Kirkpatrick (NSYNC), Snoop Doggy Dog, Ricky Martin (he started Living La vida Loco), Dido\n\nBut the following artists left this beautiful world during 1971: Jim Morrison of The Doors, Louis Armstrong, Duane Allman and King Curtis #RIP\n\nThe 70s in Music ‚Äì 1970, A Brief History and Why It Matters\n\nAlrighty all, I meant to start this at the beginning of July and do a post each day for the first nine days of the month to correspond with the day of the month and year (aka 7/1 = 1971) but I am way behind! I will, however, do this next month for the 80s, so please hold me accountable! Ok, so with all that being said, lets start this now.\n\n1970\n\nThe year was 1970, and people were loving the new age music that was brewing. The ‚Äúpoppy rock‚Äù of the 60s evolved into this more intense psychedelic rock of the 60s and bands were either going with the country rock genre or the dark heavy metal rock (aka Ozzy Osborne‚Äôs Black Sabbath releases their first album naming it the first heavy metal rock record ever). ‚ÄúFree-Form Rock‚Äù was now sweeping the nation. The world had just experienced Woodstock and they needed rock more than ever. With this changing rock, though, this led to a major change in the lives of musicians who were currently producing music. Eric Clapton left his band Cream to pursue a more mellow and acoustic band Derek and the Dominos. Keith Moon, of The Who, was over-drinking and the media was becoming more involved. When these two worlds collided it results in Moon accidentally killing his chauffeur. Paul McCartney publicly announces the break-up of the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix leaves his ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù and starts up a disastrous band known as ‚ÄúBand of Gypsys.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt last long due to the fact the band members cannot get along with each other. Grace Slick, the gorgeous voice behind Jefferson Airplane (listen to the song White Rabbit and remember the scene in Big Little Lies where Ziggy and Jane sing to it in the car) is invited to a White House tea but gets carried out due to attempting to lace Tricia Nixon‚Äôs tea with LSD.\n\nThe year ends with a bang, with the premier of The Rolling Stones documentary film, Gimme Shelter. This film follows the band on their tour which ends with the diasterous Altamont Free Concert that led to the death of four civilians, supposedly caused by the Hells Angels, a motorcycle gang that was hired to guard the band. This film also features Keith Richards and Mick Jagger recording the song ‚ÄúWild Horses‚Äù at the famous Jackson Highway recording studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (not far from where I live üòä). Also, this is the year we lost two of Rock N‚Äô Roll‚Äôs greatest, Jimi Hendrix (died of asphyxiation in his sleep due to the overdose of sleeping pills) and Janis Joplin (died of an overdose of drugs). #forever27s\n\nThe bands Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Jefferson Airplane (a sub-band of Jefferson Starship‚Äî my favorite song of theirs is the theme song to Wet Hot American Summer, entitled ‚ÄúJane‚Äù), the duo Tony Orlando and Dawn, Black Sabbath, Leon Russell, Carole King, J Geils Band, and Black Sabbath all entered the music scene during this year. The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, The Foundations, Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Peter, Paul & Mary all exited the music scene.\n\nThe following musicians were born during this year: Edwin McClain (I‚Äôll Be), Minnie Driver, Kirk Franklin (gospel singer superstar), Queen Latifiah, Mariah Carey, Redman, T-Boz (one third of TLC), Brian ‚ÄúHead‚Äù Welch (koRn ‚Äî the guitarist who is a born again Christian), Rivers Cuomo (lead singer of Weezer), Beck, Fat Joe, River Phoenix, Macy Gray, DMX\n\nPicture below is all of the albums I own that were released this year!\n\nBand of Gypsys by Jimi Hendrix ‚Äì the only album created by Jimi and his band of Gypsys. He died later that year. *this album was included in a box of 15 records I got from ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù one year üôÇ They were purchased in a San Diego record store and carefully selected for yours truly!\n\nFavorite Songs: Machine Gun (has that whole Voodoo Child Slight Return feel), Power to Love (the guitar in this is killer, but then again it is Jimi)\n\nMoondance by Van Morrison ‚Äì quite possibly one of the most beautiful records ever produced. His voice is the most enticing in this album. It‚Äôs like magic to your ears. Even though the album and sleeve are not in the best condition, it‚Äôs one of my favorite pressings ever. It really does something to your soul when you hear Mr. Morrison on wax.\n\nWatertown by Frank Sinatra ‚Äì a beautiful concept album that follows the story of a man in a small town. Haven‚Äôt really listened to it much, Frank Sinatra is great, but not one of my all time faves. This album was included in a lot of over 100 records I received from a kind friend of a friend\n\nFavorite Songs: Watertown, Goodbye (She Quietly Says)\n\nLet It Be by The Beatles -their final record, even though most people consider Abbey Road their final album, this was released after their breakup announcement and included a feature film with the album. This album was actually recorded before Abbey Road and all the songs were recorded to sound as if they were performed live, no studio effects or overdubbing. *bought this for $1 at 2nd and Charles\n\nFavorite Songs: Across the Universe (one of my favorites and this song is very cinematic), Let It Be (this song is probably one of the greatest songs ever written), The Long and Winding Road, Get Back (such a fun and upbeat song)\n\nLed Zeppelin III by Led Zeppelin ‚Äì this album features a wheel that is able to be turned and change the little pictures in the album cover. Jimmy Page used this opportunity to show his versatility as a guitarist showing that he could ace the heavy metal riffs and kill it on the acoustic ones just the same. *One of the first albums I bought, I won it on eBay\n\nFavorite Songs: Since I‚Äôve Been Loving You (my favorite of Led Zeppelin‚Äôs 70s music, this is a beautiful, desperate love ballad that is intoxicating), Friends, Gallows Pole, and of course Immigrant Song (its a classic Zep song, and everyone needs to have it in their music library), Tangerine, That‚Äôs the Way\n\n‚Äã ‚Äã\n\nTumbleweed Connection by Elton John ‚Äì one of my favorite Elton John albums, the songs are more folky and hometown feeling. It‚Äôs definitely a different style for the flamboyant John (which technically at this point he hadn‚Äôt really shown this side of him ‚Äî his true self). *i bought this at a local record store in bham üôÇ\n\nFavorite Songs: My Father‚Äôs Gun, Where to Now St. Peter?, Love Song, Country Comfort (this ballad is very much familiar sounding but also, very unique sounding too)\n\nAmerican Beauty by the Grateful Dead ‚Äì probably their most popular studio album. It‚Äôs iconic and has some of their best songs (well more known songs). This album is full of the steel guitar and acoustic guitar riffs with country rock and also that California folk and psych rock that is more familiar to those during this time period. *this record I won on a contest on Instagram from vinylthingsclub\n\nFavorite Songs: Box of Rain, Sugar Magnolia, Ripple, Candyman, Truckin‚Äô\n\nLayla and Other Assorted Love Songs by Derek and the Dominos ‚Äì my favorite album from Eric Clapton because Layla is one of my favorite songs. This album was recorded in Miami with a group of Southern musicians that includes Eric Clapton and Duane Allman. Most of the songs consist of guitar solo duels between Clapton and Allman. This makes for a very unique and interesting sounding album. GUITAR, GUITAR, and more GUITAR. *I bought this record at Magnolia Records in Marietta, GA\n\nFavorite Songs: Layla (the guitar solo, the lyrics, the emotion and power of this song is so unique and empowering. Making it one of the greatest ballads ever written and performed), Bell Bottom Blues (showcases the sweeter guitar riffs between Allman and Clapton), Little Wings, Have You Ever Loved a Woman? (the first few seconds kind of sound like something‚Ä¶ ;))\n\nWhen summarizing the year of 1970, you have to remember all the shifts that rock music was taking during this year. The genres were merging and rock was taking over in all genres. You could now have poppy rock, bluesy rock, heavy metal rock, country rock, and all the major contenders were taking advantage of this new ‚Äúfree-form‚Äù rock. We lost a lot of the greats but even more of the greats were born.\n\nWorkout Wednesday\n\nWelcome to hump day, love bugs! It is that awkward day in the middle of the week that we all feel as though we are so close yet so far to the weekend. So on this day, I want to share a little bit with you guys about my life and how music has changed everything in my life (so like the premise of everything in my life).\n\nFirst of all, I graduated college back in December of 2014. I was then the largest (weight wise) that I have ever been. I was uncomfortable all the time. I did not love myself the way I was supposed to love myself and after months of sitting in the skin I hated, I decided I needed to do something about it. Working out had always been a chore to me. I hated it beyond measure and I could not even phantom going to the gym, and one of the reasons why is because I could not stay focused enough. So, on November 16th, 2015, I sat down and made myself a list of things I wanted to achieve and how I was going to achieve them.\n\nThe first thing I put on that list was make a playlist. And guess what, I did just that! After I made that killer playlist, I went and bought myself a pair of Bose sport headphones and I pulled up my Popsugar.com app and I got on the elliptical. Since that day in November, I have lost a total of 36 lbs. It‚Äôs been a slow but very rewarding journey. But I owe it all to my gym playlist (& the evolution of that playlist!)\n\nOne thing I have realized about myself is that while doing cardio (because its my least favorite and hardest to motivate myself) that I have to listen to my music at full blast and have something on a television in front of me. Thankfully, at my gym they have a cardio cinema where they play a movie on a movie theater screen and I am able to see the subtitles and listen to my own music. This helps me kind of distract myself from the time period I am spending on the cardio machine. My favorite movies to watch while working out are action movies, especially ones that have those long climaxing scenes or fight scenes! It makes me run faster.\n\nLately, my favorite music to run to has been metal music. Like Breaking Benjamin, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Rage Against the Machine, Led Zeppelin, Slipnot, koRn, etc. any band that has long guitar solos that make you feel as though you are running on top of the notes of the song. I actually got more into listening to metal music because I was training for a half marathon. I needed music that wasn‚Äôt consistent and had changes in pace and fluidity. I found metal/hard rock music is more like that. I used to workout mostly to rap music, but the beat is consistent and usually there isn‚Äôt much change in the pace. Rap Music is my favorite type of music to do weights, abs, and squats to.\n\nAlright, well with all of that being said, now for the fun part! Here is a list of my favorite songs to workout to and what kind of workout is best with each song!\n\nOk so I‚Äôm only going to focus on my favorite cardio songs today. I will hit on other playlists for different workouts in the weeks to come!\n\n*** Try this: Play the song ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Feel My Face‚Äù by the Weeknd ‚Äî do regular sit-ups from the start of the song to the time the chorus (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel my face when I‚Äôm with you‚Ä¶‚Äù) comes on, and when the chorus hits do bicycles until the end of the chorus and repeat this throughout the entire song üôÇ Thx Gabriella for this genius idea!!! U my girl!\n\nFavorite Albums for Cardio ‚Äî Sometimes just listen to an entire album while I run for 45 to 60 mins, these are my favorite below\n\nWatch the Throne ‚Äì Kanye West & Jay Z ‚Äî this album is great for the different paces. And the fast pace songs are more towards the middle of the album, so it won‚Äôt allow you to lose your momentum. Yes, this album gets its creds in the Hip Hop & Rap genre but the album features many different types of genres. I like to compare this to Beastie Boys ‚ÄúLicense to Ill.‚Äù\n\nRide the Lightning ‚Äì Metallica ‚Äî honestly any of the first five Metallica albums are good, but I chose this one because it‚Äôs my favorite ü§òüèºThe thing I love about Metallica is that their songs have so many different paces. They usually start off fast, and then go into long guitar solos. In my opinion, the perfect running songs/albums\n\nLemonade ‚Äì Beyonc√© & Beyonc√© ‚Äì Beyonc√© ‚Äî both albums are kind of setup the same with perfect pace songs at the beginning for the warmup and then fast songs in the middle and slower songs at the end for that perfect slow down.\n\nMy Dark Twisted Beautiful Fantasy ‚Äì Kanye West ‚Äî I mean it‚Äôs Kanye. It‚Äôs epic, it‚Äôs his best album, and it‚Äôs perfect for the elliptical workouts, especially Monster when you wanna climb that high incline and high resistance. ‚ÄúHell of a Life‚Äù kind of allows for you to pace yourself but the chorus has that whole ‚Äúcadence chant‚Äù vibe. That base line is killer but also consistent. This is when I really hit that incline.\n\nBoston ‚Äì Boston ‚Äî the guitar solos, the fast pace, if you want to sprint the entire time on your run, like if you just want to kill it out of the fences, you listen to this album. This keeps its pace and pretty much allows for the perfect sweat fest!\n\nCoin ‚Äì COIN ‚Äî this indie alternative band really rocks!!! I‚Äôm so glad I happened upon this album a year ago. The song ‚ÄúRun‚Äù is perfect for that cardio and the rest of the album is very high tempo and the pace varies just enough to provide a perfect pace for long distance running!\n\nFavorite Songs for Cardio ‚Äî here‚Äôs a list (playlist) of my favorite songs\n\nWarm Up/ Cool Down Songs ‚Äî ‚ÄúEverlasting Light‚Äù by the Black Keys, ‚ÄúNo Sleep Til Brooklyn‚Äù by Beastie Boys, ‚ÄúComedown‚Äù by Bush, ‚ÄúFeels‚Äù by Kiiara, ‚ÄúDiet Mountain Dew‚Äù by Lana Del Rey, ‚ÄúSigns of Times‚Äù by Harry Styles , ‚ÄúNo Scrubs‚Äù by TLC, ‚ÄúCool Girl‚Äù by Tove Lo\n\nFade to Black ‚Äì Metallica\n\nOne ‚Äì Metallica\n\nI Want it All ‚Äì Queen\n\nSeek & Destroy ‚Äì Metallica\n\nPolyamorus ‚Äì Breaking Benjamin\n\nSorry Not Sorry ‚Äì Demi Lovato\n\nCountdown ‚Äì Beyonce\n\nSchoolin Life ‚Äì Beyonce\n\nGet Me Bodied ‚Äì Beyonce\n\n7/11 ‚Äì Beyonce\n\nDiva ‚Äì Beyonce\n\nMonster ‚Äì Kanye West feat.

Ok, so I have been listing out possible themes for the week for many weeks now. And I am finally able to compile a list of what I want to do on this blog!\n\nEach week I will feature an Album of the Week (there will be a corresponding Instagram post for this).\n\nMondaze ‚Äì Metal Monday, Music Video Monday, Motivational Monday, Man Crush Monday (Men in Music)\n\nTuesdaze ‚Äì T-Shirt Tuesday, Twinning Tuesday (will explain on my first post), Turntable Tuesday, Tequila Tuesday (I get drunk and blog)\n\nWednesdaze ‚Äì Workout Wednesday, Wacky Wednesday (discuss myths and legend stories in music history), Hump Day Humor (lol. you‚Äôll see for this one), Woman Crush Wednesday (Women in music), Wine Wednesday (I get drunk and blog)\n\nThursdaze ‚Äì Throwback Thursday (nostalgic piece about why a selection is so important, will more than likely go through my favorite songs)\n\nFridaze ‚Äì Fresh Music Friday (new music that has been released, I will review and also discuss music history that has happened throughout the week), Friyay Friday\n\nSaturdaze ‚Äì this will be my break day!

Music is the glue that ties me together. It has gotten me through the most difficult and the happiest moments in my life. I read an article the other day (actually after Chris Cornell died) stating that you should not judge someone for mourning someone they have never met (a music artist or just extremely influential person in your life). Even though you have never shaken their hands or seen them face to face, you have entered their minds, heard their hearts and you have established an intimate bond with the artist.\n\nMusic connects people. Music lets you escape. Music takes you to places you cannot reach yourself. Music is magic. Music is special. Music is important.\n\nMy favorite artists are extremely hard for me to narrow down. My parents raised me on every genre of music you can even imagine. I realized from an early age that you should not limit yourself to certain genres. That is why I have created this blog because I want to be able to share my love for music with everyone and not limit my favorites. I will use the phrase ‚Äúfavorite song,‚Äù ‚Äúfavorite artist,‚Äù and ‚Äúfavorite album‚Äù way too many times and but that does not mean that I am being indecisive. At that moment and time, they are my favorite.\n\nI really hope you enjoy this blog. Peace, Love and Rock N Roll {and all the other genres of music}! XOXO"
