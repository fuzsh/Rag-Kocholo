        "text": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are defined as series of traumatic events experienced before adulthood, such as abuse, neglect, family dysfunction, or exposure to neighborhood violence.1 Authors of an early ACE study, conducted by Felitti et al,2 reported that ACEs were present across all demographic groups and had cumulative negative effects on an individual's health. Since then, many studies have demonstrated an association between ACEs and negative health outcomes throughout the life course, in particular an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).3–5 Relatedly, inadequate sleep is linked to negative health outcomes6,7—and again, an increased risk for CVD8; this is also true for excessive sleep leading to higher CVD in adults.9 This recognition has led to the recent inclusion of sleep health as an additional indicator along with the 7 previous indicators in the American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Essential 8.10 The AHA Life's Essential 8 includes 8 indicators to assess and track an individual's cardiovascular health: body mass index, physical activity, diet, nicotine exposure, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and sleep duration.\n\nAuthors of population-based studies have reported a positive association between ACEs and age-specific insufficient sleep duration for youth.11–14 However, authors of these existing studies in youth populations have only examined the effect of (1) each ACE independently or (2) a cumulative count of experienced ACEs on sleep11–14 but have not examined the effects of household-based versus community-based ACEs, with location being a subdomain. Examining these subdomains may provide important insights into understanding how specific types of ACEs can affect sleep outcomes. For example, do household-based ACEs such as domestic violence have a stronger impact than community-based ACEs such as neighborhood violence? Currently, minimal data exist regarding the association with ACEs subdomains. Such information may help to inform interventions so they can effectively target those ACEs that have the greatest impact.\n\nThere are 3 further dimensions of sleep that should be considered: specificity of duration, dose-response, and age as a modifier.15 Previous work examining the relationship between ACEs and sleep duration in youth has been limited to the use of a binary measurement for sleep duration: whether or not youth meet guideline criteria.6,16 Moreover, previous reports lack investigation into whether there is a dose-response relationship between number of ACEs and sleep duration, and the vast majority of the existing literature has focused primarily on insufficient, but not excessive, sleeping durations. Finally, authors of few previous research examined the influence of age on the relationship between ACEs and sleep duration in youth. Information about the influence of age may be critical, because sleep needs change drastically as children age. For example, Harada et al14 reported that (1) for children aged 6 to 12 years, as ACE score increased, the odds of engaging in adequate sleep significantly decreased; (2) likewise, for children aged 13 to 17 years with fewer than 4 ACEs, the odds of engaging in adequate sleep significantly decreased as the ACE score increased; and (3) for children aged 13 to 17 years with 4 to 6 ACEs, the odds for inadequate sleep decreased as ACEs increased. Thus, further studies are necessary to better understand the influence of age on the association between ACEs and sleep duration. By using an instrument that allows for more specific classifications of sleep (ie, shorter or longer than ideal) by age groups, such as the AHA Life's Essential 8 scoring criteria,10 and including ACE counts higher than 6 (up to 10), a more robust evaluation of the association between ACEs and sleep duration in children can be performed. Thereby, more informed strategies to mitigate poor sleep can be developed to prevent CVD risk during childhood and adolescence.\n\nWe investigated whether the cumulative number of exposures to 10 ACEs, as well as whether subdomains of ACEs (household based vs community based), was associated with sleep duration. Furthermore, we examined whether the associations differ by child's age group (6–12 and 13–17 years). Our goal was to provide insight into ACEs as an indicator for suboptimal sleep, which in turn is a risk factor for CVD. To better understand the influence of ACEs on sleep duration, we also sought to examine whether the association between subdomains of ACEs and suboptimal sleep is equally important or which may be of greater importance. Finally, our assessment of differential impact of ACEs across age groups may guide identification of particular age groups requiring focused attention to effectively reduce both immediate and long-term behavioral, physical, and mental health problems associated with sleep health throughout childhood. The overall hypothesis of our study is that, for each additional ACE, the likelihood of suboptimal sleep duration increases regardless of the subdomain of ACEs and child's age.\n\nMethods\n\nData Source and Study Population\n\nThis study used a cross-sectional design and data from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), a national study conducted by the US Census Bureau on behalf of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The NSCH aims to gather data on various aspects of children's health and well-being.17 Previously, the survey was conducted every 5 years from its beginning in 2003 until 2016. Since 2016, the survey has been conducted annually as a cross-sectional, address-based survey with both web-based and mail (paper-and-pencil) data collection options available. Surveys were available in both English and Spanish.\n\nThe 2020–2021 combined NSCH contained 2 data sets with the same variables across both years. Households were randomly sampled and contacted by mail to identify children younger than 18 years, with 1 child from each household randomly selected for participation. The survey oversampled children with special healthcare needs and children 0 to 5 years old. The combined data sets for 2020 and 2021 included a total sample of 93 669 children. The overall weighted response rate was 42.4% for 2020 and 40.3% for 2021.18 The sample was weighted to generate state and national estimates of the population, and key health indicators of noninstitutionalized children ages 0 to 17 years in the United States. For this current analysis, we included a study sample of children aged 6 to 17 years. This age group was chosen because the newly added item to the 2020–2021 survey regarding ACEs (if the child has ever experienced being treated or judged unfairly because of their sexual orientation or gender identity) and a health behavior of interest (physical activity) were limited to this age range. Furthermore, the method of capturing overall sleep duration differs between children aged 6 to 17 years (using average hours of sleep per night) versus children aged 0 to 5 years (using average hours of sleep per 24 hours); thus, we limited our analysis to children aged 6 to 17 years.\n\nWe used the list-wise deletion method and excluded children based on missing data for child's sex, age, race/ethnicity, household income level, ACEs, habitual bedtime, physical activity, and adult (parents or guardians) education, as well as our outcome variable, sleep duration. There were no missing cases for the variables of sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income level (a variable being derived using a single imputation method).18 The proportion of missing cases of all other variables included in this analysis was less than 2.0%, with ACEs having the highest proportion of missing cases (1.84%). Our final analytic sample included 58 964 US children.\n\nMeasures\n\nSleep Duration\n\nProxy adults (children's parents or guardians) were asked, “During the past week, how many hours of sleep did this child get on most weeknights?” with response options of <6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or ≥11 hours. On the basis of the AHA scoring algorithm (which assigns a score ranging from 0 [lowest] to 100 [highest], with 100 points as optimal), the participants can be divided into 6 groups (0, 20, 40, 70, 90, 100).10 However, in the distribution of proxy-reported sleep duration, none of the participants fell into 2 of the categories: those sleeping less than 1 hour above the optimal range (score of 90) and those sleeping less than 1 hour below the optimal range (score of 70). Thus, we did not include those 2 categories in our analysis. In addition, because few participants fell into the category of ≥3 hours below the optimal range (score of 0) or the category of 2 to <3 hours below the optimal range (score of 20), we combined those 2 groups into a single group. Therefore, our participants were divided into 3 exclusive subgroups: (1) those meeting age-appropriate, optimal sleep duration (score of 100), (2) those who reported ≥1 to <2 hours below or ≥1 hour above optimal sleep duration (score of 40), and (3) those who reported ≥2 hours below optimal sleep duration (score of 20 or 0). In this article, we named these 3 subgroups as “optimal,” “suboptimal,” and “very suboptimal,” respectively. It is worth noting that optimal sleep duration was 9 to 12 hours for children aged 6 to 12 years and 8 to 10 hours for those aged 13 to 18 years based on the AHA scoring algorithm.\n\nAdverse Childhood Experiences\n\nThe 2020–2021 NSCH included questions regarding 10 ACEs. Respondents indicated whether their child had ever experienced any of the following: financial hardship (inability to cover basic expenses); parental divorce/separation; parental death; parental imprisonment; domestic violence; neighborhood violence; living with a mentally ill, suicidal, or severely depressed person; living with someone who had a problem with alcohol or drugs; experiencing unfair treatment because of their race/ethnicity; and unfair treatment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity (the last item was added to the NSCH starting in 2020).\n\nTo capture the cumulative effect of these ACEs, consistent with methods commonly used in previous studies,19–21 a total number of ACE exposures was created by summing the number of ACEs experienced by each child, ranging from 0 to 10. Furthermore, the NSCH provided 2 subdomain variables: household-based and community-based ACEs. The household-based ACE composite measure included 6 items related to parental divorce/separation, parental death, parental imprisonment, witnessing or experiencing domestic violence, and living with someone with mental health issues or substance abuse problems. The community-based ACE composite measure included 3 items related to witnessing or experiencing neighborhood violence, unfair treatment based on race/ethnicity, and unfair treatment based on sexual orientation/gender identity. The NSCH did not include the ACE item (financial hardship) in either subdomain variable. Adverse childhood experiences were examined as the total number of ACEs as well as the 2 subdomains of ACEs (household based and community based). Bethell et al,22 in a study of 9 ACE items included in the 2016 NSCH, indicated strong internal validity for a cumulative NSCH ACE score. They identified this score as predictive of health outcomes associated with ACEs and recommended the use of a continuous NSCH ACE score.\n\nDemographics\n\nWe included child's sex, age, race/ethnicity (White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other), parent or guardian's education level (categorized as lower than high school, high school degree or General Educational Development, some college or technical school, college degree or higher), household income level (categorized as <100%, 100%–199%, 200%–399%, and ≥400% of the federal poverty line), having a consistent bedtime, and child's level of physical activity.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nWe first identified our study population of children aged 6 to 17 years following NSCH guidelines.18 This avoids the variance misestimation that can occur when subsetting from stratified samples. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to assess the association between sleep duration and the total number of and subdomains of ACEs. After running regression models, we calculated the predicted probability of suboptimal sleep duration for each additional ACE. We selected the following covariates to account for potential confounding in the associations between ACEs and sleep duration:4,11,13,23 child's sex, age, race/ethnicity, parent or guardian's education level, household income level, having a consistent bedtime, and child's level of physical activity. We then tested interactions between child's age group (6–12 vs 13–17 years) and the number and subdomains of ACEs. All statistical analyses used NSCH sampling weights to account for nonresponse and complex sampling procedures. Standard errors were adjusted for the complex survey design using the Taylor series linearization method.\n\nAs indicated earlier, missing cases of all variables included in this analysis were minimal (~2%). We used the list-wise deletion method for our analysis. All analyses were carried out using STATA version 17.0 statistical software.24 All hypothesis tests were evaluated using α = 0.05, but interpretation focused on relative risks (RRs) and predicted probabilities derived from the adjusted models. In our model evaluation, we used the Wald test to validate the robustness of our findings using the weighted sample, focusing on the significance of individual model parameters. This study was exempt from institutional review board review because it used publicly available, deidentified data. Study method and results are reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement for cross-sectional studies.25\n\nResults\n\nSample Characteristics\n\nThere were 58 964 children aged 6 to 17 years in the final sample, and 57.8% were in the 6- to 12-year age range (Table 1). Approximately 51.0% of the sample was male, 50.2% were non-Hispanic White, 31.1% had a household income at 400% or greater of the FPL, and 49.5% had caregivers with a college degree or higher. The mean (cumulative) number of ACEs was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–0.91), and 20.9% (20.2–21.7) of children had ≥2+ ACEs. The average number of household-based ACEs was 0.65 (0.63–0.67). The mean number of community-based ACEs was 0.127 (0.12–0.13). Among all children aged 6 to 17 years (included in the sample), the mean sleep duration score was 77.2 of a possible 100 (76.6–77.9). The proportion of the children meeting age-appropriate optimal sleep score was 65.9%.\n\nPrevalence of Suboptimal Sleep Duration Overall and by Selected Characteristics\n\nTable 2 presents the prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration among US children overall and by selected characteristics. Approximately 25.2% of the children (n = 13 739) fell into the subgroup of suboptimal sleep duration of ≥1 to <2 hours below or ≥1 hour above optimal sleep duration. An additional 9.0% of children (n = 4413) experienced suboptimal sleep duration of ≥2 hours below optimal sleep duration.\n\nThe prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration varied by child's age, race/ethnicity, parent or guardian's education level, household income level, having a consistent bedtime, and child's level of physical activity (χ2 tests with P value < .0001). No significant difference was found by child's sex. The prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration in subgroup 2 was higher (29.2%) in children aged 6 to 12 years compared with those aged 13 to 17 years (8.4%). In contrast, in subgroup 3, the prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration was higher for children aged 13 to 17 years (9.7%) compared with those aged 6 to 12 years (8.4%). Compared with White non-Hispanic children, the prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration was significantly higher among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic others. Children with parents/guardians who had at least a college degree or who came from higher-income households (eg, 400% FPL or greater) had a lower prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration (eg, 25.1% for children in ≥400% FPL vs 43.7% in children in <100% FPL). In addition, the prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration was lower among children who had a consistent bedtime and among those who were physically active.\n\nAssociation Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Suboptimal Sleep Duration\n\nTable 3 presents the results of multinomial logistic regression analyses examining the association between the total number of ACEs and subdomains of ACEs, and suboptimal sleep duration. Two subgroups of suboptimal sleep duration were considered: (1) ≥1 to <2 hours below or ≥1 hour above optimal sleep duration and (2) ≥2 hours below optimal sleep duration.\n\nAdjusting for covariates, each additional ACE increased the likelihood that a child was sleeping 1 to 2 hours less or 1+ hours more than recommended by 8% (RR, 1.08 [1.04–1.11]) or increased the likelihood that a child was sleeping 2+ hours less than recommended by 26% (RR, 1.26 [1.21–1.31]). The magnitude and direction of association between sleep duration and ACEs were similar across each subdomain, such that for each additional household-based ACE, the likelihood of obtaining suboptimal sleep duration increased (RR, 1.10 [1.06–1.14] and 1.30 [1.24–`1.37]). Similarly, for each additional community-based ACE, the likelihood of obtaining suboptimal sleep duration increased (RR, 1.16 [1.02–1.31] and 1.68 [1.45–1.95]).\n\nChildren with 1 ACE had a 25.4% probability of falling into suboptimal sleep duration subgroup 2 (those who reported about 1–2 less or 1+ hours more sleep than recommended each night). This probability increases to 26.1% for children with 2 ACEs and 27.2% for children with 4 ACEs; the probability further rises to 27.7% for children with 6 ACEs. Children with 1 ACE had an 8.7% probability of falling into suboptimal sleep duration subgroup 3 (those who reported 2 or more hours less than recommended each night); This probability increases to 10.4% for children with 2 ACEs and 14.7% for children with 4 ACEs; the probability further rises to 20.1% for children with 6 ACEs. These patterns remained fairly consistent across each subdomain, whether household based or community based (see Supplemental Digital Content, Tables S1 and S2, https://links.lww.com/JCN/A298).\n\nModel testing supported the inclusion of additional predictors in the full model, including all predictors, and showed significantly improved fit over a reduced model including on ACE score as a predictor (Wald statistic (F [14, 93554] = 52.54; P < .001).\n\nInteractions Between Age and Adverse Childhood Experiences\n\nWe also examined whether the associations between ACEs and sleep duration differed by child's age groups (6–12 vs 13–17 years). However, none of the interaction terms included in the multinomial regression models were statistically significant (all Ps > .05), indicating that the positive association between the cumulative number of ACEs or the number of ACE subdomains and suboptimal sleep duration did not differ substantially by age group.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we expanded on existing literature on the relationship between ACEs and age-specific insufficient sleep duration.11–14 We included examination of a dose effect of up to a total of 10 ACEs (previous literature examined up to 6 ACEs), whether different ACE subdomains (household-based vs community-based ACEs) are differentially associated with suboptimal sleep duration, and whether children's age moderates any associations between ACEs and suboptimal sleep duration. Our findings were that (1) ACEs were associated with suboptimal sleep duration and the association followed a dose-response pattern such that the higher number of ACEs led to obtaining worse sleep, and (2) the association between ACEs and sleep duration was present regardless of ACE subdomain or child's age group. Children who get excessive or insufficient sleep are likely to continue to experience suboptimal patterns of sleep in adulthood,26 suggesting that these findings have implications for understanding potential pathways for promoting optimal cardiovascular health in adults.27 Screening for these associations may provide information and insights central to promoting timely, targeted interventions focused on promoting cardiovascular health for all children and adolescents.\n\nOur findings are in line with previous work demonstrating a progressive dose effect: the odds of engaging in adequate sleep significantly decreased for youth as they experienced more ACEs.13,14 We now add to the existing literature that this association holds true for up to 10 ACEs. Furthermore, our study contributes new information by providing probabilities of increase in suboptimal sleep duration with each additional ACE. It is noteworthy that although exposure to ≥4 ACEs is associated with a higher risk of physical and mental health issues,28 we did not observe a marked jump in the probability of children with 4 ACEs or more falling into suboptimal sleep duration groups 2 or 3, but instead, we found a gradual pattern of increased likelihood of suboptimal sleep duration for each additional ACE, from 1 ACE to 10 ACEs.\n\nThrough the use of AHA Life's Essential 8 scoring criteria,10 we demonstrate this relationship holds true when using age-appropriate definitions of optimal/suboptimal sleep. Through our use of an updated data set, our examination likely incorporated some of the trauma experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which not only impacted mental health29 but also sleep in this age group.30 However, future work is needed using objective markers of sleep (ie, actigraphy with sleep diary) in populations not as impacted by the pandemic. Data accumulation during the postpandemic period is needed to test whether the relationships we found between ACEs and sleep duration persisted. Independent of any potential impact on CVD, research is warranted to develop effective strategies and clinical interventions for mitigating the adverse effects of ACEs on sleep health in children.\n\nOne unique aspect of our study was to examine whether the subdomains (household-based vs community-based ACEs) were differentially associated with suboptimal sleep duration in children. We found that the direction of the association was consistently positive across each subdomain, and the magnitude of the association was slightly stronger for community-based ACEs: the likelihood that a child was sleeping 2+ hours less than recommended was increased by 68% for community-based ACEs, compared with a 30% increase for household-based ACEs. Similarly, the likelihood that a child was sleeping about 1 to 2 less or 1+ hours more sleep than recommended each night was increased by 16% for community-based ACEs, compared with a 10% increase for household-based ACEs. Our finding that community-based ACEs had a stronger effect than household-based ACEs is inconsistent with Lin et al,13 where statistically significant associations were not found between community-based ACEs and insufficient sleep duration. (It is important to note that Lin et al did not account for “excessive” sleep.) Future studies are warranted to verify the impact of these 2 subdomains of ACEs and to determine whether individual types of ACEs should be weighted differently to assess association with sleep duration in US children. Finally, although this was not a part of our main study aims, we found that the prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration varied by social determinants of health31 other than ACEs, such as child's race/ethnicity, adult caregiver's level of education, and household income level. These findings align with those of Connolly et al,32 who reported on cardiovascular health scores by race/ethnicity in US adolescents; Kwok et al,33 who reported on systolic and diastolic blood pressure among adolescents by parent education level; and Jackson et al,34 who reported on the prevalence of obesity by family income. Future research, incorporating a comprehensive set of social determinants of health and cardiovascular health indicators such as Life's Essential 8 in children, is crucial for informing public health efforts aimed at reducing early-life health disparities.\n\nLimitations\n\nDespite our robust sample size and rigorous analysis accounting for many possible confounders, there are several limitations to consider. First, and as mentioned previously, the data used for this study were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to 2021, which has been associated with potential impacts on sleep duration/quality35 as well as worsening of ACEs.36 It is important to acknowledge that this historical event may introduce a threat to the internal validity of the association between ACEs and sleep duration. Second, the survey questionnaires rely on proxy reports from the children's parents or guardians, which are subject to recall bias and underreporting, especially for sensitive questions such as ACEs. Third, the 2020–2021 NSCH information on ACE exposure is binary, except for the “income” variable, which used categories such as “very often,” “somewhat often,” “rarely,” or “never.” The absence of detailed data on the severity and chronicity of ACE exposure or the age at the time of exposure may influence the strength of associations observed in this study. With more detailed data, future studies could more thoroughly explore the impact of ACEs. For instance, emerging evidence examines long-term consequences of parent-child separation, a common type of ACE, on cardiovascular health in adults.37 Fourth, because of the cross-sectional design, the study cannot support causality between ACEs and sleep duration. Finally, although not inherently a limitation of our study, it is important to note that the NSCH data we used did not have participants falling into all of the sleep duration categories (none aligned with scores of 70 or 90). We speculate this pattern may be an artifact of the survey questions used in the study; future studies could better inform our understanding of associations between ACEs and sleep duration.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates a positive association between the cumulative number of ACEs and suboptimal sleep duration among US children and adolescents, consistent with previous research highlighting the negative impact of ACEs on health outcomes. Our findings expand our understanding by revealing significant links between suboptimal sleep duration and both household-based and community-based subdomains of ACEs. Notably, we observe a dose-response pattern, whereby increases in ACEs are associated with an increase in the relative risks of suboptimal sleep duration. These findings underscore the importance of considering both ACEs and sleep duration independently as risk factors for cardiovascular risk in children and adolescents. Our work goes further to indicate that it is important as well to consider the potential mediating role of sleep duration on the association between ACEs and cardiovascular risk. Our findings align with previous research that has emphasized the need for longitudinal investigations into the potential mediating role of sleep on the relationship between ACEs and cardiovascular health.13\n\nCardiovascular nurses and healthcare providers should be aware that screening for ACEs and suboptimal sleep (duration and quality) is important for assessing children's cardiovascular health as reflected in the recent inclusion of sleep as a cardiovascular health indicator in the AHA's Life Essential 8. Healthy sleep habits is one important component of the emphasis on adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors as fundamental to promoting cardiovascular health and preventing future risk for CVD in childhood.38,39\n\nMore broadly, our findings related to ACEs underline the importance of understanding and integrating trauma-informed care into clinical practice. These results support future research on the development of resilience, emotional support, and positive relationships for children who have experienced traumatic events, to mitigate their adverse effects on health, including cardiovascular health.28 This might include a focus on protective factors such as family social cohesion or (access to) social support.40"
