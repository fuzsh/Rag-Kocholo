Welcome to Carol Jackson Furniture

Carol Jackson began producing contemporary furniture in 2014 after earning a Master of Architecture degree with a focus on furniture design. Concept, form, proportion, balance, contrast and clean elegant lines are all considered in the design process. Most designs incorporate anodized aluminum, adding a contemporary contrast to the timelessness of wood. Some of the statement pieces are produced only in limited editions of fewer than ten. All designs combine art with function. Drawing on decades of woodworking experience, Jackson crafts each piece of modern wood furniture herself, at a pace that allows her to strive for perfection.

Carol Jackson Furniture is endorsed by the American Craft Council and is listed in their Online Artists Directory

PACKING and SHIPPING

Most pieces are shipped fully assembled. In a few exceptions the top is detached from the base in order to fit in a container that is under UPS and FedEx maximum sizes. Each piece is professionally packed in a custom-sized, double-wall cardboard shipping box. Shipping within the U.S. is free.
