        "text": "In celebration of CRN’s 2024 Channel Chiefs, here’s a look at 50 leaders who drive the channel agenda and evangelize the importance of channel partnerships within the IT industry.\n\nThe Most Influential\n\nFor many IT companies the channel plays a critical role in their go-to-market strategies and operations. It’s no surprise, then, that channel chiefs play a significant role in the success of those companies. But some channel executives play an out-sized role in channel leadership – not just within their companies, but in the broader channel universe and the IT industry overall.\n\nThe 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs of 2024 are an elite group drawn from the larger pool of channel chief honorees each year – leaders who drive the channel agenda and evangelize the importance of channel partnerships.\n\nAll channel chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community and strategies for driving channel growth and innovation.\n\nThe complete 2024 CRN Channel Chiefs list is available online at CRN.com and featured in the February 2024 issue of CRN magazine.\n\nThe following snapshots include information from channel chief applications (including material in quotes), CRN news stories and other sources.\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\nRuba Borno\n\nVice President, Worldwide Channels and Alliances\n\nBorno leads a global team responsible for recruiting, enabling, buying and selling with over 130,000 companies in more than 200 countries, within the AWS Partner Network (APN). She is also responsible for AWS Marketplace and AWS Data Exchange, helping customers move quickly and responsibly to the cloud by making it easy to find, subscribe, and govern third-party software, data, and professional services.\n\nOver the past year Borno continued to meet with over 1,000 partners and customers of all sizes across all geographies and industries to truly understand their needs and find opportunity areas where AWS can improve and invest.\n\nBorno has been in her current post with AWS for more than two years. Prior to joining AWS, Ruba held several leadership positions over the course of a six-year tenure with Cisco Systems, including serving as senior vice president and general manager of Cisco's Global Customer Experience (CX) Centers where she led a team of 18,000 engineers to deliver Cisco's technical, professional and managed services as well as customer success, global supply chain and logistics. Before that Borno was a principal with The Boston Consulting Group and a leader in BCG's Technology, Media, & Telecommunications, and People & Organization practices.\n\nAMD\n\nMark Taylor\n\nNorth America Channel Chief\n\nTaylor leads AMD’s North American channel ecosystem, overseeing the chipmaker’s relationships with distribution, national, regional, and public sector solution providers.

He is currently working on shaping the company’s channel program to prepare AMD’s ecosystem for the company’s current product roadmap and the upcoming launch of new products for AI, data center, cloud and client devices.\n\nAltogether Taylor has worked in the IT industry for more than 30 years in a range of executive and management roles in sales, marketing and strategy and has overseen channel presences throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia/Pacific.\n\nArctic Wolf\n\nBob Skelley\n\nVP, Channel Strategy, Programs and Development\n\nSkelley leads Arctic Wolf's exploration into new channel communities and is currently focused on developing new routes to market through the channel and expanding the company's presence in the cyber-broker/carrier/insurance and incident response community.\n\nSkelley recently helped lead Arctic Wolf's channel expansion into EMEA, where he brought Arctic Wolf's partner-centric go-to-market model to Europe and oversaw the recruitment and hiring of the channel team across the region.\n\nHe also managed the development of new programs in the cybersecurity insurance and incident response (IR) markets, providing new profitability opportunities for partners and a vital service should a cyberattack occur.

She and her team work closely with customers and partners around the globe to ensure they receive the highest level of service and best solutions to achieve breakthrough results for their businesses.\n\nLoyd says Broadcom has focused on helping partners reinvent themselves, improve their margins and drive significant revenue through company investments in providing more growth opportunities, flexible training and other partner resources.\n\nIn 2023 those included investments in the company’s go-to-market models through the Global Cybersecurity Aggregator Program, which gives partners big sections of Broadcom’s business, and the Expert Advantage Partner Program that reinvents the traditional services and support model by simplifying go-to-market for consulting services engagements.\n\nLoyd joined CA Technologies in 1991, acquired by Broadcom in 2018, giving her over 30 years of experience in sales and sales leadership roles. Prior to her current role Loyd led Broadcom’s Global Enterprise, Commercial and partner sales teams.
