        "text": "Having founded Condusiv Technologies Corporation (formerly Diskeeper Corporation) in 1981, Craig Jensen built a leader in Windows systems reliability and performance software. Recently retaking the helm of the company as CEO after serving as chairman, Craig Jensen describes himself as committed to “unleashing better-than-new server performance.”\n\nMr. Jensen’s early accomplishments with the what was originally known as Executive Software include creating Diskeeper, which gained recognition as the top-selling defragmentation software ever. Still a staple software product in offices to this day, Diskeeper dramatically boosts the reliability and performance of servers.\n\nThe current corporate name reflects an evolution toward fulfilling enterprise server file system management and caching needs. Having been installed on more than 100 million computers, the company’s performance-focused products permeate nearly every Global 2000 company and have eliminated the need for system administrators to have to deal with “sluggish and flaky servers.”\n\nCharacterizing his reasons for taking on CEO responsibilities once again, Craig Jensen noted that he lives to help “individuals succeed at what they love doing.”\n\nCraig Jensen, a computer programmer by training, has served as the chairman of Condusiv Technologies Corporation, formerly known as Diskeeper Corporation, since 1981. An avid skier in his free time, Craig Jensen enjoys skiing groomed trails at ski resorts as well as heli-skiing.\n\nWhile many skiers spend much of their ski days riding on or waiting for chair lifts, heli-skiers instead rely on a helicopter to take them to the top of their slope of choice. These typically feature plenty of fresh powder and thousands of acres of space per skier, whereas even the largest traditional ski resorts have several skiers per acre.\n\nBecause heli-skiing involves so much fresh snow, experts recommend it only for those skiers who have already had some experience skiing in powder. The slopes themselves are usually equivalent in difficulty to an advanced run at a resort. The skill level required of heli-skiers is the primary barrier to entry.\n\nHowever, even those skiers who are less experienced with powder may be able to try heli-skiing, thanks to the availability of coaching and resort-based trips. Meanwhile, the more adventurous skier may choose to take his or her chances with weather fluctuations and unfamiliar terrain and go straight for a classic heli-skiing experience.\n\nAn executive in the information technology sector with more than 40 years of experience, Craig Jensen serves as chairman of Condusiv Technologies Corporation. In his free time, Craig Jensen contributes to the efforts of the Foundation for a Drug-Free World (FDFW).\n\nThe FDFW strives to enhance awareness of the dangers of drug use. The organization’s education program, The Truth about Drugs Education Package, includes a free online curriculum with 13 informative booklets and several public service announcements to assist teachers and drug prevention educators. The program also features a documentary titled The Truth About Drugs: Real People - Real Stories.\n\nThe FDFW provides information on a wide variety of substances, including alcohol, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and painkillers. Over the years, the FDFW has distributed some 55 million educational handouts in 20 languages, reaching individuals in more than 180 countries. To learn more about the FDFW and its drug prevention efforts, visit www.drugfreeworld.org.\n\nCraig Jensen, chairman and founder of Condusiv Technologies Corporation, splits his time between computer programming and helping others. Craig Jensen actively promotes “The Truth About Drugs” on behalf of the Foundation for a Drug-Free World.\n\nA nonprofit public benefit corporation, the Foundation for a Drug-Free World empowers adults and youth with information about drugs. In doing so, the organization protects young lives around the world from the destructive effects of drugs. Since the Foundation is a nonprofit corporation, it is largely funded by grant and public contributions. These contributions go toward supporting the Foundation’s educational material and drug prevention programs. They also help cover the cost of broad media campaigns and ongoing public information updates.\n\nOrganizations and individuals can support the Foundation for a Drug-Free World through membership donations and distribution of educational booklets. Craig Jensen does both. There are several type of memberships that the organization maintains. Its basic membership starts at $40, but individuals can commit to a contributing annual membership for $300. The annual membership comes with several benefits, including a membership card and regular email updates. Meanwhile, corporations can become annual members for $500 or become sponsors. As a corporate sponsor, companies can support public awareness events and campaigns, along with the promotion of the Foundation’s videos.\n\n​Craig Jensen, an entrepreneur in the software industry, leads Condusiv Technologies Corporation in his capacities as founder and chair of the board of directors. When not focused on his business, Craig Jensen enjoys alpine skiing.\n\nAlpine skiers choose to ski on sloped or downhill terrain common to areas such as Europe’s Alps, from which the sport gets its name. The United States hosts some of the best-regarded alpine skiing resorts in the world. In places such as Aspen, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, downhill skiers traverse the white slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Another popular spot is the Lake Tahoe region, on the border of California and Nevada in the Sierras.\n\nThough a popular modern sport, skiing is ancient in origin. Cave drawings that date back thousands of years to the Ice Age represent the earliest evidence of people using skis. Before becoming the organized sport it is today, skiing proved useful in hunting big game such as elk, and in conducting warfare in snowy, mountainous terrain. Craig does it for fun.\n\nThe Computer History Museum’s collection began about half a century ago when Gordon Bell and his wife Gwen decided to display computer equipment at the Digital Equipment Corporation in Massachusetts. Eventually, that collection found its temporary home in a venue shared with the Children’s Museum in Boston. About fifteen years later on the eve of the Millennium, the collection moved to its current home at The Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley. The museum endeavors to preserve any artifacts related to computing history for future generations.\n\nCurrently, the Computer History Museum features several exhibits. One such exhibit is called Revolution: the First 2000 Years of Computing, and it centers on the evolution of computing devices from calculators to card sorting machines to modern personal computers. Another exhibit tells the story of chess computing, tracing its roots to a paper published in the late 1940s by Claude Shannon. These exhibits are only a fraction of those currently active.\n\nTo explore more exhibits and to donate to the museum, please visit www.computerhistory.org.\n\nA world-renowned programmer, Craig Jensen founded the Condusiv Technologies Corporation and wrote the Diskeeper software for hard drive defragmentation. He is a proud supporter of the Computer History Museum.\n\nFounded by veteran software programmer Craig Jensen in 1981, Diskeeper Corporation recently retooled its image and changed its name in order to better reflect the company’s goals and vision for the future. Now operating as Condusiv Technologies Corporation, the enterprise that Mr. Jensen named after one of his most innovative creations continues to flourish and maintains solid footing as a forward-thinking pioneer in a business where the definitions of “cutting-edge” and “state-of-the-art” are constantly in flux.\n\nWhen Craig Jensen launched the Diskeeper product line in 1986, his groundbreaking defragmentation software quickly proved its viability as both a best seller and game changer. Providing Diskeeper Corporation with a notable competitive edge, the software remains one of the company’s most reliable sources of revenue, although new virtualization optimization tools and other applications in development now have distinction as the flagship products that define Condusiv Technologies.\n\nCraig Jensen served as Chief Executive Officer of Diskeeper Corporation until 2008, although he still plays a key role in product design at Condusiv Technologies Corporation. Due to Mr. Jensen’s ingenuity, products like Undelete, V-locity, IntelliWrite, and V-Aware have become a few of Condusiv’s greatest successes, enabling the organization to expand into new markets, improve user interfaces, and boost profits despite the challenges presented by an unstable global economy. With distribution planned for 50 countries, Condusiv Technologies looks forward to a future as an industry leader.\n\nCraig Jensen, an author, programmer, and entrepreneur who devised the Diskeeper product to make personal computers more efficient, donates to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.\n\nOne popular exhibit at the museum concerns the Homebrew Computer Club; it harks back to the days when dedicated hobbyists built and demonstrated their own computers. Many of the club’s members went on to pioneer commercial minicomputers.\n\nIn 1976, the club got a good look at the first computer kit: the Altair 8800. Two young programmers, Paul Allen and Bill Gates, wrote code for it. The same year, Steve Wozniak introduced the Apple-1, which consisted of parts, a printed circuit board, and an instruction manual; buyers had to provide their own keyboards, storage systems, and displays.\n\nThe club’s membership rose quickly. In two years, the mailing list contained 1,500 names. The “First West Coast Computer Faire” drew 12,000 people and 180 manufacturers.\n\nTo see more virtual exhibits of the Computer History Museum, go to www.computerhistory.org/."
