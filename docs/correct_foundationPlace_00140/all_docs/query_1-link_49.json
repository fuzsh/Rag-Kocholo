V-locity eliminates two major I/O inefficiencies in virtual environments that generate at least 30-40% I/O traffic. This is noise dampening performance, and unnecessarily consuming storage IOPS. You can expect an immediate boost in storage IOPS and a reclaim between 30-40% and 50% of storage IOPS. Many users also offload up to 50% of I/O traffic from storage, which can lead to big performance gains in the 2X-10X range. All you have to do is allocate a little more memory on key systems so that V-locity can better leverage V-locity. This will allow you to get even greater benefits on MS-SQL workloads such as Oracle, ERP, VDI (MEDITECH), Business Intelligence, Exchange, SharePoint, backup, file servers, and more. No reboot is required. Just download and install. You will see shadow IT problems and performance improvements disappear!\n\n23\n\neyeOS Full Desktop\n\neyeOS\n\neyeOS is a virtual desktop that can run any Windows or Linux application from a browser.

Clonetab base module for Oracle Databases, eBusiness Suite, and PeopleSoft is available. Normal shell scripts used to perform refreshes can leave sensitive passwords in flat file. They may not have an audit trail to track who does refreshes and for which purpose. This makes it difficult to support these scripts, especially if the person who created them leaves the organization. Clonetab can be used to automate refreshes. Clonetab's features, such as pre, post and random scripts, target instances retention options like dblinks, concurrent processes, and appltop binary copying, allow users to automate most of their refresh steps. These steps can be done once. The tasks can then be scheduled.\n\nRelevant Categories"
