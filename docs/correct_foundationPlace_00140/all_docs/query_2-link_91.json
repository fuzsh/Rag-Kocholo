Many budget and planning tools claim to be flexible, but in reality, leave you locked into budget and reporting structures that don’t match your business needs. This prevents you from optimizing your performance because planning models don’t reflect your true business drivers. You shouldn’t have to adapt your processes to fit the tool, the tool should adapt to you. Manual budget and forecast processes involve exporting data into multiple Excel spreadsheets sent back and forth between contributors and approvers.
