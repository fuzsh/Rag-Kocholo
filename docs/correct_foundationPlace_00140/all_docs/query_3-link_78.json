        "text": "In-Depth\n\n2013 Reader's Choice Awards: Third-Party Products Shine\n\nA revamped survey of Redmond's readership reveals your favorite software, hardware and services that complement Microsoft's core offerings.\n\nOne of the primary reasons Microsoft remains a mainstay in the datacenter and on PCs is its third-party ecosystem. Every year Redmond magazine has asked readers to choose their favorite products across a broad range of categories. Not surprisingly, Microsoft often swept many key segments. While we don't dispute that was deserved, in our view it was difficult to understand and recognize your preferences for third-party tools to manage and augment Microsoft's key platforms.\n\nIn an effort to get a better assessment of the most valued third-party tools to complement Microsoft's flagship offerings, we decided to take a fresh look at the technology that drives Windows, Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, Exchange and SharePoint, among other key platforms from Redmond. As a result, we redesigned the annual Reader's Choice Awards in a major way. We kept all of the categories and added quite a few new ones, but made one major change: Microsoft products were not eligible.\n\nAfter many years of conducting the Reader's Choice Awards survey, we understand most of you favor Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager for the simple fact that it's a component of the platform. But to help you make better decisions about what ancillary tools can extend the platform, we concluded the only way to provide a clear picture was to exclude Microsoft. The results speak for themselves, recognizing a number of important products that would otherwise be overshadowed.\n\nWe're also pleased to present more than a dozen new categories in such areas as server infrastructure, thin-client hardware and, of course, cloud computing. Congratulations to all the gold, silver and bronze winners."
