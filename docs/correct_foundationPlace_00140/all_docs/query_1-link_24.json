        "text": "BITKOM and German Government Recommend PCMark 8 Benchmark for Vendor-Neutral PC Procurement\n\nWe are proud to announce that BITKOM and the German government are using PCMark 8 to recommend the minimum required performance of desktop PC systems purchased for public agencies.\n\nBITKOM - Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien e.

The specifications use PCMark 8 benchmark scores to define the minimum performance requirement for desktops PCs to be used by office workers for administrative tasks.\n\nJukka Mäkinen, Managing Director of Futuremark, says,\n\n\"Defining vendor-neutral PC performance requirements is a major challenge for purchasers in public offices. I am delighted that BITKOM's committee of experts recognises that the best approach is to use relevant and widely accepted impartial benchmarks, such as PCMark 8, to set the minimum acceptable PC performance level in official tenders.\"\n\nPCMark 8 is a complete benchmarking solution for business, enterprise, government, and other professional users.
