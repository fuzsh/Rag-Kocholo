In Le Corbusier book A Contemporary City, it gives us a brief overview of his life. We know that he is a founding father to the modernist movement known as the International style, and that he also entered a competition to plan a “contemporary city of 3 million people,” that did not end up winning. Although he did not win, in this book he describes the leading factors that would contribute to his plan of a contemporary city. Of these factors was this topic of skyscrapers. He states, “The skyscrapers are designed purely for business purposes,” he later discusses how skyscrapers are also capable of housing employees, businesses and hotel sections. We also learned that skyscrapers have essential characteristics that define what a modern skyscraper and how there were certain technological requirements that were needed in order to develop a skyscraper. With regards to the development of skyscrapers, zoning properties were quickly established, which ultimately came to the influence of the aesthetic and visual properties of the city as a whole. In Widogers publication on The \"Solar Eye\" of Vision Emergence of the Skyscraper-Viewer in the Discourse on Heights in New York City, 1890-1920 we learned how Alvin Coburn, a photographer, takes his camera upon Madison Square in 1921 from the vantage point of the metropolitan life tower, and creates the first abstraction of a city viewed from above. It is also important because he also discusses how modern skyscrapers correspond to the urban transformation in New York City between the period 1890 and 1920. This then brings about the observation on how periods of social upheaval affect individualism and mass identity, which in turn conditions the way artists and writers define their artistic vision in relation to daily life in the city. He also states that, “The tower on Madison Square Garden and the Metropolitan Life Tower had similar features: they were not fully fledged skyscrapers but rather towers constructed either beside or on top of a block-shaped building.” The author also capitalizes on how this metropolitan lifestyle can alter ones behavior due to the environment that surrounds them. Post World War Two was the beginning of the housing boom. “The transition from a war to peacetime economy was centered on the mass consumerism, ”According to the lecture. The scarce shortage of material forced designers to develop new ways of building. This then lead to large scale housing production where some of these housing parts were sometimes made up of refashioned tank and airplane parts. This allowed for houses to be produced more efficiently and in bulk. During this transition time between wartime to pe.\n\nTypes of Weaving loom machine & it's technology\n\nTypes of Weaving loom machine & it's technologyldtexsolbl\n\nWelcome to the presentation on the types of weaving loom machines, brought to you by LD Texsol, a leading manufacturer of electronic Jacquard machines. Weaving looms are pivotal in textile production, enabling the interlacing of warp and weft threads to create diverse fabrics. Our exploration begins with traditional handlooms, which have been in use since ancient times, preserving artisanal craftsmanship. We then move to frame and pit looms, simple yet effective tools for small-scale and traditional weaving. Advancing to modern industrial applications, we discuss power looms, the backbone of high-speed textile manufacturing. These looms, integral to LD Texsol's product range, offer unmatched productivity and consistent quality, essential for large-scale apparel, home textiles, and technical fabrics. Rapier looms, another modern marvel, use rapier rods for versatile and rapid weaving of complex patterns. Next, we explore air and water jet looms, known for their efficiency in lightweight fabric production. LD Texsol's state-of-the-art electronic Jacquard machines exemplify technological advancements, enabling intricate designs and patterns with precision control. Lastly, we examine dobby looms, ideal for medium-complexity patterns and versatile fabric production. This presentation will deepen your understanding of weaving looms, their applications, and the innovations LD Texsol brings to the textile industry. Join us as we weave through the history, technology, and future of textile production. Visit our website www.ldtexsol.com for more information."
