V-locity eliminates two major I/O inefficiencies in virtual environments that generate at least 30-40% I/O traffic. This is noise dampening performance, and unnecessarily consuming storage IOPS. You can expect an immediate boost in storage IOPS and a reclaim between 30-40% and 50% of storage IOPS. Many users also offload up to 50% of I/O traffic from storage, which can lead to big performance gains in the 2X-10X range. All you have to do is allocate a little more memory on key systems so that V-locity can better leverage V-locity. This will allow you to get even greater benefits on MS-SQL workloads such as Oracle, ERP, VDI (MEDITECH), Business Intelligence, Exchange, SharePoint, backup, file servers, and more. No reboot is required. Just download and install. You will see shadow IT problems and performance improvements disappear!\n\n40\n\nKubermatic Kubernetes Platform\n\nKubermatic\n\nKubermatic Kubernetes Platform helps enterprises drive digital transformation through the automation of their cloud operations from anywhere.
