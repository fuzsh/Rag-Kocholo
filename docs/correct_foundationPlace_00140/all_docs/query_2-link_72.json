        "text": "Hi,\n\nI am currently in the process of upgrading my system. Current system is dual e5-2630 v1 with 64 gb ram with a 1 tb 2.5in ssd for os and apps and a 4 tb hdd for my data and profile.\n\nThe system I'm moving to will be 12700k with 64 gb ram. I do have a 2tb nvme drive to replace the os drive but I will be sticking with the 4tb hdd for storage. I was looking at primocache as an option to tier cache the old 1 tb as cache for the 4 tb data drive. I was not planning on doing ram cache. Based on the comments earlier that seems to be its focus.\n\nI was just looking at primo being $30 while a 4 tb ssd replacement being more.\n\nIn my scenerio, would it be worth it?\n\ni've been seeing an average 20% reduction in writes on my C: drive\n\nI'm confused. Where are you seeing 20%?\n\nBeyond that, I see in your screen shot, 870MB of writes. 870MB is nothing.\n\nFor example, if you take the budget minded Samsung 870 EVO SSD and scroll down to the section \"Industry-defining reliability\" and note the following fine print where it says (my bold added)\n\n* Warrantied TBW (terabytes written) for 870 EVO: 150 TBW for 250 GB model, 300 TBW for 500 GB model, 600 TBW for 1 TB model, 1,200 TBW for 2 TB model and 2,400 TBW for 4 TB model.\n\nIf you were to write a whopping 30GB to the SSD each and every day, 365 days a year, that is still only 10.95TB per year. And note that super budget 250GB SSD is rated for 150 TBW. That means if you wrote 30GB per day, 365 days per year, it would take 13.7 years (150/10.95) to wear that drive out. You would hit the 5 year warranty long before that.\n\nLook at the 2TB SSD. With 1,200 TBW and that same 30GB every day, it would take 40,000 days or 109 years!\n\nHow many people write 30GB to their disk in one day, let alone every day, all year long, year after year? What are the odds our hard drives will last 13 years? How about our RAM sticks, PSUs, motherboards, CPUs, you name it!\n\nTerabytes written.\n\nThe write limit with first generation SSDs was certainly a problem for a few folks in certain scenarios. But, these days, several generations later, there just isn't the need to worry about wearing out our SSDs anymore. The odds are clearly in our favor that the rest of our computer components will die, or be replaced due to obsolescence (or the upgrade \"itch) before we reach the write limits on our SSDs."
