        "text": "I often have to work extremely long hours night shoots, etc…I haven’t been sick in almost a year, almost never get headaches and have tons of energy–all the time! I feel truly great!…and without Dr. Springer’s vitamins, immune boosters, energy and stamina boosters I would never make it!\n\nI have found Dr. Neal Springer to be not merely a competent chiropractor, but an absolute genius at isolating the true cause of a difficulty and remedying it rapidly. I have recommended his services to others many times and will continue to do so.\n\nDr. Neal Springer is a wonder! I can’t say enough about his expertise, his knowledge and the care I have received from him over the years! I recommend him wholeheartedly to anyone interested in health, nutrition, mental and physical effectiveness and well-beingness.\n\nDr. Neal Springer is the man who keeps me healthy and functioning. Anytime anything happens, be it a cold, fatigue, flu or a stiff shoulder, I call him immediately and it gets handled. He also makes me smile, a wise and witty man, quite a package!\n\nI love Neal Springer. He has been brilliant in helping me rehabilitate nagging injuries that hamper a punishing work schedule and an active family life. I don’t know where I would be without him. He is without a doubt my No. 1 health care professional.\n\nI’ve been seeing Dr. Springer for 10 years now and he is hands down the BEST chiropractor in L.A.! He always gives special care when needed and after shooting some of my extra long days on set getting an adjustment from him is like a gift from God! Who knew so much change could happen in such a short time. Plus…the guy is just really cool.\n\nI used to think vitamins and supplements worked no matter what brand. After experiencing an entire year of lethargy, however, despite plenty of sleep and plenty of vitamins, I started to think this was just how my body was going to be. Finally I walked into Dr. Springer’s office, one of best things I’ve done. He put me on a regimen of vitamins and supplements my body could actually absorb. I noticed a difference immediately. I felt more mentally alert, and awake; my organs, my skin, my whole system improved (and I lost some weight). I look forward to the days when i have an appointment, as I always walk out feeling better."
