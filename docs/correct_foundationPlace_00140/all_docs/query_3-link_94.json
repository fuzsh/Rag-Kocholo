When did this place become Law & Order: Livejournal?\n\nlmao\n\nLaw & OhNoTheyDidnt has a better ring.\n\nIt worked\n\nlol\n\ndun dun\n\nis that word supposed to be uncommon or something...?\n\nRight, is this gonna be a thing now?\n\nHello, you called?\n\nlol, best comment + username ever\n\nSup Lenny?\n\n(no subject) - tine_marie Expand\n\nomg lenny, my father <3\n\nohmygod you exist?!\n\nRIP LENNY I LOVE YOU\n\n(no subject) - hpxstac Expand\n\nlol mte\n\nSlowly. Covertly. Mostly it was started by the guys in the black hawk helicopters and then adapted by those in the music industry and they put the idea into subliminal messages in the music.\n\n(no subject) - buncha_cruncha Expand\n\n(no subject) - waterlanding Expand\n\n(no subject) - francesbcobain Expand\n\nlol mte\n\nok so everything is bolded...\n\nIt's a good read sorry~~\n\ndammit i was just about to go to bed\n\nThat was actually really interesting, Scientology is so scary D:\n\nWhen it's explained like this, you can see why so many celebrities get drawn in to it. The security and privacy must be appealing to them. It's all batshit of course, but it's more understandable.\n\nmy bf has an uncle that tried to leave scientology and they locked him in a room and i'm pretty sure he had no place to go to the bathroom, i'm not sure how long it was for though (i heard this a long time ago). bitches are frightening.\n\nDid the uncle get out?\n\nnot right after that, but he might have since then.\n\nidk if it's in this article but she was on the view saying how they treat the kids as though they're a shell, so they don't treat them like children\n\nwhich made me think of suri & her heels/disturbing adult-like clothing\n\nnah i think suri herself just wanted to wear heels.\n\ni mean if everyone around you is walking around in them, maybe she was like Yeah I want those shoes. and she got it.\n\nidk i always saw her as like an infant adult & it disturbed me to my CORE\n\nnow after the divorce she dresses like a normal kid her age\n\n(no subject) - fwee_prower Expand\n\n(no subject) - beetlebums Expand\n\n(no subject) - numbedtoe Expand\n\nI really want to read this book.\n\nseriously i am still freaking the fuck out after that Deadly persuations episode about Sea Org on ID\n\nomw is this online anywhere? i want to watch it\n\ni dunno. netflix might have it.\n\nu can watch it here:\n\nhttp://www.sockshare.com/file/A94E5E74A971687F#\n\nOoh Scientology, whenever these posts pop up late at night, I can't go to bed.. far too good to pass up\n\ni have a feeling i'll be looking up wiki articles all night about this\n\nThey will suck you in because those articles will lead you to documentary videos and than testimonials from people who escaped and you'll realize that these fuckers are fucked up to infinity and beyond\n\nI still haven't started Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief. It has been on my Nook for a couple weeks now. I suppose I'll be reading both next week.\n\nugh I got addicted to Scientology docs for a while. Not a good phase. Netflix is my downfall.\n\nSometimes last year, I stayed up watching Scientology docs on Youtube with my best friend over GChat (we were too lazy to log in to Skype), and it was so eye-opening. We obviously already knew they were beyond shady. But it was terribly different listening to people who were able to escape speak about their experiences.\n\nI also recommend Janet Reitman's book \"Inside Scientology\" if you haven't read it already. I just can't get enough of these crazies.\n\n(no subject) - astrofisica Expand\n\nlol I'm in the Scientology tag rn because of that book. In case you haven't started it, do it. It's fucking crazy.\n\nI want to read this book! Scientology is interesting, and so so cray.\n\nCan we talk about this sentence?\n\nAs Dallas explained, the celebrities who would come to the center were very human there.\n\nJust that sentence? They're all atrocious. It's like rereading this book on Mary Seacole (that I still need to sum up for a paper thing tomorrow). I wish we could talk about my professors issues with writing a review of text that is seems to be written for a third grader.\n\nEdited at 2013-02-12 07:02 am (UTC)\n\nusually they're very alien duh\n\nmte\n\ni want to believe\n\nlol i THINK they mean they just acted ~normal~~~~ but it is scientology and they believe in xenu SO IDK\n\n(no subject) - wonderwomanhero\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nUgh that movie. Nightmares for days.\n\nis this the best excerpt they could get?\n\nIt is paragraph after paragraph of \"normal people got treated differently unlike celebrities\". Yeah? no shit. Even non-Scientology celebs get treated better than the average person. Thanks for that insight Dallas.\n\nBecause Nicole’s father was in the psychology field, this made perfect sense. We were taught that those in the mental health field were bad and evil. We believed what L. Ron Hubbard had written about them was true, that they were the reason behind people like Adolf Hitler and everything else bad that had ever happened on the “whole track,” the whole record in our minds of things that had happened to us over trillions of years.\n\nDamn Hitler if only you didn't go in for that one therapy session you could have been so different. Was the psychiatrist jewish? did he get annoyed that they answer questions with questions? this is all starting to make sense. thanks L. Ron.\n\nPeople always wonder why celebs would be in a church that treats people badly tho, so stuff like this explains that - like in pretty much every other area of life - the celebs don't get the same treatment as most.\n\ncelebs don't really care if others don't get treated as they do as long as they get treated better.\n\n(no subject) - bittermunchkin Expand\n\n(no subject) - evett Expand"
