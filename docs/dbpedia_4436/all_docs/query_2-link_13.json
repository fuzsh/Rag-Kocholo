        "text": "You can find a history of the declarations here\n\nUmicore has a high free float with a large international shareholder base.\n\nShareholding declaration obligation\n\nUmicore’s articles of association require any shareholder holding voting rights equal to 3% or more of the existing voting rights to declare this shareholding to the company and to the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). Any rise or fall below the first threshold of 3% and thereafter the threshold of 5% or any multiple of 5% is object to the above mentioned declaration.\n\nAccording to the Belgian transparency legislation in force (Law of 2 May 2007 – Royal Decree of 14 February 2008), the denominator to take into account for the declaration is 246,400,000 shares voting rights.\n\nYou will find all required information in the practical Guide FSMA_2011_08 of 10 November 2011 available on the website of the FSMA as well as the form to be used : TR-1 BE (https://www.fsma.be/en/file/40711/download?token=Q2w7OOPT) issued by the Financial Services and Markets Authority - FSMA.\n\nThe form duly completed shall be transmitted electronically to:\n\nThe FSMA at: TRP.Fin@fsma.be. with the mention of the transmission date, the subject and the issuer name, and subsequently, for reasons of legal certainty, by fax to +32 2 220 59 12.\n\nUmicore at: transparency.declaration@umicore.com (Contact : Eva Behaeghe + 32 2 227 70 68) .\n\nFor more information, please visit the FSMA website: https://www.fsma.be/en/node/7121\n\n* On 8 February 2018 Umicore placed 22,400,000 new shares with institutional and other investors through an accelerated bookbuild conducted under private placement exemptions. The new shares represented 10% of the number of outstanding shares prior to the transaction (224,000,000). On 12 February 2018 the new shares were admitted to trading on Euronext Brussels. As a result, as from that day, the total number of shares outstanding amounts to 246,400,000"
