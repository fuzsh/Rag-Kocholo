        "text": "With over 30 years of experience in developing technical, industrial and scientific products for the Australian Market, Umicore Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd, provides a wealth of experience to its customer base in identifying the appropriate product for your process and servicing for ongoing needs for technical support, product supply and competitive pricing.\n\nÖgussa is part of Umicore, a global materials technology and recycling group. Its activities are organized in three business groups: Catalysis, Energy & Surface Technologies and Recycling. Each business area is divided into market-focused business units offering materials and solutions that are at the cutting edge of new technological developments and essential to everyday life. We cover the entire precious metal cycle from one single source and focus on application areas where our combined expertise in materials science, metal chemistry and metallurgy makes the real difference for our customers.\n\nSchöne Edelmetaal B.V. has been a household name in the world of precious metals since 1739. Having originally started out as inspectors of gold and silver at the Exchange Bank, we have grown into being the main supplier to the European mints. You could well say that we’ve got to where we are today by capitalising on our rich history. Which is something we’re very proud of! But we don’t just live in the past, we continue to go for gold, working our hardest each day to be the very best partner you can have. Since 2003 we’ve been doing that under the wing of Umicore.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Agosi has been successfully active in the French precious metals market, offering the entire scope of its services. In February 2015, when the Paris subsidiary was established, Agosi took the logical step of being closer to and locally available for its customers in France. For this purpose, a substantial range of products is on stock at the Paris premises. Customers are welcome to address all precious metals related issues to the sales team that represents Agosi via the Umicore France sales office.\n\nServing the North American market, Umicore Precious Metals Canada Inc. is a leading supplier of precious metals products in grain, wire , sheet and tube form and provides assaying and refining services for gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The company was originally established in 1914 and operates from its facilities in Markham, ON.\n\nUmicore Precious Metals USA Inc. is the US sales office in Rhode Island. It supports precious metals services and requirements with strong commitment to the precious metals cycle.\n\nAt its Pforzheim location, Allgemeine Gold- und Silberscheideanstalt AG sees itself as a long-established constant in the precious metal business, as an important manufacturer of semi-finished precious metals products, and raw-material supplier of gold, silver, platinum and palladium resulting from Agosi's in-house refining processes - a classical single-source solution.\n\nBased on the environmentally sound recycling of secondary materials and the continuous development of innovative methods for precious metal analysis, production technology and quality management, all of Agosi's 400 employees are strongly committed to serving the precious metal consuming industries both at home and abroad.\n\nSince its beginning as a distribution office for Portugal in 1992 and for Spain in 2009, Umicore Marketing Services Lusitana has extended its presence in both countries. We are serving a wide range of diverse market sectors and are selling a variety of products from both Umicore and selected third parties.\n\nUnder the roof of Umicore, the sales team in Birmingham started serving UK customers in 2005. In the many years of its existence, profound knowledge of the market has been gathered. Customers’ requirements are met with well-grounded experience and greatest care. The sales office distributes a wide variety of Agosi’s products, the main part of which is on stock at the Birmingham premises."
