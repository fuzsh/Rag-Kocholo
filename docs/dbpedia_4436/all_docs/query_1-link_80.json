        "text": "Top Trending\n\nEmerging Toronto designers shine in Botswana\n\nThe designs of three recent graduates of Toronto’s George Brown College (GBC) earned international praise at De Beers’ 2019 Shining Lights Awards (SLA) in Botswana.\n\nA change in style: Jewels for everyone—even men\n\nThere was once a time when jewellery was almost entirely for women and offered sparse choice for men. We have certainly moved on from those days.\n\nDigital threats: Protect your jewellery business from cybercrime\n\nIt is beneficial for you, as a small business owner, to be aware of the threats associated with cybercrime and how you can protect yourself in an ever-evolving digital age.\n\nThe sustainability trap\n\nCurrently, mining for product used to make jewellery continues just as it always has, with large-scale mines supplying 80 per cent of gold and diamonds and extracting resources as fast as possible.\n\nPolishing pretty stories: Engage customers with the entire tale of coloured stones\n\nColoured gems sell—we don’t even need to classify them as ‘precious’ and ‘semi-precious’ anymore. Depending on a stone’s provenance and rarity of colour and size, today’s shoppers are willing to dig deep into their pockets and shell out serious money for many rainbow-hued gemstones."
