        "text": "The head office of Umicore worldwide, the crossroads of our sites, that’s Umicore in Brussels. Again here, for our solid Group there is a firm foundation for a career in technology. Included are: great atmosphere, international contacts and the room to develop your talents. Find out all the advantages of working at Umicore Brussels.\n\nThe Umicore way at HQ in Brussels\n\nAt our headquarters in Brussels, you don't work in the thick of production or in research; but every day you’ll be collaborating on \"materials for a better life\" in an environment that breathes technology.\n\nThere is no production unit in Brussels. So as an out-and-out engineer or operator here, you will have less contact with our industry. But if you have a passion for technology and your talent lies in sales, IT, logistics, SAP, management, finance ... then you’ll find your niche here.\n\nAll m/f talents wanted\n\nWhatever your background is, you don’t need to be a technician to build a career in technology. We’re also looking for talent in sales, IT, logistics, SAP, economics… at different levels. At our headquarters you get tuned in with Umicore as a Group, you’re close to the top management and keep in touch with our various sites.\n\nInternational environment\n\nUmicore is not just Belgian but also a multinational enterprise: we reach into Canada, China, the United States, Brazil... The international contacts are included in your work. And in Brussels, the world pours in every day. That means that your career opportunities are both national and international.\n\nGreat working atmosphere\n\nOur doors are always open and we treat each other informally. This no-nonsense approach makes it great to work with us.\n\nGood commuting\n\nSetting to work in the Brussels region? Our headquarters are easily accessible with public transport, which makes a big difference to your commuting.\n\nLocation\n\nBroekstraat 31\n\n1000 Brussel\n\nGet Directions"
