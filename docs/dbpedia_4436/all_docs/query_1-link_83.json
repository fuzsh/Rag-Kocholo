The BMW Group said in a news release that establishing a relationship with AESC and Umicore is important to create a regional supply chain and secure the ramp-up of its e-mobility opportunities.\n\nBMW called the move part of its “local-for-local” principle.\n\n“The company aims to source components like battery cells close to vehicle production and gradually localize the supply chain for primary materials,” a news release from the company said.\n\nThe Bath facility will manufacture cathode active and precursor materials on a large industrial scale. These materials will then be used in electric vehicle batteries such as BMW’s eDrive technology vehicles. It hopes to manufacture enough material for more than 800,00 electric vehicles every year.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The BMW Group pursues a globally balanced procurement strategy in the three main geographical regions of the world,” Joachim Post, member of the board of management of BMW AG responsible for purchasing and supplier network.\n\n“Our battery cell supplier in the U.S. will source key primary materials from Canada going forward. We are pleased that Canada is playing a strong role in establishing a robust and efficient battery cell supply chain for the BMW Group in North America.”\n\nCEO of Umicore Mathia Miedreich said his company, BMW and AESC are partners and the materials his company will produce will power BMW’s sixth-generation battery.\n\n“All three of us, we care a lot about true CO2-neutral batteries,” Miedreich said. “Producing batteries today is still creating CO2. If you want to have a true CO2-neutral active vehicle, this is what the three partners have come together to pioneer for the North American market.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBMW said the sixth-generation batteries will increase energy density by 20 per cent and improve charging speed and range by up to 30 per cent.\n\n“At the same time, CO2 emissions from cell production will be reduced by up to 60 per cent: on the one hand by cell suppliers relying on energy from renewable resources; on the other by using a percentage of secondary material for the raw materials lithium, cobalt and nickel,” the news release said.\n\nWhen Umicore’s arrival was announced in July 2022 with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the construction estimate was $1.5 billion. The federal government has committed $551.3 million and the provincial government will supply $424.6 million.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFederal Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne touted Canada as being the new green supplier of choice for the electric vehicle industry. He said in the beginning of talks with UmicoCandare, he and Vic Fedeli, Ontario’s minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, went to its customers, like AESC and BMW, to help sell Canada as the best place for their new facility.\n\n“(We told BMW) ‘Listen if you want to build, not only an electric vehicle but the greenest car in the future, you need to team up with Canada, and therefore Umicore,’” Champagne said. “The aluminum is going to come from Quebec, the cathode active material is going to come from Ontario for BMW, so in a sense, we’re building the full supply chain for the vehicle of the future, which is a green vehicle.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe facility is set to create more than 1,000 jobs during construction on its 350-acre plot of land. Once complete in 2025 and production ramps up in 2026, it is expected to offer 600 high-skilled jobs and 700 co-op positions for students. The company has already posted various positions available at the Loyalist Township location on their website.\n\nMeidreich said Monday that in the past year, it decided to expand the facility’s capabilities and leave space to grow and evolve in the future as technology changes. Champagne noted that with Umicore’s expansion and future plans, there will be a little piece of Loyalist Township in vehicles across North America for the foreseeable future.\n\n“We are preparing for the future because we think this is just the start of a bigger journey going forward,” Meidreich said. “We’re here for the long term and we’re looking forward, (the plant) looks big, but it could be even bigger.”\n\nscrosier@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/StephattheWhig\n\nWe want to hear from our community.
