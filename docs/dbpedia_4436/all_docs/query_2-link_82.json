        "text": "The plant – the first of its kind in North America – will initially employ 600 people and have a battery materials production capacity of 35 gigawatt hours annually.\n\nCanada, home to a large mining sector for minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, wants to woo firms involved in all levels of the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain via a multibillion-dollar green technology.\n\nThe Umicore plant is due to be built in stages and could be worth C$2.7 billion when fully completed. Canada will invest up to C$551.3 billion with Ontario adding up to C$424.6 billion.\n\nThe full project has the potential to produce enough battery materials to support the production of over 800,000 EVs per year, Champagne said.\n\n(By David Ljunggren; Editing by David Gregorio)"
