Umicore way forward 1) Demand for electrified vehicles (xEVs) grows exponentially across the world. 2) Investing to grow our battery recycling business and established â€˜Battery Recycling Solutionsâ€™ (BRS) as a new business unit in 2021, after two years of intensive business incubation in NBI. 3) The creation of a dedicated organization underlines our commitment to make battery recycling and our closed loop offering an essential part of our contribution to the sustainable electrification of the automotive industry. 4) Significant step-up in recycling performance, with increased extraction efficiency of cobalt, nickel and copper to reach over 95% yield for a wide variety of battery chemistries. This includes the capability to recover most of the lithium in EV batteries, solving a key constraint in existing recycling capacity. 5) The recovered metals will be delivered in battery-grade quality at the end of Umicoreâ€™s recycling process, allowing them to be re-introduced in the production of new lithium-ion batteries. 24 Battery Recycling Introducing Umicore 2021 - Public use\n\n25. Working our way to Go for Zero in 2035 o Umicore has signed two separate long-term power purchase agreements with ENGIE Belgium and Axpo Group. o The Renewable energy sourced from offshore and onshore wind turbines will power two of our largest sites worldwide, located in Belgium (Hoboken and Olen) o We are going for zero GHG emissions by 2035. Introducing Umicore 2021 - Public use 25 Renewable energy\n\n26. Environmental footprint of the battery value chain o LCA is a valuable tool to identify environmental hotspots within the battery life cycle but is a complex exercise and can be challenging to compare and communicate the results. o The lack of quality process data and lack of standards specific to the battery industry contribute to the challenges of bringing LCA to the battery value chain. o The LCA for cathode material production reveals that one of the main contributing factors to global warming potential are the impacts related to electricity generation. o Umicore is serious about implementing LCA into its business and thus uses results from its LCA efforts to set newly minted climate targets and will apply those to our Battery Recycling Solutions activities. Introducing Umicore 2020 26 Life cycle assessment (LCA) as a measurement tool\n\n27. o Umicore is a materials technology company which manufactures cathode chemistries for rechargeable battery materials. o As a participant in the pilot PEF, Umicore helped define an auditable, enforceable, environmental evaluation metric that could be applied generally to battery products sold in the EU. Since global warming due to CO2 emissions has been identified as an important impact category, the abatement of the CO2 is the primary focus. One of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions for cathode material manufacturing stems from the need for intensive energy use; thus, the electricity grid mix is a big factor in determining the environmental footprint of cathode materials. Based on this understanding, Umicore has decided to use 100% green electricity to power its cathode materials production plant in Europe LCA in practice for the cathode industry Umicore Rechargeable Battery Materials 27\n\n28. o Umicore focuses on building a sustainable, closed-loop approach to cathode material production by heavily emphasizing activities such as recycling, responsible sourcing of raw materials, leveraging block chain technologies, as well as conducting environmental assessments. Therefore, Umicore has set newly minted climate targets and will go for net zero greenhouse gas emissions in scope 1 and 2 by 2035. LCA will be a valuable tool to help measure how close we are to that target when also scope 3 emissions, that is, those related to activities outside the company boundaries, are included. o The process of assessing environmental impacts requires sophisticated political, technical, and industrial alignment. Moreover, LCA must contain harmonized rules and methodologies for the calculation of claimed low carbon solutions. As there is a need for the battery industry to develop a reference point of sustainability, the implications of performing proper LCAs for the EV supply chain are rife with challenges but not taking the time to perform proper assessments is also not an option. â€‹Summary Umicoreâ€™s closed loop approach and new sustainability targets 28\n\n30. Addendum 1 What is LCA and why does it matter? Introducing Umicore 2020 30 Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVâ€™s) are routinely evaluated in terms of environmental performance. Many journalists have speculated that EVâ€™s may not be as environmentally friendly as initially perceived. This begs a host of questions: on what grounds? Says who? Validated by whom Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized, science- based tool used to demonstrate the environmental friendliness of a given system or product. LCA takes into account all phases of the productâ€™s life cycle, including direct and indirect emissions, looks at inputs and outputs for each phase, and converts them into an environmental impact. LCA was first employed in 1969 and has been used by various industry associations since, thereby providing LCA practitioners with some reliable environmental impact data. Thus, LCA and at the very least â€” greenhouse gas accounting â€” is not something new to industry in general In the 1890s, Rudolph Dieselâ€™s namesake engine was hailed as a technological marvel and praised for its claims of reduced CO2 emissions. Today, these diesel engines are being phased out due to their hazardous NOx emissions and particulate matter. Had there been a comprehensive environmental assessment, these risks could have been identified earlier, eliminating misguided transitions. In the development of new technologies, there has historically been an inclination to prioritize technical and short-term economic considerations over the environment. Clearly, the lack of proper assessments might have contributed to disastrous effects on our planet. Therefore, it is important to conduct LCAs to understand the environmental implications of mobility applications throughout their life cycle. The use of LCA in the battery value chain could provide a level-playing field if the LCA rules are clear and transparent.\n\n31. Addendum 2 What is LCA and why does it matter? 31 Introducing Umicore 2020\n\n32. â€¢ There are many LCA challenges to be found in the battery industry. The quality and comprehensiveness of the input data are critical to the final results. Many LCA publications rely on old databases and secondary data that are aggregated or have conflicting or incomplete system boundaries. The definition of the scope and boundaries is very important in LCA and the results can only be compared if the same definition is applied to each case. Moreover, the choice of the database and impact assessment can also lead to differences in results. Thus, two LCA studies analyzing the same product or material could sometimes be as different as comparing apples to donuts. Conflicting results call the conclusions into question. Tracing the factors behinds these differences is not so straightforward and more guidance is needed to grapple with these results. Based on some of these examples, it is clear that the LCA results can be conflicting, and that there are risks associated with using one set of assumptions over another.
