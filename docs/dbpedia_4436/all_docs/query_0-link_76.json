        "text": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Umicore's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nA total of 9 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership\n\nOwnership research along with help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nEvery investor in Umicore SA ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 40% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAs a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by €192m. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 49% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or \"liquidity providers\" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Umicore, which might have negative implications on individual investors.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Umicore, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Umicore?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nUmicore already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Umicore's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Umicore. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA with 16% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 5.2% of the stock.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Umicore\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data cannot confirm that board members are holding shares personally. It is unusual not to have at least some personal holdings by board members, so our data might be flawed. A good next step would be to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nPublic companies currently own 16% of Umicore stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Umicore better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
