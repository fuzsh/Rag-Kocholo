I am very proud that we have been able to gather such a fine group of people from IONWAY, PowerCo, Umicore and Volkswagen Group for a successful workshop in Cologne. Thank you so much! #SynergyforEnergy.\n\nWe launch Nexyclusâ„¢, our 100% high-quality fully recycled metals starting with precious metals gold, silver and platinum-group metals platinum, palladium and rhodium. This unique and broadest offering addresses resource scarcity and increased demand for recycled, responsibly sourced and low-carbon metals. Customers can choose between three recycled content offerings and chain of custody certifications, which will be third-party audited. Read more on our press release: https://umico.re/95x #UmicoreNexyclus\n\nIn our 2023 Full Year Results we demonstrated our ability to deliver strong cash flows and margins in a tough year, while significantly stepping up investments for future growth. We reached significant strategic milestones across our activities â€“ including a strong and diversified orderbook in #BatteryMaterials and securing substantial government grants for our expansions in Europe and North America amounting close to â‚¬1 billion. As we move into 2024 we are now focusing on execution excellence and accelerating efficiencies to deliver on Umicore #2030RISE https://umico.re/kk3\n\nWe are proud to have secured the European Investment Bank (EIB) â€˜s support with a loan of â‚¬350 million to fund part of our European research and innovation in EV battery materials. Our battery materials technologies, innovation roadmap and complete battery materials supply chain are key contributors to the transition to cleaner mobility and the EUâ€™s Green Deal ambitions. Read more here: https://umico.re/iap\n\nExciting news! ðŸ‘©ðŸ”¬ðŸ’»ðŸ§¬ To accelerate and scale our battery materials technologies development we enter into an agreement with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence. We will apply AI as a tool for our battery scientists to win time, efficiency and scale in our innovations while safeguarding our intellectual property. Find out more about our collaboration: https://umico.re/ri8\n\nWe take a moment to look back at 2023 and the journeys we have taken together. We are proud of our #UmicoreFamily for their hard work and for making significant progress on our Umicore #2030RISE strategy. With every step forward, however small, we create materials for a better life because we innovate, we drive change and we care. We are ready for 2024! âœ¨\n\nItâ€™s confirmed! We are building our EV battery materials production plant in Loyalist, Ontario. Backed by the unwavering support of both the Governments of Canada and Ontario to co-fund our investment, it represents the final step in creating a global production presence with our local-for-local sustainable battery material value chains. We have also entered a long-term agreement with AESC to supply high nickel cathode materials, securing access to an important part of the North American demand and powering their customers in the region - including BMW Group. We are pushing ahead with our Umicore #2030RISE strategy - validating our leadership and the reliability of our battery technologies.
