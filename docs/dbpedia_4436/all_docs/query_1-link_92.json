Umicore Precious Metals Refining has its headquarters in Hoboken, about 15 km from Antwerp. Umicore Precious Metals Management, based in Germany at Hanau- Wolfgang, about 30 km from Frankfurt, is – besides other tasks – also responsible for the worldwide sale of Umicore bars made at the company’s refineries in Europe. <strong>Gold</strong> refining and the manufacture of bars take place in Europe in Hoboken (Belgium), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Pforzheim (Germany) and Vienna (Austria). The refineries in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany are accredited to the London Bullion Market Association. OWNERSHIP N.V. Umicore S.A. is a public company. Historically, Belgian institutional and retail shareholders have accounted for a large portion of the free float ownership. However, in recent years significant efforts have been made to broaden Umicore's shareholder base. Although Belgian financial institutions remain important investors in the company, it is estimated that Umicore now has an equally strong investor base in the UK and a rapidly growing one in North America. Continental European investors outside Belgium have also grown in significance in recent years.
