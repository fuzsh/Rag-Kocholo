        "text": "About\n\nUmicore is a global materials technology and recycling group. The company’s industrial and commercial operations, as well as research and development activities, are located across the world to best serve its global customer base.\n\nThe challenge\n\nUmicore’s treasury team recognized that its decentralized treasury processes were hampering the company’s ability to maximize its liquidity and best support global operations. To improve its overall cash management efficiency, the Umicore treasury team wanted to further centralize its cash globally, ultimately into a single location and achieve enhanced visibility and control.\n\nTo address this situation, Umicore’s team launched a global cash management RFP in 2017. In addition, the company’s treasury team looked to rationalize its banking relationships around the globe and eliminate redundant and unnecessary accounts in order to drive efficiency.\n\nThe J.P. Morgan solution\n\nFollowing the RFP process, Umicore selected J.P. Morgan to manage all the USD flows of the Umicore group (the “Group”) globally and to implement a USD cash concentration offshore.\n\nThis unique solution allowed Umicore to achieve its objectives of control, visibility and automation - bringing a lot of efficiencies into their cash management and liquidity centralization processes.\n\nWith this solution, all USD accounts of Umicore entities (starting with European entities, as well as North and South American entities) were opened in a central location, at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York Branch. This solution ensures an optimized processing of the USD transactions, as well as efficient centralization, since the cash can be easily concentrated with same day value and on an end of day basis.\n\nThe Umicore affiliated entities incorporated in Asia will be added to the structure in a later stage, allowing Umicore to ultimately set up a truly global cash concentration structure in USD. The cash will thus ultimately be centralized at Umicore HQ level, ensuring an efficient use and redeployment of this cash within the Group globally.\n\nJ.P. Morgan is the marketing name for the Treasury Services business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its affiliates worldwide.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
