        "text": "While Umicore SA ( ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw a decent share price growth of 13% on the ENXTBR over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Umicore’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nIs Umicore Still Cheap?\n\nGreat news for investors – Umicore is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that Umicore’s ratio of 13.6x is below its peer average of 19.09x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Chemicals industry. However, given that Umicore’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Umicore look like?\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Umicore, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -6.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Although UMI is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to UMI, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UMI for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, we recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. To help with this, we've discovered (1 is significant!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Umicore.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Umicore, you can use our free platform to see our list of over"
