If you upload content, including your Personal Data, to a social network and then tag our Website, your submission will be subject to that social network's terms of use and privacy notice, even where you post on an official Umicore page on the social network. We do not have control over these terms of use and privacy policies and have not reviewed their adequacy.

Carrying out Direct Marketing\n\n6.1 We may use your Personal Data, such as your address for direct marketing purposes. We may for example send you emails to inform you of news and updates about our services. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements. Where required by law, we will obtain your consent prior to sending you such marketing information.\n\n6.2 To protect your privacy and ensure you have control over the use of your Personal Data, we will always give you the opportunity to \"opt out\" of direct marketing when you contact us in relation to a product or service or you receive any email, text or other direct marketing communication.\n\n6.3 You have a right to prevent direct marketing of any form at any time - this can be exercised by following the opt-out link attached to each communication, by changing privacy settings within your Umicore account or by sending an email to data_protection@umicore.com.\n\n6.4 Based on the information we have about you, we take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you, based on the information we have about you.\n\n7. Legal basis of the processing\n\n7.1 Umicore only processes your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice where Umicore is satisfied that:\n\n(a) you have provided your consent to Umicore using your Personal Data for that purpose (e.g. where you provide Umicore with marketing consents or opt in to additional services);\n\n(b) Umicore's use of your Personal Data is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that Umicore has. For example, to maintain appropriate business records, to comply with lawful requests by public authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations or as otherwise required by law;\n\n(c) our use of your Personal Data is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (i.e.: placing and delivering an order); or\n\n(d) Umicore's use of your Personal Data is necessary to support legitimate interests that Umicore has as a business to provide products and services to its customers, provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights.\n\n7.2 Umicore has a legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data, for example:\n\n(a) to ensure that its networks and information are secure;\n\n(b) to ensure proper communication with you;\n\n(c) to administer, improve and generally conduct business; and\n\n(d) to avoid non-compliance.\n\n7.3 To the extent you have consented to the processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\n\n8. Disclosure of Data\n\n8.1 Umicore may disclose Personal Data:\n\n(a) to Umicore’s affiliated companies (including Schöne in particular);\n\n(b) to any third parties to whom the relevant Umicore entity subcontracts all or part of this processing. The purpose of this transfer will be to help manage our business and deliver services. For instance, we may transfer your Personal Data to a service provider to the extent necessary to provide our services. Other instances may include transfers to e-marketing service providers, hosting providers and any other relevant roles. Note that we will never sell your Personal Data to a third party. These third parties have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and use any Personal Data we share with them or which they collect on our behalf solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us;\n\n(c) to Umicore’s professional advisors;\n\n(d) to third parties in connection with a (potential) merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, to the extent that this is necessary for the process;\n\n(e) where permitted by local data protection laws, or otherwise allow others access to your Personal Data pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with applicable laws, if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so, with or without notice to you. If warranted, we may also allow access to this information in special emergencies where physical safety is at risk;\n\n(f) as requested by governmental or administrative authorities; and\n\n(g) as necessary to enforce its rights and defend its interests.\n\n9. Transferring Personal Data globally\n\n9.1 Your Personal Data may be transferred and stored outside your place of residence, that are subject to different standards of data protection. In particular, if you live in the EEA, you should be aware that your Personal Data may be shared with, and transferred to, Umicore affiliates and third-party service providers who are located outside the EEA. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of Personal Data are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:\n\n(a) we will ensure that transfers within Umicore and its affiliates will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of Umicore Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that Personal Data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Group;\n\n(b) where we transfer your Personal Data outside Umicore or to third parties who help provide our products and services, we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data; or\n\n(c) where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we will carefully validate these requests before Personal Data is disclosed.\n\n9.2 You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your Personal Data when this is transferred as mentioned above.\n\n10. Security\n\n10.1 Umicore understands the importance of your personal information and provides reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect Personal Data, such as, for example, encryption, encrypted tunnels, firewall and anti (D)DOS protection. These controls are designed to maintain the confidentiality of Personal Data and protect it from unauthorized access, improper use, and accidental loss. However, you acknowledge and agree that:\n\n(a) in general, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure, private, or confidential; and\n\n(b) any information that is sent to or received by the Website may be intercepted, decrypted, consulted, and used by third parties, even if the exchange of such information is encrypted.\n\n10.2 The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of Umicore’s partner networks and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that Umicore does not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or websites. Please check these policies before you submit any Personal Data to these websites.\n\n11. Data Retention\n\nUmicore will retain the Personal Data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. The criteria used to determine the retention periods include: if you have an account with Umicore, Umicore will only keep the data while your account is active or for as long as needed to provide services to you; Umicore retains your data as long as it has an ongoing relationship with you; Umicore retains your data as needed to comply with its global legal and contractual obligations.\n\n12. Plug-ins\n\nThe Website uses several Plug-ins. When you visit a page on the Website that uses a Plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the server of the applicable third-party software platform (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube) (\"Platform\"). The Platform then directly transfers the Plug-in content to your browser, which embeds such content in the Website. This process enables the Platform to receive information about your use of the Website. If you are a member of a Platform and logged into your Platform account, then your use of the Website may also be assigned to your Platform account. If you want to prevent such assignment, then please log off of your Platform account before using the Website. For further information regarding the privacy, protection, and processing of your Personal Data by Platforms, please consult their respective privacy statements.\n\n13. Cookies\n\n13.1 The Website uses several Cookies. These Cookies are designed to, among other things, operate the Website, enhance your user experience, and collect User Data.

This includes cookies from third-party analytics services as long as the cookies are for the exclusive use of the owner of the website visited.\n\n(d) Marketing\n\nThese cookies track your online activity to help advertisers deliver more relevant advertising or to limit how many times you see an ad. These cookies can share that information with other organizations or advertisers. These are persistent cookies and almost always of third-party provenance.\n\nUpdate your preferences\n\n14.
