        "text": "The aim is to support the promoter's investment in the new greenfield cathode material manufacturing facility of the promoter in Poland (Nysa). The project will be carried out during the period between 2019 and 2021, inclusive. The exact timeframe will be verified during the appraisal process.\n\nThe project was subject to a screening decision according to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) directive by the competent authorities. The latter screened the project out and provided an environmental permit for a cathode materials manufacturing facility. All environmental and social issues will be assessed in detail during due diligence\n\nThe promoter has been assessed by the EIB as being a private company not being subject to EU rules on public procurement or concessions. However, if after the project appraisal, the EIB were to conclude that the promoter is after all subject to EU public procurement legislation (i.e. Directive 2014/24/EU), then the Bank would require the promoter to ensure that contracts for the implementation of the project will be tendered in accordance with the relevant applicable EU procurement legislation (2014/24/EU, where applicable, as well as Directive 89/66/EEC), as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the EU, with publication of tender notices in the EU Official Journal, as and where required.\n\nMedia enquiries\n\nMedia-related enquiries can be addressed to the EIB Press Office. Please also visit our Media information section.\n\nComplaints mechanism\n\nAny complaint regarding alleged maladministration can be lodged via the EIB Complaints Mechanism. The European Ombudsman acts as an independent external accountability mechanism of the EIB."
