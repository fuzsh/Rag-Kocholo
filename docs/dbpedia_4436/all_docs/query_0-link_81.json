        "text": "Following the announcement by Solid Power, Inc., Louisville, Colorado, United States, to become a publicly listed company through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Umicore N.V., Brussels, Belgium, has announced that it holds a stake in Solid Power’s pre-SPAC transaction. This stake was built through two successive investment rounds (series A and B) which Solid Power raised before launching the next phase of its growth through a public listing.\n\nFounded in 2012, Solid Power is a industry-leading developer of next-generation all-solid-state batteries for electric vehicles. With eight years of technology development and three years of manufacturing development, Solid Power has been working to deliver better performing all-solid-state batteries using low-cost, industry standard processes. Solid Power’s all-solid-state batteries alleviate the two largest concerns for passenger EV adoption: cost and range anxiety, with an expected 50 to 75% increase in energy density compared to any commercially available lithium-ion battery today. The safety profile of Solid Power’s batteries also exceeds that of traditional lithium-ion as a result of its truly all-solid cell architecture. Several leading car manufacturers and cell makers such as Ford, BMW, Hyundai and Samsung invested in Solid Power’s promising technology."
