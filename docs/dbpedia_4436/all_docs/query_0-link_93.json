        "text": "According to GlobalData’s company profile on Umicore, Hydrogen storage alloys was a key innovation area identified from patents. Umicore's grant share as of February 2024 was 53%. Grant share is based on the ratio of number of grants to total number of patents.\n\nDoped ß-nickel hydroxide for battery electrode material\n\nA recently granted patent (Publication Number: US11919783B2) discloses a novel ß-nickel (II) hydroxide doped with both Al and Co ions. The unique aspect of this material lies in the homogeneous distribution of Al ions within the crystal lattice of the ß-nickel (II) hydroxide, resulting in secondary particles composed of spherically agglomerated primary crystallites with a primary crystallite size of 100 Å or less. These secondary particles exhibit a particle size ranging between 2 and 20 µm, making them suitable for various applications.\n\nFurthermore, the patent outlines a method for producing this specialized ß-nickel (II) hydroxide, involving the precipitation of ß-nickel (II) hydroxide doped with Al ions using an aluminate as the Al ion source. The method includes specific steps such as preparing a solution with Na2SO4, NaOH, and NH3, adding the aluminate and a nickel compound to form the doped hydroxide, and subsequent separation. Additionally, the method allows for the production of lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide by mixing the ß-nickel (II) hydroxide doped with Al and Co ions with lithium hydroxide and processing the mixture in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at a specific temperature range. These innovative processes offer potential advancements in the field of materials science and energy storage technologies.\n\nTo know more about GlobalData’s detailed insights on Umicore, buy the report here."
