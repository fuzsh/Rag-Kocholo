        "text": "Davies is acting for Umicore SA/NV, a circular materials technology company headquartered in Belgium, in the development and construction of a manufacturing plant for electric vehicle battery materials. The facility will be the first of its kind in North America to produce both precursor and cathode active materials at an industrial scale. It will also be powered fully by renewable energy.\n\nThe facility will be located in Loyalist Township near Kingston, Ontario, and is scheduled to open in 2025. Approximately 700 employees will make battery parts from metals such as nickel, cobalt and lithium.\n\nUmicoreâ€™s facility continues the trend of major Canadian investments by global automotive manufacturers.
