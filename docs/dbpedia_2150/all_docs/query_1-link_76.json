        "text": "Film critic and author Amy Taubin shared the negative response when showing her students the film during her feminism and film classes, not long after the films release, in Criterion’s article Wanda Now: Reflections on Barbara Loden’s Feminist Masterpiece: “[The class] resented having to spend nearly two hours watching a character who is so passive, who allows herself to be so mistreated. They could not see how the film and Loden’s performance spoke to Wanda’s humanity and to that of the majority of women worldwide who can’t envision a way to fight back.”\n\n___STEADY_PAYWALL___\n\nTaubin’s middle-class and college educated students struggled to empathise with Wanda’s decision to give up. Wanda’s apathy seemed to be misunderstood as being complacent; Wanda - a working class woman from a small town - was part of the wider problem rather than a reaction to the situation she was in. 1970s America saw feminism go mainstream, with Gloria Steinem at its helm – a woman that looked like Sharon Tate dressed up as a librarian, brushing shoulders with Hollywood actors. Jane Fonda was also a high profile activist during this time – an actual Hollywood actor. Although a high profile face can be a positive for getting a movement funding and visibility, this glamourisation of feminism seems like the beginning of the mess we’re in today; neoliberal feminism.\n\nThird wave feminism has been watered down massively in the public eye. The feminist movement, that once was a symbol of hope, is now in the claws of the neoliberal American agenda.\n\nThird wave feminism has been watered down massively in the public eye. The feminist movement, that once was a symbol of hope, is now in the claws of the neoliberal American agenda. Described by George Monbiot in The Guardian, Neoliberalism is “seeing competition as the defining characteristic of human relations. It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency.” When this is intertwined with socio-political movements - it alienates the participants - diminishing them to useless vessels of capitalist agendas. It can make a movement powerless, intertwining it with products and images.\n\nThis is unappealing. Why would a person partake in such a garish, empty ‘movement’ when there’s so much horror going on in the world? The sky is on fire, who cares about pubic hair? War and the climate crisis are too much for the individual to consider. The earnest desire to offer guidance and hope for young women has been defaced in the name of Meghan Trainor and Hilary Clinton.\n\nThe goal of liberation is secondary in today's socio-political movements; what comes first is the perception of liberation. The falsehoods of social media and that mouth frothing hunger for a dopamine hit has led rich white women and social-media-only activists astray. With a culture of falsehoods becoming more and more prevalent, me and my peers are urged to give up altogether, to bask in nihilism instead.\n\nIt all paves the way for the rebirth of the apathetic woman, like Wanda, downtrodden from the brutal realities of having no money and even less respect, except now she has balayage and lives in one of the most desirable cities for arts and culture. She’s sad because it’s almost too easy, her emptiness is not motivated by external pain but internal pain. She’s begun a rampage of hurting herself, just to feel something.\n\n2023’s Sick of Myself features Signe, who is the model of a middle class woman hungry for perception - Signe is willing to go to irreversible lengths to get her fix of validation and recognition. Directed by Kristoffer Borgli, Sick of Myself is a practice in self absorption; Signe is filled with self hatred - and audiences love it."
