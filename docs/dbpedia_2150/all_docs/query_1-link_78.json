        "text": "WANDA\n\nBarbara Loden’s 1970 film  the only feature she directed, and a masterpiece  had the bad luck to be doubly ahead of its time. Politically, it was guilty of premature post-feminism. The story about a youngish housewife (played by Ms. Loden) from Pennsylvania coal mining country who walks away from her husband and two children to take up with a mean-spirited petty thief (Michael Higgins) is hardly a parade of positive role models. And formally, the film  shot in 16-millimeter by Nicholas Proferes, using the lightweight equipment that was then driving the cinéma vérité documentary movement  goes far beyond the jittery, performance-centered style associated with that era’s independent films, like John Cassavetes’s 1968 “Faces.”\n\nFavoring long shots and a motionless camera, Ms. Loden approaches the modern, impassive realism of Abbas Kiarostami and Hou Hsiao-hsien. An early shot of Wanda, a tiny figure in white slowly crossing a desolate field darkened by coal dust, plays with distance and duration in a way that seems startlingly contemporary, as if it had been clipped from the latest film by Gus Van Sant.\n\nMs. Loden, who is still awaiting a biographer, was a working-class girl from South Carolina who came to New York to be a model and pin-up; instead she became an actress and the wife of the director Elia Kazan, who cast her as the Marilyn Monroe figure in his 1964 production of Arthur Miller’s “After the Fall.” Ms. Loden won a Tony Award for her work, but seemed to gain little traction from it; Mr. Kazan directed her in two more plays, neither successful.\n\nIn retrospect, she seems hardly to be Mr. Kazan’s kind of actor at all. Though physically commanding and sexually charged, as were all of the stars he created, she had a kind of silence, a sense of her characters’ privacy, that ran counter to the institutionalized exhibitionism of the Method. This is another way that “Wanda,” with its long periods of silence and inaudible dialogue, differs from Mr. Cassavetes’s films, though it is inevitably compared to them.\n\nMs. Loden, who was separated from Mr. Kazan, died of cancer in 1980, at 48, without making or appearing in another movie. “Wanda” stands as an incredible one-off, like “The Night of the Hunter,” Charles Laughton’s one film as a director. It is evidence of a great career that never was. Parlour Pictures, $24.95, not rated.\n\nTHE GIRLS\n\nAnother actress turned director, the Swedish Mai Zetterling, made her first feature, “Loving Couples,” in 1964, and unlike Ms. Loden, enjoyed a long career as a director. “The Girls,” released in 1968, was already her fourth film, and while it doesn’t have the Chekhovian sobriety and insight of “Loving Couples,” it is a bright, lively, politically progressive work, at least until its despairing finale.\n\nThree of the great actresses of the Swedish cinema  the blond, self-confident Bibi Andersson; the dark, thoughtful Harriet Andersson; and the brassy Gunnel Lindblom  play actresses in a touring company of “Lysistrata,” which they hope will open eyes and illuminate minds in the dour, provincial towns of northern Sweden.\n\nAs in “Loving Couples,” each major character has a flashback or fantasy sequence in which she lives out her most painful crisis. (Bibi Andersson’s character, Liz, is married to a cloddish young businessman, played by Ingmar Bergman’s future screen doppelgänger, Erland Josephson, who here strongly suggests a Scandinavian Tony Roberts; the other women are similarly underappreciated in their marriages.)\n\nScenes from “Lysistrata,” with its satiric celebration of the secret power of women, are intercut with moments from the actresses’ daily lives, as they try to punch the meaning of their play through the infinitely resistant skulls of the local burghers.\n\nThis is not as didactic as it sounds, thanks to the self-deprecating humor that Ms. Zetterling weaves through the film. But it can be a bit masochistic, as when Bibi Andersson’s character tries to hold a post-performance discussion of the play, but is met only by cold, wordless stares from the utterly unmoved bourgeoisie.\n\nThe curious ending seems to suggest that an alcoholic haze is the only filter through which Swedish society can be tolerably viewed; and even that, under the end credits, spins off into psychedelic abstraction, looking forward to the decade ahead. New Yorker Video, $29.95, not rated.\n\nSHOGUN ASSASSIN\n\nMartial arts purists should probably shun “Shogun Assassin,” a highly influential exploitation film from 1980 that cuts together sequences from the first two features in the Japanese “Lone Wolf and Cub” series into a single movie, less than 90 minutes long. Urban audiences were just growing accustomed to Bruce Lee’s kung-fu violence; the full, blood-soaked fury of the Japanese sword film was a startling revelation that left its mark on an entire generation of critics and filmmakers. A direct line, for example, can be traced from “Shogun Assassin” to Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill.”\n\nRobert Houston, an actor who later branched out into documentary, directed the American version. (His polished “Mighty Times: The Legacy of Rosa Parks” was nominated for an Oscar in 2003.) He doesn’t simply cut away the exposition in this tale of a widowed samurai (the bearlike Tomisaburo Wakayama) who wanders the countryside pushing his infant son in a baby cart. Instead, he introduces an element not in the original two films by Kenji Misumi: a precocious but still plausible voice-over narration by the samurai’s son. The moral perspective it adds to the astoundingly stylized scenes of violence  with their arcs of orange soda blood and surgically sliced-off body parts  is provocative, to say the least, and much of the child’s scratchily naïve narration (read by Gibran Evans) sounds like a sly parody of Linda Manz’s voice-over in Terence Malick’s “Days of Heaven,” released two years before.\n\nMr. Houston was also blessed with a dubbing cast of unusual quality, including the gifted director Lamont Johnson as Lone Wolf and Sandra Bernhard in an unidentified role, though I think I can hear her behind the chief of the female ninja gang, who has a whim of steel. A most entertaining mash-up, avant la lettre. AnimEigo, $19.98, R.\n\nALSO OUT TODAY\n\nTHE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU From the Romanian filmmaker Cristi Puiu, a devastating black comedy about an elderly man’s slow death at the hands of the public health system. Tartan Video, $22.95, R.\n\nJAN SVANKMAJER: THE OSSUARY AND OTHER TALES Nine short films, made from 1964 to 1989 by the Czech stop-motion animator, who has a way of turning bits of meat into scenes from Kafka. Kino, $24.95, not rated.\n\nMY NAME IS EARL: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON Jason Lee as an amiable slacker who resolves to spend the rest of his life making things right with everyone he has ever wronged. 20th Century Fox, $49.98, not rated."
