        "text": "\"Seen from a distance, a woman, etched against the darkness. Whether it is a woman, in fact, is hard to tell, we're so far away.\"\n\nTHAT'S A DESCRIPTION, OR AN EVOCATION, of the opening of Barbara Lodens film Wanda (1970), where a faraway pale figure trudges through a wasteland, like a character from Samuel Beckett. It's also the start of one of the most daring and insinuating books ever attempted about a creative personality in film-an actor, a director, and a character, too, a woman of rare strength and independence who had been inspired by a hapless drifter so lacking in will that she thanked the judge who put her away for 20 years.\n\nWe feel closer to Loden today; she has been rediscovered by cinephiles, though Wanda is still not easily seen. We hear enough to regret the way Loden was treated-which doesn't mean we understand her, or ever will. It doesn't save her from being a tough case, or her own worst enemy. There is something inscrutable about her, an unwillingness to be known. The name \"Wanda\" sounds aimless, but there's such bleak purpose in her story. That seeming disconnect animates the beguiling Suite for Barbara Loden (the source of my quote), by Nathalie Léger, which is \"little\" only in size (123 pages)- \"Brilliant little book\" is the rather patronizing blurb on the cover. It was published first in French, in 2012, and an English translation was released last year thanks to the Dorothy Project.\n\nThe unassuming paperback becomes a \"big\" and unusual book: it has no film stills, just a drawing on the cover; it fits in your pocket, but it will expand in your mind; and for all its basis in fact, Dorothy categorizes the book as \"fiction,\" which sets you wondering. Is Loden now a story as much as someone who lived? I find myself reading the book over and over, uncertain whether Léger has worked her way into the troubled actress or into some more lasting union of fact and myth. Unlucky in so much of life, Barbara Loden now seems oddly exemplary.\n\nExample: Wanda never cries in her film (where most people might). Léger..."
