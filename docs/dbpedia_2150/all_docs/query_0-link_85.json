        "text": "INTRODUCTION: Whatever Happened to Wanda?\n\nWhen Barbara Loden’s landmark work Wanda (1970) – the first independent U. feature-length motion picture written, directed, and acted in by a woman to receive international attention— premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 1970, the cinematic world seemed ready to make its director a star. The film won the Festival’s International Critics Award, receiving widespread acclaim and was even hailed as a “stunning achievement” (Thomas 1971, 23). However, this seminal work, as well as Loden herself, whose life provided the source material for the story, has been subject to historical erasure. Wanda was never picked up for national distribution in the U.S. and was first released on DVD in the United States as late as 2006, more than three decades after its award-winning debut (Taylor 2010, AR11). The UCLA Archive ultimately restored the original 16mm color reversal a/b rolls of the film, found in a closing film laboratory, in 2010 (Lipman 2011). Loden’s film, cited as a critical success that “failed to create excitement at the box office” actually failed even to gain the attention of distributors, due in significant measure to the very nature of the story (Cook 1980, 26). Wanda was released in one theater, Cinema II in New York, and nowhere else in the United States (Reynaud 2004, 223). As the singular legacy of a burgeoning artist whose life was cut short (Loden died of breast cancer ten years after the release of Wanda, and never made another feature film), the exposition of an American tragedy that makes the film so exceptional in content, has been a message lost on American audiences (Folkart 1980, 21). The story itself is circular, leaving Wanda at the end back in the same situation that she was in the beginning – perhaps, we wonder, knowing the place for the first time.\n\nThe arc of the story follows her somewhat aimless journey through the slums of Appalachian coal mining towns. Her wandering only gains purpose owing to a chance encounter with a petty crook, played by Michael Higgins. Using her as a replacement for his former partner-in-crime, who has claimed to be too old to take the risk of another heist, “Mr. Dennis” (as she calls him) and Wanda form a strange partnership: whether their union is predicated on any sort of conventional pure romance is highly questionable, as he is often relatively nasty to her (calling her stupid, a nobody). But there are moments where his gruffness translates as tenderness. In scenes, for example, where he places his coat around her shoulders, when he insists she get herself some clothes (after telling her “no more hair curlers”), when he tells her “you’re really something”, his words elicit from Wanda the only genuine smile we see on her face; and his death shows us Wanda’s tears. Her emotionality is predicated on her relationship with Mr. Dennis, a relationship almost like a marriage – in certain shots, Wanda wears a white dress with a white hat and Mr. Dennis dons a suit and together the pair look as if they had just left the wedding chapel. This unlikely and far from idyllic union leads to the few moments in which we witness a freedom and strength in Wanda.\n\ncondition not only of women, but of people, in America, Wanda made art out of American despair. Loden claimed that one of her goals in making Wanda was to show that “down South or into the coal mines of Pennsylvania, you’ll see people like Wanda, ignorant not because they’re stupid, but because they’ve never been taught anything” (Reed 1971, 2). On this level, Wanda is an attempt to expose a wider problem in the United States, the symptoms and consequences of an ignorant, uneducated population given little reason to exist. The idea for the project came from an article Loden had read nine years prior to the making of the film: a piece about a female accomplice in a bank robbery, a woman named Wanda Goronski, “who got 20 years without appeal and said ‘Thank you, judge.’ I was fascinated by what kind of girl would be that passive and numb” (Reed 1971, 2). Passivity – and the apparent absence of agency or intentionality – is a large part of what makes the film particularly unique: the handheld, amateur-like camerawork mirrors and captures the passivity of the eponymous character: the long takes, the shaky hands show us a world that we might have happened upon by chance. I would like to designate Wanda’s filmic style as “experiential aesthetic,” a formal approach meant not only to reflect the “anti-Hollywood” and “anti-movie” effect toward which Loden avowedly strived, but also one that visually captured Loden’s own personal experience as represented in the filmic text through the use of certain visual techniques (Reed 1971, 32). In many ways, due to the low production values of the film, Loden was forced to expose a milieu of poverty and ignorance appropriating those same qualities as her tools (the film had a budget of merely $160,000, and as Loden’s debut, contained a significant level of ignorance, as she admits “I didn’t know anything about the camera.. wasted\n\nmoney because I didn’t know what I was doing” (Reed 1971, 2)). Thus, the cinematographic, aesthetic approach to the film circumstantially and necessarily reflects key elements of the plot itself. Here we find a sort of redemptive irony – the poverty of means, an ignorance of techniques and materials, the improvising of resources, and learning on the fly are an essential part of Wanda’s production context which make the film’s content so true to form. Loden, that is, works within and with these constraints, improvises and uses these limitations, similar to those which burden and confine Wanda, to create for the film its characteristic look and mood and manner and simultaneously – ironically – to give voice to the silence of the character and to herself as an artist. In an interview with Rex Reed, Loden claims that through the inspiration of the newspaper story, combined imaginatively with her own life story, “I developed the character of this almost catatonic girl. Glamorized characters in Hollywood movies, no matter how unfortunate, are always saved in the end by some remarkable inner quality. I simply wanted to show an ordinary person without any redeeming qualities at all— the type of girl who never had a chance” (Reed 1971, 2). But this is surely not a character critics were ready to embrace or a film which distributors believed would make profit at the box office. The story of this ordinary hopelessness as a real and present part of American life, which Loden hoped would reach American audiences, never did, as the film was largely undermined by the general tenor of U reception. McCandlish Phillips writes that Wanda “tells of a passive, slatternly young woman who abandons her family and drifts, like a piece of wood, through dreary events in motels and bars” (Phillips 1971, 32). The film, in fact, is deeply pessimistic, lacking forward motion and in its eponymous character offers nothing resembling a female role model. Instead, Wanda exposes the\n\nfigure, as Loden demonstrated in her own life. The film gave Loden the opportunity and ability to speak in her own auteurial voice, and create her own cinematic language. Loden’s sense of purpose is most clear in her interview with McCandlish Phillips, “Barbara Loden Speaks Of the World of ‘Wanda.’” With the release of Wanda, Loden at last felt that she had found her purpose, a reason for existence forged from all the confusion and pain of her life until that point— Phillips asks Loden “Do you know now [who you are and what you’re supposed to do]? to which Loden gently replies, “Yes” (Phillips 1971, 32). Although Wanda may be a story of extreme oppression, passivity and victimhood, the making of the film was an affirmation of Loden’s life experience, as a subject who was able to escape and ultimately transcend that very same ugly and oppressive world that traps Wanda.\n\nChapter 1: “Nothing to do With Women&#039;s Liberation,”\n\nBarbara Loden &amp; “Women’s Cinema”\n\nThe debut of Wanda in 1970 coincided with the onset of a decade in which Second Wave Feminism began to define its message, when “women’s cinema” was first being recognized as both commercially and critically viable, and feminist film criticism emerged to assert the importance of female voices within the medium of motion picture film (Butler 2002, 1-3). In 1972, a watershed year, not only was the first issue of Women &amp; Film published, (a magazine that played a significant role in investigating the representation and participation of women throughout the history of cinema) but the first New York International Festival of Women’s Cinema was held, as well as the Women’s Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival (Rich 1998, 64). Although this historical moment was undoubtedly the critical juncture in the evolution of feminist film studies, the issue is somewhat complicated semantically by the fact that there are certain critics who focus their assessments of “women’s cinema” on a proposed distinction between “feminism,” as a political movement, and “feminist film,” as a way of qualifying film that originated in this era. According to B. Ruby Rich, the semiotic, linguistic relationship between “feminism” and “feminist film” is more fraught than it seems, and we may argue, I submit, that to reduce a film to a category simply because of the historical context in which it was made diminishes the overall impact of the work itself (Rich 1998, 63). As Rich has said “‘feminist’ is a name that may have only a marginal relation to the film text, describing more persuasively the context of social and political activity from which the work sprang. Such a difference is due, on the one hand, to a feminist recognition of the links tying a film’s aesthetics to its modes of production and reception; and, on the other hand, to the particular history of the cinematic field that ‘feminist,’ came to designate, a field in which filmmaking-exhibition-criticism-distribution-audience have\n\nFeminist control of the entire process [of distribution and exhibition]. We do not accept the existing power structure and we are committed to changing it by the content and structure of our images and by the ways we relate to each other in our work and with our audience. Making and showing our work is an ongoing cyclical process, and we are responsible for changing and developing our approaches as we learn from this experience. We see ourselves as part of the larger movement of women dedicated to changing society by struggling against oppression as it manifests itself in sexism, heterosexism, racism, classism, ageism, and imperialism. Questioning and deepening our understanding of these words and of how language itself can be oppressive is part of our ongoing struggle. We want to affirm and share the positive aspects of our experience as women in celebration. (“Feminists in the Media” 2014, 359) This compelling demand for power, control and recognition exemplifies what made women’s cinema in the 1970s fundamental in establishing a new representation of gender in cinema. By outlining the history of sexism in cinema up until that moment, feminists were emphasizing a forgotten, or eclipsed, history, and thus naming what had been until then unnamed and unrecognized. A year before, in 1974, FECIP (Fédération européenne du cinéma progressiste) drafted a similar, albeit longer, declaration entitled “Manifesto for a Non-Sexist Cinema,” which likewise outlined the issues this group of feminists took with classical modes of representation in media, and the ways in which sexism was perpetuated in the very mechanisms of classical Hollywood cinema, which had come to be accepted as conventions of motion picture film (MacKenzie 2014, 356). Part of the manifesto reads:\n\nSexism intermingles insidiously in our most everyday and commonplace activities and— whether man or women, child, adult or elderly person— freezes us in stereotyped roles by stifling multiple possibilities in each of us. To get away from slogans, we propose first to specify notions of sexism and anti-sexism. We think that sexism consists especially of perpetuating feminine and masculine stereotypes without denouncing them.. have just begun to know the multiple repressions, which, more along women than among men, have stifled our creative potential. But we don’t know yet what a thought, a look, a word— if it was to be decolonized, de-conditioned of male thinking, of its mental structures centered on the male standard as the sole criterion of evaluation for all creativity— could reveal the specificity of women, of our relation to the language (our mother’s language), to our body, to space, to time and the future.. have everything to learn about ourselves. We have to use our energies to liberate everything. (FECIP 2014, 356) The challenge to these stereotypes and patriarchal restraints was key in finally articulating an audible female voice in the film industry. This newfound freedom, and the possibilities for new forms of creativity, seemed boundless once given an outlet to identify and name the conventions of a cinema that these women argued had been serving as tools of the patriarchy, intending to prevent women from having their own voice and place within history. The decade also saw the release of the first generation of feminist documentaries (Growing Up Female, directed by Julia Reichert, Three Lives, directed by Louva Irvine and Susan Kleckner and The Woman’s Film, directed by Louise Alaimo, Judy Smith and Ellen Sorren, all released in 1971), as well as canonical feminist fiction\n\ncritics, and audiences, the magazine is an exemplary product of the time in which it was published. The magazine, however, was not without its problems, especially as regards its rhetoric which, as B. Ruby Rich notes, came ultimately to be seen as a prototypically American, sociological, subjective critical voice (Rich 1998, 73). Rich describes this approach to criticism as an “optimistic [view], a quality that may be viewed by supporters as radical or by detractors as unrealistic, utopian” (Rich 73). The method the magazine used could be considered overly personal and therefore, as Rich points out, biased: Early Women &amp; Film articles and much of the catalogue writing from festivals of the same period exemplify the early American, so called sociological approach. The emphasis on legitimizing women’s own reactions and making women’s contribution’s visible resulted in a tendency towards reviews, getting information out, a tendency to offer testimony as theory. Although the journal was fruitful in this terrain, the weakness of the approach became the limits of its introspection, the boundaries established by the lack of a coherent methodology for moving out beyond the self. (Rich 1998, 72) If the magazine contained elements of solipsism, it is likely a consequence in large measure of women’s subjective experiences having been until that moment denied expression. This recognition of an historically oppressive climate that served deliberately to silence or marginalize women’s voices does not of course invalidate the argument that subjective viewpoints cannot be the only grounds for a feminist theory. The magazine ultimately ceased publication in 1975 because of disagreements among members of the editorial board. However, in 1977, many of the original members of Women &amp; Film founded the film theory journal Camera Obscura, which is still in publication (Rich\n\n1998, 64). Although short-lived and ideologically problematic, Women &amp; Film represented certain progress in the field and practice of feminist film criticism. Another issue, however, which problematizes feminist reactions to Wanda is that the extreme subjectivity that purportedly figured so significantly in American feminist film criticism, and was considered a weakness by detractors, is a strong element of Wanda: the emphasis on the personal, the individual experience of a single woman remains the guiding narrative of the film. Feminism as “Otherness” &amp; Cinéma Vérité The politics of the feminist movement was, of course, not necessarily one shared by all female filmmakers represented in 1970s festivals, or by all those who are now celebrated as feminist auteurs. Certain women did not want to be marginalized or placed in a separate category out of fear that this would emphasize alterity and take away from the content of the work (Butler 2, 2012). Many women filmmakers chose to distance themselves from the “feminist cinema,” preferring instead to remain neutral, without alignment with any particular brand or message. In the opinion of certain directors, “feminism,” causing a film to be recognized for its feminist brand rather than its content, created a new variety of relegation to an lower class and thus could detract from the piece overall. As Alison Butler states, “some of the most distinguished practitioners of women’s cinema have deliberately distanced themselves from the notion, for professional and/or political reasons, to avoid marginalization or ideological controversy.. work, nevertheless, continues to be pulled into spaces of exhibition, criticism and debate defined in terms of gender, such as women’s festivals, conferences, courses and\n\nby female critics has been the adherence to patriarchal terms of categorization. In fact, “women’s cinema” is complicated in its very definition: for what exactly qualifies a motion picture film as a an element of “women’s cinema”? Alison Butler addresses this dilemma in her book Women’s Cinema: The Contested Screen: “women’s cinema is a notoriously difficult concept to define. It suggests, without clarity, films that might be made by, addressed to, or concerned with women, or all three.. is neither a genre nor a movement in film history, it has no single lineage of its own, no national boundaries, no filmic or aesthetic specificity, but traverses and negotiates cinematic and cultural traditions and critical and political debates.” (Butler 2002, 1). This ambiguous definition frees women’s motion picture films from the constraints of genre, history, aesthetics and nationality— it is a definition that can encompass various types of cinema, not all charged with “feminist” message. Butler continues “‘women’s cinema’ is a complex critical, theoretical, and institutional construction, brought into existence by audiences, film-makers, journalists, curators and academics and maintained only by their continuing interest: a hybrid concept, arising from a number of overlapping practices and discourses, and subject to a baffling variety of definitions” (Butler 2). By complicating the notion of “women’s cinema,” Butler’s intervention is helpful in that acknowledges the difficulty in creating a category for a group of films that do not share anything other than the fact that they are made by, made for, or feature women, and also that it gives credit to the complex network of creation-reception (adding to the formulations of Rich) that creates and sustains the idea of a “women’s cinema.” Again, we can return to Rich and her insistence that our focus must be drawn to the complex matrix of aesthetics-production-exhibition- intention-reception, for “aesthetics are.. on and subject to the work’s\n\nreception. The formal values of a film cannot be considered in isolation, cut off from thematic correspondents within the text and from the social determinants without. Reception by viewers as well as by critics is key to any film’s meaning... feminist cinema arose out of a need not only on the part of the filmmakers and writers, but on the part of the women they knew to be their audience” (Rich 1998, 80). In pointing out that feminist works are not isolated in their meaning, that rather they accumulate meaning through the complex relations created through the processes of production and reception, Rich draws our attention to the system in which films are made, viewed and understood. This system exists for all films and, in fact, feminist films, or, more accurately, we suggest, “women’s cinema” (though Rich takes issue with the characterization “women’s film” for being “vague and problematic,” I find the term “women’s cinema” useful in its versatility) are not exempt from this process, but may further rely upon this system since the recognition of female filmmakers came so late after the advent of cinema itself, and the sudden freedom that women had to tell their own stories, recount their own experiences and express their personal creative views made all the more significant and urgent the need to exhibit their films (Rich 1998, 62). Rich insists that these processes be recognized as fundamental within the category of films associated with feminism. Rich writes: Feminism has always emphasized process; now it’s time that this process of production and reception be inscribed within the critical text. How was the film made? With what intention? With what kind of crew? With what relationship to the subject? How was it produced? Who is distributing it? Where is it being shown? For what audience is it constructed? How is it available? How is it being\n\nsomehow more ‘real’ than the middle classes and theirs); (2) basing their films on real- life events as against made up stories; (3) their use of on-location shootings as against artificial studio sets and (4) Italian neo-realism and its cinematic techniques such as the long take, which was assumed to prevent the meddling with actuality assumed in montage, etc” (Kaplan 1983, 126). Although all these aspects of films are well observed, and were used in many films of the decade (such as Marta Meszaro’s The Girl, 1968, as well as Wanda), it does not fit comfortably within an agenda of liberation to name a style after one which as already been named with the language of the patriarchy (Rich 1998, 67). Rich argues that there must be a new language of feminism, which runs counter to the categories Kaplan uses. Instead of employing the term cinéma vérité, she argues for the word validative to be used in place, which she defines as The body of films about women’s lives, political struggles, organizing, and so on. These films have been vaguely classified under the cinéma vérité banner, where they reside in decidedly mixed company. Because they function as a validation and legitimation of women’s culture and individual lives, the name “validative” would be a better choice. It has the added advantage of aligning the work with products of oppressed peoples (with the filmmaker as insider), whereas the cinéma vérité label represents the oppressors, who make films as superior outsiders documenting alien, implicitly inferior cultures, often from a position of condescension (Rich 1998, 75).\n\nAmong the other new categories she names are correspondence films, reconstructive films, Medusan films, corrective realism, and projectile films (Rich, 1998, 74- 79). Rich advocates for the re-naming of familiar conventions in order to re-appropriate the very nature of these forms, and re-claim them as distinctly and originally female. She contends, “by employing the name validative in place of cinéma vérité, we can combat the patriarchal annexation of the woman filmmaker as one of the boys, that is, a professional who is not of the culture being filmed. It is a unifying name aimed at conserving strength.” (Rich 1998, 75) Although Rich makes no mention of the film in her book, Wanda certainly qualifies in her terms as a validative project, since it shows the story of a woman from the perspective of a woman, and functions to “legitimize an individual life” (Rich 1998, 75). Although the film may have been denounced as anti- validative by certain feminist critics of the time, the film’s goal of legitimizing personal experience through its exposition seems closely to align with Rich’s description of this category. To validate is not necessarily to endorse this experience, but to demonstrate the importance or force of such an experience through close examination. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, one accepted definition of “validate” is to make or declare something as having “force, pertinency or value.” (OED) In the case of Wanda, the mere fact that the film exists is validative. Loden is staking a claim to representation, and introducing a singular experience into the sphere of visibility, thus affirming the reality of such an experience, without endorsing its value. Although the film lacks happy resolution for its characters, to so candidly portray this kind of existence, simultaneously peripheral and universal, is to begin to articulate a new language and vision: that which I have called an experiential aesthetic as understood here through the validative model.
