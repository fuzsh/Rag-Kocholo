        "text": "She was cast as Beverly Abbott in Der Schwimmer (1968), a crucial part in that she has had an affair with the title character, played by Burt Lancaster. According to multiple biographies of Lancaster, Loden's performance overshadowed him in the scene, which was shot in 1966 by Frank Perry, who is credited as the director on the film. Lancaster was dissatisfied and had the role recast with Janice Rule and had the scene reshot by Sydney Pollack. Friction between Lancaster and Perry led to the director leaving the film.\n\nShe has appeared in two films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: Wilder Strom (1960) and Wanda (1970). She has also directed one film this is in the registry: Wanda."
