        "text": "For Märtha Louise, her relationship with Verett has shone a spotlight onto her understanding of racism and racist experiences, she said.\n\nA post shared by Durek Verrett (@shamandurek)\n\n\"To me, it's eye-opening to get to know Durek and see it first-hand and see how it still plays out in society,\" she told People. \"I've learned a lot about Black heritage and will continue to learn.\"\n\nMärtha Louise described her fiancé as a \"patient man\" who continues to guide her through issues in Black culture, white privilege, and how they as \"a couple must navigate peoples' fears and prejudices to demonstrate that love has no boundaries.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Märtha Louise, 50, has opened up about the learning curve she's experienced as a white woman dating a Black man. In an interview with Insider's Mikhaila Friel, she touched on what it was like to receive \"death threats\" after she and Verett announced their relationship back in 2019, saying that some people who have reached out to him described her as the \"white devil.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut despite the challenges presented, Märtha Louise said her relationship pushed her to acknowledge her white privilege for the first time.\n\n\"I never thought of myself as racist before I got together with Durek,\" Märtha Louise said. \"I also see through his eyes that racism isn't just the obvious headlines, it's the subtle energies. It's how people look at him ... even in elevators or on the street, they clasp their handbags closer.\"\n\nSpeaking to People following their engagement, Verett pointed out that Black royalty existed for centuries in the continent of Africa but has not been given the same amount of attention as those in Europe. His marriage to Märtha Louise, he said, \"will set a precedent for my people that we are not to be forgotten, and we deserve to be acknowledged for the greatness of who we are and where we come from.\"\n\n\"There's always been kings and queens in Africa, but unfortunately, they haven't been recognized in the world in the way that they deserve,\" he added.\n\nRepresentatives for Shaman Durek Verett and Princess Märtha Louise did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."
