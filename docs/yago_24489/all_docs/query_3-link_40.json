        "text": "Shaman Durek has called his marriage to Princess Märtha Louise of Norway ‘an act of god’ in a gushing interview given by the couple ahead of their wedding later this month.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise of Norway became engaged to Durek Verrett in June 2022. Verrett, her ‘shaman’ fiancé who has claimed to be a reincarnated Pharaoh, stirred controversy after the couple’s engagement when he was dropped by his publisher over pseudoscientific claims made in his book, Spirit Hacking: Shamanic keys to reclaim your personal power, transform yourself and light up the world. The Guardian cited suggestions in his book that cancer was a choice, as well as a ‘Spirit Optimiser’ medallion he sells on his website, which he claims helped him overcome Covid-19. He is well-known in celebrity circles and has previously worked with Gwyneth Paltrow, Nina Dobrev and James van der Beek.\n\nRead More\n\nHe’s the bad-boy chef whose butter videos go viral on Tiktok. But who is the real Thomas Straker – and is he actually dating a princess?\n\nIn Tatler’s September 2024 issue, the hottest chef on the planet spoke to Harriet Kean about working for a billionaire, that scandal and butter (of course)\n\nLast year the princess stunned the world when she announced that she was relinquishing her royal role to pursue her relationship with Durek, who has appeared in Netflix reality show Bling Empire. The move was reminiscent of that of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who infamously took a step back from royal life in 2020, albeit for entirely different reasons.\n\nThe couple, who will marry in the fjords of Norway on 31 August, gave a loving interview about the upcoming wedding this week. Appearing on Märtha Louise's podcast Heartsmart Conversations, the two spoke of their ‘beautiful’ relationship.\n\nReferring to the ‘big wedding’, which will bring together American A-listers and royalty, Durek spoke of the significance of marriage in his life. He said, 'To me marriage isn't just you getting married to someone, it is literally an act before God, that I am merging my life with her children, with her family, with my family, and really showing up.\n\n'That's something that I really love about myself, I love that I'm the type of man that shows up. I love being able to show up for her, I love showing up for her kids, and I love how my family shows up for her, and I love how her family shows up for me.\n\n'It's a beautiful relationship. Everyone is loving each other. It's a beautiful, beautiful expression of what family should be, and what love should be.\n\nRead More\n\nIrrepressibly mischievous, wild, and once known as the baddest boy there was: inside the world of the Duke of Marlborough, as he is photographed with his new companion at Blenheim Palace\n\nIn this feature, first published in 2015, David Jenkins questioned if peace had finally come to Jamie Blandford…and what sort of man he is\n\n'And I would not have asked for her hand in marriage, if I hadn't known in my soul that I'm going to spend the rest of my life with this woman and live every single breath I have to make her happy.'\n\nMärtha Louise said, 'We're looking very much forward to our wedding... which is not far away right now.\n\n'It's really going to be nice for me because I have so much love for Norway... I'm just really excited about all my friends coming from all over the world to this wedding, not just to witness our love but to also witness Norway.' continued Durek.\n\nAhead of the wedding, she has discussed their love story in more detail, telling Point De Vue her partner ‘one of the most funny’ men she knows. Meanwhile she also defended his outspoken nature, saying, ‘Durek doesn't hide anything, he says things’.\n\nRead More\n\nThe cult of ‘Meghanomania’: while a member of the royal family, the Duchess of Sussex has certainly divided, but has she conquered?\n\nIn the May 2019 issue of Tatler, David Jenkins wrote about the 365 days that had passed since Meghan Markle’s marriage to Prince Harry. Now, many of the anecdotes of courtier gossip and fall outs with friends ring resoundingly true, as the Duke officially changes his primary residence to US and the Duchess launches American Riviera Orchard\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise has previously admitted that her decision to quit has also led to some family fallout and briefly impacted her relationship with her parents, the reigning King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway. She told BBC News that she felt that she had no choice but to step back because of the views of the Norwegian people regarding her engagement.\n\nShe said: ‘There’s been so much turmoil with me, you know, taking a different path than being a traditional royal, there’s been a lot of criticism through the years, especially with me being spiritual, and in Norway that’s taboo.’ ‘The Norwegian people I guess... have decided it's best for me to step down because of his views about things,’ she added."
