        "text": "Well, according to King Harald, The Royal Court and several Norwegian authors, she died of these reasons:\n\nFrom 1946 to her death in 1954, she suffered from various illnesses, such as, sciatica and jaundice. During this period, she was frequently hospitalized, and spent some recuperative time in Florida. She had several remissions, but never fully recovered from it. After another attack in early March 1954, she was again hospitalized. - And on March 21th, the family celebrated the CP couple’s silver wedding anniversary at the hospital.\n\nShe died quietly on April 5th at the Rikshospitalet, surrounded by her husband CP Olav, her father-in-law King Haakon VII, her children, her sister Princess Margaretha, and her brother-in-law Prince Axel. Her brother Prince Carl Bernadotte was delayed by the weather.\n\nThe cause of death was (according to King Harald and The Royal Court) hepatitis, and the infection had occurred after a Blood transfusion - in connection with an operation in the United States during the war years.\n\nHer death led to an outpouring of public grief.\n\nPrince Carl's was such a happy, close-knit family. It's heartbreaking what happened to them.\n\nOT but I was shocked to discover only this year that Märtha & Olav had to fight for their relationship for more than five years because his parents were afraid that a Swedish princess would be to much for the Norwegians to stomach and because they were first cousins.\n\nPrince Carl's was such a happy, close-knit family. It's heartbreaking what happened to them.\n\nNot too bad, considering quoth Ingeborg: \"I married a stranger.\"\n\nI'm sure they were, but then Astrid was a very anxious and shy child who thought her mother favored Märtha and her brother, Märtha seems to have been at least anxious about her looks and not quite as confident as Astrid thought, and Carl Jr. being the spoiled baby boy didn't seem to help him. Family stuff.\n\nOT but I was shocked to discover only this year that Märtha & Olav had to fight for their relationship for more than five years because his parents were afraid that a Swedish princess would be to much for the Norwegians to stomach and because they were first cousins.\n\nThis actually lends some credence to the side of Olav being Haakon's son. Because first cousins marrying is one thing, but first cousins being hypocritical and telling their child he can't do the same thing is, well. Like Harald said. \"Haven't you noticed everyone around here is a little funny-looking?\" I think I remember hearing Olav and Märtha actually did go consult the 1920's equivalent of a geneticist to see if it would be okay.\n\nNot too bad, considering quoth Ingeborg: \"I married a stranger.\"\n\nI'm sure they were, but then Astrid was a very anxious and shy child who thought her mother favored Märtha and her brother, Märtha seems to have been at least anxious about her looks and not quite as confident as Astrid thought, and Carl Jr. being the spoiled baby boy didn't seem to help him.

Like Harald said. \"Haven't you noticed everyone around here is a little funny-looking?\" I think I remember hearing Olav and Märtha actually did go consult the 1920's equivalent of a geneticist to see if it would be okay.\n\nThere were more concerns about genetics and inbreeding, later on. So its quite possible that 2 first cousins who married might feel it wasn't a good idea for their children to marry first cousins.\n\nDid Martha and Olav have to get consent from their respective churches that it was religiously acceptable for first cousins to wed?\n\nI don't remember a thing about Maud and Carl needing any kind of dispensation (or further back, Victoria and Albert) so I'm going to say that Protestant churches do not seem to care and this holds true for Märtha and Olav.\n\nEurope in general has always cared less about cousin marriage than the Catholic or Orthodox churches, or the US, where it's probably still illegal in some (many?) states.\n\nHow was the relationship between Martha and Margaretha who married Prince Axel of Denmark , the only Son of Prince Valdemar and Princess Marie who did a Royal Wedding .\n\nIn Queen Astrid story books it was written that here parents had to leave their house (money problem) and with her diamond Ring Princess Ingeborg wrote on a Window she hoped that the followers should be so happy as they were.\n\nFrom what I've read the relationship between the adult sisters was warm and very close. As was their relationship to their parents and their rascal brother. Margaretha, or \"Tante Ta\" as she was called by her younger relatives, stepped in after the deaths of her sisters to offer support, comfort and a motherly figure to her nieces and nephews. She did the same for her cousin Gustav VI Adolf after the death of their respective partners and by all accounts remained the heart of her extended family until her death in 1977.\n\nWhen did Princess Martha come to Norway? Did she have a Lady in Waiting? Was there another Princess in Oslo Norway from about 1912-1922?\n\nShe came in 1929 to marry Olav and become the Crown Princess. I'm sure she had a lady-in-waiting, although I don't know who. Prior to that the royal family consisted of King Haakon, Queen Maud, and the Crown Prince. No princesses."
