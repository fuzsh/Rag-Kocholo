        "text": "The most delayed event on the European royal calendar that will finally take place this August is the wedding of Princess Märtha Louise of Norway to the shaman Durek Verrett. King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway have up to three different summer residences and a large yacht, but the wedding will not take place at any of these venues, but at the Hotel Union Geiranger, located in a discreet village by a fjord.\n\nThis event, which will take place on August 31st, has faced delays, only multiplying doubts about the groom due to his shocking statements. He even went as far as saying that cancer is a product of unhappiness and selling an amulet to protect against Covid-19 during the pandemic. However, Märtha Louise seems more concerned about the statements the mother of Verrett makes to the press against her son. This is why she threatened her with legal action a few days ago.\n\nOn the same date, another wedding will be celebrated which will likely be attended by Felipe VI, that of Victoria López-Quesada de Borbón-Dos Sicilias, who is the goddaughter of the King, and Enrique Moreno de la Cova, grandson of the Count of Ybarra.\n\nIn the UK, it will be the second summer without Queen Elizabeth II, and it is known that the Windsors' relationship with the royal residences is like a game of musical chairs. After opening Balmoral Castle in the Scottish Highlands to the public for the first time in history, the month of August is once again solely for the enjoyment of Charles III and his family. So far, it has not been commented on whether the British king has already moved to the grand Victorian castle or maintains his country house, Birkhall, within the same estate, which is much less monumental and likely more comfortable than the main building.\n\nFrom the Princes of Wales, who usually choose various destinations for August, it is expected that after this difficult year for them, they will spend a quiet and discreet vacation in several locations. One of them is Anmer Hall, their country house near Sandringham House, where they already spent Easter. It is said that in the last days of July they were seen on the island of Tresco, off the coast of Cornwall, where they had spent previous summers. It is also likely that they will spend a few days in Scotland, where they normally travel in the final weeks of summer. However, as reiterated by the Kensington Palace, everything is subject to Middleton's recovery.\n\nBalmoral is also a recurring holiday destination for Peter Phillips, Zara Tindall, and their mother, Princess Anne, who will turn 74 on August 15 and has various engagements scheduled in the north of the United Kingdom between the 5th and 29th of this month.\n\nThe vacations of the Belgian kings are very calm, inclined to choose places that provide them with anonymity. They have the impressive castle of Ciergnon in the south of their country, but for years they have preferred to go unnoticed in the very discreet and undeveloped island of Yeu, in the Bay of Biscay, in August. There, they first rented a residence and later bought a house. Until August 10th, the four children of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, the princes Elisabeth, Gabriel, Emmanuel, and Eleonore, will be supporting various compatriots at the Olympic Games, and afterwards, they are expected to move to Yeu, where on August 20th, they will celebrate Prince Gabriel's 21st birthday.\n\nIn Paris, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden will also be until August 11th, after which they are expected to split their time between Solliden Palace on the island of Öland and Villa Mirage on the coast of Saint-Tropez.\n\nThe Danes, in the first summer of Frederick X's reign as king, seem to have had no problems in dividing up the Château de Cayx, the vineyard estate in southern France where Queen Margrethe II used to gather the family in the summer. Prince Joachim's son, Count Nicolai of Monpezat, who turns 25 on August 28, has spent the last weeks of July there with his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Frederick and Mary of Denmark have inaugurated this year the palace of Gråsten as kings and may be considering skipping a few days at the French château.\n\nFar from their kingdom, Willem-Alexander and Máxima of the Netherlands also spend their vacations. Every July, the Orange-Nassau family offers a summer photo shoot in a typically Dutch setting (which has not yet taken place this year due to their presence at the Games), but for their August vacations, they choose the Mediterranean. In 2012, they bought a luxurious estate in southern Greece for four and a half million euros, which previously belonged to the photographer Manfred Rieker. In the area, Prince Pavlos and Marie-Chantal of Greece also vacation, and on August 12, they will celebrate the 24th birthday of their third son, Achilles."
