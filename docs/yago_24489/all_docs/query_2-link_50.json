        "text": "What was your first reaction when you were approached to play in Atlantic Crossing? Had you heard of Crown Princess Märtha’s role during WW2 and close relationship with Franklin D Roosevelt?\n\nSofia Helin: I was actually surprised that I had never heard of the story of Crown Princess Märtha who had done something big for her country, democracy and peace during WW2. I had never heard either that she had a special relationship with Roosevelt. I wasn’t so much into royalty at the time but got interested in her at once, and immediately said yes to the part.\n\nHow did you prepare for your part?\n\nSH: I prepared by going to the castle in Sweden and learned how to sit, walk, talk, eat, drink-in other words, behave in a ‘royal’ manner. I learned Norwegian for several months, and watched a lot of archive material about Märtha. I also studied other royals in Europe as many are related.\n\nWhat particular aspect of Crown Princess Märtha's life did you find interesting? It seems like she was very committed to her duties, and she was also perceived as 'the queen of the people’ like Princess Diana...\n\nSH: Yes I found interesting to find similarities between Märtha and Diana, the way they moved, behaved in front of the camera, with a mix of shyness and humour. I watched a speech that Märtha gave in front of more than 10,000 people in Madison Square Garden in New York. She was very uncomfortable but did it for the sake of democracy and freedom. For me the bravest persons are those who dare to push themselves out of their comfort zone. Diana and Märtha were also both compassionate women, who took on activities outside their royal duties. Diana helped people with Aids during the 80s and Märtha helped homeless people during WW2. She was politically engaged, but never took honours for what she did during the war.\n\nHow was it to play against Kyle MacLachlan and Tobias Santelmann?\n\nSH: Both are gentlemen! It was a joy to see Kyle transform into FDR - with every little detail, like watching someone create a sculpture. Tobias is also extremely talented as an actor and a very warm person. Playing his wife was easy.\n\nYou've played Crown Princess Märtha and you've been the commentator of C More/TV4’s documentary Drottningarna (The Queens) featuring eight Swedish queens. Do you have a favourite one? What vision do you have of today's royals? Are they still relevant?\n\nSH: One of the most interesting queens was perhaps Louisa Ulrika of Prussia [1720-1782], mother of Gustav III who was tough, power hungry and did a lot for Sweden’s cultural life. Today’s royals are like a big family and I do believe they are still relevant. Many try to use their status to do good, such as Queen Sylvia who has founded an organisation to fight against sexual abuse of children, and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden who has been supportive of the #MeToo movement. I would definitely vote for them if I could!"
