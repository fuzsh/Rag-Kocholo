        "text": "While people are upset about some of the creative liberties taken in Atlantic Crossing this part actually did happen. In 1940, the Nazis invaded Norway so the government evacuated Crown Princess Märtha and her three children to Sweden and then to the United States. Märtha was a Swedish princess by birth and stayed with her family there but some people were not happy with the Crown Princess of Norway taking refuge in Sweden because it put their neutrality at risk. Her family wanted her to stay but she decided to go to the US during the war. Her mother, Princess Ingeborg, gave her the tiara and the rest of the parure wrapped in a scarf at Stockholm Central Station and told her to sell it if she needed money to support her family. Thankfully, Märtha and her children were able to safely return to Norway in 1945 and she didn’t have to sell the parure. It’s still worn today by Märtha’s daughter-in-law, Queen Sonja of Norway, and is probably her most worn tiara or at least it’s the one I most associate with her.\n\nThe Leuchtenberg Emerald Parure Tiara was most likely a wedding present to Princess Augusta, Duchess of Leuchtenberg, from her husband’s stepfather, Emperor Napoleon, in 1806 and if it’s not from them then it from around that time. The parure traveled to Brazil with Empress Amélie and then to her sister, Queen Josephine of Sweden. It descended through the family until it was given to Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, the mother of Crown Princess Märtha of Norway, Queen Astrid of Belgium, and Princess Margaretha of Denmark. She was the sibling, parent, grandparent, or cousin of basically all the Scandinavian royals and some of the non-Scandi ones too so she was at all of the big events and was very generous with loaning out her jewelry which I appreciate. I’ve been updating my Scandinavian tiara posts recently so I’ve seen a lot of Ingeborg and there’s a few more of her tiaras coming up if you are someone that follows my regular site. Ingeborg did make some controversial changes to the parure because by the time it got to her it did not have any earrings so she had the pear shaped emerald right next to the big rectangular center emerald on the tiara removed to make some. You can see that they are still in place in the pictures of her below but in the pictures of Märtha above they have been replaced with diamond palmettes and she wearing the pear emeralds as earrings. The Leuchtenberg Sapphire Parure also from Augusta that’s still in Sweden had missing earrings too and some were later created from hairpins. The theory is that neither Queen Sophia or Queen Victoria of Sweden wore earrings so they gave them away or had them made into other jewelry. The change certainly makes the big central emerald stand out more which most people don’t like and thinks that make the tiara look less balanced. There also used to be seven pendants on the necklace (Queen Sonja is wearing one of them above right) that she distributed among her children. The ones that went to Queen Astrid were eventually used to make Grand Duchess Joséphine Charoltte of Luxembourg’s Emerald Peacock Tiara.\n\nI first read the story about the emeralds on Trond Norén Isaksen’s website. He’s a Norwegian royal historian and presumably Princess Astrid, Crown Princess Märtha’s daughter, told it to him when he was interviewing her for her official biography. Then in 2011, Queen Silvia of Sweden also told it in the documentary about royal jewels, De Kongelige Juveler. The Norwegian royals declined participating in that documentary or Kungliga Smycken in 2020. They really are much more private about their jewels compared to the other Scandinavian monarchies but we luckily still know a lot because so much of their jewelry passed through Sweden or Denmark first. The bit about the tiara is at the 20 minute mark. Queen Silvia speaks in English but you can turn on the captions to get English for the narrator’s part."
