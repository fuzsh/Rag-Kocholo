The new post will talk about Princess Märtha of Sweden.\n\nHer family\n\nMärtha Sofia Lovisa Dagmar Thyra of Sweden was born on 28 March 1901\n\nas the second child of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland and\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the younger brother of\n\nKing Gustaf V of Sweden. Her mother was the younger sister of\n\nKing Christian X of Denmark and of King Haakon VII of Norway. What's\n\nall in the family?\n\nThere were even more family ties! Märtha had an elder sister who became\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Denmark and a younger sister who became Queen\n\nAstrid of Belgium.\n\nLove and Marriage?\n\nPrincess Märtha of Sweden became engaged to Olav of Norway, who was\n\nher first cousin. The engagement took place during the Olympic Summer\n\nGames of Amsterdam (The Netherlands) in 1928. This news was well\n\nreceived in both the countries. It was an excellent match in terms of\n\nstrenghtening the ties. However this match was based on love!\n\nOn 21 March 1929, Princess Märtha married Olav in the Olso Cathedral.\n\nThis was the first royal wedding in Norway for 340 years! It was attended\n\nby many guests.\n\nMärtha soon became a popular and respected member of the royal family.\n\nShe made a lot of official engagement and she even gave many speeches.\n\nIn 1935, Princess Märtha's sister, Astrid died in Küssnacht. The siblings\n\nalways had been very close and Märtha's husband later said that it took\n\nhis wife for more than ten years to come to terms with it. Together with\n\nher elder sister, Margaretha, she became a support for her sister's children\n\nin Belgium.\n\nIn 1938, Crown Princess Märtha became the senior lady of the court after\n\nthe death of her mother-in-law, Queen Maud.\n\nThe Crown Prince and his wife, princess Märtha visited in 1939, the\n\nUnited States of America. There she became friends of Franklin Roosevelt,\n\nthe president, and his wife Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nWorld War II\n\nOn 26 January 1940, Princess Märtha made a public announcement in\n\nwhich she encouraged Norwegian women to take part in the mobilization\n\nwork.\n\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in April 1940, the Crown Princess and\n\nher children fled to Sweden, however her native country didn't receive\n\nher well!\n\nFollowing an invitation by Franklin Roosevelt, she went to the United\n\nStates on the United State Army transport, American Legion.\n\nIn the US she and her children initially stayed at the White House.\n\nCrown Prince Olav, Märtha's husband however, and his father went to\n\nthe United Kingdom. Thus the couple was separated for much of the war.\n\nIn 1942, the US presented the exiled Norwegian forces with a gift of the\n\nsubmarine chaser HNoMS King Haakon VII, which was officially\n\nreceived by Crown Princess Märtha.\n\nHer impressive work to assist the American Red Cross and on behalf\n\nof the Norwegian interests greatly impressed Roosevelt and influenced\n\nhis Look to Norway speech in 1942.\n\nPrincess Märtha spent much of World War II in the United States of\n\nAmerica. She tried to keep up support for Norway among the American\n\npublic and government.\n\nIn 1942, she visited London to take part in the birthday celebrations of\n\nher father-in-law. When she returned to Norway after the war, in 1945,\n\nshe received a hero's welcome and was called the \"Mother of the Nation\".\n\nAfter World War II\n\nPrincess Märtha died of cancer at the National Hospital in Oslo on\n\n5 April 1954. At the time of her death, her elder daughter Ragnild\n\nwas expecting her first child. She never became Queen of Norway.\n\nHer death was a great loss for her husband, the future King Olav,\n\nfor her children and for Norway as well.\n\nPeople and things named after her\n\nThere were things called in her honor inter alia:\n\n* the Princess Märtha Coast in Antartica\n\n* A ship Kronprinsesse Martha was named after her.\n\n* in Sweden the Princess Cake was named for Märtha and her two\n\nsisters when they were chidren.\n\nAnd perhaps the most loviest of all:\n\nKing Harald V of Norway, her son, named his daughter Princess\n\nMärtha Louise after her grandmother.\n\nSource pictures: Wikipedia\n\nWho is who? de Liedekerke family!\n\nOnly a few noble families are intertwined with the history of a country.
