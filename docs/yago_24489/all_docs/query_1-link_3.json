        "text": "Princess Märtha Louise of Norway, fourth in line to the Norwegian throne, announced her engagement in June 2022 to American shaman Durek Verrett. As Princess Märtha Louise is the oldest child of King Harald and Queen Sonja, Verett reportedly asked the royals for their daughter's hand in marriage.\n\n\"I'm very old-fashioned in the way I do things. Therefore, I sat down with King Harald and Queen Sonja and asked for their daughter's hand in marriage. If they had said no, I would not have gone ahead with it. I do things in an honorable and respectful way,\" Verett explained to Billed Bladet.\n\nHere's everything we know about their wedding:\n\nThe wedding will take place on Saturday, August 31, 2024.\n\nIn September 2023, they shared their wedding date: August 31, 2024 at Hotel Union in Geiranger, Norway. \"Geiranger is known for its spectacular fjord and its dramatic mountains. The Geirangerfjord is on the UNESCO World Heritage List and represents Norway's rich culture and natural beauty,\" Märtha Louise wrote on Instagram. \"We're so happy to be celebrating our love in the beautiful surroundings of Geiranger. It means a lot to us to gather our loved ones in a place that is so rich in history and intense nature experiences. Geiranger is the perfect place to embrace our love.\"\n\nPriest Margit Lovise Holte will marry the couple. Durek posted, \"We are delighted to announce that Parish Priest Margit Lovise Holte will officiate our wedding in Geiranger on August 31st, following the Norwegian Church's wedding liturgy. Reverend Michael Beckwith will also participate in the ceremony with a greeting. We look forward to this beautiful day with great joy.\"\n\nFestivities will begin on Thursday, August 29.\n\nThe wedding weekend will begin on August 29 with a welcome party at Hotel 1904 in Ålesund, per Hello. On August 30, guests will take a boat trip along the Geiranger Fjord to Geiranger village for a pre-wedding party at Hotel Union.\n\nThe Norwegian royals will attend.\n\nKing Harald and Queen Sonja said in a statement, \"We are delighted to welcome Durek Verret into the family and we look forward to celebrating the big day with them. We wish Märtha and Durek all the best.\" Crown Prince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marrit, similarly said in a statement, \"We congratulate Princess Märtha and Durek Verret on their wedding in August next year. We are happy for them and look forward to celebrating with them in Geiranger. We wish Märtha, Durek and the girls all the best for the future.\"\n\nHello reports that foreign royals will also be in attendance, but it's as yet unclear who.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise and Shaman Durek got engaged in June 2022.\n\nBack in June 2022, the happy couple shared news of their engagement on social media. The Norwegian princess wrote, \"I am so happy to announce that I am engaged to Shaman Durek, the one who makes my heart skip, the one who sees me and acknowledges me from my highest potential, who makes me laugh and who I can be vulnerable with. Love transcends and makes us grow. And I am so happy to continue to grow with this beautiful man. Thank you to all my friends and family who have stood steadfast by our side.\"\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise in 2018.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise announced her relationship with \"Shaman Durek\" in May 2019, writing on social media, \"When you meet your twin flame, you know. I have been lucky enough to have met mine. @shamandurek has changed my life, like he does with so many.\"\n\nShe continued, \"He has made me realize that unconditional love actually exists here on this planet. He embraces all of me without question or fear. He makes me laugh more than anyone, has the most profound wisdom to share and all the bits in between from the diversity of his being.\"\n\nPerhaps intuiting there would be criticism of Verrett surrounding his work, the princess continued, \"And to those of you who feel the need to criticize: Hold your horses. It is not up to you to choose for me or to judge me. I don’t choose my man to satisfy any of you or the norms or boxes you have chosen in your mind for me to be in. I don’t thrive there, nor do I exist in your illusion about me. I choose from love. And that’s it. Shaman Durek is merely a man I love spending my time with and who fulfills me. So thank you for respecting my actions and my choice of partner. All I know at this moment is that we love each other and I am super happy.\"\n\nMärtha Louise gave up her royal duties ahead of her wedding.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise is not unfamiliar with controversy; she has faced backlash as she describes herself as a clairvoyant. In 2019, the royal court said she would not be permitted to use her royal title in a \"commercial context.\" In November 2022, Princess Märtha Louise gave up her royal duties.\n\nVerrett describes himself as \"a 6th generation shaman\" and he is the author of a book, . The LA-based guru with Gwyneth Paltrow, Selma Blair, Nina Dobrev, and Rosario Dawson, among other celebrities. \"I think his appeal is that he is both very human, and other worldly,\" Gwyneth Paltrow said of Verrett through a spokesperson to . \"He hugs and receives hugs with the openness of a child; he has that purity of heart. He’s disarming with big laughs but can uncannily tell you everything about yourself just by touching the bones in your arm.\"\n\nPrincess Martha-Louise of Norway and Durek Verrett, June 2022.\n\n\"It’s a bit challenging for people to see something new, to evolve past their comfort zones. We try to understand where people are and find ways to bring about more education so people can start to see things differently and be comfortable with change,\" Verrett told Town & Country about the perception of their relationship. \"It requires a lot of compassion. It requires a lot of love, a lot of patience. Märtha once said something really beautiful: ‘Just because people have their judgments and their beliefs, that just shows where they’re at in their capacity for love. It doesn’t mean we should change our capacity for love because we see differently.\""
