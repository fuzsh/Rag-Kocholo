        "text": "In recent decades, royals around the world have relinquished their official roles because of scandals and family feuds, or to marry commoners or divorcées. This week, a Norwegian princess quit her royal duties over her love for a modern-day shaman.\n\nPrincess Martha Louise, the 51-year-old daughter of King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, got engaged in June to Durek Verrett, an American celebrity shaman and the inventor of the Spirit Optimizer — a healing amulet that he sells on his website for $222.\n\nSince their engagement, the Norwegian news media and the public have kept a spotlight on Mr. Verrett, criticizing him for saying he used the amulet to fight the coronavirus, for having suggested that cancer was a choice and for having said that he was a “hybrid species of reptilian.”\n\n“Every time a person in the royal family gets engaged it creates media storms,” Martha Louise said in a cheerful Instagram video this week, “so also this time.”\n\nAfter the recent “media discussions,” she added, she, Mr. Verrett and the royal family made “some adjustments,” including her dropping her official roles.\n\nFrom now on, the princess and Mr. Verrett “are seeking to distinguish more clearly between their activities and the Royal House of Norway,” the royal family said in a statement, in which they thanked her for performing her duties “with warmth, care and deep commitment.” Martha Louise will keep her title, but the couple “will not indicate an association with the Royal House of Norway in their social media channels.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
