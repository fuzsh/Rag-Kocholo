        "text": "The wedding of Princess Märtha Louise of Norway and fiancé Durek Verrett is fast approaching. With a four-day August celebration on the banks of Geiranger, a UNESCO-listed fjord, the event will encapsulate the couple’s bohemian vibes with a meet-and-greet party (dress code: ‘sexy and cool’), a three-hour boat trip around the Norwegian coastline, and evenings of dinner and dancing.\n\nIndeed, while the match has the blessing of her parents King Harald and Queen Sonja, the relationship between Märtha Louise, proclaimed clairvoyant, and Durek Verrett, the bisexual ‘shaman’ with an enormous Instagram followers and a number of Hollywood connections (including Gwyneth Paltrow), has always been idiosyncratic. Nowhere is their unique bond more clearly encapsulated than their monogram, which Princess Märtha Louise revealed on Instagram yesterday.\n\nThe monogram – which is ‘unofficial’ since Märtha Louise made a Sussex-style step-back from royal life in 2022, relinquishing her titles and patronages – is a combination of their initials, styled in the manner of Egyptian hieroglyphs. While the couple officially first met in 2019 after being introduced by a mutual friend, they claim to have already known each other from a past life, where they ruled together somewhere slightly more temperate than the Norwegian fjords – the pyramids of ancient Egypt.\n\n‘When we’re together and I look at [Märtha], sometimes I see another face,’ Verrett told People after they took their relationship public. ‘And she sees it in me, too. I have memories of us in Egypt, and she was my queen and I was a pharaoh.’\n\nOn Instagram, Princess Märtha Louise – who is fourth in line to the throne of Norway, which will be inherited by her younger brother, HRH Crown Prince Haakon, 49 due to male-preference primogeniture – further explained the hieroglyphs behind their marital monogram. The ‘M’, for Martha, apparently symbolises ‘The wise owl, a guardian of souls navigating between worlds.’ She continued: ‘The owl represents the protector, guiding humans through the passage from the earthly existence to the spirit world.’\n\nThe scintillating histories of the Mitford sisters, as Outrageous begins filming\n\nRead More\n\nAs for the ‘D’ for Durek, Märtha Louise wrote that the hieroglyph ‘manifests as the hand – a symbol of actions performed with grace, opening doors and dancing through life.’\n\nThe Princess honoured the artistic team behind the symbol, thanking them for ‘embrasing [sic] both of our souls into this representation of the two of us’.\n\nAnd the monogram, with its deeply spiritual resonances, is certainly a representation of the couple’s relationship, which has had its fair share of open doors and controversies across the years. When the Princess first announced that she was dating ‘Shaman Durek’ in 2019, she preempted the public backlash with social media post, writing: 'He has made me realize that unconditional love actually exists here on this planet...And to those of you who feel the need to criticize: Hold your horses. It is not up to you to choose for me or to judge me. I don’t choose my man to satisfy any of you or the norms or boxes you have chosen in your mind for me to be in.'\n\nThe couple spent the early days of their relationship promoting one of Verrett’s spiritual guidance tomes, Spirit Hacking: Shamanic keys to reclaim your personal power, transform yourself and light up the world. Speaking to DailyMailTV at the LA event launch event (which was attended by Bonnie Wright and Gerard Butler), Princess Märtha Louise was effusive with praise for her new beau’s book: ‘I find that every page there's something new to ponder upon, like a surprise or an in-depth new door opening. I see how it can inspire us to open up to our own powers.' As for her own powers, Princess Märtha Louise has claimed to be a clairvoyant, with the capacity to communicate with angels and animals.\n\nHowever, shortly after their engagement, the alleged reincarnated Pharaoh Verrett was dropped by his publishers over pseudoscientific claims in Spirit Hacking. The Guardian cited suggestions in his book that cancer was a choice, as well as a ‘Spirit Optimiser’ medallion he sells on his website, which he claims helped him overcome Covid-19.\n\nThis was followed in 2022 by Princess Märtha Louise stepping down from royal duties, a process she described as full of ‘turmoil’, due to a lack of public acceptance regarding her alternative beliefs.\n\n‘There’s been so much turmoil with me, you know, taking a different path than being a traditional royal,’ the Princess told The Times. ‘There’s been a lot of criticism through the years, especially with me being spiritual, and in Norway that’s taboo.’ She added, referencing the controversial beliefs of her partner, that ‘the Norwegian people I guess... have decided it's best for me to step down because of his views about things.’\n\nRead More\n\nServing up the glamour: how the tennis WAGs became off-court royalty\n\nFrom Roland-Garros to Flushing Meadows, it’s game, set and match to the tennis WAGs who have been elevated far beyond being just their partner’s No 1 fan. Morgan Riddle, Paige Lorenze, Ayan Broomfield and Louise Jacobi reveal all to Tatler\n\nHowever, unlike with the stepping back of another royal ‘spare’, Princess Märtha Louise’s decision did not impact her relationship with her family. ‘What has been amazing through this whole cycle has been the conversations we've all had through it all,’ she told the outlet. In reference to her parents, King Harald and Queen Sonja, she said: ‘From a very young age I remember my mum and dad saying we have to stick together, we have to talk things through even if it’s hard, we have to put all the cards on the table because we are family and we have to work things through all the turmoil.’"
