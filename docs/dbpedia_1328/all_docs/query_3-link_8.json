        "text": "Every player has their own interesting story, which is especially true in the NBA D-League. But every now and again, you will find someone who seems destined for more based off their previous accomplishments despite being dealt an unfavorable hand, and former Austin Peay player Travis Betran fits into that category.\n\nBetran has fought adversity since the very beginning, and now the 6–3, 185 pound guard hopes to showcase his mental toughness in addition to his on the court skills this season in the NBADL.\n\nDLeagueDigest.com spoke with Betran, and found out that there’s more to the Harlem, New York native than what meets the eye.\n\nThis past August, Betran signed a deal to play in Belgium for VOO Wolves Verviers-Pepinster, yet that experience is what ultimately led Betran to decide on testing out the D-League. “When I went overseas I didn’t get a good vibe. They didn’t have anything ready. They didn’t have anything set up for us as far as an apartment goes, and the money was late. So I decided to leave and pursue the NBA D-League because of the exposure that I’ll get, and to also pursue my NBA dream,” Betran explained recently.\n\nPersevering and finding the light at the end of the tunnel is what Betran is all about. Following two junior college years at Kilgore College in Texas, Betran ultimately landed at Austin Peay despite originally committing to Oklahoma State. A series of events outside of his control led Betran to have to look elsewhere despite having his bag literally packed for Oklahoma State, and with calls from St. Johns, and even SMU, Betran settled on Austin Peay and never looked back.\n\nYet, the decision to go and play for Austin Peay came late in the school year. In fact, Betran arrived to school a week after it had started, and his team had already taken a trip to Canada for team building purposes. Betran had to fit in fast if he wanted to succeed in the manner that he knew he could, and that’s exactly what he did. In his junior season, Betran led Austin Peay in scoring (in fact, Betran has led his team in scoring during all four years of college ball). Teams adjusted to Betran’s game during his senior year, which led to slightly lower scoring numbers, but the dynamic guard still posted 15.8 points, 1.4 rebounds, and 2.4 assists in 33.2 minutes over 30 games. Betran also left Austin Peay as its top single-season (87.7 percent/107–122) and career (86.1 percent/199–231) free-throw shooter.\n\nWhat really indicates the type of person Betran is on the court and off of it, can be based on his difficult childhood. “A strength of mine is that I can go through adversity. I was adopted when I was four years old by my Aunt because my neighbors called ACS (Administration for Children’s Services) due to my parents being abusive (intoxicants) and becoming incapable of taking care of me. After ACS was contacted I went to a foster home for two days and then my Aunt adopted me. I lived with her until I was 16 when she passed away. After she passed, I went to live with my older brother and he sent me to prep school in Marietta, Georgia. After that I went to junior college in Texas and then to Austin Peay.”\n\nBetran continued, “I started playing basketball when I was 16 in high school as a way to get off the streets. I know I’m not supposed to make it to the NBA, I know that it’s extremely difficult to make it, but I know if I work hard enough I can at least put myself in a position to have an opportunity to make it.”\n\nBetran will be available in the upcoming NBA D-League draft after being tendered and returning a NBADL contract. Look for Betran to continue his hard fought basketball journey, and to possibly turn heads during the process in the NBA D-League this upcoming season."
