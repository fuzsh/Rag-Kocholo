        "text": "Given the potential synaptic role for SUSD4, its pattern of expression should correlate with the timing of synapse formation and/or maturation during postnatal development. In situ hybridization experiments using mouse brain sections showed high expression of Susd4 mRNA in neurons in many regions of the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the brainstem (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Susd4 expression was already detected as early as postnatal day 0 (P0) in some regions but increased with brain maturation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In the cerebellum, a structure where the developmental sequence leading to circuit formation and maturation is well described (Sotelo, 2004), quantitative RT-PCR showed that Susd4 mRNA levels start increasing at P7 and by P21 reach about 15 times the levels detected at birth (Figure 1B). At P7, a major increase in synaptogenesis is observed in the cerebellum. At this stage, hundreds of thousands of PF excitatory synapses form on the distal dendritic spines of each PC, and a single CF arising from an inferior olivary neuron translocates and forms about 300 excitatory synapses on proximal PC dendrites (Leto et al., 2016). In the brainstem, where cell bodies of inferior olivary neurons are located, the increase in Susd4 mRNA expression occurs earlier, already by P3, and reaches a peak by P14 (Figure 1B). Similarly to the cerebellum, this pattern of Susd4 expression parallels the rate of synaptogenesis that increases during the first postnatal week in the inferior olive (Gotow and Sotelo, 1987). To identify the subcellular localization of the SUSD4 protein and because of the lack of suitable antibodies for immunolabeling, viral particles enabling CRE-dependent coexpression of HA-tagged SUSD4 and GFP in neurons were injected in the cerebellum of adult mice expressing the CRE recombinase specifically in cerebellar PCs. Immunofluorescent labeling against the HA tag demonstrated the localization of HA-SUSD4 in dendrites and in some of the numerous dendritic spines present on the surface of distal dendrites (Figure 1C). These spines are the postsynaptic compartments of PF synapses in PCs. Immunofluorescence analysis of transduced cultured PCs showed that HA-tagged SUSD4 could be immunolabeled in non-permeabilizing conditions and located at the surface of dendrites and spines (Figure 1D). Double labeling with the postsynaptic marker GluD2 (GRID2) further showed partial colocalization at the surface of some, but not all, spines. Therefore, the timing of Susd4 mRNA expression during postnatal development and the subcellular localization of the SUSD4 protein in cerebellar PCs are in agreement with a potential role for SUSD4 in excitatory synapse formation and/or function.\n\nTo determine the synaptic function of SUSD4, we analyzed the phenotype of Susd4-/- constitutive KO mice with a deletion of exon 1 (Figure 1E and G and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). RT-PCR using primers encompassing the last exons and the 3'UTR show the complete absence of Susd4 mRNA in the brain of these Susd4 KO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). No obvious alterations of mouse development and behavior were detected in those mutants, an observation that was confirmed by assessment of their physical characteristics (weight, piloerection), basic behavioral abilities such as sensorimotor reflexes (whisker responses, eye blinking), and motor responses (open-field locomotion; see Supplementary file 1). We further assessed the behavior of Susd4 KO mice for motor coordination and motor learning (Kayakabe et al., 2014; Lalonde and Strazielle, 2001; Rondi-Reig et al., 1997). Using a footprint test, a slightly larger print separation of the front and hind paws in the Susd4 KO mice was detected, but no differences in the stride length and stance width were found (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In the accelerated rotarod assay, a classical test of motor adaptation and learning (Buitrago et al., 2004), the mice were tested three times per day at 1 hr interval during 5 consecutive days. The Susd4 KO mice performed as well as the Susd4+/+ (wild-type [WT]) littermate controls on the first trial (Figure 1F, day 1, trial 1). This indicates that there is no deficit in their balance function, despite the slight change in fine motor coordination found in the footprint test. However, while the control mice improved their performance as early as the third trial on the first day, and further improved with several days of training, no learning could be observed for the Susd4 KO mice either during the first day, or in the following days (Figure 1F). These results show that Susd4 loss-of-function leads to impaired motor coordination and learning in adult mice.\n\nBecause of the high expression of Susd4 in cerebellar PCs (Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1), we focused on this neuronal type to identify the morphological and functional consequences of Susd4 loss-of-function. No deficits in the global cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum and morphology of PCs were found in Susd4 KO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Using high-density microelectrode array (MEA), we assessed the spontaneous activity of PCs in acute cerebellar slices from Susd4 KO mice and compared to Susd4 WT mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). No differences were detected in either the mean spiking frequency, the coefficient of variation (CV) of interspike intervals (ISIs), or the intrinsic variability of spike trains (CV2, Holt and Douglas, 1996), indicating that the firing properties of PCs are not affected by Susd4 loss-of-function.\n\nCo-immunolabeling of PF presynaptic boutons using an anti-VGLUT1 antibody and of PCs using an anti-calbindin antibody in cerebellar sections from juvenile WT mice revealed an extremely dense staining in the molecular layer corresponding to the highly numerous PFs contacting PC distal dendritic spines (Figure 2A). The labeling pattern appeared to be similar in Susd4 KO. High-resolution microscopy and quantitative analysis confirmed that there are no significant changes in the mean density and volume of VGLUT1 clusters following Susd4 loss-of-function (Figure 2A). Electric stimulation of increasing intensity in the molecular layer allows the progressive recruitment of PFs (Konnerth et al., 1990) and can be used to assess the number of synapses and basic PF/PC transmission using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of PCs on acute cerebellar slices (Figure 2B). No difference was observed in the amplitude and the kinetics of the responses to PF stimulation in PCs from Susd4 KO and control littermate mice (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, the probability of vesicular release in the presynaptic PF boutons, as assessed by measurements of paired-pulse facilitation (Atluri and Regehr, 1996; Konnerth et al., 1990; Valera et al., 2012), was not changed at PF/PC synapses (Figure 2C). Finally, no differences in the frequency and amplitude of PF/PC-evoked quantal events were detected (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Thus, in accordance with the morphological analysis, Susd4 invalidation has no major effect on the number and basal transmission of PF/PC synapses in the mouse.\n\nLong-term synaptic plasticity of PF/PC synapses is involved in proper motor coordination and adaptation learning (Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017; Hirano, 2018; Kakegawa et al., 2018). We first assessed LTD in PF/PC synapses using conjunctive stimulation of PFs and CFs and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of PCs in acute cerebellar slices from juvenile mice. The LTD induction protocol produced a 42% average decrease in the amplitude of PF excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in PCs from WT mice while the paired-pulse facilitation ratio was not changed during the course of our recordings (Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In Susd4 KO PCs, the same LTD induction protocol did not induce any significant change in PF EPSCs during the 30 min recording period, showing that LTD induction and maintenance are greatly impaired in the absence of SUSD4 (Figure 2D). We then assessed LTP induction using high-frequency stimulation of PF in the absence of inhibition blockade as in Binda et al., 2016. In slices from Susd4 WT mice, tetanic stimulation every 3 s during 5 min induced only a transient increase in transmission of about 20% and the amplitude of the response returned to baseline after only 15 min (Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This result suggests that under our experimental conditions and in this particular genetic background, LTD might be favored in contrast to previously obtained results (Binda et al., 2016; Titley et al., 2019). In the case of Susd4 KO PCs, the same protocol induced LTP with a 27% increase in transmission that was maintained after 35 min (Figure 2E). These results indicate that the absence of Susd4 expression promoted LTP induction at PF/PC synapses.\n\nLack of LTD of PF/PC synapses could arise from deficient CF/PC transmission. To test this possibility, we first crossed the Susd4 KO mice with the Htr5b-GFP BAC transgenic line (http://gensat.org/MMRRC_report.jsp?founder_id=17735) expressing soluble GFP specifically in inferior olivary neurons in the olivocerebellar system to visualize CFs. We found that CFs had a normal morphology and translocated along the proximal dendrites of their PC target in Susd4 KO mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We then assessed whether developmental elimination of supernumerary CFs was affected by Susd4 invalidation using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of PCs on cerebellar acute slices (Crepel et al., 1976; Hashimoto and Kano, 2003). No difference was found in the percentage of remaining multiply-innervated PCs in the absence of Susd4 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We next used VGLUT2 immunostaining to label CF presynaptic boutons and analyze their morphology using high-resolution confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. VGLUT2 immunostaining revealed the typical CF innervation territory on PC proximal dendrites, extending up to about 80% of the molecular layer height both in control Susd4 WT and in Susd4 KO mice (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the number and density of VGLUT2 clusters were not significantly different between Susd4 WT and Susd4 KO mice. To test whether the lack of CF-dependent PF LTD was due to deficient CF transmission, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of PCs in acute cerebellar slices. Contrary to what could have been expected, the typical all-or-none CF-evoked EPSC was detected in PCs from Susd4 KO mice with increased amplitude when compared to WT PCs (Figure 3B) while no differences in CF-EPSC kinetics were found (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Analysis of the complex spikes in current-clamp mode during LTD induction did not reveal any change in the complex spike waveform, with the same mean number of spikelets in response to the repeated CF stimulation in Susd4 WT and Susd4 KO mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Therefore, the lack of CF-dependent PF/PC synapse LTD in Susd4 KO mice is not due to impaired CF/PC synapse formation or transmission. Measurements of evoked quantal events revealed an increase in the amplitude of the quantal EPSCs at CF/PC synapses from juvenile mice (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Paired-pulse facilitation and depression at PF/PC and CF/PC synapses, respectively, are similar between Susd4 KO and control mice, both in basal conditions and during plasticity recordings (Figure 2C, Figure 3B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1), suggesting strongly that the changes in PF/PC synaptic plasticity and in CF/PC transmission in Susd4 KO PCs have a postsynaptic origin. Overall our results show that Susd4 loss-of-function in mice leads to a highly specific phenotype characterized by misregulation of postsynaptic plasticity in the absence of defects in synaptogenesis and in basal transmission in cerebellar PCs.\n\nWhat are the mechanisms that allow regulation of long-term synaptic plasticity by SUSD4? The lack of LTD at PF/PC synapses and our analysis of evoked quantal events suggested the involvement of SUSD4 in the regulation of postsynaptic receptor numbers. GluA2 subunits are present in most AMPA receptor channels in PC excitatory synapses (Masugi-Tokita et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 1998). To assess whether Susd4 loss-of-function leads to misregulation of the GluA2 subunits at PC excitatory synapses, we first performed co-immunolabeling experiments using an anti-GluA2 antibody and an anti-VGLUT2 antibody on cerebellar sections followed by high-resolution microscopy. Several GluA2 clusters of varying sizes were detected in close association with each VGLUT2 presynaptic cluster corresponding to a single CF release site, while very small and dense GluA2 clusters were found in the rest of the molecular layer which mostly correspond to GluA2 clusters at the PF/PC synapses (Figure 4A). No obvious change in GluA2 distribution in the molecular layer in Susd4 KO mice was found when compared to controls, in accordance with normal basal transmission in PF/PC synapses (Figure 2C). Quantitative analysis of the GluA2 clusters associated with VGLUT2-labeled CF presynaptic boutons did not reveal a significant change in the total mean intensity of GluA2 clusters per CF presynaptic bouton (Figure 4A). However, the proportion of CF presynaptic boutons with no GluA2 cluster was smaller in juvenile Susd4 KO mice than in WT mice (Figure 4A). This decrease partially explains the increase in the amplitude of quantal EPSCs and CF transmission (Figure 3C).\n\nIn cerebellar PCs, regulation of the GluA2 subunits at synapses and of their trafficking is essential for PF LTD (Chung et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2000). To test whether activity-dependent surface localization of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors is affected by loss of Susd4, we set up a biochemical assay in which we induced chemical LTD (cLTD) in acute cerebellar slices (Kim et al., 2017) and performed surface biotinylation of GluA2 subunits followed by immunoblot quantification. In control conditions, the mean baseline levels of surface GluA2 were not significantly different between Susd4 WT and Susd4 KO mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). As expected, after cLTD a 35% mean reduction of surface GluA2 receptors was measured in slices from WT mice (Figure 4B; p=0.0212, two-tailed Student’s t test with a null hypothesis of 1). In acute slices from Susd4 KO mice, a similar, but not statistically significant, mean reduction of surface GluA2 receptors was detected after cLTD (28%; p=0.0538, two-tailed Student’s t test with a null hypothesis of 1). Thus, SUSD4 loss-of-function does not lead on average to a major change in the activity-dependent regulation of the number of surface GluA2 subunits.\n\nAnother parameter that needs to be controlled for proper LTD in PCs is the total number of AMPA receptors in the recycling pool and the targeting of AMPA receptors to late endosomes and lysosomes (Kim et al., 2017). Lack of LTD and facilitation of LTP in Susd4 KO mice (Figure 2D and E) suggest that GluA2 activity-dependent targeting to the endolysosomal compartment and its degradation is affected by Susd4 loss-of-function. Using our cLTD assay in cerebellar slices, we measured the total GluA2 levels either in control conditions or in the presence of inhibitors of the proteasome (MG132) and of lysosomal degradation (leupeptin). The comparison of the GluA2 levels in the presence of both inhibitors and in control conditions allowed us to estimate the GluA2 degraded pool, regardless of the mechanism behind this degradation. On average, total GluA2 levels were not significantly different between Susd4 WT and Susd4 KO cerebellar slices in basal conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), in accordance with our morphological and electrophysiological analysis of PF/PC synapses (Figure 2A and C). In slices from WT mice, chemical induction of LTD induced a significant reduction of 13% in total GluA2 protein levels (Figure 4C). This reduction was prevented by incubation with the mixture of degradation inhibitors, MG132 and leupeptin, showing that it corresponds to the pool of GluA2 degraded in an activity-dependent manner (Figure 4C). In slices from Susd4 KO mice, this activity-dependent degradation of GluA2 was completely absent. Additionally, the chemical induction of LTD had no effect on the total protein levels of GluD2, another synaptic receptor highly present at PF/PC postsynaptic densities, either in slices from WT or from Susd4 KO mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Thus, SUSD4 specifically controls the activity-dependent degradation of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors during LTD.\n\nFinally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using extracts from heterologous HEK293 cells transfected with SEP-tagged GluA2 and HA-tagged SUSD4 or the transmembrane protein PVRL3α as a control. After affinity purification of SEP-GluA2, HA-SUSD4 was detected in affinity-purified extracts while PVRL3α was not, showing the specific interaction of SEP-GluA2 and HA-SUSD4 in transfected HEK293 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). In order to assess the potential colocalization of SUSD4 and GluA2 in neurons, we used a Cre-dependent AAV construct to express HA-tagged SUSD4 in cultured PCs (Figure 4D) and performed immunolabeling of surface GluA2 subunits. Clusters of HA-tagged SUSD4 partially colocalize with GluA2 clusters at the surface of some dendritic spines (Figure 4D). Partial colocalization of GluA2 and SUSD4 in neurons was also confirmed in transfection experiments in hippocampal neurons (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Thus, SUSD4 could regulate activity-dependent degradation of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors through a direct interaction.\n\nTo better understand how SUSD4 regulates the number of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors at synapses, we searched for SUSD4 molecular partners by affinity purification of cerebellar synaptosome extracts using GFP-tagged SUSD4 as a bait (Figure 5A). Interacting partners were identified by proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; Savas et al., 2014). Twenty-eight candidates were identified including proteins with known function in the regulation of AMPA receptor turnover (Figure 5E). Several candidates were functionally linked to ubiquitin ligase activity by gene ontology (GO) term analysis (Figure 5A and Table 1). In particular, five members of the NEDD4 subfamily of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases were found as potential interacting partners, three of them (Nedd4l, Wwp1, and Itch) exhibiting the highest enrichment factors among the 28 candidates. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification essential for the regulation of protein turnover and trafficking in cells (Tai and Schuman, 2008). A survey of the expression of HECT-ubiquitin ligases shows that different members of the NEDD4 subfamily are broadly expressed in the mouse brain, however with only partially overlapping patterns (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, http://mouse.brain-map.org, Allen Brain Atlas). Nedd4 and Wwp1 are the most broadly expressed, including in neurons that also express Susd4, such as hippocampal neurons, inferior olivary neurons in the brainstem, and cerebellar PCs. Immunoblot analysis of affinity-purified synaptosome extracts confirmed the interaction of SUSD4 with NEDD4, ITCH, and WWP1 (Figure 5B). Removal of the intracellular domain of SUSD4 (SUSD4ΔCT mutant) prevented this interaction demonstrating the specificity of SUSD4 binding to NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases (Figure 5B).\n\nTable 1\n\nThe NEDD4 subfamily of HECT ubiquitin ligases is known to ubiquitinate and target for degradation many key signaling molecules, including GluA1- and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors (Schwarz et al., 2010; Widagdo et al., 2017). Ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family bind variants of PY motifs on target substrates and adaptors (Chen et al., 2017). However, GluA1 and GluA2 subunits lack any obvious motif of this type. In contrast, two potential PY binding sites are present in the intracellular domain of SUSD4 (Figure 5C). To test whether SUSD4 and GluA2 interaction is affected by SUSD4 binding to NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on extracts from heterologous HEK293 cells transfected with SEP-tagged GluA2 and various HA-tagged SUSD4 constructs (Figure 5C and D). In addition to several deletion constructs of SUSD4, we generated single- and double-point mutants of the two PY motifs in its intracellular tail (Figure 5C). Lack of the cytoplasmic domain completely abrogated binding of NEDD4 to SUSD4, confirming the results obtained using synaptosome extracts (Figure 5D). Deletion of the N-terminus domain of SUSD4 did not affect NEDD4 binding. Furthermore, while the mutation of the PPxY site in the intracellular tail (SUSD4-ΔPY mutant) abrogated binding of NEDD4 only partially, mutation of the LPxY site (SUSD4-ΔLY mutant) or of both sites (SUSD4-ΔPY/LY mutant) completely prevented the binding to NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases (Figure 5C and D). These mutations did not change significantly the level of HA-SUSD4 protein in transfected HEK293 cells suggesting that the degradation of SUSD4 itself is not regulated by binding of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In accordance with our results obtained using SEP-GluA2 as a bait (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), GluA2 was detected in extracts obtained by affinity purification of the HA-tagged full-length SUSD4 (HA-SUSD4), while it was absent if HA-SUSD4 was replaced by a control transmembrane protein, PVRL3α (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Deletion of the extracellular domain (HA-SUSD4ΔNT) or the cytoplasmic domain (HA-SUSD4ΔCT) did not reduce significantly the ability to interact with SEP-GluA2 when compared to HA-SUSD4 (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Strong co-immunoprecipitation of GluA2 was detected in anti-HA affinity-purified extracts from cells expressing the HA-tagged extracellular domain of SUSD4 alone (HA-SUSD4-NT construct), showing that this domain is sufficient for GluA2 interaction (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Finally using the SUSD4-ΔLY mutant or SUSD4-ΔPY/LY mutant as a bait did not significantly modify the levels of co-immunoprecipitated GluA2 compared to HA-SUSD4, showing that binding of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases does not affect SUSD4’s ability to interact with GluA2.\n\nThe degradation of specific targets such as neurotransmitter receptors must be regulated in a stimulus-dependent and synapse-specific manner in neurons, to ensure proper long-term synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Tai and Schuman, 2008). How is this level of specificity achieved? Adaptor proteins, such as GRASP1, GRIP1, PICK1, and NSF, are known to promote AMPA receptor recycling and LTP (Anggono and Huganir, 2012). Such adaptors for the promotion of LTD remain to be found.\n\nOur results show that SUSD4 directly binds to HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family. The family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases contains 28 enzymes including the NEDD4 subfamily that is characterized by an N-terminal C2 domain, several WW domains, and the catalytic HECT domain (Weber et al., 2019). This subgroup of E3 ligases adds K63 ubiquitin chains to their substrate, a modification that promotes sorting to the endolysosomal compartment for degradation (Boase and Kumar, 2015). NEDD4 E3 ligases are highly expressed in neurons in the mammalian brain and have many known substrates with various functions, including ion channels and the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit. Accordingly, KO mice for the Nedd4-1 gene die during late gestation (Kawabe et al., 2010). The activity and substrate selectivity of NEDD4 E3 ligases thus need to be finely tuned. Both GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits are ubiquitinated on lysine residues in their intracellular tails in an activity-dependent manner (Lin et al., 2011; Lussier et al., 2011; Schwarz et al., 2010; Widagdo et al., 2015). Mutation of these lysine residues decreases localization of GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits in the endolysosomal compartment in neurons (Widagdo et al., 2015). However, GluA1 and GluA2 subunits lack any obvious intracellular direct binding motif to the WW domain of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases, raising questions about the precise mechanism allowing regulation of AMPA subunits trafficking and degradation by these enzymes. We showed that SUSD4 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits interact in cells and partially colocalize in neurons. SUSD4 could thus regulate the targeting of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases to AMPA receptors in an activity-dependent manner in neurons. Alternatively, the interaction of SUSD4 with NEDD4 ubiquitin ligases might regulate the trafficking of the SUSD4/GluA2 complex to the degradation pathway. Furthermore, among the potential partners of SUSD4 identified by our proteomics analysis, several other candidates have functions that are relevant for the regulation of synaptic plasticity, such as receptor anchoring, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and proteasome function (Figure 5E). Further work is needed to determine the precise mechanism of action of SUSD4 in neurons in the context of synaptic plasticity.\n\nSusd4 loss-of-function leads to motor impairments, a symptom that is also found in ASD patients (Fournier et al., 2010). Deficits in LTD such as the one found in the Susd4 KO mice are a common feature of several mouse models of ASDs (Auerbach et al., 2011; Baudouin et al., 2012; Piochon et al., 2014). Because of the broad expression of SUSD4 and of ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 subfamily in the mammalian central nervous system, whether motor impairments in the Susd4 KO mice are directly the results of synaptic deficits in cerebellar PCs remain to be demonstrated. Very recently, a reduction in exploratory behavior, in addition to impairments of motor coordination, was reported after Susd4 loss-of-function (Zhu et al., 2020). Thus, mutations in the Susd4 gene might contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders by impairing synaptic plasticity at many synapse types.\n\nIn humans, the 1q41-42 deletion syndrome is characterized by many symptoms including IDs and seizures, and in a high majority of the cases, the microdeletion encompasses the SUSD4 gene (Rosenfeld et al., 2011). A SUSD4 copy number variation has been identified in a patient with ASD (Cuscó et al., 2009). SUSD4 was recently identified among the 124 genes with genome-wide significance for de novo mutations in a cohort of more than 10,000 patients with ASD or IDs (Coe et al., 2019). The GRIA2 gene (coding for the GluA2 subunit) has been found as an ASD susceptibility gene (Salpietro et al., 2019; Satterstrom et al., 2020), and mutations or misregulation of ubiquitin ligases have been found in many models of ASDs or IDs (Cheon et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Satterstrom et al., 2020). For example, ubiquitination of GluA1 by NEDD4-2 is impaired in neurons from a model of Fragile X syndrome (Lee et al., 2018). Understanding the molecular mechanism linking activity-dependent degradation of GluA2 and the SUSD4/NEDD4 complex will thus be of particular importance for our understanding of the etiology of these neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nResponses to PF and CF stimulation were recorded in PCs of the lobule VI in acute parasagittal and horizontal (LTP experiments) cerebellar slices from Susd4 KO juvenile (from P25 to P35) or adult (~P60) mice. Susd4 WT littermates were used as controls. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane 4% and sacrificed by decapitation. The cerebellum was dissected in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) bicarbonate buffered solution (BBS) containing (in mM): NaCl 120, KCl 3, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, and D(+)-glucose 35. Three-hundred-micrometer-thick cerebellar slices were cut with a vibratome (Microm HM650V: Thermo Scientific Microm, MA, or 7000smz-2 Campden Instruments Ltd., UK) in slicing solution (in mM): N-methyl-D-glucamine 93, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 30, HEPES 20, D(+)-glucose 25, MgCl2 10, sodium ascorbate 5, thiourea 2, sodium pyruvate 3, N-acetyl-cystein 1, kynurenic acid 1, and CaCl2 0.5 (pH 7.3). Immediately after cutting, slices were allowed to briefly recover at 37°C in the oxygenated sucrose-based buffer (in mM): sucrose 230, KCl 2.5, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, D(+)-glucose 25, CaCl2 0.8, and MgCl2 8. D-APV and minocycline at a final concentration of 50 μM and 50 nM, respectively, were added to the sucrose-based buffer. Slices were allowed to fully recover in bubbled BBS with 50 mM minocycline at 37°C for at least 40 min before starting the experiment, then maintained at room temperature for a maximum time of 8 hr (from slicing time). Patch-clamp borosilicate glass pipettes with 3–6 MΩ resistance were filled with the following internal solutions:\n\nCesium metanesulfonate solution (CsMe solution, for EPSC elicited from CF and PF), containing (in mM): CsMeSO3 135, NaCl 6, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, MgATP 4, Na2GTP 0.4, EGTA 1.5, QX314Cl 5, TEA 5, and biocytin 2.6 (pH 7.3).\n\nCsMe S-solution (for delayed EPSC quanta events), containing (in mM): CsMeSO3 140, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 10, MgATP 4, Na2GTP 0.5, BAPTA 10, and neurobiotin 1% (pH 7.35).\n\nPotassium gluconate solution (KGlu solution, for PF long-term plasticity), containing (in mM): K gluconate 136, KCl 10, HEPES 10, MgCl2 1, sucrose 16, MgATP 4, and Na2GTP 0.4 (pH 7.35).\n\nStimulation electrodes with ~5 MΩ resistances were pulled from borosilicate glass pipettes and filled with BBS. Recordings were performed at room temperature on slices continuously perfused with oxygenated BBS. The experiment started at least 20 min after the whole-cell configuration was established. The Digitimer DS3 (Digitimer Ltd) stimulator was used to elicit CF and PF and neuronal connectivity responses in PCs. Patch-clamp experiments were conducted in voltage clamp mode (except for the LTP and LTD induction protocols that were made under current-clamp mode) using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA) and acquired using the freeware WinWCP written by John Dempster (https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/datasets/strathclyde-electrophysiology-software-winwcp-winedr). Series resistance was compensated by 60–100% and cells were discarded if significant changes were detected. Currents were low-pass filtered at 2.2 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz.\n\nCF- and PF-EPSC experiments\n\nRequest a detailed protocol\n\nTo isolate the AMPARs current, the BBS was supplemented with (in mM): picrotoxin 0.1, D-AP5 10, CGP52432 0.001, JNJ16259685 0.002, DPCPX 0.0005, and AM251 0.001. CF and PF EPSCs were monitored at a holding potential of −10 mV. During CF recordings, the stimulation electrode was placed in the granule cell layer below the clamped cell; CF-mediated responses were identified by the typical all-or-none response and strong depression displayed by the second response elicited during paired-pulse stimulations (20 Hz). The number of CFs innervating the recorded PC was estimated from the number of discrete CF-EPSC steps. PF stimulation was achieved by placing the stimulation electrode in the molecular layer at the minimum distance required to avoid direct stimulation of the dendritic tree of the recorded PC. The input-output curve was obtained by incrementally increasing the stimulation strength. Peak EPSC values for PF were obtained following averaging of three consecutive recordings, values for CF EPSC correspond to the first recording. Short-term plasticity experiments were analyzed using a software written in Python by Antoine Valera (http://synaptiqs.wixsite.com/synaptiqs).\n\nPF long-term plasticity experiments\n\nRequest a detailed protocol\n\nPCs were clamped at −60 mV. Each PF-induced response was monitored by a test protocol of paired stimulation pulses (20 Hz) applied every 20 s. A baseline was established during 10 min of paired-pulse stimulation in the voltage clamp configuration. After that, an induction protocol was applied in current-clamp mode with cells held at −60 mV. During LTD induction, the PFs were stimulated with two pulses at high frequency (200 Hz) and, after 100 ms, the CF was stimulated with four pulses at high frequency (200 Hz) repeated every 2 s for a period of 10 min. During LTP induction, recordings were made using BBS not supplemented with picrotoxin, and the PFs were stimulated with bursts of 15 pulses at high frequency (100 Hz) repeated every 3 s for a period of 5 min (Binda et al., 2016). Then, PCs were switched to the voltage clamp mode and paired stimulation pulses applied again, lasting 40 min. All the data were normalized to the mean baseline. Long-term plasticity was analyzed with the software Igor Pro 6.05 (WaveMetrics INC, OR).\n\nPF- and CF-delayed EPSC quanta events were detected and analyzed using the software Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices). PF- and CF-delayed EPSC quanta superposed events were discarded manually based on the waveform. A threshold of 10 pA for minimal amplitude was used to select the CF events; 100 (PF) and 300 (CF) events for each neuron were studied by analyzing consecutive traces.\n\nHEK293H (Gibco, MA, Cat#11631–017) were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; containing high glucose and glutamax, Life Technologies, Cat#31966047) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Cat#16141–079) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Cat#15140122). 106 cells were plated per well in a six-well plate and transfected 24 hr (h) after plating with the indicated plasmids (1 µg plasmid DNA per well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Cat#11668–019) according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nForty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed and proteins were solubilized for 1 hr at 4°C under gentle rotation in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100 [Tx; Sigma, Cat#x100], 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100; Sigma, Cat#P8340) and MG132 (100 µM; Sigma, Cat#C2211). Lysates were sonicated for 10 s, further solubilized for 1 hr at 4°C and clarified by centrifugation at 6000 r.p.m. during 8 min (min). Supernatants were collected, incubated with 5 µg of rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (for details, see 'Antibodies' section), together with 60 µL of protein G-sepharose beads (Sigma; Cat#10003D) for 3 hr at 4°C, to coat the beads with the HA-tagged SUSD4 proteins. When SUSD4-GFP was expressed for affinity pull downs, GFP-Trap was done according to the instructions of GFP-Trap_A (Chromotek, NY, Cat#ABIN509397). Coated beads were washed three times with 1 mL lysis buffer.\n\nTo prepare synaptosome fractions, cerebella from WT mice (P30) were homogenized at 4°C in 10 volumes (w/v) of 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 M sucrose and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Synaptosomal fractions were purified by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 r.p.m. (SW41Ti rotor) at 4°C using Percoll-sucrose density gradients (2-6-10–20%; v/v). Each fraction from the 10–20% interface was collected and washed in 10 mL of a 5 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4 (NaOH) containing 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM D(+)-glucose by centrifugation. The suspension was immediately centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 min. Synaptosomes in the pellet were resuspended in 100 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Tx) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100) and MG132 (100 µM). Lysates were sonicated for 10 s and further incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. HA-SUSD4, GFP-SUSD4, or its control GFP-coated beads were then incubated with the synaptosomal lysates for 3 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS. Bound proteins were eluted for 10 min at 75°C using Laemmli buffer (160 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.008% BBP) with 5% β-mercaptoethanol before SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting or mass spectrometry.\n\nThree-hundred-micrometer-thick parasagittal cerebellar slices were obtained from P31-P69 WT and Susd4 KO mice following the same protocol described before (see 'Whole-cell patch-clamp on acute cerebellar slices' section). Slices were incubated for 2 hr at 37°C in oxygenated BBS with or without proteasome (50 µM MG132 in DMSO) and lysosomal (100 µg/mL leupeptine in water, Sigma, Cat#11034626001) inhibitors. cLTD was induced by incubating the slices for 5 min at 37°C in BBS containing 50 mM K+ and 10 μM glutamate (diluted in HCl), followed by a recovery period in BBS for 30 min at 37°C all under oxygenation, in presence or not of inhibitors. Control slices were incubated in parallel in BBS solution containing HCl. Slices were then homogenized in lysis buffer, containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% Na azide, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100). Homogenates were incubated 45 min at 4°C, then sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were then heated at 65°C in 2× sample buffer (Sigma, Cat#S3401) prior to western blot analysis for detection of GluA2 and GluD2.\n\nFor GluA2 surface biotinylation assay, cerebellar slices (obtained from mice aged between P27 and P61) were treated as above. After a recovery period of 30 min at 37°C in BBS, slices were incubated in a biotinylation solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, Cat#A39258, 0.125 mg/mL) for 30 min on ice without oxygen. Slices were finally washed three times for 10 min in PBS pH 7.4 at 4°C and then homogenized in lysis buffer, containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% Na azide, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100). Homogenates were incubated 45 min at 4°C, then sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants (inputs) were collected and incubated with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#65001) under gentle rotation overnight at 4°C. Using a magnet, beads were washed five times in lysis buffer and biotinylated proteins were then eluted by boiling for 15 min at 65°C in 1× sample buffer before SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis for detection of GluA2."
