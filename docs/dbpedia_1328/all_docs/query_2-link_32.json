        "text": "Introduction\n\nCellular resolution imaging using miniaturized fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) permits the monitoring of the topology of activity in brain circuits during unrestrained behaviors. While advances in electrophysiology now enable recordings from many thousands of neurons at once in awake animals (Juavinett, Bekheet, and Churchland 2018; Jun et al. 2017), imaging approaches can sample the activity of individual neurons and retain information about how their activity is spatially distributed in a large network (Terada et al. 2018; Stirman et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2016). Often an anatomical substrate exists for clustered activity such as is the case in the cerebellum, where nearby Purkinje cells receive input from climbing fibers originating in adjacent neurons of the inferior olive brainstem nucleus (Ruigrok 2010). Thus, imaging approaches can reveal how individual cells embedded in a larger network display coordinated activity during different stages of behavior or training (Wagner et al. 2017; Heffley et al. 2018; Galiñanes, Bonardi, and Huber 2018; Giovannucci et al. 2017). Moreover, because of their ability to record in freely moving animals, miniscopes have been instrumental in uncovering neural activity patterns occurring during natural behaviors and related brain-states including social interactions (Murugan et al. 2017; Remedios et al. 2017; Liang et al. 2018; Kingsbury et al. 2019) or sleep (Chen et al. 2018; Cox, Pinto, and Dan 2016) with fully intact vestibular input.\n\nOpen-source miniscopes have provided affordable tools to probe cellular activity in rodents (Ghosh et al. 2011; Cai et al. 2016) and birds (Liberti et al. 2016, 2017) during unrestrained behavior and have so far allowed recordings from a single region. However, in order to understand how brain circuits elicit behavior, it would be preferable to probe multi-region interactions during either spontaneous or trained behaviors. If miniscopes are used to this end, they should be sufficiently light and compact to allow recordings from more than one site without compromising image quality, permit straight-forward behavioral tracking and have the ability to drive circuits optogenetically. To address these needs we have developed a versatile and compact miniaturized fluorescence microscope (NINscope) with a sensitive CMOS sensor, integrated inertial measurement unit and an accurate LED driver for optogenetic actuation using custom-made LED probes.\n\nLeveraging the capabilities of our miniscope, we demonstrate functional interactions between the cerebellum and cortex in unrestrained mice wearing dual miniscopes. Complex spike activity in Purkinje cell dendrites correlated with cellular activity measured in the cortex during periods of movement, in line with previous anatomical and functional studies of cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity (Badura et al. 2018; Bostan, Dum, and Strick 2013; Akkal, Dum, and Strick 2007; Hoover and Strick 1999; Gao et al. 2018; Wagner et al. 2019). Moreover, activity correlated across regions typically preceded behavioral acceleration. Using the NINscope’s built-in optogenetic stimulation capabilities in conjunction with accelerometer read-out we show that activation of the cerebellar hemispheres or vermis elicits lateralized behavioral responses and activation of cortical neurons reiterating cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate the applicability of NINscope to image from neurons in the mouse dorsal striatum, a region accessible only after implantation of a relay GRIN lens. Using NINscope’s accelerometer and behavioral analysis of video data, we identify cells in the striatum whose activity is exclusively modulated when mice make turns contralateral to the recording site, highlighting the role of striatal neurons in encoding action space (Klaus et al. 2017). Concurrent optogenetic stimulation of prefrontal or secondary motor cortex and imaging in dorsal striatum further reveals that inputs from both cortical areas can modulate the activity of neurons in the dorsal striatum (albeit with differing efficacy).\n\nAltogether NINscope permits new types of recordings in unrestrained mice. We demonstrate the feasibility to record from two regions in the same mouse concurrently, to use a built-in LED driver in combination with an implantable LED probe for optogenetic stimulation, and to parse behavioral states by the inclusion of an accelerometer. NINscope is an open-source project enabling others to build on its design and functionalities, thereby contributing to a growing range of open-source tools to study neural circuits during unrestrained behavior.\n\nResults\n\nNINscope design and functionality\n\nNINscope (Figure 1A-C) follows the same general design as other open-source miniscopes, with a few space and weight saving modifications. A thinner optical emission filter and dichroic mirror (both 500 µm) were used and the emission filter (1 mm) was glued to a plano-convex lens using optical bonding glue (NOA81, Norland Products). New high-density interconnector (HDI) sensor and interface PCBs (10 by 10 mm, Figure 1D) were designed, fitted with electronic components using a pick-and-place machine (NeoDen4, NeoDen Tech, Hangzhou, China), and stacked to maintain a small footprint, which allows for inclusion of an inertial measurement unit and multiple LED drivers including one for optogenetic actuation and two for driving excitation LEDs. The latter feature allows for the extension from single to dual excitation mode.\n\nThe PYTHON480 sensor (ON Semiconductor) was chosen as a compact yet sensitive CMOS sensor (pixel size: 4.8 µm, dynamic range > 59 dB) with modest power requirements. NINscope uses a 1.8 mm diameter GRIN lens (numerical aperture 0.55, #64-519, Edmund Optics) as objective and has a magnification of ∼4.6x. This gave us approximate field sizes of 786 by 502 μm, using a 752 × 480 pixels Region Of Interest (ROI). In software we implemented the option to translate this ROI to cover the CMOS sensor area of 800 × 600 pixels (836 by 627 μm).\n\nBecause of the widespread use of the first generation UCLA Miniscope we retained the data acquisition (DAQ V3.2) module of the UCLA Miniscope project with minor modifications that included an EEPROM to store a larger modified version of the latest Cypress EZ-USB FX3 firmware and a wired connection from general purpose input/output 2 (GPIO2) to test point 4 (TP4), allowing 1 ms timing accuracy for the optogenetic LED driver (Figure 1E). The firmware of the DAQ module was modified to allow serial control over optogenetic and excitation LED brightness, as well as gain, exposure and black level of the CMOS sensor.\n\nThe microscope housing was 3D printed (EnvisionTec Micro Plus Advantage printer, RCP30 M resin and Formlabs Form 2 printer, RS-F2-GPBK-04 black resin) to allow for initial rapid prototyping of various miniscope designs. Printing accuracy proved sufficient for our final design enabling us to keep the weight of the miniscope down to 1.6 grams (housing + optics), while permitting the use of two miniscopes simultaneously on one mouse. The top half of NINscope has an enclosure for the sensor and interface PCBs to protect them from damage during unrestrained animal behavior. NINscope is secured onto a small-footprint baseplate (6.5 by 7.5 mm, Supplemental Figure 1) with a set-screw. The lower half of the NINscope housing has a protrusion that fits in a notch in the baseplate for increased stability.\n\nA user interface was written in the Processing language (http://processing.org) allowing cross-platform interoperability and control of experimental recordings. The option was included to record both in single or dual head (two miniscope) mode in combination with an additional USB webcam for video capture of behavior. We used ring buffers in the software to avoid frame time delays and frame drops during acquisitions. Timestamps for acquired frames are logged for post-hoc synchronization. The accelerometer data from the IMU can be visualized live during the miniscope recordings. In addition, optogenetic stimulus patterns and LED probe current can be adjusted through the interface providing integrated control of all aspects of the experiment (Supplemental Figure 2). A more detailed description of the hardware and software is provided in the Materials and Methods section. Design files and instructions on hardware assembly, firmware programming and software installation can be found at our GitHub site: https://github.com/ninscope.\n\nIn order to validate our miniscope, we tested it under various recording and stimulation configurations including single and dual scope modes across different brain regions. Behavior of animals was monitored with a USB webcam (Figure 2A), the miniscope tracking LED (Figure 2B), and an onboard accelerometer. In the example shown, Purkinje cells in lobule V of the cerebellum (AP: −6.4, ML: 0 mm) were transduced with GCaMP6f, and their dendrites were imaged and segmented using the CNMF_E algorithm (Zhou et al. 2018) (Figure 2 C,D). Minimal light power (∼120-240 μW before, 30-140 μW after entering the GRIN objective, well within the linear range of the excitation LED driver, Supplemental Figure 3) was required to obtain high quality signal-to-noise recordings using a GRIN objective mounted on the brain surface (Figure 2E, Movie 1) and no signal bleaching or photodamage was observed after our imaging sessions (typically 5.000-20.000 frames, i.e., 2-11 minutes per session repeated with brief intermissions at least 10 times). The x, y and z accelerometer channels were used to detect movement onsets (Figure 2F) and discern specific behaviors such as rearing (Figure 2G), eating and grooming.\n\nCellular resolution imaging of cerebello-cerebral interactions in unrestrained mice\n\nFor us, an important motivation for building a lighter and smaller miniscope was the ability to record from two regions concurrently in unrestrained mice and in particular to obtain cellular resolution recordings of cerebellum and cerebral cortex. There is ample anatomical evidence for cerebello-thalamo-cerebral loops (Hoover and Strick 1999; Akkal, Dum, and Strick 2007; Bostan, Dum, and Strick 2013) and an increasing number of studies suggest that functional interactions within such loops are important for the proper expression of social, cognitive and motor (planning) behaviors (Badura et al. 2018; Stoodley et al. 2017; Gao et al. 2018). The ability to record from both cerebellum and cortex simultaneously in unrestrained mice opens up the possibility to study how these interactions play out during natural spontaneous behaviors.\n\nGiven the reduced footprint and weight (1.6 g) we were able to mount two NINscopes on a single mouse. Under these conditions mice displayed typical cage exploration, grooming, eating and rearing as seen in mice with one miniscope (Figure 3A). Our design allows recordings from two regions in mice with a minimum inter-baseplate distance of 8.15 mm and miniscopes placed at an angle of 15° with respect to each other (Figure 3B). Given these constraints concurrent recordings from frontal aspects of cortex (encompassing premotor cortex (M1), secondary motor cortex (M2) and prefrontal cortex) and cerebellum, but also from cerebellum and rostral striatum become possible. Thus, with NINscope one can record from multiple sets of different areas involved in the planning, initiation and control of movement.\n\nFor our dual site recordings virus injections were performed to selectively transduce GCaMP6f in cerebellar Purkinje cells of cerebellar simplex lobule (GRIN objective center AP:-5.8, ML:2.2 mm), or lobule VI (GRIN objective center AP:-7.4, ML:0.0 mm) and globally in neurons of motor cortex (GRIN objective center AP: +1.4, ML: 1.5) covering large parts of the caudal forelimb area and a small part of M2 at the rostral border of the GRIN objective lens (Figure 3C).\n\nWe were able to extract signals from hundreds of cells in both areas (cerebellum: 141±53, range 62-200, cortex: 201±90, range 89-361, mean± SD, n=4 mice, Figure 3D). Calcium transients from Purkinje cell dendrites expressing GCaMP6f displayed faster decay kinetics than cells in cortex expressing the same calcium sensor protein (t1/2 cerebellum: 0.217±0.12s, 15784 transients, t1/2 cortex: 0.488±0.34s, 9424 transients, mean±SD, Hedge’s G = 1.19, Figure 3D, E), likely reflecting differences in endogenous calcium buffering (Celio 1990; Baimbridge, Celio, and Rogers 1992). Event rates measured from Purkinje cell dendrites corresponded to the underlying rate of climbing fiber input (0.62±0.39 Hz, mean±SD, 1629 cells, n=4 mice), while cortical neurons fired events at a lower rate (0.22±0.28 Hz, mean±SD, 2212 cells, n=4 mice).\n\nIn all recordings we observed distinct periods of increased activity across regions (Movie 2) around periods of animal movement (Figure 3E) as gauged from the compound acceleration signal and inspection of the raw data. To quantify correlations across cerebellum (lobule VI, simplex lobule each 2 animals) and cortex, transient event times were concolved with an Epanechnikov kernel and summed over all cells, resulting in a kernel sum, where global synchronous patterns (SPs) were defined as instances where the kernel sum exceeded mean+2σ (cyan lines in Figure 3E). A visualization of the functional connectivity of cells is shown in the arcplot of Figure 3F, where node size scales with the number of connected cells and SPs within cerebellum (lobule VI in this example), cortex and across the two regions are shown. Both cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons displayed SPs within and across regions with Purkinje cells having significantly more within-SPs than cortical neurons (fraction of total lobule VI: 66.4±18.9%, simplex lobule: 73.3±27.4%, cortex: 35.7±17%, mean±SD, CBL vs CTX p = 2.7801e-17, KS test). Significantly more Purkinje cells than cortical neurons participated in across-SPs (fraction of total lobule VI: 42.3±29.6%, fraction simplex lobule: 47.4±31.6%, cortex: 26.7±18.5%, mean±SD, CBL vs CTX p = 1.8409e-15, KS test).\n\nWe next looked into whether correlated activity in cerebellum and cortex were associated with behavioral acceleration. To determine if it preceded or followed across-region-SPs, the compound acceleration signal was triggered off of across-SPs. We could assign behavioral acceleration to four categories (Figure 3G), consisting of no significant change (64%, 206/321 across-SPs), behavioral acceleration post-SP (31%, 99/321), pre-SP (4%, 13/321) or around-SP (1%, 3/321). Thus the majority (86%, 99/115) of SPs associated with significant acceleration events followed the across-SP. We further confirmed that SPs are associated with acceleration events by comparing the fraction of randomly triggered versus SP-triggered acceleration exceeding mean+2σ of baseline to show that the fraction of SP-triggered acceleration events could not have arisen by chance (random vs SP-triggered, p=0.0017, KS test).\n\nAs expected, calcium transients in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons occurred around behavioral acceleration (Figure 3H,I). In the example shown (triggered off an across-SP indicated by the cyan triangles in Figure 3E and 3H) a large deflection occurred in the compound accelerometer signal around an SP onset. This movement was also seen when inspecting the concurrent webcam image frames and visualized here by optic flow, with colors representing direction of movement before (top) and around the SP onset (bottom).\n\nAligning recordings (n=4 animals, 9 recordings) to post-SP onsets revealed a clear upslope of the accelerometer signal coinciding with calcium increases in both cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons (Figure 3I). Although calcium imaging does not provide very accurate latency estimates we did examine the relative timing of the calcium responses in cerebellum and cortex relative to movement acceleration. Latencies to peak response of the calcium transients in cerebellum, cortex and the compound acceleration signal revealed that the maximum acceleration came after the peak response in both cerebellum and cortex (CBL: 444±280 ms, CTX: 505±260 ms, axyz: 700±269 ms, Kruskal-Wallis test p=1.6553e-08). A post-hoc test using Sheffe’s S revealed that the mean ranks for the calcium transient peak latencies were both significantly different relative to the delayed peak latency of the accelerometer signal, while this did not apply when comparing the mean ranks of cerebellar and cortical calcium transients. Thus, based on our preliminary data recorded with NINscope we show that coordinated cerebello-cerebral activity generally precedes acceleration of a movement.\n\nIn some recordings we observed spatial clustering of activity in cerebellum and/or cortex during across-SPs (Figure 3J). To quantify spatial clustering of cells participating in an across-SP the spatial autocorrelation measure Moran’s I was calculated where a value of 0 represents random and 1 homogeneous clustering. A large range of Moran’s I values was found (cerebellum: 0.40±0.28, range = 0.005-0.76, cortex: 0.45± 0.34 range = 0-0.97), some with a high Moran’s I indicative of significant spatial clustering. There was no clear trend where either cerebellum or cortex displayed more clustered cells during across-SPs (Figure 3K). Future studies parsing more specific motor behaviors during defined behavioral states in conjunction with a larger sample size should provide a clearer picture of spatial clustering of cerebellar and cerebral cortical activity during behaviorally relevant SPs.\n\nCerebral cortical responses during multi-site cerebellar stimulation\n\nSo far, miniscope optogenetics has focused on stimulating within the same field-of-view (Stamatakis et al. 2018). Stimulating within the same field-of-view sets constraints on the miniscope design necessitating additional optics, which adds weight and increases the footprint of a miniscope. It also requires the use of an opsin that can be spectrally separated from the activity indicator. Moreover, it is often desirable to stimulate at a site distal to the miniscope, for example to activate indirect projection pathways. By directly driving the LED from the miniscope the amount of cabling can be reduced, while stimulus onsets can be directly logged to disk together with the image frames and accelerometer data to ease post-hoc analysis. Using the integrated LED driver of NINscope we demonstrate its use by stimulating cerebellar Purkinje cells in transgenic Pcp2-Cre Jdhu × Ai32(RCL-ChR2(H134R)/EYFP) mice while performing calcium imaging from neurons in motor cortex transduced with GCaMP6f (Figure 4A, GRIN objective center AP: +1.4, ML: 1.5). We chose 4 cerebellar locations to implant the blue LEDs (470 nm): Crus II ipsi- and contralateral to the imaging site on the right hemisphere, contralateral simplex lobule and lobule VI in medial cerebellar vermis (Figure 4B). LED probes consisted of the implanted LED itself, a wire and a connector with pins (Figure 4C) that allowed switching the miniscope LED driver connection from one implant site to the next (Figure 4D).\n\nStimulation of each of the cerebellar sites implanted with LEDs (50 ms, 22 mA current, 2.3 mW light power) evoked responses in motor cortex of the right hemisphere (Figure 4E-G, Movie 3). Recurring cerebellar stimulation (0.3 Hz, 4-5 times) could induce ramp-like activity as seen when averaging responses across cells in motor cortex (Figure 4E). The miniscope accelerometer data registered movement that occurred with a delay after stimulus offset (crus II ipsi: 76±23ms; crus II contra: 80±30 ms; lobule VI: 79±34 ms; simplex lobule: 73±32 ms, mean±SD, n=2 mice) in line with earlier observations that disinhibition of Purkinje cells and associated rebound excitation of neurons in the cerebellar nuclei can elicit delayed motor reflexes (Hoebeek et al. 2010; Witter et al. 2013). A significant number of cells met the criterion of displaying calcium increased exceeding mean+2σ of the pre-stimulus baseline and were labeled as responders (Figure 4F). Across all recordings and sites of stimulation the number of responders was roughly half of all segmented cells in motor cortex (49.9±14.2%, mean±sd, 2227/4614 cells, n=2 mice). Mean amplitudes of Z-scored calcium transients measured in neurons of motor cortex varied depending on the region stimulated (crus II ipsi: 2.1±1.3 Z; crus II contra: 2.9±1.5 Z; lobule VI: 2.9±1.6 Z; simplex lobule: 2.0±1.3 Z; Kruskal-Wallis test p = 1.1239e-70 and post-hoc multiple comparisons using Sheffe’s S revealed significantly different mean ranks for stimulation of contralateral lobule VI and crus II relative to the other groups) (Figure 4G), but all displayed comparable onset times (crus II ipsi: 218±120 ms; crus II contra: 221±118 ms; lobule VI: 233±123 ms; simplex lobule: 212±130 ms, mean±sd; Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.1, n.s) relative to stimulus offset. Transient onset times had non normal distributions as assessed with an Anderson-Darling test (A-D test statistic: 5.76, range: 16-577 ms relative to stimulus offset) suggesting that a subpopulation of cortical cells could be responsive during the execution of the optogenetically triggered motor reflexes. On average, however, cerebellar Purkinje cell stimulation caused slow rising cortical responses that could not have directly contributed to movement, but could prime motor cortex for upcoming movements. The most dense projections out of cerebellum cross and one would therefore expect strongest activation of the contralateral cortex. A stronger peak amplitude was seen with contralateral cerebellar stimulation, but a significant response was also evoked with ipsilateral cerebellar stimulation. One possible explanation could be the presence of strong commissural projections between the hemispheres (Chovsepian et al. 2017). The comparatively slow sampling associated with calcium imaging may have masked any inter-hemispheric delays. A caveat of these validation experiments might be that we did not stimulate focally by directing light through small diameter optical fibers; yet even with our coarse stimulation clear lateralization of behavioral responses was observed. Stimulation of Purkinje cells over both cerebellar hemispheres evoked opposing head movements as determined from our accelerometer data with leftward movements when stimulating over left and rightward movements when stimulating over right crus II (Figure 4G). Crus I and II in rodents are essential for sensorimotor integration in relation to orofacial and whisking behavior (Ju et al. 2019; Romano et al. 2018), but head and neck information provides input to these two areas as well via the external cuneate nucleus (Quy et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2013) and in humans, head movements co-occur with activation of the cerebellar hemispheres (Prudente et al. 2015). Lateral stimulation of left simplex lobule evoked more modest lateral movements as compared to crus II stimulation, while they were mostly absent when stimulating over medial vermis lobule VI where forward/backward movements were relatively more pronounced. Overall, responses of cerebral cortical neurons were robust irrespective of the stimulated cerebellar region, revealing strong functional cerebello-cerebral connectivity. The behavioral reflexes registered with the accelerometer upon Purkinje cell stimulation did not appear directly correlated with cerebral cortical activation, suggesting a more likely scenario of downstream targets in the brainstem underlying these reflexes.\n\nAction encoding in dorsal striatum\n\nThe striatum is a subcortical structure that is inaccessible to miniscope imaging without lowering a GRIN relay lens into the site of interest (Figure 5A). Due to tissue damage along the lens track, longer recovery times are required before imaging can commence (Bocarsly et al. 2015). A significant amount of light is also lost through a combination of two GRIN lenses along the optical path, thereby rendering these experiments more challenging than imaging from cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites or superficial layers of cerebral cortex. In order to validate NINscope to study the striatum in unrestrained animals and prove its effectiveness for deep imaging, we revisited previous work that has proposed a role of the dorsal striatum (DS) in contraversive movement initiation and action encoding independent of movement (Klaus et al. 2017; Cui et al. 2013).\n\nUsing a viral vector with the human synapsin promoter, we transduced all striatal neurons with GCaMP6 in a caudal, dorsal part of the striatum of the right hemisphere (Figure 5B). Directly following viral transduction, a 600 µm diameter GRIN relay lens (Inscopix, CA) was implanted. Animals were baseplated after lowering a NINscope with mounted GRIN objective and baseplate to just above the GRIN relay lens to bring cells into focus. In DS we extracted signals from up to 84 cells (62±16.70, mean±sd, range 38-84; Figure 5C), which, based on their calcium transients, typically had a rate of around 1 Hz (1.106±0.93 Hz, mean±sd, 308 cells, n=5). Despite using relatively low light power (∼300 µW after the objective and before the GRIN relay lens), we obtained good signal-to-noise recordings (Figure 5D). Using the tracking NINscope tracking LED together with the accelerometer data, we found epochs where mice made both body and head turns (Figure 5E, Movie 4). Such turns were associated with up- or downward deflections in the x channel of our accelerometer reflecting left, or right-turning movements, respectively (Figure 5F). During left turns (contralateral), a majority of neurons in the right DS (82%, 308 cells, n=5) displayed significantly elevated responses (Figure 5G, H). The largest of these began after movement initiation, suggesting a predominant association with action execution rather than preparation (latency onset, 0.31±0.45 s, mean±sd). None of the cells we recorded from responded to forward-backward movements or movements ipsilateral to the site of recording (Figure 5G, H), confirming lateralization of movement signals in the striatum. When signals were averaged one second pre- and post-movement initiation (Figure 5I, J), repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect (F(1.18, 4.7)=16.48, p=0.01) of movement initiation. Post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons demonstrated that the effect occurred exclusively during epochs of contralateral (t=9.45, df=4, p=0.001), but not ipsilateral movement initiation (t=3.07, df=4, NS).\n\nTop-down control of dorsal striatum\n\nTo reveal the impact of cortical inputs on neuronal activity in DS of unrestrained animals, we optogenetically stimulated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) or secondary motor cortex (M2) during DS imaging, taking advantage of the capability of our miniscope to directly trigger an LED. The opsin ChrimsonR was transduced in either of the two cortical regions and a 625 nm LED implanted above the cortex (Figure 6A). In reduced preparations, OFC and M2 have both been found to regulate the activity of neurons in specific DS regions (Corbit et al. 2019), with the impact of OFC on DS being stronger than that of M2. We sought to confirm these findings in vivo. To this end, we first assessed the direct terminal fields of OFC and M2 to DS and mapped this onto a representative brain atlas image (Figure 6B). M2 input to DS was more diffuse than the projections of OFC, consistent with previous findings (Hintiryan et al. 2016; Corbit et al. 2019; Hunnicutt et al. 2016). During DS imaging sessions, animals were able to explore an open-field arena. OFC or M2 were optogenetically stimulated (10s, 20Hz frequency, 5µs pulse width, 3.4mW) with equal duration baseline recordings before and after stimulation. Three distinct response types were observed during the stimulation period and consisted of elevated responses, suppression, or no change relative to baseline activity (paired t-test baseline vs stimulus evoked activity, p<0.05) (Figure 6C). Calcium transients during stimulation differed between these clusters in firing frequency (suppression: 0.26±0.39 Hz, mean±sd, 27 cells, n=2, no change: 0.59±0.68 Hz, mean±sd, 54 cells, n=2, elevation: 1.97±1.40 Hz, mean±sd, 15 cells, n=2).\n\nStimulation was repeated for 10 trials and responses were averaged over trials (Figure 6D). We observed strong modulation of activity in subpopulations of DS neurons during OFC stimulation: 34% of the neurons were classified as being suppressed, 45% displayed no change, and 21% were elevated. M2 stimulation had a similar, but weaker impact on DS neurons activity. Here, 13% of neurons were suppressed, 79% displayed no change, and 8% of cells showed an elevation. Although the number of responsive (suppression and elevation) DS neurons during cortical stimulation varied between OFC and M2 (Mann-Whitney U test, U=726, p=0.001), the mean response of clusters of DS neurons during stimulation was comparable (Figure 6E). Suppressed neurons showed a decrease in activity for the duration of stimulation, whereas neurons responding to input with increased activity showed an increase as long as the stimulation was provided, suggesting that input modulation of activity in DS neurons scales with stimulation duration.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNINscope\n\nWe have demonstrated the applicability of NINscope to perform dual site recordings in mice, and combine superficial and deep brain imaging with optogenetic stimulation, while parsing movements through a built-in accelerometer.\n\nOur 1.6 g miniscope does not compromise in terms of weight or footprint to add functionality, which makes it a valuable contribution to the expanding tool chest of open-source miniscopes. Since NINscope control software is platform-independent it can be used on all major operating systems and using different hardware configurations including laptops that are within reach of most users.\n\nSeveral design choices had to be made during NINscope prototyping. We 3D printed the microscope housing to keep the design light, but eschewed the use of an electrowetting lens, which would have made focusing practical, but the miniscope too heavy and bulky for dual site recordings. The inclusion of a high resolution LED driver for optogenetic stimulation together with the use of an implantable LED probe provided the ability to directly drive projections at their site of origin instead of their terminations within the imaging field-of-view, which is a feature that has not been integrated into a miniscope before.\n\nGiven that our building plans are open-source, the core functionality of our scope can be expanded depending on the specific research questions that need to be addressed, which ultimately dictate the size, weight and functionality constraints. The ability to repurpose the UCLA Miniscope DAQ box (v3.2) for use with NINscope underscores the benefits of sharing resources and we hope that our contributions will further advance miniscope development as well.\n\nCerebello-cerebral interactions\n\nTo our knowledge we present the first concurrent cellular resolution recordings of cerebellum and cerebral cortex in unrestrained mice. We show that synchronous patterns of activity across cerebellum and cerebral cortex are common across multiple behavioral states and are associated significantly with movement acceleration. The ability to record from two sites (e.g. encompassing cerebellum and cortex, or cerebellum and rostral striatum) in freely behaving animals opens up new avenues for research into cerebello-cerebral and cerebello-striatal interactions during the expression of innate and learned behaviors and can help to resolve outstanding questions with regard to the role of the cortical and subcortical structures in planning, learning and executing skilled movements (Guo et al. 2015; Kawai et al. 2015; Sauerbrei et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2018). Changes in joint cell participation during procedural learning (Galiñanes, Bonardi, and Huber 2018; Guo et al. 2015) can be quantified concurrently in cortical and subcortical structures to determine if cell responses are enhanced or suppressed (Kostadinov et al. 2019). Although we did not find a consistent spatial clustering of activity in cerebellum and cortex when neurons in both regions displayed joint activity, a more careful parcellation of the motor behavior in a larger sample may reveal that such clustering does indeed occur.\n\nIn line with findings of tightly coordinated activity in cortex and subcortical structures, recent work has highlighted the motor cortex as an input-driven dynamical system (Sauerbrei et al. 2018), where thalamic input is a prerequisite to drive movements as they happen. Cerebellar output appears essential not only for contributing to the precision of ongoing movements (Becker and Person 2019), but also their planning in sensory discrimination tasks (Gao et al. 2018; Chabrol, Blot, and Mrsic-Flogel 2019). Thus, despite redundancy of motor systems as seen when lesioning selective regions -and assessment of motor performance after a recovery period-, both cortical and subcortical regions are required for successful motor planning and performance under natural conditions. Using NINscope we performed a crude assessment of functional connectivity between cerebellum and cerebral cortex by optogenetically stimulating Purkinje cells bilaterally and medially over the cerebellum. Such stimuli evoked reflexive movements with delays similar to those that we have reported previously and correspond with the timing of rebound activity in the cerebellar nuclei after stimulus offset (Witter et al. 2013). Here, we found that the site of cerebellar stimulation dictates the direction of a movement as shown by our accelerometer data. This movement directionality coincides with the known anatomy of the cerebellum where each cerebellar hemisphere controls the ipsilateral side of the body. We further found that about half of the neurons from cortical imaging sessions responded significantly to strong synchronous cerebellar activation with onsets that were delayed relative to the stimulus onset. Thus, these responses seem to signal the occurrence of a movement rather than that they can be associated with their execution.\n\nAction encoding and input driven responses in dorsal striatum\n\nThe PYTHON480 CMOS sensor incorporated in NINscope enabled recording signals from the dorsal striatum (DS) with good signal-to-noise at powers of a few hundred µW before the relay GRIN lens. This confirms that our miniscope is well suited for imaging from deep-brain structures. Analysis of the data collected both via video camera and the built-in accelerometer, we found that a large portion of recorded neurons in the right DS responded exclusively during leftward turning behavior of the mice, confirming previous findings that identified the striatum as a structure representing action space (Klaus et al. 2017; Cui et al. 2013; Barbera et al. 2016; Tecuapetla et al. 2014). Although our results are overall consistent with previous work, we did not find evidence for a spatial clustering of responsive neurons when the animal made contralateral turns. However, a more in-depth analysis based on a larger number of animals may be required to probe spatial clustering of neurons.\n\nThe DS receives dense input from the ipsilateral orbitofrontal (OFC) and secondary motor (M2) cortices. Slice-physiology experiments have suggested that synaptic inputs from OFC onto neurons of DS (comparable neuroanatomical coordinates as used here) have a stronger effect on the excitability of medium spiny neurons (Corbit et al. 2019). Using NINscope in combination with optogenetic stimulation of OFC or M2 at their site of origin, we demonstrate that more DS neurons respond to OFC than M2 stimulation in vivo. Both inputs modulated activity in DS neurons in awake behaving mice, but the portion of responsive neurons was larger for stimulation of the OFC projection. In these experiments, we did not disambiguate the types of neurons that were positively or negatively modulated. Feedforward excitation directly drives striatal medium spiny neurons (Hintiryan et al. 2016) and input onto fast-spiking interneurons (Mallet et al. 2005) could underlie suppressed responses that were observed during our stimulation. Irrespective of the sign of modulation, we found graded responses in DS neurons that scaled with the duration of the stimulus, thus, proving the efficacy of both stimulation and imaging.\n\nIn conclusion, NINscope is a versatile open-source miniscope that could fit a niche of users that desire dual region recordings in unrestrained animals, OS interoperability, optogenetic manipulation of areas at a distance from the image site, behavioral parsing using an accelerometer, or a combination of all of the above.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPrinted circuit board design\n\nNINscope uses two printed circuit boards (PCBs): a CMOS image sensor and interface PCB each 10 by 10 mm (thickness 0.6 mm, HDI standard) and developed using the open-source and cross-platform electronics design automation suite KiCad (http://kicad-pcb.org). The interface PCB includes the DS90UR913A serializer to connect via an FPD-link III to the DAQ board. The interface PCB is placed on top of the sensor PCB and the two PCBs are connected by wires soldered to the castellated holes at the PCB edges. The sensor PCB contains voltage regulators, a power sequencer and an oscillator necessary for initializing and operating the image sensor. The voltage regulators are ultra-low noise LDO regulators (NCP163, On Semiconductor) and are specced for use in camera applications. The image sensor needs 3 power sources that are provided in a sequence, which we achieve by using a LM3880 power sequencer (Texas Instruments). A 66.6667 MHz low power CMOS clock oscillator (Kyocera Electronics) is used to run the image sensor. In addition to the serializer, the interface PCB has an IMU sensor (LSM6DSLTR, STMicroelectronics), 2 LED drivers (single LED for optogenetic stimuli: LM36011; dual LED for 1 fluorescence excitation LED: LM3643, Texas Instruments) and an I2C I/O expander (FXL6408UMX, ON Semiconductor). The I/O expander controls signals that are not time critical for the image sensor and the tracking/indicator LED on top of the interface PCB. The LED driver and accelerometer are described in more detail below.\n\nCMOS image sensor\n\nThe sensor PCB includes the PYTHON480 (ON Semiconductor) CMOS SVGA image sensor. The PYTHON480 CMOS image sensor is flexible and has many possible configurations. The challenge was to configure it to our demands. Once we figured out how to start the sensor in CMOS instead of LVDS mode we were able to provide the data signals to the general programmable interface (GPIF) of the Cypress USB controller in order to transfer the image data. To optimize power consumption and limit overheating we opted to switch off the PLL to reduce current consumption by 30%. Without the PLL, the CMOS parallel clock output is 4x times lower constraining the amount of pixel data that can be read-out for a given frame rate. We set acquisition rate in the current NINscope to 30 frames per second and the frame size to 752 × 480 pixels to allow read-out of both pixel data and three accelerometer channels from the IMU. Improved thermal dissipation in future iterations of NINscope will make data at higher frame rates up to 120 Hz accessible and allow additional read-out of the gyroscope data from our IMU.\n\nData acquisition hardware\n\nThe UCLA Miniscope project has the largest open-source miniscope community with a user base of hundreds of users. We made use of the existing data acquisition (DAQ version 3.2) hardware from the UCLA Miniscope project (http://www.miniscope.org) and introduced minor modifications consisting of a 256 kB × 8-bit I2C EEPROM (STMicroelectronics) to hold larger firmware and connections on the DAQ PCB between GPIO2 to TP4 and SPI signals to GPO0-GPO3. The PYTHON480 CMOS sensor connects via an FPD-Link III and coaxial cable to the Cypress USB controller on the DAQ board. The image sensor has an SPI instead of an I2C interface for sensor configuration. The general purpose outputs (GPO) are used since the FPD-link in the UCLA DAQ supports an I2C and not an SPI bus. This requires routing signals from MOSI, SCL and SS to GPO0, GPO1 and GPO3 allowing full control of the image sensor from the firmware of the USB-controller. Since our firmware is larger than the existing EEPROM on the UCLA DAQ board, we upgraded the EEPROM to 256 kB. The NINscope firmware is based on example firmware derived from the Cypress application note AN75779 (modification date: 30/10/2017). The CMOS image sensor which is registered as a USB imaging device is expanded to function as a composite USB device to allow the addition of a virtual serial port. The virtual serial port is used for communication and configuration of the CMOS sensor and LED drivers (e.g. to set image sensor gain, brightness, black levels, LED settings, optogenetic stimulus parameters) as well as for logging of the accelerometer data.\n\nA low-power (0.65 mA in high-performance mode) 3D accelerometer and gyroscope iNemo inertial module (LSM6DSLTR, STMicroelectronics), set of LED drivers (single LED for optogenetic stimuli: LM36011; dual LED for 1 fluorescence excitation LED: LM3643, Texas Instruments) and I/O expander (FXL6408, ON Semiconductor) are controlled over the I2C bus. The remaining GPO is used to control pulse generation and precise timing of the optogenetic stimuli by adding a wire connection between GPO2 and TP4 in the UCLA DAQ (Figure 1E).\n\nThe IMU accelerometer has a range of +/-2 g where each bit corresponds to 0.061 mg. A sample rate of 104 Hz is set, which fills a FIFO buffer with x,y,z data that is read out at the end of every image frame and transmitted over the virtual serial connection with the computer.\n\nLED drivers and LEDs\n\nA single-LED flash driver (LM36011, Texas Instruments) and dual-LED driver (LM3643, Texas Instruments) were used to respectively control the generation of optogenetic pulses in a 470 nm LED probe (LED 150040BS73240, 402 case size, Wurth Electronics) or 630 nm LED probe (APHHS1005SURCK, Kingbright) and a 470 nm fluorescence excitation LED (Excitation LED LXML-PB02 470nm, Lumileds) respectively. The optogenetic LED can be adjusted in increments of 11.725 mA and the excitation LED in 1.4mA increments. The maximum current of either LED is dependent on the total current consumption of the camera and type/length of the cable used. A 621 nm LED (SML-P11UTT86R, Rohm) was integrated on top of the interface PCB to allow camera-assisted tracking of animal position and for notification of miniscope connectivity.\n\nNINscope housing\n\nNINscope housing prototypes were designed using Inventor (AutoDesk) with initial prototypes being printed using a Micro Plus Advantage printer (EnvisionTec) using the RCP30 M resin to allow printing of fine detail. The thinnest functional wall of the final prototype had a thickness of 500 µm. The Form 2 (formlabs) printer was subsequently used in printing microscope housing with black resin (RS-F2-GPBK-04). The microscope consists of three parts, an upper part to hold the PCBs, plano-convex lens and emission filter, a lower part for housing the optics including the LED die, half ball lens, excitation filter, and dichroic mirror and a sliding cover to secure the LED and protect the optical filters. The lower part of the microscope has a small protrusion that locks in a notch of the custom metal baseplate (Supplemental Figure 1) and is secured by a set screw to minimize microscope movement. After printing and cleaning the housing with isopropyl alcohol and sand-dusting, the in- and outside housing printed with the EnvisionTec printer was airbrushed (Infinity CR Plus, Harder & Steenbeck, Germany) with a thin coat of black paint (H12 Flat Black, Gunze, Japan).\n\nOptics\n\nWe used custom-diced excitation (ET470/40x 3.5 × 3.5 × 0.5mm, Chroma), dichroic (T495lpxr 3.5 × 5 × 0.5mm, Chroma) and emission filters (ET525/50m, 4 × 4 × 1mm, Chroma) a N-BK7 half ball lens (3 mm diameter, 47-269, Edmund Optics) and a plano-convex lens (4.0mm diameter, 10.0mm focal length, 45-429, Edmund Optics) to focus onto the CMOS image sensor. The emission filter was bonded to this lens with optical adhesive (NOA81, Norland Products). The GRIN lens (NA 0.55, 64-519, Edmund Optics) was implanted for superficial imaging and the miniscope was mounted on a baseplate that was cemented to the skull.\n\nNINscope cabling\n\nTo connect the NIN scope to the DAQ box, a thin (0.101 mm) coaxial wire (38awg A9438W-10-nd, Alpha Wire) of 50 cm length was attached to the miniscope on one end and connected through a connector set (ED90265-ND and ED8250-ND connectors, Digi-Key) to a thicker (1.17mm FEP mm) coaxial wire (VMTX Mini,Pro Power, Alpha Wire) of 2 m at the other end. The 2 m wire was soldered to a 150 mm RG174 coaxial cable assembly with an SMA straight plug (2096227, LPRS) that could be directly attached to the DAQ board. The excitation LED driver was connected to the LED die using 22 mm long ultra-thin wire (UT3607,Habia). A 25 mm long wire of the same type was connected to the optogenetic stimulus LED driver on the interface PCB. On one end a connector was attached (851-43-050-10-001000,Mill-Max of ED90265-ND, Digi-Key) to connect to an optogenetic probe.\n\nNINscope acquisition software\n\nAcquisition software was written in the cross-platform Processing language (https://processing.org/). The software supports acquisition from up to two miniscopes and one USB webcam. The NINscope is controlled via a serial communication port using the Processing serial library, which supports custom microcontroller devices.\n\nThe capture module in the video library for Processing version 2.0 was modified by changing YUV to a raw format to take advantage of the full 8-bit scale. To distinguish cameras and NINscopes of the same type a prefix is added to the string list of all attached devices.\n\nG4P, a Processing library (http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/) was used to create the software user interface, allowing access to the most common controls to change microscope settings and update parameters such as light intensity, gain, black level, optogenetic stimulus duration, or G-sensor logging.\n\nWithin the Processing sketch a capture event function transfers each captured image into a ring buffer for rapid processing of the image and to avoid long hard drive (HD) access times which could cause frame drops. A thread is used to save all images from ring buffer to HD. The size of the ring buffer can modified in the sketch but is set to 60. The Last 4 pixels of a frame are reserved for a frame counter to monitor dropped frames. Every frame is saved as grayscale tiff image with the smallest possible header to reduce file size.\n\nPCB and mechanical designs, firmware and acquisition software can be found on GitHub at: https://github.com/ninscope\n\nMice\n\nWe used both male and female C57/B6 mice (weight range: 22-28 gram). In experiments where Purkinje cells were optogenetically stimulated we used two transgenic mice from a cross between an Pcp2-Cre Jdhu (JAX #010536) and the Ai32 mouse line (JAX # 012569) on a C57/B6 background. All performed experiments were licensed by the Dutch Competent Authority and approved by the local Animal Welfare Body, following the European guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals Directive 2010/63/EU.\n\nGRIN objective lens implants and virus injections\n\nPrior to surgeries mice were anesthetized with 3% Isoflurane before being transferred to a stereotactic apparatus after which anesthesia was maintained at 1.5% Isoflurane (flow rate: 0.3 ml/min O2). For imaging of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, a GRIN objective lens (1.8 mm diameter, 0.25 pitch, 64-519, Edmund Optics) was implanted on the brain surface. A small incision was made in the skin after shaving hair removal and disinfection of the skin with iodine solution (5%) and alcohol (70%). Lidocaine (100 mg/ml, Astra Zeneca, UK) was then applied to the exposed skull and the periosteum removed. The center coordinates for GRIN lens placement were located and a small ink dot was placed at the correct location relative to bregma (cerebellar Simplex lobule, AP: −5.8 mm ML: 2.2 mm; lobule VI, AP: −7.4 mm, ML: 0.0 mm; cortex, AP: 1.4 mm, ML: 1.5 mm). Coordinates were scaled relative to the mean bregma-lambda distance (of 4.21 mm) as specified in Paxinos mouse brain atlas. Prior to drilling of the bone, mice received i.p. Injections of 15% D-Mannitol in saline (0.55 ml/25gr) to aid diffusion of virus particles after virus injection. A 2 mm circular craniotomy was then drilled centered around the marked location. In between drilling the skull was kept moist with sterile saline. The skull flap and dura were then removed and virus (Cerebellum: AAV1.CAG.FLEX.GCaMP6f / AAV1.CMV.PI.Cre.rBG mixed 1:1 and diluted in saline 1:3; Cortex: AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 diluted in saline 1:3, UPenn Vector Core) was injected at four locations. At each location 25 nl of virus was injected once at 350, twice at 300 and once at 250 µm depth at a rate of xx nl/min.The craniotomy was covered with gelfoam (Pfizer, USA) soaked in sterile saline (0.9 % NaCl, B. Braun Medical Inc., USA). The GRIN lens was lowered using a vacuum holder placed in the stereotactic apparatus until the lens surface touched the brain and then lowered an additional 50 µm. The edges of the craniotomy were sealed with Kwik-Sil (WPI, USA). Dental cement (Super-Bond C&B, Sun Medical, Japan) was then applied around the lens to secure it in place. Kwik-Cast (WPI, USA) was used to cover and protect the lens. At the end of the surgery animals received an s.c. injection of 5mg/kg Metacam.\n\nTo access dorsal striatum, GRIN relay lenses with a diameter of 0.6 mm (length: 7.3mm, numerical aperture: 0.45) were implanted (AP: 0.2, ML: 1.5, DV: −3.1). To ease implantation above dorsal striatum, a track was created using a 25G needle. Using a motorized stereotaxic arm, the needle was lowered slowly over the course of 10 min, left in place for 10 min, and then retracted with the same speed at a constant rate of 0.31 mm/min. Virus was delivered by lowering a Hamilton syringe over the course of 4 minutes to inject 500 nl of AAVdj.hSyn.GCaMP6s or AAV1.hSyn.GCaMP6f into the dorsal striatum at a rate of 100 nl/min after which the syringe was retracted (5 min.). Subsequently, the GRIN relay lens was lowered (0.10 mm/min) into the dorsal striatum (DV: −3.1). The gap between the GRIN relay lens and the skull was covered with cyanoacrylate glue and the lens was secured to the skull using dental cement. The GRIN relay lens was covered and protected using Kwik-Cast (World Precision Instruments, USA). A 1.8 mm GRIN objective lens (64-519, Edmund Optics, UK) was secured onto the miniscope baseplate using cyanoacrylate glue and the miniscope was then mounted on the baseplate. The scope with baseplate and objective GRIN lens was then lowered above the GRIN relay lens until cells in the field of view became visible, the baseplate was secured with dental cement (coated with black nail polish) and the miniscope removed.\n\nLED implants above orbitofrontal and secondary motor cortex\n\nIn experiments imaging from dorsal striatum, AAV5.hSyn.ChrimsonR.tdTomato was injected in either the orbitofrontal cortex (AP: 2.8, ML: 1, DV: −2.2) or secondary motor cortex (AP: 2.3, ML: 0.7 DV: −1.2). An LED probe designed to connect to NINscope with a red LED (645nm, KingBright Inc., USA) was placed on the brain surface and the LED was secured to the skull using dental cement.\n\nLED implants above cerebellum\n\nFor cerebellar stimulation, a small 1 mm craniotomy was drilled above the cerebellar region of interest (Simplex lobule, AP: −5.8 mm, ML: 2.2 mm; Lobule VI, AP: −7.4 mm, ML: 0.0 mm; Crus II, AP: −7.3 mm, ML: + and −2.7 mm;) following similar sterile procedures as described for the GRIN objective lens implant. The LED -covered in a layer of biocompatible epoxy- was inserted with proper orientation in the craniotomy, which was then sealed with a layer of Kwik-Sil (WPI, USA) followed by a layer of Kwik-Kast. The remaining probe wire and the probe connector were subsequently cemented to the skull with dental cement (Super-Bond C&B, Sun Medical, Japan).\n\nImaging\n\nRecordings from cerebellum and cerebral cortex were performed in the mouse home cage, while those obtained from dorsal striatum occurred in a custom open field arena (30 by 30 by 45 cm). The miniscopes were attached either following brief anesthesia (3% isoflurane induction, 30 min. post-anesthesia recovery time) to allow connection of the optogenetics LED driver connector to the LED probe, mounting of one or two scopes and focal adjustment, or -when using a modified baseplate- in a head-fixed conditions where animals could run on a treadmill.\n\nHistology\n\nMice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in 1x PBS (10 mM PO43−, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl). After fixation, brains were removed and kept overnight on 10% sucrose in PBS after which they were subsequently embedded in gelatin and left overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS. Brain sections (50 µm) were cut in a cryostat (LEICA CM3050 S), stained with DAPI and then mounted (Dako Fluorescence Mounting Medium, S3023). Confocal images were collected on a SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany) and whole brain images were obtained by stitching multiple (1024×1024 pixel) acquisitions into a final image.\n\nCalcium imaging analysis\n\nTimestamps for all scopes were logged to disk and in case of dual scope recordings, frames were aligned prior to motion correction of the movies using NoRMCorre (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci 2017) and signal extraction using CNMF-E (Zhou et al. 2018). In the cerebellar stimulation experiments, neurons in cortex were classified as responders if the post-stimulus signal rose above the pre-stimulus mean+2σ. Onset times of these calcium transients were determined by fitting a sigmoid function to the transients and onset time was set to where the fitted function rose above mean+σ of the pre-stimulus baseline. Fiji (Schindelin et al. 2012) was used for raw data inspection and to create movies. Analyses were performed in Matlab (Mathworks, Nantucket), Python 3.7 (van Rossum 1995) and R (R Core Team 2019).\n\nWithin and across-region synchronous pattern (SP) detection\n\nCalcium transient events were inferred using a finite rate of innovation algorithm for fast and accurate spike detection (Oñativia, Schultz, and Dragotti 2013) setting τ=1 to obtain the onset times of calcium transients at a sub-recording rate resolution from the calcium transients per cell. These onset times were then convolved with an Epanechnikov kernel (steepness = 0.1) and summed over all cells, resulting in a kernel sum. All time intervals for which the kernel sum was two standard deviations above the mean were considered significant global synchronous events. If the onset times of two cells fell into the same synchronous event, these cells were considered to fire synchronously once. For all pairs of cells, we counted how many times these cells both fired inside the same synchronous event. Subsequently, we selected all synchronous pairs that fired together at least five times. These pairs were stored in a graph, where each node represents a cell, and each edge the number of shared synchronous firing events. These graphs were converted to an arc diagram using the arcdiagram package (Gaston Sanchez, https://github.com/gastonstat/arcdiagram) in R. Cells were grouped by brain region (cerebellum, cortex) and sorted within the group by graph degree, i.e. the number of cells they correlate to. The degree of correlation is represented by the node radius.\n\nAnalysis of behavioral acceleration\n\nTo distinguish whether accelerometer signals exceeded a mean+2σ threshold before or after an SP, we determined first where the largest mean signal occurred. We then made a selection for signals pre- or post-SP that rose above threshold. For the remaining signals we searched 300 ms around the SP (−150, +150 ms) for a rise above threshold. All other signals were classified as showing no SP-related change in behavioral acceleration."
