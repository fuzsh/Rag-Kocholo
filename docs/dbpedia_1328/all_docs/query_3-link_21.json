        "text": "Highland Rim owner seriously injured\n\nHighland Rim Speedway co-owner Roger Cunningham was seriously injured after being thrown from a forklift while preparing the track for Saturday night's races.\n\nCunningham was working on a flagpole on the track in Greenbrier about 1:30 p.m. As he was being lowered to the ground, the engine quit on the forklift and the forklift flipped over onto its back.\n\nCunningham was thrown about 20 feet to the ground.\n\nA LifeFlight helicopter delivered Cunningham to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with compound fractures in both legs, eight broken ribs and a partially collapsed lung.\n\nCunningham was placed on a ventilator. There was no internal bleeding, and a CT scan showed no damage to his brain.\n\n\"I thought I had lost my best friend,\" said co-owner Jerry Criswell, who witnessed the accident. \"It looks like God has worked a miracle and he's probably going to be able to recover.\"\n\nCrisswell said Cunningham had taken the necessary safety precautions and the work he was doing was routine.\n\n\"He was working out of a work platform that has a safety rail and all that stuff around it,\" Criswell said. \"But he was just thrown out of it.\"\n\nThe driver of the forklift, Moises Felipa was also thrown to the ground, but not seriously injured. He was taken to NorthCrest Medical Center in Springfield, treated and released.\n\nSaturday's races went on as scheduled.\n\nAdd Vandy to Ingram's already busy schedule\n\nKevin Ingram has talked himself into yet another job.\n\nIngram is co-host of the popular \"Wake Up Zone\" morning sports talk radio show on WGFX 104.5-FM.\n\nHe's also the voice for Belmont men's basketball games, does play-by-play for the Ohio Valley Conference football games of the week on ESPN3 and for the last five years has broadcast the \"Thursday Night Lights\" high school football gamed on WUXP-30.\n\nLast week, Ingram became the anchor for Vanderbilt basketball, baseball and soccer games for the SEC Network. He handled the play-by-play for the women's soccer match against UAB on Thursday, when the network was launched.\n\nIngram already had decided not to do the \"Thursday Night Lights\" games after that broadcast was moved to Fridays for the upcoming season.\n\nBut he still has plenty on his plate, considering his day starts each morning at 4 a.m. when he arrives at the WGFX studios for the \"Wake Up Zone,\" which airs 6-10 a.m.\n\n\"I don't sleep a whole lot,\" Ingram said. \"I don't go to bed until 10:30 or 11 o'clock a lot of nights, so doing the SEC Network isn't going to make me change my sleeping habits or anything like that.\"\n\nIt won't be the first time Ingram has worked at Vanderbilt. He spent 10 years as the sideline reporter for Commodores football games.\n\n\"When the SEC Network was announced, I knew it was something I wanted to be involved with in some way, and it couldn't have worked out better,\" Ingram said. \"This is a great opportunity to work with my friends at Vanderbilt, and exciting to think about what's ahead as well as the increased exposure for Vanderbilt and all the schools in the league.\"\n\nFormer Pope John Paul II High and Vanderbilt standout Megan Forester will work with Ingram for the soccer matches.\n\nForester was an All-SEC first team member as a senior in 2010 and was was The Tennessean's Midstate Player of the Year in 2005.\n\nLipscomb coach takes Little League trip\n\nLipscomb baseball coach Jeff Forehand and director of operations Brian Ryman traveled to South Williamsport, Pa., on Friday to watch South Nashville play in the Little League World Series.\n\nSouth Nashville coach Chris Mercado played for Forehand when Forehand was the coach at Trevecca.\n\nAfter graduating from Overton, Mercado was an outfielder at Trevecca from 1999-2002.\n\nHouston High, the son of Lipscomb associate athletics director Brent High, plays for South Nashville.\n\nTSU, MTSU players set to play in ArenaBowl\n\nFormer La Vergne and Tennessee State star Sherman Carter and former Middle Tennessee State defensive back Jeremy Kellem will play in ArenaBowl XXVII on Saturday.\n\nCarter is a rookie center and Kellem is a veteran linebacker for the Arizona Rattlers, who are making their fourth consecutive Arena Bowl appearance.\n\nArizona faces the Cleveland Gladiators at 7 p.m. The game will air on ESPN.\n\nCumberland coach gets title, new truck\n\nCumberland baseball coach Woody Hunt has a new truck and it didn't cost him a dime.\n\nHis friends, along with several current and former players, got together and chipped in to pay for a 2013 Ford F-150 with low miles.\n\nHunt was presented with the truck after leading the Bulldogs to their third NAIA World Series title.\n\nWith his new wheels, Hunt finally was able to park the old truck he's driven since he arrived at Cumberland in 1984.\n\nAnyone wishing to contribute to the fund to help pay for the new truck can send donations to the Coach Woody Hunt Appreciation Fund at Wilson Bank and Trust, 623 W. Main St., Lebanon, 37087.\n\nKalis celebrates 40 years on airwaves\n\nRudy Kalis expected to spend no more than two years in Nashville after he arrived as a sports anchor in 1974.\n\nOn Thursday, he will celebrate his 40th anniversary at WSMV-4.\n\n\"I thought I'd be going off to what I called the big-time,\" said Kalis, 67. \"But there's a Proverb that I love, 16:9 that says, \"In his heart a man plans his way in life, but it's the Lord who directs his steps.\"\n\nKalis isn't planning on retiring anytime soon.\n\n\"At some point I might want to change the schedule a little bit, but I still love what I do,\" he said. \"I've gotten to a point where I like the people in sports more than I do the sports themselves. I'm fascinated by the people, and those are the ones I'd like to do more with.\"\n\nCohn great Sexton dies\n\nFormer Cohn High football standout Glenn Sexton died of a heart attack Tuesday.

It just all works out as a better comprehensive plan for the kids' well-being, I think, to play on Wednesdays instead of Mondays.\"\n\nThe men's format will stay Thursday/Saturday.\n\nBracketing for the women's tournament is changing after four years under a merit-based format that gave the top four seeds byes.\n\nThe 2014-15 tournament at Municipal Auditorium will have the No. 1 seed vs. No. 8 and No. 2 vs. No. 7 on Wednesday, with the teams winning those games having an off day Thursday when the first-round games continue with Nos. 3-6 and Nos. 4-5 matchups.\n\nThe semifinals will remain on Friday with the championship Saturday.\n\nIf you have an item for Midstate Chatter, contact Mike Organ at 615-259-8021 and on Twitter at @MikeOrganWriter.\n\nSPORTS ON NASHVILLE TV\n\nThe top five ratings for local sporting events on TV for Aug. 4-10.\n\n1.
