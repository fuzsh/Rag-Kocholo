Zoeller, MD, DMD Professor Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery University Hospital Cologne Germany Preface Miniplate osteosynthesis without interfragmentary com- pression is now considered the best treatment for frac- tures of the mandible. The experimental and clinical in- vestigations that allowed the advantages of this technique to be demonstrated were carried out in Strasbourg by a team drawn from the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Faculty of Medicine, the Higher National School of Arts and Industries, and the Research Group in Bone and Joint Biomechanics of Strasbourg. This research was purposely limited to the biomechan- ical study of osteosynthesis of the horizontal body and mandibular angle. It was concluded that the best method of surgical treatment in mandibular fractures was inevi- tably the result of a compromise in which all the con- straints under which the operator works should be taken into account. These include anatomical and physiological conditions, biological requirements with regard to the equipment used, mechanical properties of the mandible andmechanical characteristics ofminiaturized equipment set against the forces which are exerted on the bone, surgical imperatives. The choice of osteosynthesis by small plates in other sectors of facial surgery (such as mandibular condyles, midfacial surgery, and orthopedic surgery) arises in part from the therapeutic orientation of the surgeon, based on nonexperimental but logical deductions from investiga- tions carried out on themandible, partly from the conven- ience that the plates offer, and is finally confirmed by the results obtained. The improvements in quality of treatment of facial in- juries far exceed the expectations that we had following the results of the first biomechanical research in the early 1970s. The essential objectives of our biomechanical and clin- ical research were to apply the rigorous principles ofmod- ern orthopedic surgery to maxillofacial surgery and to reduce the empiricism which all too often guides the choice of therapy. I should like to extend my thanks to the engineering students A. Boyoud, J. Patti, B. Sustrac, and J. P. Villebrun as well as to engineering professors Schmidt and Freund from ENSAIS; to Prof. I. Kempf and Dr. J. H. Jaeger, founder and chief manager, respectively, of the research group at the Centre de Traumatologie, and to Dr. J. P. Loddé, the surgeon responsible for maxillofacial surgery in this team; to Dr. J. M. Schnebelen, a faithful and committed colleague during the long and difficult phase of preparation; and finally to all those young colleagues who enthusiastically accepted and reviewed the technique as well as the new biome- chanical drafts, Dr. A. Mariano, Dr. L. G. Gastello, Dr. P. Mercks, and Dr. M. J. Rauscher. Many thanks are owed to all oral and maxillofacial sur- geons who have disseminated the concept of miniplate osteosynthesis internationally, both by their convictions and by the quality of their work. They are too numerous for me to name them all individually. Some of them are co- authors of this book, including in particular Prof. Dieter Pape and Prof. Klaus Gerlach, with whom I have enjoyed a prolific scientific cooperation. Maxime Champy VII Introduction to the First Edition In the past intermaxillary fixation has been the traditional method for supporting bone ends in close apposition to allow undisturbed bone healing of fractures of the facial skeleton and also of osteotomies after orthognathic surgi- cal procedures. Although techniques of fracture immobi- lization utilizing bone plates and screwswere described by Lambotte (1913), Warnekros (1917), and Wassmund (1927), it was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that Hans Luhr (1968), Bernd Spiessl (1969), Wilfried Schilli (1969), and Rüdiger Becker (1973) popularized this technique and introduced methods of bicortical com- pression utilizingmaxiplates and screws for the fixation of mandibular fractures. Such techniques are often utilized in an extraoral approach and open reduction. The basic prin- ciples require anatomical reduction, stable internal fixa- tion, and a surgical technique causing minimal trauma to achieve early, pain-free mobilization. To allow bicortical screw fixation of the mandible bone, plates have to be positioned at the lower border to avoid damage to the dental roots and also to the inferior alveolar canal. Appli- cation of compression plates at the site of compression at the lower border is biomechanically unfavorable resulting in distraction at the area of tension, namely the upper border of the mandible, and also causing distraction in the dental arch. In addition, application of compression to the convex buccal surface of the mandible results in distraction of the fracture on the lingual side, which is very difficult to overcome. Maxime Champy and coworkers (1975) developed the technique of Francois Michelet and A. Moll (1971). He described a method of monocortical fixation using mini- aturized plates applied to the narrow surface of the man- dible via an intraoral approach. He studied the tension and compression forces of fractured mandibles and found that miniplate application on the tension side of the mandible produced adequate stability to render inter-maxillary fix- ation unnecessary. The technical advantages of miniplate osteosynthesis are as follows: plates are small and easily adapted, they are applied monocortically, the approach is intraoral and they provide functional stability since the system is biomechanically balanced. Subsequently the method has been accepted worldwide. As a tribute to his home town, Champy founded the Strasbourg Osteosynthesis Research Group (SORG), to- gether with Dieter Pape. SORG comprises an international group of surgeons with a clinical and scientific interest in osteosynthesis techniques. The aims of SORG are to foster scientific development at all levels by controlled clinical studies and research, individual and collaborative publi- cations, continuing educational courses and by the devel- opment of new techniques and improved instrumentation to further develop the principle of osteosynthesis in the fields of oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery. Although miniplate osteosynthesis is directed to the management of mandibular fractures, the principles of osteosynthesis have now been applied to orthognathic surgery, craniofacial surgery, treatment of midfacial frac- tures, reconstructive bone surgery, and to reconstructive preprosthetic surgery including dental implantology. Although there are many different designs of miniplates and screws used throughout the world, these variants are all based on the original concept developed by Maxime Champy. This book is written by many surgeons who have exten- sive experience in osteosynthesis techniques utilizing plates and screws with different systems. For this reason different techniques appear in the text, using different systems devised by Champy. It is for the reader to decide which technique is preferable. This book serves as an atlas of surgical procedures and offers clinical guidelines for using mini and microplate osteosynthesis in the cranio- maxillofacial region. We thank the editorial staff at Thieme International for their professionalism and attention to detail, John Cawood and Peter Ward Booth for checking the English, Andreas Reinhardt for the illustrations, and Verena Hinz for typing the manuscript. Franz Haerle Bill C. Terry VIII Introduction to the Second Edition The Atlas of Craniomaxillofacial Osteosynthesis has been a topical work for almost 10 years. It has been reprinted twice, and has even been published in the Korean lan- guage. Owing to continuous demand, we gladly complied with the wishes of Thieme Publishers and—together with the authors—have systematically revised the text, corrected the illustrations, and have overseen the completion of manynewand revised chapterswith newauthors, in order to update them in line with current developments in os- teosynthesis. We thank the editorial staff of Thieme Publishers for their professional cooperation, Andreas Reinhardt for the illustrations, and Verena Hinz for typing the manuscript. Franz Haerle Bill C.

Anatomical Considerations The Mandible Following innovative intraoral miniplate osteosynthesis (Michelet, Deymes, and Dessus, 1973), experimental work and clinical application have demonstrated that monocortical fixation by miniplates is strong enough to withstand the different strains created by masticatory forces (Champy et al., 1975; Champy et al., 1976a, b; Champy et al., 1977; Champy et al., 1978a, b; Champy and Lodde, 1976; Champy and Lodde, 1977; Jaeger, 1978). Because fixation is accomplished by anchoring the miniplates to the bone by means of screws, it is important to know both: · the regions where the bone provides the screws with a firm anchorage · the topography of the dental apices and inferior alveo- lar nerve, to avoid damaging them when inserting the screws The outer cortex of the body of the mandible has an average thickness of 3.3mm; it is particularly strong and offers a good anchorage for the osteosynthesis screws. The cortical bone is thicker in the chin region and is reinforced laterally by the oblique line, which runs from the coronoid process to the molar region. In the symphysis region cross-sections of the mandible show the thickest cortex to be at the lower border; behind the third molar it is stronger at the upper border (Fig.1.1). Near the alveolar process the thickness of the bone is variable; the anatomy of the tooth roots and the structure of the bone do not allow screw fixation in this region (Gerber, 1975). To avoid damaging the root apices, it is safe to place the screws away from the occlusal plane by a distance of at least three times the length of the crown of the tooth. The inferior alveolar nerve runs in the mandibular canal, from the lingula to the mental foramen, on a con- cave course. Measurements show that, from back to front, it runs ever closer to the outer cortex and to the lower 1 Fig. 1.1 Lateral view of a mandible. The lateral and inner cortex of the body of the mandible is taken out. border. At its lowest point it is 8–10mm away from the basilar border of the mandible. Although the average thickness of the cortex in that region is 5mm, it may be less than 3mm in some cases. About 1 cm before the mental foramen, the canal turns upward and forward (Härle, 1977). The foramen lies approximately midway between the alveolar crest and the lower border of the mandible on a vertical line corresponding to the first or second premolar. It is important to remember that the mental foramen sometimes lies higher than the canine apex. Therefore, osteosynthesis in this region involves a certain risk of apical injury. In most cases the mandibular canal surrounds the neu- rovascular bundle as a bony tunnel, but sometimes its bony structure is poorly developed. Repeated tests in freshly preparedmandibles have shown that the intrusion of a screw into the canal does not usually cause nerve injury, because the nerve moves away from the instru- ment (Gerber, 1975). Drilling the holes appears to be more dangerous to the nerve than inserting the screws. It should be noted that, with aging, the alveolar bone atrophies and the structure of the mandible is reduced to the two cortical layers. In edentulous patients the flat upper border of the mandible is composed of sclerous bone, giving poor anchorage for the screws. One should keep in mind that in children the mandib- ular body is occupied by dental germs. The alveolar bone is covered with attached mucosa. When a fracture occurs, the gum is often lacerated, ex- posing the mandibular bone to the risk of infection from the oral cavity if treatment is not instituted within 12 hours. During the first years of life, the blood supply of the mandible depends on the inferior dental artery (Cohen, 1960). Later, periosteal vascularization increasingly takes over. In the adult subject, as demonstrated by Bradley (1975), the blood supply relies entirely on the periosteum of the basilar process. This area should therefore be treat- ed with care. Extensive periosteal stripping should be avoided to preserve the blood supply. For this reason a transmucosal rather than a transcutaneous approach is preferred. The Midface and the Cranial Bones In the facial and cranial skeleton the thickness of cortical bone is variable. The use of miniplate osteosynthesis in cranial and midface surgery has been advocated by Loddé and Champy (1976), and Champy, Loddé, and Grasset (1977). Short miniscrews of 3mm or 5mm in length should be used in cranial surgery. Those areas where the cortical bone is thick and therefore suitable for osteosyn- thesis include the cranium, the nasal bone, the zygomatic bone, the orbital rim, the marginal rim of the piriform aperture and the zygomatic buttress (Mariano, 1978). Elsewhere the cortical bone that constitutes the walls of the various cavities is thin and does not provide a very solid anchorage for osteosynthesis screws, and is only suitable for fixation with microscrews and microplates (Fig.1.2). The frontal bone ranges from 4 to 9mm in thickness. The upper orbital margins are particularly well-suited for plate placement, but care should be taken to localize the contours of the frontal sinus. Bone thickness allows place- ment of 5mm long screws without risking dural penetra- tion. The parietal bone also provides adequate thickness for fixation with screws of 3mm in length. The frontozygomatic process, which resembles a trian- gular prism, is made of compact cortical bone and pro- vides an excellent area for fixation of cortical screws. It is covered with a periosteum that is easily elevated, except at the frontomalar suture. The lateral orbital rim extending to the zygomatic arch provides sufficient bone for screw fixation. The eye should be protected during the operation by using an appropriate retractor. After Champy et al., 1975, the anterior cerebral fossa can be avoided; its deepest point is located 16–20mm above the frontomalar suture, or 5mm above a horizontal line tangential to the upper orbital margin (Fig.1.3). 2 1 Anatomical Aspects and Biomechanical Considerations for the Body of the Mandible, the Midface, and the Cranium Fig. 1.2 Elective zones of miniplate osteosynthesis. Favorable regions are colored blue. The red zone is a region where microplates can be used. The green zone is a region where microplates or miniplates can be used. The lower orbital rim is also an area of thick cortical bone. However, because neither muscular force nor any strain is exerted on it, its fixation with a plate seems unwarranted. If isolated fragments require immobiliza- tion, absorbable ligatures or microplates are mechanically sufficient. The maxilla has only two buttresses made of compact and strong bone: the lateral inferior aspect of the piriform aperture (medial or nasomaxillary buttress), and the lat- eral or zygomatic or maxillary buttress. The importance of these pillars or buttresses was described in 1928 by Sicher and Tandler, by de Brul (1970) and more recently by Manson, Hooper, and Su, 1980. The anterior wall of the maxillary sinus is thin and less suitable as a support for miniplates. Finally, remember that many cavities exist in this area, some of which contain organs that must be preserved, such as the dura, the eyes, and the dental roots. The walls of the frontal, maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses, the nasal fossae, and the buccal cavity are generally thin and fragile. Protrusion of screws into these cavities should be avoided, as there is a risk of causing infection, particularly in the frontal sinus and the nasal cavity. Biomechanical Principles Physiology is the scientific study of the properties and functions of tissues in living beings. Mechanics is the scientific study of the equilibrium of forces and the movements that generate them. Biomechanics is the study of biological phenomena with the objective of proposing explanations or therapeu- tic solutions for such phenomena (e. g., fractures). In prac- tice it consists of an amalgamation of knowledge from engineers and biologists. The biomechanical principles of monocortical mini- plate osteosynthesis are based on mathematical and ex- perimental studies performed in Strasbourg, France, by the Groupe dEtudes en Biomecanique Osseuse et Articu- laire de Strasbourg. The objective of this biomechanical research is to reduce as much as possible the empiricism that too often guides the surgeon’s choice of treatment, and to obviate the need for experimental human re- search—or even illegal human and animal experiments. This research work, which concerned the mandible only, resulted in the development of a stable, elastic, dynamic osteosynthesis system that is able to guarantee fracture healing without either maxillomandibular fixation or in- terfragmental compression (Champy in Huckel, 1996). This has been achieved as a result of the following con- siderations and experiments. Goals The ideal method of treating mandibular fractures is one that establishes a functional therapy bymovement. There- fore, it should aim for: · re-establishment of previous occlusion · perfect anatomical reduction · complete and stable fixation, allowing painless mobi- lization of the injured region · maintenance of the blood supply of the fragments, of the fracture surfaces, and of the surrounding tissues 3Biomechanical Principles Fig. 1.3 Localization of the anterior cerebral fossa. Its deepest point lies 16–20mm above the frontomalar suture, 5mm over the tangential line of the upper orbital margin. The biomechanical requirements for optimal osteosynthe- sis are that: · the plates and screws must withstand the various stresses due to those tensile and torsional forces to which the mandibular bone is typically subject · the plates have to be malleable for easy adaptation to the bone surface, especially in the curved symphysis and molar region, to secure anatomical reduction and to restore perfect dental occlusion · the dimensions of the plates should ensure minimal periosteal elevation and fracture site exposure; fur- thermore, the oral mucosa must be able to cover the plate without any difficulty, without any dead space around the plate and the head of the screws · the size of the screws has to be appropriate for the thickness of the cortex Masticatory Stress Distribution in the Mandible Knowledge of masticatory stresses exerted on the man- dible is fundamental, because these stresses determine the rational design and positioning of osteosynthesis plates and their mechanical characteristics. The activity of the muscles of mastication can be divided into temporalis forces, masseter forces, and reac- tive biting forces. The latter have the most adverse effects on immobilization of the fracture. These forces vary from patient to patient. By means of strain gauges connected to aWheatstone bridge, maximal biting forces in young men with healthy teeth were measured. The following values were obtained: · incisor region: 290 N (Champy–Loddé) 265N (Meyer) · canine region: 300 N (Champy-Loddé) 300N (Meyer) · premolar region: 480N (Champy-Loddé) 480N (Meyer) · molar region: 660 N (Champy-Loddé) 506N (Meyer) The interaction of these forces varies from patient to patient and affects the degree of fracture displacement that must be overcome by treatment. It is important to understand the distribution of strains created within the mandible as a result of these external forces. Physiologically coordinated muscle function pro- duces tension forces at the upper border of the mandible and compressive forces at the lower border (Weigele, 1921; Winkler, 1922; Motsch, 1968; Küppers, 1971; Boy- oud and Paty, 1975; Champy and Lodde, 1976; Tillmann, Härle and Schleicher, 1983). In addition, Sustrac and Ville- brun (1976) and Weigele (1921) demonstrated that tor- sion forces are produced anterior to the canines (Fig.1.4). In every mandibular fracture these forces cause dis- traction at the alveolar crest region, accentuated by the degree of trauma and by contraction of the muscles of the floor of the mouth, which can lead to displacement of the fragments. The compressive force at the lower border is a dynamic and physiological force, which is exerted permanently on the fractured fragments along their basilar border (Boyoud and Patty, 1975; Champy and Lodde, 1976; Ewers and Härle, 1985a). This compression is due to muscular tonus and increases during mastica- tory function. When the osteosynthesis is adequately performed, and provided there is no defect in the frac- ture site, this dynamic compression exactly equals the physiological strains that are exerted on an intact man- dible (Champy and Lodde, 1976; Tillmann, Härle and Schleicher, 1983). The momentums of compression, tension, and torsion have been established using a mathematical model of the mandible using the formula E = F × L/d, where E is the state of constraints, F the masticatory forces, L the distance from chin to the fracture line, and d the distance from the plate to the lower border of the mandible. In any method of fixation of a fractured bone, friction forces controlling shearing and torsion stresses are a very important factor of stability. These forces between frac- ture surfaces exist due to interdigitation and are enhanced 4 1 Anatomical Aspects and Biomechanical Considerations for the Body of the Mandible, the Midface, and the Cranium Fig. 1.4 Forces exerted on the man- dible from the angle of the mandi- ble to the incisor region. Throughout the body of the mandible, biting forces produce tension forces (dashed lines) at the upper border and com- pressive forces (solid lines) at the lower border. Torsion forces are pro- duced anterior to the canines (dotted lines). by compression forces. With interdigitation of poor qual- ity, friction forces are reduced or even nonexistent. A double plate fixation is then necessary. This is the case in surgical interruptive osteotomy, fractured atrophic mandible, infected fracture, pseudoarthrosis, and recon- structive surgery (Champy and Lodde, 1975). Definition of an Ideal Osteosynthesis Line on the Mandible Given the unique anatomy of the mandible, this biome- chanical study defines an ideal osteosynthesis line for the mandibular body (Fig.1.5). It corresponds to the course of a tension line at the base of the alveolar process inferior to the root apices. In that region a plate can be fixed with monocortical screws, as follows: · behind the mental foramina the plate is applied imme- diately below the dental roots and above the inferior alveolar nerve · at the angle of the jaw the plate is placed ideally on the inner broad surface of the external oblique line; if this has been destroyed, the plate is fixed on the external cortex as high as possible (Fig.1.5) · in the anterior region, between themental foramina, in addition to the subapical plate, another plate near the lower border of the mandible is necessary to neutralize the torsion forces The result of such a monocortical stable–elastic–dynamic osteosynthesis is the neutralization of the distraction and torsion strains exerted on the fracture site, while physio- logical self-compression strains are restored. Interfrag- mentary compression by means of rigid plate and bicort- ical screws does not permit this effect. In cases of com- minuted fractures it is necessary to apply additional plates to re-establish the physiological strains and to neutralize torsion strains (Fig.1.6). Other Therapeutic Applications · An osteotomy of the mandible with a saw corresponds to a loss of substance of 1–2mm. Therefore, neither interdigitation nor friction forces occur between the two separated surfaces of the fragments. Bringing the fragments close together will have bad consequences for dental occlusion. A double plate fixation is neces- sary to maintain the preoperative position of the frag- ments and to re-establish a correct occlusion (Champy and Lodde, 1975). · In the edentulous mandible the correct position of the plate is on the outer cortex of the mandible, where the biting forces produce tension forces at the upper bor- der of the mandible. The plate should never be fixed on the upper flat surface where the bone is sclerous (Fig.1.7). · In the case of an advanced atrophy of the mandible, tension and compression strains are concentrated in a narrow bundle. Fracture surfaces are very narrow and friction forces between them are small. These small surfaces do not offer the miniplate an adequate support for the compressive forces, thus even the reduced masticatory forces entail the risk of deforma- tion or rupture of the plate. The mathematical formula E = F x L/d, defined above, demonstrates that the strains exerted on the plate are inversely proportional to the distance between the plate and the lower border. A double plate fixation is then necessary, with a dis- tance of at least 2mm in between. Where the vertical dimension of the buccal cortex is less than 1 cm, a reinforced plate has to be used. 5Biomechanical Principles Fig. 1.5 The ideal osteosynthesis position and ideal osteosyn- thesis line on the mandibular body. Fig. 1.6 Osteosynthesis position on the mandibular body with a comminuted fracture and a displaced basal triangle segment. The small fragment may be replaced in anatomical position be- tween larger mandibular segments, so that the compressive forces at the lower border can re-establish the physiological strains when the miniplate neutralizes the distraction forces at the upper border. The fracture on the mandibular angle is fixed on the inner surface of the external oblique line. In any case, bone being sometimes brittle in elderly patients, fixation of the plates has to be done on each side of the fracture line with at least three screws (Champy et al., 1978a). More recent clinical experience in this particular case showed that the use of reinforced six-hole miniplates is preferable to standard miniplates (A. Wilk, 2007, personal communication). · In reconstructive surgery of the mandible, a subse- quent study using the finite elements method corro- borated the solidity of the mandibular reconstruction using a free bone graft fixed by two reinforced plates (see Chapter 27; Boutemy, 1994; Rousseau and Ségard, 1994; Dalsanto et al., 1995; Champy in Huckel, 1996 pp. 47–48). Discussion: The fixation of a fractured mandible per- formed following these biomechanical principles is a sta- ble–elastic–dynamic osteosynthesis (SED) (Champy in Huckel, 1996 pp. 52–53). Stable An osteosynthesis is stable when: · no movement of distraction is visible between the fragments · it neutralizes the harmful distraction strains · with precise repositioning of fragments it provides the compressive muscular forces with a solid support at the basilar border and ensures interdigitation and fric- tion forces between the contacting fracture surfaces · it allows early mobilization of the mandible but not complete loading · it has been demonstrated through computer-assisted calculation (Rousseau and Segard,1994; Dal Santo et al., 1995) Elastic The osteosynthesis plate has an adequate degree of elas- ticity adapted to that of the bone and is fixed at a high position. Rigid immobilization of the fractured bone ends can disrupt the process of natural bone repair by inhibition of the inflammatory phase of bone healing (Sarmiento et al., 1984; Sarmiento, Sobol et al., 1984). Both complete inhibition of limb function and rigid fixation of fracture fragments are deleterious to natural healing (Cornell, 1992). Micro motion between the frac- ture surfaces enhances the healing process (Cornell, 1992). Dynamic Because of the adequate elasticity of the plate, masticatory muscles activity creates compression strains at the lower border. The interdigitation between the fracture surfaces creates friction, enhancing the stability of the osteosyn- thesis. The produced compression is dynamic and physiolog- ical. The strains are transferred from one fragment to the other, eventually to a bone graft. This leads to a perfect contact between bone surfaces due to the adequate elas- ticity of the plate and, simultaneously, to a stimulus for bone healing. Using the finite elements method (Dalsanto, 1995), we proved the existence of micro motion between the con- tacting surfaces of a bone graft and the reconstructed mandible. This is the case in the technique of reconstruc- tive surgery according to Pape and Gerlach (1993) where the free bone graft is fixed by double miniplate osteosyn- thesis. The value of micro motion is of 0.5μm. The dimension of the osteon is of 60μm. It is generally accepted that motion inferior to the dimensions of the osteon is not deleterious for the healing process. If this mobility is impaired or abolished by a rigid plate, the normal inflam- matory period of bone repair is shortened and even sup- pressed. The degree of motion is key. Appropriate stimulus and blood supply are crucial (Cornell, 1992). Controlled motion at a micro mechanical level appears to optimize the chemical and electrical con- ditions that govern fracture repair. Biomechanics and Principles of Surgical Repair in the Midface and Cranium by Microplates or Miniplates (Traumatology and Deformities) The use of monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis in the cranium and midface, although not based on experimen- tal work, can be considered as a logical extension of this method and is supported by excellent clinical results. The 6 1 Anatomical Aspects and Biomechanical Considerations for the Body of the Mandible, the Midface, and the Cranium Fig. 1.7 Fractured edentulous mandible. A miniplate has been applied on the upper border of the mandible on the outer cortex. It should not be placed on the superior flat surface of the mandible consisting of sclerous bone (see also Fig. 7.19). forces exerted on the cranium and facial bones are com- plex, three-dimensional, and difficult to evaluate. They produce various strains on osteosynthesis plates, in every direction, with a preponderance of bending and torsion stresses as opposed to compression forces. The first source of strain is the result of the masticatory forces, lingual pressure, and action of masseter and lateral pterygoid muscles. This strain is certainly less important and easier to neutralize than that on the mandible, as demonstrated in 1976 by Champy and Lodde (Fig.1.8). The technique for midface surgery has evolved directly from orthopedic and reconstructive craniofacial surgery, utilizing direct fixation and immediate bone grafting (Tessier, 1967). · In midface traumatology (and in orthopedic surgery), after occlusion has been re-established, the principles of repair involve four important concepts. First, recon- struction of the anterior maxillary buttresses is the key to maxillary repair. Second, direct exposure and fixa- tion of these buttresses provide exact anatomical re- construction. Third, reinforcement of unstable but- tresses with miniplates or replacement of comminuted or damaged buttresses with immediate bone grafting will allow reconstruction and stabilization of even the most severe injuries without the need for internal cranial suspension or external fixation devices. Finally, buttress reconstruction will prevent late midfacial col- lapse or elongation and secondary deformity. Mono- cortical miniplate osteosynthesis has proved to be strong enough to withstand all the detrimental forces and to ensure bone healing without interfragmentary compression. · In craniofacial surgery the use of osteosynthesis by miniplates has been advocated by Champy and Loddé (1977, 1978) and has been considered by Tessier as a major contribution for the treatment of fractures or congenital deformities. The advantage of fixation by plate over wire fixation is to provide a three-dimen- sional immobilization of the bone fragments in the desired position, rendering useless all devices of fixa- tion like halo-frame, etc. · For the anesthetist, all procedures being done without intermaxillary fixation (IMF), osteosynthesis repre- sents remarkable and much appreciated progress (Rauscher, 1978): – tracheostomy more frequently avoidable in many cases – better airway protection during the operation and in the recovery phase (reducing the postoperative agitation, especially in polytrauma, psychiatric, or alcoholic patients) – reduction of the risk of asphyxia – easy control of vomiting (gastric intubation not necessary) – possible reintubation in case of respiratory distress – comfort for the patient (Williams and Cawood, 1990) The use of submandibular tracheal intubation (Altemir, 1986) makes all bimaxillary procedures and the cranial approach safer. In intensive care the miniplate osteosynthesis, even- tually associated to submandibular tracheal intubation (Altemir, 1986), is a very important and determinant fac- tor, often making possible, for the patient’s benefit, a global, unique and definitive treatment. 7Biomechanical Principles Fig. 1.8 Maxillary and mandibular buttresses. This figure shows the two anterior buttresses (medial or nasomaxillary and lateral or zygomaticomaxillary) and the posterior buttress (pterygomaxillary). The relationship of these buttresses to the cranial base and the orbit above, the mandible below and the correct occlusion is seen. Tor- sion forces (dotted line) are produced by muscle activity anterior to the canines of the mandible (see Figs. 1.4, 2.1, and 21.1). 2 Biomechanics of Fractures of the Condylar Region and Principles of Repair Christophe Meyer The anatomical feature of the ascending branches of the mandible is of great importance for the osteosynthesis of fractures of the condylar region. In the frontal plane, the ascending branch has a more or less pronounced S-shape, and the amount of spongy bone lying between the inner and outer cortices is very variable (Härle, 1980; Schneider et al., 2005), depending on the age and gender of the patient and on anatomical variation among individuals. This may sometimes hinder the insertion of an intrame- dullar axial lag screw. At the level of a typical condylar neck fracture, which is at the level of the sigmoid notch, cross-sections show that the thickest cortical bone is lo- cated dorsally and laterally at the outer cortex of the condylar neck (Härle, 1980; Tillmann et al., 1983; Krenkel, 1994). Ventrally, the outer and inner cortices merge in a thin blade-shaped ridge at the level of the sigmoid notch. This may explain why, historically, osteosynthesis plates have been placed vertically in the axis of the condylar neck. The mandibular stresses during mastication are mainly related to the contraction forces of the masticatory muscles: temporalis, masseter muscles, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, and lowering muscles. These muscular forces induce, in turn, two more external forces, namely the reactive biting force exerted on the teeth and the intra-articular reactive force exerted on the intra-articular point of contact. The muscular contraction forces produc- ing these biting forces were also calculated indirectly by measuring the cross-section of these muscles and by registering their electromyographical activity during a given chewing exercise (Meyer et al., 1998, Meyer, 2008a). As an example, the values obtained for a biting exercise atmaximal intensity performed between the first molars were as follows: · anterior part of the temporal muscle: 412N per side · posterior part of the temporal muscle: 169N per side · masseter muscle: 475N per side · lateral pterygoid muscle: 418N per side · medial pterygoid muscle: 382N per side · lowering muscles (considered as a whole): 83N per side For the same exercise, the intra-articular force, calculated by solving the static equilibrium equations, was 676N per side, which implies that the temporomandibular joint is a heavily loaded joint—at least, for this exercise. Concerning the ascending branch of the mandible, these external forces were found to produce compressive forces at the posterior border of the ramus, running ver- tically and parallel to the condylar neck axis, and also tension forces running perpendicular to the compression forces mentioned above (Fig. 2.1) as demonstrated by Meyer et al., 2002, and Meyer, 2008a. In case of condylar fracture, the physiological mastica- tory forces, therefore, tend to produce a gap in the ventral part of the fracture line (Fig. 2.1). 8 Fig. 2.1 Simplified representation of the stress distribution in the as- cending branch of the mandible. Dotted lines: compression strains, solid lines: tension strains. In the condylar region, ideal osteosynthesis lines may be defined (Fig. 2.1). The superior one, which runs parallel under the sigmoid notch, is intended to restore the ten- sion forces located in this area, similar to the line located in the mandibular body, The inferior one, located verti- cally in the axis of the condylar neck, is intended for maintaining the reduction out of the sagittal plane as rotation strains (in the axial plane) and bending strains (in the frontal plane) which may occur during function, leading to a secondary displacement of the fracture. That is why an increasing number of authors nowadays recom- mend the use of two straight miniplates, or the use of a three-dimensional trapezoidal plate (Fig. 2.2), as demon- strated by Meyer et al. (2006, 2007) and Meyer (2008a, b). 9Biomechanics of Fractures of the Condylar Region and Principles of Repair Fig. 2.2 Optimal osteosynthesis techniques for the stabilization of subcondylar fractures.

The upper arm superimposes perfectly over the tensile strain lines running under the sigmoid notch. 3 Sublingual Hematoma: Pathognomic of Fracture of the Mandible Ingo N. Springer and Franz Haerle Diagnostic radiology has made tremendous strides over the past 25 years. Today, we are able to image the entire human body within minutes, depicting both soft tissues and hard tissues in the same image. Computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction of radiological data provides images that are impressive and quite reliable, but at the same time they tempt us to forget the living correlate: the patient. In most cases this may even be admissible; however, it still appears to be beneficial to keep our set of clinical tools complete and begin our investigation with a thorough examination of the patient, prior to deciding a course of action. After trauma, certain clinical signs are suggestive of a fractured mandible: for example, a disturbance of occlu- sion, mouth opening, and sensitivity of the lower lip. Other less specific indications include pain, swelling, and facial bruising. All of these, however, can also be associ- ated with, or caused by, conditions other than fracture. The two most specific signs of a fracture are abnormal mobility of mandibular fragments and crepitation. Here, we would like to focus attention on the sublingual he- matoma, which Frank Coleman (1910, 1912) found, almost 100years ago, to be very useful when the usual signs of fracture of a jaw were either absent or difficult to detect. Of course, this was during a time when radiology was in its earliest stages of development, and not yet widely available. Coleman described the sublingual hematoma in asso- ciation with trauma as an effusion of blood into the floor of the mouth with elevation of the mucous membranes and a “characteristic bluish, tense swelling under the tongue.” He suggested that the presence of a sublingual hematoma alone could differentiate between an external bruise from one that was additionally associated with disunion of the jaw. He considered a sublingual haema- toma as “almost pathognomonic of fracture of the man- dible” (Coleman 1910, 1912), a finding he based on over 50 observations. This discovery is often forgotten, and for this reason we would like to emphasize it again here. During the past 25 years, the senior author has seen around ten patients, each of whom presented with a hematoma on the lingual side of the mandible and no other obvious signs of fracture. In all of these instances, the dislocation was so mild that the fragments were not evident on panoramic radiographs, but only on special dental (occlusal) projections. In many cases the dislocation of mandibular fragments is so severe that, in addition to hematoma formation, a rupture of both the nonelastic periosteum and the elastic superficial mucosa will occur on the lingual and/or buccal side of the mandible. This rupture will be obvious even to the not-so-observant doctor, owing to a pooling of blood in the floor of the mouth. There are also cases inwhich the sublingual hematoma is more obvious and may cause extreme swelling in the floor of the mouth, leading to airway obstruction. This complication, although infre- quent (and rarely associated with trauma), is serious and may necessitate emergency tracheotomy (Ferrari et al., 1962; Teichgräber, Rappaport, and Harris, 1991). It occurs most frequently with the iatrogenic laceration of arteries in the floor of the mouth during implant placement, when the lingual cortical bone of the mandible is accidently perforated. In these cases a rupture of the sublingual mucosa is often not present, thus when heavy bleeding occurs into the confined sublingual space, there is no pressure release for the rapidly increasing volume. 10 Fig. 3.1 A sublingual hematoma in the right premolar region with no other obvious signs of fracture of the mandible. The fracture line is so subtle that it is not evident on panoramic radio- graphs, but only on dental occlusal projection. Our experience combined with the findings of others leads us strongly to suggest that if a hematoma (or even the slightest blueish tinge with no swelling or marginal bleeding) develops post-trauma on the lingual side of the mandible, then a fracture is also present. No matter how small the fracture or how mild the dislocation, the for- mation of the hematoma is the harbinger of an injury that will eventually become evident (Fig. 3.1). 11Sublingual Hematoma: Pathognomic of Fracture of the Mandible 4 Bone Repair and Fracture Healing Franz Haerle Structure of Facial Bone The structure of facial bone is determined by its material properties and by its mechanical role. The bone marrow cavity, the cortex, and the spongiosa of the mandible and the midface are similar in their material composition. Their major difference is in the geometric distribution of the bone. The midfacial skeleton consists of thin laminae that provide an increased surface-area to bone-volume ratio as compared with the mandible. Consequently, the closer proximity of blood vessels provides a superior sup- ply of nutrients and thus promotes an increased healing rate of the midfacial bones. Bone is a dynamic tissue, constantly undergoing re- sorption and remodeling (Schenk, 1992). The cell types of which it is composed consist of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts (Fig. 4.1). Osteoblasts are derived from pluripotential precursor cells. They produce osteoid, the organic matrix of bone, which is transformed into calcified bone. A layer of 1µm of osteoid may be produced per day, followed by a matu- ration phase of 10days before calcification. The microscopic structure of osteoid is different in woven and lamellar bone. In woven bone the collagen fibrils are randomly orientated and have a felted texture. In lamellar bone they are arranged in parallel bundles. Woven bone mineralizes immediately after osteoid de- position. In fracture healing, woven bone is transformed into lamellar bone. 12 Fig. 4.1 Normal bone structure. Osteocytes are derived from osteoblasts. Sometimes osteoblasts can stop producing osteoid. They transform into osteocytes, which are connected with the deeper osteocyte cell layers. The osteocytes lie between the con- centric lamellae. Osteoclasts are multinucleate giant cells derived from mononuclear macrophages. Osteoclasts have a specialized role of bone breakdown. This activity is limited to How- ship lacunae, which are small subcellular chambers with a low pH. The pH is maintained by hydrochloric acid, which dissolves the mineral. The organic matrix is degraded by proteases and collagenases. Osteoclasts are able to resorb 50–100µm of bone per day. Osteons are cylindrical vascular tunnels formed by an osteoclast-rich tissue (haversian canal). They contain plu- ripotential precursor cells and endosteum known as the cutting cone. The bone removed by the cutting cone is replaced by osteoblast-rich tissue, known as the closing cone. This forms concentric layers of lamellar bone which surround the vascular haversian canal. Volkmann canals also contain nutritional vessels arising from the periosteal and endosteal bone surface, which connect with the ha- versian vessels within the osteons (Schenk and Willeneg- ger, 1964). The size of the osteonal transport system is 100µm, which limits the width of an osteon to approx- imately 200µm. The mean width of a lamella is 3–7µm (see Fig. 4.1). The three most important conditions necessary for bone formation and bone mineralization are pluripoten- tial precursor cells, ample blood supply, and mechanical rest (Pauwels, 1940). Fracture Healing There are two types of fracture healing, namely indirect and direct bone healing. Direct bone healing is a syner- gism between contact and gap healing. Indirect bone healing occurs via the pluripotential cells located within the cortical and cancellous bone periosteum and associ- ated soft tissue. Indirect bone healing results from the mechanical instability of the fracture, caused by resorp- tion of fracture ends and callus formation. In the case of direct bone healing, the close apposition of the fracture segments provides mechanical stability. Consequently, the osteons of the fracture end are in direct contact, allowing transverse bridging of the haversian system with no intervening callus formation (Fig. 4.2). Indirect Bone Healing (Secondary Osseous and Soft-Tissue Healing) Bone fracture leads to the rupture of blood vessels with hematoma formation in the surrounding soft tissue and localized avascularity of the fragment ends. Further com- plications are thrombosis of the vessels within the haver- sian and Volkmann canals a fewmillimeters from the ends of fragments (Fig. 4.3). Indirect bone healing occurs via callus formation, as seen in some cases of spontaneous bone healing, with or without direct fixation of the frac- ture site. Several stages of callus formation can be distinguished. Initially, the formation of periosteal callus leads to a de- crease in interfragmentary strain, which is followed by interfragmentary and endosteal callus formation. Invad- ing granulation tissue replaces the initial hematoma and is transformed into interfragmentary connective tissue (Fig. 4.4). The ends of the fragments are resorbed by os- teoclasts (Figs. 4.4, 4.5). The more interfragmentary con- 13Fracture Healing Fig. 4.2 Three windows in a mandib- ular fracture with miniplate osteo- synthesis on the tension side. This shows indirect bone healing in the window on the inferior border of the mandible with the mobile fragment; direct bone healing in the window of the lateral cortex of the mandible by contact healing after perfect and ana- tomical reduction; direct bone healing in the window of the inner cortex of the mandible by gap healing. nective tissue is remodeled into fibrocartilage (Fig. 4.6). Since fibrocartilage is more rigid than fibrous tissue, the interfragmentary tissue becomes stiffer and increases the resistance to motion of the fragments. Subsequently the fibrocartilage undergoes mineralization. Vascular inva- sion of fibrocartilage is combined with resorption of min- eralized matrix. Calcified fibrocartilage must undergo re- sorption before osteoblasts can start to produce osteoid as a base for new bone deposition (Fig. 4.7). Initially the calcified fibrocartilage is replaced by woven bone. After the fracture is bridged by woven bone, stability is ob- tained and function is possible (Philipps and Rahn, 1992). Haversian remodeling proceeds, replacing woven bone with lamellar bone (Fig. 4.8). Direct Bone Healing (Primary Osseous Healing) Direct bone healing was first described in radiographs after perfect anatomical repositioning and stable fixation. Its features are lack of callus formation and disappearance of the fracture lines. Danis (1949) described this as sou- dure autogène (autogenous welding). Callus-free, direct bone healing requires what is often called “stability by interfragmentary compression” (Steinemann, 1983). In the craniomaxillofacial skeleton, interfragmentary com- pression for direct bone healing is not necessary—as dem- onstrated by Ikemura et al. (1984), Ewers and Härle (1983, 1985) experimentally, and by Champy and Lodde (1977) and Kahn and Khouri (1992) clinically. Schenk and 14 4 Bone Repair and Fracture Healing Fig. 4.3 Bone fracture with rupture of blood vessels and hematoma in surrounding soft tissues. Fig. 4.4 Granulation tissue replaces the initial hematoma in the bone fracture, and the ends of the frag- ments will be resorbed by osteo- clasts. Hematoma is shown only in the inferior part of the bone fracture. 15Fracture Healing Fig. 4.5 Granulation tissue will be remodeled into interfragmentary connective tissue. Fig. 4.6 Interfragmentary connec- tive tissue will be remodeled into fibrocartilage. Fig. 4.7 Calcified fibrocartilage must be partially resorbed before osteo- blasts can begin to produce osteoid. Willenegger (1963, 1964) described two different forms of direct bone healing, contact healing and gap healing. Contact healing of the bone means healing of the fracture line after stable anatomical repositioning, with perfect interfragmentary contact and without the possi- bility for any cellular or vascular ingrowth. Cutting cones are able to cross this interface from one fragment to the other by remodeling the haversian canal. Haversian canal remodeling is the main mechanism for restoration of the internal architecture of compact bone (Fig. 4.9). Contact healing takes place over the whole fracture line after perfect anatomical reduction, osteosynthesis, and me- chanical rest (Fig. 4.10). Contact healing is only seen di- rectly beneath the miniplate (see Fig. 4.2). Gap healing takes place in stable or “quiet” gaps with a width greater than the 200-µm osteonal diameter. In- growth of vessels and mesenchymal cells starts after sur- gery. Osteoblasts deposit osteoid on the fragment ends without osteoclastic resorption. The gaps are filled exclu- sively with primarily formed, transversely oriented lamel- lar bone. Replacement is usually completed within 4 to 6 16 4 Bone Repair and Fracture Healing Fig. 4.8 Haversian remodeling begins to reconstruct the lamel- lar direction of the bone. Fig. 4.9 Cutting cones are able to cross the interface from one fragment to the other by remodeling the haversian canal. Fig. 4.10 Perfect anatomical reposi- tioning of a mandibular fracture by lag screw osteosynthesis. weeks (Fig. 4.11). In the second stage, the transversely oriented bone lamellae are replaced by axially orientated osteons, a process which is referred to as haversian re- modeling (Fig. 4.12). After 10 weeks the fracture is re- placed by newly reconstructed cortical bone. Gap healing is seen, for example, on the inner side of the mandible after miniplate osteosynthesis. Gap healing plays an im- portant role in direct bone healing. Gaps are far more extensive than contact areas. Contact areas, on the other hand, are essential for stabilization by interfragmentary friction. Contact areas protect the gaps against deforma- tion. Gap healing is seen far from the plate (see Fig. 4.2). Pseudoarthrosis Pseudoarthrosis describes the nonunion caused by the failure of tissues to differentiate. Tissue differentiation is not possible if, for example, there is movement of the fracture ends due to excessive external forces. In these 17Fracture Healing Fig. 4.11 Osteoblasts deposit os- teoid, and the gaps are filled with primary formation of transversely orientated lamellar bone. Fig. 4.12 Haversian remodeling. Transversely oriented bone lamellae are replaced by axially orientated osteons. cases stabilization is required. When interfragmentary resorption has progressed so far that bony union is not possible, then bone grafting is necessary. Craniomaxillofacial Bone Healing Bone repair and fracture healing to restore original integ- rity (restitutio ad integrum) can be achieved with the use of miniplates and screw fixation to provide direct healing. In the mandible, the plate must be placed at the biome- chanically most favorable site to neutralize the tension forces and torsional moments that cause fracture distrac- tion. Bone plate fixation provides both contact and gap healing. Contact healing is seen adjacent to the plate and between lag-screw osteosynthesis. Gap healing occurs remotely from the plates. A combination of direct and indirect healing also occurs in the maxilla, zygoma, naso-ethmoid and cranium regions following the princi- ples of miniplate osteosynthesis. 18 4 Bone Repair and Fracture Healing 5 Surgical Approaches Franz Haerle Biomechanical Principles The surgeon is encouraged to regain the maximum func- tion of injured skin or mucosa with the least possible deformity and scarring. The ultimate appearance and function of a scar can be predicted by the static and dynamic skin tensions on the surrounding skin (Thacker et al., 1975). Static tension lines exist within the skin and are oriented in specific but variable directions throughout the body. This was first recognized by Dupuytren in 1834. He examined a suicide victim who had sustained three self-inflicted puncture wounds made by an awl. He noted that the skin incisions either gaped apart or remained closed in a consistent way, depending on the direction of the incision and their site on the body. In 1861 Langer examined the skin of cadavers which were lying in a normal anatomical position. He inserted an awl to depths of 2mm and 2.5mm and so identified the direction of predominant tension. These static lines of maximal skin tension are now known as Langer lines (Fig. 5.1). 19 Fig. 5.1 Langer lines were noted after puncturing the skin of cadavers with a sharp awl. (Langer, 1861, Fig. 4.) Extraoral Incision Kocher was the first surgeon to recognize the surgical significance of Langer lines in 1892. He recommended that surgical incisions should be made in such a way as to follow the direction of Langer lines to obtain the best postoperative scars. This recommendation was reinforced by Kraissl (1951). However, Borges and Alexander (1962), while recognizing the importance of Langer lines, dis- puted their biological relevance, since they represented the lines of skin tension following rigor mortis. They observed that in the living body in a relaxed state, skin tension occurred in one specific direction (Fig. 5.2). They called this phenomenon “relaxed skin tension lines” (RSTL). On the face, Borges, Alexander, and Block (1965) distinguished four principal relaxed skin tension line di- rections: · the facial median line · the nasolabial line · the palpebral line · the marginal facial line Borges (1973) recommended that to obtain optimal heal- ing of scars the surgical incision should follow the relaxed skin tension line direction within these areas (Fig. 5.3). Skin tension lines are usually oriented perpendicularly to the underlying muscles (Fig. 5.4). Today, it is generally recognized that the best aesthetic results in the face are obtained if the long axis of the scar lies in the direction of the maximal skin tension (Remmert et al., 1994). Themore closely awound follows the relaxed skin tension lines, the better the cosmetic result. An extraoral approach for mini- or microplate and screw application is rarely used. However, in some cases an extraoral approach (such as the classical submandibu- lar, lower eyelid, upper lid blepharoplasty, brow and co- ronal approaches) is required (Fig. 5.5). When such an approach is used, the facial nerve is potentially at risk and therefore the surgeon must be aware of, and consider, the relevant anatomy (Fig. 5.6). Intraoral Incisions The typical intraoral incision lines for exposure of either the maxilla or the mandible are made within the unat- tached mucosa 4–5mm below the level of the attached gingiva (Figs. 5.7, 5.8). 20 5 Surgical Approaches Fig. 5.2 Borges and Alexander “relaxed skin tension lines” indicate the directional pull that exists in relaxed skin. They can be de- termined by noting the “furrows and ridges” which are formed by pinching the skin (after Albrecht Dürer, Angel Head, 1506, Albertina, Vienna). 21Biomechanical Principles Fig. 5.3 The four principal relaxed skin tension lines. The facial median line, the nasolabial line, the palpebral line, and the marginal facial line (after Albrecht Dürer, Portrait of an 18 year old lad, 1503, Bibliothek der Akademie der Künste, Vienna). Fig. 5.4 Facial skin tension lines and facial muscle lines are usually oriented perpendicularly to muscles. Alternatively, to reduce scar tissue formation and min- imize the risk of infection, the marginal rim incision can be used (see Figs. 5.7, 5.8). To expose the posterior part of the mandible, the incision line is placed directly over the ascending ramus of the mandible. For the edentulous patient the incision line for exposure of the maxilla and the mandible is usually on the crest of the alveolar ridge (Figs. 5.9, 5.10). 22 5 Surgical Approaches Fig. 5.5 Preferred surgical approaches to the facial skeleton (after Albrecht Dürer, St. Apollonia, 1521, Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin). Fig. 5.6 Cross-sectional anatomy of facial soft-tissue layers in relation to the facial nerve and its temporal and marginal man- dibular branches, which are at risk during facial surgery (after Albrecht Dürer, Portrait of a young man, 1500, Bayrische Staatsgemälde- sammlungen, Munich). Mandible Mandible Intraoral Vestibular Approach Depending on the fracture line, an incision is made fol- lowing the oblique line and is continued forward, 4–5mm below the attachment of the mucosa and gingiva. The incision is only carried through themucosa. The following, second incision is made at right angles to the underlying bone and carried down through the submucosa, muscles, and periosteum (Fig. 5.11). Care must be taken to avoid injury to the mental nerve. The nerve has to be identified during the subperiosteal dissection. If exposure of the neurovascular bundle is necessary, an incision has to be made through the periosteum over the mental nerve (Fig. 5.12). After dissection of the neurovascular bundle the mandible can be exposed. The dissection must be performed inferiorly enough to allow adequate applica- tion of the fixation system. The periosteum should be handled with care and should not be elevated excessively. The extension of the incision should not be so small as to prevent wound dehiscences caused by local trauma. The wound can be closed in two layers. The first layer is usually a resorbable, horizontally running mattress su- ture. The second layer is closed in a simple, continuous fashion. When only one suture layer is preferred, the closure should be performed by placing the suture through mucosa, muscles, and periosteum. 23Mandible Fig. 5.7 Intraoral incision for exposure of the maxilla. Usually, this is made in the unattached mucosa 4–5mm below the level of the attached gingiva (dashed line). Alternatively, the marginal rim incision (solid line) can be used. Fig. 5.8 Intraoral incision for exposure of the mandible. Details as in Fig. 5.7. Fig. 5.9 Intraoral incision for exposure of the edentulous max- illa is made on the crest of the alveolar ridge. Fig. 5.10 Intraoral incision for the exposure of the edentulous mandible is made on the crest of the alveolar ridge. Mandible Intraoral Marginal Rim Incision For exposure of the alveolar crest or treatment of trauma- tized teeth, protection of lacerated mucosa is preferred. This can be achieved by using the marginal rim incision, which allows direct elevation of the underlying perios- teum without involving incisions into the overlying mu- cosa, submucosa, muscle, and periosteal layers (Figs. 5.13, 5.14). Wound healing is excellent, without visible scarring (Kreusch, Fleiner, and Steinmann, 1993; Kerscher, Soofi- zadeh, and Kreusch, 1995). Mandible Combined Intraoral–Transbuccal Approach For fixation of screws or plates at the angle of the man- dible it may be necessary to expose the mandible by an intraoral–transbuccal approach. First, the mandible is ex- 24 5 Surgical Approaches Fig. 5.11 Cross-sectional view of the vestibular approach to the mandible. Mucosa, submucosa, muscles, and periosteum are incised.

For transbuccal drilling, tapping, and screw insertion, a stab incision is made through the skin overlying the plate. The incision should follow the RSTL. Next, the transbuccal trocar is inserted and a transbuccal tunnel is established. The trocar is re- moved and a cheek retractor is inserted. Mandible Extraoral Submandibular Approach This incision should be made in a natural skin crease at a level approximately two finger widths below the inferior border of the mandible. Skin and subcutaneous tissue is incised to the level of the platysma muscle, which is incised at right angles to the muscle fibers. The dissection continues superiorly toward the inferior border of the mandible. The marginal mandibular branch of the facial 25Mandible Fig. 5.13 Cross-sectional view of the marginal rim approach to the man- dible. Incision of the mucosa, submu- cosa, muscles, and periosteum is not necessary. Fig. 5.14 Frontal view of the marginal rim approach to the mandible. nerve is closely related and must be identified immedi- ately beneath the platysma muscle. Alternatively, the dis- section can be developed through the deep cervical fascia at the level of the submandibular gland. The capsule of the gland is identified and the overlying facial vein and artery are ligated. The marginal branch of the facial nerve lies superior to these vessels and is therefore not endangered by this approach (Figs. 5.15, 5.16). Eckelt (1991) developed a technique for lag-screw os- teosynthesis of condylar fractures. A skin incision is made 1 cm inferior to the inferior border of the mandible and extended to the level of the platysma muscle. The facial nerve is then identified using a nerve stimulator. The masseter is incised superior to the facial nerve and re- flected inferiorly, which avoids risk of damage to the facial nerve (Figs. 5.17, 5.18). Wilk (1997) developed a technique for rectangular and trapezoidal plates for osteosynthesis of condylar fractures. A skin incision is made 1 cm inferior to the inferior border of the mandible and extended to the level of the platysma 26 5 Surgical Approaches Fig. 5.15 Extraoral submandibular approach.

The facial nerve is then identified using a nerve stimulator. The masseter is incised superior to the facial nerve and reflected superiorly for exposure of the con- dylar fracture (Figs. 5.19, 5.20). 27Mandible Fig. 5.17 The Eckelt approach for exposure of the mandible.

Mid and Upper Face Maxilla Intraoral Vestibular and Marginal Rim Approach As already described for the mandible, exposure of the maxilla can be achieved by either a vestibular or marginal rim incision. In this way the lower half of the midface, including the infraorbital rim, can be exposed. A common complication of the vestibular incision is wound dehis- cence. Such a dehiscence can be avoided with a marginal rim incision, which also offers enhanced healing due to the immunological defense mechanism of the periodon- tium (Schroeder and Page, 1977). Lower Eyelid Approach The lower orbital rim and orbital floor can be exposed transcutaneously through subciliary, lower eyelid, or in- fraorbital incisions. In the transconjunctival approach the incision is limited by the fornix. For more extensive ex- posure a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are necessary. According to Bär et al. (1992), the lower eyelid incision showed the best results with a lower complication rate compared with other approaches. The lower eyelid inci- sion is placed parallel to the ciliary margin at a level just caudal to the tarsus. The orbicularismuscle is exposed and, with blunt dissection in the direction of the muscle fibers, the orbital septum is exposed down to the infraorbital rim. After the orbital rim has been identified, an incision is made from the facial side of the rim, above the infraorbital nerve, through theperiosteum.By subperiosteal dissection the orbital floor and the infraorbital rim will be exposed above the infraorbital nerve (Fig. 5.21).
