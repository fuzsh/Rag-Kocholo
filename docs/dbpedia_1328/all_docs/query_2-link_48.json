We examine local and large-scale dynamics of the Earth's space environment and compare simulation results to in situ data. It is shown that during moderate driving simulation agrees well with the measurements; however, GMHD results should be interpreted cautiously during strong driving.\n\nIMF effect on the polar cap contraction and expansion during a period of substorms\n\nA.

Our experiments show that large-scale erosion patterns and particularly the transformation of valley length geometry from fluvial to glacial conditions are very similar in both models. This finding enables the application of OpenLEM to study the influence of climate and tectonics on glaciated mountains with reasonable computational effort on standard PCs.\n\nA mixed finite-element discretisation of the shallow-water equations\n\nJames Kent, Thomas Melvin, and Golo Albert Wimmer\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1265–1276, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1265-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1265-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces the Met Office's new shallow water model. The shallow water model is a building block towards the Met Office's new atmospheric dynamical core. The shallow water model is tested on a number of standard spherical shallow water test cases, including flow over mountains and unstable jets. Results show that the model produces similar results to other shallow water models in the literature.\n\nMultifidelity Monte Carlo estimation for efficient uncertainty quantification in climate-related modeling\n\nAnthony Gruber, Max Gunzburger, Lili Ju, Rihui Lan, and Zhu Wang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1213–1229, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1213-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1213-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work applies a novel technical tool, multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) estimation, to three climate-related benchmark experiments involving oceanic, atmospheric, and glacial modeling. By considering useful quantities such as maximum sea height and total (kinetic) energy, we show that MFMC leads to predictions which are more accurate and less costly than those obtained by standard methods. This suggests MFMC as a potential drop-in replacement for estimation in realistic climate models.\n\nMassively parallel modeling and inversion of electrical resistivity tomography data using PFLOTRAN\n\nPiyoosh Jaysaval, Glenn E. Hammond, and Timothy C. Johnson\n\nGeosci.

The implementation is publicly available and developed within the framework of PFLOTRAN (http://www.pflotran.org), an open-source, state-of-the-art massively parallel subsurface flow and transport simulation code. The paper details all the theoretical and implementation aspects of the new capabilities along with test examples.\n\nParallelized domain decomposition for multi-dimensional Lagrangian random walk mass-transfer particle tracking schemes\n\nLucas Schauer, Michael J.

For an optimally subdivided diffusion problem, the parallelized algorithm achieves nearly perfect linear speedup in comparison with the serial run-up to thousands of cores.\n\nThe Intelligent Prospector v1.0: geoscientific model development and prediction by sequential data acquisition planning with application to mineral exploration\n\nJohn Mern and Jef Caers\n\nGeosci.

Solutions to these problems are given in AI and rarely used in geoscientific data planning. We illustrate our approach to a simple 2D problem of mineral exploration.\n\nPredicting peak daily maximum 8 h ozone and linkages to emissions and meteorology in Southern California using machine learning methods (SoCAB-8HR V1.0)\n\nZiqi Gao, Yifeng Wang, Petros Vasilakos, Cesunica E. Ivey, Khanh Do, and Armistead G. Russell\n\nGeosci.

We built four computational models (GAM, MARS, random forest and SVR) to predict the fourth highest MDA8 ozone in Southern California using precursor emissions, meteorology and climatological patterns. All models presented acceptable performance, with GAM being the best.\n\nTransfer learning for landslide susceptibility modeling using domain adaptation and case-based reasoning\n\nZhihao Wang, Jason Goetz, and Alexander Brenning\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8765–8784, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8765-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8765-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA lack of inventory data can be a limiting factor in developing landslide predictive models, which are crucial for supporting hazard policy and decision-making. We show how case-based reasoning and domain adaptation (transfer-learning techniques) can effectively retrieve similar landslide modeling situations for prediction in new data-scarce areas. Using cases in Italy, Austria, and Ecuador, our findings support the application of transfer learning for areas that require rapid model development.\n\nISMIP-HOM benchmark experiments using Underworld\n\nTill Sachau, Haibin Yang, Justin Lang, Paul D.

These structures are an essential indication of the flow behavior and dynamics of ice transport, which in turn is important for understanding the actual impact of the vast amounts of water trapped in continental ice sheets on global sea-level rise. The software studied here is specifically designed to simulate such structures and their evolution.\n\nspyro: a Firedrake-based wave propagation and full-waveform-inversion finite-element solver\n\nKeith J.

To reduce those costs, novel software is presented allowing the use of high-order mass-lumped FEMs on triangular meshes, together with a material-property mesh-adaptation performance-enhancing strategy, enabling its use in FWIs.\n\nSpatial filtering in a 6D hybrid-Vlasov scheme to alleviate adaptive mesh refinement artifacts: a case study with Vlasiator (versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2.1)\n\nKonstantinos Papadakis, Yann Pfau-Kempf, Urs Ganse, Markus Battarbee, Markku Alho, Maxime Grandin, Maxime Dubart, Lucile Turc, Hongyang Zhou, Konstantinos Horaites, Ivan Zaitsev, Giulia Cozzani, Maarja Bussov, Evgeny Gordeev, Fasil Tesema, Harriet George, Jonas Suni, Vertti Tarvus, and Minna Palmroth\n\nGeosci.

As 6D simulations require enormous amounts of computational resources, Vlasiator uses adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to lighten the computational burden. However, due to Vlasiatorâs grid topology, AMR simulations suffer from grid aliasing artifacts that affect the global results. In this work, we present and evaluate the performance of a mechanism for alleviating those artifacts.\n\nA Bayesian data assimilation framework for lake 3D hydrodynamic models with a physics-preserving particle filtering method using SPUX-MITgcm v1\n\nArtur Safin, Damien Bouffard, Firat Ozdemir, Cintia L.

In this paper, we investigate the viability of a novel approach to the calibration of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Geneva, where the target parameters are inferred in terms of distributions. We employ a filtering technique that generates physically consistent model trajectories and implement a neural network to enable bulk-to-skin temperature conversion.\n\nA fast, single-iteration ensemble Kalman smoother for sequential data assimilation\n\nColin Grudzien and Marc Bocquet\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 7641–7681, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7641-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7641-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIterative optimization techniques, the state of the art in data assimilation, have largely focused on extending forecast accuracy to moderate- to long-range forecast systems. However, current methodology may not be cost-effective in reducing forecast errors in online, short-range forecast systems. We propose a novel optimization of these techniques for online, short-range forecast cycles, simultaneously providing an improvement in forecast accuracy and a reduction in the computational cost.\n\nStrategies for Conservative and Non-Conservative Monotone Remapping on the Sphere\n\nDavid H. Marsico and Paul A. Ullrich\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-248,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-248, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models involve several different components, such as the atmosphere, ocean, and land models. Information needs to be exchanged, or remapped, between these models, and devising algorithms for performing this exchange is important for ensuring the accuracy of climate simulations. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of several traditional and novel approaches to remapping on the sphere and demonstrate where our approaches offer improvement.\n\nCharacterizing uncertainties of Earth system modeling with heterogeneous many-core architecture computing\n\nYangyang Yu, Shaoqing Zhang, Haohuan Fu, Lixin Wu, Dexun Chen, Yang Gao, Zhiqiang Wei, Dongning Jia, and Xiaopei Lin\n\nGeosci.

A series of comparisons of the PDFs between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems show consistently acceptable error tolerances when using slave cores in heterogeneous computing environments.\n\nMetrics for Intercomparison of Remapping Algorithms (MIRA) protocol applied to Earth system models\n\nVijay S. Mahadevan, Jorge E. Guerra, Xiangmin Jiao, Paul Kuberry, Yipeng Li, Paul Ullrich, David Marsico, Robert Jacob, Pavel Bochev, and Philip Jones\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 6601–6635, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6601-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6601-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoupled Earth system models require transfer of field data between multiple components with varying spatial resolutions to determine the correct climate behavior. We present the Metrics for Intercomparison of Remapping Algorithms (MIRA) protocol to evaluate the accuracy, conservation properties, monotonicity, and local feature preservation of four different remapper algorithms for various unstructured mesh problems of interest. Future extensions to more practical use cases are also discussed.\n\nImpact of the numerical solution approach of a plant hydrodynamic model (v0.1) on vegetation dynamics\n\nYilin Fang, L.

We implemented different numerical approaches for a plant hydrodynamic model and compared their impacts on the simulated aboveground biomass (AGB) at single points and globally. We found care should be taken when discretizing the number of soil layers for numerical simulations as it can significantly affect AGB if accuracy and computational costs are of concern.\n\nIslet: interpolation semi-Lagrangian element-based transport\n\nAndrew M. Bradley, Peter A. Bosler, and Oksana Guba\n\nGeosci.

We describe a flexible and efficient interpolation semi-Lagrangian method, the Islet method. It permits using up to three grids that share an element grid: a dynamics grid for computing quantities such as the wind velocity; a physics parameterizations grid; and a tracer grid. The Islet method performs well on a number of verification problems and achieves high performance in the E3SM Atmosphere Model version 2.\n\nMulti-dimensional hydrologicalâhydraulic model with variational data assimilation for river networks and floodplains\n\nLÃ©o Pujol, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and JÃ©rÃ´me Monnier\n\nGeosci.

It allows modeling large areas at a low computational cost, with fine zooms where needed. It allows the integration of local and satellite measurements, via data assimilation methods, to improve the model's match to observations. Using this capability, good matches to in situ observations are obtained on a model of the complex Adour river network with fine zooms on floodplains.\n\nAssessing the robustness and scalability of the accelerated pseudo-transient method\n\nLudovic RÃ¤ss, Ivan Utkin, Thibault Duretz, Samuel Omlin, and Yuri Y. Podladchikov\n\nGeosci.

We present a suite of numerical algorithms, implemented using the Julia language, that efficiently leverages the parallelism. We demonstrate that our implementation is efficient, scalable and robust and showcase applications to various geophysical problems.\n\nFast Barnes Interpolation\n\nBruno K. ZÃ¼rcher\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-116,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-116, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a novel algorithm to efficiently compute Barnes interpolation, which is a method for transforming data values recorded at irregularly spaced points into a corresponding regular grid. In contrast to naive implementations that have an algorithmic complexity that depends directly on both the number of sample points and the grid size, our approach reduces this dependency essentially to the number of grid points.\n\nAssessment of stochastic weather forecast of precipitation near European cities, based on analogs of circulation\n\nMeriem Krouma, Pascal Yiou, CÃ©line DÃ©andreis, and Soulivanh Thao\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 4941–4958, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4941-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4941-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated the skill of a stochastic weather generator (SWG) to forecast precipitation at different time scales and in different areas of western Europe from analogs of Z500 hPa. The SWG has the skill to simulate precipitation for 5 and 10 d. We found that forecast weaknesses can be associated with specific weather patterns. The comparison with ECMWF forecasts confirms the skill of our model. This work is important because it provides information about weather forecasts over specific areas.\n\nUniversity of Warsaw Lagrangian Cloud Model (UWLCM) 2.0: adaptation of a mixed EulerianâLagrangian numerical model for heterogeneous computing clusters\n\nPiotr Dziekan and Piotr Zmijewski\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 4489–4501, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4489-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4489-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetailed computer simulations of clouds are important for understanding Earth's atmosphere and climate. The paper describes how the UWLCM has been adapted to work on supercomputers. A distinctive feature of UWLCM is that air flow is calculated by processors at the same time as cloud droplets are modeled by graphics cards. Thanks to this, use of computing resources is maximized and the time to complete simulations of large domains is not affected by communications between supercomputer nodes.\n\nPrediction error growth in a more realistic atmospheric toy model with three spatiotemporal scales\n\nHynek BednÃ¡Å and Holger Kantz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 4147–4161, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4147-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4147-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA scale-dependent error growth described by a power law or by a quadratic hypothesis is studied in Lorenzâs system with three spatiotemporal levels. The validity of power law is extended by including a saturation effect. The quadratic hypothesis can only serve as a first guess. In addition, we study the initial error growth for the ECMWF forecast system. Fitting the parameters, we conclude that there is an intrinsic limit of predictability after 22 days.\n\nOn numerical broadening of particle-size spectra: a condensational growth study using PyMPDATA 1.0\n\nMichael A. Olesik, Jakub BanaÅkiewicz, Piotr Bartman, Manuel Baumgartner, Simon Unterstrasser, and Sylwester Arabas\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3879–3899, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3879-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3879-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn systems such as atmospheric clouds, droplets undergo growth through condensation of vapor. The broadness of the resultant size spectrum of droplets influences precipitation likelihood and the radiative properties of clouds. One of the inherent limitations of simulations of the problem is the so-called numerical diffusion causing overestimation of the spectrum width, hence the term numerical broadening. In the paper, we take a closer look at one of the algorithms used in this context: MPDATA.\n\nLossy checkpoint compression in full waveform inversion: a case study with ZFPv0.5.5 and the overthrust model\n\nNavjot Kukreja, Jan HÃ¼ckelheim, Mathias Louboutin, John Washbourne, Paul H. J. Kelly, and Gerard J. Gorman\n\nGeosci.

In this paper we present a method that combines recomputation with lossy compression to accelerate the computation with minimal loss of precision in the results. We show this using experiments running FWI with a variety of compression settings on a popular academic dataset.\n\nBlockworldsÂ 0.1.0: a demonstration of anti-aliased geophysics for probabilistic inversions of implicit and kinematic geological models\n\nRichard Scalzo, Mark Lindsay, Mark Jessell, Guillaume Pirot, Jeremie Giraud, Edward Cripps, and Sally Cripps\n\nGeosci.

Our method ensures that small changes in simulated geological features, such as the position of a boundary between two rock layers, do not result in unrealistically large changes to resulting sensor measurements, as occur presently using several popular modeling packages.\n\nEfficient high-dimensional variational data assimilation with machine-learned reduced-order models\n\nRomit Maulik, Vishwas Rao, Jiali Wang, Gianmarco Mengaldo, Emil Constantinescu, Bethany Lusch, Prasanna Balaprakash, Ian Foster, and Rao Kotamarthi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3433–3445, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3433-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3433-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn numerical weather prediction, data assimilation is frequently utilized to enhance the accuracy of forecasts from equation-based models. In this work we use a machine learning framework that approximates a complex dynamical system given by the geopotential height. Instead of using an equation-based model, we utilize this machine-learned alternative to dramatically accelerate both the forecast and the assimilation of data, thereby reducing need for large computational resources.\n\nImproved double Fourier series on a sphere and its application to a semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian shallow-water model\n\nHiromasa Yoshimura\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2561–2597, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2561-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2561-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper proposes a new double Fourier series (DFS) method on a sphere that improves the numerical stability of a model compared with conventional DFS methods. The shallow-water model and the advection model using the new DFS method give stable results without the appearance of high-wavenumber noise near the poles. The model using the new DFS method is faster than the model using spherical harmonics (especially at high resolutions) and gives almost the same results.\n\nSciKit-GStat 1.0: a SciPy-flavored geostatistical variogram estimation toolbox written in Python\n\nMirko MÃ¤licke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2505–2532, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2505-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2505-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nI preset SciKit-GStat, a well-documented and tested Python package for variogram estimation. The variogram is the core means of geostatistics, which almost all other methods rely on. Geostatistical interpolation and field generation are widely spread in geoscience, i.e., for data assimilation or modeling. While SciKit-GStat focuses on effective and intuitive variogram estimation, it can interface with other prominent packages and make its variograms available for a multitude of methods.\n\nFlow-Py v1.0: a customizable, open-source simulation tool to estimate runout and intensity of gravitational mass flows\n\nChristopher J.

Here we present the open-source GMF simulation tool Flow-Py. The model equations are based on simple geometrical relations in three-dimensional terrain. We show that Flow-Py is an educational, innovative GMF simulation tool with three computational experiments: 1. validation of implementation, 2. performance, and 3. expandability.\n\nEmulation of high-resolution land surface models using sparse Gaussian processes with application to JULES\n\nEvan Baker, Anna B.

The model was trained using data from a very complex land surface model called JULES. Our model is faster at producing simulations and predictions and can investigate many different scenarios, which can be used to improve our understanding of the climate and could also be used to help make local decisions.\n\nA three-dimensional variational data assimilation system for aerosol optical properties based on WRF-Chem v4.0: design, development, and application of assimilating Himawari-8 aerosol observations\n\nDaichun Wang, Wei You, Zengliang Zang, Xiaobin Pan, Yiwen Hu, and Yanfei Liang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1821–1840, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1821-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1821-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a 3D variational data assimilation system for aerosol optical properties, including aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrievals and lidar-based aerosol profiles, which was developed for a size-resolved sectional model in WRF-Chem. To directly assimilate aerosol optical properties, an observation operator based on the Mie scattering theory was designed. The results show that Himawari-8 AOT assimilation can significantly improve model aerosol analyses and forecasts.\n\nImplementation of a Gaussian Markov random field sampler for forward uncertainty quantification in the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model v4.19\n\nKevin Bulthuis and Eric Larour\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1195–1217, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1195-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1195-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present and implement a stochastic solver to sample spatially and temporal varying uncertain input parameters in the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model, such as ice thickness or surface mass balance. We represent these sources of uncertainty using Gaussian random fields with Matérn covariance function. We generate random samples of this random field using an efficient computational approach based on solving a stochastic partial differential equation.\n\nA method for assessment of the general circulation model quality using the K-means clustering algorithm: a case study with GETM v2.5\n\nUrmas Raudsepp and Ilja Maljutenko\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 535–551, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-535-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-535-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA model's ability to reproduce the state of a simulated object is always a subject of discussion. A new method for the multivariate assessment of numerical model skills uses the K-means algorithm for clustering model errors. All available data that fall into the model domain and simulation period are incorporated into the skill assessment. The clustered errors are used for spatial and temporal analysis of the model accuracy. The method can be applied to different types of geoscientific models.\n\nAn explicit GPU-based material point method solver for elastoplastic problems (ep2-3De v1.0)\n\nEmmanuel Wyser, Yury Alkhimenkov, Michel Jaboyedoff, and Yury Y. Podladchikov\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7749–7774, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7749-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7749-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose an implementation of the material point method using graphical processing units (GPUs) to solve elastoplastic problems in three-dimensional configurations, such as the granular collapse or the slumping mechanics, i.e., landslide. The computational power of GPUs promotes fast code executions, compared to a traditional implementation using central processing units (CPUs). This allows us to study complex three-dimensional problems tackling high spatial resolution.\n\nMagIC v5.10: a two-dimensional message-passing interface (MPI) distribution for pseudo-spectral magnetohydrodynamics simulations in spherical geometry\n\nRafael Lago, Thomas Gastine, Tilman Dannert, Markus Rampp, and Johannes Wicht\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7477–7495, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7477-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7477-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work we discuss a two-dimensional distributed parallelization of MagIC, an open-source code for the numerical solution of the magnetohydrodynamics equations. Such a parallelization involves several challenges concerning the distribution of work and data. We detail our algorithm and compare it with the established, optimized, one-dimensional distribution in the context of the dynamo benchmark and discuss the merits of both implementations.\n\nMachine-learning models to replicate large-eddy simulations of air pollutant concentrations along boulevard-type streets\n\nMoritz Lange, Henri Suominen, Mona Kurppa, Leena JÃ¤rvi, Emilia Oikarinen, Rafael Savvides, and Kai PuolamÃ¤ki\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7411–7424, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7411-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7411-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study aims to replicate computationally expensive high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LESs) with regression models to simulate urban air quality and pollutant dispersion. The model development, including feature selection, model training and cross-validation, and detection of concept drift, has been described in detail. Of the models applied, log-linear regression shows the best performance. A regression model can replace LES unless high accuracy is needed.\n\nRecalculation of error growth models' parameters for the ECMWF forecast system\n\nHynek BednÃ¡Å, AleÅ¡ Raidl, and JiÅÃ­ MikÅ¡ovskÃ½\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7377–7389, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7377-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7377-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForecast errors in numerical weather prediction systems grow in time. To quantify the impacts of this growth, parametric error growth models may be employed. This study recalculates and newly defines parameters for several statistic models approximating error growth in the ECMWF forecasting system. Accurate values of parameters are important because they are used to evaluate improvements of the forecasting systems or to estimate predictability.\n\nHow biased are our models? â a case study of the alpine region\n\nDenise Degen, Cameron Spooner, Magdalena Scheck-Wenderoth, and Mauro Cacace\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7133–7153, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7133-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7133-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn times of worldwide energy transitions, an understanding of the subsurface is increasingly important to provide renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy. To validate our understanding of the subsurface we require data. However, the data are usually not distributed equally and introduce a potential misinterpretation of the subsurface. Therefore, in this study we investigate the influence of measurements on temperature distribution in the European Alps.\n\nB-flood 1.0: an open-source Saint-Venant model for flash-flood simulation using adaptive refinement\n\nGeoffroy Kirstetter, Olivier Delestre, Pierre-Yves LagrÃ©e, StÃ©phane Popinet, and Christophe Josserand\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7117–7132, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7117-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7117-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe development of forecasting tools may help to limit the impacts of flash floods. Our purpose here is to demonstrate the possibility of using b-flood, which is a 2D tool based on shallow-water equations and adaptive mesh refinement.\n\nA micro-genetic algorithm (GA v1.7.1a) for combinatorial optimization of physics parameterizations in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (v4.0.3) for quantitative precipitation forecast in Korea\n\nSojung Park and Seon K. Park\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 6241–6255, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6241-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6241-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOne of the biggest uncertainties in numerical weather predictions (NWPs) comes from treating subgrid-scale physical processes. Physical processes, such as cumulus, microphysics, and planetary boundary layer processes, are parameterized in NWP models by empirical and theoretical backgrounds. We developed an interface between a micro-genetic algorithm and the WRF model for a combinatorial optimization of physics for heavy rainfall events in Korea. The system improved precipitation forecasts.\n\nSymPKF (v1.0): a symbolic and computational toolbox for the design of parametric Kalman filter dynamics\n\nOlivier Pannekoucke and Philippe Arbogast\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5957–5976, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5957-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5957-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis contributes to research on uncertainty prediction, which is important either for determining the weather today or estimating the risk in prediction. The problem is that uncertainty prediction is numerically very expensive. An alternative has been proposed wherein uncertainty is presented in a simplified form with only the dynamics of certain parameters required. This tool allows for the determination of the symbolic equations of these parameter dynamics and their numerical computation.\n\nNDCmitiQÂ v1.0.0: a tool to quantify and analyse greenhouse gas mitigation targets\n\nAnnika GÃ¼nther, Johannes GÃ¼tschow, and Mairi Louise Jeffery\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5695–5730, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5695-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5695-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe mitigation components of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement are essential in our fight against climate change. Regular updates with increased ambition are requested to limit global warming to 1.5–2 Â°C. The new and easy-to-update open-source tool NDCmitiQ can be used to quantify the NDCs' mitigation targets and construct resulting emissions pathways. In use cases, we show target uncertainties from missing clarity, data, and methodological challenges.\n\nCombining ensemble Kalman filter and reservoir computing to predict spatiotemporal chaotic systems from imperfect observations and models\n\nFuto Tomizawa and Yohei Sawada\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5623–5635, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5623-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5623-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new method to predict chaotic systems from observation and process-based models is proposed by combining machine learning with data assimilation. Our method is robust to the sparsity of observation networks and can predict more accurately than a process-based model when it is biased. Our method effectively works when both observations and models are imperfect, which is often the case in geoscience. Therefore, our method is useful to solve a wide variety of prediction problems in this field.\n\nThe Coastline Evolution Model 2D (CEM2D) V1.1\n\nChloe Leach, Tom Coulthard, Andrew Barkwith, Daniel R. Parsons, and Susan Manson\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5507–5523, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5507-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5507-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerical models can be used to understand how coastal systems evolve over time, including likely responses to climate change. However, many existing models are aimed at simulating 10- to 100-year time periods do not represent a vertical dimension and are thus unable to include the effect of sea-level rise. The Coastline Evolution Model 2D (CEM2D) presented in this paper is an advance in this field, with the inclusion of the vertical coastal profile against which the water level can be altered.\n\nAn iterative process for efficient optimisation of parameters in geoscientific models: a demonstration using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) version 0.7.3\n\nSteven J. Phipps, Jason L. Roberts, and Matt A. King\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5107–5124, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5107-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5107-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimplified schemes, known as parameterisations, are sometimes used to describe physical processes within numerical models. However, the values of the parameters are uncertain. This introduces uncertainty into the model outputs. We develop a simple approach to identify plausible ranges for model parameters. Using a model of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, we find that the value of one parameter can depend on the values of others. We conclude that a single optimal set of parameter values does not exist.\n\nOcean Plastic Assimilator v0.2: assimilation of plastic concentration data into Lagrangian dispersion models\n\nAxel Peytavin, Bruno Sainte-Rose, Gael Forget, and Jean-Michel Campin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 4769–4780, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4769-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4769-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new algorithm developed at The Ocean Cleanup to update ocean plastic models based on measurements from the field to improve future cleaning operations. Prepared in collaboration with MIT researchers, this initial study presents its use in several analytical and real test cases in which two observers in a flow field record regular observations to update a plastic forecast. We demonstrate this improves the prediction, even with inaccurate knowledge of the water flows driving plastic.\n\nDevelopment of a moving point source model for shipping emission dispersion modeling in EPISODEâCityChem v1.3\n\nKang Pan, Mei Qi Lim, Markus Kraft, and Epaminondas Mastorakos\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 4509–4534, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4509-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4509-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new moving point source (MPS) model was developed to simulate the dispersion of emissions generated by the moving ships. Compared to the commonly used line source (LS) or fixed point source (FPS) model, the MPS model provides more emission distribution details generated by the moving ships and matches reasonably with the measurements. Therefore, the MPS model should be a valuable alternative for the environmental society to evaluate the pollutant dispersion contributed from the moving ships.\n\nEfficient Bayesian inference for large chaotic dynamical systems\n\nSebastian Springer, Heikki Haario, Jouni Susiluoto, Aleksandr Bibov, Andrew Davis, and Youssef Marzouk\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 4319–4333, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4319-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4319-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModel predictions always contain uncertainty. But in some cases, such as weather forecasting or climate modeling, chaotic unpredictability increases the difficulty to say exactly how much uncertainty there is. We combine two recently proposed mathematical methods to show how the uncertainty can be analyzed in models that are simplifications of true weather models. The results can be extended in the future to show how forecasts from large-scale models can be improved.\n\nCited articles\n\nDenning, P.
