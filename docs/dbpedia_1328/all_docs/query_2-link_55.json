        "text": "ann24011 — Announcement\n\nESO signs contract for the ELT’s M5 commissioning mirror\n\n28 June 2024: Today, ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) has taken another step towards timely completion. At ESO’s Headquarters in Garching, Germany, and with remote participation from the UK, the organisation signed a contract with Glyndwr Innovations Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wrexham University) in Wales, UK, for the production of the ELT’s M5 commissioning mirror. In case of delays in producing M5, this commissioning mirror will be used as the fifth mirror of the ELT’s innovative five-mirror design when the telescope sees first light. The M5 mirror is a crucial part of the ELT’s adaptive-optics system design: it will adjust its position up to 10 times per second without bending to allow the telescope to obtain the sharpest possible images. Like the rest of the ELT, M5 is pushing technology to its limits: at 2.7 by 2.2 metres, it is the largest tip-tilt mirror ever produced. It is made from silicon carbide, ...\n\nannlang24004-es-cl-en — Announcement\n\nPresident of Chile visits ESO Headquarters\n\n13 June 2024: Yesterday, Chilean President Gabriel Boric visited the ESO Headquarters in Garching bei München, Germany.

The visit provided an opportunity for ESO and Chile to review the close relationship developed over 60 years of collaboration and discuss ways of strengthening it. ESO develops its telescopes and instruments in Europe, in strong collaboration with industry and R&D institutions, and operates them at unique observing sites in the Chilean Atacama Desert, which has generated unique opportunities for Chilean academia, companies and society. Following a welcome by the ...\n\nannlang24003-es-cl-en — Announcement\n\nJoint Committee ESO-Government of Chile opens its national call for proposals for 2024\n\n10 June 2024: The Joint Committee ESO-Government of Chile has opened applications for its national financing fund for the period 2024, which will award over 550 million Chilean pesos. The skies in the northern part of the country offer some of the best conditions in the world for astronomical observation. This is why, for over 60 years, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) has designed, built, and operated observatories in the north of Chile. La Silla, Paranal, ALMA and the future Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) are part of ESO’s infrastructure, making it the foremost organisation for ground-based astronomical observation. To enhance scientific and technological development through astronomy, since 1995 ESO and the Government of Chile have funded projects that foster astronomical research, training of highly skilled personnel, the development of technologies, and science education and outreach. ESO provides and manages this annual fund as part of the scientific cooperation programme with its host country, ...\n\nann24010 — Announcement\n\nESO signs agreement for ANDES instrument on the ELT\n\n5 June 2024: Today, ESO has signed an agreement with an international consortium of institutions for the design and construction of ANDES, the ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph. The ANDES instrument will be installed on ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). It will be used to search for signs of life in exoplanets and look for the very first stars, as well as to test variations of the fundamental constants of physics and measure the acceleration of the Universe’s expansion. The agreement was signed by ESO’s Director General, Xavier Barcons, and by Roberto Ragazzoni, the President of Italy’s National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the institution leading the ANDES consortium. Also attending the signing ceremony were Sergio Maffettone, Consul General of Italy in Munich, and INAF’s Alessandro Marconi, ANDES Principal Investigator, in addition to other representatives from ESO, INAF, the ANDES consortium and the Consulate of Italy in Munich. The signing took place at the ...\n\nann24009 — Announcement\n\nESO network affected by cyber incident\n\n21 May 2024: Update The ESO and ALMA Science Archives are back online. Starting on Friday 17 May, several of ESO’s network and communication services were shut down to allow for an important software upgrade to be deployed. The upgrade is being done in response to a cyber security incident. In addition to the shutdown, mitigating this threat included limiting communications regarding the incident to avoid compromising ESO’s cyber security response plan. As of Tuesday 21 May, email services have been restored and the ESO website is back online. Other services, such as the ESO and ALMA Science Archives, are expected to be restored in the coming days. ESO’s IT team is working together with a cyber security consultant on detecting and clearing malicious software from all ESO’s machines, as well as on investigating the attack and its consequences. Should any of our stakeholders be found to be affected, they will be informed ...\n\nann24008 — Announcement\n\nThe ELT's M5 mirror blank is finalised\n\n15 May 2024: M5, the fifth mirror on the light path of ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), has reached an important milestone: its blank, the shaped piece of material that is later polished to become the mirror, has just been finalised. The ELT will be equipped with five mirrors in total, and M5 is the smallest of them — but building its blank was no small feat. The French company Mersen Boostec manufactured this remarkable piece in their facilities near Tarbes, in France’s southwest. M5 is a flat, elliptical mirror measuring 2.7 by 2.2 metres, constructed from six segments brazed together. It might not seem much in comparison to the ELT’s enormous 39-metre primary mirror, but in reality, it is the largest tip-tilt mirror in the world. Together with M4, M5 is a crucial component of the ELT’s adaptive optics system: their unique synergy will allow the ELT to take extremely sharp images, ...\n\nann24007 — Announcement\n\nFinal design of the ELT's METIS instrument completed\n\n14 May 2024: The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph, or METIS, has passed its Final Design Review, with ESO now giving the go-ahead on the manufacturing of all instrument components. METIS is a sophisticated multi-tool instrument that will operate on ESO’s upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). It is the first of the ELT instruments to formally pass its Final Design Review, marking an important step for the METIS consortium, the ELT project, and the instrument-building community. METIS is a first-generation instrument on the world’s biggest eye on the sky, the ELT, meaning it will start operating when or shortly after the telescope itself starts observing the skies. It has a broad range of science goals, from probing the formation history of our Solar System to peering into the centre of galaxies, to studying their enigmatic supermassive black holes. The main scientific focus of METIS is on the study of planet-forming discs, and recently ...\n\nann24006 — Announcement\n\nLooking for tsunami clues in the skies above Paranal with OASIS\n\n30 April 2024: As part of a collaboration between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and ESO, the Observations of Airglow with Spectrometer and Imager Systems (OASIS) project has officially joined the ranks of ESO’s Paranal Observatory. Best known for hosting world-leading astronomical observatories, like ESO’s Very Large Telescope, Paranal also happens to be ideally suited for certain atmospheric observations. Operated by DLR and hosted by ESO, OASIS aims to show that monitoring “airglow” in our atmosphere has potential to provide early warnings for tsunamis. Tsunamis, giant waves caused mostly by earthquakes under the sea, are a destructive force of nature that can result in a significant loss of life and damage to infrastructure. OASIS aims to show that it is possible to mitigate some of the impacts of these natural hazards by monitoring our atmosphere. Earthquakes generate sound waves that travel upwards through the atmosphere. These perturbations affect the so-called airglow or nightglow ...\n\nannlang24002-es-cl-en — Announcement\n\nUN Women Executive Director Visits ESO in Chile and Reinforces STEM Collaboration\n\n29 April 2024: On Monday, April 29th, a delegation from UN Women, an organisation dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, visited the European Southern Observatory (ESO) offices in Santiago, Chile, to further advance the inclusion of women in astronomical observatories and Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The delegation, headed by Sima Sami Bahous, UN Women's Executive Director, and María Noel Vaeza, UN Women's Regional Director for the Americas and the Caribbean, was received by Bárbara Nuñez, ESO Regional Relations Officer and Luis Chavarría, ESO Representative in Chile.

The visitors were hosted by ESO Director General, Xavier Barcons, and ESO’s ‎Head of the Executive Office of the Director General & Head of Legal and Institutional Affairs, Laura Comendador Frutos. Following an opening presentation about ESO’s value chain and its societal impact by ...\n\nann24005 — Announcement\n\nFirst segments of world’s largest telescope mirror have a shiny new surface\n\n14 March 2024: The construction of ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) in the Chilean Atacama Desert has reached a new milestone: a team at ESO’s Paranal Observatory have added a reflective, shiny layer, as well as special sensors, to the first segments of the telescope’s primary mirror. This “coating” means the segments are now essentially ready to start observing the skies, once installed at the heart of the world’s largest optical telescope later this decade. The 39-metre primary mirror of ESO’s ELT, known as M1, will be by far the largest mirror ever made for a telescope. Too large to be made from a single piece of glass, it will consist of 798 glass-ceramic hexagonal segments, each about five centimetres thick and 1.5 metres across. The mirror segments are manufactured in Europe in a multi-step, multinational process.
