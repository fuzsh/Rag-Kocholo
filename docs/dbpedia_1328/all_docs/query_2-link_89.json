Currently, there is little evidence that wild animals can acquire resistance to these pathogens. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a pathogenic fungus implicated in the recent global decline of amphibians. Here we demonstrate that three species of amphibians can acquire behavioural or immunological resistance to B. dendrobatidis. Frogs learned to avoid the fungus after just one B. dendrobatidis exposure and temperature-induced clearance. In subsequent experiments in which B. dendrobatidis avoidance was prevented, the number of previous exposures was a negative predictor of B. dendrobatidis burden on frogs and B. dendrobatidis-induced mortality, and was a positive predictor of lymphocyte abundance and proliferation. These results suggest that amphibians can acquire immunity to B. dendrobatidis that overcomes pathogen-induced immunosuppression and increases their survival. Importantly, exposure to dead fungus induced a similar magnitude of acquired resistance as exposure to live fungus. Exposure of frogs to B. dendrobatidis antigens might offer a practical way to protect pathogen-naive amphibians and facilitate the reintroduction of amphibians to locations in the wild where B. dendrobatidis persists. Moreover, given the conserved nature of vertebrate immune responses to fungi and the fact that many animals are capable of learning to avoid natural enemies, these results offer hope that other wild animal taxa threatened by invasive fungi might be rescued by management approaches based on herd immunity.\n\nOvercoming acquired drug resistance in colorectal cancer cells by targeted delivery of 5-FU with EGF grafted hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Lijue; She, Xiaodong; Wang, Tao; He, Li; Shigdar, Sarah; Duan, Wei; Kong, Lingxue\n\n2015-08-01\n\nAcquired drug resistance (ADR) can be developed in colorectal cancer cells after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and diminish the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In this work, acquired 5-FU resistance in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480 was obtained with the up-regulation of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene expression which can convert 5-FU to its inactive metabolite. To overcome ADR in colorectal cancer, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) grafted with epidermal growth factor (EGF) were used as nanocarriers to deliver 5-FU to colorectal cancer cells with acquired drug resistance. The effect and mechanism of 5-FU loaded EGF grafted HMSNs (EGF-HMSNs-5-FU) in overcoming acquired drug resistance in SW480/ADR cells were studied. The EGF-HMSNs were demonstrated to be specifically internalized in EGFR overexpressed SW480/ADR cells via a receptor-mediated endocytosis and can escape from endo-lysosomes. The EGF-HMSNs-5-FU exhibited much higher cytotoxicity on SW480/ADR cells than HMSNs-5-FU and free 5-FU while the plain HMSNs did not show significant cytotoxicity. The mechanism of EGF-HMSNs-5-FU in overcoming drug resistance in SW480/ADR cells could be attributed to the specific internalization of EGF-HMSNs-5-FU in EGFR overexpressed cells which can lead to high intracellular drug accumulation and cause cell death through S phase arrest.Acquired drug resistance (ADR) can be developed in colorectal cancer cells after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and diminish the effectiveness of chemotherapy.

The\n\nInhibition of BMP signaling overcomes acquired resistance to cetuximab in oral squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nYin, Jinlong; Jung, Ji-Eun; Choi, Sun Il; Kim, Sung Soo; Oh, Young Taek; Kim, Tae-Hoon; Choi, Eunji; Lee, Sun Joo; Kim, Hana; Kim, Eun Ok; Lee, Yu Sun; Chang, Hee Jin; Park, Joo Yong; Kim, Yeejeong; Yun, Tak; Heo, Kyun; Kim, Youn-Jae; Kim, Hyunggee; Kim, Yun-Hee; Park, Jong Bae; Choi, Sung Weon\n\n2018-02-01\n\nDespite expressing high levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a majority of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients show limited response to cetuximab and ultimately develop drug resistance. However, mechanism underlying cetuximab resistance in OSCC is not clearly understood. Here, using a mouse orthotopic xenograft model of OSCC, we show that bone morphogenic protein-7-phosphorylated Smad-1, -5, -8 (BMP7-p-Smad1/5/8) signaling contributes to cetuximab resistance. Tumor cells isolated from the recurrent cetuximab-resistant xenograft models exhibited low EGFR expression but extremely high levels of p-Smad1/5/8. Treatment with the bone morphogenic protein receptor type 1 (BMPRI) inhibitor, DMH1 significantly reduced cetuximab-resistant OSCC tumor growth, and combined treatment of DMH1 and cetuximab remarkably reduced relapsed tumor growth inÂ vivo. Importantly, p-Smad1/5/8 level was elevated in cetuximab-resistant patients and this correlated with poor prognosis. Collectively, our results indicate that the BMP7-p-Smad1/5/8 signaling is a key pathway to acquired cetuximab resistance, and demonstrate that combination therapy of cetuximab and a BMP signaling inhibitor as potentially a new therapeutic strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to cetuximab in OSCC.

To overcome the TKI resistance, drugs with different mode of action are required. We previously reported that M-COPA (2-methylcoprophilinamide), a Golgi disruptor, suppressed the growth of gastric cancers overexpressing receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) via downregulating their cell surface expression. In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of M-COPA on NSCLC cells with TKI resistance. As a result, M-COPA effectively downregulated cell surface EGFR and its downstream signals, and finally exerted in vivo antitumor effect in NSCLC cells harboring secondary (T790M/del19) and tertiary (C797S/T790M/del19) mutated EGFR, which exhibit acquired resistance to first- and third generation EGFR-TKIs, respectively. M-COPA also downregulated MET expression potentially involved in the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs via bypassing the EGFR pathway blockade. These results provide the first evidence that targeting the Golgi apparatus might be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome the vicious cycle of TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells via downregulating cell surface RTK expression.

Selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, typically induce initial, profound tumor regressions within this group of patients; however, durable responses have been hampered by the emergence of drug resistance. Here, we examined the activity of ganetespib, a small-molecule inhibitor of Hsp90, in melanoma lines harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Ganetespib exposure resulted in the loss of mutant BRAF expression and depletion of mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT signaling, resulting in greater in vitro potency and antitumor efficacy compared with targeted BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Dual targeting of Hsp90 and BRAF(V600E) provided combinatorial benefit in vemurafenib-sensitive melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, ganetespib overcame mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to vemurafenib, the latter of which was characterized by reactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Continued suppression of BRAF(V600E) by vemurafenib potentiated sensitivity to MEK inhibitors after acquired resistance had been established. Ganetespib treatment reduced, but not abolished, elevations in steady-state ERK activity. Profiling studies revealed that the addition of a MEK inhibitor could completely abrogate ERK reactivation in the resistant phenotype, with ganetespib displaying superior combinatorial activity over vemurafenib. Moreover, ganetespib plus the MEK inhibitor TAK-733 induced tumor regressions in vemurafenib-resistant xenografts. Overall these data highlight the potential of ganetespib as a single-agent or combination treatment in BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma, particularly as a strategy to overcome acquired resistance to selective BRAF inhibitors.\n\nSynergistic Combination of Novel Tubulin Inhibitor ABI-274 and Vemurafenib Overcome Vemurafenib Acquired Resistance in BRAFV600E Melanoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Jin; Chen, Jianjun; Miller, Duane D.; Li, Wei\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAcquired clinical resistance to vemurafenib, a selective BRAFV600E inhibitor, arises frequently after short term chemotherapy. Since inhibitions of targets in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway result in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, vemurafenib-resistant cancer cells are expected to escape this cell cycle arrest and progress to subsequent G2/M phase. We hypothesized that a combined therapy using vemurafenib with a G2/M phase blocking agent will trap resistant cells and overcome vemurafenib resistance. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the combination index (CI) values of our novel tubulin inhibitor ABI-274 and vemurafenib on parental human A375 and MDA-MB-435 melanoma cell lines to be 0.32 and 0.1, respectively, suggesting strong synergy for the combination. We then developed an A375RF21 subline with significant acquired resistance to vemurafenib and confirmed the strong synergistic effect. Next we studied the potential mechanisms of overcoming vemurafenib resistance. Flow cytometry confirmed that the combination of ABI-274 and vemurafenib synergistically arrested cells in G1/G2/M phase, and significantly increased apoptosis in both parental A375 and the vemurafenib-resistant A375RF21 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the combination treatment effectively reduced the level of phosphorylated and total AKT, activated the apoptosis cascade, and increased cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, but had no significant influence on the level of ERK phosphorylation. Finally, in vivo co-administration of vemurafenib with ABI-274 showed strong synergistic efficacy in the vemurafenib-resistant xenograft model in nude mice. Overall, these results offer a rational combination strategy to significantly enhance the therapeutic benefit in melanoma patients who inevitably become resistant to current vemurafenib therapy.

Although various resistance mechanisms have been described, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies that target alternative mechanisms to treat lung tumors with acquired resistance to first-line EGFR TKI agents. Here we found that EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR TKI resistant tumor cells. Loss of EPHA2 reduced the viability of erlotinib resistant tumor cells harboring EGFRT790M mutations in vitro and inhibited tumor growth and progression in an inducible EGFRL858R+T790M mutant lung cancer model in vivo. Targeting EPHA2 in erlotinib resistant cells decreased S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of cell death agonist BAD, resulting in reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 by the small molecule inhibitor, ALW-II-41-27, decreased both survival and proliferation of erlotinib resistant tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. ALW-II-41-27 was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired resistance to the third generation EGFR TKI, AZD9291. Collectively, these data define a role for EPHA2 in the maintenance of cell survival of TKI resistant, EGFR mutant lung cancer and indicate that EPHA2 may serve as a useful therapeutic target in TKI resistant tumors.

Cetuximab is a mAb against EGFR that is used for the treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and metastatic colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, most tumors have intrinsic or will acquire resistance to cetuximab during the course of therapy. Honokiol is a natural compound found in the bark and leaves of the Chinese Magnolia tree and is established to have several anticancer properties without appreciable toxicity. In this study, we hypothesized that combining cetuximab and honokiol treatments could overcome acquired resistance to cetuximab. We previously developed a model of acquired resistance to cetuximab in non-small cell lung cancer H226 cell line. Treatment of cetuximab-resistant clones with honokiol and cetuximab resulted in a robust antiproliferative response. Immunoblot analysis revealed the HER family and their signaling pathways were downregulated after combination treatment, most notably the proliferation (MAPK) and survival (AKT) pathways. In addition, we found a decrease in phosphorylation of DRP1 and reactive oxygen species after combination treatment in cetuximab-resistant clones, which may signify a change in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we utilized cetuximab-resistant HNSCC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to test the benefit of combinatorial treatment in vivo There was significant growth delay in PDX tumors after combination treatment with a subsequent downregulation of active MAPK, AKT, and DRP1 signaling as seen in vitro Collectively, these data suggest that honokiol is a promising natural compound in overcoming acquired resistance to cetuximab.

The current standard care for metastatic pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine, however, the success of this treatment is poor and overall survival has not improved for decades. Drug resistance (both intrinsic and acquired) is thought to be a major reason for the limited benefit of most pancreatic cancer therapies. Areas covered Previous studies have indicated various mechanisms of drug resistance in pancreatic cancer, including changes in individual genes or signaling pathways, the influence of the tumor microenvironment, and the presence of highly resistant stem cells. This review summarizes recent advances in the mechanisms of drug resistance in pancreatic cancer, and potential strategies to overcome this. Expert Opinion Increasing drug delivery efficiency and decreasing drug resistance is the current aim in pancreatic cancer treatment, and will also benefit the treatment of other cancers. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of drug resistance in pancreatic cancer will lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies with the potential to sensitize pancreatic cancer to chemotherapy, and to increase the efficacy of current treatments in a wide variety of human cancers. PMID:21391891\n\nSym004, a Novel EGFR Antibody Mixture, Can Overcome Acquired Resistance to Cetuximab1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIida, Mari; Brand, Toni M; Starr, Megan M; Li, Chunrong; Huppert, Evan J; Luthar, Neha; Pedersen, Mikkel W; Horak, Ivan D; Kragh, Michael; Wheeler, Deric L\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has been approved for head and neck and colorectal cancer treatment, but many patients treated with cetuximab don't respond or eventually acquire resistance. To determine how tumor cells acquire resistance to cetuximab, we previously developed a model of acquired resistance using the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. These cetuximab-resistant (CtxR) cells exhibit increased steady-state EGFR expression secondary to alterations in EGFR trafficking and degradation and, further, retained dependence on EGFR signaling for enhanced growth potential. Here, we examined Sym004, a novel mixture of antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR, as an alternative therapy for CtxR tumor cells. Sym004 treatment of CtxR clones resulted in rapid EGFR degradation, followed by robust inhibition of cell proliferation and down-regulation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. To determine whether Sym004 could have therapeutic benefit in vivo, we established de novo CtxR NCI-H226 mouse xenografts and subsequently treated CtxR tumors with Sym004. Sym004 treatment of mice harboring CtxR tumors resulted in growth delay compared to mice continued on cetuximab. Levels of total and phospho-EGFR were robustly decreased in CtxR tumors treated with Sym004. Immunohistochemical analysis of these Sym004-treated xenograft tumors further demonstrated decreased expression of Ki67, and phospho-rpS6, as well as a modest increase in cleaved caspase-3. These results indicate that Sym004 may be an effective targeted therapy for CtxR tumors.

However, tumor cells inevitably acquire resistance to such therapies, circumventing any sustained clinical benefit. As the genomic classification of lung cancer continues to evolve and as the mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies become elucidated and more improved target-specific drugs come into sight, the future will see more promising results from the clinic through the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome, or prevent the development of, resistance for lung cancer patients.\n\nMelanoma patient derived xenografts acquire distinct Vemurafenib resistance mechanisms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMonsma, David J; Cherba, David M; Eugster, Emily E; Dylewski, Dawna L; Davidson, Paula T; Peterson, Chelsea A; Borgman, Andrew S; Winn, Mary E; Dykema, Karl J; Webb, Craig P; MacKeigan, Jeffrey P; Duesbery, Nicholas S; Nickoloff, Brian J; Monks, Noel R\n\n2015-01-01\n\nVariable clinical responses, tumor heterogeneity, and drug resistance reduce long-term survival outcomes for metastatic melanoma patients. To guide and accelerate drug development, we characterized tumor responses for five melanoma patient derived xenograft models treated with Vemurafenib. Three BRAFV600E models showed acquired drug resistance, one BRAFV600E model had a complete and durable response, and a BRAFV600V model was expectedly unresponsive. In progressing tumors, a variety of resistance mechanisms to BRAF inhibition were uncovered, including mutant BRAF alternative splicing, NRAS mutation, COT (MAP3K8) overexpression, and increased mutant BRAF gene amplification and copy number. The resistance mechanisms among the patient derived xenograft models were similar to the resistance pathways identified in clinical specimens from patients progressing on BRAF inhibitor therapy. In addition, there was both inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity in resistance mechanisms, accompanied by heterogeneous pERK expression immunostaining profiles. MEK monotherapy of Vemurafenib-resistant tumors caused toxicity and acquired drug resistance. However, tumors were eradicated when Vemurafenib was combined the MEK inhibitor. The diversity of drug responses among the xenograft models; the distinct mechanisms of resistance; and the ability to overcome resistance by the addition of a MEK inhibitor provide a scheduling rationale for clinical trials of next-generation drug combinations.

Experimental Design: AZD9219-resistant cell lines were established by exposing sensitive cell lines to AZD9291. Protein alterations were detected with Western blotting. Apoptosis was measured with annexin V/flow cytometry. Growth-inhibitory effects of tested drugs were evaluated in vitro with cell number estimation and colony formation assay and in vivo with mouse xenograft models. Protein degradation was determined by comparing protein half-lives and inhibiting proteasome. Gene knockdown were achieved with siRNA or shRNA. Results: AZD9291 potently induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, in which ERK phosphorylation was suppressed accompanied with Bim elevation and Mcl-1 reduction likely due to enhanced Mcl-1 degradation and increased Bim stability. Blocking Bim elevation by gene knockdown or enforcing Mcl-1 expression attenuated or abolished AZD9291-induced apoptosis. Moreover, AZD9291 lost its ability to modulate Bim and Mcl-1 levels in AZD9291-resistant cell lines. The combination of a MEK inhibitor with AZD9291 restores the sensitivity of AZD9291-resistant cells including those with C797S mutation to undergo apoptosis and growth regression in vitro and in vivo Conclusions: Modulation of MEK/ERK-dependent Bim and Mcl-1 degradation critically mediates sensitivity and resistance of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to AZD9291 and hence is an effective strategy to overcome acquired resistance to AZD9291.

We have shown intratumoral hypoxia induced by sorafenib activated C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/stromal-derived factor 1Î± (SDF1Î±) axis, resulting in polarization toward a tumor-promoting microenvironment and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in HCC. Herein, we formulated sorafenib in CXCR4-targeted lipid-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) modified with a CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 to systemically deliver sorafenib into HCC and sensitize HCC to sorafenib treatment. We demonstrated that CXCR4-targeted NPs efficiently delivered sorafenib into HCCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to achieve cytotoxicity and anti-angiogenic effect inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo. Despite the increased expression of SDF1Î± upon the persistent hypoxia induced by sorafenib-loaded CXCR4-targeted NPs, AMD3100 attached to the NPs can block CXCR4/SDF1Î±, leading to the reduced infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages, enhanced anti-angiogenic effect, a delay in tumor progression and increased overall survival in the orthotopic HCC model compared with other control groups. In conclusion, our results highlight the clinical potential of CXCR4-targeted NPs for delivering sorafenib and overcoming acquired drug resistance in liver cancer. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, novel targeted strategies to overcome cancer drug resistance constitute a key aim of cancer research. In this respect, targeted nanomedicine offers innovative therapeutic strategies to overcome the various limitations of conventional chemotherapy, enabling enhanced selectivity, early and more precise cancer diagnosis, individualized treatment as well as overcoming of drug resistance, including multidrug resistance (MDR). Delivery systems based on nanoparticles (NPs) include diverse platforms enabling a plethora of rationally designed therapeutic nanomedicines. Here we review NPs designed to enhance antitumor drug uptake and selective intracellular accumulation using strategies including passive and active targeting, stimuli-responsive drug activation or target-activated release, triggered solely in the cancer cell or in specific organelles, cutting edge theranostic multifunctional NPs delivering drug combinations for synergistic therapy, while facilitating diagnostics, and personalization of therapeutic regimens. In the current paper we review the recent findings of the past four years and discuss the advantages and limitations of the various novel NPs-based drug delivery systems. Special emphasis is put on in vivo study-based evidences supporting significant therapeutic impact in chemoresistant cancers. A future perspective is proposed for further research and development of complex targeted, multi-stage responsive nanomedical drug delivery systems for personalized cancer diagnosis and efficacious therapy.

However, emergence of acquired resistance is virtually inevitable, thus limiting improvement in patient outcomes. To elucidate and overcome this acquired resistance, multidisciplinary basic and clinical investigational approaches have been applied, using in vitro cell line models or samples obtained from lung cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. These efforts have revealed several acquired resistance mechanisms and candidates, including EGFR secondary mutations (T790M and other rare mutations), MET amplification, PTEN downregulation, CRKL amplification, high-level HGF expression, FAS-NFÎºB pathway activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and conversion to small cell lung cancer. Interestingly, cancer cells harbor potential destiny and ductility together in acquiring resistance to EGFR-TKIs, as shown in in vitro acquired resistance models. Molecular mechanisms of \"reversible EGFR-TKI tolerance\" that occur in early phase EGFR-TKI exposure have been identified in cell line models. Furthermore, others have reported molecular markers that can predict response to EGFR-TKIs in clinical settings. Deeper understanding of acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs, followed by the development of molecular target drugs that can overcome the resistance, might turn this fatal disease into a chronic disorder.\n\nSTAT3-targeted treatment with silibinin overcomes the acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuyÃ s, Elisabet; PÃ©rez-SÃ¡nchez, Almudena; Micol, Vicente; Menendez, Javier A; Bosch-Barrera, Joaquim\n\n2016-12-16\n\nThe signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been suggested to play a prominent role in mediating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistance to some tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-mediated therapies. Using a model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)-translocated NSCLC with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib, but lacking amplifications or mutations in the kinase domain of ALK, we herein present evidence that STAT3 activation is a novel mechanism of crizotinib resistance that involves the upregulation of immune escape and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways. Taking advantage of the flavonolignan silibinin as a naturally occurring STAT3-targeted pharmacological inhibitor, we confirmed that STAT3 activation protects ALK-translocated NSCLC from crizotinib. Accordingly, silibinin-induced inhibition of STAT3 worked synergistically with crizotinib to reverse acquired resistance and restore sensitivity in crizotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, silibinin treatment significantly inhibited the upregulation of the immune checkpoint regulator PD-L1 and also EMT regulators (e.g., SLUG, VIM, CD44) in crizotinib-refractory cells. These findings provide a valuable strategy to potentially improve the efficacy of ALK inhibition by cotreatment with silibinin-based therapeutics, which merit clinical investigation for ALK TKI-resistant NSCLC patients.\n\nExtensive Drug Resistance Acquired During Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCegielski, J.

In 2000, the international Green Light Committee (GLC) initiative began to increase access while attempting to prevent acquired resistance. Methods.âTo assess the GLC's impact, we followed adults with pulmonary MDR tuberculosis from the start to the end of treatment with monthly sputum cultures, drug susceptibility testing, and genotyping. We compared the frequency and predictors of acquired resistance to second-line drugs (SLDs) in 9 countries that volunteered to participate, 5 countries that met GLC criteria, and 4 countries that did not apply to the GLC. Results.âIn total, 832 subjects were enrolled. Of those without baseline resistance to specific SLDs, 68 (8.9%) acquired extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, 79 (11.2%) acquired fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance, and 56 (7.8%) acquired resistance to second-line injectable drugs (SLIs). The relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of acquired resistance was lower at GLC-approved sites: 0.27 (.16â.47) for XDR tuberculosis, 0.28 (.17â.45) for FQ, and 0.15 (.06â.39) to 0.60 (.34â1.05) for 3 different SLIs. The risk increased as the number of potentially effective drugs decreased. Controlling for baseline drug resistance and differences between sites, the odds ratios (95% CIs) were 0.21 (.07â.62) for acquired XDR tuberculosis and 0.23 (.09â.59) for acquired FQ resistance. Conclusions.âTreatment of MDR tuberculosis involves substantial risk of acquired resistance to SLDs, increasing as baseline drug resistance increases. The risk was significantly lower in programs documented by the GLC to meet specific standards.

The phenomenon, termed multidrug resistance (MDR), is often associated with the over-expression of P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane protein pump, which can enhance efflux of a various chemicals structurally unrelated at the expense of ATP depletion, resulting in decrease of the intracellular cytotoxic drug accumulation. The MDR has been a big threaten to the human health and the war fight for it continues. Although several other mechanisms for MDR are elucidated in recent years, considerable efforts attempting to inverse MDR are involved in exploring P-glycoprotein modulators and suppressing P-glycoprotein expression. In this review, we will report on the recent advances in various strategies for overcoming or circumventing MDR mediated by P-glycoprotein.\n\nNew systemic strategies for overcoming resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nGenova, Carlo; Rijavec, Erika; Biello, Federica; Rossi, Giovanni; Barletta, Giulia; Dal Bello, Maria Giovanna; Vanni, Irene; Coco, Simona; Alama, Angela; Grossi, Francesco\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAlthough the achievements in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been translated in improved disease control, response rate and survival, especially in the case of patients with targetable oncogenic drivers, acquired resistance is common after initial benefit; furthermore, primary resistance can occasionally be observed. Due to its clinical implications, the management of treatment-resistant NSCLC is a top topic of the current research, and many efforts are being put in the study of the mechanisms at the base of resistance and in the development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Areas covered: This review aims at identifying the most relevant novel chemical therapies designed to overcome resistance in NSCLC, including recently approved agents, as well as compounds in clinical development. Expert opinion: An improved knowledge of the mechanisms causing resistance to treatments in NSCLC translates into effective innovative chemical therapies able to overcome such occurrence, and the paradigms of this progress are represented by novel inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK); however, the study of novel systemic therapies in this setting is challenging, and further efforts in this setting are highly needed.\n\nBrigatinib combined with anti-EGFR antibody overcomes osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUchibori, Ken; Inase, Naohiko; Araki, Mitsugu; Kamada, Mayumi; Sato, Shigeo; Okuno, Yasushi; Fujita, Naoya; Katayama, Ryohei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOsimertinib has been demonstrated to overcome the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-T790M, the most relevant acquired resistance to first-generation EGFRâtyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFRâTKIs). However, the C797S mutation, which impairs the covalent binding between the cysteine residue at position 797 of EGFR and osimertinib, induces resistance to osimertinib. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation)-mediated EGFRâTKI resistance. In the present study, we identify brigatinib to be effective against triple-mutation-harbouring cells in vitro and in vivo. Our original computational simulation demonstrates that brigatinib fits into the ATP-binding pocket of triple-mutant EGFR. The structureâactivity relationship analysis reveals the key component in brigatinib to inhibit the triple-mutant EGFR. The efficacy of brigatinib is enhanced markedly by combination with anti-EGFR antibody because of the decrease of surface and total EGFR expression. Thus, the combination therapy of brigatinib with anti-EGFR antibody is a powerful candidate to overcome triple-mutant EGFR.

Recent combination therapies such as a MEK inhibitor combined with vemurafenib show improvement in major clinical end points, but the percentage of patients with adverse toxic events is higher than with vemurafenib monotherapy and most patients ultimately relapse. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new antimelanoma drugs and/or adjuvant agents for vemurafenib therapy. In this study, we created a novel semiorganically modified derivative, DETD-35, from deoxyelephantopin (DET), a plant sesquiterpene lactone demonstrated as an anti-inflammatory and anti-mammary tumor agent. Our results show that DETD-35 inhibited proliferation of a panel of melanoma cell lines, including acquired vemurafenib resistance A375 cells (A375-R) established in this study, with superior activities to DET and no cytotoxicity to normal melanocytes. DETD-35 suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor mass as effectively as vemurafenib in A375 xenograft study. Furthermore, DETD-35 also reduced tumor growth in both acquired (A375-R) and intrinsic (A2058) vemurafenib resistance xenograft models, where vemurafenib showed no antitumor activity. Notably, the combination of DETD-35 and vemurafenib exhibited the most significant effects in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft studies due to synergism of the compound and the drug. Mechanistic studies suggested that DETD-35 overcame acquired vemurafenib resistance at least in part through deregulating MEK-ERK, Akt, and STAT3 signaling pathways and promoting apoptosis of cancer cells. Overall, our results suggest that DETD-35 may be useful as a therapeutic or adjuvant agent against BRAF(V600E) mutant and acquired vemurafenib resistance melanoma. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(6); 1163-76.

In search of bioactive natural products for overcoming TRAIL-resistance from natural resources, we previously reported a number of active compounds. In our screening program on natural resources targeting overcoming TRAIL-resistance, activity-guided fractionations of the extract of Xanthium strumarium led to the isolation of five sesquiterpene compounds (1-5). 11Î±,13-dihydroxanthinin (2) and 11Î±,13-dihydroxanthuminol (3) were first isolated from natural resources and xanthinosin (1), desacetylxanthanol (4), and lasidiol p-methoxybenzoate (5) were known compounds. All compounds (1-5) showed potent TRAIL-resistance overcoming activity at 8, 20, 20, 16, and 16 Î¼M, respectively, in TRAIL-resistant AGS cells. Compounds 1 and 5 enhanced the levels of apoptosis inducing proteins DR4, DR5, p53, CHOP, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-9 and also decreased the levels of cell survival protein Bcl-2 in TRAIL-resistant AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 1 also enhanced the levels of DR4 and DR5 proteins in a time-dependent manner. Thus, compounds 1 and 5 were found to induce both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic cell death. Compound 1 also exhibit TRAIL-resistance overcoming activity in DLD1, DU145, HeLa, and MCF7 cells but did not decrease viability in non-cancer HEK293 cells up to 8 Î¼M.

The tumor microenvironment often impacts negatively on drug response. Here, we demonstrate that stromal cells protect MCL cells from ibrutinib-induced apoptosis and support MCL cell regrowth after drug removal by impairing ibrutinib-mediated downregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling. Importantly, the stromal cell-mediated ibrutinib resistance was overcome in vitro by inhibiting AKT activity using the PI3K catalytic p110Î± subunit-specific inhibitor BYL719. This was seen both for MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells. Furthermore, inhibition of p110Î± activity by BYL719 potentiated the ability of ibrutinib to inhibit MCL tumor growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. The stromal cell-mediated ibrutinib resistance was found to be due to a direct interaction with MCL cells and involves the integrin VLA-4, as disrupting stromal cell-MCL cell interaction using a VLA-4 blocking antibody abrogated the ibrutinib resistance. This suggests that combined treatment with ibrutinib and a p110Î± inhibitor, alternatively by disrupting stromal cell-MCL cell interaction, may be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome stromal cell-mediated ibrutinib resistance in MCL.

Herein, we demonstrated that low doses of IR intrinsically activated NFÎºB in resistant MEC cell lines. Moreover, resistance was significantly enhanced in IR-sensitive cell lines when NFÎºB pathway was stimulated. Pharmacological inhibition of the IKK-Î²/IÎºBÎ±/NFÎºB axis, using a single dose of FDA-approved Emetine, led to a striking sensitization of MEC cells to IR and a reduction in cancer stem cells. We achieved a major step towards better understanding the basic mechanisms involved in IR-adaptive resistance in MEC cell lines and how to efficiently overcome this critical problem.

For recurrent and metastatic HNSCC, cisplatin is the most common treatment option, but most of patients will eventually develop cisplatin resistance. Therefore, it is imperative to define the mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance and find novel therapeutic strategies to overcome this deadly disease. In order to determine the role of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) in contributing to acquired cisplatin resistance in HNSCC, the expression and activity of NF-ÎºB and its upstream kinases, IKKÎ± and IKKÎ², were evaluated and compared in three pairs of cisplatin sensitive and resistant HNSCC cell lines, including a pair of patient derived HNSCC cell line. The experiments revealed that NF-ÎºB p65 activity was elevated in cisplatin resistant HNSCC cells compared to that in their parent cells. Importantly, the phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB p65 at serine 536 and the phosphorylation of IKKÎ± and IKKÎ² at their activation loops were dramatically elevated in the resistant cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of NF-ÎºB or overexpression of p65-S536 alanine (p65-S536A) mutant sensitizes resistant cells to cisplatin. Additionally, the novel IKKÎ² inhibitor CmpdA has been shown to consistently block the phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB at serine 536 while also dramatically improving the efficacy of cisplatin in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in the cisplatin resistant cancer cells. These results indicated that IKK/NF-ÎºB plays a pivotal role in controlling acquired cisplatin resistance and that targeting the IKK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway may provide a possible therapeutic method to overcome the acquired resistance to cisplatin in HNSCC.

However, acquired resistance to sorafenib has been found in some HCC patients, resulting in poor prognosis. It is reported that PD-L1 and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) contribute to drug resistance. In this study, by inducing sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines, we investigated their molecular and functional characteristics. Our data indicated that highly upregulated DNMT1 was positively correlated with PD-L1 overexpression in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. We demonstrate that PD-L1 regulate DNMT1 through STAT3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of PD-L1 induced DNMT1-dependent DNA hypomethylation and restored the expression of methylation-silenced CDH1. Moreover, inactivation of NFÎºB blocked PD-L1/STAT3/DNMT1 pathway in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Functionally, genetic or pharmacological disruption of PD-L1 or/and DNMT1 sensitize HCC resistance to sorafenib. Importantly, dual inactivation of PD-L1 and DNMT1 by their inhibitor synergistically disrupts the colony formation of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. These results demonstrate that targeting NFÎºB/PDL1/STAT3/DNMT1 axis is a new therapeutic strategy for preventing or overcoming the acquired resistance to sorafenib in HCC patients.

Overexpression of efflux transporters is an important source of drug resistance. Efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein reduce intracellular drug accumulation and compromise drug efficacy. Various nanoparticle-based approaches have been investigated to overcome efflux-mediated resistance. These include the use of formulation excipients that inhibit transporter activity and co-delivery of the anticancer drug with a specific inhibitor of transporter function or expression. However, the effectiveness of nanoparticles can be diminished by poor transport in the tumor tissue. Hence, adjunct therapies that improve the intratumoral distribution of nanoparticles may be vital to the successful application of nanotechnology to overcome tumor drug resistance. This review discusses the mechanisms of tumor drug resistance and highlights the opportunities and challenges in the use of nanoparticles to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs against resistant tumors.

Exposure of tumor cells to increasing concentrations of alkylating agents resulted in increased cell death in a strong dose-response manner. Moreover, the acquired resistance of tumor cells could be overcome by dose intensification. In clinic, dose intensification of alkylating agents resulted in increased therapeutic responses, however associated with significant hematological toxicity. Following the development of autologous stem cells transplantation harvesting from peripheral blood, the high-doses of chemotherapy, initially associated with marked toxic effects, could be more easily tolerated. As a result, the approach was evaluated in different types of solid tumors, including breast, ovarian and germ cell tumors, small cell lung carcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas and Ewing sarcoma. To date, high-doses chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cells support is only used as a salvage therapy to treat poor prognosis germ cell tumors patients with chemo-sensitive disease. Regarding breast and ovarian cancer, high-doses chemotherapy should be considered only in the context of clinical trials. However, intensive therapy as an approach to overcome resistance to standard treatments is still relevant. Numerous efforts are still ongoing to identify novel therapeutic combinations and active treatments to improve patients' responses. Copyright Â© 2016 SociÃ©tÃ© FranÃ§aise du Cancer.

Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. Experimental Design We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity-relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. Results We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. Conclusions We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure which are sensitive to other next generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.

Although dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors are currently under development to treat various malignancies, the emergence of drug resistance has proven to be a major complication. AZD8055 is a novel, potent ATP-competitive and specific inhibitor of mTOR kinase activity, which blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation. In this study, we acquired AZD8055-resistant neuroblastoma (NB) cell sublines by using prolonged stepwise escalation of AZD8055 exposure (4-12 weeks). Here we demonstrate that the AZD8055-resistant sublines (TGW-R and SMS-KAN-R) exhibited marked resistance to AZD8055 compared to the parent cells (TGW and SMS-KAN). The cell cycle G1/S transition was advanced in resistant cells. In addition, the resistance against AZD8055 correlated with over-activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, combination of AZD8055 and MEK inhibitor U0126 enhanced the growth inhibition of resistant cells significantly inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo. In conclusion, these data show that targeting mTOR kinase and MEK/ERK signaling simultaneously might help to overcome AZD8055 resistance in NB. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

While multiple mechanisms are responsible for treatment failure, deficiency in drug transport is an important contributor. The human high-affinity copper (Cu) transporter-1 (hCtr1) can also transport Pt-based drugs including cisplatin (cDDP) and carboplatin. Reduced hCtr1 expression frequently occurs in cDDP-resistant cell lines and in cancer in patients who failed chemotherapy with these drugs. We previously demonstrated that Cu chelation induces the expression of transcription factor Sp1 which binds the promoters of Sp1 and hCtr1, thereby, up-regulating their expression, whereas Cu overload shuts down hCtr1 and Sp1 expression by dissociating Sp1 from their promoter promoters. Thus, mammalian Cu homeostasis is transcriptionally regulated within a loop consisting of Sp1, hCtr1, and Cu in a three-way mutually regulated manner. These findings suggest that it is feasible to module cDDP transport capacity through intervention of mammalian Cu homeostasis. Indeed, we found that cDDP resistance can be overcome by Cu-lowering agents through enhanced hCtr1 expression by up-regulation of Sp1 in cultured cells. This discovery provided a mechanistic basis for the ongoing clinical study using Cu chelator to overcome cDDP resistance in ovarian cancer chemotherapy. Preliminary study using copper chelator (trientine) for enhancing the treatment efficacy of carboplatin in 5 ovarian cancer patients showed encouraging results. This short review describes the perspectives of using Cu-lowering agents in overcoming Pt resistance in cancer chemotherapy.\n\nTargeting the HER family with Pan-HER effectively overcomes resistance to cetuximab\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIida, Mari; Bahrar, Harsh; Brand, Toni M; Pearson, Hannah E; Coan, John P; Orbuch, Rachel A; Flanigan, Bailey G; Swick, Adam D; Prabakaran, Prashanth; Lantto, Johan; Horak, Ivan D.; Kragh, Michael; Salgia, Ravi; Kimple, Randy J; Wheeler, Deric L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCetuximab, an antibody against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has shown efficacy in treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), metastatic colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the clinical success of cetuximab, many patients do not respond to cetuximab. Furthermore, virtually all patients who do initially respond become refractory, highlighting both intrinsic and acquired resistance to cetuximab as significant clinical problems. To understand mechanistically how cancerous cells acquire resistance, we previously developed models of acquired resistance using the H226 NSCLC and UM-SCC1 HNSCC cell lines. Cetuximab-resistant clones showed a robust upregulation and dependency on the HER family receptors EGFR, HER2 and HER3. Here, we examined Pan-HER, a mixture of six antibodies targeting these receptors on cetuximab-resistant clones. In cells exhibiting acquired or intrinsic resistance to cetuximab, Pan-HER treatment decreased all three receptorsâ protein levels and down-stream activation of AKT and MAPK. This correlated with decreased cell proliferation in cetuximab-resistant clones. To determine whether Pan-HER had a therapeutic benefit in vivo, we established de novo cetuximab-resistant mouse xenografts and treated resistant tumors with Pan-HER. This regimen resulted in a superior growth delay of cetuximab-resistant xenografts compared to mice continued on cetuximab. Furthermore, intrinsically cetuximab-resistant HNSCC patient-derived xenograft tumors treated with Pan-HER exhibited significant growth delay compared to vehicle/cetuximab controls. These results suggest that targeting HER family receptors simultaneously with Pan-HER is a promising treatment strategy for tumors displaying intrinsic or acquired resistance to cetuximab.

Combination regimens that increase frequency of complete remissions, accelerate time to remission, and overcome single agent resistance are of considerable interest. We previously showed that the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor is proapoptotic in CLL cells and disrupts B-cell receptor signaling via BTK depletion. Herein we show the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib elicits a synergistic cytotoxic effect in primary CLL cells and increases overall survival compared with ibrutinib alone in a mouse model of CLL. Selinexor is effective in cells isolated from patients with prolonged lymphocytosis following ibrutinib therapy. Finally, selinexor is effective in ibrutinib-refractory mice and in a cell line harboring the BTK C481S mutation. This is the first report describing the combined activity of ibrutinib and selinexor in CLL, which represents a new treatment paradigm and warrants further evaluation in clinical trials of CLL patients including those with acquired ibrutinib resistance.

However, a significant proportion of HER2-positive patients are either inherently resistant or develop resistance to trastuzumab. We assessed the effects of neratinib, an irreversible panHER inhibitor, in a panel of 36 breast cancer cell lines. We further assessed its effects with or without trastuzumab in several sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells as well as a BT474 xenograft model. We confirmed that neratinib was significantly more active in HER2-amplified than HER2 non-amplified cell lines. Neratinib decreased the activation of the 4 HER receptors and inhibited downstream pathways. However, HER3 and Akt were reactivated at 24 hours, which was prevented by the combination of trastuzumab and neratinib. Neratinib also decreased pHER2 and pHER3 in acquired trastuzumab resistant cells. Neratinib in combination with trastuzumab had a greater growth inhibitory effect than either drug alone in 4 HER2 positive cell lines. Furthermore, trastuzumab in combination with neratinib was growth inhibitory in SKBR3 and BT474 cells which had acquired resistance to trastuzumab as well as in a BT474 xenograft model. Innately trastuzumab resistant cell lines showed sensitivity to neratinib, but the combination did not enhance response compared to neratinib alone. Levels of HER2 and phospho-HER2 showed a direct correlation with sensitivity to neratinib. Our data indicate that neratinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy and counteracted both innate and acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our results suggest that combined treatment with trastuzumab and neratinib is likely to be more effective than either treatment alone for both trastuzumab-sensitive breast cancer as well as HER2-positive tumors with acquired resistance to trastuzumab.

The most common antifungal resistance encountered is efflux pump-mediated resistance of Candida species to azole drugs. One approach to overcome this resistance is to inhibit the pumps and chemosensitize resistant strains to azole drugs. Drug discovery targeting fungal efflux pumps could thus result in the development of azole-enhancing combination therapy. Heterologous expression of fungal efflux pumps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a versatile system for screening for pump inhibitors. Fungal efflux pumps transport a range of xenobiotics including fluorescent compounds. This enables the use of fluorescence-based detection, as well as growth inhibition assays, in screens to discover compounds targeting efflux-mediated antifungal drug resistance. A variety of medium- and high-throughput screens have been used to identify a number of chemical entities that inhibit fungal efflux pumps.

Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of HCC. In this study, two sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines and a nude mouse subcutaneously tumor model were used to explore the possible mechanisms leading to sorafenib resistance, and to investigate whether aspirin could increase the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to sorafenib. The combination of aspirin and sorafenib resulted in a synergistic antitumor effect against liver tumors both in vitro and in vivo. High glycolysis and PFKFB3 overexpression occupied a dominant position in sorafenib resistance, and can be targeted and overcome by aspirin. Aspirin plus sorafenib induced apoptosis in tumors without inducing weight loss, hepatotoxicity or inflammation. Our results suggest that aspirin overcomes sorafenib resistance and their combination may be an effective treatment approach for HCC.

After initial promising results with EGFR-targeted therapies such as cetuximab, therapeutic resistance has become a major clinical problem, and new treatment options are therefore necessary. Moreover, the relationship between HER receptors, anti-EGFR therapies, and the human papillomavirus (HPV) status in HNSCC is not fully understood. In contrast to first-generation EGFR inhibitors, afatinib irreversibly inhibits multiple HER receptors simultaneously. Therefore, treatment with afatinib might result in a more pronounced therapeutic benefit, even in patients experiencing cetuximab resistance. In this study, the cytotoxic effect of afatinib as single agent and in combination with cisplatin was investigated in cetuximab-sensitive, intrinsically cetuximab-resistant, and acquired cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cell lines with different HPV status under normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, the influence of cetuximab resistance, HPV, and hypoxia on the expression of HER receptors was investigated. Our results demonstrated that afatinib was able to establish cytotoxicity in cetuximab-sensitive, intrinsically cetuximab-resistant, and acquired cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cell lines, independent of the HPV status. However, cross-resistance between cetuximab and afatinib might be possible. Treatment with afatinib caused a G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest as well as induction of apoptotic cell death. Additive to antagonistic interactions between afatinib and cisplatin could be observed. Neither cetuximab resistance nor HPV status significantly influenced the expression of HER receptors in HNSCC cell lines. In contrast, the expression of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 was significantly altered under hypoxia. Oxygen deficiency is a common characteristic of HNSCC tumors, and these hypoxic tumor regions often contain cells that are more resistant to treatment.

The review is mainly focused on biofilm-growing microrganisms because this form of growth poses a threat to chronically infected or immunocompromised patients and is difficult to eradicate from medical devices. We discuss the biofilm formation process and mechanisms of its increased resistance to various antimicrobials. We present, based on data in the literature, strategies for overcoming the problem of biofilm resistance. Factors that have potential for use in increasing the efficiency of the killing of biofilm-forming bacteria include plant extracts, enzymes that disturb the biofilm structure, and other nonenzymatic molecules. We propose combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with various antimicrobial and antibiofilm approaches to obtain a synergistic effect to permit efficient microbial growth control at low photosensitizer doses.\n\nCytotoxic chemotherapy may overcome the development of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanda, Shintaro; Horinouchi, Hidehito; Fujiwara, Yutaka; Nokihara, Hiroshi; Yamamoto, Noboru; Sekine, Ikuo; Kunitoh, Hideo; Kubota, Kaoru; Tamura, Tomohide; Ohe, Yuichiro\n\n2015-09-01\n\nIn the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been shown to yield a longer progression-free survival (PFS) rate than platinum-doublet chemotherapy; however, after the initial response, most patients develop resistance to the EGFR-TKIs. We hypothesized that the insertion of platinum-doublet chemotherapy after the initial response to EGFR-TKIs might prevent the emergence of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and prolong survival. We carried out a phase II study of the following first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. Gefitinib (250 mg) was administered on days 1-56. Then, after a two-week drug-free period, three cycles of cisplatin (80 mg/m2) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2) were administered on days 71, 92, and 113. Thereafter, gefitinib was re-started on day 134 and continued until disease progression. The primary endpoint was the two-year PFS rate. A total of 34 patients were enrolled. Of the 33 eligible patients and 12 achieved a two-year PFS. Thus, this therapeutic strategy met the criterion for usefulness. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 67.0%, 40.2%, 36.9%, and 22.0%, respectively, and the median PFS was 19.5 months. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 90.6%, 71.9%, 64.8%, and 36.5% respectively, and the median survival time was 48.0 months. These results indicate that the insertion of platinum-doublet chemotherapy might prevent the development of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.

However, most patients treated with vemurafenib eventually develop resistance largely due to reactivation of MAPK signaling. Inhibitors of MAPK signaling, including MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib, failed to show significant clinical benefit in patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Here, we describe that cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib show reactivation of MAPK signaling and upregulation of cyclin D1 and are sensitive to inhibition of LY2835219, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6. LY2835219 was demonstrated to inhibit growth of melanoma A375 tumor xenografts and delay tumor recurrence in combination with vemurafenib. Furthermore, we developed an in vivo vemurafenib-resistant model by continuous administration of vemurafenib in A375 xenografts. Consistently, we found that MAPK is reactivated and cyclin D1 is elevated in vemurafenib-resistant tumors, as well as in the resistant cell lines derived from these tumors. Importantly, LY2835219 exhibited tumor growth regression in a vemurafenib-resistant model. Mechanistic analysis revealed that LY2835219 induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner in vemurafenib-resistant cells whereas it primarily mediated cell-cycle G1 arrest in the parental cells. Similarly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 induced significantly higher rate of apoptosis in the resistant cells than in parental cells, suggesting that elevated cyclin D1 activity is important for the survival of vemurafenib-resistant cells. Altogether, we propose that targeting cyclin D1-CDK4/6 signaling by LY2835219 is an effective strategy to overcome MAPK-mediated resistance to B-RAF inhibitors in B-RAF V600E melanoma.

Also, these drugs are being increasingly used in the peri-transplant setting for transplant-eligible patients, and as part of consolidation and/or maintenance after front-line treatment, including in transplant-ineligible patients. Together, these and other strategies have contributed to a prolongation of progression-free and overall survival in myeloma patients, and an increasing proportion are able to sustain a remission for many years. Despite these improvements, however, the vast majority of patients continue to suffer relapses, which suggests a prominent role for either primary, innate drug resistance, or secondary, acquired drug resistance. As a result, there remains a strong need to develop new proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, as well as new drug classes, which would be effective in the relapsed and/or refractory setting, and overcome drug resistance. This review will focus on novel drugs that have reached phase III trials, including carfilzomib and pomalidomide, which have recently garnered regulatory approvals. In addition, agents that are in phase II or III, potentially registration-enabling trials will be described as well, to provide an overview of the possible landscape in the relapsed and/or refractory arena over the next five years.

Classically, it has been thought that these acquired genetic changes are fixed. This has led to the paradigm of moving from one cancer therapy to the next while avoiding past therapies. However, emerging data on epigenetic changes during tumor progression and use of epigenetic therapies have shown that epigenetic modifications leading to chemotherapy resistance have the potential to be reversible with epigenetic therapy. In fact, promising clinical data exist that treatment with epigenetic agents can diminish chemotherapy resistance in a number of tumor types including chronic myelogenous leukemia, colorectal, ovarian, lung and breast cancer. The potential for epigenetic-modifying drugs to allow for treatment of resistant disease is exciting and clinical trials have just begun to evaluate this area.

We compared antimicrobial resistance in Shigella infections related to overseas travel (travel-associated) and in those acquired domestically by analyzing antimicrobial resistance patterns, geographic distributions, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. We tested samples (nâ=â204) from a collection of isolates recovered from patients in Pennsylvania between 2006 and 2014. Isolates were grouped into travel- and non-travel-associated categories. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the Shigella isolates acquired during international travel were resistant to multiple antibiotics compared to 53 (52.1%) of the infections transmitted in domestic settings. A majority (79.4%) of isolates associated with international travel demonstrated resistance to aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, whereas 47 (46.1%) of the infections acquired domestically were resistant to tetracycline. Almost all isolates (92.2%) transmitted in domestic settings were resistant to aminoglycosides, and 5 isolates from adult male patients were resistant to azithromycin, a drug often used for empiric treatment of severe shigellosis. Twenty (19.6%) isolates associated with illnesses acquired during overseas travel in 4 countries were resistant to quinolones. One S. sonnei PFGE pattern was traced to a multidrug-resistant isolate acquired overseas that had caused a multistate outbreak of shigellosis, suggesting global dissemination of a drug-resistant species. Resistance to certain drugs-for example, tetracycline-increased in both overseas- and domestic-acquired infections during the study period. The prevalence of resistance to macrolides (azithromycin) and third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) was less than 1%; however, efforts to better monitor changes in drug resistance over time combined with increased antimicrobial stewardship are essential at the local, national, and global levels.\n\nOvercoming cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells by targeting HIF-1-regulated cancer metabolism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAi, Zhihong; Lu, Yang; Qiu, Songbo; Fan, Zhen\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCisplatin is currently one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs used for treating ovarian cancer; however, resistance to cisplatin is common. In this study, we explored an experimental strategy for overcoming cisplatin resistance of human ovarian cancer from the new perspective of cancer cell metabolism. By using two pairs of genetically matched cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, we tested the hypothesis that downregulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which regulates metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, is a promising strategy for overcoming cisplatin resistance of human ovarian cancer cells. We found that cisplatin downregulated the level of the regulatable Î± subunit of HIF-1, HIF-1Î±, in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cells through enhancing HIF-1Î± degradation but did not downregulate HIF-1Î± in their cisplatin-resistant counterparts. Overexpression of a degradation-resistant HIF-1Î± (HIF-1Î± ÎODD) reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive cells, whereas genetic knockdown of HIF-1Î± or pharmacological promotion of HIF-1Î± degradation enhanced response to cisplatin in both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We further demonstrated that knockdown of HIF-1Î± improved the response of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin by redirecting the aerobic glycolysis in the resistant cancer cells towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to cell death through overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Our findings suggest that the HIF-1Î±-regulated cancer metabolism pathway could be a novel target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.

Hence, there have been efforts to therapeutically inhibit this pathway. Areas covered: Several inhibitors of PI3K are now progressing through clinical trials with varying degrees of efficacy and toxicity to date. Numerous unresolved questions remain concerning the optimal isoform selectivity of PI3K inhibitors and use of predictive biomarkers. This review examines the most important PI3K inhibitors in ER positive breast cancer to date, with a particular focus on their role in overcoming endocrine therapy resistance and the possible use of PIK3CA mutations as a predictive biomarker. Expert opinion: We discuss some of the emerging challenges and questions encountered during the development of PI3K inhibitors from preclinical to phase III studies, including other novel biomarkers and future combinations to overcome endocrine resistance.\n\nBacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles and how to overcome it\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPanÃ¡Äek, AleÅ¡; KvÃ­tek, Libor; SmÃ©kalovÃ¡, Monika; VeÄeÅovÃ¡, Renata; KolÃ¡Å, Milan; RÃ¶derovÃ¡, Magdalena; DyÄka, Filip; Å ebela, Marek; Prucek, Robert; Tomanec, OndÅej; ZboÅil, Radek\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSilver nanoparticles have already been successfully applied in various biomedical and antimicrobial technologies and products used in everyday life. Although bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been extensively discussed in the literature, the possible development of resistance to silver nanoparticles has not been fully explored. We report that the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 013, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCM 3955 and E. coli CCM 3954 can develop resistance to silver nanoparticles after repeated exposure. The resistance stems from the production of the adhesive flagellum protein flagellin, which triggers the aggregation of the nanoparticles. This resistance evolves without any genetic changes; only phenotypic change is needed to reduce the nanoparticles' colloidal stability and thus eliminate their antibacterial activity. The resistance mechanism cannot be overcome by additional stabilization of silver nanoparticles using surfactants or polymers. It is, however, strongly suppressed by inhibiting flagellin production with pomegranate rind extract.\n\nMarine bacteria: potential sources for compounds to overcome antibiotic resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nEom, Sung-Hwan; Kim, Young-Mog; Kim, Se-Kwon\n\n2013-06-01\n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most problematic Gram-positive bacterium in the context of public health due to its resistance against almost all available antibiotics except vancomycin and teicoplanin.

Recently, resistant strains against linezolid and daptomycin, which are alternative drugs to treat MRSA infection, have also been reported. Thus, the development of new drugs or alternative therapies is clearly a matter of urgency. In response to the antibiotic resistance, many researchers have studied for alternative antibiotics and therapies. In this review, anti-MRSA substances isolated from marine bacteria, with their potential antibacterial effect against MRSA as potential anti-MRSA agents, are discussed and several strategies for overcoming the antibiotic resistance are also introduced. Our objective was to highlight marine bacteria that have potential to lead in developing novel antibiotics or clinically useful alternative therapeutic treatments.\n\nBacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles and how to overcome it.\n\nPubMed\n\nPanÃ¡Äek, AleÅ¡; KvÃ­tek, Libor; SmÃ©kalovÃ¡, Monika; VeÄeÅovÃ¡, Renata; KolÃ¡Å, Milan; RÃ¶derovÃ¡, Magdalena; DyÄka, Filip; Å ebela, Marek; Prucek, Robert; Tomanec, OndÅej; ZboÅil, Radek\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSilver nanoparticles have already been successfully applied in various biomedical and antimicrobial technologies and products used in everyday life. Although bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been extensively discussed in the literature, the possible development of resistance to silver nanoparticles has not been fully explored. We report that the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 013, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCM 3955 and E. coli CCM 3954 can develop resistance to silver nanoparticles after repeated exposure. The resistance stems from the production of the adhesive flagellum protein flagellin, which triggers the aggregation of the nanoparticles. This resistance evolves without any genetic changes; only phenotypic change is needed to reduce the nanoparticles' colloidal stability and thus eliminate their antibacterial activity. The resistance mechanism cannot be overcome by additional stabilization of silver nanoparticles using surfactants or polymers. It is, however, strongly suppressed by inhibiting flagellin production with pomegranate rind extract.\n\nTargeting Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) to Overcome Drug Resistance in Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nDu, Bowen; Shim, Joong Sup\n\n2016-07-22\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to play an important role in cancer progression, metastasis and drug resistance. Although there are controversies surrounding the causal relationship between EMT and cancer metastasis, the role of EMT in cancer drug resistance has been increasing"
