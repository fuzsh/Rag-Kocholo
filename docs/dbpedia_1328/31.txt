Walker playing with Utah Jazz; Williams will play with Golden State Warriors in Las Vegas

Former Texas A&M University-Commerce men's basketball standouts Devondrick Walker and Darrell Williams are playing in the 2017 NBA Summer League. Walker is underway in the Utah league on the roster of the Utah Jazz, while Williams will be on the roster of the Golden State Warriors in the Las Vegas league.

The NBA Summer Leagues are off-season competitions during which NBA teams try out different summer rosters instead of their regular season line-ups, typically consisting of a mix of rookies, second year players, and unsigned free agents.

Walker was a second team all-Lone Star Conference honoree for the Lions in 2014 and has been playing in the NBA G-League (formerly D-League) with the West Chester Knicks and Delaware 87ers. In the 2016-17 season, he averaged 12.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game, shooting 46.5 percent from the field and 40.4 percent from three-point range.

Walker and the Jazz are already underway in the Utah league, defeating the San Antonio Spurs in the opening game. Walker scored 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting from the field, including two three-pointers, in 23 minutes of action.

Williams was the LSC Player of the Year, Newcomer of the Year, and first team all-LSC in the 2014-15 season, averaging 18.2 points and 11.9 rebounds per game, leading the league in both categories. He was a First Team All-American and the South Central Region Player of the Year.

Since his time in Commerce, Williams has played in numerous professional leagues overseas. After a stint on the summer league team for the Chicago Bulls in 2015, he signed his first professional contract with VOO Wolves Verviers-Pepinster of the Scooore League in Belgium. In 2016, Williams signed with Serbian club Partizan Belgrade for the rest of the season. In July 2016, Williams signed with Hapoel Tel Aviv of the Israeli Premier League. In April 2017, he signed with Bnei Herzliya, also in Israel.

All remaining Summer League games will be televised, as well as streamed on ESPN3.
