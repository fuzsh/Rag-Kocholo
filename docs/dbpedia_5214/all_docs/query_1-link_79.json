D.W.]\n\nMEMOIRS OF JEAN FRANCOIS PAUL de GONDI, CARDINAL DE RETZ, v3\n\nWritten by Himself\n\nBeing Historic Court Memoirs of the Great Events during the Minority of\n\nLouis XIV. and the Administration of Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nBOOK III.\n\nMADAME:--Cardinal Mazarin thought of nothing else now but how to rid\n\nhimself of the obligations he lay under to the Prince de Conde, who had\n\nactually saved him from the gallows. And his principal view was an\n\nalliance with the House of Vendome, who had on some occasions opposed the\n\ninterest of the family of Conde.\n\nIn Paris the people libelled not only the Cardinal, but the Queen.\n\nIndeed it was not our interest to discourage libels and ballads against\n\nthe Cardinal, but it concerned us to suppress such as were levelled\n\nagainst the Queen and Government. It is not to be imagined what\n\nuneasiness the wrath of the people gave us upon that head. Two\n\ncriminals, one of whom was a printer, being condemned to be hanged for\n\npublishing some things fit to be burnt and for libelling the Queen, cried\n\nout, when they were upon the scaffold, that they were to be put to death\n\nfor publishing verses against Mazarin, upon which the people rescued them\n\nfrom justice.\n\nOn the other hand, some gay young gentlemen of the Court, who were in\n\nMazarin's interest, had a mind to make his name familiar to the\n\nParisians, and for that end made a famous display in the public walks of\n\nthe Tuileries, where they had grand suppers, with music, and drank the\n\nCardinal's health publicly. We took little notice of this, till they\n\nboasted at Saint Germain that the Frondeurs were glad to give them the\n\nwall. And then we thought it high time to correct them, lest the common\n\npeople should think they did it by authority. For this end M. de\n\nBeaufort and a hundred other gentlemen went one night to the house where\n\nthey supped, overturned the table, and broke the musicians' violins over\n\ntheir heads.\n\nBeing informed that the Prince de Conde intended to oblige the King to\n\nreturn to Paris, I was resolved to have all the merit of an action which\n\nwould be so acceptable to the citizens. I therefore resolved to go to\n\nthe Court at Compiegne, which my friends very much opposed, for fear of\n\nthe danger to which I might be exposed, but I told them that what is\n\nabsolutely necessary is not dangerous.\n\nI went accordingly, and as I was going up-stairs to the Queen's\n\napartments, a man, whom I never saw before or since, put a note into my\n\nhand with these words: \"If you enter the King's domicile, you are a dead\n\nman.\" But I was in already, and it was too late to go back. Being past\n\nthe guard-chamber, I thought myself secure. I told the Queen that I was\n\ncome to assure her Majesty of my most humble obedience, and of the\n\ndisposition of the Church of Paris to perform all the services it owed to\n\ntheir Majesties. The Queen seemed highly pleased, and was very kind to\n\nme; but when we mentioned the Cardinal, though she urged me to it,\n\nI excused myself from going to see him, assuring her Majesty that such a\n\nvisit would put it out of my power to do her service. It was impossible\n\nfor her to contain herself any longer; she blushed, and it was with much\n\nrestraint that she forbore using harsh language, as she herself confessed\n\nafterwards.\n\nServien said one day that there was a design to assassinate me at his\n\ntable by the Abbe Fouquet; and M. de Vendome, who had just come from his\n\ntable, pressed me to be gone, saying that there were wicked designs\n\nhatching against me.\n\nI returned to Paris, having accomplished everything I wanted, for I had\n\nremoved the suspicion of the Court that the Frondeurs were against the\n\nKing's return. I threw upon the Cardinal all the odium attending his\n\nMajesty's delay. I braved Mazarin, as it were, upon his throne, and\n\nsecured to myself the chief honour of the King's return.\n\nThe Court was received at Paris as kings always were and ever will be,\n\nnamely, with acclamations, which only please such as like to be\n\nflattered. A group of old women were posted at the entrance of the\n\nsuburbs to cry out, \"God save his Eminence!\" who sat in the King's coach\n\nand thought himself Lord of Paris; but at the end of three or four days\n\nhe found himself much mistaken. Ballads and libels still flew about.\n\nThe Frondeurs appeared bolder than ever. M. de Beaufort and I rode\n\nsometimes alone, with one lackey only behind our coach, and at other\n\ntimes we went with a retinue of fifty men in livery and a hundred\n\ngentlemen. We diversified the scene as we thought it would be most\n\nacceptable to the spectators. The Court party, who blamed us from\n\nmorning to night, nevertheless imitated us in their way. Everybody took\n\nan advantage of the Ministry from our continual pelting of his Eminence.\n\nThe Prince, who always made too much or too little of the Cardinal,\n\ncontinued to treat him with contempt; and, being disgusted at being\n\nrefused the post of Superintendent of the Seas, the Cardinal endeavoured\n\nto soothe him with the vain hopes of other advantages.\n\nThe Prince, being one day at Court, and seeing the Cardinal give himself\n\nextraordinary airs, said, as he was going out of the Queen's cabinet,\n\n\"Adieu, Mars.\" This was told all over the city in a quarter of an hour.\n\nI and Noirmoutier went by appointment to his house at four o'clock in the\n\nmorning, when he seemed to be greatly troubled. He said that he could\n\nnot determine to begin a civil war, which, though the only means to\n\nseparate the Queen from the Cardinal, to whom she was so strongly\n\nattached, yet it was both against his conscience and honour. He added\n\nthat he should never forget his obligations to us, and that if he should\n\ncome to any terms with the Court, he would, if we thought proper, settle\n\nour affairs also, and that if we had not a mind to be reconciled to the\n\nCourt, he would, in case it did attack us, publicly undertake our\n\nprotection. We answered that we had no other design in our proposals\n\nthan the honour of being his humble servants, and that we should be very\n\nsorry if he had retarded his reconciliation with the Queen upon our\n\naccount, praying that we might be permitted to continue in the same\n\ndisposition towards the Cardinal as we were then, which we declared\n\nshould not hinder us from paying all the respect and duty which we\n\nprofessed for his Highness.\n\nI must not forget to acquaint you that Madame de Guemenee, who ran away\n\nfrom Paris in a fright the moment it was besieged, no sooner heard that I\n\nhad paid a visit to Mademoiselle de Chevreuse than she returned to town\n\nin a rage. I was in such a passion with her for having cowardly deserted\n\nme that I took her by the throat, and she was so enraged at my\n\nfamiliarity with Mademoiselle de Chevreuse that she threw a candlestick\n\nat my head, but in a quarter of an hour we were very good friends.\n\nThe Prince de Conde was no sooner reconciled with the Court than he was\n\npublicly reproached in the city for breaking his word with the Frondeurs;\n\nbut I convinced him that he could not think such treatment strange in a\n\ncity so justly exasperated against Mazarin, and that, nevertheless, he\n\nmight depend on my best services, for which he assured me of his constant\n\nfriendship.\n\nMoissans, now Marechal d'Albret, who was at the head of the King's\n\ngendarmes, accustomed himself and others to threaten the chief minister,\n\nwho augmented the public odium against himself by reestablishing Emeri,\n\na man detested by all the kingdom. We were not a little alarmed at his\n\nreestablishment, because this man, who knew Paris better than the\n\nCardinal, distributed money among the people to a very good purpose.\n\nThis is a singular science, which is either very beneficial or hurtful in\n\nits consequences, according to the wisdom or folly of the distributor.\n\nThese donations, laid out with discretion and secrecy, obliged us to\n\nyield ourselves more and more unto the bulk of the people, and, finding a\n\nfit opportunity for this performance, we took care not to let it slip,\n\nwhich, if they had been ruled by me, we should not have done so soon, for\n\nwe were not yet forced to make use of such expedients. It is not safe in\n\na faction where you are only upon the defensive to do what you are not\n\npressed to do, but the uneasiness of the subalterns on such occasions is\n\ntroublesome, because they believe that as soon as you seem to be inactive\n\nall is lost. I preached every day that the way was yet rough, and\n\ntherefore must be made plain, and that patience in the present case was\n\nproductive of greater effects than activity; but nobody comprehended the\n\ntruth of what I said.\n\nAn unlucky expression, dropped on this occasion by the Princesse de\n\nGuemenee, had an incredible influence upon the people. She called to\n\nmind a ballad formerly made upon the regiment of Brulon, which was said\n\nto consist of only two dragoons and four drummers, and, inasmuch as she\n\nhated the Fronde, she told me very pleasantly that our party, being\n\nreduced to fourteen, might be justly compared to that regiment of Brulon.\n\nNoirmoutier and Laigues were offended at this expression to that degree\n\nthat they continually murmured because I neither settled affairs nor\n\npushed them to the last extremity. Upon which I observed that heads of\n\nfactions are no longer their masters when they are unable either to\n\nprevent or allay the murmurs of the people.\n\nThe revenues of the Hotel de Ville, which are, as it were, the patrimony\n\nof the bourgeois, and which, if well managed, might be of special service\n\nto the King in securing to his interest an infinite number of those\n\npeople who are always the most formidable in revolutions--this sacred\n\nfund, I say, suffered much by the licentiousness of the times, the\n\nignorance of Mazarin, and the prevarication of the officers of the Hotel\n\nde Ville, who were his dependents, so that the poor annuitants met in\n\ngreat numbers at the Hotel de Ville; but as such assemblies without the\n\nPrince's authority are reckoned illegal, the Parliament passed a decree\n\nto suppress them. They were privately countenanced by M. de Beaufort and\n\nme, to whom they sent a solemn deputation, and they made choice of twelve\n\nsyndics to be a check upon the 'prevot des marchands'.\n\nOn the 11th of December a pistol, as had been concerted beforehand, was\n\nfired into the coach of Joly, one of the syndics, which President\n\nCharton, another of the syndics, thinking was aimed at himself, the\n\nMarquis de la Boulaie ran as if possessed with a devil, while the\n\nParliament was sitting, into the middle of the Great Hall, with fifteen\n\nor twenty worthless fellows crying out \"To Arms!\" He did the like in the\n\nstreets, but in vain, and came to Broussel and me; but the former\n\nreprimanded him after his way, and I threatened to throw him out at the\n\nwindow, for I had reason to believe that he acted in concert with the\n\nCardinal, though he pretended to be a Frondeur.\n\nThis artifice of Servien united the Prince to the Cardinal, because he\n\nfound himself obliged to defend himself against the Frondeurs, who, as he\n\nbelieved, sought to assassinate him. All those that were his own\n\ncreatures thought they were not zealous enough for his service if they\n\ndid not exaggerate the imminent danger he had escaped, and the Court\n\nparasites confounded the morning adventure with that at night; and upon\n\nthis coarse canvas they daubed all that the basest flattery, blackest\n\nimposture, and the most ridiculous credulity was capable of imagining;\n\nand we were informed the next morning that it was the common rumour over\n\nall the city that we had formed a design of seizing the King's person and\n\ncarrying him to the Hotel de Ville, and to assassinate the Prince.\n\nM. de Beaufort and I agreed to go out and show ourselves to the people,\n\nwhom we found in such a consternation that I believed the Court might\n\nthen have attacked us with success. Madame de Montbazon advised us to\n\ntake post-horses and ride off, saying that there was nothing more easy\n\nthan to destroy us, because we had put ourselves into the hands of our\n\nsworn enemies. I said that we had better hazard our lives than our\n\nhonour. To which she replied, \"It is not that, but your nymphs, I\n\nbelieve, which keep you here\" (meaning Mesdames de Chevreuse and\n\nGuemenee). \"I expect,\" she said, \"to be befriended for my own sake, and\n\ndon't I deserve it? I cannot conceive how you can be amused by a wicked\n\nold hag and a girl, if possible, still more foolish. We are continually\n\ndisputing about that silly wretch\" (pointing to M. de Beaufort, who was\n\nplaying chess); \"let us take him with us and go to Peronne.\"\n\nYou are not to wonder that she talked thus contemptibly of M. de\n\nBeaufort, whom she always taxed with impotency, for it is certain that\n\nhis love was purely Platonic, as he never asked any favour of her, and\n\nseemed very uneasy with her for eating flesh on Fridays. She was so\n\nsweet upon me, and withal such a charming beauty, that, being naturally\n\nindisposed to let such opportunities slip, I was melted into tenderness\n\nfor her, notwithstanding my suspicions of her, considering the then\n\nsituation of affairs, and would have had her go with me into the cabinet,\n\nbut she was determined first to go to Peronne, which put an end to our\n\namours.\n\nBeaufort waited on the Prince and was well received, but I could not gain\n\nadmittance.\n\nOn the 14th the Prince de Conde went to Parliament and demanded that a\n\ncommittee might be appointed to inquire into the attempt made on his\n\nlife.\n\nThe Frondeurs were not asleep in the meantime, yet most of our friends\n\nwere dispirited, and all very weak.\n\nThe cures of Paris were my most hearty friends; they laboured with\n\nincredible zeal among the people. And the cure of Saint Gervais sent me\n\nthis message: \"Do but rally again and get off the assassination, and in a\n\nweek you will be stronger than your enemies.\"\n\nI was informed that the Queen had written to my uncle, the Archbishop of\n\nParis, to be sure to go to the Parliament on the 23d, the day that\n\nBeaufort, Broussel, and I were to be impeached, because I had no right to\n\nsit in the House if he were present. I begged of him not to go, but my\n\nuncle being a man of little sense, and that much out of order, and being,\n\nmoreover, fearful and ridiculously jealous of me, had promised the Queen\n\nto go; and all that we could get out of him was that he would defend me\n\nin Parliament better than I could defend myself. It is to be observed\n\nthat though he chattered to us like a magpie in private, yet in public he\n\nwas as mute as a fish. A surgeon who was in the Archbishop's service,\n\ngoing to visit him, commended him for his courage in resisting the\n\nimportunities of his nephew, who, said he, had a mind to bury him alive,\n\nand encouraged him to rise with all haste and go to the Parliament House;\n\nbut he was no sooner out of his bed than the surgeon asked him in a\n\nfright how he felt. \"Very well,\" said my Lord. \"But that is\n\nimpossible,\" said the surgeon; \"you look like death,\" and feeling his\n\npulse, he told him he was in a high fever; upon which my Lord Archbishop\n\nwent to bed again, and all the kings and queens in Christendom could not\n\nget him out for a fortnight.\n\nWe went to the Parliament, and found there the Princes with nearly a\n\nthousand gentlemen and, I may say, the whole Court. I had few salutes in\n\nthe Hall, because it was generally thought I was an undone man. When I\n\nhad entered the Great Chamber I heard a hum like that at the end of a\n\npleasing period in a sermon. When I had taken my place I said that,\n\nhearing we were taxed with a seditious conspiracy, we were come to offer\n\nour heads to the Parliament if guilty, and if innocent, to demand justice\n\nupon our accusers; and that though I knew not what right the Court had to\n\ncall me to account, yet I would renounce all privileges to make my\n\ninnocence apparent to a body for whom I always had the greatest\n\nattachment and veneration.\n\nThen the informations were read against what they called \"the public\n\nconspiracy from which it had pleased Almighty God to deliver the State\n\nand the royal family,\" after which I made a speech, in substance as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"I do not believe, gentlemen, that in any of the past ages persons of our\n\nquality had ever received any personal summons grounded merely upon\n\nhearsay. Neither can I think that posterity will ever believe that this\n\nhearsay evidence was admitted from the mouths of the most infamous\n\nmiscreants that ever got out of a gaol. Canto was condemned to the\n\ngallows at Pau, Pichon to the wheel at Mans, Sociande is a rogue upon\n\nrecord. Pray, gentlemen, judge of their evidence by their character and\n\nprofession. But this is not all. They have the distinguishing character\n\nof being informers by authority. I am sorely grieved that the defence of\n\nour honour, which is enjoined us by the laws of God and man, should\n\noblige me to expose to light, under the most innocent of Kings, such\n\nabominations as were detested in the most corrupt ages of antiquity and\n\nunder the worst of tyrants. But I must tell you that Canto, Sociande,\n\nand Gorgibus are authorised to inform against us by a commission signed\n\nby that august name which should never be employed but for the\n\npreservation of the most sacred laws, and which Cardinal Mazarin, who\n\nknows no law but that of revenge, which he meditates against the\n\ndefenders of the public liberty, has forced M. Tellier, Secretary of\n\nState, to countersign.\n\n\"We demand justice, gentlemen, but we do not demand it of you till we\n\nhave first most humbly implored this House to execute the strictest\n\njustice that the laws have provided against rebels, if it appears that we\n\nhave been concerned directly or indirectly in raising this last\n\ndisturbance. Is it possible, gentlemen, that a grandchild of Henri the\n\nGreat, that a senator of M. Broussel's age and probity, and that the\n\nCoadjutor of Paris should be so much as suspected of being concerned in a\n\nsedition raised by a hot-brained fool, at the head of fifteen of the\n\nvilest of the mob? I am fully persuaded it would be scandalous for me to\n\ninsist longer on this subject. This is all I know, gentlemen, of the\n\nmodern conspiracy.\"\n\nThe applause that came from the Court of Inquiry was deafening; many\n\nvoices were heard exclaiming against spies and informers. Honest Doujat,\n\nwho was one of the persons appointed by the Attorney-General Talon, his\n\nkinsman, to make the report, and who had acquainted me with the facts,\n\nacknowledged it publicly by pretending to make the thing appear less\n\nodious. He got up, therefore, as if he were in a passion, and spoke very\n\nartfully to this purpose:\n\n\"These witnesses, monsieur, are not to accuse you, as you are pleased to\n\nsay, but only to discover what passed in the meeting of the annuitants at\n\nthe Hotel de Ville. If the King did not promise impunity to such as will\n\ngive him information necessary for his service, and which sometimes\n\ncannot be come at without involving evidence in a crime, how should the\n\nKing be informed at all? There is a great deal of difference between\n\npatents of this nature and commissions granted on purpose to accuse you.\"\n\nYou might have seen fire in 'the face of every member. The First\n\nPresident called out \"Order!\" and said, \"MM. de Beaufort, le Coadjuteur,\n\nand Broussel, you are accused, and you must withdraw.\"\n\nAs Beaufort and I were leaving our seats, Broussel stopped us, saying,\n\n\"Neither you, gentlemen, nor I are bound to depart till we are ordered to\n\ndo so by the Court. The First President, whom all the world knows to be\n\nour adversary, should go out if we must.\"\n\nI added, \"And M. le Prince,\" who thereupon said, with a scornful air:\n\n\"What, I? Must I retire?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, monsieur,\" said I, \"justice is no respecter of persons.\"\n\nThe President de Mesmes said, \"No, monseigneur, you must not go out\n\nunless the Court orders you. If the Coadjutor insists that your Highness\n\nretire, he must demand it by a petition. As for himself, he is accused,\n\nand therefore must go out; but, seeing he raises difficulties and\n\nobjections to the contrary, we must put it to the vote.\" And it was\n\npassed that we should withdraw.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the members passed encomiums upon us, satires upon the\n\nMinistry, and anathemas upon the witnesses for the Crown. Nor were the\n\ncures and the parishioners wanting in their duty on this occasion. The\n\npeople came in shoals from all parts of Paris to the Parliament House.\n\nNevertheless, no disrespect was shown either to the King's brother or to\n\nM. le Prince; only some in their presence cried out, \"God bless M. de\n\nBeaufort! God bless the Coadjutor!\"\n\nM. de Beaufort told the First President next day that, the State and\n\nroyal family being in danger, every moment was precious, and that the\n\noffenders ought to receive condign punishment, and that therefore the\n\nChambers ought to be assembled without loss of time. Broussel attacked\n\nthe First President with a great deal of warmth. Eight or ten\n\ncouncillors entered immediately into the Great Chamber to testify their\n\nastonishment at the indolence and indifference of the House after such a\n\nfurious conspiracy, and that so little zeal was shown to prosecute the\n\ncriminals. MM. de Bignon and Talon, counsel for the Crown, alarmed the\n\npeople by declaring that as for themselves they had no hand in the\n\nconclusions, which were ridiculous. The First President returned very\n\ncalm answers, knowing well that we should have been glad to have put him\n\ninto a passion in order to catch at some expression that might bear an\n\nexception in law.\n\nOn Christmas Day I preached such a sermon on Christian charity, without\n\nmentioning the present affairs, that the women even wept for the unjust\n\npersecution of an archbishop who had so great a tenderness for his very\n\nenemies.\n\nOn the 29th M. de Beaufort and I went to the Parliament House,\n\naccompanied by a body of three hundred gentlemen, to make it appear that\n\nwe were more than tribunes of the people, and to screen ourselves from\n\nthe insults of the Court party. We posted ourselves in the Fourth\n\nChamber of the Inquests, among the courtiers, with whom we conversed very\n\nfrankly, yet upon the least noise, when the debates ran high in the Great\n\nChamber, we were ready to cut one another's throats eight or ten times\n\nevery morning. We were all distrustful of one another, and I may venture\n\nto say there were not twenty persons in the House but were armed with\n\ndaggers. As for myself, I had resolved to take none of those weapons\n\ninconsistent with my character, till one day, when it was expected the\n\nHouse would be more excited than usual, and then M. de Beaufort, seeing\n\none end of the weapon peeping out of my pocket, exposed it to M. le\n\nPrince's captain of the guards and others, saying, \"See, gentlemen, the\n\nCoadjutor's prayer-book.\" I understood the jest, but really I could not\n\nwell digest it. We petitioned the Parliament that the First President,\n\nbeing our sworn enemy, might be expelled the House, but it was put to the\n\nvote and carried by a majority of thirty-six that he should retain his\n\nstation of judge.\n\nParis narrowly escaped a commotion at the time of the imprisonment of\n\nBelot, one of the syndics of the Hotel de Ville annuitants, who, being\n\narrested without a decree, President de la Grange made it appear that\n\nthere was nothing more contrary to the declaration for which they had\n\nformerly so exerted themselves. The First President maintaining the\n\nlegality of his imprisonment, Daurat, a councillor of the Third Chamber,\n\ntold him that he was amazed that a gentleman who was so lately near being\n\nexpelled could be so resolute in violating the laws so flagrantly.\n\nWhereupon the First President rose in a passion, saying that there was\n\nneither order nor discipline in the House, and that he would resign his\n\nplace to another for whom they had more respect. This motion put the\n\nGreat Chamber all in a ferment, which was felt in the Fourth, where the\n\ngentlemen of both parties hastened to support their respective sides, and\n\nif the most insignificant lackey had then but drawn a sword, Paris would\n\nhave been all in an uproar.\n\nWe solicited very earnestly for our trial, which they delayed as much as\n\nit was in their power, because they could not choose but acquit us and\n\ncondemn the Crown witnesses. Various were the pretences for putting it\n\noff, and though the informations were not of sufficient weight to hang a\n\ndog, yet they were read over and over at every turn to prolong the time.\n\nThe public began to be persuaded of our innocence, as also the Prince de\n\nConde, and M. de Bouillon told me that he very much suspected it to be a\n\ntrick of the Cardinal's.\n\nOn the 1st of January, 1650, Madame de Chevreuse, having a mind to visit\n\nthe Queen, with whom she had carried on in all her disgrace an\n\nunaccountable correspondence, went to the King's Palace. The Cardinal,\n\ntaking her aside in the Queen's little cabinet, said to her:\n\n\"You love the Queen. Is it not possible for you to make your friends\n\nlove her?\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" said she; \"the Queen is no more a Queen, but a humble\n\nservant to M. le Prince.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" replied the Cardinal; \"we might do great things if we could\n\nget some men into our interest. But M. de Beaufort is at the service of\n\nMadame de Montbazon, and she is devoted to Vigneul and the Coadjutor; \"\n\nat the mention of which he smiled. \"I take you, monsieur,\" said Madame\n\nde Chevreuse; \"I will answer for him and for her.\"\n\nThus the conversation began, and the Cardinal making a sign to the Queen,\n\nMadame de Chevreuse had a long conference that night with her Majesty,\n\nwho gave her this billet for me, written and signed with her own hand:\n\nNotwithstanding what has passed and what is now doing, I cannot but\n\npersuade myself that M. le Coadjuteur is in my interest. I desire\n\nto see him, and that nobody may know it but Madame and Mademoiselle\n\nde Chevreuse. This name shall be your security.\n\nANNE\n\nBeing convinced that the Queen was downright angry with the Prince de\n\nConde on account of a rumour spread abroad that he had some intriguing\n\ngallantries with her Majesty, I weighed all circumstances and returned\n\nthe answer to the Queen:\n\nNever was there one moment of my life wherein I was not devoted to\n\nyour Majesty. I am so far from consulting my own safety that I\n\nwould gladly die for your service . . . I will go to any place\n\nyour Majesty shall order me.\n\nMy answer, with the Queen's letter enclosed, was carried back by Madame\n\nde Chevreuse and well received. I went immediately to Court, and was\n\ntaken up the back staircase by the Queen's train-bearer to the petit\n\noratoire, where her Majesty was shut up all alone. She showed me as much\n\nkindness as she could, considering her hatred against M. le Prince and\n\nher friendship for the Cardinal, though the latter seemed the more to\n\nprevail, because in speaking of the civil wars and of the Cardinal's\n\nfriendship for me she called him \"the poor Cardinal\" twenty times over.\n\nHalf an hour after, the Cardinal came in, who begged the Queen to\n\ndispense with the respect he owed her Majesty while he embraced me in her\n\npresence. He was pleased to say he was very sorry that he could not give\n\nme that very moment his own cardinal's cap. He talked so much of\n\nfavours, gratifications, and rewards that I was obliged to explain\n\nmyself, knowing that nothing is more destructive of new reconciliations\n\nthan a seeming unwillingness to be obliged to those to whom you are\n\nreconciled. I answered that the greatest recompense I could expect,\n\nthough I had saved the Crown, was to have the honour of serving her\n\nMajesty, and I humbly prayed the Queen to give me no other recompense,\n\nthat at least I might have the satisfaction to make her Majesty sensible\n\nthat this was the only reward I valued.\n\nThe Cardinal desired the Queen to command me to accept of the nomination\n\nto the cardinalate, \"which,\" said he, \"La Riviere has snatched with\n\ninsolence and acknowledged with treachery.\" I excused myself by saying\n\nthat I had taken a resolution never to accept of the cardinalship by any\n\nmeans which seemed to have relation to the civil wars, to the end that I\n\nmight convince the Queen that it was the most rigid necessity which had\n\nseparated me from her service. I rejected upon the same account all the\n\nother advantageous propositions he made me, and, he still insisting that\n\nthe Queen could do no less than confer upon me something that was very\n\nconsiderable for the signal service I was likely to do her Majesty, I\n\nanswered:\n\n\"There is one point wherein the Queen can do me more good than if she\n\ngave me a triple crown. Her Majesty told me just now that she will cause\n\nM. le Prince to be apprehended. A person of his high rank and merit\n\nneither can nor ought to be always shut up in prison, for when he comes\n\nabroad he will be full of resentment against me, though I hope my dignity\n\nwill be my protection. There are a great many gentlemen engaged with me\n\nwho, in such a juncture, would be ready to serve the Queen. And if it\n\nseemed good to your Majesty to entrust one of them with some important\n\nemployment, I should be more pleased than with ten cardinals' hats.\"\n\nThe Cardinal told the Queen that nothing was more just, and the affair\n\nshould be considered between him and me.\n\nWe had several conferences, at which we agreed on gratifications for some\n\nof our friends and to arrest the Prince de Conde, the Prince de Conti,\n\nand the Duc de Longueville.\n\nThe Cardinal took occasion to speak of the treachery of La Riviere.\n\n\"This man,\" said he, \"takes me to be the most stupid creature living, and\n\nthinks he shall be to-morrow a cardinal. I diverted myself to-day with\n\nletting him try on some scarlet cloth I lately received from Italy, and I\n\nput it near his face to know whether a scarlet colour or carnation became\n\nhim best.\"\n\nI heard from Rome that his Eminence was not behindhand with La Riviere\n\nupon the score of treachery. For on the very day he got him nominated by\n\nthe King, he wrote a letter to Cardinal Sachelli more fit to recommend\n\nhim to a yellow cap than to a red one. This letter, nevertheless, was\n\nfull of tenderness for La Riviere, which Mazarin knew was the only way to\n\nruin him with Pope Innocent, who hated Mazarin and all his adherents.\n\nMadame de Chevreuse undertook to see how the Duc d'Orleans would relish\n\nthe design of imprisoning the Princes. She told him that, though the\n\nQueen was not satisfied with M. le Prince, yet she could not form a\n\nresolution of apprehending him without the concurrence of his Royal\n\nHighness. She magnified the advantages of bringing over to the King's\n\nservice the powerful faction of the Fronde, and the daily dangers Paris\n\nwas exposed to, both by fire and sword. This last reason touched him as\n\nmuch or more than all, for he trembled every time he came to the\n\nParliament; M. le Prince very often could not prevail upon him to go at\n\nall, and a fit of colic was generally assigned as the reason of his\n\nabsence. At length he consented, and on the 18th of January the three\n\nPrinces were put under arrest by three officers of the Queen's Guards.\n\nThe people having a notion that M. de Beaufort was apprehended, ran to\n\ntheir arms, which I caused to be laid down immediately, by marching\n\nthrough the streets with flambeaux before me. M. de Beaufort did the\n\nlike, and the night concluded with bonfires.\n\nThe Queen sent a letter from the King to the Parliament with the reasons,\n\nwhich were neither strong nor well set out, why the Prince de Conde was\n\nconfined. However, we obtained a decree for our absolution.\n\nThe Princesses were ordered to retire to Chantilly. Madame de\n\nLongueville went towards Normandy, but found no sanctuary there, for the\n\nParliament of Rouen sent her a message to desire her to depart from the\n\ncity. The Duc de Richelieu would not receive her into Havre, and from\n\nthere she retired to Dieppe.\n\nM. de Bouillon, who after the peace was strongly attached to the Prince\n\nde Conde, went in great haste to Turenne; M. de Turenne got into Stenai;\n\nM. de La Rochefoucault, then Prince de Marsillac, returned home to\n\nPoitou; and Marechal de Breze, father-in-law to the Prince de Conde, went\n\nto Saumur.\n\nThere was a declaration published and registered in Parliament against\n\nthem, whereby they were ordered to wait on the King within fifteen days,\n\nupon pain of being proceeded against as disturbers of the public peace\n\nand guilty of high treason.\n\nThe Court carried all before them. Madame de Longueville, upon the King\n\ngoing into Normandy, escaped by sea into Holland, whence she went\n\nafterwards to Arras, to try La Tour, one of her husband's pensioners, who\n\noffered her his person, but refused her the place. She repaired at last\n\nto Stenai, whither M. de Turenne went to meet her, with all the friends\n\nand servants of the confined Princes that he could muster. The King went\n\nfrom Normandy to Burgundy, and returned to Paris crowned with laurels of\n\nvictory.\n\nThe Princess-dowager, who had been ordered to retire to Bourges, came\n\nwith a petition to Parliament, praying for their protection to stay in\n\nParis, and that she might have justice done her for the illegal\n\nconfinement of the Princes her children. She fell at the feet of the Duc\n\nd'Orleans, begged the protection of the Duc de Beaufort, and said to me\n\nthat she had the honour to be my kinswoman. M. de Beaufort was very much\n\nperplexed what to do, and I was nearly ready to die for shame; but we\n\ncould do nothing for her, and she was obliged to go to Valery.\n\nSeveral private annuitants, who had made a noise in the assemblies at the\n\nHotel de Ville, were afraid of being called to account, and therefore,\n\nafter M. le Prince was arrested, they desired me to procure a general\n\namnesty. I spoke about it to the Cardinal, who seemed very pliable, and,\n\nshowing me his hatband, which was 'a la mode de la Fronde', said he hoped\n\nhimself to be comprised in that amnesty; but he shuffled it off so long\n\nthat it was not published and registered in Parliament till the 12th of\n\nMay, and it would not have been obtained then had not I threatened\n\nvigorously to prosecute the Crown witnesses, of which they were mightily\n\napprehensive, being so conscious of the heinousness of their crime that\n\ntwo of them had already made their escape.\n\nThe present calm hardly deserved that name, for the storm of war began to\n\nrise again in several places at once.\n\nMadame de Longueville and M. de Turenne made a treaty with the Spaniards,\n\nand the latter joined their army, which entered Picardy and besieged\n\nGuise, after having taken Catelet; but for want of provisions the\n\nArchduke was obliged to raise the siege. M. de Turenne levied troops\n\nwith Spanish money, and was joined by the greater part of the officers\n\ncommanding the soldiers that went under the name of the Prince's troops.\n\nThe wretched conduct of M. d'Epernon had so confounded the affairs of\n\nGuienne that nothing but his removal could retrieve them.\n\nOne of the greatest mischiefs which the despotic authority of ministers\n\nhas occasioned in the world in these later times is a practice,\n\noccasioned by their own private mistaken interests, of always supporting\n\nsuperiors against their inferiors. It is a maxim borrowed from\n\nMachiavelli, whom few understand, and whom too many cry up for an able\n\nman because he was always wicked. He was very far from being a complete\n\nstatesman, and was frequently out in his politics, but I think never more\n\ngrossly mistaken than in this maxim, which I observed as a great weakness\n\nin Mazarin, who was therefore the less qualified to settle the affairs of\n\nGuienne, which were in so much confusion that I believe if the good sense\n\nof Jeannin and Villeroi had been infused into the brains of Cardinal de\n\nRichelieu, it would not have been sufficient to set them right.\n\nSenneterre, perceiving that Cardinal Mazarin and I were not cordial\n\nfriends, undertook to reconcile us, and for that end took me to the\n\nCardinal, who embraced me very tenderly, said he laid his heart upon the\n\ntable, that was one of his usual phrases,--and protested he would talk as\n\nfreely to me as if I were his own son. I did not believe a word of what\n\nhe said, but I assured his Eminence that I would speak to him as if he\n\nwere my father, and I was as good as my word. I told him I had no\n\npersonal interest in view but to disengage myself from the public\n\ndisturbances without any private advantage, and that for the same reason\n\nI thought myself obliged to come off with reputation and honour.\n\nI desired him to consider that my age and want of skill in public affairs\n\ncould not give him any jealousy that I aimed to be the First Minister.\n\nI conjured him to consider also that the influence I had over the people\n\nof Paris, supported by mere necessity, did rather reflect disgrace than\n\nhonour upon my dignity, and that he ought to believe that this one reason\n\nwas enough to make me impatient to be rid of all these public broils,\n\nbesides a thousand other inconveniences arising every moment, which\n\ndisgusted me with faction. And as for the dignity of cardinal, which\n\nmight peradventure give him some umbrage, I could tell him very sincerely\n\nwhat had been and what was still my notion of this dignity, which I once\n\nfoolishly imagined would be more honourable for me to despise than to\n\nenjoy. I mentioned this circumstance to let him see that in my tender\n\nyears I was no admirer of the purple, and not very fond of it now,\n\nbecause I was persuaded that an Archbishop of Paris could hardly miss\n\nobtaining that dignity some time or other, according to form, by actions\n\npurely ecclesiastical; and that he should be loth to use any other means\n\nto procure it.\n\nI said that I should be extremely sorry if my purple were stained with\n\nthe least drop of blood spilt in the civil wars; that I was resolved to\n\nclear my hands of everything that savoured of intrigue before I would\n\nmake or suffer any step which had any tendency that way; that he knew\n\nthat for the same reason I would neither accept money nor abbeys, and\n\nthat, consequently, I was engaged by the public declarations I had made\n\nupon all those heads to serve the Queen without any interest; that the\n\nonly end I had in view, and in which I never wavered, was to come off\n\nwith honour, so that I might resume the spiritual functions belonging to\n\nmy profession with safety; that I desired nothing from him but the\n\naccomplishment of an affair which would be more for the King's service\n\nthan for my particular interest; that he knew that the day after the\n\narrest of the Prince he sent me with his promise to the annuitants of the\n\nHotel de Ville, and that for want of performance those men were persuaded\n\nthat I was in concert with the Court to deceive them. Lastly, I told him\n\nthat the access I had to the Duc d'Orleans might perhaps give him\n\numbrage, but I desired him to consider that I never sought that honour,\n\nand that I was very sensible of the inconveniences attending it.\n\nI enlarged upon this head, which is the most difficult point to be\n\nunderstood by Prime Ministers, who are so fond of being freely admitted\n\ninto a Prince's presence that, notwithstanding all the experience in the\n\nworld, they cannot help thinking that therein consists the essence of\n\nhappiness.\n\nWhen truth has come to a certain point, it darts such powerful rays of\n\nlight as are irresistible, but I never knew a man who had so little\n\nregard for truth as Mazarin. He seemed, however, more regardful of it\n\nthan usual, and I laid hold of the occasion to tell him of the dangerous\n\nconsequences of the disturbances of Guienne, and that if he continued to\n\nsupport M. d'Epernon, the Prince's faction would not let this opportunity\n\nslip; that if the Parliament of Bordeaux should engage in their party,\n\nit would not be long before that of Paris would do the same; that, after\n\nthe late conflagration in this metropolis, he could not suppose but that\n\nthere was still some fire hidden under the ashes; and that the factious\n\nparty had reason to fear the heavy punishment to which the whole body of\n\nthem was liable, as we ourselves were two or three months ago. The\n\nCardinal began to yield, especially when he was told that M. de Bouillon\n\nbegan to make a disturbance in the Limousin, where M. de La Rochefoucault\n\nhad joined him with some troops.\n\nTo confirm our reconciliation, a marriage was proposed between my niece\n\nand his nephew, to which he, gave his consent; but I was much averse to\n\nit, being not yet resolved to bury my family in that of Mazarin, nor did\n\nI set so great a value on grandeur as to purchase it with the public\n\nodium. However, it produced no animosity on either side, and his friends\n\nknew that I should be very glad to be employed in making a general peace;\n\nthey acted their parts so well that the Cardinal, whose love-fit for me\n\nlasted about a fortnight, promised me, as it were of his own accord, that\n\nI should be gratified.\n\nNews came about this time from Guienne that the Ducs de Bouillon and de\n\nLa Rochefoucault had taken Madame la Princesse into Bordeaux, together\n\nwith M. le Duc, her son. The Parliament was not displeased with the\n\npeople for receiving into their city M. le Duc, yet they observed more\n\ndecorum than could be expected from the inhabitants of Gascogne, so\n\nirritated as they were against M. d'Epernon. They ordered that Madame la\n\nPrincesse, M. le Duc, MM. de Bouillon and de La Rochefoucault should have\n\nliberty to stay in Bordeaux, provided they would promise to undertake\n\nnothing against the King's service, and that the petition of Madame la\n\nPrincesse should be sent to the King with a most humble remonstrance from\n\nthe Parliament against the confinement of the Princes.\n\nAt the same time, one of the Presidents sent word to Senneterre that the\n\nParliament was not so far enraged but that they would still remember\n\ntheir loyalty to the King, provided he did but remove M. d'Epernon. But\n\nin case of any further delay he would not answer for the Parliament, and\n\nmuch less for the people, who, being now managed and supported by the\n\nPrince's party, would in a little time make themselves masters of the\n\nParliament. Senneterre did what he could to induce the Cardinal to make\n\ngood use of this advice, and M. de Chateauneuf, who was now Chancellor,\n\ntalked wonderfully well upon the point, but seeing the Cardinal gave no\n\nreturn to his reasons but by exclaiming against the Parliament of\n\nBordeaux for sheltering men condemned by the King's declaration, he said\n\nto him very plainly, \"Set out to-morrow, monsieur, if you do not arrange\n\nmatters to-day; you should have been by this time upon the Garonne.\"\n\nThe event proved that Chateauneuf was in the right, for though the\n\nParliament was very excited, they stood out a long time against the\n\nmadness of the people, spurred on by M. de Bouillon, and issued a decree\n\nordering an envoy of Spain, who was sent thither to commence a treaty\n\nwith the Duc de Bouillon, to depart the city, and forbade any of their\n\nbody to visit such as had correspondence with Spain, the Princess herself\n\nnot excepted. Moreover, the mob having undertaken to force the\n\nParliament to unite with the Princes, the Parliament armed the\n\nmagistracy, who fired upon the people and made them retire.\n\nA little time before the King departed for Guienne, which was in the\n\nbeginning of July, word came that the Parliament of Bordeaux had\n\nconsented to a union with the Princes, and had sent a deputy to the\n\nParliament of Paris, who had orders to see neither the King nor the\n\nministers, and that the whole province was disposed for a revolt. The\n\nCardinal was in extreme consternation, and commended himself to the\n\nfavour of the meanest man of the Fronde with the greatest suppleness\n\nimaginable.\n\nAs soon as the King came to the neighbourhood of Bordeaux the deputies of\n\nParliament, who went to meet the Court at Lebourne, were peremptorily\n\ncommanded to open the gates of the city to the King and to all his\n\ntroops. They answered that one of their privileges was to guard the King\n\nthemselves while he was in any of their towns. Upon this, Marechal de La\n\nMeilleraye seized the castle of Vaire, in the command of Pichon, whom the\n\nCardinal ordered to be hanged; and M. de Bouillon hanged an officer in\n\nMeilleraye's army by way of reprisal.\n\nAfter that the Marshal besieged the city in form, which, despairing of\n\nsuccour from Spain, was forced to capitulate upon the following terms:\n\nThat a general pardon should be granted to all who had taken up arms and\n\ntreated with Spain, that all the soldiers should be disbanded except\n\nthose whom the King had a mind to keep in his pay, that Madame la\n\nPrincesse and the Duke should be at liberty to reside either in Anjou or\n\nat Mouzon, with no more than two hundred foot and sixty horse, and that\n\nM. d'Epernon should be recalled from the government of Guienne.\n\nThe Princess had an interview with both the King and Queen, at which\n\nthere were great conferences between the Cardinal and the Ducs de\n\nBouillon and de La Rochefoucault.\n\nThe deputy from Bordeaux, arriving at Paris soon after the King's\n\ndeparture, went immediately, to Parliament, and, after an eloquent\n\nharangue, presented a letter from the Parliament of Bordeaux, together\n\nwith their decrees, and demanded a union between the two Parliaments.\n\nAfter some debates it was resolved that the deputy should deliver his\n\ncredentials in writing, which should be presented to his Majesty by the\n\ndeputies of the Parliament of Paris, who would, at the same time, most\n\nhumbly beseech the Queen to restore peace to Guienne.\n\nThe Duc d'Orleans was against debating about the petition to the Queen\n\nfor the liberation of the Priuces and the banishment of Cardinal Mazarin;\n\nnevertheless, many of the members voted for it, upon a motion made by the\n\nPresident Viole, who was a warm partisan of the Prince de Conde, not\n\nbecause he had hopes of carrying it, but on purpose to embarrass M. de\n\nBeaufort and myself upon a subject of which we did not care to speak, and\n\nyet did not dare to be altogether silent about, without passing in some\n\nmeasure for Mazarinists. President Viole did the Prince a great deal of\n\nservice on this occasion, for Bourdet a brave soldier, who had been\n\ncaptain of the Guards and was attached to the interest of the Prince--\n\nperformed an action which emboldened the party very much, though it had\n\nno success. He dressed himself and fourscore other officers of his\n\ntroops in mason's clothes, and having assembled many of the dregs of the\n\npeople, to whom he had distributed money, came directly to the Duc\n\nd'Orleans as he was going out, and cried, \"No Mazarin! God bless the\n\nPrinces!\" His Royal Highness, at this apparition and the firing of a\n\nbrace of pistols at the same time by Bourdet, ran to the Great Chamber;\n\nbut M. de Beaufort stood his ground so well with the Duke's guards and\n\nour men, that Bourdet was repulsed and thrown down the Parliament stairs.\n\nBut the confusion in the Great Chamber was still worse. There were daily\n\nassemblies, wherein the Cardinal was severely attacked, and the Prince's\n\nparty had the pleasure of exposing us as his accomplices. What is very\n\nstrange is that at the same time the Cardinal and his friends accused us\n\nof corresponding with the Parliament of Bordeaux, because we maintained,\n\nin case the Court did not adjust affairs there, we would infallibly bring\n\nthe Parliament of Paris into the interest of the Prince. If I were at\n\nthe point of death I should have no need to be confessed on account of my\n\nbehaviour on this occasion. I acted with as much sincerity in this\n\njuncture as if I had been the Cardinal's nephew, though really it was not\n\nout of any love to him, but because I thought myself obliged in prudence\n\nto oppose the progress of the Prince's faction, owing to the foolish\n\nconduct of his enemies; and to this end I was obliged to oppose the\n\nflattery of the Cardinal's tools as much as the efforts made by those who\n\nwere in the service of the Prince.\n\nOn the 3d of September President Bailleul returned with the other\n\ndeputies, and made a report in Parliament of his journey to Court; it\n\nwas, in brief, that the Queen thanked the Parliament for their good\n\nintentions, and had commanded them to assure the Parliament in her name\n\nthat she was ready to restore peace to Guienne, and that it would have\n\nbeen done before now had not M. de Bouillon, who had treated with the\n\nSpaniards, made himself master of Bordeaux, and thereby cut off the\n\neffects of his Majesty's goodness.\n\nThe Duc d'Orleans informed the House that he had received a letter from\n\nthe Archduke, signifying that the King of Spain having sent him full\n\npowers to treat for a general peace, he desired earnestly to negotiate it\n\nwith him. But his Royal Highness added that he did not think it proper\n\nto return him any answer till he had the opinion of the Parliament. The\n\ntrumpeter who brought the letter gathered a party at Tiroir cross, and\n\nspoke very seditious words to the people. The next day they found libels\n\nposted up and down the city in the name of M. de Turenne, setting forth\n\nthat the Archduke was coming with no other disposition than to make\n\npeace, and in one of them were these words: \"It is your business,\n\nParisians, to solicit your false tribunes, who have turned at last\n\npensioners and protectors of Mazarin, who have for so long a time sported\n\nwith your fortunes and repose, and spurred you on, kept you back, and\n\nmade you hot or cold, according to the caprices and different progress of\n\ntheir ambition.\"\n\nYou see the state and condition the Frondeurs were in at this juncture,\n\nwhen they could not move one step but to their own disadvantage. The Duc\n\nd'Orleans spoke to me that night with a, great deal of bitterness against\n\nthe Cardinal, which he had never done before, and said he had been\n\ntricked by him twice, and that he was ruining himself, the State, and all\n\nof us, and would, by so doing, place the Prince de Conde upon the throne.\n\nIn short, Monsieur owned that it was not yet time to humble the Cardinal.\n\n\"Therefore,\" said M. Bellievre, \"let us be upon our guard; this man can\n\ngive us the slip any moment.\"\n\nNext day a letter was sent from the Prince de Conde, by the Baron de\n\nVerderonne, to the Archduke, desiring him to name the time, place and\n\npersons for a treaty. The Baron returned with a letter from the Archduke\n\nto his Royal Highness, desiring that the conferences might be held\n\nbetween Rheims and Rhetel, and that they might meet there personally,\n\nwith such others as they should think fit to bring with them. The Court\n\nwas surprised, but, however, did not think fit to delay sending full\n\npowers to his Royal Highness to treat for peace on such terms as he\n\nthought reasonable and advantageous for the King's service; and there\n\nwere joined with him, though in subordination, MM. Mole, the First\n\nPresident, d'Avaux, and myself, with the title of Ambassadors\n\nExtraordinary and Plenipotentiaries. M. d'Avaux obliged me to assure Don\n\nGabriel de Toledo, in private, that if the Spaniards would but come to\n\nreasonable terms, we would conclude a peace with them in two days' time.\n\nAnd his Royal Highness said that Don Gabriel being a lover of money, I\n\nshould promise him for his part 100,000 crowns if the conference that was\n\nproposed ended in a peace, and bid him tell the Archduke that, if the\n\nSpaniards proposed reasonable terms, he would sign and have them\n\nregistered in Parliament before Mazarin should know anything of the\n\nmatter.\n\nDon Gabriel received the overture with joy; he had some particular\n\nfancies, but Fuensaldagne, who had a particular kindness for him, said\n\nthat he was the wisest fool he ever saw in his life. I have remarked\n\nmore than once that this sort of man cannot persuade, but can insinuate\n\nperfectly well, and that the talent of insinuation is of more service\n\nthan that of persuasion, because one may insinuate to a hundred where one\n\ncan hardly persuade five.\n\nThe King of England, after having lost the battle of Worcester, arrived\n\nin Paris the day that Don Gabriel set out, the 13th of September, 1651.\n\nMy Lord Taff was his great chamberlain, valet de chambre, clerk of the\n\nkitchen, cup-bearer, and all,--an equipage answerable to his Court, for\n\nhis Majesty had not changed his shirt all the way from England. Upon his\n\narrival at Paris, indeed, he had one lent him by my Lord Jermyn; but the\n\nQueen, his mother, had not money to buy him another for the next day.\n\nThe Duc d'Orleans went to compliment his Majesty upon his arrival, but it\n\nwas not in my power to persuade his Royal Highness to give his nephew one\n\npenny, because, said he, \"a little would not be worth his acceptance, and\n\na great deal would engage me to do as much hereafter.\" This leads me to\n\nmake the following digression: that there is nothing so wretched as to be\n\na minister to a Prince, and, at the same time, not his favourite; for it\n\nis his favour only that gives one a power over the more minute concerns\n\nof the family, for which the public does, nevertheless, think a minister\n\naccountable when they, see he has power over affairs of far greater\n\nconsequence.\n\nTherefore I was not in a condition to oblige his Royal Highness by\n\nassisting the King of England with a thousand pistoles, for which I was\n\nhorridly, ashamed, both upon his account anal my own; but I borrowed\n\nfifteen hundred for him from M. Morangis, and carried them to my Lord\n\nTaff.--[Lord Clarendon extols the civilities of Cardinal de Retz to King\n\nCharles II., and has reported a curious conversation which the Cardinal\n\nhad with that Prince.]--It is remarkable that the same night, as I was\n\ngoing home, I met one Tilney, an Englishman whom I had formerly known at\n\nRome, who told me that Vere, a great Parliamentarian and a favourite of\n\nCromwell, had arrived in Paris and had orders to see me. I was a little\n\npuzzled; however, I judged it would be improper to refuse him an\n\ninterview. Vere gave me a brief letter from Cromwell in the nature of\n\ncredentials, importing that the sentiments I had enunciated in the\n\n\"Defence of Public Liberty\" added to my reputation, and had induced\n\nCromwell to desire to enter with me into the strictest friendship. The\n\nletter was in the main wonderfully civil and complaisant. I answered it\n\nwith a great deal of respect, but in such a manner as became a true\n\nCatholic and an honest Frenchman. Vere appeared to be a man of\n\nsurprising abilities.\n\nI now return to our own affairs. I was told as a mighty secret that\n\nTellier had orders from the Cardinal to remove the Princes from the Bois\n\nde Vincennes if the enemy were likely to come near the place, and that he\n\nshould endeavour by all means to procure the consent of the Duc d'Orleans\n\nfor that end; but that, in case of refusal, these orders should be\n\nexecuted notwithstanding, and that he should endeavour to gain me to\n\nthese measures by the means of Madame de Chevreuse. When Tellier came to\n\nme I assured him that it was all one, both to me and the Duc d'Orleans,\n\nwhether the Princes were removed or not, but since my opinion was\n\ndesired, I must declare that I think nothing can be more contrary to the\n\ntrue interest of the King; \"for,\" said I, \"the Spaniards must gain a\n\nbattle before they can come to Vincennes, and when there they must have a\n\nflying camp to invest the place before they can deliver the Princes from\n\nconfinement, and therefore I am convinced that there is no necessity for\n\ntheir removal, and I do affirm that all unnecessary changes in matters\n\nwhich are in themselves disagreeable are pernicious, because odious.\n\nI will maintain, further, that there is less reason to fear the Duc\n\nd'Orleans and the Frondeurs than to dread the Spaniards. Suppose that\n\nhis Royal Highness is more disaffected towards the Court than anybody;\n\nsuppose further that M. de Beaufort and I have a mind to relieve the\n\nPrinces, in what way could we do it? Is not the whole garrison in that\n\ncastle in the King's service? Has his Royal Highness any regular troops\n\nto besiege Vincennes? And, granting the Frondeurs to be the greatest\n\nfools imaginable, will they expose the people of Paris at a siege which\n\ntwo thousand of the King's troops might raise in a quarter of an hour\n\nthough it consist of a hundred thousand citizens? I therefore conclude\n\nthat the removal would be altogether impolitic. Does it not look rather\n\nas if the Cardinal feigns apprehension of the Spaniards only as a\n\npretence to make himself master of the Princes, and to dispose of their\n\npersons at pleasure? The generality of the people, being Frondeurs, will\n\nconclude you take the Prince de Conde out of their hands,--whom they look\n\nupon to be safe while they see him walking upon the battlements of his\n\nprison,--and that you will give him his liberty when you please, and thus\n\nenable him to besiege Paris a second time. On the other hand, the\n\nPrince's party will improve this removal very much to their own advantage\n\nby the compassion such a spectacle will raise in the people when they see\n\nthree Princes dragged in chains from one prison to another. I was really\n\nmistaken just now when I said the case was all one to me, for I see that\n\nI am nearly concerned, because the people--in which word I include the\n\nParliament will cry out against it; I must be then obliged, for my own\n\nsafety, to say I did not approve of the resolution. Then the Court will\n\nbe informed that I find fault with it, and not only that, but that I do\n\nit in order to raise the mob and discredit the Cardinal, which, though\n\never so false; yet in consequence the people will firmly believe it, and\n\nthus I shall meet with the same treatment I met with in the beginning of\n\nthe late troubles, and what I even now experience in relation to the\n\naffairs of Guienne. I am said to be the cause of these troubles because\n\nI foretold them, and I was said to encourage the revolt at Bordeaux\n\nbecause I was against the conduct that occasioned it.\"\n\nTellier, in the Queen's name, thanked me for my unresisting disposition,\n\nand made the same proposal to his Royal Highness; upon which I spoke, not\n\nto second Tellier, who pleaded for the necessity of the removal, to which\n\nI could by no means be reconciled, but to make it evident to his Royal\n\nHighness that he was not in any way concerned in it in his own private\n\ncapacity, and that, in case the Queen did command it positively, it was\n\nhis duty to obey. M. de Beaufort opposed it so furiously as to offer the\n\nDuc d'Orleans to attack the guards which were to remove him. I had solid\n\nreasons to dissuade him from it, to the last of which he submitted, it\n\nbeing an argument which I had from the Queen's own mouth when she set out\n\nfor Guienne, that Bar offered to assassinate the Princes if it should\n\nhappen that he was not in a condition to hinder their escape. I was\n\nastonished when her Majesty trusted me with this secret, and imagined\n\nthat the Cardinal had possessed her with a fear that the Frondeurs had a\n\ndesign to seize the person of the Prince de Conde. For my part, I never\n\ndreamed of such a thing in my life. The Ducs d'Orleans and de Beaufort\n\nwere both shocked at the thought of it, and, in short, it was agreed that\n\nhis Royal Highness should give his consent for the removal, and that M.\n\nde Beaufort and myself should not give it out among the people that we\n\napproved of it.\n\nThe day that the Princes were removed to Marcoussi, President Bellievre\n\ntold the Keeper of the Seals in plain terms, that if he continued to\n\ntreat me as he had done hitherto, he should be obliged in honour to give\n\nhis testimony to the truth. To which the Keeper of the Seals returned\n\nthis blunt answer: \"The Princes are no longer in sight of Paris; the\n\nCoadjutor must not therefore talk so loud.\"\n\nI return now to the Parliament, which was so moderate at this time that\n\nthe Cardinal was hardly mentioned, and they agreed, 'nemine\n\ncontradicente', that the Parliament should send deputies to Bordeaux to\n\nknow once for all if that Parliament was for peace or not.\n\nSoon after this the Parliament of Toulouse wrote to that of Paris\n\nconcerning the disturbances in Guienne, part whereof belonged to their\n\njurisdiction, and expressly demanded a decree of union. But the Duc\n\nd'Orleans warded off the blow very dexterously, which was of great\n\nconsequence, and, more by his address than by his authority, brought the\n\nParliament to dismiss the deputies with civil answers and insignificant\n\nexpressions, upon which President Bellievre said to me, \"What pleasure\n\nshould we not take in acting as we do if it were for persons that had but\n\nthe sense to appreciate it!\"\n\nThe Parliament did not continue long in that calm. They passed a decree\n\nto interrogate the State prisoners in the Bastille, broke out sometimes\n\nlike a whirlwind, with thunder and lightning, against Cardinal Mazarin;\n\nat other times they complained of the misapplication of the public funds.\n\nWe had much ado to ward off the blows, and should not have been able to\n\nhold out long against the fury of the waves but for the news of the Peace\n\nof Bordeaux, which was registered there on October the 1st, 1650, and put\n\nthe Prince de Conde's party into consternation.\n\nOne mean artifice of Cardinal Mazarin's polity was always to entertain\n\nsome men of our own party, with whom, half reconciled, he played fast and\n\nloose before our eyes, and was eternally negotiating with them, deceiving\n\nand being deceived in his turn. The consequence of all this was a great,\n\nthick cloud, wherein the Frondeurs themselves were at last involved; but\n\nwhich they burst with a thunderclap.\n\nThe Cardinal, being puffed up with his success in settling the troubles\n\nof Guienne, thought of nothing else than crowning his triumph by\n\nchastising the Frondeurs, who, he said, had made use of the King's\n\nabsence to alienate the Duc d'Orleans from his service, to encourage the\n\nrevolt at Bordeaux, and to make themselves masters of the persons of the\n\nPrinces. At the same time, he told the Princess Palatine that he\n\ndetested the cruel hatred I bore to the Prince de Conde, and that the\n\npropositions I made daily to him on that score were altogether unworthy\n\nof a Christian. Yet he suggested to the Duc d'Orleans that I made great\n\novertures to him to be reconciled to the Court, but that he could not\n\ntrust me, because I was from morning to night negotiating with the\n\nfriends of the Prince de Conde. Thus the Cardinal rewarded me for what I\n\ndid with incredible application and, I must say, uncommon sincerity for\n\nthe Queen's service during the Court's absence. I do not mention the\n\ndangers I was in twice or thrice a day, surpassing even those of soldiers\n\nin battles. For imagine, I beseech you, what pain and anguish I must\n\nhave been in at hearing myself called a Mazarinist, and at having to bear\n\nall the odium annexed to that hateful appellation in a city where he made\n\nit his business to destroy me in the opinion of a Prince whose nature it\n\nwas to be always in fear and to trust none but such as hoped to rise by\n\nmy fall.\n\nThe Cardinal gave himself such airs after the peace at Bordeaux that some\n\nsaid my best way would be to retire before the King's return.\n\nCardinal Mazarin had been formerly secretary to Pancirole, the Pope's\n\nnuncio for the peace of Italy, whom he betrayed, and it was proved that\n\nhe had a secret correspondence with the Governor of Milan. Pancirole,\n\nbeing created cardinal and Secretary of State to the Church, did not\n\nforget the perfidiousness of his secretary, now created cardinal by Pope\n\nUrban, at the request of Cardinal de Richelieu, and did not at all\n\nendeavour to qualify the anger which Pope Innocent had conceived against\n\nMazarin after the assassination of one of his nephews, in conjunction\n\nwith Cardinal Anthony.\n\n[Anthony Barberini, nephew to Urban VIII., created Cardinal 1628,\n\nmade Protector of the Crown of France 1633, and Great Almoner of the\n\nKingdom 1653. He was afterwards Bishop of Poitiers, and, lastly,\n\nArchbishop of Rheims in 1657. Died 1671.]\n\nPancirole, who thought he could not affront Mazarin more than by\n\ncontributing to make me cardinal, did me all the kind offices with Pope\n\nInnocent, who gave him leave to treat with me in that affair.\n\nMadame de Chevreuse told the Queen all that she had observed in my\n\nconduct in the King's absence, and what she had seen was certainly one\n\ncontinued series of considerable services done to the Queen.\n\nShe recounted at last all the injustice done me, the contempt put upon\n\nme, and the just grounds of my diffidence, which, she said, of necessity\n\nought to be removed, and that the only means of removing it was the hat.\n\nThe Queen was in a passion at this. The Cardinal defended himself, not\n\nby an open denial, for he had offered it me several times, but by\n\nrecommending patience, intimating that a great monarch should be forced\n\nto nothing. Monsieur, seconding Madame de Chevreuse in her attack,\n\nassailed the Cardinal, who, at least in appearance, gave way, out of\n\nrespect for his Royal Highness. Madame de Chevreuse, having brought them\n\nto parley, did not doubt that she should also bring them to capitulate,\n\nespecially when she saw the Queen was appeased, and had told his Royal\n\nHighness that she was infinitely obliged to him, and would do what her\n\nCouncil judged most proper and reasonable. This Council, which was only\n\na specious name, consisted only of the Cardinal, the Keeper of the Seals,\n\nTellier, and Servien.\n\nThe matter was proposed to the Council by the Cardinal with much\n\nimportunity, concluding with a most submissive petition to the Queen to\n\ncondescend to the demand of the Duc d'Orleans, and to what the services\n\nand merits of the Coadjutor demanded. The proposition was rejected with\n\nsuch resolution and contempt as is very unusual in Council in opposition\n\nto a Prime Minister. Tellier and Servien thought it sufficient not to\n\napplaud him; but the Keeper of the Seals quite forgot his respect for the\n\nCardinal, accused him of prevarication and weakness, and threw himself at\n\nher Majesty's feet, conjuring her in the name of the King her son, not to\n\nauthorise, by an example which he called fatal, the insolence of a\n\nsubject who was for wresting favours from his sovereign, sword in hand.\n\nThe Queen was moved at this, and the poor Cardinal owned he had been too\n\neasy and pliant.\n\nI had myself given a very natural handle to my adversaries to expose me\n\nso egregiously. I have been guilty of many blunders, but I think this is\n\nthe grossest that I ever was guilty of in all my life. I have frequently\n\nmade this observation, that when men have, through fear of miscarriage,\n\nhesitated a long time about any undertaking of consequence, the remaining\n\nimpressions of their fear commonly push them afterwards with too much\n\nprecipitancy upon the execution of their design. And this was my case.\n\nIt was with the greatest reluctance that I determined to accept the\n\ndignity of a cardinal, because I thought it too mean to form a pretension\n\nto it without certainty of success; and no sooner was I engaged in the\n\npursuit of it but the impression of the former fearful ideas hurried me\n\non, as it were, to the end, that I might get as soon as possible out of\n\nthe disagreeable state of uncertainty.\n\nThe Cardinal would have paid my debts, given me the place of Grand\n\nAlmoner, etc.; but if he had added twelve cardinals' hats into the\n\nbargain, I should have begged his excuse. I was now engaged with\n\nMonsieur, who had, meanwhile, resolved upon the release of the Princes\n\nfrom their confinement.\n\nCardinal Mazarin, after his return to Paris, made it his chief study to\n\ndivide the Fronde. He thought to materially weaken my interest with\n\nMonsieur by detaching from me Madame de Chevreuse, for whom he had a\n\nnatural tenderness, and to give me a mortal blow by embroiling me with\n\nMademoiselle her daughter. To do this effectually he found a rival, who,\n\nhe hoped, would please her better, namely, M. d'Aumale, handsome as\n\nApollo, and one who was very likely to suit the temper of Mademoiselle de\n\nChevreuse. He had entirely devoted himself to the Cardinal's interest,\n\nlooked upon himself as very much honoured by this commission, and haunted\n\nthe Palace of Chevreuse so diligently that I did not doubt but that he\n\nwas sent thither to act the second part of the comedy which had\n\nmiscarried so shamefully in the hands of M. de Candale. I watched all\n\nhis movements, and complained to Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, but she gave\n\nme indirect answers. I began to be out of humour, and was soon appeased.\n\nI grew peevish again; and Mademoiselle de Chevreuse saying in his\n\npresence, to please me and to sting him, that she could not imagine how\n\nit was possible to bear a silly fellow, \"Pardon me, mademoiselle,\"\n\nreplied I, \"we suffer fops sometimes very patiently for the sake of their\n\nextravagances.\" This man was notoriously foppish and extravagant. My\n\nanswer pleased, and we soon got rid of him at the Palace of Chevreuse.\n\nBut he thought to have despatched me, for he hired one Grandmaison, a\n\nruffian, to assassinate me, who apprised me of his design. The first\n\ntime I met M. d'Aumale, which was at the Duc d'Orleans's house, I did not\n\nfail to let him know it; but I told it him in a whisper, saying that I\n\nhad too much respect for the House of Savoy to publish it to the world.\n\nHe denied the fact, but in such a manner as to make it more evident,\n\nbecause he conjured me to keep it secret. I gave him my word, and I kept\n\nit.\n\nMadame de Guemenee, with whom I had several quarrels, proposed to the\n\nQueen likewise to despatch me, by shutting me up in a greenhouse in her\n\ngarden, which she might easily have done, because I often went to her\n\nalone by night; but the Cardinal, fearing that the people would have\n\nsuspected him as the author of my sudden disappearance, would not enter\n\ninto the project, so it was dropped.\n\nTo return to our negotiations for the freedom of the Princes. The Duc\n\nd'Orleans was with much difficulty induced to sign the treaty by which a\n\nmarriage was stipulated between Mademoiselle de Chevreuse and the Prince\n\nde Conti, and to promise not to oppose my promotion to the dignity of a\n\ncardinal. The Princes were as active in the whole course of these\n\nnegotiations as if they had been at liberty. We wrote to them, and they\n\nto us, and a regular correspondence between Paris and Lyons was never\n\nbetter established than ours. Bar,\n\n[Bar was, according to M. Joly, an unsociable man, who was for\n\nraising his fortune by using the Princes badly, and who, on this\n\naccount, was often the dupe of Montreuil, secretary to the Prince de\n\nConti.--See JOLY'S \"Memoirs,\" vol. i., p. 88.]\n\ntheir warder, was a very shallow fellow; besides, men of sense are\n\nsometimes outwitted.\n\nCardinal Mazarin, upon his return with the King from Guienne, was greatly\n\npleased with the acclamations of the mob, but he soon grew weary of them,\n\nfor the Frondeurs still kept the wall.\n\nThe Cardinal being continually provoked at Paris by the Abbe Fouquet, who\n\nsought to make himself necessary, and being so vain as to think himself\n\nqualified to command an army, marched abruptly out of Paris for\n\nChampagne, with a design to retake Rhetel and Chateau-Portien, of which\n\nthe enemy were possessed, and where M. de Turenne proposed to winter.\n\nOn the feast of Saint Martin, the First President and the Attorney-\n\nGeneral Talon exhorted the Parliament to be peaceable, that the enemies\n\nof the State might have no advantage. A petition was read from Madame la\n\nPrincesse, desiring that the Princes should be brought to the Louvre and\n\nremain in the custody, of one of the King's officers, and that the\n\nSolicitor-General be sent for to say what he had to allege against their\n\ninnocence, and that in case he should have nothing solid to offer they be\n\nset at liberty.\n\nThe Chambers, being assembled on the 7th of December, to take the affair\n\ninto consideration, Talon, the Attorney-General, informed the House that\n\nthe Queen had sent for the King's Council, and ordered them to let the\n\nParliament know that it was her pleasure that the House should not take\n\nany cognisance of the Princess's petition, because everything that had\n\nrelation to the confinement of the Princes belonged to the royal\n\nauthority. Talon made a motion that the Parliament should depute some\n\nmembers to carry the petition to the Queen, and to beseech her Majesty to\n\ntake it into her consideration. At the same time another petition was\n\npresented from Mademoiselle de Longueville, for the liberty of the Duke\n\nher father, and that she might have leave to stay in Paris to solicit it.\n\nNo sooner was this petition read than a letter from the three Princes was\n\npresented and read, praying that they might be brought to trial or set at\n\nliberty.\n\nOn the 9th day of the month an order was brought to the Parliament from\n\nthe King, commanding the House to suspend all deliberations on this\n\nsubject till they had first sent their deputies to Court to know his\n\nMajesty's pleasure.\n\nDeputies were sent immediately, to whom, accordingly, the Queen gave\n\naudience in bed, telling them that she was very much indisposed. The\n\nKeeper of the Seals added that it was the King's pleasure that the\n\nParliament should not meet at all until such time as the Queen his mother\n\nhad recovered her health.\n\nOn the 10th the House resolved to adjourn only to the 14th, and on that\n\nday a general procession was proposed to the Archbishop by the Dean of\n\nParliament, to beg that God would inspire them with such counsels only as\n\nmight be for the good of the public.\n\nOn the 14th they received the King's letter, forbidding their debates,\n\nand informing them that the Queen would satisfy them very speedily about\n\nthe affair of the Princes; but this letter was disregarded. They sent a\n\ndeputation to invite the Duc d'Orleans to come to the House, but, after\n\nconsulting with the Queen, he told the deputies that he did not care to\n\ngo, that the Assembly was too noisy, that he could not divine what they\n\nwould be at, that the affairs in debate were never known to fall under\n\ntheir cognisance, and that they had nothing else to do but to refer the\n\nsaid petitions to the Queen.\n\nOn the 18th news came that Marechal du Plessis had gained a signal\n\nvictory over M. de Turenne, who was coming to succour Rhetel, but found\n\nit already surrendered to Marechal du Plessis; and the Spanish garrison,\n\nendeavouring to retreat, was forced to an engagement on the plains of\n\nSaumepuis; that about 2,000 men were killed upon the spot, among the rest\n\na brother of the Elector Palatine, and six colonels, and that there were\n\nnearly 4,000 prisoners, the most considerable of whom were several\n\npersons of note, and all the colonels, besides twenty colours and eighty-\n\nfour standards. You may easily guess at the consternation of the\n\nPrinces' party; my house was all night filled with the lamentations of\n\ndespairing mourners, and I found the Duc d'Orleans, as it were, struck\n\ndumb.\n\nOn the 19th, as I went to the Parliament House, the people looked\n\nmelancholy, dejected, and frightened out of their wits. The members were\n\nafraid to open their mouths, and nobody would mention the name of Mazarin\n\nexcept Menardeau Champre, who spoke of him with encomiums, by giving him\n\nthe honour of the victory of Rhetel, and then he moved the House to\n\nentreat the Queen to put the Princes into the hands of that good and wise\n\nMinister, who would be as careful of them as he had been hitherto of the\n\nState. I wondered most of all that this man was not hissed in the House,\n\nand especially as he passed through the Great Hall. This circumstance,\n\ntogether with what I saw that afternoon in every street, convinced me how\n\nmuch our friends were dispirited, and I therefore resolved next day to\n\nraise their courage. I knew the First President to be purblind, and such\n\nmen greedily swallow every new fact which confirms them in their first\n\nimpression. I knew likewise the Cardinal to be a man that supposed\n\neverybody had a back door. The only way of dealing with men of that\n\nstamp is to make them believe that you design to deceive those whom you\n\nearnestly endeavour to serve.\n\nFor this reason, on the 20th, I declaimed against the disorders of the\n\nState, and showed that it having pleased Almighty God to bless his\n\nMajesty's arms and to remove the public enemy from our frontiers by the\n\nvictory gained over them by Marechal du Plessis, we ought now to apply\n\nourselves seriously to the healing of internal wounds of the State, which\n\nare the more dangerous because they are less obvious. To this I thought\n\nfit to add that I was obliged to mention the general oppression of the\n\nsubjects at a time when we had nothing more to fear from the lately\n\nrouted Spaniards; that, as one of the props of the public safety was the\n\npreservation of the royal family, I could not without the utmost concern\n\nsee the Princes breathe the unwholesome air of Havre-de-Grace, and that I\n\nwas of opinion that the House should humbly entreat the King to remove\n\nthem, at least to some place more healthy. At this speech everybody\n\nregained their courage and concluded that all was not yet lost. It was\n\nobserved that the people's countenances were altered. Those in the Great\n\nHall resumed their former zeal, made the usual acclamations as we went\n\nout, and I had that day three hundred carriages of visitors.\n\nOn the 22d the debate was continued, and it was more and more observed\n\nthat the Parliament did not follow the triumphant chariot of Cardinal\n\nMazarin, whose imprudence in hazarding the fate of the whole kingdom in\n\nthe last battle was set off with all the disadvantages that could be\n\ninvented to tarnish the victory.\n\nThe 30th crowned the work, and produced a decree for making most humble\n\nremonstrances to the Queen for the liberty of the Princes and for\n\nMademoiselle de Longueville staying in Paris.\n\nIt was further resolved to send a deputation to the Duc d'Orleans, to\n\ndesire his Royal Highness to use his interest on this occasion in favour\n\nof the said Princes.\n\nThe King's Council having waited on her Majesty with the remonstrances\n\naforesaid, she pretended to be under medical treatment, and put off the\n\nmatter a week longer. The Duc d'Orleans also gave an ambiguous answer.\n\nThe Queen's course of treatment continued eight or ten days longer than\n\nshe imagined, or, rather, than she said, and consequently the\n\nremonstrances of the Parliament were not made till the 20th of January,\n\n1651.\n\nOn the 28th the First President made his report, and said the Queen had\n\npromised to return an answer in a few days.\n\nIt happened very luckily for us at this time that the imprudence of the\n\nCardinal was greater than the inconstancy of the Duc d'Orleans, for a\n\nlittle before the Queen returned an answer to the remonstrances, he\n\ntalked very roughly to the Duke in the Queen's presence, charging him\n\nwith putting too much confidence in me. The very day that the Queen made\n\nthe aforesaid answer he spoke yet more arrogantly to the Duke in her\n\nMajesty's apartment, comparing M. de Beaufort and myself to Cromwell and\n\nFairfax in the House of Commons in England, and exclaimed furiously in\n\nthe King's presence, so that he frightened the Duke, who was glad he got\n\nout of the King's Palace with a whole skin, and who said that he would\n\nnever put himself again in the power of that furious woman, meaning the\n\nQueen, because she had improved on what the Cardinal had said to the\n\nKing. I resolved to strike the iron while it was hot, and joined with M.\n\nde Beaufort to persuade his Royal Highness to declare himself the next\n\nday in Parliament. We showed him that, after what had lately passed,\n\nthere was no safety for his person, and if the King should go out of\n\nParis, as the Cardinal designed, we should be engaged in a civil war,\n\nwhereof he alone, with the city of Paris, must bear the heavy load; that\n\nit would be equally scandalous and dangerous for his Royal Highness\n\neither to leave the Princes in chains, after having treated with them,\n\nor, by his dilatory proceedings, suffer Mazarin to have all the honour of\n\nsetting them at liberty, and that he ought by all means to go to the\n\nParliament House.\n\nThe Duchess, too, seconded us, and upon his Highness saying that if he\n\nwent to the House to declare against the Court the Cardinal would be sure\n\nto take his Majesty out of Paris, the Duchess replied, \"What, monsieur,\n\nare you not Lieutenant-General of France? Do not you command the army?\n\nAre you not master of the people? I myself will undertake that the King\n\nshall not go out of Paris.\" The Duke nevertheless remained inflexible,\n\nand all we could get out of him was that he would consent to my telling\n\nthe Parliament, in his name, what we desired he should say himself. In a\n\nword, he would have me make the experiment, the success of which he\n\nlooked upon to be very uncertain, because he thought the Parliament would\n\nhave nothing to say against the Queen's answer, and that if I succeeded\n\nhe should reap the honour of the proposition. I readily accepted the\n\ncommission, because all was at stake, and if I had not executed it the\n\nnext morning I am sure the Cardinal would have eluded setting the Princes\n\nat liberty a great while longer, and the affair have ended in a\n\nnegotiation with them against the Duke.\n\nThe Duchess, who saw that I exposed myself for the public good, pitied me\n\nvery much. She did all she could to persuade the Duke to command me to\n\nmention to the Parliament what the Cardinal had told the King with\n\nrelation to Cromwell, Fairfax and the English Parliament, which, if\n\ndeclared in the Duke's name, she thought would excite the House the more\n\nagainst Mazarin; and she was certainly in the right. But he forbade me\n\nexpressly.\n\nI ran about all night to incite the members at their first meeting to\n\nmurmur at the Queen's answer, which in the main was very plausible,\n\nimporting that, though this affair did not fall within the cognisance of\n\nParliament, the Queen would, however, out of her abundant goodness, have\n\nregard to their supplications and restore the Princes to liberty.\n\nBesides, it promised a general amnesty to all who had borne arms in their\n\nfavour, on condition only that M. de Turenne should lay down his arms,\n\nthat Madame de Longueville should renounce her treaty with Spain, and\n\nthat Stenai and Murzon should be evacuated.\n\nAt first the Parliament seemed to be dazzled with it, but next day, the\n\n1st of February, the whole House was undeceived, and wondered how it had\n\nbeen so deluded. The Court of Inquests began to murmur; Viole stood up\n\nand said that the Queen's answer was but a snare laid for the Parliament\n\nto beguile them; that the 12th of March, the time fixed for the King's\n\ncoronation, was just at hand; and that as soon as the Court was out of\n\nParis they, would laugh at the Parliament. At this discourse the old and\n\nnew Fronde stood up, and when I saw they, were greatly excited I waved\n\nmy, cap and said that the Duke had commanded me to inform the House that\n\nthe regard he had for their sentiments having confirmed him in those he\n\nalways naturally, entertained of his cousins, he was resolved to concur\n\nwith them for procuring their liberty, and to contribute everything in\n\nhis power to effect it; and it is incredible what influence these few\n\nwords had upon the whole assembly. I was astonished at it myself. The\n\nwisest senators seemed as mad as the common people, and the people madder\n\nthan ever. Their acclamations exceeded anything you can imagine, and,\n\nindeed, nothing less was sufficient to give heart to the Duke, who had\n\nall night been bringing forth new projects with more sorrowful pangs and\n\nthroes (as the Duchess expressed it) than ever she had felt when in\n\nlabour with all her children.\n\nWhen he was fully informed of the good success of his declaration, he\n\nembraced me several times before all the company, and M. Tellier going to\n\nwait upon him from the Queen, to know if he acknowledged what I had said\n\nin his name in the House, \"Yes,\" replied he, \"I own, and always will own,\n\nall that he shall say or act in my name.\" We thought that after a solemn\n\ndeclaration of this nature the Duke would not scruple to take all the\n\nnecessary precautions to prevent the Cardinal carrying away the King, and\n\nto that end the Duchess did propose to have all the gates of the city\n\nwell guarded, under pretence of some popular tumults. But he was deaf to\n\nall she said, pretending that he was loth to make his King a prisoner.\n\nOn the 2d of February, 1651, the Duke, urged very importunately by the\n\nPrinces' party informing him that their liberty depended on it, told them\n\nthat he was going to perform an action which would remove all their\n\ndiffidence. He sent immediately for the Keeper of the Seals, Marechal\n\nVilleroi; and Tellier, and bade them tell the Queen that he would never\n\ncome to the Palais Royal as long as Mazarin was there, and that he could\n\nno longer treat with a man that ruined the State. And, then, turning\n\ntowards Marechal Villeroi, \"I charge you,\" said he, \"with the King's\n\nperson; you shall be answerable for him to me.\" I was sadly afraid this\n\nwould be a means to hasten the King's departure, which was what we\n\ndreaded most of all, and I wondered that the Cardinal did not remove\n\nafter such a declaration. I thought his head was turned, and indeed I\n\nwas told that he was beside himself for a fortnight together.\n\nThe Duke having openly declared against Mazarin, and being resolved to\n\nattack and drive him out of the kingdom, bade me inform the House next\n\nday, in his name, how the Cardinal had compared their body to the Rump\n\nParliament in England, and some of their members to Cromwell and Fairfax.\n\nI improved upon this as much as possible, and I daresay that so much heat\n\nand ferment was never seen in any society before. Some were for sending\n\nthe Cardinal a personal summons to appear on the spot, to give an account\n\nof his administration; but the most moderate were for making most humble\n\nremonstrances to the Queen for his removal. You may easily guess what a\n\nthunderclap this must have been to the Court. The Queen asked the Duke\n\nwhether she might bring the Cardinal to his Royal Highness. His answer\n\nwas that he did not think it good for the safety of his own person. She\n\noffered to come alone to confer with his Highness at the Palais\n\nd'Orleans, but he excused himself with a great deal of respect.\n\nHe sent orders an hour after to the Marshals of France to obey him only,\n\nas Lieutenant-General of the State, and likewise to the 'prevots des\n\nmarchands' not to take up arms except by his authority. You will wonder,\n\nwithout doubt, that after all this noise no care was taken of the gates\n\nof Paris to prevent the King's departure. The Duchess, who trembled at\n\nthe thoughts of it, daily redoubled her endeavours to induce the Duke to\n\nsecure the gates of the city, but all to no purpose; for weak minds are\n\ngenerally deficient in some respect or other.\n\nOn the 4th the Duke came to the Parliament and assured the assembly of\n\nhis concurrence in everything to reform the State and to procure the\n\nliberty of the Princes and the Cardinal's removal. As soon as his Royal\n\nHighness had done speaking, the Master of the Ceremonies was admitted\n\nwith a letter from the King, which was read, and which required the House\n\nto separate, and to send as many deputies as they could to the Palais\n\nRoyal to hear the King's will and pleasure. Deputies were accordingly\n\nsent immediately, for whose return the bulk of the members stayed in the\n\nGreat Chamber. I was informed that this was one trick among others\n\nconcerted to ruin me, and, telling the Duc d'Orleans of it, he said that\n\nif the old buffoon, the Keeper of the Seals, was concerned in such a\n\ncomplication of folly and knavery, he deserved to be hanged by the side\n\nof Mazarin. But the sequel showed that I was not out in my information.\n\nAs soon as the deputies were come to the Palais Royal, the First\n\nPresident told the Queen that the Parliament was extremely concerned that\n\nthe Princes were still confined, notwithstanding her royal promise for\n\nsetting them at liberty. The Queen replied that Marchal de Grammont was\n\nsent to release them and to see to their necessary security for the\n\npublic tranquillity, but that she had sent for them in relation to\n\nanother affair, which the Keeper of the Seals would explain to them, and\n\nwhich he couched in a sanguinary manifesto, in substance as follows:\n\n\"All the reports made by the Coadjutor in Parliament are false, and\n\ninvented by him. He lies!\" (This is the only word the Queen added to\n\nwhat was already written). \"He is a very wicked, dangerous man, and\n\ngives the Duke very pernicious advice; he wants to ruin the State because\n\nwe have refused to make him cardinal, and has publicly boasted that he\n\nwill set fire to the four corners of the kingdom, and that he will have\n\n100,000 men in readiness to dash out the brains of those that shall\n\nattempt to put it out.\" These expressions were very harsh, and I am sure\n\nthat I never said anything like that; but it was of no use at this time\n\nto make the cloud which was gathering over the head of Mazarin fall in a\n\nstorm upon mine. The Court saw that Parliament was assembled to pass a\n\ndecree for setting the Princes at liberty, and that the Duke in person\n\nwas declaring against Mazarin in the Grand Chamber, and therefore they\n\nbelieved that a diversion would be as practicable as it was necessary,\n\nnamely, to bring me upon my trial in such a manner that the Parliament\n\ncould not refuse nor secure me from the railleries of the most\n\ninconsiderable member. Everything that tended to render the attack\n\nplausible was made use of, as well as everything that might weaken my\n\ndefence. The writing was signed by the four Secretaries of State, and,\n\nthe better to defeat all that I could say in my justification, the Comte\n\nde Brienne was sent at the heels of the deputies with an order to desire\n\nthe Duc d'Orleans to come to a conference with the Queen in relation to\n\nsome few difficulties that remained concerning the liberty of the\n\nPrinces.\n\nWhen the deputies had returned to Parliament, the First President began\n\nwith reading the paper which had been delivered to him against me, upon\n\nwhich you might have read astonishment in every face. Menardeau, who was\n\nto open the trenches against me, was afraid of a salvo from the Great\n\nHall, where he found such a crowd of people, and heard so many\n\nacclamations to the Fronde, and so many imprecations against Mazarin,\n\nthat he durst not open his mouth against me, but contented himself with a\n\npathetic lamentation of the division that was in the State, and\n\nespecially in the royal family. The councillors were so divided that\n\nsome of them were for appointing public prayers for two days; others\n\nproposed to desire his Royal Highness to take care of the public safety.\n\nI resolved to treat the writing drawn up against me by the Cardinal as a\n\nsatire and a libel, and, by some ingenious, short passage, to arouse the\n\nminds of my hearers. As my memory did not furnish me with anything in\n\nancient authors that had any relation to my subject, I made a small\n\ndiscourse in the best Latin I was capable of, and then spoke thus:\n\n\"Were it not for the profound respect I bear to the persons who have\n\nspoken before me, I could not forbear complaining of their not crying out\n\nagainst such a scurrilous, satirical paper, which was just now read,\n\ncontrary to all forms of proceeding, and written in the same style as\n\nlately profaned the sacred name of the King, to encourage false witnesses\n\nby letters-patent. I believe that those persons thought this paper,\n\nwhich is but a sally of the furious Mazarin, to be much beneath\n\nthemselves and me. And that I may conform my opinion to theirs, I will\n\nanswer only by repeating a passage from an ancient author: 'In the worst\n\nof times I did not forsake the city, in the most prosperous I had no\n\nparticular views, and in the most desperate times of all I feared\n\nnothing.' I desire to be excused for running into this digression. I\n\nmove that you would make humble remonstrances to the King, to desire him\n\nto despatch an order immediately for setting the Princes at liberty, to\n\nmake a declaration in their favour, and to remove Cardinal Mazarin from\n\nhis person and Councils.\"\n\nMy opinion was applauded both by the Frondeurs and the Prince's party,\n\nand carried almost 'nemine contradicente'.\n\nTalon, the Attorney-General, did wonders. I never heard or read anything\n\nmore eloquent or nervous. He invoked the names of Henri the Great, and\n\nupon his knees recommended the kingdom of France in general to the\n\nprotection of Saint Louis.\n\nBrienne, who had been sent by the Queen to desire an interview with the\n\nDuc d'Orleans, was dismissed with no other answer than that the Duke\n\nwould come to pay his humble duty to the Queen as soon as the Princes\n\nwere at liberty, and Cardinal Mazarin removed from the King's person and\n\nCouncils.\n\nOn the 5th of February there was an assembly of the, nobility at Nemours\n\nfor recovering their privileges. I opposed it to the utmost of my power,\n\nfor I had experienced more than once that nothing can be more pernicious\n\nto a party than to engage without any necessity in such affairs as have\n\nthe bare appearance of faction, but I was obliged to comply. This\n\nassembly, however, was so terrifying to the Court that six companies of\n\nthe Guards were ordered to mount, with which the Duc d'Orleans was so\n\noffended that he sent word to the officers, in his capacity of\n\nLieutenant-General of the State, to receive no orders but from himself.\n\nThey answered very respectfully, but as men devoted to the Queen's\n\ninterest.\n\nOn the 6th, the Duke having taken his place in the Parliament, the King's\n\nCouncil acquainted the House that, having been sent to wait on her\n\nMajesty with the remonstrances, her Majesty's answer was that no person\n\nliving wished more for the liberty of the Princes than herself, but that\n\nit was reasonable at the same time to consult the safety of the State;\n\nthat as for Cardinal Mazarin, she was resolved to retain him in her\n\nCouncil as long as she found his assistance necessary for the King's\n\nservice; and that it did not belong to the Parliament to concern\n\nthemselves with any of her ministers.\n\nThe First President was shrewdly attacked in the House for not being more\n\nresolute in speaking to the Queen. Some were for sending him back to\n\ndemand another audience in the afternoon; and the Duc d'Orleans having\n\nsaid that the Marshals of France were dependent on Mazarin, it was\n\nresolved immediately that they should obey none but his Royal Highness.\n\nI was informed that very evening that the Cardinal had made his escape\n\nout of Paris in disguise, and that the Court was in a very great\n\nconsternation.\n\nThe Cardinal's escape was the common topic of conversation, and different\n\nreasons were assigned to it, according to the various interests of\n\ndifferent parties. As for my part, I am very well persuaded that fear\n\nwas the only reason of his flight, and that nothing else hindered him\n\nfrom taking the King and the Queen along with him. You will see in the\n\nsequel of this history that he endeavoured to get their Majesties out of\n\nParis soon after he had made his escape, and that it was concerted in all\n\nprobability before he left the Court; but I could never understand why he\n\ndid not put it into execution at a time when he had no reason to fear the\n\nleast opposition.\n\nOn the 17th the Parliament ordered the thanks of the House to be returned\n\nto the Queen for removing the Cardinal, and that she should be humbly\n\nasked to issue an order for setting the Princes at liberty, and a\n\ndeclaration for excluding all foreigners forever from the King's Council.\n\nThe First President being deputed with the message, the Queen told him\n\nthat she could return him no answer till she had conferred with the Duc\n\nd'Orleans, to whom she immediately deputed the Keeper of the Seals,\n\nMarechal Villeroi, and Tellier; but he told them that he could not go to\n\nthe Palais Royal till the Princes were set at liberty and the Cardinal\n\nremoved further from the Court. For he observed to the House that the\n\nCardinal was no further off than at Saint Germain, where he governed all\n\nthe kingdom as before, that his nephew and his nieces were yet at Court;\n\nand the Duke proposed that the Parliament should humbly beseech the Queen\n\nto explain whether the Cardinal's removal was for good and all. If I had\n\nnot seen it, I could not have imagined what a heat the House was in that\n\nday. Some were for an order that there should be no favourites in France\n\nfor the future. They became at length of the opinion of his Royal\n\nHighness, namely, to address the Queen to ask her to explain herself with\n\nrelation to the removal of Cardinal Mazarin and to solicit orders for the\n\nliberty, of the Princes.\n\nOn the same day the Queen sent again to desire the Duc d'Orleans to come\n\nand take his place in the Council, and to tell him that, in case he did\n\nnot think it convenient, she would send the Keeper of the Seals to\n\nconcert necessary measures with him for setting the Princes at liberty.\n\nHis Royal Highness accepted the second, but rejected the first proposal,\n\nand treated M. d'Elbeuf roughly, because he was very pressing with his\n\nRoyal Highness to go to the King's Palace. The messengers likewise\n\nacquainted the Duke that they were ordered to assure him that the removal\n\nof the Cardinal was forever. You will see presently that, in all\n\nprobability, had his Royal Highness gone that day to Court, the Queen\n\nwould have left Paris and carried the Duke along with her.\n\nOn the 19th the Parliament decreed that, in pursuance of the Queen's\n\ndeclaration, the Cardinal should, within the space of fifteen days,\n\ndepart from his Majesty's dominions, with all his relations and foreign\n\nservants; otherwise, they should be proceeded against as outlaws, and it\n\nshould be lawful for anybody to despatch them out of the way.\n\nI suspected that the King would leave Paris that very day, and I was\n\nalmost asleep when I was sent for to go to the Duc d'Orleans, whom\n\nMademoiselle de Chevreuse went to awaken in the meantime; and, while I\n\nwas dressing, one of her pages brought me a note from her, containing\n\nonly these few words:\n\n\"Make haste to Luxembourg, and be upon your guard on the way.\" I found\n\nMademoiselle de Chevreuse in his chamber, who acquainted me that the King\n\nwas out of bed, and had his boots on ready for a journey from Paris.\n\nI waited on the Duke, and said, \"There is but one remedy, which is, to\n\nsecure the gates of Paris.\" Yet all that we could obtain of him was to\n\nsend the captain of the Swiss Guards to wait on the Queen and desire her\n\nMajesty to weigh the consequences of an action of that nature. His\n\nDuchess, perceiving that this expedient, if not supported effectually,\n\nwould ruin all, and that his Royal Highness was still as irresolute as\n\never, called for pen and ink that lay upon the table in her cabinet, and\n\nwrote these words on a large sheet of paper:\n\nM. le Coadjuteur is ordered to take arms to hinder the adherents of\n\nCardinal Mazarin, condemned by the Parliament, from carrying the\n\nKing out of Paris.\n\nMARGUERITE DE LORRAINE.\n\nDes Touches, who found the Queen bathed in tears, was charged by her\n\nMajesty to assure the Duc d'Orleans that she never "
