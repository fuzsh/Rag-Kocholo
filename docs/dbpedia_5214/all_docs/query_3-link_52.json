PREFACE LA FONTAINE, whose place is amongst the foremost of French men of letters, needs no introduction to the world. His Fables are known universally, his \" Contes \" by all students of French literature. His works were printed and reprinted in a series of magnificent editions. They were translated into many languages, and were illustrated by great artists : the Fables by Oudry and Gustave Dore, the \" Contes \" by Eisen (\" Edition des Fermiers- Generaux \"), by Fragonard, and others. In a manner the poet may be said to stand midway between the old and the new, for he appreciated the humour of the Renaissance period and adapted it to the clear and sparkling style of the Grand Siecle. His life is made up of small incidents, many friend- ships, and a true passion for poetry. He was closely in touch with Boileau, Racine, and Moliere, thus forming one of the most remarkable quartette of a brilliant period of French literary history. He had a number of women friends, but never a great passion. Among those he held dearest were the gay niece of Mazarin, Mme la Duchesse de Bouillon, 5 f Preface the actress La Champmesle, and the \" illustrious lady who was an honour to her sex and to her century,\" Mme de la Sabliere, the author of \"Christian Maxims.\" The biographer Walckenaer declared that the best of feminine influences was lacking in La Fontaine's life. \" If Heaven,\" he wrote, apostrophising the poet, \" had bestowed upon you a companion who had made you familiar with the tranquil pleasures of domestic life, your imagination would have been no less gay, no less keen, no less spirituelle, but better regulated and more pure.\" The fabulist's chief charm lies in his lovableness and his helplessness. The translation into English of the Fables is taken, unless otherwise stated, from the version by Elizur Wright, in Bohn's Standard Library, 1846, by very kind permission of Messrs. George Bell & Sons, the publishers. I also wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons for a translation by Katharine P. Wormeley from \" Portraits of the Seventeenth Century, Historic and Literary,\" by Sainte- Beuve, and to Messrs. Wm. Blackwood & Sons for several translations by W. L.

Among the many deliberate compliments and eulogies lavished upon the same author, that of Walpole himself is perhaps one of the best. He wrote in French to President Henault : \" Tous les autres auteurs, qui ont le plus approfondi le cceur humain, ne font que faire parler la nature, mais, c'est la nature qui tait parler La Fontaine.\"1 Nature shone thus knowingly through his verses because he had been thoroughly imbued with her spirit 1 Letter of August 17th, 1766. Paget-Toynbee Edition, vol. vii. PP- 34-5- (»9°4.) 2 *7 1 8 Jean de la Fontaine in his early years. Nevertheless, he did not give expression to her beauties until he had left her scenes far behind him and dwelt in cities amidst society of the most complex and luxurious kind. The presence of La Fontaine at the Court of Louis XIV. makes a pleasant study in contrasts. It was the age of glory, of self-seeking and self-assertion, of rule and regulation, of everything that made for material grandeur. Into this oddly antipathetic atmosphere was pitch- forked a raw, inexperienced country youth — for the passage of years had not made a man of him — whose predominating qualities were simplicity and natural- ness, without cunning, foresight, or ambition. He repudiated everything that was conventional, he never did anything he did not wish to do, he never concerned himself about other people's affairs unless they were in trouble and applied to him for help, and he dreamt of a Utopia where there were neither laws, business, nor finance, and where common objects lacked symmetry, regularity, and uniformity. His was an odd, ungoverned mind. He undertook neither duties nor responsibilities, whether public or private. He was quite incapable of looking after his own interests, but extremely capable of discovering friends who devoted themselves to him and his enter- tainment. Seemingly he belonged to an earlier century than the one in which he lived, and although he attempted to adapt himself to the conditions of the day, it is not easy to say whether the poet had more Youth 19 influence on the times or the times more influence on the poet. During his youth there were no signs of premature genius. The child's mental qualities developed very slowly, and for years his gifts lay dormant. La Fontaine was born at the beginning of July, 1 62 1, at Chateau-Thierry, in Champagne. It was usual to baptize babies on their birthday, or at latest the day following, therefore the record of his birth gives to within a few hours the time of his appearance in the world.1 The infant's father, Charles de la Fontaine, was Commissioner of Waters and Forests and King's Councillor, the former appointment having been held by his father, an older Jean, who had retired from business to fill it. The La Fontaines had been successful merchants in their day, the drapery trade having attracted them in earlier generations. On the maternal side La Fontaine's relatives had a solid reputation for science, learning, and literary culture. 1 Act of Baptism of Jean de la Fontaine (extracted from the register of the parish of Saint-Crepin, at Chateau-Thierry) ; \" The eighth day of this present month (July), being the year 162 1, a son named Jean has been baptized by me the undersigned pastor. The father is M. Charles de la Fontaine, King's Councillor and Commissioner of Waters and Forests of the Duchy of Chateau- Thierry. The mother is Demoiselle Francoise Pidoux. The godfather, the gentleman Jean de la Fontaine, the godmother Claude Josse, wife of M. Louis Guerin (or Gurin), also Director of Waters and Forests of the said locality. \"{Signed) La Vallee \" De la Fontaine.\" 20 Jean de la Fontaine His mother was a Pidoux, and the Pidoux possessed advantages which were not merely academic. They were noted for longevity of life, long noses, and the fact that they were distantly connected with the house of Richelieu. The last qualification redounded largely to their credit in the provincial circles in which they moved. Of Francoise Pidoux, who had the glory of bringing into the world so famous a poet (though when his fame came sh,e was not alive to take pleasure in it), very little is known. Her father was a dignitary of importance, the magistrate of Coulommiers. Her brother also held an official post. Before her marriage with Charles de la Fontaine she lived within twenty miles of her future husband's home. When she met him she was a widow with one daughter, Anne de Jouy, who appears to have played but a small part in her half-brother's life, and who married a M. Henri de Villemontee. The La Fontaine household was not a large one ; besides the poet, only one other son was born to Francoise Pidoux of her second marriage ; this was Claude, who became a priest. At that time the line was very clearly drawn in France between noblesse and bourgeoisie, so clearly indeed that sometimes misunderstandings occurred because it was a temptation for those who were just below the line to hoist themselves above it. Any lever they could find was used for this purpose, preferably an Youth 2 1 ancestor by marriage with a handle to his or her name, or the acquisition of land which had seigniorial rights. In the case of the La Fontaines there was some such ambition to regard themselves as ennobled and to use the title of Esquire. The title appeared in the marriage certificate of the poet's father, dated January 13, 1617, as well as in some later documents. But laxity in these questions of rank was not permitted by law, and in 1661 Colbert issued an ordinance against those who falsely claimed titles in the hope of escaping certain taxes with which the people were burdened, and La Fontaine incurred a penalty of two thousand livres for using the \" esquire \" without having paid for the privilege. In this misfortune the poet addressed himself to the Due de Bouillon, who was seigneur of Chateau-Thierry, begging him to inter- cede with Colbert on his behalf. He thought the word c< esquire \" conveyed but an empty honour, and assured every one concerned that he had never wished to represent himself as of gentle birth, that grace a rhurie he was a ruined man, and that he had inadvertently signed the contracts containing the for- bidden qualification without having read their con- tents, just as he might have appended his name blindly to his own death-warrant : \" Et lisez-vous tout ce qu'on yous apporte? J'aurois signe\" ma mort de meme sorte,\" 1 he concluded pathetically. 1 Epitre a Monsieur le due de Bouillon. 22 Jean de la Fontaine Bereft of the modest courtesy title to which they had laid claim, and labelled petit bourgeois, the family of La Fontaine had nevertheless pretences to a recognised position on account of the honourable and ancient appointment of Commissioner of Waters and Forests,1 held by several of its members. As a boy La Fontaine understood very few of the difficulties which attended his father's work ; when as a man he inherited the post of commissioner he saw in it nothing but disagreeables. Utterly incompetent in business affairs, he never succeeded in mastering the ABC of forestry, but his early life in the woods was in itself an education. He learned the less arduous branches of woodcraft as he trotted placidly at his father's heels on the daily rounds through glades and 1 In the fourteenth century a system of forestry had been elaborated by Philippe le Bel which consisted of a complex organisation estab- lishing complete guardianship over one of the most important sections of public domain. The chief of the staff was the Commissioner, called tnaitre des eaux et forits. This official was the successor of the enquiteur general, who had superseded the grand forestier of the early ages. His duties, broadly speaking, were to administer the affairs of the district, receive the reports of the verderers, gruarius, and foresters, deal with the cutting down of trees and sale of timber, appoint the gardes-marteau who marked the trees to be felled, inspect the plantations, clearings, drainage, roads, embankments, and bridges, keep the rivers navigable, and supervise the hunting and fishing on their territories. The work was greatly complicated by the number of rules and regulations framed, which increased, if anything, through- out the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Several important laws came into force in the seventeenth century. Two dealing with the chase were dated respectively June 1601 and September 1607. In August 1669 Colbert practically reorganised the whole of the administration dealing with waters and forests, an upheaval which had no little influence in La Fontaine's affairs. Youth 23 thickets, visiting the outlying huts where the foresters lived, interviewing the warders and gamekeepers on their beat, watching the wood-choppers at their work, and, while his father was busily engaged with the men, slipping away by himself to climb trees for birds' nests, or to gather spoils from the flower-laden bushes, catch fish in preserved waters or mischievously set hounds upon a hare. Even at the most destructive age of boyhood his love of animals was profound, and he was never cruel. For hours he would lie watching the smallest specimens of the insect world carrying on their domestic economy, or would wait contentedly for a squirrel to come down to earth or for a mole to peep above it. Presently he developed a love of solitary wandering, which bred dreams, and not always happy dreams, among the cradles of verdure which adorned the hills round Chateau-Thierry. Even when town-life had attracted him so strongly that he found it impossible to break away from it, there was in the depths of his poetic temperament a wild yearn- ing for mother-nature to whom he might tell his woes. In \" Adonis,\" in \" Les Filles de Minee,\" in \" Daphnis et Alcimadure,\" he expresses the need of renouncing cities in order to pour forth secret troubles to the forests and the winds. The hero of the first poem confides his story to the trees and does not win their under- standing ; in the second Cephale leaves civilisation behind him, plunges into the forest and cries aloud 24 Jean de la Fontaine his inmost thoughts. \" Alas ! \" declared the poet in * Daphnis et Alcimadure,\" u it was to the winds that he betrayed his grief.\" Again and again he insisted that the winds were not good listeners, that the trees nodded and shook their wise old heads, but had no comfort to bestow upon the distressed sufferer who made them witness of his bewailings. There are brighter passages in his works in which nature smiles, the joyous sun pours through the glades, and the birds raise their tuneful songs to heaven ; but the wistful note is characteristic, for La Fontaine was not always happy during the time of his early wanderings in the neighbourhood of his home. The small, picturesque town where the poet spent his youth lay on the confines of the ancient provinces of Brie and of Champagne, about fifty miles from Paris in the giniraliti of Soissons. In the elliptical fashion of the day Chateau-Thierry became Chaury. A semi- circle of undulating hills surrounded the buildings. The neighbourhood was beloved, and has been im- mortalised by the artist Corot.1 1 A contemporary description of the place and its inhabitants was written by one Claude Galien in his work \" La Descouverte des Eaus Minerales de Chasteauthierry,\" published in 1630. \" On the banks of this fish-full river of the Marne, forming one of the breasts of the town,\" he wrote, \" several mountains rise adorned with all such beauties as nature lavishes upon the earth, namely, abundance of fruits, delicacy of wines, and fertility of soil. On the summit of one of these hills Thierry in former times caused a magnifi- cent castle to be built (ornamented by architraves, plinths, balustrades, astragals, round towers, and other embellishments), which would now be nothing more than deplorable ruins were it not for the liberality Youth 25 The castle which gave its name to the town was said to have been built originally in the eighth century by Charles Martel to serve as a prison for the feeble Thierry (Theodoric) IV. When La Fontaine was born it had been rebuilt, and belonged to Francois d'Orleans, Comte de Saint-Paul, who married Anne de Caumont, a charming and pious lady. After the Count's death on October 7, 1631, the property reverted to the Crown, and Louis XIII. paid a visit to Chateau- Thierry for the ostensible purpose of taking possession of his dukedom. This royal visit must have been one of the most memorable events of La Fontaine's early years. He was ten when the State carriages bearing Louis XIII. and the great Cardinal Richelieu rolled close by his home on their way to the castle. The King combined business with pleasure at Chateau-Thierry. He was able to supervise the opera- tions of his army under La Force, then about to march into Lorraine, whilst he enjoyed hunting and the lovely forest scenery. He contemplated turning the Chateau into a pleasure resort like Saint-Germain or Fontaine- bleau, and with this end in view paid further visits in 1633 and 1635. In the latter year Anne of Austria of our own prince, who, giving them a renewed lease of life, established their claim to be considered among the finest buildings of the century. On the same slope of the eminence lay a small town with a sufficient population, over which Bellona, Themis, Astraea, and the Charites (the Graces) preside with much dignity. \" The buildings are fine and well constructed, the situation is agree- able, and the view very pleasant. The inhabitants are curious in their dress, courteous in their manners, and polished in their speech.\" 26 Jean de la Fontaine accompanied him. News had arrived at that time of a victory over the Spanish ; and because Louis desired to keep his exultant joy from the Queen, lest it should hurt her feelings, he made a little bonfire in his private apartments. Throwing a number of documents and envelopes into the flames, he cried out, \" Voila le feu de joie de la defaite des Espagnols contre le gre de la Reine.\" The Queen, being informed of what had taken place, gave way to boundless indignation, and a serious quarrel occurred between husband and wife. The Cardinal, who was then at his neighbouring estate, Conde en Brie, was sent for in great haste, and through his intervention a reconciliation was at length arrived at. La Fontaine was now fourteen and had begun his education. D'Olivet, his biographer, said he studied under country masters who taught him nothing but Latin. Freron believed that he learnt his first lessons at Rheims, a town which he loved. It may, however, be regarded as certain that he was sent to the college of Chateau-Thierry, an institute which almost rivalled in popularity the more celebrated universities of Rheims and of Paris. This school was founded in the thirteenth century by Blanche d'Artois, daughter of Robert d'Artois and wife of Henri de Navarre. Left a widow at an early age, she married Edmund, Count of Lancaster, and lived at the Castle of Chateau-Thierry, the estate being a legacy from her first husband. Intent on Youth 27 good and charitable works, she acquired a house in the Rue du Chateau and established classes for boys. Not far from Chateau-Thierry was the monastery of Val-Secret, and she appointed one of the monks to be her private chaplain. Among his duties was that of teaching the children. The name of their first teacher was Jean Leclerc. Writing, grammar, Latin, and of course theology were taught. The school was free to all, and succeeded so amazingly that before long several masters were required. The time spent on education did not wholly preclude games and amusements. One favourite game was called Engueule or Naude, and consisted in throwing sticks at a crown which hung on a cord between two poles. The one who brought down the crown was named King of the Naude. This game was played on the last Monday before Lent. Shrove Tuesday was cele- brated by cock-fights. Holding the victorious cock in his arms, the victor was borne home in triumph after the event. On the Thursday following a new form of entertain- ment was organised. Early in the morning every pupil rode to the college gates on horseback, a sword buckled at his side, his cap adorned with a cockade and a branch of gilded holly.1 Preceded by drummers and musicians, the King of the Naude, wearing his crown and carrying a sceptre, headed the procession. With bared swords they all set out towards Val- 1 Holly was the Bouillon coat-of-arms ; their motto Nul ru s'yfrotU. 28 Jean de la Fontaine Secret, where every one dismounted at the door of the church and chanted an antienne to the Virgin. Then an adjournment was made to the council hall, where the monks were congregated. After a polite speech had been addressed by one of the scholars to the Abbe or his representative, the pupils marched three times round the large centre table, drank to the health of the monks, and then proceeded to seat themselves at a special banqueting-table reserved for them. After the feast the scholars went into the large hall carrying their swords, and there arranged round the table were as many loaves of bread as there were pupils. Again the procession marched three times round the table to the sound of music and drums, and then each youth spiked a loaf with his sword or an iron-pointed stick. After three more turns about the table, they mounted their horses and rode back to the town. When they reached the courtyard of the castle they marched three times round a fountain in the centre, and the King of the Naude fastened a hen to the door of the courtyard leading to the church. He struck the first blow at the poor fowl with his sword, and it was speedily dispatched, amidst the chanting of a joyous song. All these quaint ceremonies were in vogue at the date when La Fontaine was a pupil at the college ; and although the game of Naude was dropped about the middle of the seventeenth century, the cock-fights and Youth 29 slaying of the hen were carried on until the outbreak of the Revolution. It is difficult to say whether La Fontaine played more heartily than he studied. School and school- tasks were alike irksome to him. He seemed to find a melancholy happiness in idling away his time, and probably liked to moon about alone in recreation hours better than to join in the games. Intelligence was not lacking, but his tastes were peculiar, and no amount of discipline succeeded in moulding him to be like other boys. Yet he did not lack companions. His brother Claude, although two years younger than Jean, was probably as far advanced in his studies. The two brothers Maucroix were their chief friends. Maucroix pere> who was an attorney at Noyon, was intimate with the La Fontaines and their relatives, the Pintrels and Jannarts, and this led to the frequent inter- change of visits between the families. M. Maucroix sometimes stayed at Chateau-Thierry with Robert de Joyeuse, Lieutenant du Roi of Champagne, and he also had connections of his own in the town. Perhaps this accounted for his decision to send his two boys, Francois and Louis, to the College. Francois was two years and a half older than La Fontaine, and Louis was older still. The intimacy which sprang up between Jean and Francois lasted till death. It is considered probable that the boys studied in company at Rheims as well as at Chateau-Thierry as suggested by Freron 30 Jean de la Fontaine in his biography ; but no proof of this exists. That the Maucroix and La Fontaines were schoolmates seems to be vouched for by a copy of Lucian (August. Picton. 1 62 1 ) belonging to Pintrel, which contains the names of both Louis Maucroix and La Fontaine, the latter carelessly traced in capital letters printed in a boyish hand. An inscription on the fly-leaf, \" de la Fontaine, bon garcon, fort sage et fort modeste,\" is a characteristic description of the bonhomme of later years. It does not touch upon his qualifications as a student. There is evidence enough in La Fontaine's writings that he did not love knowledge for its own sake, and that he disliked schoolmasters and their scholastic ways. He wrote in his epigram, \" Contre un pedant de College \": \"II est trois points dans l'homme de college, Preemption, injures, mauvais sens.\" And to these three points he added a fourth : \" Qu'il aille voir la cour tant qu'il voudra Jamais la cour ne le decrassera.\" The same contempt of professorial mannerisms and airs is expressed in \" The Schoolboy, the Pedant, and the Owner of a Garden \" (\" Fables,\" bk. ix. 5) : \" I hate all eloquence and reason Expended plainly out of season. Of all the beasts that earth have cursed While they have fed on't, The schoolboy strikes me as the worst — Except the pedant.\" Youth 31 He scoffed openly at \" all critics, pedants, men of endless prose,\" in \" The Boy and the Schoolmaster \" (\"Fables,\" bk. i. 19), which tells the story of the little boy who fell into the Seine, and cried to his teacher to save him, but had to wait until the latter had delivered a lecture on his carelessness. \" No matter what the task, Their precious tongues must teach ; Their help in need you ask, You first must hear them preach.\" \" With the exception of misers,\" wrote Chamfort, his commentator, \" La Fontaine railed most keenly against pedants.\" His own teacher, Malezard, who succeeded Balhan as principal of the College, fared little better at his hands, and it has been suggested that one of the Fables was aimed against this worthy gentleman. Some of the teachers who presided over Chateau- Thierry College did not deserve the scorn attached by La Fontaine to those who excelled in book-learning. One at least of them, so ran the legend, when asked to choose any passage from the classics he liked and to explain it, remained absolutely silent, being unable to utter a word. La Fontaine would have regarded this ignorance as a fault on the right side. Francois Maucroix was more brilliant than La Fontaine at school, although he was no more pains- taking. Maucroix was vivacious, witty, and possessed of a good memory, whilst La Fontaine appeared dull and moody until he was roused. When the time came yi Jean de la Fontaine for the friends to separate temporarily, Maucroix went to the College d'Harcourt in Paris, and the future fabulist, having been influenced by some friend, entered the Oratory in the Rue Saint-Honore. \"On the 27th (April 1 641) M. Jean de la Fontaine, aged twenty, has been received so that he may pursue the pious studies of our brethren,\" ran the entry in the register. Adry, the librarian of the Oratory, amplified this bare state- ment of fact. \" This passing taste for the ecclesiastical profession may have been inspired in him by G. Hericart, Canon of Soissons, who at this time presented him with some pious books.\" Here there appears to be a discrepancy of dates. M. G. Hericart was a nephew of the Marie Hericart who became La Fontaine's wife. He was born in 1664 ; and if he gave theological works to his uncle by marriage, it was some time after such presents could have had the supposed effect. Adry probably confused the donor of the pious works with some other priest. At the age of twenty the budding poet was impressionable to any idea which entered his head. In October 1641 Claude followed Jean to the Oratory, and having more taste for the monastic life he remained until 1650. When Claude came Jean left in order to go to the Seminary of Saint-Magloire, where he remained a year before definitely deciding that the Church could not offer him a suitable career. w At the age of nineteen,\" wrote d'Olivet, \" he went to the Oratory, and eighteen months later left it 33 Youth 35 again. When one realised the kind of man he was, it was easier to see why he left it than to imagine why he had ever thought of entering a house where it was necessary to submit to so many rules.\" The feelings with which he regarded this episode of his life are not on record, unless a remark he made to Boileau may be taken as indicating them : \" I would far rather be occupied in reading the poets than ' The Practice of Perfect Christianity,' by Rodriguez,\" he said. According to one account he went from Saint- Magloire to Juilly, but all that is heard of him there was that having tied a thread to his cap he dangled it out of the window of his cell and tried to catch the birds and butterflies. Nothing could be more characteristic than this glimpse of him. In the meantime Maucroix went steadily on with his legal studies and succeeded in winning a few cases. He said himself that he only pleaded at the Bar five or six times. Charles de la Fontaine, anxious that his son should take up one of the solid professions, and acquiescing in his decision not to enter the Church, suggested that he too should study for the Bar ; and in fact he read so well as to be distinguished in a legal document of 1649 by the title of \" advocat en la cour du parlement.\" Neither of the young men persevered with their work. La Fontaine very soon returned to his native city, and Maucroix, feeling perhaps that self- 3 36 Jean de la Fontaine assurance was lacking, grew lazy, fell into the hands of gay companions, frequented the ruellcs, entered the salons at the heels of Conrart, Voiture, Chapelain, and Sarrasin, and cultivated the ways of a precieux. He was young and made himself liked, but he was not clever enough to leave his mark, coming into com- petition as he did with the older and more brilliant men of the literary world. He was ordered by his father to leave Paris and offer his services to his old friend Robert de Joyeuse. Mme de Joyeuse, who fully approved of the smattering of culture which Maucroix had brought with him from the capital, appointed him her secretary, and he followed in her train from chateau to chateau and back to Paris. During a stay in Chateau-Thierry at this time, Maucroix once more enjoyed the society of La Fon- taine, who had been trying to adapt himself once more to home life and forestry. Although their friendship had been without a break, it is possible they had not met since their days at college. The friends had many traits in common ; the same taste for pleasure, the same inclination towards poetry, the same disdain for wealth, and the same warm affections. Two new interests were entering into the lives of these young men — love and poetry. There is a very well-known story told by d'Olivet about the fabulist's first awakening to the beauties of verse, an awakening that did not occur until he had reached the age of twenty-two. One day an officer Youth 37 who was staying at Chateau-Thierry in winter quarters happened to read to him, with much dramatic emphasis, the Ode by Malherbe \" On the attempt committed upon the person of Henri le Grand, December 19, 1605.\" He listened, rapt in transports of joy, admiration, and astonishment. \" The experience of a man, born with a great disposition for music, who, after having lived in wild woods, suddenly hears the sound of a harpsichord beautifully played, was the impression made by harmonious poetry upon M. de la Fontaine,\" wrote d'Olivet. Once roused, La Fontaine became a different person. No longer dreaming or dazed, he was alert, happy, and full of enthusiasm. His eyes sparkled, he spoke rapidly, he made quick gestures, and exhi- bited all the characteristics of the artistic temperament at its best. He began to read Malherbe at once, and was so drawn to his writings that after having spent many nights in learning them by heart he hurried by day into the woods, there to declaim all he had learnt. At the hour he lived in a beautiful world of imagina- tion, and became inspired with an overmastering desire to versify. His first attempts were not altogether successful. Seeing that he ran the risk of becoming a mere imitator, his friend and relative, Pintrel, advised him to study various works by great masters before attempting to produce poetry of his own. He drew his attention especially to the classics, Horace, Virgil, and Terence, as well as to the best French writers, and La Fontaine set himself to profit by this counsel. 38 Jean de la Fontaine Maucroix, on the other hand, experienced no such sudden putting forth of poetical blossoms. Since the days of his youth he had written sparklets of verse, and his poems date from 1638, five years before La Fontaine bethought himself of emulation. But in affairs of the heart, if we are to believe all that is told, the younger man was also the more precocious. Tallemant des Reaux mentioned more than one intrigue in which La Fontaine cut anything but a noble figure. He suggested that some of the flirtations were hardly innocent, or that, if they were, it was not La Fontaine's fault. He was seen one wintry night hurrying through country lanes carrying a dark lantern and wearing white boots, an article of clothing which at that period denoted the gallant fop.1 The preoccupied schoolboy, the idle dreamer, was waking up to some purpose. Suspicion naturally attached to a young country bumpkin who sported showy footwear and gay raiment far better suited to the extravagant courtier, and who tripped lightly through the woods to a rendezvous when he ought to have been at home in bed. No wonder that gossip 1 Chevalier Grammont wore similar boots below a cassock, which was not long enough to conceal them and his gilt spurs, when he was introduced at the Court of Louis XIII. in a parti-coloured attire, half ecclesiastical, half military. M. d'Hauterive, hearing that his brother, the Keeper of the Seals, was condemned to punishment by the same king, set off to ride through the night, in the hope of saving him, without stopping to change the white boots in which he had been spending the evening in the company of the fair. Youth 39 clung to his name, and that his amour with the wife of the Lieutenant du Roi of Chateau-Thierry became notorious. The lady possessed a little dog, and La Fontaine abducted the animal, with the intention of facilitating a stolen visit to her room. But his plans were frustrated by the unforeseen arrival of a second lady, and Tallemant des Reaux told of his reassuring apology to his enchantress, who might have been frightened by his presence in her room — \" Fear nothing. It is only La Fontaine.\" Was it strange that his seductive manner found this fair dame but half cruel and many others only too kind ? Through- out his life the poet was influenced as only a man of his temperament could be influenced by women. He found their charms irresistible, their friendship sweet, their care of him invaluable. His relations with them bring out clearly the fact of his dependent, gentle, and clinging nature. Whilst La Fontaine dallied with light amours, Maucroix indulged in a grand passion. He was indiscreet enough to fall in love with Henriette de Joyeuse, daughter of his patroness. This young lady, wrote Tallemant, \"had wit, sang prettily, had the most charming figure possible, and eyes which were exceedingly fine. But with all these advantages she was not a great beauty, though, taking everything into consideration, it was hardly possible to discover a more delightful person. She was only four [fourteen] when Maucroix, then a youth, following, or desiring to 40 Jean de la Fontaine follow, the career of barrister, began to feel sentiment for her. . . . As he was good-looking, was gentle and intelligent, made as good verses and wrote as good letters as any one, at fifteen she had much affection for him.\" The difference in rank and fortune made an alliance between the two impossible, and Henriette was sought in marriage by the Marquis de Lenoncourt, who died on the battlefield. When she became the wife of the Marquis des Brosses, Maucroix felt that he had nothing left to live for. They met again some time after her marriage, which proved unhappy, and found that their mutual passion had abated not a whit. Seeing that Henriette was only too willing to throw herself into an intrigue which would have been very inexpedient, Maucroix decided to say farewell to the woman who had deeply fascinated him. The follies and variabilities of youth were to receive a check in the case of both the poets. Maucroix accepted a canonry at Rheims in April 1847, and La Fontaine was urged by his father into bonds of matrimony, which were designed to steady and establish him. Realising that a serious step was in front of both himself and his friend, at the parting hour La Fontaine wrote his fable, \" Le Meunier, son Fils et l'Ane,\" which he dedicated to Maucroix, and in which he pointed out the difficulties of making the choice of a career and at the same time of satisfying public opinion that the chosen course was a wise one. Youth 41 \" A quoi me re\"soudrai-je ? II est temps que j'y pense. Vous connoissez mon bien, mon talent, ma naissance : Dois-je dans la province dtablir mon sejour, Prendre emploi dans l'armee, ou bien charge a la cour? Tout au monde est mele d'amertume et de charmes : La guerre a ses douceurs, l'hymen a ses alarmes. Si je suivois mon gout, je saurois ou buter, Mais j'ai les miens, la cour, le peuple a contenter.\"1 \"Fables,\" bk. iii. i (first published in 1668). La Fontaine urged on his friend, but desired to escape his own fate. Taking a wife seemed to him a more momentous deed than accepting a canonry. \" Hymen hath its alarms,\" he wrote, and it was the very eve of his marriage. The phrase expressed his forebodings for the future. The same thought was repeated again and again in his writings. \"Le seul nom de l'hymen me fait frdmir de crainte \" 3 he wrote, pursuing a favourite theme ; and again, \" J'ai vu beau- coup d'hymens, aucuns d'eux ne me tentent.\" 8 In later years a longing note appeared in his writings, as though he realised that he had missed the best. His fears were fulfilled. He was to experience discomfort and dissatisfaction, caused by clash of temperament in his own ill-chosen mating. 1 '* What shall I do ? 'Tis time I chose profession. You know my fortune, birth, and disposition ; Ought I to make the country my resort, Or seek the army, or to rise at court ? There's naught but mixeth bitterness with charms : War hath its pleasures, hymen its alarms. 'Twere nothing hard to take my natural bent, But I've a world of people to content.' 2 \" L'Eunuque.\" s \" Le mal marie.\" CHAPTER 11 MARRIAGE ON November ioth, 1647, La Fontaine was married to Marie Hericart. It is unlikely that love or even mutual inclination entered into the bargain. There was some fluttering in the respective households before the alliance became an established fact. D'Olivet wrote of the poet : \" Although he had little taste for marriage, he agreed to it to please his relatives.\" Tallemant said : \" His father induced him to marry, and he did it to oblige him.\" It was customary for parents to arrange suitable marriages for their children, and this case was no exception to the rule. Probably La Fontaine, who always moved along the line of least resistance, never questioned their choice for a moment, much as he may have regretted their decision that he must marry at all. He had now reached the mature age of twenty-six, and had as little stability of character as before. He was glad to be free of the Church, glad to play the Don Juan of the locality, and glad to turn his attention to verse-making. When everything went well with him he was exuberant, when difficulties loomed he withdrew 42 Marriage 43 into his shell. He had no wish to settle down ; he realised that marriage was a lottery in which he was likely to draw a blank. There was no eligible woman among his acquaintances for whom he had any affec- tion. He had already frittered away a good deal of that commodity. He was not fond of deciding for himself, and felt convinced that some one else would be more felicitous in choosing for him. He was something of a fatalist, and not easy to handle. La Fontaine perei concerned on account of his son's light-mindedness, had promised as a bait to give him the succession of one of his well-paid appointments. There was no better way to steady Jean, he thought, than by providing him with a definite occupation, whilst the cares of a household must naturally accustom him to responsibility. La Fontaine, although he had no taste for business, did not object to draw an income. He had felt the need of resources of his own. If mar- riage would supply the need, then marriage it should be. As for the woman he was to marry, she seemed to him a bright and attractive girl who was young enough to be moulded. She had won a great deal of admiration in the surrounding villages, and no doubt La Fontaine appreciated her youth and freshness, and did not realise that her will was stronger than his own and that she would never become amenable to his influence. From Marie's point of view there was not much to be said in favour of the proposed match. At the age 44 Jean dc la Fontaine of fifteen she had already had more than one admirer. A boy-and-girl affair between a dashing young soldier cousin and herself had left her affections entangled. Most girls of her position and temperament had allowed their thoughts to dwell upon a romance of which the hero was quite ineligible as a husband. She had expensive tastes, like her chosen bridegroom, who, it would appear, was little likely to have money enough to indulge them. Again, Marie was inclined to look down upon most of her provincial neighbours, because she had been in Paris and regarded culture as an in- dispensable adjunct to existence. Had she been a little older, a little more diplomatic, and a little less hedged in by the conventional methods of the day — in short, had she been rather more modern — she would have turned up her somewhat pointed nose at the proposed match ; she would have begged her parents to fix their gaze upon a man who was better able to provide more attractive prospects and a less sober future. The Hericarts of Ferte Milon were as well connected as the La Fontaines. The male Hericarts, Guillaume and Louis, Louis and Guillaume, grand- father and father, son and grandson, made an imposing array of lieutenants, civil and criminal, perpetual mayors, and such - like dignitaries.1 The Hericarts were related to the Jannarts, and one Jannart had married a La Fontaine. Another Jannart was King's 1 The French official posts were as numerous and varied as they are to-day, and cannot be rendered accurately into English. Marriage 45 Councillor and deputy to the procureur gineral. This Jannart, Jacques by name, was Marie's uncle, and with him had originated the idea of the marriage. His relations with the mighty Fouquet greatly in- fluenced the poet's life. Marie had still another distant cousin, who in some years' time was to shed an added lustre on the family records, and whose boyish surroundings were inter- woven to some extent with her own. This was the poet Racine, whose mother, nee Jeanne Sconin, was descended, as were the Hericarts, from one Pierre Drouart de Norroy, who lived in the fifteenth century. To follow an intricate pedigree no farther, it must suffice to say that Marie was the daughter of Louis H6ricart and his wife Agnes Petit, and that she was born at La Ferte Milon, and baptized in the parish of Saint- Vaast on April 26th, 1633. To judge from her portrait, painted in later years, and attributed to Mignard, Marie was not at all bad-looking. She wore her hair in charming ringlets clustering round her well-shaped head. Her eyes were large and alert. Her lips were full and rosy, perhaps a trifle sensuous. The less said about her nose the better, for it was like her husband's, aquiline and rather too long. She wore a slightly supercilious air, and it is obvious that she was hard to please. Freron said she was beautiful, and d'Olivet wrote that she was wanting neither in wit nor beauty. She doubtless had both pride and dignity. From her 46 Jean de la Fontaine early girlhood she seemed ready to appraise highly her own value. Perhaps she was justified in this, for she was certainly better educated than girls in her position and of her class usually expected to be. She had had advantages. What they were is not definitely known, but it is probable that her studies benefited by the presence in La Ferte Milon of certain learned men, the little group of the Solitaries of Port Royal, who took refuge there in July 1638 at the first dispersion. Two of the most distinguished men of the teaching staff\", Le Maitre and Claude Lancelot, lodged with the family of Vitart, the head of which was great- uncle of Racine by marriage, and therefore connected with the Hericarts. The poet who was later to be a pupil of this school of Jansenists was not born until the year after the invasion of the refugists, but Marie was nearly six and precociously quick. Before long she was sent to Paris to stay with her aunt, Mme Jannart, and by the time she returned to her native place she was well furnished with knowledge of various kinds, and was quite au fait with the ways of the world. The poor wits of La Ferte Milon regarded her as a marvel, and wondered at her stylishness. She was admired by all, adulated, petted by her relatives, and in a fair way to be spoilt for the hum-drum life of a sleepy country town. She had had her chance. Mme Jannart had introduced her to Mme Fouquet and other celebrities in society. She had seen some of the mightiest among the Marriage 47 mighty, and had learnt to speak the language that the literary women spoke in the salons. This was the day when the prkieuses were at their height, and a young provincial maiden who had all her wits about her could easily pick up the jargon of the ruelles when the opportunity came. No wonder that on her return the number of her suitors increased day by day. But she took little notice of them. She was only attracted by the dashing young cousin, Poignant, and he was impossible as a husband. So Jannart was encouraged to carry on the nego- tiations, and the La Fontaine-Hericart marriage was celebrated in due course. Where the wedding took place is not known, but the marriage contract was signed at La Ferte Milon. It provided that the bride should receive 20,000 livres from her grandfather and 10,000 from her mother. La Fontaine inherited a legacy from his mother on her death, which had occurred previously. Under normal conditions the establishment of the newly married couple would have been adequately provided for, but the conditions were not normal, for neither of the parties to the agreement was capable of steering the ship, Marie because she was too young and inexperienced, La Fontaine because he was too lazy and preoccupied. After a few years he began selling some of his property in order to meet his liabilities. No portrait of the poet at the time of his marriage is in existence, but to judge from those of later date 48 Jean de la Fontaine he was good-looking in a rather florid style ; his manners were not of the most refined, indeed they were still heavy and countrified. He was of average height, and his figure was good, but thick-set ; perhaps Marie called him clumsy. He dressed carelessly, but loved fine clothes, and wore them when his purse permitted. Marie too had a taste for finery, and her leading trait was that she was proud. D'Olivet described her character as very much like that of Mme Honcsta in the \" Nouvelle de Belphegor \" : \" Belle et bien faite . . . Mais d'un orgueil extreme.\" But contemporaries existed who affirmed that on the contrary she had a most gentle and pliant character, \" as much to her husband as towards all those who lived with her,\" and that the poet had not thought of her at all when writing \"Belphegor,\" any more than he drew typical portraits of people of the day when he exposed absurdities or vices.1 Perhaps natural reserve and a certain independence of character were responsible for the misconceptions which many people entertained with regard to Marie de la Fontaine. Glimpses into some of the peculiarities of her nature appear in one of the poet's letters from Limoges written fifteen years after their marriage. \" You never cared to read any travels but those of the Knights of the Round Table,\" he declared, \" but ours well deserve that you should read them. Never- 1 \"Les Memoires de Trevoux,\" July 1755, p. 1718. Marriage 49 theless you will find in them matters hardly suited to your taste. I shall make it my business to dress them up, if I can, so as to please you, and it will be left for you to praise my good intentions even if they should not be attended with success. It may even come to pass that if you enjoy my narrative you will learn to appreciate more serious reading in future. You neither play nor work, nor do you attend to the house- hold, and, apart from the hours which your kind friends devote to you out of charity, you have no amusement except reading novels. You have almost exhausted the stock. You have read the old ones so often that you know them. There are very few new ones, and of these few not all are good. So often you are left destitute. Consider, I pray you, what a good thing it would be if in my jocular fashion I had accustomed you to read history, dealing either with places or persons. You would possess something which would preserve you from ennui all your life ; provided that there should be no intention of committing it to memory, and still less of quoting it. It is not a good quality in a woman to be learned ; and it is a very bad one to wish to appear so.\" * There is a sting in the remark hardly worthy of the gentle poet. He had suffered in some way, but the manner of it is not quite clear. A little later he re- ferred to the novels again in a letter of September 19th. Writing of the daughter of a relative whom he had 1 Letter of August 25th, 1663. 50 Jean de la Fontaine already described as charming and gentle in character, he continued : \" I should not know how to tell you anything else about her, were it not that she loves novels very much. You, who love them so much also, will be able to judge the consequences.\" Undoubtedly Mile de la Fontaine — at this time Madame was only used for married ladies of quality — was a little difficult. She had pretensions. Perhaps she did not care for housekeeping, and was angry because she could not afford a number of servants like the fine ladies in town ; perhaps she only grew tired of it when she found that housekeeping for La Fontaine was a very thankless task, that he never came in time for meals, that his purse was always empty and that he made no efforts to fill it. The poet, on the other hand, was horrified to find that he was married to one he regarded as a blue-stocking. In this respect he was very human. Even Mile de Scudery's efforts to put the learned woman on a pedestal so that every one might have the opportunity of admiring her had failed to make her beloved, and the ordinary husband wanted a good housekeeper and companion. She must look to him for all her intellectual fare, she must never wish to think for herself, and she was utterly impossible to live with if she went so far as to desire to commit her thoughts to paper. If La Fontaine's wife ever scribbled romances in the privacy of her own apartments, and it seems quite likely that she did, at least they never saw JEAN DE LA FONTAINE After the painting by Rigault. Engraved by Edelinck 51 Marriage 53 the light in print. One of her biographers, M. Salesse, goes so far as to hint that various members of the Historical and Archaeological Society of Chateau-Thierry had manuscripts bearing her signature in their possession. Perish the thought that she wished to be an author ! She had not even learnt how to be a woman and a good wife. Nor does proof exist that she was a good mother. La Fontaine was to all appearances an equally in- considerate husband and father. His only son, Charles, was born in October 1653, and Maucroix was appointed godfather. In a desultory kind of way the poet's affections must have been awakened, for in the letter to his wife of August 25th, 1663 — that is to say, when Charles was nearly ten — he wrote, \" Give my love to our little marmot ', and tell him that I shall perhaps bring him a pretty little girl to keep him company and be his playfellow.\" Moreover, when he was appealing to the Due de Bouillon about the heavy fine imposed upon him for using the title esquire, he pointed out that his pecuniary responsibilities extended to his wife and child as well as to his brother. And yet as time passed it became clear that to La Fontaine family ties had but little significance and paternity was neither a privilege nor a pleasure : \"Toi done, qui que tu sois, 6 pere de famille, Et je ne t'ai jamais envie cet honneur.\" : \" Fables,\" bk. xi. 3. 1 \"O thou who head'st a family, An honour never grudged by me.\" 54 Jean dc la Fontaine He apparently took no interest in his son's education nor in his future career. Marais said that Maucroix taught the boy. Freron gave quite a different account, declaring that the poet looked after him until he was fourteen, and then put him in the hands of a certain M. de Harlay, who became procureur general. Freron was responsible for the anecdote that La Fontaine and his son met in later years accidentally at a house where both visited, that La Fontaine did not recognise the young man, but finding that he conversed well and wittily he inquired his name. When the truth was made clear to him he remarked : \" Indeed ! I am very pleased to hear it.\" Another variation of the same legend was told by Titon du Tillet. La Fontaine when visiting Dr. du Pin met his son on the staircase but failed to recognise him. When presented in the reception room La Fontaine inquired of his host who the young man could be. \" What, you do not know your own son ? \" cried du Pin. La Fontaine, after reflecting a little, answered with an embarrassed air, \" I seem to remember having seen him somewhere.\" Probably the truth is that when the poet shut the door of his heart against his wife he shut it also against his boy, and that the reasons and date of this unfortunate rupture, whether it was of slow growth or the result of a single disagreement, have never been fully drawn forth from the mists of obscurity. A great deal of the blame for the unhappy marriage Marriage 55 has been placed upon the poet's shoulders. It was well known that he was fond of distractions, that he treated his wife with a carelessness and forgetfulness that on the surface seem culpable in the extreme. But there must have been something to say on the other side, for La Fontaine had a large heart and deep affections. He was like an over-grown, clumsy child who required constant care from some grave, untiring competent person, one who felt both motherly and wifely love for him. He was not the kind of individual who could act the part of a model husband to a flighty young woman who knew nothing of the prosaic side of life, and required a good deal of looking after herself. The two were obviously very ill-suited, and it may be safely assumed that there were faults and perhaps grave faults on both sides. Marie de la Fontaine complained, according to the account of Tallemant des Reaux, that her husband frequently forgot that he was a husband at all ; but the same chronicler who wrote within the first ten years of their married life brought up a grievance on the other side. He declared that Marie was a coquette who \" had behaved badly enough for some time.\" Only one interpretation of such a statement is possible. Believing her husband's neglect meant that he had no love for her, she flirted with another man or allowed her affections to stray. The young officer of dragoons, who had been sternly forbidden by her parents to make love to their daughter, was not persuaded to 5 6 Jean de la Fontaine give up his suit because relatives arranged a marriage of convenience for the maiden on whom he had set his heart. Perhaps for a time the impetuous young man left Marie alone, but he was not a stranger to the family ; he was her cousin, and, family ties being very close in France, it would have been extraordinary if the pair had never met again after the wedding. From La Ferte Milon to Chateau-Thierry was not very far, and the young soldier soon appeared in the latter town and tried to carry matters on at the same place where they had been broken off. The cousins were better suited to be friends than Marie and her poet. Poignant had talents, he was keen-witted and amusing, something of a gay dog who never refused a glass of sparkling wine or a feast with any one. It was quite natural that he should regard Marie, the greatly admired, the spoilt pet of the family, with jealous eyes, and that he should think her husband something of a bore and far too old for her. It would be unfair to take away Marie's character without facts to go upon. However much a husband may be unfaithful to his wife, she is not permitted to retaliate without losing the sympathy of all her acquaintances. Although Poignant, already a captain in the army, remained at Chateau-Thierry, some distance from his own people, while La Fontaine was living in the house of Mme de la Sabliere, nothing conclusive can be deduced from that. La Fontaine Marriage 57 was secure in the knowledge of his wife's coldness, and it is very probable that Poignant found her equally- cold. Some light was thought to have been thrown on the position by the story of a duel between La Fontaine and Poignant told by Louis Racine in his Life of his father. He represented Poignant as an elderly man and a friend of his father, which was rather misleading, for in reality the soldier was seven years younger than La Fontaine, and only five or six years older than Marie. \" This is the story I heard of the curious affair he had with La Fontaine,\" wrote Racine. \" Some one took it into his head to ask him why he allowed M. Poignant to visit at his house every day. \" ' And why,' said La Fontaine, * should he not come there ? He is my best friend.' \" c That is not what people are saying,' replied the other ; * they make out that he only goes to see Mme de la Fontaine.' \" * They are quite wrong,' he went on ; c but what ought I to do about it? ' \" ' They seem to think you should ask for satisfaction, sword in hand, of him who thus dishonours you.' \" ' Ah well,' said La Fontaine, { I will demand it.' \" The next day he went to M. Poignant's house at four o'clock in the morning, and found him in bed. \" c Get up,' he said, 'and let us go out.' His friend asked him what he wanted of him and what could be the pressing business that had brought him there so early. 5 8 Jean de la Fontaine \" • I will inform you of that,' replied La Fontaine * when we have set forth.' \" Poignant rose, dressed, went out with him, and followed him to the Chartreux, asking him many times where they were going. \" c You shall know all about it very soon,' answered La Fontaine. And when they had passed the Chartreux he added, ' My friend, we must fight.' \" Poignant, surprised, asked what he had done to offend him, and pointed out to him that the duel would not be an equal one. ' I am a soldier,' he said, * and you have never drawn a sword.' \" • That does not matter,' responded La Fontaine ; * people think I ought to fight you.' \" Poignant, after making futile objections, drew his sword to oblige him, quickly mastered La Fontaine, and then asked him what it was all about. \" ' People say,' said La Fontaine, ' that you do not come to our house every day to see me, but to see my wife.' \" ' Oh, my dear fellow,' replied Poignant, * I should never have guessed that that was the cause of your anxiety, and I promise that I will never again set foot in your house.' \" ' On the contrary,' went on La Fontaine, shaking him by the hand. c I have done what is required of me. Now I expect you to visit us every day, as usual, or else 1 shall have to fight you over again ! ' \" Tallemant wrote that when La Fontaine was told Marriage 59 that some one was flirting with his wife he replied : \" Ma foi, he may do as he likes. I shall not trouble myself about it. He will leave her as I did.\" His indifference caused Marie much grief. Great child of genius that he was, he forgot many things. He wanted to dream and to ruminate. His heedlessness of the little worries of everyday life affected the domestic happiness. Ways and means were nothing to him ; duties and responsibilities he thrust aside. Several stories concerning him bring forward this characteristic. Tallemant des Riaux described an incident that probably happened before his marriage. The poet's father, who was carrying on a lawsuit, sent him on an important errand, saying that a great deal depended on his celerity. La Fontaine started off, but no sooner had he reached the street than he forgot what his father had told him. He met some of his boon companions, who asked him whether he had no business to see to. \" None,\" he replied, and went to the theatre with them. Another time, when on his way to Paris, he had a wallet of important papers fixed to his saddle- bag. The wallet, being loosely fastened, became detached. The driver of the mails passed the same way a little later, picked up the wallet, and seeing La Fontaine asked him whether he had lost any- thing. Hardly comprehending his meaning, the youth looked all round him, and then said with assurance, t€ No 1 I have lost nothing.\" 60 Jean de la Fontaine \" Here is a bag I found,\" said the driver. \"Ah,\" cried La Fontaine, \" that is my bag, and in it is all my worldly wealth.\" And taking it in his hand he hastened off. Figuratively this story contains much truth. La Fontaine scattered his worldly wealth right and left, without knowing how much he had. His letters to his uncle by marriage give an account of many financial transactions. In 1653, before his wife was of age and was able to agree and ratify the act, he sold his farm at Oulchie-le-Chastel, with farmhouse, barns, stables, and some sixty acres of land, to one M. Francois Desmazure. Three years later he ex- changed another farm at Damar for some land at Chatillon-sur-Marne belonging to his brother-in-law, and turned it into ready money at the first oppor- tunity. Two years later, on the death of his father in the spring of 1658, he found himself embarrassed by debts, amounting to some 25,000 livres, not counting 11,977 livres due to him for money lent and interest thereon. His father's other creditors were the Pidoux family, Maucroix and Jannart. Since 1649 La Fontaine had had an agreement with his brother Claude by which the latter had ceded all his possessions to Jean in exchange for an annual payment of 1,100 livres, to become due after his father's death. When the time came for this deed to be executed Claude repented of his bargain and desired to be let off. The poet, who did not care for this shilly-shallying, Marriage 6 1 offered to revoke the act if Claude would agree to take his share of his father's inheritance and at the same time burden himself with his share of the debts. This put the matter in quite a fresh light, and the brothers came to fresh terms in a document dated April 24th, 1658, in which Claude ceded all his rights anew, \" in order to free himself from debts and charges of succession incurred by his father and mother, and to promote peace and friendship between himself and his brother,\" for the sum of 8,225 livres. Overwhelmed by these responsibilities, and no more accustomed than before to suit the cost of his tastes to the amount in his purse, pecuniary difficulties led to a separation of property between La Fontaine and his wife. This deed was executed in the autumn of 1658, and gave rise to the idea that it was incompatibility of temper which had caused the estrangement. A great deal of gossip had arisen about the La Fontaine menage. The poet was hardly more circumspect after marriage than before, and took no pains to conceal his infidelities. There was an affair with a certain abbess, if Tallemant is to be believed, in which La Fontaine behaved towards his wife without the delicacy of feeling which might have been expected of him. A separation of property was a very different thing from a separation mensa et thoro, and in a letter to Jannart dated February 1st, 1659, the poet made light of it. Gaming and extravagance had been mentioned among his sins, and he indignantly repudiated both accusations. 6 2 Jean de la Fontaine His protestations erred on the side of being too forcible. It is difficult to believe that his statements agreed with the absolute truth. \" What you have been informed about borrowing and gambling is quite incorrect,\" he wrote ; \" if you believed it, it seems to me that you could not have done less than to inflict a reproof on me. I deserve it on account of the respect I have for you and on account of the affection you have always shown me. I hope that another time you will be more angry with me, and if I happen to lose my money you will not laugh. Mile de la Fontaine will not be grateful to one who gives false advice, which is as bad policy as it is self- interested. Our separation may have made some stir at La Ferte, but not much at Chateau-Thierry, and no one regarded it as necessary.\" It is quite possible that the deed in question was drawn up simply as a means of protecting her estate from being claimed in payment of hi§ father's debts. In this case it is not surprising to find that although the ties which bound La Fontaine to his wife were loosening they still had some interests and some friends in common. A literary coterie was held at Chateau-Thierry, of which Racine, Pintrel, Maucroix, and others were members. Marie prided herself on her salon of real and pretended savants, and tried to give it the necessary air of preciosity. Racine referred to her little gatherings in a letter to La Fontaine on July 4th, 1662. \"Return Marriage 63 to mc, I beg you, the trifle of the * Bains de Venus.' Have the kindness to tell me what you think of it. Till then I shall waive my judgment. I dare not believe anything to be good or bad until you have told me what you think first. I make the same supplication to your Academy of Chateau-Thierry, especially to Mile de la Fontaine.\" The M Academy \" had then been in vogue at least four years, for La Fontaine mentioned it to Jannart in March 1658, when he invoked the thanks of the Academy on the head of his uncle if he should \" interpret the laws in favour of Mme de Pont-de-Bourg.\" l Besides La Fontaine and his wife, his sister Anne de Jouy, now married to M. Henri de Villemontee, appears to have been one of the judges of the work of the young local poets. There is no record of what took place at the gatherings. They were probably an imitation of similar functions in town. Marie played the part of the carping critic, and La Fontaine was the lion. He read and recited his own early verses, which he could do remarkably well when he chose, or declaimed the chief passages written by another and made his own comments upon their literary merit, or perhaps more often upon their want of it. But there were days when he took no active part in the entertainment of those assembled in his house — 1 A certain lady in whose affairs he was interested, chiefly perhaps because she possessed a charming daughter. 64 Jean de la Fontaine days when his own desire to create drove every other thought but composition out of his head. Once when a supper had been arranged, at which Pintrel and Maucroix were to be present, it happened that, when the meal was served, La Fontaine was missing. As this was not unusual, and he was always allowed a certain amount of latitude at meal-times, the others sat down and began to eat. Presently, to their astonishment, the door opened and the poet appeared attired in a shirt, a calepon, and a night-cap, his feet being devoid of socks. With staring eyes, which appeared to see nothing, he strode through the dining- room in this unusual attire, and passed into the study, which lay beyond it. There he remained about half an hour, no one daring to disturb him. After the lapse of this interval he made his reappearance, rubbing his hands in apparent satisfaction, and, without a word to the assembled guests, he went upstairs to bed. His wife and the others were anxious to see how he had spent the time. On the table in the study, which was but dimly lit, lay a newly transcribed manuscript. It was the famous fable of \" Les deux Pigeons.\" J Exaggerated as the story may be, it represents no doubt the absorption and preoccupation, accompanied by reverie, which were the invariable prelude to the outpouring of poetical genius. This same study served La Fontaine often as a 1 \"Album des Modes,\" 1830: \"Confessions d'un homme de cour contemporain de Louis XIV., ' par MM. Dusauldroy et Charrin. Marriage 65 retreat where he could flee from the annoying sights and sounds of the household machinery. It is easy to picture the litter of papers lying there undusted and undisturbed, the bookcase full of the volumes he treasured — Terence, Boccaccio, d'Urfe's \"FAstree,\" Horace, JEsop, and a number of others, the diction- aries which he used when studying the classics, the broken pens lying where they fell from his careless fingers, the medley of cast-off garments, firelocks, knives, measures, and other implements required in his trade of forestry. Probably he never remained for long tied to his desk, or shut within these walls. His muse was of the outdoor variety, and appeared most to advantage when he worked in the sunny fields. He was always ready to profit by the interests at- taching to a country walk. He flitted from idea to idea like a bee from flower to flower, humming in unison with nature. Best of all he liked to sit on a tree-trunk or lie in the scented grass. Sometimes he perched himself on a boulder within view of an ant-hill, so that he could watch the busy insects at their work. The river-bank, a grassy slope, a clearing in the trees, all served him as a background for poetic thoughts. By rights his mind should have been occupied with the details of his profession, in valuing timber, in counting the head of deer, in considering improvements in the drainage, in planning new embankments and ditches. Instead of practical details, he contemplated abstracts — the temperament of the various animals, 66 Jean de la Fontaine and their destiny in the scheme of nature. He endowed them with special qualities — the lion with grandeur and power, the fox with wealth and cunning, the ass with a heritage of simplicity, and the ape with coxcombry. To man he gave no place in this vision, assigning to him the mistakes that caused confusion and chaos in an otherwise beautiful universe. Yet to man he was to owe many good things which he found indispensable to his material welfare, and the day was close at hand when he was to solicit his favours. At that period it was the custom for poets to appeal for protection in high quarters. CHAPTER III FOUQUET \" l\\/TONSEIGNEUR> JLV-L \" I am not vain enough to hope that these fruits of my solitary hours could ever please you : the finest orchards of Parnassus produce but little that is worthy of your notice . . . yet if the subject seems beautiful enough, and I am so fortunate as to be favoured with some moments of your leisure, do not judge me by the merit of my work, but by the respect with which I sign myself your humble and obedient servant.\" When La Fontaine wrote this dedication of his poem \" Adonis \" to Fouquet, he was living in hopes that his verses might prove acceptable to the great personage who had but to beckon if he wished to call the most renowned writers of the day to his side. La Fontaine had done little enough till then to prove the nature of his genius. In 1654 he had published a translation of Terence's \" Eunuchus,\" but this had not made him famous, and he had nothing else except a few odes, and these not of the best, to submit as an earnest of what was to come. 67 68 Jean dc la Fontaine Great possibilities for the poet lay in the result of an introduction to the all-powerful Superintendent of Finances, who was one of the most influential patrons of the arts. At that time Fouquet's career showed no indications of its meteoric passage and disastrous anti- climax. Born in 1615, Nicolas was the third son of Francois Fouquet, King's Councillor. His father's family came from Brittany, and for many generations had been connected with commerce. His mother had been a Maupeou before her marriage, a name renowned in parliamentary annals. At the age of twenty Fouquet was appointed Master of Requests. Under the auspices of Richelieu, who was reorganising the body of in- tendants, he was then made Intendant to the army on the northern frontier of France. Presently he was called to Paris, and came under the protection of Cardinal Mazarin. In 1650 he became procureur general to the Parlement of Paris, and used his influence on behalf of his protector, serving him faithfully in his misfortunes as he had done in his hours of triumph. He claimed the reward of his fidelity in January 1653, when, the post of Superintendent of the Finances having fallen vacant, he wrote to Mazarin a letter begging for the much-sought-after appointment. Among the many candidates was Abel Servien, whose claims were equally insistent with those of Fouquet. After some indecision Mazarin divided the office be- tween these two. Fouquet retained the post of NICOLAS FOUQUET 69 Fouquet 7 1 procureur general and received as well the title of Minister of State. At this hour the finances of the country were greatly embarrassed. Money was necessary to carry on war and to support large armies ; the coffers had been depleted by five lean years and the greed of courtiers and officials. Before long it became evident that the two superintendents were not working well together. During Servien's absence Fouquet took the opportunity of regulating the finances according to the desires of the Cardinal, in whose favour he now stood higher than before. Mazarin required money for the country, but he did not forget the needs of his own family, and brought pressure to bear upon the Superintendent to aid him in obtaining ample supplies for personal expenditure as well as in liquidating his gambling debts. Fouquet remonstrated with his protector occasionally when the demands became too exacting, but he did not allow his own pocket to suffer whilst filling that of Mazarin. Rapidly the Superintendent built the fortunes of his family. He had received a large dowry with his first wife, Marie Fourche, who died leaving him an only daughter. He obtained an even larger sum with his second wife, Marie-Madeleine de Castille Villemareuil, La Fontaine's adorable Sylvie. On this basis he amassed enormous riches and acquired beauti- ful estates. He had almost as many homes as the King himself, and one was a chateau so beautiful that Louis XIV. felt he had nothing to equal it, and, in • 5 72 Jean de la Fontaine his desire to possess something more superb still, begot Versailles. Fouquet, like all those who know i\\o limit to ambition, was not without deadly enemies, and for a long time he planned to purchase and fortify an estate to which he might retire in case danger threatened him. He was now the owner of Saint-Mande, a comparatively modern mansion where homely comfort reigned supreme ; he acquired Belle-Isle, the fortified port which was to be his refuge, and from which he took a title ; and he constructed Vaux, a proud palace, worthy of Francois I., to the perfection of which the greatest artists in France had contributed. Leveau was the architect. Usually he was cold and austere in style.1 Fouquet, however, had negatived the frontage of stone and brick which was then in fashion, and gave to Vaux a more ornate exterior. Le Notre designed the gardens. Le Brun had charge of the decorations; and though many artists executed work under his orders, unity was the result. In the three years he spent at Vaux he painted many mythological and allegorical subjects. \" Venus cutting Cupid's wings \" adorned Mme de Fouquet's apartment. The ceiling of the room set aside for the King was beautified by representations of Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Bacchus, symbols of power, vigilance, abundance, and valour. In most of the ornamental designs the squirrel 1 The Church of Saint-Louis-en-1'Ile and the famous Hotel Lambert were designed by him. Fouquet 73 of Fouquet's arms appeared with his famous device, Quo non ascendit ? His initials, interlaced with those of his wife, were introduced wherever possible, in the fashion made popular by Henri II. and Diane de Poitiers at Fontainebleau. The finished building, with its imposing and elegant frontage, its spacious courts, its vast halls and salons, was worthy of the master mind that had conceived it. It lay surrounded by parterres, canals, grottos, lawns, and plantations, melting in the distance into woodland landscape. Its grandeur inspired Mile de Scudery to devote page after page to it in her voluminous romance \" Clelie,\" under the name of Valterre. x Le Brun's paintings awakened in her the utmost admiration. Inside the palace was \" the goodliest hall that ever existed. Its greatness astonishes the imagi- nation, its height surprises, and its beauty is so great that it takes away the boldness to commend it. . . . 1 \" The front of the palace,\" she wrote, \" is built upon a mountain of architecture. ... It hath four great pavilions at the four corners, with other courts on the two sides. The two faces which stand upon the stately moats of Valterre end in three great arcades of architecture, through which are discovered two large low wings of buildings which have been built for offices to the house, and two gardens which lie on the side of those two wings. . . . There is nothing more stately and magnificent than to see those handsome moats full of water, the second court the balustrades, the spurting fountains, and that gieat and magnificent perroon which crosses the whole court, rising so majestic- ally, and upon which is seen in the middle of the palace a great porch of three stately arches supported by six pillars, which suffer the sight to penetrate through the whole thickness of the palace by three other arches opposite to the first three, and three other likewise opposite to the second ; so that the sky appearing at several overtures, this sight is the more agreeable.'' 74 Jean de la Fontaine The sun is represented there in his palace with all the ornaments poets attribute him ; the whole base of the piece is encompassed with a great serpent representing the year ; upon this serpent move the months, the weeks and the days ; \" and wonderful symbols sur- rounded the whole, the moon appearing through the shadow of a cloud, Venus followed by sports and laughter, Cupid, the seasons, goddesses — every imagin- able symbol worked into a significant design. \" But now to expound to you the hidden meaning of all these pictures,\" she continued. \"I am to tell you that the sun represents Cleomine [Fouquet], who, according to the amplitude of his great employments, operates and shines everywhere, does good to all, and labours continually for the benefit and embellishing of the universe.\" Such was the position of the man who gave to La Fontaine his first real opening in life, and such was the luxurious milieu into which he drew him. In these surroundings it was not surprising that appropriate company should be selected to grace them. No one was invited who had not special qualities. The central figure was Fouquet himself, great, distinguished, z power in the land whose friends were legion. In the midst of the cares of politics he patronised letters and the arts. He collected round him doctors, savants, and poets, all men who could minister to his own versatile tastes — for he was diplomatist, financier, magistrate, student, scientist, pleasure-seeker, and a lover of beauty Fouquet 75 in one. The greatest authors in France received of his hospitality and bounty. Corneille, who had temporarily withdrawn from dramatic work, was urged by him to continue writing for the stage after a break of some ten years* Scarron had dedicated a comedy to the great financier in 1655, in which he addressed himself humbly to his generous, his adorable master. The last days of the cul-de-jatte who was then on the point of uttering his final witty sally were sweetened by Fouquet's pension and additional gifts of dainty fare dearly beloved by the recipient. Boisrobert, author of *' Epitres en Vers,\" Gombauld, guest of the salon bleu, and author of \"Cleomedes et Sophonisbe,\" who dedicated his \" Danaides \" to Fouquet, Hesnault, and Loret were encouraged by material help to give their best work to the world. Thomas Corneille was on the pension list also. Moliere and Quinault were especial favourites. But the moving spirits of the day, who gave forth a seemingly inexhaustible flow of madrigals, chansons, enigmas, and bouts rimes — all of them fashionable excuses for versifying — formed a little coterie headed by Mile de Scudery and Pellisson, and well supported by Mme la Marquise du Plessis-Belliere and Mme Cornuel. The Marquise was a very typical figure of the elect society which was in vogue after the Fronde. At her house the residue and extremists of the H6tel de Rambouillet assembled. And as she was as 7 6 Jean de la Fontaine often in Fouquet's house as in her own, she carried her friends and the prkieux atmosphere with her. Although she was no longer young, her name did not escape the slur which friendship with the Superintendent had cast upon those of many other women. \" She represented friendship there, not love,\" wrote one of her defenders. She was a woman of intelligence of whom Fouquet made a confidante. Mme Fouquet showed her affection and she stood godmother to one of the children. Gossip might have passed her by were it not for the fact that her daughter Catherine received a dot of two hundred thousand livres from Fouquet on the eve of her marriage. And when the crash came she had the honour of being treated like the nearest and dearest of his household, who were exiled in various directions. Mile de Scudery, too, having won the interest of all the women by her \" Cyrus \" (for they desired to have their portraits written), gave in \" Clelie \" a token of her gratitude to Fouquet. Was she not Pellisson's cherished friend ? To welcome him was to welcome her, and she received from the Superintendent material benefits which were well enough paid by the fulsome flatteries and verbose eulogies of her romance. Pellisson, who became Fouquet's confidential secretary and man of affairs, was also his literary taster. He knew all the men of letters, and had frequented all the Salons. He was Mile de Scudery's particular friend, and for many years the mainstay of her Saturdays. Born at Castres in 1624, he was three years younger Fouquet 77 than La Fontaine. It was doubtless through him that Brebeuf, translator of\" Pharsalia,\" and the other authors already mentioned, obtained the patronage of the Superintendent, and upon him devolved the duty of meting out gifts and pensions. He probably had a share in bringing La Fontaine to the great man's notice, for he had known him well in the little circle of which Tallemant and the Maucroix brothers were intimates, but this honour has always been accorded to Jannart, who, because he was deputy to the pro- cureur geniral, had plenty of opportunities of making his niece's husband known to his chief. In any case the person who was instrumental in bringing about the meeting was unimportant in com- parison with the significance of his deed. Fouquet, the strong-willed, masterful Minister, surrounded by a crowd of sycophants, was now face to face with the budding poet, who, although full five-and-thirty years of age, was still a beginner in his art, and a dozen years younger than his patron. He looked his age. Prolific black locks framed a face that was delicate in feature, but clever and smiling. The long aquiline nose, thin upper lip above a full lower one, wide-set eyes which sparkled now with a gleam of wit, again were veiled and slumbrous, made up a distinguished physiognomy which was emphasised by the ease of his carriage and the elegance of his costume. Awaken La Fontaine's attention and he could be everything — courtier, man of the world, conversationalist, fine 7 8 Jean de la Fontaine gentleman. Examine him in one of his abstracted moods which occurred frequently and he seemed more like a countrified boor, careless of manner, wanting in savoir /aire, anything but good company, and not too pleased to be disturbed in his poetic dreams. These extremes were the outcome of his genius, and those who were his friends understood and respected them, loving him equally in both. The excitement of leaving the country for Paris, the importance of his reception by Fouquet, had put the dreamy poet temporarily on his mettle. He offered his \" Adonis\" — cold, artificial, monotonous as it is in parts — as a true lover offers his hand and heart to his lady fair. There was a fashion in writing at that date which had to be carefully adhered to if the author intended to please. \" Adonis \" contained the amorous tone and dealt with the psychology of love, which rendered it suitable to the prevailing taste. It was French enough and up-to-date enough, and yet was scented with a perfume culled from the floral treasures of the classics. The dedication extolled the man to whom it was offered : \" Fouquet, l'unique but des faveurs d'Uranie, Digne objet de mes chants, vaste et noble genie.\" With so many attributes in its favour the poem, although never regarded as a masterpiece, was sure to please, and did in fact earn for its author a pension of a thousand livres per annum, in return for which Fouquet 79 La Fontaine was to pay in quarterly instalments of verse. In lines addressed to Pellisson he agreed to the bargain, and it must be laid to his credit that to the best of his ability he sincerely and scrupulously endeavoured to execute his share of it. Fouquet was not wholly a philanthropist where his poets and dramatists were concerned. He wanted them to add to his grandeur. What was the use of possessing estates and palaces if their richness and beauty were not made known to the world ? He intended to make them immortal in verse. Since the year 1 640 he had conceived the idea of building himself the dwelling-place that should astonish all France. His workmen began in 1653, and it was 1657 before his plans had taken partial shape at last in solid stone and rich marble. They were not complete in 1661 when circumstances made it necessary for building to cease. But at least the edifice existed for every eye to behold, and it was time to publish the fact in the accustomed manner. Fouquet turned over in his mind the poets who were capable of fulfilling his desire, and his choice fell upon the one who had pictured the woodland scenes in \" Adonis.\" No one was more fitted, he believed, to sing of the shadowed alleys, the gay parterres, the handsome outlines of the Chateau of Vaux. La Fontaine accepted the task willingly enough. His contract was already signed in January 1659, and he had promised to produce verses on fixed dates ; 80 Jean de la Fontaine madrigals at midsummer, odes in October, ballads at the new year, and devout sonnets at Easter. In the meantime he laboured at the great work which was to glorify Vaux. His own remarks on its composition are of interest. Some of the descriptive fragments were begun long years before they were printed, and many were interrupted and were never completed. He asserted in a letter to his wife that he knew nothing of architecture, and that the architects, designers, painters, sculptors, and gardeners had to give him notes of their respective work in order that he might have a basis of knowledge upon which to raise his superstructure of imagery. \" The gardens of Vaux were newly planted,\" he wrote, enumerating some of the difficulties which lay in his path ; \" so that I could not describe them in that state, since the idea of them would not have been at all agreeable, and at the close of twenty years probably not in the least like them"
