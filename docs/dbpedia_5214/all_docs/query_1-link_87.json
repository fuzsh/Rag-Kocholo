As editor of Ptolemy’s Geography (Lyon, 1535), Servetus added in the commentary on a contemporary (i.e. non-Ptolemaic) map of the Holy Land: Nevertheless be assured, reader, that it is sheer misinterpretation to attribute such excellence to this land which the experience of merchants and travelers proves to be barren, sterile and without charm, so that you may call it in the vernacular “the promised land” only in the sense that it was promised, not that it had any promise.1\n\nThis paragraph, which Servetus in fact took almost verbatim from earlier editors of Ptolemy, was brought as evidence against him in the notorious trial that ended with a public burning (October 27, 1553). Servetus’ explanation that these were not his own words, and that the comment was made regarding the contemporary, not the biblical Holy Land, did not convince Calvin and the court. Although the accusation was dropped from the final sentence, which drew ample material from Servetus’ heretical views on the Trinity and baptism, the Ptolemy\n\n1 “Scias tamen lector optime, iniuria aut iactantia pura, tantam huic terrae bonitatem fuisse adscriptam, eo que ipsa experientia, mercatorum & peraegre profiscentium, hanc incultam, sterilem, omni dulcedine carentem depromit.

Geographia sacra, the subject of this study, stood at the heart of this complex process. Sacred geography is a burning topic in our academic culture, too. Recent scholarship across a wide array of disciplines has rediscovered space, place, and territoriality as fundamental analytical categories in the human sciences. Space is no longer conceived as a neutral continuum of human action and has now become an uneven, value-laden human construct. In the wake of this now vast movement, often referred to as ‘the spatial turn,’ religion and sacred geography have returned to the center of discussion as a crucial mode of perceiving and enacting space. Whereas the process of disenchantment and secularization of space was one of the founding myths of the Enlightenment and modernity (and sometimes bought wholesale by Enlightenment’s critics), interest in the crossings of space and religion is now on the rise.3 Sacred geography, or sacred space, normally refers in current usage to the conscious physical molding of the environment for religious purposes (as in shrine architecture and in ritual setting).4 Even more commonly, especially in anthropological studies, sacred geography denotes a representation of space, or a mentality, that is distinguished from a secular view of the world. In this sense, famously defined by Mircea Eliade, sacred geography is built on a set of symbols and\n\n2 See also George H.

Religion thus serves as a model for new or revived understandings of human spatiality. It is this basic recognition which I take with me into the early modern period and into the archaeology of this fruitful and complex notion—sacred geography. For despite its (still) fashionable overtones, the concept has a long history, and a particularly rich one in the early modern period. Geographia sacra—a term coined in the early modern period—was not only a technical expression, but also a rich scholarly genre, which captivated the intellects of many central figures of the European Republic of Letters. It was wholly embedded in a broader learned culture that took a spatial turn long before we did. Increasing numbers of scholars explore various early modern notions of space and geographical ideas, and elucidate the ways in which they are related to major process, such as the rise of territorial states, global trade, the colonization of the New World and the rise of empires. This book attempts to contribute to our understanding of the spatial history and spatial imaginary of early modern Europe by highlighting sacred geography, which was, I argue, a significant contemporary mode of thinking about space, land, history, and their role in a world where the divine had a powerful and immediate presence. I trace, in other words, a vast spatial turn in Christian scholarship that took place during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At its most basic level, geographia sacra dealt with reconstructing the biblical landscape and often with translating the sacred text into a map. The geographical elaboration of the biblical text was not a new exercise in the Jewish and Christian tradition. In the early fourth century, Eusebius of Caesarea defined the main features of sacred geography in the preface to his Onomasticon, addressed to the Bishop of Tyre, Paulinus: First I shall transliterate into Greek the names for the people of the world which appear in Hebrew in Holy Scripture. Then, I shall make a map of ancient Judaea from the whole book, dividing the allotted territories of the twelve tribes. In addition, I shall trace the representation of their ancient, famous, mother-city, I mean of course Jerusalem, including in this the plan of the Temple, after comparison with the existing remains of the sites. I shall assemble things in line with this, and in accordance with those matters you have suggested already in your proposal for the improvement of the whole subject. I shall set out the cities and villages contained in Holy Scripture in the ancestral tongue, designating what sort of places they are, and how we name them, whether similarly to the\n\n4\n\nchapter one ancients or differently. So, from the whole divinely-inspired Scripture, I shall collect the names that are sought, and set each one down in alphabetical order, for easy retrieval of names when they happen to occur here and there in the readings.5\n\nFrom late antiquity until today, despite improving cartographic techniques and clearer representational conventions, this technical pursuit as first outlined by Eusebius has been marked by strong continuities. Collecting and representing, both visually and textually, the geographical material in the Bible—the dispersion of peoples in Genesis; the distribution of Canaan among the tribes of Israel in Joshua; the description of Jerusalem and the temple in 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles and Ezekiel; and place-names throughout the Canon—has been and still is the sacred geographer’s job.6 This continuity is easily explained by the essential role played by the canonical text as the primary source of information. Yet behind the façade of smooth, centuries-old continuities and the seemingly straightforward practice of pinning placenames down on a map, many complexities and fractures lie concealed. Sacred geography is not a simple translation of text into tabular or visual form, for by the very act of translation it becomes interpretative and exegetical. Maps, diagrams, and lists relating to sacred geography often appeared in biblical commentaries rather than in the Bible itself, and were not intended as mere illustrations.7 In that sense, the history\n\n5\n\nPalestine in the Fourth Century A.D.: The Onomasticon by Eusebius of Caesarea, ed.

It is based on Klostermann’s critical edition (Leipzig, 1904) of Eusebius’ Greek text and Jerome’s (free) Latin translation.

The early modern period is uniquely rich for exploring contesting notions of geographia sacra, for it is a time during which the understanding of both geography and the Bible were profoundly shaken. With the revival of ancient geography, exploration of the New World, and the emergence of print culture, there occurred in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a veritable revolution in geographical thinking, as well as in map dissemination and use.8 The introduction of humanistic methods in biblical exegesis and the Reformation’s emphasis on Scripture as the foundation of religion made biblical scholarship a territory disputed as never before, while the Bible became available to more and more lay people in vernacular languages.9 Both geography and sacred scholarship experienced a period of tumultuous efflorescence. As the ecclesiastical geographer Augustin Lubin wrote in 1678, those who read a map enter a foreign country, where they encounter unknown words and symbols.10 Similarly, entering the scholarly gray area stretching between ‘religion’ and ‘geography’ requires us to open our minds to fluid terminology, blurred disciplinary boundaries, and conjunctions which on our map of knowledge may seem awkward. In\n\n8 See Robert W. Karrow, Jr., “Intellectual Foundations of the Cartographic Revolution” (Ph.D., Loyola University, 1999), preface, for a convincing justification of the term.

This crossover is required, first, by the nature of early modern geography itself, which was as much a textual and humanistic as a scientific and empirical discipline (if not more so), and as such a close ally of history and philology. This attentiveness to the period’s own categories is more often than not absent from modern histories of geography. Hence, early modern geographia sacra, as sketched out by Eusebius, functioned in this broader context, and for this reason its scope, aims and sources are hard to define. In a recent overview of religious mapping in the medieval and early modern period, the eminent historian of cartography, Catherine Delano Smith argues that sacred geography is more exclusive than biblical geography. Sacred geography sensu stricto is concerned with places deemed ‘holy’ in the relevant religion. Confusingly, however, the word ‘sacred’ has often been misused as a synonym for biblical geography, especially by eighteenthand nineteenth-century mapmakers, publishers, and writers on the Holy Land.11\n\nYet this attempt at limitation and delimitation, while useful for today’s geographers, seems to be too rigorous for the early modern period, when sacred geography had an even wider, more flexible usage, and when both terms, ‘sacred’ and ‘geography,’ were applied in a variety of senses. Geographia sacra often meant biblical geography, in the sense that the Bible was its source of information, and that it described the landscapes where biblical events took place. But sacred geography was not limited to the Bible as a sole source—many pagan authors were instrumental in the reconstruction of biblical lands; nor was it limited to a representation of the eastern Mediterranean—scholars such as Benito Arias Montano and Samuel Bochart wrote a global sacred geography. Finally, geographia sacra in early modern usage encompassed ecclesiastical geography as well. Hence any region at any period could have its own sacred geography, relating to ecclesiastical provinces, mission activities, or pilgrimages. Given this diversity, rather 11 Catherine Delano Smith, “Maps and Religion in Medieval and Early Modern Europe,” in Plantejaments i objectius d’una història universal de la cartografia = Approaches and Challenges in a Worldwide History of Cartography, ed. David Woodward, Catherine Delano Smith, and Cordell D. K. Yee, 179–200 (Barcelona: Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya, 2001), 191.\n\nearly modern geographia sacra\n\n7\n\nthan beginning with a definition of geographia sacra in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, I would like this definition—the contour lines of geographia sacra on the map of early modern scholarship—to emerge as the end product of this study. Those who today we identify as (a term I usually try to avoid) ‘fathers’ of modern geography devoted considerable energy to geographia sacra, and were profoundly religious men—Gerard Mercator, Abraham Ortelius, and many others.12 Moreover, many of those who in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries studied and published geographical works were not geographers per se. An early modern ‘geographer’ may well have been primarily active as a diplomat, artist, printer, natural scientist, linguist, and theologian. We find quite a few churchmen and theologians on Ortelius’ Catalogus auctorum, the list of contributors to his celebrated atlas, the Theatrum Orbis terrarum (1570): the reformer Johann Honter (1498–1549), the “Apostle of Transylvania,” was the author of an extremely popular verse treatise on cosmography; Jacob Ziegler (1480–1549), creator of an influential map of Palestine, was an Erasmian whose theological works were put on the Index. The most conspicuous example is perhaps that of the theologian and Hebraist Sebastian Münster (1489–1552), an editor of Ptolemy’s Geography and author of a famous Cosmography.13 The phenomenon continues through the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with figures such as Kaspar Peucer (1525–1602), Melanchthon’s son-in-law, the Arminian-turned-Catholic Petrus Bertius (1565–1629), an editor of Ptolemy and an author of many theological works, the Anglican divines Samuel Purchas (c. 1577–1626), Thomas Fuller (1608–61), and Peter Heylyn (1600–1662), to early eighteenth century scholars such as the prominent Orientalist Adriaan Reelant (1676–1718). Another point of contact between religion and geography was institutional. The Church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was the\n\n12 Mercator, for example, in his celebrated map of Europe (1544, 1572) included three textual cartouches on the peregrinations of Jesus, St. Peter, and St. Paul.

In Italy, almost all the significant figures in the recovery of Ptolemy’s Geography and other classical authors were either clerics or scholars who worked under Church patronage. Beyond patronage, the revival of classical geography provided a paradigm of universalism to Catholics in an expanding world.14 The universalizing potential was clearly perceived by churchmen and missionaries, already in the fifteenth century and then by the great ‘geographical corporation,’ the Society of Jesus.15 Thus early modern secular geography at large was ‘sacred’ in the sense that it was mentally conceived and materially produced within a religious framework, both personal and institutional.16 Through these wider developments, the very traditional field of sacred geography made an immense step forward in terms of accuracy and sophistication, benefiting from new methods in geographical as well as biblical scholarship. It had become common understanding among students of Scripture that correct reading must be based on correct geography (as well as botany, zoology, and mineralogy). Erasmus warmly recommended the use of maps and cosmographies for the study and animation of Scripture. He ridiculed those who, shamelessly prognosticating or consulting terrible dictionaries, turned towns to fruits, gems to fish, and stars to birds. After all, as Erasmus said following St. Augustine, the mystical sense of Scripture often depended on the unique qualities of such things. As Kristine Haugen phrased it, Erasmus aspired to create a “multidimensional picture of the world in which Jesus and the Apostles lived.”17\n\n14 John Larner, “The Church and the Quattrocento Renaissance in Geography,” Renaissance Studies 12, no. 1 (1998): 26–39.

Catholic and Protestant scholars alike strove to perfect the array of study aids—linguistic, historical, and geographical—available for the correct reading of Scripture that they promoted. Joachim von Watt (Vadianus, also an editor of Pomponius Mela), Jakob Ziegler, Robert Estienne, Jacques Bonfrère, and Benito Arias Montano, to name but a few, used philological, historical, and antiquarian tools to survey the landscapes of the Old and New Testaments.18 Comprehensive place-name indices, maps, and textual geographical accounts enriched major Bible editions, and were designed to familiarize the reader with the lay of the land.19 Moreover, particular questions in sacred geography—such as the itineraries of the Patriarchs and the Apostles, the exact location of the Terrestrial Paradise and that of Ophir (the source of Solomon’s gold)—began to receive sustained scholarly attention.20\n\nad quas scribunt Apostoli, non situm modo, verumetiam originem, mores, instituta, cultum, ingenium, ex historicorum literis didicerimus: dictu mirum, quantum lucis, et ut ita dicam, vitae sit accessurum lectioni, quae prorsus oscitabunda mortuaque sit oportet, quoties non haec tantum, sed & omnium pene rerum ignorantur vocabula. adeo ut nonnunque vel impudenter addiuinantes, vel sordidissimos consulentes dictionarios, ex arbore faciant quadrupedem, e gemma piscem, e citharoedo fluvium, ex oppido fruticem, e sydere avem, ex brassica braccam.

Kasper Peucer, who in 1554 became professor of mathematics in Wittenberg, published in the same year a manual for measuring distances on the surface of the globe. This skill was necessary to any student of history, explained Peucer, but particularly to believers, who wished to understand the locations of the series of divine revelations of God to his Church; who wished to grasp God’s wisdom in placing that Church in a corner of Syria, in the center of the habitable world, so that the propagation of the faith might be quicker; to those who wished to know where Christ first preached, where he performed miracles, and where he died.21 “In such important matters, failure to consider the location of regions and distances between them is not only a rude barbarism, but irreverence,” Peucer thundered.22 The apt companion which Peucer added to his mathematical manual was a description of the Holy Land by Burchard of Mt.

Studying sacred geography, as Erasmus noted, was part of inquiring into the origins of peoples, their customs, laws, and ritual. Following Vadianus’ and Erasmus’ call, scholars approached the Bible equipped with an expanded corpus of Oriental languages and texts, in an effort to reconstruct the life of past societies in its full spectrum, especially that of the Hebrews in the Holy Land in the time of Christ, and of early Christian communities. This exercise in reconstruction, to apply Arnaldo Momigliano’s famous formulation of 1950, was antiquarian par excellence. In other words, we see here the emergence of sacred antiquarianism, which sprang from traditional exegesis and Christian Hebraism on the one hand, and from the bourgeoning fascination with classical antiquities on the other.25 Momigliano was clear that antiquarianism dealt with the sacred as well as the secular past. One of the main contentions of my study is that sacred geography, both in content and in method, was a central element in this documentary and scholarly effort to recover the past.26 In my view, the study of antiquarianism pioneered by Momigliano and extended by Miller and others should include the world of cartography and geography. Often, the organizing principle of antiquarian works, both secular and sacred, has been spatial-geographical rather than thematic or temporal, as in Leandro Alberti’s influential description of Italy (1550). The itinerary was both a well developed\n\n24 William Cuningham, The Cosmographical Glasse Conteinyng the Pleasant Principles of Cosmographie, Geographie, Hydrographie, or Nauigation (London: In officina Ioan.

The scholarly map, it could be argued, enabled a primary mode of antiquarian expression in early modern Europe. It allowed juxtaposing textual and material evidence, and reducing information into tabular form.27 The map was an apt means to place material before one’s eyes or present it to memory, to use common expressions at the time. It displayed detailed, synchronic knowledge about the past; it allowed measured, visual documentation; and it was an antiquarian object in itself—collected, displayed in curiosity cabinets, reproduced, and exchanged. From its earliest manifestations, like Buondelmonti’s early fifteenth-century treatise on the Aegean, the new scholarly interest in antiquities was closely tied to cartography. Figures like Leon Battista Alberti, Angelo Colocci, and later Pirro Ligorio pursued both channels thoroughly, and the list continues to unroll through the names of Konrad Peutinger, Robert Cotton, William Camden, and of course Ortelius.28 Similarly, a map of the Holy Land, a view of Jerusalem, a plan of the Temple and the tomb of Christ, although subjects long central to the Christian tradition, were now antiquarian productions, which were born into an antiquarian milieu. Throughout this study these conceptual as well as social and biographical links between sacred geography and antiquarian practices will continually emerge. Beyond sacred geography, this is a phenomenon that has significance for the understanding of early modern geography as a whole. It awaits further study and elaboration. A related term, ‘devout curiosity,’ will appear several times as well throughout this study. Sacred or devout curiosity, a term coined most probably in the late fifteenth century, is perhaps the most important for understanding the traditions that merged in the workshop of the sacred geographer. This was what the sacred antiquarian practiced when he worked his way through the Talmud to learn about ancient Hebrew measures, when he commissioned a map of a diocese under his care, or when he carefully measured the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Whereas the quantification and geometrization of space 27 Ann Blair, The Theater of Nature: Jean Bodin and Renaissance Science (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1997), 175. 28 On Ortelius as antiquary see recently Tine L. Meganck, “Erudite Eyes: Artists and Antiquarians in the Circle of Abraham Ortelius” (Ph.D., Princeton University, 2003).

Measurement and accuracy where happily adopted as pious modes of dealing with the sacred, in text and image, because they were not seen by contemporaries as emptying the world of its moral and qualitative properties. Curiosity becomes a devout act in itself. It is employed not in the traditional, pejorative sense of reaching beyond human and moral bounds, but in the evolving contemporary, positive one: examining curious evidence thoroughly, carefully, and patiently—just as Samuel Bochart and Isaac de La Peyrère did when they inspected a whale’s tooth in the curiosity cabinet of Ole Worm.29 Sacred geography thus participated in the emerging culture of curiosity and science in early modern Europe.30 Moreover, the centrality of the notion of devout curiosity in the practice of sacred geography makes its story part of the general phenomenon of pious science in early modern Europe. Antiquarian projects were never detached from present ideas and concerns, and sacred geography was no exception. Devout curiosity meant not only the careful study of biblical and ecclesiastical antiquity, but also mobilizing this study for contemporary devout purposes. The unique mix of devotion and erudition that Simon Ditchfield found in Roman learned circles, pervades the genre of sacred geography.31 Many of the works which this study examines operate on these two levels, with liturgical or polemical goals in mind. Arias Montano (Chapter Two), once he established the historical sense of Scripture, used his meticulous antiquarian images as meditative objects. Franciscan surveys of Jerusalem (Chapter Three) were crafted to defend the authenticity of the holy sites and rejuvenate the traditions attached to them. Protestant legal-historical inquiries about the territory under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome in the fourth century aimed to weaken the papacy’s modern claims to supremacy—the map gallery in the Vatican palace aimed to strengthen it (Chapter Five).\n\n29 As related by Pierre-Daniel Huet in his memoire.

Swanson, Studies in Church History; 33, 343–60 (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell Press for The Ecclesiastical History Society, 1997).\n\n14\n\nchapter one\n\nThus the confessional battle over sacred geography took place on common antiquarian ground. It is, therefore, impossible to generalize, as some modern interpreters do, about a supposedly necessary connection between sacred geography and literal minded Protestantism.32 Protestants were not so averse to the allegorical or even mystical sense of Scripture, just as Catholics were deeply involved with the historical. More importantly, maps in this period have found uses beyond the strictly geographical. While sacred geography was clearly a subject dear to both camps, and therefore a controversial one, it is hard to reconstruct a neat front line of debate. Biblical geography gripped both Catholic and Protestant scholars, who, to some extent, especially in the seventeenth century, respected and utilized each other’s work.33 Pilgrimage to European shrines was fiercely criticized by Reformers, but their views on the voyage to Jerusalem were ambiguous, and many Protestants simply made the pilgrimage, whatever the official line may have been. Ecclesiastical geography presents the only clear case where Catholic geographers dominated the field and Protestants could produce mostly ‘negative’ geographies. The question of Protestant ecclesiastical geography, however, is still open for further study and debate. This book makes considerable use of maps and some other illustrative material as sources for intellectual history, drawing on the recent awakening of the history of cartography. If previous traditions of scholarship contented themselves with documenting the growing accuracy of maps, or with fine carto-bibliographical inquiry, research in the history of cartography at least since the early 1990’s seeks to interpret maps as objects which operate within specific intellectual and political environments, and thus partake of broader historical contexts. So far,\n\n32 Frank Lestringant, Introduction to André Thevet, Cosmographie de Levant (Geneva: Droz, 1985), lxi–lxiv. 33 As we will see in Chapter Four, Bochart’s Geographia sacra won praise from Protestants and Catholics alike. Similarly, the Jesuit Jacques Bonfrère’s work on Holy Land geography was included in the apparatus of Brian Walton’s London Polyglot. The Anglican Henry Spelman warmly recommended Arias Montano’s and the Geneva Bible’s reconstruction of the Temple, as opposed to that of Adrichem: “See the forme of the Temple in Arias Montan: Antiquitat. Iudaic. lib. Ariel. and in the Geneva Bible I King. cap. 6. and marke well both it, and the notes vpon it; for I find them (above others) most agreeable to the Scriptures, and rely not vpon the figure of the Temple in Adricomius, without good examination; for I perceiue he hath misplaced somethings therein.” De non temerandis ecclesiis, A Tract of the Rights and Respect Due vnto Churches, 2 ed. (London: Iohn Beale, 1616), 74 note b.\n\nearly modern geographia sacra\n\n15\n\nthe scholars practicing the new history of cartography have mainly explored the political, literary, and artistic aspects of early modern mapping, with exciting results.34 The religious aspect of early modern cartography, however, still lags behind. For example, while maps of the Holy Land, are comprehensively catalogued, analyzed, and grouped according to formal and visual criteria, their broader cultural and intellectual contexts have only rarely been explored.35 The situation has changed as regards medieval cartography, especially mappae mundi, which have been studied and carefully placed in exegetical and literary traditions.36 In the early modern period, however, there is still a lot to be desired. In a recent overview of the field, Pauline Moffitt Watts observes that “there has been no comprehensive study of the relationship of cartography to the Protestant and Catholic reform movements of early modern Europe”.37 The recent works of Margriet Hoogvliet on world maps and of Alessandro Scafi on the mapping of Paradise present important steps towards a fuller understanding of the ways in which maps operated within changing religious cultural and intellectual spheres.38 One of the clear marks of this new scholarship is the full recognition that geography and cartography were to a large degree humanistic, text-oriented disciplines that took part in a wider world of early modern scholarship. Like most other branches of knowledge at the time, they were in continual negotiation with a 34 See for example, David Buisseret, ed., Monarchs, Ministers, and Maps: The Emergence of Cartography as a Tool of Government in Early Modern Europe (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992); Josef W.

I employ this approach when I study maps within the context of religion and scholarship. Jointly analyzing textual and visual sources, I stress both the obvious yet rarely practiced—that reading the texts which accompany a map is crucial—and the less obvious—that the specific intellectual arena into which a map is born should bear upon its interpretation. Moreover, if earlier critics, like J. B. Harley, who established “the power of maps” paradigm and thus redefined the history of cartography, looked at ‘mapping’ as a unified corpus with a clear agenda (power and rule), later map historians have gradually realized that individual maps, just like books, have specific arguments, and that dialogues and debates run through as well as between them.39 It will be noted throughout the following discussions that early modern scholars attentively designed their maps in order to promote particular views in response to other texts and maps. In recent scholarship there has been a real surge, sometimes called a ‘visual turn’, in the study of early modern visual culture.40 In the history of science in particular, images, diagrams, and sketches have assumed center stage in discussions on the production and presentation of knowledge, and on cultures of description.41 Somewhat paradoxically, the new history of cartography has taken a linguistic turn in order to turn maps into more meaningful historical documents. However, for my purposes, the two turns meet mid-way. I adopt the principle that images and maps are never simple descriptions of a natural or geographical reality, but are always mediated and shaped by convention and dialog.

Some of them even developed a critical discourse about their use (or their opponents’ perceived misuse) of maps. On the whole, this book’s various chapters demonstrate the increasing and yet complex role played by visualization in early modern European scholarship. It is here that I see this study joining and contributing to current literature on past visual cultures. I have often been asked the very sensible question whether my studies in map history focused on any particular area. Regardless of the variety of evasive answers I have given in the past, I came to realize that indeed it was hard to pin down this project to any particular region. It mentions locations from Ceylon to Peru and from Cairo to Stockholm. It is certainly not tied to the Holy Land. My protagonists lived and acted in widely if not wildly different religious and political local contexts. The particular region I do cover, it would seem, is one province of the European Republic of Letters, that by-definition landless entity. Thus this study is at the same time very broad, hopping from one country and period to another, and very specific, in trying to explore one early modern scholarly genre. A survey of the whole field would have amounted to a frustrating list of authors and titles. I have chosen to avoid that and therefore many significant contributors to geographia sacra are either mentioned in passing or simply neglected. Instead, the book offers case studies, which explore in great detail central scholars and themes of sacred geography in the early modern period, while progressing chronologically from about 1540 to 1690. Together the chapters cover the essential issues which preoccupied sacred geographers at the period, and allow a view of the field from different scholarly perspectives.\n\n42 As, for example, Sachiko Kusukawa amply demonstrated in the case of botanical illustrations: “Leonhart Fuchs on the Importance of Pictures,” Journal of the History of Ideas 58, no. 3 (1997): 403–27. See also Georgia Frank, The Memory of the Eyes: Pilgrims to Living Saints in Christian Late Antiquity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000); Peter Burke, “Images as Evidence in Seventeenth-Century Europe,” Journal of the History of Ideas 64, no. 2 (2003): 273–96.\n\n18\n\nchapter one\n\nThe following chapter examines the biblical maps of the Spanish theologian Benito Arias Montano, editor of the second great Polyglot Bible (Antwerp, 1569–72). Montano, who, so far as I can establish, was the first to use the term geographia sacra, was one of the earliest scholars to have fully realized Eusebius’ blueprint, and thus merits a closer look. Montano authored geographical texts, maps, and architectural designs, which he joined together in the Polyglot’s massive Apparatus. An examination of the Apparatus demonstrates that Montano’s scholarship combined his philological training in Oriental languages and exegesis with a profound antiquarian interest in tabulating and visualizing monuments of the past. A close look at Montano’s Latin texts and at his broader social and intellectual contacts underlines the importance of the antiquarian movement as a major factor in his biblical scholarship, and stresses the centrality of geography and maps in Montano’s religious thought. Geographia sacra, which for Montano encompassed the whole Earth, allowed him to demonstrate the relevance of Scripture to a modern overseas Spanish empire, and to argue enthusiastically for the potential of the text’s mysteries to yield more knowledge in the future. Sacred geography as an antiquarian practice manifested itself most clearly on-site, that is, in Jerusalem itself. The third chapter focuses on learned travel and pilgrimage, or, on what became of Eusebius’ remark that he would offer a representation of Jerusalem and the Temple “after comparison with the existing remains of the sites.”43 Current scholarship is almost united in the view that pilgrimage to Jerusalem died out after 1500. Yet the burgeoning publication of pilgrim accounts during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries calls for a reconsideration. It is shown here, first, that many took the route to the Holy Sepulcher, and second, that devotion to the sacred sites, even if it took a different form than its medieval predecessor, was lively and generated great interest at home in Europe, in both the Catholic and the Protestant worlds. The well-established tradition of pilgrimage was transformed by the growing practice of learned travel in search of curious items and phenomena, and the general scientific and descriptive culture of the time. Franciscan authors, who usually stayed for long periods in the Holy Land, effectively controlled information about the sacred sites, and were engaged in an extensive project of visual and textual\n\n43\n\nEusebius, Onomasticon, 11.\n\nearly modern geographia sacra\n\n19\n\ndocumentation of monuments and traditions. This activity was concurrent with similar efforts in Rome, especially in its catacombs, to document early Christian life and to tie them into contemporary devotion. The third chapter pays special attention to Bernardino Amico’s Trattato de sacri edificii di Terra Santa (1609, 1620). Amico, an Observant Franciscan, produced commentated maps, views, and meticulous scaled architectural plans of the Christian monuments of the Holy Land. His work allows a consideration of the meeting of CounterReform Christian scholarship, antiquarian interest in visualization and measurement, and the tradition of pilgrimage. Chapter Four investigates the scholarship of the Protestant minister and formidable Orientalist Samuel Bochart (1599–1667), and especially his Geographia sacra (Caen, 1646). Bochart’s authority and erudition were widely admired during his lifetime and throughout the eighteenth century,44 yet modern scholarship has so far failed to seriously engage with his oeuvre. I argue that Bochart’s geographical scholarship was distinctly Protestant, while tracing its origins back to the turbulent intellectual and political context of its inception and reception. The chapter also introduces the links between philology and sacred geography, which Bochart, following Montano, brought to perfection. Bochart’s mission in the Geographia was twofold. In Phaleg, following Eusebius and marshaling an intimidating range of sources, Bochart deciphered Genesis 10 and identified the location of each of Noah’s descendents. In Chanaan (both titles were borrowed from Montano) Bochart proceeded to explain the impact of Phoenician navigation on the ancient world. This two-tiered model allowed Bochart to chart human ‘prehistory,’ for which Mosaic geography was the only source, and to link it to the classical tradition of geography. Moreover, working with complex etymologies in European and Oriental languages, Bochart provided countless demonstrations of the Hebraic origins, propagated via the Phoenicians, of languages and cultures in various regions. These regions, significantly, did not include China and the New World. Bochart brought sacred geography to its utmost technical sophistication, while only tacitly admitting that the Bible was not a full account of human history and geography. It was a view that during\n\n44 Bochart was crowned by Pierre Bayle as “un des plus savans hommes du monde.” Dictionnaire historique et critique, ed. Desmaizaux, 5 ed., 4 vols. (Amsterdam: 1740), I:585–87.\n\n20\n\nchapter one\n\nthese very years another Protestant, Isaac La Peyrère, moving in the same learned circles, would state explicitly in his Praeadamitae. Eusebius, although a pioneer of ecclesiastical history, did not include ecclesiastical geography in his master plan as outlined in the Onomasticon. In the sixteenth century and particularly in the seventeenth geographia sacra developed, as noted above, to include ecclesiastical geography and thus went beyond the strictly biblical to embrace a wholly different register. Chapter Five will explore this largely overlooked early modern development and extension of geographia sacra. Maps were an important tool of administration, and the Church, like the emergent monarchical states, was quick to use them. PostTridentine bishops, encouraged to visit and familiarize themselves with their dioceses, sponsored surveys and maps of the communities under their supervision. It became fashionable among monastic orders to record their origins and geographical spread in earlier periods, for which purpose they commissioned special atlases. Maps not only provided efficiency, but also added glory to the Catholic Church by presenting its ancient and enduring hierarchical structure, global missionary reach, and network of shrines. In this capacity ecclesiastical geography inevitably acquired a polemical edge. Chapter Five brings to light a fierce debate of the 1620s, whose main protagonists were the Genevan jurist Jacques Godefroy and the Jesuit Jacques Sirmond, over the geographical extent of the special diocese of the pope in the fourth century. It is shown that ecclesiastical geography was inseparable from explorations made by church historians and antiquaries into early Christian communities, institutions and material culture.45 The chapter ends with an account of the career in ecclesiastical geography of the Augustinian monk Augustin Lubin, who in the second half of the seventeenth century systematized the field and turned it almost into a technical pursuit. An Epilogue (Chapter Six) will trace the stabilization of geographia sacra in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Once the Bible lost its role as the basic research program of human and natural history, and once confessional debates had fallen out of vogue, sacred 45\n\nSimon Ditchfield, Liturgy, Sanctity and History in Tridentine Italy: Pietro Maria Campi and the Preservation of the Particular (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995); Ingo Herklotz, Cassiano Dal Pozzo und die Archäologie des 17. Jahrhunderts (München: Hirmer, 1999).\n\nearly modern geographia sacra\n\n21\n\ngeography lost its resonance and significance. Moreover, the field itself had been almost exhausted. With Bochart, the progeny of Noah had been definitively charted; Jacques Bonfrère edited Eusebius’ Onomasticon and perfected the map of Judea; Christian van Adrichem and Louis Cappel fully researched Jerusalem and the Temple, respectively; Franciscus Quaresmius gave an authoritative statement of Christian pilgrimage and the traditions relating to the sacred sites in the Holy Land; with Augustin Lubin, ecclesiastical geography was fully methodized. Until the beginning of Near Eastern scientific archaeology in the late nineteenth century, no major advances would be gained over these fruits of the concentrated effort of scholars all over Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It is during the later phase of that efflorescence that an Anglican preacher and writer, Thomas Fuller, could popularize sacred geography, and use it as a platform from which to comment on current English affairs, or that Friedrich Spanheim, Jr., would publish an introduction to the subject for young students, and that Jean Le Clerc would write a brief history of sacred geography, and thus incorporate it into the historia litteraria of Europe.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE ANTWERP POLYGLOT BIBLE: MAPS, SCHOLARSHIP, AND EXEGESIS The Council of Trent (1545–64), the founding event of the CounterReformation, also marked the beginning of the spectacular ecclesiastical career of Benito Arias Montano (1527–98, Figure 1).1 Poet laureate, member of the Military Order of St. James, Doctor of Theology, Orientalist, and a leading biblical scholar, Montano was chosen by Bishop Martín Peréz de Ayala to join the Spanish delegation to the third session-period of the Council (1562–64), and won praise for his interventions on communion and on marriage.2 For Montano, however, 1 An earlier version of this chapter appeared as “Sacred Geography, Antiquarianism and Visual Erudition: Benito Arias Montano and the Maps in the Antwerp Polyglot Bible,” Imago Mundi 55, no. 1 (2003): 56–80.

During his stay in Trent Montano was able to examine ancient coins, buy and translate Hebrew books from Istanbul, and obtain a map of Canaan. Montano later used this map to illustrate the Apparatus sacer of the famous Antwerp Polyglot Bible, printed under Philip II’s auspices by Christophe Plantin, and of which Montano was the chief editor. Montano’s encounter with a map while at Trent and its later reworking into the Antwerp Polyglot opens a window onto the broader question of maps and religion in early modern Europe. When set against the rich intellectual and political context in which they were created and disseminated, prominent examples of geographia sacra such as these enable discussion of several key questions regarding their meaning and contemporary significance: How do maps function within an exegetical framework? What was the significance of the denominational rift in their conception and execution? How did biblical maps relate to the flowering of secular cartography, the geographical revolution, during the early modern period? As discussed in the opening chapter, Abraham Ortelius’ Catalogus auctorum in his celebrated Theatrum orbis terrarum (1570)—that invaluable ‘Who’s Who’ of late sixteenth-century cartography— demonstrates how deeply involved early modern mapmakers were in religious activities and scholarship.3 Like others in Plantin’s circle, Ortelius himself was to some extent sympathetic to the mystical and pietistic ideals of the Family of Love. As Giorgio Mangani has shown, Ortelius’s religious cartography was reflected in his use of the heartshaped projection, which intended to embody the union of Christian charity with Neostoic ideals.4 The authors listed on Ortelius’ Catalogus,\n\nhis recall from the Low Countries he was the librarian of the Escorial, and then, in 1586, retreated to his estate near Seville, where he died in 1598. 3 Robert W.

Modern scholarship, however, still lacks a comprehensive study that addresses the complex ways in which cartography operated within these religious and scholarly contexts. In the case of Holy Land maps, for example, we have fine albums and carto-bibliographies, yet very little that addresses contemporary discourses about the Holy Land and their relation to its cartography.5 In their survey of maps in Bibles in the sixteenth century, Catherine Delano Smith and Elizabeth Ingram opened the field for new kinds of questions about cartography and religion in the early modern period. Although their focus was on a specific genre in a single century, Delano Smith and Ingram made it clear that it is by no means obvious how maps function in such religious contexts as theology and exegesis, and that the question requires further historical investigation, specifically taking into account the wider social currents that mapmakers and their readers were navigating. Delano Smith’s and Ingram’s bibliographic survey was based on some 1,000 printed sixteenth-century Bibles, of which only 176 include maps. Their research revealed that maps never appear in Bibles printed in Catholic countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, and very rarely in Latin and French Bibles.6\n\n(Tournhout: Brepols, 1998). Recent scholarship on The Family of Love tends to circumscribe the group’s extent and influence.

Arie-Jan Gelderblom, Jan L. de Jong and M. van Vaeck, 89–139 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2004). 5 For an album with valuable notes see Kenneth Nebenzahl, Maps of the Holy Land: Images of Terra Sancta through Two Millennia (New York: Abbeville Press, 1986); see also Eva Wajntraub and Gimpel Wajntraub, Hebrew Maps of the Holy Land (Wien: Brüder Hollinek, 1992); Eran Laor and Shoshanna Klein, Maps of the Holy Land: Cartobibliography of Printed Maps, 1475–1900 (New York: A. R. Liss, 1986); Rehav Rubin’s pioneering scholarly study of Jerusalem maps pays attention mostly to formalvisual analysis and to map provenance: Image and Reality: Jerusalem in Maps and Views (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 1999). 6 Catherine Delano Smith and Elizabeth M. Ingram, Maps in Bibles, 1500–1600: An Illustrated Catalogue (Genève: Droz, 1991). The first printed Bible map appeared with Froschauer’s Old Testament (Zurich, 1525), based on Luther’s translation. Later, the Geneva Bible, which appeared in many editions, contained five maps (Exodus, Eden, Division of Canaan, The Holy Land at the Time of Christ, Eastern Mediterranean). See also their other important contributions: Delano Smith, “Geography or Christianity? Maps of the Holy Land before AD 1000,” Journal of Theological Studies 42 (1991): 143–52; “Maps as Art ‘and’ Science: Maps in 16th Century Bibles,” Imago Mundi 42 (1990): 65–83; “Maps in Bibles in the 16th Century,” The Map Collector 39 (1987): 2–14; Delano Smith and Mayer I. Gruber, “Rashi’s Legacy: Maps of the Holy Land,”\n\nthe antwerp polyglot bible\n\n27\n\nThey were thus able to conclude that “the history of maps in Bibles is part of the history of the Reformation.” According to the authors, the Protestant adoption of humanist historical-philological approaches to texts, emphasizing the literal over the allegorical, “is perhaps the key factor that explains why maps were felt by so many Protestant publishers to be useful adjuncts to printed Bibles.”7 Writing about the Galleria delle carte geografiche in the Vatican, Francesca Fiorani extended the argument by claiming that the Galleria project, which was completed in 1581, was in fact a Catholic cartographic response to the wide Protestant use of maps in Bibles.8 The striking quantitative finding that including maps in Bibles was a predominantly Protestant practice puts Montano’s maps—an exception to what appears to be the rule—in a particularly revealing light. Thus, Montano’s approach to cartography and the reasons for his inclusion of maps in the Apparatus of the Polyglot Bible deserve closer attention. This is enabled by the fact that Montano recorded many of his thoughts on the creation and understanding of maps and images in the text of the Apparatus. The aim of this chapter is to explore further this still largely uncharted terrain, and try to extend and nuance Delano Smith’s and Ingram’s thesis. Rather than attributing the spirit of mapping to a general Protestant mapping ethic, I attempt to reconstruct the ways in which maps, visual erudition, and biblical scholarship interacted in Montano’s world, and to open up the notion of geographia sacra to take account of sacred antiquarianism, both textual and visual. Montano’s thoughts on biblical geography, moreover, lay within a broader movement of pious philosophy that attempted to harmonize knowledge of the natural world with Scripture.\n\nThe Map Collector 59 (1992): 30–35; Elizabeth M.

Plantin was persuaded to embark on such a massive project by the rarity of the previous great polyglot edition, the Complutensian of Cardinal Ximenes (completed 1517, published 1520–22).10 Plantin recruited a group of scholars, and even won German Protestant patronage. Yet, after having been forced to print anti-Catholic material during the outbreak in Antwerp of Calvinist iconoclasm in 1566, Plantin eventually decided to apply for Catholic patronage for the Polyglot in order to save his printing house and his own reputation in the eyes of the King. After Philip and his secretary Zayas had granted permission for the project, Plantin was informed that Benito Arias Montano, the King’s chaplain, would supervise the project. In May 17, 1568, after a tortuous sea journey, Montano reached Antwerp to take charge of the Polyglot, one of the most ambitious printing projects of the time. In Antwerp he spent seven incredibly productive years, and also made some of his most intimate friends.11\n\n9 Basil Hall, “Biblical Scholarship: Editions and Commentaries,” in The Cambridge History of the Bible, vol. 3: The West from the Reformation to the Present Day, ed.

The project involved the concerted and prolonged work of experts in Oriental languages and biblical scholarship—including Masius, Postel’s students, the brothers Guy and Nicolas Lefèvre de la Boderie, and Franciscus Raphelenghius, Plantin’s son-in-law. By the end of two years Montano’s team of scholars and Plantin’s proofreaders, with the collaboration of the Doctors of the Faculty of Theology in Louvain, had the biblical texts ready for typesetting.13 The first four volumes of the Polyglot contain the Hebrew Old Testament, with the Vulgate, Septuagint, and Aramaic translations, while the fifth contains the New Testament in Greek, Latin and Syriac.14\n\nAbrahami Ortelii (geographi Antverpiensis) et virorum eruditorum ad eundem et ad Jacobum Colium Ortelianum (Abrahami Ortelii sororis filium) epistulae.

In September 1592 Montano even went as far as offering Justus Lipsius, one of his Antwerp acquaintances, to be the inheritor of his estate: Ronald W. Truman, “Justus Lipsius, Arias Montano and Pedro Ximenes,” Bulletin de l’Institut Historique Belge de Rome 68 (1998): 367–86. 12 “Estant donc de retour en ceste ville, je trouvay Monsigneur le docteur en théologie Bénédict Arias Montanus, officier de la Sainte Inquisition en Espagne, Chevalier de l’ordre de Saint Jaques, personnage, outre l’estat de noblesse et degré qu’il tient, non seulment autant accompli en la science des langues hébraïcque, chaldaïcque, syrienne, grecque, latine et diverses autres, mais aussi doué d’une autant souveraine modestie, prudence, amour divin, et toutes autres vertues divines qu’oncques j’en ay sceu congnoistre.” Plantin to Maximilian de Berghes, Archbishop of Cambrai, 28 June, 1568, Plantin, Correspondance, I, no. 137. 13 In an often quoted passage Plantin describes how his thirteen-year old daughter, Magdelaine, used to read the biblical texts to Montano: she was in charge of bringing “toutes les espreuves des grandes Bibles Royal au logis de Monsgr le Docteur B. Arias Montanus et de lire, des originaux Hebraïcques, Chaldéens, Syriacques, Grecs et Latins, le contenu desdictes espreuves, tandis que mondict Sr le docteur observe diligemment si nos feilles sont telles qu’il convient pour les imprimer.” Plantin to Zayas, 4 November 1570, Plantin, Correspondance, II: 251, p. 175–76. 14 For a complete bibliographic description of the Polyglot see Léon Voet and Jenny Voet-Grisolle, The Plantin Press (1555–1589): A Bibliography of the Works Printed and Published by Christopher Plantin at Antwerp and Leiden, 6 vols.

The idea of an apparatus was not new. The old Complutensian had already offered its readers a volume of reading aids, including Greek, Hebrew and Chaldean dictionaries and a Hebrew grammar. As the practice of studying the Holy Scriptures in their original languages became more common during the sixteenth century, other sophisticated tools for precise reading were published, such as biblical name indexes.15 Montano, however, furnished his Polyglot with a selection of study aids unprecedented in quantity and comprehensiveness.16 In the Apparatus volumes one finds, besides dictionaries and grammars for Hebrew, Syriac, and Greek, also a non-Vulgate, literal Latin translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, copious indices, and various methodological essays on translation. For Volume Eight, the third of the Apparatus, Montano composed a number of learned treatises that add up to a complete ethnography of the ancient Hebrews. Montano summed up and elucidated what was then at the forefront of biblical scholarship, and in his view, of scholarship at large. Montano also included four maps—Orbis tabula, Terra Canaan Abrahae tempore, Terra Israel in tribus undecim distributa, Antiqua Ierusalem—and about ten antiquarian illustrations of architectural designs, biblical monuments, and liturgical vestments\n\n15 For example, Robert Estienne’s Hebraea & Chaldaea nomina virorum, mulierum, populorum, idoloru[m], urbium, fluuiorum, montium, caeterorumque locoru[m], quae in Bibliis leguntur, ordine alphabeti Hebraici (Paris: Rob. Stephani, typographi Regii, 1549). An excellent overview with an emphasis on Protestant biblical scholarship in the sixteenth century is Debora K. Shuger, The Renaissance Bible: Scholarship, Sacrifice, and Subjectivity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), ch. 1. See also François Laplanche, Bible, sciences et pouvoirs au XVIIe siècle (Napoli: Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Filosofici, 1997). 16 For example, while Estienne’s Hebraea & Chaldaea nomina gave only Hebrew names and their Latin translations, Montano amplified this format to include, as Plantin duly emphasized in his ‘Preface to the Christian Reader,’ short descriptions of biblical figures’ lives, and geographical descriptions based on classical authors: Montano, ‘Hebraica, Chaldaea, Graeca et Latina nomina virorum, mulierum, populorum, idolorum, urbium, flu"
