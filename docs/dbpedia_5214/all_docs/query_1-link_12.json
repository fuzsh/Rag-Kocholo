He has written numerous important books, many of which include his full sermons. Flavel was a proponent of Monergism (the concept of salvation without the individual's own belief), which appeared throughout Flavel's works. One such work was 'Token for Mourners'. In this book, Flavel offers direction on spiritual and emotional healing following death based on how Mary, the mother of Jesus, dealt with the loss of her son.\n\nThis particular edition is noteworthy for being an early American edition. Newbury, Vermont was not considered a major hub of American printing; as such, this work is considered to be quite rare and valuable.\n\nItem number: #19990\n\nPrice: $599\n\nFLAVEL, John\n\nA token for mourners, or, The advice of Christ to a distressed mother, bewailing the death of her dear and only son\n\nNewbury, (Vermont) : Printed by Nathaniel Coverly, 1796.\n\nDetails:\n\n·… Read More\n\nMore Photos\n\nLes Psaumes de David : Mis en Vers François.\n\nby PELLET, Pierre\n\nUsed\n\nnear fine\n\nHardcover\n\nShow Details\n\nDescription:\n\n1745 Geneva Huguenot Bible Psalms of David Music French Chant Pellet Switzerland\n\nA very rare and highly desirable 18th-century printing of the Psalms of David each set to vocal chant music.

While Anselm was relatively unknown and unrecognized for his philosophical views during his lifetime, he has since been considered the founder of scholasticism and writing about the existence of God in an academic manner rather than purely theological. The ODCC refers to Anselm as being 'the most luminous and penetrating intellect between St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas…and the father of scholasticism'. Many of his writings set the stage for a European period of innovating logic, ethics, mysticism, and metaphysics.\n\nThis 1547 printing of the works of Anselm features his commentary on the Epistles of Paul.\n\nItem number: #20839\n\nPrice: $950\n\nANSELM, Saint of Canterbury\n\nD.
