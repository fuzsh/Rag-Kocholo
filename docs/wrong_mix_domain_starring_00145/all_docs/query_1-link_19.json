She was promoted to Senior Associate Athletics Director – Academic Affairs for Athletics in 2013.\n\nIn her role, Beitz directs the Academic Affairs for the Athletics Department, which oversees each student-athlete’s academic progress, including academic advising and tutoring, while serving as the liaison between the student-athlete and the University’s academic community.\n\nBeitz and her team of academic coordinators work closely with each athletics program in an effort to assure every student-athlete is given the opportunity to earn a degree and secure a meaningful career after graduation.\n\nSince Beitz joined Liberty’s Athletics Affairs for Athletics staff, the student-athletes’ grade-point averages have continued to rise. The athletics department as a whole has maintained an average GPA of 3.0 or better during each of the last seven years, culminating with a 3.1 cumulative student-athletes’ GPA in the Fall of 2013.\n\nDuring Beitz’ first 11 years at Liberty (through the end of the 2016-17 academic year), Flames student-athletes have earned a total of 27 CoSIDA Academic All-America awards. Among these awardees, 14 were named first team Academic All-Americans.\n\nOver that same time span, a total of 15 Liberty student-athletes have earned the prestigious Christenberry Award from the Big South, for maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA through their careers.\n\nUnder Beitz’ guidance, Liberty Athletics has shown a marked growth in community outreach and professional development for student-athletes. Among the department’s many initiatives is the Keep it Moving with Character Camp and the Give a Dollar Campaign.\n\nAdditionally, Liberty’s Academic Affairs for Athletics office was granted national academic certification by the National Association of Academic Advisors for Athletics (N4A) in May 2011.

Additionally, Liberty AAA continues to present current trends at N4A National and Regional Conventions.\n\nBeitz serves as a 21st Century grant partner for R.S.

As a member of the Cavaliers’ athletics department, Beitz assisted the student-athletes with time management, study skills and organizational techniques, while also serving as an academic advisor and in the areas of recruiting.\n\nBeitz received her bachelor’s degree in social sciences from Radford in 1996 as she attended the Big South institution on a field hockey scholarship and served as team captain her senior year.\n\nThe native of Richmond, Va., later continued her educational pursuits, earning her master’s degree in special education from Radford in 1997 and an education specialist degree in administration and supervision from Virginia in 2003."
