Have an account? .\n\nRobert Downey Jr. is best known for playing Iron Man, but he's been acting since he was a child.\n\nThe actor's highest-rated films include \"Richard III\" (1995) and \"True Believer\" (1989).\n\nHis lowest-rated movies, however, are \"Johnny Be Good\" (1988) and \"Friends and Lovers\" (1999).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Downey Jr.'s lowest-rated movie is \"Johnny Be Good\" (1988).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 0%\n\nSummary: In \"Johnny Be Good,\" prized quarterback Johnny Walker (Anthony Michael Hall) gets a flurry of college offers before he graduates. While his best friend (Robert Downey Jr.) suggests he waits for the best option, his girlfriend (Uma Thurman) pressures him to pick their state school.\n\nCritics agreed across the board that there was nothing redeemable about the slap-stick-heavy film.\n\nGuillermo Altares wrote it off as \"an insufferable comedy\" in his review for El Pais.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had a brief cameo in \"Up the Academy\" (1980).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 0%\n\nSummary: In \"Up the Academy,\" four geeks are sent to Sheldon R. Wienberg Military Academy and find a way to stick it to the Major.\n\nThe actor appeared briefly in a scene of the film, which was directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.\n\nCritics across the board panned the pre-pubescent comedy.\n\n\"I can't remember anticipating the end of a film with such exuberance,\" Michael Blowen wrote for The Boston Globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Hans in \"Friends and Lovers\" (1999).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 7%\n\nSummary: When Ian (George Newbern) gets a chance to reconnect with his estranged father at a ski lodge in Utah, he decides to bring his closest friends along for the ride.\n\nDowney Jr. had a supporting role in the film as Hans, a smooth-talking ski instructor.\n\n\"Friends and Lovers\" was ripped apart by critics, who found it offensive and somewhat boring.\n\n\"This movie is not merely bad, but incompetent,\" Roger Ebert wrote for the Chicago Sun-Times. \"I get tapes in the mail from 10th graders that are better made than this.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Air America\" (1990), he was Billy Covington.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 13%\n\nSummary: After losing his pilot's license, Billy Covington (Downey Jr.) is approached by Air America to transport illegal goods through Southeast Asia alongside hot-headed copilot Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson).\n\nCritics couldn't help but feel like actors phoned in their performances for the action-comedy.\n\n\"Everybody on-screen seems awfully bored,\" Rob Thomas wrote for the Capital Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Pete Graham in \"Gothika\" (2003).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 14%\n\nSummary: In this mind-bending thriller, criminal psychologist Dr. Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) suddenly finds herself trapped in a mental hospital after she's accused of killing her husband.\n\nDowney Jr. starred opposite Berry as Dr. Pete Graham.\n\nWith endless plot twists and preposterous writing, \"Gothika\" fell flat for most critics.\n\nNell Minow called it a \"grisly, disturbing, extremely violent horror film\" in her review for Common Sense Media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Reed Richmond in \"Too Much Sun\" (1991).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 14%\n\nSummary: When their wealthy father passes away, his son (Eric Idle) and daughter (Andrea Martin) learn that they can only access their inheritance if they produce an heir within a year.\n\nIn \"Too Much Sun,\" Downey Jr. had a supporting role as real-estate agent Reed Richmond.\n\nThe comedy made critics uneasy with its outdated depictions of gay characters.\n\n\"While 'Too Much Sun' is hardly offensive enough to merit a community outcry, it's certainly worth a collective cold shoulder,\" Karl Soehnlein wrote for Out Week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowney Jr. starred as Dr. John Dolittle in \"Dolittle\" (2020).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 15%\n\nSummary: Blessed with an uncanny ability to communicate with animals, Dr. John Dolittle (Downey Jr.) sets off on the high seas with a menagerie of friends to secure a healing miracle for Queen Victoria.\n\n\"Dolittle\" didn't win over many critics, who gave it poor marks for distracting animation sequences and underwhelming dialogue.\n\n\"It's symptomatic of an awkward, unwieldy movie that has lots of material to show you and lots of surface distractions, but nothing at all to say,\" Kevin Maher wrote for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Tuff Turf\" (1985), he was Jimmy Parker.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 17%\n\nSummary: After moving to Los Angeles, rebellious teen Morgan (James Spader) and his new friend Jimmy (Downey Jr.) try to charm local girls and fend off bullies in this coming-of-age drama.\n\nAccording to critics, \"Tuff Turf\" was all bravado with little substance.\n\nDavid Nusair said \"Tuff Turf\" was about \"as bad as it gets when it comes to cheesy '80s teen flicks,\" in his review for Reel Film Reviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Vivian Thompson in the horror flick \"In Dreams\" (1999).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 25%\n\nSummary: Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) finds herself haunted by someone else's memories after a serial killer (Downey Jr.) descends on her cozy New England town.\n\nSome found the film too routine and others found it too abstract, but either way, \"In Dreams\" failed to enthrall reviewers.\n\n\"[It's an] ambitious but ultimately incoherent and frustrating tale that may be too cerebral for the horror genre crowds and too literal-minded for the genre's more intelligent viewers,\" Emanuel Levy wrote for Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006), the actor appeared as Marcus Kozak.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 26%\n\nSummary: After work-obsessed lawyer Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is bit by a sheepdog, he starts magically transforming into a dog, and his perspective on family changes for the better.\n\nDowney Jr. played the villainous Dr. Marcus Kozak.\n\nHarmless but largely forgettable, \"The Shaggy Dog\" was decidedly geared towards young children and left little for adults to enjoy.\n\n\"Man becomes mutt in this inoffensive, uneven comedy that fails to make the most of its comic potential or familiar cast,\" Anna Smith wrote for Empire Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor appeared in \"Lucky You\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 28%\n\nSummary: In \"Lucky You,\" a talented poker player (Eric Bana) vies for a spot in the world championship game in Las Vegas while balancing an intense love affair. But by the time the tournament starts, he's in debt to multiple people and risks going up against his estranged father (Robert Duvall).\n\nDowney Jr. appeared in the film as Telephone Jack.\n\nMost critics weren't impressed with the film, calling it slow and predictable.\n\nDavid Denby wrote for The New Yorker, \"Most of 'Lucky You,' starting with the title, is ordinary or outright awful. Moviemakers, it seems, cannot bluff their way to success.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Franz Mazur in \"Hugo Pool\" (1997).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 29%\n\nSummary: In this eccentric comedy, Hugo Dugay (Alyssa Milano) encounters oddball characters as she cleans pools across Los Angeles.\n\nDowney Jr. starred alongside Milano as filmmaker Franz Mazur.\n\nOverall, critics called \"Hugo Pool\" a relatively shallow and mildly diverting drama.\n\nShannon J. Harvey described it as an \"interesting, but not riveting, slice of life [film] in Southern California,\" in her review for The Sunday Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowney Jr. played Special Agent Royce in \"US Marshals\" (1998).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 30%\n\nSummary: In this follow-up to \"The Fugitive\" (1993), US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team of agents track down escaped convict Sheridan (Wesley Snipes).\n\nDowney Jr. filled out the ensemble cast as Special Agent Royce.\n\nA by-the-numbers spin-off, \"US Marshals\" failed to captivate critics.\n\n\"'US Marshals' merely spins through the pursuit-thriller motions,\" Yael Shuv wrote for Total Film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Lionel Sweeney in \"Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus\" (2006).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 32%\n\nSummary: Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) works as a doting assistant for her photographer husband (Ty Burrell) until she finds herself distracted by her secluded neighbor, Lionel Sweeney (Downey Jr.).\n\n\"Fur\" was received as a heavily stylized but aimless production.\n\n\"An interestingly designed but inescapably pointless film,\" Peter Bradshaw wrote for The Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"One Night Stand\" (1997), he played Charlie.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nSummary: In \"One Night Stand,\" Max (Snipes) flies to New York to visit his old friend Charlie (Downey Jr.) and fights temptations to cheat on his wife (Ming-Na Wen) while he's away from home.\n\nCritics fell in love with the acting performances at the center of the film but found little else to recommend in the drama.\n\n\"The performances are all fine; it's the writer, composer, and director, Mike Figgis all, that spoil the show,\" critic David N. Butterworth wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor was Nick Penrose in \"Eros\" (2004).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nSummary: \"Eros\" is an anthology from three filmmakers — Michelangelo Antonioni, Steven Soderbergh, and Wong Kar Wai — that revolves around love and intimacy.\n\nIn the segment \"Equilibrium,\" Downey Jr. played Nick Penrose, an advertising executive in 1950s New York.\n\nIn critics' eyes, \"Eros\" showed moments of inspiration but couldn't overcome its unpredictable tone and plotting.\n\n\"Anthologies by their inherent nature tend to be highly uneven,\" Tom Dawson wrote for the BBC. \"And 'Eros' proves no exception, with the individual sections ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowney Jr. appeared as Lee in \"Firstborn\" (1984).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 36%\n\nSummary: Eldest son Jake (Christopher Collet) steps up to protect his family when his mother's (Teri Garr) abusive new boyfriend moves in.\n\nIn the family drama, Downey Jr. played Jake's friend Lee.\n\nCritics praised the actors at work in \"Firstborn\" but felt like the movie tripped itself up in every other regard.\n\n\"The best things about 'Firstborn' are the easy, natural performances of the actors,\" Janet Maslin wrote for the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor made a brief cameo in \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" (1985).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 36%\n\nSummary: In \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\" talented gymnast Janey (Sarah Jessica Parker) moves to a new town and meets Lynne (Helen Hunt), who shows her how to disobey her father and have fun.
