        "text": "A cannabis cultivation operation is being planned for a site just outside downtown Binghamton.\n\nDeveloper Eric Rundels wants to grow marijuana in an 11,000-square-foot building at 225 Chenango Street. He expects to use 3,100-square feet for cultivation space.\n\nRundels is seeking a state license to operate the facility. He told members of the city planning commission cannabis will be grown and lightly-processed at the site. He said the plants would be trimmed and packaged there.\n\nRundels said security cameras will be installed inside and outside the facility to comply with state regulations.\n\nThe cannabis operation won't be open to the public. The place will be accessible only to employees.\n\nRundels said there will be no signage identifying the building as being a marijuana-growing site. He said signs are prohibited by the state Office of Cannabis Management.\n\nCarbon filtration systems are to be installed to mitigate the odor associated with such facilities.\n\nA zoning change would be needed for the project to go forward because the site is not in an area where cannabis-related business now are permitted.\n\nProperty records show the building is owned by Forman Holdings LLC of Ithaca.\n\nThe city planning commission has scheduled a public hearing on the proposed cultivation project for its August 6 meeting."
