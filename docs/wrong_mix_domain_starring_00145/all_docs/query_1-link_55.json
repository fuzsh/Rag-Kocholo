Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDan Aykroyd: four seasons (1975-1979)\n\nDan Aykroyd was one of the original \"Not Ready for Primetime Players,\" aka the first cast of \"Saturday Night Live.\" He was originally hired as just a writer, but was made part of the cast before the show premiered. In addition to starring in classic sketches like the Coneheads, the Blues Brothers, and \"Two Wild and Crazy Guys,\" Aykroyd co-hosted \"Weekend Update\" for a season alongside Jane Curtin.\n\nAykroyd, 69, left the show in 1979, and began focusing on movies. He co-wrote the movie version of his sketch \"The Blues Brothers\" and starred in it alongside John Belushi. It's one of his most recognizable roles to date.\n\nHis other most famous role? Raymond Stantz in the now-classic \"Ghostbusters\" in 1984, and its 1989 sequel. That same year, Aykroyd was nominated for an Oscar for his role in \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" He reprised his role as Stantz in the 2021 sequel, \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\"\n\nHe's also had a successful business career. He co-founded the music venue chain the House of Blues and co-founded Crystal Head Vodka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Belushi: four seasons (1975-1979)\n\nWhen Rolling Stone ranked all then-145 cast members of \"SNL,\" they put John Belushi in the top spot, calling him \"the first rock & roll star of comedy.\" Belushi was another one of the seven original cast members, and was known for his characters such as a traditional samurai (who frequently had jobs a samurai most likely would not have), and his impressions of pop culture figures like Marlon Brando, Beethoven, and Captain Kirk from \"Star Trek.\"\n\nAfter leaving the show alongside his friend and collaborator Dan Aykroyd, he starred in the \"Blues Brothers\" movie and in his most iconic film role, Bluto in \"Animal House.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Belushi also struggled with drug addiction, and died due to an overdose in March 1982. He was 33 years old.\n\nHis career inspired many comedic legends and future \"SNL\" stars like Chris Farley. His life story was turned into the film \"Wired,\" which was critically panned for not accurately capturing the spirit of Belushi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChevy Chase: two seasons (1975-1976)\n\nChevy Chase was arguably the first big star to come out of \"SNL\" and also the first big star to leave the cast in 1976, after sticking around for just two seasons. He also has the distinction of being the very first \"Weekend Update\" anchor. For the first season, he was also typically the person who gave the now-standard greeting of \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night,\" followed by a pratfall.\n\nChase earned five Emmy nominations for his work as both a writer and performer on \"SNL,\" winning three.\n\nAfter Chase left, he starred in beloved films like \"Caddyshack,\" \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" (and its sequels), and \"Fletch.\" He also hosted the ill-fated \"Chevy Chase Show\" which was canceled after five weeks.\n\nTo recent audiences, 78-year-old Chase is best known as Pierce Hawthorne from \"Community,\" in which he plays a senior citizen who refuses to graduate from community college, and is a moist toilette tycoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge Coe: one season (1975)\n\nGeorge Coe was only credited for the show's first episode, though he appeared sporadically throughout the first season. At 46, he was also the oldest member of the cast at the time. He held that title until Leslie Jones joined the cast in 2014.\n\nAfter leaving, Coe went on to have a decades-long career in Hollywood, especially in voice-over. He appeared in animated series like \"The Legend of Korra,\" \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars,\" and in four seasons of \"Archer\" as the titular character's valet.\n\nCoe died in 2015 at the age of 86.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJane Curtin: five seasons (1975-1980)\n\nJane Curtin was another \"Not Ready for Primetime Player\" and part of the original cast. She typically played the straight woman part against the more zany characters played by her co-stars. She also co-hosted \"Weekend Update\" for three seasons, making her the first female anchor of the segment. Curtin also regularly appeared as part of the Coneheads sketch.\n\nUnlike many of her co-stars, when Curtin left \"SNL,\" she mainly stuck to TV roles. She won back-to-back Emmys for her role in \"Kate & Allie,\" which aired for six seasons. Curtin then starred on all six seasons of \"3rd Rock from the Sun,\" in which she, again, played the straight woman.\n\nCurtin, 75, still acts, and recently appeared in comedy films \"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" \"The Heat,\" \"Queen Bees,\" and the sitcom \"United We Fall\" on ABC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarrett Morris: five seasons (1975-1980)\n\nGarrett Morris was part of the first cast of \"SNL,\" and therefore the first person of color on the show, which has been accused of struggling with diversity.\n\nMorris' most famous characters were Dominican baseball player Chico Escuela, who had the catchphrase \"Baseball bin berra berra good to me,\" and the \"News for the Hard of Hearing\" translator, who just screamed the headlines that \"Weekend Update\" anchor Chevy Chase would say. He reprised the role on \"Family Guy\" decades later.\n\nWhile Morris has been positive about his tenure on the show, future Black cast members have spoken about trying to avoid getting pigeonholed like he was perceived to have been. According to Vulture, Eddie Murphy even said that producers tried to \"Garrett Morris\" him.\n\nMorris, 85, steadily acted after he left the show, and has had a successful career in sitcoms. He starred in \"The Jamie Foxx Show\" from 1996 to 2001, and in \"2 Broke Girls\" from 2011 to 2017. Morris also narated the pilot of the NBC sitcom \"Grand Crew\" in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaraine Newman: five seasons (1975-1980)\n\nRolling Stone called Laraine Newman the \"most underrated member of the original cast.\" She preferred not to repeat characters, unlike her co-stars, so she had fewer notable characters, but one of her most famous was valley girl Sherry.\n\nThe pressure of the show weighed heavy on Newman, who ended up snorting heroin, according to Time.\n\nAfter the show, Newman, 70, found success in voice acting. She's appeared in dozens of animated classics including \"Shrek 2,\" \"Wreck-It Ralph,\" \"Inside Out,\" Spongebob Squarepants,\" and perhaps most famously, as Ginger's mother in \"As Told by Ginger.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael O'Donoghue: one season (1975)\n\nMichael O'Donoghue was the first head writer of \"SNL,\" and remained behind-the-scenes after he stopped appearing on the show. But O'Donoghue has the distinction of uttering the first ever lines of \"SNL\" and for that remains iconic.\n\nWhile O'Donoghue was a talented comedy writer (and less of a performer), he sometimes appeared as Mr. Mike, a deadpan storyteller who loved to tell classic bedtime stories with a black comedy spin such as \"The Little Engine that Died.\"\n\nO'Donoghue left the show in 1978 but returned in 1981, only to leave again that year. He made his final return in 1985 when the show's creator, Lorne Michaels, returned as well. It wasn't meant to be, and he was fired a month later, according to Vulture.\n\nHe died in 1994 at the age of 54 from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGilda Radner: five seasons (1975-1980)\n\nGilda Radner is probably the most universally beloved member of the original cast. She is known for iconic characters like Roseanne Roseannadanna and Emily Litella, who frequently appeared on \"Weekend Update,\" nerdy girl Lisa Loopner, and Baba Wawa, a spoof of Barbara Walters.\n\nRadner remained on the show for five years, while also starring in a one-woman show on Broadway called \"Gilda Radner — Live from New York.\" She also earned an Emmy for her time on the show.\n\nAfter she left, she starred in a movie called \"Hanky Panky\" in 1982 where she met her future husband, Gene Wilder. The two co-starred in two more movies together, \"The Woman in Red\" and \"Haunted Honeymoon.\"\n\nIn 1986, Radner was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After a brief remission, Radner passed away in 1989 at the age of 42. News of her death broke while frequent \"SNL\" host Steve Martin was preparing his opening monologue, which was then scrapped and replaced by a tearful Martin introducing a sketch the two had appeared in in 1978.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill Murray: four seasons (1977-1980)\n\nBill Murray was the first new cast member to be added to the show when he joined the cast during its second season. During his tenure, he hosted \"Weekend Update,\" created beloved characters like Nick the Lounge Singer, and got into a fist fight with Chevy Chase when he returned to host the show. Murray won his first Emmy for \"SNL\" in 1977.\n\nAfter his departure from \"SNL,\" Murray appeared in a slew of comedic hits including \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Caddyshack,\" and \"Tootsie\" during the '80s. He also starred in the rom-com \"Groundhog's Day\" in 1993 and in cult classic \"Space Jam.\"\n\nMurray, 71, made his comeback in 2003 in the movie \"Lost In Translation,\" which earned him a Golden Globe and an Oscar nom. Since then, he's become a beloved pop culture presence, cameoing as himself in \"Zombieland\" — and again in \"Zombieland: Double Tap\" — voicing Baloo in the live-action \"Jungle Book\" and hosting the Netflix special \"A Very Murray Christmas.\"\n\nHe reprised his role as Dr. Peter Venkman in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and also starred in Wes Anderson's newest film, \"The French Dispatch\" in 2021. He's set to join the MCU in 20223 with a role in \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\"\n\nIn April 2022, the new Aziz Ansari-directed film \"Being Mortal\" had its production suspended due to reported \"inappropriate behavior\" on set by Murray, according to Deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Franken: 12 seasons (1977-1980, 1985-1995)\n\nAl Franken had been with the show from the beginning as a writer, but began appearing in sketches in 1977. In his first stint, he primarily appeared alongside his writing partner, Tom Davis. Franken left the show in 1980 when creator Lorne Michaels left, and returned for the 1985-86 season when Michaels did as well.\n\nThe '80s were considered Franken's peak on the show, when he debuted one of the most famous \"SNL\" recurring characters, self-help guru Stuart Smalley. He left the show in 1995 when he was passed over for anchor of \"Weekend Update,\" which was given to Norm MacDonald instead.\n\nFranken, 71, continued working as a comedian until February 2007, when he announced he was running for senator representing Minnesota. He won, and held office until December 2017, when he resigned amidst multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, according to Politico.\n\nFranken now has a podcast, and is making media appearances again. He also began hosting a SiriusXM show in 2019, \"The Al Franken Show.\" In September 2021, he began his \"The Only Former US Senator Currently on Tour Tour.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Davis: three seasons (1977-1980)\n\nLike the other half of the comedic duo Franken & Davis, Tom Davis was originally hired as a writer on \"SNL\" before getting cast as a performer.\n\nDavis left the show when Lorne Michaels did, and continued to write for movies and TV, including the movies \"Coneheads\" and \"One More Saturday Night.\" He also wrote an autobiography, \"39 Years of Short-Term Memory Loss.\"\n\nDavis passed away due to throat and neck cancer in 2012. He was 59.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Shearer: two seasons (1979-1980, 1984-1985)\n\nHarry Shearer was hired in 1979 as an \"unofficial replacement\" for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who had both left the show. He left in 1980, and a few years later co-wrote and starred in mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nWhile promoting the film, Shearer was invited back to the show, and stayed for another season before quitting again. He made a statement that he left due to creative differences.\n\n\"I was creative, and they were different,\" he told AP.\n\nShearer, 78, is best known now for his voice acting, specifically for his roles on \"The Simpsons.\" He is responsible for voicing long-running characters Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner, and many others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Aykroyd: one season (1980)\n\nPeter Aykroyd was the younger brother of \"SNL\" legend Dan Aykroyd. Alas, Peter's tenure was considerably shorter, as he only lasted a season on the show as a writer and performer.\n\nAfter leaving, he co-wrote the film \"Nothing but Trouble\" alongside his brother, but didn't appear on camera after a 1999 TV movie called \"Justice.\"\n\nHe died in November 2021 at the age of 65.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Downey: one season (1979-1980)\n\nJim Downey is mainly known as a writer for \"SNL,\" as he wrote for 27 seasons of the show. This gives him one of the longest tenures in the show's history. When creator Lorne Michaels left the show in 1980, however, Downey left with him, cutting his stint as a performer short.\n\nOne of Downey's most famous bits as a writer was coining the word \"strategery,\" which was used in a sketch about President Bush in 2000 and became a real term in the Bush administration and amongst Republican figures.\n\nDowney, 69, also appeared in episodes of \"30 Rock,\" Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" and \"Kate & Allie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Doyle-Murray: two seasons (1979-1980, 1981-1982)\n\nHe's part of another \"SNL\" dynasty — Brian Doyle-Murray is the older brother of Bill Murray. He appeared in the show's fifth and seventh seasons. He was also a writer, and was nominated for two Emmy awards.\n\nAfter leaving the show, he appeared in \"Caddyshack,\" \"National Lampoon's Family Vacation,\" and \"Sixteen Candles.\" The 76-year-old's distinctive voice can also be heard in \"Spongebob Squarepants\" as the Flying Dutchman and as Captain K'nuckles in \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack.\" He most recently appeared on-screen in \"Lodge 49.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon Novello: two seasons (1979-1980, 1985-1986)\n\nDon Novello was a writer on \"SNL\" for years before appearing on the 1979-1980 season. He left alongside almost the entire cast when creator Lorne Michaels left in the '80s. He returned briefly for the eleventh season.\n\nNovello is most well known for his character Father Guido Sarducci, a chain-smoking priest. Sarducci was a recurring character on \"SNL,\" but Novello also appeared as him in numerous other shows, including \"Blossom,\" \"Married... with Children,\" and \"Square Pegs.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old also voiced Vinny Santorini in the 2001 Disney film \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Schiller: one season (1979-1980)\n\nTom Schiller, 73, was a writer on \"SNL\" for 11 seasons, but only briefly appeared on screen.\n\nHe's mainly known for his comedy writing and directing, and even recently wrote for the \"SNL\" 40th anniversary special.

He served as the musical director for \"Late Night with David Letterman\" for its 11 seasons then the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" for its 23 seasons.\n\nThe 72-year-old has also released multiple albums — and he appeared on season two of \"The Masked Singer\" as the Skeleton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlan Zweibel: one season (1979-1980)\n\nAlan Zweibel was one of the original writers on the show before transitioning to being a cast member for just one. He only appeared in a few sketches.\n\nThe 72-year-old was close friends with Gilda Radner, and even wrote a book about their friendship after she passed away called \"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner — A Sort of Love Story.\" It was later adapted into an Off-Broadway play.\n\nZweibel co-wrote a film with Billy Crystal, called \"Here Today\" in 2021. Along with Crystal, it stars Tiffany Haddish, Penn Badgley, Laura Benanti, and Nyambi Nyambi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDenny Dillon: one season (1980-1981)\n\nDenny Dillon was a Tony-nominated actress before joining \"SNL\" in 1980, but only lasted for a season on the show. She had a few notable characters, including Valley girl Debbie and a neurotic customer at a hair salon, Nadine.\n\nAfter leaving, Dillon, 71, starred on HBO comedy \"Dream On\" for six seasons and voiced various characters on \"Courage the Cowardly Dog.\" Most recently she starred in the short film \"Absent Mind,\" and appeared in an episode of \"The Outsider.\" She also appeared in Halle Berry's directorial debut, \"Bruised.\"\n\nIn 2020, during an interview with Vulture, Dillon revealed that she is gay and was closeted during her \"SNL\" experience, which technically makes her the first lesbian cast member in the show's history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGilbert Gottfried: one season (1980-1981)\n\nGilbert Gottfried was a prolific comedy actor, but he didn't make much of a splash during his one season on \"SNL.\" He only had two celebrity impressions: director Roman Polanski and American politician David A. Stockman. He didn't develop his signature voice until later.\n\nThrough 2022, Gottfried was still performing stand-up and hosting the podcast called \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast,\" in which he reviewed classic TV shows and movies and interviews entertainment figures. It originally started in 2014.\n\nHe also voiced many iconic characters including Iago in the movie \"Aladdin\" (and its subsequent TV series) and Digit in \"Cyberchase.\"\n\nGottfried died in April 2022.

Rolling Stone ranked him as the second-best cast member, only behind John Belushi.
