        "text": "Students from various high schools in AISD produced the video above.\n\nAustin PBS, KLRU-TV is thrilled to be a part of a collaboration with AISD through our American Graduate work. Seventeen student filmmakers from seventeen AISD high schools tell the stories about the “champions” who have supported, challenged and encouraged them in their academic and personal journeys.\n\nThe film captures the richness and diversity of life in AISD high schools and the dedication of the teachers, coaches, families, and community members who inspire students every day. The film will be premiered at the South Lamar Alamo Drafthouse and the student filmmakers will be part of a panel discussion with moderator Hema Mullur from KEYE. We are proud that youth is helping tell the story of American Graduate and the importance of shining light on “champions.”\n\nToday’s Champion is Sarah Shaney!Sarah works as a CIS Program Manager at Eastside Memorial High School. Her nomination letter from the community said, “ Sarah is an American Graduate Champion because she does whatever it takes to help her students, from providing basic needs assistance and individual and group sessions, to success coaching to help her students stay on track with their academic goals. Sarah’s work demonstrates that meeting students where they are, taking the time to listen and understand, and tailoring the support offered to the unique circumstances of the student really can keep students from dropping out, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life.”\n\nThe Communities In Schools program at Eastside Memorial is managed by Sarah and serves 115 students. During her first year at Eastside Memorial, Sarah implemented a success coaching program at Eastside. Eighty students on Sarah’s 2014-15 caseload received success coaching three times during the school year. Volunteers met individually with students under Sarah’s direction, working with students to talk about GPAs, grades, college and career plans, and to check on progress toward meeting their goals. Sarah helps to provide students on campus with new ways to cope with stress including round-table discussion groups and a peer-to-peer mental health educator program. Sarah believes in advocating for her students both on campus and in the community. During the Texas Legislative Session earlier this year, Sarah and a group of CIS students visited the capital to talk directly to representatives about the realities of student life and the importance of CIS services. It was a great opportunity for students to be part of the conversation and Sarah really shined talking passionately about her students and her work. At a campus visit to Eastside in the spring of 2015, one of the students Sarah works with told CIS that he was planning to drop out of school because he struggled to juggle two jobs and school but that Sarah had helped him rearrange his schedule and set goals so he could stay enrolled. He said that thanks to Sarah, he would not only graduate from high school but that he also planned to apply to college next year.\n\nToday’s Champion is Mandy Stalcup!. As a CIS Program Manager at Crockett High School, Mandy provides a range of programming to support students on the campus including working with students individually, in groups, college & career exploration, with basic needs and more. Her nomination letter said, “The time Mandy spends helping her students stay focused on grades and attendance and with college and scholarship applications makes a huge difference in keeping them motivated and on track. Students are empowered when they are given support and encouragement from a caring adult.”\n\nMandy works to support students at Crockett High School by matching her programming on campus to the specific needs of the school community. One example provided of how Mandy’s work empowers students to stay in school and achieve in life is how she helped a student named Keyanna. Keyanna graduated from Crockett High School in June 2015 and she credits Mandy with helping her stay focused on keeping her grades up and also with providing assistance as she navigated scholarship and financial aid applications. All the effort Keyanna and Mandy put in paid off. Keyanna graduated with a 3.6 GPA, she was accepted to five universities, and she received several scholarships. “I don’t know where I’d be today without Mandy,” she said. Despite living all the way across town for long periods during high school, Keyanna was never late and didn’t let the obstacles she faced keep her from succeeding in school. Mandy helped her get bus passes and provided ongoing support and encouragement, reminding Keyanna of her goals and what she needed to do to stay on track. This fall, Keyanna started her college career at the University of Texas and she will be the first in her family to attend a four-year university. Mandy has kept in touch with Keyanna since graduation and continues to cheer her on.\n\nToday’s Champion is Adrian Plaster! Adrian Plaster is a teacher at Jack C. Hays High School in Buda, Texas. She teaches French and sponsors the school French club. She looks out for her students and gives them moral support. She encourages her students to try their best. “She has always been there for me and has given me advice when I most needed it. Even when I struggled in her class and it took me long hours to understand, she stood by my side and didn’t give up on me,” her nomination form said. “Learning is never easy, especially when it’s something new. Though be it as it may, there are those who still support you and don’t leave you side.”\n\nToday’s Champion is David Bowe! David Bowe is a teacher at Jack C. Hays High School in Kyle, Texas. He teaches social studies, and always makes his students a top priority. He wants to help his students any way he can. His story shows “there ARE teachers out there who DO care about them, with no real reason to. They simply care because that’s the kind of person they are,” the nomination form said. “Mr. Bowe, since the beginning of the school year, has proven that he sincerely cares for his students. He’s teaching to help them achieve something in life, to help them move forward with it and to teach them how to do so.”\n\nToday’s Champion is Deborah Moore! Deborah Moore is a mom, teacher, behavior specialist, 4-H leader and communitry activist in Kyle, Texas.

Powerful voices come from every age, every corner of the world, every gender, race and creed. Just touching one life can make all the difference in the world, and setting goals and trying to reach them using creativity and compassion rather than keeping your gifts to yourself can start a fire that burns for a long time, both in yourself and in those you serve. Being proud of being “different,” being an individual and standing up for yourself takes guts and intelligence and grit.”\n\nToday’s Champion are Communities In Schools of Central Texas AmeriCorps Members.

From there he developed a usage and maintenance policy and ran their computer room once they were able to get more computers.
