        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: Nancy Roberge-Renaud\n\nWe've been thinking about “The Baby-Sitters Club” cast. Where are they now? For this list, we'll be looking at the main characters in 1995's “The Baby-Sitters Club.” Our countdown includes Rachel Leigh Cook, Tricia Joe, Ellen Burstyn, and more!\n\nAnyone need a sitter? Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’ll be counting down our picks for the Top 10 The Baby-Sitters Club Cast: Where Are They Now?\n\nFor this list, we’ll be looking at the main characters in 1995’s “The Baby-Sitters Club”. Let’s find out what our favorite sitters have been up these past 25 years.\n\n#10: Austin O’Brien\n\nO’Brien played Mary Anne’s boyfriend in BSC, yet he was already known to audiences in 1995, after starring in “My Girl 2” and “Last Action Hero”. He did some acting work following BSC, mainly on television in “Touched By an Angel” and “Promised Land”. His last acting credit is listed as 2015 in a short film. O’Brien’s true passion lies in photography. He established a photography business, A. O’Brien Photography, in 2007. He is quite successful, doing wedding and portrait photography in Chicago and Los Angeles. He is also happily married, and has two children.\n\n#9: Ellen Burstyn\n\nBurstyn was already a well-established and accomplished actress when she took on the role of Emily Haberman (the disgruntled neighbor) in BSC. She began her voluminous acting career in 1958, and has consistently worked since, up until the present. She starred in such films as “Requiem for a Dream”, and has filled endless TV guest spots, including a multi-episode role on “House of Cards”. Burstyn already had an Oscar win under her belt in 1995, having won for 1974’s “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore”, and has since been nominated for many more awards. She continues to work, being listed for multiple projects in 2020, at 87 years old.\n\n#8: Christian Oliver\n\nOliver stole our teenage hearts in BSC as the love interest Luca with the classic 90s haircut. Born in Germany, Oliver began his American acting career as Brian Keller in “Saved By The Bell: The New Class” in 1994. Since his BSC heartthrob role, he’s continued working as an actor, appearing in a number of US as well as German productions. He’s also done some voiceover work in the gaming industry. He appeared opposite Cate Blanchett in 2006’s “The Good German,” as well as in 2008’s “Speed Racer.” Oliver continues to find work, and has appeared most recently in Amazon’s “Hunters” series. Oh, and he’s still darn handsome.\n\n#7: Zelda Harris\n\nHarris had begun her acting career in 1991, and had already appeared in Spike Lee’s “Crooklyn” prior to her role as Jessi Ramsey in BSC. She appeared in a handful of roles following the film, mainly in TV guest roles. She took a hiatus in the 2000s however, presumably to focus on her education. Harris obtained her degree from Princeton in 2007, and her Masters in Education at UCLA. Her resume boasts 6 years teaching, 10 years coaching, jazz singing, tennis, track & field, and the list goes on. She also found time for several TV roles in 2014.\n\n#6: Stacy Linn Ramsower\n\nRamsower is one of two members of the BSC who didn’t continue on in the acting realm. In fact, her entire acting career ranged only from 1991 to 1996. She appeared in “The Quick and the Dead” as well as “Tank Girl” prior to her role as Mallory Pike on BSC. Following BSC, she appeared in only one credited role in a TV movie. There isn’t much to find when it comes to her life in between then and now, other than that Ramsower hung up her acting hat, and is now a yoga instructor in Houston, Texas.\n\n#5: Tricia Joe\n\nTricia Joe is the second BSC member who didn’t on in the spotlight, as the film is her last credited appearance. In fact, Joe only has 4 acting credits on her IMDB page, from 1990 to 1995 - the most prominent role being that of Claudia Kishi in BSC. What we do know is that after her short-lived time on screen she obtained a degree in dance from Fullerton College, and studied criminal justice at California State University in Long Beach. We can only assume she’s living a happy life away from the spotlight, and that’s what counts.\n\n#4: Larisa Oleynik\n\nPerhaps one of the more familiar faces in the BSC, Larisa Oleynik was in the midst of “The Secret World of Alex Mack” fame when she starred as the hippie-esque Dawn Schafer. She went on and continued to find fame as a teen idol in the 1990s, culminating in the wildly popular “10 Things I Hate About You”, in which she played Bianca Stratford in 1999. She has kept consistently busy since her teen idol years, with a multitude of television, film and cartoon voiceover jobs. She’s appeared in such shows as “Hawaii Five-O”, “Mad Men” and “Pretty Little Liars”, and continues to act to this day.\n\n#3: Bre Blair\n\nSince playing Stacey Mcgill in BSC, Bre Blair has gone on to tackle a huge variety of roles. Blair had only one acting credit to her name when she was cast as Stacey, and has clearly never looked back from the spotlight. She’s since appeared in countless TV series and films, in smaller or guest roles. If you peruse her IMDB page, you’ll see a guest spot on most (if not all) the popular shows of the past 15 years, including “Castle”, “Two and a Half Men” and “The Flash”, among many others. Needless to say, she kept busy in the years after BSC, and continues to do so.\n\n#2: Rachael Leigh Cook\n\nAnother recognizable 90s teen face, Rachael Leigh Cook was cast as the quiet Mary Anne Spier in BSC. Cook was perhaps at the height of her fame in the teen blockbuster “She’s All That” in 1999, followed by “Josie and the Pussycats” a few years later. She has continued to work in acting, and has done much voiceover work for games such as “Kingdom Hearts” and shows such as “Robot Chicken”. She continues to book work to this day, mainly on television, where she had a recurring role in “Psych” and “Perception”.\n\n#1: Schuyler Fisk\n\nFisk was already familiar with the entertainment industry when she joined the BSC as its founder, being the daughter of actress Sissy Spacek. Her role as Kristy Thomas was definitely not her last, as she did go on to act in various projects in both film and TV. However, her main passion seems to lie in music, as she’s also collected numerous soundtrack credits. She’s a singer-songwriter, once signed to Universal Records, providing music for various projects, and has released some studio albums and EPs. Her most notable hit was the song “Paperweight”, found on the soundtrack to the film “The Last Kiss”."
