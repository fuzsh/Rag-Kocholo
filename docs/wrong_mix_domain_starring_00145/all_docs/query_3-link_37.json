        "text": "Australian violist Kathryn Lockwood leads an active and varied career as performer, teacher, and artistic director. Since moving to the United States in 1991 Kathryn has played with a virtual who’s-who in the chamber music world and captured sought-after awards in the country including the Naumburg Chamber Music Award.\n\nKathryn’s career launched straight out of graduate school at USC (CA) where she, along with three friends, formed the Pacifica Quartet. As a member of PQ she traveled the world concertizing and recording. After moving to New York in 2001 Kathryn soon claimed the viola chair of the internationally renowned Lark Quartet. Always evolving and thinking out of the box, Kathryn formed the innovative group duoJalal with percussionist and husband Yousif Sheronick.\n\nThe accolades speak volumes to Kathryn’s virtuosic ability. The Cleveland Plain Dealer proclaimed Kathryn as a “violist of exceptional talents, “…Lockwood played the vociferous viola cadenza with mahogany beauty and vivid character” and the Toronto Star wrote: “Lockwood is all slow, sensuous allure with her bowing arm one moment, a tempest of notes the next”.\n\nA violist in high demand, Kathryn has played with Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Music from Copland House, members of the Emerson Quartet and jazz legend John Patitucci.\n\nKathryn’s creative mind led her to be appointed Artistic Director, a position she still holds, of the innovative series Four Seasons in Music at the Sands Point Preserve Conservancy. This very special series presents four magical concerts annually in the stunning location of the former Guggenheim Estate with historic mansions and waterfront grounds. Each concert is a unique program of chamber music and poetry, inspired by themes throughout the year. The repertoire chosen for each concert ranges from Bach and Mozart to today’s culturally diverse composers. Each concert is roughly divided into equal thirds representing classical repertoire, new music including commissions, and world influenced music.\n\nKathryn is also the Artistic Director for the “Music@MoMA” Series. This series which has been running since 2017 is an intimate salon style chamber music series. It is hosted by a philanthropic couple in their gorgeous apartment at the Museum Tower at the MoMA on 53rd Street. Each concert is followed by a dinner party and takes the guests back to a time when chamber music was enjoyed in a chamber.\n\nKathryn is proud to announce a new position as co-artistic director where duoJalal is ensemble in residence, for the Telluride MusicFest. A festival housed in a gorgeous mountain home situated at 10,000 feet!\n\nWith duoJalal, Kathryn has recorded two albums. The first in 2010 “A different world” on Innova Records with music of Philip Glass (who extracted a viola solo from his opera “Madrigal” and adapted it for duoJalal), and commissions from Kenji Bunch, Derek Bermel and John Patitucci. In 2016, “Shadow & Light” on Bridge Records with commissions by Evan Ziporyn and Ljova.\n\nAs a member of Lark Quartet, she concertized regularly including a tour of Sweden and with a focus on new music released three CD’s on Bridge records. An “All Jennifer Higdon” CD, “Composing America” featuring a commission by Paul Moravec; and “A Farewell Celebration” featuring all new commissions by John Harbison, Kenji Bunch, Andrew Waggoner and Anna Weesner. Kathryn also recorded with Lark, “Klap Ur Handz” on Endeavor Records with a new commission by Daniel Bernard Roumain “DBR”.\n\nIn 2005 Kathryn released a solo recital CD of Viola Music by Inessa Zaretsky, “Fireoptics”, about which Strad declared “Lockwood is absolutely inside the music’s idiom finding appropriate tonal shadings”.\n\nAs an original member of Pacifica Quartet, Kathryn performed at Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall, Ravinia’s Bennett Gordon Hall, Corcoran Gallery, St. Lawrence Center, and University of Thessaloniki / Greece. She was heard live on NPR’s Performance Today during a two week residency of daily broadcasts and collaborated with violist Michael Tree on an all Dvorak CD released by Cedille Records.\n\nKathryn is currently on faculty at the John Cali School of Music at Montclair State University, previously serving on the faculty at University of Massachusetts/Amherst, Rutgers University in NJ, Northwestern University, University of Chicago, Music Institute of Chicago, and National Music Camp in Australia.
