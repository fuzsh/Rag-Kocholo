More information on the government's subcontracting program can be found under the Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 19.7.\n\nOSDBU is proud to present the Fiscal Year 2024 Subcontracting Directory. This directory is published as a marketing aid for small businesses, to participate in DOT procurements as subcontractors. In this directory, you will find listings of major DOT prime contractors with approved subcontracting plans. It identifies the prime contractors' name and address, company subcontracting liaison representative and telephone numbers and description of the project or items to be subcontracted. Contact should be made with the company's subcontracting liaison representative who has knowledge of the contractor's subcontracting plan and goals. This person can advise you on how your firm can join their subcontracting vendor's team.\n\nAll of us at OSDBU wish you success in your business endeavors.\n\nFY2024 Subcontracting Directory"
