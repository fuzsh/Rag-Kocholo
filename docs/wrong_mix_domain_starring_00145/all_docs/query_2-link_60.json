It was Paul Simon’s 1987 Graceland album that introduced Ladysmith Black Mambazo to the world. The late former South African President Nelson Mandela designated the group “South Africa’s cultural ambassadors to the world,” a title the members carry with them with the highest honor. In 2018 the group received not one but two Grammy Award nominations for two separate albums, a first in the history of World Music. These two nominations brought their career total to 19 Grammy award nominations. One of these albums, Shaka Zulu Revisited, won Best World Music Album. This was the group’s fifth Grammy win, the most for any world music group.\n\nLadysmith Black Mambazo has performed for millions of people, singing a message of peace, love, and harmony. With their 2024 release, Soothe My Soul…Songs From Our South African Church, the group puts their own spin on gospel music.\n\nShow time: 7:30 PM, doors 6:30 PM\n\nTickets: $47.25 gen, $68.25 gold circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.kuumbwajazz.org\n\nView Event →\n\nPaul Thorn and Band\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nSchoolcraft and Murray open\n\nPaul Thorn has created an innovative and impressive career, pleasing crowds with his muscular brand of roots music – bluesy, rocking and thoroughly Southern American, yet also speaking universal truths. Among those who value originality, inspiration, eccentricity and character – as well as talent that hovers somewhere on the outskirts of genius, the story of Paul Thorn is already familiar. Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, raised among the same spirits (and some of the actual people) who nurtured the young Elvis generations before, Paul Thorn has rambled down back roads and jumped out of airplanes, worked for years in a furniture factory, battled four-time world champion boxer Roberto Duran on national television, performed on stages with Bonnie Raitt, Mark Knopfler, Sting, and John Prine among many others, and made some of the most emotionally restless yet fully accessible music of our time. He’s also appeared on major television shows, received numerous National Public Radio features and charted multiple times on the Billboard Top 100 and Americana Radio Charts.\n\nPaul’s latest release, “Never Too Late To Call,” is seven years in the making and features all original material. The CD was recorded at Sam Phillips Studio in Memphis and produced and engineered by Grammy winning wunderkind Matt Ross-Spang.\n\nSchoolcraft and Murray make acoustic music brimming with groove, harmony and wit. Their groove makes you move, their harmony makes you feel, and their wit makes you think. (If thinking is your thing.) Their original take blends the best of their many heroes: Lyle Lovett, Carole King, Santana, Robbie Fulks, The Allman Brothers, Steely Dan, Babyface, Dawes and Flight of the Conchords. They are the Milk Carton Kids (with whiskey in the milk) The Everly Brothers meet Tenacious D. On stage, they add their not so secret weapon to the music... charisma! That's right... we said it...charisma. Years of experience... playing, singing, hosting, entertaining... These guys are, flat out, fun.\n\nShow time: 7:30 PM, doors 6:30 PM\n\nTickets: $32 gen, $45 gold circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.snazzyproductions.com\n\nArtists website: www.paulthorn.com\n\nArtists website: www.schoolcraftandmurray.com\n\nView Event →\n\nPreservation Hall Jazz Band\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nAt a moment when musical streams are crossing with unprecedented frequency, it’s crucial to remember that throughout its history, New Orleans has been the point at which sounds and cultures from around the world converge, mingle, and resurface, transformed by the Crescent City’s inimitable spirit and joie de vivre. Nowhere is that idea more vividly embodied than in the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, which has held the torch of New Orleans music aloft for more than 60 years, all the while carrying it enthusiastically forward as a reminder that the history they were founded to preserve is a vibrantly living history.\n\nPreservation Hall Jazz Band marches that tradition forward once again on So It Is. The album redefines what New Orleans music means today by tapping into a sonic continuum that stretches back to the city’s Afro-Cuban roots, through its common ancestry with the Afrobeat of Fela Kuti the Fire Music of Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane, and forward to cutting-edge artists with whom the Preservation Hall Jazz Band have shared festival stages from Coachella to Newport, including legends like Stevie Wonder, Elvis Costello, Beck, The Foo Fighters, My Morning Jacket, and the Black Keys.\n\nShow time: 7:30 PM, doors 6:30 PM\n\nTickets: $57.75 gen, $73 gold circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.kuumbwajazz.org\n\nView Event →\n\nOcean Film Festival World Tour\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nAt the Ocean Film Festival World Tour our vision is to inspire you to explore, respect, enjoy, and protect our oceans.

She delivers vulnerable songs with a distinctive warble informed by vintage country. Her early, spare, acoustic songs grew increasingly lush and dramatic across her several albums. Olsen debuted with the reverb-heavy solo indie folk of 2010's Strange Cacti, expanding to an alt-country power trio for her third album, 2014's Burn Your Fire for No Witness, her Billboard 200 debut. Two years later, My Woman reached a career-high number 47 on the chart. While maintaining an intimate character and a haunting sound reinforced by stylized echo, Olsen recorded 2019's All Mirrors with a 14-piece orchestra. The follow-up, 2020's Whole New Mess, offered an overhauled solo version of All Mirrors that included a pair of original songs. Inspired by both love and loss tied up in coming out as queer, her sixth studio album, Big Time, followed in 2022.\n\nShe has performed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Austin City Limits TV, and has been profiled in The New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Pitchfork, to name a few.

On her landmark 1967album, Wildflowers, she curated a stunning collection featuring originals alongside songs by not-yet household names such as Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen, and adventurous selections by Jacques Brel and Francesco Landini. Her discerning palette, and her literary gifts, have enabled her to evolve into a poetic, storyteller songwriter. Now, in her 6th decade as a singer and songwriter, Judy is experiencing a profound level of growth and prolific creativity.\n\nThe cultural treasure’s 55th release, Spellbound, which came out on February 25, 2022, finds Judy enjoying an artistic renaissance. The 13 song album is a special entry in her oeuvre. It marks the first time ever she wrote all the songs on one of her albums. It features 12 new recently-written modern folk songs, and a bonus track of her evergreen, “The Blizzard.” Spellbound is an introspective and impressionistic album. It unfolds as if Judy curated a museum exhibit of her life, and welcomed us into a retrospective of her most formative moments, some big and public, and some intensely personal and intimate.\n\nShow time: 7:30 PM, doors 6:30 PM\n\nTickets: start at $39.50\n\nAdvance tickets: www.ticketmaster.com\n\nArtists website: www.judycollins.com\n\nYouTube: www.youtube.com\n\nView Event →\n\nMarcos Valle\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nAzymuth and Brainstory\n\nMarcos Valle is the Renaissance man of Brazilian pop, a singer/songwriter/producer who has straddled the music world from the early days of the bossa nova craze well into the fusion-soaked sound of '80s MPB and into the 21st century. His second album, 1965's O Compositor e o Cantor, is widely considered among the era's most important. Its hit single, \"Samba de Verão,\" is one of the most covered songs in Brazilian music history.\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro in 1943, Valle studied classical music as a child but listened to many different types of music, especially jazz. He began writing songs with his brother Paulo Sérgio; Marcos was the tune writer, Paulo the lyricist. In the early '60s, and after Tamba Triohad a hit with his \"Sonho de Maria,\" Valle was named Brazil's Leading Composer of the Year at the age of 19. A recording contract soon followed, and in 1964 he released his first album, Samba Demais, for EMI Brazil. A tour with Sergio Mendes & Brasil '65 the following year got him his first show business connections in America (via Merv Griffin), and in 1966, Walter Wanderley took Valle's song \"So Nice (Summer Samba)\" into the U.S. Top 40. Valle soon earned his own American contract, and in 1967, Warner Bros. released the instrumentals album Braziliance! One year later, his Verve debut, Samba '68, became a Brazilian classic thanks to simple, infectious pop songs like \"Batucada,\" \"Chup, Chup, I Got Away,\" and \"Crickets Sing for Anamaria\" (all of which featured spot-on harmony vocals by his wife Anamaria).\n\nDespite the incredible promise revealed by Samba '68, it was his last American album to date. That same year, the Brazilian-only Viola Enluarada became a big hit in South America, thanks in part to the title track (with vocals by a young Milton Nascimento). The rock & roll era that had already influenced tropicalistas like Os Mutantes, Caetano Veloso, and Gilberto Gil soon began inspiring Valle as well. With albums like the irresistible 1971 classic Garra, he moved away from native Brazilian forms like the bossa nova and samba and into a rock-influenced sound that played up groove-heavy bass and smooth funk even while courting his amazing melodic sense.\n\nDuring the late '80s, the rare-groove craze centered in London resurrected and relentlessly compiled dozens of crucial, overlooked tracks from the '60s and '70s, including Valle's \"Crickets Sing for Anamaria.\" In 1995, the British Mr. Bongo label released a two-volume series (The Essential Marcos Valle) dedicated to his work. One year later, Valle appeared on the jam session compilation Friends from Rio, and in 1998 he returned with a new album, Nova Bossa Nova. In 2018 Far Outremastered and reissued Nova Bossa Nova in a 20th anniversary edition. In June of 2019 at age 76, Valle released Sempre for Far Out. Its sound was a retro mix of boogie, disco, cosmic samba, and smooth jazz-funk grafted onto socially conscious lyrics that recalled the lyric style of his progressive early-'70s recordings. Guests on the date included Azymuth's bassist Alex Malheiros, trumpeter Jesse Sadoc, and percussionist Armando Marcal.\n\nValle returned to the studio almost immediately and released Cinzento in March of 2020 for Deck in Brazil and Light in the Attic in the U.S. It featured collaborations with Moreno Veloso (\"Redescobrir\"), Bem Gil (\"Protect Yourself\"), Kassin (\"Distant Places\"), Zélia Duncan (\"Rastros Raros\"), Domênico Lancelotti (\"Pelo Sim, Pelo Não\"), and rapper Emicid on the title track. Also appearing that spring, this time from English label Far Out, was a 2020 reissue of Valle's 1972 soundtrack Fly Cruzeiro, for which he was backed by Brazilian jazz-funk fusion trio Azymuth (who took their name from one of his songs) in a set that mixed bossa, samba, synth-driven funk, and jazz fusion.\n\nA year earlier, Valle and his wife, singer Patricia Alvi, traveled to Los Angeles to work with Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad for their Jazz Is Dead label project. Though Valle had lived and worked there decades earlier, he had never recorded his own music. Using his catalog as a production guide, collaborators encouraged an album of new songs that crisscrossed his career-long obsessions with samba, bossa, MPB, and psychedelic funk. Valle arrived with a briefcase full of original material; he composed even more on the spot in the recording studio. Using vintage instruments and keyboards, the sessions plotted a 21st century overview of Valle's musical evolution. It included a duet with Alvi on the breezy \"Viajando por Aí.\" In keeping with the Jazz Is Dead label's cataloging aesthetic, the set was titled Marcos Valle JID 003, and issued in August of 2020. A 2021 single saw Valle collaborating with Ivan Lins and Joyce on the gentle \"Casa Que Era Minha.\" ~ John Bush\n\nShow time: 7:30 PM, doors 6:30 PM\n\nTickets: $43.05 Gen, $58.80 Gold Circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.eventbrite.com\n\nArtists website: www.mrbongo.bandcamp.com\n\nView Event →\n\nAllah-Las\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nBio | Credit: Jason Woodbury\n\nAllah-Las\n\nZuma 85\n\nAre you tired of that same old song? Tune into any alt-rock robo-jock frequency on the FM dial and you’ll know what I mean. Somewhere along the way, nostalgia curdled, and it feels like we’re doomed to hear the same boring souls for eternity. But don’t ask California sons Allah-Las—they wouldn’t know a thing about it. “The Stuff,” which opens the band’s fifth LP, Zuma 85, lays it out: “I don’t listen to the radio/They keep playing that song again/And the deejay’s a computer.” As the glammy, electronic strut of the song indicates, Zuma 85 signals the start of a new era for Allah-Las, and finds the band reinventing itself in defiance of the algorithmic categorization and robotic sterility. Recorded in the midst of the shift from the Old World to whatever branch of reality we’re on now, it’s a return, too: The album will be released via their own label, Calico Discos, in partnership with Innovative Leisure, which released early defining statements like Allah-Las (2012) and Worship The Sun (2014). For the last 15 years, Allah-Las have alchemically melded surf rock washes with folk rock jangle and rock, building up their lauded music podcast, Reverberation Radio, and record label, Calico Discos, in the process. But a lot has changed since Matthew Correia (drums/vocals), Spencer Dunham (bass, guitar, vocals), Miles Michaud (guitar, organ, vocals), and Pedrum Siadatian (guitar, synth, vocals) first bonded over psych rock vinyl in the back room at Amoeba Records in the late aughts. Zuma 85 finds the quartet facing a new world with a wealth of new sounds, drawing from an eclectic mix of progressive rock, prog, kosmische, and Eno-esque art rock, scuzzy Royal Trux riffs, and detouring into tones and textures that call to mind ‘90s and 2000s pop.\n\nThe album was born, like so much else these days, out of the downtime of 2020-2022. For most of the band’s existence, Allah-Las adhered to a year to album year/tour year schedule, logging serious hours on the road. When the shutdown of 2020 put everything on hold, it opened up space for each member to focus on their own lives and interests, and time to re-envision what creative processes could look like.\n\nShow time: 8:00 PM, doors 7:00 PM\n\nTickets: $37.80\n\nAdvance tickets: www.eventbrite.com\n\nView Event →\n\nSanta Cruz Comedy Festival Rio Theatre : Invasion of the Comedy Headliners\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nComedians from HBO, Netflix, Comedy Central and More!\n\nThe 11th Annual Santa Cruz Comedy Festival is invading the Rio Theatre with three of the funniest comedians in America.

China Forbes – 30th Anniversary Tour\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nIn 1994 in his hometown of Portland, Oregon, Thomas Lauderdale was working in local politics, attending every political fundraiser under the sun…but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming and lackluster. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world – crossing genres of classical, jazz, and old-fashioned pop – and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the “little orchestra” Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education, and parks. One year later, Lauderdale called China Forbes, a Harvard classmate who was living in New York City, and asked her to join Pink Martini as the lead singer, and collaborator. Their first song “Sympathique (Je ne veux pas travailler)” became an overnight sensation in France, was nominated for “Song of the Year” at France’s Victoires de la Musique Awards and is still the band’s number one song. Says Lauderdale, “We’re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent a broader, more inclusive America…the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world…composed of people of every country, every language, every religion.” Featuring a dozen musicians, with songs in 25 languages, Pink Martini performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages on six continents. After making its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998, the band has gone on to play with more than 50 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center, the San Francisco Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, and the BBC Concert Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall in London. In 2014, Pink Martini was inducted into both the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame and the Oregon Music Hall of Fame. Pink Martini has released 11 studio albums on its own independent label Heinz Records (named after Lauderdale’s dog), selling over 3 million albums worldwide. In 2019, the band released two EPs featuring the vocals of Pink Martini’s newest members Jimmie Herrod and Edna Vazquez. Both vocalists have toured with the band for the past year and are officially part of the group with the release of Herrod’s EP Tomorrow and Vaquez’s Besame Mucho, both of which were co-produced by Thomas Lauderdale and China Forbes. In 2024 the band is celebrating its 30th anniversary.\n\nShow time: 7:30 PM, doors 6:30 PM\n\nTickets: $68.25 Gen, $99.75 Gold Circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.kuumbwajazz.org\n\nView Event →\n\nAn Evening of Comedy with Trae Crowder\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nShow time: 8:00 PM, doors 7:00 PM\n\nTickets: $25 Gen, $45 Gold Circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.etix.com\n\nView Event →\n\nJake Shimabukuro\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nJake returns to the Rio Theatre with the \"Grateful\" tour, in celebration of his latest CD!\n\nShow time: 8:00 PM, doors 7:00 PM\n\nTickets: $40 gen, $60 gold circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.pulseproductions.net\n\nArtists website: www.jakeshimabukuro.com\n\nView Event →\n\nAnthony Jeselnik\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\n\"Hurray!

This first collection in seven years, out August 20, 2021 on New West Records, spotlights a seasoned tunesmith in peak form as he turns toward reflection (“Vaquero”) and revelation ( closer “Blackberry Winter”). Familiar foundations guide the journey. “There’s a definite Los Angeles vibe to this record,” McMurtry says. “The ghost of Warren Zevon seems to be stomping around among the guitar tracks. Don’t know how he got in there. He never signed on for work for hire.”\n\nThe Horses and the Hounds is a reunion of sorts. McMurtry recorded the new album with legendary producer Ross Hogarth (John Fogerty, Van Halen, Keb’ Mo’) at Jackson Browne’s Groovemaster’s in Santa Monica, California, a world class studio that has housed such legends as Bob Dylan (2012’s Tempest) and David Crosby (2016’s Lighthouse) as well as Browne himself for I’m Alive (1993) and New Found Glory, Coming Home (2006). McMurtry and Hogarth first worked together 30 years ago, when Hogarth was a recording engineer in the employ of John Mellencamp at Mellencamp’s own Belmont Studios near Bloomington, Indiana. Hogarth recorded McMurtry’s first two albums, Too Long in the\n\nWasteland and Candyland, for Columbia Records and later mixed McMurtry’s first self-produced album, Saint Mary of the Woods, for Sugar Hill Records. Another veteran of those three releases, guitarist David Grissom (Joe Ely, John Mellencamp, Dixie Chicks), returns with some of his finest work. Accordingly, the new collection marks another upward trajectory: The Horses and the Hounds will be McMurtry’s debut album on genre-defining Americana record label New West Records (Steve Earle, Rodney Crowell, Lucinda Williams, John Hiatt, Aaron Lee Tasjan, Buddy Miller, dozens more).\n\nShow time: 8:00 PM, doors 7:00 PM\n\nTickets: $34.65\n\nAdvance tickets: www.eventbrite.com\n\nView Event →\n\nCowboy Junkies - SOLD OUT\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\n\"Hurray!

It was a time of contemplation and transformation, a time to slow down. What transpired was what the artist considers a gradual union of reconnection and growth. “I was writing songs the way that I used to when I was a kid. It was more like therapy, just sitting down on my bed and writing about what I was feeling. It sounds so simple but I had really gotten away from that.” Dozens of songs followed and a narrative became clear. “It all happened very organically. I wasn’t ambitious. There weren’t any difficulties like most of my other records have had. This one just sort of appeared and seemed to know exactly what it needed to be.”\n\nThe Art of Forgetting is a pivotal release for Rose––an artist whose wit and satirical storytelling have made them a name in the indie music scene. It’s an album teeming with raw, intense emotion. Layers of vocal arrangements from Balkan-influenced yawps to Gregorian autotune choirs, acoustic instrumentation chopped and mangled like a glitching memory, and dreamlike synths push and pull to create a hugely dynamic soundscape. Lyrically, the album includes the type of confessional honesty we’ve only caught glimpses of in Rose’s previous work. “I’ve shied away from being very confessional in the past because I’ve always felt that other artists have already carved out that path and are very good at it. I’m a theater kid, I love the drama.

She loves the world and wears her heart on her sleeve, but she might eat it before you get to thinking it belongs to you.\n\nWild Creatures pulls together some high points of feral joy from twenty-one years of solo work by Neko Case. The Virginian marked Neko’s debut as a solo artist in 1997. She delved into darkness in 2000 with Furnace Room Lullaby, scrawled Blacklisted in 2004 and recorded The Tigers Have Spoken live the same year. In 2006, she dreamed Fox Confessor Brings the Flood, and in 2009 unleashed Middle Cyclone. She plumbed her own life in 2013 for The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You, and raised hell in 2018 with Hell-On. Now in her third decade of recording under her own name, she’s just getting started.\n\nIs there another songwriter so fearless and inventive? Bending decades of pop music into new shapes, she wields her voice like a kiss and her metaphors like a baseball bat. She has cast the fishing net of her career wide—from Seattle and Vancouver to Chicago and Stockholm, setting up her home base on a farm in New England.\n\nGathering power year after year, Neko sings with the fierce abandon of a newborn infant crying in a basket in the woods. Since escaping the labels of country and Americana, the gorgeous train-whistle vocals of her early career sit submerged in her later style, where their ghost can appear any minute. When her voice jumps an octave, it’s almost visible, like sparks at night. “I never knew where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do with my voice,” she says, “but I just wanted to do it so bad.”\n\nThe world tends to love women singer-songwriters most when they’re wounded and helpless. Neko’s music spans a broader spectrum, from longing to malice. Her lyrics evoke worlds, imagining a woman pilot ready to die, a serial killer, a murdered child, and a tornado, just for starters. Is there any perspective she can’t write a song from or about? “I am a man,” she sings. “I am the man in the fucking moon.”\n\nShow time: 8:00 PM, doors 7:00 PM\n\nTickets: $53.03\n\nAdvance tickets: www.eventbrite.com\n\nView Event →\n\nTOP DOG Film Festival SOLD OUT\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSupporting the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter\n\nThe much anticipated Top Dog Film Festival returns for another year, promising joy, inspiration, and a whole lot of canine magic to audiences across Australia.

We prefer cash, but will accept cards as well!\"\n\nLast November in London, Cat Power took the stage at Royal Albert Hall and delivered a song-for-song recreation of one of the most fabled and transformative live sets of all time. Held at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in May 1966—but long known as the “Royal Albert Hall Concert” due to a mislabeled bootleg—the original performance saw Bob Dylan switching from acoustic to electric midway through the show, drawing ire from an audience of folk purists and forever altering the course of rock-and-roll. In her own rendition of that historic night, the artist otherwise known as Chan Marshall inhabited each song with equal parts conviction and grace and a palpable sense of protectiveness, ultimately transposing the anarchic tension of Dylan’s set with a warm and luminous joy. Now captured on the live album Cat Power Sings Dylan: The 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concert, Marshall’s spellbinding performance both lovingly honors her hero’s imprint on history and brings a stunning new vitality to many of his most revered songs.\n\nA singularly gifted song interpreter whose catalog includes three acclaimed covers albums (2000’s The Covers Record, 2008’s Jukebox, 2022’s Covers), Marshall holds an especially strong affinity for the songwriter-poet. “More than the work of any other songwriter, Dylan’s songs have spoken to me, and inspired me since i first began hearing them at 5 years old,” said Marshall. Like the original concert (and all of Dylan’s 1966 world tour), Marshall kept the first half of her set entirely acoustic, then went electric for the second half with the help of a full band: guitarist Arsun Sorrenti, bassist Erik Paparozzi, multi-instrumentalists Aaron Embry (harmonica, piano) and Jordan Summers (organ, Wurlitzer), and drummer Josh Adams. “I knew that when representing a performance that changed the rock-and-roll landscape forever, I needed to be very serious about it,” she says. “Although ‘serious’ feels like a small word for how deeply immersed I felt.”\n\nShow time: 8:00 PM, doors 7:00 PM\n\nTickets: $68.25 Gen, $89.25 Gold Circle\n\nAdvance tickets: www.eventbrite.com\n\nArtists website: www.folkyeah.com\n\nView Event →\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Cows\n\nThe Rio Theatre present protocol : masks are highly encouraged except when eating or drinking\n\nPlease read entire Rio Theatre Covid19 Protocols\n\nwith Patrick O.
