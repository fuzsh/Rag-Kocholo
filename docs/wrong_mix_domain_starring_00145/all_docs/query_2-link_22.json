[More]\n\nDirected By: Nelson Shin\n\n#121\n\nAdjusted Score: 69531%\n\nCritics Consensus: Sci-fi parodies like these usually struggle to work, but Buckaroo Banzai succeeds through total devotion to its own lunacy.\n\nSynopsis: Buckaroo Banzai is caught with his trusted allies, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, in a battle to the death between evil...

Richter\n\n#120\n\nTop Gun (1986) 57%\n\n#120\n\nAdjusted Score: 64880%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aerial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren't in the air.\n\nSynopsis: The Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School is where the best of the best train to refine their elite flying...
