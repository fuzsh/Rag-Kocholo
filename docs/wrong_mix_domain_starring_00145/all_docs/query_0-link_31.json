He details the parties they went to, the time Edward drove them to Guitar Center to buy guitar stringsâ¦ in his Lamborghini, and what he thinks may have severed their close friendship in 2003, and the sadness he feels about that to this day.\n\nAND NOW thereâs a Tonechaser audio book available where you can HEAR the actual conversations between Steve & Edward Van Halen! 30 hours!

She was a rock n roller long before she ever graced the silver screen or Broadway stage! In fact, it was her incredible singing that landed her the award-winning role of Patsy Cline in Coal Minerâs Daughter alongside Sissy Spacek, and an in-person audition for the part in front of the legendary Loretta Lynn herself. Beverly recounts her days on the road with Rompinâ Ronnie Hawkins & The Hawks, and explains how that led to Coal Minerâs Daughter which in turn led to Vacation. She remembers getting a call from Doug Ellin to make a one-off cameo appearance on HBOâs Entourage, and how that quickly turned into a recurring character. Plus, Beverly reveals her upcoming plans to make a music docu-series!\n\nÂ\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\n\nTikTok: @ChrisJericho\n\nInstagram: @talkisjericho @chrisjerichofozzy\n\nTwitter: @TalkIsJericho @IAmJericho\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisJerichoFozzy\n\nWebsite: https://www.webisjericho.com/\n\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

He shares the story (and pitch to Jimmy Jacobs) behind his initial vignettes and gimmick, and explains how a short-lived telesales job, a few words from Eric Young, and a lesson in songwriting from Queen solidified his act. He talks about the text exchange with TNA that changed his life, how a couple of very well-placed billboards outside the Hydro in Glasgow may have led to his recent NXT appearance, and why being forced to sit home for 2 years during the pandemic ultimately saved his wrestling career. Joe has tales about wrestling Kurt Angle, cutting promos with Shawn Michaels, having a hit song on the charts thanks to Matt Cardona, how heâs come to main event the TNA Slammiversary PPV with Moose, and why he is convinced that he will find himself in the ring with John Cena next year.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\n\nTikTok: @ChrisJericho\n\nInstagram: @talkisjericho @chrisjerichofozzy\n\nTwitter: @TalkIsJericho @IAmJericho\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisJerichoFozzy\n\nWebsite: https://www.webisjericho.com/\n\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Dani wrestled Nepalâs first-ever womenâs professional wrestler, Baghawait Unika at 5,600 meters in a homemade wrestling ring carried up the mountain on a helicopter! Thatâs roughly 18,300 feet or 3.4 miles ABOVE sea level! Itâs higher than Mt. Everest base camp which is why they chose that location. Dani details the entire story from her initial invitation from Unika to her 22-hour journey to Kathmandu, Nepal to her harrowing flights in and out of the worldâs most dangerous airport in the mountain town of Lukla! She explains what it was like to wrestle on uneven, rocky ground with very little oxygen, how she overcame the language barrier with her opponent, and the unbelievable reason why she had to overdub her promo once she got back to the States.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\n\nTikTok: @ChrisJericho\n\nInstagram: @talkisjericho @chrisjerichofozzy\n\nTwitter: @TalkIsJericho @IAmJericho\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisJerichoFozzy\n\nWebsite: https://www.webisjericho.com/\n\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
