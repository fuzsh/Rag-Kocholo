No matter which level of membership the ceremony is for, a well rehearsed and carried out ceremony makes all of the difference to those the ceremony is meant for.\n\nCallout Ceremony Script (download)\n\nPre-Ordeal Ceremony Script (Password is the Admonition) (download)\n\nOrdeal Ceremony Script (Password is the Admonition) download\n\nBrotherhood Ceremony Script (Password is the answer to Have you seen the Arrow?) download\n\nVigil Honor Ceremony Script (Password is the Vigil Watchwords) download\n\nCeremonial Handbook (Password is the Admonition) download\n\nSpirit of the Arrow Booklets (Password is the Admonition) download\n\nLenape Dictionary download\n\nLodge Orientation Guide (Password is the Admonition) download\n\nGuide to Inductions Part 1 (Password is the Admonition) download\n\nGuide to Inductions Part 2 (Password is the answer to Have you seen the Arrow?) download\n\nHistory\n\nOur Lodge was founded in 1938 and is affiliated with Bay Area Council #574. The English translation of Wihinipa Hinsa is a phrase derived from the language of the Dakota Nation. It means \"Bay Sunrise\" which appropriately symbolizes the dawning of a new day, brighter opportunities, a higher vision, and the cheerful spirit forever burning in the hearts and wills of true arrowman.\n\nOur Lodge totem is the Sun Rising from the purifying water of the bay.\n\nIn 1955, Camp Karankawa was opened, offering a well-located camp consisting of 450 acres of heavily forested land, ideally suited to the needs of Scouting.\n\nThe next few years saw the physical development of the camp's facilities. In 1955, it was decided to build an Ordeal Ring to meet the requirements of the Order's ceremonies. A site was selected on the banks of the San Bernard River. It was reached by following a trail from the chapel area, winding along the banks of the San Bernard, crossing a temporary bridge and finally climbing a hill to enter the ceremonial area.\n\nThe altar was constructed of stones and a plaque was laid. This ceremonial area served the Lodge for the next 40 years. The temporary bridge ultimately required relocation. Over the years the Brazos River underwent several floods. Each flood required extensive work in removing sand and debris from the Ordeal Ring. The site was lost completely for about a three year period in the mid 1980's, after a very severe flood of the San Bernard River. In the late 1980's it was decided that something needed to be done about the temporary bridge. Each flood had continued to erode the banks to a point of becoming hazardous.\n\nA plan was put forth by the Lodge to construct a new suspension bridge. Different ideas were discussed in raising the necessary capital to complete the project. One of which was to sell each of the planks on the bridge and have the names of the donor inscribed on them. Finally the Council Executive Board was approached and money was set aside for its construction. Work began on the new bridge, but a problem immediately arose, it was impossible to get the needed heavy equipment to the site to complete the project.\n\nThese efforts were finally abandoned. It became increasingly necessary to make a decision on the future of the ring. In late 1994, a site was chosen for construction of a new Ceremonial Ring. Ideas were discussed and a decision was made to move forward with its construction. Through the efforts of several people, and donations of materials, the need for raising capital became unnecessary. During the summer of 1995 several work days were held, and the new ring was constructed. It was made of cement planks that had been donated to the Lodge. These planks were then covered with native stone. Finally the plaque from the old altar was moved to the new site and installed. During the construction phase of the new altar, the permanent smug pots, which had been installed years ago at the old altar were moved and relocated.\n\nDuring the Fall Fellowship in September of 1995, dedication ceremonies were held at the new Ordeal Ceremonial Ring. All ex-Lodge Chiefs and Advisors were invited to attend.\n\nAwards\n\nWould you like to honor an Arrowmen for their outstanding service to the lodge? Award nomination forms can be found here.\n\nOA Triple Crown Award\n\nThe OA Triple Crown has always recognized outstanding outdoorsmen who take the initiative to attend not one, but three high adventure bases through the Order of the Arrowâ€™s programs. Members seeking to achieve the new OA Triple Crown Award can complete any three of the five OAHA programs as long as they do so at three separate bases. These Arrowmen are also expected to give a presentation about their experiences at a lodge or section event encouraging others to participate. Afterwards, they should submit an OA Triple Crown Application which will be made available later this year. After verifying attendance, the Arrowmen will receive a patch set and a certificate signed by the national officers recognizing this accomplishment. The patch set will consist of a universal center patch surrounded by three \"rockers\" to signify the three programs completed. For more information, please click here.\n\nFounder's Award\n\nThe Founder's Award was created by the National Order of the Arrow to honor and recognize Lodge Arrowmen who have given outstanding service to the lodge. The award is reserved for an Arrowman who demonstrates to fellow Arrowmen that he or she memorializes in his or her everyday life the spirit achievement as described by founder E. Urner Goodman. The award is a handsome bronze medallion bearing the likeness of E. Urner Goodman and Carroll A. Edson, with wooden base and brass plate suitable for engraving. The award is suitable for display at home, or the office. Also available is the Founder's Award arrow ribbon, similar to the universal arrow ribbon, except that it has a gold colored arrow suspended from the red ribbon. Lodges may petition the National Order of the Arrow Committee to present up to two awards annually, based on Lodge membership. If the Lodge presents more than one award, one must be to a youth under the age of 21.\n\n2017 - Youth - Trevor Smith, Adult - Hank Howard\n\n2018 - Youth - Alan Jones, Adult - Roger Hernandez\n\n2019 -\n\n2020 - Youth, Christian Dadd, Adult - Jeffery Dadd\n\nChief's Award\n\nThe Chief's Award was created to recognize Arrowmen throughout the year for their hard work and service to the Lodge through their dedication to a specific task. At the close of each year, the Chief may select individuals whose work extended above and beyond the call of duty, and who truly live up to the high ideals set for all members of the Order. The main recipients as chosen at the end of the year are awarded a plaque to recognize both their outstanding service and their accomplishments. Because the award is independently selected, awarded, and funded by the chief, he may present as many as he feels appropriate, within reason. No Arrowmen may receive the award more than once from the same Chief, and no awards need to be presented should the Chief not see fit to do so.\n\n2017 - Youth - Caleb Kelley, Adult - Van Keeping\n\n2018 - Youth - Alan Jones, Adult - Anthony Lusk\n\n2019 - Youth - Caleb Quarto, Adult - Roger Hernandez\n\n2020 - Youth - Kevin Keeping, Adult - Joel Gutierrez\n\nCliff Alexander Chapter Service Award\n\n2017 - The Woapossum Chapter\n\n2018 - N/A\n\n2019 - N/A\n\n2020 - N/A\n\nCharles Chipman Service Award\n\n2017 - N/A\n\n2018 - Youth - Caleb Quarto, Adult - Rick Wahlquist\n\n2019 - N/A\n\n2020 - Youth, Caleb Quarto, Adult, Anthony Lusk\n\nLinks\n\nNational Order of the Arrow\n\nSouthern Region Order of the Arrow\n\nSouthern Region Facebook\n\nSouthern Region Twitter\n\nJumpStart for New Arrowmen\n\nOA High Adventure\n\nOA Trading Post\n\nLodge Leadership Development\n\nTraining\n\nOA LodgeMaster\n\nOA Digital Archive\n\nOA History\n\nNational OA Endowment\n\nNational Boy Scouts of America web site"
