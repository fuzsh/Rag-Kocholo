        "text": "The ability to listen is a key component to our society. Listening is the very first language skill we develop, before speaking, reading or writing. In addition, we use our listening skills more than any other language skill, listening to the equivalent to a book each day. However, despite the fact that listening is the first and most frequent language skill we possess, very few people understand and excel at listening. As a result of poor listening, we suffer from misconceptions, mistakes, and misdiagnoses, which in turn leads to mistrust in our society. This begins with our failure to listen intrapersonally-understanding one’s self. It continues through our interpersonal relationships-understanding our friends, family and partners. And, as a society, we often fail to reach understanding with each other, especially those who are different from ourselves, primarily due to a lack of listening.\n\nThis course examines the essential questions of the human condition, as it relates to listening. How do we see ourselves in relation to others and what role does listening play in shaping those perceptions? How do we listen to natural world around us? How does listening shape the way we develop and express our values? This class examines the complex relationship between humans, communication, technology and listening. This course is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing from psychology, sociology and communication studies. Students will explore these themes through participatory discussions, observational analysis, self-reflections and evaluation. Students will build concrete skills that will help support and promote effective listening skills.\n\nCourse: IDS2935\n\nClass Number: 17875\n\nInstructor: Lisa Athearn\n\nCourse: IDH2952\n\nClass Number: 29072\n\nDay/Period: T/10\n\nInstructor: Melissa Johnson\n\nFins up, Honors Parrotheads! It's 5:00 somewhere - or in this case, 5:10pm in LIT 119.\n\nThrough this course, we will look at the vast musical catalog of one James William Buffett, starting with A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean (1973) all the way through Equal Strain on All Parts (2023, released posthumously). We'll tackle the Big 8, as well as the songs you don't know by heart and all of the tunes in-between; the musicians who influenced him starting with the University of Bourbon Street, those he himself influenced all over the world, and those who collaborated with him, including the beloved Coral Reefer Band.\n\nWe'll also study the cultural legacy of Jimmy Buffett within the state of Florida, including his entrepreneurial enterprises, environmental activism, and philanthropic endeavors in addition to his music. From his early days living in Key West to his environmental work alongside (then) Florida Governor Bob Graham (a UF alumnus) to the recent renaming of A1A to the A1A Jimmy Buffett Memorial Highway with bipartisan support, all of our Floridays can see measures of his impact.\n\nAnd finally, we'll learn more about life at UF when Gainesville and UF were regular tour stops for JB, starting in 1974 when he performed for 400 people at the (now defunct) Great Southern Music Hall. Working with the University Archives, The Independent Florida Alligator digital collection, and other sources, we'll curate a multimedia timeline of concerts, articles, reviews, photographs and setlists from his time around the Gator Nation.\n\nClass activities / assignments in addition to the above will include attempts to create songs out of random overheard phrases (something JB did most recently with My Gummie Just Kicked In) and a guest DJ narrated 4-song compilation for our own version of Fruitcakes on the Radio. Yes, there will also be a side mission to find your cheeseburger (or impossible burger) in the paradise of Alachua County. We'll also watch the movie Hoot which is set and filmed in Florida, based on the book by Carl Hiaasen (another UF alumnus), and featuring music by JB (who also co-produced and played the role of the science teacher).\n\nStudents will need access to the music streaming platform of their choice that includes complete JB albums in addition to Radio Margaritaville (streaming free without a Sirius XM subscription). Supplemental material includes the License to Chill podcast with Ryan and Patrick, the Bing and Bong concert pre-show with JB and Michael Utley, interviews, various articles and readings.\n\nNote: There is a required all-day field trip adventure on Sunday, September 1 (Labor Day weekend), pending us trying to reason with hurricane season. We will be commemorating the 1st anniversary of the oldest surfer on the beach's passing with our own surfing day trip. Thanks to sponsorship from the Honors Program, students in this class will experience their own migration to the beach in St. Augustine with the UF Center for Outdoor Recreation and Education (CORE), transportation and surfboards included. Come Monday, you may be a bit salty and definitely a little sore, but you don't want to be the one to hear, \"you had to be there\" the next day. Please do not register for this course if you cannot attend.\n\n***\n\nDr. J is excited to share her Parrothead fandom with a new generation. First introduced to Jimmy Buffett in the late 1980's / early 1990's, she was fortunate to join the feeding frenzy 6 different times in person, including 6 different cities, 5 tours, 3 states, 2 time zones, and 1 Jimmy Buffett. Her current top 4 Fruitcakes playlist includes: The Pascagoula Run, The Wino and I Know, Delaney Talks to Statues, and Livingston's Gone to Texas. As a bonus, his cover of Lawyers, Guns, and Money.\n\nIssues relating to climate change, conflicts over religious ideology, and the movement of people are ever present in the science, media, and the culture of today. However, these are not new issues that humanity is facing. \"Gods of Thunder\" will outline how indigenous peoples of the Americas navigated the Medieval Warming Period (AD 800-1300 CE) a period of major climate change and how these climatic events led to the transformation of native religion and movement, as people migrated long distances in a response to these phenomena. The course will demonstrate how learning about the past can help position our current issues in historical context. The course will use peer annotation software for students to be able to comment directly on the text and will allow us to create a co-reading environment through Canvas. The course assignments will consist of weekly annotations of the readings, participation within weekly discussions in class, and one short reflection paper on the text. Weekly discussions will consist of major overarching topics in\n\nour text and on student’s observation and opinions on the course reading. The course does not require any previous knowledge of archaeology or the history of the Americas. Background to these topics will be given by the instructor. At the end of the semester, students will learn broadly about the archaeology of the Americas and how the past is an important tool for navigating our own lives in the present.\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 29295\n\nDay/Period: W/4\n\nInstructor: Anthony Farace\n\nDr. Patricia Wright is one of the world’s leading primatologists, having studied night monkeys in Peru and lemurs in Madagascar. Her unrelenting support of Madagascar and its natural environment led to the creation of Ranomafana National Park and the Centre Val Bio research station. Her story is an inspiring one – she was a practicing social worker in New York when her purchase of a pet monkey changed her life. She started graduate school in her 30s – after she had been to Peru and published on her research with no real affiliation to academia. Through her remarkable career, Dr. Wright overcame many of the same challenges as other non-traditional students, and as a single mother, she successfully combined research in the field with raising an adventuresome daughter. High Moon Over the Amazon tells this story of Dr. Wright’s transformation from housewife to world-renowned scientist. For the Love of Lemurs details her work in Madagascar, following her from her co-discovery of the golden bamboo lemur, through the creation of the national park and research station, and then her role in the IMAX film Island of Lemurs. Through our readings and discussion, we will explore Dr. Wright’s pathway to scientific preeminence and the evolution of her efforts to integrate conservation and human well-being.\n\nThis (Un)Common Read course is perfect for students with an interest in nature, primates, women in science, non-traditional paths to scientific success, exploration, discovery, and field research. Prior to some readings, the instructors will provide short introductions to the localities, wildlife, and people described in the readings, augmented by photographs (unique species, environment, habitat loss, the local people and cultural activities) from recent trips to Madagascar. One of the unique strengths of the class will be the instructor’s first hand experiences and impressions from multiple trips to the country, as well as her personal interactions with Dr. Wright.\n\nStudents will be graded on class participation and one or two presentations on additional readings. Students will also complete a class project –academic paper or poster, or artistically creative work related to the course. The last class meeting (or two, depending on class size) will be used for students to present and discuss these final projects. This is an opportunity for students to get creative with class content and what they have learned.\n\nWhile Dr. Wright’s books stand on their own as engaging and informational reads, this course also makes an excellent primer for BOT4935/ZOO4926: Global Biodiversity and Culture: Integrating Conservation and Human Well-being (part of UF’s International Scholars Program).\n\nMichele R. Tennant, PhD, MLIS has a great love of the tropics, the desert, and coral reefs. Her favorite wildlife experiences have included hiking the trails of Madagascar to find lemurs and chameleons; walking the streams of Costa Rica searching for glass frogs; seeing her first anaconda in the Ecuadorian Amazon; experiencing the giant tortoises of the Galapagos; swimming with whale sharks off Nosy Sakatia; and snorkeling amongst the corals and sponges of Bonaire and Belize. Dr. Tennant is co-instructor for a number of courses related to Madagascar and other developing countries: • The study abroad course ZOO4956: Madagascar – Biodiversity & Conservation in a Developing Country; • the International Scholars Program course Global Biodiversity and Culture: Integrating Conservation and Human Well-being; • UnCommon Read Thank You, Madagascar: The Conservation Diaries of Alison Jolly; • UnCommon Read Madagascar: The Eighth Continent: Life, Death and Discovery in a Lost World; • UnCommon Read featuring two books by Patricia Wright: High Moon over the Amazon and For the Love of Lemurs. Dr. Tennant is the interim Senior Director of the libraries’ Academic Research Consulting and Services department (ARCS), and can direct you to expertise for any of your information needs.\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 28082\n\nDay/Period: W/5-6\n\nInstructor: Michele Tennant\n\nMadagascar is best known in the west for its unique flora and fauna, with over 80% of its wildlife found nowhere else. But this engaging country is also home to 23 million people, comprising 18 distinct ethnic groups, unified by a common language and Malagasy identity. Madagascar - The Eighth Continent: Life, Death and Discovery in a Lost World introduces the reader to the unique fauna, flora, and cultures of Madagascar through the authors’ travels with researchers in herpetology (the study of reptiles and amphibians), paleoecology, archaeology and primatology. Not only do readers learn about the biodiversity and cultures of this fascinating “eighth continent”, but they also get a sense for the joy of scholarly exploration and discovery in the natural world, what it is like to be a field-based (rather than laboratory[1]based) researcher, and the rationale for and continued importance of such work. While describing these discoveries, the author interweaves stories of Malagasy history, the mystery of the peopling of the island, and culture (language, music, religion, written and oratory arts) into the conversation, providing much fodder for discussion. Overall, this book is a celebration of the people, the wildlife, and the culture of Madagascar.\n\nThis (Un)Common Read course is perfect for students with an interest in/love for nature, exploration, discovery, and learning about distant lands and cultures. We will read the book Madagascar - The Eighth Continent in its entirety. Prior to some readings, the instructor (or students, if interested) will provide short introductions to the localities, wildlife, people, and customs described in the readings, augmented by photographs (unique species, environment, habitat loss, the local people and cultural activities) from recent trips to Madagascar. One of the unique strengths of the class will be the sharing of first-hand experiences and impressions from multiple trips to the country, providing valuable context to the readings. Although Madagascar is the focus of the course, this class will provide students with an overview of field research, and why it remains important in the modern world of science. Students will be able to view Madagascar as a model for research in areas such as conservation and sustainability, and the importance of culture and the buy-in of the local peoples. Students will be graded on class participation and a presentation on one auxiliary reading. Finally, students will complete a class project –academic paper or poster, or artistically creative work related to the course. The last class meeting (or two, depending on class size) will be used for students to present and discuss these final projects. This is an opportunity for students to get creative with class content and what they have learned.\n\nMadagascar: The Eighth Continent stands alone as a great read, but this course makes an excellent primer for BOT4935/ZOO4926: Global Biodiversity and Culture: Integrating Conservation and Human Well-being (part of UF’s International Scholars Program).\n\nMichele R.

In The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug, Steffanie Strathdee and Thomas Patterson (2019) describe a serious illness caused by a multi-drug resistant whose treatment was successful only because the victim’s wife pursued every possible avenue and treatment to save her spouse. Along the way, it reads a lot like a thriller- and in many ways it is a thrilling ride as Stephanie Strathdee fights for Thomas Patterson’s life. As a scientist working in the field of infectious disease she has knowledge and a way to connect with researchers, healthcare providers, and administrators who could make decisions about the use of controversial new treatments, so she could do perhaps what other patients and their families could not. As we will find, however, that she uses her platform not just to advocate for her husband, but to work and find ways of further researching and make more widely accessible a form of therapy that differs significantly from antibiotics. And indeed with a\n\nbacteria that responded to no known antibiotic, it took the use of a bacteriophage- a virus that infects bacteria- to target and destroy it. This treatment was used in the past but has not been widely practiced in the US and much of Europe so it took work to find and make available a treatment that was not used and was to some extent feared in San Diego where she works and where Patterson eventually received the successful treatment. How important is family support and advocacy in making all forms of treatment and care available for their loved ones? How do we know when it is time to try new and potentially controversial treatments? Who should have access to these new treatments? And how can they be developed in a timely and safe manner?\n\nNina Stoyan-Rosenzweig is archivist and historian in the Health Science Center Library, and Director of Health Humanities in the UF College of Medicine.

A story you will never forget. France, 1714: in a moment of desperation, a young woman makes a Faustian bargain to live forever—and is cursed to be forgotten by everyone she meets. Thus begins the extraordinary life of Addie LaRue, and a dazzling adventure that will play out across centuries and continents, across history and art, as a young woman learns how far she will go to leave her mark on the world. But everything changes when, after nearly 300 years, Addie stumbles across a young man in a hidden bookstore and he remembers her name. The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab is one of the most imaginative and unique fantasy novels of recent years. Focusing on themes of life and death, memory, ideas and inspiration, self-expression, and human connections, Schwab explores the beauty and darkness of life and what it means to leave your mark on the world. In this course, through weekly themed discussions based on the reading, we will analyze these themes, how they play out through the novel, what we can learn from them, and the role they play in both Addie’s and our own lives.\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 29304\n\nDay/Period: T/3\n\nInstructor: Alison Reynolds\n\nPeer Instructor: Noa Tako\n\nPeer Instructor: Theresse Racpan\n\nGreco-Roman mythology is populated by many female characters who, despite their contributions toward the goals of their male counterparts, are often mistreated, harmed, and abandoned. Compounding their poor treatment is the reality that ancient storytellers almost always focus their narratives on the male characters of the mythological world. Who has their story told is a key element to consider when studying the literature of any culture. So, who tells women’s stories in the Greco-Roman world? Ovid’s Heroides, a collection of poems written as letters from women to men (and some from men to women) offers a unique insight into one ancient Roman’s attempt to uncover the lost stories of scorned women, albeit still from a male author’s perspective. How do the heroines populating Ovid’s work think about their roles in the stories of powerful men, and how do they handle the emotional and physical abandonment and mistreatment of these men? In this course, we’ll explore Ovid’s work in English translation as we consider the plight of\n\nhis mythological women letter-writers. We’ll also consider other sources for the Greco-Roman female perspective, including selections from Sappho’s corpus, Euripidean drama, and Ovid’s epic Metamorphoses. Finally, we’ll think about contemporary parallels to Ovid’s Heroides, namely in the realm of popular music.\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 29297\n\nDay/Period: R/8\n\nInstructor: Anthony Smith\n\nIssues relating to climate change, conflicts over religious ideology, and the movement of people are ever present in the science, media, and the culture of today.

Is technology changing human nature? Will your grandchildren be “posthuman” cyborgs? In this course, we will discuss such questions through the lens of Martin Heidegger’s philosophy.\n\nMartin Heidegger (1889-1976) is widely considered the most important philosopher of the 20th century. In this course, we explore Heidegger’s theories of humanity and technology by reading several of his seminal works. We begin with two weeks of readings on Western humanism for context, starting with selections from Plato and Aristotle. Then, we spend several weeks on selections from Heidegger’s 1927 magnum opus, Being and Time, focusing on his reconceptualization of the human being as what he calls “Dasein.” We then read his 1938 “The Age of the World Picture,” his 1954 “Science and Reflection,” and his 1955 “The Question Concerning Technology.” In the final part of the course, we spend two weeks reading about the contemporary movements known as “transhumanism” and “posthumanism” before re-reading Heidegger’s technology essay for a final 1-2 weeks of discussion.\n\nAllen Porter is a philosopher with interests in phenomenology, ethics, politics, the philosophy of technology, and the history of philosophy. He is currently a postdoctoral associate at the University of Florida’s Hamilton Center and will assume the position of Assistant Professor of Philosophy in the Center for Arts and Letters at the University of Austin in July 2025\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 30031\n\nDay/Period: T/5\n\nInstructor: Allen Porter\n\nHighly adaptable, we have seen films, television shows, plays, or ballets based on it. Despite this relative cultural ubiquity, what do we really know about the infamous Dracula, the heroes, the heroines, the spaces, and the themes of the epistolary novel itself? By closely and slowly reading this text together, the brilliance of the story can be, against Dracula’s will, brought to light. What does the novel say about the idea of Europe? Of the law? Is it a warning of coming fascism? What is the power of liminality? What are the necessities or dangers of autochthonous attachment? What is a monster? Is Dracula part wolf? Bat? What is a vampire in our political bestiary or demonology? Why is Dracula presented with aristocratic sensibility? What are the political powers of blood? Does the novel critique or reinscribe Victorian views of gender? Is it work of anti-psychiatry? How does it see erotics, abjection, and power? What does it mean to be a Gothic novel? How does horror function? Hopefully, we will come to a resolution on these questions.\n\nOr maybe, we will remain in the cold and quixotic “shade and shadow,” as Dracula so taunts.\n\nTim is a PhD student in political science. He studies political theory, specifically. With various techniques of criticism derived from German Idealism, psychoanalysis, and Derrida, he theorizes about the United States Intelligence Community, the nature of the political in the United States, fascism, emergency politics, and the connection between erotics and politics. Before coming to UF, he earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy, a masters degree in the history of philosophy from Marquette University and another in political science from UW-Milwaukee.\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 26461\n\nDay/Period: W/11\n\nInstructor: Stacey Liou\n\nPeer Instructor: Timothy Stolz\n\nThis course explores the ranging narrative essays of Pulitzer-winning Annie Dillard. Considered by some as ecologically-oriented creative non-fiction, Dillard's work is also deeply humanistic in its vision. In this seminar style class, we will explore Teaching a Stone to Talk (accompanied by Holy the Firm), which represents some of Dillard’s most compelling if not mysterious work. How might nature speak to us? And how can we look and listen in order to catch what might be heard? If one follows Annie Dillard into the woods, streams, oceans, islands, meadows, and prairies, and, if one listens closely enough, the sights and sounds of these places will have things to say. In these excursions, Dillard seizes opportunity after opportunity to draw on the mysteries of life and death in the natural world and beyond. In doing so, not only does she see the wonders that come to life when pausing long enough to reflect, but also she allows the non-human world to inform human experience, leading to a fuller picture of what it means to be human.\n\nTodd Best is a faculty member in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences where he works as an Academic Advisor and teaches. A long-time instructor of Uncommon Read courses, he has taught on issues ranging several areas of the humanities and social sciences, including on the topics of media literacy, higher education, ecological literature, the self, and the common good. He received a master’s degree in religious studies from the University of Florida, focusing on religious pluralism and educational philosophy.\n\nCourse: IDH2930\n\nClass Number: 29299\n\nDay/Period: W/9\n\nInstructor: Todd Best\n\nDr. Cornel West, a prominent scholar of politics, philosophy, and theology at Union Theological Seminary, is known for holding socialist political views, including the desire to create a Prisoner Bill of Rights and guarantee free pre-K education on a national scale. On the other hand, Dr. Robert George, a legal scholar and philosopher serving as the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University, is pro-life and holds traditionally conservative perspectives on gender, the link between censorship and cancel culture, and the place of religion in American society. Despite their divergent and often contradictory views on such issues, Dr. West and Dr. George have set an impactful example with their deep friendship and respect for one another as academics and individuals. In their statement on the importance of truth-seeking, they emphasize the need to “seek respectfully to engage with people who challenge our views.” This course aims to cultivate informed and civil discussions of topical issues by focusing on essential subjects in today’s public discourse, including marriage, freedom of speech, tension between equity and equality, and patriotism. College is the time to discover more about the world and people around us and to challenge our own beliefs to determine what we truly think, and Truth-Seeking and\n\nDemocracy will help you do exactly that. Within each focus topic, students will read essays, articles, and other works, including those of Dr.’s West and George, championing viewpoints spanning the gamut of human thought. From Emma Goldman’s essay, “Marriage and Love” to a Christopher Rufo article on critical race theory, students will come out of this course equipped with knowledge and a greater understanding of themselves and the society in which they exist and engage.\n\nLiz is a third-year Political Science and French major on the Pre-Law track. Born and raised in Gainesville, she has always been interested in the importance of civil discourse and productive disagreement, and attending last year’s event with Dr. West and Dr. George spurred her to propose an UnCommon course on the subject.

What is Century Tower’s purpose? What are the oldest buildings on campus? How did UF begin? The University of Florida has a long, storied history that begs to be explored. In this course, we will do a deep dive into materials held in the University Archives to explore how these materials tell the story of UF, including those silent, undocumented stories that were excluded from the narrative. We will explore how these materials create the story of community and identity for the students at UF. You will be able to discuss your own story here at UF, and think of ways to share your story for the future. How will your experiences today be reflected in UF’s future? What kinds of stories will be told and how will they be told? How can we fill in the gaps in the archival record to ensure all aspects of a story are told? These are some of the many questions we will explore in this course. The course will include short reflections, discussion posts, and a final project. No previous archives experience or knowledge is necessary, and this course is open to anyone with an interest in learning more about the history of UF.\n\nSarah Coates, CA, is the University Archivist at the George A.

Gainesville is a lovely place, really. We think you will find that there is a lot of activities and great places to explore! In this course, students learn about Gainesville with the help of trusty resident villagers. Students can expect an Animal Crossing experience full of bug catching, gardening, fossil hunting, and fishing. Gator Crossing is a camp for UF Honors students designed to emulate the open-ended gameplay of Nintendo Animal Crossing. Students are introduced to Gainesville by village experts in entomology, ecology, paleontology, and marine bioscience. Students will be challenged to fill their pockets (hypothetically!) with all the information they learn about Gainesville’s bugs, fish, plants, and fossils. Along the way, students learn how to formulate their own research question, so you can propose a research project based on what you learn from village experts. At the end of the multi-day immersive village tour, students can empty their pockets in exchange for bells by presenting their very own research project to the village.\n\nThis experience is a social, informational, environmental, and academic introduction to your new village. Move in and start building relationships with your fellow villagers as you explore the most exciting places on the map of Gainesville. Best of all, meet village experts that show you how they use research to explore, protect, and preserve the natural places we visit.\n\nCourse: IDH3931\n\nClass Number: 29632\n\nInstructor: Jenna Molen\n\nIDH3931 Gator Crossing - Syllabus\n\nIn this accelerated, one-credit course, we will meet in Turlington and other locations around campus and Gainesville. We will read and engage with graphic novels and discuss their impact on our understanding of identities. You should take this time to make connections with each other, to learn the lay of the land, and to learn about the various resources available to you.\n\nThroughout camp, we will meet, go on scavenger hunts for the perfect reading/studying locations, and learn from guest speakers about the Alachua County libraries, UF libraries, the Harn Museum, and the International Center Study Abroad. You should wear comfortable clothes for walking around in the Floridian August heat and bring a water bottle.\n\nSince this is a discussion-based camp, attendance, engagement, and active participation are required. Attendance means coming to class on campus and on the field trips. Engagement and active participation means listening to our guest speakers and to your peers, sharing your ideas and interpretations thoughtfully, and being respectful of each others’ lived experiences and opinions, including when we have disagreements. I believe thoughtful discussions will lead to better understandings of the texts and each other.\n\nStudents will\n\nidentify characteristics of graphic novels\n\nanalyze how stories influence our understanding of identities\n\nlisten actively and articulate their responses to the chosen texts\n\ncreate a final team-based presentation\n\nCourse: IDH3931\n\nClass Number: 29630\n\nInstructor: Melina Jimenez/Christine Voigt\n\nOne Credit to Rule them All\n\nFirst-year students – human, hobbit, elf, or dwarf – are called upon to participate in the “One Credit to Rule them All” Honors Camp to safeguard the One Ring of Power and protect it from the gathering forces of darkness. In this course student teams will learn about the medieval world under five umbrella themes (communication, navigation, the built environment, the natural environment, and conflict resolution) on a quest to create their own fantasy land.\n\nOCRA is a camp for UF Honors students designed as a creative immersion into the drama of Middle Earth as depicted in J. R. R. Tolkien’s classic The Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson’s film version The Fellowship of the Ring will get us started). Students will join hobbits, elves, dwarves, and other inhabitants of Middle Earth to preserve their ways of life against the absolutist ambitions of the Dark Lord – and pick up some basic principles of the medieval lifestyle and other important Middle Earth skills (castle building, siege engines, and more) along the way. Student teams will build their own fantasy worlds while competing against each other in various side quests to gain points and safeguard the ring.\n\nAs first-year students, making connections is critical. The relationships you form as you complete the OCRA experience with other students who share your interest in this singular fantasy adventure can serve as ongoing “fellowships” that will help you be successful in your endeavors at UF. To introduce students to the vast set of resources offered by the University of Florida and the Gainesville community, we will host guest speakers from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, UF Smathers Libraries, the Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences, the local chapter of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and more.\n\nCourse: IDH3931\n\nClass Number: 29615\n\nInstructor: Anthony Smith"
