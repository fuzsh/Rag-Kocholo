The 4-week intensive will have a classical ballet focus with additional classes in character, modern, jazz, pas de deux, pilates, and repertoire. Please note: students must turn age 13 by the first day of the intensive in order to be eligible to participate.\n\nStudents are encouraged to apply early as space is limited. A photo of the student en pointe in first arabesque (female identifying students) or in first arabesque (male identifying students) is required with the application. A headshot is also required. Video auditions may be requested in addition to a completed application form. Applicants may receive this request via email after submitting the application form. Video auditions should consist of one classical variation (female identifying students en pointe).\n\nMore detailed scheduling information, what to bring, and where to report, etc. will be included with the intensive information packet provided to all participants one month prior to the start of the intensive. Please review our FAQ document for general details.\n\nIn summer 2024, Ballet Intensive students will be performing Sleeping Beauty in one act.\n\nWatch the Ballet Intensive Showcase from 2023\n\nWatch the Ballet Intensive performance of Le Jardin Animé from Le Cosaire (2023)\n\nAudition for Butler University Dance Department:\n\nAttending the Ballet Intensive allows rising high school seniors the opportunity to audition for Butler University’s dance program.\n\nIf you are a rising senior and you would like to join the Butler University Dance Department in the fall of the following year, you’re welcome to use the summer intensive as your official audition. Early in the intensive, an informational meeting will be held for all the rising seniors interested in auditioning for the Butler Department of Dance. This meeting will outline the process and admissions staff will be available to answer any questions you might have about the process. Auditioning students will be asked to complete a form detailing their dance training and performance experience well before the official audition class (usually held the 3rd Sunday of July). Please note that auditioning students will not receive their dance admission decision until they have completed the Butler University application process. Summer intensive students are held to the same standard for admission as all other students who audition for the program. Participation in the summer intensive will have no bearing on the student’s acceptance into the dance program.\n\nClass Information:\n\nBallet, Pointe, Variations, Pas de Deux, Character: Ballet technique, Pointe, Variations, Pas de Deux and Character will follow a wide range of styles with a central focus on the Russian Ballet Academy system (Vaganova system) and students will be learning classical repertoire based on the Mariinsky Theatre tradition.\n\nModern: Class will incorporate many foundations of modern dance technique from Graham, Horton, Cunningham, and Limon. The class will include suspension and release, fall and recovery, and connecting breath with movement. Dancers will explore new ways of moving in combinations, floor work, partnering and various methods of improvisation.\n\nJazz: Class will explore a wide range of styles and presentation. Dancers will learn to emphasize musicality, body alignment, conditioning, rhythm, as well as innovative choreography.\n\nPilates: The Pilates Method emphasizes the development of flexibility and core strength through mat and equipment workouts. The core – sometimes called the “power-house” – refers to the muscles surrounding the trunk. Joseph Pilates believed that strengthening these muscles improves posture, prevents injury, and promotes effortless movement. Dancers have gravitated toward Pilates over the last century as its principles and results are harmonious with the dance aesthetic. There are more than 500 exercises in the Pilates Method. Some are known as Fundamentals, because they are the basics that must be learned first. All the exercises have names, standards for correct performance, and a given number of repetitions. Perfection of form is emphasized rather than heavy resistance or high repetitions. The goal is to work better, not harder. A class usually includes several standard exercises; others are introduced for variety or to work on a certain fitness goal.\n\nRefund & Withdraw Policy\n\nIn the event that a student accepted into the intensive is no longer able to attend the intensive, notification of withdrawal from the program should be submitted in writing to BCAS@butler.edu. For students withdrawing prior to June 1, all tuition fees will be refunded (excluding the $75 non-refundable application fee and $500 non-refundable deposit). There will be no refunds issued after June 1. Injury Policy: In the case of injury that prevents the student from beginning participation in the intensive, a full-tuition credit will be provided for participation in the intensive the following year (full-tuition is determined based on which option was selected with the application).
