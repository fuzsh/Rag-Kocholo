        "text": "Site Description\n\nAt the northern end of Tilden Regional Park, nestled in the hills above Berkeley, the East Bay Regional District operates the Tilden Nature Area. The 740-acre nature area includes over 10 miles of hiking trails through a blend of native and introduced plant communities. Natural resource features include oak/bay woodlands, grasslands, eucalyptus forests, streams, ponds, and Wildcat Peak with its panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay. Tilden Nature Area is home to the Tilden Environmental Education Center and the Tilden Little Farm which features a variety of farm animals including cows, sheep, goats, rabbits, chickens, and pigs.\n\nThe Tilden Environmental Education Center provides exhibits and public programs that highlight the diverse resources of the Tilden Nature Area. The existing Education Center and adjacent Little Farm are a major public attraction and a gateway for many to the East Bay natural environment. In addition, hundreds of school children arrive each month to participate in the naturalist programs offered by the Park District at this location.\n\nOverview\n\nThe existing Tilden Environmental Education Center is located at the north end of Central Park Drive, Contra Costa County, California. The existing facility consists of two structures: the education center and a security residence. Both buildings were built in the 1970’s and have outlived their useful life spans. The District intends to replace these existing structures with a new facility of a similar size. The Tilden Little Farm is outside the scope of this project and will remain unchanged.\n\nThe District envisions a new facility providing the following:\n\na state-of-the art educational and exhibit experience that is inviting and accessible.\n\na building complex fully Integrated with its surrounding natural and cultural landscape.\n\na design that reflects the District’s commitment to sustainable and resilient design practices.\n\nThe District has contracted the architectural firm EHDD to develop the project design. Their design team will include CMG for landscape design and Aldrich Pears Associates for exhibit design. EHDD was the architect for the following local public facilities in San Francisco; the Exploratorium, Lands End Visitor Center, and the Tunnel Tops Visitor Center at the Presidio.\n\nSite Location\n\nTimeline\n\nProject Design Schedule\n\nPre-Design Phase: completed – Winter 2024\n\nSchematic Design Phase: begins Winter 2024/ ends Summer 2024\n\nCommunity Meeting Schedule:\n\nCommunity Meeting #1: Project Overview (zoom meeting):\n\nWednesday January 31, 2024, 6:30-8:00 pm\n\nCommunity Meeting #2: Design Options (zoom meeting):\n\nWednesday February 28, 2024, 6:30-8:00 pm\n\nCommunity Meeting #3: Preferred Design Option (zoom meeting)\n\nWednesday April 10, 2024, 6:30-8:00 pm\n\nComments"
