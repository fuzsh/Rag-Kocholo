        "text": "Father Patrick Cunningham\n\nSaint John Seminary College\n\nI grew up in a small town in Kansas the oldest of ten children. Growing up I alternately had three desires for my life. To someday take over our dad’s hardware store, or have a career with the military, or become a priest.\n\nI came to St. John Vianney for two years fully expected to return for my junior year. But that summer I met a blue eyed, black haired Irish lass by the name of Judy Kennedy. As madly as I was in love with her, she had no use for me. It took me six years to convince her otherwise.\n\nWe were married for 42 years, have eight children, and 15 grandchildren. In 1995 I was ordained a deacon. In February of 2008, Judy was born into eternal life and in 2009 I entered the seminary. I was ordained a priest in 2013. I currently serve as the pastor of three parishes in the Diocese of Bismarck ND.\n\nBishop William J. Dendinger\n\nClass of 1957\n\nBishop William J. Dendinger graduated with the first graduating class of Saint Johns Seminary (Mount Michael High School) in Elkhorn in 1957. Bishop Dendinger graduated from Immaculate Conception Seminary in Conception, Mo., with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1961. He continued his education at Aquinas Institute in Dubuque, Iowa, and received his Master of Arts degree in theology in 1964. He was ordained to the priesthood on May 29, 1965, in the Omaha Archdiocese. In 1969, he received his Master of Science degree in counseling from Creighton University in Omaha. Bishop Dendinger taught at Petersburg and Elgin Catholic high schools, now Pope John XXIII from 1965 to 1970. Later that year Bishop Dendinger entered the military as a chaplain. Over the next 31 years, Bishop Dendinger served as a base chaplain, cadet wing chaplain, a member of the chaplain resource board for the United States Air Force Chaplain Institute, plans and programs officer in the Office of the Air Force Chief of Chaplain Service and then chief of the Air Force Chaplain Services. He retired in 2001 as a two-star general. Of his many duties, Bishop Dendinger said celebrating the sacraments is the most inspiring and has enjoyed seeing the changes since Vatican II with more congregation participation, evident in his position at St. Stephen the Martyr Church in Omaha.\n\nBishop Dendinger served as pastor there until October 2004 when he was named Bishop of the Grand Island diocese. Bishop Dendinger was ordained as the seventh bishop of the Grand Island Diocese on December 13, 2004 at the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Grand Island.\n\nBill Doucette\n\nClass of 1967\n\nWhen I left St. John’s Seminary in May of 1967 I was certain I would never come back. At that time I didn’t appreciate the impact the four years there would have on my future. Several years later I realized, as many alumni eventually do, that you can leave the community, the school and the monks but the Benedictine experience will never leave you.\n\nEntering college, I was surprised at how well I had been prepared. I had the discipline and study habits taught by the monks, and the enthusiasm for learning I picked up from my high school friends. I went on to earn a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Psychology at U.N.O. and spent five and a half years working with emotionally and developmentally challenged kids.\n\nIn December 1975 I married Mary Kay LaBute in 1978 we had our first child, Lindsey, who is now an 9attorney in Seattle. Our second daughter Terra was born in 1981. Today she is a Nursing Research Coordinator in Denver. We have three grandsons and two granddaughters.\n\nEarly in 1976 I was offered a job as a sales rep for a major orthopedic manufacturer. After three and a half years with little success, my wife and I decided we could do better as an independent distributor. In 1980 we started Surgical Specialties, a multi-state sales and distribution company focused on orthopedic and general surgery products. Three years later we acquired distribution rights to Biomet Inc., a five year old company with zero sales in our territory. By 1989 I was their “Distributor of the Year” and the Wall Street Journal called Biomet the fasted growing orthopedic company in the world. For the next fifteen years I rode the wave of a rapidly expanding total joint market. Having met my contractual and financial goals in 2004, I retired. For seven years Mary and I spent winters in Scottsdale, AZ and decided to move their full time in 2016. We hope to spend summers in Denver.\n\nIn retrospect it’s difficult for me to imagine where I’d be today had it not been for the unique education I received from my high school, now known as Mount Michael Benedictine.\n\nCasey Eichler (Deceased)\n\nClass of 1978\n\nCasey’s first introduction to Mount Michael Benedictine was attending Camp St. John’s (now called Camp Mount Michael) soon after it was established in 1967. As St. John Vianney Seminary was transitioning to Mount Michael Benedictine High School in 1970 Casey continued to attend camp in the summer and established a connection with the community at Mount Michael enrolling in the fall of 1974. Casey took Physics from Abbot Michael as a senior, the first year he taught in 1978, which was quite an experience. Casey attended Saint John’s University where he graduated with a degree in accounting and soon moved to Dallas Texas with a classmate from Mount Michael (Tom Driscoll). He moved back to Omaha for a short time before relocating to Seattle to join a technology start up, Microsoft. In 1990 Casey moved to the Silicon Valley to work for Steve Job’s start up NeXT Computer which eventually merged with Apple Computer to form what is today known as Apple. Over the next 25+ years he was involved with several technology companies taking two public on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\n\nCasey was committed to his community beginning with teaching CCD in Dallas with Tom. He was president of the school board at his parish, a member of the Stanford University Rotary Club and remained active at both Mount Michael and St. John’s University. He served on the Board of Trustees at Saint Mary’s College in Moraga California. Residing in Redwood City California, Casey lost a battle with cancer and passed in March of 2022. He is survived by his wife of over 35 years, Kathleen, abd their three children Erin, Patrick and Maggie.\n\nDr. Luvern Gubbels, ED.D\n\nClass of 1962\n\nA product of Catholic schools, Luvern followed his passion for Catholic education. After graduating from St. John Vianney Seminary in 1964, he earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Conception Seminary in Conception, Mo.\n\nHe began his career teaching at his hometown school in Randolph, NE at St. Francis de Chantel Catholic Grade School. He also taught at Archbishop Rummel High School in Omaha before earning a master’s degree in administration and a specialist degree in education from the University of Nebraska – Omaha. He earned his doctorate in administration, curriculum and administration from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln in 1987. He served as coordinator for Catholic Southeast School, principal of St. Robert Bellarmine Grade School and principal of Holy Name School (pre-K- 12), all in Omaha. He served as the director of Catholic schools for the Diocese of Winona, Minn. before moving to Des Moines. He has served as the Superintendent of Catholic schools for the Diocese of Des Moines, IA since 1996. Additionally, Luvern has served on a variety of Board of Directors in Des Moines and Omaha and is a member of the National Catholic Education Association and Chief Administrators of Catholic Education\n\nDr. Gubbels will be retiring at the end of this academic year and plans to find ways to continue to serve in Catholic education in Omaha. He and his wife, Joyce, reside in the Omaha area. They have two sons, a daughter on-law and one granddaughter.\n\nBill Heller\n\nClass of 1962\n\nI grew up on a farm on the north edge of Omaha, the middle of three children. Having been born and raised to appreciate farm life, I originally thought that was where I would end up. But God’s plan for my life was better than I could have designed.\n\nMy first exposure to St. John’s Seminary was in September 1957 when I attended the Fall Festival. I had just started the eighth grade at my home parish school,\n\nSt Philip Neri in Omaha, and was considering where to attend high school. Exploring high school options that year, St. John Seminary kept rising to the top of the list. So in the fall of 1958, I enrolled as a freshman at St. John’s (now Mount Michael Benedictine) with the goal of becoming a priest. During high school, I was drawn to the lifestyle of the Benedictine Community. So during my junior year, I decided to join the Monastery as a Brother after the completion of high school. Under the direction of Father Anselm, I began my electrical career and in 1969 I left the Monastery and became an electrician in Omaha. In 1975 I bought Kenworthy Electric and then in 1993, merged with Baxter Electric to form Baxter Kenworthy Electric Inc. as it is known today. My training and experience at Mount Michael set the foundation for many of the rich and rewarding experiences I have since encountered as a business owner. I am proud that our company was able to install the electrical and data systems in the recently completed David “DJ” Sokol Learning for life Building, as well as other electrical projects around the campus.\n\nI am very thankful for the opportunity to have spent my formative years under the influence of the Benedictine Community at Mount Michael Abbey. The lessons I learned and the experience I gained have served me well in my adult life and for this I will forever be grateful to God and the Mount Michael community.\n\nKevin Kennedy\n\nClass of 1979\n\nKevin Kennedy is a 1979 graduate of Mount Michael Benedictine. After high school, Kevin completed his undergraduate at Stanford and his graduate degree at UCLA. Kevin’s work as a writer and producer have been seen on television and screen. In 1989, he was the writer of a film titled “Curfew” and in 2001 wrote the screenplay for “Sam the Man.” As his career progressed, Kevin was the executive producer and a co-writer of “The Assassination of Richard Nixon” in 2004 starring Sean Penn. In 2010, Kevin made the shift to television with the series “The Defenders” on CBS. The American legal comedy-drama starred Jim Belushi and Jerry O’Connell as Las Vegas defense attorneys. Kevin’s work on the series as one of the executive producers and writers had his family and friends glued to the tv every week. Kevin was one of the founding members of the Chesterfield Writer’s Film Project, the prestigious fellowship program which encourages new screenwriting talent. Currently, Kevin is working on new projects which will be made public in the near future.\n\nThomas (Tom) Searcy\n\nClass of 1983\n\nTom Searcy is a nationally recognized author, speaker and the foremost expert in large account sales.
