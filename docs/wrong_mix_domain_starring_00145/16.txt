In "Too Much Sun," Downey Jr. had a supporting role as real-estate agent Reed Richmond.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 15%

Summary: Blessed with an uncanny ability to communicate with animals, Dr. John Dolittle (Downey Jr.) sets off on the high seas with a menagerie of friends to secure a healing miracle for Queen Victoria.

"Dolittle" didn't win over many critics, who gave it poor marks for distracting animation sequences and underwhelming dialogue.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 17%

Rotten Tomatoes score: 25%

Summary: Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) finds herself haunted by someone else's memories after a serial killer (Downey Jr.) descends on her cozy New England town.

Some found the film too routine and others found it too abstract, but either way, "In Dreams" failed to enthrall reviewers.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 26%

Summary: After work-obsessed lawyer Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is bit by a sheepdog, he starts magically transforming into a dog, and his perspective on family changes for the better.

Downey Jr. played the villainous Dr. Marcus Kozak.

Downey Jr. appeared in the film as Telephone Jack.

Most critics weren't impressed with the film, calling it slow and predictable.

David Denby wrote for The New Yorker, "Most of 'Lucky You,' starting with the title, is ordinary or outright awful. Moviemakers, it seems, cannot bluff their way to success."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 29%

Summary: In this eccentric comedy, Hugo Dugay (Alyssa Milano) encounters oddball characters as she cleans pools across Los Angeles.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 32%

Summary: "Eros" is an anthology from three filmmakers — Michelangelo Antonioni, Steven Soderbergh, and Wong Kar Wai — that revolves around love and intimacy.

In the segment "Equilibrium," Downey Jr. played Nick Penrose, an advertising executive in 1950s New York.

In critics' eyes, "Eros" showed moments of inspiration but couldn't overcome its unpredictable tone and plotting.

"Anthologies by their inherent nature tend to be highly uneven," Tom Dawson wrote for the BBC. "And 'Eros' proves no exception, with the individual sections ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 38%

Summary: In "Black and White," Sam (Brooke Shields) and her husband Terry (Downey Jr.) get close to rap influencer Rich Bower (Oliver "Power" Grant) and his circle as Sam films a documentary.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 39%

Summary: In "The Singing Detective," crime novelist Dan Dark (Downey Jr.) plots out his next story in his head as he recovers in a hospital.

"Unfortunately, when Downey is not centre-stage the drama becomes leaden, sentimental and utterly improbable," Kate Muir wrote for The Times.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 50%

Summary: Inspired by the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, in "Less Than Zero" Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns home to Beverly Hills and he gets swept up in Julian's (Downey Jr.) drama as his friend's drug addiction spirals out of control.

The film had the look and feel of an acclaimed drama, but critics felt like the plot didn't quite measure up.

Summary: "Greaser's Palace" tells a parable of the life of Jesus Christ in a Wild West town.

Downey Jr. appeared in the film in an uncredited role as "Small Boy in Covered Wagon."

Critics weren't blown away by the Western comedy, but many appreciated the film's satire.

Nathan Rabin wrote for the AV Club, "As a product of an unusually adventurous time in cinema history, 'Greaser's Palace' has perverse appeal. As a comedy, it's virtually unwatchable."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 50%

Summary: In this comedic drama, Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Carla (Heather Graham) confront Blake (Downey Jr.) when they realize he's been stringing them both along for months.

Critics mostly felt like "Two Girls and a Guy" fell in the middle ground between a solid comedy and well-written romance.

"It only half succeeds," critic Felix Gonzalez Jr. wrote. "The laughs are well earned, but the attempts at serious romantic analysis fall short of poignancy."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 53%

Summary: After growing up believing that her future soulmate's name is Damon Bradley, Faith (Marisa Tomei) takes a spontaneous trip to Italy when she thinks she's finally found the one she's been looking for.

Downey Jr. starred opposite Tomei as her love interest, Peter Wright.

"[D]espite the lovely Italian locales and a relatively appealing cast, the film is far too cloying for all but the most sentimental tastes," wrote the staff at TV Guide.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 56%

Summary: Underdog nerds Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) get more than they bargained for when they design their dream woman on a computer.

Downey Jr. appeared as high-school bully Ian.

Riddled with stereotypes, "Weird Science" was received as one of John Hughes' lesser works, even if it retained a wisp of charm.

"'Weird Science' is certainly an 80's curiosity for anyone who is a fan of John Hughes, but it is definitely more of a questionable relic of that era than his other works," Andrew Gaudion wrote for Vulture Hound.

He played Steve Lopez in "The Soloist" (2009).

Rotten Tomatoes score: 57%

Summary: Based on a true story, "The Soloist" follows LA columnist Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) as his world view shifts when he crosses paths with Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a musically gifted man who's experiencing homelessness.

After the success of the director Joe Wright's earlier films, like "Pride and Prejudice" (2005) and "Atonement" (2007), critics expected more from the drama.

"While 'The Soloist' is certainly not a cinematic dud, it falls dramatically short of Wright's earlier films," Richard Propes wrote for the Independent Critic. "[But it's] redeemed by Robert Downey, Jr.'s usual standout performance."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 58%

Downey Jr. portrayed Charles Chaplin in "Chaplin" (1992).

Rotten Tomatoes score: 59%

Summary: In his old age, legendary silent-film actor Charlie Chaplin (Downey Jr.) revisits key moments in his life and his career.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 59%

Summary: In this action-packed sequel, Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) try to track down their nemesis Moriarty (Jared Harris) before his next murder plot.

Summary: "Game 6" follows playwright Nicky Rogan (Michael Keaton) across a nerve-wracking weekend as his favorite baseball team enters the World Series and an influential critic (Downey Jr.) threatens to bury his career.

Critics rated "Game 6" as a solid dramatic comedy that suffered from narrow audience appeal.

"For fans of [screenwriter] DeLillo, Keaton and/or either team in that classic World Series, this curious little picture is worth tracking down," Andrew O'Hehir wrote for Salon.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 61%

Summary: Jack Jericho (Downey Jr.) is a slick pick-up artist who can seemingly get any woman he wants — until he meets Randy Jensen (Molly Ringwald).

Rotten Tomatoes score: 64%

Summary: After getting fired, Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter) travels home for Thanksgiving and grits her teeth through a family-filled weekend.

In the holiday comedy, Downey Jr. played Claudia's brother Tommy.

Critics agreed that the universal appeal of "Home for the Holidays" also made it an easy target for critique when it came to its uninventive script.

"Neither caustic nor sentimental, it's a film that maybe half the people on Earth have at one time considered writing," Mick LaSalle wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle.

Downey Jr. was interviewed for the documentary "The Outsider" (2005).

Rotten Tomatoes score: 65%

Summary: "The Outsider" is a retrospective look at director James Toback's career and the actors he worked with, including Downey Jr., Harvey Keitel, and Neve Campbell.

Critics called "The Outsider" an interesting look into an unconventional director's filmography, even as its fawning approach edged into the territory of documentary bias.

"As is often the case with Toback's films, even as you're shaking your head at his shameless self-indulgence, you can't help but keep on watching," Elizabeth Weitzman wrote for New York Daily News.

In "Chances Are" (1989), he was Alex Finch.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 67%

Summary: After Corinne (Cybill Shepherd) loses her husband in a car accident, she's amazed when he's reincarnated as her daughter's (Mary Stuart Anderson) boyfriend Alex Finch (Downey Jr.) two decades later.

For some critics, the plot left something to be desired. But there was enough well-placed dialogue and star power to prevent "Chances Are" from fading into obscurity.

"'Chances Are' is hampered from the start by this overworked premise," Jack Garner wrote for Gannett News Service. "The surprise, then, is how the film generates enough charm, romance and humor to overcome the familiarity."

In the film, which was shot digitally and then rotoscoped, Downey Jr. played Bob's friend James Barris.

Critics praised director Richard Linklater's unique vision, even as they admitted that some of "A Scanner Darkly's" ideas came across as half-baked.

"Linklater never pretends that he has all the answers, but he asks the questions in such an interesting, elegant fashion that you'll be glad you came along for the ride," film critic Brian Tallerico wrote.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 69%

Although its script fell short in a few places, "Sherlock Holmes" earned high marks from critics who applauded the decision to cast Downey Jr. as the famous fictional detective.

"Downey, Jr. is the perfect casting choice who manages to bring a somewhat lackluster script to life," Allison Rose wrote for Flick Direct.

Summary: On the set of a soap opera, an aspiring actress (Cathy Moriarty) conspires with a TV producer (Downey Jr.) to drive the show's star (Sally Field) insane.

Critics loved the jokes and dialogue at the heart of the comedy, even if "Soapdish" wasn't always narratively cohesive.

"The plot is contrived and this is hardly a believable picture of how a soap opera is made, but at least the gags are mostly funny," critic Mark R. Leeper wrote.

Reviewers called "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints" an engaging coming-of-age story, even if it was rough around the edges.

"Over-indulgent but often interesting and ambitious in its attempt to recreate the free-wheeling, jazz-improvisational feel of classic independent 70s cinema," Peter Bradshaw wrote for The Guardian.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 76%

Summary: When Tony (Downey Jr.) creates a peacekeeping program to protect the world from harm, his robotic creation quickly turns against him and the rest of the Avengers as it seeks to eradicate human life.

"Avengers: Age of Ultron" wasn't a favorite Marvel entry by critical standards, but it served as a pleasant distraction.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 81%

Summary: On the verge of bankruptcy, movie producer Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) works on his dream project without telling the star of the picture, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), that they are secretly filming him.

Downey Jr. played Jerry Renfro, a Universal Pictures executive.

"Bowfinger" bordered on being too silly at times, but most reviewers left the theater smiling.

"Steve Martin is one of the most versatile actors in the business; he is also one of the funniest comics, one of the few capable of making the viewer believe any situation, no matter how far-fetched," Eugene Novikov wrote for Film Blather.

Although the structure of the dark comedy felt unevenly paced, critics said "Wonder Boys" scored high when it came to originality.

"I've never quite seen a movie like 'Wonder Boys,'" Steven Snyder wrote for Zertinet Movies. "It is sometimes self-deprecating, often nostalgic and optimistic, but always slightly mysterious."

In "Tropic Thunder" (2008), he was Kirk Lazarus.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 82%

Summary: In order to capture authentic acting performances, a director (Steve Coogan) drops his actors in the middle of an active war zone without telling his cast what's going on.

Starring alongside Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Brandon T. Jackson, Downey Jr. played a method actor who went too immersive for a role.

By satirizing Hollywood from every angle, the comedy produced big laughs with critics as it toed the line between comedy and controversy.

"'Tropic Thunder' exaggerates on its eccentricity, but it's always dealt with a sense of satirical truth," Kelechi Ehenulo wrote for Set the Tape.

"'Infinity War' didn't wear me down in the way that 'Age of Ultron' did, it didn't give me the high of the first 'Avengers' either," Anupama Chopra wrote for Film Companion. "Like I said, manage expectations and you'll be just fine."

Downey Jr. had a cameo appearance as Marvin, the ex-husband of Carl's wife's (Sofía Vergara).

Critics said "Chef" was the movie equivalent of well-made comfort food.

"The result is a small, unashamedly feel-good film that makes up for what it lacks in dramatic jeopardy with gentle comedy, heartwarming family scenes, ladles of food porn, and time spent among characters you like," Laurence Phelan wrote for the Independent.

Reviewers said "Zodiac" served as a showcase of David Fincher's talents as a director and the masterclass acting of his cast.
