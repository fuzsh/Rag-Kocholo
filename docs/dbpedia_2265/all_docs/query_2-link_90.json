New playground additions and improvements include, universally accessible playground equipment and surfacing, additional shade pavilions and picnic tables, climbing wall/hillside play area, swing bench seating, musical instruments and improved landscape and irrigation.\n\nA historic sign can be found on the baseball backstop, the 20–Mile historic marker is located at O'Brien park and a decorative wall mural appears in the Kieffer's Crossing tunnel. In addition, O'Brien Park boasts “time stones,” a public art display, along with other art displays on a rotating basis.\n\nO'Brien Park's gazebo serves as the backdrop for many Parker events, including outdoor concerts and the Mayor's Holiday Lighting.\n\nIn fall 2005, the Town purchased 5.64 acres directly northeast of O'Brien Park with the intention of eventually developing it as an extension of the existing park.\n\nAdditional Links"
