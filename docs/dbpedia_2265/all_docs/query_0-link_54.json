        "text": "2003 Track & Field: Calhoun participated in indoor track competition, but not the outdoor season due to a conflict with spring football practice. He ran the 200-meter dash and took part in the long jump competition at both the Air Force Classic and Frank Sevigne Invite, while advancing to the Big 12 Championships in the long jump. Calhoun earned a pair of 13th place finishes in the 200-meter, with his best score of 22.48. He recorded his top long jump of 22-04.25 on two separate occasions, first in a sixth place finish at the Air Force Classic and again in a 13th place finish at the Big 12 Championships.\n\nHigh School: Calhoun ran the 100 (10.5) and 200-meters (21.2) and participated in the high jump (24-3) and long jump (6-8) at Oak Creek High School in Oak Creek, Wis. He was team MVP all four years and lettered each year. He participated in the World Youth Championships in Athletics, placing seventh in the long jump (24-3) in 2001 in Budapest, Hungary; itâ€™s basically a lower-level Olympics for those 18-and-under."
