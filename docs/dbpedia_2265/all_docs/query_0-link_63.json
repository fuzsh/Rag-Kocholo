        "text": "Erin O’Brien passed away on Thursday, March 11th. She was surrounded by her children and son-in-law looking through pictures and recalling cherished stories and memories, many of which included her extended family and dear friends.\n\nErin was born in Mankato, MN to Beryl & Kenneth O’Brien and was the fifth of six children. Erin’s large and loving family was an integral part of who she was. She was a Minnesota girl at heart. She loved going home and visiting with her beloved childhood friends and spending time with her family at their annual summer lakeside gathering. We know that part of mom’s spirit will always be there as it was truly her favorite place to be with her favorite people.\n\nErin was a National Merit Scholar. She attended Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA where she double majored in English and Dance; and then went on to attain her Law Degree from the University of Denver. She was incredibly smart, well-spoken and passionate about the causes close to her heart.\n\nWhile she held a number of positions prior to having her children, the majority of Erin’s career was spent with the same company, where she acted as the Senior Legal Counsel, for nearly 20 years. Her “work family” gave her some of her dearest friendships. She worked incredibly hard every single day – dedicating herself to both her career and her three children – in an effortless and admirable way.\n\nShe woke up early every morning to read. Her love and admiration of books is something she instilled in her children and grand baby. She also had a deep interest for politics. Erin was well versed and could hold an educated conversation on just about anything in this realm, and she was an active volunteer for the 2020 election. She was a proud member of the Board of Directors for Eaton Senior Communities. Erin loved animals and we know was greeted in Heaven by a number of beloved pets.\n\nAt her core, what made Erin most happy were the relationships in her life. She lived in the same neighborhood for over 30 years from which many friendships flourished – both new and some decades old. She had the most wonderful group of friends, who she loved to spend time and laugh with. She always taught her kids to measure success not by possessions or wealth, but in the community of people who stand with you and you in turn support. By her measure, she was lucky beyond compare for all the people she had and loved in her life.\n\nErin’s heart and pride laid with her three children. She was a selfless, devoted and amazing mom who will be so dearly missed by her family. Her love for her children was only matched by that for her granddaughter, Harper, whom she had the most special of relationships with. She also deeply loved her son-in-law and her son’s partners, who she embraced and treated like her very own. Being together as a family was truly what made her the happiest.\n\nErin is survived by her son Carson (and his girlfriend Nicole); son Tucker (and his girlfriend Sara); daughter Alix (son-in-law William); granddaughter Harper; a large and beloved extended family including: her five siblings (Michael, Craig, Nancy, Kevin & Molly); siblings-in-law, nieces and nephews, grand-nieces and nephews, cousins and many more. She is also survived by her two dogs, Hazel and Georgia, who miss her very much.\n\nErin is survived also by her dear mother, Beryl O’Brien. There are not enough words to express the admiration and deep love that Erin had for her mother. Beryl had a profound impact on Erin’s life and some of her fondest memories included time they spent together. Her mother was Erin’s role model and she lived each day hoping to emulate the love and devotion Beryl shows as a mother and grandmother.\n\nErin is preceded in death by her father, Ken O’Brien, who we know greeted her with a big hug.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Friday, March 19th at 2pm at Horan & McConaty located at 1091 S. Colorado Blvd. Due to COVID precautions, the in-person gathering will be by invite only but her family invites all who would like, to join us for the live streaming of the service that will also be available starting at 2pm at: https://bxcited.com/erinobrien/\n\nIn lieu of flowers for the family, please consider donating to one of these organizations in honor of our mom’s giving and generous spirit.\n\nThe Rise School of Denver. This is where Erin’s beloved grand daughter attends school and its mission is one that is very dear to our whole family’s heart. If you know anything about Erin, it’s that she embraced everyone and also loved anything having to do with Harper June.\n\nhttps://www.risedenver.org/ —> Ways to Give —> “Give in Honor or Memory”\n\nThe Dumb Friends League. Animals were a huge part of Erin’s life and we’d like for her true love of them to continue on.\n\nhttps://www.ddfl.org/ —> Donate —> “Memorial Gift”\n\nFood Bank of the Rockies. During these trying COVID times, food insecurity for others was something Erin was very bothered by. She especially struggled with the idea of parents not being able to provide for their kids. If you were ever at our home growing up, you know our house was always stocked and ready for visitors with open arms. We’d like to ensure that others in our Colorado community continue to have what they need.\n\nhttps://www.foodbankrockies.org/ —> Give Now\n\nEaton Senior Communities. Erin was a very proud member of the Board of Directors for Eaton Senior Communities. She cared deeply for their mission and all those she worked with there."
