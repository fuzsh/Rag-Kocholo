        "text": "The family of a hiker who went missing in Colorado on Saturday is asking the community to help find him.\n\nIan O'Brien, 28, a resident of Page, has not returned home after he went for a solo hike in the Echo Basin area at La Plata Mountains around 2 p.m. The search for him started around 11:30 p.m. that night, according to Ian's older sister, Kelsey O'Brien Rodriguez.\n\n\"The search for my brother has been going on for over three days,\" Rodriguez said. \"We're really encouraging experienced hikers that know the area well to go and help bring resources.\"\n\nAccording to Sheriff Steve Nowlin with Montezuma County Sheriff's Office, O'Brien made it to Hesperus Mountain peak about four and a half hours after he hit the road. He took a photograph of the summit and shared it around 6:30 p.m. on social media, Nowlin said.\n\nRodriguez said one of her main concerns with her brother's disappearance is that he has epilepsy and she thinks he may have suffered from seizures while on his hike. His current condition was unknown, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nO'Brien has blond hair, blue eyes, is about 6 feet, 4 inches tall and he was wearing a gray tank top, black shorts, tennis shoes and possibly had a gray long-sleeve hiking shirt at the time he went missing, according to Rodriguez.\n\nNowlin said there were 12 teams out searching the area since 9 a.m. on Tuesday, and more units were expected to come. However, no signs of O'Brien had been found as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"We searched the area so well, from the air and on the ground on the west side of the La Plata Mountains,\" Nowlin told The Arizona Republic. \"We're doing everything. We know where he was at, but nothing else.\"\n\nNowlin also said the search is losing resources because of nearby wildfires that need assistance from fire crews and other rescue resources.\n\n\"I don't know how long the search will go after (Wednesday),\" Nowlin said. \"It just depends.\"\n\nRodriguez said O'Brien and his girlfriend were up in Durango, Colorado, visiting friends and enjoying a long weekend in one of their favorite places, and O'Brien decided to go for a hike at one of his favorite spots. Normally, it would be completely safe for him to do the trail by himself, Rodriguez said.\n\n\"It is a common thing for Ian to do. He's an extremely skilled outdoor guide, and he frequently hikes and bikes solo,\" she said.\n\nRodriguez said O'Brien previously lived for three years in Durango, where he worked as an outdoor guide and he often went for hikes at the Echo Basin trails.\n\nO'Brien has had epilepsy since he was in college, but it is controlled with medication, and he has been on several hikes before without having any seizures, Rodriguez said.\n\n\"He's an extensive, experienced outdoor hiker and knows the area extremely well,\" she said. \"He went out on a hike by himself at a reasonable time, to a hike he'd done before.\"\n\nO'Brien could have been seen the day after he went missing\n\nNowlin said O'Brien was initally believed to have been seen on Sunday evening by a group of hikers as he was walking into the woods while looking disoriented.\n\nThe hikers reported the man they saw was without his backpack, which Rodriguez said made her concerned as O'Brien carried his epilepsy medication, his GPS and other equipment in his backpack.\n\nShe also said if her brother was lost and saw the group of hikers, he would have most likely asked for help. \"If the sight of him was correct, that could only be because he's been having seizures,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Nowlin said the man was likely not O'Brien. Although the man described by the hikers matched O'Brien's physical characteristics, he was hearing different clothing, Nowlin told The Republic.\n\n\"It was very promising at first, but we don't know if it's him,\" Nowlin said. \"He didn't have extra clothing, and I interviewed a lot of campers in the area and they all said none of their clothes were missing.\"\n\n'Please consider joining': Community can help find O'Brien\n\nO'Brien, who currently works as an outdoor wilderness guide in Page, was described by his older sister as a \"free spirit\" and a dedicated environmentalist.\n\n\"He's really passionate about nature, and he has dedicated his career to helping people find therapy through nature,\" Rodriguez said. \"He is funny, he's gregarious and he has really, really, just the biggest heart in the world.\"\n\nRodriguez said the help of the community is key in helping find her brother, as the search has extended for days.\n\n\"The teams searching for him are tired,\" Rodriguez said. \"The team grows by the day, but we're urging anyone who's in the area that's an experienced hiker to please consider joining the search. They need reinforcement. They need to sleep. Everyone needs to take care of themselves.\"\n\nShe said members of the community who want to help can also bring camping and hiking equipment to help with the search.\n\n\"We appreciate every single thought, prayer, and hopeful wish for his safety,\" Rodriguez said in a Facebook post she shared on Monday evening. \"We are so grateful for the community surrounding our family right now.\""
