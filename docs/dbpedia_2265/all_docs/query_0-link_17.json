        "text": "Alex O'Brien is the weekday evening meteorologist on our First Alert5 Weather Team.\n\nMeteorologist Alex O’Brien is a Colorado gal to her bones as she grew up in Greeley and graduated from the Metropolitan State University of Denver meteorology program.\n\nAlex has earned the American Meteorological Society’s Certified Broadcast Meteorologist (CBM) designation, a professional recognition of the quality of their weather broadcasts. Among radio and television meteorologists, the CBM designation is sought as a mark of distinction and recognition.\n\nAfter graduating Summa Cum Laude from the MSU program, she worked in Denver as a producer at WeatherNation TV in Centennial, CO before moving to Lubbock, Texas for a role as a weekday morning meteorologist with KAMC News. She moved back to Colorado and has been with News 5 since 2019.\n\nNow back in her home state covering the diverse Colorado Springs and Pueblo market micro-climates, Alex knows all things that make our weather so unique!\n\n\"Being a meteorologist is both a lot of fun when the weather is kind, and impactful when the severe weather is threatening. I work hard to be an expert in all scenarios,\" explains Alex.\n\nIn her free time, Alex loves hiking, cooking, creating cocktails with her husband Jordan, and cuddling with her cat Nala. You may find her at the farmer’s market on the weekend or enjoying the endless scenery.\n\n\"It is the most breathtaking state in the country with the best air, plants, and animals. The weather is so dynamic and keeps me on my toes,\" Alex says when what it is she loves about Colorado."
