        "text": "After a pre-law career in multi-state sales for a cannabis equipment company, Braden recognized the significant challenges startups faced, especially in fundraising and navigating the intricacies of highly regulated industries. This realization spurred Braden’s journey into law, where he aspired to alleviate some of these challenges for entrepreneurs, enabling them to focus on their true passions.\n\nIn law school, Braden’s dedication to supporting startups was evident. As managing director of the Deming Center Venture Fund, he led a team that performed due diligence on early-stage companies, investing in Colorado startups on behalf of the University of Colorado. He also valued his time at the school’s entrepreneurial law clinic, where he deepened his understanding of the tangible work attorneys do for founders. Further, through negotiation classes and competitions, Braden honed his skills in advocating for clients, ensuring their business interests were protected and enhanced.\n\nAfter a summer associateship with Husch Blackwell, where he contributed to a variety of cannabis-related projects and transactions, Braden joined the firm full-time. He currently focuses on cannabis transactions for companies of all sizes and at all stages.\n\nWith an undergrad degree in Business Management & Entrepreneurship, Braden loves supporting business owners and is personally energized by working with the passionate, creative individuals who make up Husch Blackwell’s clients. His background clearly informs his legal approach, making him adept at understanding client needs and delivering high-quality services. In working with Braden, clients can expect an attorney who not only understands their challenges but also anticipates their needs. As a reliable, empathetic, and solutions-oriented professional, Braden is an asset to any team or project and is genuinely invested in achieving the best possible outcomes for clients."
