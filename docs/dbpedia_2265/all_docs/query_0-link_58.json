        "text": "The six of us had a great day fishing. It was right in the middle of the mayfly hatch so the fishing was tough. It took a little while but the captain kept working and put us on the fish. We put 22 in the boat. Biggest was 27” walleye. The boat had plenty of room for the six of us. Definitely will use him again.\n\nBeing mid April , Captain Jason O’brien took us to the reefs in the Western Basin to Jig Fish. With 1 ounce hair jigs, we caught 8 larger than normal Walleye,2.5lbs to 4lbs. Then, we moved on to trolling with planner boards. We caught 10 more to reach our limit, and they were even bigger, 3.5lb to 7.5lb fish…. Unique time of year when you can Jig Fish and Troll “with the right Captain” in the same day and be productive. Thanks to Jason O’brien / JOB Fishing Charters for putting us on top of the fish. Hard to find a nicer, more comfortable boat too. Weldcraft 300 Cuddy King with 850 HP, and trolling motor.\n\nBeing mid April , Captain Jason O’brien took us to the reefs in the Western Basin to Jig Fish.
