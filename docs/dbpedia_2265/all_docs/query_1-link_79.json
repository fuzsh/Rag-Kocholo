Borkman stands, self-imprisoned in his upstairs room. A hidden door in a faded tapestry of a nymph and her shepherd opens to admit the woman he loved and then forsook when he married her sister for worldly advantage. The audience shivers afresh at the consequences.\"\n\nBorn the son of British parents in India in 1929, O'Brien spent two years just after World War II as an army sergeant stationed in Austria. He began to work as a scenic designer for the London stage in 1956, with the production of The Bald Primadonna. There followed numerous productions that included works of Shakespeare ranging from a 1961 staging of Henry IV, Part I, 1967's All's Well That Ends Well, and the following year's The Merry Wives of Windsor to 1970's Measure for Measure and 1971's The Merchant of Venice. O'Brien also started to design for more modern classics, such as Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, both in 1964, as well as Ibsen's The Master Builder in 1995. He also participated in the production of musical works that included a 1984 production of Richard Wagner's opera Tannhauser, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's Threepenny Opera in 1986, and a 1993 production of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. To U.S. audiences perhaps the most notable of O'Brien's designs were those he did for the premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita in 1978.\n\nWriting in the Hartford Courant, Malcolm Johnson suggested that O'Brien's \"stage-spanning bridge\" designed for Evita—the place from which the title character addressed the Argentine throngs—has become a defining structure in Lloyd Webber's more recent work. \"Evita and its breathtaking look, both harshly mechanistic and redolent of revolutionary Latin murals,\" wrote Johnson, \"inaugurated a new era for Lloyd Webber, and for musical theater. Thereafter, even if Lloyd Webber originally conceived of a new work as intimate, as in the case of both Cats and Starlight Express, the urge toward spectacle proved irresistible.\"\n\nThough it may be true, as Shakespeare wrote, that \"the play's the thing,\" O'Brien's work has attracted plenty of notice by theatre reviewers. L. Potter, writing in the Times Literary Supplement regarding a production of Love's Labour's Lost staged at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-on-Avon, called O'Brien's sets \"exceptionally beautiful.\" Benedict Nightingale of the London Times reviewed the Royal Shakespeare Company's presentation of the same play in London a year later, a production whose cast included an actor then little known to U.S. audiences, Ralph Fiennes. Having returned to \"its main London home,\" Nightingale suggested, \"as if to apologise for being so long away,\" it appeared that the company, and specifically O'Brien, had given \"its stage a disarmingly luxuriant look. Timothy O'Brien might have collaborated with Monet and Renoir in creating the lush foliage of reds, yellows, purples, and greens that towers above Shakespeare's lords as they loll on cushions enjoying their dejeuner sur l'herbe [a reference to Lunch on the Grass, a famous Monet painting] in the dappled light.\"\n\nO'Brien once told CA: \"When Graham Vick, the director, and I went to visit Luciano Berio about his new opera Outis, of which the premiere was imminent but the music incomplete, I asked him what it was, to which he replied: 'A musical action in five cycles. A network of expectations. No outcome, however. No premise either.' So I set happily to work in a black space designing scenography containing a sixty-foot revolving stage, secret walls springing up from the floor, a sale of childhood myths by an auctioneer who grew to twenty-five feet and was pricked to death, a Golden Calf made of sixty-eight television sets, a brothel of glass barriers, a dream-laden supermarket, a forest, a child's Trojan horse, a cruise liner, an airport lounge and a concert platform which saw the death of music. Outis—the Greek word for nobody—is the name Odysseus gives himself in the cave of Polyphemus. When Polyphemus cries out that 'Nobody' has blinded him, the other Cyclops do not come to his aid and Outis escapes. Outis's journey does not end in this opera. Berio confronts his own life at the end of the twentieth century, during which he feels conviction has died.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nContemporary Designers, 3rd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1990.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nHartford Courant, August 20, 1995, p.
