        "text": "November 21, 1990 – March 17, 2024\n\nSteamboat Springs native Catherine Joan O’Brien, better known as Catie or Cate, passed away peacefully in her sleep on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17th at the age of 33.\n\nCate was born on November 21st, 1990 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado to parents Trish and Steve. As a child, Cate’s curly hair, striking blue eyes and sweet character was punctuated by a fiery nature. Throughout her childhood Cate made many friends in Steamboat, taking part in dance, girl scouts, and skiing.\n\nAt nine-years-old Cate developed the autoimmune disease Lupus. Years ensued of doctor’s visits and health struggles. But Cate persevered. After graduating high school, she attended San Diego State University earning a degree in geography before making her way back to her hometown of Steamboat.\n\nThere Cate truly shined – she became enchanted with yoga, attending classes at Rakta, often multiple in a day. She later discovered strength training, and became a fixture of Steamboat Fit, taking to her fitness with a particular passion and zeal. And Cate loved the freedom of skiing. She could often be seen flying down the mountain with her trademark pink helmet and long, brown curls flowing in the wind behind her.\n\nCate was the sweetest of humans and was particularly sensitive toward others with health struggles. She was kind, compassionate, had her own quirky way about her, but above all, loved the people in her life and took to her endeavors in the most passionate of ways. Her relationship with her young nephew Theodore exemplified this – little Ted loved to play superman and dance to Widespread Panic with his beloved Aunt Cate. We will never forget that.\n\nCatie leaves behind her mother Trish, father Steve, brother Jack, sister-in-law Sarah, nephew Ted, her aunts, uncles and cousins, and numerous friends.\n\nA group ski from Sunshine Peak to Slopeside via Storm Face, Rainbow, and Vagabond (runs subject to snow coverage) will be held in Catie’s honor on April 13th. We will meet at the base of the Wild Blue Gondola at 1:00pm – or see us at Slopeside around 1:30pm if not partaking in the ski. Please don one of Cate’s favorite colors – pink, purple, and/or periwinkle.\n\nA celebration of life will be held May 4th in Steamboat Springs, details to come.\n\nThe family would like to humbly thank our many friends, relatives, and the Steamboat community, who have held us up during this incredibly difficult time. And the Steamboat Fit community deserves a special thank you. Cate loved this group dearly, and they have helped remind us what a strong and beautiful soul Cate was.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family asks that a donation be made to the Lupus Foundation of Colorado.\n\nGoodbye, Cate."
