        "text": "\"Matt and Maren made this whole process smooth and easy. They kept me up to date with everything that was going on and they explained everything to me and were always available when I had questions or concerns. Pleasure to work with them. Matt, I honestly thought this whole process of hiring a attorney was gonna be a nightmare and you definitely changed my mind about it. I was able to pay off both our vehicles and most of our debts and I'm in enrolled in school.\"\n\n\"I had a Workman's Compaction case for several years and was referred to two attorneys in my home town. They did not have the knowledge and up to date laws. I went on a search in the Denver area looking for the best of the best attorneys in Denver. I was referred to Erika Alverson I sent Erika a copy of my case it was revived. The following week I had an appointment Erika and I went over the case. When I was ready to leave I was totally at peace with the professionalism and knowledge of Erika. One thing that stands out to me was that there was no settlement amount discussed at that time. The one thing I had was a lot of documentation from the beginning that was a help. If you can retain documentation that will help expedite the process and it will be worth it. I will say one thing it was not a snap or a breeze. When I would lose focus and look at today she would tell me \"DON'T LOOK AT TODAY LOOK AT THE FUTURE.\" She was so right. When we went to the hearing Erika was aggressive, honest and straight forward and to the point.\"\n\n\"Not only is Erika committed to her clients, she is very trustworthy and caring. I would recommend her to a person that is honest and has a genuine injury. Erika is a very caring person and will keep you informed. She works hard for her clients and carries high standards. She knows the laws and will fight for your well being and rights. She is very organized and has a lot of respect in the community. The thing I like best about Erika is she listens well and takes the time to check in and see how you're doing.\"\n\n\"The Best Lawyer You Can Ask For Going Through The Work Comp System The best lawyers you could ask for going through the worker's comp system after a robbery left me with PTSD. I had tried a few different lawyers and they turned me away claiming they didn't handle psychiatric cases. Erika took me on without hesitation, helped me to get the treatment I needed. She always answered every question I had during the process. She took time to get to know me and my case and always made time for us to come into the office as we got to different points. When we FINALLY reached the settlement portion she would help me to make it through all the confusion and law terms that left me freaked out. I would recommend Erika to ANYONE who needs help with a work comp system!\"\n\n\"Matt handled my Worker's Comp case and I couldn't be more pleased with his representation! He listened to my situation, was completely upfront about his fees, and explained the process thoroughly. He didn't mislead me on the amount that could be expected, he didn't drag out the case, and he gave honest assessments and legal advice as the case progressed. He is very nice and easy to work with. My wife and I felt comfortable with him, and didn't feel pressured into anything. With his expertise I am finally able to put all this behind me. I would highly recommend Matt O'Brien and the firm of Alverson + O'Brien!\"\n\n\"Matt O'Brien, what can I say. Well, first off I think the O in O'Brien is for OUTSTANDING! When I called Matt I was so upset and sick of being told \"no can't help you\" by lawyers that were either scared or didn't think they could help me out. My case was simple but really factually confusing at the same time. Now Matt took the time to hear me out and decided to take a chance on my case. Matt was very up front and answered all of this old country boy from East Texas' questions, which was probably a 100 if not more. Matt explained everything in a way that I could understand. My case was denied by the insurance company and we had to go to Court to try to prove my case. Boy did Matt surprise me at the hearing. Don't know if I can say this but he is a bad a-- lawyer. I left the Court hearing knowing that I had hired the right man for my case. And trust me, he is the man for you as well!!! Now when you've just about sold or lost everything and think he is just sitting up there in his office and don't care, well you'll be wrong. He is a very nice man but can be very aggressive where need be. I say you can't go wrong with Matt and this law firm. In my eyes he's the best damn lawyer up there!\"\n\n\"I had called a different law firm about my case and they didn't have the decency to call me back and let me know they where not taking my case, How ever when I called Erika I was very skeptic and told her what had happened with the first one I had called, but Erika from the start had told me she could and would be able to do something for me and would always keep me informed and she did just that. Thank You!\"\n\n\"The first time I went to see Ericka I knew that she was confident, knowledgeable and cared about her clients. She proved to me that all this is true. She always kept me informed and answered any questions and concerns that I had during this long process and waiting that it takes for Social Security Disability Claims. I would recommend her very highly. My case was awarded the same day as my hearing. I am very grateful to her and her staff for being so professional and caring at the same time.\"\n\n\"After a very long process of shopping around for a solid, honest lawyer who was willing to take on my very difficult work comp case, I found Erika and she has been incredible! From the very beginning, she has honest and up front and willing to fight for me. Erika and her firm have been extremely professional, thorough and efficient with everything. I couldn't have asked for a better attorney representing me. I have and will continue to recommend Erika and her firm. I can't seem to thank them enough for all the time and hard work they have invested in my case.\"\n\n\"It is my pleasure to recommend my attorney Matt O'Brien, as well as his knowledgeable staff. Matt and his staff are professional, cordial and very competent! Not only did they settle my case, but they settled it quickly! Matt and Brittany were candid and precise about my case. They didnt \"string\" me along or say one thing and it turn out something else. They kept me informed and when I had questioned they respond in a timely and professional manner.Matt is a \"straight shooter\" that I can RESPECT and TRUST! I made him my attorney and I recommend you make him yours!\"\n\n\"I chose Mr O'Brien to represent me on my social security disability case. At our first meeting, I had a positive feeling about him and his staff, you know sometimes you can feel if something is right. He was very honest and forthright with me and did not make any unrealistic promises. My case was particularly difficult since it was not a physical condition. I found Matt to be very compassionate and genuinely concerned about my feelings and helped me to feel comfortable during the hearing. His assistant was also great and professional. I would highly recommend Matt if you are looking for a honest, friendly yet experienced attorney.\""
