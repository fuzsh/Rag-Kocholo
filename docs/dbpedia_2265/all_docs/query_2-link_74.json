        "text": "While college football now largely revolves around a 12-team College Football Playoff and nine conference title races, state bragging rights are still a thing. In some cases, they mean more to fans than just about anything else.\n\nFor teams that have been eliminated from league title or CFP contention, state supremacy can be a carrot at the season's end. Take the last week of the 2024 regular season, for example. Here are the in-state matchups set for that week involving Power Four teams:\n\nMississippi State at Ole Miss\n\nGeorgia Tech at Georgia\n\nLouisville at Kentucky\n\nTexas at Texas A&M\n\nAuburn at Alabama\n\nTennessee at Vanderbilt\n\nNC State at North Carolina\n\nArizona State at Arizona\n\nDuke at Wake Forest\n\nSouth Carolina at Clemson\n\nPurdue at Indiana\n\nIllinois vs. Northwestern\n\nVirginia at Virginia Tech\n\nFlorida at Florida State\n\nOnly a handful of these games will likely impact conference title races or the CFP picture, but all will have plenty at stake. These intra-state contests are the essence of college football. They pit friends, neighbors and even family members against each other in friendly — and sometimes not-so-friendly — competition.\n\nAs the 2024 season creeps closer, let's take a look at the best college football team in each state.\n\nBest college football team in each state\n\nAlabama -- Alabama: The Crimson Tide lost Nick Saban, but they didn't lose their state supremacy. Alabama has won four straight Iron Bowl matchups and should remain ahead of Auburn in the pecking order as the Tigers look for their footing under Hugh Freeze.\n\nAlaska -- n/a\n\nArizona -- Arizona: The Wildcats crushed Arizona State 59-23 last season and look better positioned for the Big 12 transition than the Sun Devils. Though coach Jedd Fisch left the Wildcats for Washington, Arizona returns key players on both sides of the football.\n\nArkansas -- Arkansas: Arkansas State could make this interesting. The Red Wolves returned to a bowl last season behind the play of promising quarterback Jaylen Raynor, but the Razorbacks would still be heavily favored on a neutral field.\n\nCalifornia -- USC: For a state with seven FBS programs, there isn't a particularly appealing candidate. Four of those teams are undergoing coaching transitions in 2024. USC edged Cal 50-49 last season and gets the nod, though not by much.\n\nColorado -- Air Force: Air Force has won 29 games over the past three seasons under coach Troy Calhoun, who is entering Year 18 on the job. Meanwhile, Colorado could be in for a tough transition year in the Big 12. The Falcons continue flying above the Buffaloes and Colorado State.\n\nConnecticut -- UConn: UConn narrowly edges Yale, which finished 7-3 at the FCS level in 2023. The Huskies were just 3-9 last season but maintain the top spot in the state largely by virtue of their status as the only FBS program. The last time UConn and Yale played in 2021, the Huskies squeaked out a 21-15 victory.\n\nDelaware -- Delaware: Delaware finished 9-4 in 2023 with a second-round exit in the FCS playoffs. The only other Division I program in the state is Delaware State, which finished 1-10 last season.\n\nFlorida -- Florida State: Florida State finished 13-1 in 2023, posting its best season since winning the 2014 national title. Though the Seminoles were snubbed from the College Football Playoff, they proved to be the state's top team by a wide margin. Expectations are high at Miami this season, but the Hurricanes have ground to make up after a 12-13 beginning to coach Mario Cristobal's tenure.\n\nGeorgia -- Georgia: Georgia is 42-2 over the past three seasons and 24-0 in regular-season SEC play during that span. The Bulldogs have also won six straight over Georgia Tech. Despite a tough schedule, they should clearly be the best team in the Peach State again in 2024.\n\nHawaii -- Hawaii: There is literally no competition for Hawaii, which improved from 3-10 in 2022 to 5-8 in 2023 during coach Timmy Chang's second season. Another year of progress will get the Rainbow Warriors back to a bowl for the first time since 2020.\n\nIdaho -- Boise State: Even when things go wrong, Boise State still finds a way to compete for the Mountain West title. The Broncos won the league in 2023 despite finishing the season under interim coach Spencer Danielson, who earned the full-time job with his performance.\n\nIllinois -- Northwestern: Northwestern emerged as an unlikely success story in 2023 under interim coach David Braun following the dismissal of program legend Pat Fitzgerald. The Wildcats beat Illinois 45-43 in the regular season finale to cement their claim for the state title and deny the Fighting Illini a bowl bid.\n\nIndiana -- Notre Dame: This was an easy choice as Indiana and Purdue won just three and four games, respectively, in 2023. Notre Dame went 10-3 and is poised to challenge for a CFP bid in coach Marcus Freeman's third season.\n\nIowa -- Iowa: Iowa State is a dark-horse Big 12 title contender and will pose a formidable challenge to Iowa in Week 2. But the Cyclones are still looking up at the Hawkeyes, who have won seven of the past eight in the series. With three 10-win seasons in the past five years and a favorable 2024 schedule, the Hawkeyes are in line for another strong season.\n\nKansas -- Kansas State: Both Kansas and Kansas State finished 9-4 in 2023, but K-State gets the nod. The Wildcats have won 15 straight in the series and are picked to finish second in the Big 12 this season. The Jayhawks aren't far behind -- picked to finish fourth -- but need to break through for a victory in the Sunflower Showdown before they can claim the No. 1 spot in the state.\n\nKentucky -- Kentucky: Louisville won 10 games in 2023 compared to Kentucky's seven. But when the Wildcats visited the 'Ville in the regular-season finale, they left with a 38-31 victory for their fifth straight win in the series. Jeff Brohm has the Cardinals on the rise, but Mark Stoops' program hasn't been usurped just yet.\n\nLouisiana -- LSU: LSU is on strong footing in the state after consecutive 10-win seasons to begin coach Brian Kelly's tenure. If Willie Fritz had stayed at Tulane instead of leaving for Houston after a 23-5 run over the past two seasons, the Green Wave would have a more compelling case.\n\nMaine -- Maine: Maine went 2-9 last season, but there is no Division I competition in the state. Honorable mention goes to Division III University of New England, which finished 6-4 in 2023.\n\nMaryland -- Maryland: Maryland has won bowl games in three straight seasons under coach Mike Locksley. In-state competitor Navy is coming off a fourth consecutive losing season.\n\nMassachusetts -- Boston College: Boston College bounced back from a 3-9 season in 2022 by going 7-6 with a Fenway Bowl victory before Jeff Hafley left to become defensive coordinator of the Green Bay Packers. With ex-Penn State and Houston Texans coach Bill O'Brien stepping in, the Eagles should have no problem staying ahead of UMass.\n\nMichigan -- Michigan: Michigan won the national championship and Michigan State fired its coach amid an ugly off-field scandal before stumbling to a 4-8 finish. In case you're still not convinced, the Wolverines won 49-0 on the Spartans' home field. Perhaps coaching changes at both programs alter things moving forward. For now, it's a lopsided debate.\n\nMinnesota -- Minnesota: Keep an eye on St. Thomas, which is off to a strong start early in its FCS tenure. But P.J. Fleck would have to row Minnesota's boat over a waterfall for the Gophers to lose their state crown.\n\nMississippi -- Ole Miss: Ole Miss is back on top of the Magnolia State after amassing a school-record 11 victories, including a 17-7 win over Mississippi State. The Bulldogs missed a bowl for the first time since 2009. The Rebels will be tough to dethrone as Lane Kiffin looks to reach the 10-win mark for the third time in the past four years.\n\nMissouri -- Missouri: There is no competition to speak of, but for good measure, Missouri went 11-2 in 2023 with a Cotton Bowl victory over Ohio State as coach Eli Drinkwitz finally achieved a long-awaited breakthrough. The Tigers are expected to compete for a CFP bid in 2024.\n\nMontana -- Montana: Montana and Montana State are both strong FCS programs. But Montana won the head-to-head meeting 37-7 and reached the FCS title game last season. That's enough for the Griz to reclaim state bragging rights from the Bobcats ... for now.\n\nNebraska -- Nebraska: Nebraska should be glad there are no other Division I teams in the state because it wouldn't have taken much to dethrone the woebegone Cornhuskers over the past seven years.\n\nNevada -- UNLV: Barry Odom crushed it in Year 1 at UNLV, guiding the Rebels to a 45-27 win over Nevada and an appearance in the Mountain West Championship Game. Nevada is rebooting under new coach Jeff Choate.\n\nNew Hampshire -- New Hampshire: This one is quite close. Dartmouth and New Hampshire both finished with six wins at the FCS level last season. However, it was New Hampshire that captured a 24-7 head-to-head victory. Unfortunately, the two teams aren't scheduled to play this season.\n\nNew Jersey -- Rutgers: Things are looking good for Rutgers after a 7-6 season capped by a Pinstripe Bowl victory. The Scarlet Knights return a strong nucleus and don't play Ohio State, Michigan or Penn State this season.\n\nNew Mexico -- New Mexico State: New Mexico State has the edge for now after going 10-5 and beating New Mexico 27-17 last year. But 2024 marks a new era for the rivalry as both programs welcome new coaches.\n\nNew York -- Syracuse: Army has been treading water at 6-6 the past two years and lost 29-16 to Syracuse last season. Thus, it's the Orange who take the crown with new coach Fran Brown providing a jolt for the program.\n\nNorth Carolina -- NC State: NC State is on stable footing under coach Dave Doreen after closing the 2023 regular season with five straight victories, including wins over in-state foes Wake Forest and North Carolina. Duke's loss of coach Mike Elko to Texas A&M ruined its chances of taking the crown.\n\nNorth Dakota -- North Dakota State: North Dakota knocked off North Dakota State 49-24 last season to snap a five-game losing streak in the rivalry. However, North Dakota bowed out in the first round of the FCS playoffs while North Dakota State reached the semifinals. If the Fighting Hawks can go back-to-back against the Bison, perhaps they'll get the nod next year.\n\nOhio -- Ohio State: Ohio State loaded up on transfer talent and is a Tier 1 national title contender entering a critical sixth season for coach Ryan Day. The Buckeyes own the state and will be hoping they own the nation at season's end.\n\nOklahoma -- Oklahoma State: Oklahoma State won the final Bedlam game for the foreseeable future when it bested Oklahoma 27-24 last season. The Cowboys are legitimate Big 12 title contenders this season while the Sooners face a tough schedule in their debut SEC campaign.\n\nOregon -- Oregon: Oregon beat Oregon State 31-7 last season before leaving the Beavers behind and heading to the Big Ten. The schools are set to continue playing for at least the next two seasons. But with the Beavers lost in conference realignment, the state belongs to the Ducks.\n\nPennsylvania -- Penn State: Penn State is a benefactor in conference realignment as it will no longer be required to face both Michigan and Ohio State annually. The shuffled conference and expanded playoff bring new possibilities for the Nittany Lions. Meanwhile, Pitt is coming off a rare down season under 10th-year coach Pat Narduzzi.\n\nRhode Island -- Rhode Island: Rhode Island beat Bryant and Brown last season to claim state bragging rights. The Rams are playing both in-state foes again this season as they seek to remain the top dog in the country's smallest state.\n\nSouth Carolina -- Clemson: Clemson avenged a 2022 defeat against South Carolina by besting the Gamecocks 16-7 last season. The Tigers have slipped a bit since their last national title in 2018, but they are still the Palmetto State's premier program.\n\nSouth Dakota -- South Dakota State: South Dakota State tore through the FCS playoffs with four double-digit victories to claim the program's second consecutive national title. South Dakota is a formidable foe, but the Jackrabbits won the head-to-head meeting 37-3.\n\nTennessee -- Tennessee: It's a tight race between Tennessee and Memphis. Both teams have CFP aspirations in 2024, but the Volunteers get the nod since they are 20-6 over the past two seasons. Memphis hit 10 wins for the first time under coach Ryan Silverfield last season, but the Tigers need to stack successful campaigns before overtaking a Tennessee program that finally appears to have found stability under Josh Heupel.\n\nTexas -- Texas: Texas is back! No, really. The Longhorns won the Big 12 and reached the CFP last season. Now, they enter the SEC with lofty aspirations while Texas A&M undergoes a coaching transition. Baylor and TCU were down in 2023, and Texas Tech is well behind UT. A dark horse to watch is SMU, which enters the ACC after an 11-3 season.\n\nUtah -- Utah: BYU and Utah are set to resume their series as Big 12 foes this season after last playing in 2021. The Cougars have a lot of ground to make up before they can dethrone the Utes as the top dog in the state.\n\nVermont -- n/a\n\nVirginia -- Liberty: Liberty went 13-1 in 2023 and is aiming to be the Group of Five's CFP representative. Doing so will likely require a 13-0 record since the Flames play a ridiculously soft schedule. James Madison has a case, but the Dukes are breaking in a new coach. If Virginia Tech has the type of season Hokies fans are expecting, it could be their state at season's end. For now, the Flames are the state's hottest team.\n\nWashington -- Washington: Washington is heading for a drop-off following Kalen DeBoer's departure to Alabama. However, landing Jedd Fisch from Arizona was a solid hire that will keep the Huskies ahead of a homeless Washington State program as conference realignment takes hold.\n\nWest Virginia -- West Virginia: West Virginia won five of its final six games in 2023 -- including a convincing Duke's Mayo Bowl victory over North Carolina -- to finish 9-4 in coach Neal Brown's fifth season. Thus, the Mountaineers have reclaimed the state crown from Marshall, which went 6-7 last season.\n\nWisconsin -- Wisconsin: Wisconsin is searching for direction under second-year coach Luke Fickell after a debut 7-6 campaign. But with no competition in the state, the Badgers retain state supremacy by default."
