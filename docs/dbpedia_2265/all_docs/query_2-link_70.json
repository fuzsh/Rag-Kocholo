        "text": "Erin Laura (O’Brien) Pfannenstiel, age 32, was born June 2, 1988 in Lakeville, MN and passed away suddenly November 17, 2020. Erin lived her life amplified. She loved hard and fast — poised and wild, with a bigger spirit than this world could contain. Her love for animals and people alike was always the center of her world. Her life was centered on making sure her family, friends and animals had a wonderful life and amazing experiences. Erin loved to sing, dance, and entertain and planted seeds of joy everywhere. Erin easily made friends and new family wherever she went, which is evident from her loved ones far and wide. She loved to host and cook for loved ones and always made everyone feel welcome and loved. Her smile would light up rooms and hearts. Her passing will leave a void in many of our lives. Erin grew up in Lakeville, Minnesota where she spent her days cultivating adventure, taking chances and becoming the independent and confident woman we all love. Erin began riding horses at age 3, which became a lifelong passion. Her childhood was filled with beloved animals including birds, rats, cats, dogs, and horses. Erin grew up with her horse, Val, who is as loyal, loving and bold as her — a true lifelong pair. Erin made many friends in her childhood who hold fond memories of her and have continued their friendships despite time and distance apart. Erin always had a giving heart and a deep love for her family. As a young woman, she lost her mother and continued to live life to the fullest and made her mother incredibly proud of the independent, strong and feisty woman she grew into. Erin moved to Colorado to seek out adventure, nature, and the Mountain West she so loved. She thrived in her new environment, making new friends, tackling challenges head on and building a full and colorful life. On August 31, 2013 Erin married the love of her life, Jamie Pfannenstiel, he survives. As an adult, Erin settled into a life of joy filled with animals, food, and friends. She cared for her daughter, home and husband, Jamie, with beauty and grace. As a family they enjoyed home cooked meals from around the world, spending time outdoors, and loved vacationing on the beach. Erin and Ruby spent time together training and riding horses, caring for dogs, and dancing around the living room. She ensured that her family stayed close and helped support a strong bond between both of her children, Brian and Ruby, as well as Brian’s adoptive parents, Jaime and Joe, and Brian’s siblings, Josie and Katy. Her sacrifices for her children were many and large, but she always did what was best for each of them with a full heart. Erin worked as a vet tech, hard-working ranch hand, and ran a small pet care business ensuring her family home was overflowing with love and affection. Her clients — both 2- and 4-legged — trusted and loved her for her diligent and warm care. Erin also continued to be involved with horses in multiple ways including training horses, trail-riding, cow roundups, and continuing to care for her horse soulmate, Val. Erin has taught us to live wildly, love fiercely, eat amazing food, give a little extra love and affection, and to wake up each morning with a sense of curiosity and wonder. Her presence, cooking, laughter, songs, and joy will be missed by many. Erin is survived by her husband, Jamie, Parker CO., daughter Ruby of the home, son Brian, Minneapolis, MN, her father Steve O’Brien and his partner Candace O’Rourke, Grand Junction CO., her grandparents, Gertrude O’Brien, Bloomington MN and Lila Kersey, 50 Lakes, MN and many friends and family who will greatly miss her. Erin was preceded in death by her mother, Linda O’Brien, many beloved friends and animals that will greet and surround her with love on the other side, until we meet again. Due to COVID, a memorial service will be held at a later date. Memorials may be made in care of Parker Funeral Home, 10325 Parkglenn Way, Parker CO 80138.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Erin Laura Pfannenstiel, please visit our floral store."
