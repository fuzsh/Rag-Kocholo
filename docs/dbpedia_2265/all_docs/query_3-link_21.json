        "text": "Tributes To Brian:\n\nClive Neal\n\nProfessor of Planetary Geology\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nFellow Lunatics: I regret to inform you that another Apollo era icon has left us. Brian’s passion for the Moon and lunar dust has left an indelible impression on our community. I had the honor to visit with him in Perth a few years ago and me him and his good lady wife - I hope I have his level of passion for the Moon and my science when I reach that stage of my life. Personally, I will miss his no-messing and direct interactions, and his phone calls. For those of you who never met Brian, his website can be found here. Ad luna, Brian! And thank you. Clive\n\nKirby Daniel Runyon\n\nSenior Staff Scientist, Planetary Geology & Exploration Johns HopkinsUniversity\n\nSorry to hear that. I saw him in person in Feb. during the lunar dust workshop at LPI! I feel lucky to have at least been around him.\n\nBernard Foing\n\nExecutive Director of the international lunar exploration working group\n\nWe had memorable interactions with Brian O'Brien when he was presenting his historical experiment and more recent work at some events we organised in Europe and elsewhere. He was very passionate about the Moon and always reminded us not to forget about the dust ! Thank you Brian\n\nPhilip Metzger\n\nPhD Planetary Scientist Florida Space Institute\n\nUniversity of Central Florida\n\nI will miss Brian, too. I got to know him when he contacted NASA around 2007 or 2009 after finding Apollo data tapes in a cardboard box at his university in Australia. That triggered an emergency meeting inside NASA to decide what to do — Is it true: did Brian really find old Apollo tapes? Are they really the only surviving copies in existence? How do we even read such old tapes? How badly do we need the data? How do we respond to Brian? After that meeting, I called Brian because we DID need the data as we were planning the Constellation program.\n\nBrian and I have had a long-running conversation ever since. He was a tireless champion of the Apollo Dust Detector Experiment (DDE) and its results. His original work during Apollo was prematurely shut down by NASA after someone decided dust “wasn’t a problem”, so he never did a fully detailed analysis of the DDE data until after his recent discovery of the tapes. That led to a distinctly separate, second period of productivity on lunar dust in his career. He was very late in life when that second phase began, but he had a lot of passion.\n\nIt was fascinating how much information he teased from those tapes. He correlated events in the data to Lunar Module Ascent Stage departure and to the sunrises over the next few lunations. With every new discovery he would call me and Jim Gaier and others to discuss what it meant.\n\nI will mention that he made (what turned out to be) a controversial discovery of a “dust storm” that occurred with each of the first few sunrises after the crew's departure. I think this is controversial only because many have misunderstood his claim. He is not saying that “dust storms” are a regular and natural part of the lunar environment. Instead, he is saying that the mission itself mechanically disturbed the dust — boots, rover wheels, plume ejecta, etc. — and that put the dust into an unnatural state where it was not stabilized against electrostatic levitation. Then, it took several passages of the terminator for the dust to move around before it was resettled into a natural state again and stopped moving. His data showed that these “dust storms” tapered off quickly with each successive lunation. In fact, the fact that the storms were tapering actually confirms the belief that large-scale dust storms are not a regular part of the lunar environment. Instead, they are just a localized, mission-induced event. (By extension, they must also be an impact-generated event, so they would be natural after impacts, still localized and temporary.) Also, he is not saying the dust travels high above the surface, but rather about 1 meter high in the vicinity of the mission, according to the measurements of the DDE as the sun peeped up over the dust into the sensor.\n\nIt is of course possible his interpretation is wrong, but after reading his papers carefully and looking at the data he sent I am persuaded it is correct. I think Brian's discovery of these disturbance-generated, localized dust events will be one of the long-lasting things he bequeathed to lunar exploration. After we validate their existence via the upcoming missions, we will know that all our operations on the Moon will similarly disturb dust in a way that creates additional, small-scale, localized dust events with each terminator passage. That means we will need to design our hardware, operations, and science measurements to take them into account.\n\nAnd of course the phenomenon (if real) needs to be named, so you can guess who I am thinking they should be named after.\n\nAd luna, Brian.\n\nPhil\n\nHarrison “Jack” Schmitt\n\nAPOLLO 17 Astronaut\n\nNicely said, Phil. Although Brian and I carried on a debate for many years about lunar dust levitation, I also will miss his passion in the course of that debate.\n\nJack\n\nRob Mueller\n\nSwamp Works\n\nNASA KSC\n\nI met Brian at several conferences over the years and I can attest to his passion for the Moon and dust phenomena. He was trying to find a way to get funding to work on it but I think he worked on the data regardless.\n\nThank you Brian for all you did - time to pass the torch.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nRob Mueller\n\nRoberto Bugiolacchi\n\nState Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences\n\n3rd of January 2019, I post on this forum a little notice announcing the landing of the Chinese Chang'e-4 on the lunar farside. I am 'stationed' in Macao, Southern China.\n\nMy office phone has been untroubled by outside calls for years, but on that day, it rang. It's a distant call, crackling line in a way that brought back memories of dodgy landlines.\n\nI heard a voice saying something like ... \"I am Brian, I am Brian\", and I thought it was a prank call at first. Then the caller introduced himself as a modest student candidate would: I did this, a bit of that, \"Apollo\" was mentioned, and to my immense ignorance, I still did not have a clue who this person was. But he was extremely polite, well-wishing, asking me many questions, why I was working there, etc. A very pleasant conversation. Soon after, I received an email from him with his seminal papers and his unpublished work. And then we talked about potential future collaborations and I stop here.\n\nHis modesty and humbleness were astonishing, typical of all the men and women of value I had the pleasure to meet in my life. On this forum, we heard accounts from close friends and collaborators who rightly shared incredible life stories and touching accounts. I understand my contribution to be marginal and fleeting. But the value of a person is often revealed more by little gestures than grand achievements.\n\nI just wanted to share my encounter.\n\nRoberto\n\nDonald C. Barker\n\nx-EMU Architecture Lead\n\nI had the distinct pleasure of corresponding with Brian throughout 2019 regarding dust adhesion, which influenced one of my current projects for testing materials and stimulants for their adhesive characteristics. I will eventually be making some comparisons regarding his Apollo DDE experiment as he had suggested. I also had the pleasure of taking dinner with him and Ros the last night of the Dust conference in Houston in February. His enthusiasm at the meting was infectious. We appreciate your tenacity and exuberance in our lunar exploration endeavors. Best Wishes to Ros and their family.\n\nDon Barker\n\nJim Gaier\n\nNASA Scientist\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I reflect on the life of Brian O’Brian, my colleague, collaborator, and friend. Although his passing was not totally unexpected, he had written to me a few times about his ongoing health struggles since returning to Australia of the LPI Dust Workshop in February, it was still a shock.\n\nAnyone who knew Brian even casually could tell you he was not exactly a “go along to get along” kind of guy. Because of his high standards for data, he butted heads regularly with the prevailing opinions on the importance and interactions of lunar dust, and usually prevailed. This began early in his career when he insisted that he needed to be able to quantify the amount of dust in the lunar environment because it would affect the results of the CPLEE experiment. He designed a small, compact, simple instrument that became the Dust Detector Experiment (DDE) and convinced NASA to add it to several of the ALSEP packages – though in a modified form for all but Apollo 12. Those involved in instrument development can perhaps appreciate how difficult it would be to design, have built, and add a new instrument part way through a flight program. I think this was perhaps his proudest achievement, and data from these instruments became the starting point for all his future work on lunar dust.\n\nHe was also at odds with the establishment when the official science reports indicated, according to the DDE, that the launch of the ascent stage of the LEM did not result in changes in the dust environment. He wrote what was in essence a dissenting opinion, backed up with DDE measurements that was published in the Journal of Applied Physics, but was dismayed that it was nearly ignored by the community. Even at the last meeting he attended, he continued pushing to correct the official historical record.\n\nHis interest was reignited when he learned that his copies of Apollo data tapes were, after 40 years, perhaps the only ones left, and yet he could not acquire funding to have them restored and read. So with no outside funding support he began a long quest that resulted in a remarkable series of papers and presentations based on the analysis of the DDE data at high resolution. His insights have sparked controversy about the motion of lunar dust and how it is affected by lunar surface operations that has broad application not only for lunar exploration, but for the exploration of airless bodies everywhere.\n\nBrian was a remarkable and meticulous scientist who did much of his best work at an age long after most of us retire. He is an inspiration to all who value rigorous science, and to those of us who think we are \"over the hill\". He will be missed.\n\nJim Gaier NASA Retired\n\nProf Brian J O'Brien - NASA Principal Investigator - Lunar Dust Expert"
