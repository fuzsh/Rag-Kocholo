        "text": "“We discovered Brian through watching YouTube videos from another brick enthusiast content creation group, but we liked Brian the best of all! When he broke from the group to make his own content, I was thrilled. My child has been watching Brian for years. It’s almost like he is a personal friend. I never had any qualms allowing my child to watch Brian’s content because I know it is always positive and appropriate. It makes me proud to support an up-and-coming content creator, and my child gains so much. He has told me he continues to watch Brian because Brian never makes him feel bad or sad. He is always upbeat, encouraging, and funny. I also love that he created a Mom Squad to get feedback from parents of his viewers. We get to interact directly with Brian and other parents. When most content creators would rather push the young viewers away, Brian leaned into it and is wildly successful at inspiring and entertaining children, creating family-friendly content, and overall just being awesome! Thanks for everything, Brian!”\n\n— Ashley\n\n“We love Bricks 'O’ Brian! Brian Saviano is an awesome human and I can be confident that his content is fun and appropriate for my kids. We've watched a lot together and his play-through videos of games we have are both helpful and entertaining. Brian's humor is right on par with our family, so he's funny for both the kids and the adults. As kids tend to do, my kids repeat things Brian says on his videos, and I'm grateful to know that they're not going to be repeating profanity or anything inappropriate. At this point Brian is a household name, my kids talk about him like he's part of our family. Thanks for being the coolest, Brian!”\n\n— Rachel, parent of kids aged 10 and 6"
