        "text": "Hubert F. O’Brien was born on May 20th, 1930 in Millnaughton, Kiltoom, Athlone, County Roscommon. He passed away peacefully on January 16 th, 2024.\n\nHe was 1 of 11 children and the 7th consecutive son born to Hubert F. O’Brien & Bridget (Rush). He went to work very early in his life in Dublin right after WW2. Leaving home at the tender age of 15. He spent a few years there, left for England in 1948. And ultimately emigrated to the USA in June of 1954.\n\nIn six short years he went from immigrant to US citizen and business owner as he operated O'Brien's Bar in Washington Heights alongside his younger brother Christopher… their partnership would grow to 4 Taverns most notably the Tower View in East Durham NY.\n\nIn East Durham Dad would meet & court the love of his life Eileen McIntyre. The courtship began as a friendship and culminated in their marriage on June 27th, 1964. This union would result in 4 children & 13 Grandchildren and the love affair would remain until Eileen’s death in September of 2020.\n\nDad was an extremely hard worker & dedicated employee. As his children came along he left bar ownership for more traditional work & hours. He worked for at the John Barleycorn for 20 plus years. His entrepreneurial interest led to have a side painting business and renovating homes.\n\nHe was driven in all things.\n\nHe stressed education above all and he read voraciously. He loved history, in particular both Irish & American history and especially where they intersected.\n\nHe was an athlete. A talented runner in his youth. He won the Birmingham England mile in 1950 with a time of 4:24. He rediscovered running after the age of 55. He completed 5 NY City Marathons. Running a sub 4 hour race at 60 years of age. He had true grit & mental toughness.\n\nDad was all about Family, friends & neighbors.\n\nHis considerable talents & energy went into his family. His children Kevin (Laura), Maureen, Hubert (Tara) & Erin (David Bergerson) and his 13 grandchildren Megan, Ellie, Peter, Aidan, Bridget, Brett, Timothy, Maeve, Kyle, Liam, Katherine, Hubert & Eileen along with much loved wife Eileen were the cornerstone of his life.\n\nA large number of nieces & nephews would come to stay with him over the years. He truly believed that it was his Christian duty to extend himself to help to repay the kindness he had received when he arrived in the US back in 1954\n\nHe led a truly decent life filled with humility & Christian values. He often went above & beyond. The last years though filled with illness did not diminish his memorable spirit. It was always present. The last (4) years his daughter Maureen put her life on hold to take care of his every need virtually round the clock. Her love and care gave his final days the dignity he had well earned.\n\nHe will never be forgotten for all he did for so many and so often quietly with no fanfare.\n\nReposing Sunday, January 21 th 2024 from 1 - 5 pm at Riverdale-on-Hudson Funeral Home, 6110 Riverdale Avenue, Bronx NY. Mass of Christian burial will be 9:45 am Monday, January 22 th, at St. Margaret of Cortona Church.
