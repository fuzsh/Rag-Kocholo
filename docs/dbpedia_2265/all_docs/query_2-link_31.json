        "text": "About The High Kings\n\nThe High Kings are Finbarr Clancy, Darren Holden, Paul O'Brien, and Brian Dunphy who have held the position as the distinctive voice of Irish folk music across the world for the last 15 years.\n\nAnd as they continue to sell out venues around the world to an ever-growing army of loyal fans The High Kings show no signs of stopping.\n\nHaving already surpassed 1.5 million monthly listeners on Spotify as well as 2 platinum albums in their time, 2023 saw The High Kings celebrate 15 years together by releasing 15 brand new tracks to their fans, as well as the release of their, 8th Studio Album, \"The Road Not Taken.\"\n\nRenowned for their captivating harmonies and timeless melodies, The High Kings' eighth studio album is a collection of original songs that breathe new life into traditional folk music, blending the old with the new.\n\nAs they continue to go from strength to strength The High Kings remain firmly rooted in Irish tradition and classic folk music and their brand-new tour will be a feast of well-known hits and spectacular musicianship, and they look forward to seeing you soon.\n\nAbout Gaelic Storm\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a band just coming into their own after 20 years of success, but that’s exactly what makes a true anomaly. This multi-national, Celtic juggernaut grows stronger with each live performance, and as you can imagine, after two decades and over 2000 shows, it is a true force to be reckoned with. With their latest release, Go Climb a Tree, their music has never sounded more representative of themselves as musicians and as live performers.\n\nThe band attributes their continued success to their fanatic audience, and it’s a well-diversified crowd for sure. The country-music folks adore the storytelling, the bluegrass-heads love the instrumentals, Celtic fans love their devotion to tradition, and the rockers simply relish the passion they play their instruments with. Each band member, in their own way, expresses a deep gratitude for their fans, but it’s best summed up in the words of Patrick Murphy: “The fans are the ones that have given us this life. We’re here for them.”\n\nGaelic Storm takes a true blue-collar, hard-nose approach to touring, consistently traveling the US and internationally over 200 days a year, forging a unique path in the Celtic music world. “You have to see us live. We are the true working-mans’ band,” says Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. “We still, and most likely always will, tour most of the year, and that’s how we constantly hone our craft.”\n\nLooking to the future, Gaelic Storm is excited about what lies ahead. In 2022, they were excited to welcome Natalya Kay, an incredible fiddler hailing from Western Massachusetts, but living now in Music City, Nashville, TN. Natalya's energy and presence on stage has been a force to be reckoned with."
