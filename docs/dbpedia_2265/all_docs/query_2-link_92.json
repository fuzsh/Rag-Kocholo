        "meta_description": "Hello -- I'm researching family history for my brother-in-law's family and tryiing to find out what I can about the O'Brian family in Kildino, Co.Limerick. His gr-grandmother was Aileen O'Brian, born 29 Jun 1886. She arrived in the U.S.. in February of 1909. I do not know her parents' names, but I know that O'Brians still lived on the family farm during the lifetime of her daughter, Margaret Shawyer, as Margaret (Peggie) was known to write to individuals there at this address: Ballycalhane / Kildino / Co.Limerick.",

        "text": "Janet:\n\nWelcome to Ireland Reaching Out!\n\nI located the 1901 and 1911 census records for the family in Ballyculhane townland in Kildimo civil parish. You posted the message in Ballycahane parish which is separate from Kildimo. You may want to \"join\" the Kildimo parish but no need to post another message.\n\nAileen was shown as Ellen in the 1901 census. In 1911, the family filed the return in Gaelic. A number of families did use Gaelic in 1911 which was much more in vogue in the early part of the 20th century. In addiition to Michael and Margaret, their son Michael and daughter Mary were living with them plus a servant Margaret O'Brien. Not sure how she was related.\n\nhttp://census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Limerick/Ballynacarriga/Ba…\n\nhttp://census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Limerick/Ballynacarriga/Ba…\n\nMichael and Margaret O'Kennedy were married January 26, 1876 in the Shanagolden RC church. Below is a transcription of the civil marriage record which shows the names of the fathers of Michael and Margaret. Margaret was from Corbally townland in Shanagolden civil parish.\n\nRoger McDonnell\n\nDate of Marriage:25-Jan-1876\n\nParish / District:SHANAGOLDEN\n\nCounty:Co. Limerick\n\nHusband MichaelO'Brien Address Kildimo\n\nWife MargaretO'KennedyAddress:Corbally\n\nHusband's Father DenisO'Brien\n\nWife's Father DanielO'Kennedy\n\nJanet,\n\nIn addition to the information Roger has posted, if you click on the household return link in the 1911 census, you will see that Michael & Margaret had had 7 children, 5 of which were still alive in 1911.\n\nMargaret O’Brien died at Ballyculhane on 13.5.1936. Her son Michael, of the same townland was the informant.\n\nhttps://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/deaths_returns/deaths_1936/04802/4291946.pdf\n\nHusband Michael pre-deceased her on 15.11.1914. There appears to be a will for him in the National Archives in Dublin.\n\nWe know from the 1876 marriage that Michael’s father was Denis O’Brien. Griffiths Valuation for 1850 lists Denis in Ballyculhane. He was farming plot 14b. He had a half share of 54 acres. The other half was held by James O’Brien. A brother perhaps? Next door on plot 13 was a Patrick O’Brien who is presumably also related.\n\nIn 1901 there were 2 O’Brien farms in the townland:\n\nhttp://census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Limerick/Ballynacarriga/Ballyculhane/\n\nLikewise in 1911. Here’s the second:\n\nhttp://census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Limerick/Ballynacarriga/Ballyculhane/640706/\n\nThe tithe applotment records for the townland in 1825 list 4 O’Brien farms there: Pat, Daniel, James and Des(mond).\n\nhttp://titheapplotmentbooks.nationalarchives.ie/search/tab/home.jsp\n\nI noticed this recent death notice which indicates there are still O’Briens living there today:\n\nhttps://inotices.ie/micelobrien338198665\n\nNot sure if anyone will read this. I was doing research for an article I am writing about my grandfather's recent funeral a few weeks ago and this job posting popped up. My grandmother was Margaret (Peggy) O'Brien. She was one of 5 children of the O'Briens at Ballycalhane in Kildimo of that generation. I had tea with Denis O'Brien. They have a house next to the O'Brien farm. It still operates today making dairy products. One of the millenial boys lives in the house now, but, that is temporary. Michael and Ailee recently passed in the last couple of years. I saw their grave when we buried my grandfather. We will be moving my grandmother next to him.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more. Email me, ajschoenster@gmail.com. I live in Denver, Colorado. We have family all over the world. Canada, Australia, America, Spain, Ireland, etcetera.\n\nThanks!\n\nDrew Schoenster"
