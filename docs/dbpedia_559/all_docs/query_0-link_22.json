        "text": "SUMMARY The idea of revival of the Olympic Games appeared much before its realization, but creation of the possibilities to reintroduce the Games was closely related to development of modern sport.The first mentioning and proposals originated from the works of the Humanists in 15 th and 16 th century, and in the thirties of the 19 th century some practical attempts were made for their revival. The aim of the paper was to determine the time when the first ideas on Olympism appeared in Serbia in civil gymnastic and other sporting societies and clubs.Historical method was used in the paper. For a long period Serbia was cherishing and developing traditional forms of competitions and tournaments but organized forms of physical exercises of citizens appeared only in the mid‐19th century when the first private schools for physical exercises were established in many towns of the Principality of Serbia. Therefore, these private schools and the civil gymnastic societies were places where modern sport and the Olympic ideal were gladly accepted and further developed.Thus, it is understandable why, at the time of realization of the idea on revival of Ancient Olympic Games, those societies and clubs used the expression: Olympic competitions for their sporting events, besides they already used names: popular festivals or chivalry competitive plays.\n\nFull Special Issue: https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/fhsp20/34/9 From the Concept of the Communist ‘New Man’ to Nationalist Hooliganism: Research Perspectives on Sport in Socialist Yugoslavia Dario Brentin & Dejan Zec Pages: 713-728 Laying the Foundations of Physical Culture: The Stadium Revolution in Socialist Yugoslavia Richard Mills Pages: 729-752 How Doing Sport Became a Culture: Producing the Concept of Physical Cultivation of the Yugoslavs Ana Petrov Pages: 753-766 Article The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics and Identity-Formation in Late Socialist Sarajevo Zlatko Jovanovic Pages: 767-782 FC Red Star Belgrade and the Multiplicity of Social Identifications in Socialist Yugoslavia: Representative Dimensions of the ‘Big Four’ Football Clubs Martin Blasius Pages: 783-799 Like a Bridge Over Troubled Adriatic Water: The Complex Relationship between Italian and Yugoslavian Sporting Diplomacy (1945–1954) Nicola Sbetti Pages: 800-814 Blind-Alleys on the Road to Communism: ‘Isms’ of the Automobile Sport in Socialist Yugoslavia, 1945–1992 Marko Miljković Pages: 815-831 How Falcons Became Partizans Hrvoje Klasić Pages: 832-847 Published online: 27 Nov 2017 Gender Policies and Amateur Sports in Early Yugoslav Socialism Ivan Simić Pages: 848-861\n\nThe present article explores the beginnings of organized football in Bosnia and Herzegovina. e first football was brought to the country from Budapest in 1903 as a gift from Mostar-based banker Bernard Lajhner for his sons Alfred and Oskar. e football story of Sarajevo began in the spring of 1908 when freshmen from the Realna gimnazija Prep School in Sarajevo, incidentally Tuzla natives Emil Najšul, Fedor Lukać and Stevo Jokanović visited Zagreb, where they first came into contact with the game. e beginnings of football in Banja Luka date back to the second decade of the 20th century. University student Gusti Cengrić brought the first football and the first pair of football boots to the city. e football pioneers of Banja Luka were locals who studied at renowned universities throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Zagreb, Leoben, Vienna) where they first learned about the game. Based on available sources, it may be assumed that the first official football match on Bosnian and Herzegovinian soil took place in February 1911, when a team of preparatory school students from Sarajevo representing the Srednješkolski sportski klub Osman (Osman Preparatory School Sports Club) returned from a short tour of Split. During their journey home, they also visited Mostar, where they played two matches against the local Đački športski klub (Students' Sports Club). e most successful Bosnian and Herzegovinian teams of the interwar period were the Serbo-Croatian Sarajevo-based city rivals Slavija and SAŠK. With the exception of the 1932 season, both teams interchangeably reached all National Championship playoffs held between 1923 and 1940. At this level, both teams recorded 2nd place finishes as their best respective results."
