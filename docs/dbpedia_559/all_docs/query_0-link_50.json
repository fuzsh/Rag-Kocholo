Therefore get rid of the chauvinistic background and propaganda of your countries and if you really want to learn something about distinct Macedonian nation and ethnicum you can start from here. This detailed volume surveys the history of Macedonia from 600 BC to the present day, with an emphasis on the past two centuries. It reveals how the so-called Macedonian question has long dominated Balkan politics, and how for well over a century and a half, it was the central issue dividing Balkan peoples, as neighboring Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia struggled for possession of Macedonia-and denied any distinct Macedonian identity."
