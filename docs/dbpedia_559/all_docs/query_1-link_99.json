        "text": "The reader is forewarned that this paper (first published in 1996), which maintains the character of the original oral presentation, makes no attempt at covering completely such a vast subject, on which there is an extensive bibliography much of it in Serbo-Croatian, a language I do not know. My intent is simply to offer for discussion some little-exploited historical materials on well-known themes that exemplify contacts between the two coasts of the Adriatic Sea, especially but not only during the Quattrocento. Following an overview of the history of Venetian sovereignty in that part of the Stato da mar, attention will turn to aspects of politics and society, that is, to the political, financial and monetary administration of the subject territories and to the movement of people and peoples across the Adriatic.\n\nThis paper provides an outline and brief summary of the Slavic, Latin and Italian documents from the late Middle Ages which are currently kept in the State Archives of Zadar and Dubrovnik in the Republic of Croatia, highlighting their great potential and possibilities for the research and study of early Ottoman history in the Balkans. These rich archival collections contain diverse and valuable facts about the establishment and functioning of Ottoman rule in South-East Europe, but despite of that, the information they give has not yet been fully incorporated into the dominant historical narratives about the rise of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest obstacle to the full appreciation of their importance has been the obvious language barrier, but a systematic approach to these documents could generate valuable results and further advance our knowledge about the history of the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire in the fourteenth and fifteenth century. Therefore, in the hope of drawing the attention of the global community of medievalists and ottomanists to these documents and archives, I have presented a general description of the existing records, their organization and arrangement, as well a brief assessment of the kind of information that they include.\n\nThe main contention of this article is that from the very beginning of the genre to its very end, the Venetian isolarii viewed the Levant as a network of islands fractured by the Ottomans’ conquest. Cartographical narratives of a historical trauma, the Venetian isolarii adopted different strategies for tackling a highly sensitive topic. As the Ottomans were steadily advancing along the Eastern Mediterranean archipelagos, the Venetian cartographers, such as Bartolomeo dalli Sonetti and Benedetto Bordone, were carefully editing the content of their isolarii, expecting from their readers to mentally map the invisible confrontation between the Sultan’s army and the Serenissima. The Lepanto victory brought a radical change of tone, and the mapmakers, such as Tomasso Porcacchi, Giovanni Camocio or Simon Pinargenti, manifestly joined the choir of those who were looking forward to the Venetian resurgence in the Levant. The fracture of the Eastern Mediterranean space was no longer suggested, but visibly exposed. However, it was only a change of tone, as the mapmakers continued to convey the same fundamental ideas. Thus, the Venetian isolarii display a remarkable continuity through time, from its beginnings to the post-Lepanto era and illustrate both the enduring format of this cartographic genre and its adaptability.\n\nA remarkably accurate manuscript map of 1797, held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) in Paris, provides crucial information about the shifting of the border line of the Venetian ruled Territorio of Preveza and the Ottoman empire in the 18th century. This anonymous map, which begins «Adi 31. Agosto 1797. S.H. Preuesa Anno Pmo. della Liberta Italliana», is composed of a long introductory text that serves as both the title and the description of the map’s contents, and the topographical map itself. The paper provides a physical description of the map, a detailed description of its contents, the historical context in which it was drawn, background about the establishment of the borders at Preveza and how they were contested during the entire Venetian period, speculations about the identify of the mapmaker, how the map entered the BnF collection, why it is now in France, the relationship of this map with other known maps depicting this northern border. Adi 31. Agosto 1797 is an important document because it is one of a rare handful of maps from the former Venetian territories in Greece that indicates in very precise terms the border with the Ottoman empire; it is the only known detailed map of the critical northern border of Preveza."
