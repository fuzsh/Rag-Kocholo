        "text": "Have a blessed Easter, for all those who celebrate tomorrow, Sunday, March 31, this year a month before the Orthodox! Artwork: The Resurrection of Christ Artist: Piero della Francesca Created: c. 1463 Medium: Fresco Dimensions: 225 x 200 cm Location: Pinacoteca Civica, Sansepolcro, Italy Piero della Francesca‚Äôs (c. 1415-92) life as an artist and theorist he published several treaties on painting, including De prospectiva pingendi, continuing the debate on the new science of perspective was, to a certain extent, peripatetic. His affiliations were toward no particular region; rather, his activities as a painter led him to make work in various locations across the Italian peninsula. The Resurrection currently resides in Piero‚Äôs hometown, Borgo San Sepolcro (now called Sansepolcro). The fresco‚Äôs provenance was originally the Residenza, an official government chamber, where it had been commissioned for the Sala dei Conservatori. The fresco centers around the risen figure of Christ, and the frontally of the pose Christ adopts denotes the certitude and solemnly of the Christian spirit. Organised around a dominant vertical line that splices the painting in two, Piero places winter on the left-hand side of the line, and summer on the right. Reading this painting from left to right the viewer understand that the change of the seasons is an elaboration on the ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù of Christ himself. As well as reading the painting from left to right, one can read it from the bottom of the composition, where the soldiers lay asleep, to the standing, upright pose of Christ himself, his left foot placed on the ledge as if about to step upward and quite literally out of the scene itself. Such a change from passivity to action, from slumber to movement, conveys the painting‚Äôs ultimate meaning the indomitability of Christ himself. (CS 1001pbyd) #1001beforeyoudiecollection #1001beforeyoudiecollections #arthistorian #historyofart #greatpainter #artwork\n\nTwo wilted Kigelia flowers touch each other gently on a stony path leading toward the ancient temple of Angkor Wat. The flowers still exhibit signs of life, freshly fallen ‚Äî still flush with blood red, dark orange and transparent golden hues, in the days before complete rot due to stilted Cambodian heat. This piece is a poem about two lovers. View this as you like, but the piece represents all aspects of a relationship: Botanical and fragrant, drenched in a sticky, soporific and hazy perfume. Through relationship patterns and time, the flowers remain together ‚Äî in spirituality, poetry, aching, forgiveness and hardship. This piece can be viewed from the Buddhist perspective of impermanence - wether it is natural death or misunderstanding that parts the lovers ways. As a matter of nature, each flower is eventually swallowed back into the earth once again, as the trees continue to sway in the hot breeze and the holy temples observe. (I won‚Äôt be posting a new painting for some time moving forward as I prepare for an exhibition slated for 2025. But this work is the second in the new series titled ‚ÄúFeast,‚Äù a series that deals with the tangible and intangible feast of the senses.) *This piece is sold.\n\nI attached a link below to an excellent post from Michael Sprague , here is something of potential relevance to it. The artwork in question Mr. Sprague shared is one of the Daniel Chapter 6 renditions from artist Briton Revi√®re. The work's title is, \"Daniel's Answer To The King\". This depicts the end of the trial for God's Prophet and correlates to his response to King Nebuchadnezzar found in Daniel 6:21-23. Did you know that Revi√®re painted another work of the same portrayal to even greater acclaim? I have included an image of that piece in question, and its title is, \"Daniel in the Lion's Den\". That painting shows Daniel facing the lions during his initial sentence to be served in the den. Notice how Briton illustrates each lion expressing a different reaction, and emotion but all with the same result... Daniel is not to be touched! The foundational point is the one Mr. Sprague and his story are detailing. In lieu of that essential truth, I believe it is vitally important for Christ-followers to understand... we face the lions with resolve and steadfastness for Christ! Not in arrogance or pride but Holy Spirit-empowered commitment to Jesus. There are times to face our lions! When we do so with Jesus, there is no fear in the outcome even if we die, as that only sends us to eternal glory! (2 Cor 5:8). Now I am not wishing an early exit for myself or anyone but only using this example to say, with eyes fixed on Christ first... you and I can face our struggles and circumstances. Those \"lions\" are nothing compared to eternity with Jesus and the saints of God! Jesus loves you! He wants you for himself! Sidenote: If you look at the upper right of the photo I have included, Rivi√®re incorporated an actual Assyrian wall relief from the palace of Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II (884-859 BC). I believe this is the first artwork to try and embed period-specific context/culture to the Daniel story. Although it is Assyrian and not Babylonian, there is great semblance between those two empires. The Assyrian relief is on display at The British Museum. I long to return to England, to see these aforementioned works again and to give tours for Christians to experience the amazing truths at The British Museum. https://lnkd.in/emiwhm_q"
