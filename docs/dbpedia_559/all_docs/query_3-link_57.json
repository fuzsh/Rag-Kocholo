        "text": "Travis Hernes\n\nThe promising teenager was in action during Norway's Under-20 World Cup play-off against Turkey on Thursday afternoon as Pål Arne Johansen's side sealed their place at next year's finals in Chile via a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory after a 1-1 draw after 120 minutes in Belfast.\n\nRasmus Holten sent Norway's youngsters ahead inside 15 minutes before İsak Vural levelled the scoring in the 81st minute, seconds after Hernes was substituted, but Norway ultimately won 10-9 on penalties as Baran Ali Gezek failed to convert for Turkey following an impressive 19 converted penalties in succession.\n\nHernes started all three of Norway's Group A matches during this summer's European Under-19 Championship finals in Northern Ireland, claiming a 2-0 win against the host country last weekend courtesy of Daniel Braut's brace, with Hernes playing 87 minutes of the game in Belfast.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's 3-2 win against ten-man Italy resulted in Norway finishing in third place, missing out on qualification for the semi-finals, but Hernes could be in action on Thursday, 25th July when his country face an Under-20 World Cup play-off to compete in next year's finals in Chile, facing the side which finishes in third place of Group B.\n\nHernes was in action during Norway's second group game on Thursday afternoon, a goalless draw against Ukraine, with the 18-year-old midfielder playing the opening 68 minutes in Belfast.\n\nHernes, who joined the Magpies from Shrewsbury Town in September 2023, started for his country in the opening fixture of the European Under-19 Championship finals in Northern Ireland, making his international debut at under-19 level in the process, but ended up on the losing side in a 2-1 defeat against Italy in Belfast.\n\nBraut opened the scoring for Norway after the half-hour mark but Luca Di Maggio levelled the Group A clash on the stroke of half-time before Kevin Zeroli netted the match-winning goal, with Hernes playing 80 minutes.\n\nKieran Trippier and Anthony Gordon\n\nEngland suffered another agonising near-miss on Sunday when they were beaten 2-1 by Spain in the EURO 2024 final in Berlin.\n\nNewcastle United duo Kieran Trippier and Anthony Gordon were both unused substitutes as Nico Williams fired Spain ahead at the start of the second half.\n\nCole Palmer stepped off the bench to equalise for the Three Lions but Mikel Oyarzabal's late winner ensured Spain - whose squad featured former Magpies Mikel Merino, Ayoze Perez and Joselu - lifted their fourth European Championship title.\n\nEngland had booked their place in the final by beating the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday, with Trippier helping the Three Lions to victory in Dortmund.\n\nThe full back started for Gareth Southgate's side, with winger Gordon among the substitutes, as they fell behind to Xavi Simons' thumping opener.\n\nHarry Kane's penalty levelled matters before the break, with Trippier replaced by Luke Shaw at half time, but in the end it was left to another substitute, Ollie Watkins, who won it in the dying moments with a superb low finish to send England into the final.\n\nThey had secured their place in the last four of EURO 2024 with knockout stage wins over Slovakia and Switzerland, while Gordon made his debut at a major international tournament in the latter stages of their Group C clash with Slovenia, which ended in a 0-0 draw.\n\nTrippier picked up his 50th England cap during the 1-1 draw with Denmark in their second group stage game, with Kane's neat finish getting Southgate's men up and running in Frankfurt on a landmark night for Trippier, who again started at left back.\n\nBut Morten Hjulmand's low drive drew Denmark level before the break as England laboured, with the Magpies defender playing the full 90 minutes - while Gordon remained an unused substitute.\n\nEngland enjoyed a winning start at the tournament as Trippier helped the Three Lions record a 1-0 win over Serbia in their opening game, starting for his country in Gelsenkirchen and helped England record a clean sheet as Bellingham's winner separated the sides in Group C, with the Newcastle right-back completing the full 90 minutes, while Gordon was an unused substitute.\n\nLast month, Trippier captained England as they beat Bosnia & Herzegovina 3-0 at St. James' Park.\n\nThe Newcastle United defender led his country out for their penultimate warm-up match before EURO 2024, playing for 62 minutes before handing the armband over to Kane following his withdrawal.\n\nMoments earlier, in front of a crowd of 50,061, Cole Palmer had given Southgate's team the lead with a penalty at the Gallowgate End - his first international goal - before late goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kane rounded off the victory for England.\n\nBruno Guimarães\n\nBruno Guimarães' Brazil suffered an agonising defeat against Uruguay in the Copa América quarter-finals on Saturday, losing via penalties after a goalless draw in Nevada.\n\nGuimarães started the last-eight clash, playing 87 minutes at the Allegiant Stadium, but ended up on the losing side as Éder Militão and Douglas Luiz missed penalties for the five-time World champions.\n\nBrazil had booked a quarter-final showdown with Uruguay after they drew 1-1 with Colombia their final Copa América group game on Wednesday.\n\nThe Newcastle playmaker started once again for his country, who went in front thanks to Raphinha early on before being pegged back by Daniel Munoz's leveller in first half stoppage time.\n\nGuimarães, who received a booking, was withdrawn at half time for Douglas Luiz.\n\nLast week, he played 72 minutes as his side showed their intent with a 4-1 win over Miguel Almirón's Paraguay in Las Vegas. Vinicius Junior's brace, plus goals from Savinho and Lucas Paqueta, earned the Seleção a comfortable win in their second Group D clash, with the Magpies midfielder making way for Luiz for the final 18 minutes.\n\nGuimarães also played the full 90 minutes of the Seleção's opening Group D fixture against Costa Rica, which ended goalless in California. He was also a 74th minute substitute as his country beat Mexico 3-2 in a friendly earlier this month and started for the five-time world champions in a 1-1 draw against the United States, playing the opening 65 minutes in Orlando.\n\nFabian Schär\n\nSchär's Switzerland were knocked out of the EURO 2024 quarter-finals after losing against England via penalties following a 1-1 draw on Saturday.\n\nThe Wil-born defender played the full 120 minutes at the Düsseldorf Arena and, despite scoring a composed spot-kick, were defeated in painful fashion as England won 5-3 on penalties.\n\nSwitzerland had defeated Italy in the last-16 stage, defeating defending champions Italy 2-0, and played the full game as goals from Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas sealed a meeting with Schär's club teammates, Trippier and Gordon, in the last eight.\n\nSchär had also played the full 90 minutes for Switzerland as their final Group A clash ended in a dramatic 1-1 draw with hosts Germany. Dan Ndoye sent the Red Crosses in front inside the opening half hour in Frankfurt before Niclas Füllkrug's stoppage-time equaliser denied Switzerland top spot in the group.\n\nLast week, Switzerland's s econd Group A clash ended in a 1-1 draw with Scotland, with Schär inadvertently deflected Scott McTominay's shot into the net with 13 minutes on the clock to give the Scots - who are managed by former Newcastle coach Steve Clarke - the lead.\n\nBut Xherdan Shaqiri capitalised on Anthony Ralston's loose pass to curl home a magnificent equaliser for Schär's side, who survived a late scare when another ex-United man Grant Hanley headed against the base of the upright.\n\nSwitzerland had got off to a fine start in the group stage, beating Hungary 3-1 in Cologne. Schär, who has 84 senior caps to his name, completed the full 90 minutes for his side, who swept aside their opponents thanks to goals from Kwadwo Duah, Michel Aebischer and Breel Embolo.\n\nEarlier this summer, Switzerland's preparations started with a 4-0 home win over Estonia, with Schär starting the game and coming off in the final stages. He didn't feature in their 1-1 draw with Austria.\n\nMiguel Almirón\n\nMiguel Almirón became the second most-capped Newcastle United player after playing 45 minutes of Paraguay's 2-1 Copa América defeat to Costa Rica.\n\nThe winger started in Austin - picking up his 44th cap while with the Magpies, overtaking Aaron Hughes - and picked up a yellow card before being withdrawn at the break as La Albirroja bowed out of the tournament, finishing bottom of Group D.\n\nAlmirón also started for Paraguay in their 4-1 defeat to Bruno's Brazil, and was replaced after 78 minutes of what became a miserable outing for his side. The Newcastle man also played the opening 59 minutes of Paraguay's opening Copa América game against Colombia, which ended in a 2-1 defeat for La Albirroja.\n\nPrior to the finals in the United States, he was an unused substitute in Paraguay's 1-0 friendly win over Panama and came off the bench in the 64th minute of a goalless draw with Peru.\n\nThe South American forward was then involved in a 3-0 defeat against Chile, introduced at the restart.\n\nMartin Dúbravka\n\nThe United stopper's run in EURO 2024 ended at the last 16 stage, as Trippier and Gordon's England knocked Slovakia out with a 2-1 win in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nDúbravka was rarely troubled by the Three Lions, but was beaten by Bellingham's last-gasp leveller and then Kane's close-range header as England progressed despite Ivan Schranz's opener.\n\nSlovakia had claimed third place in Group E following a 1-1 draw against Romania, progressing into the knockout stages of a major international tournament for the first time since 2010.\n\nOndrej Duda opened the scoring for Slovakia before Răzvan Marin's penalty levelled the clash in Frankfurt and, following Ukraine's goalless draw against Belgium, the Falcons advanced as one of the highest third-placed teams.\n\nEarlier, they had slipped to a 2-1 defeat to Ukraine as Dúbravka's side missed their chance to make sure of their place in the knockout stage of EURO 2024.\n\nChasing a Slovakian record of four successive international clean sheets, the United goalkeeper started at the Merkur Spiel-Arena in Düsseldorf and when Schranz netted the opener in the first half, things looked good for the impressive Sokoli. But Ukraine's second-half fightback turned the game on its head, as both Mykola Shaparenko and Roman Yaremchuk beat Dúbravka to earn Ukraine the points and leave Slovakia's hopes of progressing hinging on their final group game against Romania.\n\nIn their opening game, they produced one of the shock results of EURO 2024 in a 1-0 win against Belgium - with Dúbravka keeping a clean sheet to help his side to victory.\n\nSchranz's seventh minute strike separated the sides at the Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt, but Roberto Martinez's Belgium twice had the ball in the net through Romelu Lukaku, who saw both of his efforts - including one in the final five minutes - chalked off for infringements.\n\nJamal Lewis\n\nThe full-back spent last season on loan with Watford, and started for Northern Ireland as they took on Spain in a friendly in Mallorca on Saturday.\n\nHis side took a shock lead but eventually lost 5-1. Lewis played the whole game.\n\nThe Luton-born defender played the full 90 minutes of the Green and White Army's 2-0 win against Andorra.\n\nAlex Murphy\n\nThe Republic of Ireland Under-21s held off a late fightback from Croatia to win in a friendly 3-2 in Zagreb.\n\nAlex Murphy - who made his Premier League debut for Newcastle last term - came on in the 63rd minute to help his team see the game out.\n\nThe Galway-born youngster made his first international start at under-21 level against England's under-20 side, playing 78 minutes of a 2-2 draw against the Young Lions.\n\nAlexander Isak and Emil Krafth\n\nIsak was on target for Sweden as they were condemned to a 2-1 defeat against Denmark in Copenhagen.\n\nHe and Emil Krafth were named in Sweden's 26-man squad for two friendly fixtures in June, and both were named in the starting XI against Denmark.\n\nIsak netted his 11th international goal in the ninth minute to cancel out Pierre-Emile Højbjerg's early opener - but Christian Eriksen scored in the 86th minute. Isak came off in the 70th minute, while Krafth played the whole match.\n\nKrafth again played the full game as Sweden were beaten 3-0 at home by Serbia. Isak entered the fray at half time and won man of the match.\n\nIsak, who was nominated for the Premier League's Player and Young Player of the Season after netting 21 English top-flight goals during the 2023/24 campaign, is on 46 senior caps while Krafth, who has represented his country at two major tournaments, has earned 48 senior appearances.\n\nLeo Shahar\n\nThe young Lions got off to a flying start in their European Under-17 Championship Group D campaign following an impressive victory against the 2022 champions in Cyprus, with Shahar assisting Mikey Moore's opening goal inside two minutes.\n\nFurther strikes from Baylee Dipepa, Moore and Ethan Nwaneri added gloss to the scoreline for Greg Lincoln's side, with Shahar playing the full 90 minutes in Larnaca.\n\nShahar was then handed another start for England's youngsters as well as playing the full 90 minutes but the Newcastle full-back, who joined the Magpies from boyhood club Wolverhampton Wanderers last summer, ended up on the losing side as they were beaten 4-1.\n\nEngland then sealed a quarter-final clash with Italy as goals from Shim Mheuka, Moore and Nwaneri proved the difference in a 3-1 win over Spain, with Shahar withdrawn after 72 minutes.\n\nBut they were to suffer a heartbreaking exit at the hands of Italy in the quarter-final stages, losing 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Larnaca.\n\nMattia Liberali's solo finish cancelled out Ethan Nwaneri's opener for the Young Lions before five clinical spot-kicks from their Italian counterparts confirmed England's exit from the competition."
