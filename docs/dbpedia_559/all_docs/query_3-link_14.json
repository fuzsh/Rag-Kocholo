        "text": "Patriotic music (Albania)\n\nFrom the poetry of Sejfullah Maleshova (1901 - 1971):\n\nHow I Love Albania\n\nI've no farm estates or manors,\n\nI've no shops or lofty buildings,\n\nYet I love my land, Albania -\n\nFor a barn in Trebeshina,\n\nFor its boulders and its brushwood,\n\nFor a hut above Selishta,\n\nFor two fields ploughed in Zallishta,\n\nFor a cow and for a donkey,\n\nFor an ox, a little lambkin,\n\nThis is how I love my country\n\nLike a shepherd, like a peasant.\n\nYes, I love my land, Albania,\n\nFor the clover in its meadows,\n\nFor a quick and agile maiden,\n\nFor its spring of water gurgling\n\nFrom the cliffs and flowing swiftly\n\nThrough the leafy oak tree forests,\n\nTumbling down to form a river,\n\nYes, I love my land, Albania,\n\nFor the fenugreek in blossom,\n\nFor the birds that fly above it,\n\nFor the nightingales a-singing,\n\nIn the shade and in the brambles,\n\nTrilling songs of love and longing,\n\nThis is how I love my country,\n\nLike a poet in devotion.\n\nYes, I love my land, Albania,\n\nRight from Korça to Vranina,\n\nWhere the farmer sets off early\n\nWith his hoe and plough a-toiling,\n\nSows and reaps by sun and moonlight,\n\nYet, he has no food to live on,\n\nWhere the farrier and saddler\n\nDay and night stoop o'er their duties\n\nJust to get a few stale breadcrumbs,\n\nWhere the porter at the dockyards,\n\nLaden down with iron and barrels,\n\nBears his load, barefoot and ragged,\n\nAlways serving other people.\n\nYes, I love my land, Albania,\n\nRight from Skopje to Janina,\n\nWhere its people in misfortune\n\nSuffer, live their lives in serfdom,\n\nYet they have a fighting spirit -\n\nThis is how I love my country,\n\nLike a revolutionary.\n\nPatriotic music (Albania)\n\nFrom the poetry of Naim Frasheri (1846-1900)\n\nOh mountains of Albania\n\nOh mountains of Albania and you, oh trees so lofty,\n\nBroad plains with all your flowers, day and night I contemplate you,\n\nYou highlands so exquisite, and you streams and rivers sparkling,\n\nOh peaks and promontories, and you slopes, cliffs, verdant forests,\n\nOf the herds and flocks I'll sing out which you hold and which you nourish.\n\nOh you blessed, sacred places, you inspire and delight me!\n\nYou, Albania, give me honour, and you name me as Albanian,\n\nAnd my heart you have replenished both with ardour and desire.\n\nAlbania! Oh my mother! Though in exile I am longing,\n\nMy heart has ne'er forgotten all the love you've given to me.\n\nWhen a lambkin from its flock strays and does hear its mother's bleating,\n\nOnce or twice it will give answer and will flee in her direction,\n\nWere others, twenty-thirty fold, to block its path and scare it,\n\nDespite its fright it would return, pass through them like an arrow,\n\nThus my wretched heart in exile, here in foreign land awaiting,\n\nHastens back unto that country, swift advancing and in longing.\n\nWhere cold spring water bubbles and cool breezes blow in summer,\n\nWhere the foliage grows so fairly, where the flowers have such fragrance,\n\nWhere the shepherd plays his reed pipe to the grazing of the cattle,\n\nWhere the goats, their bells resounding, rest, yes 'tis the land I long for.\n\n​\n\nJericho gheg\n\nThe music of Jericho is a fusion between rock, alternative, electronics and traditional ethnic Albanian music characteristic for region of Kosovo and northern Albania.\n\nBand members:\n\nPetrit Çarkaxhiu - Vocal & Rhythm Guitar\n\nLeonard Canhasi - Solo Guitar\n\nSuad Jamini - Bass Guitar\n\nVisar Rexha - Drums Our Song\n\nMother is asking: \"Where are my boys, where have they gone?\"\n\na great shame has stepped the gates of our home\n\nstone upon stone, they're pulling down our tower\n\ncome back my boys, how could you forget your Mother\n\nO God give us back the honor of home\n\nin this dread of solitude don't leave us alone\n\nWake up brother, there is no other day but today\n\nMother is calling, her tears of mourn are about to waste\n\nstone upon stone, our tower we'll pull it up again\n\nthe time has come to kick out of home this shame\n\nO God give us back the honor of home\n\nin this dread of solitude don't leave us alone\n\ndon't…\n\nHow fleeting the years have gone\n\nthat memory brings back this song\n\nhow easy we all forgot\n\nthe pain we felt once long ago\n\nthose songs we sang jointly\n\nremained an echo in the memory\n\nall now are singing lonely\n\nmy country is an 'orphan'\n\nonce more if we could walk\n\nand be reunited like once upon a time\n\na heart for a heart law\n\nbecome a flag for all of us\n\nthe hand that stretches out when I fall\n\nit's the one that is holding us tight\n\ndon't let it be forgotten\n\nfor we have no other hearth\n\nJericho gheg\n\nCold November\n\nIs there a memory, oh to warm me up on these days?\n\nIs there a path which makes me turn as a man and look ahead?\n\nIs there a memory to give us a meaning, won't you tell me?\n\nOh won't you tell me, where to find the strength to sing today?\n\nStill fresh is that glance of scorn\n\nStill fresh that cold ache in bones\n\nStill fresh even the traces left by the footsteps on the road\n\nA frozen glance fell upon the home which I never saw anymore\n\nCold November haunts me still today\n\ncold November in years echos\n\nA century passed on walking but yet we fell\n\nA century passed but on our feet yet we can't stand\n\nA century passed of lessons, yet how come we learnt nothing?\n\nOh ignorant mind, a greedy eye a whole nation can pull down\n\nHow much longer till we love each other\n\nhow much longer till we change our own destiny\n\nhow much longer till someone else's life we value\n\nOh won't you tell me, where to find the strength to sing today?\n\nCold November haunts me still today\n\ncold November,\n\noh November…\n\nThey swore and hit me, \"the unfaithful you'll turn\" - they told me\n\nthey undressed and dressed me, even myself I recognize no longer\n\nthe veil they sew for me, oh how proudly today I hold it\n\nthe dance they started, oh like a bride how beautiful the step I pride"
