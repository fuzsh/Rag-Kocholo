        "text": "The explanations of the origins of Tito-Stalin split are to be found in the evolution of the CPY from 1937 onwards, and are intrinsically linked with the actions of Josip Broz, better known as Tito. He became a member of the Central Committee in 1934 and as such went to Moscow, only to inherit the actual leadership of the Party during the purges. He proved to be a true Stalinist leader since he never questioned any instructions he got from Moscow. If anything, he showed himself to be overzealous. On several occasions, Georgi Dimitrov had to explain to him that there was no chance a social revolution could successfully be carried out in Yugoslavia before the War. The German attack on Yugoslavia did not incite Tito to act, but Hitler’s attack on the USSR did. Once they joined the war, Tito and the CPY started pursuing their own agenda – social revolution as a consequence of the victory in the Civil War they had waged against the Yugoslav King, the Royal Government, and their Minister of War in Yugoslavia – general Dragoljub, Draža, Mihailović. For Dimitrov and the Soviet authorities, Tito’s actions risked to provoke problems within the Allied coalition. Therefore he was reprimanded on several occasions, until the Partisan units under his command were recognized also by the Western Allies. The Partisan Army, and the state institutions that were created during the war gave his movement enough potential to be at the forefront of the conflicts in Trieste and in Greece which heralded in the Cold War. The conflict with Stalin was provoked by the same tendency of Tito’s to advance his own interests without consulting Moscow. The causes of the conflict were not ideological since Yugoslavia was the most faithful disciple of the USSR. They were in fact geostrategic; the conflict was about the discipline within the Soviet bloc. The importance and solidity of Partisans and their institutions allowed Tito and the CPY to withstand the pressure of the Cominform countries.\n\nThe communist elite of Yugoslavia established Yugoslavia anew during World War II. A federal communist arrangement was put in place, with the period shifting from an almost totalitarian regime towards an operationally consociational one. In this paper, we question the issue of the homogeneity and very existence of the Yugoslav ruling communist elite in the period 1943-1991. We focus on decision-making, discussions and purges by considering newly available archival sources. The article finds that while the elite was successful in taking power it was not long before the elite started to be ethnically segmented. The origins of this segmentation related to how resolution of the national question of the nations at issue was understood, in turn further driving the segmentation process. Overall, we argue that individual national elites were already established by 1972.\n\nThis essay advances new research directions in the field of political history of late-socialist Yugoslavia, in the context of the Cold War. The critical analysis of the Special war doctrine, as part of the ideology of the Yugoslav socialism, coupled with the release of previously unavailable archival documents of the League of communists of Yugoslavia may lead to substantial historiographical reconsiderations. According to the Special war doctrine, Yugoslavia and its political system were under constant indirect attack by both Superpowers and their allies. The final goal was overthrow the self-managed political system in Yugoslavia. In the essay are taken in consideration some inedited archival sources from the late 1987, and the beginning of 1988. They are split in two main fields: Yugoslavia’s security issues, and the relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. In the first case, analyzing some reports of the Yugoslav military leadership, we learn that an escalation of the crisis would have led to an internationalization of the conflict. According to those reports, for the US, if needed, Yugoslavia’s integrity was expendable, in favor of Greater Albania. Secondly, will be taken into consideration two meetings between the Soviet general secretary Gorbachev and the Yugoslav political leadership. They were concerned about their weaknesses, constantly exploited by the West. Yugoslavia and other socialist countries were dependent in the field of the technological development. The preliminary results mentioned above would deserve a further investigation, because they would throw light on some essential parts of European and World’s recent history."
