The only reason for that could be the fact that the official vehicle of RTS had Belgrade licence plates,’’ it was said in the letter said.\n\n‘’We are kindly asking you to, in accordance with internationally recognized European norms and conventions in force in the civilized world, condemn the behaviour of provisional authorities in Priština, seek an explanation for such shameful and unprovoked behaviour, and protect the right of journalists to report objectively and impartially about the early parliamentary elections for members of the Assembly of Kosovo and all developments in Kosovo and Metohija,’’ it was said in the letter.\n\nJournalists’ Association of Serbia and its branch in Kosovo: Kosovo institutions grossly violate the freedom of media(Serbian media, uns.org)\n\nToday, Journalists’ Association of Serbia (UNS) and its branch in Kosovo (UNS KiM) issued a press release in which they have condemned yesterday’s six-hour detention of Radio Belgrade’s three-member team in the police station in southern Mitrovica without explanation and the holdup of TV Pink and Tanjug news agency crews for several hours at the administrative crossing Jarinje and demanded that the harassment of journalists stops.\n\nUNS and UNS in Kosovo also warn that the fact that Radio Belgrade’s team after detention was turned back towards North Mitrovica, with an explanation that it was not safe for them to continue their journey to Gracanica, where they were heading, presents a restriction of journalist’s work or an acknowledgment that the job of a journalist in Kosovo is unsafe.\n\nUNS and UNS in Kosovo recall that three weeks ago, RTS team that was headed to North Mitrovica regarding the holding and broadcasting of a concert, was held at Jarinje crossing for more than 20 hours.\n\nUNS and UNS in Kosovo point out that this is an impermissible restriction of the movement of journalists and media workers to whom Kosovo institutions are severely violating their freedom of media.\n\nUNS and UNS in Kosovo will contact international news organizations as well as organizations fighting for media freedom and seek protection from such actions.\n\nInternational Media:\n\nKosovo voters focus on graft, Serbia peace deal in election (Reuters)\n\nPRISTINA (Reuters) - Deep-rooted corruption and a peace deal with Serbia which would pave the way for membership of the United Nations are the chief concerns of 1.9 million eligible voters in Kosovo who go to the polls on Sunday.\n\nThe snap elections, the fourth since a declaration of independence in 2008, have been called after Prime Minister RamushHaradinaj resigned in July when he was summoned to appear before a war crimes court.\n\nhttps://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-kosovo-election/kosovo-voters-eye-graft-and-deal-with-serbia-in-election-idUKKCN1WK0LA\n\nKosovo: What you need to know about the country's snap elections (Euronews)\n\nKosovars will cast their ballots on Sunday, October 6, to pick a new parliament in snap elections.\n\nRampant corruption, widespread unemployment and sour relations with neighbouring Serbia are themes dominating the poll — and must be addressed if the country is to make progress toward EU membership.\n\nThe election was triggered when Prime Minister RamushHaradinaj resigned after a war crimes court in The Hague summoned him for questioning as a suspect.
