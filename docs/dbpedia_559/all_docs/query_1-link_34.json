I especially thank Wendy Bracewell and Peter SianiDavies, my former PhD supervisors, and Stevan IC Pavlowitch (University o f Southampton) and Anita Prazmowska (London School of Economics), who examined the thesis and recommended its publication. The final manuscript benefited from extremely helpful reports by two anonymous readers. Aleksa Djilas and Desimir Tosic read an earlier draft and offered characteristically selfless and expert comments, suggestions and criticisms. Without Dina Almuli and her parents, and without the late Vane Ivanovic, I could not have started this work. Jasna Dragovic-Soso and Dejan Jovic spent endless hours discussing Yugoslavia with me while we were postgraduates, and, although all three o f us now teach at different British universities, somehow we still find time for ‘the topic’. I am fortunate enough to have been surrounded by good colleagues in London, New York and Nottingham: John Arnold, Mark Mazower (now at Columbia), Lucy Riall, Naoko Shimazu, Ruth Watson, and really everyone else at Birkbeck’s School of History, Classics and Archaeology; members of the Department o f History and the Centre for South-East European Studies at SSE E S, U C L; Sumantra Bose (LSE); Ilaria Favretto (Kingston); Milan Nikolic (Surrey); Brad Abrams, Gordon Bardos, and John Micgiel at Columbia; members o f the Department of Russian and Slavonic Studies and o f the Centre for the Study o f PostConflict Cultures, both at Nottingham. For their help and support, I am grateful to friends in Belgrade, especially: Maja, Nikola, and\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nOlgica Djilas; Ljubinka Trgovcevic, Andrej Mitrovic, and Professor Mitrovic’s many ‘disciples’, too numerous to list here; and in Zagreb: the Cipek/Maijanovic family, Ines Lovric, Tanja Rudez and Cedomir Visnjic. Help of the staff o f the following archives and libraries is gratefully acknowledged: in London: the British Library, the British Library o f Political and Economic Science (LSE), the National Archives (formerly Public Record Office), and the library o f the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (UCL); in Belgrade: the Archives o f Yugoslavia, and the National Library, in Zagreb: the Croatian State Archives, and the National and University Library, and in the United States: the Bakhmetteff Archives at Columbia University, and the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University. The book could not have been written without the Yugoslav Studies Fellowship and Research Bursary (both awarded by SSE E S, U C L), the Scouloudi Research Fellowship (Institute o f Historical Research, University o f London), the Central Research Fund (University of London), the Na§a rec Research Studentship (Belgrade), the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (Harriman Institute, Columbia University), and the Dean o f Arts’ Fund, the Humanities Research Centre Small Research Grant, and the School o f Modem Languages and Cultures Research Grant (all o f the University o f Nottingham). I thank my London publishers Christopher Hurst and Michael Dwyer, of Hurst &, Co., for deciding to publish a book that is not on Yugoslavia in a war. I hope that sacrifices that my Serbian family has made for me are at least partly rewarded by this publication. Unfortunately, neither o f my grandparents is alive to see the book about the country in which they grew up, and about events that shaped their lives probably without them noticing it much at the time. It is to their memory that this work is dedicated. Needless to say, I am solely responsible for the book’s shortcomings and for any remaining errors.

The exceptions are as follows: Personal names. Names o f rulers have been Anglicised— thus King Alexander (not Aleksandar) and Prince Paul (rather than Pavle), but Nikola Pasic, Stjepan Radic, and Petar ¿ivkovic. Place names. Exceptions to the standard Serbo-Croat spelling have only been made where an Anglicised alternative has become the norm. For example: Belgrade, not Beograd\\ but N is, instead o f Nish. Herzegovina is preferred to Hercegovina, as Bosna, Hrvatska and Srbija are spelled in English as Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, respectively. The northern Serbian province is spelled as Vojvodina, not the archaic Voyvodina (which, incidentally, means the same as Herzegovina— a Duchy). The same rule applies to names o f rivers— the original spelling is used, unless there is an accepted Anglicised form. Thus, the river is Danube, but the banovina is Dunavska (not the Danubian banovina). When other authors are quoted the original spelling is kept. (2) All translations from Serbo-Croat are mine, unless otherwise indicated.

The Con­ stitutions of 1921 and 1931 are nothing but results of this policy, the policy of hegemony of one region over all other regions. That policy has above all affected the Croats [...] At the same time, it is necessary to emphasise that although the Croats are the main opponents of the state policy and of this form of state, they are by no means alone and the only ones [in opposition]; a great majority of Serbs outside the borders of the old Kingdom of Serbia, namely the so-called ‘precani’, are equally dissatisfied [with the regime] and empathise with the Croats.1\n\nThis book is about Yugoslavia between the Wars (1918-1941). Specifically, it analyses attempts to find a compromise on the form o f state between Serbs and Croats during this turbulent period. Although ultimately a true compromise may have proved elusive, interwar Yugoslavia cannot be understood as a simple Serb-Croat dichotomy.2The emphasis on inter-ethnic conflict, favoured by most historians o f Yugoslavia, fails to explain a number o f developments during the period, most o f which sought to achieve an agreement between the country’s two largest groups. Because political contest often crossed ethnic lines, it cannot be simply reduced to its SerbCroat dimension either. 1 ‘Jedan prijedlog za Nacrt Ustava’, Nova Evropa, vol. 30, no. 7-8,26 July 1937, 228-9. 2 Nor can the post-1945 Yugoslavia or even its violent disintegration be understood this way, as recent works by Dejan Jovic {Jugoslavia: Drzava koja je odumrla, Belgrade and Zagreb, 2003) and Chip Gagnon {The Myth ofEthnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s, Ithaca, NY, 2004) demonstrate.\n\n1\n\nELUSIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\nThe book challenges the popular view that because o f competing Serb and Croat national ideologies, formed before Yugoslavia had been created, a common state was doomed to failure. Despite the importance o f historical legacy, the crisis in Yugoslavia was caused above all by the decisions made in the post-1918 period, as the pas­ sage quoted above amply illustrates, even if it fails to account for many Serbs from the old Serbian kingdom and many other nonSerbs who also opposed the regime. The analysis centres on Serbs and Croats. Because o f their nu­ merical strength, geographical position, and historical role in the development o f the Yugoslav idea and formation o f the Yugoslav state, they held the key to Yugoslavia’s unity and... disunity.3 The as­ pirations and demands of other Yugoslavs, particularly the Slovenes, the only other recognised Yugoslav ‘tribe’ in the interwar period, and the Bosnian Muslims, whose religious distinctiveness was accepted but who were not regarded as a distinct ‘tribe’, would require separate studies and are only treated in passing. The discourse o f the main Yugoslav leaders receives due consid­ eration. It is argued that their actions were not motivated by ethnic antagonism towards the ‘other’, although nationalism, sometimes in combination with political manoeuvring, did in many cases influence their actions. Although essentially a study o f conflict management at the level o f political elites, the book also provides insight into the impact of politics on ‘ordinary’ Yugoslavs. Finally, close attention is paid to detail, as the reader will undoubtedly soon realise. Such an approach has been necessary in order to illustrate 3 The best brief introduction to Yugoslavia and the peoples and territories that made it is Aleksa Djilas, The Contested Country: Yugoslav Unity and Communist Revolution, 1919-1953, Cambridge, MA, 1991, 1-14. Djilas convincingly argues that Serb-Croat relations were crucial for Yugoslavia’s survival. This is a generally accepted view, though some scholars have argued that it was a SerbSlovene, not Serb-Croat, axis that was central. (For example: Momcilo Zecevic, Na istorijskoj prekretnici. Slovenci u politici jugoslovenske driave 1919-1929., I, Belgrade and Ljubljana, 1985; and Susan L. Woodward, Balkan Tragedy: Chaos and Dissolution after the Cold War, Washington, DC, 1995.)\n\n2\n\nIN TR O D U CTIO N\n\nthe complexity o f the period and to demonstrate the plurality o f opinion, not only among Serbs and Croats generally, but also in­ side their main political parties. Finally, this book indirectly suggests that the interwar Yugoslav state should be seen within a wider, European context, rather than as an anomaly, as Yugoslavia and the Balkans are often regarded. Europe between the Wars was beset by national questions, which did not go away following the creation o f nation states at the end of the First World War. However, nationalism was not the only reason for Yugoslavia’s instability. Like most Europeans, the Yugoslavs had to contend with unprecedented destruction brought about by the Great War. They faced the difficult task o f the postwar rebuilding, not just o f infrastructure, but also o f destroyed families and societies. Yugoslavia was not even unique in being a new state, made up o f a number o f components, which had never previously come together. Like the Yugoslavs, many citizens o f European states, especially those in East-Central Europe, experienced constitutional debate, the failure o f democratic institutions to create stable governments, and their replacement by autocratic regimes. Yugoslavia could not remain immune to the post-1929 worldwide economic crisis, nor, most tragically, to the international crisis which by the end o f the 1930s culminated in another World War: the war which also de­ stroyed the South Slavs’ first attempt to live in a common state.\n\nThe book has a chronological flow, but some chapters are organised thematically; a combined chronological-thematic approach seemed most appropriate. The arguments and conclusions are based on my research into primary sources: documents held in the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb, the Archives o f Yugoslavia in Belgrade, N a­ tional Archives (formerly Public Record Office) at Kew, the archives o f Columbia University in New York, and the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University, as well as published documents, newspapers, pamphlets and memoir literature. In addition, exten­ 3\n\nELU SIVE CO M PROM ISE\n\nsive use has been made o f the relevant secondary sources in English, Serbo-Croat and, in a few instances, Slovene. The scene for the main part o f the book is set in the first two chap­ ters. The emergence o f the Croatian question in the formative years o f the Kingdom o f Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (as Yugoslavia was officially called between 1918 and 1929) is explained, and attempts by Serb and Croat political leaders to reach a compromise during the 1920s are traced. The Croatian question in this work is understood as the majority o f Croats’ refusal to accept fully the Yugoslav state cen­ tralist institutions and their determination to seek wide autonomy, even the status o f a state within a state, for Croatia. Although the constitutional debate began even before the creation o f Yugoslavia as a political contest between centralists and anti-centralists on what kind of constitution the new state should have, it eventually turned into what has generally been perceived as a Serb-Croat conflict. This debate marked the whole interwar period and was at the heart o f the political contest in the Yugoslav kingdom. The inability to find a solution to the Croatian question con­ tributed to the failure o f democratic institutions— a failure which culminated tragically with the murder o f the Croat leader Stjepan Radic and two other members o f his Croatian Peasant Party by a Serb deputy in the summer o f 1928. However, already in the 1920s leading Serb politicians attempted to accommodate Croat demands for a de-centralised Yugoslav state. In chapter three, attempts by King Alexander, Prince Paul and several prime ministers to deal with the Croatian question in the 1930s are explored. Following Alexander’s assassination in 1934, organised and carried out by the Croat Ustasa group and the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, gradual abandonment of integral Yugoslavism (an ideology which claimed that Serbs, Croats and Slovenes belonged to an ethnic whole) and relaxation o f the dic­ tatorship took place. Yet, neither the Crown nor the government was prepared to abolish or amend the 1931 Constitution, which would have been necessary in order to grant Croatia self-rule. 4\n\nIN TR O D U CTIO N\n\nCooperation between the major Serb political parties and the Croatian Peasant Party in opposition to the government— after 1935 formed by Serbs, Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims— is the subject of chapter four. The willingness o f Serbian opposition leaders to sup­ port Croat demands was symbolised by their decision to choose the Croat leader Vladko Macek as head o f the united opposition list in the 1935 and 1938 general elections. In November 1937 the SerbCroat opposition formed the Bloc o f National Agreement, which called for a return to democracy, in August 1938 Macek visited Bel­ grade, where he was greeted by tens o f thousands o f Serbs; and in December the same year the united opposition nearly defeated the government in general elections. The relative success o f the opposition in the December 1938 elec­ tions sent a powerful signal to Prince Paul that the time was ripe for a change o f government. Prime Minister Stojadinovic, whose personal ambitions were beginning to threaten the Prince Regent himself, was replaced by Dragisa Cvetkovic in February 1939. Cvetkovic soon proclaimed that the Croats had developed a separate identity and that the first aim o f his government was to grant them autonomy within Yugoslavia. Events that led to the establishment o f an au­ tonomous Croatia in August 1939 are analysed and an assessment o f the August agreement is provided in chapter five. Although’the Cvetkovic-Macek agreement may have settled the Croatian question, it also ended the Serb-Croat pro-democracy op­ position. Because many Serbs were included in the newly formed banovina (province) of Croatia and because, unlike the Croats, the Serbs were given no autonomy, the agreement led to the emergence o f a Serbian question. Serb opinion was not as homogeneous as the Croat, and there soon emerged a Serb-Serb debate over the agree­ ment and over the meaning o f Yugoslavia and Yugoslavism. The debate over the respective merits o f democracy and dictatorship was thus virtually abandoned, as Serbs, like the Croats before them, turned to the national question. 5\n\nELU SIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\nThe Serb question is analysed in chapter six. Many Serbs— both those living in autonomous Croatia and those in the rest o f Yugo­ slavia— sought to ‘rally together all their compatriots in a Serbian province (Slovenes and Bosnia’s Muslims also called for the creation o f their own banovinas). However, there were prominent Serbs, both in the government and among intellectual circles, who supported the Cvetkovic-Macek agreement.\n\nm There are alternative interpretations o f interwar Yugoslavia. Despite the dearth o f English-language works on the period, two books stand out. Ivo Banac’s seminal Ihe National Question in Yugoslavia primarily analyses the crucial interim period between the unification o f 1 December 1918 and the promulgation o f the (first) centralist Constitution in June 1921; it also provides a detailed account of the origins o f South Slav national ideologies prior to 1918. Banac contends that the conflicting Serb and Croat ideologies, developed prior to the creation o f Yugoslavia, laid the foundations for the country’s instability. While the Croats preferred co-operation with other South Slavs, the Serbs promoted state-sponsored assimilation o f non-Serbs. According to Banac, immediately after the unification ‘the national question was still susceptible to other—more equitable and pluralistic— solutions’, but after 1921, ‘despite dictatorships and attempts at democratic renewal, occupations and wars, revolutions and social changes...hardly any new elements were introduced in the set pattern o f South Slavic interactions.’5 Attempts to achieve an agreement between Serbs and Croats in the 1930s may be seen as belated if not irrelevant in this context. As this book—it is hoped—demonstrates, the way Yugoslavia was created did significantly influence interwar developments, but it is wrong to argue that a pattern o f Serb-Croat relations was set 4 Ithaca, NY, 1984. 5 Ibid., 415. Emphasis added by D. Dj. 6\n\nIN TR O D U CTIO N\n\nby 1921. Furthermore, it is debatable whether Serbian and Croatian nationalisms had been formed by 1918, and whether they remained immune to evolution following the creation o f Yugoslavia. The second key work on interwar Yugoslavia is Jacob Hoptner’s Yugoslavia in Crisis, 1934-1941:6 I f Banac’s book is more relevant for an understanding o f the national ideologies and the politics o f the early interwar years, Hoptner provides an authoritative study o f Yu­ goslavia’s international predicament in the second half o f the 1930s. He points to an interaction between foreign policy and major internal issues, such as the Serb-Croat question.7 Because o f the Croats’ and other non-Serbs’ dissatisfaction, the Yugoslav government had to be wary o f its revisionist neighbours, particularly Bulgaria, Hungary and Italy. Belgrade, backed by its traditional ally France, worked towards the establishment o f the Litde Entente and the Balkan Entente, in which Yugoslavia played a prominent part. Yugoslavia’s foreign pol­ icy changed in the second half o f the 1930s, with the re-emergence o f a strong Germany. The country found itself in an increasingly delicate position, trying to maintain neutrality in a Europe o f sharp ideological divisions. The external position tended to be influenced by internal discord, for which Hoptner blames Yugoslavia’s political leaders, ‘men o f limited vision and even less flexibility who revealed no capacity for working together’.8 Yugoslavia in Crisis is heavily based on Prince Paul’s papers, to which Hoptner had had exclusive access, and his conclusions often bear the mark o f the Prince Regent’s perspective.9 Consequendy, the 6 New York, 1962. Jozo Tomasevich’s Peasants, Politics and Economic Change in Yugoslavia (Stanford, 1955), is another outstanding work on the period, but is left out of this analysis because it is not direcdy relevant to my argument. 7 Hoptner defines the Serb-Croat question as a conflict between centralism and federalism, arguing that ‘It was the Serb-Croat divergence, although primarily an internal problem, that proved crucial in the formulation and operation of the new kingdom’s foreign policy.’ Yugoslavia in Crisis, 4. 8 Ibid., 297. 9 Because in the early 1960s Prince Paul’s papers were still unavailable to other researchers, Hoptner refers to them in his book as ‘Papers of Jacob B. 7\n\nELU SIV E CO M PRO M ISE\n\nactivities o f the Serbian opposition, and its attempts to reach a com­ promise with the Croats, are somewhat neglected. In terms o f argument and the period it covers, the present book may be positioned somewhere between the works o f Banac and Hoptner, although my understanding o f Yugoslavia’s internal dy­ namics is closer to Hoptner’s. It is hoped that this work offers a fresh interpretation o f Yugoslavia between the wars, and helps fill one of many remaining gaps in literature on the subject.10 This study would probably have been impossible without the foun­ dation provided by historians o f the interwar period based in former Yugoslavia. Yugoslav historians began seriously to research the his­ tory o f the interwar Kingdom in the late 1950s, after a signal had came from above. In 1957, formally at the initiation o f the Society of Historians o f Serbia and Association o f Historical Societies o f Yugo­ slavia, a group o f leading Yugoslav historians organised a seminar on the interwar history. The result was an edited volume which came out the following year; its authors stressed that the book represented only the first step toward future, ‘proper’ studies o f the Kingdom o f Yugo­ slavia.11 As Vaso Cubrilovic explained in the introduction, the book had two main aims: to fill an existing gap in the historical literature and to introduce the study o f contemporary history, mostly in order\n\nHoptner’ (JBH). 10 For example, students of Yugoslavia still await critical biographies of King Alexander and Nikola Pasic. Gligorijevic’s trilogy on King Alexander (see the bibliography) is overall very useful, but at times hagiographie and ultimately disappointing. Another significant gap, a study of the life and work of Stjepan Radié, has at last been filled by Mark Biondich’s Stjepan Radié, the Croat Peasant Party, and the Politics ofMass Mobilization, 1904-1928, Toronto, 2000. Christian Axboe Nielsen’s meticulously researched and unpublished doctoral thesis explores the impact on daily life of King Alexander’s dictatorship, despite its tide (‘One State, One Nation, One King: The Dictatorship of King Aleksandar and His Yugoslav Project, 1929-1935’, Columbia University, 2002). 11 Sergije Dimitrijevic et al.

It came out in 1961 and, unsurprisingly, it presented the official view held in the socialist Yugoslavia o f its royalist predecessor—that the ‘Greater Serbian bourgeoisie’, in some cases aided by its Croatian and Slov­ enian counterparts, established a hegemony and led the country to political and economic collapse even before the invasion by the Axis powers in April 1941.13 I f the number o f general histories o f interwar Yugoslavia is scarce, studies on more specific aspects o f the history o f the period abound. From the mid-1960s onwards— coinciding with attempts by the authorities to introduce economic and political reforms—Yugoslav historians produced a number o f invaluable books and articles on the interwar political parties and key developments.14 Based on the then newly accessible archival records, these studies offered a wealth of information, while making sure the official interpretation o f the period remained unchallenged. Such an approach to the writing of history was probably the only possible one. Official historiography, following the end o f the Second World War, served the legitimisation o f the new regime, and academic historians often sought refuge in medieval and early modern history, avoiding subjects concerned\n\n12 Vaso Cubrilovié, TJvod u istoriju Jugoslavie od 1918. do 1945.’, in Dimitrijevic et al.

Apart from Dimitrijevic and Cubrilovic, other contributors included Ferdo Culinovic, Pero Damjanovic, Edib Hasanagic, Dragoslav Jankovic, Bogdan Krizman, Jovan Maijanovic and Pero Moraca, the crème de la crème of Yugoslavia’s official historiography. Some of these historians were probably also responsible for an earlier volume, a history of interwar political parties: Istorija gradjanskih stranaka uJugoslaviji, Belgrade, vol. 1, 1952 (authors) unknown). To the best of my knowledge, die projected second volume, which would have looked into the history of fascist and profascist parties and movements among the South Slavs, was never published. 13 Ferdo Culinovic, Jugoslavia izmedju dva rata, 2 vols., Zagreb, 1961. 14 See the bibliography for details on secondary literature on the period produced in socialist Yugoslavia. 9\n\nELU SIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\nwith the more recent past.15 Although from the mid-1980s ‘na­ tion’ increasingly replaced ‘class’ as the dominant ideology, the next generation o f (mostly Belgrade-based) scholars continued with the well-established, largely positivist approach to Yugoslavia’s interwar history, producing several key works on the period.16\n\nMy own approach acknowledges the importance of pre-1918 his­ tory, o f ethnic rivalries and differences, and the significance o f class, as well as o f external factors. However, I consider political events as they developed after the unification as equally if not more important for an understanding o f the period. Political actors were active rather than pre-programmed ‘agents’, who sometimes acted out o f genuine beliefs, but sometimes out o f pragmatism, and whose views, in many cases, evolved during the period. Benefits o f such ‘instrumentalist’ approach will hopefully become clear to the reader as s/he engages with the book.\n\n15 Stevan K. Pavlowitch, The Improbable Survivor: Yugoslavia and its Problems, 1918-1988, London, 1988, 129. In that respect Yugoslav historiography mirrored that of the Soviet Union, despite the 1948 split between Moscow and Belgrade. As Eric Hobsbawm wrote, ‘[i]f one was a serious Soviet historian, the best thing was to stick to the history of the ancient East and the Middle Ages, although it was touching to see how the modernists rushed to say (within the constraints of the permissible) what they knew to be true every time the window seemed to be slightly opened—as in 1956 and in the early 1960s.’ Interesting Times: A Twentieth Century Life, London, 2003, 291. Nevertheless Yugoslav modem historiography produced some first class scholarship, such as the work by Ljubo Boban, Milorad Ekmeiic and Andrej Mitrovic (see the bibliography for references). 16 This type of transformation was of course not unusual in East-Central Europe and it mirrored—in some cases even preceded—the transformation of the political scene. Just like in the sphere of politics, the transformation is often not complete. Even in the works by more obviously nationalist historians, such as Vasilije Krestid in Serbia or the late Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, who had been a professional historian in the 1960s, old communist phraseology and even interpretations are visible. 10\n\nIN TRO D U CTIO N\n\nM ost works dealing with interwar Yugoslavia address, in one way or another, the Croatian question. However, what is lacking in the existing literature is an analysis o f Serb and Croat attempts to find a compromise vis-à-vis Yugoslavia and Yugoslavism and reach a solu­ tion to the Croatian question. A search for compromise and for a Serb-Croat agreement dominated the Yugoslav politics in the inter­ war period, and especially in the 1930s. What follows is a (hi)story o f that search.\n\n11\n\n1\n\nDEATH AND UNION Too far are Belgrade and Zagreb from each other in the first months of 1919; even the fastest [Zagreb-Belgrade] trains regularly take 27 hours to reach their destination, and due to postwar conditions they are running late every day. A trip from Zagreb to Belgrade, and the other way round, is an uncomfortable journey; cars are not heated and windows are broken; people are reluctant to travel. This makes contacts [between Serbia and Croatia] very difficult.1\n\nAt 10.00a.m. on 27 November 1918, a special train left Zagreb’s main railway station for Belgrade, the capital o f Serbia, just liberated after three years o f the Austro-Hungarian occupation. The train’s sole passengers were delegates o f the National Council, the govern­ ment o f the newly-formed, internationally unrecognised State o f Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs. The sense o f historic importance o f their mission probably overwhelmed the fatigue and stress the group must have felt. The lengthy and intense debate over the unification with Serbia, which began on 23 November, had finally concluded around 11.00p.m. the previous night. The National Council convened at the time when the Habsburg Monarchy was rapidly disintegrating, Ital­ ian troops were moving into Dalmatia, and social unrest threatened the young state’s authorities. Only neighbouring Serbia, with its re­ vitalised and victorious army and its international prestige elevated, 1 Josip Horvat, Politicka povijest Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1990, 2 vols, vol. 2, 158 (Fust published as Politilka povijest Hrvatske, 1918-1929, Zagreb, 1938). Horvat, a journalist and a member of the Croatian Peasant Party, witnessed some of the most important events during Yugoslavia’s formative period. His book is an invaluable and highly readable contemporary account of Yugoslavia in the 1920s.\n\n12\n\nD EA TH AND UNION\n\nwhose aim since the early stages o f the war had been the liberation and unification o f Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, could provide a sense o f security and protection. The train was forced to move slower than usual because o f thick fog, and the passing countryside reminded the delegates o f the devastation brought about by the war which had barely ended. The delegation arrived around 11.00p.m. in Zemun, where it spent the night, before crossing over the Danube to Belgrade the following morning. There, the delegates were greeted by enthusiastic crowds of Serbs and by the few political leaders present in the city.2 The Zagreb delegation travelled to Belgrade in order to invite Serbia’s leaders to proclaim the unification o f South Slavs into one state. The text o f the invitation had been drawn up by the National Council, during the historic session o f 23-24 November. By the end o f the session the National Council had overwhelmingly voted for unification with Serbia, but not before heated discussion. The main arguments and concerns raised at the time, in hindsight, highlighted the origins o f subsequent debates on the institutional structure of the Yugoslav kingdom and therefore deserve a close scrutiny. Before examining the discussion in the National Council in more detail, it is necessary to first sketch out the context in which it took place.\n\nThe First World War and the Yugoslav Question For an independent and united Yugoslavia to be formed, the O t­ toman and Habsburg monarchies had to give way. The Ottomans’ presence in Europe all but ended as a result o f the First Balkan War o f 1912. The Second Balkan War o f 1913 nearly doubled the territory o f Serbia and enhanced its prestige among the South Slavs living in Austria-Hungary. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Habsburg throne, was assassinated in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, more than half o f the future Yugoslavia was part of Austria-Hungary: Slovenia, Croatia, Vojvodina, and Bosnia-Herze2 Ibid., 131. 13\n\nELU SIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\ngovina. Only Serbia (which included what is today Kosovo and M ac­ edonia) and Montenegro were independent states. The archduke’s assassin was Gavrilo Princip, a twenty-year-old member o f ‘Young Bosnia’, a revolutionary youth movement that campaigned for the breakup o f the Dual Monarchy and the unification o f its South Slavs with Serbia. Although Young Bosnians were armed and financially aided by the TJnification or Death’ (a.k.a. ‘Black Hand’), a secret Serbian organisation led by Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevic Apis, of­ ficial Belgrade was not behind the assassination. Nevertheless, for Vienna and Budapest the murder o f the archduke presented an ideal opportunity to bring to an end Serbia’s threat to the empire. When an ultimatum was rejected by Belgrade, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July. This proved to be the beginning o f the Fust World War.3 Serbia’s war aims included territorial aggrandisement at the ex­ pense o f the Habsburg Monarchy. In early September 1914 the Ser­ bian coalition government of Nikola Pasic informed its allies that it would aim to create, ‘out o f Serbia, a strong south-western Slavonic state, that would include all Serbs, all Croats, and all Slovenes.’4 On 7 December, the government, evacuated to the southern city o f Nis, formally proclaimed its aim to ‘liberate and unite all our unliber­ ated brethren: Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes’ into one state.5 The 3 For a brief description of the formation of Yugoslavia see Slobodan Jovanovic, Ustavno pravo Kraljevine Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca, Belgrade, 1995 (first published by Geca Kon in 1924), 31-51.

A large state would stand a better chance o f confronting an­ tagonistic powers such as the Habsburg Monarchy in future. Such a state could be best achieved by the unification o f ethnically related South Slav peoples; the existence o f the Yugoslav idea provided the necessary ideology. In addition to ethnic kinship, the South Slavs were connected by the common danger o f pan-Germanic expansion. Finally, the unification should be carried out around Serbia, which had already emerged prior to the war as the centre o f the South Slav liberation struggle.6 There was some confusion among Serbian cabinet ministers as to the exact meaning o f Yugoslavism: was it above all an idea of Serb-Croat unity, or should the Slovenes—perhaps even the Bulgar­ ians— be included, too? Other issues concerned the most appropri­ ate name for the new nation and the new state, and whether the idea of pan-Serb unification (including plans for a union between Serbia and Montenegro) and Yugoslavism could go hand in hand.7 Serbia’s political elites accepted the Yugoslav idea much later then their Croatian and Serbian counterparts in the Habsburg Monar­ chy, where Yugoslavism originated in the first half o f the nineteenth century. After the war started, the Serbian government consulted the country's leading intellectuals, who had showed considerably more interest in Yugoslavism in the years before the war.8 The term ‘Greater Serbia’ was not used by Serbia’s political leaders, at least not in official documents. Military leaders did refer to it, albeit often to describe Serbia’s ‘greatness’ and ‘glory’, rather than a political pro­ 6 Andrej Mitrovid, Srbija u Prvom svetskom ratu, Belgrade, 2nded., 2004,138. 7 Ibid., 139.

The committee’s leaders were two Dalmatian Croats, Ante Trumbic and Frano Supilo, and its activities were largely propagandistic.11 Following Serbia’s military defeat in late 1915, King Peter I, the government, and a decimated army reached the safety o f the Greek island o f Corfu after an epic retreat through the mountains o f Montenegro and Albania during the winter o f 1915-16. The combi­ nation o f such a precarious situation and pressure from the Entente powers to give up claims to Dalmatia and Istria in favour o f Italy, in exchange for Rome’s entry in the war on the Allied side— to keep a promise made to Italy by Britain, France and Russia in the secret Treaty o f London o f April 1915 - allegedly led Pasic to reconsider his government’s ‘maximalist’ aim, Yugoslav unification. Instead, he had to be content, for the time being at least, with an enlarged Serbia that would include Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and possibly Serb-populated parts o f Croatia. It would be wrong to conclude, however, that Pasic was offered a ‘Greater Serbia’ by the Powers. Serbia was not a signatory to the London Treaty, and Pasic learned o f its contents indirectly, from Serbia’s diplomatic representatives to Paris and Rome and from Supilo. Although in the summer o f 1915 the British proposed to 9 Mitrovic, Srbija, 141. 10 Ibid. An article on the formation of Yugoslavia published on 7 December 1918 in the London Times was entitled ‘Greater Serbia: Regent accepts offer of redeemed Slavs’. 11 Trumbid and Supilo were among the few members of the Committee who chose to not receive financial support from the Serbian government in order to maintain an independent position. The Serbian government had a representative inside the committee (in later stages it was Stojan Protic, member of the Radical Party and the first Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes), while Dinko Trinajstic of the Yugoslav Committee was attached to the Serbian government at Corfu. 16\n\nD EA TH AND UNION\n\nthe Serbian government territorial compensation at the expense o f the Habsburg Monarchy in exhange for Serbia giving up its share o f Macedonia (parts o f which Serbia gained at the expense o f Bul­ garia in the Second Balkan War), with which the Allies had tried unsuccessfully to entice Bulgaria to join the war on their side, similar bargaining with territories was not uncommon during the war. Until the later stages o f the war, not many could have predicted the dis­ integration o f the Habsburg Monarchy, let alone the war’s outcome and the postwar map of Europe. Serbia’s government would have preferred the creation o f a large South Slav state and, in any case, it is debatable whether a viable alternative was available at the end o f the war.12 Although Palic did appear to backtrack on the issue o f creation o f a Yugoslavia in 1916, the Serbian Prince Regent Alexander con­ tinued to publicly support the Yugoslav option.13 A t a reception in London’s Claridge’s Hotel14 in April that year, Alexander told his British hosts that the Serbian army fought for ‘the ideal towards the attainment o f which we have striven for centuries. This ideal is the\n\n12 It is therefore incorrect to argue that the then Serbian leadership made a fatal mistake, or a noble sacrifice, by choosing Yugoslavia over an enlarged Serbian state, as it has been suggested in recent years in non-scholarly as well as some scholarly circles in Serbia. See the debate between Dubravka Stojanovic and Kosta Nikolic, two Belgrade historians with opposing views on the issue, in the Belgrade weekly Vreme, no. 624, 19 December 2002, and no. 628, 16 January 2003. 13 Alexander was the second son of King Peter I and Princess Zorka of Montenegro, who died before her husband became king in 1903. He became heir to the throne in 1909, because his elder brother George’s bad temper was deemed unsuitable for a future king. In June 1914 Alexander was proclaimed the Prince Regent and from then on ruled in the name of his ailing father, King Peter I. He became Icing upon Peter’s death in August 1921. 14 The same hotel where inJuly 1945 Alexander’s grandson and namesake would be bom.

Supilo wanted the Committee to sever its relations with Paiic and his ministers, but Trumbic refused to take such a radical line. In this he was supported by other members o f the Committee, who believed that the two sides must work together towards unifica­ tion, while any differences would be worked out after the war. Supilo resigned from the Committee in protest, effectively ending his po­ litical career even before his untimely death the following year.16 The conflict between Trumbic and Supilo was not the only disa­ greement within the Committee. Its dependence on Serbia and the Entente, a lack o f political legitimacy, and its mixed membership— the majority were Croats, but there were also Serbs and Slovenes— all created antagonisms. This internal disunity led Thomas G . Masaryk, after the war the first president o f Czechoslovakia, to observe that ‘already since 1916 [the Yugoslav Committee] was dangerously un­ stable’, and Jovan Jovanovic Pizon, the Serbian minister to London (and the fixture leader o f the Agrarians), to write in his diaiy in May 1917, that ‘[because o f internal divisions] the Yugoslav Committee\n\n15 ‘Deputation to the Prince Regent: A Nation’s Ideal’, The Times, 6 April 1916. Alexander’s statement provides not only an example of his early Yugoslavism, but also an insight into his understanding of Yugoslav nationhood. Following the proclamation of the royal dictatorship in January 1929, Alexander tried to impose ‘integral’ Yugoslavism from above. Like in 1916, he (and other ‘integral’ Yugoslavs) argued in the post-1929 period that Serbs, Croats and Slovenes belonged to a single, ethnic nation, which had been divided for centuries by foreign rule. 16 For more on the Yugoslav Committee, its relationship with Pa£i£’s government, and its precarious international position, see Gale Stokes, The Role of the Yugoslav Committee in the Formation of Yugoslavia’, in Dimitrije Djordjevid (ed.), The Creation of Yugoslavia, 1914-1918, Santa Barbara, CA, 1980, 51-67. 18\n\nD EA TH AND UNION\n\nwas no longer functioning’.17 It unquestionably weakened the Com ­ mittee’s position vis-à-vis the Serbian government and those South Slav leaders leaders who remained in Austria-Hungary. The year 1917 proved to be particularly eventful. In February, a spontaneous uprising against the occupying forces broke out in the Serbian region o f Toplica, only to be brutally suppressed the follow­ ing month.18 In May, the Habsburg South Slavs pushed for more autonomy within the Empire. During the spring a three-sided power struggle between Prince Regent Alexander and a group o f officers loyal to him (known as the ‘White Hand’), Colonel Apis and the ‘Black Hand’, and PaSié’s Radicals came to a head. The ‘Black Hand’ was accused o f conspiring against the government and even o f plotting the assassination o f the Prince Regent. Apis and two other members o f the secret organisation were executed in June, after a show trial held in Salonika. Although Alexander got rid o f a dangerous political opponent, the whole episode destabilised the government, damaged the relationship between Paiié and the Prince Regent, and somewhat marred Serbia’s international reputation.19 In hindsight, it was an early sign o f the Prince Regent’s autocratic tendencies.20 In the international arena, the entry of the United States o f America into the war in April and Russia’s withdrawal following the November (October O.S.) revolution provided two turning points.

They issued a joint declaration, announcing that after the war, Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, ‘who are also known by the name o f southern Slavs or Yugoslavs’, would unite in one state, ‘a constitutional, democratic, and Parliamentary Monarchy, under the [Serbian] Karageorgevitch Dynasty’, which would be named ‘the Kingdom o f Serbs, Croats and Slovenes’.23 The future state was thus predestined to become a monarchy, under the Serbian dynasty, even before it was created and before such vital decisions could be tested by democratic means. In a debate with Panic’s Radicals in the mid-1920s, Trumbic ar­ gued that on Corfu he had resolutely rejected centralism.24 However, he had also expressed reservations about federalism, stating during the Corfu meeting that, while in favour o f wide regional autonomies, ‘I do not have any illusions in respect to federal system o f govern­ ment, because I cannot see how it would benefit the progress o f our national development.’25 M ost members of the Yugoslav Committee supported Trumbic and the concept o f a unitary decentralised state, although some supported the Serbian centralist argument.26 There­ fore, although both sides formally rejected federalism, centralism was 21 As did Vladimir Ilich Lenin, though for different ideological reasons. 22 See Michael Boro Petrovich, ‘Russia’s Role in the Creation of the Yugoslav State, 1914-1918’, in Djordjevii (ed.), The Creation ofYugoslavia, 73-94. 23 For a detailed analysis of the Corfu Declaration, see Jankovic, Jugoslovensko pitanje, 189-207,288-98.

Those opposed to centralism argued for a compromise solution, a system o f government that was neither centralist nor federalist, but they did not fully elaborate what that would involve. The Corfu statesmen failed to specify whether the future state should be a centralised or a decentralised one, and are often blamed by historians for this failure. After the unification the debate on what form of government was best for the country would be renewed. The centralist argument would eventually win, but only just; this, in turn, led to a long crisis, which plagued the interwar Yugoslav state throughout its existence. However, the differences at the Corfu meeting were less pronounced than has been subsequendy assumed. It may be argued that both the centralists and anti-centralists left the conference believing that although the future system o f government had not been decided, their arguments had effectively won.27 Both sides agreed that the future state would be a monarchy, with the Serbian Karadjordjevic dynasty at its helm. That the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes belonged to the same ethnic group was not even ques­ tioned. They were considered ‘tribes’ (plemena) o f a single, ‘trinominal nation’ (troimeni narod).29The ‘Serbo-Croat-Slovene’ nation was also referred to as the ‘Yugoslav' nation, or, in the jargon o f the day, ‘race’, and occasionally even as a single ‘tribe’ (jugoslovensko pleme or srpskohrvatsko-slovenacko pleme), by advocates o f a South Slav union. Even before the war both opponents and proponents o f Yugoslav unification regarded Serbs and Croats as a single nation. For instance, the 1910 Austro-Hungarian population census included among the Empire’s nationalities ‘Serbo-Croats’. The foremost British expert on South Slav history (and later a close supporter o f the Yugoslav Committee), R.W. Seton-Watson, wrote in 1911 that Serbs and 27 Ibid., 244. 28 Ibid., 221-2. Narod in Serbo-Croat also means ‘people’. Another SerboCroat word for nation, nacija, was used less frequently at the time. Bosnian Muslims were believed to differ from Serbs and Croats in religion only, while Eastern Orthodox Montenegrins and Macedonians were considered members of the Serbian ‘tribe’, although very few of the latter actually felt Serbian. 21\n\nELU SIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\nCroats belonged to one, Yugoslav, ‘race’ which would eventually unite, just like the Italian and German ‘races’ had done in the nine­ teenth century.29 In September 1914, three months before the Nis Declaration, Seton-Watson praised The Times for its writing about ‘our gallant Servian allies’. Tt is high time that the splendid qualities o f the Serbo-Croat race should be more widely realized among us’, he wrote, adding: But it is not enough for us to consider Servia. The Southern Slav question as a whole is one of the most vital issues raised by this war, and the day is already drawing near when, in conjunction with our friends in Russia, we must endeavour to ensure its lasting solution. The whole future of the Serb, Croat, Slovene race is at stake. The movement for unity among the three kindred peoples has rapidly gathered strength during the last five years, and nothing can arrest its progress.30 Ironically perhaps, given the obstacle Italy posed to the creation o f a Yugoslav state, the Yugoslav unification movement was often compared to the Italian one. Another prominent British historian, G .M . Trevelyan, recalled in the same newspaper his visit to Serbia before the war. Trevelyan had encountered young men who spoke o f Serbia as a new Piedmont and saw books on the Italian Risorgimento displayed in Belgrade shops as well as ‘on the table in the waiting room o f their Foreign Office’. ‘Servia is indeed now engaged in a war o f liberation similar to that undertaken by Piedmont for the other Italian provinces.’ wrote Trevelyan. ‘And Russia is playing the part o f Napoleon III.’31 29 R.W. Seton-Watson, TheSouthern Slav Question and the Habshurg Monarchy, London, 1911, 336. 30 ‘Southern Slav Patriotism’, letter of R.W. Seton-Watson to the editor, The Times, 16 September 1914. Seton-Watson continued to regard Serbs and Croats (and sometimes Slovenes as well) as one nation in his later writings; see for instance his article The Background of the Jugoslav Dictatorship’, Slavonic Review, vol. 10, no. 29, December 1931, 363-76. 31 ‘Aims of a Small Nation’, letter of G.M. Trevelyan to the editor, The Times, 18 September 1914. Giuseppe Garibaldi and Italian revolutionaries provided inspiration to both Yugoslav and Serbian national movements. Mihajlo Pupin, the American scientist of Serb origin, remembered how in his Serbian village 22\n\nD EA TH A N D UNION\n\nThe Slovenes were not regarded as identical to Serbs and Croats, chiefly because o f their separate language, but during this period many Slovenes saw themselves— and were seen by others— as part o f the Yugoslav nation.32 Thus even those with a deep knowledge o f South Slav affairs, such as Seton-Watson, in the passage quoted above, referred to both Serb-Croat and Serb-Croat-Slovene national unity. South Slav leaders sometimes overemphasised the unity o f the three ‘tribes’, perhaps aware o f the support in the United States for the principle o f national self-determination. They often referred to Serb-Croat-Slovene linguistic unity, even though they must have known that Slovene was a separate language from Serbo-Croat.33 When the war broke out, Habsburg Yugoslavs had litde choice but to declare their loyalty to the Monarchy. Anti-Serb riots fol­ lowing the Sarajevo assassination created an atmosphere o f hostility not just against the Serbs but also against pro-Yugoslav Croats and Slovenes. However, as the war entered its later stages, things began to change. In 1917 South Slav members o f the Vienna Reichsrat formed their own parliamentary group— the Yugoslav Club—just like Czech and Polish deputies had previously done.34 On 30 May 1917 the Club, under the chairmanship o f Anton KoroSec, leader o f the Slovene People’s Party (and in the interwar period one o f the\n\nin southern Hungary (present-day Vojvodina) Garibaldi was known as ‘the Karageoige of Italy*. The Pupins’ living room was adorned, in addition to the icon of the family's patron saint, by pictures of Karadjordje (archaic spelling Karageorge, the leader of the Fust Serbian Uprising against the Ottomans in 1804-1813), the Russian Tsar, and Garibaldi.

Nevertheless, the language was officially called Serbo-Croat-Slovene throughout the interwar period. 34 The most detailed and useful narrative of South Slav politics in the Habsburg Monarchy during the war, which concentrates on Serb-Croat relations and contains numerous quotations of primary sources, is Bogdan Krizman, Hruatska u Prvom svjetskom ratu: Hrvatsko-srpskipolititki odnosi, Zagreb, 1989. 23\n\nELUSIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\nmost influential figures on the Yugoslav political scene), issued a declaration, demanding, On the basis of the principle of nationality and of the historical rights of the Croatian State, the unification of all those territories in the Monarchy in­ habited by Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs into an independent and democratic state, free from domination by any foreign nation, under the sceptre of the dynasty of Habsburg and Lorraine.35 The May Declaration and the Corfu Declaration therefore differed in one crucial element: while the latter called for an independent Yugoslavia, the former envisaged the unification o f Habsburg South Slavs within the Empire, partly on the basis o f the Croat state right.36 What the two declarations had in common was their reference to the principle o f national self-determination, at the time championed by the United States.37The U S rejected the politics o f secret treaties and promoted the right to national self-determination, which, as it turned out, favoured Yugoslav unification.38 The declaration by the Yugoslav Club was warmly received in Croatia’s sabor (diet). Ante Pavelid, a leading member of the CroatSerb Coalition,39 enthusiastically placed the declaration in the wider context of a Europe awakened by ‘the democratic spirit of the great and enlightened Russia’ .40 The importance of the May Declaration lay not only in that it spread the pro-Yugoslav action within the 35 ‘Deklaracija Jugoslovenskoga kluba (Bed, 30. maja 1917.)’, Dokumenti, 94. 36 An ideology which emphasised the continued existence of Croatian statehood on the basis of legal documents and the sabor. See Miijana Gross, Povijestpravaske ideologije, Zagreb, 1973. 37 For an argument that the two declarations were not as mutually exclusive as is often believed see K. St. Pavlowitch, The First World War’, 34. 38 This is convincingly argued in Mitrovid, The Yugoslav Question’, 46. 39 A coalition of the main Croat and Habsburg Serb political parties which advocated the ‘national oneness’ of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and their unification into a single state. In 1906 it won the elections for the sabor, remaining its largest group until the diet dissolved itself in 1918. Ante Pavelic is not to be confused with the Ustasa leader of the same name. 40 Krizman, Hrvatska u Prvom svjetskom ratu, 109. Pavelid was, of course, referring to the Russian March (February, O.S.)

By September 1918, when Emperor Karl (who had succeeded Franz Josef in 1916) sent Count Istvdn Tisza to the southern parts of the Empire to report on situation on the ground, it was clear the Habsburg control over the South Slav territories could not be maintained for too long. Tisza was shocked by the hostility and anti-Habsburg sentiment he encountered, and yet he told the loyal Croatian General Stjepan Sarkotid that ‘Hungary remains strong and will deal with its enemies!’42 The events of October and November 1918 took place in quick succession. The Serbian army successfully liberated the country, entering Belgrade on 1 November, expelling the last enemy soldiers two days later. On 8 October, Habsburg Yugoslavs formed the Na­ tional Council—a de facto government based in Zagreb. KoroSec was elected its president, while Pavelid and Svetozar Pribidevic, the leading Croat and Serb in the Croat-Serb coalition, respectively, became its vice-presidents. On 29 October Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia declared the formation and independence of ‘the uni­ fied national sovereign State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs on the whole ethnographic territory of that nation.’43 The ban (governor) of Croatia Antun Mihalovich proclaimed that there was no longer need 41 K.

The sequence of events illustrates well the legalistic way of thinking characteristic of the Habsburg tradition, which was not abandoned even during the revolutionary changes taking place in the disintegrating Empire. Although some Croats tend to point out that it was only after they entered the union with Belgrade that Croatia lost its statehood, ap­ parently preserved despite the Pacta Conventa with Hungary of 1102 and the incorporation into Austria in 1526-7, the Croatian sabor in fact dissolved itself, on its own will, more than a month before a united Yugoslavia was proclaimed. Serbia sacrificed its sovereignty upon entering the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes on 1 De­ cember 1918, as did Montenegro by uniting with Serbia a week pre­ viously. But so did the historic Croatia, by giving up symbols of its medieval statehood upon entering the short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs on 29 October 1918.44 The act of 29 October was part of the same process which led to the proclamation o f the union in Belgrade on 1 December. The State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs was in that sense a ‘temporary’ Yugoslavia, until the ‘real’ one, which would include Serbia and Montenegro, could be proclaimed. This point would be made in the National Council’s address to the Prince Regent of Serbia, on 1 De­ cember 1918. The leaders of the three organisations representing South Slavs— the Serbian government, the National Council and the Yugoslav Committee—met in Geneva in early November 1918, to discuss the terms of unification. The aim of the meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Serbia’s opposition, was to produce 44 As Slobodan Jovanovii explains: In the new state, the Croatian sabor could not exercise executive power, that is why at the same session [of 29 October]... the sabor proclaimed that it “recognises the supreme authority of the National Council of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs.” The ban [Mihalovich] declared, in the name of the Croatian government, that he completely accepted the position of the Croatian sabor and was therefore handing over executive power to the National Council. Thus, by the free will of the Croatian sabor and the Croatian ban, an independent Croatian state ceased to exist, in order for a new state of Austro-Hungarian Yugoslavs to be created.’ Ustavnopravo, 34. 26\n\nD E A TH AND UNION\n\na declaration on Yugoslav unification to be presented to the Entente powers, but differences immediately emerged. While Pa§i 159, 163. 151\n\nELUSIVE CO M PRO M ISE\n\nCroat, Serb, and Slovene identities only existed within the ‘national oneness’ ideology. ‘I f those two concepts can be reconciled we are ready to accept them. If, however, the recognition o f Croat individu­ ality means the negation and abandonment o f the Yugoslav national thought, we cannot accept that.’114 The three Serbian parties were often unable to present a com­ mon platform. For instance, the Agrarians, themselves disunited, sought alternative political action, outside the United Opposition. Jovanovic Pizon had hoped to form a common ‘agrarian front’ with other peasant parties in Yugoslavia, including the Croatian Peasant Party.115 He believed that his party could achieve an agreement with the Croats much quicker if it acted independently o f the Democrats and Radicals.116 This led the other two parties o f the UO to accuse the Agrarians o f treason.117\n\nThe Concordat crisis Differences o f opinion within the United Opposition were to be put aside during the Concordat crisis o f July and August 1937. In July 1935, thirteen years after they had first started negotiations, the Yu­ goslav government and the Holy See signed a Concordat regulating the position o f the Roman Catholic Church in Yugoslavia.118 The government hoped to attract Croat support at the expense o f the Croatian Peasant Party and saw the Concordat as a way o f solving the Croatian question. As Stojadinovic told the parliament in sum­ mer 1937, ‘The Concordat means agreement (sporazum). Who with, gentlemen? With the Holy See. Who does the Holy See represent?\n\n114 Cited in ibid., 166-7. 115 Ibid., 110-11. 116 MPHSS-1, 299; Radojevié, Udruzena opozicija> 173. 117 Radojevic, Udruzena oJ>ozicija} 173; Stojkov, Opozicija, 279. 118 For details see AJ 37/25/195, ‘Projekt zakona o Konkordatu izmedju Sv.

The Serbian Orthodox Church instantly complained that the Concordat was concluded at its expense.120 It argued that although there were more Orthodox than Roman Catholic believers in Yugoslavia, the latter were put in a favourable position by the state. Among other com­ plaints, the Serbian church pointed out that under the terms o f the Concordat children from mixed marriages where one parent was a Roman Catholic were to be raised as Catholics; and that the state had only 30 days during which to object to the Vatican’s nominations o f Catholic Bishops in Yugoslavia, while in the case o f Orthodox bishops no such deadline existed. Roman Catholics were allegedly given special privileges in education and the army, and the Vatican would be free to spread its propaganda in Yugoslavia.121 Street demonstrations led by Orthodox priests broke out in Belgrade and other Serbian towns, while Stojadinovic and Serbian members o f the government were excommunicated by the Church. Suddenly, shouts o f djavo (‘devil’ in Serbo-Croat, a play on lvodja (leader), as Stojadinovic liked to be called) and Jereza (a nickname for the JR Z , which sounds similar to Serbo-Croat for ‘heresy’) gained additional meanings. Demonstrators were joined by Zivkovic’s and Ljotic’s supporters, and even by the Communists, but the Demo­ crats, the Agrarians and Stanojevic’s Radicals kept a relatively low\n\n119 AJ 37/2/9-11, draft of Stojadinovics speech to the Skupstina [Belgrade], 23 July 1937. 120 See Primedbe i prigovori na projekat Konkordata izmedju nase drzave i Vatikana, Sremski Karlovci, 1936. 121 The Concordat crisis received significant attention in Britain, where some leading members of the Anglican Church sided with the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Serbian churches displayed black flags, church bells tolled intermittendy, while crowds shouted ‘the police have killed our bishop!’ when the news spread that Bishop Simeun, one o f the lead­ ers o f the procession, had been taken to a Belgrade hospital after a gendarme hit his metal episcopal crown and allegedly damaged his skull.123 The Bishop luckily did not die— it turned out he had only received minor injuries— but other casualties were reported. The gendarmerie responded with violence, charging with bayonets and firing guns in the air. T o make matters worse, the Patriarch died only hours after the Concordat was ratified on 23 July, and rumours immediately spread that he had been poisoned by the regime.124The funeral was attended by thousands o f mourners, including representatives o f the Crown— but not the government— as well as representatives o f Yugoslavia’s Muslim leaders, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, and Serbian op­ position parties.

Upon hearing that the Patriarch was seriously ill, Prince Paul immediately sent an emissary to Metropolitan Dositej, to ask about the Patriarch’s health. Dositej told the emissary that the Patriarch’s death was imminent, and that it was unfortunate he was dying on the same night when the Concordat was being voted in. ‘But God is just!’, Dositej added, raising his voice.

Despite the brutal police action, Stojadinovic believed that in dealings with the Serbian Church a firmer position should be adopted.126 Foreign newspapers reporting on the crisis were either bought up by the government or simply returned unsold,127 while a long-serving Belgrade corre­ spondent o f Reuters was no longer welcome in the country.128 The government allegedly also considered a clampdown on opposition leaders.129 Owing to public pressure, Stojadinovic eventually backed down, withdrawing the document from further parliamentary procedure in late July 1937.130 The Prime Minister explained his decision: I therefore recommend that the question of the Concordat be taken off the agenda for the time being. We have shown good will and strong will to ratify the Concordat, but we wish the Concordat to pass [parliamentary procedure] while the atmosphere among the people is more positive and reconciliatory.

One such incident took place on 15 August in Mladenovac, a small town south o f Belgrade. When a crowd besieged the house o f a local government deputy who had voted for the Concor­ dat, the gendarmerie intervened brutally, killing two or three people (depending on the source) and wounding several.132 The three major Serbian parties joined the opposition to the Concordat partly because it seemed like a good opportunity to bring Stojadinovic down. The Democrats were the first to criticise the Concordat, as early as December 1936, when Ivan Ribar, the most prominent Croat member o f the party (as a member o f the Execu­ tive Committee), entered into a debate with a Catholic newspaper.133 However, during the 1937 crisis, the Serbian opposition leaders remained relatively passive— although this was a good opportunity to further destabilise the government—careful not to alienate the Croats. They wrote to Prince Paul, appealing to him to give mandate to a ‘people’s government’, formed by the opposition. The Prince Regent never replied.134 The Concordat crisis showed that the relationship between the Serb-dominated government and Serb nationalism was not amica­ ble. Seen in retrospect, the crisis was a prelude to the emergence o f the Serbian question two years later. At the same time, however, 131 AJ 37/2/9-11, draft of Stojadinovii’s speech to the skupitina (Belgrade), July 1937.

One reason was that Macek chose to stay out o f the debate over the Concordat.136 During the crisis, he sent a message to his Serbian counterparts, stat­ ing that if the opposition succeeded in forming a new government, he would propose taking the Concordat off the agenda. ‘We Croats do not need a Concordat, nor do the Serbs,’ Macek stated.137 His behaviour was not surprising. Aware that Stojadinovic’s tactics were to win sympathies among the Croats and erode the support for his party in Croatia, the Croat leader did not wish to side with the Prime Minister in his conflict with the Serbian Orthodox Church. When Stojadinovic mentioned, during their meeting in January 1937, that he intended to ratify the Concordat, M aiek replied: ‘I am not in­ terested in that issue, but can tell you in advance: if you support the Concordat, I shall oppose it’.138 Moreover, the Croat leader did not regard the Serb-Croat conflict as a religious one, and believed that religion had no place in politics. In an earlier statement, he explained that Croats were ‘a Catholic, but not a clerical nation’.139\n\nThe Bloc o f the N atio n al Agreement The Concordat crisis fed the hopes o f the opposition—in both Bel­ grade and Zagreb— that the government would fall. This led them to bury their differences and to begin negotiations on a common political programme. Macek believed that the opposition must do everything to secure Prince Paul’s support.

We have to complete this together with him. Imagine if he died. [...] What would we do? It would be a disaster for both us and you.’140 The Croat leader also wanted Paul to remain Regent beyond King Peter’s eighteenth birth­ day. The following extract from the conversation between Gavrilovic and Macek illustrates well the latter’s view o f the political situation in the country and his faith in Prince Paul: [Macek]: A young man at the age of eighteen could not run my [farm at] Kupinec, let alone...

We can and should work together with Prince Paul. I had the best possible impressions after the audience. When I returned [to Croatia], I gathered my friends, and when they asked me if there were any differences between the late King and this Prince Paul, I told them: [the King] hated Croats, [the Prince] does not hate them...That is why I cannot accept something in your [proposal],. .You say here that if all the [party] leaders agree, then we would go to the Prince and tell him: We have reached an agreement.

In early August Cvetkovic went to Zagreb to talk to the Croatian Peasant Party leaders (he met Pemar and Kosutic,144 but not Macek). Cvetkovic reported to Prince Paul that ‘men close to D r Macek have understood correcdy the recent events.

On 16 September Politika some­ what prematurely reported that an opposition agreement had already been reached.149 In fact, final discussions took place in Zagreb on 28 September.150The negotiations were slowed down by Macek’s insist­ ence that any resolution should clearly state that Serbs and Croats were two ‘individualities’, something the other parties were not so keen to emphasise. At the same time, in what appeared to be par­ allel negotiations, Subasic met Korosec, while another member o f Macek’s party, Branko Peselj, went to see Stojadinovic.151 Korosec told Subasic that the government would not grant any concessions to the Croats outside the bounds o f the Constitution, and that if anyone was offering them more, they were being unrealistic. Subasic wanted to know what Prince Paul thought o f the opposition talks, adding that Macek did not wish to lose the Crown’s confidence.

The October agreement criticised both the 1921 and 1931 Constitutions, demanded the abolition o f the latter and a return to democracy: ‘Our parties [...] represent both the Serbian people and the Croatian peo­ ple [and believe] that the moment has arrived to bring to an end once and for all the undemocratic regime and to enable the Croats, Serbs and Slovenes to run their state in mutual agreement.’153 The oppo­ sition called for elections for a constituent assembly, which would work towards a constitution acceptable to the majority o f Serbs, the majority o f Croats, and the majority o f Slovenes. Yugoslavia would remain a constitutional and parliamentary monarchy under King Peter II.154 Although the regime publicly ignored the agreement, it followed the opposition activities closely.155 The long negotiations that preceded the agreement took place mostly in Zagreb, but also on Belgrade-Zagreb trains.156 On 21 Oc­ tober 1937 the opposition leaders met to celebrate the agreement in the village o f Farkasic, near one o f the train stations not far from Zagreb.157 It was agreed at the meeting that the agreement should be 152 BAR PPP, box 2, Korosec to Prince Paul, Belgrade, 29 September 1937. 153 AJ 37/10/60, ‘Sporazum’, Zagreb-Belgrade, 8 October 1937.

Macek’s claim that Farkasic was chosen because 161\n\nELU SIVE CO M PROM ISE\n\npresented to the Serbs, especially those from Serbia, as a clear sign that the Croats recognised the common state and the dynasty. On the other hand, the Croat population would be told that this was the first act by which the Serbian leaders recognised Croats as equal partners.158 In a dinner address to the FarkaSic meeting participants, Macek said he was confident that Croats and Serbs would find a way to overcome their differences. ‘One day,’ Macek continued, ‘our chil­ dren and grandchildren will find strange our arguments and various quarrels. I am confident that we shall succeed and that our successors [...] will remember us as the men who wished them well. T o that, may God give you all long life!’159 Was Macek confident in the Serb-Croat rapprochement also because he maximised the chances for an agreement by continuing to flirt with the regime? A month after the agreement was reached, Peselj told Stojadinovic that the leadership o f his party would wait a little until the October agreement was forgotten and then continue negotiations with the Crown and government, because that was the only ‘serious and realistic’ option.160 In January 1938 Cvetkovic was told by Pemar that the Bloc o f the National Agreement had ‘definitely collapsed’, and that Macek wished to see Prince Paul to discuss the solution to the Croat question. Noting a degree o f ‘nervousness’ among the leading members o f the largest Croatian\n\nthe Serbian leaders refused to come to Zagreb is unconvincing as they visited the Croatian capital throughout the summer. Historians sometimes refer to the October 1937 agreement as the ‘Farkasic agreement’, although the agreement had already been reached by the time of the Farkasic meeting, which served mosdy to discuss further tactics as well as to celebrate the successful conclusion to the negotiations.

After several quiet months, the Serb-Croat opposition came alive again in the summer o f 1938, with Macek’s visit to Belgrade. Macek arrived in the capital on 14 August and was greeted by tens o f thou­ sands of enthusiastic Serbs. In the spirit o f the Farkasic meeting, the United Opposition portrayed Macek’s visit as final proof that the Croats were in favour o f Yugoslavia and o f cooperation with Serbs.162 The visit was to be the coronation o f the October 1937 agreement. The Serbian opposition invited people to come to the Belgrade railway station to greet ‘the Croat brothers’, and to cheer the ‘unity between Serbs and Croats’ and the ‘national agreement’.163 The visit was a success. Macek and other members o f the Zagreb delegation -Kosutic and Sutej o f the Croatian Peasant Party, and the Independent Democrats Vilder, Budisavljevic and Kosanovic—were greeted by enthusiastic crowds along the route to Belgrade.164 In the capital, tens o f thousands o f Serbs from all over Serbia turned up to cheer the Croat leader.165 They were joined by Communists once again, Milovan Djilas describing the welcome given to Macek\n\n161 BAR PPP, box 2, Cvetkovic to Prince Paul, Zagreb, 30 January 1938. 162 AJ 37/10/60, ‘Obavestenje prijateljima’, pamphlet, Belgrade, ca.

Macek was touched and encouraged by the reception: The public reception I received surpassed all expectations. The station at Belgrade was crammed with people, and along the streets, leading to my assigned quarters, a crowd of more than 100,000 had gathered to greet me. Surrounded by the different Serbian political leaders, I stepped out several times on the balcony of the house in which I was lodged to address the swaying multitude below. I stayed in Belgrade two days, and returned home full of optimism. I now believed that Serbia was ripe, if not quite yet for an equitable agreement with the Croats, at least for the definitive abolition of all dictatorship.168\n\nMacek addressed the crowd, stating that he had come to Belgrade ‘to continue the job which had started in Zagreb ten months previ­ ously’. He lamented that twenty years had been wasted in arguments. W e Croats have suffered in blood and material [cost], and you Serbs have lost your freedom,’ Macek told the crowd which broke into cheers of approval.169 He concluded the speech by expressing his con­ fidence that the ‘united Croatian and Serbian people’ would achieve mutual harmony to the satisfaction o f ‘both the Croatian people and 166 Djilas, Memoir ofa Revolutionary, 307. 167 Trijumfmisli narodnog sporazuma, 10. 168 Macek, In the Strugglefor Freedom, 182. The HSS leader was somewhat disingenuous. As it has been argued, the Serbian leaders were above all concerned with ending the dictatorship, while Macek’s main aim was to establish autonomy for Croatia, under the dictatorship if need be, as indeed happened in August 1939. 169 Trijumfmisli narodnog sporazuma, 11. 164\n\nT H E SER B-C R O A T O PPO SITIO N\n\nthe Serbian people’. He was then greeted by loud cheers o f “That’s right!’, ‘Long live!’ and ‘Long live the sporazum\\n70 After the speech Macek went inside the house, but as the crowd called on him to return, he came out again and gave another speech, expressing regret that Stojadinovic was not there to see in person the extent o f popular support for a Croat-Serb agreement. Madek told the crowd: When ten months ago leaders of the Serbian people, together with us Croats, laid the first foundations of the agreement (Loud cheers: Long live sporazuml Long live!), the government tried everything to show how the Serbian people does not want that agreement! (Loud screams: It does! It does!) What we are witnessing today here in Belgrade is proof that, if noth­ ing else, those who came here want an agreement! (Thunderous cheers of approval: That’s right! Long live agreement! Long live!) Serbian people, it is up to you, when you return to your homes, to send special regards to the Serbian peasant brothers from us Croats (Long and thunderous cheers of approval: Long live! Long live the Croats!) and to tell them: a betterfuture of both the Croatian and Serbian people lays only in an agreement (Cheers of approval).171 It would be simplistic, if tempting, to conclude that Macek was speaking as a politician seizing an opportune moment to consolidate the evident support he enjoyed among Serbs. Nor was he simply carried away by his enthusiastic reception and let the occasion get the better o f him. At a meeting o f the delegations of all five opposi­ tion parties which was held behind closed doors, in Jovan Jovanovic Pizon’s house, the Croat leader repeated his belief that a Serb-Croat agreement was the only solution to the country’s problems.172 He stated that the reception the Zagreb delegation received was a sure sign that the politics o f agreement, as formulated in October 1937, was supported by many Serbs. ‘It took time before we reached this 170 Ibid. In a single sentence Macek talked both about the ‘united Croatian and Serbian people’ in the singular, while also referring to ‘Croatian people and Serbian people’. 171 Ibid., 12.

The Serbs managed to liberate themselves from Turkish rule and to create their own small state, which they strengthened, made more inde­ pendent and slowly expanded. We Croats were part of the former Aus­ tro-Hungarian monarchy, but within it we preserved all the attributes of Croatian statehood. (Cheers: That’s right!) It is another matter that those [state attributes] were not respected, but that is why we seceded from Aus­ tria-Hungary (Loud applause and cheers: That’s right!) Look brothers, we separated from Austria-Hungary and entered the new system, the new state union ... we did not [do so] in order to have fewer rights and less freedom, but in order to gain more [rights and freedom] (That’s right!)...Instead of attempting to find a way to satisfy the ambitions of both Croatian people and Serbian people inside the common borders, it turned out that the state had to be defended by the Law for the Defence of the State. First it had to be defended from individual Communists, then from Croat individuals, then from the whole Croatian people, and now, at the end, from the whole Serbian people (Loud and long cheers: That’s right!!).174\n\nMacek also offered an explanation o f his party’s position during the 1930s. Arguing that the dictatorship could be tolerated while it was ‘open’, because everyone believed it would only be temporary,\n\n173 Ibid., 14. Emphasis added by D. Dj. 174 Ibid., 14-15. This echoed Radio’s views of distinct historical developments of Serbs and Croats and the common self-perception among the Croats as a people with a ‘thousand year-long’ statehood. Although Croatia symbolically preserved some elements of statehood under Hungarian and later Austrian rule (namely its sabor), Macek was wrong to claim that ‘all the attributes of Croatian statehood’ survived following the end of independence in 1102. 166\n\nT H E SE R B -C R O A T O PPO SITIO N\n\nhe said that everything changed in 1931, when the Constitution was imposed by the King: The main demand of the Croats, supported by representatives of the Serbian people, is the right of the people to create a constitution. The key point of our agreement is that this imposed Constitution be proclaimed invalid and that as soon as "
