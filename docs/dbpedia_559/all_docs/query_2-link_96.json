        "text": "Mark Duncan/Associated Press\n\nTo prepare for the 2015 NFL draft, Bleacher Report's draft correspondents participated in a mock draft, with the analysts playing the role of general manager for their respective team.\n\nThe community mock draft lasted through the first 100 picks, at which point all correspondents filled out the remaining picks for their team based on reasonable guesses as to who may be available in each round on Day 3 of the draft.\n\nBefore we get to the picks, I'll lay out my strategy for the draft while playing the role of the Cleveland Browns' general manager.\n\nPriority No. 1: Find a starting receiver\n\nThis felt like an absolute must, and it was a position I intended to address at all costs in the first or second round of the draft—even if it required a slight reach.\n\nDwayne Bowe is a serviceable starter, and he's supported by a stable of quality third or fourth receivers. But the team needs another strong outside receiver—ideally one with the size and speed to stretch the field.\n\nPriority No. 2: Land two immediate starters in the first round\n\nThis sounds obvious, but in a relatively weak draft class, many teams will come away with players unable to play significant roles in their rookie year.\n\nWhile the Browns have some obvious needs, which I'll address next, I wasn't willing to reach to fill a need if that player would be unable to help immediately. In other words, I planned on favoring immediate value and NFL readiness over long-term upside.\n\nPriority No. 3: Try to address the offensive and defensive line on Day 1 or 2\n\nThis wasn't an \"at all costs\" priority, but it was something I wanted to keep in mind. If given the choice between two players with similar value, I would favor the lineman.\n\nWith Mitchell Schwartz and Phil Taylor set to become free agents next offseason, I wanted to be able to find players who could conceivably step into their starting roles by the start of the 2016 season.\n\nGarry Jones/Associated Press\n\nPickTeamPlayerPositionSchool1BuccaneersJameis WinstonQBFlorida State2TitansMarcus MariotaQBOregon3JaguarsDante Fowler Jr.DEFlorida4RaidersLeonard WilliamsDTUSC5RedskinsBrandon ScherffOLIowa6JetsVic BeasleyOLBClemson7BearsAmari CooperWRAlabama8FalconsBud DupreeDEKentucky9GiantsKevin WhiteWRWest Virginia10RamsAndrus PeatOTStanford11VikingsMarcus PetersCBWashington12BrownsDeVante ParkerWRLouisville13SaintsShane RayDEMissouri14DolphinsLa'el CollinsOLLSU1549ersTrae WaynesCBMichigan State16TexansBreshad PerrimanWRUCF17ChargersDanny SheltonDTWashington18ChiefsRandy GregoryLBNebraska19BrownsTodd GurleyRBGeorgia20EaglesJake FisherOLOregon21BengalsLandon CollinsSAlabama22SteelersKevin JohnsonCBWake Forest23LionsMalcom BrownDTTexas24CardinalsCameron ErvingOCFlorida State25PanthersEreck FlowersOTMiami (Fla.)26RavensJaelen StrongWRArizona State27CowboysByron JonesCBConnecticut28BroncosT.J. Clemmings OTPittsburgh 29ColtsArik ArmsteadDE Oregon 30PackersOwamagbe OdighizuwaOLB UCLA 31SaintsEric KendricksLB UCLA 32PatriotsMelvin GordonRB Wisconsin\n\nNo. 12: DeVante Parker, WR, Louisville\n\nGiven the Browns' need for a receiver, this felt like an obvious selection at No. 12.\n\nWhile others such as Breshad Perriman and Jaelen Strong may have been available at No. 19, Parker is one of only three receivers in this class with the size (6'3\", 209 lbs) and skill set to immediately win on the outside in the NFL.\n\nSome degree of development is obviously needed, but the Browns can confidently plug Parker into a starting role and expect immediate production.\n\nWhile Dwayne Bowe offers value as a possession receiver on one side and Brian Hartline, Taylor Gabriel and Andrew Hawkins will complete for playing time in the slot, Parker would become the only receiver on the roster with both the size and speed (4.45 40-yard dash) to stretch the field consistently.\n\nNo. 19: Todd Gurley, RB, Georgia\n\nThis is an outside-the-box selection because the Browns obviously aren't entering this draft dead set on landing a running back. The duo of Terrance West and Isaiah Crowell showed some promise last season, and they'll likely be back on the field together in 2015.\n\nThat said, it's unreasonable to think the team hasn't discussed the option of selecting a talent like Gurley at No. 19.\n\nConcerns about Gurley's health have been eased since his medical recheck at the combine, putting him in a strong position to land in the upper half of the first round.\n\nWhile the Browns do have needs to address, every franchise must stay true to its board and take the best player available when he's there. Given the relatively shallow pool of legitimate first-round prospects in this class, I simply couldn't justify passing over a talent like Gurley in favor of a lesser prospect who fills a need.\n\nGene J.

WilliamsCBFlorida State63SeahawksCarl DavisDL Iowa64PatriotsTre' JacksonOG Florida State\n\nNo. 43: Donovan Smith, OL, Penn State\n\nThis is probably a pick for the future, as the Browns wouldn't hand Smith a starting job right out of the gate. They would give Smith an opportunity to compete with Mitchell Schwartz for the right tackle job, but he may have to wait until the 2016 season to take over after the Browns let Schwartz walk as a free agent.\n\nSmith is a mauler as a run-blocker, which would be an especially valuable addition if the team does add Gurley in the first round.\n\nThere are some concerns about his athleticism as a tackle, but the Browns would have the long-term option to slide him to guard in a year or two when they're forced to move on from 30-year-old John Greco.\n\nWhile Smith hasn't received the predraft attention of some of the more athletic tackles in this class, his physical, powerful style should fit nicely with the Browns offensive line.\n\nSue Ogrocki/Associated Press\n\nPickTeamPlayerPositionSchool65BuccaneersRashad GreeneWRFlorida State66TitansCedric OgbuehiOTTexas A&M67JaguarsJeremy LangfordRBMichigan State68RaidersAli MarpetOGHobart College69RedskinsDanielle HunterDELSU70JetsTre McBrideWRWilliam & Mary71BearsJaquiski TarttSSamford72RamsSammie CoatesWRAuburn\n\n73FalconsMitch Morse OGMissouri 74GiantsRob HavensteinOTWisconsin75SaintsD'Joun SmithCBFlorida Atlantic76VikingsShaq ThompsonOLBWashington 77BrownsJordan Phillips DT Oklahoma 78SaintsJohn Miller OG Louisville 7949ersDenzel Perryman ILB Miami (Fla.) 80ChiefsTyler Lockett WR Kansas State 81BillsBryce Petty QB Baylor 82TexansDoran Grant CB Ohio State 83ChargersHau'oli Kikaha OLB Washington 84EaglesQuinten Rollins CB Miami (Ohio) 85BengalsZa'Darius Smith DE Kentucky 86CardinalsDavid Cobb RB Minnesota 87SteelersJeff Heuerman TE Ohio State 88LionsJosh Shaw CB USC 89PanthersMichael Bennett DT Ohio State 90RavensDerron Smith SS Fresno State 91CowboysTrey Flowers DE Arkansas 92BroncosHenry AndersonDEStanford 93ColtsMike Davis RB South Carolina 94PackersBrett Hundley QB UCLA 95SeahawksAlex Carter CB Stanford 96PatriotsKenny Bell WR Nebraska 97PatriotsIfo Ekpre-Olomu CB Oregon 98ChiefsSenquez Golson CB Ole Miss 99BengalsSteven Nelson CB Oregon State *100TitansNick O'Leary TE Florida State\n\n*First pick of Round 4.\n\nNo. 77: Jordan Phillips, DT, Oklahoma\n\nMy third-round strategy was to take the best available player, but the defensive line remained a position I had hoped to target. Fortunately, Phillips fell, which allowed me to address a need while still landing one of the best overall players on the board.\n\nPhillips' best asset is his size (6'5\", 329 lbs), and it's why he's been discussed as a possible first-round target for some teams. Unfortunately, it may be his only meaningful asset, which led to his slide in this mock draft.\n\nFor the Browns, Phillips is worth the third-round selection even if he does have some limitations. There remain concerns about Phil Taylor's health, as he battled knee injuries throughout the 2014 season, and Phillips would provide some immediate depth at nose tackle.\n\nAdditionally, Taylor is set to hit the free-agent market after this season, giving the Browns a year to test Phillips out and determine if he has a future as a starter. If yes, they can use an early-round pick in 2016 to address other issues. If no, they can simply keep Phillips around as a low-cost backup.\n\nAndy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nNo. 111: Lorenzo Mauldin, LB, Louisville\n\nMauldin was a consistent playmaker at Louisville and one of the most productive pass-rushers in the nation in 2014. However, concerns about his athleticism could lead to a draft-day slide as it did in our community mock draft.\n\nThe Browns have reason to feel confident in Barkevious Mingo and Paul Kruger at outside linebacker, but the depth is lacking. Entering the draft, Scott Solomon is their only backup outside linebacker who saw playing time at the position a season ago.\n\nEven if Mauldin's athleticism limits his ability to ever win a starting role, he brings a valuable skill set to the table as a situational pass-rusher.\n\nNo. 115: Ben Heeney, LB, Kansas\n\nInside linebacker was another position I hoped to target in this draft. However, I went into the draft understanding that with limited options it was likely the need would be pushed until Day 3.\n\nHeeney is undersized at just 6'0\" and 231 pounds, but given the Browns' interest in Christian Kirksey and Craig Robertson in recent years, they're likely to overlook size limitations.\n\nRobertson is likely to enter the season as the starter next Karlos Dansby, but Heeney would provide some added competition and depth.\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nNo. 147: Darren Waller, WR, Georgia Tech\n\nTo hit home runs late in the draft you have to take some risks.\n\nWaller was suspended multiple times in college for violations of team rules and had only 51 career receptions at Georgia Tech. He's been a late bloomer, and the off-field questions certainly don't make you any more confident in his ability to put it together at the next level.\n\nThat said, there's very little risk involved in selecting him in the fifth round, and there are only so many prospects in every class who bring his size to the table (6'6\", 238 lbs).\n\nCleveland should set rookie-year expectations extremely low for Waller, but the upside makes him well worth the late-round gamble.\n\nChristopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNo. 229: Kyle Brindza, K, Notre Dame\n\nBy the time the Browns reach their 10th pick of the draft, it's tough to find a position where a prospect even has a chance of sneaking onto the 53-man roster.\n\nWith Garrett Hartley and Casey Spear as the only kickers on the roster, the Browns might as well spend one of their late picks to ensure they land one of the top kickers in this class.\n\nBrindza had some struggles in 2014 (just 14-of-24 on field-goal attempts). But he's shown a strong leg on kickoffs with a 64 percent touchback rate as senior, and he's drilled four of six career attempts from beyond 50 yards.\n\nAdditionally, having played at Notre Dame, he has experience kicking in the elements, which may interest the Browns."
