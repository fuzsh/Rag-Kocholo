        "text": "While it seems rather conceited and self serving to re-share a video of one‚Äôs own self, in this particular instance I feel it was important to do so: simply for spreading the word of this laudable initiative by Pakistan Advertisers Society to celebrate rising talent , under-30, future-superstars from our marketing and creative fraternity. We may endlessly debate about Great leaders being born or made, but it‚Äôs imperative that as seniors who mentor, inspire and provide leadership, we inculcate and celebrate the importance of following our heart (our values, passions) our gut (our courage, intuition, integrity) and not just skating along on our analytical, thinking and ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù creative achievements. (Now THAT is a shameless plug for the benefits and advantages of the mBit (multi-braining) way of being.) It is important for all agencies and marketers, small or big, to open up about their HR Talent, and acknowledge and celebrate potential-greatness, without the fear of poaching (which will happen regardless!!). Our industry has a very cynical viewpoint towards awards and laurels; and while that POV may be ok for a cynic, it sure isn‚Äôt good for the future health of advertising and marketing in the country.\n\nDuring this weekend‚Äôs Western Atrial Fibrillation Symposium, Dr. Roderick Tung presented a topic that sparked significant interest and discussion. The central question of his presentation revolved around the necessity of atrial leads in ICD patients who do not have an indication for atrial pacing. This inquiry challenges current practices and opens the door to potentially groundbreaking methodologies in the detection and treatment of atrial high rate episodes. Dr. Tung‚Äôs exploration into this subject is particularly intriguing for its implications on patient care and treatment outcomes. These ongoing discussions highlights an ongoing shift towards more patient-specific approaches in cardiac rhythm management, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing less invasive procedures whenever possible without sacrificing the efficacy of SVT discrimination and identifying AF. This approach not only aligns with the broader goals of modern medicine but also specifically addresses the concerns related to hardware complications, extractions, and the overall patient experience. Significantly, the MATRIX study provides solid evidence supporting the efficacy of the DX system in detecting atrial high-rate episodes without the need for additional atrial leads. This pivotal research underscores the potential of such innovative systems to revolutionize the way we monitor and manage atrial fibrillation, paving the way for treatments that are both less invasive and highly effective. Thank you Dr. Roderick Tung for your enlightening presentation and invaluable insights shared at the Western Atrial Fibrillation Symposium! #CardiacRhythmManagement #AtrialFibrillation #InnovationInHealthcare #PatientCare #ICD #MATRIXStudy\n\nWhat do you do when you are able to combine your hobby with your work?
