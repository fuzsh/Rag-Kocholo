TOPOLSKI: Your Honours, forgive me, before the witness\n\n4 responds. We have a witness from our client that he could not understand\n\n5 the last translation, or generally, since this afternoon's proceedings\n\n6 commenced. I don't know what is quite meant by that, whether he can't\n\n7 hear properly or whether the words that are being spoken are indistinct.\n\n8 Maybe I could have instructions taken about that. I'm so sorry to\n\n9 interrupt.\n\n10 JUDGE PARKER: No. It's very important this be resolved.\n\n11 MR. TOPOLSKI: Yes. The difficulty in comprehension seems to be\n\n12 in the Albanian that is being spoken by the gentleman translator, is the\n\n13 message I am receiving.\n\n14 THE INTERPRETER: We will try to change places.\n\n15 JUDGE PARKER: [Previous translation continues]...\n\n16 MR. TOPOLSKI: That's the only place from which any comment has\n\n17 come. Perhaps what we should do, if Your Honour pleases, is to proceed\n\n18 and see if the difficulty repeats itself with Mr. Musliu or with anybody\n\n19 else.\n\n20 JUDGE PARKER: Yes, thank you.\n\n21 MR. TOPOLSKI: I'm sorry. I can't be more specific. That's\n\n22 simply what I have been told.\n\n23 MR. WHITING:\n\n24 Q. I believe you were able to read the highlighted portion on 6277.\n\n25 A. Yes. \"Comments of training officer: Musliu was highly motivated\n\nPage 543\n\n1 and enthusiastic about training throughout in-service training. His\n\n2 strong participation in all classes helped contribute to a positive\n\n3 learning environment. Musliu is in peak physical fitness and is a role\n\n4 model for other KPS. He has natural leadership abilities and would best\n\n5 serve the KPS in a supervisory capacity. Musliu should immediately be\n\n6 selected for promotion to sergeant. Anything less is a waste of talent\n\n7 and ability.\"\n\n8 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I would ask that this document be\n\n9 given a number, please.\n\n10 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P31.\n\n11 MR.

There was an interview with Mr. Musliu on 24th of May, 2001.\n\n20 Q. And did that predate the involvement of the ICTY in the\n\n21 investigation?\n\n22 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n23 Q. So who conducted the interview?\n\n24 A. This interview was conducted by an investigator with the\n\n25 so-called CCIU in the UNMIK police in Pristina.\n\nPage 544\n\n1 Q. Could you tell the Court, please, what CCIU stands for.\n\n2 A. CCIU sign language an abbreviation for Central Criminal\n\n3 Investigations Unit.\n\n4 Q. And they are a part of UNMIK, which is the civilian\n\n5 administration in Kosovo?\n\n6 A. That's correct.\n\n7 Q.

I would ask you please to read the section that's highlighted on\n\n14 the screen.\n\n15 MR. WHITING: And if Mr. Younis could blow it up, please.\n\n16 A. \"On March 1998 I came back from Germany, where I had been a\n\n17 refugee. The same month I started to serve as a UCK soldier in Drenica\n\n18 valley. I served as a soldier for about six weeks and then became a team\n\n19 leader in Lapusnik area. In my team I had in the beginning 11 soldiers\n\n20 and at the most 15 to 16 members. In August 1998 became a deputy\n\n21 commander of UCK Brigade 121 in Narradin [sic] fighting area. Narradin\n\n22 fighting area included the municipalities of Lipjan, Shtime, Ferizaj, and\n\n23 Kachanik. Then in December 1998 I became the commander of the UCK\n\n24 military police in the Narradin area. I had this position until KFOR\n\n25 entered Kosovo, June 1999.\n\nPage 545\n\n1 Q. According to the record of the interview, was Mr. Musliu asked\n\n2 about a series of persons who had been abducted?\n\n3 A. That's correct.\n\n4 Q. If you could just read through the names there of the persons who\n\n5 he was asked about.\n\n6 A. It's Ademi, Agim; Vesiqi, Rahim; Xhemshiti, Lutfi; Berbatovci,\n\n7 Ismail; Hoxha, Hasan.\n\n8 Q. And on the following page.\n\n9 A. It's Ahmeti, Vesel; Bajrami, Imri; Zymeri, Shyqyri; Rexhaj,\n\n10 Hetem.\n\n11 Q. Is it fair to say that with respect to all the persons, he said\n\n12 he knew nothing about their disappearance?\n\n13 A. That's correct.\n\n14 Q. With respect to the last person, Mr. Hetem Rexhaj, he provided\n\n15 additional information. What did he say?\n\n16 A. I'll read again from the screen. He said, \"I knew this person\n\n17 from before the war but I don't know anything about his disappearance.\"\n\n18 Q. Subsequently he was asked some questions about Lapusnik. Could\n\n19 you read the two questions and answers which follow on the record of the\n\n20 interview.\n\n21 A. Yes. The first question is: \"The summer 1998 you was a team\n\n22 leader in the Lapusnik area. Do you know anything about a house/outhouse\n\n23 used as a prison in this area?\"\n\n24 And the answer is: \"Lapusnik fighting area was divided in 3 to 4\n\n25 parts. I was serving in one of them. In my area, there were no prisons\n\nPage 546\n\n1 and I have not heard about any prisons.\"\n\n2 The second question: \"A prison in Lapusnik area had a commander\n\n3 called Haradin Balay [sic], nicknamed Shala. Another soldier in this\n\n4 prison was Agim Murtezi nicknamed Murizzi. A witness also stated that\n\n5 you visited this prison every 3 to 4 days?\"\n\n6 The answer is: \"I had two persons in my team with the nickname\n\n7 Shala. I don't know if any of them was Haradin Bala. Agim Murtezi or\n\n8 Murizzi I have never heard about. I have never visited any prison in the\n\n9 Lapusnik area.\"\n\n10 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, could this exhibit be given a number,\n\n11 please.\n\n12 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P32.\n\n13 MR. WHITING:\n\n14 Q. Turning now to tab 27, which is 03231639 to 1641. Was Mr. Musliu\n\n15 also interviewed in connection with another investigation that day?\n\n16 A. That's correct.\n\n17 Q. And is this the record of the interview?\n\n18 A. This appearance to be the record of the interview. I have not\n\n19 spoken to this investigator.\n\n20 Q. Now, with respect to this interview and the preceding interview,\n\n21 does the Albanian version of the record of the interview contain Mr.\n\n22 Musliu's signature?\n\n23 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n24 Q. And how do you know it is his signature?\n\n25 A. I have compared the signature of these statements with the\n\nPage 547\n\n1 signatures in Mr. Musliu's personal file, and they appear to be the same.\n\n2 Q. Now, with respect to this second interview conducted on the same\n\n3 day, I would ask if you could to read the highlighted portion on the\n\n4 first page.\n\n5 A. \"Before March 1998 I was a refugee in Germany. In March 1998 I\n\n6 came back to Kosovo and was a KLA soldier for roughly 4 to 6 weeks only.\n\n7 Then I was a team leader of a fighting KLA group for approximately 3 or 3\n\n8 and a half months in the area of Lapusnik until summer 1998.\n\n9 \"Then I became deputy commander of KLA Brigade 121. After that I\n\n10 changed to the KLA military police, I think in December 1998.\"\n\n11 Q. If you could turn to the next page and read the highlighted\n\n12 portion on that page, please.\n\n13 A. \"It is possible that some persons/KLA members have been arrested\n\n14 during the war because of cooperating with the Serbs. But these people\n\n15 were not arrested like real prisoners as far as I know.\n\n16 \"They have been kept I would say. We had no KLA prisons or\n\n17 detention centres. I know nothing about that. In that time we even had\n\n18 good contact to the people working for the OSCE. These people came\n\n19 sometimes to look after the arrested/kept people.\n\n20 \"During war I had nothing to do with arrested people. I gave no\n\n21 orders concerning that. In the first part of the war, it was my job to\n\n22 fight against the enemy and at the front line. And as the leader of the\n\n23 military police in the Nerodimlje area, I also had nothing to do with\n\n24 arresting people. In my area, we had no prisons or something like that.\n\n25 \"I can tell you that I really know nothing about missing persons.\n\nPage 548\n\n1 Perhaps these missing people cooperated with the Serbs in former times.\n\n2 I don't know.\n\n3 \"We all know also what is blood revenge is. That can also be a\n\n4 motivation for people calling my name in some cases or telling lies about\n\n5 me. I gave no orders to kidnap or kill anybody. Some people are\n\n6 misusing my name. They are telling lies about my person. A lot of\n\n7 people even don't know my real name. A lot of people know my nickname.\n\n8 A lot of people in Kosovo know my nickname. That is sure.\"\n\n9 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I would ask that this be given a\n\n10 number.\n\n11 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P33.\n\n12 MR. WHITING: Your Honours, I also just noticed on my screen that\n\n13 the -- if it's set to computer evidence as opposed to video evidence the\n\n14 documents are much clearer. I don't know if that's been a problem for\n\n15 others.\n\n16 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you very much for that.\n\n17 MR. WHITING:\n\n18 Q. Turning now to the video marked V0004095 and the corresponding\n\n19 transcript, which is at tab 28.\n\n20 MR. WHITING: And Your Honours, I would ask that the video be\n\n21 given a number and then the transcript be given a separate number.\n\n22 JUDGE PARKER: Very well.\n\n23 THE REGISTRAR: Mr. Whiting, the video will be Exhibit P34 and\n\n24 the transcript thereof will be P34.1.\n\n25 MR. WHITING: Thank you.\n\nPage 549\n\n1 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, how was this documentary obtained?\n\n2 A.

When does it appear to have been made?\n\n6 A. From the contents of the video, it seems to have been made after\n\n7 the war.\n\n8 Q. What is the documentary about?\n\n9 A. This is about the KLA forming itself in the area of Klecka and\n\n10 the Berisa mountains. And it centres around a person, a martyr, called\n\n11 Sadik Shala and his experiences with the KLA.\n\n12 Q. And what time period is covered by the documentary?\n\n13 A. It's mostly the spring and the first part of summer of 1998.\n\n14 Q. And Sadik Shala, when was he killed?\n\n15 A. Sadik Shala died around the 20th of July, 1998.\n\n16 Q. Who are some of the people who appear in the video or who are\n\n17 mentioned?\n\n18 A. There's interviews with former KLA soldiers. Mr. Fatmir Limaj is\n\n19 interviewed. Haxhi Shala, Mr. Shukri Buja and then members of the family\n\n20 of the martyr Sadik Shala.\n\n21 MR. WHITING: Your Honours, I'm going to show a series of clips\n\n22 and have each one introduced by Mr. Lehtinen. The transcript of the\n\n23 clips will be synchronised with the video that's shown.

And again, Your Honour, I would ask that\n\n22 both be numbered.\n\n23 THE REGISTRAR: The video will be exhibit -- Prosecution Exhibit\n\n24 P35 and the corresponding transcript P35.1.\n\n25 MR. WHITING:\n\nPage 556\n\n1 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, this is a documentary. When was it made?\n\n2 A. This documentary about Fatmir Limaj seems to have been made after\n\n3 his arrest by the ICTY.\n\n4 Q. How was it obtained?\n\n5 A. I'm not quite sure how this was obtained, but it was shown on\n\n6 local TV in Kosovo after the arrest of Mr. Limaj.\n\n7 MR. WHITING: I'm going to show two clips from this video. The\n\n8 first clip begins on page 1 and runs for two pages.\n\n9 Q. Could you introduce this clip, please.\n\n10 A. Yes. In this first clip Fatmir Limaj is described as a person\n\n11 and is the commander of the 121st Brigade and a member of the General\n\n12 Staff. There's footage of -- again of the same oath ceremony that we saw\n\n13 earlier. And later there's footage from a meeting between KLA soldiers\n\n14 and representatives, diplomats of the United States and Europe in a place\n\n15 called Dragobilje.\n\n16 Q. Now, in the previous documentary when the oath ceremony was shown\n\n17 there was a date -- it said June 1998, on the screen. When this -- when\n\n18 the same oath ceremony is shown in this video, is the date included on\n\n19 the screen?\n\n20 A. There's no date on this footage.\n\n21 MR. WHITING: Could we see this clip, please.\n\n22 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] Fatmir Limaj, known as Commander\n\n23 Celiku, is one of the central figures of the KLA who led the armed\n\n24 resistance of the people of Kosova against the militarist regime of\n\n25 Belgrade. He was born on the 4th of February, 1971, in Banje near\n\nPage 557\n\n1 Malisheva. He is a law graduate and did his postgraduate studies in\n\n2 international relations at the Law Faculty of Pristina University.\n\n3 During the war for the liberation of Kosova from the Serb occupation\n\n4 forces, Fatmir Limaj was commander of the 121st Brigade and member of the\n\n5 General Staff of the KLA. Let us go on to watch some documentary film\n\n6 that shows Fatmir Limaj at the same time as a fighter for freedom and a\n\n7 fighter for peace.\n\n8 As a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n\n9 Soldiers: As a member of the KLA.\n\n10 I swear that I will always be a loyal soldier, a worthy fighter\n\n11 for freedom, vigilant, courageous and disciplined, ready at any time, not\n\n12 sparing my own life, to fight, to defend the sacred interests of the\n\n13 homeland.\n\n14 This is how Fatmir Limaj explained the decision of the SVA to the\n\n15 KLA to base itself in the mountains of Berisha, that is in Klecka, and\n\n16 Divjake.\n\n17 ... considering the terrain and the local population, the SHP,\n\n18 the General Staffof the KLA decided that Klecka would -- too would become\n\n19 one of its important bases. Our national movement.... as it is well\n\n20 known... these mountains have been famous in the past, and national\n\n21 movements for the liberation of Kosova have sent people to this area at\n\n22 different times and they have found shelter and powerful support from the\n\n23 local population. In the eighties too, these mountains were in one way\n\n24 or another a strength and stay for the underground movements of\n\n25 distinguished activists, most of whom has now been killed. For instance,\n\nPage 558\n\n1 the mountains for Berisha whilst the home of Afrim Zhitia and Fadil Varta\n\n2 and others. In short, there is a continuity to these mountains, which\n\n3 have always sheltered those who have worked and taken action for the\n\n4 freedom of Kosova. So, of course we had a safe place here, we knew that\n\n5 the population would support us, and in practice it was not hard for the\n\n6 KLA to establish itself here and to create one of its most powerful\n\n7 bases.\n\n8 Fatmir Limaj was always with the political representatives of the\n\n9 KLA in talks that were held with representatives of the United Stated and\n\n10 European diplomacy. One must single out especially the meetings that\n\n11 took place at Dragobil near Malisheva.\n\n12 MR. WHITING: Could you pause it here.\n\n13 Q. There's a date that appears on this portion of the clip. Do you\n\n14 know -- it's in Albanian, but do you know what that date is?\n\n15 A. Yes. That's the 6th of November, 1998.\n\n16 Q. And who is that person who i son the screen at the moment?\n\n17 A. That is Mr. Hashim Thaqi.\n\n18 MR. WHITING: Thank you. Could you finish.\n\n19 [Videotape played]\n\n20 MR. WHITING: The second clip -- this transcript unfortunately\n\n21 doesn't -- the pages are not numbered. So it's three, four, five -- page\n\n22 eight, counting in to page 8. The top of the page is \"FL: When the\n\n23 international community.\"\n\n24 Q. Could you introduce this brief clip, please. The Court has\n\n25 already seen it. So could you introduce it.\n\nPage 559\n\n1 A. This is Fatmir Limaj speaking to the soldiers. It's dated May\n\n2 1999 and he talks about being a fanatic for order and discipline.\n\n3 MR. WHITING: Could we see this clip, please.\n\n4 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] You know that in all the armies of\n\n5 the world, and in our liberation army too, order and discipline are an\n\n6 essential condition for our success. Just to tell you in brief, I inform\n\n7 you that I am a fanatic for order and discipline, and I will not permit\n\n8 any soldier or officer to violate the KLA's order and discipline.\n\n9 Self-denial, struggle, and morale are conditions for the success of a KLA\n\n10 freedom fighter. I am convinced that it is the blood of our sons, the\n\n11 blood of our youngest, most dedicated, and finest sons that brought this\n\n12 success. Nobody else brought it to us. It was the struggle of the KLA\n\n13 that brought the Albanian people to the international position they are\n\n14 in.\n\n15 MR. WHITING: Thank you.\n\n16 Q. Turning now to the next document after tab 30. And this is\n\n17 another documentary video, V0002527. Again, I would ask that the video\n\n18 and the corresponding transcript which is here be given numbers.\n\n19 THE REGISTRAR: The video will be Prosecution Exhibit P36 and the\n\n20 corresponding transcript P36.1.\n\n21 MR. WHITING:\n\n22 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, what is this documentary, or rather what is this\n\n23 video?\n\n24 A. This is a television interview with Mr. Fatmir Limaj. It's done\n\n25 by the United Kingdom's Channel 4 News.\n\nPage 560\n\n1 Q. And do you know when the interview was done?\n\n2 A. I'm not sure. It's clearly after the war, and the tape with the\n\n3 interview is dated on the 18th of August, 2000.\n\n4 Q. The first clip that I'm going to show is on page 1. Could you\n\n5 introduce that clip, please, to the Court.\n\n6 A. Yes. Mr. Limaj is asked about why the Kosovars began their armed\n\n7 uprising, and Mr. Limaj explains that this was a result of the failed\n\n8 policy -- politics of Mr. Ibrahim Rugova and that they thought the only\n\n9 way to work it -- to work for a decision of the Albanians in Kosovo is an\n\n10 armed uprising.\n\n11 Q. Who is Mr. Rugova?\n\n12 A. Ibrahim Rugova is the leader of the LDK party, which is the\n\n13 Democratic League of Kosovo.\n\n14 Q. And was he in that position during the war?\n\n15 A. Yes.\n\n16 MR. WHITING: Can we see this clip, please.\n\n17 [Videotape played]\n\n18 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] why did the Kosovars start an armed\n\n19 uprising?\n\n20 The Kosovars started an armed uprising after losing all their\n\n21 hopes. In that -- our way of achieving our national goal had failed. In\n\n22 particular, the so-called peaceful pacifists road under the leadership of\n\n23 Rugova failed. And the Albanians were finally persuaded that to achieve\n\n24 their national interests, they had to shift to armed resistance, as other\n\n25 people had done. There was a widespread view among the people, whereas\n\nPage 561\n\n1 some people had already started preparations for the armed resistance\n\n2 that would later be identified with the Kosovo Liberation Army. It was\n\n3 clear to them that our national interests could only be realised through\n\n4 armed resistance. After all other options had been exhausted, after the\n\n5 constant occupation and the incessant repression of the Serb -- Serbian\n\n6 regime. Even though the Albanians behaved in a civilised manner and\n\n7 asked for and articulated their demands in a peaceful way and had given\n\n8 up the street protests that had previously been one of the main ways in\n\n9 which our people had demonstrated their discontent. They had sacrifices,\n\n10 that is these gave up even those popular protests and took to office\n\n11 work, conferences, resolutions, protests. How shall I put it? By\n\n12 organising a sort of literary discussions, expressing their opposition to\n\n13 violence. Nevertheless, the Serb state responded in the harshest way to\n\n14 this behaviour of the Albanian people and the political class. Seeing\n\n15 that there was no other way and there was no talking with the Milosevic\n\n16 regime and seeing this manner of realising our national interests could\n\n17 absolutely not get through in the case of Milosevic, they moved to the\n\n18 armed resistance, which I have said before, as been identified with the\n\n19 KLA.\n\n20 MR. WHITING: The next clip is on page 2 of the transcript.\n\n21 Q. Could you introduce that, please.\n\n22 A. Yeah. The interview continues on the same topic. And Mr. Limaj\n\n23 describes the years from 1993 to 1996 as being the period when people who\n\n24 were against the politics of Rugova emerged and started to form what\n\n25 would become the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n\nPage 562\n\n1 MR. WHITING: Could we see this clip, please.\n\n2 [Videotape played]\n\n3 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] It was precisely seeing that, as I\n\n4 said earlier, all the other options and that the people were in a way fed\n\n5 up with these kinds of resistance and that a kind of mood had arisen\n\n6 among Albanian youth to look for other kinds of action. This was first\n\n7 expressed among some political parties, organisations, and you could see\n\n8 that people in Kosovo were thinking of other alternatives, that is in a\n\n9 word in 1996 and especially from 1993 to 1996, those who did not support\n\n10 Rugova's peaceful road, that is in that simple sense began to make\n\n11 themselves felt. So this sense some people were prepared to take this\n\n12 path, that is an alternative to the peaceful road and created the KLA. I\n\n13 think that in this aspect, how shall I put it, there were three main\n\n14 aspects to the conditions for the creation of the KLA. First, the\n\n15 Albanians of Kosovo had all the conditions with the economic potential to\n\n16 wage a war. Secondly, they had the political potential to justify that\n\n17 war. And thirdly, they had the strength, the sufficient physique --\n\n18 physical strength to wage the war. I am talking specifically here. And\n\n19 we know that there was a great part of the young people are young and\n\n20 always ready at any time to make sacrifices. They are always ready and\n\n21 their strength only needs to be mobilised.\n\n22 MR. WHITING: The third clip is on page 5.\n\n23 Q. Could you introduce that clip, please.\n\n24 A. Yes. In this part Mr. Limaj is asked about his personal role as\n\n25 a KLA member, and he describes himself as part of the leadership of KLA.\n\nPage 563\n\n1 Q. Could we see this clip, please.\n\n2 [Videotape played]\n\n3 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] How did you assess your personal\n\n4 role as a member of the KLA?\n\n5 I think that my role, like that of all other members of the KLA,\n\n6 was to use all our intellectual and physical resources and to be ready to\n\n7 sacrifice ourselves for the great cause. I think that it was what every\n\n8 Albanian in this country had to be ready to do.\n\n9 Considering the group of young men they took up, you, Hashim ^ ,\n\n10 and the others, how do you assess the role of this section of the KLA\n\n11 leadership? What role did they really have?\n\n12 I think that these people had a two-fold role, both waging the\n\n13 war and justifying the war -- or rather, carrying out the politics of the\n\n14 war and taking direct part in the war and in extending and organising the\n\n15 KLA.\n\n16 Am I right in saying that this group of people were in fact the\n\n17 real leadership of the KLA from the beginning?\n\n18 Of course, of course.\n\n19 Can you say all of them?\n\n20 This entire group in the beginning down to the present day has\n\n21 been the real leadership of the KLA. And indeed at the time it was a\n\n22 two-fold leadership. Now it is a political leadership, but then afs also\n\n23 military leadership that worked on and prepared the strategy of military\n\n24 action and with all the resources it possessed. It extended in the\n\n25 organisational sense. The units of the KLA throughout Kosovo. It was\n\nPage 564\n\n1 involved in border crossings, supplies, caring for our comrades'\n\n2 families, everything. So it was this group.\n\n3 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I note the time. I don't believe I'll\n\n4 be able to finish this exhibit. It will take another five or ten\n\n5 minutes. Perhaps --\n\n6 JUDGE PARKER: Very well. Thank you, Mr. Whiting. We will\n\n7 adjourn now until 4.00.\n\n8 --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\n\n9 --- On resuming at 4.04 p.m.\n\n10 JUDGE PARKER: Mr. Whiting, I was not yet --\n\n11 MR. WHITING: Yes, I can say something?\n\n12 JUDGE PARKER: Yes, Mr. Whiting.\n\n13 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, before I proceed Mr. Cayley had to\n\n14 step out to attend to a matter. He asked to be excused.\n\n15 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, we were going through this documentary and we're\n\n16 going to move to the next clip which starts on page 6 of the transcript,\n\n17 and again, this is at tab 30. Could you please introduce this next clip.\n\n18 A. Yes. In this part of the interview, Mr. Limaj is asked to\n\n19 describe some incidents. He describes one in the year of 1996 when there\n\n20 was a lot of secrecy around the KLA. And then he proceeds to describe an\n\n21 incident on the 26th of November, 1997, in Ljudevic which is important\n\n22 date and incident for the KLA. And Mr. Limaj also said that at the time\n\n23 of the incident in Ljudevic he was abroad himself taking care -- he was\n\n24 actually in Switzerland taking care of duties that he had been tasked\n\n25 with by the General Staff.\n\nPage 565\n\n1 MR. WHITING: Could we see this next clip, please.\n\n2 [Videotape played]\n\n3 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] Right. As I recall on certain\n\n4 occasions in your interviews and at certain meetings that we had it was\n\n5 described in an anecdotal form by you, the way in which you first started\n\n6 with patrols; the way people did not trust you or them. Can you explain\n\n7 at least one interesting aspect of how you explained the start and --\n\n8 It's interesting. Sometime around 1996 we were going to go out\n\n9 to carry out an operation. That was our duty. And I was waiting for the\n\n10 now -- the present ministry of public order, Rexhep Selimi, to come. And\n\n11 we had set the time. And there was a barber there, a neighbour of mine\n\n12 there in the village and I was waiting for him to come because that was\n\n13 our meeting place.\n\n14 From the conversation that was going on in the barbershop -- the\n\n15 talk was about the KLA that at that time was still not talked about much\n\n16 -- they started to discuss among themselves: how many Serbs there were,\n\n17 how many men of Seselj and how many of Arkan and who was behind them and\n\n18 what was going on; whether the Serbs were killing each other for various\n\n19 reasons, for certain purposes; and who knows. It was a wide-ranging\n\n20 discussion in this case. In the course of this, somebody asked me a\n\n21 direct question about the question, more because I had stayed a lot in\n\n22 Pristina and maybe I knew more than he did. Then the nature of our\n\n23 operations was known [as interpreted], it very secret and it was very\n\n24 difficult. To say that it was ours, there were times when that didn't\n\n25 work. I found and I found an [inaudible]. I said, Listen, if the Serbs\n\nPage 566\n\n1 have been inventing us, it is to our good. If it is the Serbs who are in\n\n2 fact doing this, we must support it because they're damaging themselves\n\n3 by doing it. Yes, because they're damaging themselves by doing it. That\n\n4 is very true.\n\n5 On the 26th of November, 1997, was perhaps the first time that an\n\n6 organised KLA was launched.\n\n7 What do you think of the case of Mitrovica?\n\n8 In fact, the condition for all the success of all the KLA, or\n\n9 rather, the military leadership throughout the war, was that it was able\n\n10 at certain moments and at the right time to move from one phase of action\n\n11 to another. At the most suitable moments it moved from one phase to the\n\n12 next. The case of Ljudevic is connected to this. Until then, the KLA\n\n13 had made a deep secret of its operations. But it took a difficult step\n\n14 that it would have been hard for any other organisation to do, moving\n\n15 from what you might call an underground conspiracy and war. This was\n\n16 indeed a step that was as brave as it was dangerous.\n\n17 How do you remember Ljudevic?\n\n18 I wasn't present at Ljudevic because I was abroad at the time. I\n\n19 was in Switzerland at the time on other duties assigned by the General\n\n20 Staff, but ...\n\n21 MR. WHITING: The next clip begins on page 9 of the transcript.\n\n22 Q. Can you introduce this clip, please.\n\n23 A. Yes. Here Mr. Limaj is asked a comment by a person called\n\n24 Gelbard who has called KLA a terrorist group. Mr. Limaj is commenting on\n\n25 this and saying KLA has nothing in common with known terrorist groups\n\nPage 567\n\n1 such as the ETA or IRA.\n\n2 Q. And who is this Mr. Gelbard?\n\n3 A. He is Robert Gelbard who was a United States special envoy to the\n\n4 Balkans during the war.\n\n5 [Videotape played]\n\n6 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] Did Gelbard call you terrorists at\n\n7 first?\n\n8 Yes.\n\n9 How far to what extent did this damage you ... how far did you\n\n10 feel branded by this?\n\n11 In fact, Gelbard's statement was tough and difficult for us at\n\n12 the time. But nevertheless, we started from the fact that Gelbard did\n\n13 not have adequate information about the KLA and did not know what the KLA\n\n14 strategy and policy. So in this way this motivated us to become more\n\n15 visible in our operations faster than to --\n\n16 MR. KHAN: I apologise for the interruption.\n\n17 JUDGE PARKER: That's fine.\n\n18 MR. KHAN: Your Honours, there seems to be discrepancy which Your\n\n19 Honours perhaps have noticed between the translation which appears on the\n\n20 videocassette and the translation that is going to be exhibited by the\n\n21 Prosecution. It's not clear to me which translation is being relied\n\n22 upon, and perhaps we can have some clarification in relation to that.\n\n23 Should we be seeking to follow the transcript on the video or the\n\n24 transcript on hard copy? Because there is a difference in several\n\n25 places. I'm sorry once again for interrupting.\n\nPage 568\n\n1 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I've noticed that as well. And I\n\n2 believe what has happened here -- I don't believe there are any\n\n3 substantive differences, but what I think happened was when the video was\n\n4 prepared there was certain modifications or changes made to the\n\n5 transcript. And what I -- it was revised, is the word I'm looking for.\n\n6 What I would propose is that we rely on the changes that appear\n\n7 in the -- on the tape, and we will correct the transcript that we have\n\n8 put into evidence and offer that and serve it, of course, on the Defence.\n\n9 If there are any material differences or problems with the translation,\n\n10 we can take that up at that time.\n\n11 JUDGE PARKER: I'm not sure that I understand what you're\n\n12 proposing. What I have detected is not unusual in translation from one\n\n13 language to another: different phraseology expressing essentially the\n\n14 same sort of subject. Now, just occasionally there is a word or two\n\n15 materially different. But so far I have been noting the different word\n\n16 above the word that is here in the written transcript, so I have both.\n\n17 But generally the main sense seems to be there.\n\n18 I have at this stage no idea what use might be made of these\n\n19 words and whether precise words are going to be material. If they are,\n\n20 we're going to have to get an authorised version so that everybody knows\n\n21 where they stand. But if I'm really without knowledge as to how\n\n22 important the words actually used here will be in the ultimate working\n\n23 out of the evidence in this case. And I certainly wouldn't want to\n\n24 suggest that everything that's here should now be, as it were, put\n\n25 through into an authorised version, just so that there can be a casual\n\nPage 569\n\n1 reference to it in somebody's closing.\n\n2 So perhaps you might with Mr. Kahn and the other counsel look at\n\n3 the question and see whether what is now happening can by and large be\n\n4 left as it is. All of us are aware that there are variations in the\n\n5 phraseology, essentially, of what's being translated. If that will be\n\n6 satisfactory for the ultimate purposes that each of you foresee, we can\n\n7 leave it at that. But if from your discussions it emerges that a need\n\n8 for an assured translation is felt, then of course we would have to ask\n\n9 that that be arranged, Mr. Whiting.\n\n10 MR. WHITING: That's fine, Your Honour. If that's agreeable to\n\n11 the Defence, I will take it upon myself to produce the two different\n\n12 versions and arrange to discuss it with the Defence, and perhaps if there\n\n13 are no issues we can leave it as it is.\n\n14 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you for raising that, Mr. Kahn. Is that\n\n15 satisfactory for the moment?\n\n16 MR. KHAN: It is, and I am grateful to my learned friend.\n\n17 MR. WHITING: If we could just conclude this clip.\n\n18 [Videotape played]\n\n19 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] To become more visible in our\n\n20 operations, persuade them that we were not what they thought we were and\n\n21 we that were not like certain organisations in Europe and that the KLA\n\n22 was something else and --\"\n\n23 MR. WHITING: The next clip begins at the top of page 11 of the\n\n24 transcript.\n\n25 Q. Could you introduce this clip for us, please, Mr. Lehtinen.\n\nPage 570\n\n1 A. Yes. This clip -- in this part of the interview Fatmir Limaj\n\n2 describes the different forms of warfare by the KLA. He says that the\n\n3 guerrilla tactics were active all the time and then from time to time\n\n4 they were involved in frontal warfare and he -- as examples he gives the\n\n5 fighting in Lapusnik and the fighting in Rahovec.\n\n6 MR. WHITING: Could we see this clip, please.\n\n7 [Videotape played]\n\n8 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] The strategy, the entire strategy of\n\n9 the KLA was adapted to the specify conditions of the terrain in which we\n\n10 were in and also the specifics of our military organisation. Our\n\n11 guerrilla activity was never out of the daily agenda, if I can put it\n\n12 that way; it always existed. But the conduct of a frontal war, we did\n\n13 this when we were forced and in places where it suited us. There were\n\n14 cases in which we were -- we inevitably had to fight a frontal war to\n\n15 defend the civilian population, always to defend the civilian population.\n\n16 Can you mention a definite case, a definite battle?\n\n17 A definite battle was for instance the case of Rahovec, where the\n\n18 KLA carried out an act of self-sacrifice entirely to protect the\n\n19 population. There were also cases, for example, at the Lapusnik pass.\n\n20 There were cases in Drenica. That is, there were many cases in which we\n\n21 were forced to join the line directly in a frontal war purely to protect\n\n22 the civilian population, to ... \"\n\n23 MR. WHITING: The last clip from this documentary starts on the\n\n24 middle of page 13 of the transcript.\n\n25 Q. Could you introduce this last clip, please.\n\nPage 571\n\n1 A. Yes. This clip describes -- Mr. Limaj describes fighting in\n\n2 Rahovec again and he says that he was there as the commander of the 121st\n\n3 Brigade.\n\n4 Q. And when again was the battle at Rahovec?\n\n5 A. It was from the 17th of July, 1998, up until approximately the\n\n6 21st of July, 1998.\n\n7 MR. WHITING: Could we see this clip, please.\n\n8 [Videotape played]\n\n9 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] People would not have trusted us\n\n10 because of our age. But one thing was important. For instance, in the\n\n11 case of the prime minister, of Prime Minister Thaci. We were together in\n\n12 Rahovec and during the fighting we took turns on duty. We were soldiers\n\n13 on the front line, together with the soldiers, so we presented ourselves\n\n14 as men, as representatives of the General Staff or unit commander. For\n\n15 instance, I was commander of the 121st Brigade. They saw us as being at\n\n16 that level. For instance, they considered Hashim as being a\n\n17 representative of the General Staff or of Drenica. And after all that,\n\n18 all the fighting, those who had been at Rahovec and other lines, when the\n\n19 names of people who were members of the General Staff were published they\n\n20 were shocked and they said, We thought the General Staff was in some\n\n21 bunker somewhere, giving out orders and making plans, and that they gave\n\n22 them to you and that you had the privilege of seeing the General Staff\n\n23 and you were the people who brought these to us on the front line. And\n\n24 if anybody said this to us three months ago, that a member of the General\n\n25 Staff would have been on the front line with us, we would have had a\n\nPage 572\n\n1 heart attack. It is in the interest that Serbia itself never thought\n\n2 that the members of the General Staff were closer to them than even the\n\n3 soldiers. Our bases were always 200 or 300 or 500 metres from the Serb\n\n4 police.\n\n5 MR. WHITING: We are now going to look at various public source\n\n6 documents. If we could turn to the document at tab 31 which is U0037154\n\n7 to 7155.\n\n8 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, just generally in connection with this\n\n9 investigation, have there -- have newspaper articles been collected?\n\n10 A. Yes.\n\n11 Q. Could you explain for the Court where these articles for the most\n\n12 part have been obtained from.\n\n13 A. Yes. These articles have been collected from something called\n\n14 the FBIS which is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, which is a\n\n15 U.S. governmental operation for translating articles from around the\n\n16 world.\n\n17 Q. Turning to the first document, can you tell us what this is.\n\n18 A. This is a document from the FBIS dated 3rd of June, 1998, and\n\n19 it's an interview with Mr. Celiku.\n\n20 Q. And it appeared where? What is the source of the interview?\n\n21 A. It appears to be a television network in Tirana, Albanian.\n\n22 Q. If you could just read the highlighted portions on the screen,\n\n23 please. And if they could be blown up.\n\n24 A. So it's: \"Interview with Mr. Celiku, one of the liberation army\n\n25 of Kosovo UCK, commanders of one area in Drenica from Decani by\n\nPage 573\n\n1 correspondent Asllan Bajrami on 3 June -- recorded.\"\n\n2 This is Celiku talking. \"The greater part of the Drenice\n\n3 territory and of the Llapushe in general is free and under the control of\n\n4 our forces, that is, under the UCK's control. Our forces have had\n\n5 control of the Pristina-Peja highway for one month now starting with the\n\n6 checkpoint at Komorane and further.\n\n7 \"During fighting in Gryke e Llaposhnikut, our army caused\n\n8 considerable damage to the enemy in people and military equipment,\n\n9 killing and wounding dozens of enemies. No one from our army ranks\n\n10 suffered any casualties. The enemy, horrified at the heroism of our\n\n11 fires, started to burn houses and kill the innocent civil population.\"\n\n12 Q. If we could turn to the next page of that document and if you\n\n13 could read the highlighted portion from the screen, please.\n\n14 A. It's again Mr. Celiku speaking.\n\n15 \"Since the start of war, the Albanian political forces have\n\n16 ignored us completely. Indifferent toward our war, they went so far as\n\n17 to dissociate themselves from the war and are disassociating themselves\n\n18 from the people, too.\n\n19 \"It is my duty to repeat here once again the position of the UCK\n\n20 central staff -- there can be no talks about Kosovo without the presence\n\n21 of our representatives. Kosovo is dragging,\" this is in brackets, \"all\n\n22 the Albanian territories that are under the Serb, Macedonian, and\n\n23 Montenegrin rule.\"\n\n24 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n25 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P37.\n\nPage 574\n\n1 MR. WHITING:\n\n2 Q. If you turn to the next document which is a photograph, U0034019.\n\n3 MR. KHAN: Your Honour, if I can ask for the sake of\n\n4 clarification because we don't have the original document whether or not\n\n5 that FIBS report is from 1998 or from 1999.\n\n6 MR. WHITING: It's from 1998.\n\n7 MR. KHAN: Thank you.\n\n8 MR. WHITING: Yes.\n\n9 Q. Turning now to the next document, which is a photograph. Mr.\n\n10 Lehtinen, what is this photograph?\n\n11 A. This is a photograph of a sign -- a sign on the side of the road.\n\n12 It's the road that is seen here is the Pristina-Peja highway. And this\n\n13 sign is alongside this road.\n\n14 Q. And is it at Lapusnik?\n\n15 A. Yes.\n\n16 Q. And did you take this photograph?\n\n17 A. I did.\n\n18 Q. When?\n\n19 A. This was taken in May of 2003.\n\n20 Q. And what does the sign depict?\n\n21 A. The sign shows the UCK/KLA emblem, and it pays attribute to the\n\n22 battle in the gorge of Lapusnik on the 9th of May, 1998.\n\n23 MR. WHITING: If this could be given a number, please.\n\n24 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P38.\n\n25 MR. WHITING:\n\nPage 575\n\n1 Q. Now, if we could turn to the third binder of documents, tabs 33\n\n2 to 47, please.\n\n3 JUDGE PARKER: Could you pause a moment, please, Mr. Whiting.\n\n4 Thank you.\n\n5 MR. WHITING:\n\n6 Q. Turning to the first document in that binder at tab 33. What is\n\n7 this document?\n\n8 A. Again, this is a document from FBIS and it's a newspaper article\n\n9 from the Pristina Bujkutin on the 4th of July, 1998.\n\n10 Q. Could you read the highlighted portion of the article, please,\n\n11 and if it could be blown up.\n\n12 A. It says: \"Drenice e Eperme, 3 July. Drenice e Eperme witnessed\n\n13 a special occasion today when soldiers of the units of the Kosovo\n\n14 Liberation Army [UCK] were sworn in. Members of the population also\n\n15 attended the ceremony. Commander Sokoli ['falcon,' evidently a nom de\n\n16 guerre, but also an Albanian surname] reported on the units, and\n\n17 Commander Celiku ['steel,' also either a nom de guerre, or a surname]\n\n18 reviewed the troops. The participants saluted the national flag and the\n\n19 servicemen were solemnly sworn in.\n\n20 \"Commander Celiku said in his speech that our army was born and\n\n21 has grown up in war. It is spreading not by the inch but by the mile.\n\n22 We will continue the struggle we have begun until all the occupied\n\n23 territory of Albania is liberated. The seriousness, morale, and strength\n\n24 of the UCK is becoming apparent every day and the UCK is becoming\n\n25 recognised as an important factor. It has deep roots in the people and\n\nPage 576\n\n1 is as inseparable from them as flesh is from the bone.\"\n\n2 MR. WHITING: Could this document be given a number, please.\n\n3 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P39.\n\n4 MR. WHITING: If we could turn to the next document at tab 34.\n\n5 Q. Could you tell us what this is, please.\n\n6 A. This is a telephone record about fighting still continuing in\n\n7 Lapusnik. And it's dated on the 26th of July, 1998.\n\n8 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n9 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P40.\n\n10 MR. WHITING:\n\n11 Q. The next document at tab 35. What is this?\n\n12 A. This is another article, and it's headed \"Police 'crush terrorist\n\n13 groups' at Lapusnik.\" It's dated 27th of July, 1998.\n\n14 Q. And from the first line of the text, what is the source of this?\n\n15 A. It seems to be the newspaper Tanjug.\n\n16 MR. WHITING: Can this be given a number, please.\n\n17 THE REGISTRAR: That would be Prosecution Exhibit P41.\n\n18 MR. WHITING: Next document at tab 36 is a photograph marked\n\n19 U0034003.\n\n20 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, did you take this photograph?\n\n21 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n22 Q. And what is depicted in the photograph?\n\n23 A. This is a memorial of a man called Ali B. Zogaj who has died on\n\n24 the 26th of July, 1998, and this memorial is in Lapusnik at one of the\n\n25 described fighting positions on the slope along the mountain in Lapusnik.\n\nPage 577\n\n1 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n2 THE REGISTRAR: That would be Prosecution Exhibit P42.\n\n3 MR. WHITING: The next document, tab 37.\n\n4 Q. What is this, please?\n\n5 A. This is again an article about Lapusnik headed: \"KIC names\n\n6 casualties of Lapusnik, Malisevo, and Pec fighting.\" It's dated on the\n\n7 28th of July, 1998.\n\n8 MR. WHITING: Could this be given an exhibit number.\n\n9 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P43.\n\n10 MR. WHITING: The next document, please, at tab 38.\n\n11 Q. What is this, Mr. Lehtinen?\n\n12 A. It's a newspaper article from -- dated on the 3rd of September,\n\n13 1998, headed: \"UCK commander of Lapusnik and Kacanik battles.\"\n\n14 Q. And what is the source?\n\n15 A. The source is called Zeri I Kosoves. And it seems to be\n\n16 published in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\n17 Q. Who is the interview with?\n\n18 A. This interview is with Commander Celiku.\n\n19 Q. Turning to the second page of the text, could you please read the\n\n20 highlighted portion of the text and if it could be blown up on the\n\n21 screen.\n\n22 A. So this is a question by the newspaper.\n\n23 \"This fire of war burned the enemies in the strait of Lapusnik\n\n24 where you were in command, and it was ^personified in the strait of\n\n25 Kacanik.\"\n\nPage 578\n\n1 And this is Commander Celiku: \"There was combat and resistance\n\n2 there that only the Albanians know how to carry out. With the assistance\n\n3 of other units that were positioned on the other side of the strait, the\n\n4 Pellumbi and Guri units, and of course with the sacrifice and fighting\n\n5 spirit of our three units, we dealt a strong blow to the enemy who will\n\n6 remember us for a long time because of the losses we inflicted upon him.\n\n7 The maintaining of the strait of Lapusnik for our army and people has had\n\n8 special significance because this strait increased the importance of our\n\n9 army. This strait made it possible to transport the people and to arm\n\n10 them on a massive level and it became the organic linking point for the\n\n11 liberated territories.\"\n\n12 The newspaper again: \"We have learned only about the successes\n\n13 of our army, but have not these successes begun to diminish recently?\"\n\n14 Then commander Celiku: \"No. There has been no diminishment and\n\n15 there is no reason for defeatism. Simultaneously, there was a withdrawal\n\n16 of forces and a courageous combat. We fought against 138 tanks,\n\n17 surface-to-surface rockets and Katusha rockets, mine launchers of all\n\n18 calibres, and chemical poisons. The soldiers fought against this arsenal\n\n19 of the aggressor. The withdrawal of forces took place only after the\n\n20 people withdrew to secure places and after their defence was assured. We\n\n21 were fighting at a distance of a dozen metres. After the combat ended,\n\n22 we analysed the situation and concluded that we were winners from a\n\n23 military point of view. We had minimal losses, only two of our soldiers\n\n24 were killed, while enemy losses were more than 100. We maintained the\n\n25 military factor which is decisive in a war.\n\nPage 579\n\n1 \"From a strategic aspect we lost control in some places, but we\n\n2 cannot call this a diminishment of our successes, because we are aware\n\n3 that a war is not lost or won on the basis of one battle. We are\n\n4 prepared and we are determined to carry our war to the end and our war\n\n5 will end with the liberation and unification of the Albanian lands which\n\n6 is our military pledge and the political programme of the UCK.\"\n\n7 And this is the newspaper again: \"Since you brought up the\n\n8 political programme, we will ask you a political question: What do you\n\n9 think of Rugova's elections?\"\n\n10 And Commander Celiku replies: \"You expressed it very well.\n\n11 Rugova's elections. They were Rugova's and no one else's.\"\n\n12 Q. The battle he is talking about is the battle at the end of July,\n\n13 July 26, 1998?\n\n14 A. That's what it appears to be.\n\n15 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n16 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P44.\n\n17 MR. WHITING:\n\n18 Q. Turning to the next tab, tab 39. What is this?\n\n19 A. This is an interview with the Pristina Java on the 20th of\n\n20 February 2003. It's an interview with Mr. Fatmir Limaj after the\n\n21 indictment of the ICTY.\n\n22 Q. Turning to the second page of this interview, could you read the\n\n23 highlighted question and answer, please.\n\n24 A. It's someone called Desku asking the question.\n\n25 \"It is being said that the three others arrested by The Hague\n\nPage 580\n\n1 were your soldiers. Is this true?\"\n\n2 And Mr. Limaj replies: \"The truth is that they were in various\n\n3 units. They were in my unit, but also in other units.\"\n\n4 MR. WHITING: Could this document be given a number, please.\n\n5 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P45.\n\n6 MR. WHITING:\n\n7 Q. The next document at tab 40, Mr. Lehtinen, what is this?\n\n8 A. This is a missing persons report from the OSCE, Kosovo\n\n9 Verifications Mission.\n\n10 Q. And how was it observed?\n\n11 A. This has been obtained from the OSCE.\n\n12 Q. Do you know the date of this report?\n\n13 A. No, I don't know the exact day.\n\n14 Q. Do you know if it's from after the war?\n\n15 A. Yes, it's from after the war.\n\n16 Q. Turning to the second page. I won't ask you to read the text,\n\n17 but it's reporting the missing of which person?\n\n18 A. It's about the person called Hasan Hoxha.\n\n19 Q. And the circumstances they are describing are the circumstances\n\n20 of his disappearance?\n\n21 A. That's correct.\n\n22 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n23 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P46.\n\n24 MR. WHITING:\n\n25 Q. Tab 41, what is this, please.\n\nPage 581\n\n1 A. This is an article in a Serbian newspaper called Dnevnik on the\n\n2 29th of June, 1998, about three kidnapped Albanians.\n\n3 Q. And it's -- who are the three who are kidnapped?\n\n4 A. The three named persons are Agim Ademi, Vesel Ahmeti and Sucri\n\n5 Zumeri.\n\n6 Q. Do you know anything about this newspaper?\n\n7 A. I know it's based in Novi Sad.\n\n8 Q. Could we turn to the next --\n\n9 MR. WHITING: Oh, I'm sorry. The exhibit number, please.\n\n10 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P47.\n\n11 MR. WHITING: If we could turn to the collection of documents at\n\n12 tab 42 which is U0038552 through 8690.\n\n13 Q. Could you tell us, Mr. Lehtinen, what this collection of\n\n14 documents is.\n\n15 A. This is a group of reports and articles which is -- which are\n\n16 KLA -- Kosovo Liberation Army -- communiques, political, and policy\n\n17 statements.\n\n18 Q. From what time period, approximately?\n\n19 A. It's from before the war and during the war.\n\n20 Q. Looking at the first one at 8552, could you read the highlighted\n\n21 portion of that first KLA communique.\n\n22 A. Yes.\n\n23 \"Pristina Kosova daily report number 1144. In English, 20 May\n\n24 1997.\n\n25 \"In a press release communique number 33 faxed to the media, the\n\nPage 582\n\n1 UCK said it killed Hetem Dobruna at the Llozice village of Klina earlier\n\n2 this month, because of his 'notorious and open collaboration with the\n\n3 Serbian occupying authorities.'\"\n\n4 Q. Now these were published in various newspapers?\n\n5 A. That's correct.\n\n6 Q. Turning to 8554 which is two pages away, and appears on the\n\n7 screen. Could you read the highlighted portion of that communique,\n\n8 please, number 35, which was published in Pristina Koha Ditore on the 8th\n\n9 of August, 1997.\n\n10 A. \"In a communique for the media bearing the number 35. The\n\n11 organisation calling itself 'the Kosovo Liberation Army 'UCK' claims\n\n12 responsibility for recent armed incidents in Kosovo, in which Serbian\n\n13 policemen and two Albanian civilians were injured. This communique\n\n14 states: 'By a decision of the UCK central staff made on 3 and 4 August,\n\n15 our guerrilla units carried out three armed operations against the\n\n16 occupiers and their collaborators.' The organisation also claims\n\n17 responsibility for what are called 'the assassinations of Ali Qullapeku\n\n18 from Terstenik and Ramiz Leku from Baince near Glogovac.'\n\n19 \"The communique states: \"Because we are dealing with an enemy\n\n20 that understands nothing but the language of force, we are compelled,\n\n21 albeit against our will, to talk down the barrel of a gun; not as a\n\n22 terrorists, but as a liberation organisation that has set itself the task\n\n23 of fighting mercilessly against the invader and his collaborators until\n\n24 the Albanian lands are totally liberated.\"\n\n25 Q. Turn, please, to 8555 from the Pristina Kosova Daily Report, 20\n\nPage 583\n\n1 October 1997. Could you read the highlighted portion, please.\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 \"In similar fax messages bearing neither the date nor the place\n\n4 they were sent from, the alleged UCK has over this and last year claimed\n\n5 responsibility for attacks against members of the Serbian police in\n\n6 Kosovo and Albanians dubbed as 'collaborators of the Serbian regime in\n\n7 Kosovo.'\"\n\n8 Q. Turn please to 8556, public communique from the Tirana Television\n\n9 Network in Albania, 24 November 1997.

Could you read\n\n20 the highlighted portion, please.\n\n21 A. \"On 13 February 1990, Mustafe Kurti, a collaborator with the\n\n22 occupier, was liquidated. The communique containing a threat to the\n\n23 Albanian prime minister fabricated by the anti-Albanian circles and\n\n24 released in the name of the UCK is not ours and is invalid.\"\n\n25 Q. Turn now to 8561 communique for Pristina Bujku, 4 March 1998.\n\nPage 584\n\n1 Could you read the highlighted sentence.\n\n2 A. \"Death to enemies and traitors!\"\n\n3 Q.

Turning to the next page of that same interview at 8581. Could\n\n9 you read the highlighted section in the first paragraph at the top of the\n\n10 page.\n\n11 A. \"The UCK is a liberation army and a regular military formation.\n\n12 It is not an organisation or group that goes in for small-scale actions.\n\n13 Our operations are rather larger, and bear a greater resemblance to those\n\n14 of a regular army.\"\n\n15 Q. And now the next highlighted portion.\n\n16 A. \"The UCK General Staff had its say before the elections in\n\n17 Kosovo, and firmly took the view that the elections should not be held in\n\n18 time of war, because a part of Kosovo was in flames.\"\n\n19 Q. Turning to the next page of this interview with the KLA\n\n20 spokesman, 8582, could you read the highlighted portion there.\n\n21 A.

And who is he speaking about there?\n\n25 A. I believe he is speaking about Mr. Ibrahim Gugova.\n\nPage 586\n\n1 Q. Could you read the next highlighted section, please.\n\n2 A. Then Krasniqi: \"No. We considered that Ibrahim Rugova has\n\n3 committed a series of political mistakes, to the detriment of national\n\n4 cause, starting from the agreement on education, which came to nothing.\n\n5 \"He is the main divisive factor.\"\n\n6 Q. The next page of the interview, please, at 8583.\n\n7 A. \"Rugova is a pacifist and he is often said to believe in\n\n8 Gandhism.\" He is not a pacifist but a doormat. Rugova will not allow\n\n9 resistance but only subservience, letting yourself be trampled underfoot.\n\n10 We have lost our dignity as individuals, families and a nation. This is\n\n11 true of one-half of the nation. The philosophy of the UCK is to restore\n\n12 to these people their human, family, and national dignity, and to respond\n\n13 the enemy's barbaric violence with a liberation struggle.\"\n\n14 Q. I'm going to skip the portion at the bottom of the page. If we\n\n15 can turn to the next page. If you can read the highlighted portion at\n\n16 the bottom of the next page. This is 8584.\n\n17 A. \"The people of Kosovo are now on a war footing and are in action.\n\n18 We are moving in the direction of creating the institutions of war at the\n\n19 national level, which means that we will not create what you call lists,\n\n20 but national institutions of a war footing.\"\n\n21 Koha Ditore asks: \"What will the UCK do if someone enters into\n\n22 negotiations with Serbia without consulting you?\"\n\n23 Krasniqi answers: \"We will continue the war.\"\n\n24 MR. TOPOLSKI: That's okay.\n\n25 MR. WHITING: If we could turn to 8586, which is the continuation\n\nPage 587\n\n1 of the interview on the following day. It's published in Pristina Koha\n\n2 Ditore, 12 July, 1998.\n\n3 Q. And if you could read the highlighted portions of this\n\n4 continuation of the interview with Mr. Krasniqi.\n\n5 A. This is Mr. Krasniqi speaking again: \"The UCK is a new army in\n\n6 the process of formation. However, the UCK has had its own staff and its\n\n7 military hierarchy from the start, and still has today.\n\n8 \"The UCK is an organised army.\"\n\n9 And Krasniqi continues: \"No area of Kosovo has been able to arm\n\n10 itself without the supervision and organisation of the responsible people\n\n11 in the UCK.\n\n12 \"It is at a certain level in the hierarchy in which we have\n\n13 apportioned operational zones. These are military secrets, but there is\n\n14 also a hierarchy of the operational zones.\"\n\n15 Q. Could we turn to 8589. And it -- could you read Mr. Krasniqi's\n\n16 response in the middle of the page, please.\n\n17 A. \"The international community has criticised the violation of\n\n18 human rights in the kidnapping of Serbian and Montenegrin civilians.\n\n19 What can you say about this?\"\n\n20 And Krasniqi answers: \"It does indeed seem to us ridiculous to\n\n21 equate the operations of the UCK with those of the Serbian occupier,\n\n22 which are notorious throughout the world. On this point, it seems to me\n\n23 that the international community is not respecting its conventions,\n\n24 starting with the UN charter, et cetera, because the UCK has never dealt\n\n25 with civilians or only if they have been in the service of the army and\n\nPage 588\n\n1 the police and have done serious hard [sic] to the people and the\n\n2 Albanian national cause. There have been cases in which they have been\n\n3 kidnapped, but in this event they have been handed over to international\n\n4 organisations, of course when they have been innocent. First of all, all\n\n5 Serbian forces, whether the police, the military, or armed civilians, are\n\n6 our enemy.\n\n7 \"From the start, we had our own internal rules for our\n\n8 operations. These clearly lay down that the UCK recognises the Geneva\n\n9 Convention and the conventions governing the conduct of war -- even\n\n10 though it has not been offered the chance of signing them, as it would\n\n11 have done. We do not go in for kidnapping. Even if some people have\n\n12 suffered, these have been more Albanian collaborators than Serbian\n\n13 civilians. We do not deal with civilians, and we return those whom we\n\n14 take as prisoners of war. A few days ago we handed over two Serbs\n\n15 originating from Croatia to the International Red Cross. Those we have\n\n16 kidnapped are either announced in a list or reported to be executed, but\n\n17 we do not behave in a base fashion like Serbia -- we do not behave in a\n\n18 base fashion like Serbia.\"\n\n19 Sorry.\n\n20 Q. Thank you, Mr. Lehtinen. The reference to \"two Serbs originating\n\n21 from Croatia,\" who that is reference to?\n\n22 A. That is a reference to witnesses in this case.\n\n23 Q. Which two witnesses, please?\n\n24 A. These are called Vojko and (redacted).\n\n25 Q. Turning please to 8603. This is Pristina Koha Ditore, 12\n\nPage 589\n\n1 September, 1998. Could you read the highlighted portion of this\n\n2 statement, please.\n\n3 A. \"The UCK and the Albanian people are being stabbed in the back by\n\n4 collaborationist and pacifist elements.\n\n5 \"The General Staff of the UCK calls on the Albanian people in\n\n6 general and the people in Kosovo in particular to be vigilant against the\n\n7 misinformation of the enemy and the wicked pacifists, because the UCK did\n\n8 not take up arms simply to surrender them, but to fight for freedom.\n\n9 \"Let the chickens cluck for the pitiful pacifists, even while they are\n\n10 alive.\"\n\n11 Q. Turn please to 8606, statement of the General Staff of the KLA,\n\n12 published in Pristina Koha Ditore on 19 September 1998. If you could\n\n13 read the highlighted portion.\n\n14 A. \"Punitive measures of various kinds are also being undertaken\n\n15 against collaborationist elements that continue to serve the occupying\n\n16 power.\"\n\n17 MR. WHITING: Your Honour I would ask that this collection of\n\n18 documents be given a number.\n\n19 THE REGISTRAR: That collection will be Prosecution Exhibit P48.\n\n20 MR. WHITING: Turning now to the documents at tab 43.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, what are these documents, please?\n\n22 A. These are copies of the -- of parts of the original newspaper\n\n23 articles that were translated in the earlier batch.\n\n24 Q. So to be clear, these are originals of some of the articles that\n\n25 are included in the original batch -- or, the prior batch?\n\nPage 590\n\n1 A. Exactly.\n\n2 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, with the assistance of the usher, I\n\n3 actually have a chart which corresponds the documents in this collection\n\n4 to the documents in the prior collection. If they could be distributed,\n\n5 please.\n\n6 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you.\n\n7 MR. WHITING: Not every document that is in this batch at tab 43\n\n8 has a corresponding English translation in the prior exhibit, though\n\n9 nearly all of them do. And the chart makes it clear which ones\n\n10 correspond. The Prosecution would seek to rely only on those documents\n\n11 that are in Albanian in this collection which have a corresponding\n\n12 translation in the prior exhibit. However, I included all of them simply\n\n13 because it's part of one ERN range.\n\n14 And I would ask now that this collection of documents which is\n\n15 0081603 to 1636 and the chart that I have just distributed be given a\n\n16 number.\n\n17 THE REGISTRAR: The Albanian articles from ERN number EU0081603\n\n18 to 1636 will be Prosecution Exhibit P49. And the corresponding English\n\n19 ERN numbers will be 49 -- Prosecution Exhibit P49.1.\n\n20 MR. WHITING: The chart, you mean?\n\n21 THE REGISTRAR: The chart.\n\n22 MR. WHITING: Yes. Thank you.\n\n23 Q. Turning now please to the document that is at tab 44. Mr.\n\n24 Lehtinen, could you tell us what this is, please.\n\n25 A. This is a judgement in a case that was tried a court in Pristina.\n\nPage 591\n\n1 It's a war crimes case from -- where the incidents took place in the\n\n2 later part of 1998.\n\n3 Q. And when was the trial held? Was it held after the war?\n\n4 A. Yes. The trial was held after the war.\n\n5 Q. And was it before -- what kind of court? Can you describe the\n\n6 court and the proceedings.\n\n7 A. Yes. This case was investigated by international investigators\n\n8 in Kosovo and brought by international prosecutors, and the judges in\n\n9 this case were international.\n\n10 Q. And it pertains to what area in Kosovo?\n\n11 A. It's an area in the north-east of Kosovo. It was called the Llap\n\n12 Operational Zone. And there were KLA detention facilities in the\n\n13 following villages, which are: Bajgora, Lapashtica, Majac, Potok, and\n\n14 Koljic. The first four ones are in the municipality of Podujeva. And\n\n15 Koljic is in the municipality of Pristina, but north of Pristina, close\n\n16 to Podujeva.\n\n17 Q. And the time period I think you said pertains to the latter half\n\n18 of -- or late 1998 from August/September 1998?\n\n19 A. August, September, October of 1998, yes.\n\n20 Q. If you could just -- and the date of the judgement is 16 July,\n\n21 2003?\n\n22 A. That's correct.\n\n23 Q. If you could just read the highlighted portion on the first page\n\n24 which will continue on to the second page.\n\n25 A. \"In relation to Latif Gashi, aka commander Lata.\n\nPage 592\n\n1 \"During the period 30th October 1998 to late April 1999 in\n\n2 complicity with Rrustem Mustafa, and aided and abetted by Nazif Mehmeti\n\n3 and others and pursuant to a joint criminal plan, he illegally detained\n\n4 Kosovo Albanian citizens suspected of collaboration with Serbs in a\n\n5 detention centre organised by and under the control of the KLA at\n\n6 Lapashtica and also at Majac and Potok, by causing them to be detained in\n\n7 an inhumane conditions, depriving them of adequate sanitation and beating\n\n8 and torturing them, thus causing them great suffering and violation of\n\n9 their health and thereby depriving them of their right to a fair trial.\n\n10 \"The purpose of the plan being to seek to force those detailed to\n\n11 confess to disloyalty to the KLA and to punish those detailed for that\n\n12 alleged disloyalty to the KLA, Count 2, 5, and 8.\n\n13 Sorry, I'll start from the beginning.\n\n14 \"During the period 31st May, 1999, until an unknown date in\n\n15 mid-June 1999, at an unknown location in Koliq in complicity with Naim\n\n16 Kadriu he illegally detained beat and tortured Witnesses Q and R, thus\n\n17 exposing them to great suffering and violation of bodily health, and\n\n18 thereby depriving them of their right to a fair trial (Count 3 and 9).\n\n19 \"During the period 1st August 1998, to 26 September 1998, at a\n\n20 detention centre organised by and under the control of KLA at Bajgora, he\n\n21 beat and tortured Milovan Stankovic, thereby exposing him to great\n\n22 suffering and violation of bodily health and thus aided and abetted the\n\n23 unlawful detention of Milovan Stankovic. (Count 12 and 14.)\"\n\n24 Q. Could you turn please to page 1484 by ERN number and 21 by\n\n25 judgement number of this judgement and now read the highlighted portion.\n\nPage 593\n\n1 A. \"In the vast majority of cases, persons were detained for reasons\n\n2 that the trial panel found were insufficient, sometimes grossly so, even\n\n3 for the preliminary step of arrest to be justified. In those cases,\n\n4 detention was arbitrary from the moment of arrest. In cases where the\n\n5 trial panel found that the reasons could justify arrest, it was clear\n\n6 that no independent process of review, nor any subsequent judicial\n\n7 process was established by which a detainee could challenge the order for\n\n8 his or her detention. In all cases, the intention to prosecute detainees\n\n9 for their alleged offenses or other violations according to the KLA was\n\n10 pursued in breach of the requirements of Common Article 3 and Protocol\n\n11 II.\n\n12 \"The evidence in the case indicates that whether or not a\n\n13 detainee was released from detention depended on the view of the senior\n\n14 KLA commanders and no one else. In this case, the trial panel found that\n\n15 during the armed conflict of 1998 and 1999 Kosovar Albanians accused of\n\n16 being collaborators were forcibly abducted, or in some cases summoned and\n\n17 placed into detention for alleged infractions that were at best\n\n18 ill-defined. The essence of the allegations varied, although in most\n\n19 cases the effect was to assert that the conduct of such persons was\n\n20 inappropriate or disloyal to the KLA. It was clear from the evidence of\n\n21 the defendants that the detention of the detainees was effected with a\n\n22 view to some form of summary trial process being carried out. The fact\n\n23 that such trial proceedings as took place lacked basic judicial\n\n24 guarantees, and yet the detention of many persons was maintained leads\n\n25 inevitably to the conclusion that the detention of those persons was a\n\nPage 594\n\n1 blatant breach of Article 9 of the ICCPR, Common Article 3 and Article 6\n\n2 of Protocol III. The absence of any clear legal directives by the KLA\n\n3 governing detention and trial in areas of Kosovo under KLA control only\n\n4 serves to aggravate this situation.\"\n\n5 Q. Now turning to page 84 of the judgement, which is 1547 by ERN\n\n6 number. In the interests of saving time, expediting, I would just ask\n\n7 you to read the last paragraph on that page.\n\n8 A. \"The trial panel has no doubt that the treatment of detainees at\n\n9 Llapashtica was appalling. As emphasised above, the conditions in the\n\n10 room in which as many as fifteen or sixteen detainees were incarcerated\n\n11 were unquestionably inhuman. Again, as at Bare/Bajgora, the proposition\n\n12 of the defendants that questioning did not take place is simply untrue.\n\n13 \"Further, the trial panel finds that those who were detained for\n\n14 substantial periods of time were subject to routine beatings in an\n\n15 attempt to cause them to confess to acts of disloyalty to the KLA, and/or\n\n16 to extract information or confessions from them. The treatment of those\n\n17 detainees thus amounted to torture.\"\n\n18 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, could this document be given a number,\n\n19 please.\n\n20 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P50.\n\n21 MR. WHITING:\n\n22 Q. Turning now to tab 45 [sic]. Mr. Lehtinen, what is at that tab?\n\n23 A. This is a decision and a correction to the previous judgement\n\n24 where a date has been wrongly inputted. The correct date at this place\n\n25 is 27th of March, 1999, whereas it has been mentioned as 27th of April,\n\nPage 595\n\n1 1999.\n\n2 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n3 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P51.\n\n4 MR. WHITING: Turning now to the next document, which is entitled\n\n5 Kosovo Biographical Reporting, Fatmir Limaj.\n\n6 Q. What is this document, Mr. Lehtinen?\n\n7 A. Well, this is a biographical reporting on Mr. Fatmir Limaj by the\n\n8 U.S. office in Pristina.\n\n9 Q. What is the date of the document?\n\n10 A. It's dated on the 2nd of March, 2001.\n\n11 Q. And how was it obtained?\n\n12 A. This has been received from the United States government.\n\n13 Q. Turning please to the second page of the document at number 5.\n\n14 Could you please read the highlighted portion.\n\n15 A. \"With the outbreak of war in Kosovo in spring 1998, Limaj became\n\n16 one of the first KLA commanders to go public - using his nickname\n\n17 'Celiku' (steel). Initially Limaj served for five months as a brigade\n\n18 commander in the Malisevo area, where he gained the reputation of being\n\n19 harsh and stubborn. Observers from the Kosovo diplomatic observer\n\n20 mission, KDOM, and the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, KVM, found him\n\n21 very hard to negotiate with, and were unable to persuade him to restrain\n\n22 his soldiers from shooting at police patrols. That fall, Limaj became a\n\n23 member of the KLA General Staff.\"\n\n24 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, please.\n\n25 THE REGISTRAR: That could be Prosecution Exhibit P52.\n\nPage 596\n\n1 MR. WHITING: The next document, please, K0310973 to 0979.\n\n2 Q. What is this document?\n\n3 A. This is a statement by the Serb police. It's a statement from a\n\n4 person called Hisni Murseli.\n\n5 Q. What is the date of the statement?\n\n6 A. It's the 10th of January, 1999.\n\n7 Q. How was this statement obtained?\n\n8 A. This -- we have received this as part of a large number of\n\n9 documents that were seized from the Pristina court in June of 1999,\n\n10 immediately after the war.\n\n11 Q. They were seized under what authority?\n\n12 A. They were seized under warrant from the tribunal.\n\n13 Q. From the Pristina court?\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. Has this document then been in the custody of the tribunal since\n\n16 that time, approximately June of 1999?\n\n17 A. That's correct.\n\n18 Q. Now, do you know -- have you learned if Mr. Murseli, the person\n\n19 whose statement it is, is still alive?\n\n20 A. I've learned that this person called Hisni Murseli is not alive.\n\n21 Q. How did you learn that?\n\n22 A. I've spoken to his brother and I've learned that he was -- he\n\n23 died in January of 1999.\n\n24 Q. What did he tell you about what he knew first of all about his\n\n25 detention and then subsequently about his death?\n\nPage 597\n\n1 A. Mr. Murseli's brother told me that around the 8th of January,\n\n2 1999, his brother was arrested by the Serb police and that is the last he\n\n3 knows about him. Approximately 20 days later, the family of Hisni\n\n4 Murseli is informed that Mr. Murseli had died and the body could be\n\n5 recovered from the morgue in Pristina.\n\n6 Q. Now, Mr. Lehtinen, do you know from this document what the --\n\n7 whether the information that was provided by Mr. Murseli was -- or\n\n8 purports to be provided by Mr. Murseli was in fact provided by him or was\n\n9 simply put down on the paper by those interviewing him?\n\n10 A. That is impossible to say.\n\n11 Q. Could you read the highlighted portion, please, of the first page\n\n12 of the interview.\n\n13 A. \"In May 1998, I arrived to the country from Slovenia, where I was\n\n14 temporarily working. I came so as to actively join the KLA, which I did\n\n15 shortly after in my village Nekovac. Territorially, my village came\n\n16 under the KLA Celiku unit, which was led my Fatmir Limaj, from Banja\n\n17 village, near Malisevo.\"\n\n18 Q. Turning now to page 4 of the interview. Could you read the\n\n19 highlighted portion, please.\n\n20 A. \"I know that KLA units were also organised in other villages,\n\n21 such as Sedlare, where the staff was in the 'Karpuzi' town quarter; in\n\n22 the Sopi and Gasi town quarters in Lapusnik, which numbered about 70\n\n23 members; one in Donja Fustica, with 10 members; and one in Gornja\n\n24 Fustica, with 26 members. There were no other organised units in\n\n25 Komorane, except for those in the Viljak and Buzalja town quarters, which\n\nPage 598\n\n1 were near Kisna Reka. All these units fell under the Celiku KLA military\n\n2 formation commanded with Fatmir Limaj, which had staffs in Klecka and\n\n3 Berisa villages.\"\n\n4 Q. Turning now to the next page, please. Could you read the\n\n5 highlighted portion.\n\n6 A. \"During the combat action between the MUP and the KLA in Lapusnik\n\n7 - where the KLA controlled a part of the Pristina-Pec main road - a large\n\n8 number of KLA members were deployed at positions in Lapusnik. During the\n\n9 first days, my unit was not sent to these positions since Fatmir Limaj\n\n10 thought there were enough forces already present. However, following the\n\n11 withdrawal of the Plumbi KLA forces from that area to the Pogrk town\n\n12 quarter of Lapusnik, Fatmir Limaj personally came to Kisna Reka and\n\n13 ordered us to the positions in Lapusnik. Around 0200 hours that same\n\n14 night, my department went on foot to Lapusnik, where we took up positions\n\n15 in the trenches in the 'Sopi' town quarter. In the morning, we fought\n\n16 with the MUP members, and then after a few hours of armed combat,\n\n17 retreated towards Berisa village.\n\n18 \"Pursuant to orders from Fatmir Limaj, my department was\n\n19 transferred from Berisa village to Negrovac village in order to take part\n\n20 in further combat against MUP members. We were then transferred to the\n\n21 Djurdjica town quarter in Orlate village, Glogovac municipality, where we\n\n22 took up positions and fought with the MUP members. After three or four\n\n23 hours of combat we retreated to Berisa village. I would like to mention\n\n24 that several KLA commander, such as Fatmir Limaj, Shaban Shala, Jakup\n\n25 Krasniqi were staying in Berisa village at that time.\"\n\nPage 599\n\n1 Q. If we could turn to page 7 of this report. If you could read\n\n2 this highlighted portion, please.\n\n3 A. \"I would like to add that there was an improvised prison in the\n\n4 Gashi town quarter in Lapusnik, where KLA members detained kidnapped\n\n5 Serbs and Albanians. I know that the prison was a type of bunker, dug\n\n6 out under the ground and located at Shaqir Vojvoda's house in the\n\n7 vicinity of Bali Vojvoda's house where one of the KLA staffs is\n\n8 headquartered. There were about 35 Serbs detained in this prison and\n\n9 about as many Albanians. As far as I know, just before the clash between\n\n10 the MUP and the KLA in Lapusnik, the detainees from this prison were\n\n11 transferred to Klecka and I don't know what happened to them\n\n12 subsequently.\n\n13 \"The Albanians that were detained in the prison were labelled as\n\n14 being 'Serbian spies.' I know that Hazir Dugolli from Nekovac, and Shaban\n\n15 Syliqi, from Kisna Reka were amongst the detainees. As far as Shaban\n\n16 Syliqi is concerned, I know that he spent two or three months in the\n\n17 prison at the beginning of summer 1998 - between May and June\n\n18 approximately - and was freed by Commander Maliq Vilaku, who vouched that\n\n19 he was not a 'spy' and that he had complete trust in him. Immediately\n\n20 upon his release, Shaban Syliqi joined the KLA and received a 20 rifle\n\n21 from Maliq and was later issued with a Gulinov-type heavy machine-gun.\"\n\n22 MR. WHITING: Could this be given a number, Your Honour.\n\n23 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P53.\n\n24 JUDGE PARKER: That may be a convenient time, Mr. Whiting.\n\n25 MR. WHITING: Yes.\n\nPage 600\n\n1 JUDGE PARKER: We will resume at 10 minutes to.\n\n2 --- Recess taken at 5.27 p.m.\n\n3 --- On resuming at 5.53 p.m.\n\n4 JUDGE PARKER: Mr. Whiting.\n\n5 MR. WHITING: Thank you, Your Honour. We've now completed with\n\n6 the third binder, and there's just one remaining exhibit which is the\n\n7 Victims booklet, collection of photographs, which I hope has been\n\n8 provided.\n\n9 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, do you have the book of victims in front of you?\n\n10 A. Yes, I do.\n\n11 Q. It is labelled \"Killed Victims and Surviving Victims.\" Can you\n\n12 tell us what is contained in this booklet.\n\n13 A. These are pictures of victims related to the case and there is\n\n14 two sections; the first section is killed victims and the later section\n\n15 is surviving victims. And each picture has the ERN number of a\n\n16 photograph and the name of the person. And at the beginning --\n\n17 MR. KHAN: Your Honour.\n\n18 JUDGE PARKER: Yes.\n\n19 MR. KHAN: I just rise to note the obvious. It does appear there\n\n20 is a problem with the LiveNote. It's not up to speed, as it were.\n\n21 JUDGE PARKER: Mine is.\n\n22 MR. KHAN: Ours is not, Your Honour.\n\n23 I think my friend can continue as long as it's on the -- the\n\n24 transcript is available. Hopefully it can be solved from outside the\n\n25 courtroom.\n\nPage 601\n\n1 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you. Technical help is on its way.\n\n2 MR. WHITING: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n3 Q. If you can proceed, if you remember where you were in your\n\n4 answer.\n\n5 A. Yes. At the beginning of both the sections there is an index\n\n6 with the names and the ERN numbers and it also indicates the page number\n\n7 or consecutive number of the photographs in each section.\n\n8 Q. Can you tell us how these photographs were obtained.\n\n9 A. The photographs of killed victims have been gathered from\n\n10 families and relatives of the victims. And for the survived victims,\n\n11 they have been obtained from the persons themselves in question.\n\n12 Q. And from those sources, have you been able to confirm that each\n\n13 person who is identified in the photograph is actually that person?\n\n14 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n15 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I'm not going to go through these\n\n16 photographs, but I ask that this booklet be given a number, please, and\n\n17 it also be under seal.\n\n18 THE WITNESS: Your Honour, can I have one more comment on this.\n\n19 JUDGE PARKER: [Microphone not activated]\n\n20 MR. WHITING:\n\n21 Q. Yes. If you have another comment.\n\n22 A. I wanted to comment on the list of killed victims. They all\n\n23 have -- they are all of some relation to the investigation with the\n\n24 exception -- and each of them will be described as witnesses to have some\n\n25 relation to the prison camp in Lapusnik, except for number 25 of the\n\nPage 602\n\n1 killed victims, who is related to the disappearance and his -- to the\n\n2 disappearance of other prisoners. And he -- and the disappearance of\n\n3 this person happens at the same time period. But no witness will mention\n\n4 him in the Lapusnik prison camp.\n\n5 Q. Thank you, Mr. Lehtinen, for that clarification.\n\n6 MR. WHITING: If this could be given a number, and it be under\n\n7 seal, please.\n\n8 THE REGISTRAR: That will be Prosecution Exhibit P54, under seal.\n\n9 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I have no further questions of this\n\n10 witness. I just have two procedural matters to attend to. The first is\n\n11 that the witness has marked four maps, maps 5 and 6 and images 7 and 8.\n\n12 I would ask that those be given numbers, and I know that three numbers\n\n13 were reserved already.\n\n14 THE REGISTRAR: Mr. Whiting, the map number 6 from Prosecution\n\n15 Exhibit P1 will be Prosecution Exhibit P2. Image number 7 arising from\n\n16 Prosecution Exhibit P1 will be Prosecution Exhibit P3. Image number 8\n\n17 arising in Prosecution Exhibit P1 will be Prosecution Exhibit P4. And\n\n18 map number 5 arising from Prosecution Exhibit P1 that was marked today\n\n19 will be Prosecution Exhibit P55 [sic].\n\n20 MR. WHITING: And these are marked versions of these maps.\n\n21 THE REGISTRAR: That's correct.\n\n22 MR. WHITING: Thank you.\n\n23 The second procedural matter is I -- and forgive me if this is\n\n24 unnecessary -- but I would now move all the exhibits into evidence.\n\n25 Perhaps that has already been done. Perhaps it's already been admitted\n\nPage 603\n\n1 into evidence. I'm just not familiar with the procedural mechanism of\n\n2 this courtroom.\n\n3 JUDGE PARKER: [Microphone not activated] when an exhibit is\n\n4 allocated an exhibit number -- I beg your pardon. If it is allocated an\n\n5 exhibit number, the exhibit is in evidence. If it is marked for\n\n6 identification, it is not in evidence.\n\n7 MR. WHITING: And so all these exhibits are into evidence?\n\n8 JUDGE PARKER: Yes.\n\n9 MR. WHITING: Thank you, Your Honour. I have no further\n\n10 questions.\n\n11 MR. TOPOLSKI: [Microphone not activated]\n\n12 JUDGE PARKER: [Microphone not activated]\n\n13 MR. TOPOLSKI: May I observe that it's a career first that I rise\n\n14 to cross-examine the witness at 6.00 on a Friday evening.\n\n15 Cross-examined by Mr. Topolski:\n\n16 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, I think as you already know, I together with Mr.\n\n17 Powles represent Isak Musliu. There are a number of questions I would\n\n18 like to ask you and I would indicate to help you and to help everybody\n\n19 else follow, as it were, headings of areas I would like to ask you about.\n\n20 Can I ask you first of all some questions about your approach to\n\n21 the investigation generally. You have, do you not, considerable\n\n22 experience in Kosovo?\n\n23 A. That's correct.\n\n24 Q. Do you in fact speak Albanian?\n\n25 A. No, I don't.\n\nPage 604\n\n1 Q. You told us yesterday that you served as a police officer there\n\n2 in 2000 and 2001.\n\n3 A. Correct.\n\n4 Q. You were in the region, as you described it, as a peacekeeper in\n\n5 1995 and 1996. Was that in Kosovo?\n\n6 A. That was not in Kosovo.\n\n7 Q. Not in Kosovo.\n\n8 You have been, have you not, intimately involved in this\n\n9 particular investigation for quite some time?\n\n10 A. That is correct.\n\n11 Q. And as I think the most senior investigator we're going to hear\n\n12 from, the person with perhaps the greatest knowledge of it; would that be\n\n13 right?\n\n14 A. That is right.\n\n15 Q. May I ask you then about how you approached that task, Mr.\n\n16 Lehtinen. As far as you are concerned and for those who you are\n\n17 responsible, would you regard your task as an objective search for the\n\n18 truth?\n\n19 A. Yes, I would.\n\n20 Q. Or seeking to prove a pre-conceived position? Which?\n\n21 A. I would chose the first one, to seek for the truth.\n\n22 Q. When conducting interviews, and we'll look later at parts of\n\n23 interviews, would you agree that it's appropriate to avoid asking\n\n24 witnesses leading questions?\n\n25 A. I agree.\n\nPage 605\n\n1 Q. We come from different parts of the same continent of Europe, you\n\n2 and I, so we ought to make sure we understand each other. What do you\n\n3 understand by the meaning of the term \"leading question\"?\n\n4 A. I would understand that as being -- asking a question where -- in\n\n5 a way that you actually show what answer you're expecting to get from who\n\n6 you interview.\n\n7 Q. I couldn't have put it better myself, Mr. Lehtinen.\n\n8 I wonder if you could be good enough to look at a file that we\n\n9 have prepared.\n\n10 MR. TOPOLSKI: Your Honours ought to have this. It's entitled\n\n11 \"Documents for use in the cross-examination of Mr. Lehtinen.\" Your\n\n12 Honours should have one each.\n\n13 Your Honours, could I indicate, please, that this bundle was\n\n14 handed to the Prosecution last night for them to consider it overnight.\n\n15 Q. Mr. Lehtinen, what this bundle is is an extract from various\n\n16 documents in the case, you'll appreciate. And I just want to ask you on\n\n17 the subject that we've just been discussing, leading questions, one or\n\n18 two matters, if I may. First of all, the first document is in fact parts\n\n19 of the interview of the witness Shukri Buja. Do you see a tab marked\n\n20 tab 1, Mr. Lehtinen?\n\n21 A. Yes, I do.\n\n22 Q. Could you go to that tab, which ought to be on page 8639. I'm\n\n23 just referring to the last four digits. Do you have that?\n\n24 A. Yes, I have that.\n\n25 Q. And you are, are you not, the OL referred to on that page?\n\nPage 606\n\n1 A. That is correct.\n\n2 Q. And you can see there that the subject matter of the questioning\n\n3 is at this stage abductions.\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. Could you go. If you want to do it on the internal paging, this\n\n6 is page 1. If you turn on to page 20 or 8658, whichever you prefer. I\n\n7 want to draw your attention if I may, to a question you ask this witness,\n\n8 who we are going to hear from, just over halfway down.\n\n9 \"The times you visited the camp, let's call it a camp, or the\n\n10 main -- this place in Lapusnik.\"\n\n11 Do you see that?\n\n12 A. Mm-hmm.\n\n13 Q. And if you go three -- four pages on to internal page 24 or top\n\n14 right-hand corner page 8662, let's just look at how else it is described.\n\n15 By you near the top of the page: \"When you went into this place, did you\n\n16 run into guards? So let's call it a prison.\"\n\n17 Just over halfway down, the witness refers to it as a \"point.\"\n\n18 You refer to it as \"the place.\" Maybe you think this is a silly point,\n\n19 Mr. Lehtinen, I don't know; maybe others do, too. But are you putting\n\n20 words in the witness's mouth there using the word \"place\"?\n\n21 A. Well, it certainly hasn't been my intention to do so. And am I\n\n22 allowed to -- do you want me to --\n\n23 Q. I've asked you the question. You must answer it.\n\n24 A. These kind of interviews are -- we're going on for a long time,\n\n25 we're talking about this place or what we call it. The witness in this\n\nPage 607\n\n1 case has certainly not used the word \"prison\" about it. And there's\n\n2 clearly -- it's, clearly, not clear to us what common name we use for the\n\n3 place in question.\n\n4 Q. Was it your view of this investigation, once you became involved\n\n5 in it, Mr. Lehtinen, that this was a prison, this place? Was that your\n\n6 view of it?\n\n7 A. From reviewing the material that was available when I started the\n\n8 investigation, yes.\n\n9 Q. Let's just have a look at how your general attitude to the issue\n\n10 of prisons may have revealed itself. At the very beginning of this\n\n11 section of this file -- again, as I've indicated one is looking here at\n\n12 parts of the interviews of Shukri Buja. Could I ask you, please, to go\n\n13 to page 18, 8633.\n\n14 A. 8633.\n\n15 Q. Yes. Which on this particular page is just a little way down\n\n16 from the top of it. Do you have that? Internal page 18, 8633. Have you\n\n17 got that?\n\n18 A. Yes.\n\n19 Q. And it's you speaking at the bottom of the page:\n\n20 \"You were fighting a war against the Serbs and for the freedom of\n\n21 your people and your country, but the fact is things happened in the area\n\n22 that were not justifiable, even if there was a war going on.\"\n\n23 That's you speaking, Mr. Lehtinen, is it not?\n\n24 A. That's correct.\n\n25 Q. And does it in effect indicate your general approach to the\n\nPage 608\n\n1 question of camps, that is to say there is nothing necessarily wrong with\n\n2 a camp, it's just a matter of what goes on in it that may be the problem.\n\n3 Do I fairly summarise what seems to be your position in these two\n\n4 statements of yours?\n\n5 MR. WHITING: Your Honour, I'm goi"
