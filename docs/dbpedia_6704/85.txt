Zeenat Aman, a name that resonates with elegance and timeless beauty, has etched her mark as one of the most graceful actresses of the 90s era. In the digital age, this veteran actress continues to captivate hearts, not only through her glamorous photoshoots that set social media ablaze but also by generously sharing glimpses of her life's fascinating journey with her dedicated fans and followers.

Recently, the veteran actress took to her social media handle to reminisce about a cherished memory from 2016.

It was a moment of great honor for Zeenat Aman when she traveled to Oslo to attend a prestigious film festival. On this remarkable occasion, she was felicitated for her significant contributions to Indian cinema. However, what made this recognition even more special was the fact that Norway's Postal Department decided to pay tribute to her in a unique way—they issued a special stamp in her honor.

In her latest post, Zeenat Aman revealed the story behind these commemorative stamps, reflecting her genuine surprise and delight at the gesture. She wrote, "I was thrilled by this novel gesture of appreciation, but wasn’t sure whether the stamps would actually work. So the very next morning, I bought a ream of postcards, wrote out messages to my friends, slapped a ‘Zeenat Aman’ stamp onto each, crossed my fingers, and dropped the cards into a postbox.”

She continues writing, “some weeks later, when I was back in Bombay, I began to receive texts and calls from my friends. All of whom were exclaiming with delight, having received my postcards in the mail!”

She concluded saying, “I suppose a limited number of these stamps were released and that they are out of print now. I’ve kept my few remaining sheets carefully though, since I really did feel honoured by this gesture."
