        "text": "Synopsis\n\nZeenat Aman recounted an incident where Feroz Khan docked her pay for being an hour late to the set, showcasing his suave demeanor.\n\nFardeen Khan, the son of the late Bollywood icon Feroz Khan, has candidly responded to veteran actress Zeenat Aman's recent Instagram post, reminiscing about her time working with the charismatic actor-director.\n\nZeenat Aman shared her experiences from the 70s, including an incident where Feroz Khan deducted her pay for arriving an hour late on the set of their film Qurbani.\n\nZeenat Aman initiated her post by acknowledging Feroz Khan's charisma, stating, \"I read somewhere that Oxford’s word for the year 2023 is 'rizz' - short for charisma. Well, if I’ve ever known anybody to have rizz, it was Feroz Khan.\"\n\nShe then delved into the initial challenges in their relationship, recounting a telephone conversation where she politely declined a secondary role offered by Feroz.\n\nDespite the rocky start, Feroz Khan later offered Zeenat the lead role in 'Qurbani'. She fondly shared a behind-the-scenes anecdote when Feroz \"docked\" her pay due to a one-hour delay caused by her youthful exuberance. She admitted, \"No argument, no scolding, but you can be sure that he docked my pay to pay the crew for that one-hour delay.\"\n\nFeroz Khan's son, Fardeen Khan, took to Instagram to respond to Zeenat Aman's revelations. He humorously quipped, \"Zeenat Aman aunty, if it's any consolation, family wasn't spared either. We just received the standard family discount of 25%. Khan Saab would have loved your post. He would have laughed out loud.\"\n\nFardeen Khan's Instagram Story\n\nFeroz Khan, often hailed as the \"Clint Eastwood of India,\" was a prominent figure in Bollywood, renowned for his style and contributions to over 60 films, both as an actor and director.\n\nHe passed away in 2009 after battling lung cancer. 'Qurbani', a film directed by Feroz Khan and featuring Zeenat Aman, remains a cherished project in their filmography. Released in 1980, the movie explored themes of friendship, betrayal, and revenge and achieved commercial success during its time.\n\nZeenat Aman, celebrated for her iconic roles in films like 'Roti Kapada Aur Makaan', 'Ajnabee', and 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram', continues to share her experiences from the golden era of Bollywood. As she gears up for her next project, 'Bun Tikki', fans eagerly anticipate more glimpses into the enchanting world of Indian cinema from this seasoned actress.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat’s India drinking?
