        "text": "Zeenat Aman, who has been very active lately on Instagram, is enjoying something of a second inning. The actress usually posts on the network her photos and amusing life stories. She wished Amitabh Bachchan a belated happy birthday today and told a tale about the one and only time she witnessed him show up late on a setT. Veteran actress Zeenat Aman posted a belated birthday greeting for Amitabh Bachchan on Instagram today, October 12. She penned: \"I missed wishing Mr. Bachchan on his birthday yesterday, so let me make up for it by telling a story about him that I mentioned previously. The story of the only time that I remember Mr. Bachchan being late to set. For reasons that will become clear - I’m not going to mention the name of the film we were shooting for, nor the year, nor the names of the director and producer involved.\"\n\nThe actress then recounted a scenario in which Big B showed up on a set during a morning shot an hour late. Aman left her beauty area and hurried over to meet him as soon as she learned of his arrival. But, the director of the movie yelled insults at her when he saw her, believing that she had slowed down the filming.\n\nShe then instructed her team to pack things as she returned to her makeup area through tears. \"Even as they zipped up my makeup kit, the lovely producer arrived at my door, followed closely by Mr. Bachchan. “Babs, I know it’s my fault. The man is a fool and he’s drunk. Let it go and let’s get to work,” he said. I accepted Mr. Bachchan’s apology of course but I was still stinging from the unwarranted dressing down I had received\", she added. She finally agreed to the shoot and the director literally \"threw himself\" on her feet, begging for forgiveness. Aman concluded that even though she finished the shoot, she never worked with the director again.\n\nZeenat Aman and Amitabh Bachchan have collaborated on movies including Don, Laawaris, Dostana, Mahaan, Pukar, and The Great Gambler among others."
