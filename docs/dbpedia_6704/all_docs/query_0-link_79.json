        "text": "Veteran actress Zeenat Aman has openly criticized brands for offering her significantly lower fees compared to other actors. In a candid Instagram post, she expressed her disappointment with the industry's treatment of established stars.\n\nZeenat Aman SLAMS brands of underpaying her compared to their “ambassadors”, hints at Priyanka Chopra\n\nA Call for Respect\n\nSharing a series of stunning photographs, Zeenat Aman detailed the various unprofessional practices she has encountered in the industry. From last-minute invitations to vague and impolite emails, the actress highlighted the lack of respect shown to her. However, the most stinging criticism was reserved for brands that offered her \"ludicrously low fees\" while paying exorbitant sums to other actors, including those who have reprised her iconic roles.\n\n\"I am over 70 years old, and I have held my own in this industry for over half a century,\" Aman wrote. \"I work with what I know to be an unusual professionalism. I have a social media audience that is not only entirely organic, but so beautifully engaged. I have immense respect for myself, and for you who follow my page. I am certainly worth more than the price of a designer handbag or high-heel shoe.\"\n\nSocial Media Speculation\n\nZeenat Aman's post quickly garnered attention on social media, with many fans and followers expressing their support for the actress. Speculation arose about the identity of the actor mentioned in the post, with many pointing to Priyanka Chopra, who has reprised Zeenat Aman's role in the Don franchise and is a brand ambassador for luxury brands.\n\nWhile Zeenat Aman did not explicitly name any names, her powerful message has sparked a conversation about fair compensation and respect for veteran actors.\n\nThe actress is currently gearing up for the release of her upcoming film, Bun Tikki, co-starring Shabana Azmi and Abhay Deol.\n\nAlso Read: Zeenat Aman shares a throwback video of epic BBC interview where she opens up about her ‘unshakeable “glamour-puss” tag’\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
