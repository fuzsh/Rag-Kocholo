        "text": "Rupa (Zeenat Aman) grew up being cursed as \"unlucky\" in her birth village. Her mother died during childbirth, then a kitchen accident leaves half her face disfigured. This is an artistic exploration of beauty and disfigurement, society's values, and, more importantly how a girl, teenager, and bride was treated during the times. Rajeev (Shashi Kapoor), the stereotype male engineer, falls in love with Rupa, who has a divine singing voice and the unscarred left cheek. When he sees the scarred cheek after marriage, he heads off into a tizzy and continues nightly dalliance with his mistress--the beautiful cheek. Little does he realize that his wife and mistress are two faces of the same person.\n\nIn the background of the rise of the International Hare Krishna movement in the 1970s, is a Montreal-based family of the Jaiswals, consisting of mom, dad, son, Prashant, and daughter, Jasbir. Due to irreconciable differences between Mr and Mrs Jaiswal, they separate, leaving Jasbir with dad, and Prashant with his mom. Eventually Prashant and his mom travel to India, leaving father and daughter behind in Montreal. Mr. Jaiswal re-marries, and brings his new wife to live in his home. Years later, Prashant has grown up to be a pilot. He has received a letter from his dad that Jasbir, who had rebelled and left home, is now located in Kathmandu, Nepal, with a group of hippies. Prashant undertakes to find his sister and hopefully get her back to the family. When Prashant lands in Kathmandu he does not find Jasbir, but instead finds Janice, who is indeed his sister with a new name. Janice has no recollection of her childhood, and is always in the company of fellow-hippies. Prashant now needs to bring Jasbir back, but for that he will have to travel deep into the drug induced dark world of Janice."
