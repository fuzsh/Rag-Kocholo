        "text": "Over the past year, she has shared unseen pictures and interesting stories about her journey.\n\nThe image captured Zeenat dressed in a black top that she paired with a stylish black and golden shrug.\n\nFor glam, she opted for minimal makeup, golden earrings and a necklace and pair of shades.\n\nThe actor struck stylish poses.\n\nThe note read, “People presume that transformative experiences are the prerogative of the young. My experience tells me otherwise.”\n\nShe revealed how her children encouraged her to join Instagram, “365 days ago, my kids cajoled me into uploading my first Instagram post. That little leap of faith forced me to confront my deep tech trepidations and even deeper need for privacy. Then it gifted me a transformative year.”\n\nZeenat also expressed gratitude to her team and children who assisted her with Instagram.\n\nShe added, “Oh, and what kids they are. If you wonder how I navigate Instagram or know the latest lingo, the answer lies with my informal little band of millennials. There is lovely, gentle @tanya.agarwall_ who photographs me with ease, thoughtful @_pratikshanair_ who makes up my face exactly as I like, and quiet @makeupnhairbyankita who fixes my hair. Then there are @zanuski and @carapiranha, who have held my hand every step of the way.”\n\nThe note ended, “So, here’s a thought from this septuagenarian — transformations demand that we embrace the unknown. And there’s really no age limit to when you can transform your life. Happy one year anniversary to you and I. Please eat a slice of cake on my behalf today. P. S: just like my first post, this one too was shot in my garden by @tanya.agarwall_ just yesterday. The clothes are from my closet, and I did my own hair and makeup of course.”\n\nAs soon as the post was uploaded, fans flooded the comment section.\n\nOne of the users wrote, “Thank you for your grace on a platform that can be vituperative.”\n\nAnother user commented, “This post and you on Instagram is more transformative for us.”\n\nRecently, Zeenat Aman also marked a significant milestone on Instagram by sharing her 100th post.\n\nZeenat Aman became a household name during the 70s and 80s after bagging the title Miss Asia Pacific International pageant in 1970, is known for her bold personality and was one of the actors who set the fashion trend with her satirical choices."
