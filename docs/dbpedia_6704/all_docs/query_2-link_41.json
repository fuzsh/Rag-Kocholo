        "text": "Zeenat Aman shared a lengthy post on Instagram and remembered singer Nazia Hassan as she celebrated 44 years of the iconic film ‘Qurbani.’ Muniza sang the popular peppy track ‘Aap Jaisa Koi’ in the film which became a rage among the fans.\n\nOn the joyous milestone of the film, the veteran actor gave a detailed account of how she met Nazia and introduced her to Feroz Khan which resulted in her being selected to sing the song in the classic film. While sharing the story, the actor explained that she met Muniza in London at her hotel where she visited Zeenat with her kids Nazia and Zoheb.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“The lady was elegant. Her name was Muniza. And with her were her two teenage children. A quiet girl named Nazia and a boy named Zoheb. I hadn’t planned to entertain them for long but soon found myself drawn into deep dialogue with Muniza. They were a charming and cultured family of Pakistani origin, and to my surprise I found myself inviting them to join me in my suite. That night I learned that Nazia and Zoheb were pursuing music, and I even enjoyed a brief demo of young Nazia’s pipes,” she wrote.\n\nThe iconic actor further wrote that after chatting with Nazia, she was drawn to her charm and later she introduced her to Feroz Khan.\n\n“I subsequently introduced her to Feroz Khan, with whom I was starting work on an ambitious project. You can picture the restâæ Feroz was blown away by Nazia’s voice, and under the guidance of music composer Biddu, 15-year-old Nazia Hassan went on to record the mega-hit ‘Aap Jaisa Koi,’” she added.\n\nTowards the end of the beautiful note, Zeenat recalled sweet memories with Muniza and how she left the world early. “I always felt protective of Nazia, and during film events and promotions, I kept a close eye on her, much to the chagrin of her admirers and delight of her mother. Nazia died too young. A true shooting star who blazed hot, bright and fast. On this occasion, I remember her with love and gratitude,” she concluded.\n\n‘Qurbani’ starred an ensemble cast including Feroz Khan, Vinod Khanna, Zeenat Aman, Amjad Khan, Shakti Kapoor, Aruna Irani, Amrish Puri and Kader Khan in key roles."
