        "text": "Mumbai: Veteran actor Zeenat Aman talked about her bond with ‘Bobby’ fame Dimple Kapadia and recalled that she supported her during a difficult phase of her life.\n\nTaking to her Instagram handle, she shared a throwback picture with Kapadia and director Joy Mukherjee from the sets of her film.\n\nShe wrote in the caption, “I can’t recollect where this picture was taken, but it quite certainly had something to do with the film Chhailla Babu. Perhaps it’s a bts shot from set. I say this because while the chairs scream “production”, I’m in my own clothes not a costume. With me are the director of the film Joy Mukherjee and the effervescent Dimple Kapadia, who must have been visiting set as she was married to the lead actor.”\n\nRecalling how they both got “big career breaks”, she added, “Dimple and I both got big career breaks thanks to Raj Kapoor. She as a teenager, when she was cast in and as Bobby. Whereas I was able to deliver a blow to my “western image” thanks to SSS.”\n\nThe ‘Ajanabee’ actor recalled how Dimple Kapadia supported her during the difficult time and mentioned, “This isn’t a post about Dimple’s talent though she has that in spades, it’s about the little I saw of her character. During a very difficult phase in my life she was one of a mere handful of people who publicly stood by me.”\n\n“This despite the criticism and scrutiny of her own life that the decision invited! In those trying times she revealed to me a strength of character that I admire to date. I don’t believe she is on Instagram, but perhaps @twinklerkhanna will pass on my love to her. Truly, a wave of appreciation washed over me when I found this picture some days ago,” she added.\n\nTalking about Zeenat Aman’s work front, she became a household name during the 70s and 80s after bagging the title Miss Asia Pacific International pageant in 1970. She is known for her bold personality, and was one of the actors who set the fashion trend with her satirical choices.\n\nZeenat has given several hits such as ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’, ‘Don’, ‘Yaadon ki Baraat’, ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’, ‘Qurbani, Dostana’, ‘Dharam Veer’, among others.\n\nActor Dimple Kapadia who made her acting debut as a teenager in the 1973 romantic movie ‘Bobby’ starring Rishi Kapoor, has acted in several successful films during her career, including Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi thriller ‘Tenet’.\n\nShe acted in a number of films and some of her notable works include ‘Saagar’, ‘Ram Lakhan’, and ‘Batwara’, ‘Rudaali’, among others."
