        "text": "In response to that, Feroz’s son, Fardeen Khan, took to Instagram stories and wrote, “@thezeenataman aunty, if it’s any consolation, family wasn’t spared either. We just received the standard family discount of 25 percent (smiling emoji). Khan Saab would have loved your post. He would have laughed out loud.”\n\nZeenat also reshared his story with a purple heart emoji.\n\n‘Qurbani’ was released in 1980. It was directed by Feroz Khan, who also acted in the film alongside Vinod Khanna, Zeenat Aman, Amjad Khan and others.\n\nThe movie revolves around two friends, Rajesh (played by Vinod Khanna) and Amar (played by Feroz Khan), who find themselves entangled in a web of crime and deceit.\n\nThe film explores themes of friendship, betrayal, and revenge, and it was a commercial success during its time.\n\nIn 1986, the south film ‘Viduthalai’ was released. It was a remake of the film Qurbani and starred Sivaji Ganesan, Rajinikanth and Vishnuvardhan and was directed by K Vijayan.\n\nZeenat made her Instagram debut in February. She keeps on sharing reflective thoughts on topics ranging from parenthood, the privacy of celebrities, dyeing hair and many more things.\n\nZeenat will be next seen in ‘Bun Tikki.’ Produced by Manish Malhotra, the film also star Shabana Azmi and Abhay Deol.\n\nThe famous actor has given several hits such as ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’, ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’, ‘Qurbaani’, ‘Dhund’, ‘Don’, ‘Manoranjan’ and ‘Yaadon Ki Baarat’. She was known for playing unconventional roles in her era when many actors were reluctant to take on those roles. (ANI)"
