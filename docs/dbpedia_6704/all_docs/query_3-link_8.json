Her breakthrough came with the film Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971), in which her performance was praised, and she won the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for her performance. She next starred in the film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973), for which she received further recognition, and established herself as a leading actress in the seventies with starring roles in Roti Kapada Aur Makaan (1974), Ajanabee (1974), Warrant (1975), Chori Mera Kaam (1975), Dharam Veer (1977), Chhailla Babu (1977), Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977), and The Great Gambler (1979), all of which were successful.
