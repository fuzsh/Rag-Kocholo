        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn his autobiography, Anand had written about falling in love with Aman.\n\nVeteran actress Zeenat Aman on Friday refuted claims made by late actor Dev Anand, calling them completely wrong. The 71-year-old actress was referring to Anand's claim that she had an inter-personal relationship with co-star Raj Kapoor, cinema icon of that era.\n\nAt the ABP Ideas Of India 2023 summit, Aman said Anand might have tweaked certain things in his autobiography about her and Kapoor's relationship.\n\n\"With all due respect, at times while we are narrating an incident or an anecdote, we put some bits to make it interesting. I don't know what Dev sahab's perspective was but whatever was his perspective, it was completely wrong.\n\nIn his autobiography 'Romancing with Life' (2007), Anand had written about how he fell in love with Aman after they co-starred in the 1971 movie 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna' but then Kapoor, who had offered her 'Satyam Shivam Sunderam', had grown close to her.\n\n\"Now, I will write about this in my book (autobiography). I admire Dev sahab, I respect him but this was not correct,\" the 71-year-old actor said.\n\nAman said the reason to meet the late legendary Raj Kapoor was because he had signed her for 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram'.\n\n\"I would meet him as his about to be heroine. We never had any inter personal relationship ever, nor during that time, or before or after, never. He was passionate about his work. I was passionate about my work.\n\n\"Also, he never asked me, 'why you didn't wear white?'. Whenever I meet him, be it on a set or at a function, and you can see the old photographs as well, I have never worn white when I met him,\" she added.\n\nAsha Parekh, who too was present at the Summit said, she is hoping Aman, who is a great writer, would pen down her autobiography soon. The two seasoned actors also spoke about marriage.\n\nParekh said she is happy that she did not get married.\n\n\"Marriages are made in heaven. If it has to happen, it will but if it is not meant to happen, it will not happen. Maybe it was not written in my destiny and I think I am very happy it didn't happen., I think you all will agree with it.\"\n\nAman said it is tough for a woman, especially a female actor in the industry to have a successful married life. She also said women stars often make a lot of sacrifices for their personal life.\n\n\"It is better not to be married than to have a bad marriage. And many people would not know that an actor works very hard to make their marriage work.\n\n\"These girls (referring to married actresses) make so many sacrifices, people who are not in the limelight may not do it. They get married because they want to be married. I know quite a lot of girls put up with a lot of things that most girls would not put up,\" she said.\n\nZeenat was earlier married to actor Sanjay Khan, and then she tied the knot with actor Mazhar Khan, who died in 1998.\n\nMeanwhile, the evergreen dive recently made a splash with her Instagram debut, which led to speculations that Aman was making a comeback to films.\n\nHowever, the actress soon debunked all rumours.\n\nAman took to Instagram to clarify that her presence on social media is because she is all set to make a return to the silver screen. She said that she is not planning a comeback, but neither is she closing that door.\n\n\" I am a notoriously private person, and I suppose this sudden sharing has set tongues wagging. The truth is that I have been in the public eye since I was 16-years-old, and have experienced the perils of being misquoted, taken out of context, censored, and gossiped about. Now as a septuagenarian I am enjoying the opportunity to reflect on my life and career in my own words. That too without any pressures from managers or studios or brands,\" Aman wrote alongside a picture of her.\n\nThe 71-year-old shared that \"Creativity does not retire.\"\n\n\" .. and I would love to sink my teeth into a nuanced and impactful character. I’m of course quite aware that such roles for older women are few and far apart,\" she added.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat’s India drinking?
