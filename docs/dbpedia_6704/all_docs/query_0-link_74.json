        "text": "Zeenat Aman has left her fans surprised with her latest appearance in an advertisement for fintech firm CRED. The veteran actress featured in the ad for the launch of RuPay on credit cards on CRED. The veteran Bollywood actress brought in her signature charm and wit to the ad, giving the video a hilarious spin.\n\nThe ad shows Zeenat Aman dressed in a glamorous ensemble, giving a monologue about finding oneself. The tongue-in-cheek humour of the promo shows Zeenat Aman forgetting her lines and giving life advice with a deadpan expression. The actress is seen in her graceful and unapologetic self in the ad.\n\nWhat Zeenat Aman said on the CRED ad\n\nSharing the clip on her Instagram handle, Zeenat Aman confessed that she had always been a fan of CRED’s unique ads, be it India coach Rahul Dravid losing his temper or Madhuri Dixit getting annoyed for failing an audition. The Hare Rama Hare Krishna star added that she was excited to play an existentialist.\n\n“Life has thrown some curve balls my way and I confess I’ve had moments of existentialism. But I think this is the first time that I’ve got to play an existentialist on camera,” she wrote.\n\nZeenat Aman added, “For now, I’ll say this - CRED is just 4-years-old, I’m in my 70s. But grabbing eyeballs with ease? Perhaps that’s something we have in common.”\n\nZeenat Aman’s CRED ad goes viral\n\nMany of her fans were left impressed by Zeenat Aman’s new ad and praised her look. Others lauded her for breaking stereotypes. The ad has garnered over 1.4 million views in a day.\n\nApart from Zeenat Aman, there was another reason the commercial grabbed attention. It was none other than actor Imran Khan. The Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na star replied to a comment under Zeenat Aman’s ad, sparking rumours about his comeback to the industry. Imran has not acted in any film since the 2015 rom-com Katti Batti.\n\nA user had commented, “Zeenat Ji ne bhi comeback karlia, patani mera @imrankhan kab karega (Zeenat Aman has also made her comeback, when will Imran Khan do so?”. To everyone’s surprise, the actor replied, “Chalo Aditi, let's leave this to the internet… 1M likes, and I'll make it happen.”\n\nHow fans reacted to Imran Khan's comment\n\nFans started liking Imran Khan’s reply and it soon crossed the one-million mark. While some speculated that the actor was part of CRED’s campaign due, others were surprised at the coincidence Imran Khan replying to a user named Aditi. In his debut, the actor was paired opposite Genelia D’Souza (who was named Aditi). A song picturised on the duo, Kabhi Kabhi Aditi, gained a lot of popularity in 2008.\n\nCRED’s viral ads\n\nCRED has gained popularity for its unique ads, which feature celebrities in hilarious situations. Kapil Dev, Madhuri Dixit, Ravi Shastri, and Neeraj Chopra are some of the stars to have appeared in the company’s promos."
