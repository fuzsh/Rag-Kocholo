        "text": "Mukesh on live-in\n\nAfter Mumtaz and Saira Banu recently spoke out against the idea of a live-in relationship, Mukesh hit back at Zeenat’s statement, saying, “Live-in relationships are not recognised in our culture and history. It has come from Western civilisation. Whatever Zeenat Aman is talking about, she has lived her life according to Western civilisation. It is not acceptable for a boy and girl to know each other through marriage, if they live together as husband and wife, imagine what happens to them. Those saying such things should speak thoughtfully.”\n\nTaylor Swift is everywhere you look right now. Wonder what's the big deal about her? Read our special story, a primer on everything Swift\n\nWhat Zeenat said\n\nIn a recent Instagram post, Zeenat shared her personal opinion that couples should live together before marriage. “This is the same advice I’ve always given my sons, both of whom have had, or are in, a live-in relationship. It just seems logical to me that before two people get their families and the government involved in their equation, they first put their relationship to the ultimate test,” she wrote.\n\nShe also added, “It’s easy to be the best version of yourself for a few hours a day. But can you share a bathroom? Weather the storm of a bad mood? Agree on what to eat for dinner every night? Keep the fire alive in the bedroom? Work through the million tiny conflicts that inevitably arise between two people in close proximity?”\n\nZeenat stated that couples shouldn’t care what society says because, “I’m aware that Indian society is a little uptight about ‘living in sin’ but then again, society is uptight about so many things! Log kya kahenge (what will people say).”\n\nUpcoming work"
