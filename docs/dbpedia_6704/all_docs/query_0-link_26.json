        "meta_description": "Zeenat Aman recently went down memory lane and opened up about the struggles of parenthood. Taking to her Instagram handle, the veteran actress shared a series of throwback photos from her family vacation to Mauritius in 1995. While one photo showed her sitting by a resort's poolside with her sons Azaan and Zahaan, another snap featured the 'Don' actress walking off the stage at an event. Sharing these rare pictures, the actress recalled a funny incident when her younger son Zahaan embarrassed her. She revealed that Azaan got an ear infection during the vacation, and she took him to see the doctor while making Zahaan sit in the waiting room. She penned a note saying, 'Azaan picked up an ear infection. I left Zahaan seated in the waiting room with a colouring book to keep him busy while I accompanied Azaan to see the doctor.' However, upon her return, she was taken by surprise as Zahaan had painted the waiting room's wall with the clinic's stamp. 'When we re-entered the waiting room, Zahaan had taken it upon himself to do a little redecorating. He had discovered the clinic’s stamp and an ink pad on the vacant receptionist’s desk and proceeded to furiously stamp the spotless walls of the waiting room, covering them in the smudged violet logo of the clinic,' wrote the actress. She concluded the incident by adding, 'I was horrified, but Zahaan was beaming. Not for long though. The scamp got an earful, and the doctor got my profuse apologies and an offer to pay for the damages.' For more news and updates, stay tuned to ETimes.",
