        "text": "A few days back Zeenat Aman shared relationship advice recommending people to live together before getting married.\n\nThis didn’t go down well with her colleague and veteran actress Mumtaz who criticised Zeenat and called her marriage a “living hell”.\n\nNow, Zeenat was asked about her response to Mumtaz’s jibe, the Qurbani actress stated that she has never tore down her colleagues and won’t be doing that now either.\n\nThe legendary actress told Hindustan Times, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I’ve never been one to comment on others' personal lives or tear down my colleagues, and I’m not going to start now.”\n\nWhat Zeenat Aman had advised\n\nA few days back, Zeenat had taken to Instagram and stated, “One of you asked me about relationship advice in the comments section of my last post. Here’s a personal opinion I haven’t previously shared - if you’re in a relationship, I strongly recommend that you LIVE TOGETHER before getting married!”\n\nMumtaz’s jibe"
