        "text": "Zeenat talks about Lily\n\nSharing the pictures, Zeenat captioned the post, \"Two birds, one post! First, by popular demand, here’s my madcap Lily having a caper in the garden this afternoon. Lily is a good ole desi dog rescued from the streets of Bombay. She is my darling shadow, and the reason that I am a firm advocate of pet rescue and adoption.\"\n\nZeenat gives advice on relationship\n\nShe said, \"On a different note, one of you asked me about relationship advice in the comments section of my last post. Here’s a personal opinion I haven’t previously shared - if you’re in a relationship, I strongly recommend that you LIVE TOGETHER before getting married!\"\n\nZeenat asked her sons to be in live-in relationships\n\nZeenat added, “This is the same advice I’ve always given my sons, both of whom have had, or are in, a live-in relationship. It just seems logical to me that before two people get their families and the government involved in their equation, they first put their relationship to the ultimate test.”\n\n\"The actor also said, “It’s easy to be the best version of yourself for a few hours a day. But can you share a bathroom? Weather the storm of a bad mood? Agree on what to eat for dinner every night? Keep the fire alive in the bedroom? Work through the million tiny conflicts that inevitably arise between two people in close proximity?”\n\nZeenat talks about ‘living in sin’\n\n“In short - are you actually compatible? I’m aware that Indian society is a little uptight about ‘living in sin’ but then again, society is uptight about so many things! Log kya kahenge (What will people say)?” concluded Zeenat.\n\nAbout Zeenat's projects\n\nFans will see Zeenat in Bun Tikki alongside Shabana Azmi and Abhay Deol. The release date of the film is yet to be announced.\n\nZeenat became a household name during the ‘70s and ’80s after bagging the title Miss Asia Pacific International pageant in 1970. She has given several hits, such as Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Don, Yaadon ki Baraat, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Qurbani, Dostana, and Dharam Veer among others."
