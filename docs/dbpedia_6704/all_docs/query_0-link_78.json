        "text": "By: Mohnish Singh\n\nWhile many star-kids choose to take their star parents’ legacy forward by appearing in front of the camera, evergreen actress Zeenat Aman’s son Zahaan Khan has decided to stay behind the camera. Choosing a different path for himself, Zahaan is set to make his debut in the industry as a music composer.\n\nActor-filmmaker Kapil Kaustubh Sharma launches Zahaan Khan in his upcoming film Dunno Y: Love Is Love. Interestingly, the previous two instalments of the film had Zeenat Aman playing important roles. Carrying on the long-term working association with the Sharma family, the diva returns to essay yet another strong character in Dunno Y: Love Is Love. For the unversed, Zeenat has worked with Kapil’s father K.C. Sharma in the 90s.\n\nBesides Zeenat Aman, Dunno Y: Love Is Love features several well-known actors on its ensemble cast including Kitu Gidwani, Mona Ambegaonkar, Zareena Wahab, Yuvraaj Parashar and Sahajahan. A small glimpse of this film was recently screened at Kashish Film Festival.\n\nWhen asked about working with newcomer Zahaan, Kapil Kaustubh Sharma said, “Zahaan is a great composer and has a bright future in Bollywood. It was a good experience working with him and I wish him all the very best for all his future projects.”\n\nTalking about his compositions in the film, Zahaan said, “For this project, I have created a few professional and personal compositions. My main inspiration behind these creations is music that I explore from across the world…I hope that the audience can connect with these songs”."
