        "text": "Aman said that she has a condition known as ptosis - the result of an injury she suffered many decades ago that damaged the muscles around my right eye. Over the years, it caused her eyelid to droop further and further. Few years ago it became so acute that it began to obstruct her vision. So what exactly is this Ptosis?\n\nPtosis is a condition characterised by the drooping or falling of the upper eyelid. The droop may be barely noticeable, or the lid can descend over the entire pupil. Other names for the condition are blepharoptosis, upper eyelid ptosis or droopy eyelid.\n\nIn some cases, ptosis can restrict and even block normal vision. It can be present in one or both eyes, be congenital (present at birth), or occur later in life. This condition can be the result of aging, a congenital weakness, muscle disease, trauma or neurological disorder.\n\nThe treatment for ptosis depends on its severity and the underlying cause.\n\nIf the ptosis is not severe and does not affect vision, your doctor might recommend an observation approach. Some mild cases can be treated with specific eyelid exercises that strengthen the levator muscle, which lifts the eyelid.\n\nMore severe ptosis requires surgical intervention to tighten the muscle that lifts the eyelid or to suspend the eyelid from the forehead muscles. In children, surgery is often recommended to prevent the development of lazy eye. The type of surgery performed depends on the severity of the ptosis and the strength of the levator muscle.\n\nIf you suspect that you or someone else may have ptosis, especially if it affects vision, it's important to consult with a GP or an ophthalmologist for an appropriate diagnosis and to discuss potential treatment options."
