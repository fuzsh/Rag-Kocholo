        "text": "Veteran actress Zeenat Aman, who recently joined Instagram, has been open and candid on the platform. Amidst her interactions, she expressed the harsh impact of 'scandalous' headlines on her during the late 1970s and 1980s, causing feelings of anxiety and grief.\n\nZEENAT AMAN'S INSTAGRAM POST\n\nIn her latest post, she took a trip down memory lane, sharing the misconstructed images the headlines presented about her. \"In 1979, headlines claimed I'd cursed myself; in 1982, that I was being targeted; in 1984, that I was out of sync; in 1985, on the brink of self destruction; and, in 1998, that I was shattered,\", she expressed. She shared the adverse effects these headlines had on her, leading to public humiliation and personal turmoil.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“The headlines would be adulatory one day and vicious the very next. There was little by way of fact checking, and no remorse for errors made. When they got the story right - it was usually a colossal breach of privacy. When they got it wrong - those blatant lies would be taken as the gospel. These “scandals” took their toll. It was its own form of public humiliation, and I remember the anxiety, outrage and grief that came with these,” she shared.\n\nADVICE TO EVERYONE\n\nShe also recounted a confrontation with an editor over a false story where she was met with excuses, but no apology. Aman shared the moment her skin thickened and she resolved not to take these narratives personally. \"Their primary interest was in selling their magazines,” the actress noted.\n\nAman concluded her statement by advising her followers not to allow others' opinions or perceptions to influence their lives. “ “All this is just to say - people will always find reason to talk, and so it’s probably best not to allow their opinion or perception to define your life. You can do that for yourself,” she noted.\n\nOn the work front, Zeenat Aman will be making a comeback with the Manish Malhotra-produced film 'Bun Tikki'."
