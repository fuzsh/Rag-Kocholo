        "text": "“At first I wondered if it was all too ‘edgy’ for me. But as I put it on—stacking bangles, wearing sunglasses, slipping on rings, clasping pendants—I remembered my own edge and revelled in it,” says Zeenat Aman. While she may have taken a hiatus from big-screen lead roles, the ageless Bollywood icon has surprisingly become the fashion darling of the internet. She’s walked the runway, and now she is releasing her very first designer collaboration with jewellery brand Misho.\n\n“I took my time to agree to this collaboration, but once Suhani started painting a picture for me and sharing her inspirations, designs and concept—I was sold,” explains Aman. For the style set’s accessory needs, the jewellery label Misho has been on the tip of tongues to fulfil their every need for a while now. Red carpet? Check. Your everyday selection to layer with office shirts? They’ve got it. Misho has diversified its repertoire as a jewellery brand that brings a flattering package consisting of everything from skilled metallurgy informed by the country’s traditional jewellery legacy to your newest fun and squiggly kind of odd bits.\n\nAlthough the brand is most known for its wearable everyday pieces, designer Suhani Parekh has constantly sought to explore the myriad ways in which jewellery can inform other directions of fashion. The avant-garde and the utilitarian. From sculpting armours as body decoration to bringing to life a collection inspired by Araku Valley’s tribeswomen in a collaboration with Araku Coffee, there has been an interesting series of updates for the brand. Parekh’s newest project may just top all of the previous ones. And Zeenat Aman becomes the canvas for her newest creations, delicate keepsake lockets that can be worn as rings or suspended from your neck, the Memento, which holds room to add in pictures.\n\nZeenat Aman talks to Vogue on fashion, the internet, her newest collaboration with Misho and her relationship with jewellery:\n\nIt’s rare for us to see you partner and collaborate with brands, what was the decision behind doing it now?\n\nZeenat Aman: “I’ve only been on social media for two months, and I’ve been quite blunt about my take on brand collaborations. I don’t want to be a walking billboard. That’s not my purpose here. I intend to be discerning, and to choose brands that actually resonate with me and that I genuinely enjoy.”\n\nWhat is your relationship with Misho and Suhani?\n\nZA: “Up until a few weeks ago, it was non-existent! But once she reached out, I spent time scrolling through their Instagram, scanning the website, and reading the profiles on Suhani as a young entrepreneur. Then she sent across two Mementos for me to look at personally, and that clinched the deal for me. Her young, creative energy is matched by her vision for Misho and it was so beautifully evident during the shoot.”\n\nJewellery can be so personal, how do you wear yours?\n\nZA: “With great thought. I buy and keep my jewellery carefully; many of my pieces are decades old. I like experimenting with looks, but I seek pieces that will bring me joy for years. It’s not about a price tag as much as a quality over quantity philosophy.”\n\nThis locket that you’re launching with Misho is like a keepsake, how do you like to wear it? Whose picture would you put in it?\n\nZA: “It’s most definitely a keepsake. That’s what my sons are calling it. And they’ve snagged the pieces I modelled for the shoot as their own Memento of their mother. As for who I’d carry in my Momento, that’s personal to me!”\n\nZeenat, you’ve come back into the social scene with your Instagram, and your personal style is perhaps one of the big highlights here, can you talk to us about what you think of Indian fashion today?\n\nZA: “Fashion is ever evolving, and we cycle through and reinvent styles every few decades. Trends will come and go, but I’m of the school of thought that you should wear your clothes and jewellery, your clothes and jewellery shouldn’t wear you. So seeing more body confidence is what really excites me about current fashion. From a design perspective, I think there’s such a tsunami of creativity out there and it intrigues me.”\n\nSuhani Parekh on her newest project, the Memento:\n\nWhere did the idea for this collaboration come from? Why was Zeenat the perfect person to launch this locket with?\n\n“When I first rediscovered Zeenat via her recent debut on Instagram, I was immediately taken by her poignant and powerful words, stories and iconic imagery. I loved the way she was exploring and reflecting on her own memories and iconic moments. And while our pieces touch on more personal memories, Zeenat is the perfect muse and I loved the idea of retracing her iconic journey through the 70s. From her barrier-breaking work back in the day or her art of perceptive self-reflection on the gram, she is undeniably bold, elegant and full of substance— my ideal Misho woman.”\n\nCan you talk to us about this special locket, what was the idea behind creating this?\n\n“Misho's Mementos are all about capturing your most precious memories, loved ones and moments and having them etched forever, concealed in a piece you’d wear every day. Like photos, they are about capturing the fleeting moments of life - but they take a step back from the digital age - as we use intricate enamelling and etching techniques to create these 24k gold-plated pieces. For me, the pieces feel extremely poetic as they explore the transient nature of life and explore the concept of love, family, moments, memories and stories.”\n\nYou’ve explored and experimented with the language of how jewellery can become a piece of decoration for the body, there’s avant-garde pieces like the belly armour and breast plate, and there’s also a practical side explored with AirPods jewellery—where do you think lies the future of jewellery design today?\n\n“I feel like nothing is as transformative as a piece of jewellery and at MISHO we really explore jewellery through different facets, whether it's architecture for the body in our more bold and experimental pieces like the belly armour or a seamless integration into our digital lives through pieces like the Airpod earrings.\n\nWith our newest launch of 'Mementos' we've combined a centuries-old concept like a picture locket, detailed portraiture and a very contemporary etching technique— re-inventing classic everyday pieces and pushing the boundaries of the possibilities of jewellery from what it could look like, to it's functionality and beyond.”\n\nAlso read:\n\nZeenat Aman has always had a rebellious sense of style, and her Instagram is a reflection of it\n\nThe special story behind Misho and Araku coffee's new jewellery collaboration\n\nBest fashion Instagrams of the week: Trench coats on Zeenat Aman to Suhana Khan's beach dresses"
