        "text": "Zeenat Aman, one of the famous actresses of her times turns 69 today. Zeenat who started her career in modelling was known to be the symbol of elegance in the 70-80s. The evergreen actress carved a niche for herself in Bollywood with super hit movies like Yaadon Ki Baaraat, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Don, Bhopal Express and the list goes on. Let’s take a look at some of the lesser-known facts of the yesteryear diva-\n\nPhoto: A screengrab from Qurbani\n\nBorn in Mumbai, Zeenat Aman did her schooling in Panchgani and went to University of Southern California in Los Angeles for further studies. The glamour icon had a fleeting vocation as a journalist for Femina magazine before she put in her feet into filmland.\n\nPhoto: Twitter/FilmHistoryPic\n\nZeenat was merely 13-year-old when she lost her father Amanullah who was a scriptwriter in Bollywood. It was after his death she added ‘Aman’ to her name. Of Afghan descent, her father had his supporting scripts in films like Pakeezah and Mughal-E-Azam.\n\nPhoto: A screengrab from Qurbani\n\n‘Dum Maro Dum’ is quite a self-explanatory song and that’s exactly what we are talking about. The actress, along with Dev Anand introduced Hippie Culture in Bollywood and the song still continues to be an evergreen hit.\n\nPhoto: A scene from Dum Maro Dum song\n\nAlong with Hema Malini, Zeenat Aman was the highest-paid actress of Bollywood from 1976-80. Not a surprise! The actor never neglected to dazzle directors like Raj Kapoor whom she met with a ‘burnt look’ for Satyam Shivam Sundaram.\n\nPhoto: A screengrab from Dostana"
