        "text": "In the age of fleeting connections, situationships and more, finding true love is either a swipe away or beyond human reach. But on Valentine’s Day, veteran actor Zeenat Aman, known for her groundbreaking roles and social media presence, shared invaluable insights on relationships via Instagram in collaboration with dating app Bumble.\n\nThe actor, who has shattered glass ceilings multiple times with her flair and unapologetic fashion choices, imparted wisdom garnered from her own dating experiences through a heartfelt message. She not only opened up about her dating life but also revealed what it’s like to keep failing in love and continue loving anyway.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from her confessions:\n\nListen to loved ones\n\n“If your family opposes your relationship because of matters of caste, class, religion, gender or any other such divisive construct — challenge them! But if they dislike your partner for deeper reasons, hear them out,” Aman wrote. “I’m not saying they’re necessarily right. I’m saying that often our loved ones can grant us missing perspective. There’s certainly been an occasion or two where I wish I’d listened to my amma (mother)!”\n\nPreserve your sense of self\n\n“Preserve your sense of self against all odds. If your partner wants to entirely change you, they don’t love you. They love control. On that note, make sure you’re financially independent of them. A relationship should be a choice not a circumstance!” she continued.\n\nDo not become complacent in love\n\nAman also said that all relationships require effort and vigilance to thrive. She warned against complacency, urging couples to continually evolve and improve themselves. Love, she emphasised, is not owed but earned through mutual growth and commitment. “All relationships are work. It’s easy to become the worst version of yourself once you grow too comfortable in your partnership. So be vigilant! Your partner does not owe you love. More importantly, you owe it to yourself and the relationship to evolve year on year!”\n\nDo not compromise on intimacy and financial stability\n\nThe Don actor highlighted that one must not negate the importance of intimacy and financial stability; compatibility in those aspects is indispensable. “In the long run — great sex, a stacked bank account and sweet talk are meaningless if you can’t enjoy the mundane together. Which is not to say that sex and finances are unimportant. Compatibility on those fronts are essential too!”\n\nLast but not the least, date yourself\n\nOn a parting note, she shared, “Bumble, these days I’m dating myself. I do for me all the things that a loving, long-term partner would, but without the irritation of having to deal with another human’s flatulence and snores. Which brings me to my final realisation – in love, there are no givens! And if you can’t find a person to love you as you deserve, then it should be enough to love yourself.”\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of modern romance, Aman’s confessions serve as a beacon of wisdom, guiding us towards relationships built on a foundation of love, respect, and self-discovery. They’re also a fun lesson for celebrities who partner with brands — if you’re doing it, do it like Zeenat Aman!"
