        "text": "Zeenat Aman (born 19 November 1951) is an Indian actress, model and beauty queen best known for her work in Hindi films during the 1970s and 80s. She won the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 title. She is the first South Asian woman to win the title. Upon making her debut in Bollywood, Zeenat Aman, along with Parveen Babi, was credited with making a lasting impact on the image of its leading actresses by introducing the modern look to Hindi cinema. Regarded as path breaker of Indian cinema. She opened the new door for all the other actresses and being an inspiration for so many other heroines. She created her own identity by playing the distinguish roles.This section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources. Please help by adding reliable sources.

Her father, Amanullah Khan, was related to the Bhopal State ruling family. He was a script writer for such movies as Mughal-e-Azam and Pakeezah. Amanullah Khan often wrote under the nom de plume \"Aman\", which she later adopted as her second name on screen. He died when Aman was 13. Her mother married a German man called Heinz. Zeenat Aman's mother's name is Scinda (Vardhini Karvaste a Maharashtrian) Heinz. Aman's mother obtained German citizenship. She is the cousin of actor Raza Murad and niece of actor Murad.She did her schooling in Panchgani and went to University of Southern California in Los Angeles for further studies on student aid, but she could not complete her graduation. Upon her return to India, she first took up a job as a journalist for Femina and then moved on to modeling. One of the first few brands that she modeled for was Taj Mahal Tea in 1966. She was the second runner-up in the Miss India Contest and went on to win the Miss Asia Pacific in 1970. After having studied in Los Angeles, winning the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 contest and a successful modeling career, Aman's film career began with a small role in O.P. Ralhan's Hulchul in 1971. She had a second role in Hungama (1971), starring singer Kishore Kumar, but both films were unsuccessful and she was ready to pack her bags to leave India and was ready to go to Malta with her mother and stepfather. Dev Anand offered Zaheeda (his second heroine in Prem Pujari) the role of his sister in Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971). Not realizing the importance of this secondary role, Zaheeda wanted the lead female part (eventually played by Mumtaz) and she opted out. Zeenat Aman was chosen as a last-minute replacement. In Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Zeenat Aman, aided by the R. D. Burman song Dum Maro Dum, won over the hearts of the audience as Janice. She earned a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and BFJA Award for Best Actress.Throughout the 1970s, the Dev-Zeenat pairing was seen in half a dozen films; Heera Panna (1973), Ishq Ishq Ishq (1974), Prem Shastra (1974), Warrant (1975), Darling Darling (1977) and Kalabaaz (1977). Of these, Warrant, was the biggest box office success. Her hip looks in Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973) as the girl carrying a guitar, singing Churaliya hai tumne jo dil ko (in Asha Bhosle's voice) has won her more popularity and the hearts of millions of fans. She appeared on every Hindi film magazine's cover during the 1970s. In December 1974, Cine Blitz magazine was launched with Zeenat Aman on its cover, a testimony to her popularity at the time.\n\nFor more information press the link below:"
