        "text": "Kuniaki Koiso and the Inescapable Slide Toward Defeat\n\nImperial Army officer Kuniaki Koiso became prime minister well after Japan’s position in the Pacific War had already become hopeless. It took him months to reach this understanding personally, and when he ultimately came to realize that his own ability to command the situation was also close to zero, he stepped down.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nHideki Tojo and the Option for Total War\n\nImperial Army leader Hideki Tojo commanded the nation from 1941-1944. Once he decided to launch a total war against the Anglo-American Powers in December 1941, his own authority was tied to the success or failure on the battlefield.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nFumimaro Konoe and the Southern Advance\n\nWhen Fumimaro Konoe returned to the premiership in mid-1940, he launched a bolder package of policy initiatives, including the declaration of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the creation of a one-party state.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nMitsumasa Yonai and the Fading Prospects for Peace\n\nIn early 1940, moderate Navy Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai was selected by Emperor Hirohito in a final effort to head off military conflict with the Anglo-American powers. However, Nazi Germany’s rapid defeat of France soon undermined Yonai’s authority by convincing Japanese militarists that the nation was losing a historic opportunity for changing the international order.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nNobuyuki Abe and the European Conflict\n\nFor a short period in 1939-1940, little-known Imperial Army General Nobuyuki Abe took over leadership of the nation just as World War II broke out in Europe. Abe kept Japan out of the war but was unable to establish a firm political foundation for his government.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nKiichiro Hiranuma and the Three Foreign Policy Shocks\n\nIn 1939, rightwing ideologue Kiichiro Hiranuma came to power, but he refrained from attempting to institute any major policy changes. However, he soon presided over a series of disasters, each of which clearly indicated that Japan’s military-led foreign policy had miscalculated fundamental realities.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nFumimaro Konoe and the China Quagmire\n\nFrom 1937-1939, the nation was led by rightwing aristocrat Fumimaro Konoe, regarded by many as a man of destiny who might lead the nation to a glorious future. Konoe, however, proved to be a rudderless leader and soon allowed himself to be dragged into an all-out confrontation with nationalist forces in China.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nSenjuro Hayashi and the Imperial Army’s False Start\n\nWith the selection in early 1937 of General Senjuro Hayashi to become prime minister, the Imperial Japanese Army was excited to have one of its own in charge of the nation for the first time in decades; but his first political moves alienated almost everyone and he was out within a few months.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nKoki Hirota and the Anti-Comintern Pact\n\nFrom 1936-1937, diplomat Koki Hirota was appointed prime minister. At this juncture, however, the office had become weaker than ever, and Hirota could do little more than be the public face of policies designed by the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nby Michael Penn\n\nKeisuke Okada and the Junior Officers’ Uprising\n\nFrom 1934-1936, Keisuke Okada became the second consecutive moderate admiral to serve as prime minister, though on a weaker political footing than his predecessor. Still, he managed to stay on top of the situation until Imperial Army radicalism led to a violent uprising by junior officers.\n\nby Michael Penn"
