After the April 1974 military coup he founded the Popular Democrat Party (Partido Popular Democrático) and was its minister without portfolio in the government of Adelino da Palma Carlos during the presidency of Gen. António de Spínola. Sá Carneiro later resigned in protest against the nationalization of heavy industry, banks, and insurance companies. After his Social Democratic Party (Partido Social Democrático; PSD) split in May 1979 on whether to support a Socialist budget, Sá Carneiro left the party and began negotiations with other groups further to the right with a view to forming a coalition to contest the upcoming general and municipal elections. The PSD, needing his charisma, later welcomed him back as leader, and in July the Aliança Democrática (AD) was formed, consisting of the PSD, the Centre Democrats (CDS), the small Monarchist group, and several others, and with Sá Carneiro and Diogo Freitas do Amaral (CDS) as joint leaders. The AD won 45.2% of the votes in the Dec. 2, 1979, elections and would hold a narrow overall majority with 128 seats in the 250-seat Assembly. Sá Carneiro became prime minister on Jan. 3, 1980.

In 1973-74 and from 1980 he was also prime minister. After a peace offer to Israel in 1971 was rejected, he launched, with Syria, a joint invasion of Israel in October 1973. The Egyptian army achieved a tactical surprise in its attack on the Israeli-held Sinai Peninsula, and, despite subsequent reverses, Sadat won great prestige as the first Arab leader to actually retake some territory from Israel. In 1977 he made a historic visit to Israel. Together with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1978; their continued negotiations resulted in the signing of a peace treaty on March 26, 1979.

Aug. 9, 1914, Buenos Aires), president of Argentina (1910-14); son of Luis Sáenz Peña. He was elected to parliament in 1876, at a time when Argentina's population and economy were rapidly expanding. In 1877 he resigned on account of political differences with the majority and joined the army in the war then going on with Chile. He was severely wounded and taken prisoner, but was released before the close of the war, returned home, and entered the diplomatic service. He held the office of foreign minister (1890) and served as Argentine delegate to the first International Conference of American States (Washington, D.C., 1889-90), where he opposed the U.S.-sponsored all-American customs union because of Argentina's economic ties to Europe. Later he was ambassador to Spain (1906-07) and to Italy (1907-10). With the opposition Radical Party abstaining, he was elected president in 1910 over Guillermo Udaondo. Regarding himself as nonpartisan, he responded to popular demand for electoral reform. Universal and compulsory male suffrage from age 18 by secret ballot was established (1912) by a statute that he compelled the oligarchy-dominated Congress to pass and that has since been known by his name. It placed Argentina in the vanguard of Latin American democracy. Intended in part to mollify the Radical Party, the reforms made possible the election of Radical leader Hipólito Irigoyen to the presidency in 1916. Sáenz Peña was a strong critic of what he considered the United States' attitude of arrogant superiority over Latin America as expressed by the Monroe Doctrine. He died in office.\n\nI.

The former (1981) Miss Universe served two widely-praised terms (1992-98) as mayor of Chacao, an upmarket district of Caracas. She reduced crime, corruption, and bureaucracy and won reelection in 1995 with 96% of the vote. On this basis she became the first of several independent presidential candidates to ride a wave of public discontent with traditional parties in 1998. She was the country's most popular political figure at the beginning of the year but began to fade in the polls after accepting the backing of the COPEI party in May. The party ditched her as its nominee in the last week of the campaign in favour of Henrique Salas, leaving her to continue as an independent. Sáez was respected for her strong convictions and popular touch, but critics labeled her a political lightweight who struggled with tough interviewers and was more concerned with image than policy. She plunged to a distant third place in the election. In March 1999, she staged a stunning comeback, winning the governorship of Nueva Esparta state, which includes Margarita Island, a leading tourist resort. Backed by a hodgepodge of political parties, Sáez won 70.8% of the vote compared with 28.9% for her closest rival, local businessman and car dealer Gregorio Boadas. In 2000, when new elections were held after the adoption of a new Venezuelan constitution, she did not run for reelection because she was pregnant.\n\nSáez Morales, Carlos (b.

He worked in various government departments in Brunei before becoming grand vizier (first minister) and member of the State Council (1947-50) during the sultanate of his elder brother. As sultan himself, he was less anxious than some of his subjects, and even than the British, that his country should move toward independence. However, he produced a written constitution in 1959, when the British relinquished control of Brunei's internal affairs. During a revolt that year, Saifuddin had no hesitation in calling in British troops to quell it. He refused to take Brunei into the Federation of Malaysia, which was formed in 1963.

Feb. 29, 2004, Bridgetown, Barbados), prime minister of Barbados (1985-86). A member of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) since 1959, he sat in the Senate from 1964 to 1966. Elected to the House of Assembly in 1966, he lost his seat in 1971 and returned to the Senate for five years. He was reelected to the House in 1976. He held the key portfolios of trade and tourism since 1976 and as deputy to Prime Minister J.M.G. Adams was the automatic successor when Adams died on March 11, 1985. He was immediately confronted with the task of negotiating a solution to the complex problems of intra-Caribbean Community trade and payments, which were adversely affecting the Barbadian economy. St. John quickly established himself as a blunt and forthright spokesman for his government's position. His threat at the beginning of September to take reprisals against Trinidad and Tobago if the latter did not implement the Nassau agreements on intraregional trade was followed by apparently constructive conversations with Trinidad Prime Minister George Chambers at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Nassau, The Bahamas, in October. Although St. John had no difficulty establishing himself as the undisputed leader of the BLP, there was some infighting within the party, which he sidestepped by declining to appoint a deputy prime minister. The party lost the 1986 general elections, but in 1994 it was reelected and he served as deputy prime minister until 1999. He retired from political life in 2003. He was knighted in November 1994, becoming known as Sir Harold, while he was earlier using his second given name, Bernard.\n\nSaint John, Sir (Henry) Beauchamp (b. Aug. 26, 1874 - d.

Aug. 31, 1916, Olathe, Kan.), governor of Kansas (1879-83). He served as a Republican in the state Senate in 1873-74. The son of an alcoholic, he was an early advocate of prohibition and on that issue was elected governor in 1878. In 1880 he secured, besides his own reelection, the popular approval of a prohibition amendment to the state constitution, the first such constitutional ban in history. As governor he inaugurated the first \"water banquets,\" and even for decades beyond his governorship, liquor was never served in the Kansas State House. When large numbers of ex-slaves emigrated to Kansas in 1879, St. John headed a Freedman's State Central Association to assist them. Denied a third term in 1882, he extended his campaign for prohibition to the national level and, in 1884, was nominated as the presidential candidate of the National Prohibition Party. For deserting the Republicans he was called a \"traitor\" and was burned in effigy more than 500 times. He was twice shot at but escaped unhurt. He won over 150,000 votes. He made his strongest effort in New York, and many thought that he drew sufficient votes away from Republican candidate James G. Blaine to tip the state - and with it the election - to Grover Cleveland. During 1912, he stumped Kansas for woman suffrage, and in 1914 - aged over 80 - he toured the East for prohibition.\n\nSaint John, Sir Oliver Beauchamp Coventry (b.

Mackenzie King's administration. As a member of the Liberal Party, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons from Quebec East on Feb. 9, 1942, and was reelected in all subsequent elections until his retirement. King appointed him secretary of state for external affairs (acting in 1945, regular on Sept. 4, 1946). On Dec. 10, 1946, he relinquished the portfolio of justice. He was deputy chairman of the Canadian delegation to the 1945 San Francisco conference that created the United Nations and served as leader of the delegations at the UN General Assembly sessions in London and New York City in 1946-47.

Dec. 7, 1849, Kyoto, Japan - d. Nov. 24, 1940, Okitsu, Shizuoka, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1906-08, 1911-12). The son of an imperial noble of the Tokudaiji family, he was adopted by the Saionji family in 1852. He nominally participated in the movement that led to the restoration of imperial rule in 1868, and in 1881 he founded the Toyo jiyu shimbun (\"Oriental Free Press\"), a newspaper dedicated to popularizing democratic ideas. But as journalism was considered a scandalous profession for a court noble, his colleagues prevailed on the emperor to force Saionji to join government service, and he came to hold many high governmental posts, including minister to Austria-Hungary (1885-87) and Germany (1887-91), minister of education (1894-96, 1898, 1906), foreign affairs (1895-96, 1896, 1906, 1906), and finance (1901), and president of the Privy Council (1900-03). He became one of the principal organizers, and, in 1903, president, of the Rikken Seiyukai (Friends of Constitutional Government), the major political party at that time. As prime minister he attempted to curtail military expenditures and pushed for party control of the cabinet. He removed himself from party politics and government office in 1912, but in 1919 headed Japan's delegation at the Versailles peace conference, which ended World War I. Saionji, who received the titles of marquess in 1884 and duke in 1922, spent his later years as a genro (\"elder statesman\"), an honour reserved for the exclusive group of leaders who, having participated in the Meiji Restoration and also held high government office, served in retirement as close and trusted advisers of the emperor. Because he tried to moderate the ultranationalistic and militaristic trends in pre-World War II Japan, right-wing fanatics in the 1930s frequently sought to assassinate him. He died as the last genro in 1940.\n\nSaisset (de Mars), Jean-Marie (Joseph Théodose) (b. Jan. 13, 1810, Paris, France - d. May 24, 1879, Paris), governor of the French Settlements in Oceania (1858) and commandant of New Caledonia (1859-60).\n\nSaito, Hiroshi (b.

He joined the navy in 1873, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1879, and in 1884 went for study to the United States, where he remained for some years as naval attaché to the Japanese legation. He became a commander in 1897 and a captain later that year and in 1898 was appointed vice-minister of the navy. He served in the Russo-Japanese War and was promoted rear admiral in 1900, vice admiral in 1904, and admiral in 1912. He served as navy minister in 1906-14. Becoming governor-general of Korea in 1919, he was met with hostility and several attempts were made on his life, but his conciliatory policy ultimately won him respect. In 1927 he went to Geneva as head of the Japanese delegation to the naval disarmament conference. Upon his return he resigned his Korean post and became privy councillor to the emperor. He served again as governor-general of Korea in 1929-31 and then was believed to have retired, but in 1932, on the assassination of Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai, the emperor commanded Saito to form a cabinet. He took the controversial steps of recognizing the Japanese-controlled state of Manchukuo (in Manchuria) and withdrawing from the League of Nations, but he also cut the army budget by one-third, much to the disgust of the reactionaries. Financial scandal forced Saito and his cabinet to resign in July 1934. In December 1935 he was appointed lord keeper of the privy seal. He was assassinated by a group of young army officers during the abortive military revolt of Feb. 26, 1936. He was created a baron in 1907 and a viscount in 1925.\n\nSaito, Motohiko (b.

A nuclear physicist and father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, he tried but failed to persuade Nikita Khrushchev to cancel atmospheric tests in the late 1950s and championed the 1963 U.S.-U.S.S.R. treaty banning nuclear tests. In 1968 the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia prompted him to circulate \"Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom,\" an essay highly critical of the increasing repression of Soviet dissidents. He refused to deny authorship and, though he lost top-level security clearance, he was allowed to remain a member of the Academy of Sciences and to keep his academy-assigned apartment and country house, car and driver, and a respectable job. In 1970 he and two other dissidents founded the Committee for Human Rights; in 1971 he was increasingly hounded for his outspokenness. He was awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize for Peace, but was not permitted to travel to Oslo, Norway, to receive it; his wife Yelena Bonner did, and she delivered his speech, characteristically in support of intellectual freedom. He waged an increasingly lonely battle that peaked in December 1979, when he urged other nations to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Moscow Olympics. In January 1980 he was stopped by Soviet security officers, told he was stripped of state honours, and exiled to Gorky, an industrial city. Two hunger strikes and occasional letters smuggled by Bonner kept Sakharov in the world's eye until Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev invited him to return to Moscow in December 1986.

Salam\n\nSalam, Saeb (Salim), Arabic Sa´ib (Salim) Salam (b. Jan. 17, 1905, Beirut, Lebanon - d. Jan. 21, 2000, Beirut), Lebanese politician. Salam, a Sunni Muslim, began his political career in 1943 and ended it in 1992, when his eldest son, Tammam, succeeded him in the Beirut parliamentary seat he had held for decades. He established Middle East Airlines in 1945 and soon was given his first cabinet position as interior minister (1946), a post he also held during his four times as prime minister (1952, 1953, 1960-61, 1970-73). In 1956, he was wounded during clashes between protesters and the army over Pres. Camille Chamoun's pro-Western policies and was placed under arrest in his hospital room. He staged a hunger strike for five days until he was released. In 1973 he quit after Pres. Suleiman Franjieh refused to dismiss army commander Gen. Iskandar Ghanem for neglect following an Israeli commando raid in Beirut that left three Palestinian guerrilla leaders dead. Salam was a moderate in a country whose politics have often been turbulent. He relentlessly advocated peaceful Muslim-Christian coexistence following the outbreak of Lebanon's ruinous 1975-90 civil war. \"One Lebanon, not two Lebanons,\" was one of his better known slogans during the civil war that claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people. He was one of a few Muslim Lebanese leaders who publicly supported a controversial peace accord signed by Lebanon and Israel in 1983 to secure an Israeli withdrawal from a border strip in southern Lebanon. The accord, which called for normalizing relations between Lebanon and Israel, collapsed under staunch opposition by most Muslim leaders and Syria, now the main power broker in Lebanon. He was the last surviving statesman who fought for Lebanon's independence from France.\n\nT. Salam\n\nSalam, Tammam (Saeb) (b.

In 1958 he was among those who called Charles de Gaulle to power, and under him became delegate-general, thus combining civil power with his military role.

He led a military insurrection in Algeria in April 1961 which collapsed after four days, then led the right-wing extremist Organisation de l'Armée Secrète (Secret Army Organization) in a campaign of terror - killing 2,360 people in Algeria and mounting a number of assassination attempts against de Gaulle - before being captured, tried for treason, and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1962, shortly before Algeria gained its independence.
