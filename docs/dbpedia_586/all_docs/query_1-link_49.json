        "text": "The Japanese were concerned by the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang. They had backed Manchuria's warlord, Zhang Zuolin, however, he became very powerful and attempted to expand into Northern China, which made him a target for Chiang's Northern Expedition. If Chiang Kai Shek was able to defeat Zhang, Japan's special interests in Manchuria could be hit hard.\n\nTherefore, the Japanese Government planned for its army in Manchuria, known as the Kwangtung Army, to disarm Zhang and force him to retreat back to Manchuria before Chiang was able to defeat him. However, some leaders of the Kwangtung decided to take harsher action.\n\nFirst, they forced the Northern Expedition to halt at Ji'nan.\n\nThen, they assassinated Zhang Zuolin. The assassins believed the effects of the assassination would give them an excuse to conquer Manchuria.\n\nThe Emperor instructed Prime Minister Tanaka to enforce discipline within the army. Despite this, the Generals ignored his requests as they believed that punishing those involved would weaken the army's reputation.\n\nIn July 1929, Prime Minister Tanaka was forced to resign due to the fact that he was unable to follow through with the wishes of the emperor.\n\nAs a result, as early as the summer of 1929, it was clear that the army had enough power to ignore the government and emperor without facing significant consequences."
