        "meta_description": "Komatsu Kiyoshi (1900-1962) has been mainly known as a specialist in French literature—in particular as the principal translator of Andre Malraux’ writings into Japanese—but his work as an activist in French Indochina during the Second World War and his close association with many significant figures in the Vietnamese political scene for four decades from the early 1920s have been largely neglected. This essay attempts to provide a coherent picture of Komatsu’s relationship with French Indochina as a rônin, a kind of activist à la mode japonaise. It first looks into the making of this fascinating individual from his early years in Kôbe, then it considers his connections with the Indochinese in Paris in the 1920s, and his exposure to Malraux’ writings and activism. It then tries to clarify why Komatsu wanted to go to French lndochina, and in what activities he was engaged there between 1941 and 1946. The conclusion offers an assessment of the significance of Kornatsu’s engagement with French Indochina in the context of modern Japan and Vietnam.",

        "text": "1The term tairiku rônin (lit., “wanderers, or adventurers, on the Continent”) has come to be used to designate a group of Japanese civilians who were active on the East Asian mainland, especially in China, from the late nineteenth century to the end of the Second World War. “They were people who carried on activities as private individuals to consolidate Japan’s position in Asia, and aspired to contribute to the shaping and execution of Japan’s foreign policy.” Their goals, however, were not necessarily limited to furthering narrowly Japanese interests. Although “the activities of these enthusiasts were varied, there were those among them who possessed political ideals”—mostly of a pan-Asianist character—“that could be either aggressive or amicable” (Okabe 1993: 603). Notable among the idealist tairiku rônin was Miyazaki Toten (1871-1922), a close associate of Sun Yat-sen, who worked passionately for the cause of the Chinese Revolution of 1911.\n\n3First, as background, I will look into the making of this fascinating French Indochina rônin, tracing his story back to his early years in Kôbe. I will then consider the connections that Komatsu had with the Indochinese in Paris, and his exposure to Andre Malraux’ writings and activism. This will be followed by a discussion of the reasons why Komatsu wanted to go to French Indochina and the activities that he was engaged in while he was there between 1941 and 1946. In the concluding part, I will present an assessment of the significance of Komatsu Kiyoshi’s engagement with French Indochina in the context of modern Japan and Vietnam.\n\nThe Making of an Adventurer (Rônin)\n\n4Komatsu was born in 1900 in Kôbe, Hyôgo Prefecture. Although he was brought up in this city, Komatsu nonetheless felt a strong attachment to Awajishima—a small island of some 593 square kilometers southeast of Hyôgo in the Inland Sea, where Komatsu’s parents and ancestors had been living for generations—such that he would consider himself, like them, a “product of Awajishima.” The natives of Awajishima, according to Komatsu, were highly realistic, on the one hand, yet, strangely, were romantic people by nature, on the other. Among the “numerous men out of ordinary” born on this tiny island, Komatsu’s favorites were Takataya Kahee (1769-1827) and Iwano Hornet (1873-1920), because both these men dreamed of the northern sea and were daring men of action, risking their lives in order to fulfill their “beautiful and grand dreams” a thousand miles away. While Komatsu himself admitted that he would be longing for Awajishima to the last days of his life and would hope that his bones would be buried somewhere on the island, he seems to have nourished a romantic and adventurous dream of a life in a foreign land since his youth (Komatsu 1941: 1-2).\n\n5After completing his primary school and advanced primary school (kôtô shôgakkô) in the old section of Hyôgo, Komatsu moved on to study at the Prefectural Commercial (Junior High) School located in the modern Kôbe city. The atmosphere in Kôbe was quite cosmopolitan. At the turn of the twentieth century, Kôbe was one of a few Japanese cities that boasted a large community of foreigners, whose presence was noticeable on the streets. During his first year at that school, Komatsu had an excellent native English teacher (a highly unusual fact for this level at the time), through whom he developed a serious interest in the English language. Thanks to this instructor and the private lessons that he took at the Kôbe YMCA, Komatsu was able to gain confidence in his spoken English. His progress in English must have been quite remarkable, judging from the fact that Komatsu was selected by his English teacher to play Shylock in Shakespear’s The Merchant of Venice in his second year and Iago in Othello in his third year. This is an early piece of evidence for Komatsu’s ability to respond to the fascination of foreign languages and cultures.\n\n6Aoki Shigeo, the biographer of Kornatsu’s early career and also his close friend during the postwar years, notes that “although Komatsu received the strict education of the government schools from his early childhood, for some reason, he did not have much of the feeling of ‘revering the Emperor’ (tennô sûhai). A number of explanations are offered by this biographer: “Perhaps it was partly because Komatsu grew up breathing the liberal atmosphere of port cities like Hyogo and Kôbe, partly because he felt more or less bitter on account of the distress that he suffered from the examinations that followed one after another, from primary school to advanced primary school and junior high school. Or perhaps because he was so fascinated with the study of the English language, and in the process he adopted a cosmopolitan outlook. He even liked to speak quite often of ‘iconoclasm’ (guzô hakai), a new term which began to gain popularity among the public around that time. Then, out of a rebellious spirit, he would at times secretly wonder ‘What is the Emperor?’’ It is worth adding, however, that although, at first glance, Komatsu might appear to have been exceptionally radical, his radicalism was understandable in the context of the Taisho era in which he grew up, when there was a great call for democracy and individual rights.\n\n8Komatsu’s family had been, since before his birth, running a rice business, quite successfully until the 1910s, during which there were two incidents that inflicted severe damage upon the family’s financial condition. First, a plague of mice struck his parents’ store in 1913. Then, five years later, while his family’s finances and morale had not yet recovered from this incident, the Rice Riots took place (summer of 1918). As Kornatsu’s family was still one of the biggest rice dealers in the Kôbe area, his home became a target for the rioters, who broke in and took the last grain of rice that they found in the containers. The loss that his family suffered was irreparable.\n\n9In the spring of 1919, Komatsu was admitted to the prestigious Prefectural Commercial Senior High School (now the University of Kôbe), in recognition of his linguistic gift, but by this time he had shifted his interest from commercial studies to literature. As a result, at the end of the first year, he failed his examinations. It was around this time that Komatsu began to write short stories and served as an editorial member of Ashiato (Footprints), a literary coterie magazine. It is believed that because of Kornatsu’s story “Hikari naki donzoko” (The Lower Depths Without Light), seen by the Security Police as too radical, Ashiato received a warning from the authorities and was discontinued shortly afterward. After some eighteen months at the Prefectural Commercial High School, Komatsu asked the Principal to permit him to leave the school, following a clash with his commercial accounting teacher, in which he declared to the class that “Commercial accounting is simply a tool for capitalist oppression!” (Komatsu 1954b: 45).\n\n10Aspiring to become a social activist, Komatsu went to Tôkyô, where he joined the Kensetsusha Dômei (League of Builders), a student socialist organization at Waseda University. For a year, he lived in the same dormitory with people who later played important roles in the socialist movement in Japan, such as Asanuma Inejiro (1898-1960), General Secretary of the Japanese Socialist Party in postwar Japan.\n\n11In Japan at the time, as surveillance over socialist organizations and individuals was strictly carried out by the authorities, Komatsu always had police after him whenever he returned to Kôbe. One day, when he was listening to a speech given by Kagawa Toyohiko (1888-1960), a well-known Christian social activist, at a meeting in Kôbe, and was about to take a defiant attitude toward Kagawa’s brand of socialism, Komatsu was arrested by the police and was hustled off to a police cell. He was released after a short while, but his father was greatly shocked when the news of his son’s arrest was publicly reported in a Kôbe newspaper (ibid.: 47-48).\n\n12Returning to Tôkyô, Komatsu began to consider seriously the possibility of going to the United States or to Europe. Going to the West was, of course, a romantic dream commonly found among many Japanese youth, and it must have strongly appealed to Komatsu. In particular, Aoki suggests that Komatsu was also anxious to look for “a genuine brand of socialism” (ibid.: 48-49), something that was not to be sought for in Japan but only abroad. Komatsu was able to gain admission to the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago, and was granted a passport. But on the day of his departure by train from Tôkyô to Kôbe, we are told, those who saw him off at the Tôkyô station, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, sang militant songs in a loud voice. As a result, Komatsu’s trip was cancelled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which saw a report of the incident in a newspaper, and considered it inappropriate to allow such a radical student as Komatsu to go to the United States. At last, through the help of his uncle, Komatsu managed to obtain permission from the authorities to go to study in France, as the monitoring of students wishing to go there was apparently far more relaxed (ibid.).\n\n13Writing in his autumnal years for the column “Seishun no zangeroku” (Confessions of One’s Youth) of the Shûkan Yomiuri about the motives behind his journey to France, Komatsu seems to have downplayed the ideological aspect and simply recalled: “Often I have been asked about the purpose of my going there. There was no particular clear-cut aim. I simply wanted to go abroad so much – that is probably the closest answer. Undoubtedly, there might have been the attraction of democracy and socialism that began to appeal to the youth at the time, but I think what moved me much more strongly was the youthful spirit of romanticism. I thus jumped into the rushing stream from an intense desire to escape from Japan and single-handedly conduct an adventurous and dangerous life in a foreign land” (Komatsu 1958: 60).\n\nKomatsu’s Encounters with the Vietnamese in Paris\n\n14Komatsu arrived in Paris in September 1921. It is significant to note that within less than a month after his arrival, he met Nguyen Ai Qudc, the widely-known Vietnamese anti-colonial activist, who had come there from London in 1917. This meeting, Komatsu later recalled, marks the beginning of his “connections with Vietnam and the Vietnamese independence movement” (Komatsu 1950: 49). Different accounts of this intriguing encounter and the subsequent eighteen-month association between the two in Paris were provided by Komatsu at various times.\n\n16Their first meeting took place in late October 1921 at a public gathering held by the socialists and radicals at the Salle Wagram, near the Arc de Triomphe, on behalf of Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian immigrant workers who were to be sentenced to death by the Massachusetts High Court. Komatsu knew of this meeting through an appeal in L’Humanité, the organ of the French Communist Party, which he had subscribed to and read with a dictionary ever since his arrival in Paris. In the midst of the meeting, an Oriental man with prominent cheek bones and blazing eyes sitting behind him asked him, “Are you Chinese?” “I’m Japanese”, replied Komatsu. After the meeting, the two went to a nearby care and got to know each other. The man turned out to be Nguyễn Ái Quốc, an Annamese (as the Vietnamese were known then), who by that time had become committed to the communist cause, acting as a member of the Committee on Colonial Issues within the French Communist Party. After that evening, Komatsu and Nguyễn Ái Quốc met quite often. Nguyễn lived in Ménilmontant and made a living by doing photographic work. In his spare time, he wrote for L’Humanité on colonial questions, especially Indochinese affairs. Komatsu, living in Montparnasse, on the opposite side of Paris, was commuting to a foreign language school in the Quartier Latin to learn the basics of the French language. As his French was still inadequate at the time, Komatsu would use English to speak to Nguyễn on complicated subjects. When Nguyễn visited Komatsu at his attic room in Montparnasse for the first time, he gave Komatsu a collection of his articles in L’Humanité in pamphlet form.\n\n17While Komatsu felt that his philosophy of life and his view of art greatly differed from those of Nguyễn Ái Quốc, the two were bound, according to Komstsu’s account, by “a strong friendship, which might have sprung from their impoverished life and loneliness” (Komatsu 1954a: 183). Komatsu saw himself at the age of twenty as a “typical romanticist,” and his ideas “were those of a communist;” nonetheless, his “brand of communism, when one probed into it a bit more carefully, had roots by and large originating from Tolstoy and not from Marx” (ibid.: 181-183). Komatsu said that he “wanted to write only for a minority group, i.e., the intellectuals;” in contrast, Nguyễn Ái Quốc, a devoted Marxist political activist, “would write for the majority” (Komatsu 1944a: No. 225, 17). The difference between Komatsu’s aspiration to become an artist and Nguyễn Ái Quốc’s to become a revolutionary has also been revealed in the widely-read biography of Hồ Chì Minh by Jean Lacouture (1968: 22-23). Lacouture gives an account of the last conversation that Komatsu had with Nguyen in November 1923 before the latter left Paris for Moscow: “Come to Moscow with me,” said the Vietnamese, “At last I’m to become acquainted with the birthplace of the Revolution.” The Japanese said he would rather devote himself to art and literature, and Paris suited him better for that purpose. “What kind of art can you practice in this rotten society?” retorted Ho. “We will make the revolution, and then you can write for the free men in a classless society!” (ibid.).\n\n18The information in Vietnamese sources also adds to our knowledge of the association between Komatsu and Nguyễn Ái Quốc in Paris in the early 1920s. In Thới thanh niên của Bác Hố (Uncle Ho’s Youth), for example, Hồng Hà—an expert on Nguyễn Ái Quốc/ Hồ Chí Minh—wrote: “On March 14, 1923, Nguyen moved to stay in the office of the journal Le Paria (an anti-colonial journal published by Nguyễn and his colleagues in Paris in the early 1920s), carrying with him a single bed and a suitcase, which, when inspected, had only books. The process of monitoring Nguyễn in Paris was intensified when the Ministry of Colonies created a new agency to keep track of the Indochinese in France. Foreigners living in Paris, who corresponded or maintained direct contacts with Nguyễn, also became the subjects of investigation. Included in the list were a certain Russian student called Mikhail Petroff, the Indian patriot Alitaba Godor, the Irish patriots living on the third floor of 12 boulevard des Capucines, and the Japanese writer Komatsu Kiyoshi, who rented a room with the painter Sakamoto” (1994: 160). According to Komatsu, the renowned painter Sakamoto Hanjirô (1882-1969) had been on the same boat with him from Japan to Marseilles, and together with Sakamoto and another painter whom Komatsu simply identified as “I.,” he found an apartment at 18 rue Ernest Cresson, near Montparnasse cemetery (see Komatsu 1958: 60).\n\n19While still living on the rue Cresson, Komatsu wrote a letter to Nguyễn Ái Quốc, asking him how to obtain a membership card in the French Communist Party. In this letter, Komatsu expressed a desire to go to the south of France—Cannes, Menton, or Nice—for his health. He proposed to earn his living as a worker. “I must learn by working,” he declared (in English). Komatsu felt that such an experience was essential for anyone responsible for building a new society like that of Russia (Komatsu to Nguyễn Ái Quốc, 19 November 1921, AOM, SPCE, c. 364).\n\n20Another Vietnamese author, Thu Trang, in her study of Nguyễn Ái Quốc during his stay in Paris from 1917 to 1923, provides further information on the basis of the documents of the French Surete: “According to secret reports, during the first half of 1922, Nguyễn Ái Quốc received many letters from people from different parts of the world..., including one from a Japanese called Komats [sic]” (1991: 172). Komatsu’s own accounts indicate that by 1922 he had gone to work on a farm in southern France, so that his letter to Nguyễn would presumably have been written from there.\n\n21Although he found his life philosophy ultimately incompatible with that of Nguyễn, Komatsu appears to have held high respect for Nguyen’s determined commitment and selfless dedication to the struggle against colonial rule in his country. It was in his attic room in Montparnasse that Komatsu heard from Nguyễn, for the first time, about Annam’s national independence movement. In his semi-autobiographical novel, Vetonamu no chi, Komatsu recalled that through “the anger and hatred that overflowed Nguyễn’s face,” something about that “unknown world” that he “had hitherto understood only conceptually, suddenly became so immediately convincing.” Nguyễn then said to him: “In order to maintain the splendor and the high culture of this Paris, what a sacrifice the peoples in the French colonies have to make! [...] As an Asian yourself, you should go to Indochina to see with your own eyes the conditions under which my compatriots have to live” (Komatsu 1954a: 184).\n\n22In addition to Nguyễn Ái Quốc, Komatsu met in Paris another Vietnamese who likewise helped to shape his outlook on French Indochina. Nguyễn Giang (1910-1969) was the son of Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh, an eminent figure in the intellectual circles and a key person in the movement to popularize quổc ngữ (the romanized Vietnamese alphabet) in Vietnam from the 1910s to the mid-1930s. Like Komatsu, Nguyễn Giang’s first love was painting. He enrolled in the same painting school with Komatsu in Montparnasse when he first arrived in Paris in the late 1920s. Being heedful, however, of the advice of his father, Nguyễn Giang gave up his dream of becoming a painter to succeed to his father’s literary endeavor. Indeed, Nguyễn Giang later became a well-known literary figure on his own in Vietnam. He was a poet, a Literary critic, a publicist, and the translator of Shakespeare’s Macbeth and Hamlet, Racine’s Andromaque, and Hugo’s and Baudelaire’s works into Vietnamese. Although Komatsu did not mention Nguyễn Giang’s name as often as he did Nguyen Nguyễn Ái Quốc, Nguyễn Giang would play a significant role as a mediator between Komatsu and Vietnamese culture when the two coincidentally met again some ten years later in Hanoi, as will be mentioned later.\n\nExposure to Andre Malraux’ Writings and his Activism\n\n23While there is no doubt that, through his association in Paris with the Vietnamese, such as Nguyễn Ái Quốc and Nguyễn Giang, Komatsu gained some approximate ideas about the conditions in French Indochina and began to feel an attachment to its people, there were other factors that would eventually lead him to engage himself totally as an activist in French Indochinese affairs. One of these was certainly the notion of activism that he drew from Andre Malraux (1901-1976) and his writings.\n\n25Komatsu immediately jotted down his fresh impressions after reading Les conquérants and sent them to Malraux. A few days afterward, he visited Malraux, who was at the time Head of the Arts Division of the NRF (Nouvelle Revue Française), at his office; and as Komatsu later admitted, the meeting made a decisive impact upon his career. To Komatsu, Malraux was nothing short of a living model, demonstrating to him the possibility of combining the essential elements of a political activist and an artist at a high level, something Komatsu had always been striving for (ibid.: 79). It was from this time that Komatsu began to shift his interests from painting to writing as a career. In October 1931, soon after Komatsu returned to Japan after ten years of sojourn in France, Malraux arrived in Kôbe via Peking and Tientsin. Komatsu was the main host for Malraux’ visit and their friendship seems to have further consolidated afterward (see Photo 1).\n\n27During 1936-1937, Japan was struck by a violent storm of militarism, with the attempted military coup by young army officers on February 26, 1936, and the outbreak of the total war between Japan and China on July 7, 1937. Meanwhile, in Europe, the Spanish Civil War had erupted, and Komatsu’s friend and mentor Malraux had immediately flown to Madrid to organize an international air squadron fighting against Franco. Komatsu wanted badly to join Malraux in Spain. “How could I possibly go on living in this cramped Nippon,” Komatsu later recalled his feelings at the time, “living in such an obscure and desperate fashion like this? […] I felt an urgent need to fight where it would be most worth the struggle and where I could use my abilities to their maximum. And this made my desire to journey to Spain even greater...” (Komatsu 1960: 118-119).\n\n28In August 1937, Komatsu boarded a Japanese steamer and headed for France. Soon after his arrival in Paris, he met Malraux, who had just returned temporarily from Spain. Malraux promised to write for him a letter of introduction so that Komatsu could obtain a visa to proceed to Spain to join him. In late October, having seen Malraux off again to Spain, Komatsu called on Gide at the latter’s apartment. This was the first time that the two met, although Komatsu had published translations of Gide’s writings in Japan previously. Komatsu considered his meeting with Gide as “a sacred experience,” comparing his feelings on visiting Gide to those “of a pilgrim visiting a Holy Place” (ibid.: 127-128). While understanding well the viewpoints of both Malraux and Gide, along with their differences—Gide had made clear his anti-Stalinist stand, and Malraux, who tried “to add to the mission of the intelligentsia that of active leadership,” at the time was taken as “a supporter of Stalinism”—Komatsu’s own position was quite clear-cut. As he put it: “I can respect the view of both. I have ties of the heart with both” (ibid.: 127-139).\n\n29As it turned out, Komatsu never made it to Spain. Even with a letter of recommendation from Malraux, who was responsible for the International Volunteer Air Force, the Spanish Republican authorities refused to grant Komatsu a visa. The reason for this refusal, given by an officer in the Spanish Embassy in Paris, was quite shocking to Komatsu: A faction in his government in Madrid would assume that “all Japanese are militarists and fascists” and supportive of Franco (ibid.: 142). Even after having been told so, Komatsu said that he made his antifascist position clear to the officer: “Well, let me say that I am deeply grateful for all your assistance thus far. And furthermore, this has not changed my support of the Spanish Republic. The only thing I would like to add is this: even if Japan should become totally fascist, all Japanese will not be fascists. And I shall keep myself an anti-fascist Japanese to the end...” (ibid.: 143).\n\n30In April 1938, he left Paris for a three-week trip to Italy to see ancient works of art, ignoring the fact that the Mussolini regime was in power there. He went to visit museums in Florence, Rome, Milan, and Turin, and was profoundly impressed by what he saw. Like Malraux, Komatsu displayed extraordinary interest in art, [or he saw art as the highest form of action and believed that aesthetic ideas should form, along with activism, an essential part in man’s response to his destiny.\n\nKomatsu and French Indochina, 1941-1946\n\nThe Call of French Indochina\n\n34As the attempt to make the Japanese language a lingua franca for all countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere did not work in Vietnam, the Japanese authorities adopted French, however unwillingly, as the working language. As a result, those Japanese fluent in French were in great demand in Indochina. As Nasu Kunio, who was then working in the Japanese Embassy in Saigon, testified: “Indochina at the time resembled a catchment area for all the Japanese who spoke French. They might be working in the military or in the embassy; they might be important executives or part-time employees of private companies. To those who had some knowledge of French, Indochina was indeed heaven; they would have free access to food and alcohol, they could watch French movies, a bit outdated ones, and read French books, or just pass the time sitting on a terrace and having a friendly chat with Frenchmen whom they knew through their works. The atmosphere was as if it were peacetime” (Nasu 1963: 42).\n\n35Komatsu had spent fourteen years altogether in France (ten years from 1921 to 1931, and about four years from 193 7 to 1 940). Not only fluent in French, Komatsu was thoroughly at home in French culture. With this background, he would not have had much difficulty in dealing with the French in Indochina, as well as with the Vietnamese elites, who were also educated in French. At the same time, as a citizen of Japan, he represented the country that was gaining the actual power in French Indochina. Thus, he seems to have concluded that French Indochina was precisely the stage waiting for him to act on.\n\nVision of a Vietnam within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n\n[In Vietnam] in the eyes of the patriots and the intelligentsia, Matsuoka-san was a prophet of the emancipation of East Asia and the hero who holds its banner. I was asked by them time and again about his background. When I told them that Matsuoka-san came from a common background, studied in the United States under difficult conditions to obtain a university degree, and so on, their eyes would beam in admiration” (Komatsu 1941: 94-96).\n\n38There is no doubt that Komatsu shared the admiration he described. Matsuoka’s credentials as a self-made man and his strokes of policy on the international scene might well have made him represent for Komatsu an ideal “man of action.”\n\n40For this reason, while displaying genuine concern for Vietnam’s problems under French rule and presenting a most perceptive interpretation of her culture, Komatsu seems to have regarded Vietnam as essentially a part of Japan’s Greater East Asia. His concept of an independent Vietnam in Futsuin e no michi, and in his other wartime writings for that matter, was a Vietnam independent from French (i.e., Western) colonial power, but comprised within the framework of the Toa Kyoeiken (East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere) under Japan’s leadership.\n\n41What made Komatsu’s vision of the Tôa Kyôeiken unique was that he seems to have had the utmost sympathy for the Indochinese living under colonial rule, and he retained this sympathy throughout the war years. At the same time, while opposing colonial rule in Vietnam, Komatsu displayed no enmity toward France and the French. The sentiments toward France and Vietnam expressed by Wada Noboru, a character in Komatsu’s semi-autobiographical novel, Vetonamu no chi (The Blood of Vietnam; 1954), modeled after Komatsu himself, seems to have reflected those of the author: “France is my second home. Spiritually speaking, France is indeed my birthplace. My indebtedness to France is incalculable. For Vietnam, my tender sentiments are as if it were my native land. I have never become so strongly attached to a country as such” (1954a: 335-336).\n\n42Futsuin e no michi reads in parts like a suggested plan for integrating French Indochina into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In Komatsu’s view, Indochina was Japan’s vital line of defense (seimeisen) in the south (Komatsu 1941: 139). He was evidently disappointed with the way French Indochina was treated in the Japanese newspapers and magazines. In his opinion, everyone in Japan was talking about the need to exploit natural resources and expand Japanese industries, and was highly critical of the French colonial rule in Indochina, but rarely would anyone say anything about what Japan was supposed to do for the Indochinese people.\n\n43Komatsu maintained that, although the French had had to conclude a military alliance with Japan for the defense of Indochina in their own interest, the Japanese hitherto had “catered too much to the desires of the French,” and there were occasions on which they “displayed too much sympathy for French feelings and sentiments.” “In terms of the real power and responsibility for defense” in Indochina, Komatsu argued, “Japan clearly occupies the leading position. Japan should make her military and cultural leadership obvious” (ibid.: 4-13).\n\nTranslation of The Tale of Kiếu\n\n45Komatsu described his excitement when he first read The Tale of Kiếu in a French translation:\n\nIt was with extraordinary passion and emotion that I read, as in a dream, each line of this love poem. I was captivated by the unfolding of its eventful story and by its highly-flavored dramatic atmosphere. I was almost intoxicated by the beauty of its elegant expressions. If even in its French translation it held such fascination for me, what would it do, I wondered, if I read it in the original? (ibid.: 160.)\n\n46But in addition to bringing him under its spell by its poetic qualities, The Tale of Kiếu also appealed to Komatsu’s intellectual curiosity. He explained: “In this work, what might be called a panorama of the ways of thinking, the sentimental and social life of the Vietnamese people is superbly depicted” (ibid.: 160-161). “For travelers,” he declared, “this tale would be far more useful than the travel accounts of French Indochina, which read like superficial guide books for tourist bureaus” (ibid.: 162).\n\n48While in Hanoi, Komatsu coincidentally met Nguyễn Giang again after some ten years of separation since they had last seen each other in Paris in 1931, and it was Nguyen who took care to introduce Komatsu to a group of energetic and reform-minded Vietnamese writers, critics, journalists, and artists working around Annam nouveau. It was also Nguyen who introduced The Tale of Kiếu to Komatsu as a clue to Vietnamese culture. In fact, the Japanese translation of The Tale of Kiếu by Komatsu was mainly based upon the French translation by Nguyễn Giang’s father, Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh, who was a principal drive behind the Annam nouveau movement. Nguyễn Giang remained one of Komatsu’s closest associates for the entire period of his sojourn in Indochina from 1943 to 1946.\n\n49Ironically, on December 8, 1941, a few days before Futsuin e no michi was published, Komatsu had been arrested by the local police authorities in Tôkyô as a “dangerous person” on three counts: as “a liberal” (jiyushugisha) behind the Popular Front, a propaganda man for the Spanish Republic during 1936-1937, and a translator and friend of Malraux (see Komatsu’s letter to Malraux, n.d.; Hayashi 1993: 256). In prison, Komatsu said, he carved the sentence “One day I shall go South!” with his nails on the wall of his solitary cell. At times, he even wished to be drafted as a member of the press corps of the army. With his friends’ help, he was finally released on suspension of indictment after four months of imprisonment. During the twelve-month period after his release until his departure for French Indochina in April 1943, Komatsu completed his translation of The Tale of Kiếu, which was published in July 1942, and seems to have spent a great deal of time on work related to French Indochina.\n\nKomatsu and Marquis Cướng Để\n\n51Together with Tashiro Shigenori (later to become Japan’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to French Indochina in November 1942) and Mizushima Haruo (a sympathizer of the pro-Japanese Phục Quổc party that carried out the abortive Lạng Sơn uprising against the French in September 1940), Komatsu organized an association in support of Cướng Để’s cause. In September 1944, General Matsui even made an extra effort to travel to Saigon to lay down a plan for Cướng Để’s accession to the throne in place of Bảo Đại following a Japanese military coup. After the actual coup on March 9, 1945, which practically immobilized all French armed forces in Indochina, it was widely touted that Cướng Để would make a triumphant return to Vietnam to replace Bảo Đại on the throne.\n\n52The idea, however, was strongly opposed by Lt. General Tsuchihashi Yuitsu, who was actually commanding the coup in March 1945. Twice before the coup, when the Imperial Headquarters in Tôkyô asked Tsuchihashi to receive Cướng Để in Saigon, Tsuchihashi had flatly rejected the proposal, replying that if Cướng Để were to return to Saigon, he would send him directly to Poulo Condore prison. Tsuchihashi said that he had no special attachment to Bảo Đại, but his principle was not to interfere in Vietnam’s domestic affairs; so, “even if Bảo Đại were an worthless emperor, his fate should be decided by a formal institution in Vietnam, such as her national assembly,” and he “did not wish to see him to be dethroned by Japan” (Tsuchihashi 1980: 528-530).\n\n53According to Tsuchihashi, “feeling sorry for Cướng Để, who had lived forty years in exile,” and for the Japanese who had been supporting him, after the coup, he had an audience with Emperor Bao Dai to see if the latter would be prepared to welcome Cướng Để in Hua. Bảo Đại said that he would be ready to offer Cướng Để the title of Grand Duke (Dai Cong) and appoint him President of the Privy Council (Cơ Mật Viện), Apparently, Cướng Để was agreeable to the terms, as Tsuchihashi would soon receive a telegram from Tôkyô indicating that Cướng Để was to return to Vietnam at the beginning of August. A farewell reception for Cướng Để was held in late July at the Imperial Hotel in Tôkyô, but Cướng Để would never make it to Vietnam (ibid.: 531-532).\n\n55In retrospect, from the moment Komatsu pledged his support for Marquis Cướng Để, his vision of a Vietnam independent from French rule was of a country under Cướng Để’s leadership and a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This vision laid down, in practice, the direction of Kornatsu’s activities as a “French Indochina rônin,” Komatsu remained a loyal and strong supporter of Cướng Để until the latter died in obscurity in Tôkyô in 1951. It should be added that Komatsu was quite forthright about Cướng Để’s weaknesses, as well as about their mutual relationship, which, in his words, was “one linked by the passion for Vietnam’s independence, i.e., a political passion, rather than one connected by human sentiments, or intellectual appeal” (ibid.: 28-29). Komatsu later provided an account, at times with some fictional elements, of his ten-year association with Cướng Để in Vetonamu (Vietnam), published in 1955, a few years after Cướng Để’s death. According to him, this book was written to serve three purposes: first, as a testimony of his “fateful connection” with Vietnam during her most critical period, and of his “participation in the independence movement in this country for a number of years;” secondly, as a memorial to Marquis Cướng Để; and thirdly, as a truthful record of “the historical link” between Japan and the national independence movement in Vietnam, with both Japan’s “breach of trust” (hai’nin) and her contribution (kiyo) (ibid.: 259-260).\n\n56The passage in this book that discusses the role of the Japanese who assisted Sun Yat-sen of China, Aguinaldo of the Philippines, and other Asian revolutionaries in their nationalist movements reads very much like Komatsu’s defense of his “activism” and his “pan-Asian” internationalism (a term used by Benedict R. O’G. Anderson, see Anderson 1961) in assisting Cướng Để’s cause:\n\n19 Chì sĩ in Vietnamese. It is not clear why Komatsu seems to have considered this term “disrespectf (...)\n\nWhat attracts our attention is that these Japanese at great personal risk helped the nationalist movements in various Asian countries. Many people nowadays would refer to these men, disrespectfully, as tsiriku ronin (adventurers on the continent), or shishi (men of high spirit), 19or by some rightist names. But what drew them to the Asian nationalist movement should be called their sympathy, as fellow Asians, for national independence and their solidarity for their fellows who were resisting Western imperialist and capitalist encroachment. What moved them to act was an Asian patriotism, not an intention to be the spearhead of Japanese imperialism as a substitute for Western hegemony. They were probably romantic characters, but certainly not the henchmen of the Japanese militarism that would later badly affect Japan [...]. They might have been men who possessed the naivety and the dreams of the shishi, but they would have had nothing in common with the dishonest and calculating mind of a place-hunter. (Komatsu 1955: 79.)\n\nA Rônin in Action, 1943-1946\n\n58It is worth noting that the Head of the Center was Minister Yokoyama Masayuki (also known as Ambassador Jean-Marie Yokoyama), a veteran diplomat who later would act as Supreme Adviser to Bảo Đại after the March 9, 1945, coup, while the person who ran the actual business of the Center was its General Secretary Ômiya Komaki (1894-1965), a Sorbonne-educated and socialist-minded labor law specialist, a writer and critic of French literature. Ômiya had become a well-known figure in the literary circle in Japan and a founder of a movement called Tanemaku Hito (Men Who Sow), before being recruited by the Compagnie lndochinoise de Commerce et d’Industrie (CICE) to go to Hanoi in 1937.\n\n63Most significantly, Komatsu recalled on numerous occasions that his “closest friends” in wartime Indochina were two leading members of the Communist-led resistance in Cochinchina. One of those was Dr. Phạm Ngọc Thạch, a man of great ability and sophistication who at the time was not yet known to be a member of the Indochinese Communist Party. Komatsu seems to have enjoyed immensely the mutual friendship and trust that he had with Thạch, who treated him “like a brother” (Komatsu 1954a: 19). Thạch was the type of friend with whom Komatsu felt that he could open his heart and talk. This bond of trust seems to have been founded on a meeting of personalities and intellectual sophistication, something lacking in his association with Marquis Cướng Để and many others. In the new Hồ Chì Minh government, Thạch was Minister of Health and adviser to Ho on foreign affairs. In turn, his bond of trust with Komatsu could have contributed to Thạch’s excellent relations with Komatsu’s political allies in Saigon, such as Minoda Fujio, who was promoted to Governor of Cochinchina after the March coup, and Iida, delegated by Minoda to develop the paramilitary Vanguard Youth (Thanh Niên Tiền Phong) to counter Maurice Ducoroy’s Youth and Sports Movement. The Vanguard Youth was soon placed under Phạm Ngọc Thạch’s leadership, and was instantly transformed into a vigorous regular army. All this, according to Komatsu, was thanks to Thạch’s “superb organizational power,” his “training,” and his “spirit” (ibid.: 136-13 7). Following Japan’s surrender, the fact that the Japanese authorities in Saigon, which had been the headquarters of the Japanese Southern Army, agreed to hand over power and arms peacefully to native authorities, without bloodshed, was indeed remarkable. The role that Thạch and his associates, and indirectly Komatsu, played in it has not hitherto been sufficiently appreciated.\n\n64It is difficult to provide a fully-documented account of Komatsu’s activities in Vietnam from 1943 to 1946. His story cannot be found anywhere in the archival files in France, Japan, and Vietnam that I have attempted to go through. As a result, the only recourse left is to rely mainly on his writings—including some occasional pieces that he published in Vietnamese magazines during the wartime, and on the reports that he wrote for Japanese newspapers and magazines during the postwar years—and to check these documents against what has been written about him by others. Patching such sporadic information together, one can relate just a few anecdotes that may help to reveal the range of Komatsu’s versatile activities in Vietnam.\n\n66In the spring 1944 issue of Tân Á (New Asia), a journal founded in October 1942 by the Japanese Information Center in Saigon for the promotion of Japan’s Greater East Asia, Komatsu contributed an article in which he reiterated his view that The Tale of Kiếu was a mirror of the Vietnamese mind, for both its qualities and its limitations. Komatsu’s article prompted a response from a reader signing himself T.S., who argued that “Whoever says that The Tale of Kiếu reflects the mind of the Vietnamese, that person has not yet understood this people.” One might have hoped that a lively discussion on The Tale of Kiếu would follow, but T.S.’ argument amounted to little beyond an expression of his patriotic emotions (see Komatsu 1944b, T.S. 1944).\n\n67In the December 8, 1943, issue that “commemorated the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War,” Komatsu contributed a two-page poem entitled “The Song of Greater East Asia.” In this poem, he called upon the peoples of East Asia “to throw away the degrading blanket [undoubtedly a metaphor for ‘colonial rule’] by which they have been covered for so long” in order to follow the call of the children of the Yamato race and sing in a loud voice: “Asia is ours! Asia is ours! All of Asia is one Great Asia!” (Komatsu 1943: 14-15).\n\n68On a more direct form of action, on the evening of March 9, 1945, Komatsu led a group of Vietnamese and his kaizoku in an attack on the French guards at the Hanoi prison and freed all Vietnamese political prisoners (see Nasu 1963: 48; Oshima 1962). General Mikuni is said to have “highly praised Komatsu’s attempt to isolate the Vietnamese soldiers of the French Indochinese Army from the French officers” (Mikuni 1965, cited in Nitz 1984: 127). For what Komatsu had done to the French authorities that evening, following Japan’s surrender on August 15, 1945, he had to go into hiding in Hanoi lest the French should arrest him. Then, receiving word that Phạm Ngọc Thạch was among the leaders of the provisional government in Saigon, he led a “caravan” of one truck and several passenger cars carrying some thirty Đại Việt members, whom Komatsu felt obliged to protect from the Việt Minh, and headed for Saigon. Before leaving Hanoi, Komatsu convinced General Mikuni, a “respectable military man,” to “avoid fighting against the Việt Minh in any way” (Komatsu 1954a: 16-19). Once the safety of his nationalist associates had been secured in Saigon, Komatsu went back to Hanoi with his driver.\n\n71The March 6, 1946, agreement between France and Vietnam, for which Komatsu and Omiya had done their part, did not last long, for as soon as Admiral d’Argenlieu returned to the Indochinese scene, the agreement was openly ignored, and the first Indochina War began late that year. This notwithstanding, in Komatsu’s mind, as indeed in Ômiya’s, the contribution toward an accord between France and Vietnam was something in which to take great pride. In fact he later wrote the book Vetonamu no chi (The Blood of Vietnam) as an account of the events in which he took part during the two month-period prior to the March 6 agreement. In May 1946, Komatsu returned to Japan, along with Ômiya, on a repatriation ship, ending his eventful three years in Vietnam.\n\nKomatsu’s Engagement with Vietnam: An Assessment\n\n72On looking back at Komatsu’s engagement with Vietnam during the Second World War, it appears that, from the moment he decided to collaborate in Japan’s war effort as an active participant, he placed himself in a self-contradictory and acutely frustrating situation. In his self-appointed role as a “French Indochina activist”—in effect, a Futsuin rônin, although he might not have accepted the term—Komatsu wished to promote the independence of Vietnam from colonial rule, and he lent his support to Marquis Cướng Để as the nominal leader of that cause. There can be no doubt about Komatsu’s passionate affection for Vietnam and her culture and his genuine sympathy for the Vietnamese people under French rule. But at the same time, Komatsu was a champion of Japan’s pan-Asianism. Therefore his vision of an “independent” Vietnam under Cướng Để entailed placing the country within the framework of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under Japan’s tutelage. It is true that Komatsu’s brand of pan-Asianism, with its internationalism and emphasis on “co-operation” rather than on “exploitation,” was very different from the self-serving pan-Asianism advocated by many wartime Japanese leaders. But for that very reason, he was bound to be disappointed by the inadequacy of Cướng Để and the sheer expediency displayed in his own government’s treatment of French Indochina.\n\n73Above all, it seems that, being somewhat carried away by his implicit faith in Japan’s self-appointed role in the emancipation of East Asia and in the safeguard of “Asia for the Asians,” and by his characteristic drive to plunge into action, Komatsu failed to recognize the critical divergence between his notion of dokuritsu (independence) and the independence that the vast majority of the Vietnamese populace was looking for. Komatsu’s vision of an independent Vietnam that was free from French colonial rule but comprised within Japan’s Greater East Asia was essentially incompatible with the ideals of most Vietnamese: The independence that they were looking for was not only from France but also from any form of foreign rule.\n\n74It is perhaps true that there were also many pan-Asianist aspirants in Vietnam who had been profoundly impressed by Japan’s modern transformation following the Meiji Restoration and her victory over Russia. Should Japan’s grand motto “Asia for the Asians” materialize, these Vietnamese were looking, unconsciously perhaps, for a kind of equal and peaceful Asian confederation. But owing to Japan’s expediential policy of “maintaining tranquility” in Indochina, the French colonial regime was left intact until almost the very end. For this reason, the question that would have occurred to a patriotic Vietnamese at the time was: “Why does Japan profess to liberate East Asia on the one hand, yet on the other hand retain the colonial government?” The adoption by the Japanese authorities of French as the working language in Indochina made the situation all the more awkward. In retrospect, it looks as if the gap between Komatsu’s perception of an independent Vietnam and that of many Vietnamese became wider and wider as the course of Japan’s war effort went from bad to worse and Vietnamese nationalism grew more intense than ever. Comparing Komatsu during his years in Vietnam with T.E. Lawrence, Nasu Kunio, one of Komatsu’s wartime Japanese acquaintances, made the following remark: “Like Lawrence who, in pursuing his vision for a union of the Arabs, rushed into military operations and political maneuvers, without recognizing not only the intentions of the British but also those of the Arab leaders; so Komatsu pursued his dream of Vietnam’s independence” (Nasu 1963: 46).\n\n75In the final analysis, the Japanese occupation, along with the French colonial regime in Vietnam, had, paradoxically enough, lent support to Hồ Chì Minh and the communist-led Viet Minh in their rise to power by giving them their raison d’être. After all, they were the ones who had consciously and effectively converted the craving for independence of the Vietnamese populace into a formidable force. In his semi-autobiography, Komatsu gave the following lively account on the conditions in Hanoi after the Việt Minh’s takeover in late August 1945: “During the two or three months after the end of the war, on the streets of Hanoi, from early morning until late at night, there was no time when one did not hear Việt Minh songs. It seemed as if everybody, old and young alike, like people intoxicated or suffering from fever, kept on singing and singing. Even when there were no songs to be heard, I had the illusion that I could hear the refrains of these songs. It seemed as if that delusive sensation could not got out of my head. So powerfully, one might say, had the passion for independence captivated the masses” (Komatsu 1954a: 210). It should be added that, in the perception of complete independence held by Hồ and many Vietnamese, the main thing was driving out the foreign powers, and all other issues were secondary to that and could be postponed. Yet, a temporary triumph over a foreign power did not seem to provide Vietnam with a complete and long-lasting independence, as the history of Vietnam in the postwar period has amply indicated.\n\n76Reading what Komatsu wrote about his activities in French Indochina, one has the impression that he was at his happiest when he could serve as an international activist, without being constrained by the rhetoric of imperial Japan’s pan-Asian ideology. He was most in his element when in the company of people like Phạm Ngọc Thạch, who could transcend ideologies to meet him on the same level, or when he was actually risking his life to work as a mediator in the March 6, 1946, peace agreement between France and the communist-led Việt Minh during the last stage of his sojourn. But as this agreement was soon ignored by the French, Komatsu’s “remarkable” (Komaki 1965: 186) contribution to this short-lived peace settlement fell into oblivion, overshadowed by the nine-year war that ended only with the collapse of France’s last colonial onslaught on the peninsula.\n\n78Such dismissals of Komatsu’s career in Vietnam should not be allowed to blind us to the special value of his insights into the situation around him. As a sophisticated intellectual, acquainted at first hand with numerous parts of the world, Komatsu was able to make observations about Vietnam and her culture, which attain a depth rarely found in the writings of his contemporaries. These observations are among the most penetrating that we possess—very sympathetic, but highly critical at the same time. Moreover, it feIl to his lot to witness at first hand a decisive period in Vietnamese history. Among the Vietnamese whom Komatsu met between the early 1920s the late 1950s were the key players in modern Vietnamese history; to mention just some representative names, more or less in chronological order: Nguyễn Ái Quốc, Cướng Để, Ngô Đinh Diệm, Hoàng Xuân Hãn, Phạm Ngọc Thạch, Tạ Thu Thâu, Vu Hồng Khanh, Phan Kế Toại, and Hồ Chì Minh. His remarks about some of these personalities are astonishingly candid and insightful, adding new clarity and perspective to our picture of these historical figures. Though Komatsu’s notion of Vietnamese independence may have been confused and his attempts at activism in Vietnam largely futile, he nevertheless succeeded, through his writings, in making a permanent contribution to a country for which he had the most profound sympathy.\n\nVĨNH Sính, 1988, Phan Bội Châu and the Đông Du Movement (ed.), New Haven, CT: Yale International and Area Studies.\n\nVĨNH Sính, 1996, “Một nhà văn Nhật viết về Nguyễn Ài Quốc” [A Japanese Author Wrote on Nguyễn Ài Quốc], Xưa và Nay, No. 27, May."
