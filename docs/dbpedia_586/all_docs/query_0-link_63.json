        "text": "Land\n\nJapan comprises an island chain along mainland Asia’s east coast. The islands stretch about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) from northeast to southwest. Nearly all of the country’s land area is taken up by the four main islands—from north to south they are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Japan’s largest island by far is Honshu, with about three-fifths of the total area. On Honshu are most of Japan’s principal cities and the heaviest concentration of people. Among the country’s numerous smaller islands are the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands, including the island of Okinawa, to the south and west of Kyushu. The other major groups of smaller islands are the Izu, Bonin (Ogasawara), and Volcano (Kazan) islands to the south and east of central Honshu.\n\nJapan has no land border with any other country. Across the Sea of Japan to the west are North Korea and South Korea, and across the Sea of Japan to the northwest and the Sea of Okhotsk to the north is Russia. Across the East China Sea to the west is China. Southwest of Japan’s Ryukyu Islands are Taiwan and the Philippines. The open waters of the vast Pacific Ocean wash Japan’s eastern and southeastern shores. Across the Pacific, more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) away, is the United States mainland.\n\nThe islands of Japan are the exposed tops of massive undersea ridges that rise from the floor of the Pacific Ocean on the eastern edge of the Asian continental shelf. The islands are geologically young and unstable. They have been subjected to considerable folding, faulting, and volcanic activity. As a result, the land surface of the Japanese islands is rugged. Mountains and hills cover more than 80 percent of the land surface and divide the islands into hundreds of subunits. This creates a landscape of great variety and beauty and gives Japanese life a small-scale compactness. The largest and highest mountain mass, part of which is known as the Japanese Alps, is in central Honshu. From it mountain chains extend northward to Hokkaido and southwest to Shikoku and Kyushu. These mountain chains are gouged by many short river valleys and interrupted by many small lowland plains.\n\nOnly one-quarter of Japan’s land surface has a slope of less than 15 degrees. Most Japanese plains have been formed by river deposits and lie along the seacoast. The largest lowland, the Kanto Plain of east-central Honshu, has an area of more than 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers). In it sits the city of Tokyo. Among the country’s smaller, yet intensely utilized, plains are the Nobi Plain, the site of the city of Nagoya. Another notable plain lies in the Kinki (Kansai) region, near the cities of Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe.\n\nRivers and Coastline\n\nThe numerous rivers of Japan are short and have small drainage basins. Only two of them are more than 200 miles (310 kilometers) long—the Shinano and the Tone, both on Honshu. Of the two, the Shinano is the longest, at 228 miles (367 kilometers) long. The Tone drains the largest area—7,100 square miles (18,400 square kilometers).\n\nJapan’s rivers are generally steeply sloped. They tend to carry heavy loads of sediment (tiny rock and soil fragments) from the mountains to the lowlands. On the lowlands the rivers are usually shallow and braided and flow through gravel-filled beds. Often they have built-up natural levees and are elevated above the river plains. Their flow rates vary greatly with the seasonal rains.\n\nAlthough of little use for navigation, the rivers of Japan are used intensively for irrigation, urban water supply, and the generation of electricity. Floods are common, especially during the typhoon (tropical cyclone) season, and are highly destructive in the heavily populated river valleys and plains. Japan has few lakes. The largest is Lake Biwa, in west-central Honshu.\n\nJapan’s coastline is unusually long in relation to the country’s total land area. The Pacific coast has many deep indentations, among them Tokyo, Suruga, and Ise bays on Honshu and the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku. The indentations are separated by rugged peninsulas and headlands. Among them are the Boso and Izu peninsulas. The west coast of Kyushu is also deeply indented, and there are many small offshore islands. The Sea of Japan coast of Honshu, however, is much straighter and has long stretches of sand dunes and beach ridges.\n\nVolcanoes and Earthquakes\n\nJapan’s numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes are evidence of the instability of the rocks underlying the country. This instability is caused by the movement of several of Earth’s major crustal plates near the Japanese islands (see plate tectonics). The country has about 200 volcanoes and volcanic groups, of which about 60 have been active in recorded history. Some of the volcanoes are cone-shaped and rise to the highest elevations in Japan. Others are calderas, or craters where cones once stood.\n\nMount Fuji, the famous volcanic cone, is the highest peak in Japan. It rises to 12,388 feet (3,776 meters). Mount Fuji has been dormant since 1707. Mount Asama in central Honshu and Mount Sakurajima in southern Kyushu are well-known active volcanoes. Among the most notable calderas are Mount Aso in Kyushu and Mount Akan in Hokkaido. There are many hot springs in the country’s volcanic zones.\n\nJapan experiences some 1,000 tremors each year, most of them minor. However, major earthquakes have caused considerable loss of life and widespread destruction. Severe earthquakes that cause damage over small areas occur about every five or six years in Japan. One of the worst was the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which, combined with the ensuing fire, wiped out much of Tokyo and Yokohama. More than 140,000 lives were lost. An earthquake in Kobe in 1995 killed about 6,400 people.\n\nUndersea earthquakes in the North Pacific basin stir up unusually large tsunamis, a type of giant sea wave, that are very destructive when they reach the Japanese coast. In 1896 a tsunami seven stories high obliterated several villages near Sanriku, drowning roughly 26,000 people. In 2011 a powerful earthquake and large tsunami devastated Honshu’s eastern coast, killing more than 18,000 people (see Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011). That event also led to a nuclear accident at a coastal power plant.\n\nClimate\n\nFor a small country, Japan has a great variety of climatic conditions. This is partly because its islands extend across a large north-south distance. The islands are also in the zone where the conflicting air masses of the Asian continent and of the Pacific Ocean meet and interact. The continental air masses make for more extreme temperatures, both in winter and in summer, and result in large annual temperature ranges. But their effect is moderated by the strong marine influence, which also produces high humidity and abundant rainfall. Japan’s rugged terrain also causes many local variations in weather and climate.\n\nJapan’s climate is generally governed by wet and dry seasonal winds, called monsoons. During the winter, the country is primarily under the influence of cold air masses moving out of Siberia, Russia, deep in the Asian interior. Biting northwest winds pass over the Sea of Japan and cross the islands of Japan. Moisture picked up over the Sea of Japan is deposited on Japan’s west coast in the form of heavy snows that are among the deepest in the world.\n\nDuring the summer, Japan is under the influence of air moving in from the Pacific Ocean. Southeast winds prevail, making the summer months hot and humid. The cycle of the seasons brings frequent, often sharp, changes in the weather, especially during the spring and autumn months.\n\nJapan’s climate, especially along the coasts, is also affected by two ocean currents along the Pacific coast. The warm Kuroshio, or Japan Current, flows northward, while the cold Oya (or Kuril) Current flows southeastward. The two currents meet off northeastern Honshu. The Kuroshio, on the lee—or sheltered—side of Japan in winter, has little warming effect on land temperatures. The Tsushima Current, a branch of the Kuroshio, passes into the Sea of Japan by way of Korea Strait and slightly warms offshore waters. The Oya reduces summer temperatures and creates dense fog banks off the coasts of northeastern Honshu and Hokkaido.\n\nVirtually all of Japan except parts of eastern Hokkaido averages more than 40 inches (100 centimeters) of precipitation annually. Several coastal mountain areas in Honshu get more than 120 inches (300 centimeters). The area around the Inland Sea, eastern Honshu north of Tokyo Bay, and western Hokkaido average 40 to 60 inches (100 to 150 centimeters) of annual precipitation. The Sea of Japan coast gets more precipitation in winter, largely in the form of snow, than it does in summer. The reverse is true for the Pacific coast, where summer precipitation exceeds that of winter. In northern Hokkaido, snow falls an average of 130 days per year; along the Sea of Japan, 80 days; on the Pacific coast south and west of Tokyo Bay, only 10 days.\n\nJapan has rainy seasons in June and September, though there is some precipitation throughout the year. The main, June rainy season is called the baiu, or tsuyu, and has many days of continuous rain. The September rainy season is called the shurin. It is associated with occasional typhoons, tropical storms like the hurricanes of southeastern North America. These move to the north and northeast in a clockwise arc from their spawning grounds east of the Philippines. When they strike Japan, they cause destructive floods and landslides. However, the typhoons also restore water levels, which drop during the dry days of late summer.\n\nTyphoons bring roughly one-third of the rain that falls annually on the Pacific coast of Asia. In 1959 one of the worst typhoons of modern times tore through the city of Nagoya and across central Honshu. Approaching typhoons are carefully watched by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which issues special bulletins on their progress.\n\nSeasonal temperatures in Japan generally increase from north to south. Average January temperatures are 15 to 20 °F (–9 to –7 °C) in Hokkaido; 35 to 40 °F (2 to 4 °C) in central Honshu; and 45 °F (7 ° C) in southern Kyushu. There is little difference in winter temperatures between the west and east coasts, though the skies are more overcast on the west coast and clearer and sunnier on the east coast. Summers are hot and humid throughout Japan. July temperatures average 77 to 80 °F (25 to 27 °C) in Kyushu, Shikoku, and southern and central Honshu; 72 to 75 °F (22 to 24 °C) in northern Honshu; and a cooler 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) in Hokkaido.\n\nThe clear, hot weather of summer arrives in mid-July, following the baiu rains. It is ended by the shurin rains. The length of the frost-free, or growing, season ranges from 250 days or more along the Pacific coast south from Tokyo Bay to only 120 days in central Hokkaido. Early autumn frosts in northern Japan and late spring frosts in central and southern Japan pose a seasonal threat to farming.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nThe trees, shrubs, and flowering plants of Japan are as varied as its terrain and climate. Forests cover most of the land surface that has not been cleared by humans. Coniferous (cone-bearing), broad-leaved, and mixed forests are the three main types. Pine, cypress, hemlock, cedar, fir, and spruce are commercially valuable conifers. The numerous broad-leaved trees include oak, maple, ash, birch, beech, poplar, chestnut, and horse chestnut. Subtropical forms such as bamboo and palms grow as far north as central Honshu.\n\nMany native plant species have been destroyed or reduced by humans, and new species from the Asian mainland have been introduced. Virgin forests have been preserved in limited areas.\n\nJapan’s large mammals include bear, badger, otter, mink, deer, and fox. One monkey, the Japanese macaque, is found as far north as northern Honshu; the monkeys there are the northernmost monkeys in the world. The seas adjacent to Japan are the home of whales, porpoises, and dolphins. Japanese bird species include many water and wading birds, songbirds, hawks, pheasants, doves, owls, and woodpeckers. Among the reptiles are sea turtles, tortoises, lizards, and snakes. The sea abounds with hundreds of fish species. Salmon, sardine, sea bream, tuna, squid, mackerel, cod, and mullet are among the marine species caught by commercial fishers. Tropical varieties of fish accompany the warm waters of the Kuroshio as far north as Tokyo Bay. The raising of goldfish and colorful carp (koi) for decorative purposes is a Japanese specialty. Aquaculture, the commercial raising of certain fish, eels, and pearl oysters, is highly developed in Japan.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nJapan is the world’s tenth most populous country. Its population went beyond the 100 million mark in 1967 and surpassed 125 million in the late 20th century. Yet Japan’s rate of population increase slowed dramatically at the end of the 20th century and became essentially stagnant in the first decade of the 21st century. Japan now has one of the lowest population growth rates in the world.\n\nJapanese population data are incomplete for the period before 1868, when the country’s modern era began. However, the population of Japan is believed to have reached 5 million in the 7th century and 10 million in the 14th century. Official estimates placed the number of Japanese in the mid–19th century at more than 30 million. In 1920, when Japan’s first precise census was taken, the country had a population of nearly 56 million. In 1940, early in World War II, its population was about 72 million.\n\nJapan experienced a brief baby boom after World War II. Afterward, however, the country’s birthrate dropped from a high of 34 per 1,000 in 1947 to below 10 per 1,000 in 1997, 50 years later. This was one of the fastest declines ever observed in any country, though similar declines have taken place in other industrialized countries. Japan’s death rate also fell, largely because of improvements in public health measures, advances in medicine, and the greater availability of modern medical facilities. Japan’s life expectancy is now among the world’s highest.\n\nThe proportion of young people in Japan has thus been decreasing. Average family size has also been shrinking, in part because many young married couples have been establishing their own households instead of living with their parents in the traditional fashion. Another reason for this drop in family size is that young couples in Japan are having fewer children than in the past.\n\nMost of Japan’s people share the same ethnic and cultural background. The population consists almost entirely of ethnic Japanese. Koreans and Chinese, the largest non-Japanese groups in the country, each number more than 500,000. The Ainu, a native people of northern Japan, have been almost completely assimilated into the general population of the country. Another minority is the burakumin. The term means literally “hamlet people,” but this conceals their true status as descendants of outcasts—individuals who engaged in occupations that were declared ritually unclean, such as gravediggers, butchers, or leatherworkers. The burakumin are ethnically Japanese, but they are often victims of discrimination because of their low status in society.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe national language of Japan is Japanese, one of the world’s major languages. It is generally considered to belong to the Altaic language family. Japanese is thought to be most closely related to Korean, though the vocabularies differ.\n\nThe Japanese language has many dialects, and speakers of one dialect do not always understand everything a speaker of another dialect might say. But almost everyone in Japan uses standard Japanese as well as the dialect of his or her home area. Standard Japanese, originally the dialect spoken by the educated people of Tokyo, is now taught and understood throughout the country. Television, radio, and the Japanese educational system played prominent roles in standardizing the speech patterns of the population.\n\nBroadly speaking, the accent in Japanese is musical. To say “bridge” (hashi) in standard Japanese, the voice begins with a low pitch on ha and rises on shi. If the voice is high for ha and low for shi, the word means “chopsticks.” The pitch of a word can also change in a sentence. As a word, hi (fire) has a low pitch. But in the sentence Hi ga deta (“Fire has broken out”), the pitch pattern is high for hi and low for the rest of the sentence.\n\nIn Japanese, different styles of speech are used to show degrees of politeness and familiarity. A plain style is generally used in speaking to close friends. For strangers, a polite style may be used. To show honor and respect, a deferential style is often used toward parents, older people, teachers, and so on. Thus, when meeting a stranger for the first time, the Japanese are very concerned to determine appropriate social distinctions as soon as possible. Different styles are also used in talking about people and things. One such style, the exalted style, is almost entirely limited to references to the Japanese emperor and the imperial family.\n\nThe Japanese writing system is unique. More than 1,500 years ago, the Japanese adopted Chinese characters for writing the Japanese language. These characters are called kanji. Because Japanese is very different from Chinese, additional sets of symbols, called kana, were developed, each standing for a syllable rather than a separate consonant or vowel. There are two kinds of kana: hiragana and katakana. After World War II the Japanese government modified the system of writing. Kanji were reduced from many thousands of characters to about a couple thousand basic characters, and their forms were simplified. Many words are written with kanji only. Some words are written with kana (hiragana or katakana) only. And other words are written using both kanji and hiragana.\n\nMost Japanese writing is a mixture of kanji and kana. In newspapers and magazines, Japanese is usually printed from top to bottom, in columns running from right to left. But in many textbooks, Japanese is printed horizontally from left to right. In the Japanese culture, the surname, or family name, comes before a person’s given name.\n\nReligion\n\nMost Japanese are not members of any formal religion. However, their concerns with life after death tend to be Buddhist, and their participation in community activities often centers on Shinto celebrations. Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. Because Shinto and Buddhism focus on different aspects of a person’s life, most Japanese have no trouble following both Shinto and Buddhist practices.\n\nShinto is based on worship of numerous gods and spirits, including local spirits in nature. These gods and spirits are called kami. Among the many objects of worship in Shinto were the kami of the creator, the Moon, stars, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, seas, winds, fire, and some animals. People, commonly major historical figures, have also been enshrined as gods.\n\nMany of the Japanese ceremonies associated with the birth of a child and the rites of passage to adulthood are associated with Shinto. Shinto is valued because it creates a bond between the individual, his community, and his native land. Shinto shrines dot the Japanese landscape, and community festivals honoring local kami abound. Among the several shrines of national importance is the Grand Shrine of Ise, in southern Honshu. It is dedicated to the sun goddess Amaterasu, traditionally said to be the ancestor of the Japanese emperor and his family. Shinto was the state religion during part of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, Japan has no official religion.\n\nBuddhism arose in India and was introduced into Japan from Korea in the 6th century. Several major branches of Buddhism developed in Japan, including Zen Buddhism, which has maintained a large following. The largest branches of Japanese Buddhism today have come from those founded in the 13th century by monks such as Shinran and Nichiren. Shinran established the True Pure Land branch, while Nichiren founded Nichiren Buddhism. All branches of Buddhism teach that life continues after death, but each differs on how to find salvation. Buddhism was highly influential in early Japanese history for training the samurai, warriors who ruled the country. In contemporary Japan, Buddhist practices center around funerals and later memorial rites for deceased family members.\n\nConfucianism has been another important influence in Japan. Confucianism is a system of ethics for social relationships, not a religion. It originated in China during the 6th century bc and was introduced into Japan from Korea about the 6th century ad. Its ethical teachings were adopted primarily by the ruling elite. Centuries later, during a time called the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), Confucian principles of absolute obedience to one’s father and lord also greatly influenced the samurai. During World War II, Confucianism was used to arouse patriotism. After the war, Confucianism was excluded from the Japanese educational curriculum. Nevertheless, Japanese ethics and social behavior are still profoundly influenced by Confucianism. (See also Confucius.)\n\nA small percentage of Japanese are Christian. Christianity was introduced into Japan in the 16th century by Francis Xavier, a Spanish Jesuit priest. Starting in the 17th century, during the Tokugawa period, Japan limited foreign contacts and was suspicious of foreign ideas. Japanese Christianity was banned, and tens of thousands of Japanese Christians were killed. After Japan was opened to the West in the late 19th century, Christianity was reintroduced, mainly by Protestant missionaries. Japanese Christians tended to become involved in social welfare movements.\n\nUrban and Rural Settlement\n\nJapan is one of the world’s most densely populated countries, especially in its major cities. The bulk of Japan’s people live on the coastal lowlands, which make up a relatively small part of the country’s total area. Japan is also one of the most urbanized major countries in Asia. In 1920 more than four-fifths of Japan’s people still lived in rural areas. Today, however, about two-thirds of the Japanese live in cities.\n\nJapan’s greatest concentration of population is in a long belt that extends for a few hundred miles from Tokyo and the Kanto Plain westward along the Pacific coast. It stretches through Nagoya and Kyoto to Osaka and Kobe on the eastern edge of the Inland Sea and then as far west as the city of Fukuoka on northern Kyushu. Most of the Japanese cities with populations of more than 1 million are located in the area between Tokyo and Fukuoka. This area is home to more than half of the country’s total population. It is sometimes called the Pacific Belt Zone (Taihei-yo Beruto Chitai) or the Tokaido Megalopolis.\n\nThe Pacific Belt Zone contains the principal Japanese centers of industry, business, and finance and Japan’s major international ports. It provides most of the job opportunities for migrants from the farms and small towns of Japan. Virtually all the country’s leading educational institutions and cultural organizations are located within the Tokyo-Fukuoka belt. However, Japan’s difficulties in providing adequate housing, transportation, and social services of all kinds are greatest in this zone. The people of this zone face the problems that most inhabitants of great cities everywhere face—overcrowded housing, air and water pollution, and traffic congestion.\n\nTokyo, the capital, is Japan’s largest city. It is the heart of Greater Tokyo, the country’s largest metropolitan area by far. Greater Tokyo also includes Yokohama, Japan’s second largest city, as well as the populous city of Kawasaki. A two-hour commute to work is common for many residents of this vast metropolitan area. Greater Tokyo is the largest industrial, commercial, financial, and cultural center in Japan. A second major metropolitan cluster centers on Osaka and Kobe. It forms part of a large industrial zone that also includes Kyoto, an ancient center of Japanese culture. Other large industrial cities in the Pacific Belt Zone include Nagoya, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka. Saitama lies just north of Greater Tokyo. The largest Japanese cities outside the Pacific Belt Zone are the commercial centers of Sapporo, on Hokkaido, and Sendai, on northeastern Honshu.\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures—political subdivisions, called ken in Japanese. Outside the Pacific Belt Zone and the few other large metropolitan centers, many prefectures have been losing population through out-migration, especially since 1950. The heaviest losses have occurred in Honshu along the Sea of Japan coast and in rural areas north and west of Tokyo, in western and eastern Kyushu, and on Shikoku. Hokkaido, the northernmost large island, was an area of pioneer settlement until the 1930s. It has the lowest population density of any Japanese prefecture.\n\nDaily Life\n\nFor nearly 2,000 years a close relationship existed between Japan and China. During much of Japan’s history this relationship to China was that of pupil to teacher. As early as the 1st century ad, Japanese travelers visited the Chinese imperial court (the emperor’s official assembly of councilors and officers). They brought back cultural treasures that enriched Japanese life—Confucian ethics, a writing system, and Chinese literature, art, architecture, music, and methods of government. The Japanese then adapted these cultural forms, making them uniquely Japanese.\n\nIn the late 19th century the coming of the Industrial Revolution to Asia changed this relationship. Japan emerged from more than two centuries of self-imposed isolation, recognizing that industrialization was a means of gaining equality with the Western powers. Mastering Western techniques, it soon built factories and created a modern army and navy.\n\nJapan therefore modernized relatively rapidly. Yet there are still contrasts in the everyday life of the Japanese people. Especially striking are the contrasts between the more traditional countryside and the bustling urban centers.\n\nLife in the villages\n\nOnly a very small percentage of the Japanese people live in small farming villages called buraku. The way of life of these people has changed, but the traditional patterns established centuries ago can still be observed.\n\nRural homes are generally small by Western standards. Compared to the cramped apartments and the tiny houses typical of Japanese cities, however, they seem spacious. The walls are made of a clay-and-straw plaster. Kitchens traditionally had earthen floors, while the floors in the other rooms were covered with wood or reed mats.\n\nThe villagers usually live in households that include grandparents and grown sons with their families, as well as the farmer, his wife, and their younger children. When a farmer dies or grows old, his land is passed on to a son, traditionally the eldest. His other sons may inherit money and may stay on the farm. However, most enter occupations in the village or a city.\n\nThe chief family responsibilities involve work in the fields. Both men and women spend long days planting, tilling, and harvesting their crops. During the time in each growing season when the rice paddies (fields) are flooded, the people work knee-deep in water. Most farmers tend and harvest their crops using modern specialized farm machinery; nevertheless, intense hand-labor practices are still widely employed.\n\nThe women often work in the fields after they have finished their usual household tasks of cooking, cleaning, and gardening. Children go to school, and schoolwork is their major responsibility. They may help take care of younger brothers and sisters. Grandparents no longer able to do field work look after their grandchildren.\n\nAfter a hard day’s work, the entire family enjoys an evening bath. The large earthenware or cedar bathtub stands in a bathhouse or in the kitchen near the stove. A fire kindled beneath the tub keeps the water hot. Then each family member in turn—beginning with the father—washes and rinses thoroughly before getting into the tub. The water in the tub is used only for soaking since it is shared by all members of the family. On winter days the hot bath gives the farm family its first chance to get really warm.\n\nJapanese villagers are neighborly. The whole village may partake in a wedding or a funeral. All the women prepare food for a village celebration, and every family brings its share. Most village business is handled through agricultural cooperatives which help market the farmers’ produce.\n\nLife in the cities\n\nJapanese cities have modern housing, plumbing, and transportation systems. Many city dwellers live in high-rise apartment buildings and take commuter trains or buses to their jobs. The daily lives of city dwellers have been transformed by modern conveniences. Yet many traditional practices survive. Many city dwellers use public bathhouses, for example.\n\nTraditionally, Japanese parents have arranged their children’s marriages. In the cities today, however, few marriages are arranged, and few young couples live with their parents after marriage. Since many young men and women attend universities or work away from home, they have more opportunities to meet socially and to choose their own husbands and wives.\n\nEntertainment in the cities is not as dependent upon family activity as is that of the villages. Many people like to play a game called pachinko, similar to pinball, in special parlors that are like slot-machine arcades. Karaoke (literally “empty orchestra”) is a popular form of nightlife entertainment. It was invented in Japan in the 1970s. In karaoke, a device plays instrumental accompaniments to songs with the vocal tracks removed, permitting the user to sing the lead. Entertaining typically is not done at home, in part because of the small size of most Japanese homes and also because much of entertaining is business-related. The commercial landscape of most Japanese cities is among the most diverse and service-oriented in the world. All manner of food, Japanese or otherwise, can be found in the numerous restaurants. City dwellers can also attend a wide variety of theatrical performances and sports events.\n\nGrowing up in Japan\n\nWhen a baby is about seven days old, the child is named in a small ceremony. Friends and relatives attend, bringing gifts for the child. At the age of about one month, the child is taken to the nearest Shinto shrine. There the priest may record the name and birthday, and the child formally becomes a member of the community.\n\nA Japanese baby is often carried on the back of the mother, grandmother, or sister, safely fastened with broad sashes. The baby is given a great deal of loving attention. But from nursery school on, a child is trained in obedience. Spankings are rarely used, but a child may be ridiculed and shamed for acting badly.\n\nAfter World War II, the status of Japanese men and women began tending toward social equality. Prior to that time, boys and girls were treated very differently. Parents thought it so important to have sons to carry on the family name that boys were preferred and pampered. They could dominate their older sisters and even their mothers. Girls, on the other hand, had to defer not only to their elders but even to younger brothers. Both boys and girls were brought up with the obligation to do nothing to bring shame to the family reputation. However, parents expected their sons to achieve more than their daughters.\n\nJapanese boys are still often favored above their sisters and more is still expected of them. However, the difference in the treatment of boys and girls is not as great as it once was. Nevertheless, such inequalities as still exist have deep historical roots. Sons have traditionally been regarded as economic assets for the work they were expected to do. Moreover, sons—not daughters—would become responsible for caring for their elderly parents. Daughters would marry and leave the parental home to start their own families.\n\nIn a traditional arranged marriage, when a young man is 25 or even older, his family or work supervisor may take steps to find a suitable wife for him. The prospective couple is introduced, and if neither objects strongly to the proposed marriage, a go-between is chosen to make arrangements for the exchange of presents. Such arranged marriages are no longer as common as they once were. Even if a marriage is a love match, a family friend, relative, or mentor is still often chosen to act as a go-between.\n\nThe marriage ceremony in Japan commonly is a Shinto ceremony; the bride and groom take three sips of sake, a rice beer, from three cups. The bride wears the elaborate clothing and the complicated hairstyle that are traditional on this occasion. The marriage ceremony is usually followed by feasting and dancing. Now, couples often change to Western-style wedding attire for the reception following the wedding.\n\nThe Japanese mark a man’s entry into old age with a special ceremony that occurs between his 59th and 60th birthdays. At that time he dons a kimono in red, a color not usually worn by adult males, to signify that he has shed the responsibilities of maturity.\n\nMost Japanese funerals are marked by Buddhist rites. Virtually all Japanese are cremated. Japanese cemeteries have family memorial stones, at which the ashes are deposited. The deceased is formally remembered each week for seven weeks and then again at increasingly lengthened periods of time.\n\nInside a traditional Japanese home\n\nTraditional Japanese homes generally have a kitchen and three or four other rooms. The walls are lined with bamboo strips. The floors are covered with tatami, woven straw mats 6 feet by 3 feet (1.8 by 0.9 meters) in size. A room’s size is stated as the number of tatami required to cover the floor. Among the most common sizes are 41/2- and 6-tatami rooms. To keep the tatami clean, the Japanese remove their shoes when entering a house.\n\nMost houses perch on posts that are 2 feet (0.6 meter) high, set on rock foundations. A narrow porch on the sunny side serves as a hall onto which the rooms open. Permanent partitions are rare. Fusuma, or sliding screens made of paper-covered frames, may be closed to create separate rooms or opened to convert the entire house into a single room. Shoji, or sliding outer doors or windows, are pushed back on summer days to let in air and are shut for protection at night.\n\nThe light, open construction of such Japanese houses is well suited to a warm climate and to a region where earthquakes destroy heavier structures. However, these houses do not keep out the damp chill of winter. A hibachi (charcoal brazier) serves mainly as a hand warmer. Sometimes a heated table called a kotatsu is used. Quilts or futons are draped over the table to help trap the heat underneath. The family gathers around the table to warm their feet and legs under the table.\n\nFurniture in the Japanese home generally consists only of storage chests and low tables. In most homes the family sits on zabuton (low cushions) and sleeps on futons (cotton-filled mattresses). However, many city families have replaced the futon with beds. Both the zabuton and the futon are stored in wall closets when they are not being used, though they must be aired frequently to prevent mildew during the hot, humid summers.\n\nThe most important spot in the house is the tokonoma, an alcove containing a low platform that holds a flower arrangement. Above the platform hangs a painted scroll. When callers come, the most honored guest is seated near the tokonoma. Except for the embellished parchment doors between rooms, scrolls and flower arrangements are usually the only decoration found in Japanese homes.\n\nCarefully tended gardens demonstrate the Japanese love of nature. The rooms of a home often open onto a garden through a sliding door. Many Japanese gardens are actually miniature landscapes, with small trees, flowering bushes, pools, streams, and bridges.\n\nFood\n\nMost Japanese eat three meals a day. Boiled white rice (gohan), the mainstay of the Japanese diet for centuries, is eaten at almost every meal. However, rice consumption per capita has declined in favor of such Western staples as potatoes or bread. At breakfast rice is usually supplemented by misoshiru, a bean-paste soup, and tsukemono, pickled vegetables. In the cities, many Japanese have replaced these dishes with bread, butter, and eggs. Lunch is a light meal and may consist of tsukemono, salted fish, and tsukudani, seafood or vegetables cooked and preserved in soy sauce, in addition to rice or noodles.\n\nThe evening meal is the most important meal of the day. In most homes it includes vegetables and rice with fish, beef, pork, or chicken. Meat is usually cut into thin strips and fried. It has not been as central in the Japanese diet as in that of Western countries, but meat-eating increased in the late 20th century. Until the late 19th century, Buddhist practice discouraged eating the flesh of four-legged animals. Fish is often served raw. When served this way it is called sashimi. Sashimi is often included in sushi, cooked, vinegared rice served with a variety of garnishes and formed into various shapes.\n\nThe two most popular beverages in Japan are green tea and sake (rice beer), though coffee is also widely consumed. Tea is drunk during and after meals. It is also served to guests with such snacks as soba (buckwheat noodles) and udon (wheat noodles). Sake is served with meals, at dinner parties, and especially at celebrations such as weddings or holiday feasts.\n\nChopsticks are the only eating utensils for a traditional Japanese meal, whether formal or informal. Food is served in china or lacquer bowls and on dishes. On important occasions, individual trays are provided. Usually a Japanese family sits around a low table for meals. Western-style breakfasts probably predominate in Japan today. Western fast-food establishments are widespread.\n\nClothing\n\nModern Japanese dress incorporates both Eastern and Western styles. Western clothes, worn by both men and women, are virtually universal. The traditional kimono, a loose-fitting garment with wide sleeves, is now worn principally at home or on certain special occasions. Men’s kimonos differ from women’s primarily in color and fabric. Women wear their kimonos at ankle length, bound with a sash called an obi. Men’s kimonos are shorter and on very formal occasions are worn with a wide, divided skirt called a hakama. A kimono-shaped cloak called a haori may be worn over a kimono by both sexes.\n\nThe Japanese usually wear shoes like those worn in Western countries. However, geta, or wooden clogs, and zori, or rubber or straw sandals, are still worn with kimonos. Socks called tabi are worn with geta and zori. The tabi have a separate place for the big toe—the geta or zori strap is held between it and the other toes. Japanese now wear Western hairstyles. The elaborate hairstyles Japanese women formerly wore are now used only at weddings or by entertainers in the theater and hostesses at certain restaurants.\n\nSports and recreation\n\nCompetitive sports have a wide following among the Japanese. Baseball—with two professional leagues—is one of Japan’s most popular spectator sports. Many baseball stars, notably Oh Sadaharu, have ranked among the country’s best-known celebrities. Soccer (association football) has grown considerably in popularity in Japan, to the point of rivaling baseball. A Japanese professional soccer league was established in 1993, and there are numerous youth leagues. Japan’s national soccer team has made strong showings in international competition. With South Korea, Japan cohosted the World Cup soccer finals in 2002. Other sports enjoyed by the Japanese include basketball, lawn and table tennis, volleyball, bicycling, and swimming.\n\nJapanese athletes have excelled in many sports at the Olympic Games. They have been especially strong in gymnastics and judo competitions. The country hosted the Summer Games in 1964 at Tokyo; it was the first time the Olympics had been held in Asia. Tokyo was chosen to host the Summer Games again in 2020. Japan also hosted the Winter Games twice—at Sapporo in 1972 and at Nagano in 1998.\n\nThe Japanese pursue a great variety of indoor and outdoor recreational, fitness, and sports activities. People in Japan tend to go on frequent family outings. Parents take their children to shrines and temples and to parks and zoos or on excursions into the country to view the spring cherry blossoms or the autumn foliage. The Japanese are also fond of playing board and card games, notably shogi and go (both similar to chess), and mah-jongg.\n\nThe martial arts in Japan originated with medieval warriors, the samurai, who mastered at least one or two of them for use in battle. Today they are practiced as competitive sports and as aids to physical and mental fitness. The martial arts were traditionally acquired through the family, but schools to teach them now thrive in Japan.\n\nSumo is one of the country’s most popular sports. Professional sumo matches between two huge wrestlers dressed only in mawashi, or loincloths, are held in rings of sand. The actual bout is preceded by a ritual during which the wrestlers face each other, squatting and touching the ground with their fists. The match does not begin until both wrestlers come up at the same time. It ends only when a wrestler has been pushed out of the ring or when any part of a wrestler’s body except his feet touches the ground. Several professional sumo tournaments are held each year in Japan. A grand champion wrestler is called yokozuna.\n\nJudo, another martial art form, developed from jujitsu, an art of self-defense that was popular during the Tokugawa period. The objective of the sport of judo is to cleanly throw, to pin, or to master the opponent. Mastering the opponent is done by applying pressure to arm joints or to the neck to cause the opponent to yield. Techniques are generally intended to turn an opponent’s force to one’s own advantage rather than to oppose it directly. Different colored belts are worn to indicate degrees of mastery in judo.\n\nAikido also resembles jujitsu and judo in its use of twisting and throwing techniques. It too shares the aim of turning an attacker’s strength and momentum to one’s own advantage. Pressure on vital nerve centers is also used. Aikido especially emphasizes the importance of achieving complete mental calm and control of one’s own body to master an opponent’s attack. It does not require great muscular strength. Aikido is practiced in part to enhance body flexibility and to foster graceful movement.\n\nKarate evolved in East Asia over a period of centuries and was developed into a system in Okinawa in the 17th century. Only in the 20th century, however, did it gain wide popularity. Karate involves jabbing, hitting, and kicking at the most vulnerable parts of the opponent’s body. Emphasis is on concentrating as much of the body’s power as possible at the point of impact. The striking surfaces of the body, including the hands and feet, are toughened by practice blows against padded surfaces or wood.\n\nKendo developed in ancient Japan. In kendo, two opponents hit or jab at each other with bamboo swords. Both wear protective masks, bamboo armor, leg padding, and thick gloves. In a match, a point is given to the fencer who makes a clean hit on the opponent’s throat, head, body, or wrist. The first to make two points is declared the winner.\n\nKyudo, or archery, was used in early Japan for fishing and hunting. Later it became a military art. In medieval times, samurai displayed their skill as bowmen in exhibitions. After the introduction of firearms in the 16th century, however, kyudo declined as an effective technique of combat and became a sport. Kyudo archers use a bow about 7.5 feet (2–3 meters) long. The bow is made of wood glued to bamboo. Arrows consist of a bamboo shaft, three feathers, and an arrowhead. Each archer in a match usually shoots 10 to 20 arrows.\n\nLiterature and the Arts\n\nLiterature\n\nPoetry plays a central role in Japanese culture. Occasions of many kinds are celebrated with poems, and thousands of poems are submitted for the poetry prize awarded by the emperor each New Year’s. Many Japanese compose short poems such as haiku and tanka. Japanese poems, which usually do not rhyme, are based on a syllable count. A haiku is a three-line poem of 17 syllables, with 5 syllables in the first line, 7 syllables in the second, and 5 syllables in the third. A tanka has five lines, with 5, 7, 5, 7, and 7 syllables. Because haiku and tanka are short, they can only suggest a mood or a picture; the listener or reader has to fill in the details. Basho, who has been regarded by many as Japan’s greatest poet, was a master of haiku. A notable tanka poet was Ki Tsurayuki, one of Japan’s “36 poetic immortals.”\n\nJapanese literature is noted for distinctive forms of drama as well as of poetry. The Noh, or No, play combines recitation, music, and slow dance. It is noted for its fine poetry, which is chanted by the actors and chorus. Japan’s outstanding Noh dramatists were Zeami and his father, Kan’ami Kiyotsugu.\n\nLike the Noh play, the Japanese puppet play is serious drama combining words, music, and dancing. Perhaps the greatest writer of puppet drama, called Bunraku, was Chikamatsu Monzaemon. His plays fall into two groups. His heroic plays are often set in Japan’s Middle Ages. His domestic tragedies—for example, Double Suicide at Amijima—give a naturalistic picture of middle-class life.\n\nFor elaborate spectacle, Kabuki drama has no rival. Kabuki plays are distinguished by sensationalism and melodrama. One of the most famous Kabuki plays is Chushingura, about 47 samurai who avenge their lord’s death and then commit seppuku, or hara-kiri (ritual suicide; self-disembowelment), as required by the law of the time. (See also “Performing Arts” later in this section.)\n\nJapanese prose works tend to be series of loosely connected episodes. Diaries and books of random thoughts, which lend themselves to this style, are typical of Japanese prose literature. Early Japanese novels consisted of series of incidents, each incident built around a poem. Perhaps the greatest work of Japanese literature is The Tale of Genji, an episodic novel written near the beginning of the 11th century by Murasaki Shikibu, a woman who was a courtier to the Japanese empress. Most of the works of the 17th-century writer Ihara Saikaku, the outstanding novelist of the Tokugawa period, are really collections of short stories based on a single theme. In many modern novels it is common to find loosely related incidents.\n\nVisual arts\n\nThe visual arts of modern Japan are similar to those of many Western countries. However, Japanese classical works of art are unique in the philosophy, methods, and materials used in their creation. These works include paintings and sculptures, as well as products of the decorative arts, such as pottery and porcelains, lacquers, textiles, and woodcuts. Delicacy and exquisiteness of form, together with simplicity, characterize traditional Japanese artistic taste.\n\nPainting\n\nIn classical Japanese painting, black ink and watercolors were used on tissue-thin silk or washi (Japanese paper). Often the artist used only black ink, achieving a sense of color in the gradations from deep, luminous black to silvery gray. One-color paintings made in this way are called suiboku-ga or sumi-e.\n\nAlthough classical Japanese paintings were realistic, they were never photographic. Instead, the artist used only a few brushstrokes to suggest the crumbly texture of a boulder; a hard-edged, rocky cliff; the gnarled trunk and rustling foliage of a tree; the feathers of a bird; or an ocean wave. Unpainted areas of silk or paper created a sense of space and depth. Through economy of line and careful composition, the artist presented a distillation of his subject, leaving the viewer to fill in the details.\n\nClassical Japanese paintings were “studio pictures.” The artist did not go into the countryside with paints and easel. Instead, following a walk in the hills or along a stream, he returned to his studio to paint his impressions. The paintings usually took the form of hanging scrolls called kakemono, hand scrolls called emakimono, large folding screens, sliding doors, or fans. The hand scrolls, often 30 feet (9 meters) or more in length, are unrolled from right to left. With such scrolls, one enjoys only as much of the painting at a time as may be exposed between one’s outstretched hands.\n\nAfter Buddhism was introduced in Japan in the mid-6th century, great temples were built. These served not only as religious shrines but also as centers of art and learning. The numerous deities of Buddhism were depicted in paintings and sculptures. Artists, governed by precise descriptions in the sutras, or holy texts, created likenesses of the Buddha, his disciples, and minor deities, as well as complex, maplike representations of gods surrounding a central Buddha. These figures were painted or carved to embellish the temples and instruct the devout. Long, narrative hand scrolls record in fine line and rich color the lives, journeys, and campaigns of important Buddhist priests and nobles. The names of most early painters, many of them priests, are no longer known.\n\nSuiboku-ga developed rapidly during the Muromachi period (1338–1573) of Japanese art. It was fostered by Zen Buddhism, which stressed simplicity. While Japan was subjected over the centuries to successive waves of influence from China, the artists assimilated the foreign styles and in almost every instance made them uniquely their own.\n\nDuring the Muromachi period and the Momoyama period (1574–1600), distinctive schools of painting emerged and individual artists established their fame. The Buddhist monk Sesshu perfected black-and-white landscape painting in the Chinese tradition. The Kano school was founded by Kano Masanobu (1434–1530). He was the official court painter for the shoguns (military rulers of Japan). His school was continued by his family and developed into a distinctively Japanese style.\n\nFolding screens and sliding door panels were created in rich colors and patterns, often on a ground of gold or silver. They were made to enliven the austere grandeur of 16th- and 17th-century castle interiors. The creators of these works were called “the great decorators.” The Kano school remained dominant well into the Tokugawa period (1603–1867). It shared favor with traditional Chinese-style ink painting as well as a new artistic style called ukiyo-e, paintings depicting the life of common people.\n\nWoodcuts\n\nA woodcut, or wood-block print, is a print made by carving a picture into a wooden block, inking the block, and then pressing it against paper. Japanese woodcuts were made as early as the 11th century. However, this art form enjoyed its greatest popularity in Japan from the mid-17th through the 19th century. The earliest woodcuts, which portrayed Buddhist leaders and deities, were executed in black with strong, rhythmic lines and areas of simple pattern. Occasionally, rich red-oranges, mustard yellows, and greens were added by hand. Early color prints, developed about 1740, were also restricted to three colors. True color prints, using many wood blocks, were developed in 1765. These color prints were called nishiki-e, meaning “brocade pictures.” A print bears the name of the artist who designed it. The carving and printing, however, were done by two other craftsmen.\n\nJapanese woodcuts are probably the finest expression of the ukiyo-e movement. Courtesans, Kabuki actors, and scenes from Kabuki dramas were popular subjects. Hishikawa Moronobu is credited with beginning the ukiyo-e tradition of printmaking in the 17th century. The era of the full-color print starts with the work of Suzuki Harunobu in the mid-18th century. The early 19th century brought both the full maturity and the gradual degeneration of this art form. The mid-19th century landscape artists Hokusai and Hiroshige were the last outstanding woodcut artists of the ukiyo-e. In the 20th century a modern movement in printmaking developed, called sosaku hanga (creative prints). The use of woodcuts has generally been neglected by modern printmakers.\n\nSculpture\n\nJapanese sculpture of the pre-Buddhist period is perhaps best represented by the clay cylinders or hollow sculptures called haniwa. Haniwa date from the 3rd to the 5th century ad. These images of red clay were sometimes elaborately modeled in the forms of animals, birds, and human figures. They were placed fencelike around tomb mounds of the imperial family and important court figures. The haniwa thus seem to have served the dual function of preventing soil erosion and providing the deceased with objects they had enjoyed during their lives.\n\nFollowing the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the 6th century, the development of sculpture paralleled that of painting. Numerous icons—religious images—depicted the growing number of Buddhist deities. Sculpture closely followed earlier Chinese examples that had been transmitted to Japan through Korea. Important images were cast in bronze, though wood was also favored. In later periods, wood and clay were increasingly preferred, as was dry lacquer. Dry lacquer consisted of successive coats of lacquer (colored varnish) applied to cloth over a clay or wood core. This core was later removed. Stone was almost never used in sculpture. Most of the best surviving sculptures were made by unknown masters.\n\nStarting in the 8th century, a noteworthy tendency was the portraitlike quality of much of the sculpture. This may in part be attributed to the growing preference for the dry-lacquer technique, which allowed greater inventiveness on the part of the artist. The finished product was light but durable. An innovation in wood sculpture—the use of small blocks ingeniously fitted together, rather than a single block or log—also provided the artist with greater freedom of expression.\n\nJapanese sculpture reached its peak during the Kamakura period (1192–1333). Although distinctive pieces were made in later eras, sculpture never again attained the position it had enjoyed in the preceding seven centuries. Most of the important sculptures have remained in the temples for which they were created.\n\nDecorative arts\n\nThe best-known Japanese decorative arts include the making of pottery, porcelains, lacquers, and textiles. The earliest examples of Japanese artistic expression are earthenware vessels of the Jomon (rope-patterned) period and the later, but still ancient, Yayoi period. Some Jomon specimens date as far back as about 10,500 bc. The style continued until about the 3rd century bc, when it was supplanted by the more finely executed Yayoi style.\n\nThe process of making true porcelain was not introduced into Japan until the 16th century ad. Elegantly patterned products found favor with the nobility and court circles. By contrast, native rough pottery enjoyed great popularity in intellectual circles and was especially favored for use in the tea ceremony.\n\nMany well-known painters also applied their skills to allied arts. Hon’ami Koetsu, famed for his calligraphy, or decorative writing, was also a gifted potter and lacquer designer. Ogata Kenzan executed in pottery the designs of his brother Ogata Korin, who was renowned for bold, decorative paintings.\n\nThe dry-lacquer technique was used not only for sculpture but also for decorative accessories such as trays, tables, small chests, containers for tea and candy, and sumptuously fitted picnic boxes. Sprinklings of gold and silver powder and burnished and cut-gold foil were used, alone or combined with inlays of shell, mother-of-pearl, or metal. These bright touches provided a bold contrast to the red, black, brown, and green lacquer surfaces.\n\nThe 18th- and 19th-century love of splendor and rich decoration was also expressed in handsomely brocaded silks favored by the Japanese court and clergy. The latter, under vows of poverty, cut brocades into small squares and pieced them together again so that their fine garments would simulate the patched clothing of leaner years. Even the simple folk designs worn by the poor reflected the taste of Japanese weavers.\n\nArchitecture and gardens\n\nJapanese architecture, like painting and sculpture, made its greatest advances following the introduction of Buddhism. As with sculpture, wood was the primary material. The design of traditional Japanese architecture emphasizes horizontal lines. Even in taller structures such as pagodas, the use of sloping roofs helps minimize the impression of height.\n\nGreat temples and monasteries and feudal castles and palaces are the major architectural monuments. The temples are characterized by vast halls and soaring roofs. Based on Chinese examples, the temples and storied pagodas feature elaborate bracketing systems to support their roofs.\n\nMajor constructions mirror the taste of the periods that produced them. Horyu Temple near Nara reflects the simple elegance favored in the 7th century. It is Japan’s oldest surviving wooden temple, in a region known for many such national treasures. The Tosho Shrine in Nikko illustrates the rich and showy decoration of the Tokugawa period (1603–1867).\n\nSecular (nonreligious) architecture of nearly all periods reveals the Japanese love for refined simplicity. Interior and exterior finishes depend on the fine grain of wood and textured stucco.\n\nHandsome gardens are created to so complement the buildings they surround that the landscape and structures appear to be part of one another. Moss, trees, pebbles and rocks may be combined with artificial hills, ponds, and a stream to suggest the natural beauty of a lake, seascape, or mountain waterfall. Profound simplicity is achieved in the garden of Ryoan Temple in Kyoto, for example, by the use of five artfully placed rock formations set in moss in a patterned field of white sand. Whatever its proportions or the materials used, the Japanese garden is designed to invite entry and inspire meditation.\n\nInterior decoration and home arts\n\nThe art of raising bonsai—dwarfed potted trees—has enabled the Japanese to admire nature in an indoor setting. Bonsai are able to bear fruit and to drop their leaves in season, thus reproducing nature in miniature. A skillful bonsai artist can prune, bend, and shape branches to suggest trees standing tall and upright in a field or bent and gnarled by age or weather. The beauty of a natural landscape is evoked in the viewer’s imagination.\n\nAnother means of enjoying nature in the home is through the arrangement of flowers, which has been refined in Japan to an art known as ikebana. Unlike Western floral arrangements, which emphasize the color and form of flowers, ikebana favors the flowing lines of stems, leaves, and branches.\n\nIn any arrangement, the plant materials used must convey a feeling of continuing growth as well as be symbolic of time and the season. Full blossoms might suggest the past; buds, the future. A full and spreading arrangement of various blossoms or other plant materials might suggest summer; a sparse one, autumn. A graceful floral design and a symbolic ornamental scroll often decorate the alcove called the tokonoma, the place of honor in a Japanese home.\n\nCha-no-yu, the ceremonial art of making tea, is a notable discipline in Japan. The tea ceremony is founded on the reverence of the beautiful in the daily routine of life. Through the delicate flavor of the tea and the simplicity of the ceremony, participants in the ritual hope to achieve serenity and an understanding of true beauty.\n\nCalligraphy\n\nTurning handwriting into an art form is called calligraphy. Chinese writing and literary classics probably arrived in Japan in the 4th century ad. Three centuries later Japanese scholars started traveling to China to study. It was Buddhist monks especially, both Chinese and Japanese, who brought calligraphy to Japan and made it into a fine art. Among the first practitioners of the art were the priests of Zen Buddhism.\n\nIn time, the Japanese departed from reliance on Chinese patterns and created their own, in a script called hiragana. This became the most distinctive Japanese type of calligraphy, though the use of Chinese characters, called kanji, persisted. In one kind of hiragana, the letters are written together, without a break, and spacing plays a large role. In another style, hiragana and kanji are used together. Japanese calligraphy is a very demanding art that requires many years of training. Calligraphy was not confined to the Buddhist monks, however. Some of the most adept calligraphers were emperors and warriors.\n\nPerforming arts\n\nThe Japanese have great respect for their ancient, traditional performing arts. At the same time they are attracted by new, more modern forms. As a result, a Japanese person who enjoys a performance of bugaku, an ancient musical dance of the imperial court, may also take pleasure in a concert of contemporary Western music played by an excellent Japanese symphony orchestra.\n\nOne reason for the vitality of the performing arts in Japan is that performance is an essential part of the country’s life. The ceremonies of the native Shinto religion include music and dance. A Japanese wanting to honor the gods pays for a performance of the sacred dance kagura at a shrine. During the Bon festival, a Buddhist celebration for the souls of the dead, the young people of a community participate in folk dances in a circle around a drum tower. In summer festivals, groups of young men carrying a portable shrine dance and chant through the city streets. All such dances are related to the Japanese love and worship of nature.\n\nRhythm, singing, and chanting can also be part of everyday work in Japan—pulling a net from the sea, felling timber, even erecting a telephone pole. Ancient music and dance accompany the planting and harvesting of rice.\n\nThe Japanese performing arts differ greatly from those of the West. Dancing, acting, and instrumental and vocal music are closely combined. In any traditional Japanese stage performance, it is difficult to say where the dancing stops and the acting begins. Moreover, traditional Japanese music does not use Western keys and scales. The drums, stringed instruments, and flutes produce sounds not usually heard from Western instruments. However, the koto, a Japanese harp, comes close to sounding like a Western instrument. Traditional Japanese singing uses a different system of voice production than that of the West, and the traditional dance employs patterns of body movement unfamiliar in the West. A traditional Japanese actor does not think he should look like a real person when he is performing.\n\nFrom his youth, the Japanese performing artist is trained in the strict imitation of his teacher. This method insures that traditional techniques of performance are preserved in a continuous, almost unchanged, artistic heritage.\n\nBefore 1640, foreign influences on the Japanese performing arts came only from the Asian mainland. But, as is typical in Japan, the borrowed materials were refined into a principally Japanese expression.\n\nGagaku and bugaku\n\nClassical gagaku music was introduced into Japan from China as early as the 6th century ad. It combined musical forms absorbed from Korea, Manchuria (now in China), Persia (Iran), India, and Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). Gagaku merged with Japanese music about 850. Wind, stringed, and percussion instruments are used in gagaku performances, which are known as kangen when performed without dance.\n\nWhen gagaku is accompanied by dance, it is called bugaku. A single dancer or one or more pairs of dancers perform with great symmetry of movement. The dancers wear masks, and the positions of their arms, hands, and feet are highly stylized. The dances may be slow or lively, depending on whether they are ceremonial dances, military dances, or dances for children. A bugaku may tell a story, but the story is generally not learned from a view of the dance alone.\n\nNoh plays\n\nThe medieval dance drama called Noh (or No) can be considered as scenes from the ceremonial life of lords and ladies during Japan’s Middle Ages. Noh theater was derived in part from Chinese sources. Actors in Noh plays perform on a usually bare stage about 18 feet (5.5 meters) square and on a narrow runway leading to the stage from the dressing room. They are accompanied by drums, a high-pitched flute, and chanting by a chorus of six or eight men. All parts, including female roles, are played by men and boys. The mood of these plays usually is serious and often is tragic.\n\nThere are only two important roles in Noh theater—the shite, or principal character, and the waki, or subordinate character. Both the shite and the waki wear handsomely embroidered costumes patterned upon medieval court dress. The shite usually wears a painted mask carved from wood. Joy, sorrow, or anger may be represented by slightly changing the position of the mask on the actor’s face. Different masks are used to represent men, women, elderly persons, gods, and demons. In most of the 230 Noh plays performed in Japan today, the shite changes his costume and mask for the second half of the performance to reveal his true character. He may change, for example, from a beautiful woman to a demon or from a boy to a warrior. Often, the waki is a Buddhist priest and the shite is the ghost of a person who is suffering for evil he committed during his lifetime. In these plays, the shite seeks and obtains help from the priest for the peace of his soul.\n\nA Noh performance neither looks nor sounds like real life. Movement is extremely slow. If the play requires, for example, a boat or a hut, such things are represented by a skeletal framework that only suggests their shape. A folding fan in the hands of an actor may represent a variety of objects—a sword, a letter, the rising moon, or falling rain. The text is ancient poetry, difficult even for many Japanese to understand.\n\nThe traditional Noh program consisted of five plays with short comic pieces called kyogen performed between them. The first Noh play was usually about a god, the second about a warrior, and the third about a woman. The fourth type of play varied in content; it could be a realistic, contemporary play, for example. The fifth type dealt with demons and other supernatural beings. The usual program now, however, consists of three plays, each lasting an hour or longer, and two kyogen. The kyogen are a complete contrast to the serious Noh plays, for they are acted vigorously and amusingly and deal with such matters as servants outwitting their masters or husbands their wives.\n\nBunraku\n\nToward 1700 a new form of theater appeared in Osaka. Called Bunraku, it combines the manipulation of puppets with a narrative accompanied by music. The music is played on the samisen, a three-stringed, banjo-shaped, plucked instrument. Each puppet is about half life-size and is handled by a team of three men in a fashion unique to Japan. By means of strings inside the puppet’s head, the chief manipulator controls the movable mouth, eyebrows, and eyelids, as well as the right arm and hand of the doll. His assistants animate the rest of the puppet. The operators are silent but visible to the audience throughout the play.\n\nUnlike the Noh stage, the Bunraku stage uses elaborate scenery and various techniques and devices for changing scenes rapidly. At one side of the stage are seated one or more samisen players and the narrator. The narrator chants both the descriptive passages and the spoken words of all the characters. Such precise coordination and teamwork is demanded among the operators, the musician, and the narrator that they must all have many years of training.\n\nBunraku developed two kinds of plays. Jidaimono deals with historical subjects and the warrior class, while sewamono is concerned with the life of the commoner. Some of the greatest Japanese dramatists wrote Bunraku plays. Among them was Chikamatsu Monzaemon, widely regarded as one of Japan’s greatest dramatists. Another was Takeda Izumo, whose Chushingura (1748) is a popular play in both the Bunraku and Kabuki theaters. Its theme—unswerving loyalty to a master—is a common one in the puppet theater.\n\nBunraku declined in popularity after the mid-1700s. Today, it is regarded as a “cultural property” by the Japanese government, which helps to support it. UNESCO proclaimed Bunraku, as well as Kabuki, to be a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nKabuki\n\nA form of Japanese theater using live actors, Kabuki began about the same time as Bunraku. It originated in Kyoto with new kinds of dances performed by a woman named Okuni in the early 1600s. These became highly popular, and Okuni was imitated by other actresses and actors. But the Japanese government, deciding that the performances were immoral, decreed in 1629 that women could no longer appear on the stage. Women’s roles were taken over by men, and this practice continues in modern Kabuki theater.\n\nA typical Kabuki program may include a dance play based upon a Noh play or a kyogen; a dance play adapted from part of a puppet-theater jidaimono; and acts from plays written especially for the Kabuki in the 18th and 19th centuries. No important Kabuki plays were written after 1900, and this theater is in many ways a living museum of the Japanese performing arts. It is now based in Tokyo theaters and attracts large audiences.\n\nThe performance of a Kabuki program requires highly skilled actors, often trained from childhood in dance, voice, and acrobatics. Kabuki actors are capable of playing a wide variety of parts, including female roles. An actor who plays the part of a woman is called an onnagata. Among the Kabuki characters are horses, foxes, dogs, and demons, all played by actors.\n\nKabuki visual effects are varied, spectacular, and often quite colorful. Huge settings change on a revolving stage in plain view of the audience. Scenery and actors rise from or disappear into the stage floor on elevators. Actors perform portions of the program in the midst of the audience on the hanamichi, a runway about 6 feet (1.8 meters) wide extending from the rear of the auditorium to the stage. Music, most frequently that of the samisen, is used throughout. The musicians perform either on the stage or in a room at the side of it.\n\nIn some Kabuki plays the actors wear striking white, red, and black makeup to create the effect of power and strength. Elaborate costumes, which are often changed on stage, may weigh as much as 50 pounds (22 kilograms). Masses of warriors dance and somersault in scenes of battle. The dramatic poses of an actor are accompanied by the beating of wooden clappers on the stage.\n\nWestern art forms\n\nThe Japanese have also fully embraced Western art forms. Western-style painting, sculpture, and architecture are widely practiced. Western classical music, which has been taught in Japanese schools since the 1870s, is as popular as the traditional music of ancient Japan. Many Japanese cities have permanent orchestras and thriving musical conservatories. Numerous concert halls for Western classical music have been built throughout Japan since the 1980s. In addition, the works of contemporary Japanese composers trained in Western music, such as Takemitsu Toru and Mayuzumi Toshiro, have been played in Europe and the United States. Japanese classical performers, including conductor Seiji Ozawa and violinist Goto Midori, also have built reputations abroad.\n\nMotion pictures have been another Western influence on the Japanese performing arts. Filmmaking in Japan began early in the 20th century with screen adaptations of traditional literary masterpieces and Kabuki drama. The cinematic art declined in Japan during the war years of the 1930s and 1940s. After World War II many Japanese films became internationally famous for their artistic and technical quality. Kurosawa Akira’s Rashomon won the grand prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1951. Other internationally acclaimed Japanese directors include Ozu Yasujiro, Mizoguchi Kenji, and Itami Juzo.\n\nCultural institutions\n\nThe national government’s Agency for Cultural Affairs is responsible for promoting different aspects of Japanese culture. It also preserves cultural properties and historical sites throughout the country. Most of Japan’s major cultural institutions, including the Japan Academy, the Tokyo National Museum, and the National Theatre, are located in Tokyo. Japan’s numerous Buddhist temples contain a great many cultural properties as well, especially those located in Kyoto and Nara. There also are numerous private museums, art galleries, theaters, and gardens throughout the country. Japanese department stores offer free or low-cost exhibitions.\n\nEducation and Health\n\nEducation\n\nJapan’s school-age children attend school regularly. Attendance is compulsory for nine years, from elementary school through middle school. However, virtually all Japanese also attend kindergarten and high school. Kindergarten lasts from one to three years. At age 6, children begin elementary school; at 12, middle school; and at 15, high school. High school offers either a technical or a college preparatory course of instruction.\n\nJapanese schooling stresses memorization and group activities. Memorization is necessary because of the complexity of the written Japanese language and because the main goal of schooling is for students to do well on competitive examinations. Individualism and creativity have not generally been encouraged: a traditional Japanese saying states that “the nail that stands out will be pounded down.” This bias against individualism has begun eroding, however, as Japanese society begins to value individual initiative and originality.\n\nJapanese students, especially those who plan to attend college, take entrance examinations in order to qualify for the best middle schools and, later, the best high schools in the country. Rigorous study at one of the top schools helps the student prepare for the extremely difficult college entrance examinations. These examinations are given once a year. If a high school senior fails the entrance examinations, the student may study furiously at a special cram school during the following year and then retake the exams. Despite the examination system, a high percentage of Japanese youth attend colleges, either junior colleges or four-year universities.\n\nGreater Tokyo has a high concentration of the country’s universities. Of note is Tsukuba Science City, located about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo, which consists of research facilities and educational institutions. The most prestigious of Japan’s schools are the two great public universities of Tokyo and Kyoto. Prominent private institutions include Waseda and Keio universities in Tokyo and Doshisha University in Kyoto.\n\nHealth\n\nJapan has a high standard of living, which contributes much to the general good health of the Japanese people. In addition, the country has one of the most comprehensive health care systems in the world. National health insurance covers all Japanese citizens. The amount individuals have to contribute to this insurance varies by income; some people do not have to pay anything for their medical care. Most of the country’s hospitals are operated by unions, associations, or individuals and the remainder by local governments and the national government.\n\nEconomy\n\nJapan experienced astonishing economic growth in the 20th century. The term economic miracle is often used to describe the remarkable expansions in manufacturing and trade that the Japanese people achieved in the first several decades after World War II. After the war, Japan’s economy was in ruins. However, the country rapidly became an economic powerhouse. The “miracle” came to an end in 1990, when a serious economic downturn began. Japan then experienced more than two decades of a faltering or greatly slowed economy. Nevertheless, the Japanese economy remains one of the world’s largest. Japan has developed a highly diversified economy based on manufacturing and services, including trade. The country is one of the world’s largest producers of motor vehicles, steel, and high-technology manufactured goods—notably consumer electronics.\n\nTrade is important in the Japanese economy, in part because Japan lacks the natural resources to support its industries. It must import large amounts of fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal as well as raw materials for manufacturing. In addition, the country has only limited amounts of land good for farming. Japan thus needs to import much of its food supply. However, the country exports large volumes of manufactured goods, giving it a favorable trade balance. By adding value to raw materials as they are turned into finished products, Japan’s economy has grown despite shortages in natural resources.\n\nBackground\n\nBy the end of World War II in 1945, Japan’s cities and factories were rubble. Goods of all kinds, including food, were scarce. Inflation was running more than 100 percent a year. For several years after the war, a process of rebuilding was needed before genuine economic growth could begin. The economic transformation began about 1949, and it led to spectacular growth.\n\nPrior to World War II there had been close cooperation between government bureaucracies and the business sector. The U.S. occupation of Japan after the war sought to democratize the economy. Under the Americans, a number of land and labor reforms were carried out. Many Japanese farmers were able to own their own farmland for the first time. The Americans also broke up some of the powerful zaibatsu, Japanese business concerns like cartels that had come to dominate the economy.\n\nWith the economy in shambles after World War II, the Japanese government was the only institution strong enough to organize and plan for the country. Direction of the economy was not left just to the business sector. It was a deliberate national policy, a cooperative effort of government, business, labor, and the people—based on national purpose and supported by an excellent school system. But the chief guidance, at least initially, came from the government bureaucracies. Many Japanese bureaucrats who had guided the war mobilization were allowed by the U.S. occupation forces to assume positions of authority in the Japanese government after the war. They became leaders in ministries of trade, industry, and finance, in the Bank of Japan, and in other policy-making institutions.\n\nOne factor contributing to Japanese economic growth was the Cold War; animosity developed between the United States and the Soviet Union after 1947. The U.S. occupation forces realized that building a strong and productive Japan would be to the advantage of the United States as a counterforce to Soviet expansionism. The United States provided military protection to Japan. Only a small percentage of Japan’s budget was thus needed to pay for defense, freeing up more funds for economic investment. The United States also proved a generous export market to which Japanese industries could send their merchandise. Moreover, the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 created a huge demand for Japanese goods, as the United States used Japan as a military base. This increased demand for Japanese products set off an investment drive that laid the foundations for a long period of extraordinary economic activity.\n\nAnother vital ingredient of Japan’s economic growth was the Japanese willingness to borrow and learn. Japan had been borrowing ideas for industrialization from the United States and Europe since the 1860s. In the late 19th century Japan worked energetically to catch up with the industrialized countries, in order to be counted as an equal among world powers. After World War II, Japanese bureaucracies and businesspeople listened willingly to those who would teach them how to improve productivity. Among these teachers was the American banker Joseph Dodge. He persuaded the Japanese government to revise the country’s tax structure with a view to strengthening investment. The American statistician W. Edwards Deming taught Japanese businesspeople total quality management and warned them against imitating outdated American practices.\n\nManufacturing for export\n\nThe Japanese economic miracle primarily revolved around manufacturing and trade. Japanese economic growth was designed to enrich the country through trade, not necessarily to improve the standard of living of the Japanese people. However, a greatly improved standard of living was a by-product of this miracle.\n\nJapanese company and brand names became household words nearly everywhere: Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Canon, Hitachi, and others. The heavy involvement of government ministries in overseeing the economy does not mean that the government owns the companies, as in socialist countries. The companies are privately owned firms. A great part of their funding, however, came from the government, at least in the decades just after World War II. Japanese tax laws also encouraged saving. The postal savings system became one of the largest savings institutions in the country. Without a high savings rate among Japanese citizens, funds available for investment would have been much less.\n\nWhat set Japan apart from other industrialized nations was strategy. The main strategy behind the Japanese miracle was exporting manufactured goods to gain market share around the world. To gain market share means to sell more goods to more people in more places than the competition does. Japanese manufacturers desired to expand market share at the expense of immediate profit. They were willing to let profits be small—even willing to post a loss—in order to get customers.\n\nMany large firms formed business groups called keiretsu, which include manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors. Keiretsu are corporations bound together through mutual stockholding—that is, each company within the group owns some stock in the other companies. The corporations also have interlocking boards of directors. These close relationships involve manufacturing firms and the banks that are their major sources of funds. This means that ownership of corporations is much more concentrated in Japan than in the United States, since banks hold most of the shares of a company. Over time, however, the keiretsu system has weakened somewhat.\n\nThe success of Japanese manufacturing owes much to the willingness of businesspeople to innovate. An often-told story illustrates the Japanese path to economic vitality. In 1946 Morita Akio and Ibuka Masaru started a company named Tokyo Telecommunications and Engineering. The company made home appliances and, later, tape recorders. In 1952 they heard about an American invention called the transistor. This electronic device had been invented by Bell Laboratories in the United States in 1947. American manufacturers saw little immediate potential for it, because they had a vested interest in vacuum tubes. The two Japanese businessmen paid $25,000 for a license to use the transistor and within two years were producing transistor radios. They named these little radios Sony, and in 1958 Sony became the corporate name. The company became an outstanding success.\n\nIn the 30 years after 1950, Japanese corporations made more than 30,000 licensing and other technology agreements with other countries. The Japanese have excelled in process engineering—finding better ways to make a product. The Japanese became the leading makers of all kinds of high-technology electronic equipment.\n\nIn the decades after 1950, Japanese manufacturing went through three specific phases. At first, heavy industry was dominant. This meant steelmaking, chemical production, shipbuilding, and the production of heavy machinery—relics of a fading industrial era. This approach was pushed by the government, and in the end it failed. By 1960 consumer goods moved ahead, mainly electronic products and automobiles. By the 1980s Japanese companies were building manufacturing plants in countries that were normally large importers of goods.\n\nOne reason for moving plants offshore was a growing resentment around the world of Japanese trade practices, resulting in large imbalances of trade. As consumers abroad bought more and more Japanese goods, they bought less of the products made in their home countries. A desire to protect U.S. industries was growing in the United States, especially among the automakers. Fearful that their exports would be curtailed, Japanese business leaders invested in plants in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. Another reason for this practice was a diminished supply of manual labor within Japan. Developing countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, had large numbers of manual laborers available. And workers in underdeveloped countries accepted lower wages, which helped greatly in cutting manufacturing costs.\n\nAfter World War II, the Japanese economy experienced decades of impressive growth. In 1945, as a result of war damage, Japanese production stood at 30 percent of what it had been in 1935. By 1951 it was at 114 percent of the 1930 level, and it continued to grow at more than 9 percent each year in the 1950s. Through the 1960s the economy grew at more than 10 percent a year. During the 1970s, because of the huge oil-price increases and worldwide recession, productivity increases dropped to under 5 percent a year. Because of the oil shocks, Japan reduced its dependence on oil as a source of energy for manufacturing and electricity. In the 1980s, with recovery under way, productivity improved. By 1990 the growth rate had reached 5.5 percent before starting to decline.\n\nTrade balance\n\nJapan’s great success at exporting its manufactured goods led to trade surpluses, meaning that the value of Japan’s exports exceeded that of its imports. In the late 20th century, growing Japanese trade surpluses increased friction between Japan and its trading partners in Europe and the United States. These trading partners wanted to sell more of their products in Japan and at home, where they competed with Japanese goods. Japan’s critics charged that the country advocated free trade abroad but maintained a closed market in Japan, making it very difficult for other countries to export their goods to Japan. For example, Japan charged very high tariffs, or taxes on imported goods. Critics also claimed that Japan engaged in “adversarial trade” designed to benefit only Japan. There were complaints that Japanese companies sold goods abroad at lower prices than they did within Japan—a charge denied by Japanese business and government leaders.\n\nThe Japanese government responded by making efforts to “open” Japan to foreign products. In the early 1970s Japan had the world’s second highest tariffs on manufactured goods. Two decades later such tariffs were the lowest among the economically advanced countries. In addition, restrictions on importing many agricultural products were lifted. Japan’s formal barriers to trade were largely ended, though areas such as construction bidding were still closed.\n\nThe “lost decade” and beyond\n\nBy the late 20th century, Japan had become one of the world’s great powers, both economically and politically. It had led the way in Asia for decades. By the early 1990s, however, the Japanese economy, especially manufacturing, found itself in a new global environment. Industrialization had expanded in previously underdeveloped parts of Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. These were providing competition for Japan in its export trade, and labor costs in these countries were much less than in Japan. China too was experiencing astounding economic growth, ultimately overtaking Japan to become the world’s second largest economy in 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, in the 1980s Japan experienced what has become known as a “bubble economy.” Enjoying easy credit and low interest rates, Japanese corporations engaged in unrestrained economic speculation in the stock market. The Japanese also speculated on land, and real-estate prices skyrocketed. Eventually, the prices grew so overinflated that the “bubble” burst in the early 1990s. The stock and real-estate markets collapsed, and prices dropped sharply. This ushered in a steep recession, and production levels dropped dramatically. Thousands of smaller firms filed for bankruptcy. The Japanese economy’s period of great growth had ended.\n\nTo combat the recession, a variety of economic policies were adopted and tried. Nevertheless, economic growth was essentially stagnant throughout the 1990s—in what came to be known in Japan as the “lost decade.” The country experienced another serious recession at the end of that decade.\n\nConditions improved after the turn of the 21st century. Growth rates were modest, however, and were punctuated with periodic slumps. By 2000 Japan was also facing the fact that an increasing number of Japanese workers would be retiring. At the same time, with the country’s population growth also stagnant, fewer young people would be entering the workforce. Japan, like the rest of the world, was hard hit by the global economic recession that began at the end of 2007. Nonetheless, Japan continued to have one of the world’s highest gross national products per capita.\n\nAgriculture, Fishing, and Forestry\n\nAgriculture\n\nBecause Japan’s terrain is mostly mountainous, the supply of farmland is sharply limited. Agriculture accounts for only a tiny portion of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP). Less than 5 percent of the Japanese workforce makes its living by farming. This represents a remarkable decline from World War II levels, when half the population worked in agriculture. In addition, most families engaged in farming today have outside jobs as well. A large number of farm households are more dependent for a living on jobs in nearby cities than they are on farming. But many farmers who have taken city jobs are holding onto their farms because they regard them as a hedge against unemployment and inflation.\n\nMost Japanese farms are small, and many are inefficient. Larger farms generally are found in Hokkaido, where units of 25 acres (10 hectares) or more are fairly common. Large crop surpluses in Hokkaido, northern and western Honshu, and central Kyushu are shipped to the heavily populated, urbanized belt that stretches from Tokyo westward to northern Kyushu.\n\nRice, the staple food in Japan, is by far the largest crop in acreage, tonnage, and value. Irrigated rice fields, or paddies, occupy more than half the cultivated area of Japan. Most rice fields in Hokkaido and northern Honshu bear only one crop a year. To the south, where the winter is milder and the growing season longer, multiple cropping is used. Under this system, paddies produce a summer rice crop and a winter crop of dry grains or vegetables.\n\nAs a result of government price supports and the use of modern farming methods, rice production rose steeply starting in the 1960s, to the extent that supply far outran demand. Meanwhile, overall rice consumption dropped. Thus, although Japan needs to import much of its food, it is self-sufficient in rice production. A ban on imported rice was ended in 1999. However, steep customs duties on rice have remained in place. Prices paid by Japanese consumers for rice have been far above world market prices, as is generally true of food prices in Japan.\n\nLeading Japanese crops in addition to rice include wheat, barley, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, sugar beets, fruits, vegetables, and tea. Apples and mandarin oranges are among the major fruit crops. Raising livestock is an important farming activity in Japan, but it is carried out on a small scale. Japanese farms produce eggs, dairy, pigs, cattle, and chickens.\n\nFishing and forestry\n\nJapan has one of the largest fish catches of any country in the world. The Japanese people are among the world’s leading consumers of seafood, traditionally depending on the sea for much of the protein in their diet. Labor shortages are severe in the fishing industry, however, and imports of fishery products exceed exports.\n\nThe Japanese fishing industry includes coastal fishing, offshore fishing, deep-sea fishing, and fish-farm production. The culture in shallow coastal bays of prawns, sea bream, edible seaweed, oysters, and other marine products has grown rapidly. In addition, cultured pearls have long have been significant.\n\nMost Japanese fishers work in shallow coastal waters. The typical coastal fishing craft have a capacity of less than 10 tons. The greatest tonnage of the country’s fish catch comes from offshore fishing, for which somewhat larger boats are used. Deep-sea fishing is done in waters far from Japan by large modern fleets. Mother ships serve the fleets as floating processing and canning plants. The Japanese government is a party to international treaties and conventions regulating the use of international waters for fishing.\n\nIn spite of its large annual fish catch, the Japanese fishing sector faces some serious problems. Local fisheries are depleted by overfishing and pollution, especially in the Inland Sea. The number of Japanese workers engaged in fishing has declined sharply. As with agriculture, the fishery worker population has aged rapidly. The fishing sector’s total catch has been decreasing for decades.\n\nForests occupy about 62 million acres (25 million hectares), slightly more than two-thirds of Japan’s land area. However, most of the forested land is located in inaccessible mountain areas. Most forestland is privately owned, mainly in small plots of less than 10 acres (4 hectares). These plots are usually a part of normal farming operations and a source of household fuel.\n\nPlanted forests, many of them publicly owned, occupy about two-fifths of the total forested area. Cedar, cypress, and larch are the leading species. Sawlogs are obtained mainly from Hokkaido, the mountains of northern and central Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Both conifers and broad-leaved trees are harvested for pulpwood. Charcoal was formerly a significant source of income for mountain villagers, but it has been largely replaced by gas and electricity as the main household fuel.\n\nLumber production has fallen below the peak years of the early 1960s. Since the demand in Japan for lumber has continued to rise, the country has relied increasingly on imports, mainly from the United States. Imported raw timber is turned into lumber and finished products. The government has tried to increase domestic production in a variety of ways, including by opening roads to remote forest stands and by promoting proper forest management among private owners of woodland.\n\nIndustry\n\nManufacturing\n\nManufacturing is very important to Japan’s economy. It contributes about a fifth of GDP, employs millions of workers, and produces valuable exports. Japan has some of the world’s largest and most-advanced industrial plants. The country is one of the world’s principal shipbuilders and automakers. It is also a major producer of such basic products as crude steel, aluminum, pulp and paper, and textiles. Japan is a leading producer of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, chemical fertilizers, and petrochemical products, such as plastics and synthetic rubber. Japanese oil-refining capacity is one of the largest in the world. Japan is also a leading producer of cement.\n\nIn the late 20th century Japanese industry saw the most spectacular growth in the production of motor vehicles, iron and steel, machinery (including robots), and cameras and other precision equipment. The country became noted for advanced electronic products, including computers, telecommunications equipment, and consumer goods.\n\nJapanese manufacturing is concentrated in a heavily populated urban-industrial belt. This belt extends westward from Tokyo and the Kanto Plain along the Pacific coast and the Inland Sea to northern Kyushu. Japan’s major international ports and its best overland transportation facilities are in this region. So too are the headquarters of its leading banks and trading companies. Most of the industrial complexes are on the coast, where they have access to ocean shipping and imported fuel and raw materials.\n\nWithin the industrial belt are several major clusters of manufacturing activity. The largest—the Keihin Industrial Zone—is centered upon the urban core of Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama, on the Kanto Plain. Within the Keihin zone, large-scale heavy industry lines the western and northern shores of Tokyo Bay. The area is a center for printing and publishing and for the manufacture of machinery, automobiles, and electronic equipment. Yokohama provides international port services.\n\nThe Chukyo Industrial Zone centers on the city of Nagoya. This zone is noted for its production of automobiles, aircraft parts, machinery, textiles, and ceramics. Also included in this zone is the Kuwana-Yokkaichi area, an oil-refining and petrochemical center.\n\nThe Keihanshin Industrial Zone includes the cities of Osaka and Kobe along with surrounding areas. Osaka has chemical, machinery, electrical machinery, and iron and steel plants. Kobe is a major international port and produces ships and steel.\n\nAnother industrial area is centered on Kita-Kyushu, in northern Kyushu. It developed around Japan’s first steel mill, established in 1901 at Yawata. The Kita-Kyushu area specializes in the manufacture of iron and steel and has other heavy industries.\n\nMinerals and energy\n\nJapan’s mineral and energy resources are small compared with those of other major industrial countries. Its mineral deposits are limited, and their quality is often poor. Great amounts of many fuels and minerals, including coal, petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, tin, nickel, nitrate, and phosphates, must be imported. Among the most abundant minerals in Japan are coal, iron ore, zinc, lead, copper, sulfur, gold, and silver. The country also has large deposits of limestone.\n\nMining is a relatively unimportant and declining sector of the economy. Coal was long the major product mined in Japan. Because of high production costs, however, Japan’s total coal production declined drastically in the late 20th century. Nearly all the country’s coal is now imported. Hokkaido accounts for most of Japan’s very small coal output. Mining for iron and copper essentially ceased in Japan after 2000.\n\nJapan’s reserves of petroleum are meager and must be supplemented with imported oil, mostly from the Middle East. Virtually all of the country’s own petroleum and natural gas production comes from Niigata prefecture, in north-central Honshu. Japanese consumption of petroleum increased greatly during the boom times of the 1960s. However, the global price of oil rose to unprecedented heights in the 1970s, and Japan cut down its dependence on imported petroleum. In addition, a significant share of Japan’s imported oil now comes from fields developed in other countries by Japanese companies. Japan is also a major importer of liquefied natural gas.\n\nThe availability of large supplies of electric power was a key to Japan’s industrial growth and rising living standards. Hydroelectric power (electricity from waterpower) made up almost two-thirds of the total electric supply in the early 1950s. The Japanese have continued to build hydroelectric dams. However"
