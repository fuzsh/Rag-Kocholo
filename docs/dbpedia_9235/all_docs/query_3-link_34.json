The production of coins of the archbishops ended in 1643, the city of Bremen issued coins until 1871. During the time of the German Empire, the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen issued coins with face values of 2, 5, 10 and 20 marks at a rather low mintage between 1904 and 1907. The design of the city’s coins was dominated by the city’s coat of arms held by lions featuring a key referring to the city’s patron Saint Peter. Until 1806, the imperial eagle with the title of the respective emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was shown on the reverse. During the time of the German Empire, this depiction was replaced by the usual reverse design of circulation coins featuring the imperial eagle. When selecting the pieces, I attached great importance to rarity and quality.",
