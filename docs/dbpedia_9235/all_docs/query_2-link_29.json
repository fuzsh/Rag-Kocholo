This question is at the heart of the \"Praxissalon\" evenings organized by the Deutsches Ärzteblatt across various practices in Germany. During these events, the hosting physician provides participating colleagues with insights into how they integrate digital tools into their practice. This is followed by an in-depth discussion, allowing for a rich exchange of experiences. Last week, the event, moderated by our colleague Dr. Edda Eggers, was hosted by Dr. med. Marc Hanefeld in Bremervörde. Dr. Hanefeld demonstrated how he has strategically restructured and digitalized his practice's workflows since taking over in recent years. The improved workflow has significantly enhanced the work of the entire team, with medical assistants particularly appreciating the digital advancements. For more details, check out the report on the Ärzteblatt website: https://lnkd.in/eSivrNvf A big thank you to Dr. Marc Hanefeld for opening his practice and to all the attendees for the engaging exchange.
