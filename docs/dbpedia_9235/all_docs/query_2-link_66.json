        "text": "Thanks to an international research grant, the development of safe, low-cost, environmentally friendly hydrogen storage materials derived from New Zealand resources has advanced. Professor Sally Brooker of the University of Otago’s Department of Chemistry and Dr. Paul Jerabek of the Institute of Hydrogen Technology, Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon are co-leading a German-New Zealand Green Hydrogen partnership. The alliance, which is sponsored for five years by German and New Zealand money, was created to promote networking and outreach and to construct a research center at Otago. It intends to promote green hydrogen research and industry partnerships between the two countries, thereby creating…\n\nThis certification mark may be used by manufacturers to boost their trust in the performance and safety of their systems and components.\n\nThe role of storage in establishing a hydrogen economy in the UK is a new paper that makes it obvious that although the implementation of support mechanisms for hydrogen production is going well.\n\nL8 Energy will present at Intersolar South America, between August 23 and 25, a photovoltaic system integrated to a green hydrogen plant. With a total investment of R$200 million, financed by a German bank, the plant located in Goiás should be ready in 2023. According to Leandro Kuhn, CEO of L8 Group, the investment in the solar part alone reached R$88 million. The plant is seen by the company as a milestone in the supply of renewable energy, since the production of hydrogen requires a high consumption of electricity. L8 Energy’s solution allies solar energy generation to the process, consuming…\n\nÎle-de-France Mobilités stated on July 12, 2022 that it will initiate a procurement process to purchase around 50 standard hydrogen buses for €48 million beginning in 2024. Until until, the energy transformation of the region’s bus networks was based on biomethane and electric technology. To accommodate clean buses, this is leading to the conversion of bus operating centers to these energies. Additionally, IDFM continues to explore with new technologies, including hydrogen. Île-de-France Mobilités is now cooperating with two additional projects, H2 Créteil and Vallée Sud Hydrogène, in addition to its involvement with Versailles. The first, led by Sipperec and the…\n\nA recent Netflix production in the park of the Chateau de Courances in the Paris region was accompanied by an electro-hydrogen generator from Eneria. The film crew utilized GEH2 EODev’s emission-free electricity to power a lighting system meant to simulate a full moon night. A solution tailored to the limitations of filmmaking Netflix’s request allowed TSF to test, under real-world conditions, the implementation of a mobile GEH2 solution; the electro-hydrogen generator was mounted on a 19 t truck that also carried 44 kg of compressed hydrogen at 200 bar and a pressure reduction plate. Completely transportable, the installation was able…\n\nEmerson Korea will exhibit at ‘H2 MEET,’ Korea’s largest hydrogen industry show, from August 31 to September 3 at KINTEX, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi Province. It declared on the 16th that it will participate in the development of the hydrogen economy and deliver a whole automation solution. Emerson Korea will build a display in the exhibition hall to showcase entire automation solutions such as hydrogen production and transportation, charging station, fuel cell, and control and safety detection system. On display at the booth are automation technologies such as liquid hydrogen and LNG storage at low temperatures, safety detection systems, hydrogen value chain…"
