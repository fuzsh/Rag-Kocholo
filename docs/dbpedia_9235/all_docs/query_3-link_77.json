        "text": "In Bremen, history, science and culture combine to form a truly fascinating city. Itâs ideal for visitors wanting to learn more about the countryâs background and Hanseatic heritage.\n\nSpend your time exploring different areas, such as the Schnoor quarter. Particularly popular among visitors, this district has many examples of architecture dating back to the 15th-18th century, including the Toy Museum and the gothic John's Church. Check out key attractions, such as Bremen City Hall, one of the oldest buildings in the city and included on the UNESCO architectural heritage list. Visit the cellar, where you can taste more than 600 varieties of wine.\n\nOne of the best times to visit is during winter, when Bremen Christmas Market transforms the city into a festive wonderland. Itâs the perfect place to shop for Christmas gifts and sample delicious food.\n\nHere are some of the best things to see and do in Bremen during a tour of the city:\n\nBremen City Hall\n\nBuilt between 1405 and 1410, Bremen City Hall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most beautiful buildings in Germany. It's the only European town hall built in the late Middle Ages that hasn't been demolished or altered. Although a large percentage of the city was destroyed during the Second World War, the Bremen City Hall remained unscathed.\n\nMusical Sculpture\n\nTo the south of the city hall, youâll find a sculpture of a rooster, donkey, dog and cat. Established by Gerhard Marcks in 1953, this sculpture depicts the German fairy tale \"Town Musicians of Bremen\" and is one of the cityâs famous sights. Remember to rub the leg of the donkey for good luck!\n\nSchnoor quarter\n\nLooking for things to do in Bremen? The Schnoor quarter is the cityâs oldest district. This area is a delight to explore, only a stone's throw from the city hall and packed with beautiful architecture and quaint cobbled streets. Discover all sorts of attractions, from boutiques and restaurants to a toy museum and a Christmas shop open all year round.\n\nViertel district\n\nThe Viertel district is the most colourful and bohemian area of Bremen, with more than 290 shops that sell everything imaginable! Boasting a superb cultural scene, the district is famous for kitsch art, theatres and museums. It also has a vibrant nightlife, with plenty of bars, nightclubs and pubs open all night.\n\nBremen has been named the food capital of Northern Germany and has a thriving restaurant scene. From fine-dining venues to casual eateries, thereâs something for every taste and budget. The world-famous Beckâs Beer is also brewed in the city.\n\nThe best restaurants in Bremen\n\nThe Grill\n\nThe Grill is one of the best fine dining restaurants in Bremen, serving delicious steaks and seafood in a sophisticated environment. Here, the chefs use the very best meat to create mouth-watering dishes cooked to perfection. Enjoy your meal inside the elegant restaurant or on the terrace, and choose a cocktail for a sweet tipple to accompany your food.\n\nPlaka\n\nHead to Plaka for tasty Greek food in a friendly setting. This restaurant is a great place to relax and refuel, only a short drive from Bremenâs main train station. Tuck into authentic Greek cuisine in the restaurant or on the terrace in the summer months. The menu features a range of dishes, including gyros and grilled meat.\n\nThe best pubs in Bremen\n\nSpitzen Gebel\n\nLocated in Bremenâs market square, Spitzen Gebel is one of the cityâs oldest and most iconic pubs. With a welcoming feel and unique atmosphere, itâs an ideal place for a drink. Tourists are invited to take a Sluk ut de Lamp, a swig from the lamp filled with schnapps. This tradition dates back to 1913 when piano movers drank out of lamps filled with schnapps as they were not allowed to drink alcohol while working.\n\nSchwarzer Hermann\n\nSchwarzer Hermann is a cosy pub perfect for a drink or a bite to eat. With friendly staff, a beer garden and a brilliant selection of food and drinks, it offers a great space to relax away from the bustle of the city.\n\nThe Bremen Roland\n\nIn Germany, you can see many statues of Knight Roland, but this is the oldest and greatest medieval sculpture. The stone sculpture is more than 10 metres high and was built in 1404 when the previous statue was destroyed by archbishop soldiers in 1366. It symbolises the freedom and independence of the city.\n\nSt. Peter's Cathedral\n\nSt. Peter's Cathedral is a 1500-year-old Lutheran church on the market square. Its two towers â one of which is open to visitors â can be seen from a distance. Head to the cathedral cellars to see the Bleikeller mummies."
