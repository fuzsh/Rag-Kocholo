        "text": "Please visit the St. Petri cathedral now and walk up the stairs to the main portal.\n\nDon’t be surprised if you see a peculiar group of people, who could be perceived as entertainers in action. They are practicing an old native Bremen tradition, which is still quite popular today: Young women and men who have not married by the age of 30 polish the door handle and/or wash the staircase of the dome in the presence of their friends and family accompanied by drinks, snacks and music. This strenuous task is continued until someone frees the single person with a kiss.\n\nAfter you have passed through the impressive doors, please enter the church, sit down and relax for a while.\n\nThe Bremen Dome has a long history. At the end of the 8th century, Charlemagne had a bishop’s residence and dome built next to a Northern German fishing village, which is now known as the city of Bremen. The Roman church structure, built of sandstone and brick, and an archbishopric since 845AD, however, was totally destroyed by fire. The construction of today’s St. Petri Dome began in 1041 and it was continuously expanded in segments and a late Gothic style up to the 16th century. The dome however was completely abandoned due to religious controversies, until one of the towers collapsed in the 17th century and the other tower was consumed by fire. At the end of the 19th century, both towers were restored and elaborate renovations were performed in the church.\n\nToday, the church is of the Protestant-Lutheran dome congregation St. Petri and has been placed under monumental protection since 1973.\n\nTake a tour of the dome and look at the numerous pillars and artefacts. The St. Petri Dome is very well defined by its artistic interior. For instance, elaborately adorned baroque pulpit and the choir pews designed in 1360, certain parts of which have been preserved until today. One of the most well-known artefacts of the Bremen Dome is the Bremen baptismal font, a bronze fountain created by a bell-caster in 1225. The fountain is carried by men riding a lion and features 38 figurines, amongst them Jesus Christ, angels and apostles.\n\nIf you wish enjoy a beautiful view of Bremen’s Old Town, climb the 265 steps of the south tower. Quite typically the steep spiral staircase will guide you to the very top of the tower next to the bells.\n\nPhoto St.-Petri-Dom Bremen by larsjuh is licensed under CC BY 2.0"
