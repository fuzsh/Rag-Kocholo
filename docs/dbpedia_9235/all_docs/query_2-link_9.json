        "text": "Expert Determination means a written determination of the Net Cash Adjustment setting forth the rationale for the determination made and to be provided to both the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser, by the Frankfurt, Germany office of Deloitte & Touche LLP acting as an arbitrating expert within the meaning of Section 317 BGB. Such arbitrating expert shall (i) make a final and binding determination (the Final Determination) of (A) the correct amounts of the unresolved Amounts in Dispute and (B) the Net Cash Adjustment and the Cash Consideration resulting therefrom, to be calculated as stipulated in Section 4.1, and (ii) also determine the proportion in which the Sellers on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other hand shall bear the costs of such determination, depending on the result of the determination in relation to the position taken by the Parties about the unresolved Amounts in Dispute when the determination procedure commences. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with and assist, and shall cause the Group to cooperate with and assist, the arbitrating expert in making the Final Determination. Section 4.4 shall apply mutatis mutandis such that the Purchaser, the Group, and the Sellers shall provide such cooperation and assistance as described therein to such arbitrating expert at its reasonable request. Intellectual Property means any or all of the following and all rights arising out of or associated with any of the following, whether German, international, or foreign: (a) all inventions (whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice), all improvements thereto, and all patents, patent applications, and patent disclosures, together with all reissuances, continuations, continuations-in-part, revisions, extensions, and reexaminations thereof, (b) all trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos, trade names, and corporate names, together with all translations, adaptations, derivations, and combinations thereof and including all goodwill associated therewith, and all applications, registrations, and renewals in connection therewith, (c) all copyrightable works, all copyrights, and all applications, registrations, and renewals in connection therewith, (d) all mask works and all applications, registrations, and renewals in connection therewith, (e) all trade secrets and confidential business information (including ideas, research and development, know-how, formulas, compositions, manufacturing and production processes and techniques, technical data, designs, drawings, specifications, customer and supplier lists, pricing and cost information, and business and marketing plans and proposals), (f) all computer software (including data and related documentation), (g) databases; (h) rights of publicity, things in action and choses in action, (i) all copies and tangible embodiments thereof (in whatever form or medium); and (j) all other rights of like nature. U.S. Person means (i) any natural person resident in the United States, (ii) any partnership or corporation organized or incorporated under the laws of the United States, (iii) any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. Person, (iv) any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. Person, (v) any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States, (vi) any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer or other fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. Person, (vii) any discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer or other fiduciary organized, incorporated or (if an individual) resident in the United States, or (viii) a partnership or corporation organized under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction by a U.S. Person principally for the purpose of investing in securities not registered under the Securities Act. 3.3 The portion of the purchase price payable in Greenfield Common Stock (the Stock Consideration) shall be an aggregate total number of three million nine hundred forty-seven thousand three hundred sixty-seven (3,947,367) shares of Greenfield Common Stock, paid by physical delivery of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Greenfield Common Stock in certificated form to the Sellers Representative and registered in such names and representing such number of shares as designated in Schedule 3.2. A portion of such shares, namely two hundred sixty-three thousand one hundred fifty-eight (263,158) shares of Greenfield Common Stock, shall be subject to the Escrow Agreement, and a separate portion of such shares, namely one hundred twenty-six thousand two hundred ten (126,210) shares of Greenfield Common Stock, shall be subject to the Burda Escrow Agreement. The remaining portion of the Stock Consideration shall be delivered at Closing as provided in Section 13. In all cases, such portion of the total Stock Consideration that shall become due for delivery from time to time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be delivered to the Sellers Representative on behalf of each Seller in accordance with the percentage indicated for such Seller in Schedule 3.2. In the event that any Seller is entitled to a fractional share of Greenfield Common Stock, as a portion of the Stock Consideration due to them, then such fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number if such fraction is greater than 0.5, and rounded down to the nearest whole number if such fraction is equal to or less than 0.5. (the amount of the result of the calculation set forth in (a) through (b) the Net Cash Adjustment). For purposes of the Net Cash Adjustment only, the Eligible Tax Accruals shall be calculated by (i) taking the number of such accruals as reflected in the Accounts (only to the extent not paid before or on the Closing Date) for the period ending on or before the Accounting Date and (ii) using the same accounting approach and principles consistently applied as used in the preparation of the Accounts (including the valuation of the subsidiaries and the amount of the tax loss carry forwards) for the amount of such accruals for the period from 1 January 2005 until the Closing Date (only to the extent not paid before or on the Closing Date). For clarification purposes only, a sample calculation of the Net Cash Adjustment on the basis of the numbers from the Accounts is attached hereto as Schedule 4.1. 4.5 Should the Purchaser believe that the Closing Date Calculation is incorrect other than with respect to the amount of the Eligible Tax Accruals, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers Representative thereof in writing within thirty days following receipt of the Closing Date Calculation by the Purchaser (the Notice of Disagreement). The Notice of Disagreement shall specify, in reasonable detail, which amounts of the Closing Date Calculation are incorrect (the Amounts in Dispute) and the amounts thereof considered correct by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall be irrevocably deemed to have agreed to all amounts in the Closing Date Calculation other than the Amounts in Dispute. If the Sellers Representative does not receive a Notice of Disagreement within the aforementioned thirty-day period, the Closing Date Calculation shall become final and binding for the Parties (the Final Closing Date Calculation). If the Purchaser has duly delivered a Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Notice of Disagreement by the Sellers Representative (or within any other period of time mutually agreed upon between the Sellers and the Purchaser), use all reasonable efforts to reach an agreement on the Amounts in Dispute. If and to the extent that, during such period, the Sellers and the Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement on the Amounts in Dispute, the Purchaser shall be entitled to request an Expert Determination, after the expiration of the aforementioned period, by giving notice of such request in writing to the Sellers Representative. 4.6 If the Final Closing Date Calculation or the Final Determination, as the case may be, results in a definitive total Cash Consideration higher than the Estimated Cash Consideration, the difference (the Sellers Balance) shall be paid to the Sellers by the Purchaser within five (5) Business Days following the date when the Closing Date Calculation has become final or the date of the Final Determination, as the case may be. If the Final Closing Date Calculation or the Final Determination, as the case may be, results in a definitive total Cash Consideration which is lower than the Estimated Cash Consideration, the difference (the Purchaser Balance) shall be paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser within such time period. The Sellers Balance, if any, shall be paid to the Sellers Bank Account, except for the pro rata share of Burda Ventures (to be determined by the ratio of the Known Plaintiff Shares to the Shares sold hereunder), which shall be paid to the Burda Escrow Agent pursuant to the Burda Escrow Agreement, and the Purchaser Balance, if any, shall be paid as directed by the Purchaser. e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not (i) conflict with or violate the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, in each case as amended or restated, (ii) conflict with or violate any European Union, EU member state, U.S. federal, state, foreign or local law; statute; mandatory ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or decree (collectively, Laws) applicable to the Company or by which any of its Assets is bound or subject to, or (iii) result in any violation of or breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension or cancellation of, or require payment under, or result in the loss or impairment of, or result in the creation of an encumbrance on, any of the Assets of the Company under or pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, security agreement, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, right, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of its Assets is bound or subject.

Purchasers exclusive remedy for such Losses shall be a demand to the Escrow Agent for payment or delivery of shares in accordance with the Escrow Agreement out of the full remaining Escrow Cash and Escrow Stock. c) The Sellers hereby agree with the Purchaser (for itself and on behalf of the Company) to indemnify and keep indemnified on demand (auf Antrag) the Company and the Purchaser against Losses arising from each and every breach of the obligations of the Company, the Sellers, or the Company Trustee under Section 21.1 that would not have existed or arisen or been incurred had the relevant obligation in Section 21.1 been complied with; provided, however, that to the extent such Losses were indemnified by a release from the Escrow Agreement each Seller must promptly replenish pro rata the amount of any such Loss after release thereof from the Escrow Amount (each Sellers pro rata share determined on the basis of the Shares sold by such Seller hereunder to the total number of all Shares sold under this Agreement). 10.5 Each of the warranties, representations, agreements, undertakings or covenants in this Agreement shall be separate and independently given and made subject only (i.e. the liability of the Sellers being expressly excluded in case of the following) to the matters (i) disclosed in the Group Disclosure Schedules with respect to such warranty, representation or covenant (provided that every matter, document and item referred to, set forth or described under any section of the Group Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed against each of the representations, warranties, agreements, undertakings or covenants in this Agreement to the extent the applicability thereto of such matter, document or item is reasonably apparent from the Group Disclosure Schedule), or (ii) that are reasonably apparent from other provisions of this Agreement to apply to such warranty representation, agreement, undertaking or covenant (for the avoidance of doubt, no specific identification or cross-referencing shall be necessary for such application to be reasonably apparent). 10.6 The Sellers shall forthwith disclose to the Purchaser in writing any matter or thing which may arise or become known to any of them after the date hereof and prior to Closing that is a breach of or inconsistent with or may render inaccurate any of the representations, warranties or undertakings made by them in this Agreement, or which is a breach or may otherwise give rise to a claim under any agreement or covenant in this Agreement. In the event of such disclosure or the Purchaser otherwise becoming aware before Closing of any such matter or thing as is referred to above, the Purchaser may at any time before Closing rescind the Agreement by giving notice in writing to the Sellers Representative to that effect unless the relevant matter or thing does not result in a material adverse effect on the business conditions of the Company or Greenfield. a) The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claim or claims hereunder pursuant to any breaches under Section 8 (other than breaches under Section 8.1e)) and Section 9 unless (i) the amount of an individual claim exceeds the Currency Equivalent of nineteen thousand two hundred thirty euros (19,230) (provided however that the same or similar claims or a series of claims shall be considered an individual claim for the purposes of this threshold) and (ii) the aggregate amount of such claims (i.e. only those claims exceeding the Currency Equivalent of nineteen thousand two hundred thirty euros (19,230)) exceeds the Currency Equivalent of three hundred eighty-four thousand six hundred fifteen euros (384,615) in which case then also the claims which counted against the latter threshold shall be recoverable by the Purchaser. Losses shall be computed net of (i) any present or future advantages and benefits (Vorteilsausgleich) (including avoided losses and savings and increases in the value of any asset owned by the Group or the Purchaser (Abzug neu für alt)) directly related to or arising from the particular claim therefor, and (ii) any amounts of such Losses that are or could be reimbursed by commercially reasonable levels of insurance coverage. In case such Loss could be recovered from a third party, the Purchaser shall assign such claim to the Sellers Representative upon the request of the Sellers Representative. c) In the event that the Purchaser shall be in receipt of any claim that might constitute or give rise to a liability hereunder, the Purchaser shall with reasonable dispatch notify the Sellers Representative thereof and from time to time thereafter keep the Sellers Representative informed of all material developments thereto (including by providing the Sellers Representative with any decisions, motions, filings, or other such documentation with respect to such claim) and give the relevant Sellers reasonable opportunity to suggest means of defense; provided that the failure to give such notice shall relieve the Sellers from liability hereunder only to the extent that the failure to give such notice prejudices the Sellers material rights or defenses with respect to such claim. The Sellers shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. No judgment or government order rendered or issued against any member of the Group shall be deemed to be a Loss unless (i)(A) it is demonstrated by the Purchaser by the provision of a certified copy of the relevant final judgment or order, and (B) such judgment or order shall have been rendered following a valid third party notice (Streitverkündung) in accordance with the provisions of Sections 74, 68 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) or any equivalent provisions under applicable foreign law; or (ii) the Purchaser has granted the right to the Sellers Representative to assume the defense against the relevant claim at its own cost by appointing and instructing counsel on behalf of the relevant company at the reasonable discretion of the Sellers Representative provided in the case of (ii) that such counsel shall be instructed to keep the Purchaser or the relevant company fully and timely informed about such proceedings and provided with copies of all documents being exchanged in such proceedings. The foregoing sentence shall only operate to determine the existence of a loss but shall not establish the existence of a breach by any of the Sellers. In the event of a tax audit or other tax contest (Tax Contest) relating to the Group that relates to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, Greenfield shall allow the Sellers Representative to be present at meetings with taxing authorities and to review and comment on all correspondence with taxing authorities. Greenfield will consult in good faith with the Sellers Representative regarding the conduct of any such Tax Contest. Each of the Sellers Representative and the Sellers agrees to furnish or cause to be furnished to Greenfield, upon reasonable request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Sellers or the Group as is reasonably necessary for the preparation for any audit or Tax Contest for any period ending on or before the Closing Date. c) To the extent a tax audit for periods ending on or before the Closing Date leads to a higher tax assessment for such periods (irrespective of whether caused by any of the circumstances described in Sections 10.11b) and 10.11c) or by any other reason) that can be (in part or full) offset by the existing tax loss carry forwards of the Group, (i) the Sellers shall only be liable for such Losses that result after the existing tax loss carry forwards of the Group have been used to the fullest extent possible to offset such higher tax assessment, and (ii) the reduction of the existing tax loss carry forwards of the Group on that basis alone shall not qualify as Loss (i.e. any liability of the Sellers in connection with the reduction of the tax loss carry forwards shall be excluded). tions hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
