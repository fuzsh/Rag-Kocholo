        "text": "Back | Next\n\nContents\n\nChapter 1\n\nBremen\n\nJuly 1634\n\nFrederik, son of King Christian IV of Denmark, duke of Holstein, and still archbishop if no longer prince-archbishop of Bremen, drew up his horse as he approached the bridge that crossed the moat. His small retinue—extraordinarily small for a provincial governor appointed by the emperor of the United States of Europe—paused behind him.\n\nHe looked toward the Ansgarii Tor. By the standards of a medieval Hanseatic city, Bremen was not heavily fortified. Not by the standards of a world in which a city’s walls were perceived as defining its honor. But, certainly, it was heavily enough fortified to present a significant obstacle if the city fathers decided not to let him in; those walls had kept quite a few armies out during the past fifteen years.\n\nHe had been appointed governor of the new Province of Westphalia by Gustav Adolf less than a month ago.\n\nHe had been the designated successor to the prince-archbishop of Bremen, thanks to the political maneuvering of his father, for considerably longer. Prince-archbishop of the Erzstift Bremen, by virtue of which he would have had a seat in the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire—if that entity still existed. Which it might or might not. The Habsburgs were unlikely to give up without a further fight, if one gave any thought to the tenacity with which they had been waging war since 1618.\n\nThe city of Bremen was de facto not under the authority of the prince-archbishop. Things had been that way for a while—for about 450 years, if a person wanted to be picky about it. This meant that local politics were often more than a little bit touchy, since de jure it still was.\n\nInstead of smiling, he drew his rather thick lips inward, pinching them between his teeth. He had watched at the Congress of Copenhagen rather than talking. One of his conclusions was that the complexities and nuances of contemporary politics made Michael Stearns, the up-time leader so precipitously catapulted into the position of prime minister of the newly organized USE, restless. Restless, impatient, and more than a little contemptuous. He did not appear to be a man who would live with a legally ambivalent situation for four and a half centuries. Probably not for four and a half years. Quite possibly not for four and a half days.\n\nStill, whether Bremen was under the jurisdiction of the prince-archbishop or not, it was most certainly, by fiat of Gustav Adolf, king of Sweden, high king of the Union of Kalmar, emperor of the United States of Europe, and commander of the largest army around, under the jurisdiction of the governor of the Province of Westphalia.\n\nAs such, he intended to enter through the Ansgar Quarter gate. Saint Ansgarius, who had lived and died not too far short of a thousand years ago; well, probably nearer to eight hundred years ago; had been the first archbishop of Bremen. And—Frederik quirked one eyebrow slightly—of Hamburg.\n\nHis horse shifted under him, restless.\n\nThe slight creaks of leather and metal behind him, the occasional raising and clopping of a hoof on cobblestones, might mean that his retinue was restless. Or uneasy. If the city fathers of Bremen chose to refuse him admission at this first juncture of his new calling . . .\n\nBut the gate opened. He proceeded slowly toward the market square, through crooked streets and between tall brick houses that were probably, given the small windows, drearily dark inside; past the new guildhall of the cloth merchants, doing everything decently and in order, giving the people lining the streets a chance to see him. Wishing that Gustav Adolf had seen fit to delegate a somewhat larger company of the largest army around to escort him.\n\n“Nobody’s ever going to call him handsome,” a watching woman commented.\n\n“Impressive nose, though,” her friend Jutta answered. “What would Herr Jensen say? The old man at the bookstore who loves to use such long words? A prominent proboscis.”\n\n“That lump in the middle could mean that he’s broken it at some time.” Trinke stood on tiptoe and craned her neck. “Good seat on a horse. He’s not fat, but he shouldn’t be developing jowls yet, as young as he is.”\n\n“I thought Scandinavians were supposed to be blonds. His hair’s dark brown. And so curly.”\n\n“There’s a lot of it though, not thin or stringy, so he’s not likely to go bald. He’s probably one of those children who were born blond, but their hair gets dark when they grow up. I sort of like that feather in his hat.”\n\n“I like the hat. It looks like crushed velvet. I wouldn’t mind having one like it myself. He’d be better off without the mustache and little goatee.”\n\nThe gubernatorial procession was moving on toward the city hall.\n\n“It’s hard to tell from here, but it looks like his lips are sort of full and puffy. Maybe he’s trying to hide that.”\n\n“Overall, though, there are a lot of worse-looking men in the world.”\n\nJutta laughed. “A lot of better-looking ones, too.”\n\nHe entered by the side of the ancient guildhall, the Schütting. On the opposite, northeastern, side of the square, the four Bürgermeister, one from each quarter of the city, were waiting for him, lined up in front of the arches that were the main feature of the remodeled Flemish Renaissance facade of the originally Gothic city hall, flanked by the twenty members of the city council, the Hochedler Hochweiser Rath, five from each quarter of the city: Liebfrauen, Ansgarii, Martini und Stephani.\n\nThey were arrayed below the statues of the Holy Roman Emperor and the empire’s seven electors that proclaimed Bremen’s centuries-long ambition to become a free imperial city, independent of the prince-archbishops, owing allegiance only to the emperor, and with its own vote in the Reichstag. An ambition that had never become fact.\n\nHe rode past the eighteen-foot-high Roland statue that symbolized the council’s right to supreme criminal jurisdiction as well as the medieval Hansa’s commitment to free commerce and trade, hoping that upon this occasion, the highly noble, highly wise, councillors would be more noble and wise than was customarily the case when it came to their dealings with the prince-archbishops.\n\nHe dismounted.\n\nThe protocol was stiff.\n\nAs governor, he officially broke the news to the city council of Bremen—the Calvinist city council of the Calvinist city of Bremen—about the guarantee of religious toleration in the constitution of the United States of Europe.\n\nHe glanced to the side of the square at the ancient cathedral of St. Peter, so old that the lower portions of the mixed stone and brick construction were Romanesque in style, and the archbishop’s palace. Then, leaving his official retinue under Captain von Bargen with the city councillors, he mounted up and rode out by himself through the gate by which he had entered and partway around the wall. He dismounted and walked in through the narrow Bishop’s Needle gate that the council had imposed on the archbishops during those parlous 450 years: a gate too low to admit a mounted, armored rider. This time, he was followed by a line of Lutheran clergy, pastors and schoolteachers, headed by those among the noble canons of the cathedral’s collegiate chapter whom he had been able to rouse from their normal lethargy. The majority of them did not qualify as theologians, having gained their seats through family connections.\n\nArriving back at the city hall, he announced the establishment of regularly scheduled Lutheran services at the cathedral, the Dom, St. Petri. The impending church services were his own innovation. The cathedral had been the church of the canons, used for special religious celebrations and special events of the archdiocese. But since the parish churches of the city were Calvinist, had been for forty years, and at this point it did not seem prudent to stress relations with the city council further by demanding them back, it would become a parish. Given how long St. Peter’s had been essentially abandoned, there would be a lot of cleaning to do in its Gothic interior.\n\nHe would have liked to accompany this by a ceremonial opening of the cathedral doors. However, after nearly a half-century of being closed, they were probably stuck and it would take a great deal of huffing and puffing on the part of construction workers to get the hinges loose. That would have been neither impressive nor edifying. Not to mention that the south tower looked so shaky that it might fall down any day if vibrations disturbed its perilous equilibrium.\n\nNow wasn’t that going to be an expensive construction project? Reconstruction project—one for which he would have to find funds, if he didn’t want to risk having it come down on the worshippers now that the building would be back in use. He made a mental note to recommend that Bremen’s Lutherans should use the entrance near the sacristan’s house on the north side for the time being and concentrate their activities at the rear of the building.\n\nThey could. There weren’t a lot of Lutherans left in Bremen. He wiped off these mental cobwebs and announced that, additionally, he was establishing a Lutheran Latin school at St. Peter’s. Mental note—again for the time being, put the school in the adjoining archbishop’s palace, currently unused for any other purpose. Eventually, construct a modern building in the Domshof on the north side. And a public library. With an equestrian statue of Gustav II Adolf looking heroic in the middle of the square.\n\nBowing slightly to the gathering of Lutheran clerics, he turned himself into the provincial governor again, informing the mayors and council that if they proved to be reasonably cooperative in the future, he would negotiate with that same Gustav II Adolf, who was now their emperor, for an imperial charter that would turn their Calvinist Gymnasium Illustre into a degree-granting university. This was accompanied by a few terse words about his intentions to support the expansion of educational institutions in general within the new province.\n\nGetting such an imperial charter would be a trick if he could manage it, given that the future Lutheran imperial reluctance to license Calvinist establishments would most likely be as strong as the past Catholic imperial reluctance to license them (all having to do with the fact that Calvinism had not been comprised within the Peace of Augsburg of 1555). Given the short timing of managing this day, though, the prospect was something he could dangle in front of their noses as an enticement that might get the mule-stubborn patricians of this place to modify their natural tendency toward recalcitrance. For now.\n\n* * *\n\nHaving gotten entree into Bremen as his first accomplishment, an easier one than he had expected, Frederik duly partook of the ceremonial meal hosted by the council and then led his party once more out of the Ansgarii Tor and across to the west bank of the here shallow Weser River, where he had set up temporary quarters in the Neustadt where the city’s population was currently spilling over its official boundaries; spilling to the point that there was now an Alte Neustadt and, since the end of hostilities, a sprawling Neue Neustadt in which everything appeared to be lively, messy, and disorganized.\n\nThe Alte Neustadt, the Neestedt in the local Plattdeutsch vernacular, as large as the medieval city on the other side of the river, had been established as a planned expansion for the defense of Bremen a decade earlier, furnished with modern fortifications, walls with eight bastions, according to the plans of the Dutch engineer Johan van Valckenburgh. Its resentful residents by and large considered themselves to be the shortchanged stepchildren of the privileged city on the east bank.\n\nThe Neue Neustadt—didn’t have fortifications. Or any other normal amenities. It was noisy and muddy. Not to mention smelly; the swine market was flourishing. From Frederik’s perspective, it had one major advantage as a place to stay. However much the city fathers on the east bank aspired to acquire a large hinterland and place it under their jurisdiction, thus far they had not managed to do so. His overnight headquarters were in the Stift lands.\n\nHe set out to take stock of his new responsibilities—being completely sober and still awake while his officers and staff had mostly succumbed to the effect of too much beer and wine at the banquet.\n\nFrederik opened his field kit, rooted around for a bit, and hung a blank sheet of paper, one of the big ones that ordinarily got folded eight times to make books, on his easel. He had set the easel up the day before. It traveled with him.\n\nHe drew a stylized crown. At least his appointment as governor had somewhat mollified his father in regard to Holstein. Or lubricated him. Along with a goodly quantity of wine, of course. Christian IV’s personal habits were one of the reasons that his second son was so abstemious.\n\nAnother dot. His older brother Christian had been married to Magdalene Sybille of Saxony for six months now. The up-time encyclopedias said that he did not have children; nothing had happened to challenge that assumption, no matter how many other things were not working out according to the patterns in those books from another world. The happy couple had retired to their own palace and were busy being patrons of the arts. Or possibly, he thought sardonically, being patronizing to artists. Based on the observations he had made of his father’s endeavors as a builder and collector, the two frequently went hand in hand, and nothing he knew about John George of Saxony would lead him to believe that the man’s daughter might take a different approach to the people who had designed and decorated the buildings of Dresden or composed and performed the music that was played for the elector, whether at public events or private social gatherings.\n\nA third dot. He considered once more his position vis-a-vis his brother Ulrik and reflected that it was no fun being second-string. And after his first superficial survey of his new province, likely to remain so.\n\nHe drew a line. Then, beneath it, a little sword.\n\nThe governor of the Province of Westphalia did not, per se, coming out of the Congress of Copenhagen, have any military forces assigned to him in his administrative capacity other than the one company that was with him today.\n\nThat wasn’t “any significant military forces.” It was “any” military forces as far his role as governor went. He didn’t have a militia. He didn’t even have a regiment. His situation was unlike that of the president of the State of Thuringia-Franconia, which had created a “national guard” when it was the independent New United States and kept it when it joined the USE; unlike Brunswick or Hesse, each of which had at least a nucleus from the central hereditary principality around which the new province had been formed; unlike the Main or Swabia, which had some remnants of the Swedish army of conquest available to the imperial appointee and General Horn with several regiments in the background.\n\nHow large would the military force that he didn’t have need to be? To cover the extent of the province, nearly three hundred miles from far northeast to far southwest? Looking rather like a large-headed serpent, the head in Holstein, that had swallowed a goose egg before its short tail petered out in the southwest at Bochold squeezed between the borders of the Low Countries and Essen. He would be surprised if the neck, the land bridge they had given him, was as much as forty miles wide.\n\nThe new Brunswick, from Harburg opposite Hamburg in the north to Göttingen in the south would be more like a hundred seventy-five miles. Only Thuringia-Franconia, from north to south, came close, and that jurisdiction would soon have a railroad through much of the distance; some had been completed already.\n\nHe pulled the paper off the easel and attached a fresh sheet.\n\nAt the top, he placed a random list of numbers.\n\nNobody knew how many people lived in the Province of Westphalia. Almost certainly fewer than resided in the State of Thuringia-Franconia.\n\nHe had the best idea in regard to Holstein, of course—Holstein as a whole, regardless of its various internal divisions among the branches of the House of Oldenburg. His father’s agents had tax registers; the pastors kept church registers. The war of the past fifteen years had not caused too much devastation. There might be two hundred thirty thousand people there.\n\nOn the left margin, he drew a round dot; the name of the region; the possible number of people. On the right margin, he drew a Luther rose as a symbol for Lutherans.\n\nThe Stifte of Bremen and Verden, together, he thought, would have less than half that, but not much less than half that. Here again, he had access to tax and church registers. Two more dots. More Lutherans.\n\nAnother dot. By contrast with those numbers, the city of Bremen’s population should be comparatively insignificant. Before the war, it had counted just under twenty-three thousand residents; even though its numbers had swelled, crowding the residences and spilling outside the walls, the Altstadt still could not have much over thirty-five thousand. And growing fast, of course. But in their ability to wield political and economic influence, the cities were always far stronger than their sheer number of people would lead an observer to believe.\n\nHe snorted. Consider the case of Hamburg, that inconveniently independent imperial city forming an enclave in the middle of Westphalia. A prosperous city which by, the logic of the up-timers who wanted to “simplify the borders,” should have been, along with its substantial revenues, allotted to Westphalia, but had managed to claw the status of an imperial city with a vote for its mayor in the USE House of Lords. Still, the city of Hamburg could not have over fifty thousand people within its walls, though it had managed to pirate from Gustav Adolf a significant hinterland that, by rights, should also have been allotted to Westphalia. And as people kept coming; as Hamburg kept growing; it would represent a constantly increasing threat to the success of Westphalia.\n\nIgnoring the nuisance that Hamburg would undoubtedly become to all his endeavors, he drew a new symbol in the right margin next to the city of Bremen. Calvinists. A book, symbolizing the Institutes of the Christian Religion.\n\nThere weren’t many people in the little land bridge territories that Oxenstierna’s minions had thrown into the province to connect Bremen to Osnabrück and Münster. All of the Lippe counties combined, with the addition of Hoya and Diepholz (whose records were jealously guarded by the Brunswick-appointed officials who had been administering them for a half-century), would not amount to fifty thousand.\n\nProbably.\n\nThat amounted to no more than “my best guess.” He drew a circle around them. And gave them both the Lutheran and Calvinist symbols. A mix.\n\nIn the southwest? Most of the church registers were kept by Catholics; he had no access to them. It was astonishing how many of the tax records seemed to have mysteriously disappeared.\n\nOsnabrück—the Stift as a whole, not the town, which at present was down to about six thousand inhabitants—had . . . probably more people than Holstein. Before the war, both Stift and town would have had quite a lot more, but the campaigns of the past fifteen years had not been kind. A new symbol, a papal tiara. Catholics, but mixed with Lutherans.\n\nAs for Minden—the city was perhaps the same size as Osnabrück, but the Stift, tucked as it was between Hoya and Lippe, was considerably smaller. And should logically have been put in Brunswick, given that the Lutheran bishop was the older brother of Georg, duke of Brunswick at Calenberg and ally of Gustav Adolf. He drew an auxiliary circle linking Minden to Hoya and Diepholz.\n\nTecklenburg—the Province of Westphalia had this little island of Calvinists by default, because it was tucked in between Lingen and Münster and had to be somewhere. Oxenstierna hadn’t even bothered to mention it, any more than he had mentioned Minden. Or Steinfurt, another little Calvinist island, with its non-university-degree-granting Hohe Schule full of Dutch students. A Calvinist island with Mennonites.\n\nEverybody deserved a few Mennonites. If they were in Altona and Wandsbek in the north, next door to Hamburg, then why not in Steinfurt in the south? The city fathers of Bochold had never been zealous about expelling them, no matter how often Archbishop Ferdinand ordered it. Moreover, when they were expelled, they usually walked across the border into the Low Countries, a matter of a couple of miles, and stayed there until things calmed down. He added a symbol for Mennonites—a fully grown adult trying to cram himself into a baptismal font.\n\nAnd Altona had a Jewish settlement.\n\nHe could use a better map than the one he had. For which he could use a survey team. Which he did not have and could not afford to pay if he could find one.\n\nMünster itself? Before the war, the town had some ten thousand people, not counting at least another fifteen hundred non-citizen residents, including clerics and students. The town had been down to eight thousand at the time of the Ring of Fire, but was filling up again, according to reports. He thought that there were probably ten to twelve thousand by now, with more coming.\n\nThe Hochstift, the prince-bishopric as a whole, Oberstift and Niederstift combined, had to be the single most populous subdivision of the province, even after invasions and epidemics. Well, the Niederstift not so much; the three Ämter of Meppen, Vechta, and Cloppenburg were large in extent, but thinly settled. Perhaps another fifty thousand people, quasi-Lutheran in the previous century; half-heartedly re-Catholicized over the past twenty-five years in spite of the strenuous efforts of the Jesuits. The Oberstift might be more populous than Holstein and was officially Catholic; in practice a mix of Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists. A minimum of two hundred fifty thousand inhabitants. Maximum? He had no idea; it could be a third more. Or twice that many, if you included those working as migrant laborers across the border in the Low Countries. He would count it as at least nominally Catholic. Another tiara.\n\nOverall? As a total? The new province contained fewer than a million people, he thought. Around nine hundred thousand. Fewer than Thuringia-Franconia, but it might well be the second-largest. Of those, perhaps a hundred thousand, at most, probably less, lived in cities and chartered towns—granting that Lemgo, Rinteln, and their like, each with five thousand or so, should be classed as cities and settlements of a thousand as towns as long as they had a charter. Which they should. They functioned as cities and towns, trade centers. Nienburg would fit with those smaller ones, except that it was in Hoya, which in spite of anything that the Congress of Copenhagen might have said, would effectively have to remain in Brunswick in the interest of brotherly harmony with Duke Georg.\n\nKiel in Holstein and Stade in Erzstift Bremen each had about eight thousand. Those numbers were firm, which was more than he could say about most of the ones he had been doodling on the pad in front of him.\n\nBefore he could establish a provincial militia, he needed a census, to figure out what the real personnel resources were and how they were distributed.\n\nBefore he could take a census, he needed some kind of central administration to conduct a census and execute other necessary measures.\n\nBefore he could staff and pay a central administration, he needed some kind of Estates or other legislative authority to grant taxes over this disparate body of hitherto unrelated entities so the province would have revenue coming in.\n\nBut, other than saying “elect one,” the USE constitution provided no guidance whatsoever on the subject of how one constituted a body of provincial Estates ex nihilo or even ex two dozen or more tattered remnants of medieval institutions whose existing members had no desire to cooperate with him or one another.\n\nOne had only to look at the cathedral chapter in Osnabrück. Of the twenty-four canons, the Domstift featured a small Catholic majority; the remainder were Lutheran—a division which reflected the confessional divisions in the region. Harmony was scarcely an expectable or expected achievement.\n\nBefore he could conduct an election . . . he needed a census and some kind of central administration.\n\nHe concluded his doodle with a flourishing circle and tacked the sheet of paper to the wall. Sat down and glared at it, harboring suspicious thoughts about Oxenstierna and Swedish intentions within the Union of Kalmar. Was Westphalia a province designed to fail? Designed to fail on his watch? Designed to humiliate Denmark—more specifically designed to humiliate his father—with his failure?\n\nAs he prepared for bed, one minor consolation occurred to him. At least most of the area spoke Plattdeutsch, close to Dutch and Frisian, rather than the Hochdeutsch of Thuringia, which might be an obstacle to any of the interfering up-timers who took an interest in what he might do in and for his new area of responsibility. The up-timers. Those. Diejenigen.\n\nUnless, of course, they were shrewd enough to send a properly educated, Latin-speaking, down-timer as an observer.\n\nAs to who the Swedes might send . . . for they would send someone . . .\n\nHe picked up his evening devotional reading, by means of which he was managing to combine the proper pursuit of piety with the prudent project of improving his English, given that God according to His gracious will had caused the arrival of Stearns, Cantrell, and their ilk into his own world, by each day completing a chapter of the recent translation that his Aunt Anne’s late husband had commissioned and the appointed committee had so successfully carried out.\n\nDeliver me from mine enemies, O my God; defend me from them that rise up against me. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the bloody men.\n\nPsalm 59. An imprecatory psalm, as his professors had called it.\n\nThou therefore O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.\n\nSelah indeed. The proper translation of the word was unclear, according to scholars of the Hebrew language. The Septuagint put it into Greek as an interlude or intermission. A pause to think about what one has prayed, perhaps? Or possibly, he thought quizzically, God had simply included a message to the choir director about how the passage was to be sung.\n\nEven if they return at evening; even if they make noise like dogs; scatter them; consume them in wrath . . . Consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.\n\nAnd at evening let them return; and let them make noise like a dog, and go round about the city. Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.\n\nYes, David had an outstanding grasp of how things worked. Frederik looked back, a few lines above where his finger marked his place. “Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.” A slain enemy could be turned into a martyr by his followers. An embarrassingly humiliated enemy, on the other hand . . . might be angry but frequently saw his support dwindling. May justice be done!\n\nHe recited Luther’s evening prayer from memory and went to sleep."
