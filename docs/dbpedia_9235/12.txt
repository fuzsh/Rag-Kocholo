Let me provide you with a little background of Bremervörde right away since it’s so interesting…

Sometime in the early 12th century, Lothar of Supplingenburg (who later went on to become king of the Holy Roman Empire) built the Castrum Vorde, the area just known simply as Vorde. Lothar certainly knew what he was doing when he strategically positioned the castle between the Elbe and Weser Rivers.

Eventually, Henry the Lion came to possess the castle in the 13th century and then later the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, forever changing the town’s name of Vorde, to Bremervörde.

Since the area dates back to the Middle Ages, there’s plenty of history in the area for you to see.The Parish Church Liborius dates from 1651, after it was redone after war had destroyed it. The Holy Cross Church in Brevern dates back to the 1880’s in a Late Gothic style.

The Brook Man Museum and the Stuhmer Museum are a wonder on the local history of the area, not too shabby for only 1 Euro!

The Brickyard Pape, gives an inside look into the lives of the worker’s accommodations and daily life, while the Stone Time Village, gives a glimpse of life in a hut village. The House At The Lake is a romanticized Lower Saxon Farmhouse, with Vörder Lake nearby. The farmhouse has a restaurant and cafe!

Oh, Bremervörde isn’t all history! It’s quite a bicycle and walking-friendly city with plenty of trails for those who are beginners to the quite advanced. It’ll be nice to experience the great outdoors at Bremervörde’s Nature Park and the Delphino Baths Spa. For only about 5 Euro (family plans are available), you can enjoy both the indoor and outdoor pool (with the huge slide) at Delphino’s.

Once you come to Bremervörde, you’ll just know you’ve found a terrific spot!
