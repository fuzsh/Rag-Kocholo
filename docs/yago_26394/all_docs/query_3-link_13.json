        "text": "The Four Seasons\n\nwork by Vivaldi\n\nItalian:\n\nLe quattro stagioni\n\nThe Four Seasons, group of four violin concerti by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi, each of which gives a musical expression to a season of the year. They were written about 1720 and were published in 1725 (Amsterdam), together with eight additional violin concerti, as Il cimento dell’armonia e dell’inventione (“The Contest Between Harmony and Invention”).\n\nThe Four Seasons is the best known of Vivaldi’s works. Unusually for the time, Vivaldi published the concerti with accompanying poems (possibly written by Vivaldi himself) that elucidated what it was about those seasons that his music was intended to evoke. It provides one of the earliest and most-detailed examples of what was later called program music—music with a narrative element.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nQuiz: Who Composed It?\n\nVivaldi took great pains to relate his music to the texts of the poems, translating the poetic lines themselves directly into the music on the page. In the middle section of the Spring concerto, where the goatherd sleeps, his barking dog can be marked in the viola section. Other natural occurrences are similarly evoked. Vivaldi separated each concerto into three movements, fast-slow-fast, and likewise each linked sonnet into three sections. His arrangement is as follows:\n\nSpring (Concerto No. 1 in E Major)\n\nAllegro\n\nSpring has arrived with joy\n\nWelcomed by the birds with happy songs,\n\nAnd the brooks, amidst gentle breezes,\n\nMurmur sweetly as they flow.\n\nThe sky is caped in black, and\n\nThunder and lightning herald a storm\n\nWhen they fall silent, the birds\n\nTake up again their delightful songs.\n\nLargo e pianissimo sempre\n\nAnd in the pleasant, blossom-filled meadow,\n\nTo the gentle murmur of leaves and plants,\n\nThe goatherd sleeps, his faithful dog beside him.\n\nAllegro\n\nTo the merry sounds of a rustic bagpipe,\n\nNymphs and shepherds dance in their beloved spot\n\nWhen Spring appears in splendour.\n\nSummer (Concerto No. 2 in G Minor)\n\nAllegro non molto\n\nUnder the merciless sun of the season\n\nLanguishes man and flock, the pine tree burns.\n\nThe cuckoo begins to sing and at once\n\nJoin in the turtledove and the goldfinch.\n\nA gentle breeze blows, but Boreas\n\nIs roused to combat suddenly with his neighbour,\n\nAnd the shepherd weeps because overhead\n\nHangs the fearsome storm, and his destiny.\n\nAdagio\n\nHis tired limbs are robbed of rest\n\nBy his fear of the lightning and the frightful thunder\n\nAnd by the flies and hornets in furious swarms.\n\nPresto\n\nAlas, his fears come true:\n\nThere is thunder and lightning in the heavens\n\nAnd the hail cuts down the tall ears of grain.\n\nAutumn (Concerto No. 3 in F Major)\n\nAllegro\n\nThe peasant celebrates with dancing and singing\n\nThe pleasure of the rich harvest,\n\nAnd full of the liquor of Bacchus\n\nThey end their merrymaking with a sleep.\n\nAdagio molto\n\nAll are made to leave off dancing and singing\n\nBy the air which, now mild, gives pleasure\n\nAnd by the season, which invites many\n\nTo find their pleasure in a sweet sleep.\n\nAllegro\n\nThe hunters set out at dawn, off to the hunt,\n\nWith horns and guns and dogs they venture out.\n\nThe beast flees and they are close on its trail.\n\nAlready terrified and wearied by the great noise\n\nOf the guns and dogs, and wounded as well\n\nIt tries feebly to escape, but is bested and dies.\n\nWinter (Concerto No. 4 in F Minor)\n\nAllegro non molto\n\nFrozen and shivering in the icy snow,\n\nIn the severe blasts of a terrible wind\n\nTo run stamping one’s feet each moment,\n\nOne’s teeth chattering through the cold.\n\nLargo\n\nTo spend quiet and happy times by the fire\n\nWhile outside the rain soaks everyone.\n\nAllegro\n\nTo walk on the ice with tentative steps,\n\nGoing carefully for fear of falling.\n\nTo go in haste, slide, and fall down to the ground,\n\nTo go again on the ice and run,\n\nIn case the ice cracks and opens.\n\nTo hear leaving their iron-gated house Sirocco,\n\nBoreas, and all the winds in battle—\n\nThis is winter, but it brings joy.\n\n(Author uncertain; English translation by Betsy Schwarm)\n\nBetsy Schwarm"
