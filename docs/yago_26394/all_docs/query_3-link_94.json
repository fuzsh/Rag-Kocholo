        "text": "This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here.\n\nTommy DeVito, an original member of the Four Seasons, the close-harmony quartet that rocketed to fame in the early 1960s with “Sherry” and other hits and earned new generations of fans when the Broadway musical “Jersey Boys” told a semi-factual version of the group’s story, died on Monday in Henderson, Nev. He was 92.\n\nFrankie Valli and Bob Gaudio, the two surviving original members of the group, announced his death. A spokeswoman for Mr. Valli said the cause was the novel coronavirus. Mr. DeVito had moved to Las Vegas decades ago after leaving the Four Seasons in 1970.\n\nGrowing up in difficult circumstances in his native New Jersey, Mr. DeVito was, in his own words, “a hell-raiser” as a youth, but he found a purpose with music. He formed a band called the Variety Trio with one of his brothers and Nick Massi, who would become the fourth member of the Four Seasons when that group coalesced in about 1960. (Mr. Massi died in 2000 at 73.)\n\nThe key component, though, was Mr. Valli, with his falsetto vocals. In a 2008 interview with the music publication Goldmine, Mr. DeVito recalled that his trio performed regularly at a bar in Belleville, N.J., when Mr. Valli, a teenager six years younger than him, would sneak in to watch them play. He and the other band members knew Mr. Valli from the neighborhood and knew that he had pipes.\n\n“I’d call him up to the stage and let him sing,” Mr. DeVito said. “He’d get off right away, because he wasn’t really supposed to be in there; he was underage.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
