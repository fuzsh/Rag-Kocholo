        "text": "September 15, 2000 - October 21, 2000\n\nBetween 1966 and 1972, Yoko Ono conceived of, produced and directed more than 16 films, a body of work which comprises a general assault on film conventions and occupies a unique place in the history of the American independent film. Highlighting her achievements in film and coupling it with a recent work, Ono’s exhibition at Ubu Gallery was comprised of two discreet parts that reflect the paradoxical aesthetic that Ono has always projected—the tensions inherent in the extremities of human emotion and natural forces. One segment was an exhibition of two groups of photographs (enlarged film stills) from two of Ono’s seminal films: No. 4 (Bottoms), 1966–67 and Fly, 1968–70. The photographs were made available individually and as complete sets in uniquely designed boxes containing a DVD of the source film. The other segment was a new, mixed-media installation of objects and photographs entitled Four Seasons.\n\nARTIST\n\nYoko Ono\n\nFurther information may be found on the artist’s website.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nExhibition checklist\n\nPress release\n\nPRESS\n\nThe NY Times Magazine / “The Widow Peaks” / September 2000 / Amei Wallach / 3 reproductions\n\nThe NY Times Magazine / “The Widow Peaks” / September 2000 / Amei Wallach/ 3 reproductions.pdf\n\nSculpture / An Interview with Yoko Ono: Art as Creative Dialogue / October 2000 / Erica-Lynn Huberty\n\nThe Art Newspaper / Photography this Month in New York / October 2000\n\nARTnews / “A Long and Winding Road” / October 2000 / Edith Newhall\n\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE FROM THE UBU GALLERY SHOP\n\nYes Yoko Ono\n\nSELECTED WORKS FROM THE EXHIBITION\n\nFounded in 1994, Ubu Gallery has presented almost 100 exhibitions of 20th Century avant-garde art, with an emphasis on the inter-war period of the 1920s-1930s, particularly the Dada, Surrealist, and Constructivist movements. Ubu exhibits paintings, drawings, photography, sculpture, and ephemera (books, posters, graphic design, etc.) and, wherever possible, highlights the interrelationships among these art forms.\n\nUbu Gallery is a well-known presence on the international cultural scene and enjoys a worldwide reputation for its serious explorations of areas covered by few other galleries, including acclaimed survey exhibitions of Polish, Romanian and Czech avant-garde art. Ubu’s focus on the avant-garde, particularly on historically important artists and movements that have not received appropriate attention, has earned the gallery frequent reviews in press throughout the world focused on the visual arts. Ubu participates in the most important Parisian art fair, FIAC, held annually in the Grand Palais (2010-2016), and has participated significantly in Art Basel (2003–2011) and the encyclopedic Frieze Masters fair (2012–2015) showcasing the best of antiquities to modern art, in Regent's Park in London."
