        "text": "Oh, what a night -- the night Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons got busted in Cleveland. But did it really happen the way the hit Broadway show \"Jersey Boys,\" which purports to tell the story of the Four Seasons, says it did?\n\nFuhgettaboudit.\n\nThe night in question is Sept. 6, 1965. And \"Jersey Boys\" -- which opens a five-week stand in Cleveland on Wednesday, June 18 -- tells it this way:\n\nThe band comes offstage after a big Friday-night gig. A cop says: \"Welcome to Cleveland. You're under arrest.\" They had failed to pay their hotel bill here the year before. The only judge in town is \"gone fishin',\" so they spend the weekend behind bars.\n\nPivotal scene, in the show and for the band. And the New York audience chuckles at podunk Cleveland, wherever that is.\n\nBut it didn't happen that way. And it didn't happen here.\n\nSo what happened, really and where? That's an interesting story. It gets fascinating if you also try to find out the story behind why the \"Jersey Boys\" writers changed certain facts. And it gets downright addictive when you toss in yet another \"Jersey Boys\" scene that is also set in Cleveland. But more about that later.Rahway 'Rashomon'?\n\nPop music fans don't want just the songs. They want narratives, too, the stories behind the music, whether true or fudged.\n\nThe Lads from Liverpool. The enigmatic Bobby Zimmerman. The Dreamgirls. The Hardest Working Man in Show Business. The Man in Black. The Boss. The Queen of Soul. The King.\n\nBut what's the narrative of the Four Seasons, the pop group with the angelic-sounding falsetto singer and the songs about girls?\n\nThere aren't any serious biographies about the Four Seasons, no movies about them, no publicity machine. In the age of the British Invasion, four working-class guys from New Jersey weren't exotic. Besides, the guys -- some with prison records and Mob ties-- shunned celebrity.\n\nBut, starting in 2005, there is \"Jersey Boys,\" which says the narrative of the Four Seasons is defined more than anything else by one thing:\n\n\"You ask four guys, you get four different answers.\"\n\nThat's a line in the show by the character representing guitarist Tommy DeVito, and its sentiment is reflected throughout the production.\n\nWhich means the true story of the origins and career of the Four Seasons may never be known.\n\nHere are some facts that appear to be actually factual:\n\nFrancis Stephen Castelluccio released his first single, under the name Frankie Valley, in 1953. A year later, he joined the Variety Trio. It evolved into the Variatones, which included brothers Tommy and Nick DeVito, and later became the Four Lovers.\n\nProducer Bob Crewe came on board in 1958, followed the next year by keyboardist/composer Bob Gaudio, who had a No. 3 hit with \"Short Shorts\" as a member of the Royal Teens. Bassist Nick Massi (born Nick Macioci) signed up in 1960, and the group became the Four Seasons.\n\nThe starting lineup -- Valli, Gaudio, Tommy DeVito and Massi -- stayed together until Massi left in 1965, with DeVito following in 1970.\n\nGaudio stopped touring with the group in 1971, but thanks to the \"Jersey contract\" -- a historic handshake deal in 1962 between Gaudio and Valli that is still in force today -- he and Valli have continued to record and produce, individually and with others.\n\nThe last of the Four Seasons' five career No. 1 hits came in 1976: \"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night).\" But under the Jersey contract, Gaudio and Valli continue to split everything they make, together and apart, 50-50.\n\nAs of today, that would amount to about $25 million each.\n\nEnd of relative certainty.\n\nBeginning of \"virgin territory.\"\n\nThat's what \"Jersey Boys\" co-writer Marshall Brickman (Woody Allen's longtime screenwriting partner) calls the Four Seasons' narrative, virgin territory as landscaped by Brickman and partner Rick Elice (a consultant with the Walt Disney Co.)\n\nThere was precious little solid information to go on.\n\nMassi died in 2000.\n\nDeVito has an unpublished autobiography, and he made himself available for interviews.\n\nA 1987 Time magazine article recounts the Jersey contract tale.\n\nBut Elice and Brickman say they got most of their information by meeting with Gaudio and Valli at a restaurant in New York.\n\nWhich restaurant? That depends on whether you ask Elice or Brickman.\n\n\"It was Joe Allen,\" the famous Restaurant Row haunt, Elice said in a recent telephone interview from New York. \"But Marshall will tell you Sardi's,\" a more famous eatery on West 44th Street.\n\n\"There's only one truth, and this is it: It was Sardi's,\" Brickman said in a separate telephone interview, also from New York.\n\nAnyway. Back to Elice and \"Jersey Boys\":\n\n\"But we weren't making a documentary. We were making a play, a musical.\"\n\nThey wound up with a narrative told by four actors playing the Seasons and punctuated by hit songs, occasionally out of chronological order. A nine-member ensemble plays dozens of smaller parts.\n\n\"The dialogue is invented and we conflated things, but all the events really happened, and in sequence,\" Brickman said. \"When Rick and I heard these stories from Frank and Bob -- at Sardi's -- I said, 'If we don't screw that up, it's at least a triple.'Â¤\"\n\nIt turned out to be a home run; \"Jersey Boys\" is still selling at capacity on Broadway after three years.\n\nBut as for whether all the events really happened or not?\n\nNo guarantees.\n\n\"We were all in the same car the whole time,\" Gaudio said via telephone from Nashville, Tenn. \"But sometimes we got the stories off by a few hundred miles or six months. So you can never really tell.\"\n\nWaiting for Columbus?\n\nWhich brings us back to that pivotal Act 2 curtain-raiser, the Cleveland jail scene.\n\nIt's important because it gets the audience back into the story after intermission. And it explains why Massi left the band in disgust, and why Gaudio and Valli froze DeVito out until he, too, decamped.\n\nDeVito, a slick card-sharp and hustler, got the band into debt with a loan shark to the tune of \"one-hundred-and-fifty large.\" That's New Jersey-ese for $150,000. To introduce the idea of DeVito's alleged financial imprudence, Elice and Marshall went looking for a telling moment.\n\nThe hotel-bill arrest scene, Elice said, was \"the most toothsome anecdote.\"\n\nIn the musical, all four of the Seasons get arrested in Cleveland at the Ohio State Fair. They're charged with not paying a $120 hotel bill at a Holiday Inn the year before. The judge is gone, and they're stuck in jail and spend the weekend discussing DeVito's flaws, Massi's dissatisfaction and Gaudio's anger.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture?\n\nCleveland audiences will get it instantly:\n\nThe Ohio State Fair is in Columbus, a city that, even when it was a cow town back in the 1960s, had more than one judge.\n\nSo -- again -- what really happened, and where?\n\nSome of the story can be told with a fair degree of reliability, thanks to:\n\n-- Arrest records dug out of the files of the police department in Springfield, about 45 minutes west of Columbus.\n\n-- Archives at the Ohio State Fair and a story in The Columbus Dispatch about the 1965 fair's final-day lineup.\n\n-- And a three-paragraph Associated Press report about the arrest and the concert that ran in The Plain Dealer.\n\nHere's what apparently happened:\n\nOn Sept. 6, 1965, a Labor Day Monday -- not a Friday -- the Four Seasons played a variety show hosted at the fair by TV personality Mike Douglas.\n\nColumbus cops arrested three of the Four Seasons -- Valli, Gaudio and DeVito -- at the fair, and transported them to Springfield, where they were charged with \"defrauding [an] innkeeper.\" They were accused of skipping town without paying a $375 bill at the Springfield Holiday Inn in July 1964.\n\nThey were processed by Springfield police, released at 9 p.m. on $500 bond each, and ordered to reappear on Sept. 17, 1965, at which time the charges were dismissed.\n\nBased on those facts, some fairly safe assumptions can be adduced:\n\n-- Massi wasn't arrested because he had probably already gotten fed up with DeVito and left the band before Columbus.\n\n-- The hotel bill of $375 equals $125 for each band member, which is close to the $120 Gaudio remembers, and the figure used in the show.\n\n-- The three band members probably didn't spend much if any time in either the Columbus or Springfield jails.\n\n-- And, finally, the charges were dropped because DeVito most likely made good on the arrears.\n\nBeyond those basics, the details remain confusing, mostly because the cops involved in both cities are retired or dead.\n\nMost mysteriously, there's a police mug shot that the Columbus Department of Public Safety claims was taken on the day of the arrest.\n\nNeither Gaudio nor DeVito's mug shot can be found by the Columbus cops, and Valli's has no ID numbers or charges listed.\n\nElice says the details, no matter how confusing, don't really matter.\n\n\"The point is that Bob never forgave Tommy after that,\" Elice said. \"That's the point.\"\n\nRock city redux?\n\nSo what was the point of changing the locale of the arrest?\n\nTo understand the convoluted reply to that query, it helps to know that there is a second scene in \"Jersey Boys\" that is also set in Cleveland, one of the last and most uplifting in the show.\n\nIn the interview, Elice said he knew all along the arrest didn't happen in Cleveland, but made the switch to add poignancy to the story, to \"bookend\" the band's moment of shame with a later moment of glory.\n\nAnd to do that, he didn't make an error; he simply took poetic license so that both scenes would take place in a city known for its rock 'n' roll heritage, Cleveland.\n\nOh yeah? That's not what Brickman said.\n\nBrickman said he didn't know anything about the arrest having taken place in Columbus and Springfield instead of Cleveland.\n\n\"I have egg on my red face,\" Brickman said. \"It was a mistake.\"\n\nWhatever.\n\nNow, about that other \"Cleveland\" scene.\n\nNear the end of the show, the band comes back to Cleveland in 1990 -- 25 years after they were arrested -- to be enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nHold it. We Clevelanders know from the Rock Hall.\n\nFirst of all, the I.M Pei-designed museum didn't open at North Coast Harbor until 1995.\n\nAnd while the Four Seasons were indeed inducted in 1990 (the museum began its collection of superstars in 1987 while plans were being made for the museum building), the induction ceremony took place at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.\n\nSo that night -- and oh, what a night -- that night didn't happen here, either."
