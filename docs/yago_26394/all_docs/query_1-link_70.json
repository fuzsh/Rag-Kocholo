Only time will tell!\n\n“The first international festival I attended as an actress was with a film THE ROE EFFECT at Cannes Festival,” said Nia. “10 years later, here I am as the Writer-Producer-Lead Actress of FOUR SEASONS. I am now steeped in my craft, fortified by things I’ve learned along the way and in gratitude for the mystic way my journey brought me back to the first film community that embraced my work, internationally.”\n\nCheck out FOUR SEASONS’ official website and trailer here!\n\nFILMMAKERS, CAST AND CREW:\n\nDirected by Kurt Williamson\n\nWritten by Nia Fairweather\n\nStarring Nia Fairweather and David J.
