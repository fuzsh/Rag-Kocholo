        "text": "Alan Alda (//; born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo; January 28, 1936) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, comedian, and author. A six-time Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award winner, he played Hawkeye Pierce in the war television series M*A*S*H (1972–1983). He has had recurring roles on television programs such as The West Wing, and 30 Rock, and has appeared in films such as Same Time, Next Year (1978), The Four Seasons (1981), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Flirting With Disaster (1996), Bridge of Spies (2015), and Marriage Story (2019). In 2004, Alda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in The Aviator. He is also known as Uncle Pete in Louis C.K.'s Peabody Award winning tragicomedy web series Horace and Pete.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nAlda was born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo on January 28, 1936 in the Bronx,[1] New York City. Alda spent his childhood with his parents travelling around the United States in support of his father's job as a performer in burlesque theatres.[2] His father Robert Alda (born Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo) was an actor and singer, and his mother Joan Browne was a homemaker and former beauty-pageant winner.[3] His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry.[4] His adopted surname, \"Alda\", is a portmanteau of ALphonso and D'Abruzzo.\n\nWhen Alda was seven years old, he contracted polio. To combat the disease, his parents administered a painful treatment regimen developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny, consisting of applying hot woolen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles.[5] Alda attended $1 in White Plains, New York.[6] In 1956, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Fordham University in the Bronx, where he was a student staff member of its FM radio station, WFUV. Alda's half-brother, Antony Alda, born that year (1956), also became an actor.\n\nDuring Alda's junior year, he studied in Paris, acted in a play in Rome, and performed with his father on television in Amsterdam. In college, he was a member of the ROTC, and after graduation, he served for a year at Fort Benning, and then six months in the United States Army Reserve on a tour of duty in Korea.[7][8]\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly acting[]\n\nAlda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during the 1958–1959 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation, appearing in productions such as To Dorothy a Son, Heaven Come Wednesday, Monique, and Job.[9] In 1958 Alda appeared as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show in the episode titled \"Bilko the Art Lover\". In the November 1964 world premiere at the ANTA Playhouse of the stage version of The Owl and The Pussycat, he played Felix the \"Owl\" opposite the \"Pussycat\" which was played by actress/singer Diana Sands.[10] He continued to play Felix the \"Owl\" for the 1964-65 Broadway season.[11][12] In 1966, he starred in the musical The Apple Tree on Broadway, also starring Barbara Harris; he was nominated for the Tony Award as Best Actor in a Musical for that role.\n\nAlda says he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse.[13]\n\nAlda was part of the cast, along with David Frost, Henry Morgan and Buck Henry, of the American television version of That Was The Week That Was, which ran as a series from January 10, 1964 to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in Gone are the Days! – a film version of the Broadway play Purlie Victorious, which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor George Plimpton in the film Paper Lion (1968),[6] as well as The Extraordinary Seaman (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller The Mephisto Waltz, with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of What's My Line?. He also appeared as a panelist on I've Got a Secret during its 1972 syndication revival.\n\nM*A*S*H (1972–1983)[]\n\nIn early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film MASH.[6] He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 2 1⁄2-hour series finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. It remains the single most-watched episode of any American broadcast network television series.[6] Alda was the only series regular to appear in all 256 episodes.[14]\n\nAlda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in M*A*S*H.[15] His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last.\n\nAlda's father, Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of M*A*S*H, \"Lend a Hand\", during season eight. Robert had previously appeared in \"The Consultant\" in season three.\n\nDuring the first five seasons of the series, the tone of M*A*S*H was largely that of a traditional \"service comedy\", in the vein of shows such as McHale's Navy. However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds \"comedy\" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda \"dramatic\" years (1977–1983).[citation needed] Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, \"I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that.\"[16]\n\nFor the first three seasons, Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together, but later, tensions increased, particularly as Alda's role grew in popularity. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season.[17] At the beginning of the fourth season, Alda and the producers decided to find a replacement actor to play the surrogate parent role formerly taken by Colonel Blake. They eventually found veteran actor and fan of the series, Harry Morgan, who starred as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, becoming another of the show's protagonists.[18] Mike Farrell was also introduced as Hawkeye's new roommate BJ Hunnicutt.\n\nIn his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of M*A*S*H ended.[19]\n\nDuring his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in The $10,000 Pyramid and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth.\n\nHis favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are \"Dear Sigmund\" and \"In Love and War\".[20]\n\nIn 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.[21]\n\nWriting and directing credits[]\n\nThe following is a list of M*A*S*H episodes written and/or directed by Alda.\n\nSeason Episode Credit One Episode 19: \"The Long John Flap\" Written Two Episode 5: \"Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde\" Written with Robert Klane Episode 23: \"Mail Call\" Directed Three Episode 16: \"Bulletin Board\" Directed Four Episode 4: \"The Late Captain Pierce\" Directed Episode 7: \"Dear Mildred\" Directed Episode 8: \"The Kids\" Directed Episode 16: \"Dear Ma\" Directed Five Episode 2: \"Margaret's Engagement\" Directed Episode 7: \"Dear Sigmund\" Written and directed Episode 12: \"Exorcism\" Directed Episode 19: \"Hepatitis\" Written and directed Six Episode 2: \"Fallen Idol\" Written and directed Episode 4: \"War of Nerves\" Written and directed Episode 7: \"In Love and War\" Written and directed Episode 12: \"Comrades in Arms, Part 1\" Written; directed with Burt Metcalfe Episode 13: \"Comrades in Arms, Part 2\" Written; directed with Burt Metcalfe Seven Episode 5: \"The Billfold Syndrome\" Directed Episode 8: \"Major Ego\" Directed Episode 14: \"Dear Sis\" Written and directed Episode 16: \"Inga\" Written and directed Episode 25: \"The Party\" Written with Burt Metcalfe Eight Episode 3: \"Guerilla My Dreams\" Directed Episode 11: \"Life Time\" Written with Walter D.

He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement.[6][22] He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, The Boston Globe dubbed him \"the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon\" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment.[23]\n\nAlda played Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED, which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, and was a guest star five times on ER, playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 TV movie And the Band Played On.\n\nDuring M*A*S*H's run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, The Four Seasons being perhaps his most notable hit. Betsy's Wedding is his last directing credit to date. After M*A*S*H, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his \"nice guy\" image.[6]\n\nLater work[]\n\nAlda has frequently appeared in the films of his friend, Woody Allen including, Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) and Everyone Says I Love You (1996). When asked about the controversy surrounding Allen in 2019, Alda stated, \"I’d work with him again if he wanted me. I’m not qualified to judge him... I just don’t have enough information to convince me I shouldn’t work with him. And he’s an enormously talented guy.”[24]\n\nFrom the fall season of 1993 until the show ended in 2005, Alda was the host for Scientific American Frontiers, which began on PBS in 1990.[25]\n\nIn 1995, he starred as the President of the United States in Michael Moore's political satire/comedy film Canadian Bacon. Around this time, rumors circulated that Alda was considering running for the United States Senate in New Jersey, but he denied this. In 1996, Alda played Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in Camping With Henry and Tom, based on the book by Mark St. Germain and appeared in the comedy film, Flirting with Disaster. In 1999, Alda portrayed Dr. Gabriel Lawrence in NBC program ER for five episodes and was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.[26]\n\nBeginning in 2004, Alda was a regular cast member on the NBC program The West Wing, portraying Republican U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Arnold Vinick, until the show's conclusion in May 2006. He made his premiere in the sixth season's eighth episode, \"In The Room\", and was added to the opening credits with the 13th episode, \"King Corn\". In August 2006, Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of Vinick in the final season of The West Wing. Alda appeared in a total of 28 episodes during the show's sixth and seventh seasons. Alda had been a serious candidate, along with Sidney Poitier, for the role of President Josiah Bartlet before Martin Sheen was ultimately cast in the role.\n\nIn 2004, Alda portrayed conservative Maine Senator Owen Brewster in Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film The Aviator, in which he co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio. Alda received his first Academy Award nomination for this role in 2005.\n\nAlda also wrote several of the stories and poems that appeared in Marlo Thomas' television show Free to Be... You and Me.\n\nAlda starred in the original Broadway production of the play Art, which opened on March 1, 1998, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play.\n\nAlda also had a part in the 2000 romantic comedy What Women Want, as the CEO of the advertising firm where the main characters worked.\n\nIn early 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Throughout 2009 and 2010, he appeared in three episodes of 30 Rock as Milton Greene, the biological father of Jack Donaghy, played by Alec Baldwin. In January 2010, Alda hosted The Human Spark, a three-part series originally broadcast on PBS discussing the nature of human uniqueness and recent studies on the human brain.[27]\n\nAlda returned to Broadway in November 2014, playing the role of Andrew Makepeace in the revival of Love Letters at the Brooks Atkinson Theater alongside Candice Bergen.[28]\n\nIn 2015, Alda appeared as a lawyer, Thomas Watters, alongside Tom Hanks as James Donovan, in Steven Spielberg's critically acclaimed cold war drama film Bridge of Spies which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.\n\nIn 2016, Alda gained critical praise for his performance in Louis C.K.'s acclaimed web-based series Horace and Pete as the irascible Uncle Pete. IndieWire critic Sam Adams described as \"his best role in years\".[29] In regards to C.K.'s recent scandal, Alda stated, \"I respect Louis so much as an artist. But he did a terrible thing, and I hope he finds a way to come to terms with both of those things.\"[30]\n\nAlso in 2016, Alda took part in the opening night show of John Mulaney and Nick Kroll's Oh, Hello at the Lyceum Theatre on Broadway. The show is said to be inspired by \"two old men at the Strand buying a copy of Alda’s book.\" Before bringing Alda onstage, Mulaney said, “This is genuinely the best guest we ever had.”[31][31]\n\nIn 2018, Alda began portraying psychiatrist Dr. Arthur Amiot in Season 6 of Showtime's Ray Donovan.\n\nIn 2019, Alda appeared in Noah Baumbach's acclaimed family drama, Marriage Story, as a warm-hearted lawyer who represents Adam Driver's Charlie during the divorce proceedings. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Alda discussed the effects of his illness, mainly Parkinson's disease, and other related issues. He stated, “I have this tremor. It’s not part of the script so I didn’t want it to be distracting if Noah thought it would be distracting.\"[32] Alda has received widespread acclaim as well as awards buzz for his performance.\n\nCharitable work and other interests[]\n\nAlda has done extensive charity work. He helped narrate a 2005 St. Jude's Children's Hospital-produced one-hour special TV show Fighting for Life.[33] His wife, Arlene, and he are also close friends of Marlo Thomas, who is very active in fund-raising for the hospital that her father, Danny Thomas founded. The television special featured Ben Bowen as one of six patients being treated for childhood cancer at Saint Jude.[34] Alda and Marlo Thomas had also worked together in the early 1970s on a critically acclaimed children's album entitled Free to Be You and Me, which featured Alda, Thomas, and a number of other well-known character actors. This project remains one of the earliest public signs of his support of women's rights.\n\nIn 2005, Alda published his first round of memoirs, Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned.[15] Among other stories, he recalls his intestines becoming strangulated while on location in La Serena, Chile, for his PBS show Scientific American Frontiers, during which he mildly surprised a young doctor with his understanding of medical procedures, which he had learned from M*A*S*H. He also talks about his mother's battle with schizophrenia. The title comes from an incident in his childhood, when Alda was distraught about his dog dying and his well-meaning father had the animal stuffed. Alda was horrified by the results, and took from this that sometimes we have to accept things as they are, rather than desperately and fruitlessly trying to change them.\n\nIn 2006, Alda contributed his voice to a part in the audio book of Max Brooks' World War Z. In this book, he voiced Arthur Sinclair, Jr., the director of the United States government's fictional Department of Strategic Resources (DeStRes).\n\nHis second memoir, Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself,[35] weaves together advice from public speeches he has given with personal recollections about his life and beliefs.\n\nFor 14 years, he served as the host of Scientific American Frontiers, a television show that explored cutting-edge advances in science and technology.[25] He is[when?] a visiting professor at Stony Brook University and a founder and member of the advisory board of the university's Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science [36] and the Future of Life Institute.[37] He serves on the board of the World Science Festival and is a judge for Math-O-Vision.\n\nAlda also has an avid interest in cosmology, and participated in BBC coverage of the opening of the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN, Geneva, in September 2008.[38]\n\nAfter years of interviews, Alda helped inspire the creation of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University in 2009. He remains on the advisory board as of 2013 .[39] He was named an Honorary Fellow by the Society for Technical Communication in 2014 for his work with the Center for Communicating Science and the annual Flame Challenge.[40] He is also on the advisory board of the Future of Life Institute.[37] Alda would like to use his expertise in acting and communication to help scientists communicate more effectively to the public.[41] In 2014 Alda was awarded the American Chemical Society's James T. Grady-James H. Stack Award for Interpreting Chemistry for the Public for his work in science communication.[42] He was awarded the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal in 2016 \"for his extraordinary application of the skills honed as an actor to communicating science on television and stage, and by teaching scientists innovative techniques that allow them to tell their stories to the public.\"\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 1956, while attending Fordham, Alda met Arlene Weiss, who was attending Hunter College. They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it.[43] A year after his graduation, on March 15, they were married. They have three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth, and Beatrice. Two of his eight grandchildren are aspiring actors. In an intimate interview, Alda revealed that Arlene sometimes will call him \"Fonzi\" in reference to his birth name \"Alphonso\".\n\nThe Aldas have been long-time residents of Leonia, New Jersey.[44] Alda frequented Sol & Sol Deli on Palisade Avenue in the nearby town of Englewood, New Jersey—a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury.[45]\n\nIn Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he admits to still praying on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one.[46] While he still talks to God on occasion, he admits it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief.[46] Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an \"agnostic,\" stating it is too fancy a word for him in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website.[47] He argues he simply is not a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own.[47]\n\nOn July 31, 2018, he appeared on CBS This Morning and announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years prior.[48]\n\nAwards and Nominations[]\n\nAcademy Awards[]\n\nYear Award Nominated work Result 2004 Best Supporting Actor The Aviator Nominated\n\nTony Awards[]\n\nYear Award Nominated work Result 1967 Best Actor in a Musical The Apple Tree Nominated 1992 Best Actor in a Play Jake's Women Nominated 2005 Best Featured Actor in a Play Glengarry Glen Ross Nominated\n\nGrammy Awards[]\n\nYear Award Nominated work Result 2008 Spoken Word Album Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself Nominated\n\nEmmy Awards[]\n\nYear Award Nominated work Result 1973 Lead Actor in a Comedy Series M*A*S*H Nominated 1974 Lead Actor in a Comedy Series M*A*S*H Won 1974 Actor of the Year M*A*S*H Won 1974 Lead Actor in a Drama 6 Rms Riv Vu Nominated 1975 Lead Actor in a Comedy Series M*A*S*H Nominated 1975 Directing for a Comedy Series M*A*S*H -
