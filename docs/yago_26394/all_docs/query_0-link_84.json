        "text": "Tina Fey is all set to star, co-create and executive produce the upcoming Netflix series, The Four Seasons. The series is based on the 1981 film of the same name, penned and helmed by Alan Alda.\n\nFey will be working along with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield on the upcoming series. Universal TV is producing the series. Alda, Marissa Bregman and Martin Bregman will serve as the producers.\n\nThe Four Seasons, which also stars Alda, follows three couples who take vacations together. How the dynamics of the group change when one couple splits and the man brings a woman much younger to him, forms the rest of the story. Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston, Sandy Dennis and Bess Armstrong formed the cast of the film.\n\nThe series will feature Fey in a lead role in a series after 2013's 30 Rock. She was recently seen in a recurring part in Only Murders in the Building and roles in films like Haunting in Venice."
