        "text": "Sam is honored to join this all-star cast in his 2nd production with Four Seasons. He was Jean Shepherd in A Christmas Story in the 2023 season. Sam’s other credits include Lemuel in the Book of Mormon film series with the LDS Church. And, long ago, he was The Plant in Little Shop of Horrors and Mr. Applegate in Damn Yankees at Morgan High School. By day, Sam works for a Seattle-based tech company and runs Azure Counseling, a therapy clinic in Logan, with his wife.\n\nCeleste Baillio has a BFA in Music Dance Theatre and Theatre Education from BYU. For the past 7 years she has been the Managing Director for Music Theatre West. Some past favorite roles are Mother in Ragtime(MTW), Lina Lamont in Singin in the Rain (MTW), Miss Hannigan in Annie (MTW), Katherine in Freaky Friday (FS), Morticia in The Addams Family(FS), Mrs. Meers in Thoroughly Modern Millie(FS), and Adelaide in Guys and Dolls (MTW). She is super grateful to her super supportive husband and four kids.\n\nClifton met his wife several years ago during his first Four Seasons show, and they have loved performing together ever since. Some of his previous Four Seasons roles include Captain Hook (Peter Pan), Man in the Yellow Suit (Tuck Everlasting), Bert (Mary Poppins), the Puppeteer for Toto (Wizard of Oz), and the Wolf/Steward (Into the Woods). Clifton loves the chance to be a stay at home dad with his two littles and smoke amazing BBQ that they don’t appreciate yet. (I didn’t want to share those ribs anyway…) He also studies stage combat and has choreographed fights for productions around the valley.\n\nIt’s been a busy theatrical year for Kyle as he has appeared in MTW’s production of Ragtime (Tateh), FSTC’s production of Anastasia (Vlad) and the Old Barn’s production of The Foreigner (Charlie Baker). The 39 Steps was the show circled on his calendar for 2024 and he is thrilled to be part of such a talented cast. A special shoutout to his amazing wife, Meaghan, and four daughters at home. Kyle is looking forward to seeing Megs in her musical debut in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat alongside his oldest two daughters. And finally, thank you, yes you, for supporting community theater!"
