        "text": "ABOUT THE SERIES:\n\nSpringtime in Parisian suburbs, winter in Nevers, summer on Brittany beaches, autumn in the golden vineyards of the Rhône Valley, and a perpetual search for genuine human connection throughout. Éric Rohmer’s Tales of the Four Seasons rounds out a final cycle on philosophical love stories. Shot on location in the 90s, the then-septuagenarian Rohmer made use of the naturalism and spontaneity of his actors by avoiding multiple takes. Starting in the suburbs of Paris, A TALE OF SPRINGTIME follows a burgeoning friendship between a philosophy professor and a pianist, culminating in one of Rohmer’s most emotionally unhinged films. Moving through the suburbs, A TALE OF WINTER, made two years later, culminates in a cosmic miracle for Félicie, who never loses hope of being reunited with the love of her life. The sun-kissed Brittany seaside of A TALE OF SUMMER observes the fickle nature of desire. Concluding the tetralogy with A TALE OF AUTUMN in 1998, Rohmer’s character schemes to find a new love for a reserved winegrower that descends into misunderstandings of human folly and foible that only Rohmer could handle with such humor and grace."
