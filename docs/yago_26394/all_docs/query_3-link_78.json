Having a show on Broadway was a bigger dream and now, a star on Hollywood Boulevard! Come on! ‘Only in America’ is an understatement. So, THANK YOU ALL FOR LETTING US REACH YOU WITH OUR MUSIC. And a personal note to my partner forever, Mr. Valli, for still doing the heavy lifting.” – BG\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the legendary Hollywood Walk of Fame for the City of Los Angeles and has proudly hosted the globally iconic star ceremonies for decades.

Since 1970, they have been known as Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons. The lead singer is Valli, Bob Gaudio on keyboards and tenor vocals, Tommy DeVito on lead guitar and baritone vocals, and Nick Massi on bass guitar and bass vocals.\n\nThe original Jersey boy, Frankie Valli, is a true American legend.

Over 200 artists have done cover versions of Frankie’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” from Nancy Wilson’s jazz treatment to Lauryn Hill’s hip-hop makeover.\n\nFrankie Valli and The Four Seasons have sold over 175 million records worldwide. Valli’s long-lasting career has led to the overwhelming success of the Broadway musical JERSEY BOYS. The musical chronicles Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons’ incredible career and features all of their greatest hits.\n\nThe JERSEY BOYS juggernaut has now been seen by over 18 million people worldwide, won 4 Tony Awards including Best Musical (2006), and is currently playing in New York, Las Vegas, London, in cities across the U.S. on a National Tour and The Netherlands, and will open soon in Korea.

Frankie Valli released TIS THE SEASONS, a holiday album, on October 14, 2016, on Rhino. His first-ever foray into jazz, the meticulously crafted album titled ‘A Touch of Jazz’ was released on June 25, 2021, marking a bold departure from his familiar pop sound.
