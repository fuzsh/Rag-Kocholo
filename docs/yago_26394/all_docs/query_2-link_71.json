        "text": "Alan Alda’s star turn as Hawkeye Pierce in the classic, still popular television series, M*A*S*H, had its roots in burlesque, the actor recalled recently.\n\nInterviewed by television journalist Jeff Greenfield at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, Alda said his father worked in burlesque and took his young son to watch “comics, chorus girls and strippers. It was quite an education, watching my parents from the wings. It was the best way to learn about theater,” Alda said.\n\nWhen he was nine, his father brought him to the Hollywood Canteen, where the two performed Abbott and Costello’s “Who’s on first” routine. “I was Costello and he was Abbott. I knew I had to be on stage. The warmth of the spotlight would flood over me, and I felt completely at home. I was in control of everything. You can’t give it up once you taste it,” he said.\n\nAlda said he never auditioned for the role of Hawkeye, but was offered the part because of his work on Broadway and in movies. He got the script for M*A*S*H—which ran for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983--when he was making a film in Utah State Prison; he called writer Larry Gelbart’s writing “the best thing I’d ever read for television.”\n\nAlthough he initially resisted taking the role—the show was filmed in California, while his family lived in New Jersey—he said he was able to do it by flying home to New Jersey whenever he had two days off.\n\nAlda said the Hawkeye character he portrayed was different from the Hawkeye played by Donald Sutherland in Robert Altman’s film of M*A*S*H, released in 1970. (Both were based on Richard Hooker’s 1968 novel, MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors.) “Sutherland’s Hawkeye seemed very depressed. Larry Gelbart’s character was much more lively, he had a sardonic sense of humor,” Alda said, adding that Sutherland’s Hawkeye was married, while his was not.\n\nAlda also said the Hawkeye he depicted “seemed so far from me. I had no idea how to play a womanizer who drank too much, was a smart aleck. I had to figure out how to be that person.”\n\nAnother difference between the movie and television versions of M*A*S*H, Alda said, was that the latter “could go back show after show. We could explore the characters in a way no movie could. The characters could deepen, they could change in their relationships with each other.”\n\nAlda, who said his “heart was always against any war,” said the only way the TV series of M*A*S*H “could make a point about war was to be truthful about the Korean War. We interviewed 200 doctors and nurses who were in the Korean War. I think that’s something that never gets thought about, that to a great extent, M*A*S*H was about real people.”\n\nThe series, he added “wasn’t going to be McHale’s Navy.” In fact, he said Gelbart and series producer Gene Reynolds “got the network to agree that there would be no laughtrack during the operating scenes.”\n\nAlda admitted that watching Harry Morgan (Col. Sherman T. Potter in the series) perform in the final episode’s final scene “choked me up. He kept me laughing all the time. He was devilish and adorable. He was choking up over saying good-bye to us. He was a lovely man.”\n\nAlda also said the cast never fully understood how popular the series—which had abysmal ratings in its first season but became a hit in its second season—was until the final show—to this day, one of the most watched in U.S. television history--was on the air.\n\n“We saw it in a theater and went out to dinner together, and it was our first understanding that we had a hit. The streets were empty,” which meant people “were home watching,” he recalled.\n\nStarring in the series “was an amazing thing,” he concluded. “When you’re young, you don’t know the role luck plays. We were lucky to have been thrown together. We had to learn a way to live together, learn the way to draw the best from each other.”\n\nAlda’s and Greenfield’s conversation was the first in a new series, offered by the Museum of the Moving Image and Comedy Hall of Fame, focusing on the impact of comedy, delivered through the medium of TV, on the consciousness of the American public."
