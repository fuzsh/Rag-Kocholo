        "text": "You could say that comedy is Will’s Forte.\n\nThe actor is the latest to join Netflix’s The Four Seasons, a series adaptation of the 1981 film starring Alan Alda and Carol Burnett. The movie followed three middle-class couples vacationing together across the different seasons. It was previously adapted into a show for CBS in 1984, which only lasted one season.\n\nHailing from Tina Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, the Netflix series — produced by Universal Television — will begin production later this year. Previously announced cast members include Fey, Steve Carell, Colman Domingo, Kerri Kenney-Silver and Erika Henningsen.\n\nReady for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well…\n\n* A total linear audience of 51.3 million watched the first presidential debate on Thursday night, across CNN and all simulcasting networks, down 30% from Biden and Trump’s first face-off in September 2020. Fox News led the pack with 8.82 million viewers, followed by CNN’s 8.75 mil and ABC’s 8.7 mil.\n\n* Lorraine Toussaint, who currently stars opposite Queen Latifah in CBS’ The Equalizer, will be a series regular in Prime Video’s The Better Sister, Deadline reports. The series delves into the awful events that drive a wedge between Chloe (Jessica Biel) and her sister (Elizabeth Banks) and ultimately bring them back together.\n\nToussaint will play Catherine Lancaster, a New York publishing giant and Chloe’s forward-thinking boss. An agreement between Amazon, ITV and CBS has allowed the actress to juggle both Equalizer and Better Sister.\n\n* Hulu has released a new trailer for the animated series Hit-Monkey, whose second season will premiere Monday, July 15:\n\n* The HBO doc FAYE, which examines the life and career of legendary actress Faye Dunaway, will debut Saturday, July 13 at 8 p.m., and stream on Max.
