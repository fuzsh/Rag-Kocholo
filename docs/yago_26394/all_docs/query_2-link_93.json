        "text": "The Senate may have been at peak prestige in 1978, soon after the Watergate hearings drove Richard Nixon from office, when the director Jerry Schatzberg shot a movie then titled “The Senator,” which both starred and was written by Alan Alda, whose prestige was also peaking, thanks to the TV series “M*A*SH*{: .small}.” Let’s not bury the lede too far: the film was released in 1979 under the title “The Seduction of Joe Tynan”; it co-stars Meryl Streep, who wasn’t yet a major star when the movie was made; and it’s playing tonight at IFC Center, hosted by my colleague Michael Schulman, the author of “Her Again: Becoming Meryl Streep,” who will moderate a discussion with Schatzberg after the screening.\n\nSchatzberg hasn’t made a feature since 2000 but is one of the most noteworthy directors of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. “The Seduction of Joe Tynan” was a significant departure from his first two features. “Puzzle of a Downfall Child,” from 1970, and “The Panic in Needle Park,” from 1971, both made in Schatzberg’s native New York, are two of the most boldly conceived and realized Hollywood movies of the time.\n\nThe first stars Faye Dunaway as a fashion model who, after a nervous breakdown, speaks her memoirs into a tape recorder for a photographer friend (Barry Primus) who wants to develop them into a film. The film’s intricate flashback structure gives rise to even further fragmentations, a series of flashes within the flashbacks, that pierce the time frame and suggest the shattering of the woman’s psyche as well as of the cinematic image. Schatzberg, himself a former fashion photographer, fills the movie with sharp details of the milieu, and the script, by Carole Eastman, balances boulders of pain on eggshells of identity.\n\n“The Panic in Needle Park” stars Al Pacino and Kitty Winn in a story of two young heroin addicts on the Upper West Side (the park in question is at Seventy-second and Broadway), and it raises their agonies into tragedy without grandeur. Both films were shot by Adam Holender and edited by Evan Lottman, and they, together with Schatzberg, seem to push and stretch and pummel and hack at the very integrality of their elegant yet frenzied images. It’s as if Schatzberg, having sought in movies a dramatic continuity that still photos couldn’t provide, were tearing away not only at that very continuity but also at his own sense of pictorial composition. In his third feature, “Scarecrow,” from 1973, a sort of existential road comedy starring Pacino and Gene Hackman, he looked to the performances by these fierce actors to pound away at the frame from inside. I haven’t seen his fourth feature, “Sweet Revenge,” which was scantly released in 1976, so “The Seduction of Joe Tynan” was going to be something of a comeback.\n\nAlda’s character, Joe Tynan, is a young, smart, eloquent, photogenic, and principled liberal senator from New York who finds his principles tested. A new Supreme Court nominee from Louisiana—a favorite of a friend, that state’s elderly Senator Birney (Melvyn Douglas)—turns out to have a racist past, and even a racist present, that ought to disqualify him from office, and Joe, whose support Birney seeks, must choose between his principle and his personal loyalty.\n\nOf course, the choice is no choice, and it’s no spoiler to say that Joe does the only thing he can do, which is the right thing—and when he decides, as he does early on, to oppose the nominee, he does so with gusto, leading the opposition and digging up the evidence that will reveal the nominee’s ugly views during hearings. The drama of the film is a separate tragedy—the way that, under the force of circumstances, doing the right thing can sometimes seem oddly wrong.\n\nThe circumstances here involve Joe’s family life. He’s married and has two children, a teen-age daughter and a preteen son, who live in a New York suburb. His wife, Ellie (Barbara Harris), has a degree in psychology and is in training to become a therapist, and the depiction of their mature, loving, and sexual relationship is harmonious, joyful, even exuberant. Yet the senator’s work keeps him in Washington and on the road for extended periods of time; he harbors Presidential ambitions, putting him increasingly in the limelight and increasingly on the fund-raising circuit.\n\nEven though his bold confrontation with the Supreme Court nominee is clearly in the national interest, is even the raison d’être of public service, it also serves his personal interest, catapulting him to a position of political prominence and leadership that he may be able to leverage for an eventual Presidential run. It also means that he’ll be spending even less time at home, becoming increasingly distant from his children and coming into increasing conflict with Ellie.\n\nEnter Streep. She plays Karen Traynor, a politically connected Louisiana lawyer who knows what the evidence is against the prospective Supreme Court Justice and knows where and how to find it. The senator brings the attorney onto his staff; he has to travel to Louisiana to do some digging under her guidance, and their professional relationship soon becomes a love affair. Does Karen (who is also married) seduce Joe? No more than he seduces her—and he does make the first move, one that she appears to have been waiting for. What really seduces Joe is his own ambition, the desire to rise in politics and gain ever more power—even though he believes, and has reason to believe, that he’d be using that power for the general good.\n\nThere’s a sleek yet relaxed precision to the film that mirrors Joe’s own breezy confidence and incisively intelligent bonhomie. Schatzberg films with a suave and elbows-out swing that doesn’t shade into swagger, an energy that doesn’t yield to turmoil—and its very imperturbability is its subject. The movie is filmed like a third-person confessional about the lives of others. Its story could be that of any professional in the public eye, including that of an actor, whose demanding work, long hours, and extended travel only increase with ambition and success—and whose connection with colleagues, who are a part of the business and share similar professional interests, experiences, acquaintances, and passions, threatens to overwhelm home life that’s detached from those enthusiasms and may often even prove to be a distraction from them.\n\nThe same principled emotional intelligence that makes work fun makes life hard. The dissolution and fragmentation that Schatzberg captures in \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" is under the surface of the cinematic image; it's of the directorial self-image, which fractures while the mirror and the lens are left intact. Then there’s the matter of scandal and secrecy, another aspect of the film that I’ll call a spoiler; let’s just say that it’s one of the fascinating emblems of the era.\n\nAnd Streep? As Schulman details in his book, the shoot of the film started just four weeks after the death of Streep’s partner, John Cazale, and she did the work as a much-needed distraction. She gave the character, at Schatzberg’s request, a light Louisiana accent, and it’s a performance that wears its artifice up front—as the character does. The contrast with Harris’s flayed, raw directness is apt for the drama. The last time that Karen is seen on-screen, Streep delivers a gesture of a theatrical elegance that, I’d bet, was her own invention; it’s of a piece with other theatrical inspirations that Schulman meticulously documents in his portrait of the rising star."
