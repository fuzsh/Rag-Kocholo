        "text": "Will Forte is headed back to Netflix for his next series role — and reuniting with his former Saturday Night Live castmate Tina Fey.\n\nForte, who’s coming off the comedic thriller Bodkin at Netflix, has joined the cast of The Four Seasons at the streamer. The series, based on the 1981 film of the same name, stars and was co-created by Fey. The cast also includes Steve Carell, Colman Domingo, Kerri Kenney-Silver and Erika Henningsen.\n\nFey co-created The Four Seasons with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield; all three worked together on 30 Rock. The film it’s based on, written and directed by Alan Alda, centers on three couples who vacation together each season and the changes in the group dynamic when one of couples splits up and the man brings a much younger woman on subsequent trips. Alda also starred in the movie alongside Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston, Sandy Dennis and Bess Armstrong.\n\nNetflix landed the show in January after a bidding war, giving it a straight-to-series order.\n\nForte and Fey were castmates on SNL for four years, from 2002-06, and he later had a recurring part on 30 Rock. His credits also include Netflix’s Sweet Tooth, Fox’s The Last Man on Earth and The Great North, and the movies Thelma the Unicorn, Strays and Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. He is repped by UTA, Rise and Hansen Jacobson.\n\nUniversal Television is producing The Four Seasons. Fey, Wigfield and Fisher executive produce with David Miner, Eric Gurian, Jeff Richmond, Alda and Marissa Bregman, the daughter of the film’s producer, Martin Bregman."
