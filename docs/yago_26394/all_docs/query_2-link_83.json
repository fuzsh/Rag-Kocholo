        "text": "PROJECT FRANKENHEIMER\n\nNick's review\n\nMin's review\n\nI have never seen anything like this. What a 60s zeitgeist time-capsule, a retro socio-political curio of inane proportions. Convoluted as all hell with sporadic editing between the present scenario and historical events, essentially a pseudo-documentary satire that splays the frantic players over the geopolitical backdrop of wartime while they try to fix their own personal problems on a perpetually drunk captain’s ship. Phew!\n\nAlan Alda pre-MASH is more than appropriate casting for such a vehicle, although it’s a helluva time trying to determine anything of articulation to come out of the thick, muddy waters that is film’s messaging. Also appropriate is John Frankenheimer in the director’s chair, as he had just previously come…\n\nWatched as part of PROJECT FRANKENHEIMER, along with Ziglet_mir and Nick Langdon. Check out their reviews as well!\n\nHooboy. I never thought I'd be longing for the days of 'pipe dreams' and 'tomorrows', but here we are. The Extraordinary Seaman is John Frankenheimer attempting a throwback screwball comedy for an audience which I'd be flummoxed if it still existed by 1969. I'm referring, of course, to the pre-pre-boomer boomers, and unfortunately \"OK Greatest Generation\" doesn't have quite the same ring to it. The use of World War II archival footage serving as a punchline for many of the \"jokes\" reminded me of Carl Reiner's detective farce, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, which is probably the highest compliment anyone could pay…\n\nPart 17 of Frankenheimer Fest, a retrospective being undertaken by myself, Ziglet_Mir and MushiMinion, check out their reviews here and here.\n\nWhen a director tells you the potential audience their latest movie is their best one ever, you're more than entitled to roll your eyes and exclaim phrases that aren't fit for the family dinner table because you know that's just so much marketing flannel. After all, they (and the studio) want to sell some tickets, because those Bel Air mansions don't pay for themselves. However when a director tells you that a movie is their worst you can probably believe them; why would anyone lie about their self-confessed artistic nadir? What have they got to gain by running down…"
