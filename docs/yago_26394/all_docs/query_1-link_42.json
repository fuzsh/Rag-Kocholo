        "text": "Colman Domingo is the latest addition to the cast of “The Four Seasons” series at Netflix.\n\nHe will star alongside previously announced cast members Tina Fey and Steve Carell. The show is based on the 1981 film of the same name that was directed by and starred Alan Alda with Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, Sandy Dennis, and Len Cariou also among the cast members. The series was first announced in January with an eight-episode order and is slated to begin production later this year.\n\nIn the film, three married couples take vacations together each season, but things are thrown for a loop when one of the husbands leaves his wife and begins bringing a younger woman with him. It was previously adapted into a 1984 TV series for CBS.\n\nDomingo is a highly-regarded star of both stage and screen. He recently picked up his first Oscar nomination for the film “Rustin,” for which he also received a Golden Globe nod. He won an Emmy in 2022 for best guest actor in a drama series for his work on the hit HBO series “Euphoria.” He has received two Tony Award nominations to date — one for best featured actor in a musical for “The Scottsboro Boys” and another for his work as a producer on “Fat Ham.” In television, Domingo is perhaps best known for his starring role in the AMC series “Fear the Walking Dead.” In film, he has starred in features like “The Color Purple,” “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” “Zola,” “If Beale Street Could Talk,” and “Selma.”\n\nHe is repped by Gersh, Liebman Entertainment, and Schreck Rose.\n\nIn addition to starring, Fey co-created “The Four Seasons” along with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. All three previously worked together on the beloved NBC sitcom “30 Rock.” All three also executive produce along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman, whose father produced the film, will also produce the series. Universal Television, where Fey and her Little Stranger, Inc. banner are set up under an overall deal, will produce."
