        "text": "By Ron Tennant\n\nThe Four Seasons of Frankie’s fruitfulness…\n\nMy wife Linda and I had booked tickets, way back in March, this year, to see a pop show in the Summer at the big Kursaal Theatre, in Ostend, on the coast of Belgium.\n\nWhat a Fab Frankie Valli night it was going to be! The show was to be on Saturday evening, July 11, 2020, and Frankie, now 86, was still performing – so special and wonderful. Tickets were about £90, £80 or £70 each, depending on where you sat.\n\nWe had booked to be on row 7, in the most expensive seats area. This is because we had never seen Frankie on-stage before, and who knows….. maybe he’ll soon decide to retire. So it was our first and possibly our final chance to see this legendary guy perform.\n\nWe were so looking forward to seeing Frankie and his current Four Seasons on-stage but in mid-May the show, with so many others, was cancelled because of the terrible Coronavirus problems all over the world. No plans have yet been made for Frankie and his group to come sometime to Belgium next year, so we’ve had our ticket money refunded.\n\nIf the Frankie show can be given a new 2021 date in Ostend, I will book two seats to see him. Sea-side town Ostend is about 30 miles from Beselare, the place where I live.\n\nThe current Four Seasons have none of the original male members that first performed their hits with Frankie from 1962 onwards. Back then, the originals were four guys Frankie Valli, Bob Gaudio, Tommy DeVito and Nick Massi. Since then, in the 58 years they have performed, Frankie has been the only one permanent performer, and about 40 other guys have since been members of the Four Seasons.\n\nFrankie Valli and The Four Seasons have always had a unique sound in pop music and they still do! The current Four Seasons are Erik Bates, Ronen Bay, Craig Cady and Joseph Ott. Frankie is an American singer, born as Francesco Stephen Castelluccio on May 3, 1934, in Newark, New Jersey, to a working-class Italian family. His mother nurtured his love of music at a young age and he was influenced by jazz, doo-wop and soul. The young Francesco would listen to some of his fave singers on record at home, and then he would practice what he had heard and liked.\n\nHe also realised he would need a good stage name, so he changed his Italian name to Frank Valley. In 1953, he cut his first record My Mother’s Eyes, and he was backed by The Travellers. In 1954 he became Frank Valli, and he joined The Variety Trio, and soon after, the group changed its name to The Variatones, and they found plenty of work on the New Jersey club circuit.\n\nIn 1956 they signed up with RCA and became The Four Lovers. They had a minor US hit with (You’re The ) Apple of my Eye, composed by Otis Blackwell, and they appeared on the ‘Ed Sullivan TV Show’, but their career went no further.\n\nIn the meantime, in 1954, Frankie had married his first wife, Mary Mandel, who had a little daughter from her previous marriage. Frank adopted that young girl Celia and with Mary, he had two more daughters. This marriage eventually split up in 1971. He later had two other wives, Mary Ann Hannagan (married from 1974 until 1982,) who had no children with Frankie, and in 1984 he married Randy Clohessy, his third wife, and they had three sons. In 2004 Randy and Frankie were divorced, after being married for 20 or so years. In 1959, Frankie recorded solo: I Go Ape, this time under yet another name, Frank Tyler: but it was not a hit, so he formed a new group called Frank Valle and The Romans. This group teamed up with New York producer Bob Crewe, and they were his session vocal group on productions released under different group names for two years.\n\nThen, after being called The Four Lovers, they evolved into The Four Seasons with Frankie Valli as the lead singer, Bob Gaudio on keyboards and also tenor vocals, Tommy DeVito on lead guitar and also baritone vocals, and finally with Nick Massi on electric bass and bass vocals.\n\nSince 1962, Frankie came to real fame when the single Sherry (written by Bob Gaudio), was their first American No.1 song. It featured the prominent piercing falsetto end of Frankie’s three-octave tenor voice range and it stayed at No.1 in America for five weeks, selling two million copies in the USA. It was also their first of many hits in England, reaching No.8 in October, 1962.\n\nIn late 1962, The Four Seasons released their first American album, featuring the song Sherry. Under the guidance of Bob Crewe, the group followed up with several other million-selling singles generally composed by Crewe and Gaudio, including Big Girls Don’t Cry (their second US No.1), Walk Like A Man (their third No.1) plus many others.\n\nFrom 1962 to early 1964, The Beach Boys were the only American band to be as successful as The Four Seasons in record sales in the United States. Frankie and his pals became one of the biggest pop acts of the 1960s.\n\nWhen The Four Seasons were on-stage, they emphasised the talent of their lead singer by saying they are featuring the “sound” of Frankie Valli. That sound, of course, was his amazing falsetto voice. Despite The Four Seasons record selling success, Vee-Jay Records was in financial distress. They had The Beatles on their record label for several of the early releases in America. But then the Vee-Jay company had their Beatles business all cancelled via Trans-Global and EMI.\n\nThis was followed by a separate royalty dispute between Vee-Jay and The Four Seasons, heading to court. The Four Seasons signed to Philips, but their change of record label did not diminish any of their popularity. In 1964, the British pop music invasion happened in America so even though The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons still had smash hits: usually, The Beatles kept all of the other groups away from the No.1 spots.\n\nIn October,1965,Nick Massi left The Four Seasons and soon after, Joe Long was permanently hired and stayed in the group until 1975. From late 1965 to 1967 Gaudio and Crewe began working on songs that Frankie could sing, solo-adult-oriented songs that did not rely on his famous falsetto. Songwriting for the group was then largely turned over to the team of Danny Randell and Sandy Linzer, who produced three straight giant hits Lets Hang On, Working My Way Back To You, and Opus 17. The Four Seasons also cracked the USA Top Ten with a gorgeous reinvention of the old Cole Porter standard: I’ve Got You Under My Skin”.\n\nBack in the studio, Gaudio and Crewe were still puzzling over songs that could give Valli his own identity. They finally came up with Can’t Take My Eyes Off You and this made Frankie a solo superstar. Released in 1967 in America, it went to No.2 in the Billboard charts and reached No.1 in Cashbox.\n\nAfter that, came two more solo hits: I Make A Fool Of Myself and To Give (The Reason I Live). But unlike many lead singers who achieved solo success and then left their groups and never looked back, Frankie actually stayed with The Four Seasons, producing hits in two parallel careers.\n\nIn the early 1970s, The Four Seasons finally had a cold spell. So Massi and DeVito both left the group and the line-up of members kept changing. But while Bob Gaudio had stopped touring with the group, he did continue to write songs and Frankie Valli remained one of the biggest names in the music business – and he was the only solo original member.\n\nIn October 1971, single “Whatever You Say was only released in the UK, under the name of Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons. When The Four Seasons (by then consisting of drummer/singer Gerry Polci, keyboardist Lee Shapiro, bassist/singer Don Ciccone and guitarist John Palva), mounted a major comeback in 1975/76 with their hits Who Loves You and December ‘63, Frankie’s name was no longer upfront. This seems to have been because Valli had made a comeback as a solo singer with his hits, so he intended to reduce his role in the group.\n\nIn 1977, he actually did leave that group, and so, in 1979, they all split up. In August 1978 Grease became his biggest hit as a US male solo vocalist. In America, he topped the charts with this song for two weeks, It was written by Barry Gibb as the title song for the movie ‘Grease’ and it is Frankie’s all-time giant solo record ever.\n\nThis record reached No.3 in the British hit parade. In early 1979, Frankie had been struggling to overcome otosclerosis, a rare disease that had threatened for quite a while to make him deaf. He underwent three operations before the problem was solved for him. Then, sadly, in 1980, he lost his step-daughter Celia in an accident, and six months later another disaster occurred…. his youngest daughter Francine died from a drug overdose.\n\nBy 1980, there was a pop-group re-union and the billing was back to Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons. The 1985 studio album Streetfighter used that billing, but in 1992, the release Hope + Glory went back to just saying “The Four Seasons” alone.\n\nMeanwhile, in concerts and most compilations, the credit: ”Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons” prevailed. From 1962 to 1978, they had sold more than 100 million records, even before the invention of CDs had prompted all of The Seasons fans and collectors to buy almost everything all over again. For decades after their heyday, Frankie & Co continued to be a top concert draw, and the radio constantly played their many classics, not to mention the new remixes that kept popping up in the charts. In 1990, Frankie and the other original Seasons were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and then into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nThese days in the 21st century, Frankie is hotter than ever. Thanks to the volcanic success of the giant winning musical Jersey Boy’s, which chronicles the life and times of Frankie and his legendary group, and all of their classic hits are the rage again. The musical play is now in its 14th sold-out year on Broadway, USA, and also all over the world, and it can be seen in Canada, Great Britain, South Africa, Holland, Australia, etc. Frankie Valli himself is packing concert halls regularly in America and also doing many shows in other parts of the world.\n\nBack in 2007, he saluted the long time he had been around by making his first studio album for 15 years Romancing The 60s. He put his own stamp on some of his own favourite 60s songs, the ones he had always wanted to record, but back then, they had somehow got away. This album was one of his most eagerly anticipated collections of Frankie’s giant recording career.\n\nIn 2014, a film called Jersey Boys was made, with the famous Clint Eastwood as director and producer. It was an adaptation of the highly successful Broadway theatre musical and it became an on-screen biographical drama all about singer Frankie Valli (played by John Lloyd Young) plus his partners Bob Gaudio, Nick Massi and Tommy DeVito. In that popular movie, 24 of their songs were heard.\n\nFrankie Valli has now, into 2020, sold more than 175 million records worldwide. Apart from many USA No.1s, he’s had in total, 30 American Top Forty hits with the Four Seasons, plus nine big hits as solo singer Frankie Valli, plus one Top Forty US hit in a group with some of his mates, called “The Wonder Who” group.\n\nSo far, he has won six Tony Awards. In Great Britain, from 1962 to1977, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons had 17 big hits, and as a solo singer, Frankie had five big hits from 1970 until 1978. Altogether Frankie has been singing and recording for 67 years now…..from 1953 until 2020. He even tried some acting, including an appearance on the TV series The Sopranos. When he does not perform on stage we can hear his music in films like: Voyage To The End Of Hell, “Dirty Dancing, Madame Doubtfire, Plots and The Lords.I n 1978 Frankie even performed the title song of the cult movie Grease, which became a big global hit.\n\nI hope that possibly sometime in 2021, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons come from the USA to Europe and perform on-stage. If that happens, please Fab Frankie, come and do a show in Ostend, Belgium. Linda and I will be there! A real and rare super-star… the unique and special living legend…the world-famous Frankie Valli.\n\nRon Tennant, a Brummie living in Belgium"
