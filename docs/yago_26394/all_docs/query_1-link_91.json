        "text": "The Black List is an annual list that names the hottest unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. The list was first published in 2005 by Franklin Leonard, a development executive who once worked for Overbrook Entertainment, the production company cofounded by Will Smith and named for his West Philadelphia neighborhood.\n\nThe Black List is assembled from a survey of Hollywood producers and other decision-makers, who vote on the top unproduced scripts they have read in the last year. Argo, The King’s Speech, Slumdog Millionaire, and Spotlight are some of the list’s shining alums. 2013′s American Hustle, a fictionalized version of the Philadelphia-associated Abscam scandal, has also been on the list.\n\nThis year’s Black List arrived Dec. 12 and included a screenplay about one of the most talked-about events to take place in Philadelphia in the last few years.\n\nThe script, called Total Landscaping, purports to tell the story of that day in November 2020 when Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, led by Rudy Giuliani, inexplicably held a news conference outside of Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a family-owned landscaping business in Northeast Philadelphia. During the news conference, held in a strip mall that also included a crematorium and a sex shop, the major networks called Pennsylvania and the election for Joseph Biden.\n\nSince then, the Total Landscaping location has become a popular destination, and the company had merchandise sales reportedly totaling $1.3 million.\n\nThe Total Landscaping script is credited to Woody Bess. Per the description, the screenplay describes “a day in the life of the employees of Four Seasons Total Landscaping and its neighboring businesses on November 7th, 2020: the day an average, working-class strip mall in East Philadelphia [sic] became the focal point of the most divisive presidential election in American History.”\n\nShould we be wondering what tack the eventual film might take, whether it will be filmed locally, or who might be cast as Giuliani in his most prominent movie appearance since Borat Subsequent Moviefilm?\n\nProbably not, at least not for a while.\n\nBess, the writer, is a Massachusetts native and USC grad, who is currently directing a movie and was not available for a comment. The Inquirer spoke to his manager, Jeff Portnoy, who is credited in the Black List listing.\n\nPortnoy described the script as “more inspired by a true story, than a true story,” and that it was based on extensive research done by Bess. The script has not yet been optioned, purchased, or taken any other steps toward becoming a motion picture. In fact, it may not become a film at all.\n\nPortnoy explained that the Total Landscaping script is what is known as a “stunt spec.” That’s when a writer writes a script, often of a TV series episode (but also sometimes a movie), in which the goal isn’t so much for the film to be produced than for producers, agents, or studios to notice the writer’s talent and hire that person to write something else.\n\nThe idea, Portnoy said, was to “put them on the map, and make a fun read for the industry … they get general meetings out of it and get agency representation.”\n\nThis was the case with the 2019 Black List script Barron: A Tale of Love, Loss & Legacy, which spun an imaginative tale out of a then-10-year-old Barron Trump sabotaging his dad’s run for president. That film, for various and obvious reasons, was never made, but its writer has since gotten studio work.\n\nThe Total Landscaping script, Portnoy said, is a bit “more producible.”\n\nThe screenplay was not written with the cooperation of the people who own Total Landscaping, but Portnoy said that should a major producer or studio come along, they would speak with the business’ owners.\n\nFour Seasons Total Landscaping did not respond to an email requesting comment."
