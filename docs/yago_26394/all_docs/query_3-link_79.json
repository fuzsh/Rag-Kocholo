        "text": "To bring it all the way up to now to \"King King,\" which wasn't really planned to do as let's do a song for women, and now let's do a song for men. It didn't go like that. And when I tell you that \"King King\" and \"Thank You\" I wrote in bed at about 1 o'clock in the morning — it was just God downloading the lyrics so quickly. I couldn't even believe it. As I was writing it, I was like, oh my goodness. It's gonna stop. It won't stop.\n\nHaving this kind of conviction for your testimony speaks to the spiritual nature of your music. How else does that influence your work?\n\nIt brings people together. I think it just falls to me in a space of responsibility. It's not anything that's separate from me. Often I'll let the music lead me. And if I listen to a track, and it's like, oh, this is great. But it doesn't incite power or purpose, I'll put that track to the side. When I'm ready to just rap about nothing or rap about how dope I am, I'll pick that up. But when I'm looking for something that I want a message attached to it, the music literally will lead me into the place where I need to be open to whatever God puts on my heart.\n\nSo much of what is said in \"Woman\" is who I am. And same thing with \"King King,\" it's what I believe. It's the times when I see guys in huge celebrations when they're winning, you know, trophies for basketball, and it is just like one of the most vulnerable moments to see them as they celebrate with their friends. You can see the pain and the anguish and the triumph and the tears. And it just brings chills all over my body.\n\nTo see that from these men that usually have to have these hard faces with this stance that's so mighty and strong. That's how I feel about, specifically men of color. No no one knows him. And so I wanted to celebrate them and then also their walk towards responsibility and not shying away from what it means to be in a long lasting, loving relationship.\n\nWhat about your relationships with men in hip-hop? I know you and Rakim just performed together on the same stage at Rondos Day in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nThe interesting thing about Rakim, he's probably one of the emcees I know the least about, on a personal level. But yet, whenever we're in one another's company, we have such a high level of admiration and adoration for one another. It feels like we know one another really well. I really give honor to that. However, there are others like Biz Markie and Heavy D and Chuck D and KRS-ONE. These are my big brothers in the business.\n\nRead more: On Rakim's 'G.O.D's Network (REB7RTH)' The MC Turned Producer Continues His Legacy With An All-Star Cast\n\nThose are people that would just call me and say, \"What is going on? How are you feeling?\" Or they'll see some performance… That's Big Daddy Kane. He's gonna tell me, \"I like what you was wearing on there,\" or \"I like the energy.\" It's all of these moments where I am the little sister. You know, they've seen me grow up in this business. And many times over, they've assisted in some capacity.\n\nIt's so funny how many layers, relationships exist within hip-hop, and you may not know it because you don't see it. But we know that, you know, that connection is real.\n\nHas your songwriting or creative process evolved through the years?\n\nYeah. Absolutely. There's a few things that have happened. One, when you're in the spell of writing, stay there. When I was younger…you leave a song open ended to have to try to find the same sentiment days later. And it may not be there. And so [I've learned] to stay still during the writing process. And then I've also learned much more melody than usual.\n\nComing from New York, we have a way of wanting to put all the words that we can find to show how dope and how advanced we are as emcees. And I think for me to be able to slow down on this record and find melody and nuances that weren't as important to me before, I think that it really benefited me with this record, and that's where I will give the credit to Warryn to push me.\n\nI remember long ago, I was talking to Nelly, and I was about to embark upon a new album. It might have been 14 years ago. But what Nelly began to explain to me, is that \"I lived in New York for a summer, you guys moved so quickly. It's no wonder you all rap like that.\" He said, \"Where we're from, we're driving to our destinations.\" I think that was brought to the forefront for me here with this album. I'm not in a rush. I don't need a lot of tricks with what it is that I'm saying because what I'm saying is real. And it's important. I don't need a lot of influence. You know, I'm simply speaking. It's just real talk, and I think we haven't had that for some time.\n\nYou live in Los Angeles now, but do you get back to New York?\n\nI've lived in Brooklyn. I've lived in Manhattan. I've lived in Queens, and I've lived in Jersey. And then I came to California. I've been in California for some time now. But I go back and forth often enough that I don't really feel like I'm missing anything. I'm going back this first week of August, which is pretty exciting, doing a lot of press for the album, and then also, performing at Wingate Park, which is where I attended high school.\n\n**Speaking of, where are we going to see MC Lyte performing soon?**\n\nI'm on the Queens of R&B tour. So we did Atlanta, Charlotte, New York, and then Madison Square Garden. There's going to be a show [in Los Angeles] at the [Kia] Forum. Cincinnati Music Festival, I'm performing out there, and I'm doing \"King King,\" bringing them, you know, some new music at the same time, which is pretty exciting.\n\nYou also have a full plate with your other endeavors: acting, voice overs, mentorship. Do you get fuel from these different activities to inspire the other work you do?\n\nAbsolutely. I'm actually on set now. I played detective Monroe in a [BET] show called \"Angel.\" I'm on set all week with this.\n\nWe have a full fledged production and management company [Sunni Gyrl]. Right now, our premier talent is Van Van, who is an internet sensation turned actor, recording artist. She's actually 5; she just released her first album. She also plays a character called Vancy with Snoop Dogg on Doggyland.\n\nWe've got other talent, gospel singers, Dave Hollister. And then production wise, we had a sitcom that I wrote [\"Partners in Crime\"], we've got a few deals around town with different projects, TV shows, cooking shows, competitive shows. I just signed on to be music supervisor for a short film called The Memo, by a new company called A Seed Productions and it's pretty powerful. I'm looking forward to all that comes from that.\n\nBut, yeah, each day it's a different hat. It makes it completely exciting.\n\nWhat drives you to continue to commit yourself to mentorship and fostering new talent in the next generation through all that you're doing through Sunni Gyrl?\n\nIt just feels it feels like the right thing to do. I don't know any other way. And it's crazy because I meet people all the time that had met me at a younger age. And they say to me, \"You said this to me and that really mattered at that time. I wanna tell you what it did for me.\"\n\nMy close friends would call me grandma because I'm always imparting something that can be used later — and I don't even know that I'm really doing it. I'm just talking. It's just the idea of never being afraid to share your weaknesses and your shortcomings. Just being an open book to help someone else get to the next step, the next phase.\n\nThere have been some autobiographies that I've read throughout time, and you know the ones that are just ink on the page. And you know the ones that had to see past their tears to actually write it. And that alone is what brings people closer to you. It's the human bond. And if you're willing to just be that open book, so many people can learn from what it is that you're saying. And it may not even be what you're saying. It could be the cornerstone for them to go get the knowledge or, you know, educate themselves about something completely different. I think as an emcee, I have to really be in tune with the power that I have and that words are powerful and have meaning. And so why not use them, responsibly and purposefully?\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about the importance of listening? And have you always felt like a good listener?\n\nNo. Even now, it's still a struggle with me. You know, acting is all about listening.\n\nI think a lot of times [what] we do in life is we take the part that incites some sort of reaction, and then we don't even pay attention to what was said before or after. For me, it's important that I slow down in order to listen. Because first off, I'm quick. And so are a lot of other people.\n\nI've tasked myself each and every day with slowing down enough to listen.\n\nListening during acting has taught me how to listen in life. And that not everything said deserves a response or requires a response. It's the admittance of not knowing that's humbling.\n\nHow do you find the energy? What is the source of this well that you're continually pouring from?\n\nThe source: God. That's all I can attribute it to, because it's certainly not me. I just allow myself to be used as the vessel to get the thing done. It's a part of the dream. So while I'm doing it, I'm just grateful like, wow. I asked for this. Oh, yeah. And I asked for that. And so I only ask that God give me the wherewithal to handle it as it comes and also to say no to the things that I just don't have time to do and don't fulfill the ultimate goal.\n\nWhat artists today are you excited about or you're listening to?\n\nI love what Common and Pete Rock are doing right now. Rapsody, Tierra Whack. I listen to a lot of people in terms of Kendrick, in terms of Drake. And, I listen to Tems.\n\nI just hope that the new artists coming in today find their strength at an earlier turn than a lot of us.\n\nA lot of times, I believe artists understand who they are much more when they've gone out into the world and understand how blessed they are to even be in the position to speak their minds. There are plenty of places where not just women, but anyone who wants to speak out against the system, or disagree with a certain politic, or a political stance, or political agenda [cannot].\n\nWhat other advice would you give a younger you or artists coming up now?\n\nSurround yourself with people that have your best interest. And when you're young, you don't really know who those people are. But I would just say what you see, believe it. And you can see things much better than what you're told. Because people lie. Unfortunately, if everybody told the truth, then I wouldn't have to advise you to watch people show you much better than they tell you anything.\n\nThere's always room for improvement and to stay focused on what it is that you started out with. Because many times, there will be distractions. There will be distractions along the way, and you wanna make sure that you reach the intended goal. And know what you're in it for.\n\nDid you feel like you saw a shift in your audience after that? You said that it opened up your music to new generations, but was that a tangible thing?\n\nYeah, I witnessed it. I felt it.\n\n[The night it aired], I found a place to hide in the [\"SNL\"] building while everyone was watching it, because if they [didn't] like it, I [didn't] really want to go through that. And they loved it.\n\nJohn Mayer was there that night — he's a friend of mine from Connecticut. And he said to me, \"Tomorrow, you're gonna see something you've never seen before.\" And I said, \"Well, tell me it's gonna be good.\" And he said, \"No, no, they're gonna love this.\"\n\nThe next day, I came downstairs, and my daughter was at the kitchen table, reading the quotes that were coming in from people, their responses to the video. She looked at me and said, \"Dad, you're not going to believe what's going on.\"\n\nFrom that time on, younger people in the streets would recognize me — it would be about \"Jack Sparrow\" and about the comedy, when for many, many years before, it was always about long hair, the hits, my rock days. The people who love this video were eager to hear what I was doing next musically.\n\nWas comedy something that you were passionate about before then? Or something that you wanted to bring into your career?\n\nI've always loved it from a certain distance, because my primary focus was music since I can remember. I was probably around 11 or 12 years old when I picked up my first guitar. I was listening to a lot of blues, like the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. I fell in love with the blues and started playing electric guitar, and put together a band. I knew what I wanted to do, and it was make music.\n\nBut comedy was something I loved. I was constantly in trouble with the principal at my school, because I couldn't take the work seriously. When they found out that I was being signed to Columbia Records, to Epic Records, they stopped putting pressure on me to cut my hair. And the next thing we all knew, I was having a career in the business. But it took me 18 years to have my first hit.\n\nSo many people would have given up after waiting that long. What kept you going?\n\nWhat kept me going was that love for it. I'm grateful that I was surrounded by women most of my younger life. And my mother was so supportive of me pursuing music [growing up], and [now] I have three daughters.\n\nBut if I knew how hard it was going to be, I'm not sure I would've made the trek. Because there was so much time when there were no paychecks coming. And you're in the music business in Connecticut, if it snows, your concert is closed. So the promoters will call and apologize, but when you hang up the phone, you realize you have to figure out how you're going to feed your kids at night. That's the most intense pressure and excruciating experience for the \"starving artist\" syndrome — the reality that you may not be able to provide for your family.\n\nWe were getting eviction notices and our landlord would beg me to make sure the next check didn't bounce. So I started writing songs for other artists, and I was able to put full focus on my next record, and the one after that, and the one after that in '83. It all came together.\n\nI tell young people that, whenever somebody says, \"I've been at this for 10 years already,\" I say, \"It took me 18 for my first hit, so don't give up. But know that it can take that long. And when it does finally happens, it's an even greater success story.\"\n\nWhen you look back at your catalog, which song — or songs — feel the most like the artist that you set out to be?\n\nProbably a combination of a few. The biggest hit that I've had is \"How Am I Supposed To Live Without You?\" It went to everyone twice because I released it again. It was [originally] released by Laura Branigan, and it did really well with her.\n\nAbout eight, nine years later, I released it myself as an artist compared to just being a songwriter. And something else happened — that version is much bigger than the first time around.\n\nAt the same time, \"Said I Loved You, But I Lied\" is one of my favorite records that I've ever made.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nMutt Lange was my producer, and he's always done something very different that makes the record itself stand out in the middle of these hit songs — and none of them specifically sound like a Mutt Lange record.\n\nIt's pretty amazing, the good fortune of finally doing what I love to do on my own terms. And that's what happens when you have enough success.\n\nWhat's a standout memory for you from everything that you've done?\n\nI had a chance to sing with Luciano Pavarotti. And I am a tenor — we don't use the term tenor or baritone or anything like that in pop music. But when a tenor hears another tenor on the radio, you stop what you're doing and you listen to how these high notes get sung and held for a long time. The control and the power that the great tenors had is something that really excited me, and I had the opportunity to work with all three tenors and do something that I had never, ever dreamed.\n\nIt took me about two months to learn Italian and to learn opera. I was up until 5, 6 o'clock in the morning, almost every night trying to absorb it all before this performance in Italy in Pavorotti's home city.\n\nI can only imagine trying to actually sing something like that, let alone on stage, with one of the most iconic stars from that country.\n\nIt was very daunting. Exciting, like, otherworldly. But it was very, very daunting.\n\nPavarotti walked in after we were warming up the orchestra. It was an outside venue, an amphitheater, and Princess Di was in the front row. Bono was on stage during a song or two.\n\nWe began getting ready, and Pavarotti heard me singing with the opera, and he walked over to me. I was nervous. And he said, \"I see you have been studying the tenor.\"\n\nI said, \"Actually, I've been studying you. And I don't know what I've been doing with my voice all these years.\" He smiled ear to ear and said, \"You do not sell as many records as you have if you're not doing the right thing. Let's rehearse.\"\n\nThat was the beginning of our friendship.\n\nHow does the career that you've built compare to what you envisioned for yourself when you were first starting out in the business?\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm the Forrest Gump of the music business. Because each scene, I'm standing next to Stevie Wonder, or Ray Charles, or Pavarotti, or Paul McCartney, or somebody who's a part of my love of music and were a powerful influence on me. I never thought, One day I'd love to meet this person or with this person. It just happened. When it finally started happening, it just became surreal. Dream-like.\n\nWhat's left on the Michael Bolton bucket bucket list?\n\nI think there's definitely some more recording to do. There is also definitely more streaming television, film, comedy. And maybe it's a musical, maybe it's a film, I'm not sure, but there are a couple of projects looming.\n\nAt the same time, when we got offered to do the Lonely Island \"Jack Sparrow\" video, it was a surprise. So I'm kind of thinking that what's gonna happen it's gonna reveal itself, and surprise me again.\n\nDo you think you'd ever do another Lonely Island thing, was that such a moment that you can't really repeat it?\n\nI would do it in a heartbeat if the script had \"funny\" written all over it. That's the only sin you can have with comedy, is for it not to be funny. Then you can't get away with anything.\n\nLiving Legends: Duran Duran Are Still Hungry After All These Years"
