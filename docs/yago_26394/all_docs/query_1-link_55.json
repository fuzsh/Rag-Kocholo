Q&A to follow.\n\nFilm Synopsis:\n\nBlossoms, burning sands freezing winds, snow: nature reconciles opposites in its relentless dance of the seasons. In this film, flamenco music and dance, not shy of extremes, sways freely with the four quarters of our planet’s cycle around the sun. Original choreographies filmed in extraordinary locations to newly composed classical-flamenco fusion music take viewers on a journey through time and space. In the tradition of classical composers (like Vivaldi and Haydn) and the great Japanese poets, this cinematic exploration of our relationship to the mutations of the spinning earth, reconnects us to what is most essential. The seasons have an intense impact on the nature of our lives, our feelings, our energies both at individual and communal levels. Directed by Lina Kazan and Daniel Regnier, this roughly 60-minute music and dance film is a poetic dialogue with a whole year of nature’s flux.\n\nCamp Wolf Willow Sauna Sessions\n\nBack2Nature Wellness and Events\n\nVarious Times\n\nFriday Nights Classic- Saskatoon Car Show\n\n5:00PM - 9:30PM\n\nShakespeare on the Saskatchewan\n\nShakespeare on the Saskatchewan\n\nVarious Times\n\n'Mud Matters' an exhibit by Charley Farrero and Evan Quick\n\nSaskatchewan Craft Council Gallery\n\n11:00am - 5:00pm\n\nSaskatoon Riverbank Bird Walk\n\n1:30 PM - 3:30 PM\n\nCocktail Class\n\nBlack Fox Farm & Distillery\n\n1:00 PM - 2:00 PM\n\nWarbler Walking Tour\n\n8:30 AM - 10:30 AM\n\nBlack Fox Flower Class - Intro\n\nBlack Fox Farm & Distillery\n\n3:00 PM - 5:00 PM\n\nUkrainian Day in the Park\n\nGanbatte Convention 2024\n\nGanbatte Convention Inc.\n\n10:00am - 10:00pm (both days)"
