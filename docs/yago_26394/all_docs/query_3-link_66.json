        "text": "Steve Carell is reuniting with Tina Fey and Universal Television.\n\nThe Office grad has closed a deal to co-star in Netflix’s The Four Seasons, the update of the 1981 Alan Alda feature film of the same name. The role reunites Carell with Tina Fey after the duo starred as a married couple in the 2010 movie Date Night.\n\nOrdered straight-to-series in January after Netflix won the show following a bidding war after the conclusion of last year’s dual strikes, the adaptation was co-created by Fey and her fellow 30 Rock alums Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield.\n\nProduction on the series is slated to begin later this year. The original film, written and directed by Alda, revolves around three couples who take vacations together each season and explores the changes in the group dynamic when one of couples splits up and the man brings a much younger woman on subsequent trips. The cast of the original also included Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston, Sandy Dennis and Bess Armstrong.\n\nThe Four Seasons hails from Universal Television, where Fey’s Little Stranger banner has been based with an overall deal for years. The series also marks a reunion for Carell with Universal TV, which produced NBC’s update of The Office.\n\nExecutive producers on the series include Fey, Fisher and Wigfield — who all teamed on the Emmy-winning final season of 30 Rock (which coincidentally featured Alda in a recurring role) — along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman, daughter of the film’s producer, Martin Bregman, will be credited as producers.\n\nCarell’s return to Netflix in a TV series follows his two-season turn on Space Force, which marked a reunion for the award-winning actor with The Office creator Greg Daniels (who is now revisiting the series with a new take for Universal TV). He next will be seen in the IF feature film about imaginary friends, written and directed by The Office alum John Krasinski. He’s making his Broadway debut in Uncle Vanya and, this summer, will reprise his role for Universal’s animated Despicable Me 4. His most recent TV credit was the FX series The Patient.\n\nThe Four Seasons marks Fey’s first lead acting role in a series since 30 Rock wrapped its run in 2013. Her TV history with Netflix includes Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (which the streamer picked up when Universal TV sold them the show after NBC’s pass); the animated series Mulligan; and the third season of Girls5eva, the Fey-produced musical comedy that ran for its first two seasons on Peacock. Fisher also returns to Netflix after co-creating Never Have I Ever. Wigfield’s credits include NBC’s Great News and Peacock’s Saved by the Bell update.\n\nCarell is repped by WME, MediaFour Management and attorney JSSK."
