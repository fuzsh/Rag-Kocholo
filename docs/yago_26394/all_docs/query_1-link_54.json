Love, elusive, immanent, imagined, or manifest, is the point around which each of Rohmer’s Tales of the Four Seasons revolves. The films are grounded by geography: springtime in Paris and its suburbs; summer on Brittany beaches; autumn in sunny Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux; and winter between damp, gray Paris and Nevers. Places are characters, and landscape, landmarks, and architecture are central to the stories. Made in the 1990s, when the septuagenarian director was at the height of his powers, the Seasons have a light and lucid naturalism and spontaneity made possible by Rohmer’s careful planning and economical approach. Rohmer shot on location and avoided multiple takes. His characters are preoccupied with, and converse about, their desires and doubt, sometimes dreaming and sometimes scheming to orchestrate the outcome they think they want. Rohmer’s distinctive unobtrusive style—a genre unto itself—has inspired generations of filmmakers including Mia Hansen-Løve, Hong Sang-soo, Richard Linklater, and Kathleen Collins (see Collins’s Losing Ground on BAMPFA’s streaming platform starting May 28). Mary Stephen, editor of three of the Seasons, notes, “They are deceptively simple, and deceptively talkative and slow. But when you take apart a Rohmer film from an editing point of view, there’s no wastage in it—every scene propels it forward. Yet they are psychologically complex, never yielding to a black-and-white rendition of the human heart.”\n\n—Kate MacKay, Associate Film Curator"
