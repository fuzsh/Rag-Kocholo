        "text": "Alan Alda is arguably the most jovial person on the planet. As such, the Oscar-nominated actor did not strike us as the litigious type. But several minutes into his phone call with Vanity Fair, while discussing his role as a divorce attorney in Marriage Story, he announced, “I love a good lawsuit.” His delivery was cheerful but his message was serious. “If somebody’s wronging you, it’s good to set them straight.”\n\nAlda’s first brush with the courtroom came when the actor was starting out some six decades ago. “Somebody, without even asking, tried to get me into one of those seven-year contracts where they control everything you do. They made the deal with my agent without consulting me, and acted as though I had to fulfill the contract. They were suing me not only to fulfill the contract but to take a cut of the amount of money that I was going to get for fulfilling the contract. They were really being bastards.” (Alda said the judge ruled in his favor.)\n\nAlda puts his legal experience to use in Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach’s relationship drama chronicling the slow, painful breakup of Adam Driver’s and Scarlett Johansson’s husband and wife. The film contains a holy trinity of divorce attorneys capitalizing on the characters’ heartbreak, played by Alda, Laura Dern, and Ray Liotta. And Alda’s lawyer Bert Spitz is the sweetest, most bumbling of the bunch—whose frank conversations with Driver’s character drew laugh-out-loud moments at a Toronto International Film Festival screening earlier this year. Neither Alda nor Bert seem cut out for cutthroat courtroom drama. But Alda has had fun disproving this in real life.\n\n“In the beginning I think people thought, Well, he’s not going to complain. He seems like a nice guy. But that’s one of the reasons I’ve always felt that it was fun to have a good lawsuit. People are not entitled to think of you as a pushover just because you’re courteous…. It’s fun to stand up for yourself.”\n\nMarriage Story may have given him a chance to leap back into the legal arena, but in Baumbach’s script, Alda also found a topic about which he is deeply passionate: the importance of communication. In 2009, the actor founded the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University in New York, and hosts a podcast Clear+Vivid in which he engages a wide range of guests in spirited discussions about how to communicate better. (All of the ad revenue from Clear+Vivid goes to the Alda Center.)\n\n“The thing that I love about the movie is that it shows that people fall in love, they get married. They have to learn to communicate to keep the marriage going,” Alda explained. “When that communication breaks down and they get a divorce, they suddenly find they had to communicate even better and more than they did when they were married or the divorce is going to be a disaster. Children will suffer, they’ll suffer. The odd thing is—you get a divorce because you’re not communicating well and then you better communicate even better [to navigate a divorce]. And I think the movie illustrates that.”\n\nAlda said he first realized the power of communication while working on M*A*S*H*. Alda was eager to develop a connection with his costars so deep that, when cameras turned on, the actors would be able to emulate the relational depth and intensity of a war-time medical unit. Speaking about his *M*A*S*H* costars, Alda said, “We realized we all came from different backgrounds and we all needed to become a union…We spent a lot of time sitting around talking, trying to become an ensemble. We consciously did that. And we would spend our time between shots laughing together, making fun of one another, and just being together. And that carried over into the scenes where we kept that relationship, the channel open. But now we were using the dialogue. And I realized, every time after that when I did a play, I would see if I could get the other actors to get together before the play—not just to talk about the play or scenes, but to have fun together. It made every performance better.”\n\nAlda has loved expanding his professional horizon with his podcast, where he’s interviewed everyone from Julie Andrews and Tom Hanks to an FBI hostage negotiator who shared a professional technique which can also prove helpful navigating marital conflicts. “He said interesting things like he never argues…he uses empathy to let them know that he understands what their complaint is. He doesn’t agree with him but he doesn’t argue with them. He just lets them know he’s heard them.” Another technique the negotiator shared was essentially a common improvisation technique, but spinning it to build empathy.\n\nAt age 83, Alda knows better than to just heap communication advice in strangers’ directions. Instead, he relies on his podcast—full of conversations and examples of communication breakthroughs—and movies with relevant story lines, like Marriage Story, to connect with audiences.\n\n“There’s very little you can say to people that changes their lives and changes their behavior,” Alda said. “Tips, maxims, tend to go in one ear and out the other. For instance, you could say it all boils down to listening, really listening. But unless somebody goes through an experience where they learn how to listen better and get the pleasure of listening better, it’s not really going to happen.” And already, since launching Clear+Vivid, he’s noticed a meaningful difference in the discourse strangers offer him on the street. “People stop me sometimes and tell me what they’re gaining from [the podcast]. They’re communicating better with people around them. That makes me feel great.”\n\noh, hello\n\nAlan Alda Just Wants to Have a Good Conversation\n\nThe SAG life-achievement-award recipient for 2019 spoke to Vanity Fair about M*A*S*H, his legacy, and Louis C.K.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nMovies\n\nWhen You’re 23 and Spielberg Calls: The Wild Origin Story of Jon M.
