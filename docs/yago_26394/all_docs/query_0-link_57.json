        "text": "Tina Fey is set to star in a series adaptation of the film “The Four Seasons” at Netflix, Variety has confirmed.\n\nThe film was released in 1981. It was directed by and starred Alan Alda with Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, Sandy Dennis, and Len Cariou also among the cast members.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n'Soul Mate' Gay Romance Between Korean and Japanese Men, Set at Netflix\n\nRicky Gervais' Next Tour and Netflix Special Is 'Mortality': 'We're All Gonna Die, May As Well Have a Laugh About It'\n\nNetflix Renews 'Perfect Match' for Season 3\n\nIn addition to starring, Fey co-created the series along with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. All three previously worked together on the beloved NBC sitcom “30 Rock.” All three also executive produce along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman, whose father produced the film, will also produce the series. Universal Television, where Fey and her Little Stranger, Inc. banner are set up under an overall deal, will produce.\n\nThe series has received an eight-episode order at Netflix. It will begin production later this year. In the film, three married couples take vacations together each season, but things are thrown for a loop when one of the husbands leaves his wife and begins bringing a younger woman with him. It was previously adapted into a 1984 TV series for CBS.\n\n“The Four Seasons” will mark Fey’s first television starring role since her days on “30 Rock.” She is no stranger to working with Netflix, however, as she co-created the series “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” for the streamer. She also executive produced and lent her voice to the Netflix animated series “Mulligan.” Netflix is also set to air the third season of “Girls5Eva,” another comedy series that Fey executive produces.\n\nFey is also known for her time at “Saturday Night Live,” on which she worked as head writer and a cast member. Fisher, meanwhile, co-created “Never Have I Ever,” which ran for four seasons on Netflix. Wigfield created the series “Great News” and the “Saved by the Bell” revival.\n\nDeadline first reported the series order.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in July 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in July 2024\n\nEmmy Predictions: Guest Acting - 'The Bear,' 'Hacks,' 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' 'SNL' and More Deliver 277 Contenders Across 4 Categories"
