        "text": "Vivaldi's The Four Seasons are not only among the most popular pieces of classical music today, but they circulated widely in the composer's time, as well, and inspired programmatic pieces by others. The concertos were especially popular in France, where they were played many times in the Concert Spirituel. Spring (La primavera), perhaps the particular favorite of the French, was not only often heard in its original form but was also arranged for larger forces (a choral motet by Michel Corette) and smaller (a version for flute alone by Jean-Jacques Rousseau).\n\nThen, along with the rest of Vivaldi's output, The Four Seasons fell out of the repertoire for over a century before being \"rediscovered\" in the first part of the twentieth century. The gradual revival of Vivaldi's music from that time was at first of interest to musicologists because of its influence on Bach, who had studied it and transcribed a number of the concertos for harpsichord. Although The Seasons were not among the concertos that Bach transcribed, they soon came to public attention as the Vivaldi revival continued. The first complete recording of them dates from 1942, but it was after the second World War that they achieved the broad popularity that they enjoy today.\n\nThe Seasons were first published in Amsterdam in 1725 as the first four of a set of twelve concertos by Vivaldi with the overall title Il cimento dell' armonia e dell' inventione (The contest between harmony and invention), opus 8. They are dedicated to Count Morzin of Bohemia, and from that dedication we learn that these were not new works but that they had found favor with the count some years earlier. No autograph manuscript has survived, but, in addition to the Amsterdam edition, there is a valuable manuscript set of instrumental parts for all four concertos. Originating in Italy during Vivaldi's lifetime and now housed in Manchester, England, that manuscript copy is both unusually accurate and a source for interesting variants in the text.\n\nOrnaments\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in performing such a well known and frequently recorded work as The Four Seasons -- and particularly a work that has so much colorful characterization in it -- is to interpret it in a way that is honest and personal, without sounding arbitrary or self-consciously \"different.\" One feature has perhaps been \"different\" in Boston Baroque’s performances and recording, though, is the attitude toward ornamentation in the slow movements.\n\nVivaldi's solo lines in the slow movements are generally extremely simple. Yet we know from Bach's transcriptions of works by Vivaldi and other Italian composers, from surviving ornamented versions of slow movements by Corelli and others, and even from descriptions of Vivaldi's own playing that it was common -- even expected -- to hear ornamentation in this kind of music. Today, with the revival of Baroque performance practices, we often hear ornamentation in Baroque slow movements, but oddly, the slow movements of The Seasons are most often played either with no ornamentation at all or with just a few added notes. It is hard to say why this is so. It may be that the iconic status of these works, in which each note is so well known, has made altering the lines with ornaments feel faintly sacrilegious, or that familiarity has made them feel satisfying without ornamentation. But these are the types of pieces which, in the hands of Corelli, Bach, Geminiani and others, are often considerably ornamented. When played with rhythmic flexibility, a few faster ornamental notes can fit easily into the relaxed pulse of these slow movements. Only the second movement of Autumn remains unornamented, since it has no melodic line and depicts a stillness, with the score calling only for harpsichord arpeggios.\n\nThe sonnets\n\nThe original publication of The Seasons provided sonnets -- quite possibly by Vivaldi himself -- that give detailed programs for each of the four concertos. Capital letters are placed next to lines in the sonnets, as well as in the score, to show us exactly where the effects mentioned in the poems are taking place in the music. In addition, captions over parts of the music -- sometimes over individual instrumental lines -- indicate pictorial effects even beyond those in the sonnets. No other concertos by Vivaldi contain such detailed programs. The sonnets printed below indicate with Roman numerals where the program for each of the three movements of a concerto begins."
