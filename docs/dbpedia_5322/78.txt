Pompano Beach – Students at Blanche Ely High School celebrated Black History Month by creating a special “wax museum” in the school’s small gymnasium.

In addition to creating presentations and displays of prominent African Americans from U.S. history, the students studied their lives and then became a characterization of that individual.

There wasn’t any wax involved, but the students dressed and acted the part. About 160 students participated.

Audrey Rozier played Whitney Houston.

“I feel good to be able to educate people on African American culture. I like playing her role.”

Italia Lewis played Oprah Winfrey.

“I enjoy learning about black history. I liked learning about Oprah Winfrey.”

Cindy Firman played the role of Rosa Parks. “I learned that she would not give up her seat to a white man. I was glad to learn about what she did.”

Nyla Lormeus played Esther Rolle, the famous “Good Times” actress who graduated from Ely. “I was able to learn about Rolle and her career as an actor.”

Connie McGirt led the event. She teaches African American History and U.S. History at Ely.

“I want the students to learn about African American history. It is important that they know about the important role they played in history.”
