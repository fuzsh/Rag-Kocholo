        "text": "Forrest P. \"Bud\" Hale Jr. passed away peacefully on Feb 2, 2022, in Pompano Beach, FL at age 95. Forrest was a dedicated husband and family man who was well known in the Pompano community through his more than four decades of teaching high school mathematics. Forrest and wife Priscilla moved from Massachusetts to Pompano Beach in 1952 where he began teaching at Pompano Beach Junior High, then Pompano Beach High, and finally Northeast High where he retired in 1996. Forrest taught higher math for more than 40 years and was one of the first baseball coaches at Pompano Beach High. He was well regarded as a top notch educator and mentor to his students and athletes. Forrest was head of the math department and was honored as PBHS Teacher of the Year on several occasions. He leaves a lasting legacy in the thousands of students he taught and was always proud to hear their many success stories through the years. His students always remember his quirky classroom sayings, \"now let's just be silly for a minute\", while helping them understand concepts of math. Forrest was an avid sports enthusiast and life-long Boston Red Sox fan. He was also \"Mr. Fix-It\", the family's go-to guy to fix or repair just about anything he put his hands on. But his unwavering dedication to family will always be remembered, especially as the sole caretaker of his wife Priscilla for several years after she suffered a major debilitating stroke. Forrest was born on May 13, 1926 in Palmer, Mass to parents Forrest Sr. and Clara Hale, and he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corp during WW II in Eastern Europe. Upon discharge, he attended Springfield College as a standout athlete and was captain of the baseball, soccer and basketball teams, obtaining his BA in mathematics. It was here that he met the love of his life, Priscilla, marrying in 1948, and going on to NYU to obtain a Master's Degree. Forrest is survived by his four children: Holly (Pat) Turner, Carol (Gene) Pridemore, Kent (Patrice) Hale and John (Donna) Hale, nine grandchildren: Mason, Chelsea, Jennifer, Andrew, Daniel, Lora, Kyle, Nicholas and Kenneth, and four great grandchildren: Landon, Quinn, Kayla and Lila. Arrangements are being handled by the Neptune Society and Forrest will be remembered at a private family service. Condolences can be posted at neptunesociety.com. Mourners are asked to send any donations to: Forrest Hale Memorial Scholarship Fund, Mu Alpha Theta Math Club, Pompano Beach High School, 600 NE 13th Ave, Pompano Beach, FL 33060.\n\nFor the many impressive and notable women who have transitioned from this fair city to the other side of glory, the name, Hazel Armbrister will be added to the list. Again, We speak her name ...as she was a quiet but discerning woman who wore many hats, titles, and recognitions that spoke to the heart and conscience of others. She was well known and her name holds great influence in many organizations and places throughout the local areas and as well as the state of Florida; Hazel touched the lives of many from all corners. Hazel lived her legacy and proved that her life served a purpose and her living was not in vain. Although she lived in Pompano for many years, she moved to Broward county in the 50’s, from her birth site, Perry, Florida in hopes of finding a job. Hazel was the caring and loving little big sister who took over the role of ‘mother hen’ to help her mother with the younger siblings. All throughout her life, Hazel had to constantly battle many challenges. It was her inner strength and strong faith that carried her through as she took each to task. Hazel was baptized as a child in Perry and raised in the Triumph Church and Methodist A.M.E. under the watchful eyes of her parents and family. She was a devout Christian and active church member throughout her life. As a young adult, she later joined the Episcopal Church. She was determined to make a successful path on her life’s journey. In doing so, she met the love of her life and soulmate, David “Sparky” Armbrister and together they built a home to support a family. She was the first African American in Broward County to receive her GED in 1953 and later trained as a Teacher’s Aide in 1966. Still on her path to success, she worked and earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Education from USF in 1974. While working in various jobs and raising a family, she later returned to the university and earned her Master’s degree in 1975. Hazel was a courageous trailblazer who was not afraid of a challenge; thus it was her destiny to make big paths in untraveled territory. All throughout her adult life, Hazel’s grace, faith and love were bountiful and equally shared among her family, friends and everyone who met her. She understood her purpose and knew that she was chosen to play the lead role as a critical fulfillment to her Destiny; mediocrity was not in her designed path. As life’s challenges would have it, Hazel proved her worth. Her paths took her from the bean fields to the classroom and she did not allow anything to hinder her determined path. Her self-assigned journey was for the good of restoring history and dignity in the Black community. Hazel was a formidable foe against naysayers and a kind but determined “ humble hellion” for a cause ....We speak her name.\n\nHer strength, confidence and intellect were God’s graces that she shared in all of her destined roles in life: First and foremost, over 27 years, she and David “Sparky” worked as a family unit on a mission until his untimely death; she was a devoted and loving mother of two daughters and a son and several adopted children; Her love and memories for all were unparalleled; she was a dedicated and faithful lector at St. Nicholas Episcopal Church; her impressive professional life was initiated as she was the first African American teacher’s aide in Broward County and moved on to become a remarkably dedicated teacher who taught school for over 33 years. As We speak her name, Hazel, we must recognize her savvy leadership and teaching skills that extended far beyond the classroom: she was a teacher of life; Many will remember her not only as a focused trailblazer but more so a staunch community leader/activist and political aspirant; she was former chair and vice chair of the Broward Democratic Club. Hazel was well known and respected for her parliamentary procedures in the local and state political arena; Many believed she helped write the Robert’s Rules of Order. Hazel loved her community and worked hard to help upgrade and maintain its integrity. She was not only actively involved in many social, religious and civic organization but in many she held important positions: Pompano Beach Historian, President and a founding member of her beloved Rock Road Restoration Historical Group, First African American member and president of the Pompano Beach Women’s Club, former Chair of Broward County Historic Preservation and dedicated member and former chair of Elly Lodder Daughters of the King Chapter. When We speak her name, we can be assured that if there is an issue/mission, she, Hazel Armbrister, was actively involved as a champion for the cause. Hazel worked and showed up for the people who loved her thus the severed line to family, friends and the community will leave a prominent gap in the hearts and lives of many. She did her life right, she fulfilled her mission and left no dashes or stones unturned. As We speak her name, Hazel Armbrister, and reflect on the many impressionable memories and unchallenged extensions of her love and con- cern, we can proudly speak her name, Hazel Armbrister. Hazel made her humble transition to her final destination: a place of serenity and comfort . She followed her journey and carved the trail that was destined solely for her legacy. Her extensive family and friends, and the community of Pompano have lost an important and significant lifeline and her quiet demeanor, unconditional love and confident personality can never be replaced but always revered.\n\nMargaret Becket Green, 90 passed away peacefully March 24 in Pompano Beach, FL a victim of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, with loving family members present.

Cooking was her passion and she served it up for family meals, potluck dinners, holiday spreads, and for many grieving families at First Baptist Church of Pompano where she was a member, and for longtime friends in her Old Pompano neighborhood. There was always a pot of something on the stove simmering in her kitchen. Not only was her home the gathering place for family, but she welcomed everyone with open arms for holidays and celebrations. Mom loved to laugh, it was unmistakable and contagious. You were always met with her beautiful smile and a \"Hi Shug.\" Her many southernisms will be lovingly remembered and repeated by her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. She loved to tell the story about a time when someone said to her \"You can't be from Florida with that southern accent.\" Her reply was \"How much further south can you get?\" It was always followed by her contagious laughter. She was proud of her roots and loved her country. She always made sure the American flag was waving on the flagpole in the front yard so she could see it from her rocking chair on the porch. She is loved by all who knew her, and will be remembered for her strength that could move mountains, her reassuring voice that made us feel safe, her big generous heart, her deep unconditional love for her family, the twinkle in her eye, and her beautiful smile and laughter that will be so terribly missed.

She was born 10 October 1929 in Terre Haute, Indiana and is a twelfth generation American whose family on both sides had their beginnings in 1607 and 1610 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. On her mother’s side of the family, she was a direct descendent of Thomas Savage who came to Virginia in the first supply with Capt. Christopher Newport, who arrived at Jamestowne 8 January 1607/8 on the ‘John and Francis’. Henrietta was a fifth generation Floridian and on the 9th of November 2012, the Florida State Genealogical Society granted her a ‘Florida Pioneer Descendant State Certificate’. Her great great grandmother, Ester Lane Dennis Savage, came to Florida about 1830 and settled in Tallahassee where she met and married 1st. Dr. Lewis Willis from Virginia on 30 January 1834. He died 3 October 1835 in Pensacola, Florida. She married 2nd my great great grandfather David Porter Hogue on 13 June 1838 who later served as Attorney General of Florida from 1848-1853 (under Governor Brown). He was born in Pennsylvania, but in early life moved to Maryland and soon afterwards to Virginia. He came to Florida in 1838 and settled in Tallahassee where he filled the positions of member of the Legislature, delegate to the Convention of ’65, and Mayor of this city. Henrietta’s great grandfather, Henry Bernreuter, served on the side of the Confederacy for the State of Florida and was appointed Sheriff of Leon County in 1877 by Gov. George Drew, Democrat. Her mother met her father in Tampa, Florida where she lived and they were married in the Episcopal Church of the Ascension, Clearwater, Florida on 31 July 1926 and lived in Terre Haute, Indiana. In the spring of 1932, Henrietta’s parents separated and her Mother returned to Tampa, Florida with her older sister, Meredith, and herself where they lived until 1939 with my grandmother, Aurie Benjamin, on property that is now MacDill Field. The home in which they lived became the Officers Club. It was the only structure left standing on that property. The family moved to Clearwater Beach where Henrietta’s mother met and married; 2nd, Josiah Noyes Bacon, Jr. Her father died 1 November 1934 and is buried in the family mausoleum at Highland Lawn Cemetery, Terre Haute, Indiana."
