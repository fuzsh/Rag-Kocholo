        "text": "By Judy Wilson | Associate Editor\n\nPompano Beach – After years of being regarded as a person with an admirable knowledge of local history, Dan Hobby has officially become this city’s historian.\n\nThe former administrator of historical societies and sites since 1979, Hobby was given the “largely honorary title” back in June after the death of Hazel Armbrister. It comes with no pay and no stated responsibilities. But it gets Hobby, who retired from paid positions in 2017, back on his game.\n\nBefore he became official, he was assisting city administrators with an historical conundrum: the status of the Rolle House on Northwest 3 Avenue, a 900-square foot home built in the 1940s by stage and TV actress Esther Rolle, best remembered for her role in Maude and “Good Times.” A graduate of Blanche Ely High School, she is buried at Westview Cemetery.\n\nNow owned by others, the house has become a “cause celebre,” according to Hobby.\n\nAn ad hoc group wants to buy it as a tribute to the family. But it has been altered from its original design and is now a duplex. So that, Hobby said, is a problem. And then there is a continuing concern: Should the city take on the expense – maintenance, staffing, etc.?\n\n“There is the problem of what to do with it,” Hobby said. “History is replete with saved buildings which now are in disrepair.”\n\nRolle never lived in the home that bears her surname, residing instead with a sister in a home near the Larkins Center which is no longer standing.\n\nHobby is this city’ third person to hold the title of official historian. The late Bud Garner, who died in 2016 and whose personal memories of Pompano Beach went back for most of his 89 years, held the post for many years. Armbrister, renowned in the black community for her efforts to preserve historic sites there, succeeded him and died last March.\n\nNow it’s Hobby’s turn to advise city officials on the efficacy of historic issues and sites. “It appears to be a lifetime appointment,” he says wryly.\n\nReaders of local history will recognize his name as an author. He has written seven books about the area including: “Pompano Beach: A History of Pioneers and Progress,” “Lighthouse Point: The First Fifty Years” and “Broward County: A Contemporary Portrait.”\n\nA 1973 graduate of the University of Florida with a masters in history, he directed the Pompano Beach Historical Society for 14 years. It is an organization that remains dear to him. From 2000 to 2017 he oversaw operations at the Sample McDougald House including its historic move from Dixie Highway to the city’s Centennial Park. He remains on that executive board.\n\nPrior to that he headed up the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society for 20 years and has served on numerous boards involved in historic preservations and places.\n\nAnd beginning again in November, he will once again host the city’s historic tours, a two-hour trolley ride to 50 areas of interest.\n\nHobby suggests the city needs an aggressive agenda of identifying sites that might be suitable for historic designations. Among the most successful are the Ali Building, BaCA in the old Bailey Hotel and the two Kester Cottages at Founders Park, built by William Kester in the late ‘30s to kickstart tourism in this farming community.\n\nAt one time, on A1A, there were 120-150 of these small, affordable dwellings, built of Dade County Pine, lumber that withstands hurricanes.\n\nHistory does “have an effect on our lives,” Hobby said.\n\nFor some, he said, it’s merely entertainment; for others, it supplies insight . . . but for everyone, it is a “moving target. Just like with this virus, we keep learning new things. Fifty years from now, we will be writing histories that see things differently. And we are always bound by our own perspectives.”\n\nHe adds, “I feel I can provide useful information for decision making. A reasonable role for a city historian.”"
