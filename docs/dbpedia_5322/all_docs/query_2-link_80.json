        "text": "The highest compliment you can give an author is to hand a book to a friend and say: “Read this.”\n\nYour friend will say, “What is it?”\n\nAnd you say, “Shut up and read it.”\n\nSince discovering novelist Jon Hassler, I’ve had that conversation — or variations thereof — with\n\nfriends dozens of times. I still remember coming across a new paperback copy of Hassler’s novel,\n\nStaggerford, on the “local authors” table at a bookstore in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport while\n\nheading home from covering the World Series. (I remember the incident vividly, but don’t know if\n\nit was 1987 or 1991.) At the time, I had no idea who Hassler was, but the book looked interesting to\n\nme, as did the “blurb” on the cover from a Los Angeles Times review that proclaimed Hassler an\n\nauthor “good enough to restore your faith in fiction.”\n\nStaggerford was published as a hardback in 1978 and had disappointing sales, even after being the\n\nrare first novel to get a New York Times review — and from Joyce Carol Oates, no less, who did the\n\npublic a great disservice with her lukewarm review that delayed Hassler’s acceptance as a great novelist.\n\nBelieve me, I understand how a soundbite quote from one lukewarm review, the one exception among\n\notherwise rave reviews from journalists, fellow writers and the general public, can haunt an author.\n\nI devoured Staggerford and loved it for its subtlety, sardonic humor and human touch. I’ve given away\n\nperhaps 20 copies of Staggerford, whether a rare copy of the hardback or paperback copies I’ve bought\n\nat St. Vincent de Paul for 25 cents. I’ve recommended it to many others. I’ve hooked family and friends\n\non Hassler. Since buying that first copy of Staggerford, I first filled in my collection of his works up to that\n\ntime, and then bought every one of his later books when they came out.\n\nStaggerford became such a cult favorite, Hassler in 1999 published his journal from the time as,\n\nMy Staggerford Journal. It is a must read for every would-be or new author. The end of the book,\n\nwhere he finds remainder copies of the hardback at a store for something like $1 apiece, gathers them\n\nup and then attempts to write a check to pay for them, brings a smile. (With his name and picture on\n\nthe book jacket, he was asked to show ID.) The hardback now is very valuable.\n\nYears before any of my books were published, I wrote him a fan letter. I was astounded when I\n\ngot a note back, and he said he was familiar with my work in The Sporting News, where I was\n\nworking at the time. He even mentioned a story I had written. He might have done some quick\n\nresearch and was just being nice, but I still was flattered. We stayed in touch, not frequently, but\n\nintermittently and casually as he split time between Minnesota and Florida, and he even tried to\n\nget his publisher and editor to consider publishing my novel, The Witch’s Season, which I had started\n\nin high school. The novel remained unpublished for many years for a lot of reasons, some of them\n\ncomplicated, although it drew initial movie interest when the manuscript was being passed around.\n\nThe screenplay version I was commissioned to write still is floating around, along with two others\n\nI've done. Boy, do I have stories…\n\nI attended a Hassler appearance at the Tattered Cover in 1995 (for Rookery Blues) and and we had a\n\nnice talk. During the question-and-answer session, I had the nerve to ask what anyone who has read\n\nStaggerford wants to know: Why did he end it the way he did? I figured anyone at the Rookery Blues\n\nsigning had read Staggerford. (One sportswriter friend I had given Staggerford called me at 2 in the\n\nmorning, screaming that the powerful ending had blindsided her. I knew the feeling.)\n\nHassler sent me the above postcard in 1995 shortly after his TC signing. Eventually, of course, I turned to\n\nnon-fiction — and got published. And I was able to branch out into fiction with, yes, The Witch's\n\nSeason (2009) and what I consider my best book, Olympic Affair (2012). Each time I've done signings\n\nand presentations at the Tattered Cover -- I'm up to seven now -- I’ve always thought of Hassler. I still have the\n\nnote he sent me congratulating me on the publication of Horns, Hogs, and Nixon Coming, released by Simon\n\nand Schuster in 2002. He was ill by then and couldn’t write longhand.\n\nI keep reading (and re-reading) Hassler’s books. I’m probably up to 10 times for Staggerford. I\n\nfilled out a hardback collection. I’ve come to decide that Simon’s Night, his second book, is at\n\nleast on a par with Staggerford. (It takes a mature outlook to truly appreciate it.) I loved the original\n\nStaggerford trilogy, which also included A Green Journey and Dear James. He still had his fastball\n\nthrough many years and I was among those marveling at how his books, with his trademark sense\n\nof humanity and sardonic humor, got better with each re-reading. I also can make cases for Grand Opening\n\nor North of Hope as his best novel.\n\nWhenever I visit a bookstore, whether a chain or an independent, I check the fiction section to see if\n\nit has a copy of Staggerford, either the mass market paperback or trade paperback. Not all good stores\n\nalways have it; but all stores that have it are good stores. Unfortunately, more stores now\n\nstock his later Staggerford sequels, The Staggerford Flood, The Staggerford Murders and\n\n(the best of the three) The New Woman. There’s nothing wrong with them, but the earlier\n\nbooks are far better vehicles for being introduced to Hassler and provide context and\n\nbackground for the final sequels. Or, sadly, many of the surviving brick and mortar\n\nbookstores don't stock Hassler books at all.\n\nStart with Staggerford.\n\nRead it.\n\nYou’ll thank me.\n\nThanks, Mr. Hassler.\n\nHassler died in 2008, and the news left me shaken. I'm sad I was never able to send him\n\na signed copy of The Witch's Season ... or Olympic Affair. Here’s the obituary.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Author Jon Hassler, who chronicled the foibles of small-town life in\n\n“Staggerford,” “Grand Opening” and other novels after starting his career late in life, has\n\ndied. He was 74.\n\nHassler, who suffered from a longtime neurological disorder, died early Thursday at Methodist\n\nHospital in St. Louis Park, said family friend Nick Hayes. Hassler had been in home hospice\n\ncare since the holidays and entered the hospital on Monday, Hayes said.\n\nDespite his deteriorating health, Hassler continued work on a book, “Jay O’Malley,”\n\nuntil his death, Hayes said.\n\nIn a 1995 interview, Hassler told The Associated Press that he liked writing about\n\nmisfits. “You can’t write a novel about somebody who’s perfectly happy,” he said.\n\nHassler was born in Minneapolis in March 30, 1933, and grew up in the small\n\nnorth-central Minnesota town of Staples, where his father owned a grocery store.\n\nHe graduated from St. John’s University in Collegeville in 1955 before receiving a\n\nmaster’s from the University of North Dakota. He spent years teaching before launching\n\nhis writing career at 37. He didn’t publish his first novel, “Staggerford,” a semi-autobiographical\n\nstory about a high school teacher in a small town, until seven years later. Hassler’s other\n\nworks include “Simon’s Night,” 1979; “The Love Hunter,” 1981; “A Green Journey,” 1986;\n\n“Grand Opening,” 1987; “North of Hope,” 1990; and “Dear James,” 1993.\n\nTerry Kay and other favories\n\nAll writers have a \"favorites\" bookshelf or two. Mine are here in my den.\n\nOther books -- very good books, books I love -- are in other shelves, or\n\nstorage bins, or boxes. These are the fiction authors whose books I love\n\nand re-read. In addition to the works of the writers above, the authors\n\non my \"favorites\" shelves include:\n\n-- Terry Kay. Among them, To Dance With the White Dog, Shadow Song,\n\nTaking Lottie Home, The Book of Marie and the non-fiction essays of\n\nSpecial Kay. A former newspaper sportswriter and theater critic, he also\n\nhas written the wonderful screenplay adaptation of White Dog, and the\n\nfilm starred Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and Esther Rolle. I've been an\n\nadmirer of his thoughtful fiction for many, many years.\n\nI met him when we both appeared at the Arkansas Literary Festival in 2004.\n\nI most recently caught up with his list and read his terrific The Book of Marie,\n\nwhich while not a sequel is an outgrowth of his earlier book, The Runaway. I found\n\nmyself going right back through it a second time to check for what I \"missed\"\n\nand to have the perspective of knowing how it turned out without having\n\ncheated. It especially resonated with me because its characters, major and\n\nminor, often reminded me of folks in my past. And for those of you who\n\nhave read it: I'm convinced Marie knew that was Cole at The Fantasticks.\n\nTerry wrote a cover blurb for my novel, Olympic Affair, and I'm proud that his\n\npraise is prominent on the back cover of the book itself, on my web site and in\n\nlistings.\n\nHe passed away in 2020. He lived in Athens, Georgia, and I regret that I didn't\n\nget to visit him and get to know him better.\n\n-- Pat Conroy. (My favorite always will be The Great Santini.)\n\n-- Garrison Keillor.\n\n-- Mark Harris. (The \"Author\" Wiggen baseball novels.)\n\n-- Damon Runyon.\n\n-- Herman Wouk (the World War II novels).\n\n-- Joseph Heller. (My father, the WWII pilot subjected to raised number of missions\n\nor combat flight hours necessary to complete a tour of duty, annually read Catch-22.\n\nI'm up to about five times.)\n\n-- Richard Russo.\n\n-- Roy MacGregor, for The Last Season, the greatest hockey novel of all time."
