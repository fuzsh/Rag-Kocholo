Unfortunately, Rochelle's teaching style doesn't do the trick, so Chris is forced to secretly meet with Rochelle's mother, Maxine (Loretta Devine), a former algebra teacher. Meanwhile, when Drew (Tequan Richmond) accidentally breaks Julius' (Terry Crews) favorite chair, Tonya (Imani Hakim) takes the fall for him, but it turns out the good deed comes with a hefty price tag attached.\n\nEnough Is Enough (No More Tears)\n\nWhen a family arrives at Seattle Grace Hospital after a serious car accident, Alex learns that their injuries are only the beginning of their problems.
