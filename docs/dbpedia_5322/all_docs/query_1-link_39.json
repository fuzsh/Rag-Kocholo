        "text": "The scintillating, sultry-eyed blonde (formerly a redhead) star of screen, TV and award-winning stage went on to become best known, however, for her sensual delivery pitching cigars in taunting '60s ads and commercials with her Mae Westian come-on line \"Why don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime?\" This, of course, was at a time when smoking was considered quite sexy and fashionable, and Edie Adams went above and beyond the call of duty in making these ads legendary.\n\nEdie had her hand dipped in all pools of entertainment. She was a singing siren, an award-winning Broadway musical entertainer, a deft impressionist and comedienne, a serious dramatic actress, a commercial saleswoman and a viable TV celebrity. Off-stage, she showed remarkable poise and resourcefulness when her famous first husband, landmark TV comic Ernie Kovacs, was tragically killed in a January 1962 car crash in Los Angeles and she found her family finances in dire straits.\n\nShe was born Edith Elizabeth Enke on April 16, 1927, in the relatively small town of Kingston, Pennsylvania, but moved while fairly young to Grove City. Her family relocated again, this time to Tenafly, New Jersey, where she grew up. Following her graduation from high school, Edie aspired to become an opera singer and studied voice and piano at New York's Juilliard School of Music. She then went on to take acting classes at the Columbia School of Drama.\n\nHer theatrical debut occurred with a 1947 production of \"Blithe Spirit\", and a year later she appeared in the stage show \"Goodnight Ladies\". Gradually building up her singing reputation via the nightclub circuit, her big break came when Arthur Godfrey booked her on his \"Talent Scouts\" show. She didn't come out the winner, but a TV director who caught sight of her performance envisioned in her a seductive \"straight man\" who could mesh well with a certain zany comedian. In 1951, Edie (then known as Edith Adams) was signed up as a featured singer on Ernie Kovacs's comedy show that originated in Philadelphia. The show, live and unrehearsed, became an innovative, groundbreaking effort in the relatively new medium. Outrageous and even incomprehensible at times, his comedy was deemed way ahead of its time and, as a result, had problems reaching mainstream audiences who didn't \"get it\", and the programs were short-lived. Various Kovacs platforms that included Edie were Ernie in Kovacsland (1951), \"Kovacs on the Korner\" (1952), and, of course, The Ernie Kovacs Show (1952). She and Kovacs eloped to Mexico City in 1954 and their union produced a daughter, Mia Kovacs. The duo were a popular couple in the Hollywood social circuit (moving there from New York in the late '50s) and the connections she developed out there were quite valuable in furthering her career.\n\nEarly '50s TV opened many doors for Edie and she waltzed right through them. Her New York stage debut in the popular musical \"Wonderful Town\" in 1952 had her walking away with the Theatre World Award for \"Best Newcomer\". A few years later, she slithered away with a supporting Tony Award for her bodacious take on the \"Daisy Mae\" character in the musical \"Li'l Abner\" (1956). Following that were more musical and dramatic ventures on the stage, including \"The Merry Widow\" (1957) (a show she would return to more than once), \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1960) and \"Free as a Bird\" (1960). On film, Edie showed the public that she wasn't just a pretty face with her sharply unsympathetic supporting performance in Billy Wilder's Das Appartement (1960) and a funny, sexier one in the second of Rock Hudson and Doris Day's three battle-of-the-sexes romps, Ein Pyjama für zwei (1961). Surprisingly, Edie and Ernie never appeared together in a film. Edie remained primarily a TV fixture and, outside of her Emmy-nominated coupling with Kovacs, winningly played the Fairy Godmother in Julie Andrews' popular TV version of Cinderella (1957), appeared regularly with Jack Paar and Dinah Shore on their respective variety shows, acted on various prime-time shows, and graced a number of celebrity game and talk show panels.\n\nOne of Edie's last pairings with Kovacs was in 1960 when they appeared as guests on the very last episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (1957). The pair appeared as themselves, with one of the highlights being Edie crooning the lovely ballad \"That's All\". Kovacs' sudden 1962 death was a terrible reversal of fortunes for Edie. An inveterate gambler, he left her owing much money to the IRS. Instead of filing bankruptcy, however, she worked her way out of debt. In the process, her career received a second wind. Perhaps it didn't hurt that the public adored Edie and that she was a genuinely sympathetic figure in the wake of her private tragedy.\n\nShe returned to the nightclub circuit from whence she came, recorded albums, and also toured the country in various dramatic and musical comedy vehicles, including \"Rain\" (as Sadie Thompson), \"Bells Are Ringing\", \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as Annie Oakley), \"I Do! I Do!\", \"Anything Goes\" and \"Bus Stop\". She also received outstanding notices in a few of her films, whether dramas (Verliebt in einen Fremden (1963), Der Kandidat (1964)) or frivolous comedies (Bob auf Safari (1963), Eine total, total verrückte Welt (1963), Ein Ehebett zur Probe (1963), Venedig sehen - und erben... (1967)). Moreover, she was handed her own musical variety show Here's Edie (1963) (aka \"The Edie Adams Show\") and received a couple of Emmy nominations for her efforts. She also took advantage of her famous impressions of Zsa Zsa Gabor and others, appearing in various TV comedy formats.\n\nMore than anything, however, it was her come-hither temptress pitching Muriel cigars that had TV audiences' tongues wagging. It was a smashingly successful and highly profitable coup for Edie professionally. Her late husband, a notorious cigar smoker, at one time sold Dutch Master cigars on TV. The idea then for Edie to pitch a competing slimmer cigar on TV was only natural. She had much to do with the direction of the commercials, which ran throughout the 1960s, providing them with a perfect blend of class, glamour and sensuality.\n\nWhile growing noticeably heavier in later years, she never lost her trademark humor and sex appeal. Edie could still be seen from time to time on the stage in such shows as \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", the female version of \"The Odd Couple\", \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Nunsense\". She remained committed to the end to restoring/preserving her late husband's videotapes and kinescopes of his ground-breaking '50s TV work. She also recalled her offbeat life with Kovacs in the book \"Sing a Pretty Song\", which was published in 1990.\n\nEdie got married again in 1964, to photographer Marty Mills, with whom she had a son, Josh Mills. That union ended in divorce in 1971. The following year, Edie married jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. She and Candoli, who died in January of 2008, divorced in 1989. In another eerie, tragic circumstance, daughter Mia Kovacs was killed in a 1982 Los Angeles auto accident at age 22 -- 20 years after her father's similar demise. Suffering from cancer and losing weight in her latter years, the beloved Edie died of complications from pneumonia at age 81 in Los Angeles.\n\nA native of New Jersey and son of a mechanic, African-American John Amos has relied on his imposing build, eruptive nature and strong, forceful looks to obtain acting jobs, and a serious desire for better roles to earn a satisfying place in the annals of film and TV. He has found it a constant uphill battle to further himself in an industry that tends to diminish an actor's talents with severe and/or demeaning stereotypes and easy pigeonholing. A tough, often hot-headed guy with a somewhat tender side, John would succeed far better on stage than on film and TV...with one extremely noteworthy exceptions.\n\nBorn on December 27, 1939, John was first employed as an advertising copywriter, a social worker at New York's Vera Institute of Justice, and an American and Canadian semi-professional football player before receiving his calling as an actor. A stand-up comic on the Greenwich Village circuit, the work eventually took him West and, ultimately, led to his hiring as a staff writer on Leslie Uggams' musical variety show in 1969. Making his legit stage debut in a 1971 L.A. production of the comedy \"Norman, Is That You?\", John went on to earn a Los Angeles Drama Critics nomination for \"Best Actor\". As such, he formed his own theater company and produced \"Norman, Is That You?\" on tour.\n\nThe following year he returned to New York to take his first Broadway bow in \"Tough To Get Help\". By this time he had secured secondary work on the classic Oh Mary (1970) as Gordy the weatherman. His character remained on the periphery, however, and he left the show after three discouraging seasons. On the bright side, he won the recurring role of the sporadically-unemployed husband of maid Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle) on Norman Lear's Maude (1972) starring Bea Arthur. The two characters were spun-off into their own popular series as the parental leads in Good Times (1974).\n\nGood Times (1974), a family sitcom that took place in a Chicago ghetto high-rise, initially prided itself as being the first network series ever to be created by African-Americans. But subsequent episodes were taken over by others and John was increasingly disgruntled by the lack of quality of the scripts and the direction Lear was taking the show. Once focused on the importance of family values, it was shifting more and more toward the silly antics of Jimmie 'JJ' Walker, who was becoming a runaway hit on the show as the aimless, egotistical, jive-talking teenage son JJ. John began frequently clashing with the higher-ups and, by 1976, was released from the series, with his character being killed in an off-camera car accident while finding employment out of state.\n\nAmos rebounded quickly when he won the Emmy-nominated role of the adult Kunte Kinte in the ground-breaking epic mini-series Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), one of the most powerful and reverential TV features ever to hit television. It was THE TV role of his career, but he found other quality roles for other black actors extremely difficult to come by. He tried his best to avoid the dim-headed lugs and crime-motivated characters that came his way. Along with a few parts (the mini-movie Willa (1979) and the films Beastmaster - Der Befreier (1982) and Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988)), he had to endure the mediocre (guest spots on Love Boat (1977), \"The A-Team\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" \"One Life to Live\"). John also toiled through a number of action-themed films that focused more on grit and testosterone than talent.\n\nHe found one answer to this acting dilemma on the proscenium stage. In 1985, the play \"Split Second\" earned him the NAACP Award as Best Actor. He also received fine reviews in a Berkshire Theater festival production of \"The Boys Next Door\", a tour of O'Neill's towering play \"The Emperor Jones\", and in a Detroit production of Athol Fugard's \"Master Harold...and The Boys\". In addition, John directed two well-received productions, \"Miss Reardon Drinks a Little\" and \"Twelve Angry Men\", in the Bahamas. He took on Shakespeare as Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\" at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare and earned strong notices in the late August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Fences\" at the Capital Repertory Company in Albany, New York. Overseas he received plaudits for his appearance in a heralded production of \"The Life and Death of a Buffalo Soldier\" at the Bristol's Old Vic in England. Capping his theatrical career was the 1990 inaugural of his one-man show \"Halley's Comet\", an amusing and humanistic American journey into the life of an 87-year-old who recalls, among other things, World War II, the golden age of radio, the early civil rights movement, and the sighting of the Comet when he was 11. He wrote and has frequently directed the show, which continues to play into the 2007-2008 season.\n\nIn recent years, John has enjoyed recurring parts on \"The West Wing\" and \"The District\", and is more recently appearing in the offbeat series Men in Trees (2006) starring Anne Heche. John Amos has two children by his former wife Noel Amos and two children. Son K.C. Amos director, writer, producer, editor and daughter Shannon Amos a director, writer and producer. Amos has one grand child,a grand-daughter, Quiera Williams.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Morey Amsterdam started in Vaudeville at the age of 14, as a straight man for his piano-playing brother. His father, a concert violinist who worked with the Chicago Opera and the San Francisco Symphony, wanted Morey to pursue a career in classical music however Morey had other plans. By the time he was 16, he was working at a Chicago speakeasy owned by Al Brown - better known as Al Capone. When he was caught in the middle of a shootout in the club one night, Amsterdam decided to seek safer bookings. He moved to California, where he became a writer and gag man for such stars as Fanny Brice, Jimmy Durante and Will Rogers. Morey would become known as the \"Human Joke Machine\" because he could tell a joke about any subject on request. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was on the radio, where his humor brought him fame and notoriety. He was also a songwriter, and some of his best known songs were \"Why Oh Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming?\" and \"Rum and Coca-Cola\". By 1947, he had three different daily radio shows and comedian Fred Allen said, \"The only thing I can turn on without getting Amsterdam is the faucet\". His first TV show began as a radio program and carried over onto TV, \"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\" (1948). That same year, he hosted his own variety show, The Morey Amsterdam Show (1948), which ran until 1950. Amsterdam was the host of the talk show Broadway Open House (1950), the precursor to NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" in its various forms. His real fame, though, would come after he had spent almost four decades in the business, playing the part of wisecracking comedy writer \"Buddy Sorrell\" in the classic Dick van Dyke Show (1961) along with Rose Marie and Van Dyke as writers for the fictional TV variety show \"The Alan Brady Show\". For Morey, who was reportedly able to recall up to 100,000 jokes, it was the role of a lifetime. After the show ended in 1966, he continued to play nightclub dates and make TV guest-star appearances on shows from The Hollywood Squares (Daytime) (1965) to Caroline in the City (1995). His film career consisted mainly of small roles in such films as Beach Party (1963) and Won Ton Ton - Der Hund, der Hollywood rettete (1976), although he did produce and star in Don't Worry, We'll Think of a Title (1966) and received good notices for his standout performance as a weaselly, double-crossing gangster who gets his just desserts in the Charles Bronson gangster film Revolver-Kelly (1958).\n\nA bodacious, bedimpled, pert-nosed, well-endowed knockout, Loni Anderson earned an assured television sex symbol pedestal during the late 1970s and early 1980s. As sexy but smart Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), the ravishing star later became a soap-styled fixture in mini-movies. All eyes were peeled on this worthy pin-up who helped to bring back the glossy platinum-blonde allure of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren.\n\nLoni strove for much more than a sex pedestal as she tried to parlay her newly found fame into a viable dramatic career. She met with a measured degree of success as she recreated the lives of such artificial sex sirens as Mansfield and Thelma Todd on television, but got bogged down in television-movie retellings of famous movie classics (Drei Münzen im Brunnen (1954), Du lebst noch 105 Minuten (1948), Todsünde (1945)) that could not help but pale in comparison. This attempt at seriousness was further hampered by messy tabloid headlines in her private life.\n\nLoni Kaye Anderson was born with very dark (jet black) hair on August 5, 1945 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of a chemist. An art student at the University of Minnesota, she entered (and won) beauty contests on the sly (including a Miss Minnesota runner-up placing in 1964). Married and divorced from Bruce Hasselberg before she reached age 21, Loni took on a teaching position to support herself and baby daughter (Deidre) while completing college.\n\nDeveloping an interest in acting, she went the route many aspiring thespians do -- apprenticing in local commercials and theater shows. Still dark-haired, she played in several early 1970s productions such as \"Born Yesterday\" (as Billie Dawn), \"Send Me No Flowers\", \"Can-Can\" and \"The Star-Spangled Girl\". She even played Tzeitel in \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and appeared in a production of \"The Threepenny Opera\".\n\nRemarried in 1973 to actor, Ross Bickell, the couple decided to move away from Minnesota to Los Angeles in 1975 and actively pursue film and television work. Pounding the proverbial pavement, she eventually went blonde and this, plus her gorgeous looks, helped her to secure minor but sexy roles on such series as Die knallharten Fünf (1975), Make-Up und Pistolen (1974), Barnaby Jones (1973), The Bob Newhart Show (1972) and Herzbube mit zwei Damen (1976). By the time she nabbed the role of Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), she had grown quite admirably as an actress.\n\nLoni and Howard Hesseman became the breakaway stars of the sitcom and Loni skyrocketed to sexy status, earning two Emmy nominations in the process. On the other hand, her instant fame led to the breakup of her second marriage to Bickell in 1981. Loni found hit-and-miss success outside the parameters of her comedy series. She was front-and-center in a number of television-movies, notably playing tragic Hollywood sex sirens Jayne Mansfield in Die Jayne Mansfield Story (1980), opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger as her muscle-bound husband Mickey Hargitay, and Thelma Todd, in White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd (1991), whose untimely death in 1935 is still questioned.\n\nLoni also appeared lusciously alongside Bob Hope, brightening up several of his classic television specials. On the minus side, she fizzled in her teaming up with equally sexy Wonder Woman (1975) star Lynda Carter in the tepid, short-lived series Caulfields Witwen (1984) and then played a former Las Vegas showgirl who inherits a bundle in the sitcom misfire Dieses süße Leben (1986). She also was given a chance to work in feature films such as Der rasende Gockel (1983). While her performance in that movie was panned, it did have her meeting and co-starring opposite mega star Burt Reynolds.\n\nAppearing in routine, mini-movie soap operas (via her own production company), if anything, kept Loni in the public eye as a serious-minded actress, but it was an uphill battle to rise above her manufactured image as a fantasy bombshell. Not helping things was her high-profile marriage to Reynolds in 1988, which began blissfully enough (and produced adopted son Quinton), then dissolved quickly into a nasty divorce in 1993 that damaged the reputations of both stars.\n\nIn later years, Loni showed incredible perseverance. As always, the stalwart beauty continued to play up the glam but has since downplayed the dramatics. She seems more focused these days on having innocuous fun, playing a number of hearty vixens in sitcoms and series guest spots. Over time, she has enjoyed such lightweight sitcoms as her regular role in Hallo Schwester! (1991), and as a guest in such sitcoms as The New WKRP in Cincinnati (1991) (in which she recreated her role as Jennifer Marlowe), Harry's Nest (1988), Sabrina - total verhext (1996) and Clueless: Die wichtigen dinge des lebens (1996). Her last movie was the SNT-based comedy movie A Night at the Roxbury (1998).\n\nMillennium television credits include the sitcom The Mullets (2003) and as Tori Spelling's materialistic mother in Tori Spelling in: So NoTORIous (2006), which did not get the seal of approval from Tori's real-life mother. Loni has more recently starred in the resurrected comedy series My Sister Is So Gay (2016). In 2008, she married a fourth time to musician Bob Flick. Loni's autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels\", was published in 1997.\n\nThe quintessential jet-set Euro starlet, Ursula Andress was born in the Swiss canton of Berne on March 19, 1936, one of six children in a strict German Protestant family. Although often seeming icily aloof, a restless streak early demonstrated itself in her personality, and she had an impetuous desire to explore the world outside Switzerland. (For instance, she was tracked down by Interpol for running away from boarding school at 17 years old.) The stunning young woman found work as an art model in Rome and did walk-on parts in three quickie Italian pictures before coming to Hollywood in 1955 and getting nowhere professionally; a four-month fling with rising star James Dean brought her good publicity but not much else. That same year, still just 19, she met and had an affair with fading matinée idol John Derek, who left his wife Pati Behrs and two kids for Ursula even though she spoke almost no English at the time. In 1957 they eloped to Las Vegas, and the new bride put her acting aspirations on hold for a few years thereafter.\n\n1962 saw the relatively unknown Swiss beauty back on the set, playing opposite Sean Connery in the first movie version of Ian Fleming's fanciful \"James Bond\" espionage novels, James Bond 007 jagt Dr. No (1962). Andress' role as bikini-clad Honey Ryder was somewhat brief, and her Swiss/German accent so thick that her entire performance had to be dubbed by a voiceover artist. Nevertheless, her striking looks and smoldering screen presence made a strong impression on moviegoers, immediately establishing her as one of the most desired women in the world and as an ornament to put alongside some of the most bankable talent of the era, such as Elvis Presley in Acapulco (1963) and Dean Martin in Vier für Texas (1963). In 1965, she was one of several European starlets to co-star in Was gibt's Neues, Pussy? (1965) -- a film that perhaps sums up mid-'60s pop culture better than any other -- written by Woody Allen, starring Allen and Peter Sellers, with music by Burt Bacharach, a title song performed by Tom Jones and much on-screen sexual romping.\n\nAndress appeared in many more racy-for-their time movies in both the United States and Europe, including Das 10. Opfer (1965), in which she wore a famously ballistic bra, and Der blaue Max (1966), where she was aptly cast as the sultry, insatiable wife of an aristocratic World War I German general. She was also featured in Casino Royale (1967), a satirical foray into the world of James Bond, and gave a sparkling performance in the T&A-filled crime caper Treffpunkt London Airport (1970). Roles as a prostitute kidnapped by outlaws in Rivalen unter roter Sonne (1971), a stewardess living on the edge in Ich polier' dir deine Glatze (1975), and a bombshell nurse hired to titillate a doddering millionaire to death in Operation mißlungen - Patient lebt (1975) all provided plenty of excuses to throw her clothes to the wind. In Die weiße Göttin der Kannibalen (1978), she was notoriously stripped and slathered in orange paint by a pair of nubiles. Then she took on the sophisticated role of Louise de la Valliere, slinky, conspiratorial mistress of King Louis XIV (Beau Bridges) in Das Geheimnis der eisernen Maske (1979).\n\nAs for her personal life, Andress separated from Derek in 1964 and got divorced two years later, after falling in love with French superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo on the Malaysian set of Die tollen Abenteuer des Monsieur L. (1965). (Ron Ely, John Richardson and Marcello Mastroianni kept her company during the interim.) The relationship with Belmondo hit a wall in 1972, and she was next attached to her leading man from Diamantenpuppe (1973), Italian heartthrob Fabio Testi. When that didn't work out, Andress jumped into the dating pool, sporadically involved with a host of Lotharios including (but by no means limited to) Dennis Hopper, Franco Nero, John DeLorean and Ryan O'Neal. In 1979, she began what would be a long-term romance with Harry Hamlin, her handsome young co-star from Kampf der Titanen (1981) (in which she was cast, predictably, as \"Aphrodite\"). While subsequently traveling in India, Andress' belly began to swell out of her clothing, and she felt very nauseous. What at first seemed a severe case of \"Delhi Belly\" turned out to be pregnancy, her first and only, at age 43. Hamlin encouraged her to have the baby, and on May 19, 1980, the international sex symbol gave birth to a boy named Dimitri Hamlin amid much hoopla.\n\nAfter the birth of her son, Andress scaled back her career, which now focused on slight European productions, as she was raising Dimitri in Italy. This meant turning down a big-budget Mel Brooks film in lieu of Mexico in Flammen (1982) (starring old flame Nero). Occasional television stints on the soap opera Falcon Crest (1981) and critically lauded miniseries Peter der Große (1986) helped maintain her visibility as an actress. Dumped by Hamlin in 1983, she started seeing Fausto Fagone, a Sicilian student three decades her junior, in 1986. In 1991, she met a new man when things dwindled with Fagone -- karate master Jeff Speakman. Since the breakup of that relationship, her love life has gone undocumented. She last worked on a film in 2005. Apparently retired from acting, Ursula makes the rounds of charity events and pops up on foreign talk shows every now and then. She divides her time between family in Switzerland, friends in Virginia and Spain, and her properties in Rome and L.A.\n\nAmerican leading man of the 1940s and 1950s, Dana Andrews was born Carver Dana Andrews on New Years Day 1909 on a farmstead outside Collins, Covington County, Mississippi. One of thirteen children, including fellow actor Steve Forrest, he was a son of Annis (Speed) and Charles Forrest Andrews, a Baptist minister.\n\nAndrews studied business administration at Sam Houston State Teachers College in Texas, but took a bookkeeping job with Gulf Oil in 1929, aged 20, prior to graduating. In 1931, he hitchhiked to California, hoping to get work as an actor. He drove a school bus, dug ditches, picked oranges, worked as a stock boy, and pumped gas while trying without luck to break into the movies. His employer at a Van Nuys gas station believed in him and agreed to invest in him, asking to be repaid if and when Andrews made it as an actor. Andrews studied opera and also entered the Pasadena Community Playhouse, the famed theatre company and drama school. He appeared in scores of plays there in the 1930s, becoming a favorite of the company. He played opposite future star Robert Preston in a play about composers Gilbert and Sullivan, and soon thereafter was offered a contract by Samuel Goldwyn.\n\nIt was two years before Goldwyn and 20th Century-Fox (to whom Goldwyn had sold half of Andrews' contract) put him in a film, but the roles, though secondary, were mostly in top-quality pictures such as In die Falle gelockt (1940) and Ritt zum Ox-Bow (1942). A starring role in the hit Laura (1944), followed by one in Die besten Jahre unseres Lebens (1946), made him a star, but no later film quite lived up to the quality of these. During his career, he had worked with with such directors as Otto Preminger, Fritz Lang, William Wyler, William A. Wellman, Jean Renoir, and Elia Kazan.\n\nAndrews slipped into a steady stream of unremarkable films in which he gave sturdy performances, until age and other interests resulted in fewer appearances. In addition, his increasing alcoholism caused him to lose the confidence of some producers. Andrews took steps to curb his addiction and in his later years was an outspoken member of the National Council on Alcoholism, who decried public refusal to face the problem. He was probably the first actor to do a public service announcement about alcoholism (in 1972 for the U.S. Department of Transportation), and did public speaking tours. Andrews was one of the first to speak out against the degradation of the acting profession, particularly actresses doing nude scenes just to get a role.\n\nAndrews was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1963, serving until 1965. He retired from films in the 1960s and made, he said, more money from real estate than he ever did in movies. Yet he and his second wife, actress Mary Todd, lived quietly in a modest home in Studio City, California. Andrews suffered from Alzheimer's disease in his later years and spent his final days in a nursing facility. He died of congestive heart failure and pneumonia in 1992, aged 83.\n\nSusan Anton has been recognized as a multi-talented international star for more than 35 years in television, film, theater, and concert venues. She was nominated for a Golden Globe in her first film outing, Der Agent (1979), and was soon thereafter signed by NBC to star in her own variety show, Presenting Susan Anton (1979). ABC later signed her to a development deal, where she starred in the hourly drama, Cliffhangers. She has appeared in hundreds of film and television projects over the years. Her Broadway credits include co-starring with the original Broadway cast of Tommy Tune's Tony Award-winning musical, \"The Will Rogers Follies\"; she also worked with director Mike Nichols in David Rabe's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \"Hurlyburly\". She co-starred as \"Velma Von Tussle\" in the Las Vegas production of the Broadway musical, \"Hairspray\", opposite Harvey Fierstein, which was directed by Tony Award winner Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Tony Award winner Jerry Mitchell. She went on to reprise the role for three spectacular evenings at the Hollywood Bowl with an all-star cast, which was directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell. She co-starred in the national tour of the Broadway musical, \"All Shook Up\", directed by Christopher Ashley and choreographed by Sergio Trujillo. Susan starred for seven years in the The Great Radio City Music Hall Spectacular with the legendary The Radio City Rockettes, directed by the late Joe Layton. She also toured in the Neil Simon/Marvin Hamlisch production of \"They're Playing Our Song\" and then went on to co-star with Elizabeth Ashley in the national tour of \"A Couple of White Chicks Sitting Around Talking\". She has shared the stage with legendary entertainers Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Tom Jones, and many more. She toured with country super star Kenny Rogers and had a top 10 country hit with the song \"Killing Time\". Internationally, she had recording success and received a Gold record for her hit, \"Foxy\". Susan and her husband, director Jeff Lester have called Las Vegas home for more than 20 years. In 1997, they opened their production company, \"Big Picture Studios\". Under their banner, Susan executive-produced the award-winning The Last Real Cowboys (2000), starring Oscar winner Billy Bob Thornton, and also executive-produced the documentary, Speed of Life (2008), with Amy Purdy, the inspirational Sochi bronze medalist who was also runner up in last season's Dancing with the Stars (2005). Susan is a minority partner and celebrity brand ambassador in a new beverage company, Spa Girl Cocktails, slated to launch in late 2015.\n\nEve Arden was born Eunice Mary Quedens in Mill Valley, California (near San Francisco), and was interested in show business from an early age. At 16, she made her stage debut after quitting school to join a stock company. After appearing in minor roles in two films under her real name, Eunice Quedens, she found that the stage offered her the same minor roles. By the mid 30s, one of these minor roles would attract notice as a comedy sketch in the stage play \"Ziegfeld Follies\".\n\nBy that time, she had changed her name to Eve Arden, which she adopted while looking over some cosmetics and spotting the names \"Evening in Paris\" and \"Elizabeth Arden\". In 1937, she garnered some attention with a small role in Oh, Doctor (1937), which led to her being cast in a minor role in the film Bühneneingang (1937). By the time the film was finished, her part had expanded into the wise-cracking, fast-talking friend to the lead. She would play virtually the character for most of her career.\n\nWhile her sophisticated wise-cracking would never make her the lead, she would be a busy actress in dozens of movies over the next dozen years. In Die Marx Brothers im Zirkus (1939), she was the acrobatic Peerless Pauline opposite Groucho Marx and the Russian sharp shooter in the comedy The Doughgirls (1944). For her role as Ida in Solange ein Herz schlägt (1945), she received an Academy Award nomination. Famous for her quick ripostes, this led to work in Radio during the 1940s. In 1948, CBS Radio premiered \"Our Miss Brooks\", which would be the perfect show for her character. As her film career began to slow, CBS would take the popular radio show to television in 1952. The television series Our Miss Brooks (1952) would run through 1956 and led to the movie Our Miss Brooks (1956).\n\nWhen the show ended, Arden tried another television series, The Eve Arden Show (1957), but it was soon canceled. In the 1960s, Arden raised a family and did a few guest roles, until her come-back television series The Mothers-In-Law (1967). This show, co-starring Kaye Ballard ran for two seasons. After that, she would make more unsold pilots, a couple of television movies and a few guest shots. She returned in occasional cameo appearances including as Principal McGee in Grease (1978), and Warden June in Freitag der 713. (1982).\n\nAnother in the long line of dramatically handsome foreign imports who made an immediate impact on WWII Hollywood was debonair French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont. The epitome of grace and sophistication, the stylish leading man went on to have a long and respected career on stage, film and TV, both here and abroad.\n\nAumont was born Jean-Pierre Philippe Salomons on January 5, 1911 (some sources list 1909) in Paris, France, to Suzanne (Cahen), an actress, and Alexandre Abraham Salomons, a well-to-do department store executive. His brother, François Villiers (né Francois Salomons), went on to become a film writer/director. His father was a Dutch Jew and his mother was from a French Jewish family; he was of both Ashkenazi and Sephardi ancestry. Jean-Pierre was transferred from various prep schools before enrolling at the Paris Conservatory of Dramatic Art at the age of 16. Run by the renowned Louis Jouvet, young Aumont's first two film roles were prime roles in Jean de la Lune (1931) and Échec et mat (1931). He then went on to appear strongly in a number of Gallic films. He also made an impressive theater debut playing the role of Oedipus in Jean Cocteau's \"La Machine Infernale\" at the Comedie Champs-Elysees in 1934, which set up a long and lucrative tenure on the stage. Splitting his time between live performances and film-making opposite such lovelies as Simone Simon, Danielle Darrieux and Annabella), Aumont served with the French Third Mechanized Division for nearly a year (1939-1940) and earned a medal of distinction for his valour (Croix de Guerre). Two of his finest screen roles came just prior to this: 'Marcel Carne''s farcical comedy Ein sonderbarer Fall (1937) starring mentor Louis Jouvet, and the romantic drama Hôtel du Nord (1938) opposite the lovely Annabella and co-starring Jouvet again.\n\nAumont arrived in America barely speaking English in 1942 and only a few days later was \"discovered\" by stage legend Katharine Cornell, making his American debut in her production of \"Rose Burke\". During the play's Los Angeles engagement, he was signed by MGM for films and made a noticeable debut as Captain Pierre Matard in the espionage war picture Assignment in Brittany (1943) co-starring the tragic Susan Peters. Classily promoted as an up-and-coming Jean Gabin, the lithe, handsome, blue-eyed blond captured the admiration of the American public with his Charles Boyer-like charm and charisma. His second American film was the equally successful The Cross of Lorraine (1943), a dramatic Stalag 17-like story of French POW's held in a German war camp.\n\nThe lovely Technicolor siren Maria Montez, known for her popular (and campy) WWII escapism films at Universal, quickly caught his eye and the couple married in 1943 after only a three-month courtship. An earlier marriage to French's Blanche Montel had ended in divorce in 1940, well before his arrival in America. Aumont again interrupted his burgeoning acting career by serving with the Free French forces in North Africa and was again awarded a medal (Legion of Honor) for his bravery. He was twice wounded during his active years of service.\n\nThe French actor returned to Hollywood films after the war co-starring with Ginger Rogers in the comedy Heartbeat (1946) and appearing as composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in Universal's Lied des Orients (1947). The reception to both were lukewarm and Aumont decided to return to France with his wife (whose career was now in decline), and his daughter (who was born in 1946 and grew up to become the actress Tina Aumont). Seeking to rediscover his earlier glory in European films and the theatre, he also began writing plays. Now and then he would return to the American soil and appeared on Broadway in 1949 with his work \"Figure of a Girl,\" which was retitled \"My Name Is Aquilon\" by the time it arrived on the Great White Way. While it co-starred the embraceable Lilli Palmer, who was also making her Broadway debut, the play itself was not as embraced.\n\nOn the international film scene, Aumont appeared with wife Maria in such uninspired offerings as the United Artist escapist fare Die Herrin von Atlantis (1949), the French crime drama Die Hafenbar von Marseille (1949) [Wicked City] and the Italian adventure La vendetta del corsaro (1951)_ [The Revenge of the Pirates], the last-mentioned proving to be the last for the fetching Ms. Montez. The 39-year-old star tragically drowned in September of 1951 after her hot mineral salt bath triggered a heart seizure.\n\nAfter a period of grieving, Aumont continued transcontinentally, but rather unspectacularly, with acting parts that seemed hardly challenging. He cavorted with Paulette Goddard in the mediocre action adventure Das Zigeunermädchen von Sebastopol (1954); appeared among an international cast in the spectacle Napoléon (1955); co-starred rather stiffly opposite Jean Simmons in the glossy \"sudspenser\" Hilda Crane (1956); was overshadowed by Eleanor Parker, who paled next to Garbo in the remake of Garbo's \"The Painted Veil\" entitled Hongkong war ihr Schicksal (1957); and, played a cameo as the doomed Louis XVI in the US-based Beherrscher der Meere (1959) co-starring wife Marisa. On a more positive note, he, Mel Ferrer and the ever-enchanting Leslie Caron were wonderful in MGM's touching musical Lili (1953). Aumont also fared much better in his 1950s televised appearances of classic works, notably \"Arms and the Man\" and \"Crime and Punishment\".\n\nFollowing a torrid 1955 romance with Grace Kelly (whom, as we all know, went on to marry her Prince), the actor met and married lovely Italian actress Marisa Pavan, the sister of the late Pier Angeli, in 1956, and had two sons, Jean-Claude and Patrick, by her. Troubled by his erratic output and the uneventful film roles offered, which included those in The Enemy General (1960), Der Teufel kommt um vier (1961) and Die dritte Dimension (1962) [Five Miles to Midnight], Aumont wisely refocused on the theatre and his playwriting skills. Stage performances included \"The Heavenly Twins\" and \"A Second String\" (both on Broadway), the title role in \"The Affairs of Anatol\", \"Murderous Angels\" and appearances in the musicals \"Tovarich\" with Vivien Leigh (on Broadway), \"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris,\" \"South Pacific\" (as the debonair Emile DeBecque), and \"Gigi\" with wife Marisa. The couple also went on to form a warmly-received nightclub act in New York.\n\nFor the remainder of his career, Aumont remained the ever-charming and worldly continental, vacillating between the stage (\"Camino Real,\" \"Private Lives,\" \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Tiger at the Gates\"); international films (Das Schloß in den Ardennen (1969), Catherine & Co. (1975), Mahagoni (1975), Nana (1983), Geliebtes Land (1987), Colette (1991) and a pair of Merchant/Ivory films Jefferson in Paris (1995) and The Proprietor (1996)): and classy TV fare (Das Geheimnis der Queen Anne (1980), Melba (1988), A Tale of Two Cities (1989)). Some of the actor's finest movie roles in years occurred in the 1970s with the excellent Die amerikanische Nacht (1973) [Day for Night] and Eine Katze jagt die Maus (1975) [Cat and Mouse].\n\nThe distinguished actor/playwright went awardless throughout his cinematic career but this glaring oversight was finally rectified in the form of the cross of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 1991 and an honorary César Award in 1992. He died in his native country of a heart attack a few weeks after his 90th birthday in 2001."
