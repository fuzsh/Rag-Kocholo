        "text": "By Diane Emeott-Korzen | New Pelican Writer\n\nPompano Beach – Eighty-five people came out to a Your District, Your Community, Your Vote, candidate forum at Zion Church last week. Incumbent District 4 Commissioner/Vice Mayor Beverly Perkins and contender Mary Scofield Phillips presented their views. A third candidate, Kevin Eason, did not attend. The evening was moderated by Pastor Nathan Austin of Zion Church and Pastor Norman Freeman of Greater Antioch Baptist Church. An estimated 60 percent of District 4 comes from these two congregations. Minister Tim Griffith organized the event, sponsored by Faith In Florida.\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat do you feel you offer the community that you are worthy of being elected/re-elected?\n\nPerkins listed a number of accomplishments during her tenure on the commission since 2016. For example, the new Fire Station 61 will be opening soon. Liberty Park lights are completed as is the $4.5 million Apollo Park. Pompano has a new community court at Annie Weaver Center with a judge there twice a month presiding over homlessness and misdemeanor crime cases. In Mitchell Moore Park there is going to be a youth development center.\n\nPhilips said, “There are a lot of things we need in the community” – more senior housing; workforce housing. Phillips would like the city to change its zoning code to allow tiny houses; so an adult child or senior parent having trouble affording their own place could live on the same property as their family. Also, she supports fostering acting and singing programs at the Esther Rolle Museum.\n\nBoth Perkins and Phillips want more black-owned businesses on Martin Luther King Boulevard, and grants for local nonprofit organizations.\n\nHow are you going to get millennials to vote?\n\nPerkins said, “Kids, starting in school and the churches, should be taught the importance of voting. When we were kids, kids went with their parents to vote. We don’t do that anymore, [but they can be taught.]”\n\nPhillips said, “We need to work pretty hard to change things. Millennials, if you give them some entertainment, some way to engage them, you can teach them.”\n\nWhere do you get funding when the commission doesn’t vote with you?\n\nPerkins said, “There is plenty of funding in the school board that doesn’t trickle down to Northwest Pompano. Sanders Park Elementary School, C. Robert Markham Elementary School, and Blanche Ely High School all need funding.”\n\nPhillips said the 33069 zip code is 67.7 percent black and 42.42 percent white, with 3.2 percent unemployment. “I’m a lifelong learner. I enjoy it. As a realtor, a lot of information comes across my desk.”\n\nWe have very passionate people, a lot of division. How can we move this community back together, to bring back unity?\n\nPhillips said, “I’m an optimist. I think we can come together. I like the idea of bringing back the North Broward NAACP.”\n\nPerkins said, “I think we need more than the NAACP to get us back on the right track in Pompano. I see trash on the streets, different issues. As a leader, you have to know when to lead, when to follow. To take yourself out of it when working together.”\n\nWhat can you do for more jobs, opening up the youth community, teaching kids to be industrious, leading by example?\n\nPerkins said, “We have 19,000 residents of District 4 and only 9,000 registered voters. A lot of seniors have died out. They are not being replaced with younger people, who need to know the importance of voting.”\n\nPhillips said, “I have a nonprofit. I’ve been unable to get money from the City of Pompano Beach since 2008. We need to make sure money is put into a fund.”\n\nWhat can you both do to collaborate, work together with others, make sure the District 4 agenda is passed?\n\nPerkins said, “I always believe in collegiate voting. I believe whatever a commissioner asks for, for their district, I support it. Also, if you have a concern, let other commissioners know. I share on the dais what the community tells me to say. Right now, all they hear from is just me.”\n\nPhillips replied, “A lot of times, to get what you want, it’s how you approach people. And it needs to make sense to them. My approach is different. I would outline why they should support it. Why it’s important to the community. It’s a give-and-take. It’s politics.”\n\nPompano has a problem with homelessness. What can be done?\n\nPerkins said, “There is a jail here in Pompano. Next to it is a facility to clothe and house the homeless. We do have a real problem with the homeless. There is a number to call — 954-357-5686. They have pushed them back. They used to be at the beach. Now they are west of Federal Highway.”\n\nPhillips said, “Right in front of my office, every week, I see different homeless faces. I’m told Boca drops off their homeless in Pompano Beach. If so, they need to provide resources. Send the people back to where they came from. Some are mentally ill, some are on drugs, their family kicks them out because they won’t do right.”\n\nAfter people get arrested, who helps them [clear their records for jobs, housing]?\n\nPerkins said, “ I’ve had meetings at E. Pat Larkins. We spend $50 million per year on BSO. We do not see results in the Northwest community.\n\nPhillips said, “We can only expunge one felony [from a person’s record]. We do it every year. The rest has to be done at the state level.”"
