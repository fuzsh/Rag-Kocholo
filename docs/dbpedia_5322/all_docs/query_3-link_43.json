        "text": "Let me guess...you always wondered how Esther Rolle as Florida Evans segued from being Maude Findlay’s (Bea Arthur) housekeeper in suburban Tuckahoe, New York in Maude to a housing project in inner-city Chicago on Good Times. Then there was John Amos, who went from Florida’s husband Henry on Maude to James in Good Times. Two unsolved TV mysteries!\n\nThat aside, Good Times was yet another hit for producer Norman Lear, and it is celebrating the 50-year milestone. Good Times premiered on CBS on February 8, 1974 in the Friday 8:30 p.m. ET time period in place of the short-lived comedy Roll Out! and was an immediate hit.\n\nAs the first series historically centered on an African American family with a loving mother and father present, at the heart of Good Times was the strong bond shared by Florida and James Evans, and their children James, Jr., aka “J.J.” (Jimmie Walker), Thelma (BernNadette Stanis) and Michael (Ralph Carter). Ja’Net DuBois played Willona Woods, Florida’s former schoolmate and their next-door neighbor.\n\n“The Evans family lived, as marginally as possible, in the Cabrini-Green project in Chicago. James held down three jobs if he had to,” said Norman Lear at the time. “Still, we were determined that the family would never go on welfare; they would deal with the reality of their world (gangs, drugs, crime, poverty, etc.), and despite that, the kids would not fail to get an education.”\n\nWhile Good Times was intended to be a timely show focused on the family dealing with serious subjects in a comedic way, Walker’s J.J. was the breakout character (complete with his “Dyn-O-Mite” catchphrase) to the disillusionment of Rolle and Amos. They felt he was not necessarily the type of role model it wanted to demonstrate for the African American community.\n\nEsther Rolle, in particular, was more public voicing her concerns, but it was John Amos who was let go by Norman Lear at the end of season three. In the two-episode fourth season premiere, the Evans family learns of James’ passing in an automobile accident just as they are getting ready to join him in Mississippi where he has a promising new job.\n\nFlorida shouting \"Damn! Damn! Damn!\" in a meltdown after James dies was voted as one of television's most famous moments. Interesting factoid: The same line and scenario was later used on the sitcom Gimme a Break! with Nell Carter’s character Nell Harper breaking down after the death of ‘The Chief,’ played by Dolph Sweet (who really did pass away).\n\nBy season five, Rolle left the series. As the story went, Florida and her new husband Carl (Moses Gunn) moved to Arizona for the sake of Carl’s declining health. Enter then 11-year-old Janet Jackson as Millicent \"Penny\" Gordon, who the family learns is being abused by her mother and Willona eventually adopts. Also more prominently featured was Johnny Brown as Nathan Bookman, the building’s superintendent.\n\nIn the final season of Good Times, Esther Rolle as Florida returns (minus second husband Carl, who was never mentioned again), and Thelma marries football hopeful Keith Anderson (Ben Powers). At the series end, J.J. gets an offer from a comic company, Keith snags a new football contract, Thelma is pregnant, and Florida is asked if she wants to move in with Keith and Thelma in the apartment building across town where Willona and Penny to be moving. A happy ending for all!\n\nHistorically, Good Times was the first spin-off from a spin-off: Maude from All in the Family; Good Times from Maude. And, like The Jeffersons, which launched one year after Good Times, there was a huge disparity in the ages of the cast members. At the sitcom’s inception, Esther Rolle was 53 versus only 34 for John Amos. Amos, meanwhile, was only eight years older than his TV son Jimmie Walker.\n\nOther notable factoids about Good Times include...\n\n1) The producers originally wanted Florida to raise the family on her own, but Esther Rolle argued that it was stereotypical to depict a black family with no father and insisted on having a husband. That led to the casting of John Amos as James. Ironically, after James was killed off, Florida became a single mother.\n\n2) Florida and Willona were supposed to be the same age, but Esther Rolle was actually in the vicinity of 19 years older than Ja’net DoBois.\n\n3) Ralph Carter, who played Michael, was almost replaced with Laurence Fishburne because of a prior commitment to the musical Raisin. The producers of that show allowed him to tape the pilot while he was still doing the play so he could keep his job. In the season one end credits, it read, \"Ralph Carter appears courtesy of Raisin.\"\n\n4) Jimmie Walker said he based his character's mannerisms on Ed Norton from The Honeymooners.\n\n5) Walker was offered the role of The Scarecrow in the 1978 movie The Wiz but had to turn it down because it conflicted with his Good Times taping schedule. Director Sidney Lumet thought Walker looked like a scarecrow and was unfazed when Walker admitted he could not sing or dance. Michael Jackson was cast instead. It would be Jackson’s first and only acting role in a feature film.\n\n6) Norman Lear was often criticized about the characters in Good Times living in a slum and perpetuating so many stereotypes about the black experience. This eventually led to the creation of The Jeffersons, which attempted to show a black family in a more positive, upwardly mobile light.\n\n7) Mike Evans, who originated the role of Lionel, left The Jeffersons to work behind-the-scenes as a writer Good Times, which is co-created with Eric Monte. The character of Michael Evans was loosely based on him as a child. When Good Times ended in 1979, Evans returned to The Jeffersons. During his absence, Lionel was played by Damon Evans (no relation to Mike).\n\n8) John Amos as James Evans was one of the first sitcom characters to die. According to BernNadette Stanis, the cast didn't know about his departure until they read it in the script.\n\n9) In addition to acting, BernNadette Stanis is the author of four books: Situations 101: Relationships, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly; For Men Only; Situations 101: Finances; and The Last Night.\n\n10) Chip Fields auditioned for the role of Thelma Evans. The producers kept her in mind, and she was later cast as Penny's abusive mother, Lynetta Gordon. Eventually Chip's daughter, Kim Fields, was seen of Good Times as Kim, a friend of Penny's, and one of the students on Florida's school bus. And, of course, Kim was later cast as Dorothy “Tootie” Ramsay on The Facts of Life.\n\n11) Louis Gossett, Jr. was brought in to play Wilbert, Florida's brother, for one episode because the producers were shopping around for possible replacements for John Amos. Gossett also appeared in an earlier episode as Thelma's boyfriend.\n\n12) Norman Lear saw Gary Coleman in a bank commercial and was determined to find a show for him. He showcased Coleman as a guest star on Good Times and The Jeffersons before his star-making turn as Arnold Jackson on Diff’rent Strokes.\n\n13) Matthew \"Stymie\" Beard, a former child star from the 1930s Our Gang theatrical comedy shorts, appeared in five episodes of Good Times, including four appearances as James' friend Monty.\n\n14) Over the years, Willona's ex-husband had three different names: Alvin, Ray, and Roger.\n\n15) Norman Lear hired artist Ernie Barnes to paint the pictures which J.J. used in Good Times. His 1976 painting The Sugar Shack, which was used during the closing credits, served as the cover for Marvin Gaye’s album I Want You. In May 2022, it was sold at an auction to Houston-based energy trader Bill Perkins for $15.3 million.\n\n16) The opening theme song for Good Times was composed by Dave Grusin, with lyrics by Oscar-winners Alan and Marilyn Bergman, and performed by Motown artists Jimmy Gilstrap and Blinky Williams. A common misconception is one of the lines, “hangin’ in a chow line,” which is actually \"hangin' in and jivin’.\"\n\nIn celebration of 50 years of Good Times, all together now...\n\nGood times, any time you meet a payment\n\nGood times, any time you meet a friend\n\nGood times, any time you’re out from under\n\nNot getting hassled, not getting hustled\n\nKeepin' your head above water\n\nMaking a wave when you can\n\nTemporary layoffs, Good Times\n\nEasy credit rip-offs, Good Times\n\nScratchin' and survivin’, Good Times\n\nHangin’ in and jivin’, Good Times\n\nAin't we lucky we got 'em\n\nGood Times!!!"
