        "text": "The Public School Scholars Programme was instituted in 2015 to promote college readiness, equity and college access in the public school system. The Ministry of Education will offer guaranteed scholarship awards for each Bahamian high school graduate enrolled in the programme. The award will range from $10,000.00 but will not exceed $15,000.00 per academic year, for a maximum of four (4) years. Partnering institutions are required to offer a matching grant of equal or higher value. Eligible candidates must have attended a public school for a minimum of one year, be officially recommended by their secondary high schools and meet the admissions requirement of the institution. Candidates must have a genuine interest in a career of national priority, outstanding leadership and character traits, proof of extracurricular involvement and contributions to their school community. Scholarship applicants must also demonstrate financial need and a genuine desire to pursue a college / university education. First preference is given to first generation college students and students attending college within one year of graduating from high school. Qualified Bahamian public high school candidates must apply or be accepted to partnering colleges and universities. Students must also pass an interview. Our first cohort of bachelorâ€™s degree scholars graduated in June of 2018.\n\n2024 APPLY\n\nParticipating Partner Institutions"
