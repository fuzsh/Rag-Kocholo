        "text": "By Kitty Oliver, Author/Oral Historian\n\nAs a journalist, I once wrote stories about how Black schools in Northwest Pompano Beach had to close so that children could pick beans during harvest time. About political tensions between lifelong residents of “old Pompano” and “beach” transplants, the newer arrivals. About the election of its first Black city commissioner who later became the first Black mayor. About the first round of hopeful redevelopment plans.\n\nAnd now, as an oral historian, several decades later, I’ve been revisiting the city’s re-envisioned, re-vitalized, and culturally-gentrified “town center” feel with homages to its Black history sites as well.\n\nBlanche Ely: A Black History Memory\n\nThe Historic Ali Cultural Arts Center in Pompano Beach (Ali Cultural Arts) has become a base for community arts groups that are educating and inspiring today’s youth to achieve. It’s only fitting.\n\nThe 87-year-old building was once the home of Frank and Florence Major Ali, an industrious, creative couple of Cuban and Bahamian descent, respectively, who made their historical mark as the first African American business owners in Pompano Beach. The center also features educational exhibits like the upcoming one on African American Women Changemakers running February 21- April 10 featuring information on historic icons and national civil rights leaders as well as Emmy-winning actress Esther Rolle who grew up in Northwest Pompano and Blanche Ely, a local legend.\n\nThe Blanche Ely House Museum has had a somewhat fitful history, opening for a period in the early 2000s, languishing for a while, then re-opening in 2019. But now it is emerging as a center for the preservation of aspects of school and community life that inspired Black youth to achieve in the past."
