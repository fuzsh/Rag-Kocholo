About 160 students participated.\n\nAudrey Rozier played Whitney Houston.\n\n“I feel good to be able to educate people on African American culture. I like playing her role.”\n\nItalia Lewis played Oprah Winfrey.\n\n“I enjoy learning about black history. I liked learning about Oprah Winfrey.”\n\nCindy Firman played the role of Rosa Parks. “I learned that she would not give up her seat to a white man. I was glad to learn about what she did.”\n\nNyla Lormeus played Esther Rolle, the famous “Good Times” actress who graduated from Ely. “I was able to learn about Rolle and her career as an actor.”\n\nConnie McGirt led the event. She teaches African American History and U.S. History at Ely.\n\n“I want the students to learn about African American history. It is important that they know about the important role they played in history.”"
