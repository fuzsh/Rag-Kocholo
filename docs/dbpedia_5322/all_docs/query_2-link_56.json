Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 875) congratulating Spelman College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, as amended. The Clerk read as follows: H. Res. 875 Whereas Spelman College was established by Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles, school teachers and Baptist missionaries, in 1881 in Atlanta, Georgia, for the purpose of educating African American women and girls; Whereas as a result of the benevolence of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. and Laura Spelman Rockefeller, the name of the institution was changed from ``Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary'' to ``Spelman Seminary'' in honor of the Spelman family; Whereas the curriculum expanded to include high school and college classes, and Spelman Seminary conferred its first high school diplomas in 1887, and its first college degrees in 1901; Whereas in 1924, Spelman Seminary officially became Spelman College and grew to become a leading undergraduate institution for African American women; Whereas Spelman College was ranked among the top 75 Best Liberal Arts Colleges according to U.S. News & World Report, 2007 edition; Whereas Spelman College is one of six institutions designated by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a Model Institution for Excellence in undergraduate science and math education; Whereas the administration of Spelman College has initiated a strategic plan for Spelman (``Spelman ALIVE'') that includes five goals: Academic excellence, Leadership development, Improving the infrastructure, Visibility of accomplishments of the campus community, and Exemplary customer service, all designed to create a vision for Spelman of ``Nothing Less than the Best''; and Whereas Spelman College has prepared more than six generations of African American women to reach the highest levels of academic, community, and professional achievement: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) congratulates Spelman College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary; and (2) commends the administration, faculty, staff, students, and alumnae of Spelman College for their outstanding achievements, and contributions to African American education, history, and culture. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 875. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 875, which is a resolution to recognize the contributions of Spelman College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary. I sincerely want to thank the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend, Mr. Lewis, for introducing this resolution and for his continuing recognition of the important role Spelman College plays in educating young women from all over the world. Spelman College, located in Atlanta, Georgia, was originally founded in 1881 by two women with the intent of serving as an all-female seminary school. The school has since expanded its mission and ranks now as one of the leading liberal arts institutions offering a full range of degrees. Today, Spelman educates over 2,000 young women and brings students from across the United States and around the globe to our community of Atlanta. As a Historically Black College and University, Spelman is one of a diverse community of institutions. Historically, black colleges and universities [[Page H6266]] include 2- and 4-year institutions, both public and private, as well as single sex and coed. To be designated a Historically Black College or University, an institution must have been established prior to 1964, with a primary mission of educating African Americans. Mr. Speaker, these schools have a long, proud and well-established heritage. These institutions have been educating students of this Nation for over 100 years. And while comprising less than 3 percent of the country's 2- and 4-year institutions, they are responsible for producing a significant number of all bachelors, masters and professional degrees earned by African Americans. Congress has repeatedly recognized the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Between 1995 and 2006, congressional funding for strengthening the Historical Black Colleges and Universities program rose from $109 million to $238 million, a 118 percent increase. Furthermore, funding for the graduate programs increased from $19.6 million to $57.9 million over that same period of time, an increase of nearly 200 percent. Historically, Spelman College has been named as a college with the ``best environment.'' Spelman works with its fellow colleges and universities to advance the goals of educating African American students as part of the largest consortium of historically black higher education institutions in the world. {time} 1600 It does this by sharing cross-registration with its partner institutions, which include Clark Atlanta University, the Interdenominational Theological Center, Morehouse College and the Morehouse School of Medicine. Mr. Speaker, for this reason and many more, I urge my colleagues to honor the 125th anniversary of Spelman College and support H. Res. 875. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he might consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), the author of this legislation and the chief deputy whip of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and friend Mr. Davis for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and delight that I rise with my colleague Mr. Kingston of Georgia to offer H. Res. 875, a resolution commemorating the 125th anniversary of Spelman College. I must also thank Mr. Price and Mr. Gingrey of Georgia for being here to participate in the passing of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, not so long ago, 50 years ago, in many parts of the American south, black women had limited options when it came to furthering their education after high school. Just 50 years ago, black women were turned away from many colleges and universities throughout the south. They were turned away not because of a low GPA, not because of inferior SAT scores and not for submitting a poorly written essay with their application. So many of these students were turned away simply because of the color of their skin. Mr. Speaker, fortunately, since 1881, Spelman College has been here to provide hope, opportunity and a bright future for women of color. Created for the purpose of educating African American women and girls, Spelman is part of the Atlanta University Center, which is the largest concentration of historic black universities and colleges in the Nation. Spelman College is located in Atlanta, Georgia, and I have the privilege of representing Spelman as part of my congressional district. Spelman has a very diverse student population from 41 States and 15 foreign countries. It has been ranked among the top 75 liberal arts colleges in the Nation by U.S. News and World Report. Mr. Speaker, one of the many things that I admire about Spelman College is that its students are encouraged to pursue the study of fields where minorities and women are often underrepresented. This is evident in Spelman's continued emphasis on exposing black women to the fields of science and engineering. Spelman has established a partnership with NASA, and it is one of six institutions designated by the National Science Foundation and NASA as a model institution for excellence in undergraduate science and math education. Mr. Speaker, last summer, Spelman College made history when six Spelman women qualified for the International Robo Cup 2005 Four-Legged Robot Soccer Competition in Japan. They were the first and only historically black college and university, the only all-women institution and the only United States undergraduate institution to qualify for this tournament. Mr. Speaker, under the leadership of current Spelman's president, Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, I have every confidence that the institution will continue to excel. Dr. Tatum's extraordinary vision for the college will enable Spelman to make extraordinary contributions to our Nation for another 125 years and beyond. I want to congratulate President Tatum for creating and executing the Spelman ALIVE initiative that promotes the following ideas for Spelman: Academic excellence, Leadership development, Improving our environment, Visibility of our achievements and Exemplary customer service. I understand that this program is enjoying much success. Mr. Speaker, for 125 years, Spelman College has empowered women to fully use their talents to succeed and to better the world. For many years, Spelman College served as a refuge for black women seeking to further their education when they were turned away by others. Fortunately, times have changed, and black women have virtually unlimited options when it comes to pursuing a college education today. Nevertheless, Spelman's impact on our society remains as important as ever. As one of two historically black women's colleges in the Nation, Spelman College has a rich and historical legacy that we must continue to celebrate. So, Mr. Speaker, I ask and urge all of my colleagues in the House to join me and Congressman Kingston in commemorating the 125th anniversary of Spelman College and in supporting this resolution. Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Kingston). Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Price for his cosponsorship of this, and also, I wanted to acknowledge my friends Mr. Scott and Mr. Gingrey for their cosponsorship, but I also wanted to say, many thanks to my friend John Lewis, the lead sponsor of this. When he asked me to cosponsor the resolution commemorating Spelman College for their 125th anniversary, it was an easy ``yes,'' Mr. Speaker, and it was easy because I had an employee who is a Spelman graduate. Her name is Karen Robenson Boggans. She is not working with me anymore and, indeed, has gone on to bigger and better things, but I hope that I helped her on the pathway to the top. She is doing great things. When she was my legislative assistant, Karen handled many issues. She was smart, intelligent, capable, task-oriented, focused and got the job done, and only because she was moving out of town did she leave our office. In fact, when she moved back to Savannah, I was able to get her to come back to work for us for a short period of time, and then she got a bigger calling one more time. But if she is an example, and she is, of a Spelman graduate, it is a great institution, and I know it to be a great institution. As Mr. Lewis pointed out: in 1881, when Spelman was started, it was a school for African American women because there were not many choices. Now there are lots and lots of choices, and yet Spelman still continues to show lots of leadership. It is still a great choice for women to go to this school because they learn how to be competitive, and they learn business, and they learn how to write, and they learn the basics of getting the job done. They are all over the world today. They are in 39 different countries and 42 different States. It is international in scope. The funding for historically black colleges and institutions since 1995, under the leadership, I believe, of J.C. Watts, and as much as anybody, but good bipartisan leadership has increased 118 percent. Spelman College is [[Page H6267]] an investment not just in historically black colleges and institutions but in America, because you are investing in your own people who will go on to become great leaders in our country. So I am proud to stand as a cosponsor of this, and I thank the gentleman. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 6 minutes to another son of Georgia (Mr. Scott). Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much to my distinguished colleague from Chicago, Congressman Davis; my distinguished colleague and Congressman from Georgia, John Lewis; to my distinguished colleagues from Georgia, Mr. Kingston, Dr. Price. I appreciate so much having this opportunity, and I am also pleased to join with my colleague Mr. Gingrey. I am honored on this day to recognize one of our Nation's most prestigious institutions of higher learning, and that is indeed Spelman College. Singularly devoted to the education of women, Spelman College now celebrates its 125th anniversary this year. What an extraordinary story this is, Mr. Speaker, because when you tell the story of Spelman, you are telling a truly genuine American story that represents the heart and soul of what America is all about. Spelman College is a private and historically black college that opened its doors less than two full decades after the Emancipation Proclamation and the ratification of the 13th amendment, and out of necessity, and it was necessary to provide educational opportunities for black women in the south when none existed. To get the proper perspective on this, Mr. Speaker, we must understand that it was not long, just a few years before this, when the law of the land was not to allow African Americans to even read a book. Just think of that: In this country, it was against the law for African Americans to even learn to read. It is within this backdrop that Spelman College stepped forward. Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles founded Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, naming it first the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary. It began as a comprehensive academy that provided education for women from elementary school all the way through to college. It was renamed Spelman Seminary in 1884 and underwent one final change, becoming Spelman College in 1924. Let me stop for a moment to give the importance of this name Spelman. It originated from a member of the distinguished Rockefeller family. For without John D. Rockefeller, it can arguably be said that there would have been no Spelman. Reflecting on the early relationship forged by this institution's founders, it was a unique relationship with John D. Rockefeller himself who provided necessary resources that ensured the longevity of this college. So as we celebrate the 125th anniversary of Spelman College, let us pay direct homage to the Rockefeller family, without whom this college would not have been. The academic achievements of its students and the rigor of its academic programs have brought numerous honors to this private college. Spelman was awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa honor society in 1998, one of only four historically black colleges and universities to receive such an honor. In 2003, Spelman was named one of six institutions to receive a $4.2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities to eliminate health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. They put together a health and wellness initiative that set the standard for academic institutions' outreach to the community to improve health care. Spelman College did that. Throughout its history, Spelman's campus has grown, reflecting the addition of new programs and the strengthening of its renowned liberal arts program. A new academic center that houses several departments, a museum and the college archives resulted from a $20 million donation from Bill and Camille Cosby. Indeed, an institution lives in the hearts and minds of the people who inhabit it, and Spelman's many accomplished graduates include the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman; actress Esther Rolle; Pulitzer Prize novelist Alice Walker; and writer, Pearl Cleage. Many distinguished presidents have been at its helm, notably Dr. Johnetta Cole, the institution's first black female president and current president of Bennett College; Dr. Audrey Manley, former deputy Surgeon General; and current president, Dr. Beverly Tatum, administrator and clinical psychologist. What a great day this is, Mr. Speaker, for us to be able to stand here in this wonderful country and pay homage to Spelman College on its 125th anniversary. What a distinguished institution, and we are proud of the great service that it has given to African Americans for sure, but most definitely to this great Nation of America and the world. {time} 1615 Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to my friend and colleague from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey). Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise today to congratulate Spelman College on its 125th anniversary. This is a historic anniversary for a historic institution, and I am indeed proud to cosponsor the resolution of my good friend Mr. Lewis and my other Georgia colleagues in honoring Spelman College. In 1881, two female schoolteachers, Sophia Packard and Harriet Giles, established Spelman College in Atlanta for the purpose of educating African American women and girls. Over its 125-year history, there have been many individuals who have worked hard to bring excellence to this institution, a tradition that indeed continues today. Spelman College today encompasses a student body of more than 2,100 students from more than 21 States and 15 foreign countries. In 2006, their excellence was noted nationally when U.S. News and World Report ranked Spelman College among the top 75 best liberal arts colleges in the country. Mr. Speaker, in this resolution, just looking at a couple of points, Spelman College was ranked, as I say, among the top 75 best liberal arts colleges, according to U.S. News and World Report; also the Association of Medical Colleges ranked Spelman fifth among undergraduate programs for black students accepted to medical school; and Spelman is one of six institutions designated by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a model institution for excellence in undergraduate science and math studies. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to commend Spelman College President Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, as well as the administration, the faculty, students, and alumni for contributing to the enormous success Spelman College has achieved over these past 125 years. With Dr. Tatum's vision for achieving excellence, I know the next 125-plus years will see the same quality education and the strong community support of Spelman College. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with Representatives Price, Kingston, Gingrey, Scott, and my good friend and the chief sponsor of this legislation, Mr. Lewis from Georgia. I rise in strong support of H. Res. 875 congratulating Spelman College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary. I am pleased to take this opportunity to recognize the achievements of this fine institution of higher education and to pay special tribute to the unique role it has played in the lives of students, especially African American women. Spelman College, founded in 1881, for the purposes of educating African American women, set a high standard early on for providing quality instruction and valuable experiences, especially at a time when opportunities were not plentiful for African Americans, let alone African American women. As a Historically Black College, Spelman has focused on not only increasing opportunities for black women, but it is also their mission to ensure students think objectively, critically, and creatively within a moral framework. Founded by two Massachusetts teachers, Harriet Giles and Sophia Packard, the school was originally named the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary. The school was started with 11 black women and $100 given to Miss Giles and Miss Packard [[Page H6268]] by a church congregation in Medford, Massachusetts. With the $100, the two teachers built more than a school, rather a foundation and a reason for women to believe in themselves and to aspire to do and be more. The school eventually became Spelman College, named after John D. Rockefeller's in-laws. When funds ran out, Rockefeller settled the debt on the property and donated funds for what is currently the oldest building on campus, Rockefeller Hall. This institution produced many notable alumni, including Marian Wright Edelman, head of the Children's Defense Fund; novelist Alice Walker; as well as the mother of Martin Luther King, Jr., Ms. Alberta Williams King. Spelman continues the tradition of excellence as one of the best liberal arts colleges in the Nation, according to the latest rankings of U.S. News and World Report. This prestige is coupled with the designation by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a model institution for excellence in undergraduate science and math education. Spelman is one of six in the country with this designation. In the Spelman tradition of seeing a need and filling the need, the school created the Spelman College Health and Wellness Initiative. This program is helping to create preventive strategies for the unique circumstances that apply to all African American women. These strategies are currently being developed and used to prevent cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS in African American women. To top this all off, last year Spelman College made history when six Spelman women qualified for the international RoboCup 2005 robot soccer competition in Osaka, Japan. They were the first and only Historically Black College and University, the only all-women institution, and the only United States undergraduate institution to qualify for this tournament. For those of you unfamiliar with the RoboCup, it is truly an amazing competition. Students from all over the world enter their robot into a competition to play soccer against humans. Spelman is one of those schools that offers its students the opportunity to broaden their horizons and reach their fullest potential. Among African American women especially, and in black life, the young African American woman who gets an opportunity to go to Spelman considers herself to be not only honored but is often in awe. It is considered to be sui generis, fruit of the loom, in a class by itself, all alone. And there is nothing more delightful to a young African American woman growing up in this country than the opportunity to attend Spelman. So I join with all of my colleagues in congratulating this fine and outstanding institution, and I urge support for this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased also to join Mr. Davis and my good friends from Georgia, Mr. Scott, and the author, Mr. Lewis, in urging all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 875. Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Spelman College on the occasion of their 125th anniversary. 125 years ago, two Baptist missionaries Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for the purpose of educating African American women and girls. Founded as Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary on April 11, 1881, the first Bible class was held in the basement of the Friendship Baptist Church for 11 brave young women--who only years earlier had been enslaved. Since that day, Spelman College has maintained a tradition of producing African American women of excellence who have gone on to serve in various capacities throughout the world and has empowered its daughters to make a difference in their communities while shattering stereotypes. Spelman is an institution within the African American community and remains an intricate part of American history. In 1884, the college was renamed Spelman Seminary, and later Spelman College, in honor of Mrs. Laura Spelman Rockefeller and her parents Harvey Buel and Lucy Henry Spelman, who were longtime activists in the antislavery movement. In 1968, thousands came to mourn the loss of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose body was laid in state on Spelman's Campus in the historic Sisters Chapel. And in 1987, millions of viewers were introduced to Spelman's beautiful campus through the groundbreaking Cosby Show spin- off ``A Different World.'' Today, Spelman continues to be the leading institution for educating African American women and was ranked among the top 75 Best Liberal Arts Colleges according to U.S. News & World Report, 2005 edition. I am proud to say that I am a friend of Spelman College. Dr. Johnnetta B. Cole, the first African American female to serve as president of Spelman is a good friend of mine. Additionally, Nicole Y. Williams, a class of 2000 Spelman graduate and the current president of the Washington, D.C. Chapter of the National Alumnae Association of Spelman College has been a member of my staff for over five years serving as my Communications Director. Spelman's current President, Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum continues to strengthen the Spelman legacy through her Spelman ALIVE strategic plan that includes five goals: Academic excellence, Leadership development, Improving the infrastructure, Visibility of accomplishments of the campus community, and Exemplary customer service, all designed to create a vision for Spelman of `Nothing Less than the Best'. So today, I join my colleagues in commending Spelman College on reaching this milestone and wish them continued success. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my congratulations to Spelman College for providing African American women with outstanding education and guidance for the last 125 years. Spelman College was founded in 1881 as Atlanta Baptist Female Academy by two women commissioned by the Baptist church to provide educational opportunities for newly freed black women. Spelman began in a damp church basement with 11 pupils, mostly women, determined to learn to read the Bible and write well enough to send letters to their families in the North. The academy first offered postsecondary education in 1897. It adopted its present name in 1924. Two years after its founding, the former barracks and drill grounds used for federal troops after the Civil War were purchased for the school for $15,000. To pay the enormous debt, the black community raised $4000, the Negro Baptists of Georgia raised $3000, and individuals donated $1300, which left an outstanding balance of $6700. John D. Rockefeller was so impressed with the school when he visited that before he left, he paid the outstanding balance, which resulted in a name change to Spelman Seminary, in honor of Rockefeller's mother-in- law, Harvey Spelman. Several years later, Rockefeller donated $40,000 toward the building of Rockefeller Hall, named in his honor. Spelman continues to be blessed with friends dedicated to its mission to provide high-quality educational opportunities to black women. Spelman was the recipient of a $20 million gift from entertainer Bill Cosby and his wife Camille to build the Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Academic Center. The school also receives $37 million from the DeWitt Wallace/Spelman College Fund, which was established by the founder of the Reader's Digest Association. The College has gained national recognition as a result of such philanthropic gifts and the fact that it was the basis for the fictional black college in the television show ``A Different World.'' Despite large-scale development, Spelman continues to place special emphasis on the cultural, social, and personal development of each student and sisterhood and individual discovery is encouraged and stressed. Spelman continues to prepare women to become successful in any field they choose while also instilling a sense of giving back to the community, with their motto of ``Women Who Serve''. The founder of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, Spelman '60, is perhaps this generation's most effective voice for the disadvantaged and forgotten in our society. The author Alice Walker, Spelman '63, who received the Pulitzer Prize in literature for The Color Purple is also a dedicated activist and social visionary. I am particularly proud that a Massachusetts native and member of the Spelman class of 2006, Tulani Elisa, has chosen to serve the people of the 7th Congressional District of Massachusetts here in my Washington office. Congratulations to a great American institution of higher learning and of commitment to service. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 875, Congratulating Spelman College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary. Spelman College was established by Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles, school teachers and Baptist missionaries, in 1881 in Atlanta, Georgia, in order to educate African American women and girls. The seminary conferred its first high school diplomas in 1887, and its first college degrees in 1901. In 1924, Spelman Seminary officially became Spelman College and grew to become a leading undergraduate institution for African American women. [[Page H6269]] Spelman College has prepared more than six generations of African American women to reach the highest levels of academic, community, and professional achievement. Spelman College continues to pave the way for new generations of African American students. The college offers competitive and high quality academic programs in liberal arts, humanities, sciences, communications, and engineering, to name just a few. The Association of Medical Colleges ranks Spelman College fifth among undergraduate programs for Black students accepted to medical school, and Spelman is one of six institutions designated by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a Model Institution for Excellence in undergraduate science and math education. I urge my colleagues to support the achievements of this institution, and support this resolution honoring the 125th anniversary of Spelman College. I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 875, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds of those present have voted in the affirmative. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________"
