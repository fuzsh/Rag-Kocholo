        "text": "Pompano Beach ( pom-PƏ-noh) is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is located along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, just north of Fort Lauderdale and 36 miles north of Miami. The nearby Hillsboro Inlet forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. As of the 2020 census, the population was 112,046, making it the sixth-largest city in Broward County, the ninth-largest city in the South Florida metropolitan area, and the 20th-largest city in Florida.\n\nPompano Beach Airpark, located within the city, is the home of the Goodyear Blimp Spirit of Innovation.\n\nHistory\n\nSee also: Kester Cottages\n\nThe city's name is derived from the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus), a fish found off the Atlantic coast.\n\nThere had been scattered settlers in the area since at least the mid-1880s, but the first documented permanent residents of the Pompano area were George Butler and Frank Sheen and their families, who arrived in 1896 as railway employees. The first train arrived in the small Pompano settlement on February 22, 1896. It is said that Sheen gave the community its name after jotting down on his survey of the area the name of the fish he had for dinner. The coming of the railroad led to development farther west from the coast. In 1906, Pompano became the southernmost settlement in newly created Palm Beach County. That year, the Hillsboro Lighthouse was completed on the beach.\n\nOn July 3, 1908, a new municipality was incorporated in what was then Dade County: the Town of Pompano. John R. Mizell was elected the first mayor. In 1915, Broward County was established, with a northern boundary at the Hillsboro Canal. Thus, within eight years, Pompano had been in three counties. Pompano Beach experienced significant growth during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. In 1940, the U.S. Supreme Court disallowed forced confessions in Chambers v. Florida, a dispute stemming from a murder in Pompano Beach.\n\nFollowing the population boom due to World War II, in 1947, the City of Pompano merged with the newly formed municipality on the beach and became the City of Pompano Beach. In 1950, the population of the city reached 5,682. Like most of southeast Florida, Pompano Beach experienced great growth in the late 20th century as many people moved there from northern parts of the United States. A substantial seasonal population also spends its winters in the area. The city of Pompano Beach celebrated its centennial in 2008. It is twinned with West Bromwich in the United Kingdom.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 25.4 square miles (65.8 km2), of which 24.0 square miles (62.2 km2) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.6 km2), or 5.54%, is water.\n\nA 2017 study showed 73,000 residents living within FEMA's coastal floodplain.\n\nPompano Beach is in northeastern Broward County along the Atlantic Ocean. It includes about 3 miles (5 km) of beachfront, extending from the intersection of State Road A1A and Terra Mar Drive to the Hillsboro Inlet. The city is bounded by the following municipalities:\n\nOn its northeast:\n\nHillsboro Beach\n\nLighthouse Point\n\nOn its north:\n\nDeerfield Beach\n\nOn its west:\n\nCoconut Creek\n\nOn its southwest:\n\nMargate\n\nNorth Lauderdale\n\nOn its south:\n\nFort Lauderdale\n\nOn its southeast:\n\nLauderdale-by-the-Sea\n\nClimate\n\nPompano Beach has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with hot, humid summers and warm winters.\n\nNeighborhoods\n\nThese are the neighborhoods and communities that are officially recognized by the City of Pompano Beach.\n\nAndrews Industrial District\n\nArvida-Pompano Park\n\nAvalon Harbor\n\nAvondale\n\nBeach\n\nBlanche Ely\n\nBoulevard Park\n\nCanal Point\n\nCivic Campus\n\nCollier City\n\nCresthaven\n\nCypress Bend\n\nCypress Cove\n\nCypress Lakes\n\nDowntown Pompano Beach\n\nGarden Isles\n\nGardens\n\nGolfview Estates\n\nHarbor Village\n\nPompano Beach Highlands\n\nHillsboro Shores\n\nIsland Club\n\nJohn Knox Village\n\nKendall Green\n\nLeisureville\n\nLiberty Park\n\nLoch Lomond\n\nLyons Park\n\nNorthwest Pompano\n\nOld Collier\n\nOld Pompano\n\nPalm Aire\n\nPine Tree Park\n\nPompano Airpark\n\nSanders Park\n\nSanta Barbara Estates\n\nSanta Barbara Shores\n\nSnug Harbor\n\nSouth Dixie\n\nTerra Mar\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1920 636 — 1930 2,614 311.0% 1940 4,427 69.4% 1950 5,682 28.3% 1960 15,992 181.5% 1970 38,587 141.3% 1980 52,618 36.4% 1990 72,411 37.6% 2000 78,191 8.0% 2010 99,845 27.7% 2020 112,046 12.2% 2022 (est.) 112,302 12.5% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1920–1970 1980 1990\n\n2000 2010 2020 2022\n\nHistorical racial composition 2020 2010 2000 1990 1980 White (non-Hispanic) 41.0% 50.6% 60.8% 66.5% 80.6% Hispanic or Latino 23.8% 17.5% 9.9% 5.4% 2.2% Black or African American (non-Hispanic) 28.0% 28.2% 25.0% 27.4% 16.8% Asian and Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic) 1.6% 1.3% 0.8% 0.5% 0.4% Native American (non-Hispanic) 0.1% 0.2% 0.1% 0.1% Some other race (non-Hispanic) 1.3% 0.7% 0.3% 0.1% Two or more races (non-Hispanic) 4.1% 1.5% 3.0% N/A N/A Population 112,046 99,845 78,191 72,411 52,618\n\nDemographic characteristics 2020 2010 2000 1990 1980 Households 59,742 55,885 44,496 32,157 24,244 Persons per household 1.88 1.79 1.76 2.25 2.17 Sex Ratio 101.5 104.3 97.3 92.7 86.2 Ages 0–17 18.4% 18.3% 17.7% 17.1% 15.0% Ages 18–64 61.2% 62.8% 58.9% 65.4% 55.2% Ages 65 + 20.3% 18.9% 23.4% 17.5% 29.8% Median age 43.2 42.7 42.2 41.0 50.9 Population 112,046 99,845 78,191 72,411 52,618\n\nEconomic indicators 2017–21 American Community Survey Miramar Broward County Florida Median income $31,587 $36,222 $34,367 Median household income $56,109 $64,522 $61,777 Poverty Rate 15.6% 12.4% 13.1% High school diploma 84.7% 90.0% 89.0% Bachelor's degree 29.0% 34.3% 31.5% Advanced degree 11.0% 13.1% 11.7%\n\nLanguage spoken at home 2015 2010 2000 1990 1980 English 64.6% 64.1% 75.7% 83.6% 91.1% Spanish or Spanish Creole 17.4% 16.1% 9.3% 4.7% 2.1% French or Haitian Creole 10.2% 11.8% 8.4% 6.9% 1.7% Portuguese N/A 2.8% 1.5% 0.3% N/A Other Languages 7.8% 5.2% 5.1% 4.5% 5.1%\n\nNativity 2015 2010 2000 1990 1980 % population native-born 72.8% 74.6% 79.7% 85.8% 90.0% ... born in the United States 70.3% 72.4% 78.5% 84.7% 89.5% ... born in Puerto Rico or Island Areas 1.3% 1.2% 0.6% 1.6% 0.5% ... born to American parents abroad 1.2% 1.1% 0.7% 0.6% % population foreign-born 27.2% 25.4% 20.3% 14.2% 10.0% ... born in Haiti 6.1% 6.9% 4.8% 4.4% N/A ... born in Mexico 2.6% 2.6% 2.0% 0.5% < 0.1% ... born in Brazil 2.1% 2.4% 1.4% 0.2% N/A ... born in other countries 16.4% 13.5% 12.1% 9.1% 10.0%\n\nAs of 2010, Italian-Americans made up 8.5% of the population, forming the second largest ancestry group in the city.\n\nAs of 2010, before annexation of other areas, Pompano Beach has the highest concentration of residents of Haitian ancestry in the country, at 9.3% of the population. while it had the highest percentage of Brazilians in the US, at 2.67%.\n\nIn 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $36,073, and the median income for a family was $44,195.
