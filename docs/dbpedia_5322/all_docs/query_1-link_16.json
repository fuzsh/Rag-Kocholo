        "text": "I would like to thank all TalentoTotal supporters who have reached out to me, Carol, and the TalentoTotal team to express empathy, and encourage us to pursue truth and justice while defending ourselves against a Brazilian company with a US$60 Billion market cap (NYSE). https://lnkd.in/eheqgG83 For all future leaders out there who are part of the TalentoTotal network today or will be in the future, you too may find yourself in a difficult situation where you must stand firm on your principles and defend yourself, your organization, and the people that you love and support at any cost. This centers the third and most important tenet of TalentoTotal’s Triple Cs… #1 Competence, #2 Confidence, #3 Courage, the enabling virtue. You may be Competent (able to do something well) and Confident (believe that you are able to be successful), but without COURAGE you will do nothing when your name and number is called. Be sure to remember that we lead from the front and we take no cowards in our organization or programs. We also want to apologize to the prospective Black and Indigenous MBA candidates from Brazil, Colombia, and the USA who applied to the TalentoTotal GMAT Boot Camp and anticipated beginning their MBA journey with us last month, but whose dreams have been deferred due to our ongoing litigation with representatives of Nubank. We wish that we never got involved with this “Neobank,” which has a well-documented multi-year track record of controversial actions that have called into question its commitment to diversity in a predominantly Black country (Brazil) that constitutes nearly 90% of its entire business. 2020 Brazil's Nubank says it 'failed' - https://lnkd.in/ew3YgWVM 2022 Layoffs at Nubank heats up controversy over D&I policies - https://lnkd.in/evmib4v3 2024 How Nubank hushed up a scandal involving an employee who created a hate forum - https://lnkd.in/esv7yZnn We would also like to keep our supporters aware of the most recent timeline: December 20, 2023 - Nubank Initial Petition filed with request that the proceedings be held in secret, with access restricted to the parties and their attorney, and undisclosed to the general public. January 24, 2024 - Judge's Preliminary Decision ruling in favor of TalentoTotal and denying Nubank’s request for a temporary injunction to block TalentoTotal’s financial assets and the request to process the case in secrecy. April 5, 2024 - TalentoTotal becomes aware of the lawsuit for the first time and provides notification of receipt to judicial authorities. April 26, 2024 - TalentoTotal presents plea and defense after 18 days. August 13, 2024 - Nubank has still not responded to TalentoTotal’s plea and the judicial process after 108 days.\n\nSão Paulo | Brazil It was an honor to take a step back in the audience and witness Cínthia Maia, the first Black Brazilian woman in history to graduate from the Full-Time MBA Program at Cambridge Judge Business School, speak to prospective MBA Candidates about her experience as they sat in the same seat that she was in four years ago. The University of Cambridge, founded in 1209, is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation and a brand that has endured for nearly one-thousand years. This is a big deal and serves as the ultimate inspiration for so many Afro-descendant and Indigenous (ADI) young professionals across Latin America. Cinthia’s relentless appetite for excellence, “never quit” mindset, and the exceptional support of our GMAT Instructor and CJBS alumnus, Jayson Beatty and TotalMBA Prep coach, Thomas Sheppard, was instrumental. Cínthia achieved a competitive score on the GMAT and was able to craft a compelling personal narrative that demonstrated the unique perspective and value that she brought to Cambridge Judge Business School. I was also thrilled to see past participants in the TalentoTotal GMAT Boot Camp speak to their peers about their relentless pursuit of the MBA and how they have made immense personal sacrifices to continue striving for success on the GMAT and admission to a top business school. A special thanks to alumnus Pedro Guizzo, and MBA Admissions and Recruitment Coordinators Agnieszka Jankowska and Elizabeth Langer, who flew all the way from the United Kingdom to provide unique insights into the MBA admissions process and the Cambridge Judge experience. We hope to see more TalentoTotal Candidates join the Cambridge Judge community as Full-Time MBA Candidates in the near future! #TalentoTotal #TotalMBAPrep #GreatBritain #Competence #ANFEA #BusinessSchool #Cambridge #IndigoPrep #Confidence #UnitedKingdom #CambridgeUniversity #Scholarship #GMAT #London #Courage #MBA #Brazil #Leadership #England #ADI #SaoPaulo #Global #CJBS #Rio #BeatTheGMAT #Europe\n\nQuibdó | Colombia #TBT Back in 2018, less than six months after officially launching TalentoTotal from my apartment in Bogotá, I traveled with several phenomenal Afro-American business leaders to Chocó. Two years prior, some of my colleagues and Colombian friends discouraged me from traveling to the Pacific Coast of Colombia. However, I always felt more at home in Quibdó, surrounded by people who looked like me, than I ever did in Bogotá. I also knew how important it was for young people to be exposed to intentional recruiting and engagement from school officials, admissions officers, talent acquisition, and business leaders. It was the same intentional recruiting that led an admissions officer from the United States Air Force Academy to my predominantly Black high school in Pompano Beach, Florida, exposing me to the U.S. Service Academies and an opportunity to serve my country. Shortly thereafter, I would have my first international experience, traveling to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as an exchange cadet at Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras. I have seen some of the young people that we met on this trip to Chocó, blossom into outstanding young professionals, including the first ever Black Colombian woman and Chocoana to be hired as a business analyst at McKinsey & Company in over 25 years. We look forward to exposing the world’s best universities and companies to the untapped potential of these amazing Afro-descendant and Indigenous (ADI) Colombian young professionals. #TalentoTotal #Courage #TotalMBAPrep #Brazil #BusinessSchool #Cali #TotalLAWPrep #Cartagena #IndigoPrep #Competence #LawSchool #Quibdo #Scholarship #GMAT #Confidence #SaoPaulo #MBA #Colombia #Leadership #Bolsa #IBLF #Choco #ADI #Pacifico #Global #Beca #Rio #BeatTheGMAT\n\nNew York | United States I recently attended the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP Diversity Reception, an event that I have had the privilege to attend since 2014. On this occasion, I had the honor of hearing remarks from Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Professor \"Skip\" Gates’ series “Black in Latin America,” was a major inspiration for me and TalentoTotal. Very few Afro-Americans are exposed to the complex experience of Afro-descendant and Indigenous (ADI) people in Latin America, but his deep dive into the Black experience in Mexico, Peru, Haiti, and Brazil made me say “Oh, someone else can see what I see!” In Brazil, Professor Gates delved behind the façade of Carnival to discover how the ‘rainbow nation’ is waking up to its legacy as the world’s largest slave economy. I also had a chance to introduce myself and TalentoTotal to Mrs. Loretta Lynch, the first Afro-American woman to serve as the U.S. Attorney General, head of the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the U.S. Federal Government, also known as the “Nation’s Top Cop.” A year prior, my Chief of Staff and Chief Legal Officer, Carol Silva, had a chance to meet Mrs. Lynch at the Paul Weiss Diversity Reception, which to me was one of the highlights of my leadership experience with Carol, providing her with an opportunity to meet one of the most accomplished Black lawyers on the planet. You can be what you can see! I look forward to seeing more Afro-descendant and Indigenous (ADI) lawyers from Latin America have the opportunity to become a part of this community and engage with other ADI professionals who are exceptional leaders in their field. #TalentoTotal #TotalMBAPrep #NewYorkCity #Justice #RioDeJaneiro #Ethics #MBA #GMAT #Truth #Capital #Brazil #SãoPaulo #Finance #Competence #Leadership #ONG #BootCamp #Whistleblower #NGO #Confidence #Excellence #Courage #USA #TotalLAWPrep #Diversidade #NonProfit\n\nStanford | United States Back in 2018, less than two months after officially launching TalentoTotal from my apartment in Bogotá (Colombia), I met Daniel Uribe. At the time, Daniel was the CEO & Co-Founder of Mentors4u Colombia, a non-profit that identifies and supports the most promising under-represented and diverse (racial + socio-economic diversity) college students in Colombia. What impressed me most about Daniel, was that he clearly understood how non-profit models from abroad [Management Leadership for Tomorrow, Mentors4u, SEO (Sponsors for Educational Opportunity), etc.] could be applied in Latin America to overcome major socioeconomic challenges in the region. We bonded around our experiences in the United States and a commitment to helping other people access the same opportunities in Latin America that we did through structured non-profit programs abroad. A few months after meeting Daniel, I had an opportunity to conduct a mock interview with him before his final interview for the Full-Time MBA Program at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. I was delighted to find out that Daniel was one of a handful of applicants, perhaps two, from Colombia admitted to Stanford that year (2019). Fast forward to January 2020 and Daniel would graciously open a door for me to visit Stanford and present TalentoTotal to Kirsten Moss, Assistant Dean of MBA Admissions, and Outreach Director Wil Torres. I was able to highlight TalentoTotal’s early MBA admissions success stories and the fact that Stanford GSB had not had a single self-declared Afro-descendant or Indigenous (ADI) Full-Time MBA Candidate from Brazil or Colombia in its 95-year history. TalentoTotal sought to open a door for high-potential ADI applicants from Latin America who met and exceeded the standard for excellence via their competitive GMAT scores, exceptional professional experience, and freakishly remarkable ability to overcome enormous obstacles in their upbringing. Four years later, that meeting held at the McClelland Building would bear fruit in the admission of two of the nine Brazilians admitted to Stanford GSB, TalentoTotal Candidates Rafaella Lellis and Leonardo Vieira, these two being the only Afro-Brazilians admitted this year (2024). That is 22% for all of Brazil (population 215 million) at the most competitive business school in the world (6% acceptance rate) from TalentoTotal. I am still a Chicago Booth (numbers) guy 😎. Although it may look easy, these historic results require a tremendous amount of hard work on behalf of each TalentoTotal Candidate and their Coach (Belen Romero / Douglas Nagy), in addition to the unsung support that they receive from a long list of Champions who have supported TalentoTotal along the way. Special thanks to Allison Rouse, Bruno Rigonatti, and João Jablonski for supporting TalentoTotal over the years. We look forward to more outstanding high-potential ADI Candidates from around the world entering the GSB in the future.\n\nRio de Janeiro | Brazil Almost a year ago, Caio Martins set a very high bar for every other Participant in the TalentoTotal GMAT Boot Camp. He was not only the first Participant to sit for the official GMAT Exam upon completion of our 8-week Online Course and 3-Day In-Person Capstone Course in Rio de Janeiro, but he also walked away from his first GMAT exam ever with a score of 700. I was more excited about the next phase of his journey than his impressive GMAT score. You see, this is the best part of my job, helping someone understand who they really are, what they are most passionate about, and what to do with it all. It is the moment where I get to play Quincy Jones to Caio’s Michael Jackson. Producer and Artist get a chance to walk into the imagination studio, where we develop each Candidate’s personal narrative (MBA essays), and literally dream up a personal story. Back then Caio told me about his passion for sports, in addition to the impact that Capoeira had on his self-awareness, leadership development, and connection to his African heritage. He also expressed this fanatical love that he had for Botafogo Football. In our sessions, we started throwing ideas out there: his love for numbers and his professional experience as a data scientist at QuintoAndar, Moneyball / Billy Beane, sports analytics, the NCAA, sports management, etc. At the same time, I started thinking about schools in my country (USA) that might be a perfect fit for this combination of numbers, the MBA, and sports. Having coming of age during the Fab Five era, and like everyone else in the country who had a Michigan Starter Jacket and the Nike Air Force Max Fab Five Editions, I was a huge Michigan fan. More importantly, TalentoTotal, has developed a very strong relationship with the University of Michigan over the years. Bryan L. Johnson was the first Afro-American admissions officer from the United States that held an event with TalentoTotal focused on Afro-descendant and Indigenous (ADI) young professionals in São Paulo. TalentoTotal also participated in the Multidisciplinary Action Project (MAP) with Michigan Ross in 2021. We could not be more excited to have our first TalentoTotal TotalMBA Prep Candidate entering the Full-Time MBA Program at Michigan Ross this fall. Not only did Caio achieve his goal of getting into his dream school, a sports powerhouse and the most highly regarded athletic program in the USA, he is shooting his shot at working at a place, Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, that probably would not be considered work for Caio. We call it a dream job, and I now refer to him as Caio “Beane” Martins 😎. We hope that Mr. John Textor is soon able to read the letter that led Caio Martins to being offered admission to one of the world's top business schools, the University of Michigan - Stephen M. Ross School of Business! Special thanks to Thairo Arruda, Danilo Caixeiro, Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, Michelle Pava, Dennis Oswald, and Jaime B.."
