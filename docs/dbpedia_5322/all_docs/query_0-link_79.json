        "text": "Deborah Adair was born in Lynchburg, Virginia on May 23, 1952 to a father who was a Navy officer and a mother who was a Spanish teacher. She grew up with her brother Ashley and sister Ann. Her major influences were her mother and grandmother who always taught her to have confidence and self-assurance by telling her that she can have any job she wanted. She earned a degree in advertising and marketing at University of Washington, working afterward as a copywriter, commercial producer and assistant promotion manager for radio stations in Seattle, Washington. Her four-year marriage to Gary Baker, a budding politician, ended in 1978, prompting her to move to Hollywood. She waited tables and worked as a stewardess for a short time. But a flair for dramatic reading in high school led to voice-over work on commercials, then local stage productions. She found an agent who helped her land small parts in several TV series. But her big break came in 1980 when she was cast as Jill Foster Abbott on Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). She was the third actress to play that role, but she made the character her own by playing her as a beautiful, sparkly bad girl. In 1983, she left daytime soap opera during stalled contract negotiations to accept the role of Tracy Kendall on highly rated night time soap opera Der Denver-Clan (1981), where she played yet another bad girl.\n\nAaron Spelling, the producer on \"Dynasty\", was so impressed with her performance that he took her off \"Dynasty\" a year later and gave her the lead role of Daisy Lloyd on another prime time show Finder of Lost Loves (1984), where she finally played a good girl. But that show was canceled a year later and Adair guest-starred on other shows, including Spelling's show Love Boat (1977) and Hotel (1983). In 1986, the \"Young and the Restless\" producers beckoned her back for one week to reprise her role as Jill when Brenda Dickson was out for a short time due to tension on the set. Adair maintained she had fun for that one week playing Jill, but Dickson remembered it differently when she unexpectedly came back to find Adair in the dressing room being uncomfortable. A few months later, Dickson left the role and Jess Walton was hired as a permanent replacement for Dickson. Of the four actresses who have played Jill since 1973, Adair is forever remembered as the \"pretty Jill.\" But she was frustrated that her career had stalled just when her personal life gained momentum. She married producer Chip Hayes in 1987, and although it was a very happy marriage, she couldn't have children and it made her unhappy at the time. In 1990, Adair was performing in previews of Cynthia Heimel's play \"A Girl's Guide to Chaos,\" when she had a freaky accident and herniated a disk. The accident caused her excruciating pain and she spent a year, on and off, in bed. She did some soul searching during that time and felt that everything happens in its own time.\n\nAfter she recovered, she picked up the pieces of her career and moved on to do a TV movie for Aaron Spelling titled Rich Men, Single Women (1990) (1990), where she played opposite another Spelling favorite: Heather Locklear. And her career picked up even more steam when Spelling reunited her with Locklear in the recurring role as Lucy Cabot on his prime time show Melrose Place (1992). She enjoyed being on the show because she spent a lot of time with her husband Hayes, who was one of the producers. While on \"Melrose Place,\" she originated the role of Kate Roberts on Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965) and became one of the few actors in history who had both a daytime soap opera and a nighttime soap opera at the same time. She left \"Melrose Place\" after one year to concentrate on the multi-dimensional role of Kate on \"Days of our Lives,\" and her gamble paid off as she won the Best Supporting Actress Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1994. But Adair and her husband wanted children. In 1995, she left her \"Days of Our Lives\" role to be a full-time mom after she and her husband adopted a child. Although, Lauren Koslow took over the role and played it for more than 15 years, Adair's fans cannot seem to forget her and hopes she will return to acting. But she enjoys the role of being real life mom so much that she and her husband adopted another child in 1997. For now, Adair seems content with her home life in Virginia and has not expressed any desire to return to acting, much to the chagrin of her fans.\n\nThe scintillating, sultry-eyed blonde (formerly a redhead) star of screen, TV and award-winning stage went on to become best known, however, for her sensual delivery pitching cigars in taunting '60s ads and commercials with her Mae Westian come-on line \"Why don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime?\" This, of course, was at a time when smoking was considered quite sexy and fashionable, and Edie Adams went above and beyond the call of duty in making these ads legendary.\n\nEdie had her hand dipped in all pools of entertainment. She was a singing siren, an award-winning Broadway musical entertainer, a deft impressionist and comedienne, a serious dramatic actress, a commercial saleswoman and a viable TV celebrity. Off-stage, she showed remarkable poise and resourcefulness when her famous first husband, landmark TV comic Ernie Kovacs, was tragically killed in a January 1962 car crash in Los Angeles and she found her family finances in dire straits.\n\nShe was born Edith Elizabeth Enke on April 16, 1927, in the relatively small town of Kingston, Pennsylvania, but moved while fairly young to Grove City. Her family relocated again, this time to Tenafly, New Jersey, where she grew up. Following her graduation from high school, Edie aspired to become an opera singer and studied voice and piano at New York's Juilliard School of Music. She then went on to take acting classes at the Columbia School of Drama.\n\nHer theatrical debut occurred with a 1947 production of \"Blithe Spirit\", and a year later she appeared in the stage show \"Goodnight Ladies\". Gradually building up her singing reputation via the nightclub circuit, her big break came when Arthur Godfrey booked her on his \"Talent Scouts\" show. She didn't come out the winner, but a TV director who caught sight of her performance envisioned in her a seductive \"straight man\" who could mesh well with a certain zany comedian. In 1951, Edie (then known as Edith Adams) was signed up as a featured singer on Ernie Kovacs's comedy show that originated in Philadelphia. The show, live and unrehearsed, became an innovative, groundbreaking effort in the relatively new medium. Outrageous and even incomprehensible at times, his comedy was deemed way ahead of its time and, as a result, had problems reaching mainstream audiences who didn't \"get it\", and the programs were short-lived. Various Kovacs platforms that included Edie were Ernie in Kovacsland (1951), \"Kovacs on the Korner\" (1952), and, of course, The Ernie Kovacs Show (1952). She and Kovacs eloped to Mexico City in 1954 and their union produced a daughter, Mia Kovacs. The duo were a popular couple in the Hollywood social circuit (moving there from New York in the late '50s) and the connections she developed out there were quite valuable in furthering her career.\n\nEarly '50s TV opened many doors for Edie and she waltzed right through them. Her New York stage debut in the popular musical \"Wonderful Town\" in 1952 had her walking away with the Theatre World Award for \"Best Newcomer\". A few years later, she slithered away with a supporting Tony Award for her bodacious take on the \"Daisy Mae\" character in the musical \"Li'l Abner\" (1956). Following that were more musical and dramatic ventures on the stage, including \"The Merry Widow\" (1957) (a show she would return to more than once), \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1960) and \"Free as a Bird\" (1960). On film, Edie showed the public that she wasn't just a pretty face with her sharply unsympathetic supporting performance in Billy Wilder's Das Appartement (1960) and a funny, sexier one in the second of Rock Hudson and Doris Day's three battle-of-the-sexes romps, Ein Pyjama für zwei (1961). Surprisingly, Edie and Ernie never appeared together in a film. Edie remained primarily a TV fixture and, outside of her Emmy-nominated coupling with Kovacs, winningly played the Fairy Godmother in Julie Andrews' popular TV version of Cinderella (1957), appeared regularly with Jack Paar and Dinah Shore on their respective variety shows, acted on various prime-time shows, and graced a number of celebrity game and talk show panels.\n\nOne of Edie's last pairings with Kovacs was in 1960 when they appeared as guests on the very last episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (1957). The pair appeared as themselves, with one of the highlights being Edie crooning the lovely ballad \"That's All\". Kovacs' sudden 1962 death was a terrible reversal of fortunes for Edie. An inveterate gambler, he left her owing much money to the IRS. Instead of filing bankruptcy, however, she worked her way out of debt. In the process, her career received a second wind. Perhaps it didn't hurt that the public adored Edie and that she was a genuinely sympathetic figure in the wake of her private tragedy.\n\nShe returned to the nightclub circuit from whence she came, recorded albums, and also toured the country in various dramatic and musical comedy vehicles, including \"Rain\" (as Sadie Thompson), \"Bells Are Ringing\", \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as Annie Oakley), \"I Do! I Do!\", \"Anything Goes\" and \"Bus Stop\". She also received outstanding notices in a few of her films, whether dramas (Verliebt in einen Fremden (1963), Der Kandidat (1964)) or frivolous comedies (Bob auf Safari (1963), Eine total, total verrückte Welt (1963), Ein Ehebett zur Probe (1963), Venedig sehen - und erben... (1967)). Moreover, she was handed her own musical variety show Here's Edie (1963) (aka \"The Edie Adams Show\") and received a couple of Emmy nominations for her efforts. She also took advantage of her famous impressions of Zsa Zsa Gabor and others, appearing in various TV comedy formats.\n\nMore than anything, however, it was her come-hither temptress pitching Muriel cigars that had TV audiences' tongues wagging. It was a smashingly successful and highly profitable coup for Edie professionally. Her late husband, a notorious cigar smoker, at one time sold Dutch Master cigars on TV. The idea then for Edie to pitch a competing slimmer cigar on TV was only natural. She had much to do with the direction of the commercials, which ran throughout the 1960s, providing them with a perfect blend of class, glamour and sensuality.\n\nWhile growing noticeably heavier in later years, she never lost her trademark humor and sex appeal. Edie could still be seen from time to time on the stage in such shows as \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", the female version of \"The Odd Couple\", \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Nunsense\". She remained committed to the end to restoring/preserving her late husband's videotapes and kinescopes of his ground-breaking '50s TV work. She also recalled her offbeat life with Kovacs in the book \"Sing a Pretty Song\", which was published in 1990.\n\nEdie got married again in 1964, to photographer Marty Mills, with whom she had a son, Josh Mills. That union ended in divorce in 1971. The following year, Edie married jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. She and Candoli, who died in January of 2008, divorced in 1989. In another eerie, tragic circumstance, daughter Mia Kovacs was killed in a 1982 Los Angeles auto accident at age 22 -- 20 years after her father's similar demise. Suffering from cancer and losing weight in her latter years, the beloved Edie died of complications from pneumonia at age 81 in Los Angeles.\n\nThe only son of Green Acres (1965) star Eddie Albert and Mexican actress/dancer Margo, Edward Laurence Albert managed to come out from under his father's strong shadow and make a gallant showing of his own as a gifted thespian. Born in Los Angeles on February 20, 1951, Edward's multi-cultural heritage and talented gene pool allowed him to become a man of many talents: songwriter, drummer, singer, photographer and, most importantly, activist.\n\nGrowing up, he inherited an early interest in music and the performing arts. He made an auspicious film debut at the age of 14 in The Fool Killer (1965) co-starring as a young runaway who teams up with a tormented Civil War veteran (Anthony Perkins), a teaming that leads to murder. A strong, mature role for such a youngster, his next film appearance wouldn't come about until seven years later. In the meantime Edward attended Oxford University and was studying psychology at UCLA when offered the breakthrough of a lifetime.\n\nSigned up to play the difficult role of blind Don Baker--played on Broadway by Keir Dullea--who yearns for freedom away from his domineering mom (Oscar winner Eileen Heckart) and finds it in the arms of a liberated lass named Jill (Goldie Hawn) in Schmetterlinge sind frei (1972), Edward easily captured the hearts of millions with his tender, life-affirming performance. Edward walked home with the cinema's Golden Globe Award as \"Male Newcomer of the Year.\" A confident, intelligent actor with a serene handsomeness and 1000-watt smile who just happened to possess the most magnetic pale eyes this side of Meg Foster, Edward was on a seemingly strong path to film stardom. Although he never found a comparable success to \"Butterfly,\" he did follow it up with another theater comedy favorite, Vierzig Karat (1973), in which he had a dalliance with older actress Liv Ullmann. He also played Charlton Heston's military son in Schlacht um Midway (1976), followed by highly visible roles in Das Domino-Prinzip (1977) and Der große Grieche (1978).\n\nWhen film stardom did not pan out, Edward saw TV as a welcoming medium and made up for his sudden lack of star power with wonderful turns in major TV minimovies, notably The Last Convertible (1979). By the 1980s he had started making the rounds in formula low-budget action films and usually fared best when his flashy villainous side came into view. While such obvious movie titles as Das Haus der Verdammten (1982), Fist Fighter (1988), Demon Keeper (1994) and Stageghost (2000) pointed out the lack of quality in his offerings, it did provide a steady income and visibility. He also made frequent guest appearances on such shows as Falcon Crest (1981), L.A. Law: Staranwälte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993) that kept him in the public eye. A solid regular as both good guy and bad guy on series TV, he gave his life (and, it seems, his paycheck) to the Beast after three seasons on Die Schöne und das Biest (1987) and, in contrast, played the dastardly Dr. Bennett Devlin on the daytime soap Port Charles (1997) for its first three seasons. Edward also used his vocal talents in animation involving such superhero icons as The Fantastic Four - Das Superteam (1978), New Spiderman (1994) and \"The Power Rangers\".\n\nFrom his father and mother Edward developed a deep love and appreciation for the land and the diversity of cultures. As such, he divided his time between acting work and activism just as his father had done. Having owned a ranch in Malibu for over 30 years, he was a strong, positive influence and passionate spokesperson when it came to environmental and cultural affairs. In recent years he served on the California Coastal Commission and California Native American Heritage Commission.\n\nLong married to lovely British-born actress Katherine Woodville, the couple's daughter, Thais, continued the family musical tradition as a singer/songwriter for the rock group Sugar in Wartime. Following his mother's passing from brain cancer in 1985, Edward became a selfless caregiver to his aging father, who began to develop early signs of Alzheimer's disease in the 1990s. His father lived for more than a decade in declining health, dying in May 2005. In early 2005, Edward discovered he too was seriously ill after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He died surrounded by family on September 22, 2006, at the relatively young age of 55.\n\nAna Alicia Ortiz Torres is a Mexican actress, she was born in Mexico City, Mexico on December 12, 1956. Ana Alicia became the third of four children to Carlos Celestino Ortiz and Alicia Torres Ortiz. Her parents were hotel agents in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. She grew up between Acapulco, Mexico City and El Paso, Texas from age 6 after the passing of her father. There, she lived with her grandmother, widowed mother, her uncle Louie and three siblings in a house her father had purchased for her grandmother.\n\nAna Alicia received a full scholarship to attend the prestigious Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Upon arrival, Ana Alicia auditioned and won the lead role for Jules Feiffer's \"Crawling Arnold\". On summer break after her freshmen year, Ana Alicia auditioned for The Adobe Horseshoe Dinner Theatre outside El Paso, Texas. The theatre offered her a position as a recurring actress in all feature productions. The opportunity would allow her to work with name actors from Hollywood and New York and receive a large weekly salary. She accepted the offer and also acquired her actor's equity card through her term. She left Wellesley and finished her education at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Ana Alicia spent the next three years, performing in main stage productions at UTEP as well as having significant roles in the Adobe Horseshoe repertoire.\n\nAfter graduation, Ana Alicia moved to Los Angeles and struggled to attain success as an actress while studying for her law school entrance exam. Six months later, her big acting break came when she won the role of Alicia Nieves on ABC's Ryan's Hope (1975). According to Ana Alicia, working on the show in New York was exciting - not only because it was an acting job, but because she was a fan of the the show. Although the role was a secondary one - Nieves had romances with policeman Bob Reid and Dr. Pat Ryan. It provided her with much-needed exposure.\n\nAfter 15 months, Ana Alicia left the show to become one of the last Universal Studios contract players. She moved to Los Angeles and in addition to her work as a contract player, she attended Southwestern University Law School at night. As she acquired larger roles that required her to leave town, it became impossible to continue the grueling schedule of acting during the day and studying for school at night. She had to make a choice so she sat down and wrote the pros and cons of each decision and when she realized her passion was to act, she made the very difficult decision to drop out of law school. Once she was focused, her career began to open up quickly.\n\nShe landed several roles on major television films and series' episodes. Within a year, the Universal terminated their contract player department. It was the end of an era. Soon after, her teacher Milton Katselis suggested she stop playing virginal roles and turn to roles such as the tortured, sexually deprived Maggie in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". Exploring this previously undiscovered part of her acting range, Ana Alicia pursued an audition for Falcon Crest (1981). In the room was a female casting director Doris Sabbagh along with Earl Hamner, Robert McCollough, and Larry Elikann. Ana Alicia's job was to seduce Lorenzo, played in the room by Doris. As Ana Alicia ran her fingers up Doris' stockings, conservative Southerner Earl Hamner stood up and stopped the scene, and said, \"Thank you very much. That was wonderful.\" Less than an hour later, Ana Alicia's agent called to let her know she had won the role of Melissa Agretti.\n\nAna Alicia was on the show for seven years, playing the ambitious, scheming Melissa Agretti, and playing opposite Jane Wyman as Angela Channing and a plethora of handsome men. In October of 1988, Ana Alicia was written out of Falcon Crest (1981), and the show subsequently dropped considerably in the ratings. In a last ditch attempt to revitalize the show, she was brought back to the show later that season as a look-a-like of Melissa's, named Samantha Ross. The guest stint was short-lived and Ana Alicia quickly moved on to other projects, including the TV movies Katastrophenflug 243 (1990) and Rio Shannon (1993), as well as the feature film, Romero (1989). Ana Alicia has also devoted much of her time to various animal and human causes. She was the national spokesperson for the Humane Society, and has presented awards promoting Hispanic achievements in the media on behalf of the Golden Eagle Awards. Lorenzo Lamas was co-presenter.\n\nIn 1991, while in France hosting an episode of The World's Greatest Stunts for GRB Entertainment, she met and fell madly in love with her now ex husband Gary Benz. In 1996, after finishing the pilot for Acapulco Heat, Ana Alicia made the decision to leave her acting career and invest in being a mother to her two young children Cathryn and Michael, her new passion in life.\n\nIn March 2015, having raised her children and with her youngest in college, she returned to her first love but as a producer opening up her own production company Quebrada Entertainment: its purpose is to develop scripted and unscripted film and television that reaches a culturally and demographically diverse audience across all genres through the development and execution of quality storytelling.\n\nA native of New Jersey and son of a mechanic, African-American John Amos has relied on his imposing build, eruptive nature and strong, forceful looks to obtain acting jobs, and a serious desire for better roles to earn a satisfying place in the annals of film and TV. He has found it a constant uphill battle to further himself in an industry that tends to diminish an actor's talents with severe and/or demeaning stereotypes and easy pigeonholing. A tough, often hot-headed guy with a somewhat tender side, John would succeed far better on stage than on film and TV...with one extremely noteworthy exceptions.\n\nBorn on December 27, 1939, John was first employed as an advertising copywriter, a social worker at New York's Vera Institute of Justice, and an American and Canadian semi-professional football player before receiving his calling as an actor. A stand-up comic on the Greenwich Village circuit, the work eventually took him West and, ultimately, led to his hiring as a staff writer on Leslie Uggams' musical variety show in 1969. Making his legit stage debut in a 1971 L.A. production of the comedy \"Norman, Is That You?\", John went on to earn a Los Angeles Drama Critics nomination for \"Best Actor\". As such, he formed his own theater company and produced \"Norman, Is That You?\" on tour.\n\nThe following year he returned to New York to take his first Broadway bow in \"Tough To Get Help\". By this time he had secured secondary work on the classic Oh Mary (1970) as Gordy the weatherman. His character remained on the periphery, however, and he left the show after three discouraging seasons. On the bright side, he won the recurring role of the sporadically-unemployed husband of maid Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle) on Norman Lear's Maude (1972) starring Bea Arthur. The two characters were spun-off into their own popular series as the parental leads in Good Times (1974).\n\nGood Times (1974), a family sitcom that took place in a Chicago ghetto high-rise, initially prided itself as being the first network series ever to be created by African-Americans. But subsequent episodes were taken over by others and John was increasingly disgruntled by the lack of quality of the scripts and the direction Lear was taking the show. Once focused on the importance of family values, it was shifting more and more toward the silly antics of Jimmie 'JJ' Walker, who was becoming a runaway hit on the show as the aimless, egotistical, jive-talking teenage son JJ. John began frequently clashing with the higher-ups and, by 1976, was released from the series, with his character being killed in an off-camera car accident while finding employment out of state.\n\nAmos rebounded quickly when he won the Emmy-nominated role of the adult Kunte Kinte in the ground-breaking epic mini-series Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), one of the most powerful and reverential TV features ever to hit television. It was THE TV role of his career, but he found other quality roles for other black actors extremely difficult to come by. He tried his best to avoid the dim-headed lugs and crime-motivated characters that came his way. Along with a few parts (the mini-movie Willa (1979) and the films Beastmaster - Der Befreier (1982) and Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988)), he had to endure the mediocre (guest spots on Love Boat (1977), \"The A-Team\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" \"One Life to Live\"). John also toiled through a number of action-themed films that focused more on grit and testosterone than talent.\n\nHe found one answer to this acting dilemma on the proscenium stage. In 1985, the play \"Split Second\" earned him the NAACP Award as Best Actor. He also received fine reviews in a Berkshire Theater festival production of \"The Boys Next Door\", a tour of O'Neill's towering play \"The Emperor Jones\", and in a Detroit production of Athol Fugard's \"Master Harold...and The Boys\". In addition, John directed two well-received productions, \"Miss Reardon Drinks a Little\" and \"Twelve Angry Men\", in the Bahamas. He took on Shakespeare as Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\" at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare and earned strong notices in the late August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Fences\" at the Capital Repertory Company in Albany, New York. Overseas he received plaudits for his appearance in a heralded production of \"The Life and Death of a Buffalo Soldier\" at the Bristol's Old Vic in England. Capping his theatrical career was the 1990 inaugural of his one-man show \"Halley's Comet\", an amusing and humanistic American journey into the life of an 87-year-old who recalls, among other things, World War II, the golden age of radio, the early civil rights movement, and the sighting of the Comet when he was 11. He wrote and has frequently directed the show, which continues to play into the 2007-2008 season.\n\nIn recent years, John has enjoyed recurring parts on \"The West Wing\" and \"The District\", and is more recently appearing in the offbeat series Men in Trees (2006) starring Anne Heche. John Amos has two children by his former wife Noel Amos and two children. Son K.C. Amos director, writer, producer, editor and daughter Shannon Amos a director, writer and producer. Amos has one grand child,a grand-daughter, Quiera Williams.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Morey Amsterdam started in Vaudeville at the age of 14, as a straight man for his piano-playing brother. His father, a concert violinist who worked with the Chicago Opera and the San Francisco Symphony, wanted Morey to pursue a career in classical music however Morey had other plans. By the time he was 16, he was working at a Chicago speakeasy owned by Al Brown - better known as Al Capone. When he was caught in the middle of a shootout in the club one night, Amsterdam decided to seek safer bookings. He moved to California, where he became a writer and gag man for such stars as Fanny Brice, Jimmy Durante and Will Rogers. Morey would become known as the \"Human Joke Machine\" because he could tell a joke about any subject on request. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was on the radio, where his humor brought him fame and notoriety. He was also a songwriter, and some of his best known songs were \"Why Oh Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming?\" and \"Rum and Coca-Cola\". By 1947, he had three different daily radio shows and comedian Fred Allen said, \"The only thing I can turn on without getting Amsterdam is the faucet\". His first TV show began as a radio program and carried over onto TV, \"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\" (1948). That same year, he hosted his own variety show, The Morey Amsterdam Show (1948), which ran until 1950. Amsterdam was the host of the talk show Broadway Open House (1950), the precursor to NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" in its various forms. His real fame, though, would come after he had spent almost four decades in the business, playing the part of wisecracking comedy writer \"Buddy Sorrell\" in the classic Dick van Dyke Show (1961) along with Rose Marie and Van Dyke as writers for the fictional TV variety show \"The Alan Brady Show\". For Morey, who was reportedly able to recall up to 100,000 jokes, it was the role of a lifetime. After the show ended in 1966, he continued to play nightclub dates and make TV guest-star appearances on shows from The Hollywood Squares (Daytime) (1965) to Caroline in the City (1995). His film career consisted mainly of small roles in such films as Beach Party (1963) and Won Ton Ton - Der Hund, der Hollywood rettete (1976), although he did produce and star in Don't Worry, We'll Think of a Title (1966) and received good notices for his standout performance as a weaselly, double-crossing gangster who gets his just desserts in the Charles Bronson gangster film Revolver-Kelly (1958).\n\nBeautiful green-eyed Barbara Jeanne Anderson is best remembered on screen as the socialite- turned San Francisco police Officer Eve Whitfield in the first four seasons of the NBC police drama Der Chef (1967), starring Raymond Burr. She was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of an enlisted navy man. In her teens, her family moved to Memphis, Tennesse, following her father's latest posting. Barbara took elocution lessons to overcome, first, her strong Brooklyn accent, and then, her newly-acquired Southern drawl. She attended Memphis State University, took part in amateur dramatics and made her professional acting bow with the Southwestern University Players. In 1963, she was voted \"Miss Memphis\".\n\nHaving relocated to California to further her career prospects, Barbara joined the ensemble of the Los Angeles Art Theatre for two years, acting at night, while making ends meet during the daytime as a phone receptionist and telemarketer. Her career was launched after she was noticed by a talent agent playing the lead role of Cyrenne in a stage production of Rattle of a Simple Man (Diane Cilento played this role in the 1964 film).\n\nSigned to a contract with Universal, Barbara's first acting assignment was an episode of Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962), followed by guest spots in Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) (as Lenore Karidian) and Mannix (1967). She also made her debut as Eve Whitfield in the Ein beinah tödlicher Fall (1967) movie-length TV pilot. Her subsequent role in the series won her a 1968 Primetime Emmy for 'Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Drama'. After she left Ironside in 1971, her spot in the show was taken by Elizabeth Baur for whom a new character, Fran Belding, was created.\n\nBarbara had another recurring role in the final season of Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966) as Mimi Davis, an ex-con and recovering alcoholic who was adept at role play and participated in seven missions for the team. Until the early 80's, she continued to make guest appearances in TV movies and prime time shows like Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969), Hawaii Fünf-Null (1968) and Simon und Simon (1981). In 1993, she returned to the screen one final time to reunite with her fellow cast members for Der Chef kehrt zurück (1993). Ironically, Elizabeth Baur, who had replaced her in the series, also retired after this film. Raymond Burr died just four months after it went to air.\n\nBarbara left show business in 1993 to devote time to family life, to playing tennis, sailing and painting. The actor Don Burnett, her husband since 1971, had likewise retired early and become a successful investment broker.\n\nA bodacious, bedimpled, pert-nosed, well-endowed knockout, Loni Anderson earned an assured television sex symbol pedestal during the late 1970s and early 1980s. As sexy but smart Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), the ravishing star later became a soap-styled fixture in mini-movies. All eyes were peeled on this worthy pin-up who helped to bring back the glossy platinum-blonde allure of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren.\n\nLoni strove for much more than a sex pedestal as she tried to parlay her newly found fame into a viable dramatic career. She met with a measured degree of success as she recreated the lives of such artificial sex sirens as Mansfield and Thelma Todd on television, but got bogged down in television-movie retellings of famous movie classics (Drei Münzen im Brunnen (1954), Du lebst noch 105 Minuten (1948), Todsünde (1945)) that could not help but pale in comparison. This attempt at seriousness was further hampered by messy tabloid headlines in her private life.\n\nLoni Kaye Anderson was born with very dark (jet black) hair on August 5, 1945 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of a chemist. An art student at the University of Minnesota, she entered (and won) beauty contests on the sly (including a Miss Minnesota runner-up placing in 1964). Married and divorced from Bruce Hasselberg before she reached age 21, Loni took on a teaching position to support herself and baby daughter (Deidre) while completing college.\n\nDeveloping an interest in acting, she went the route many aspiring thespians do -- apprenticing in local commercials and theater shows. Still dark-haired, she played in several early 1970s productions such as \"Born Yesterday\" (as Billie Dawn), \"Send Me No Flowers\", \"Can-Can\" and \"The Star-Spangled Girl\". She even played Tzeitel in \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and appeared in a production of \"The Threepenny Opera\".\n\nRemarried in 1973 to actor, Ross Bickell, the couple decided to move away from Minnesota to Los Angeles in 1975 and actively pursue film and television work. Pounding the proverbial pavement, she eventually went blonde and this, plus her gorgeous looks, helped her to secure minor but sexy roles on such series as Die knallharten Fünf (1975), Make-Up und Pistolen (1974), Barnaby Jones (1973), The Bob Newhart Show (1972) and Herzbube mit zwei Damen (1976). By the time she nabbed the role of Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), she had grown quite admirably as an actress.\n\nLoni and Howard Hesseman became the breakaway stars of the sitcom and Loni skyrocketed to sexy status, earning two Emmy nominations in the process. On the other hand, her instant fame led to the breakup of her second marriage to Bickell in 1981. Loni found hit-and-miss success outside the parameters of her comedy series. She was front-and-center in a number of television-movies, notably playing tragic Hollywood sex sirens Jayne Mansfield in Die Jayne Mansfield Story (1980), opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger as her muscle-bound husband Mickey Hargitay, and Thelma Todd, in White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd (1991), whose untimely death in 1935 is still questioned.\n\nLoni also appeared lusciously alongside Bob Hope, brightening up several of his classic television specials. On the minus side, she fizzled in her teaming up with equally sexy Wonder Woman (1975) star Lynda Carter in the tepid, short-lived series Caulfields Witwen (1984) and then played a former Las Vegas showgirl who inherits a bundle in the sitcom misfire Dieses süße Leben (1986). She also was given a chance to work in feature films such as Der rasende Gockel (1983). While her performance in that movie was panned, it did have her meeting and co-starring opposite mega star Burt Reynolds.\n\nAppearing in routine, mini-movie soap operas (via her own production company), if anything, kept Loni in the public eye as a serious-minded actress, but it was an uphill battle to rise above her manufactured image as a fantasy bombshell. Not helping things was her high-profile marriage to Reynolds in 1988, which began blissfully enough (and produced adopted son Quinton), then dissolved quickly into a nasty divorce in 1993 that damaged the reputations of both stars.\n\nIn later years, Loni showed incredible perseverance. As always, the stalwart beauty continued to play up the glam but has since downplayed the dramatics. She seems more focused these days on having innocuous fun, playing a number of hearty vixens in sitcoms and series guest spots. Over time, she has enjoyed such lightweight sitcoms as her regular role in Hallo Schwester! (1991), and as a guest in such sitcoms as The New WKRP in Cincinnati (1991) (in which she recreated her role as Jennifer Marlowe), Harry's Nest (1988), Sabrina - total verhext (1996) and Clueless: Die wichtigen dinge des lebens (1996). Her last movie was the SNT-based comedy movie A Night at the Roxbury (1998).\n\nMillennium television credits include the sitcom The Mullets (2003) and as Tori Spelling's materialistic mother in Tori Spelling in: So NoTORIous (2006), which did not get the seal of approval from Tori's real-life mother. Loni has more recently starred in the resurrected comedy series My Sister Is So Gay (2016). In 2008, she married a fourth time to musician Bob Flick. Loni's autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels\", was published in 1997."
