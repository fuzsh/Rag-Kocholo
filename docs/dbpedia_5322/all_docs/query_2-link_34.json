        "text": "Disponible en: Español\n\nThe competition recognizes the vision, ingenuity, and talent of creative teens. Notable alumni of Scholastic Art and Writing Awards are Stephen King, Sylvia Plath, Robert Redford, Truman Capote, Andy Warhol, Ken Burns, Joyce Carol Oates, Cy Twombly, Marc Brown, Richard Linklater, Zac Posen, and Amanda Gorman.\n\nHarris County Department of Education (HCDE) recently announced the teens for the 2022 Regional Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. Four Aldine ISD students — Jade Jiménez, Aimee Mahindaratne, Shonease Murphy, and Danna Santamaría — earned Gold Keys in Art, with Danna earning two Gold Keys for two different pieces. Additionally, 23 received Silver Keys, with two of those students earning two Silvers for different artworks. The awards in the writing competition will be announced later in January.\n\nHCDE annually sponsors the regional Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. School districts, private schools, and home schools are represented as students earning Gold Key, Silver Key, and honorable mention awards. Each year, students submit their work through teachers who support and participate in HCDE’s regional competition. Several hundred volunteer art and writing professionals judge the submissions.\n\nAll Scholastic Art and Writing competition entries are considered for multiple awards, with the Gold Key being the pinnacle award. These awards are presented to students during celebration ceremonies and exhibitions in each region of the state. Jurors look for work that exemplifies the Awards’ core values: originality, technical skill, and the emergence of a personal voice or vision.\n\nThe regional Gold Key entries are automatically considered for national awards in New York City, where world-renowned creative professionals will judge them. Entries are selected for awards without knowledge of the student’s gender, age, ethnicity, or hometown by some of the foremost visual and literary arts leaders. Many Scholastic Awards alumni have lent their expertise as jurors, including Michael Bierut, Philip Pearlstein, Edward Sorel, Red Grooms, and Gary Panter. Other luminaries who have served as judges include Langston Hughes, Robert Frost, Judy Blume, Billy Collins, Paul Giamatti, Francine Prose, Edwidge Danticat, David Sedaris, Lesley Stahl, Nikki Giovanni, Roz Chast, Wangechi Mutu, Andres Serrano, Kiki Smith, Jill Kraus, Shinique Smith, Rashid Johnson, and Waris Ahluwalia.\n\nThe national winners will be announced in March and awarded in June at a ceremony at Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe Scholastic Art & Writing Awards is the nation’s longest-running prestigious recognition program for creative teens. The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards were founded in 1923 and, for nearly a century, have inspired bold ideas in creative teens throughout the country. Notable Alumni include Stephen King, Dan Fogelberg, Sylvia Plath, Robert Redford, Truman Capote, Andy Warhol, Joyce Carol Oates, Marc Brown, Jaida Jones, and Amanda Gorman. They all earned awards as Scholastic Art & Writing Awards as teens.\n\nGold Keys Represent the Top 5 Percent of Entries\n\nIn the 2022 art categories, Aldine ISD students earned five Gold Keys, 25 Silver Keys, and 39 Honorable Mention awards.\n\nTo view all the regional award recipients and information about receptions and award ceremonies, visit the HCDE website.
