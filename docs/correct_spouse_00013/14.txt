The family of Brittany Murphy’s husband, Simon Monjack isn’t happy about his portryal in HBO Max’s new documentary, What Happened, Brittany Murphy?

According to TMZ, Monjack’s brother, James was interviewed for the film and says he feels fooled by the whole enterprise, particularly since he thinks the doc characterizes Simon as a monster. The two-part show looks into the actress’ death and the moments leading up to it—particularly her marriage to Simon, who died five months after Murphy in 2009.

Both the late actress and Monjack died in the same home, and under the same cause of death: pneumonia and drug intoxication, which led to speculation about the factors involved in her passing. Above all though, the documentary doesn’t paint a good portrayal of Monjack, showing him to be a controlling husband who was after her money and isolated her from her family and friends – and even stopped her from seeking medical attention.

TMZ writes that James was “disappointed” in their depiction of Simon, saying the project was presented to him as an investigative journalism piece about the couple’s death. James and Simon’s mother was also interviewed for the doc.

Both James and his mom were hoping that the probe would unearth some more information about what exactly happened to Simon and Murphy.

What Happened, Brittany Murphy? is now streaming on HBO Max.
