        "text": "The husband of Brittany Murphy was found dead at his Los Angeles home late on Sunday, five months after the Hollywood actress died, US police said.\n\nThe body of British screenwriter Simon Monjack was found late on Sunday night at his residence in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nPrescription drugs were found close to Monjack's body.\n\nLos Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said: \"There were some prescription drugs found that belonged to Mr Monjack, and we'll have an ongoing investigation.\n\n\"Cause of death is pending, and there will be an autopsy after a day or so, and pending toxicology reports, we'll be releasing the results after we get all those tests back.\n\n\"The family is devastated at this time, and it is under investigation.\"\n\nAccording to the coroner, Monjack’s body was found in the master bedroom and there \"were no illicit drugs on location – just prescription medications\", though he declined to say what they were.\n\nMonjack's death will not be investigated by police as there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his passing.\n\nSergeant Louie Lozano told RadarOnline.com: \"The preliminary cause of death for Mr Monjack seems to be natural causes. No weapons were found at the scene.\n\n\"LAPD will not be involved in the investigation, since there was no indication of foul play or criminal activity.\"\n\nThe preliminary cause of death is natural causes, he told The Associated Press.\n\nSergeant Lozano said investigators couldn't provide more details on the 39-year-old Monjack's death.\n\n\"They're conducting the investigation and they have not relayed any more information back to us yet,\" he said.\n\nAt his wife's funeral in December, a visibly emotional Monjack talked about their relationship and called her his best friend and soul mate. The two married in 2007.\n\nHe said a month after his wife's death that the two had been planning a family and contemplating a move to New York.\n\nMurphy died on December 20, aged 32, after collapsing in her home. The Los Angeles County coroner's office concluded Murphy's death was accidental, but likely preventable.\n\nThe coroner's report said that the medications found in her system were consistent with treatment of a cold or respiratory infection. Monjack and Murphy's mother had reported the actress was ill with flu-like symptoms in the days before her death.\n\nAn autopsy found no evidence that Murphy abused drugs. Investigators found numerous prescription medications in the actress' home."
