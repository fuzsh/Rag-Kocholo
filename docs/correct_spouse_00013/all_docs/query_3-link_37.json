        "text": "Screenwriter Simon Monjack - the widower of late Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy - was found dead last night.\n\nSergeant Louie Lozano, of the Los Angeles Police Department, is reported as saying he died of natural causes.\n\nHis mother, Linda Monjack, of Elm Lane in Bourne End, heard the news at 7am this morning and said the 40-year-old died of a heart attack.\n\nThe hypnotherapist was boarding a flight to LA this afternoon and told the Bucks Free Press she was \"totally gutted and cried all the way here [to the airport]\".\n\nShe added: \"I've lost my son and my daughter in law in the space of five months...I am going to bury my eldest son.\"\n\nMiss Murphy died on December 20 after collapsing at home.\n\nA coroner found the Clueless and Sin City star died from pneumonia, but iron-deficiency anaemia and prescription drug intoxication were secondary factors.\n\nShe met Mr Monjack, who grew up in Bourne End, in 2006 when auditioning for a film he was producing. They married six months later.\n\nMr Monjack grew up in Bourne End and attended Juniper Hill School, Flackwell Heath and the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe.\n\nIn February, his mother Linda told The Bucks Free Press how Mr Monjack was ‘devastated’ by her death.\n\nThe loss was a ‘double whammy’ as his father William died when he was 15, she said.\n\nMrs Monjack said at the time: “I'm just trying to be there for him. But his Jewish faith is very strong and it's helping him through.”\n\nThe actress starred with Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted and had lead roles in 8 Mile with rapper Eminem in 2002 and Ashton Kutcher in Just Married the following year.\n\nMr Monjack shot his first feature, Two Days, Nine Lives, in Marlow in 2000 and is credited as a writer and producer on Factory Girl, starring Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.\n\nHe told reporters shortly after her death that his wife was a ‘wonderful, precious angel’ and a ‘beautiful woman taken way too young’.\n\nClick the links below for related stories."
