        "text": "One month after Brittany Murphy's death, her husband Simon Monjack said Hollywood contributed to the actress' death.\n\nIn a new interview with Larry King, Monjack and the actress' mother – Sharon Murphy – opened up about their loss.\n\n\"You want to know what broke Brittany Murphy's heart? Hollywood broke Brittany Murphy's heart,\" Monjack told King.\n\nThe full interview with Monjack and Murphy's mother will air on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on January 20.\n\nNot surprisingly, Monjack said he's still having a hard time coping with the loss of his wife, who died on December 20 at age 32.\n\n\"How are you holding up?\" King asked.\n\n\"I don't think I am. I don't think either of us are,\" Monjack replied.\n\n\"No,\" Sharon Murphy added.\n\n\"You wake up in the morning and it's like a rebirth. It's… there's not enough time to… your dreams, be they good or bad, when you wake up and I reach out to touch or hold my wife and she isn't there,\" Monjack continued.\n\nAs previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, Murphy was found unresponsive in the shower of her Hollywood home in the early hours of December 20. She was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA later that day.\n\nBut the actress' mother said she knew she had lost her daughter before emergency personnel broke the sad news.\n\n\"Were you there when they said she didn't make it?\" King asked.\n\n\"Three people came in. Sharon and I were holding each other. And they let us know at the same time that they — that she hadn't made it,\" Monjack revealed.\n\n\"But we knew before that,\" her mother said. \"It was just — you know, you felt her life go out of her.\"\n\nWhile an autopsy was completed in the days following Murphy's death, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office previously released a statement to Access Hollywood noting that the exact cause of the actress' death was being \"deferred pending the receipt of additional toxicological tests and tissue studies.\"\n\nThose results were expected to take at least four to six weeks.\n\nAt the time, Los Angles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told Access Hollywood outside of Murphy's home that the actress died of natural causes and no foul play was suspected.\n\nThe day after her death, Monjack reached out to Access Hollywood to speak about the loss of his wife.\n\n\"My world was destroyed yesterday,\" he told Access at the time.\n\nMurphy and Monjack, a screenwriter, wed in 2007.\n\nMurphy rose to fame after a memorable role in 1995's \"Clueless.\" Her other film credits include \"8 Mile,\" \"Just Married,\" \"Girl, Interrupted,\" \"Sin City\" and \"Riding In Cars With Boys.\"\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Sudden Endings: Stars Who Died Too Soon\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Brittany Murphy's Husband Addresses Drug Rumors\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Access Archives: Brittany Murphy Is An Access 'Producer For A Day' (July 9, 2004)\n\nMORE ACCESS ON THESE TOPICS: Brittany Murphy - Deaths - 'Larry King Live' - TV - Movies"
