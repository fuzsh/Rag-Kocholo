        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The husband of actress Brittany Murphy was found dead Sunday night in the couple’s Hollywood Hills home, according to reports.\n\nJust five months after the death of his wife, British screenwriter Simon Monjack,\n\n39, was pronounced dead after the Los Angeles Fire Department responded\n\nto a medical emergency call at his home Sunday night. Officials\n\nreportedly have ruled out foul play and are looking into Monjack’s\n\nmedical history.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a 911 call for an “unspecified medical aid request” at 9:24 p.m. Sunday.\n\nIn January, Monjack’s mother, Linda Monjack,\n\ntold People.com that her son was “unwell, and the doctors are carrying\n\nout tests. On whether he has a heart problem, it is not really for me\n\nto say, you must ask him, but yes, there have been health problems in\n\nthe past. … He had a slight heart attack a week from Brittany’s death\n\ncoming back from Puerto Rico.”\n\nMurphy, 32, went into cardiac arrest at her home in the Hollywood Hills\n\nin December. The actress, who appeared in such films as “Clueless” and\n\n“8 Mile,” died due to pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple-drug\n\nintoxication. Coroner’s officials said Murphy had gone into sudden\n\ncardiac arrest because of “drug intake,” and her Dec. 20 death was classified as an accident.\n\nThe couple, who married in 2007, had no children.\n\n———\n\n(c) 2010, Los Angeles Times.\n\nVisit the Los Angeles Times on the Internet at http://www.latimes.com/\n\nDistributed by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services."
