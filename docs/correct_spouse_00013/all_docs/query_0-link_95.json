        "text": "LOS ANGELES â€” The husband of Brittany Murphy was found dead at his Los Angeles home late Sunday, five months after the Hollywood actress died, police said.\n\nThe body of British screenwriter Simon Monjack was found late Sunday night at his residence in the Hollywood Hills, police spokesman Sgt. Louie Lozano said.\n\nThe preliminary cause of death is natural causes, he told The Associated Press.\n\nLozano said investigators were still at the scene early Monday and he couldn't provide more details on the 39-year-old Monjack's death.\n\n\"They're conducting the investigation and they have not relayed any more information back to us yet,\" he said.\n\nAt his wife's funeral in December, a visibly emotional Monjack talked about their relationship and called her his best friend and soul mate. The two married in 2007.\n\nHe said a month after his wife's death that the two had been planning a family and contemplating a move to New York.\n\nMurphy died Dec. 20, at age 32 after collapsing in her home. The Los Angeles County coroner's office concluded Murphy's death was accidental, but likely preventable.\n\nThe coroner's report said that the medications found in her system were consistent with treatment of a cold or respiratory infection. Monjack and Murphy's mother had reported the actress was ill with flu-like symptoms in the days before her death.\n\nAn autopsy found no evidence that Murphy abused drugs. Investigators found numerous prescription medications in the actress' home."
