        "text": "BRITTANY Murphy's husband Simon Mojack \"conned\" the actress before her sudden death, according to a new HBO Max documentary.\n\nThe Clueless star was found dead aged just 32 in 2009 after suffering untreated pneumonia, anemia and drug intoxication.\n\nThe new documentary What Happened, Brittany Murphy? delves into the disturbing details of Brittany's final days.\n\nIt covers her relationship with \"disturbed\" husband Simon, 40, who died just five months after her from similar causes.\n\nSimon's former fiancée, Elizabeth Ragsdale claimed the British screenwriter lied to her about who he was, PEOPLE reported.\n\nShe alleged that abandoned her when she moved to New York to be with him while pregnant with his child.\n\nThe docuseries explains how Elizabeth and Simon got engaged after a brief period of dating.\n\nSoon after, Elizabeth got pregnant and Simon insisted she give birth in the US.\n\nHe paid for her plane ticket to New York while she was four months pregnant and said he would meet her there, according to the doc.\n\nElizabeth claimed: \"When I got to my little studio in New York, I called him and he answered. I said, 'Simon, I've made it to ...' and before I could get that sentence out, he hung up on me.\n\n\"He left me pregnant and abandoned.\"\n\nWhat Happened, Brittany Murphy? director Cynthia Hill claimed Brittany was one of Simon's \"last victims\".\n\nShe said: \"He was a disturbed individual who was used to conning people and Brittany was one of his last victims.\n\n\"There was a pattern of behavior that became very obvious the more research that we did.\"\n\nTRAGIC FINAL MONTHS\n\nElsewhere in the series, makeup artist Trista Jordan - who worked with Brittany on her last film, 2009's Something Wicked, reflected on her concerning appearance in her final months.\n\n\"Her eyes were so sunken, and she just seemed so sad,\" Trista said.\n\n\"She wasn't herself. She was in so much pain. She had Bambi legs and couldn't stand up.\"\n\nBrittany was found dead at her home in Los Angeles and Simon died in similar circumstances at the property five months later.\n\nThe Los Angeles Coroner ruled the deaths were due to pneumonia, anemia and drug intoxication due to prescription pills.\n\nTh forensic pathologist who reexamined her death told The Sun that the couple \"slovenly, shoddy existence\" and Brittany was not murdered.\n\nPATHOLOGIST VERDICT\n\nDr Cyril Wecht, who spent months re-looking at the case after he was hired by the star's father, Angelo Bertolotti, insists rumors she was poisoned are not true.\n\nDr Wecht told The Sun exclusively: “I worked on the Brittany Murphy case after the father contacted me and I dealt with it over a long period of time.\n\n“Brittany had severe anemia and suffered from malnutrition. They lived an incredibly slovenly, shoddy existence despite their celebrity and, presumably, their financial means.\n\n\"They were living in a very unhygienic way, almost as if they were impoverished migrants.\"\n\nPOISONING CLAIMS\n\nA report in 2013 found ten heavy metals in Brittany's system which were several times higher than World Health Organization safe levels and could have meant she was poisoned.\n\nBefore his death in 2019, Brittany's dad revealed he had given up on his legal fight against the Los Angeles Coroner's Court to get her body exhumed and find out the true cause of death.\n\nBrittany rose to fame in 90s classic Clueless alongside Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd.\n\nShe also starred alongside Michael Douglas in Don't Say A Word in 2001 and Eminem in 8 Mile, for which she received critical acclaim."
