        "text": "In 2013, Brittany Murphy's father, Angelo Bertolotti, had an independent toxicology analysis performed on Murphy at his request. He maintained doctors found high levels of barium - a chemical used in some rat poisons - in her hair.\n\nBertolotti also argued that chronic arsenic poisoning is often confused as anemia, which Murphy purportedly suffered from at the time of her death. He then pushed for the Los Angeles Police Department to reopen the case, but investigators denied his request. In an interview, Bertolotti proposed his daughter’s death as “definitely a murder situation.”\n\nRumors abounded Murphy's husband, Simon Monjack, had drained his family's money, was a huge womanizer, and was a fraud and criminal. As a result, many in Hollywood described Monjack as \"shady.\" Friends contend he had two warrants for his arrest in Virginia, unpaid legal bills, and a debt of $500,000 to a British investment firm.\n\nAllegedly, Monjack had a serious drug problem, and some of Murphy's friends blame him for exacerbating her own substance abuse issues. Those close to Murphy acknowledged her former heroin and cocaine use.\n\nMonjack died only five months after Murphy, reportedly of pneumonia and anemia. Medical examiners concluded prescription medications exacerbated his condition, identical to Murphy’s autopsy report. According to renowned pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht - who worked on President Kennedy's assassination case - \"[i]t is pretty darned rare\" that both Monjack and Murphy would die of the exact same “natural causes.”\n\nThe LAPD has never officially stated they believe these deaths to be criminal in nature.\n\nFollowing her death, reports surfaced that Murphy was addicted to prescription pills and living as a recluse. Murphy allegedly refused to go to the hospital for various ailments and began self-medicating. Reportedly, Murphy struggled with eating disorders and anemia.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was taking a cocktail of drugs - including anti-depression, anti-anxiety, anti-seizure, and painkiller medications - that doctors theorize caused her body to shut down.\n\nBritney Spears was the previous owner of the nearly 10,000 square foot home where Murphy and her husband died. In June 2003, Spears sold the home where she lived with Justin Timberlake to Murphy for just shy of $3.9 million.\n\nIn 2010, Monjack told the Hollywood Reporter that Murphy had “absolutely hated” the mansion. In recent years, it's undergone extensive renovations and is on the market for over $18 million.\n\nWhen police arrived at the home to investigate Murphy's death, they discovered dozens of prescription pill bottles in the home. Reportedly, investigators removed approximately 90 pill bottles from the bedroom. The bottles were prescribed to Murphy and Monjack, as well as to fake patients. Coroner Ed Winter believes the deaths were “preventable.” Winter then detailed how:\n\nThe problem is Simon would doctor shop and got numerous medications with numerous names and had a problem with prescription meds. Brittany was sick and instead of getting her treatment, Simon and her mother didn't take her to the doctor and used an abundance of over-the-counter meds."
