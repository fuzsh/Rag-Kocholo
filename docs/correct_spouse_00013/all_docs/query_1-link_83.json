His wife, actress\n\n, died in December of the same causes.\n\nMonjack was\n\n, only five months after\n\n. It has been confirmed that Monjack and Murphy both died of natural causes.\n\nAssistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter reported that both Monjack and Murphy's deaths could have been prevented.\n\n\"In simple English â€” they didn't take care of themselves. They didn't seek medical advice from a doctor. Brittany could have survived if she had gone to a hospital and Simon I think could have done the same,\"\n\nWinter told the AP.\n\nMonjack, a screenwriter, and Murphy, known for her roles in films like \"Clueless\" and \"8 Mile,\" were married for only three years before her death."
