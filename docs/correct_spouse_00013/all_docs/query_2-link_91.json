        "text": "Okay, so HBO premiered this 2 part doc series (is it a series if there’s only 2? What’s the minimal number for a series?) a doc duo if you will, about Brittany Murhpy’s death (and life kind of but mostly her death) called, “What Happened, Brittany Murphy?” Each part is two hours. The first part covers her journey into acting, what she was like, etc. etc. The climb, eventually getting to her marriage to Simon Monjack and what a mysterious but also dark and bad figure he was. Then cliffhangers by showing an interview with his mother and brother but ending before they speak. This obviously gives the impression that we’re gonna get some unique insight but when you watch the second part, it never comes. They don’t say much and they certainly don’t offer any insight-it actually seems like they’re lying in some parts after their testimony (?) contradicts what others have said in their interviews. It seems like they just went on to make sure he’s not seen in a bad light (well the mom-the brother didn’t say much but what he did say struck me as honest, he just didn’t have that much info, like all of us).\n\nSo, how to even begin. Usually I say the plot but they really jumped around a lot. I will say it made me feel a LOT of things, mostly negative. I just want to list grievances first before I forget them and then maybe I’ll go back through and reorder or edit if it doesn’t make sense.\n\nSo first, a device the series used OVER and OVER was to play clips from Brittany’s movies as reaction shots to her own trauma as they were revealing it. This seemed…in poor taste. Not only was it kind of manipulative and disrespectful it was often implying how *she* felt about something which felt wildly inappropriate, like they were speaking for her using her own voice? A main concern I had with the doc was this air of pompous certainty it ended on-like that after two hours and whatever research they put in they had figured it out and everyone could stop guessing now.\n\nAnd if you’re like “Why did you feel like that?” Well, they edited a scene from a movie where Brittany shoots herself in the chest and then pleadingly delivers the line, “Why can’t you just let me die?” and then shows shots of all these YouTube bloggers who have been excerpted from throughout who were going over possible theories when this was all happening. Even the title, which isn’t “What Happened to Brittany Murphy?” but a question TO her, “What Happened, Brittany Murphy?” seems to say, she’s the only one who knows and she’s dead so further attempts at knowing are futile.\n\nThere was also how they casually trotted out Perez Hilton, as just another doc interviewee alongside family friends and fellow actors who loved Brittany-without any contextualization about how he not only contributed to the cruel media climate that pushed her into her eating disorder and identity destabilization that made her vulnerable to someone like Simon Monjack who, spoiler, is a controlling narcissist, but honestly spearheaded it and maybe was the loudest voice. I am 32, you cannot give me this internet revisionist history. I would check Perez Hilton and What Would Tyler Durden Do, and they were beyond CRUEL. And I’m glad he’s changed but framing all the harm he did under an umbrella of self-growth and what it meant for him was irresponsible. He had a few lines about, “To me, these celebrities weren’t real people,” and “2009 was a very different time,” but to allow it to exist like that, only in the sphere of his own personal mistakes is both incorrect and irresponsible. I REMEMBER when he got famous himself and then started to be invited to these events and how much he changed his tune when the celebrities started to be people he met and worked with, and then lost a bunch of weight and adopted two little girls with his husband and now his image is all dad stuff but you cannot just erase years of blinding cruelty with some pictures of your cute kids and silence.\n\nThey showed an SNL clip of a Weekend Update mocking Brittany, depicting her as a strung out idiot they same way we saw them do in a Britney Spears doc, and a Lindsay Lohan one. It cannot be overstated how relentlessly and needlessly cruel the world was to women in the entertainment industry at this time. There’s an audio clip from Howard Stern, a person who will never see Heaven, calling Brittany Murphy a “fat pig,”referencing her in Clueless to her then boyfriend Ashton Kutcher and saying she’s been around the block and he should wear a condom because he doesn’t know what she’s got, etc. etc. Does Howard Stern deserve to be shot with a gun? That’s not really for me to say but maybe he does.\n\nThis documentary also acted like it solved all the questions, but two people’s opinions are not incontrovertible proof, which it seemed to be saying. For example, a big question mark for a lot of people is what was the extent of Simon Monjack and Sharon Murphy’s relationship? (Brittany’s mom who LIVED with them the entire time they were married in the same small home). They (Sharon and Simon) did this really gross Larry Kind interview shortly after Brittany’s death where they both come off incredibly creepy and unlikable, and a few more where it’s clear Sharon is completely subservient to Simon. A reporter from People that Monjack was interested in at the time and granted exclusive access to after Brittany’s death commented that the master bed was ‘messed up on both sides’ and it was “clear two people had been sleeping in it” and mentioned it to Simon. He responded, “Sometimes Sharon crawls in bed with me and we just cry together.” They also released these weird photos after Brittany died where they’re standing and Sharon is leaning on him and he is holding a framed photo of Brittany where they look more like parents grieving a child, not a mother and son-in-law.\n\nThe chauffeur/off-duty cop who drove the car that picked Sharon and Simon up after the Larry King interview said the way both of their demeanor changed as soon as they got in the car made him think the interview was a complete hoax. But all of this is supposed to be discredited by a few close friends saying, there was no way they were together, or that they didn’t believe that “for a second.” But one of these people was a publicist they hired together after the death who the filmmakers broke the news to on camera, that Monjack had ANOTHER secret child (he already had one discovered at that point) that the publicist didn’t know about despite working closely with him for years. Also there had been extensive interviews prior establishing what a liar Monjack was to those around him, including women he was engaged to (there were many before Brittany) so the fact that people didn’t know about it doesn’t seem good proof that it wasn’t happening?\n\nI personally don’t think Brittany was poisoned, I think she was in an abusive relationship and was so weak she died from something that shouldn’t have killed her but her body was so compromised it did. Simon’s death is more of a mystery to me (Surprise! He died 6 months after her of the same thing, pneumonia) but I loved the woman who did the autopsy, she struck me as someone very competent if not a little odd (she began her segment by being like, “I love puzzles! And dead bodies are just a puzzle to me.”) and I trusted her integrity and skill to find everything going on that she could have seen.\n\nIf you’re like, how can a ‘healthy’ 32 year old die of pneumonia? I feel like the doc clears up how that can happen by showing the years of abuse her body went through, first from her eating disorder (which has the highest fatality rate of any mental illness on it’s own), then the anemia which makes you incredibly weak, then all the drugs they would do together. A director said that often Simon would keep her up, they would do downers then uppers to stay awake, and order food at 2 or 3:00am just watching TV, every single night and how she never slept and would come to set so tired and out of it her body just could not repair. And the coroner said that if she had gone to the doctor even just a day before she died they would have had her on fluids and gotten her blood transfusions and could have saved her but he didn’t let her go. So to me it makes sense that all that killed her.\n\nThe most telling interviews to me were with Elizabeth Ragsdale, a woman Simon Monjack had a child with prior who he kept a secret. She talks about how he isolated her from her friends and family, and “liked anorexic women,” criticizing her into losing an extreme amount of weight, and was so controlling he wouldn’t let her see a doctor even when she was incredibly sick and emaciated in her first trimester. She talks about a friend who, “is the kind of person who doesn’t take no for an answer,” who FLEW to another country, knocked on the door and said, “If you don’t take her to the doctor right now, I will.” She reflects that this friend saved her life. She also talks about how Monjack after she called him to tell him she gave birth (he insisted the baby be born on American soil so she flew there BY HERSELF to deliver) hung up on her and never responded to any calls again. She said she almost killed herself but didn’t because of the baby.\n\nFriends and colleagues of Brittany’s say that during their relationship and marriage Simon controlled every aspect of her life and career, not giving Brittany access to her own funds, email account, or cell phone. To work with her you had to go through Simon, he was her agent, manager, even makeup artist. Directors tell horror stories of him on set waiting for her in his car so every break she would go sit with him and often come back “incredibly distraught,” and how she would get fired from role after role because no one wanted to work with him and she was so out of it. A few days before her death they flew home from Puerto Rico after Brittany was fired from her role in “The Caller,” a horror movie because Simon assaulted someone on set.\n\nThe devastating thing to me seemed to be that her dad left when she was little and she was a romantic, always looking for a man to fill that role in her life (her mom too). After a few heartbreaks prior to meeting him she was just very vulnerable and primed for a man like this to come in and take over. It’s just so awful because if she had met someone else who wasn’t abusive and narcissistic I think it just as easily could have all been fine. There was just a perfect storm prior and he got to her right at the exact perfect/worst time. The doc lays this out and I agree with this. One of her friends says, “I think there’s a good chance that if she hadn’t met him she’d be alive right now.”\n\nI’m torn about the doc because there’s a lot I learned that I’m glad I learned-so much about her personality and life, but a lot that felt not neutral at all which I think is a documentary’s strongest tool, to present information in a way where it feels like you’re just seeing everything that has happened/unfolded and it speaks for itself in such a way that you can conclude what you think. Or something like 13th, that is clear about the message and presents information as building blocks of an argument. But this, felt gross in a way maybe I’m not fully even able to articulate-like it was itself the authority on this woman’s life and claiming/owning/gatekeeping all understanding of her. So fucking weird. Also to tease Simon’s family like they were some juicy reveal that never came felt so forced and plainly, gross. Like this heartbreaking tragedy is a show you need ratings for. It was so fucking sad. I want to read what other people have said to see if there’s anything I missed I wanna add/touch on.\n\nI guess the final thing I want to say which I mentioned but never explained was that the series used a bunch of footage from YouTube channels at the time, mostly women, who were presenting and going over details of the case (can we even call it that?) but many of these women also seemed to be beauty bloggers and were applying makeup throughout these videos. Now, I know that the world is changing and this seems to be somewhat of an inevitability but perhaps what we can take from this is if your goal is to lament the loss of a person who was not treated with humanity while they were alive, perhaps do not treat their death as content? I’ve seen some reviews that are really critical of this element and true crime as a genre overall.\n\nI think that’s fair, but for me personally-because I do want to know what happened to her and maybe it’s gauche to focus on her death over her accomplishments, but I grew up with her and loved her movies and I wanted to know those things. There seems to be such a rush of biopics of women mistreated in the public eye during this time (Britney Spears, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Monica Lewinsky, Tammy Faye Baker) and I was thinking about what the difference is between one that feels honoring vs. exploitive and I was thinking about Whitney: Can I Be Me (by Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal-hopefully no relation) that made it so much better was you felt like you were hearing her side of it for the first time, what she felt and wanted, from people who knew and loved her. With this documentary there are a scant few of those people but the bulk of the interviews are people who either only knew her in death or were paparazzi and bloggers, not actual friends. So that made the whole thing feel like just another example of someone using her life and legacy for their own gain through speculation which is ultimately how she died so that made it sad and gross instead of feeling like something was set right which you do with some of the others.\n\n3/5 stars, deeply upsetting. (Normally I would end with a recurring joke about if I would or would not masturbate again and I make the unit of rating something relevant to the film but I felt weird doing that for this one so I chose not to)."
