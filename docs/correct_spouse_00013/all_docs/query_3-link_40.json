        "text": "Sad and strange news today: Recently deceased star Brittany Murphy's husband Simon Monjack was just found dead at his home in Los Angeles. According to ABC News, an autopsy has not yet been conducted, but there's no evidence of foul play and for now at least, natural causes seem to be responsible for his death. Still, several news agencies report multiple prescription medications found in his home, and speculate there may be more to this story, especially considering Murphy's death was attributed to \"multiple drug intoxication\" in addition to illness. This just seems unbelievably tragic.\n\nStay In The Know\n\nMarie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
