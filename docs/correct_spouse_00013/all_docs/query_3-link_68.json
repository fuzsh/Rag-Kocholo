        "text": "Brittany Murphy\n\n’s husband,\n\nSimon Monjack\n\n, was found dead (reportedly from natural causes,\n\n) in the Hollywood Hills home he shared with the “Clueless” star, and where\n\n.\n\nMurphy's cause of death was ruled cardiac arrest brought on by pneumonia, anemia and prescription drugs. Monjack, 39, initially blamed the 32-year-old actress' death on a Hollywood studio that dropped Murphy from the \"Happy Feet\" sequel.\n\nThough the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office has already ruled natural causes in the death, law enforcement sources tell TMZ.com that prescription drugs may also have played a role. Monjack was also scheduled for heart bypass surgery in September, according to TMZ.\n\nMurphy’s mother, who discovered her daughter unconscious on the bathroom floor five months ago, found Monjack’s body Sunday night."
