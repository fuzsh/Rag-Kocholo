        "text": "Just one day after the death of Brittany Murphy, her husband Simon Monjack has spoken out exclusively to Access Hollywood about the untimely loss of his wife.\n\n“My world was destroyed yesterday,” an emotional Monjack told Access Hollywood on Monday afternoon.\n\nFollowing the news of the actress’ death at the age of 32 on Sunday, the Hollywood community offered an outpouring of love and condolences for Murphy — and one message, in particular, was very moving to Monjack.\n\n“I loved what Ashton [Kutcher] wrote on Twitter. It was comforting to me,” Monjack told Access Hollywood, adding he did not know his wife’s former “Just Married” co-star personally. “I couldn’t have said it better.”\n\nThe message posted by Kutcher read, “2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany’s family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon. see you on the other side kid.”\n\nAs far as what happened inside the actress’ home early Sunday, when Murphy was found unresponsive in the shower, Monjack said up to that point, it had just been “a regular day.”\n\n“[Her mother] Sharon went into the bathroom because she had been in there a long time. Her mom screamed for me and I ran. Then called 911,” he revealed.\n\nAs previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a 911 call from the home at 8 a.m. on Sunday and eventually transported Murphy to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was pronounced dead at the facility at 10:04 a.m.\n\nWhile LA County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told Access Hollywood the actress’ death “appears to be natural at this time” on Sunday, an autopsy was being conducted on Monday to determine the exact cause of death.\n\nWith regards to the coroner noting she may have suffered from flu-like symptoms in the days leading up to her death, Monjack admitted Murphy had been sick — but it did not seem like it was anything serious.\n\n“She had laryngitis,” he said, noting she had seen a doctor. “She had been tired at the end of the year. She had made a couple movies.”\n\nIn his interview with Access, Monjack — who married Murphy in 2007 — took exception to the idea that his wife may have been linked to people who were bad influences on her.\n\n“I don’t know why anyone would think that,” he said. “She found love. We found love. Brittany didn’t get to where Brittany was with anyone controlling her… Brittany was Brittany.”"
