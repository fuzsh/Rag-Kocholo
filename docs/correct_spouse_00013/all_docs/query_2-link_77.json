        "text": "Brittany Murphy's British mother-in-law has opened up to the Jewish Chronicle about the family's loss.\n\nLinda Monjack, a hypnotherapist and mother of screenwriter Simon Monjack whom Brittany married quickly and quietly two years ago, talked about the complete devastation her son and Brittany's mother, Sharon, are experiencing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He has lost the love of his life. It's very hard for everybody, especially Simon and Brittany's mother,\" she said.\n\nSharon was the one who found Brittany collapsed in the shower and surrounded by vomit Sunday morning.\n\n\"I've spoken to her mother and she is distraught,\" Linda said. \"Brittany was an only child and her mother was living with them.\"\n\nSimon, 39, told 'Access Hollywood' Monday that his world had been destroyed, and his mother said he's still a mess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I was up at two o'clock in the morning talking to him last night,\" Linda said. \"He's not good at all. It's such a shock.\"\n\nSimon is not included in the will Brittany executed before she met him. It leaves the estate to Sharon.\n\nYou can read the whole Jewish Chronicle interview here."
