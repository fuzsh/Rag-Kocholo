        "text": "The British-born husband of late actress Brittany Murphy has been found dead, just five months after he lost his wife.\n\nThe body of screenwriter Simon Monjack was discovered at his Los Angeles home, police said today.\n\nHis death is said to be due to \"natural causes\", and police said there was no sign of foul play.\n\nClueless and 8 Mile star Murphy, 32, died in her husband's arms in December after collapsing in the shower.\n\nAn inquest found she died from pneumonia complicated by an iron deficiency, anaemia and multiple drug intoxication.\n\nShe married Monjack, from north London, in a Jewish ceremony in Los Angeles in May 2007.\n\nPolice spokesman Sergeant Alex Ortiz said: \"We concluded there were no signs of foul play or any criminal activity involved.\"\n\nThe body was found yesterday and police officers were still at the scene today.\n\nThe LA Coroner's Office is taking over the investigation now criminal activity has been ruled out.\n\nEarlier this year Monjack launched a charitable fund - along with Murphy's mother - in the name of his late wife, with an event at which guests were asked to give thousands of dollars.\n\nWithin a few days it emerged that it had not been registered as a not-for-profit body and the Brittany Murphy Foundation offered to refund donors.\n\nMonjack's film credits include the low-budget Two Days, Nine Lives, which he directed, starring Bros's Luke Goss, and more recently Factory Girl starring Sienna Miller.\n\nHe and Murphy - also noted for her roles in Girl Interrupted and the children's animated film Happy Feet - married just months after she ended her engagement to production assistant Joe Macaluso."
