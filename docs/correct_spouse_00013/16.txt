Simon Monjack, the husband of late actress Brittany Murphy has been found dead at his Hollywood Hills home the couple shared in California.

Sergeant Louie Lozano, of the Los Angeles Police Department, told the Los Angeles Times that the body of screenwriter Simon Monjack was discovered at his home in the Hollywood Hills last night.

Sgt Lozano said the cause of death was not yet known and investigating officers were still at the scene.

The report comes five months after the death of his wife.

The Los Angeles County coroner's office ruled that Murphy died of pneumonia complicated by an iron deficiency, anaemia and multiple drug intoxication.

Coroner's officials said the actress had gone into sudden cardiac arrest because of "drug intake" and her death on December 20 was classified as an accident.

Los Angeles police later confirmed the death and said the preliminary cause of death was "natural causes".

Earlier this year Monjack launched a charitable fund - along with Murphy's mother - in the name of his late wife, with an event at which guests were asked to give thousands of dollars.

However within a few days it emerged that it had not been registered as a not-for-profit body and the Brittany Murphy Foundation offered to refund donors.

Monjack's film credits include the low budget Two Days, Nine Lives, which he directed, starring Bros's Luke Goss and more recently Factory Girl starring Sienna Miller.

He and Murphy married just months after she ended her engagement to production assistant Joe Macaluso.
