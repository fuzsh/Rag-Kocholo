Brittany Murphyâ€™s husband Simon Monjack was found dead Sunday night in the same home the actress died in five months ago.

The 39-year-old English screenwriter was pronounced dead by emergency services, who responded to a 9.24 p.m. 911 call from the house.

Sgt. Louie Lozano told the LA Times that detectives were working at the scene.

"They are conducting their investigation. Once we have further information, we will provide it."

The cause of death has not been confirmed but no outward signs of foul play were discovered.

Monjack married Murphy in 2007, and the actress died on December 20, 2009 of pneumonia complicated by an iron deficiency, anemia and multiple drug intoxication.
