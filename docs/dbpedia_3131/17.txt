(1858–1923). English statesman Bonar Law served as prime minister of Great Britain for about seven months in 1922–23. He was the first holder of that office to have been born in a British overseas possession.

Andrew Bonar Law was born on September 16, 1858, in Kingston, New Brunswick, Canada. Beginning at age 12, he was raised by wealthy cousins in Scotland. Law left school when he was 16 years old and eventually became a partner in a Glasgow, Scotland, firm of iron merchants. In 1900 he was elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative. After the former prime minister Arthur James Balfour resigned as Conservative Party leader in 1911, Law was elected to take his place.

In 1915, during the turmoil of World War I, Prime Minister H.H. Asquith formed a coalition government in which Law became secretary for the colonies. After Asquith resigned in December 1916, David Lloyd George became prime minister. In the new coalition, Law was leader of the House of Commons, a member of the war cabinet, and chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he managed war-related programs. In early 1919 he exchanged the chancellorship for the office of lord privy seal. Law remained leader of the Commons until March 1921, when ill health forced him to resign his offices.
