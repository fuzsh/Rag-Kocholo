        "text": "What if Herbert Henry Asquith continued his premiership past 1916?\n\nPOD: Asquith does not consider the sale of captured enemy property in Nigeria to British subjects and neutrals in 1916. Instead, he only allows British subjects to buy the enemy property (which was Edward Carson's proposal IOTL)\n\nEffectively, this nullifies Edward Carson's OTL argument in the Commons and so there is no split in the Conservative Party to shake Andrew Bonar Law's leadership of the party. Therefore, Bonar Law is less receptive to Lloyd George's plan to oust Asquith as he feels more assured of his position in the coalition government. Carson, too, does not join Lloyd George's \"coup\" as he has not challenged Asquith's government as he did IOTL. So, Bonar Law and Asquith carry on as coalition partners whilst Lloyd George and Edward Carson are pushed aside as a duo of \"rabble-rousers\".\n\nHow does the conduct of the war go for Britain? Is defeat slightly more likely because Asquith remains in charge? Could another coup against Asquith occur by the end of the war?\n\nBasically, what happens next?\n\nI would guess that Asquith continuing as Prime Minister would mean that the conduct of the war would go worse for Britain, but the Entente would still win the war though it make take longer.\n\nBut I think a coup against Asquith led by Lloyd George is likely sometime in 1917 or 1918. There is no shortage of books which give a detailed account of the fall of Asquith and his replacement by Lloyd George. They give the impression that it was close to inevitable, if not in December 1916 then only months later. The following quotation is taken from The Political Diaries of C.P. Scott 1911-1928 edited with an introduction and commentary by Trevor Wilson, London: Collins 1970. It is taken from a letter from L.T. Hobhouse [a Liberal academic] to Scott dated 9 December 1916, which was four days after Lloyd George became Prime Minister.\n\nI admit (and I find others who are not Georgian doing likewise) that it is impossible to defend the Asquith government. To go on with it meant certain defeat. Lloyd George I regard as kill or cure. He may land us in even worse disaster, or he may win. The point in his favour is that he will take decisions. The point against him is that he appears to have no grasp of facts, to be incapable of taking account of two aspects of policy at the same time, to be unscrupulous and morally somewhat blunted, and to be incapable of the rudiments of organisation.\n\nI would guess that Asquith continuing as Prime Minister would mean that the conduct of the war would go worse for Britain, but the Entente would still win the war though it make take longer.\n\nBut I think a coup against Asquith led by Lloyd George is likely sometime in 1917 or 1918.

But I can see the British being really tested by the subsequent poor conduct of the military should Asquith have carried on- this is where the greatest effect would have been: the Home Front.\n\nWhat about Bonar Law? Could he be replaced like Asquith? (Given that he has, in this TL, stood by Asquith). I guess Carson would be a likely challenger to Bonar Law's authority- are there any other names that could do so?"
