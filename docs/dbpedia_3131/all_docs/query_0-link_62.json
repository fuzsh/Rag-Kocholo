        "text": "BATH, England â€” After he had been sent by President Franklin Roosevelt as his wartime emissary to London, Harry Hopkins became a friend as well as a colleague of Winston Churchill. When Hopkins's son, Stephen, was killed in the landing on Iwo Jima, Churchill expressed his sympathy. Since this was Churchill, there was no mere letter of condolence but a touch of grandeur, a parchment inscribed with the haunting lines from Macbeth that begin, \"Your son, my lord, has died a soldier's death . . . \"\n\nWhen I was reminded of this story recently, something struck me, a jarring anachronistic note. Not the friendship of two great men nor the hardships of war; it was the fact that one of the most powerful Americans of his age could lose a 19-year-old son serving as a private in the Marines.\n\nNot so today. Even during the Vietnam War there were several dozen sons of senators and congressmen in the armed forces. Now Senator Jim Webb of Virginia is unique on Capitol Hill in having a son serving in Iraq. That is a most ominous change.\n\nNothing was more striking in the first half of the past century than the way in which the richer, educated classes bore their share of the burden of war, or more than their share. Nothing is more striking in the past generation than the way this has ceased to be true.\n\nIn two world wars the rich fought and died for their country in disproportionate numbers: The casualty rate for junior officers in the British Army from 1914 to 1918 was three times as heavy as for privates. Among prime ministers, H. H. Asquith lost a son, and Andrew Bonar Law lost two. The American toll in that war was less grim, although in all the U.S. elections from 1868 to 1900, eight of nine Republican presidential candidates had served as officers in the Civil War.\n\nA contrast indeed to the Republican Party today. The present administration is notoriously composed of men like Vice President Dick Cheney, who had \"other priorities\" when he might have been drafted, or President George W. Bush, who served in the National Guard when it was an acknowledged way of avoiding combat. An examination of the neoconservative elite who dreamed up the Iraq war will yield few with any military experience.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
