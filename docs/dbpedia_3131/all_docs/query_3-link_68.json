        "text": "Andrew Bonar Law was the only Canadian ever to be Prime Minister of Britain. Born in 1858, in New Brunswick, he later moved to Glasgow after the death of his mother. In Scotland, he became involved in the familys iron-working business.\n\nThe Right Honourable\n\nAndrew Bonar Law\n\n1858-1923\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, Andrew Law was elected to the British Parliament. In 1911, he became head of the Conservative Party and after the outbreak of the Great War formed a coalition government with Herbert Asquith.\n\nAndrew Law was a good friend of Sir Robert Borden and he maintained close relations with Canada as Secretary of State for the Colonies. After the 1916 election, that brought in the government of David Lloyd George, Bonar Law was appointed to the higher position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Bonar Law became Prime Minister of Great Britain, briefly and reluctantly, from October 1922 to May 1923, after Lloyd Georges tenure. Andrew Law later died in October 1923. A collection of correspondence from Andrew Bonar Law can be found in the National Archives of Canada.\n\nSOURCE: National Archives of Canada."
