        "text": "So just imagine what it must have been like 100 years ago, as the prime minister of the day Herbert Asquith faced the prospect of Britain at war with Germany.\n\nHH Asquith was prime minister of a coalition government in 1914. Sound familiar?\n\nHe led a Liberal government in coalition with the Irish Parliamentary Party. The Conservatives and their leader Andrew Bonar Law were the main opposition.\n\nThere was an economic and banking crisis. There was pressure for devolution and independence - not for Scotland, the issue was home rule for Ireland.\n\nRemember also that Dublin not Birmingham was Britain's second city then. And our MPs were more concerned about the prospect of civil war in Ireland, than the drum beat to war in continental Europe.\n\nThat all changed when Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, went to the House of Commons on 3 August to warn MPs: if the Kaiser's army swept through Belgium to attack Paris, Britain would be obliged to defend Belgium's neutrality.\n\n\"If Belgium is compelled to submit to allow her neutrality to be violated, of course the situation is clear,\" he told MPs.\n\n\"Their one desire is that they should be left alone and independent.\"\n\nAn MP from Leicester wasn't convinced of the need for war and told him so.\n\nRamsay MacDonald is probably better known now as Labour's first ever prime minister in the government he formed in 1924. He was also one of the country's first ever Labour MPs, elected to represent Leicester in 1906. As war approached, he warned of the dangers.\n\nIn the Commons, Ramsay MacDonald told Sir Edward Grey he wasn't convinced that Britain had to get involved. And that history may eventually agree with him and not Sir Edward and the coalition government.\n\n\"I think the verdict of history will be that they are wrong. We shall see,\" he said.\n\nBritain declared war against Germany 24 hours later. Its ultimatum to the Kaiser's government in Berlin - to pull its troops out of Belgium - had expired at 11pm.\n\nSir Edward Grey, looking out from the windows of the Foreign Office, made his now prophetic warning: \"The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.\"\n\nMobilisation wasn't without its problems. Lord Kitchener needed recruits. The first weekend saw 60,000 recruits sign up."
