        "text": "In this scenario Lloyd George's reputation would be significantly higher than in OTL. I expect Frances Stevenson, his mistress, would be at his funeral, but keep a low profile. I don't know if his wife knew about his relationship with Stevenson.\n\nIn the December 1918 general election there were some constitiencies with both Liberal and Coalition Liberal candidates. But only in St. Pancras South-East did this result in a Conservatives victory, and a Labour victory in no constituency. With no other changes, 162 Liberal MPs would be elected. There would be a Conservative majority in the House of Commons after the general election, as tbere was in OTL. I think there would be a Conservative only government after the election, with Liberal and Labour ministers having resigned.\n\nThere would not be the Carlton Club meeting of Conservative MPs, at which a majprity voted to leave the coaltion. So there would not be a general election in 1922. Bonar Law might call a general election in the spring of 1923 before he resigned as Prime Minister on 23 May. Alternatively the general election might be in December 1923, as in OTL. Labour and Liberals would gain from Conservative, but Liberals would lose seats to Labour. There might be a small net gain in Liberal seats. But I expect the Conservatives would be the largest party in the House of Commons, without an overall majority.\n\nWith Lloyd George dying in September 1918, another Liberal MP would become leader of the party when Asquith resigned in October 1926. Walter Runciman or Sir John Simon, or someone else. Without Lloyd George there would not be Britain's Industrial Future (the 'Yellow Book'), with its radical new proposals to deal with unemployment.\n\nIn this scenario Lloyd George's reputation would be significantly higher than in OTL.

But only in St. Pancras South-East did this result in a Conservatives victory, and a Labour victory in no constituency. With no other changes, 6 162 Liberal MPs would be elected. There would be a Conservative majority in the House of Commons after the general election, as tbere was in OTL. I think there would be a Conservative only government after the election, with Liberal and Labour ministers having resigned.\n\nThat's interesting, I had assumed there would be a greater different in election result without the Coupon.\n\nThere would not be the Carlton Club meeting of Conservative MPs, at which a majprity voted to leave the coaltion.

There might be a small net gain in Liberal seats. But I expect the Conservatives would be the largest party in the House of Commons, without an overall majority.\n\nDepending on the state of the economy I could see a 1922 election. With a Conservative only government the old spectre of tarrifs will rear its ugly head, what Bonar Law does here decides the fate of his ministry IMO.\n\nWith Lloyd George dying in September 1918, another Liberal MP would become leader of the party when Asquith resigned in October 1926. Walter Runciman or Sir John Simon, or someone else. Without Lloyd George there would not be Britain's Industrial Future (the 'Yellow Book'), with its radical new proposals to deal with unemployment.\n\nHere I have no clue. I suppose the new leader could decide whether the Liberals lean left to try and squash Labour or go right to try and win over Conservative voters.\n\nInteresting, why do you reckon this would be done differently ITTL?\n\nIt may not be be a night and day difference but Lloyd George was particularly unwilling to spend money on the military. The economy will still be in trouble and cuts will be sought but probably not with the same zealous fervour as Lloyd George (as PM) and Austen Chamberlain (As Chancellor) had.\n\nHe was the prime mover in the reduction of the naval budget to 17% of its 1918/19 figure. His two populist priorities were tax cuts and state handouts, which he hoped would bribe the electorate sufficiently to keep the Liberals (and implicitly, himself) in power for as long as possible. By creating the conditions which exacerbated the post-war decimation of traditional industries, instead of helping them rebuild and modernise after the absence of the normal cycles of maintenance and re-investment during the war, he indirectly caused the need for welfare to be at a higher level than would have been the case without the 1920s slump. In some cases, governmental intervention directly interfered in the necessary rationalisation and buyouts of inefficient companies by stipulating which ones should merge and forcing a number of small, but profitable, endeavours to be absorbed by a larger, but over-extended, rival.\n\nUnfortunately, the PoD doesn't allow him to be removed before his term as President of the Board of Trade, otherwise many lives may have been spared.\n\nEdit: missing closing parenthesis\n\nTurnout in the 1918 general election was 58.9%. It was below average in London and south-east England, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, east and north Yorkshire, and rural Scotland. It was above average in east Lancashire and west Yorkshire, Glasgow, some constituencies in south west England, South Wales. Among the constituencies with over 70% turnout were Barrow-in-Furness, Blackburn, Darwen, Dumbarton District, Exeter, Lincoln, Merthyr, Preston, Whitehaven. It was above average in most constituencies in the north of Ireland outside Belfast. It was low in some working class seats, but high in others. (1)\n\nThere were 158 Coalition Liberal candidates in the general election, of which 133 were elected. 27 were unopposed. Coalition Liberals won 12 constituencies with majorities over Labour of less than 3,000 and no Conservative candidate. These were all gained by Labour in the 1922 general election. If there were Conservative candidates in these constituencies, and they had gone Labour in 1918, then 149 Liberal and 75 Labour MPs would be elected.\n\nBonar Law resigned as leader of the House of Commons and leader of the leader of the Conservative Party, because of ill health on 21 March 1921. He was succeeded by Austen Chamberlain. If Bonar Law were Prime Minister, I assume he would still resign and Chamberlain would become Prime Minister.\n\nAs regards India, the Government of India Act 1919 provided for a majority of Indians to sit on the Central Legislative Council, and on provincial councils. I assume it would still be enacted by a Conservative government. It was based on the report of Edwin Montagu, India Secretary from July 1917 to March 1922, and Lord Chelmsford, Viceroy of India from 1916 to 1921.\n\nI expect the policy of a Conservative government under Bonar Law as regards Ireland would be the same as the coalition government in OTL. Arthur Balfour collaborated with Lloyd George and Austen Chamberlain in 'drafting the Proposals of the British Government for an Irish Settlement dated 20 July 1921. These offered the status of a Dominion with all the powers and privileges set forth.' However Northern Ireland would be excluded.
