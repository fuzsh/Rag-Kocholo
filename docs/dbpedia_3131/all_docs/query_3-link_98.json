        "text": "The information in this article is part of an upcoming rework, and may not be reflected in other articles.\n\nThe Conservative Government of the United Kingdom, informally known as the Law Ministry was formed on the 14th December 1919 and dissolved on the 6th February 1923. The ministry was formed following the dissolution of the Balfour Interim Ministry, which itself was a continuation of the Lloyd George War Ministry. The Conservative government embarked on a program of austerity and demobilisation at home while intensifying the conflict in Ireland and closer relations with the Dominions.\n\nLaw's government was beset from crisis for much of its time in office, overseeing a period of unprecedented strike action; the ongoing war in Ireland and an economic recession popularly known as the Great Slump. It would later lend its name to the wider time period predating the British Revolution. Seeking to improve Britain's economic fortunes in the face of an insurgent Germany and its newly established economic bloc of Mitteleuropa, Law's government implemented the beginnings protectionist tariffs and sought to establish preferential agreements with the Dominions via the Empire Marketing Board though these bore little effect and contemporary British academics have complained that they harmed the British economy in the long-run. Likewise, the Law Ministry oversaw the implementation of austerity measures instituting higher taxes, cuts to public services and wages and the privatisation of those industries that had been nationalised during the Great War. This kicked off a range of strikes that would blight the administration and ultimately cause its downfall.\n\nFollowing a defeat in the 1922 Miners' Strike, Law and his cabinet learned that further strikes were planned in an attempt to gain higher wages after a slew of pay cuts. The government attempted to politicise the issue and defeat the miners by forcing a general election on the matter of \"ending strife\" after a particularly brutal winter, mired in public discontent. Law called a snap election for 1923 though the government only maintained a plurality and lost its majority. The Liberals and Labour Party voted down joined together to vote down the King's Speech forcing Law to seek resignation creating the fallout of the Curzon Crisis. By the next month, Ramsay MacDonald announced he was prepared to form a Labour government with Liberal backing and as such, the King sent for him. Law dissolved his cabinet and resigned as Prime Minister on the 6th of February, 1923.\n\nCabinet[]\n\n14th December 1919 - 4th January 1923[]\n\nBonar Law – Prime Minister and Leader of the House of Commons\n\nThe Earl of Birkenhead – Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain\n\nArthur Balfour – Lord President of the Council\n\nThe Marquess of Salisbury - Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal\n\nThe Lord Robert Cecil - Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n\nAusten Chamberlain - Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\nThe Earl Curzon of Kedleston – Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House of Lords\n\nThe Viscount Cave – Secretary of State for the Home Department\n\nThe Viscount Milner – Secretary of State for the Colonies\n\nThe Earl Peel – Secretary of State for India\n\nLord Clyde - Secretary of State for Scotland\n\nThe Earl Winterton - Chief Secretary for Ireland\n\nThe Viscount French - Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\n\nArthur Steel-Maitland - President of the Board of Trade\n\nThe Lord Downham – President of the Board of Education\n\nThe Viscount Lee of Fareham – President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries\n\nAuckland Geddes – President of the Local Government Board\n\nRobert Horne – Minister of Labour\n\nEric Geddes - Minister of Transport\n\nWalter Long – First Lord of the Admiralty\n\nThe Earl of Derby – Secretary of State for War\n\nChanges[]\n\nMarch 1920 - Edward Wood succeeds Lord Downham as President of the Board of Education, Viscount Astor succeeds Auckland Geddes as President of the Local Government Board.\n\nApril 1920 - Sir John Gilmour succeeds James Clyde as Secretary for Scotland.\n\nFebruary 1921 - Lord Lee of Fareham (Viscount Lee of Fareham from 9 December 1922) succeeds Walter Long as First Lord of the Admiralty, Arthur Griffith-Bowcasen succeeds Lord Lee of Fareham as President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\nApril 1921 - Sir John French resigns as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and is succeeded by Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, Stanley Baldwin succeeds Arthur Steel-Maitland as President of the Board of Trade.\n\nList of Ministers[]"
