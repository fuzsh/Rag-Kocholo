        "text": "Full Name: Andrew Bonar Law\n\nProfession: British Prime Minister\n\nBiography: Bonar Law was a British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1922 to May 1923. Despite his relatively brief term, he is notable for being the only Prime Minister to have been born outside the British Isles, in New Brunswick, which was then a British colony in North America.\n\nPrior to his premiership, Law held several important positions in the British government. He was Leader of the Conservative Party twice, first from 1911 to 1921 and then again from 1922 to 1923. This political ascent was marked by his instrumental role in the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 and his staunch opposition to Irish Home Rule, which led to a close alliance with Sir Edward Carson and the Ulster Unionists.\n\nDuring World War I, he served in Prime Minister David Lloyd George's war cabinet, initially as Chancellor of the Exchequer and later as Leader of the House of Commons. His tenure as Prime Minister came at a turbulent time in British politics, with the country facing significant economic challenges and political divisions in the aftermath of the war.\n\nLaw's term as Prime Minister ended abruptly due to his declining health. He was diagnosed with throat cancer and resigned in May 1923. He passed away later that year.\n\nBorn: September 16, 1858\n\nBirthplace: Kingston, Colony of New Brunswick, Canada\n\nStar Sign: Virgo\n\nDied: October 30, 1923 (aged 65)\n\nCause of Death: Throat cancer\n\nHistorical Events\n\nConservative Andrew Bonar Law forms government in United Kingdom, replacing David Lloyd George's Liberal government\n\nBritish General Election: Conservative party wins a majority under Andrew Bonar Law\n\nStanley Baldwin succeeds Andrew Bonar Law as British Prime Minister\n\nPersonal Life\n\n56th UK Prime Minister Bonar Law (32) weds Annie Robley at West Free Church in Helensburgh, Scotland\n\nFamous British Prime Ministers"
