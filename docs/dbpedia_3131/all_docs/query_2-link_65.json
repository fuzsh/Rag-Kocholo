        "text": "More than the fascinating story of Asquith's love for Venetia Stanley, these letters provide a rare inside look at British politics. They reveal a statesman faced with political ruin in the Irish civil war who escaped by leading Britain through the crisis of 1914 and the early years of the\n\nwar. Asquith confided completely in Venetia, sharing with her military secrets that were unknown to the Cabinet or to naval and military commanders. He described political intrigues and wrote openly of his colleagues--who include Lloyd George, Churchill, and Kitchener.\n\nFather of Herbert Asquith\n\nBritish politician Herbert Henry Asquith, first earl of Oxford and Asquith, from 1908 as Liberal prime minister to 1916 introduced unemployment insurance and old-age pensions, and supported the Parliament act, which of 1911 established salaries for elected members and restricted the power of veto in the House of Lords.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._A..."
