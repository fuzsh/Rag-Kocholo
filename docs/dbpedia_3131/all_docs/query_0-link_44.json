        "meta_description": "The Liberal Party won the 1906 general election by a landslide. They did so, in part, officially supporting a policy of peaceful foreign and imperial policy, coupled with a reduction in armaments. Eight years later that same Liberal Government, comprising several of the same figures that had been there in 1906, not only introduced the largest Naval Estimates yet seen, but took Great Britain into a major European war. Why did they do this? From 1868 to 1894 the Liberal Party was dominated by o...",

        "text": "5Some Liberals began to question the old, basic assumptions about what Liberalism meant. 'New' or 'Social' Liberalism developed, emphasising the use of the state to alleviate negative social conditions. Several younger prominent Liberals agreed with the intellectual founders of this philosophy – notably John A. Hobson and Leonard Hobhouse – that something needed to be done about social conditions in the country to encourage 'freedom'.\n\nDivision\n\nEntente Cordiale?\n\nPeace at what price?\n\n14However by 1909 the Naval Estimates remained high, the military relationship with France remained strong and a new Entente was signed with the illiberal Russian Empire. Why this continuing march towards militarism?\n\n16The mood in the party then tended towards peace based upon cuts (but not peace at any price). Among the old Liberal Leaguers in the Cabinet though, the attitude was that peace must be allied with the continuation of national security. In 1909 Edward Grey spoke in the House of Commons, defending the controversial heavy rise in the Naval Estimates that year. Grey (and the First Lord of the Admiralty, Reginald McKenna) admitted that the rise was not ideal. Belief in Liberal principles though, to their eyes, did not negate the wider duty to ensure national safety. The situation, Grey informed his audience, was serious:\n\n29 HC Deb 29 March 1909 vol 3 cc61-62, Vote of Censure, 29th March 1909, http://hansard.millbanksystem (...)\n\nNo superiority of the British Navy over the German Navy could ever put us in a position to affect the independence or integrity of Germany, because our Army is not maintained on a scale which, unaided, could do anything on German territory. But if the German Navy were superior to ours, they, maintaining the Army which they do, for us it would not be a question of defeat. Our independence, our very existence, would be at stake.\n\n18The Liberal Leaguers presented a publicly unified and coherent argument – that the national good must come above party political considerations. By contrast their opponents were divided. Few were as committed to peace as to risk Britain's defence. A.J.A Morris, in his Radicalism against War: 1905-14, paints a picture of a sobered group of radicals once Asquith had lain out the potential risks involved during the debates of early 1909. John Ellis, a radical and former minister, recorded that:\n\n31 Diary entry for 16th March 1909, quoted in A.J.A. MORRIS, Radicalism against War, Longman, 1972, p. (...)\n\nAsquith's...admissions as to German accelerations, and our want of knowledge of them, produce[d] the most profound effect. Our men scattered like sheep. I do not think at that moment five Liberals would have voted against increase...The only thing to do was to tide it over.\n\nRight-wing radicals\n\nCampaigning inside and outside Parliament\n\n52 Josiah Wedgwood M.P to the Staffordshire Evening Sentinel (Autumn 1914), quoted in C.V. WEDGWOOD, T (...)\n\nLiberals like myself, love liberty...My political work has all been directed to the securing of economic liberty for the worker. I must now leave that struggle to others and to my children. There is other more elementary and more painful work to be done for liberty. It has to be done. All who think like me ought to take part.\n\nConclusion\n\n24In conclusion then, the anti-armament campaigners lacked all that was necessary for a successful campaign. They had no charismatic, substantial leader around which they could unite. They had no agreement among their wider faction of the Liberal Party as to what position to take on this subject. They were part of a party with its own strong problems in overseeing and scrutinising this particular area of Government business. They were met too by unhelpful circumstance, especially in the aftermath of the 1910 General Elections. That they got as far as they did seems to have been a testimony to the extent to which a desire for peace was still part of Liberal politics."
