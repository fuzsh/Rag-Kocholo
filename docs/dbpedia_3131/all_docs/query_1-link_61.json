Until 5 January 1988, he had been the longest continuously serving Prime Minister in the 20th century.\n\nAs Prime Minister, he led his Liberal party to a series of domestic reforms, including social insurance and the reduction of the power of the House of Lords. He led the nation into the First World War, but a series of military and political crises led to his replacement in late 1916 by David Lloyd George. His falling out with Lloyd George played a major part in the downfall of the Liberal Party.\n\nBefore his term as Prime Minister he served as Home Secretary (1892–95) and as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1905–08). He was known as H. H. Asquith until his elevation to the peerage (1925), when he became Earl of Oxford and Asquith.\n\nAt the time of the 1901 England and Wales Census, Herbert, Margaret, Ellen, and Eliza Asquith were listed as living in Marylebone, London, along with nine servants[1].\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith passed away on 15 Feb 1928 at Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire, England, United Kingdom.
