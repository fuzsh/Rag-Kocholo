The National Library of Australia gratefully acknowledges the contribution of the other foundation AJCP partners, the State Library of New South Wales and The National Archives of the UK, and all other organisations which supported the work of the AJCP, the world's most extensive collaborative copying project, operating from 1948 to 1997.\n\nIntroduction\n\nScope and Contents\n\nCorrespondence with politicians and others on matters including: tariff reform; Imperial defence; representation of the Dominions in London; Irish Home Rule; and the 1915 Dardanelles Campaign.

Both collections were formerly in the Beaverbrook Library and were transferred to the House of Lords Record Office in 1975.\n\nExistence and Location of Copies\n\nThe original AJCP microfilm of the records filmed from this collection is available at the National Library of Australia [https://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn2248304] as well as other institutions holding AJCP microfilm.\n\nFinding-aid Notes\n\nThis finding aid is a revised online version of the original finding aid prepared by the Australian Joint Copying Project (AJCP), published by the National Library of Australia in 2018. The original AJCP finding aids were unpublished typescripts or photocopies available from libraries that held copies of the original microfilm.\n\nDates used in this finding aid refer to the date range of the records selected for filming rather than to the date range of the Series or Files.\n\nThe identifiers used in this finding aid were accurate at the time of filming.
