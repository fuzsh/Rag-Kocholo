        "text": "The End of Britainâ€™s Weeks-Long General Elections\n\nGeneral elections in Britain were once weeks-long affairs of corruption and chaos. The shift to one-day polling was slow.\n\nThe Scandalous Success of the Daily Mail\n\nIn January 1944 the Daily Mail became the first transoceanic newspaper, having transformed the relationship between politics, the press and the people. How powerful is it really?\n\nFirst World War: The Fight on the Home Front\n\nSoldiers on the front line in France and Flanders saw their fight as the only legitimate one. But in Britain, the mobilisation of the domestic workforce was integral to winning the First World War.\n\nHaldane and Asquith\n\nWilliam Verity describes how Haldane and Asquith were close political friends and colleagues from 1882 until Haldane was abruptly dropped from office in 1915.\n\nFrom Gladstone to Asquith: The Late Victorian Pattern of Liberal Leadership\n\nFrom 1868 until 1916, writes Roy Jenkins, in the days of high Imperialism, the Liberal Party held office at Westminster for no less than twenty-five years.\n\nAsquith: A Prime Minister at War\n\nAs a peacetime premier Herbert Asquith was held in high regard, but the First World War undid his reputation. That is an unfair judgment, argues Roland Quinault.\n\nThe Genesis of the Western Front\n\nHow did the Allied Powers become committed to fighting the First World War on the Western Front, so that Germany, until near the end, always held the initative? John Terraine investigates.\n\nThe General Election of 1915\n\nIan Garrett shows that well-informed counter-factual speculation can help us understand better the causes and consequences of what did happen.\n\nThe Decline of the Liberal Party\n\nDavid Powell establishes a clear path through the historiographical maze"
