        "text": "Kamala Harris could have chosen a former fighter pilot and astronaut or even the popular governor of all-important Pennsylvania to be her running mate.\n\nInstead, she went with Tim Walz, a 60-year-old former geography teacher turned Minnesota governor that few Americans could pick out of a line-up.\n\nHis selection over Mark Kelly, the former spaceman, or Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s affable governor, has led to some head-scratching among the Democratic establishment.\n\nParty elders felt Mr Shapiro, who strategists believed could carry Pennsylvania’s 19 critical electoral college votes, was the smartest choice.\n\nA likely explanation for Ms Harris’s decision is a deep-seated fear of alienating the Left, who had championed Mr Walz as the progressives’ pick.\n\nThe party’s core base – young and ethnic minority voters – had shown signs of abandoning the Democrats over Joe Biden’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza and a cost of living crisis.\n\nThere were signs that the party’s apathetic grassroots had become re-energised since Ms Harris had replaced Mr Biden at the top of the Democratic 2024 ticket.\n\nShe did not want to risk losing that momentum by selecting a running mate that could cause a backlash in an election where turnout levels are everything.\n\nAn acrimonious lobbying campaign had highlighted their concerns about Mr Shapiro’s staunch support for Israel, and Mr Kelly’s stance on labour unions.\n\nProgressive activists had honed in on Mr Shapiro’s comments on Israel, even unearthing his decades-old reference to “battle-minded” Palestinians, as they lobbied against his selection.\n\nBy selecting Mr Walz, who has backed calls for a permanent “working” ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war, Ms Harris has avoided making the Middle East conflict a persistent wedge issue.\n\nThe choice has also given liberal voters a candidate to get excited about. As the governor of a blue state, Mr Walz has been well-positioned to deliver on a slate of progressive policies.\n\nHe has signed bills protecting abortion access, expanded background checks for gun sales and legalised recreational marijuana.\n\nWhen Ms Harris unveiled her choice – announced first on Instagram, a favoured platform of young voters – she highlighted Mr Walz’s role serving as “both the football coach and the advisor of the Gay-Straight Alliance” student organisation.\n\nWhite House insiders suggest Ms Harris’s decision was driven as much by personal chemistry as it was by shrewd political calculus.\n\nNow in her fourth year as vice-president, she knows better than anyone the value of a strong relationship between a president and their deputy.\n\nThe 59-year-old presidential candidate is said to have hit it off with Mr Walz when she travelled to his state earlier this year to become the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic.\n\nInsiders say she warmed to his easy-going nature and believes he will be a good governing partner whose past experience in Congress will be vital to maintaining relations with Capitol Hill.\n\nMs Harris may have another motivation too; Mr Walz appears less nakedly ambitious than the top alternative, Mr Shapiro.\n\nDespite being a relative newcomer to national politics, the 51-year-old Pennsylvania governor has already made a name for himself and is widely assumed to have designs on higher office.\n\nDemocrats within his own state including, reportedly, senator John Fetterman, had warned Ms Harris she would be constantly looking over her shoulder with Mr Shapiro waiting in the wings.\n\nAs a former astronaut Mr Kelly’s ability to grab headlines may have posed a constant hazard.\n\nWith his plain-speaking and folksy manner, Mr Walz epitomises the “Midwestern dad” persona, but he is unlikely to outshine Ms Harris. Indeed, just three weeks ago, few Americans would have recognised his name.\n\nBorn in a small town in Nebraska, Mr Walz grew up working on the family farm, raised by a homemaker mother and a public administrator father.\n\nAged 17, he enlisted in the Army National Guard, where he spent two decades, including a deployment overseas after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nHe worked as a geography teacher and American football high school coach, before entering politics with his shock defeat of a six-term incumbent Republican congressman in 2006.\n\nMr Walz survived multiple re-election bids in the typically red district – a testament to his broad appeal – representing the seat in Congress for 12 years.\n\nHe became Minnesota’s governor in 2018 and is currently in his second term.\n\nHis governing record has endeared him to progressives, including the firebrand senator Bernie Sanders, who endorsed him as the candidate who would “speak up” for working people.\n\nDespite his age, the 60-year-old has found fame online with social media clips in which he gently mocks his daughter’s vegetarianism and films himself on rollercoaster rides.\n\nYoung liberals have fondly shared the clips, hailing them as evidence of his authenticity.\n\nIt is his recent online volleys at Donald Trump and the former president’s running mate JD Vance that have proved his most notable contribution, referring to the duo as “weird dudes”, a line of attack that has since gone viral.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has already begun framing Mr Walz as a “far-Left radical”, his personal biography makes that a difficult case to argue.\n\nA gun owner and veteran, Mr Walz has proven appeal among rural and moderate Republicans as well as progressives.\n\nHowever, Mr Walz’s six years in charge of Minnesota does offer some fodder for Republicans, who have already highlighted his passage of a law which requires boys’ school bathrooms to stock period products.\n\nMr Walz was also criticised by Republicans for his handling of the Minneapolis riots in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in the city in 2020.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge facing Mr Walz is his need to introduce himself to a much wider audience as the Democratic vice presidential candidate with less than three months before election day.\n\nA recent NPR/PBS/Marist poll found 71 per cent of American adults did not know him well enough to form an opinion of him.\n\nMs Harris aims to sell Mr Walz to the public with an intensive, five-day, seven-state campaign tour through the critical battlegrounds this week.\n\nFor all of his appeal to progressives, Ms Harris sees far greater electoral advantages to having Mr Walz by her side.\n\nDespite being just six months older than Ms Harris, 59, the white-haired governor evinces a folksy charm that will appeal to Middle America in a way that the California-born Ms Harris cannot.\n\nHer choice of running mate underscores her focus on a path to winning the electoral college that puts a premium on the so-called “blue wall” in the Midwest she believes may represent her best route to the Oval Office."
