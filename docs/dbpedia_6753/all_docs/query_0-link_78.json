        "text": "Mel B says she is \"excited to get the party started\" after it was announced she will switch on this year’s Blackpool Illuminations.\n\nThe Spice Girls singer will make a return to the resort where her career first started - as a 16-year-old dancer in the Mystique show at the Pleasure Beach Resort.\n\n\"To me it was the most glamorous place in the world - the Vegas of Britain,\" she said.\n\nThe free switch-on ceremony will take place on the Tower Festival Headland on 30 August and includes a concert headlined by singer-songwriter Ella Henderson.\n\nMelanie Brown rose to global fame in the 90s as a member of the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Scary Spice.\n\nWith more than 100 million records sold worldwide, they became the best-selling female group of all time.\n\nShe has since gone on to work as a solo singer-songwriter, TV personality and actress.\n\nShe was made an MBE in the 2022 New Year Honours list for her charitable work.\n\nMel said: \"I’m so thrilled to be turning on the Illuminations because Blackpool has played a big part in my life and career.\n\n\"I love the people, the place and of course the fish and chips - with plenty of scraps.\n\n\"I’m really excited to get the party started.\"\n\nCouncil leader Lynn Williams said: \"It will be a pleasure to welcome her back to the resort where she started out on what was to become a stellar career.\n\n\"Not only is she a member of one of the best-known girl groups on the planet, her work with vulnerable women and victims of domestic abuse is exemplary.\"\n\nBlackpool Illuminations will shine from 30 August until 5 January 2025.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
