        "text": "Harry Potter star Tom Felton has landed his next movie role in new horror thriller They Will Kill You.\n\nThe film follows a woman who answers an ad to work as a housekeeper in a mysterious New York high-rise, entering a community that has experienced disappearances and may be in the grip of a Satanic cult.\n\nThey Will Kill You will star Joker's Zazie Beetz as the lead character, with The Hollywood Reporter stating Severance's Patricia Arquette has been cast as head of the apartment block's co-op and Felton is playing a member of the cult.\n\nRelated: Harry Potter's Tom Felton reunites with \"legend\" co-star\n\nThe movie will be directed by No Looking Back's Kirill Sokolov, who wrote the screenplay with Predators' Alex Litvak. It's Andy and Barbara Muschietti are on board as producers.\n\nFelton is perhaps best known for playing Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies, and in more recent years has appeared in the likes of The Flash TV series, Ophelia and 2:22 A Ghost Story on the West End.\n\nEarlier this year, he reunited with on-screen father Jason Isaacs at London's Savoy Hotel, the star sharing a picture of the duo and writing: \"Father & son x.\"\n\nRelated: Harry Potter's Tom Felton reveals he almost had huge twist spoiled for him\n\nMeanwhile, back in 2022, Felton joked to Digital Spy that he would appear with Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe again, on the condition that they could switch their roles.\n\n\"We all talk about doing something again in all different ways,\" he said. \"Daniel and I have often joked about the idea of when we do work together again, he'll be the villain and I'll be the hero.\"\n\nHowever, he added at the time that there were no immediate plans for him and Radcliffe to work together.\n\nThe cast of the movies reunited in early 2022 for the Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts special, including Felton, Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint."
