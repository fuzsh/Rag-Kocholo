        "text": "International performers often visit the UK specifically to take part in the festival, which runs over a 3-week period every August. In this article, we look at how international performers can perform and get paid under the Visitor route.\n\nTip 1: Obtain the correct visa based on your intended activities\n\nA Standard Visitor visa could be right for you, even if you will be receiving payment from your performance(s) at the Fringe. This might come as a surprise as the UK’s default position under the Visitor route is that work of any kind is prohibited, and that visitors cannot be paid from a UK source. There are two key exceptions to this rule that benefit Fringe performers.\n\nException: The Fringe is on the list of Permit-Free Festivals\n\nArtists and entertainers visiting the UK can receive payments for performances for the Fringe because it’s on the list of permit-free festivals. You will need:\n\nA welcome letter from the Fringe Society confirming that your show is registered\n\nA letter from the venue and/or a copy of the venue contract confirming you are performing there\n\nIf you come to the UK as a visitor relying on permit free festival exception, you should get 6 months of temporary permission. Continue reading to make sure that you meet all of the visa requirements.\n\nException: You’re a professional artist or entertainer and have been invited to perform in one or more permitted paid engagements\n\nIf you plan to perform at the Fringe and engage in one or more paid opportunities outside of the festival, the additional non-festival activity must meet the requirements of a Permitted Paid Engagement; known as a PPE for short.\n\nAn individual carrying out a PPE is usually a professional undertaking an activity directly related to their profession. It must be arranged in advance of coming to the UK. You will need:\n\nAn invitation from a UK-based creative organisation, agent, or broadcaster\n\nEvidence of your work such as publicity material, media coverage, reviews or awards\n\nTo declare your PPE at the UK border or declare the PPE on your visa application form (see Tip 3 for more information)\n\nAlthough you will get 6 months permission to enter the UK as a visitor, you must complete your PPE within the first 30 days of arrival.\n\nTip 2: Make sure you meet all of the requirements\n\nYou should check to confirm you meet the other requirements under the Visitor route.\n\nOne of the requirements that often trips up applicants is the role of finances. There is no financial requirement per se, but there is a requirement to show that you are a genuine visitor. You can do this by gathering documents that demonstrate you:\n\nWill leave the UK at the end of your visit.\n\nYou can include evidence of sufficient funds for a return journey or your return flight ticket.\n\nWill not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits or make the UK your main home.\n\nYou can demonstrate this through your family and social ties to your country of residence. You could also include details of your job (or your course if you are studying). Financial evidence such as bank statements, payslips or a letter from your employer could help paint a picture of your life overseas and indicate that you will return to your country of residence after your visit to the UK.\n\nAre genuinely seeking entry for the purpose that is permitted under the visitor visa route.\n\nYou can produce the documents listed under Tip 1.\n\nWill not undertake in any prohibited activities, such as working in the UK (unless permitted).\n\nYou can produce the documents listed under Tip 1.\n\nMust have sufficient funds to cover all reasonable costs in relation to the visit without working or accessing public funds, including the cost of the return or onward journey, any costs relating to their dependants, and the cost of planned activities.\n\nYou can submit bank statements to show evidence of funds. Funds must be held in a financial institution that is appropriately regulated and verified by the UK. Be careful when using digital banks.\n\nYou could also include evidence that you have somewhere to stay during your trip, such as a hotel reservation.\n\nFunding from a third party will be closely scrutinised, so you should consider providing robust documentation and supporting letters to demonstrate that the third party is genuine.\n\nTip 3: Make sure you compliantly enter the UK\n\nThere are two compliant ways to enter the UK. How you enter depends on your nationality. Anyone engaging in a PPE must be age 18 or over when they enter.\n\nRequest permission to enter at the UK border\n\nNon-visa nationals are individuals from countries like the USA, Canada and Europe. Non-visa nationals can arrive at the UK border without a visa.\n\nNon-visa nationals who will enter the UK as standard visitors only to undertake paid performances at the Fringe are able to enter the UK using the passport eGates where eligible, ensuring evidence is retained of the date of entry to the UK, e.g. a boarding pass confirming travel details.\n\nPPE visitors must join the queue on arrival at the UK border to see a border officer in person. You should carry your supporting documents in your hand luggage. Then, if questioned, you can present the documents to demonstrate how the requirements are met. For this reason, you may prefer to carry a ‘comfort letter’ setting out the details. The border officer will stamp your passport to confirm the PPE activity is authorised.\n\nIf you bypass the in-person check and instead use the passport eGates, your PPE will not be authorised. If this happens and you carry out the PPE anyway, you risk working illegally (more on this below).\n\nApply in advance for a visa\n\nVisa nationals are individuals from countries like China, India and Zimbabwe. Visa nationals must apply for a visa in advance of travel. This means completing an online visa application form, attending an appointment and getting a visa sticker placed in a passport. You should consider the timing of your application and if needed, check if expedited visa processing is available. When you arrive in the UK, you will see a UK border officer and get a stamp in your passport.\n\nIf a non-visa national has criminal convictions, prior immigration refusals or other issues that could risk resulting in a refusal of entry at the UK border, you may wish to apply in advance.\n\nOther important points to note\n\nYou must comply with visa restrictions and conditions throughout your stay\n\nIf you are found to be working illegally, e.g. undertaking alternative or additional paid or unpaid work, you risk a fine of up to £60,000. If you work in the knowledge that your activities are not permitted, you risk criminal prosecution. Compliance also has a part to play in any future immigration application you make.\n\nA different immigration route could be more suitable for your circumstances\n\nCreatives can fit into other immigration routes too such as the Creative Worker route.\n\nThe Creative Worker route may be suitable for those coming to the UK on a temporary basis in a specific creative role, such as a touring artist or an actor, as well as crew or other technical staff. The role must be paid at or above National Minimum Wage. Applicants need a sponsor who will issue a Certificate of Sponsorship.\n\nLewis Silkin holds an A-rated sponsor licence to sponsor Creative Workers. This means that we can sponsor the creative talent, even though we do not directly employ the worker.\n\nUpcoming changes are scheduled in 2024 that impact non-visa nationals\n\nUKVI are rolling out an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA). It operates in a similar way to the USA’s ESTA. There are certain circumstances where you do not need to obtain an ETA, for example if you’re British or if you have a visa already. Non-visa nationals must apply for an ETA in advance of UK arrival.\n\nAn ETA costs GBP 10 and lasts for two years (or the expiry date of the person’s passport, if earlier). They must be applied for before travelling to the UK and are usually processed within three working days. A new ETA will be required when a person is issued with a new passport. Travelling to the UK while waiting for a decision is allowed.\n\nAt the time of writing, the ETA applies to the Gulf countries and Jordan. It should be rolled out to the rest of the world in Autumn 2024 with the precise date yet to be confirmed."
