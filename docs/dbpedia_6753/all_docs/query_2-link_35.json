        "text": "Biopics, or biographical films, play a significant role in storytelling and cultural representation.

Biopics capture significant achievements, challenges, and personal aspects of political leaders, musicians, artists, athletes, and scientists. Biopics can be informative and entertaining, shedding light on the complexities of real-life personalities.

I worked on my character’s intentions, motivations, obstacles to build an arc, I asked my dad (retired General in Colombia’s Military) so many questions about that world and all of that helped me find the essence of Dixon, who is a very different persona from myself.”\n\nHeader image via Netflix.\n\nDavid Oyelowo, Selma (2014)\n\nDirected by the iconic Ava DuVernay, Selma follows Martin Luther King Jr.’s campaign to secure equal voting rights.
