        "text": "How do I become a line producer?\n\nLine producers generally start as runners or trainees in the production office and work their way up to becoming production coordinators and then line producers. Some become assistant directors, location managers or accountants before becoming line producers, but there’s no set route. Go to our separate production trainee job profile for more detail on getting started. ScreenSkills' Trainee Finder will help you make connections in the industry. There’s a shortage of line producers, so if you’re good, you should be able to find work.\n\nAt school or college:\n\nIf you want to go to university, A-levels or Highers in film studies, media or art and design are relevant. As it’s a role that combines understanding film production with project management and accounting, subjects that develop your skills in that way are useful too. Combine film studies with business or business studies and maths for a well-rounded skillset. Or you might want to take the following Level 3 vocational qualifications:\n\nOCR Technical Diploma/Extended Diploma in Business\n\nBTEC National Diploma/Extended Diploma in Business\n\nIf you want to go straight into a job or apprenticeship, the following Level 3 vocational qualifications will equip you:\n\nAAT Advanced Diploma in Accounting\n\nDiploma in Production Accounting for Film and Television\n\nIAO Diploma in Accounting\n\nOCR Cambridge Technical Diploma in Art and Design (Photography)\n\nOCR Technical Diploma in Digital Media (Moving Image and Audio Production)\n\nBTEC National Diploma in Film and Television Production\n\nBTEC National Diploma in Photography\n\nGet an apprenticeship:\n\nAn apprenticeship is a job with training, so it’s a great opportunity to earn as you learn. You might be able to find a production manager apprenticeship, but it can be challenging to find apprenticeships within production companies. It might be worth looking for a job as an apprentice in an industry that uses similar skills such as project management, business or accountancy. You can then transfer into production management at a later point, so long as you keep up your interest in film and TV drama and develop your contacts. Check out What’s an apprenticeship? to learn more about apprenticeships and find an apprenticeship to learn how to find one in your region, or approach companies directly. Go to ScreenSkills information on apprenticeships for the main apprenticeship schemes in film and television\n\nGet a degree:\n\nIt’s not essential by any means, but you can have a look at ScreenSkills’ list of recommended courses and select one in film and TV. We recognise courses with our ScreenSkills Select award where they offer training in the relevant software, dedicated time to building a portfolio and have strong links with the film and TV industries.\n\nGet project management experience:\n\nWhile you are trying to break into film or TV drama, get management or project management experience. Any job that involves planning, organising and budgeting will help equip you for the role.\n\nBecome a production account:\n\nIf you have a background in accountancy, try to become a production accountant or accounts trainee. It will be a very good route into line production.\n\nBecome a locations trainee:\n\nMany people get into line production having first worked in locations. Go to the locations trainee profile to find out more.\n\nGet qualifications in first aid or health and safety:\n\nIt will help.\n\nNetwork:\n\nGo to ScreenSkills’ events like Open Doors to meet people working in development departments. Give people in the production department your contact details and ask if you can do work experience. Go to how to network well for some tips.\n\nNetwork online:\n\nCreate a LinkedIn profile. See if there are Facebook pages or other social media groups for people making films or TV in your area. There might even be groups for runners and trainees. Join them. Create a ScreenSkills profile. There are a lot of crewing agencies that will charge you to be on their books. Sign up to the free ones initially. Wales Screen, Northern Ireland Screen and other areas offer free crew databases. Find a film office near you and get connected. If you do sign up to paid sites, make sure they specialise in the areas in which you’re interested.\n\nBecome a trainee:\n\nGet onto ScreenSkills’ Trainee Finder scheme. Get the skills, make contacts and start working as a production trainee.\n\nYou might also be interested in…\n\nWorking in production management in commercials, music videos or animation. Build up your skills whatever way you can. Alternatively, you could consider being a line producer in the unscripted TV industry.\n\nFurther resources"
