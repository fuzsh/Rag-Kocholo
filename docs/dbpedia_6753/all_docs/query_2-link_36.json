        "text": "The best way to know about someone famous is if a movie was made about them. Over the years, we've seen multiple films depicting real-life personalities because sometimes, seeing their story through the lens can give us a deeper understanding of them.\n\nCheck out the best TV shows to watch on Netflix this month\n\nFilmmakers have tried (and also failed) to make several biopics that turned out to be some of the best movies ever made. However, since it is a movie, certain elements can be changed to make it more cinematic. These changes can be minor, but it sometimes alters the story to create a factual account that seems irrelevant.\n\nAs awards season has officially begun, we've curated some of the best award-winning biopics we've seen over the years, so read on!\n\nSchindler's List\n\nThe movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German member of the Nazi party that tried to save his Jewish employees from the Holocaust. Steven Spielberg directs this award-winning movie and showcases the most realistic depiction of one of the darkest moments in human history. Winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher directs this movie about Facebook. It might not be interesting at first, but as it's now considered to be one of his best movies, it takes a look at the early days of Facebook as well as one of its co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and how he brought up one of the largest social media sites in history. Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nMolly's Game\n\nThis crime drama centres on Molly Bloom, who became the subject of an FBI investigation after she becomes entangled in the underground poker empire. The problem is she wasn't just part of it. She started it. She begins to fear for her life when she unwittingly takes in players from the Russian mafia. Screenwriter Aaron Zorkin wrote the script and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nDirected by Danny Boyle, this film chronicles the Apple co-founder in different periods as he prepares for significant product launches. He also struggles to deal with personal issues between those occasions, including his daughter Lisa, his estranged wife Chrisann and his marketing executive Joanna. Nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe Favourite\n\nWhen Queen Anne of England falls sick, it is up to her close aide Sarah to take care of her while she recovers. As Sarah oversees the Queen's tasks, she soon meets her cousin Abigail who starts serving the queen. The two of them soon starts fighting for the queen's attention, often leading to disastrous and scandalous results. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress (Oliva Colman).\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThis historical epic depicts the story of British Army Colonel T. E. Lawrence, also known as Lawrence of Arabia, during his experiences in Hejaz and Greater Syria during World War I. Considered one of the greatest movies ever made, the movie shows Lawrence's struggles with war and violence and his allegiance between his native Britain and his newfound friends living in the Arabian desert. Winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nKing Richard\n\nVenus and Serena Williams are the biggest names in tennis today, but their story to fame comes with its struggles and obstacles. Critically acclaimed when released last November, the movie looks at the two sisters growing up under their father's coaching, Richard Williams, played by Will Smith, nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nThe Irishman\n\nMartin Scorsese directs another epic crime drama starring some Hollywood heavyweights, including Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. It tells the story of Frank Sheeran, who becomes involved with a mobster and other prominent mafias. Nominated for ten Academy Awards.\n\nRaging Bull\n\nBased on the memoir by Jake LaMotta, this film depicts the boxer's self-destructive downturn.
