        "text": "The Documentary Edit and Story Lab supports filmmakers with nonfiction feature films in post-production. Lab fellows advance their projects through rigorous creative exploration and discussion of story structure and character development. Filmmaking teams work closely with director and editor advisors and staff in a dynamic and supportive environment; after the lab, they receive ongoing creative and strategic support.\n\nThe Documentary Edit and Story Lab is rooted in the belief that nonfiction editing is an art, not just a technical craft, and that the director-editor relationship is a core tenet of nonfiction storytelling.\n\nThe lab is an eight-day residential retreat held annually in June at the Sundance Mountain Resort near Provo, Utah. Director-editor teams attend the lab together and have access to all of their media on site. Over the course of the Lab fellows screen their rough cuts for the group and meet regularly with creative advisors and staff in small groups. Throughout the week, creative advisors also give presentations on the art and craft of editing and directing nonfiction features.\n\nPast fellows include Eddie Martinez (The Monster & the Storm), Jennifer Brea (Unrest), Garrett Bradley (Time), Loira Limbal (Through the Night), and Petra Costa (The Edge of Democracy).\n\nPrevious Documentary Edit and Story Lab advisors include editors Victoria Chalk (Call Her Ganda), Andrea Chignoli (Cielo, No) and directors Laura Poitras (All The Beauty and the Bloodshed), Nanfu Wang (One Child Nation), Robb Moss (The Same River Twice, Containment), and Margaret Brown (Descendant).\n\nEligibility\n\nThe lab is open to feature nonfiction projects in mid- to late post-production (from assembly through rough cut). There is no restriction of genre or storytelling style — we are looking for projects with a bold, contemporary vision made by courageous storytellers. First-time feature directors as well as mid-career artists are encouraged to apply.\n\nTo take best advantage of the lab, teams should be at a place in their edit at which creative exploration with trusted advisors will advance their project and bring a greater clarity of vision. Ideal candidates are directors and editors who are eager to engage in a collaborative, exploratory environment, and are receptive to feedback and experimentation. Projects that are far along in the edit, or for whom creative input and exploration would be detrimental to the creative process, are not ideal candidates. Ideally, projects should have an editor attached at the time of application and should attend the lab as a director-editor team. (Projects for which the director is also the editor will also be considered.)\n\nSelection Process & Work Sample\n\nProjects are considered in two stages. Applicants may receive emails from DFP staff with clarifying questions throughout the process. If a project advances to the second round of consideration, story and visual sample updates will be solicited at that time. Lab finalists will also be interviewed via Zoom (director and editor teams are welcome to participate in finalist interviews). Four projects will be invited to the lab by mid-May 2023. All applicants will be notified of their status at the same time.\n\nThe application for the 2024 Documentary Film Producers Track is now closed.\n\nApplicants to the Documentary Film Producers Track will be considered for the Producers Lab and Fellowship (yearlong program, commencing June 2024) by invitation only. If you meet the application requirements and are interested in applying to the Lab, please contact docproducers@sundance.org for further information.\n\nThe 2024 – 2025 Documentary Producers Lab and Fellowship is a yearlong program designed to nurture emerging producers with project-specific support through the Producers Lab, year-round mentorship from a dedicated industry mentor, film industry networking opportunities, professional development and project advancement strategy workshops, and ongoing support from Sundance Institute staff. The program is designed to hone emerging producers’ creative instincts and evolve their communication and problem-solving skills at all stages of their next feature film.\n\nFor three years (2021-2023), we piloted a Producers Intensive to broaden our support for emerging independent feature film producers. This pilot has ended and we will not be hosting a Producers Intensive in 2024, though we are exploring future iterations of this program.\n\nThere is a separate Producers Track application for producers working on a scripted fiction feature film. More information can be found about support for fiction projects on the Producers Program page.\n\nApplication Open: Wednesday, October 25, 2023, 9 a.m. PT\n\nApplication Deadline: Wednesday, January 3, 2024, 5pm PT\n\nLearn More Here\n\nProducers Lab Dates: June 10-15, 2024\n\nNumber of Fellows: Five\n\nLocation: UCross Foundation in Clearmont, Wyoming\n\nEligibility\n\nCandidates are required to have produced or co-produced at least one documentary short (experience as an executive producer only does not qualify). Candidates must be lead producer on the project they are applying with.\n\nCandidates should not be the director of their submitted project.\n\nCandidates must have a director attached to the submitted project.\n\nCandidates’ submitted project must be for a feature-length format; no series work accepted at this time. (Note: Nonfiction series projects are considered through the Episodic Lab. For more information, visit the program’s page here.)\n\nCandidates must be in active production or post-production on the submitted project.\n\nCandidates must live in the United States, though the project may be filmed outside of the country.\n\nCandidates must be able to attend all fellowship events, as listed above.\n\nCosts\n\nThe Sundance Institute will provide round-trip economy travel, ground transfer in Utah, and lodging for the selected fellows for the specific dates of attendance at the Producers Lab and Producers Summit.\n\nDeliverables\n\nFellows are required to acknowledge the Sundance Institute and the Producers Initiative support verbally where possible as well as within the end credits of the supported project. Fellows will provide reporting at the close of the fellowship. Fellows should be willing to give back to the Sundance Institute’s creative community through participation in panels and labs, and possible peer-to-peer mentorship. Accepted fellows must also provide a current producer’s agreement or memo of understanding for the project they have applied with.\n\nNOTE: Only one application should be submitted per project. We will consider only the lead producer on the submitted project. If there are additional producers, they must also be disclosed on the application. Additional producers are welcome to select events but do not receive the full benefits of lab participation.\n\nTo be eligible to apply, you may not have any role on the project other than producer.\n\nIf you have further questions after reviewing our 2024 FAQ page, please email us at docproducers@sundance.org with “2024 Documentary Producers Track” in the subject line."
