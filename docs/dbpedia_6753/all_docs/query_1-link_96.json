        "text": "By Commons Librarian, James Whelan\n\nBe inspired!\n\nThese films and documentaries are essential viewing for changemakers and activists. Let us know if you have any suggestions! The films are listed below from A – Z.\n\nFilms and Documentaries\n\nA Force More Powerful\n\nA documentary series on one of the 20th century’s most important and least-known stories: how nonviolent power overcame oppression and authoritarian rule. It includes six cases of movements, and each case is approximately 30 minutes long. (India, USA, South Africa, Denmark, Poland and Chile). The film is available to watch in many different languages.\n\nAbout I Watch\n\nAblaze\n\nAlways was Always Will Be\n\nIn 1989 a dispute over the redevelopment of the Old Swan Brewery on the Sacred Grounds of the Waugul, Kings Park, Perth convulsed the politics of Western Australia. Its lessons are important for all who are concerned about Aboriginal rights and culture, the environment, the progressive role of Trade Unions, the integrity of the Labor Party and the social/spiritual activities of the Churches. Made as a campaign film, Always Was Always Will Be, is a visually rich account of this historically important struggle over a sacred site, giving an insight into the living culture and beliefs of urban Aboriginal people in Western Australia.\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nAmandla! A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony\n\nA 2002 documentary film depicting the struggles of black South Africans against the injustices of Apartheid through the use of music. The film takes its name from the Zulu and Xhosa word amandla, which means power.\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nThe Bentley Effect\n\nWhen the coal seam gas industry staked a claim on the Northern Rivers region of Australia, alarm bells rang out. Thousands of people from all walks of life organised themselves to rally against the unconventional gas invasion. But despite the enormous public opposition, the gas industry and the State Government were determined to see their gas plan through. A series of dramatic blockades ensued before the final battlelines were drawn in the peaceful farming valley of Bentley. A critical mass of people flocked to the site to stare down the threat of 850 riot police, ordered in to break up the protest. What happened next set an historic precedent. Filmed over five years, The Bentley Effect documents the highs and lows of the battle to keep a unique part of Australia gasfield-free. This timely story of a community’s heroic stand shows that peaceful protest and non-violent direct action can not only overcome industrial might and political short-sightedness … but it can also be a lot of fun. This highly acclaimed film chronicles and celebrates one of the fastest growing and most creative social movements we have ever witnessed, posing the question ‘what is truly valuable?’\n\nAbout | Watch | Trailer\n\nBlack Cockatoo Crisis\n\nBlack Cockatoo Crisis is a social impact documentary highlighting the plight of WA’s black cockatoos. It looks at the three species of black cockatoos of Western Australia, who are facing down extinction, and the activists who are trying to save them.\n\nAbout | Watch | Trailer\n\nBlackfish\n\nBlackfish tells the story of Tilikum, a performing killer whale that killed several people while in captivity. Along the way, director-producer Gabriela Cowperthwaite compiles shocking footage and emotional interviews to explore the creature’s extraordinary nature, the species’ cruel treatment in captivity, the lives and losses of the trainers and the pressures brought to bear by the multi-billion dollar sea-park industry. This emotionally wrenching, tautly structured story challenges us to consider our relationship to nature and reveals how little we humans have learned from these highly intelligent and enormously sentient fellow mammals. Blackfish led to great change and is a testament of the power of documentaries. Read about the impact here.\n\nAbout | Watch | Trailer\n\nBread and Roses\n\nThe plot deals with the struggle of poorly paid janitorial workers in Los Angeles and their fight for better working conditions and the right to unionize. It is based on the “Justice for Janitors” campaign of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nBringing Down a Dictator\n\nBringing Down A Dictator is a 56-minute documentary film by Steve York about the nonviolent defeat of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.

Dolores Huerta is among the most important, yet least known, activists in American history. An equal partner in co-founding the first farm workers unions with Cesar Chavez, her enormous contributions have gone largely unrecognized. Dolores tirelessly led the fight for racial and labor justice alongside Chavez, becoming one of the most defiant feminists of the twentieth century—and she continues the fight to this day, at 87. With intimate and unprecedented access to this intensely private mother to eleven, the film reveals the raw, personal stakes involved in committing one’s life to social change. Documentary made in 2017.\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nErin Brockovich\n\nErin, a single mother, becomes a legal assistant and comes across a case against Pacific Gas and Electric.

The fight to prevent the development of the Jabiluka uranium mine was one of the biggest protest movements in Australia’s history and over 600 people were arrested in the process. It took film-maker Pip Starr four years to make this film, including one year spent documenting these historic events.\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nFire Talker: The life and times of Charlie Perkins\n\nFire Talker traces the life of Charlie Perkins from his humble beginnings to becoming one of the most influential Indigenous figures in Australia’s history.\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nFundamental: 5 films about fighting for gender justice and fundamental human rights\n\nWatch 5 short documentaries about courageous leaders who are standing up for gender justice and writing new futures for themselves and their communities.\n\nAbout I Watch\n\nGandhi\n\nA critical masterpiece, GANDHI is an intriguing story about activism, politics, religious tolerance and freedom.

This is the inspirational story of the power of people to change their world, the modern revolution, and the man behind it all.\n\nAbout | Watch\n\nHow to survive a plague\n\nA 2012 American documentary film about the early years of the AIDS epidemic, and the efforts of activist groups ACT UP and TAG.\n\nAbout | Watch [Amazon] | Watch [Apple]\n\nKing: A Film Record…Montgomery to Memphis\n\nConstructed from a wealth of archival footage, KING: A FILMED RECORD…MONTGOMERY TO MEMPHIS is a monumental documentary that follows Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from 1955 to 1968, in his rise from regional activist to world-renowned leader of the Civil Rights movement.

What they encountered along the way showed just how prevalent segregation and injustice existed in Australia. The trip would prove to be a turning point in the Australian civil rights movement.\n\nAbout and Watch [SBS]\n\nMabo\n\nIn 1973 Koiki ‘Eddie’ Mabo was shocked to discover that the ownership of the land his ancestors had passed down on Murray Island in the Torres Strait for over 16 generations, was not legally recognised as theirs. Rather than accept this injustice, he began an epic fight for Australian law to recognise traditional land rights. Eddie never lived to see his land returned to him, but the name Mabo is now known in every household throughout the country. In January 1992, at only 55, Eddie died of cancer. Five months later the High Court overturned the notion of terra nullius. Underscoring this epic battle is Eddie’s relationship with his wife Bonita.\n\nMABO traces Eddie’s life – from a carefree young man of seventeen, through his courtship and marriage to his one true love, up to his death and the handing down of the High Court decision on that historic day – 3rd June 1992. MABO is as much a love story as a document of one man’s fight for recognition of what he believed was legally his.\n\nAbout | Watch Australia only – ABC iview | Watch ITunes| Trailer\n\nMatewan\n\nThe film dramatizes the events of the Battle of Matewan, a coal miners’ strike in 1920 in Matewan, a small town in the hills of West Virginia.\n\nAbout I Watch I Trailer\n\nMidnight Oil: The Hardest Line\n\nLegendary music and activism are front and centre in this exciting documentary, created with unfettered access to seminal Australian rock band Midnight Oil, who emerged from politically charged 1970s Sydney to become global icons.\n\nAbout | Watch | Trailer\n\nThe Milagro Beanfield Water\n\nWhen a Chicano handyman from the Milagro Valley decides to irrigate his small beanfield by “borrowing” some water from a large and potentially destructive site, he unknowingly sets off a chain reaction that erupts into a humorous culture clash.

On this personal and political journey she learns from Indigenous activists across three continents. She travels to the La Guajira region in rural Colombia, the Tampakan region of the Philippines, the Tehuantepec Isthmus of Mexico, and the protests at Standing Rock.
