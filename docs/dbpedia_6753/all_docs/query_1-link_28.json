        "text": "By Nava Atlas | On July 15, 2017 | Updated November 26, 2022 | Comments (8)\n\nLots of films have been made from novels by the classic women authors on this site, as you’ll see by linking to this site’s Filmography. But there are also a number of biographical films about women authors themselves, the lives they led, and the stories they told.\n\nWhat is it, do you supposed, that’s so fascinating about the life of a woman who writes? The films don’t focus on the act of writing for the most part — wouldn’t that be a yawner! Rather, they pay homage to the literary legacy they left behind in the form of their wonderful stories.\n\nSome of these films take more literary license than others when it comes to the true facts of their subjects lives, but many, if not all, can at least be an introduction to the author, her life, and work.\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\nJulia (1977)\n\nBased on the experiences of playwright Lillian Hellman. As a friend of the titled Julia, she assists her with anti-Nazi resistance work in pre-WWII Germany and Austria. Serious doubt has been cast about the veracity of this story, yet it still makes for good filmmaking.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nPortrait of a Marriage (1992)\n\nThis BBC miniseries explores the unconventional marriage of Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson. Though devoted to one another, they were free to follow their passions. She preferred women; Nicolson preferred men. Famously, Vita and Virginia Woolf had what has long been accepted as at least an emotional affair.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nMrs. Parker and the Vicious Cycle (1994)\n\nSet in the 1920’s this film follows Dorothy Parker and the members of the Algonquin Round Table — the young writers of the New York literary world at the time. Viewers are quite divided on this one — love it or hate it!\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nOut of Africa (1985)\n\nA multi-award-winning film (including best picture) about Isak Dinesen’s African sojourn, based on her 1937 memoir Out of Africa, with Meryl Streep as the author and Robert Redford as her fickle love interest.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nThe Hours (2002)\n\nA trio of interwoven stories based on the book of the same name by Michael Cunningham, one of which is about Virginia Woolf, portrayed by Nicole Kidman. Though the theme that ties the stories together is suicide, it is gripping and wonderfully acted.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nIris (2002)\n\nAs described by the filmmakers, “Here’s the powerful true story based on John Bayley’s novels that earned Jim Broadbent an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Academy Award Nominations for Best Actress Judi Dench and Best Supporting Actress Kate Winslet. Judi Dench and Kate Winslet bring to the screen one of the most extraordinary women of the 20th century, celebrated English author Iris Murdoch.”\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nSylvia (2004)\n\nGwyneth Paltrow portrays poet Sylvia Plath, with Daniel Craig as her husband and fellow poet Ted Hughes. The film follows Plath through her life, showing her development as a writer, and the increasing depression that plagued her entire, albeit brief, adult life.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nMiss Potter (2007)\n\nA charming film biography of Beatrix Potter, starring Renee Zellweger as the author who wrote and illustrated Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, and many other memorable animal stories.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nBecoming Jane (2007)\n\nStarring Anne Hathaway, this film purportedly tells the untold story of a romance between Jane Austen and a young Irishman. It’s difficult to tell if the film is intended to be historically accurate or fanciful lark.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nCross Creek (2009)\n\nThe life of The Yearling author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings on her Florida orange grove, charmingly portrayed by Mary Steenburgen. One of the better author biopics, in this writer’s opinion.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nBeyond the Prairie (2010)\n\nClaiming to be “The true life story of Laura Ingalls Wilder,” this film, like other Hollywood-ized biopics, takes a great deal of license. Purporting to be about the author and her beloved husband, Almanzo, this could be entertaining for fans of the Little House books who can view it with a big grain of salt. On the other hand, true fans might be upset by all the unnecessary liberty taken with Laura’s life, which was interesting as it was.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nSaving Mr. Banks(2013)\n\nSaving Mr. Banks is the story of how Walt Disney lobbied Pamela (P.L.) Travers for film rights to Mary Poppins, and the challenges that ensued with the prickly author. Things didn’t tie up quite so neatly in real life as they did in this film. Still, it’s good entertainment, starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nA Quiet Passion (2017)\n\nImage of Cynthia Nixon and Jennifer Ehle in Terence Davies’s A Quiet Passion, about Emily Dickinson, courtesy Double Dutch International. Film critics loved this one, but Emily Dickinson fans gave this biopic mixed reviews at best. A beautifully photographed film, one wonders how much “poetic license” was taken with the story of the brilliant poet who rarely strayed from her family’s Amherst home.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nTo Walk Invisible (2017)\n\nTo Walk Invisible is a beautifully done Masterpiece Theater film about the Brontë sisters, their father, and troublesome brother Branwell. Perfectly cast, at times you’ll feel like you’re watching a documentary about this extraordinary literary family.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nMary Shelley (2018)\n\nThis biographical film dramatizing the story of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (née Godwin), the author of Frankenstein, stars Elle Fanning. Central to the story is her tempestuous affair with and eventual marriage to the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Booth). This film was generally panned by critics, though viewers gave it a higher rating in aggregate. According to Rotten Tomatoes:\n\n“The pair are two outsiders constrained by polite society but bound together by a natural chemistry and progressive ideas that are beyond the boundaries of their age and time. Mary and Percy declare their love for each other and much to her family’s horror they run away together, joined by Mary’s half-sister Claire (Bel Powley).”\n\n. . . . . . . . . ."
