The real-life Mrs. Joanne Rogers makes a brief cameo in the film, and it's a quote from her that reminds viewers that her late husband wasn't a saint, just an ordinary man who tried very, very hard to be better and kind.\n\nYou may also like: Movies and TV shows casting across the US\n\n#95.

At first charmed by the slower pace of life, McCandless eventually found himself disillusioned with nature and attempted to return to society before making a grave mistake that would cost him everything. The story is based on a nonfiction book written by Jon Krakauer, as well as information from McCandless' surviving sister, Carine McCandless.\n\n#93.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 2004.\n\n#92.

Although the film brought in $266 million at the box office, those who were connected with the case in real life, including Lucas himself, have argued that it takes too many liberties and strays pretty far from the truth.\n\n#91. The Killing Fields (1984)\n\n- Director: Roland Joffé\n\n- Stacker score: 84.2\n\n- Metascore: 76\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.8\n\n- Runtime: 141 minutes\n\nNominated for seven Oscars at the 57th Academy Awards, \"The Killing Fields\" tells the story of two journalists, American Sydney Schanberg and Cambodian Dith Pran, who are covering the country's civil war and find themselves trapped when Pol Pot begins his bloody Year Zero cleansing campaign.

Very experimental in its form, the film doesn't accommodate casual viewing but offers a fascinating story for those willing to pay close attention.\n\n#88. An Angel at My Table (1990)\n\n- Director: Jane Campion\n\n- Stacker score: 84.2\n\n- Metascore: 79\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Runtime: 158 minutes\n\nThe story of New Zealand author Janet Frame's life, \"An Angel at My Table\" is based on Frame's three autobiographies and uses three different actresses to portray her at different points in her life, from her impoverished childhood through her time at a mental institution (wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia) to the beginning of her wildly successful writing career. The film swept awards in New Zealand and won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival.\n\n#87.

Murrow and producer Fred W. Friendly, who used their news show to stand up to McCarthy and remove his cancerous lies from the public eye. The film and its message remain incredibly relevant to today's political polarization.\n\n#84. Il Divo (2008)\n\n- Director: Paolo Sorrentino\n\n- Stacker score: 84.2\n\n- Metascore: 81\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.3\n\n- Runtime: 110 minutes\n\n\"Il Divo\" translates to \"The Divine Performer,\" a fitting title for this 2008 film that explores the life of seven-time Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who had alleged ties to the Mafia. The story begins in 1992 as Andreotti is elected for the seventh time, then covers his failed presidency bid and bribe scandal, ultimately ending with his trial in 1995. The Guardian called the movie \"a macabre masterpiece.\"\n\n#83.

While Cahill (played by Brendan Gleeson) was far from a good man, the 1998 movie will make you admire the way he stuck to his morals, even when they were questionable.\n\n#82. Steve Jobs (2015)\n\n- Director: Danny Boyle\n\n- Stacker score: 84.2\n\n- Metascore: 82\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.2\n\n- Runtime: 122 minutes\n\nSince his death in 2011, there have been several movies and documentaries about Apple co-founder and tech guru Steve Jobs, but this 2015 biopic is among the best. Michael Fassbender brings the turtleneck-loving visionary to life in the film, which covers three different product launches that took place between 1984 and 1998. Unlike many other Jobs films, this movie also focuses on his relationship with his daughter, Lisa, whom he had with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan and refused to support for many years, despite his massive wealth.\n\n#81. Vincere (2009)\n\n- Director: Marco Bellocchio\n\n- Stacker score: 84.2\n\n- Metascore: 85\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.9\n\n- Runtime: 128 minutes\n\nIda Dalser may be, in many ways, one of history's most important women, but her name and memory have largely been forgotten by the general public. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's first wife and the mother of his son Benito Albino, Dasler financed a newspaper in which Mussolini shared and expounded on his political views, garnering support for his fascist platform. Although the film occasionally steps away from the facts of the story, it's still a wonderful primer for those who wish to know more about the rise of the politician and those who shaped him.\n\n#80.

The real Lauda has publicly stated that the film holds true to the reality of their lives, in spite of the fact that it omits the close friendship the men shared later in life.

Wallace's estate and many of his living friends objected to the film, saying that it didn't capture the famous writer as he really was.\n\nYou may also like: Best movies of 2023 so far\n\n#75.

Based on the play of the same name, the film starred veteran actors Spencer Tracy, Gene Kelly, and Fredric March. In spite of the fact that the storyline of the film varies substantially from real-life events, it's had an outsized impact on the general public's opinion and beliefs about the case, inspiring debate over a biopic's obligation to stick to the hard facts of its topic.\n\n#72.

Martin Scorsese's smash hit \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" tells the true story of the unparalleled misconduct laid bare in Belfort's memoir of the same name.

This 2008 film tells the whole story of the legendary Frost-Nixon interviews and was based on a stage play of the same name, which also starred Frank Langella (Nixon) and Michael Sheen (Frost).\n\n#66. 127 Hours (2010)\n\n- Director: Danny Boyle\n\n- Stacker score: 85.8\n\n- Metascore: 82\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Runtime: 94 minutes\n\nAcademy Award winner Danny Boyle directed \"127 Hours,\" an intense film about a hiker named Aron Ralston who found himself trapped by a boulder in a remote canyon in Utah.

Although a huge moneymaker for Universal Studios and a critical success, director Stanley Kubrick hated the film and never included it in his canon.\n\n#19.

Cohan was one of Broadway's biggest stars, a playwright, composer, actor, dancer, and singer who wrote his own shows in the earliest years of the 20th century. \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" is a musical that honors the performer's life, though it strays pretty far from the truth despite Cohan himself briefly serving as a consultant.\n\n#18.
