        "text": "FILM-C 352 Biopics (3 cr.)\n\nWe will study one of the richest, but most underappreciated of film genres, the film biography, better known as the biopic. You will learn to discuss biography as a genre; to assess mythmaking in the telling of lives; to analyze the ways that biographical films work cinematically; and to see how, as a dynamic form, the biopic continues to produce portraits of what it means to distinguish oneself in the world. PUL=1C\n\nFILM-C 362 Hollywood in the 1950s (3 cr.)\n\nThis course, the second in a series on the history of the sound film, concerns one of the most critical periods of change both in American life and in the American film as art and entertainment. The late forties and early fifties in America brought the end of two decades of depression and world war and the coming of prosperity, suburbs, the baby boom, the Cold War, television, and the first stirrings of the Civil Rights movement. For Hollywood, the era forced the end of the unified mass audience and with it the breakup of the old powerful studios. Now came the (first) age of the blockbuster, of widescreen and stereophonic sound, of youth films, and Method acting, of a measure of psychological realism, and a new division, however, artificial, between art and entertainment films. The fifties are a fascinating period of reinvention and transition.Â Television, the blacklist, widescreen, Method acting, psychological realism, the decline of the Production Code, the influence of art cinema; iconic films from Sunset Blvd. to Some Like It Hot, Singin' in the Rain to The Searchers, Rebel Without a Cause to On the Waterfront. PUL=1CÂ\n\nENG-W 262 Style and voice for Writers (3 cr.)\n\nVoice pulls readers into a writerâs world, the \"sound\" of that writerâs voice \"speaking\" to readers.Â This courseÂ focuses on recognizing, developing, and sharpening your written voice. But how do you recognize that voice?Â What are its characteristics?Â How do you challenge yourself to experiment with language?Â How do you adapt to the plethora of writing you do as a student, in the workplace, or on your own, while maintaining the unique stamp that is your own?Â This course examines Â a variety of published authorsâ works, identifying the stylistic choices that shaped those works, thereby building awareness of the variety of stylistic choices available to you as a writer.Â You will apply that awareness to your own writing, and examine the decision making processes that equip you to \"voice\" your ideas in vivid and concise language, \"speaking\" on the page in your unique voice. PUL=4; RISE=R\n\nENG-L 503 Teaching of Lit in College (2-4 cr.)\n\nThis course introduces graduate students to the practical and theoretical issues involved in teaching literature at the college level.Â We will learn to set teaching objectives, organize a course, and construct a syllabus.Â We will review theories on how readers make sense of texts and how reading literature differs from other kinds of reading.Â We will explore several different approaches to teaching literature, including lecture, discussion, workshop, and online teaching.Â Recognizing that each genre presents its own pedagogical challenges, we will discuss strategies appropriate to teaching fiction, poetry, and drama.Â Although the course focuses on teaching literature at the college level, many of the strategies we will discuss are applicable to high-school teaching.\n\nENG-L 641 English Literature 1790-1900 (4 cr.)\n\nThe course will explore the nexus between English literature, history, and print culture from the late sixteenth- to the early seventeenth century, using as our starting point Englandâs unexpected (yet, perhaps, divinely inspired!) victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588âthe event that established England as a naval, military, and commercial power on par with continental Europe.Â From this triumphant moment, we will follow the nation through several succession crises, religious controversies, economic turmoil, struggles over theatrical and print censorship, and violently contested debates about the nature of Kingship itself, all of which led to a Civil War, the closing of the public theaters, the beheading of Charles I, and the eventual Restoration of the monarchy after an uncomfortable period of Parliamentarian and Protectorate rule.\n\nENG-L 666 Survey of Children's Literature (3-4 cr.)\n\nIn this course, we will address the question of how transhistorical trends in childrenâs literature reflect changing cultural views on children as intellectuals and consumers. We will work toward answering this question by first studying a variety of theoretical approaches to defining the child as a subject, and also by reading Lewis Carrollâs Alice in Wonderland and J.M. Barrieâs Peter Pan in order to establish a baseline for the historical treatment of the child as reader and subject.Â In light of critical debates stemming from these cornerstones of childrenâs literature, we will then move on to a study of contemporary authors who adapt traditional themes and storytelling structures in order to re-present issues such as freedom of speech, immigration, racial and gender politics, and environmentalism to child readers."
