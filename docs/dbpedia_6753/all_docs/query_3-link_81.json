        "text": "What Is a Biography?\n\nA biography is an account of someone’s life written by someone else. While there is a genre known as a fictional biography, for the most part, biographies are, by definition, nonfiction.\n\nGenerally speaking, biographies provide an account of the subject’s life from the earliest days of childhood to the present day or, if the subject is deceased, their death.\n\nThe job of a biography is more than just to outline the bare facts of a person’s life.\n\nRather than just listing the basic details of their upbringing, hobbies, education, work, relationships, and death, a well-written biography should also paint a picture of the subject’s personality and experience of life.\n\nFeatures of a Biography\n\nBefore students begin writing a biography, they’ll need to have a firm grasp of the main features of a Biography. An excellent way to determine how well they understand these essential elements is to ask them to compile a checklist like the one-blow\n\nTheir checklists should contain the items below at a minimum. Be sure to help them fill in any gaps before moving on to the writing process.\n\nThe purpose of a biography is to provide an account of someone’s life.\n\nTHE PROCESS OF WRITING A BIOGRAPHY\n\nLike any form of writing, you will find it simple if you have a plan and follow it through. These steps will ensure you cover the essential bases of writing a biography essay.\n\nFirstly, select a subject that inspires you. Someone whose life story resonates with you and whose contribution to society intrigues you. The next step is to conduct thorough research. Engage in extensive reading, explore various sources, watch documentaries, and glean all available information to provide a comprehensive account of the person’s life.\n\nCreating an outline is essential to organize your thoughts and information. The outline should include the person’s early life, education, career, achievements, and any other significant events or contributions. It serves as a map for the writing process, ensuring that all vital information is included.\n\nYour biography should have an engaging introduction that captivates the reader’s attention and provides background information on the person you’re writing about. It should include a thesis statement summarising the biography’s main points.\n\nWriting a biography in chronological order is crucial. You should begin with the person’s early life and move through their career and achievements. This approach clarifies how the person’s life unfolded and how they accomplished their goals.\n\nA biography should be written in a narrative style, capturing the essence of the person’s life through vivid descriptions, anecdotes, and quotes. Avoid dry, factual writing and focus on creating a compelling narrative that engages the reader.\n\nAdding personal insights and opinions can enhance the biography’s overall impact, providing a unique perspective on the person’s achievements, legacy, and impact on society.\n\nEditing and proofreading are vital elements of the writing process. Thoroughly reviewing your biography ensures that the writing is clear, concise, and error-free. You can even request feedback from someone else to ensure that it is engaging and well-written.\n\nFinally, including a bibliography at the end of your biography is essential. It gives credit to the sources that were used during research, such as books, articles, interviews, and websites.\n\nTips for Writing a Brilliant Biography\n\nBiography Writing Tip #1: Choose Your Subject Wisely\n\nThere are several points for students to reflect on when deciding on a subject for their biography. Let’s take a look at the most essential points to consider when deciding on the subject for a biography:\n\nInterest: To produce a biography will require sustained writing from the student. That’s why students must choose their subject well. After all, a biography is an account of someone’s entire life to date. Students must ensure they choose a subject that will sustain their interest throughout the research, writing, and editing processes.\n\nMerit: Closely related to the previous point, students must consider whether the subject merits the reader’s interest. Aside from pure labors of love, writing should be undertaken with the reader in mind. While producing a biography demands sustained writing from the author, it also demands sustained reading from the reader.\n\nTherefore, students should ask themselves if their chosen subject has had a life worthy of the reader’s interest and the time they’d need to invest in reading their biography.\n\nInformation: Is there enough information available on the subject to fuel the writing of an entire biography? While it might be a tempting idea to write about a great-great-grandfather’s experience in the war. There would be enough interest there to sustain the author’s and the reader’s interest, but do you have enough access to information about their early childhood to do the subject justice\n\nin the form of a biography?\n\nBiography Writing Tip #2: Research! Research! Research!\n\nWhile the chances are good that the student already knows quite a bit about the subject they’ve chosen. Chances are 100% that they’ll still need to undertake considerable research to write their biography.\n\nAs with many types of writing, research is an essential part of the planning process that shouldn’t be overlooked. If students wish to give as complete an account of their subject’s life as possible, they’ll need to put in the time at the research stage.\n\nAn effective way to approach the research process is to:\n\n1. Compile a chronological timeline of the central facts, dates, and events of the subject’s life\n\n2. Compile detailed descriptions of the following personal traits:\n\nPhysical looks\n\nCharacter traits\n\nValues and beliefs\n\n3. Compile some research questions based on different topics to provide a focus for the research:\n\nChildhood: Where and when were they born? Who were their parents? Who were the other family members? What education did they receive?\n\nObstacles: What challenges did they have to overcome? How did these challenges shape them as individuals?\n\nLegacy: What impact did this person have on the world and/or the people around them?\n\nDialogue & Quotes: Dialogue and quotations by and about the subject are a great way to bring color and life to a biography. Students should keep an eagle eye out for the gems that hide amid their sources.\n\nAs the student gets deeper into their research, new questions will arise that can further fuel the research process and help to shape the direction the biography will ultimately go in.\n\nLikewise, during the research, themes will often begin to suggest themselves. Exploring these themes is essential to bring depth to biography, but we’ll discuss this later in this article.\n\nResearch Skills:\n\nResearching for biography writing is an excellent way for students to hone their research skills in general. Developing good research skills is essential for future academic success. Students will have opportunities to learn how to:\n\nGather relevant information\n\nEvaluate different information sources\n\nSelect suitable information\n\nOrganize information into a text.\n\nStudents will have access to print and online information sources, and, in some cases, they may also have access to people who knew or know the subject (e.g. biography of a family member).\n\nThese days, much of the research will likely take place online. It’s crucial, therefore, to provide your students with guidance on how to use the internet safely and evaluate online sources for reliability. This is the era of ‘fake news’ and misinformation after all!\n\nBIOGRAPHY WRITING Tip #3: Find Your Themes In Biography Writing\n\nThough predominantly a nonfiction genre, the story still plays a significant role in good biography writing. The skills of characterization and plot structuring are transferable here. And, just like in fiction, exploring themes in a biographical work helps connect the personal to the universal. Of course, these shouldn’t be forced; this will make the work seem contrived, and the reader may lose faith in the truthfulness of the account. A biographer needs to gain and maintain the trust of the reader.\n\nFortunately, themes shouldn’t need to be forced. A life well-lived is full of meaning, and the themes the student writer is looking for will emerge effortlessly from the actions and events of the subject’s life. It’s just a case of learning how to spot them.\n\nOne way to identify the themes in a life is to look for recurring events or situations in a person’s life. These should be apparent from the research completed previously. The students should seek to identify these patterns that emerge in the subject’s life. For example, perhaps they’ve had to overcome various obstacles throughout different periods of their life. In that case, the theme of overcoming adversity is present and has been identified.\n\nUsually, a biography has several themes running throughout, so be sure your students work to identify more than one theme in their subject’s life.\n\nBIOGRAPHY WRITING Tip: #4 Put Something of Yourself into the Writing\n\nWhile the defining feature of a biography is that it gives an account of a person’s life, students must understand that this is not all a biography does. Relating the facts and details of a subject’s life is not enough. The student biographer should not be afraid to share their thoughts and feelings with the reader throughout their account of their subject’s life.\n\nThe student can weave some of their personality into the fabric of the text by providing commentary and opinion as they relate the events of the person’s life and the wider social context at the time. Unlike the detached and objective approach we’d expect to find in a history textbook, in a biography, student-writers should communicate their enthusiasm for their subject in their writing.\n\nThis makes for a more intimate experience for the reader, as they get a sense of getting to know the author and the subject they are writing about.\n\nBiography Examples For Students\n\nWe have compiled a sequence of biography-related lessons or teaching ideas that you can follow as you please. They are straightforward enough for most students to follow without further instruction.\n\nBIOGRAPHY LESSON IDEA # 1:\n\nThis session aims to give students a broader understanding of what makes a good biography.\n\nOnce your students have compiled a comprehensive checklist of the main features of a biography, allow them to use it to assess some biographies from your school library or on the internet using the feature checklist.\n\nWhen students have assessed a selection of biographies, take some time as a class to discuss them. You can base the discussion around the following prompts:\n\nWhich biographies covered all the criteria from their checklist?\n\nWhich biographies didn’t?\n\nWhich biography was the most readable in terms of structure?\n\nWhich biography do you think was the least well-structured? How would you improve this?\n\nLooking at how other writers have interpreted the form will help students internalize the necessary criteria before attempting to produce a biography. Once students have a clear understanding of the main features of the biography, they’re ready to begin work on writing a biography.\n\nWhen the time does come to put pen to paper, be sure they’re armed with the following top tips to help ensure they’re as well prepared as possible.\n\nBIOGRAPHY LESSON IDEA # 2:\n\nThis session aims to guide students through the process of selecting the perfect biography subject.\n\nInstruct students to draw up a shortlist of three potential subjects for the biography they’ll write.\n\nUsing the three criteria mentioned in the writing guide (Interest, Merit, and Information), students award each potential subject a mark out of 5 for each of the criteria. In this manner, students can select the most suitable subject for their biography.\n\nBIOGRAPHY LESSON IDEA # 3:\n\nThis session aims to get students into the researching phase, then prioritise and organise events chronologically.\n\nStudents begin by making a timeline of their subject’s life, starting with their birth and ending with their death or the present day. If the student has yet to make a final decision on the subject of their biography, a family member will often serve well for this exercise as a practice exercise.\n\nStudents should research and gather the key events of the person’s life, covering each period of their life from when they were a baby, through childhood and adolescence, right up to adulthood and old age. They should then organize these onto a timeline. Students can include photographs with captions if they have them.\n\nThey can present these to the class when they have finished their timelines.\n\nBIOGRAPHY LESSON IDEA # 4:\n\nInstruct students to look over their timeline, notes, and other research. Challenge them to identify three patterns that repeat throughout the subject’s life and sort all the related events and incidents into specific categories.\n\nStudents should then label each category with a single word. This is the thematic concept or the broad general underlying idea. After that, students should write a sentence or two expressing what the subject’s life ‘says’ about that concept.\n\nThis is known as the thematic statement. With the thematic concepts and thematic statements identified, the student now has some substantial ideas to explore that will help bring more profound meaning and wider resonance to their biography.\n\nBIOGRAPHY LESSON IDEA # 5:\n\nInstruct students to write a short objective account of an event in their own life. They can write about anyone from their past. It needn’t be more than a couple of paragraphs, but the writing should be strictly factual, focusing only on the objective details of what happened.\n\nOnce they have completed this, it’s time to rewrite the paragraph, but they should include some opinion and personal commentary this time.\n\nThe student here aims to inject some color and personality into their writing, to transform a detached, factual account into a warm, engaging story.\n\nWRITING CHECKLIST & RUBRIC BUNDLE\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (92 Reviews)\n\nTo Conclude\n\nBy this stage, your students should have an excellent technical overview of a biography’s essential elements.\n\nThey should be able to choose their subject in light of how interesting and worthy they are, as well as give consideration to the availability of information out there. They should be able to research effectively and identify emerging themes in their research notes. And finally, they should be able to bring some of their personality and uniqueness into their retelling of the life of another.\n\nRemember that writing a biography is not only a great way to develop a student’s writing skills; it can be used in almost all curriculum areas. For example, to find out more about a historical figure in History, to investigate scientific contributions to Science, or to celebrate a hero from everyday life.\n\nBiography is an excellent genre for students to develop their writing skills and to find inspiration in the lives of others in the world around them.\n\nHOW TO WRITE A BIOGRAPHY TUTORIAL VIDEO\n\nOTHER GREAT ARTICLES RELATED TO BIOGRAPHY WRITING"
