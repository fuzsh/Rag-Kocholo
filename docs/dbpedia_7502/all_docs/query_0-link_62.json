American cinema has used Alfred Hitchcock to create fear for many years like it was displayed in the horror film Psycho, has allowed us to sing in dance with the cast in the musical Chicago, and check out, momentarily, from reality in many science fiction films.

Much of the plot is established following influences of the first world war, and the culture of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Although criticised for its allusions to communism in the resolution of the film, Lang explores mostly themes of industrialisation and mass production, which, coincidentally, were two developments that provided a large influence in the First World War. Lang also explores themes of the Weimer view of American modernity, communism and fascist rule. Politically, this film was shot after WWI, meaning many of its influences were extracted from the horrors of the First World War.\n\nSome key topics the class discussed about for Shadow of a Doubt Hitchcock’s use of Dutch angle when Charlies was in his room as he’s freaking out about being discovered.
