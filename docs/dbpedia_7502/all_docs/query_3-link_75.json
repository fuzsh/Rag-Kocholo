        "meta_description": "Welcome to Cinema Appreciation.  This list of the 100 Most Influential Films of All Time is designed as an introduction to cinema appreciation and the impact that film has had on American art, culture and civilization. As such, the list is weighted towards American films and those non-American films that have impacted American culture.  When a foreign film appears on the list it does not represent the best of a particular foreign genre, but rather the impact that film has had on American culture. Last updated by Cinema Appreciation Spring 2023.\n\nThis list them combines the four dominant ways that we can evaluate film objectively:\n\nGreatest accomplishments in film history -Aesthetics of film -Film's impact on society -Technological advances in film -Film as business (commercial success)\n\n Note:  This list is not a 100 Greatest Films of All-Time as created by AFI, American Film Institute.  In fact, every semester my film classes evaluate which films to eliminate from the list and which films to add.  \n\nProfessor Frazier",

        "text": "Inlfuence: Eistenstein's ode to the Russian Revolution in which he revolutionized the language of film montage through juxtaposing and contrasting images next to one another to create a new meaning--an idea promoted by fellow Russian theorist Kuleshov and filmmaker Pudovkin. Eisenstein's 5 theories of montage are:\n\nMetric-Cutting to the beat (usually every 2 seconds)\n\nRhythmic-Cutting to the rhythm of action in a shot\n\nTonal-Concerning changing tones within a shot\n\nOvertonal-Concerning changing tones within a large sequence\n\nIntellectual or Ideological-Cutting based upon ideas. (Most important)\n\nInfluence: Windsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur is a 1914 animated short film as an interactive part of his vaudeville act; the frisky, childlike Gertie did tricks at the command of her master.\n\nAlthough Gertie is popularly thought to be the earliest animated film, McCay had earlier made Little Nemo (1911) and How a Mosquito Operates (1912). Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay's film from these earlier \"trick films\". Gertie was the first film to use animation techniques such as keyframes, registration marks, tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and animation loops. It influenced the next generation of animators like Walt Disney. McCay's first three films were the earliest animated works to have a commercial impact; their success motivated film studios to join in the infant animation industry.\n\nYoung Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto are swept away by a tornado from their Kansas farm to the magical Land of Oz and embark on a quest with three new friends to see the Wizard, who can return her to her home and fulfill the others' wishes.\n\nInfluence: Akira Kurosawa is a true auteur filmmaker whose ideals such as developing music throughout a film, worn costumes, use of weather, superhero samurai themes of love with non-superheros, working in groups together, ue of telephoto lenses, and the wipe transition used to such great effect in George Lucas' Star Wars. This film leads to the creation of the spaghetti Western genre of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nInfluence: Walt Disney's first commercially successful cartoon is also the first cartoon with synchronized sound thanks to the earlier release of the Jazz Singer. Even though this was Mickey and Minnie Mouse's third cartoon, it was the first cartoon released to the public thus creating the jugernaut that would become one of the most influential entertainment companies in the world.\n\nInfluence: Leni Riefenstahl's masterpiece of Nazi propaganda depicting the full-fledged love of the German people for one of the world's most notorious leaders, Adolph Hitler. Another early documentary film to challenge what a documentary film is like Nanook of the North. The film is one of the most controversial in the history of cinema.\n\nInfluence: As one of the founding members of the French New Wave, Jean-Luc Godard experimented with and created a new film language about the youthful exuberant culture of post-World War II Paris. The French New Wave challenged most of the film rules of Classical film editing as established in Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane and the hallmarks are seen in all modern films (especially in Tarrantino, Scorcese, Wes Anderson and Speilberg). Features include: moving camera, discontinuity editing like jump cuts, breaking the 4th wall, long tracking shots, current social issues shot on location with portable handheld equipment, breaking the 180 degree rule, rapid scene changes, improvised dialogue, and existential themes such as stressing the individual and the acceptance of the absurdity of human existence.\n\nInfluence: Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest auteur filmmakers of all time. This philosophical film on the nature of life and death (as seen through a chess match between a Medieval knight with the grim reaper) shows many of Bergman's characteristic features:\n\n-deal with existential questions of mortality, loneliness, and religious faith.\n\n-while these topics could seem cerebral, sexual desire found its way to the foreground of most of his films.\n\n-his female characters are usually more in touch with their sexuality than the men, and unafraid to proclaim it, sometimes with breathtaking overtness.\n\nInfluence: In the early 20th century Charlie Chaplin was the best known person on earth. His fame and influence would rival any group of people that you could think of day. Modern Times is a social commentary on the industrialization of America and its workforce. Modern Times is generally considered his acting and directing masterpiece and includes his characteristic style:\n\n-stationary camera. Chaplin said, \"Close-ups for tragedy. Long-shots for comedy.\"\n\n-Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters.\n\n-Chaplin's silent films typically follow the Tramp's efforts to survive in a hostile world.\n\n-social commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor.\n\nInfluence: Walt Disney's innovative look at animation. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound. It received mixed critical reaction and was unable to make a profit because World War II cut off distribution to the European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations. Fantasia has grossed $76.4 million in domestic revenue and is the 22nd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. when adjusted for inflation. Fantasia, as a franchise, has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, a live concert, and a theatrically released sequel (Fantasia 2000) co-produced by Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney in 1999. Fantasia is widely acclaimed, and in 1998 the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years...100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list.\n\nInfluence: Vittorio de Sica's masterpiece of Italian Neorealism about a man who lands a good job in a difficult economic situation only to have the bicycle stolen. Italian neorealism films mostly contend with the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, representing changes in the Italian psyche and conditions of everyday life, including poverty, oppression, injustice and desperation. The film ends in a question about what is moral during a difficult economic situation.\n\nInfluence: William Wyler's MGM Production of an epic that at that time had the largest production cost and sets in movie history. Winning 11 Academy Awards, this film proved that audiences were willing to return to the movie theater multiple times to see epic scenes. The 9-minute chariot race and film score has become one of the most famous in the history of film. The film also indicated that the American audience was intersted in religious themed epics."
