        "text": "well not really. this movie is usually considered the greatest american film ever. it's always at the top of critic's lists.\n\nI tried to watch it once and thought it was dull and ended up shutting it off. it's one of the movies you feel compelled to be in awe of because everyone tells you how great it is. i just didn't get it. likewise i felt there was greatness in \"brother wer out thou\" and \"hero\" with dustin hoffman but no one else seems to have felt that way.\n\nout of curiousity, anyone else think CK is not particularly entertaining? perhaps even, dare i even consider it....overrated???\n\nI agree 100% about Good Will Hunting, but not about Citizen Kane.\n\nNow, I'm not going to get all pretentious film-snob on you (my favorite genres are Horror, Action, etc.) and I agree that it's not pure entertainment. I mean, it's slow in places, disorientingly fast in others, and ultimately frustrating. I mean, look at the ending. What a cheap answer!\n\nBut look at the narrative structure of every movie made by an American studio before Citizen Kane, then compare it to Kane's narrative structure. Look at the cinematography and compare it to everything before it. The movie is just so unbelievably original. Then look at film noir: the stories are investigations (like Kane) often told in a series of flashbacks (like Kane) and are mysteries with ultimately tragic, disheartening answers (like Kane.) Look at the cinematography in film noir: low key lighting with deep focus photography and long takes. Kane invented the language of a genre it wasn't even a part of. I mean, the camera movement in Citizen Kane alone could justify its place on the top ten great movies of all time. Welles and Tolland never cut unless they have to--or WANT to--instead brilliantly controlling figure movement and camera movement (and TONS of special effects) to create some of the most bizarre and powerful images ever created on screen.\n\nTo be honest, I was more entertained by Die Hard than by Citizen Kane, but utlimately, what's the better movie? (Die Hard is still a great movie, imo.) I think as an artifact of film history and as an influential piece of film making, Kane deserves its place as number one. But \"the best movie of all time?\" If by \"best\" you mean \"most entertaining\" or \"most accessable\" then absolutely not.\n\nSo I agree it's not as entertaining as it could be (though I definitely enjoyed it and plan to see it again), and I agree it's over-rated in some regards. Anything that's rated that highly HAS to be over-rated. But I still think it's earned its spot as a critical darling, and I'd rather see it as number one than Casablanca, even if Casablanca is the more polished, more enjoyable film in most respects.\n\nSorry for the rant, by the way. I need to type quicker responses...\n\nbrianluce,\n\nheck, watching a film is such a personal experience, there will not be two people on the planet who share their film fondness across the board.\n\nThat's why discussing film is so futile...oops, what am I doing in here then???\n\nHeck, I thought LOTR was the worst good looking movie ever made.\n\nI liked American Psycho, but haven't met anyone who has actually even seen it!\n\n:happy:\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that CK is old. You have the benefit of having watched a gazillion movies that came AFTER that was made, so it's almost impossible to imagine what it must of been like to watch it back then.\n\nThere's some good points in here, but Brianluce you're right about CK for the most part, when I saw it a few years back I thought something was wrong with me when I didn't like it. I felt like I had to like it, people hold it up so high on this pedestal, but I thought I was the only one on the planet who just thought it was an ok. movie, Keep in mind, it's not a horrible movie like \"Gigli\" or \"Paparazzi\" but it's not that great like people say it is...\n\nJust based on it's cinemaphotography alone Citizen Kane is a great movie. It was shot beautifully. It got mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office because William Hearst (the news paper giant, and the inspiration for Kane) basically black listed the movie.\n\nThis movie earned it's reputation through it's innovation. Of course most of the people that watch it today are going to get it. They don't know the story behind it, how Hearst fought to have the movie shut down. Having not grown up in that era they don't recognize the break throughs that were made. Most importantly, this is the era of short attention spans and constant action. Most of the viewers today can't sit through movies that don't change scenes every 3 minutes unless there is something blowing up.\n\nI don't get the acclaim this movie has received. I don't like it. I watched it again recently and while it has some interesting camera work I can't honestly say it appeals to me. Taken in the context of its time is something thats hard to do. I'm 50 and have watched movies all my life. Casablanca I get, its a great movie. Citizen Kane? I have a hard time even sitting thru it. Hitchcock did a lot of inovative things that by todays standards are not that fantastic but he was the first on to do it. I would guess its the same with CK.\n\nI grew up with Hitchcock on tv every Sunday and I liked his stuff even as a kid. Segio Leone grabbed my attention more than Hitchcock or anyone since. There are a ton of directors today that have taken those old masters and \"kicked em up a notch\" with technology and inovation. Its easy to forget that they(the old timers) worked with a lot less and developed a lot of what is common place today. So I'll give Orson the benifit of the doubt but somewhere in the back of my mind I think Walt Disney may have contributed more to the industry.\n\nBigmagic, I'm disagreeing 100%. Citizen Kane developed the grammar of the Film Noir, changed the way narratives were structured, and basically reinvented cinematography for the next ten years, and continues to influence it to this day.\n\nYou can make this argument only if you consider all the following to be insiginifcant:\n\nDeep focus cinematography.\n\nFramed narratives.\n\nLow key lighting.\n\nLong takes.\n\nSpecial effects to achieve tricks of focus/heavy use of matte shots for purposes other than pure spectacle.\n\nAnd all the things that came from these innovations (I'd argue that the long take became even more important when widescreen was introduced, and CK set the stage for this. I'd also argue that the whole industry and its structure around the Noir B picture until the 1950s was largely influenced by CK. And I'd argue that movies today which use long takes owe a debt to the movie.)\n\nI'm not even giving Welles all the glory. Tolland and Macievicz or whats-his-face deserve it to. But, utlimately, Casablanca was nothing but a great movie based on the achievements of others. It was incredibly well written, acted, and made, but historically it meant very little. Kane was a revelation. I enjoyed it, I can understand if others didn't, but to dismiss its historical significance is just flat out wrong."
