        "text": "Citizen Kane shotted at the age of 25 by Orson Welles and is known as his best film. The film is generally placed in the top ten in films in history according to poles even today. Is it because it has earned the respect of the critics or is the movie authentic enough to retain its value even today without aging?\n\nFrom my perspective, what makes Citizen Kane is a successful movie its richness and complexity. Studying this movie under a certain or one genre means narrowing it down. There is absolute control over the film and it’s not dependent on the only written story but also the use of visual oppurtinites. Orson Welles daring filmmakers to use the opportunities of light, long shots, low angles, non-linear storytelling, and likes. He is experimenting while making these experiments to serve the movie itself.\n\nIn the golden age of cinema, Citizen Kane is perhaps the hardest film to understand from the audience, but it is not a failure of the way the director chooses to tell the story, it is something new and unprecedented. Citizen Kane starts with the simple word Rosebud. Kane's story can be thought of as a puzzle, and this simple word is the missing part of his story. In pursuit of complete the puzzle, the publisher sends his worker to learn what rosebud means to Charles Foster Kane. As they researched and interviewed Kane’s relatives and friends, we learn Kane’s life in detail. The film starts as a detective story and turning into a biography film. This shift happens as a result of non-linear narrative form. We get to know Kane through flashbacks and flashforwards.\n\nThe Kafkaesque atmosphere of the movie\n\nChoice of non-linear storytelling is eligible to Citizen Kane. However, in the prologue, I was overwhelmed by the first twenty-minute which is focused on the brief life story of Kane. I felt like I was missing something. However, after thirty minutes I used to pace the movie. Considering the Golden Age of Cinema era and the audience, Citizen Kane might be a bit sophisticated to the audience.\n\nHowever, I would say Orson Welles's devotion and talent can be seen in every frame. In his movie, there can be seen absolute control which conforms to the auteur theory. Daring low-key shots, brilliant use of lighting, detailed character study. I really enjoyed the performance of all actors. Especially with Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles’ performance. Being a best friend, the contradiction between them adds dimensions to Charlie Foster Kane.\n\n“There is the only person in the world who decides what I am gonna do and it's me!”\n\nKane suffering from his narcissistic behavior. Separation from his family at a young age and acquire a fortune, Kane realizes that he can purchase everything except love. In every action he took, his main point is to compensate for this space and provide prosperity. Foster, first seeks the love from his wife and then the whole American people as a presidential candidate. However, his search ends up with the declaration of the word “Rosebud”. It means too much to him. Rosebud is the emblem of the security, hope, and innocence of childhood, which a man can spend his life seeking to regain. In addition to that “Rosebud” etymologically refers to the maternal womb.\n\nKane wants to fight with his destiny\n\nFrom the voices lost in a large dining room, the huge fireplace placed to heat a gorgeous castle, the countless sculptures Kane purchased, we can say that Kane's hunger for love that materialist motivation could not satisfy, and this came out as a kind of obsession and narcissism. Welles demonstrates Kane’s inner motivation by investing in good, detailed decor.\n\nOrson Welles inspired the story from William Randolph Hearst’s life story. William Randolph Hearst was an American businessman, newspaper publisher, and politician best known for developing Hearst Communications, the nation's largest newspaper chain, and media company. With his immense fortune, he even built a delightful castle called Hearst. Orson Welles changed the castle name to Xanadu. But these similarities disturbed Randolph and Welles encountered with several threats. They offered him money to destroy the film copies. Fourtanetly, Orson Welles’s devotion did not deprive us of this masterpiece.\n\nXanadu Castle in Citizen Kane\n\nIt was quite impressive showing the huge castle in the mise en scene that the first and the last scene closed in the same way. The wires drawn in front of his castle felt intimidating. While in the first scene we as an audience felt as if it was impossible to enter this castle. However, in the last scene, we felt that Kane could only get out of this private property by his death. Citizen Kane breaks the stereotypes of the conventional golden age of cinema films. Despite Orson Welles experimented with only two short films, his first feature is like a masterpiece. It would not be wrong to say that Citizen Kane inspired many films. In my opinion, Tony Montana is a modern Charlie Foster Kane or The Irishman is a modern Citizen Kane in the sense of storytelling. Personally, I enjoyed the movie and I would say It’s one of the best black and white movie I have seen. Citizen Kane should add to your watchlist.\n\nWelles/ Orson, Citizen Kane.
