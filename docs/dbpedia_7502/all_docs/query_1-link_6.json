        "meta_description": "Twice ranked by the American Film Institute as the greatest American film ever made, CITIZEN KANE’s iconic opening line – “Rosebud,” uttered by the title character in his final moments – appears at #17 on AFI’s list of the art form’s most memorable movie quotes. Making his remarkable film debut with CITIZEN KANE, director, producer, co-writer and star Orson Welles was the third recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1975. The film was also edited by Robert Wise – who would go on to become a great director in his own right, later serving as Chair of the AFI Conservatory (then called the Center for Advanced Film Studies) and earning his own AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.\r\n\r\nVisit the AFI Catalog to learn more about CITIZEN KANE.[/vc_",
