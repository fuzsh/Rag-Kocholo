(1941) Charles Kane was a man that some of us hated or some us loved. He was a mysterious man, we know nothing of him, however we have heard of him. From friends, family, or especially in the newspaper, but who was he really?\n\nI believe that basing the film on his life brought both advantages and disadvantages. To start off, I think the advantages of this was that Charles Foster Kane was such a recognizable character and people would be familiar with who William Randolph Hearst. That when people watched this film, the audience will go out after watching it and talk about it more, getting lots of press. But also, the disadvantage was that Hearst did not want this film to get views, so he banned/prohibited the film to be advertized and mentioned in any way. From the film not getting publicity, this led to people thinking that the film was a bad move, which probably made the views drop down.\n\nHow Did Citizen Kane Change\n\n717 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe Film Citizen Kane was a groundbreaking film in the 1940’s, the way Orson Wells depicts his film with different lighting, cinematography, choice of camera shots and mise-en-scene throughout this movie truly showed the masterpiece that this film is.

Music creates a build up until we see a body drop what looked like a snow globe or something, then it decrescendos to allow for the words to be mumbled out. In this intro if there were some type of cheery music going up to the caste it would not fit at all and would create an inaccurate idea of what may be about to happen or how the plot were to devolve in this movie.\n\nCitizen Kane's Citizen Kane: The Classic Hollywood Industry\n\n389 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThere are many things that make “Citizen Kane” considered as possibly one of the greatest films every made; to the eyes of the passive audience this film may not seem the most amazing, most people being accustomed to the classical Hollywood style, but to the audience with an eye for the complex, “Citizen Kane” breaks the traditional Hollywood mold and forges its own path for the better.

Citizen Kane broke all the rules because of Welles, there were no\n\nHe was also influenced by the moody, low-key photography of John Ford’s Stagecoach. Citizen Kane did not look like most American movies of its era. Each image was well thought out. No shot or sequence was taken lightly.
