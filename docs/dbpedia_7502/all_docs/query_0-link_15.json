        "text": "For its acolytes, Citizen Kane is simply the best.\n\nThe Orson Welles drama turns 75 this year, continues to be hailed by critics as the greatest movie ever made and gets a special screening Sunday at Los Angeles’ American Film Institute Festival (plus a new Blu-ray/DVD edition out Tuesday). That said, it doesn’t have anywhere near the mainstream reputation of beloved films such as Star Wars, The Godfather, Casablanca, Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz — all movies on the AFI’s list of the best 100 American films of all time, which Kane happens to top.\n\nKane, which stars Welles as Hearst-inspired media mogul Charles Foster Kane, was a personal favorite of famed critics Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, as well as President-elect Donald Trump. But for younger generations, Citizen Kane is a masterpiece they've likely never seen because it doesn’t play every holiday like It’s a Wonderful Life or flip as nostalgic a switch as Singin’ in the Rain.\n\nSo is it all that? Let’s say it lives up to its 100% positive Rotten Tomatoes score. Here are five ways Citizen Kane earns its “greatest ever” billing:\n\n1. Orson Welles broke the mold with his filmmaking.\n\nNon-linear storytelling is commonplace now but wasn’t commonplace in Hollywood circa 1941. Citizen Kane opens at Kane's super-palatial estate as he’s on his deathbed, uttering his mysterious final word: “Rosebud.” From there, the story is told in flashbacks as an investigative reporter (William Alland) interviews former colleagues, loved ones and other unreliable narrators to piece together the puzzle of Kane’s life.\n\n2. The Hollywood icon was also excellent in front of the camera.\n\nIn addition to directing Kane when he was just 25, the prodigious Welles does a terrific job of inhabiting the character from his mid-20s to his death, selling the newspaper magnate's rise and fall. There's no CGI here: It's all great makeup work and a master thespian. (Welles wasn't too shabby on a typewriter, either. He won his lone Academy Award for the Kane screenplay.)\n\n3. Kane set a precedent for important films about mass media.\n\nUnlike All the President’s Men or Spotlight, Citizen Kane takes a negative view of a high-profile newspaperman. As he builds his empire of Inquirer papers and radio networks, Kane engages in yellow journalism to sway public opinion on the Spanish-American War and take aim at his enemies. But a lack of journalistic integrity and an all-consuming job does considerable damage to his close relationships.\n\n4. The movie still finds a way to be culturally relevant.\n\n“If I hadn’t been very rich, I might have been a really great man,” Kane says, and the story of a rich icon and political contender using media to further his own power is all too topical after the recent presidential election. He has dreams of becoming president, though they’re dashed after a scandal deep-sixes his clear path to a gubernatorial victory — one that's ironically splashed across the front page of a newspaper.\n\n5. Welles did twist endings before they were cool.\n\nDecades before Haley Joel Osment saw dead people and Darth Vader revealed his parentage to Luke Skywalker, Citizen Kane pulled off the first huge cinematic swerve. Spoiler alert: Most think Rosebud refers to a woman in Kane’s life, but in fact the audience — and not the reporter — discovers that it’s a treasured sled dating back to the day Kane was taken away from his mother as a young child."
