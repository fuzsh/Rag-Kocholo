        "text": "Written by Natasha Pulley\n\nReview by Edward James\n\nI didn’t know they wrote books like this anymore: it is a good, old-fashioned Cold War thriller, with a secret Siberian research laboratory conducting sinister experiments, a massive nuclear disaster that has been covered up for seven years, a disaffected scientist, ruthless KGB men, lots of science and gadgetry, a complicated plot which travels at breakneck speed and a dramatic if somewhat implausible denouement. I don’t think there has been anything like it since Davidson’s Kolymsky Heights (1994).\n\nThe book is advertised as an historical adventure based on real events, which is true to the extent that the nuclear accident at the heart of the story did take place in 1957 and was not admitted until 1989 and the research facility was real and still exists, although as far as we know there were never any human radiation trials (but who knows what secrets are still buried in Siberia?). Otherwise all the characters and events are fictitious and, viewed dispassionately, the story is quite ridiculous. What makes you want to believe it are the characters, above all Valery Kolkhanov himself, the prisoner-scientist who is sent to work in the secret lab, and the KGB officer, Shenkov, who becomes his lover. There are also memorable minor characters, such as the pert little six-year-old girl dying of leukaemia.\n\nValery is no daring secret agent; he is a reclusive scientist who finds himself trapped in an inhuman situation which forces him to become a killer. This is a thriller with a moral dilemma at its heart."
