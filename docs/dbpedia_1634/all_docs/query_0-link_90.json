        "text": "British Heart Foundation is the official charity of the AJ Bell Great Run series this year and we could not be more proud.\n\nWhen you run for BHF, you can help us achieve our vision of a world free from the fear of heart and circulatory diseases. You run for the people you love. You run to help us fund lifesaving research and support people affected by heart and circulatory diseases. You run to help keep families together for longer.\n\nIt’s because of you, BHF-funded research is possible. Together, we can make the impossible possible. Thank you.\n\nJoin forces with the team that will get you to the finish line. We’re the only ones fighting over 200 cancer . Our life-saving work is funded entirely by the generosity of our supporters, so every step we make towards beating cancer relies on every pound, and every runner. One in two people now survive cancer. Together we’ve achieved so much, but we won’t stop until we’ve beaten it altogether. Join the team today and we will beat cancer.\n\nBy 2025, there will be 1 million people in the UK living with dementia. Alzheimer’s Society are there for everyone living with dementia and their loves ones – wherever they are, whatever they’re going through. We campaign for change, fund life-changing research and give help and hope to those living with dementia. Join team Alzheimer’s Society today.\n\nJoin an army of Team Christie supporters and put your best foot forward at Manchester’s biggest and best day of running!\n\nThe Christie is committed to revolutionising the fight against cancer by funding world reaching research, treatment and care, and education. With every step you take around the city centre streets you will be helping us to achieve our ultimate goal of a future without cancer.\n\nWhether it is your first or your fifteenth run, the extra-special atmosphere and Team Christie encouragement will ensure you never forget crossing that famous finish line. Be part of something special; choose The Christie!\n\nAt Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we’ve got. If you’re diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We will move mountains to help you live life as fully as you can. And we don’t stop there. We’re going all out to find ever better ways to help people with cancer, helping to bring forward the day when everyone gets life-transforming support from day one. We’re doing whatever it takes, but we couldn’t do what we do without you, thank you so much for your support.\n\nManchester Foundation Trust Charity supports continuing excellence in treatment, research and care in our family of hospitals across Manchester and Trafford, including Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.\n\nAs a charity our mission is simple: to support the excellence in treatment, research and care we provide to our patients each and every day. We want to make a real difference to the people we treat – young and old – by making sure that they continue to receive the very best treatment in the very best facilities. We do this by focussing our fundraising efforts on three key areas – treatment, research and care.\n\nWe’re Mind. We’re here to fight for mental health. We produce trusted information all about mental health problems. We support people through our helplines and online Side by Side community. We campaign with the government to get a better deal on mental health. And we speak out when something isn’t right, demanding mental health support respects our rights. There’s so much we do – and we couldn’t do it without you, so thank you.\n\nThe North West Air Ambulance Charity’s helicopters and HEMS response vehicles operate 365 days a year, with highly skilled specialist doctors and HEMS paramedics on board providing enhanced pre-hospital care and hospital transfers to patients across the entire North West region each year – an area covering 5,500 square miles and over 8 million people. The charity is completely reliant on public and corporate donations to keep the North West Air Ambulance Charity service operational and helping to save lives, needing to raise over £9.5 million a year to support its lifesaving service. For more information on the North West Air Ambulance Charity or to donate, please visit www.nwairambulance.org.uk or call 0800 587 4570.\n\nThe NSPCC are the Uk’s leading children’s charity and we are passionate about the work we do. We want to answer every call, reach every child when they need help, and keep adapting to whatever challenge is thrown at us.\n\nAround 90 per cent of our income comes from our supporters – people like you, who decide to take a stand and help protect children. Join the team today and together we can help keep children safe.\n\nEast Cheshire Hospice is a warm and welcoming space for adults facing life limiting illness. Providing care, comfort and compassionate support to patients and their loved ones is our number one priority. All of our services are provided free of charge to those who need them. However, only 17% of our funding is from the government and the remainder is donated by the communities we serve: Buxton, Congleton, High Legh, High Peak, Knutsford, Macclesfield, Poynton, Wilmslow and everywhere in between.\n\nSt Ann’s Hospice is a charity which cares for thousands of people across Greater Manchester with life-limiting illnesses every year. Around a third of St Ann’s funding comes from the NHS, the rest from donations and the kind support of people who raise money to help patients and their families. Every penny makes a real difference to those who really need it–right when they need it most. By running for the hospice and joining #TeamStAnn’s, you’ll have access training and nutrition advice, regular training runs and your very own running vest. Do something amazing, run for St Ann’s Hospice!\n\nWhen stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. And so does a part of you. Life changes instantly and recovery is tough. But the brain can adapt. Our specialist support, research and campaigning are only possible with the courage and determination of the stroke community. With more donations and support from you, we can rebuild even more lives. Rebuilding lives after stroke is a team effort and you’re a vital part of it. Join #TeamStroke and help us rebuild lives after stroke."
