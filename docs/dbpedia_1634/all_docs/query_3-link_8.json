        "text": "If you’re preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®) Step 1 exam, you might want to know which questions are most often missed by test-prep takers. Check out this example from Kaplan Medical, and read an expert explanation of the answer. Also check out all posts in this series.\n\nThe ultimate guide to succeeding in medical school\n\nGrow your leadership, advocacy and research skills and set yourself apart for residency with this helpful AMA guide.\n\nThis month’s stumper\n\nThis month’s stumper\n\nDuring an investigational study, the pharmacokinetics of a newly synthesized drug are studied in healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution and clearance determined in the first volunteer are 40 L and 2.0 L/hour, respectively.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely half-life of the drug in this volunteer?\n\nA. 2 hours.\n\nB. 6 hours.\n\nC. 14 hours.\n\nD. 20 hours.\n\nE. 28 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\nKaplan Medical explains why\n\nKaplan Medical explains why\n\nThe half-life (t1/2) of a drug is the time required for the amount of drug in the body or blood to fall by 50%. It is only applicable to drugs that exhibit first-order kinetics, in which a constant fraction of drug is eliminated per unit time as shown below. In zero-order kinetics, a constant amount of drug is eliminated per unit time.\n\nT1/2 can be determined if the clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (Vd) is known. Cl is the ratio of the rate of elimination of a drug to the concentration in the plasma (rate of elimination/plasma drug concentration). The Vd is the ratio of the amount of drug in the body to the drug concentration in the plasma (amount of drug in body/plasma drug concentration).\n\nThe half-life of a drug can be determined using the following equation:\n\nt1/2 = (0.7 times Vd) / Cl\n\nTherefore, t1/2 = (0.7 times 40L) / 2.0 L/hour, and t1/2 = 14 hours.\n\nNote: 0.7 is a commonly used log approximation, but not the actual value. Another commonly used approximation is 0.693 for -ln(0.5) = 0.69315.\n\nThe half-life determines the rate at which a drug concentration rises during a constant infusion and also the rate at which the concentration falls after drug administration is stopped. It is commonly accepted that it takes four to five half-lives to reach steady state, as shown in the figure to the right.\n\nSucceed in medical school with AMA benefits\n\nExclusive education programs & key study guides to help you thrive.\n\nAccess to JAMA Network™, ClassPass gym discounts & more!\n\nSupporting you today as a medical student.
