The tv series was produced by the BBC Channel, since the year 1963. After the telecast of each series on television, a number of authors began developing them in the form of novels. Each one of them started describing the television series in their own specific way, but kept the original theme of the series unchanged. All books in the Doctor Who series feature the adventures of time and space traveling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. He is described by the various authors as a Time Lord, who goes on to explore the whole of the universe with the help of his sentient time traveling spaceship known as the Tardis. After the publication of a few novels in the series, the future novels were clubbed in the form of a new series called as the ‘New Series Adventures’. The novels are often referred to by the short form of the series, the ‘NSAs’. They continue to relate to the long running BBC TV series of the science fiction genre. Most of the books are published by the BBC Books publication. Normally, two books are published in the series each year. The later novels of the series began getting published in section and are referred to as Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and the Twelfth Doctor novels respectively. With the Tenth Doctor Novels, a section of ‘Quick Reads’ books also began getting published, at least one of them every year. Except for the Quick Reads, all the other NSA books have been released in the form of hardcovers. They were later reprinted in the form of paperbacks. The paperbacks formed a part of the boxed collection to be exclusively sent to Tesco and The Book People. Some of the reprinted versions of the books depict the pictures of the novel companions from the cover, while some of the hardcover editions have been reprinted for amending the images of Rose on the covers.\n\nOne of the novel in the Doctor Who series was published under the title ‘The Clockwise Man’. This book was released by the BBC Books and was published in the year 2005. The novel is actually written by author Justin Richards based on the science fiction genre and features the main leads in the form of the Ninth Doctor as well as Rose Tyler. This book is the very first book in the line of the New Series Adventures and forms the debut original novel that featured the Ninth Doctor. The book also became the first one to be released as a hardcover edition since the middle years of the 1980s. In the plot of this book, it is shown that Rose Tyler and the Doctor undergo time travel and reach London during the time of the year 1924. They intended to go on a trip to the exhibition of the British Empire at that time, and instead they find themselves hunted by an inhuman and mysterious murderer. After a short while into their time traveling journey, the Doctor and Rose meet a cat that was able to come back from dead, meet a woman who always keeps her face hidden, and innocent people who seem unaware of the truth. During such testing times, both of them are required to solve the mystery as soon as possible in order to save the entire city of London from getting destroyed.\n\nWhen Rose Tyler and the Doctor arrive in London, they land their spaceship, the Tardis, in a scrapyard. While leaving Tardis, they hear someone shouting for help and the witness a man struggling to save his life from a third figure who disappears in the form of a shadow. The man, named Peter Dickson, is saved by Rose and the Doc. They come to that Peter works as a handyman and he had several marks around his neck caused by metal implement. After meeting the employers of Peter, they decide to head back to the Tardis, but when they reach at the scrapyard, they find that the Tardis is missing. After roaming onto the streets of London for a little while, the Doctor wonders if the disappearance of the Tardis was related to the previous night’s event. He and Rose decide to get back to the employer of Peter Dickson in order to ask them if they know anything about their space ship. When they arrive at he residence of Sir George and his wife Anna, they meet a masked woman named Melissa Heart. She appears to be delusional at first, but later helps them to find a hotel for spending the rest of the night. During the course of the book, the Doctor is seen indulging into a number of unwanted events that cause nothing more than trouble to him and Rose Tyler. In the end, they somehow manage to find the Tardis and fly back from there to a safe place.\n\nOne of the other original novel in the Doctor Who series was released under the title ‘The Monsters Inside’. This book was written by author Stephen Cole and is also based on the Doctor Who television series broadcast on BBC Channel. It was also published in the year 2005 and features the main characters Rose Tyler and the Ninth Doctor. The story of this novel shows that Rose and Doctor are taken to the Justicia System by their space ship Tardis. Later, they find that this system is actually a prison camp and comprises of 6 planets in its solar system. As they enter into the prison camp, they get separated and then trapped in a number of different environments. They show a great deal of determination in trying to escape from the prison camp and use their own distinct styles for doing so. But, their plans become complicated when a few of their older enemies show up in the middle of their struggle for freedom. During this whole time, the Doctor wonders whether the Siltheens are really trying to takeover the Justicia System or there is something more sinister happening in prison camp. Whatever it is that is happening around them, the Doctor and Tyler decide to get to the bottom of it and set the things right in the Justicia System before making an escape from there. This book was the first one among the Ninth Doctor novels that took place away from the Earth. Apart from the main characters, this book also features the one more family similar to the race of the Blathereen and the Slitheen living on the new planet."
