        "text": "'Trust the TARDIS...'\n\nRecuperating after the trauma of his recent regeneration, the Doctor falls foul of a final booby trap set by his arch-enemy, the Master.\n\nWhen he recovers, the disorientated Doctor looks in a mirror and sees the face of a stranger. He knows only that he is called 'the Doctor' - nothing more. But something deep inside tells him to trust the TARDIS, and his hands move over the controls of their own accord.\n\nThe TARDIS takes him to a strangely familiar junk-yard in late-nineties London, where he is flung into a confrontation between local drug-dealers and Samantha Jones, a rebellious teenager from Coal Hill School.\n\nBut the Doctor soon finds the TARDIS transporting him to various other places in order to recover all his memories - and that involves seeing seven familiar faces...\n\nIn the days when the Time Lords were young, their war with the Vampires cost trillions of lives on countless worlds. Now the Vampires have been sighted again, in San Francisco.\n\nSome want to coexist with humans, using genetic engineering in a macabre experiment to find a new source of blood. But some would rather go out in a blaze of glory - and UNIT's attempts to contain them could provoke another devastating war.\n\nThe Doctor strikes a dangerous bargain, but even he might not be able to keep the city from getting caught in the crossfire. While he finds himself caught in a web of old feuds and high tech schemes, his new companion Sam finds out just how deadly travelling with the Doctor can be.\n\nIt is London, 1894. Amid the fog, cold and degredation, a gruesome business is being conducted. The bodies of the dead are being stolen from their graves - men, women and children alike - for the sinister purpose of a very mysterious gentleman.\n\nWhen the Doctor and Sam arrive, they are witness to a horrifying scene in the evil-smelling fog: something rises up from the filthy waters of the Thames and devours a man - a man terrified for his life and on the run from the devil himself...\n\nTeaming up with an old friend, pathologies Professor George Litefoot, the Doctor is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. Together with Sam, they discover there is a far graver threat facing London than just earthly grave robbers. Deadly alien beings the Doctor has encountered before are at work, and they bring a whole new twist to the word 'bodysnatchers'...\n\nYears after leaving UNIT, Jo Grant receives a plea for help from an old acquanitance. A palaeontologist study of the earliest known humans is apparently under threat from a UNIT force led by a captain who does not officially exist. Investigating further, she begins to find herself out of her depth - and out of the twentieth century altogether...\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Sam visit Earth in 2109 - but there is no trace of the human race. Earth is the home of the Tractites, a peaceful race who have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years. Astonished and appalled, the Doctor travels back in time to see just what went wrong in Earth's pre-history.\n\nWhy have Jo and the expedition been taken back in time? Are the Tractites all they seem? Finally, separated from the TARDIS, the Doctor's last chance to put things right rests with Sam - but has even she turned against him?\n\nThe Doctor is repairing the TARDIS systems once again when it is swept up by a garbage ship roving through space, the Quetzel.\n\nWhen another ship approaches and takes the Quetzel by force, the Doctor discovers that he and Sam are not the only unwitting travellers on board - there is strangely familiar survival pod in the hold. Delani, the captain of the second ship, orders the pod to be opened. The Doctor is powerless to intervene as Davros is awakened once again.\n\nBut this is no out-and-out rescue of Davros. Delani and his crew are Thals, the sworn enemies of the Daleks. They intend to use Davros as a means to wipe out the Daleks, finally ridding the universe of the most aggressive, deadly race ever to exist. But Doctor is still worried. For there is a signal beacon inside the pod, and even now a Dalek ship is closing in...\n\nOn an island in the East Indies, in a lost city buried deep in the heart of the rainforest, agents of the most formidable powers in the galaxy are gathering. They have been invited there to bid for what could be the deadliest weapon ever created.\n\nWhen the Doctor and Sam arrive in the city, the Time Lord soon realises they've walked into the middle of the strangest auction in history - and what's on sale to the highest bidder is something more horrifying than the even the Doctor could have imagined, something that could change his life forever.\n\nAnd just when it seems things can't get any worse, the Doctor finds out who is on the guest list...\n\nKursaal is a pleasure world, a huge theme park for the Cronus system - or rather it will be if it isn't destroyed during construction.\n\nEco terrorists want the project halted to preserve vital archeological sites - areas containing the last remains of the long dead Jax, an ancient wolf-like race, whose remains are being buried beneath the big business tourist attractions.\n\nSam falls in with the environmentalists and finds her loyalties divided. Meanwhile, the Doctor's own investigations lead him to believe the Jax are not extinct after all.\n\nCut off from the TARDIS, separated from his companion and pursued for murder, the Doctor realises Kursaal hides a terrible secret - and that Sam is being affected by events more than anyone would guess...\n\nLanding in present day England, appears serene as the Doctor and Sam emerge from the TARDIS into the idyllic grounds of the Silver family's ancestral home. Only when they enter the house do they suspect things are not what they seem.\n\nHow far-reaching is the strange power of a secret society almost 700 years old, and how is it linked to the mysterious Station Nine? And what is the significance of a series of paintings that drove a man to suicide?\n\nFrom thirteenth century England to the former Soviet Union, from the United States to the cold wastes of space, the various strands of a complex plan come together and threaten to engulf the world in a nightmare of nuclear destruction..."
