Why are the native otters behaving so strangely, and what is the creature in the swamps that is so interested in the humans, and the new arrivals?\n\nThe Doctor and Martha must fight to ensure that human intelligence doesn't become the greatest danger of all.\n\nFeaturing the Tenth Doctor and Martha as played by David Tennant and Freema Agyeman in the hit Doctor Who series from BBC Television.",
