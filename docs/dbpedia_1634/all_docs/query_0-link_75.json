        "meta_description": "In the late 1960s mefloquine hydrochloride—more commonly known simply as mefloquine—was developed by Walter Reed Army Institute as part of the U.S. Army Antimalarial Drug Development Project. Phase I human tolerance and safety testing for the treatment of malaria began in 1972, and the first trials for its use as a prophylactic occurred in 1976 (Shanks, 1994). In 1976 a collaboration was formed with the U.S. Army, the World Health Organization (WHO), and Hoffmann-La Roche (the manufacturer) to further develop mefloquine. Mefloquine (trade name Lariam®) was first introduced to the market in February 1984 (Adamcova et al., 2015) and became generally available for European travelers in 1985 (Heimgartner, 1986). A new drug application for it was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986 and it was approved in 1989. The mefloquine dosing regimen for malaria prophylaxis begins with taking one tablet (250 mg salt in the United States or 228 mg base) once a week, starting two weeks prior to arriving in an endemic area, taking mefloquine weekly (allowing no more than 8 days to elapse) while in the endemic area, and continuing it for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area (CDC, n.d.). The once-per-week regimen is perceived to be convenient and is preferred for many individuals, such as long-term travelers and military personnel, as it reduces the amount of medication people have to carry and may require less vigilance to correctly adhere to prescription guidelines than daily malaria prophylactic drugs (e.g., doxycycline, primaquine, atovaquone/proguanil [A/P]) (Adshead, 2014).",

        "text": "Military and Veterans\n\nUsing DoD administrative databases, Eick-Cost et al. (2017) performed a retrospective cohort study among 367,840 active-duty service members who filled at least one prescription for an antimalarial drug for prophylaxis between 2008 and 2013: 36,538 were prescribed mefloquine, 318,421 doxycycline, and 12,881 A/P. The primary study objective was to assess and compare the risk of incident and recurrent International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)–coded neurologic and psychiatric outcomes (adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], psychoses, suicide ideation, paranoia, confusion, tinnitus, vertigo, convulsions, hallucinations, insomnia, and suicide) that were reported at medical care visits during concurrent use plus 365 days after the end of the prescription for mefloquine, doxycycline, and A/P. Although the authors did not report results for the period of ≥28 days post-cessation of antimalarial drug use, they stated that they performed several sensitivity analyses, including one in which the risk period was restricted to 30 days post-prescription. The results of that analysis were summarized in the text as follows: “However, none of these analyses significantly changed the results of the study and are therefore not reported” (p. 161). This statement implies (but does not show directly) that similar findings to those reported would be seen if the data were restricted to the period of relevance to the committee’s definition of persistence (i.e., ≥28 days after cessation of exposure). The committee was unsure how to interpret that sentence reporting that the results did not change significantly (statistical significance, precision of effect estimates, number of diagnoses, etc.), but given that the authors performed sensitivity analyses, the number of methodologic strengths, including strong measurement of relevant outcomes conducted in the target population, the committee chose to include it, despite the ambiguity in the language. If an individual had multiple prescriptions over the follow-up period, risk periods were merged. Doxycycline and A/P prescriptions were excluded if the service member previously or concurrently received mefloquine. Mefloquine risk periods were censored if an individual received a prescription for a different antimalarial. Analyses were stratified by deployment and psychiatric history. Models were adjusted for age, sex, service, grade, and year of prescription start; analyses of deployed service members also controlled for location and combat exposure. Mefloquine recipients had primarily served in the Air Force (58%), held a rank of senior enlisted (47%), and most had had prescriptions filled prior to 2010 (75%). Among the deployed service members, 29% of the individuals who had received mefloquine reported having had combat exposure (compared with 43% for doxycycline and 21% for A/P).\n\nWith few exceptions, adjusted incident rates were higher among the deployed than among the nondeployed for mefloquine as well as for the other antimalarial drugs considered. Effect estimates of neurologic and psychiatric outcomes for doxycycline and A/P are reported in those respective chapters. For mefloquine users the highest incident rates among both the deployed and nondeployed were for adjustment disorder (28.66 versus 18.75 per 1,000 person-years, respectively), followed by insomnia (15.78 versus 10.09 per 1,000 person-years, respectively) and anxiety disorder (14.51 versus 9.28 per 1,000 person-years, respectively). Incident depressive disorder (12.46 versus 8.59 per 1,000 person-years, respectively) and vertigo (12.19 versus 11.90 per 1,000 person-years, respectively) were also higher among the deployed group. The incidence of tinnitus, however, was higher among the nondeployed than among the deployed (14.02 versus 13.44 per 1,000 person-years, respectively) as was the case for convulsions, psychoses, suicide, and confusion. Among those prescribed mefloquine, the incidence rate of PTSD was 11.08 per 1,000 person-years in the deployed group and 5.05 per 1,000 person-years in the nondeployed group. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing mefloquine to doxycycline by deployment status found that among the deployed, the only statistically significant difference between the two drugs was for anxiety disorder (IRR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.01–1.24). When mefloquine and doxycycline users were compared among the nondeployed, the outcomes of adjustment disorder (IRR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.60–0.80), insomnia (IRR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.56–0.81), anxiety disorder (IRR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.57–0.86), depressive disorder (IRR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.55–0.84), vertigo (IRR = 0.52, 95%CI 0.31–0.88), and PTSD (IRR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.52–0.91) all showed a statistically significantly lower risk for mefloquine users but no differences were found for the other outcomes. Adjusted IRRs comparing mefloquine with A/P by deployment status found that the risk of tinnitus among both the deployed (IRR = 1.81, 95%CI 1.18–2.79) and the nondeployed (IRR = 1.51, 95%CI 1.13–2.03) was statistically significantly elevated among those taking mefloquine. No other outcomes were statistically significantly different between deployed mefloquine and A/P users. Among the nondeployed, the only other statistically significant difference between mefloquine and A/P users was for PTSD (IRR = 1.83, 95%CI 1.07–3.14). A subsequent analysis restricted the population to the first mefloquine or doxycycline prescription per individual and included individuals with a prior history of a neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis. Incidence rates and IRRs for each neurologic and psychiatric outcome were compared, stratified by those with and without a prior neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis. In total, 5.9% of those prescribed mefloquine and 9.2% of individuals prescribed doxycycline had had at least one neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis in the 365 days before the prescription, suggesting that those with a psychiatric disorder were less likely to be prescribed mefloquine, consistent with the contraindications of the drug. A diagnosis of PTSD was recorded for 131 (0.4%) individuals in the mefloquine group and for 2,671 (0.8%) individuals in the doxycycline group in the 365 days prior to the first antimalarial prescription. For both the mefloquine and doxycycline groups, individuals with a neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis in the year preceding the prescription had statistically significantly elevated risks for a subsequent diagnosis of the same condition for all conditions reported (adjustment disorder, anxiety, insomnia, depressive disorder, PTSD, tinnitus, vertigo, and convulsions) than individuals without a diagnosis in the prior year. However, when the IRRs contrasting mefloquine and doxycycline users were compared within strata of those with and without prior neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses, there were no statistically significant differences between mefloquine and doxycycline for any of the conditions, including PTSD (bootstrap RRR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.78–1.65).\n\nThe committee found this study to be well designed. Important factors that increased the study quality were the large sample size; the use of an administrative data source, which provides some degree of objectivity; and the careful consideration of potential confounding variables, including demographics, psychiatric history, and military characteristics of deployment and combat exposure. Because neurologic and psychiatric diagnoses occurring during current and recent use were analyzed together without distinguishing between events that occurred within 28 days of antimalarial use and those that occurred ≥28 days post-cessation, the study provides no quantitative information regarding the persistence of most events other than the notation in text that results did not change when restricted to the post-cessation period. The use of administrative data provided a standard, consistent method to capture filled prescriptions and medical diagnoses through the use of ICD-9-CM codes. However, filled prescriptions do not equate to adherence to the drug regimen. Moreover, if the antimalarials were provided to entire units as part of force health protection measures, the use of these drugs would not be coded in individual records. Whereas the use of medical diagnoses is likely to be more reliable for the outcomes than self-report, the data are dependent on the accuracy of the coding, and there was no validation of the diagnoses recorded in the administrative databases, and symptoms or events that did not result in a medical visit or diagnosis would have been missed. For PTSD diagnoses, there was no information about when the index trauma occurred. Given the largely decreased risks and null results reported for the study, this implies null results would be found for the period of interest, but the data were not presented to examine this directly.\n\nSchneiderman et al. (2018) conducted a retrospective observational analysis of self-reported health outcomes associated with use of antimalarial drugs in a cohort of U.S. veterans who had responded to the 2009–2011 National Health Study for a New Generation of U.S. Veterans (referred to as the NewGen Study). The NewGen Study is a population-based survey that sampled 30,000 veterans who had been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan between 2001 and 2008 and 30,000 nondeployed veterans who had served during the same time period; it included a 20% oversampling of women. The survey was conducted using mail, telephone, and web-based collection and yielded a response rate of only 34.3%. For this particular analysis, 19,487 participants were included who had self-reported their history of antimalarial medication use, and the use was grouped for the analysis by drug (mefloquine, chloroquine, doxycycline, primaquine, mefloquine in combination with other drugs, other antimalarials, and not specified) or no antimalarial use. Health outcomes were self-reported using standardized instruments: the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form (SF-12) for general health status, PTSD Checklist–Civilian version (PCL-C), and the Patient Health Questionnaire. These instruments yielded scores that were dichotomized for analysis on composite physical health, composite mental health (above or below the U.S. mean), PTSD (above or below screening cutoff), thoughts of death or self-harm, other anxiety disorders, and major depression. Potential confounders included in the multivariable analysis were the branch of service, sex, age, education, race/ethnicity, household income, employment status, marital status, and self-reported exposure to combat. Responses were weighted to account for survey non-response. Most veterans reported no antimalarial drug exposures (61.4%, n = 11,100), and these served as the referent group. Focusing first on those veterans who had been deployed (n = 12,456), of those who reported use of an antimalarial drug (n = 6,650), 307 (4.4% weighted) reported only using mefloquine, and 425 (6.0% weighted) reported using mefloquine and another antimalarial. Among the nondeployed (n = 7,031), 39 (2.2% weighted) used mefloquine alone, and 52 (2.8% weighted) used mefloquine and another antimalarial. The deployed mefloquine-plus-another-antimalarial users reported the highest prevalence of positive screens for PTSD (20.0%), other anxiety disorders (15.3%), and major depression (12.5%) compared with mefloquine alone and with the other antimalarial drug groups in the deployed and nondeployed strata. Descriptive statistics indicated that the deployed mefloquine users reported greater frequencies of mental health diagnoses than nondeployed mefloquine users—PTSD (14.2% versus 7.5%), other anxiety disorders (10.8% versus 5.7%), major depression (9.3% versus 3.3%), and thoughts of death or self-harm (14.0% versus 7.1%)—but no statistical inferences were presented. In the adjusted logistic regression models with all covariates considered (including demographics, deployment, and combat exposure), the use of mefloquine alone was not associated with an increased risk for any of the health outcomes when compared with nonuse of antimalarial drugs: composite mental health score (OR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.66–1.14), composite physical health score (OR = 0.96, 95%CI 0.73–1.26), PTSD (not adjusted for combat exposure) (OR = 0.86, 95%CI 0.58–1.27), thoughts of death or self-harm (OR = 1.21, 95%CI 0.80–1.82), other anxiety (OR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.49–1.22), and major depression (OR = 0.74, 95%CI 0.46–1.20). Results were similar and not statistically significant for mefloquine use in combination with other antimalarials for analyses restricted to the deployed subset of veterans. An additional analysis was performed on the six health indicators or outcomes stratified by antimalarial exposure and a four-level measure of combat exposure intensity. The weighted prevalence estimates seem to indicate an increasing prevalence of disorders with increasing combat exposure intensity, but it is challenging to interpret the results or to compare across antimalarial exposures given the small numbers in some cells and the lack of confidence intervals or hypothesis tests.\n\nThis analysis of the NewGen survey is highly relevant to the question of whether there are effects of mefloquine use that persist after the cessation of drug use. The study is large enough to generate moderately precise measures of association, the specific drugs were assessed, the outcomes were based on standardized instruments (although not face-to-face diagnostic interviews), important covariates of deployment and combat exposure were considered in addition to demographics and other military characteristics, and the data were appropriately analyzed. The number of mefloquine-only users in this sample was relatively small (346 of antimalarials users). It is noteworthy that adjustment for combat exposure consistently reduced the measures of association, potentially indicating the strong confounding that can exist due to combat exposure. Although the time period of drug use and the timing of health outcomes was not directly addressed, given that the populations were all veterans who had served between 2001 and 2008 and that the survey was not administered until 2009–2011, it is reasonable to assume that antimalarial drug use had ceased some time before. Nonetheless, the study could not address explicitly the health experiences during use and in specific time intervals following the cessation of use. There are a number of methodologic concerns that limit the strength of this study’s findings. The low response rate of 34% raises concerns of non-response bias, but responses were weighted to account for non-response. Selective participation by both antimalarial drug use history and health status would be required to introduce bias. The accuracy of self-reported antimalarial drug use in this population is unknown. Although self-reported information has some advantages over studies based on prescriptions in that the individual recalls using the drug, validation of the reported drug and information on adherence is not captured. Self-reported health experience is subject to the usual disadvantages of recall bias and bias of reporting subjective experience without independent expert assessment; however, by using standardized assessment tools, these biases may have been circumvented to some extent.\n\nThe Wells et al. study was commissioned in 2004 by the assistant secretary of defense in response to concerns within DoD about adverse health outcomes associated with the use of mefloquine (DoD, 2009a). Wells et al. (2006) used DoD administrative databases and a retrospective observational design to examine U.S. active-duty service members who had been prescribed mefloquine (minimum seven tablets) and deployed at some time in calendar year 2002 (n = 8,858). Their health experience was compared with that of U.S. service personnel assigned to Europe or Japan (n = 156,203), who did not use antimalarials. This comparison group was intended to control for being healthy enough to be stationed overseas, but this group was not considered to be “deployed” in the same manner as to an operational theater or combat zone. A second control group consisted of active-duty service members who were deployed for 1 month or longer during 2002 but had not been prescribed mefloquine or other commonly used antimalarial drugs (n = 232,381). Although the use of two comparison groups can be helpful when results are consistent, it is important that both are similar to the exposed group. The demographic and military characteristics of the Europe- and Japan-stationed individuals differed substantially from those of the deployed individuals. Health outcomes were based on hospitalization records within the military health care system and the corresponding ICD-9-CM codes for diagnoses by body system, including a number of physical and mental health conditions. The use of hospitalizations indicates adverse events of a greater severity for reported disorders than may be experienced by other populations of mefloquine users. The association between mefloquine exposure and hospitalization was analyzed through Cox proportional hazards modeling, with the follow-up time beginning on return from deployment (with or without mefloquine exposure). Adjustment was made for sex, age, race/ethnicity, service branch, marital status, rank, occupation, and history of hospitalization in 2001. Compared with those nondeployed service members who were assigned to Europe or Japan, those prescribed mefloquine during their deployment had a statistically significantly lower risk of hospitalization for any cause (HR = 0.47, 95%CI 0.39–0.56) as well as for reasons specific to the digestive system (HR = 0.52, 95%CI 0.34–0.79), for reasons specific to the respiratory system (HR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.23–0.86), for musculoskeletal disorders (HR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.47–0.98), for ill-defined conditions (HR = 0.24, 95%CI 0.16–0.37), and for injury and poisoning (HR = 0.63, 95%CI 0.47–0.84). No statistically significant differences were found between mefloquine users and those assigned to Europe or Japan for hospitalizations related to mental disorders (HR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.55–1.07) or for disorders of the nervous system (HR = 0.58, 95%CI 0.26–1.32), the circulatory system (HR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.31–1.18), blood and blood-forming organs (HR = 0.51, 95%CI 0.19–1.36), or skin and subcutaneous tissues (HR = 0.88, 95%CI 0.43–1.80). The hazard ratios comparing mefloquine users with deployed nonusers of antimalarials yielded null results across the range of all outcomes reported, including hospitalization for any cause (HR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.79–1.12), mental disorders (HR = 1.23, 95%CI 0.87–1.72), or disorders of the nervous system (HR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.34–1.73), digestive system (HR = 0.90, 95%CI 0.60–1.37), circulatory system (HR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.35–1.34), blood and blood-forming organs (HR = 0.65, 95%CI 0.24–1.74), or skin and subcutaneous tissues (HR = 1.31, 95%CI 0.64–2.69). Hospitalizations related to categories of infections; neoplasms; disorders of endocrine, nutritional, or metabolism; and disorders of the genitourinary system were also examined between mefloquine users and the two reference groups but none reached statistical significance. A total of 37 hospitalizations for mental disorders as a category were reported for mefloquine users, and when hospitalizations due to specific psychiatric outcomes were considered, there were no cases of somatoform disorders, 6 cases each of mood disorders and anxiety disorders, 1 case of PTSD, 19 cases of substance use disorders, 7 cases of personality disorders, 13 cases of adjustment reactions, 4 cases of mixed syndromes, and 20 cases of “other disorders” among mefloquine users. A comparison of these rates with those of the two reference groups of service members resulted in imprecise and null estimates. Only six hospitalizations due to nervous system disorders were reported for mefloquine users, and comparisons with both reference groups showed that mefloquine users had no statistically significant difference in risk for nervous system disorders as a group. When hospitalizations due to specific neurologic outcomes were considered, among those receiving mefloquine there were no cases of nystagmus or dizziness and giddiness, one case of vertiginous syndromes, and three cases of migraine, which resulted in wide, imprecise, and null effect estimates when these rates were compared with those of the two reference groups of service members. Deployed mefloquine users had numerically higher rates than deployed nonusers, but no comparisons reached statistical significance, and all effect estimates of individual diagnoses had less precision than when reported by organ system. For example, only one diagnosis of PTSD was reported in the mefloquine user group, compared with 29 diagnoses in the deployed nonuser group (HR = 1.66, 95%CI 0.21–12.85) and 38 diagnoses in the Europe/Japan group (HR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.11–5.91). The only statistically significant difference found between mefloquine users and those assigned to Europe or Japan was for mood disorders (HR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.15–0.90).\n\nOverall, this is a well-designed study that was likely adequately powered to detect moderate differences. Because the follow-up of the mefloquine users began at the time of their return from deployment, it is reasonable to assume that these results largely reflected their experiences following cessation of exposure of varying duration. Nonetheless, the results for varying time intervals following cessation of use (or time since return from deployment) were not presented. Although the use of two comparison groups can be helpful when the results are consistent, it is important that both be similar to the exposed group. The demographic and military characteristics of the Europe- and Japan-stationed individuals differed substantially from the deployed individuals, suggesting that this was not an appropriate comparison group. With regard to exposure, a prescription is not the same as having actually taken the drug or having taken it as indicated, creating the potential for misclassification. A reasonable set of covariates was used to adjust effect estimates, in particular the sociodemographic covariates. However, combat exposure was not specifically addressed, and although deployment may have been assumed to be a surrogate for combat, the lack of control for combat exposure itself is a limitation. The health outcomes were systematically and objectively ascertained but would reflect only the most severe experiences requiring hospitalization, and for this reason, the number of cases was generally small (i.e., 135 mefloquine users were hospitalized for any cause). Because the diagnoses were based on clinical encounters, the PTSD diagnoses are presumably linked to an index trauma criterion A event. Most people who experience mental health disorders would not be hospitalized, and the small number of specific neurologic and psychiatric cases reported further limits the generalizability of these results.\n\nTravelers\n\nThree retrospective observational studies of travelers (Meier et al., 2004; Schneider et al., 2013, 2014) were conducted using data from the UK-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD)—which has since changed names to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink—to assess the incidence and compare the odds of developing first-time neurologic, psychiatric, or eye disorders in individuals using mefloquine compared with other antimalarial drugs for malaria prophylaxis. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink, which has been active for more than 30 years, collects de-identified patient data from a network of general practitioner practices across the United Kingdom for use in public health research and clinical studies, which have included investigations of drug safety, the use of medications, health care delivery, and disease risk factors (CPRD, 2019). While the specific outcomes examined (neurologic, psychiatric, and eye disorders) differed by study, the general methodology was the same. Using the GPRD, investigators identified individuals who had at least one prescription for mefloquine, A/P, doxycycline, or chloroquine and/or proguanil in the time period of interest and who had a pre-travel consultation within 1 week of the date of the prescription that included specific codes indicating that the prescription was for malaria prophylaxis. The start of follow-up was the date of receipt of the first prescription for an individual. Current use was defined as the period between the date a prescription was started and 1 week after the end of the prescription period. Current exposure time was calculated differently for each antimalarial drug because the regimen for each of the antimalarial drugs differs. Investigators based their assessment on the number of tablets recorded by the general practitioner and calculated the assumed exposure time for each of the antimalarial drugs being investigated. For mefloquine, the current exposure time (in days) was the number of tablets multiplied by 7 plus 28 days. Investigators added 90 days to each exposure to capture events that occurred during travel that came to the attention of the general practitioner after the traveler returned to the United Kingdom; this timeframe was termed “recent use” in Meier et al. (2004). Recent use included periods both relevant to the committee’s charge (days 28–89) as well as time periods that the committee considered exclusionary (days 7–27). Past use started at day 90 (Meier et al., 2004) or day 91 (Schneider et al., 2013, 2014) and ended at a maximum of 540 days after the end of current exposure, reflecting a time period pertinent to the committee’s assessment. Non-exposed people served as controls and had no antimalarial prescription during the study period or during 540 days after their pre-travel consultation, which also served as the date of the start of their follow-up. Participants were required to have at least 12 months of information on prescribed drugs and medical diagnoses before the first prescription date for an antimalarial or, for the non-exposed controls, before their travel consultation. An additional inclusion criterion required participants to have recorded medical activity (diagnoses or drug prescriptions) after receiving a prescription to ensure that only individuals who returned to the United Kingdom were included. A nested case–control analysis was also performed for a subset of the population in which up to six controls (who did not develop an outcome of interest during follow-up) were randomly selected per case; controls were matched to cases on age, sex, general practice, and calendar time (by assigning each control to the same index date as their matched case).\n\nOverall, the design of these large, retrospective studies allowed for adequate power to detect differences in outcomes and for a uniform collection of exposures and outcomes that were not subject to recall bias. The nested case–control component allowed for the control of important covariates. Relying on recorded drug prescriptions to determine exposure ensured that the assessment was applied equally to all exposure groups; however, as with any study that relies on administrative databases, prescriptions are not a surrogate for adherence. Outcome assessment was uniform for all exposure groups and based on medical care visits coded in a database designed for both practice and research and with validated outcomes. Events that did not result in a medical care visit or that occurred outside of the national health care system would have been missed, and there may also have been some differences between the travelers who traveled to malaria-endemic areas versus areas that are not endemic for malaria, which could have led to some apparent differences in outcomes between the groups. However, it is unlikely that this would have resulted in differential selection bias. Additional strengths and limitations that are study specific are noted within each study summary.\n\nMeier et al. (2004) used the GPRD to assess the incidence of depression (n = 505), psychosis (n = 16), panic attacks (n = 57), and death by suicide (n = 2) in recent users (90 days following current use) of mefloquine compared with both current users (during active use) of proguanil and/or chloroquine or doxycycline and past users (90–540 days) of any of these antimalarials. The study population encompassed 35,370 individuals aged 17–79 years who used antimalarials between January 1990 and December 1999: 16,491 mefloquine users, 16,129 chloroquine and/or proguanil users, and 4,574 doxycycline users (some individuals used multiple drugs). Investigators calculated the incidence of the four prespecified psychiatric outcomes during current, recent, and past use (people with prior diagnoses of the four psychiatric outcomes or alcoholism were excluded), and they also performed a nested case–control analysis in which both cases and controls had no history of the outcomes of interest prior to use of an antimalarial. The incidence rates of first-time diagnoses were calculated using person-years and were adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year. The incidence rate of first-time depression diagnosis did not differ between recent mefloquine users and all past users of antimalarials (RR = 1.0, 95%CI 0.7–1.4). In the nested case–control analysis, there was no difference in the odds of depression between recent mefloquine users and all other users combined after adjustment for age, gender, year, general practice, smoking status, and BMI (OR = 0.7, 95%CI 0.5–1.1). Only one case of incident psychosis was reported with recent mefloquine use, resulting in imprecise effect estimates in both the incident rate analysis and the nested case–control analysis. Regarding panic attacks, the incidence rate of a first-time diagnosis was not statistically significantly different between recent users of mefloquine and past users of antimalarials (RR = 2.4, 95%CI 1.0–5.7). This result remained nonstatistically significant in the nested case–control analysis after adjustment for smoking status and BMI (OR = 2.3, 95%CI 0.8–6.1). For current users of mefloquine compared with all past users of antimalarials and adjusted for smoking status and BMI, the odds of panic attack were statistically significantly elevated (OR = 2.7, 95%CI 1.1–6.5). The authors estimated that one psychosis episode and three panic attack events could be expected per 6,700 mefloquine courses. This was a large retrospective study that found no increase in depression associated with current or recent use of mefloquine compared with use of proguanil/chloroquine or all past users of antimalarials. The sample size was more limited for studying panic attacks and psychosis, leading to very imprecise estimates for those outcomes. Since current and recent use were analyzed separately, persistent outcomes were difficult to determine.\n\nSchneider et al. (2013) used the GPRD to estimate the incidence of anxiety, stress-related disorders, or psychosis (n = 952); depression (n = 739); epilepsy (n = 86); or peripheral neuropathy (n = 56) in individuals (aged ≥ 1 year) with a pre-travel consultation and at least one prescription for mefloquine (n = 10,169), A/P (n = 28,502), or chloroquine and/or proguanil (n = 2,904) for malaria chemoprophylaxis, or no antimalarial prescription (but who had a travel consultation) (n = 41,573) between January 1, 2001, and October 1, 2009 (conducted approximately 10 years after Meier et al., 2004). Individuals were excluded if there was a record of a diagnosis of malaria prior to the start of antimalarial drug use; a history of cancer, alcoholism, or rheumatoid arthritis; or a diagnosis of an outcome of interest prior to a prescription for an antimalarial or, for the unexposed group, any of those diagnoses prior to the date of the pre-travel clinic visit. The date of the diagnosis of the first neurologic or psychiatric disorder was the index date for each case. Investigators estimated the incidence of the specified neurologic and psychiatric outcomes that occurred up to 540 days following current use of mefloquine compared with other antimalarials and with no use of antimalarials. Although 15.3% of the population was ≤18 years and the reported number of cases of each outcome was reported by age group, the authors presented only the associations between drugs and health outcomes for the total population (children and adults). Despite that limitation, the committee presents the results as reported because a relatively small proportion of the population was under age 18 years, and the results should approximate the associations that would have been found for adults only. The overall incidence rates for anxiety, stress-related disorders, or psychosis (presented as a group) and depression were lower for mefloquine users than for users of A/P, chloroquine and/or proguanil, or no antimalarial drug. A nested case–control analysis was also conducted in which investigators categorized subjects into current (use of drug plus 90 days post-cessation) or past-use (91–540 days post-cessation) exposure groups and controlled for age, sex, calendar time, general practice, smoking, and BMI. Individuals who did not develop the outcomes of interest during the follow-up period formed the control group, and six controls per case matched on sex, year of birth, general practice, and calendar time were selected. Over the study period, a total of 14 mefloquine users were diagnosed with incident epilepsy, 6 of whom were current users and 8 of whom were past users. Among the eight mefloquine users with incident neuropathies, five were current users and three were past users. A total of 99 mefloquine users (42 current users and 57 past users) were diagnosed with incident anxiety or stress-related disorders or psychosis, and 68 mefloquine users (16 current users and 52 past users) were diagnosed with incident depression. Comparing current users of mefloquine (which included a mixture of nonrelevant [during use to 27 days post-use] and relevant [days 28–90 post-use] time periods) with travelers who did not use any antimalarial prophylaxis, after adjustment for smoking and BMI, the odds of developing anxiety, stress-related disorders, or psychosis (OR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.53–1.08); epilepsy (OR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.32–2.20); or peripheral neuropathy (OR = 2.27, 95%CI 0.73–7.06) were no greater for current mefloquine users. Current mefloquine users had statistically significantly lower odds of developing depression than non-antimalarial users (OR = 0.32, 95%CI 0.19–0.54). The odds of developing anxiety, stress-related disorders, or psychosis (OR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.51–0.92) and depression (OR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.50–0.94) were statistically significantly lower in past users of mefloquine than in those who did not use an antimalarial, but the odds of epilepsy (OR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.27–1.40) and neuropathy (OR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.18–2.43) were no different. When anxiety, psychosis, phobia, and panic attack were analyzed as separate outcomes, the odds of anxiety were statistically significantly lower for mefloquine users (OR = 0.6, 95%CI 0.43–0.83) than for those who did not use antimalarials. Phobia and panic attack both showed decreased odds for mefloquine users compared with nonusers, but the findings were not statistically significant. Psychosis was elevated for mefloquine users compared with nonusers, but the effect was not statistically significant. However, these analyses were based on any use of mefloquine, and the use was not stratified on current or past exposure time.\n\nThis large, adequately powered study provides evidence of decreased odds of some neurologic and psychiatric adverse events in travelers prescribed mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis. However, the lower odds of anxiety and depression outcomes for mefloquine users versus the unexposed group suggests the possibility of uncontrolled confounding by contraindication. The comparison group consisted of travelers as well, but they may have traveled to non-malaria areas or had unmeasured risk factors that contraindicated antimalarial prophylaxis. The lower odds of adverse neurologic and psychiatric outcomes among mefloquine users in this study suggests that those prescribed mefloquine may have been screened more carefully for possible contraindications to mefloquine use. The 1-year medical history used to assess psychiatric conditions is unlikely to reflect a complete psychiatric history. Overall, this was a well-designed study that found no increase in anxiety, stress-related disorders, or psychosis (combined outcome), depression, epilepsy, or peripheral neuropathy associated with mefloquine use for malaria prophylaxis in travelers aged ≥1 year when assessing current use and 18 months following current use. The odds of developing anxiety, stress-related disorders, or psychosis (combined outcome) and the odds of developing depression were statistically significantly lower in past users of mefloquine than in those who did not use an antimalarial and the odds were not statistically significantly different among current users, suggesting that these psychiatric outcomes resolve and do not persist.\n\nUsing the same design and administrative database described by Schneider et al. (2013), Schneider et al. (2014) examined the incidence of clinical diagnoses of eye disorders (n = 652) in travelers aged ≥1 year with at least one prescription for mefloquine (n = 10,169), A/P (n = 28,502), or chloroquine and/or proguanil (n = 2,904) for malaria prophylaxis or no antimalarial prescription (but who had a pretravel consultation) (n = 41,573) between January 1, 2001, and October 1, 2009. Individuals were excluded if they had a diagnosis of malaria prior to the start of antimalarial drug use; had cancer, alcoholism, or rheumatoid arthritis; or had been diagnosed with an eye disorder of interest (any eye disorder affecting the cornea, lens, retina, uvea, iris, or other parts of the eye, or glaucoma). Because only 20 of the total 652 eye disorders occurred among people ≤17 years, although the number of users of each drug was not stratified by age, the committee presents the results as reported, and it does not believe that the interpretation of findings and inferences that can be made are overly influenced by the inclusion of people ≤17 years. Among mefloquine users, a total of 85 incident eye disorders were identified (23 within 90 days of finishing the prescription and 62 between 91 and 540 days of the end of the prescription). The eye disorders were grouped as disorders of the cornea, cataract, glaucoma, disorders of the retina, impairment in visual acuity, vitreous detachment, disorders of the uvea, or neuro-ophthalmologic disorders, with the latter including optic neuritis, diplopia, trigeminal neuralgia, and other conditions. Incidence rates were estimated for each eye disorder category by antimalarial group, but statistical comparisons between antimalarial user groups were not made. A nested case–control analysis was performed in which BMI and a history of depression, diabetes, hypertension, sleep disorders, and use of corticosteroids and contraceptives were controlled for. Compared with travelers who did not use any antimalarial drugs, the odds of developing any of the eye disorders of interest were elevated for mefloquine users combined (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.01–1.75). However, when mefloquine use was stratified by current (defined as use of drug plus 90 days post-cessation) and past use (91–540 days post-cessation) and compared with the nonusers, current users had nonstatistically significantly different odds (OR = 0.92, 95%CI 0.57–1.48) whereas past users had statistically significantly higher odds (OR = 1.56, 95%CI 1.14–2.14) of any of the eye disorders of interest, suggesting that the overall finding was driven by the association with past exposure. When each of the individual eye disorder categories was examined, only cataract was statistically significantly related to mefloquine use (both current and past use combined) (OR = 1.93, 95%CI 1.11–3.36).\n\nThe strengths and limitations of this study mirror those discussed in Schneider et al. (2013) and Meier et al. (2004). Although “current use” likely captured some events within the 28-day post-cessation window, it was unlikely to result in selection bias. The large study population allowed for adequate power to assess incident eye disorders as a whole as well as eight specific categories of disorders in travelers using mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis. The finding of an increased risk of cataracts with mefloquine use was unexpected and would require confirmatory evidence. Other risk factors for cataracts, such as occupation and sun exposure, were not included in the analysis and may have differed between the groups. Overall, the study suggests an increased risk of developing eye disorders in past users of mefloquine—and, for cataracts specifically, for any users of mefloquine—relative to nonusers of antimalarials.\n\nSchlagenhauf et al. (1996) conducted a prospective observational study of travelers to tropical Africa, all of whom had taken mefloquine for short-term malaria prophylaxis after visiting the Zurich University Vaccination Center between November 1992 and January 1994. The objective was to examine nonserious adverse events experienced during and following the use of mefloquine and to examine the association between adverse events and concentrations of racemic mefloquine, its enantiomers, and metabolite. Although study investigators did not make a traditional comparison between mefloquine exposed and unexposed groups, they did compare individuals who experienced adverse events with those who did not experience adverse events in the data analysis; thus, the committee included this study in their evaluation of the available scientific evidence. Of 420 recruited participants, complete data collection was available for 394 individuals. Participants were provided with mefloquine prophylaxis for the 2 weeks before travel, then during travel, and for 4 weeks after returning from their trips. Participants were interviewed and had blood drawn after beginning mefloquine prophylaxis but before travel and again after their return. As opposed to a list of symptoms, adverse events were reported in response to the interview question “How do you feel since you took the last tablet?” Only adverse events with some impact on activities were included in the study. Adverse events were classified as “neuropsychiatric” if they reflected sleep disturbances, dizziness/vertigo, headache, mood changes, unusual or vivid dreams, decreased concentration, or phobias. A total of 44 individuals experienced adverse events that affected activity, and 31 individuals (70.4% of those who experienced adverse events) experienced neuropsychiatric symptoms. Standardized instruments including computerized assessments of cognitive functioning (Neurobehavioral Evaluation System) and standardized self-report questionnaires assessing the severity of symptoms across body systems (Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire) and current mood state (Profile of Mood States) were administered to evaluate the neurologic and psychiatric adverse events. A subset of participants was assessed approximately 3 months after the last dose; it included only those participants who had experienced adverse events with some impact on activities along with a sex-, age-, and dosing-schedule-matched comparison group who had not experienced adverse events (controls). The results of the 3-month follow-up assessment are most relevant to the persistent effects of mefloquine since the other check points occurred while participants were still using the drug. Results from the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire and the Profile of Mood States found greater though nonclinically significant symptoms of dizziness, light headedness, distress, restlessness, and sleep disturbance as well as more intense moods of tension, depression, fatigue, and confusion at baseline, but at follow-up there were no significant differences between controls and those who experienced adverse events. The majority of the adverse events were mild and transitory and did not result in statistically significant differences in performance on standardized neurobehavioral tests. When the plasma concentrations and ratios of the SR:RS enantiomers were analyzed, there was no statistically significant difference between participants with and without adverse events. Similarly, mean concentrations of mefloquine and its metabolite did not differ between mefloquine users who reported and who did not report adverse events. Overall, this study provides some information pertinent to the persistent neurologic and psychiatric effects of mefloquine, suggesting that although there are some mild neurologic or psychiatric adverse events upon initiation of mefloquine, these symptoms tend to resolve by 3 months. The use of objective measures (blood draws) and standardized, validated tests are strengths of the exposure and outcome assessment. Adherence was also specifically considered and found to be above 80% for all age groups. The study has several limitations, including that all study subjects received mefloquine so that the relationship of symptoms to the drug is unknown due to the lack of an unexposed comparison group, the fact that the comparison group at the start of the study was not followed for 3 months as was the subgroup who had experienced adverse events, and that the number people who reported adverse events (which were based on self-report) was small. Only adverse events with some impact on activities were included in the study. In addition, the groups of participants undergoing the standardized tests was both small in number and select (range 37% to 80% of those eligible). For the comparisons that were made, the matching was incomplete, making the control for covariates very limited. The authors postulated that the adverse events reported may have been the product of the stress of travel or even naturally occurring experiences.\n\nSchwartz and Regev-Yochay (1999) performed a prospective observational study, and followed 158 Israeli male and female travelers aged 22–65 years who took part in rafting trips on the Omo River, Ethiopia, and who had visited a travel clinic to obtain malaria prophylaxis. Travelers were prescribed mefloquine (250 mg once weekly), primaquine, doxycycline, or hydroxychloroquine by travel group. The primary aim of the study was to assess incident malaria and to compare the effectiveness of these four antimalarial drugs against both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Travelers were followed from the time of their return to Israel for an average of 16.6 months (range 8–37 months) for incident malaria. Adherence to the prophylactic regimens and details about side effects were also collected by survey. The authors reported that “no severe side effects” were reported in any of the travelers and that no side effects or withdrawals were noted in the mefloquine users. The strengths of this study include its design and the long duration of follow-up (an average of 16.6 months after return from a malaria-endemic country). It is limited by its small sample size, nonrandomized design, and lack of details on adverse events beyond reporting that no severe events or withdrawals were reported among mefloquine users. As a result, this study provides limited information that can be used for inference."
