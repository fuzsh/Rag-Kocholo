        "text": "Welcome to Part 1, Hazing Deaths Database by Hank Nuwer\n\nHank Nuwer contact, bio:\n\nMy research has found one or more deaths a year occurred in U.S. each year from 1959 to 2021. No deaths in the U.S. were declared from hazing Beginning Jan. 1, 2022 through July, 2024. HN\n\nScholars: Visit and contribute your work to the Hank Nuwer hazing archives page at Buffalo State University (SUNY Hank Nuwer Hazing Research Collection): at https://library.buffalostate.edu/archives/nuwer\n\nWelcome to Part 1, Hazing Deaths Database by Hank Nuwer\n\nDisclosure: Schools and fraternities have not always admitted that clear cases of hazing are, in fact, “hazing.” In a few cases, there have been coverups. Therefore, the database includes deaths that appear to meet the consensus definition of criminal hazing, accidents while carrying out pledging or pledges being “encouraged” to drink, and suicides where parents believe hazing may have been a contributing factor. Many state laws take the position that hazing is considered hazing regardless of an individual’s willingness to participate.\n\n1) 1838\n\nFranklin Seminary (Kentucky)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nJohn Butler Groves died in a hazing incident, according to a family history. The school’s records were destroyed in an unrelated fire. This is the information I was able to come up with using public grave and ancestry searches–Moderator Hank Nuwer.\n\nA John B. Groves is listed as born October 31. 1819 in Simpson County, Kentucky. His death date is listed as August 7, 1838 in Franklin, Kentucky, Simpson County. He is listed as being buried in Groves Cemetery (likely a plot on family land).\n\nThe information was first reported in Hank Nuwer’s “Broken Pledges” (Longstreet Press, 1990). From a letter from a Groves descendent to Eileen Stevens, Committee to Halt Useless College Killings, that she let me read in 1989. The female letter writer (name withheld) wrote that John’s grieving family never sent another child to a similar school.\n\nUsing newspaper sources, I found a possible family member in Michael Groves who was born in the 1790s and died around or in December 1885 (The Big Sandy News; Louisa, KY, December 31, 1885). I do not know if they were related. Simpson County itself was carved out of other counties. The town of Franklin was located on a railroad line (making it appealing for parents to send children to such a seminary during the nineteenth century). Hazing at male and even female seminaries was common and even celebrated in printed school “customs books” that celebrated “traditions.”\n\n. Link to Franklin, Simpson County, Kentucky (in 1874 listing for one male seminary, one female seminary, six churches of various denominations). I found a seminary mentioned in the Laws of Kentucky for sale of the seminary land and building. HN\n\nKnow something more about John Butler Groves? Write the moderator.\n\n2) 1847\n\nAmherst College (Massachusetts)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nPresident Hitchcock, below, was one of the first USA college presidents to express opposition to hazing.\n\nJonathan D. Torrance died of illness following a drenching with iced water during a hazing custom called “freshman visitation,” according to then-President Edward Hitchcock of Amherst. The death is included in Nuwer’s Wrongs of Passage. See also article from Berkshire Eagle dated Nov. 5, 1863 clipping_15952902\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n3) 1873 Cornell University (New York)\n\nKappa Alpha Society\n\nWalkabout without torches in gorge country\n\nMortimer N. Leggett died in a fall into a steep gorge while on a walk in the dark required by fraternity members. Family claims that Leggett was blindfolded were disputed by the chapter in spite of admission by the perpetrators during a coroner’s inquiry. Leggett’s death is chronicled in an in-depth investigative feature in Hank Nuwer’s 2018 book “Hazing: Destroying Young Lives” (Indiana University Press). The first two Greek hazing deaths on record in the USA were Cornell KAS chapters (recently made dormant at that campus) in 1873 and 1899. Here is the video account of “Young Mort’s” death.\n\nGen. Leggett buried his namesake who was the first male to die pledging a fraternity. His son’s choice of chapter was the Kappa Alpha Society at Cornell.\n\n(Photo) The Charles W. Wason Collection at Cornell University was founded by the young hazer (Wason) who fell to earth with Mortimer Leggett.\n\n4) 1884\n\nUnited States Naval Academy, Annapolis\n\nAllegations of physical hazing\n\nFinal cause was alleged to be aggravated hernia.\n\nNewspapers prior to 1900 contained numerous references to hazing practices at Annapolis such as jamming a newcomer into a barrel and pushing while inside for great distances. The older cadets also tossed newcomers into the air on blankets. These were often done off-campus as soon as newcomer arrived in the area. Frederick Schwatka Strang was the subject of nationwide claims that his death of hernia complications was hazing-related.\n\nNote: (See #23 under disputed hazing deaths). 1885. I have removed a Hazleton, Pennsylvania school hazing in a gauntlet. I can confirm as a severe injury that made a boy “dangerously ill,” but almost certainly this was not a death. (Wikipedia on Feb. 13, 223 still lists this incorrectly as a definite hazing death of “Edward Turnbach” as a result of inaccurate news coverage in 1885.)\n\n5) 1892\n\nYale University (Connecticut)\n\nDelta Kappa Epsilon\n\nA blindfolded student named Wilkins Ruskin was killed in an accident in an initiation incident condemned then as outdated “criminal recklessness” by the national fraternity, according to a published article by Fred Kershner (now deceased), formerly of Columbia Teachers College and a fraternity member.\n\nPittsburgh Press, June 7, 1892\n\n6) 1894\n\nCornell University (New York)\n\nBystander death (deadly prank during class hazing)\n\nA non-Cornell bystander accidentally died during a class prank involving deliberate use of chlorine gas. The death of Mrs. Henrietta Jackson is chronicled in an in-depth investigative feature in Hank Nuwer’s 2018 book “Hazing: Destroying Young Lives” (Indiana University Press).\n\n7) 1898\n\nDecatur High School, Illinois\n\nHigh School Physical Hazing\n\nAccording to the Logansport Pharos-Tribune, freshman David C. Jones was one of several boys thrown over a fence. A battle royal ensued. Jones died a few days later of a spinal injury.\n\n8) 1899\n\nCornell University (New York)\n\nKappa Alpha Society (Now “dormant” Chapter)\n\nPledge Edward F. Berkeley drowned while completing a pledging errand. The death is described in the book Hazing edited by Hank Nuwer (2018). The 1899 death was by the same Cornell chapter and almost the exact ritual that killed Mortimer Leggett in 1873. While the father of Leggett forgave the hazers and even accepted KAS membership in his son’s memory, Berkeley’s father was bitter and unforgiving. Because Berkeley’s wife was in very poor health, the news was kept from her for quite some time. Like Leggett, courts at the time almost always considered only harsh physical hazing to actually BE hazing. Thus, the Leggett and Berkeley deaths were written off as unfortunate accidents. Cornell Kappa Society lost two pledges and hazers were judged blameless.\n\n9) 1899\n\nLawrenceville, New Jersey High School\n\nHazing (a form of physical hazing known locally as piling)\n\nMartin V. Bergen, son of Councilman Peter V. Bergen, of this place, died from injuries received at a hazing at Lawrenceville. He died of inflammation of the bowels. Young Bergen was twelve years old and a freshman at Lawrenceville. He was being put through the initiation when one of the hazers accidentally fell upon him. [Source: Columbus Daily Enquirer, November 23, 1899]; Harrisburg Telegraph, November 23, 1899]. View a clipping here\n\n10) 1900\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nClass Scrap with president present\n\nHugh C. Moore died following a snapped neck in a traditional fight between first- and second-year students. Click here for a very defensive student version of the death and a photo of Hugh Chadwick Moore.\n\nSee also Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, November 16, 1900.\n\nHenry Pritchett\n\nRead the remarks by President Henry Pritchett. He acknowledges being present at the sport where Moore died. “…No one is responsible and which no one could foresee” were his banal comments to console the student body after Mr. Moore’s death. A second student was also injured after being roughed up. However, to his credit, he ended the brutal “Cane Rush,” a type of class warfare.–Moderator Hank Nuwer\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nOrder The Hazing Reader by Hank Nuwer\n\n_______________________________________\n\n11) 1900\n\nUnited States Military Academy (New York)\n\nHazing\n\nAlthough the death of plebe Oscar Booz was considered illness-caused by a committee of inquiry, members of the U.S. House of Representatives on the committee determined that he also had been hazed maliciously by upperclassmen. He most certainly had been singled out for abuse, including forced to chug pure tabasco sauce. See “Broken Pledges: The Deadly Rite of Hazing” for a complete description of the abuse. Future general Douglas MacArthur was also savagely hazed.\n\n12) 1900\n\nCharleston, S. C\n\nPorter Military Academy (South Carolina)\n\nAccident during hazing.\n\nNo punishment despite death. “Charleston, S. C, Nov. 5. Thomas Finley Brown, 12, Is dead from injuries received while being hazed at tho Porter military academy last Monday. Brown was now at the academy and the older boys, following their former custom, dropped him Into a cemented swimming basin 12 feet deep. The basin was dry at the time and tho lad received internal injuries from the fall. Before he died he did not give the names of the cadets who had mistreated him, and It Is said no action will be taken In the matter.

Newspaper account link\n\n14) 1903\n\nBluffton High School (Indiana)\n\nSecret Society\n\nTen young men went on trial following the death of “L of S.S.B” recruit Ralph McBride. While McBride was hazed, his death of sepsis occurred five months later. A criminal trial failed to show the death definitely was linked to McBride’s hazing, according to the Indianapolis Journal of December 27, 1903.\n\n15) 1903\n\nBarton, Vermont\n\nBullying and Torture\n\nThree preteen males decided to pick on 9 year-old Ralph Canning by having him perform mock hazing acts such as sitting and standing on heated rocks. They then physically attacked and tortured him. Canning died of his injuries. The three were Alva Day, 11; Raymond Adams, 10; Raymond Waterman, 9. The boys told police they were trying to haze like college men.\n\n16) 1904\n\nRawson School (Findlay, Ohio)\n\nAlleged Schoolboy hazing\n\nI have confirmed that Freddie Fillwock died. A newspaper account reported that he suffered multiple injuries as a result of striking his head and subsequent piling on during an initiation. –Moderator. See online The Leavenworth Times, “Hazing Results in Death,” April 6, 1904. Headstone link.\n\n17) 1905\n\nKenyon College (Ohio)\n\nDelta Kappa Epsilon\n\nAccidental Death Following a Hazing\n\nStuart L. Pierson was struck by a train after fraternity brothers left him on a bridge in an incident called “a mystery death” by Kenyon historian George Franklin Smythe.\n\n18) 1905\n\nHigh School Hazing (Lima, Ohio)\n\nDeath following an initiation\n\nWilliam Taylor, 13, died of pneumonia following an episode where he was rough-housed outdoors in winter by older students.\n\n__________________________\n\nNote: UNDER FURTHER REVIEW: NOT INCLUDED: UNDER INVESTIGATION. Death of James Branch. 1905. Thus far, it appears Branch was killed in a fight with a fellow cadet, not a hazing-related death. –HN Feb. 13, 2023. Hazing certainly was frequent then, however.\n\n_________________\n\n19) 1906\n\nStanford University (Palo Alto, California)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nCaroline Miller, mother of student William Miller, alleged that her son’s death after a series of colds was caused by his immersion in water. This was called “tubbing” at the time. Source here\n\nFrom the above source, an excerpt: “The introduction of hall monitors did little to diminish hazing, which persisted even after the 1906 earthquake brought a sobering sense of propriety to the campus. That spring, freshman William Miller left school three weeks early because of a severe illness, and by June he was dead. He had been subjected to several episodes of tubbing, resulting in a series of colds, which his mother claimed contributed to his death by weakening his constitution. In a letter to President Jordan, Caroline Miller asked that tubbing be banned “and perhaps save other mothers the heartbreak that is my portion.'”\n\n20) 1906\n\nHilliard High School (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nThe New York Times reported that representatives of the family of Cecil F. Leat sued for $10,000 damages after he was beaten to death in a hazing. NYT Jan. 30, 1906\n\n___________________________________________________________21) 1906\n\nCulver Military Academy (Indiana)\n\nDisputed death, hazing or illness?\n\nA father claimed death of his son Edward Beery was caused by hazing. Although 13 members of the class were expelled, the school said it would never cover up and that the direct cause of death was tonsillitis.\n\n22) 1908\n\nWPI (Worcester Polytechnic Institute) Massachusetts\n\nFreshman-sophomore class hazing\n\nPittsburgh Post Gazette, September 29, 1908 “…A rush which took place on the evening of September 22, 1908, on the common, resulted in the death of Emil S. (Ernie) Grau [correct name is Gran], of Wareham, a member of the Class of 1911. [Gran] was caught under a struggling mass of students and suffered a fracture of the spine. He died Sunday, September 27th, and was buried in Wareham the following Wednesday, the entire class attending the funeral, together with representatives of other classes and of the faculty. As a result of this sad accident class rushes were given up and during the past years, the students by their own action, have abolished hazing.” In the 1911 yearbook there is a page dedicated to this student, with his photograph. His name there is written as Emil S. Gran and it says he died September 28, 1908. (However, the custom was started again soon after but called another name).\n\nA WPI yearbook entry above\n\n23) 1909\n\nWhite School (West Point, Indiana)\n\nHazing and retaliation (death from illness perhaps connected with abuse)\n\nAfter some bullies and hazers were reported, or thought to have been reported by Charles Stinson to a teacher who whipped them, the 11-year-old was hung upside down and left a long time to dangle. He died after his attackers came back. according to the Plymouth (IN) Tribune, March 25, 1909. The same article was reprinted in many USA newspapers.\n\nWhat is known: Stinson’s cause of death on his death certificate is listed as “spinal meningitis.”\n\n1900 Census records list then two-year-old Charles as the son of William M. Stinson and Effie Stinson.\n\n24) 1912\n\nUniversity of North Carolina\n\nClass hazing\n\nhttps://de.findagrave.com/memorial/17990613/isaac-william-rand/photo\n\nFreshman Isaac Rand bled to death following a stunt in which his throat was accidentally sliced by a broken bottle after he was made to dance on a barrel. Ralph W. Oldham, William L. Merriam, and Aubrey Hatch were found guilty of manslaughter. Originally sentenced to jail for work release, they eventually instead agreed to house arrest.\n\n25) 1913\n\nPurdue University (Indiana)\n\nClass hazing\n\nFrancis W. Obenchain died while participating in an annual scrap pitting first-year students against upperclass students. Newspaper accounts of the day and an official Purdue history have differing deductions for the death’s physical cause that occurred during the chaotic traditional battle under a water tank. A recent article for Traces Magazine (Indiana Historical Society) charged that there is evidence of a coverup back in 1913 as to the precise cause of Obenchain’s death. The entire story is told by a Purdue librarian in Hank Nuwer’s “Hazing: Destroying Young Lives” (1918).\n\n26) 1914\n\nSt. John’s Military College (Maryland)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nIn a switch, hazer William R. Bowlus was shot and killed while hazing a first-year student.\n\n27) 1915\n\nVirginia Military Institute\n\n“Rat” Hazing\n\nMilitary school hazing\n\nThurber Sweet, 17, died of serious injuries he claimed, before his death, had been caused by beatings with bayonets by older cadets. VMI superintendent E. W. Nichols denied hazing could have been a factor. The case was widely covered nationwide by newspapers.\n\n28) 1915\n\nUniversity of Kentucky\n\nClass Hazing-Related Accident\n\nFreshman Eldridge Scott Griffith was accidentally killed during a celebration over his class’s victory in a traditional class contest. Four others were injured.\n\nThe freshman was hit by a trolley while racing through the streets with a rope in hand, Griffith was 18.\n\n29) 1915 or 1916\n\nNew Mexico Military Institute\n\nClass hazing\n\nThe family of Ludwig Von Gerichten Jr. blamed his illness-related death on hazing after he was dunked in a horse tank and abandoned in the country, according to a family history. I am trying to determine if he is the young man from Franklin, Ohio, with this name, who was killed. More info needed when I can spend time on this death.\n\n30) 1916\n\nMorningside College (Iowa)\n\nFreshman hazing: Physical hazing\n\nNew student Paul N. Blue died as a result of extreme physical hazing and perhaps a pre-existing health condition, according to two newspaper sources provided by Wikipedia. Newspaper sources I checked said an inquiry found that diabetes was a contributing factor.\n\n31) 1916\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nFreshman-Sophomore battle royal\n\nSuffocation during school-approved annual “Bowl” brawl\n\nFirst-year student William Lifson smothered in a pileup in an annual matchup for a bowl awarded the winning class. Provost Smith, incredibly, said that Lifson died “in honor, with his hand on the bowl.” This is yet another example of how hazing was tolerated, perhaps condoned, at a North American college.Source The Republic of Columbus, Indana, dated February 18, 1916.\n\n32) 1917\n\nCollege of the City of New York\n\nPhi Sigma Kappa\n\nWilliam Ashcom Bullock died of spinal meningitis, and his mother attributed the cause to hazing because members rolled the already ill Bullock on the ground in a wet blanket.\n\n33) 1919\n\nColgate University (New York)\n\nClass hazing\n\nFreshman Frank McCullough drowned when he tried swimming to shore after sophomores dumped and abandoned him on an island. Here is a link to the school’s “traditions.”\n\n.\n\n34) 1921\n\nNorthwestern University (Illinois)\n\nCause of Death Unknown following a Class Hazing\n\nLeighton Mount disappeared after a traditional class rush, and his body was found beneath a pier two years later. His demise is a mystery. What is not a mystery is how Northwestern’s then president jumped on the theory of suicide in an attempt to protect his school’s reputation.\n\n35) 1922\n\nHamilton College (New York)\n\nClass Hazing (referred to as horseplay)\n\nWilliam Duncan Saunders, 15, died of a skull fracture and ruptured aorta when he was roughly flung from a bed during an incident variously described as horseplay unrelated to hazing and hazing. He was a member of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, but his chapter was not implicated in his demise.\n\n36) 1923\n\nUniversity of Alabama\n\nSigma Nu\n\nIllness following Initiation\n\nGlenn Kersh, who had a faulty heart, died “from psychic effects of excitement” following his fraternal initiation, according to the coroner’s report.\n\n37) 1923\n\nFranklin and Marshall College (Pennsylvania)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nSophomore Ainsworth Brown died while injured in a scrap between classes.\n\n38) 1923\n\nNorthwestern University (Illinois)\n\nClass Hazing\n\nLouis Aubere was accidentally killed by a passing car while on the running board of a car as he searched for fellow freshmen abducted by sophomores, according to a letter written by Northwestern archivist Patrick Quinn addressed to researcher Mike Moskos. Here is a clipping at the time:\n\n39) 1923\n\nNew Salem, Indiana\n\nHigh School Hazing-related Suicide (more likely to be called bullying in our own time–HN)\n\nThe parents of Vernon. A. Walker, 16, blamed his suicide by gunshot over a depression that enveloped him due to New salem School hazing. Rush County Superintendent Birney Farthing and Principal Grant Cooper challenged the theory that hazing caused Walker to take his life.\n\n40) 1924\n\nHartford City, Indiana\n\nHigh School Hazing\n\nDeath of a bystander\n\nRaymond Morris, 18, tried to intervene when a mob of hazers picked on his little brother, Benjamin, 14. Hazer William Duff, 17, challenged Raymond to fight. “Look put, I’m going to paste you a good one,” Raymond said, according to witnesses. He fell unconscious and was rushed to a hospital where he died. The coroner ruled Raymond died from a cerebral hemorrhage through accidental means.\n\n41) 1925\n\nUniversity of Utah\n\nFreshman class hazing: Immersion in water\n\nNewcomer Reginald Stringfellow’s death was believed to have been caused by prolonged duckings in tubs of water by upperclassmen. Utah finally outlawed the practice after his death, according to the Ogden Standard-Examiner (January 10, 1925).\n\n42) 1928\n\nUniversity of Texas\n\nDelta Kappa Epsilon Hazing\n\n“Nolt” is a typo for “Nolte” in the news clipping above.\n\nPledge Nolte McElroy, an athlete, died from the electric shock when he had to crawl through mattresses charged with electric current. The school response was to be expected. “It simply was a terrible accident that could not have been foreseen,” Texas Dean V. L. Moore told a reporter.\n\n43) 1929\n\nIndiana University\n\nDelta Chi\n\nIllness post Hazing\n\nOrsa George Steinmetz Jr., 19, died from lung disease after being physically hazed. The death was blamed by his mother on hazing, but cited as illness-related (coroner ruled death cased by pulmonary tb) by university then-administrators who nonetheless strongly condemned all acts of hazing. His mother became the first known parent of a hazing victim to become an activist. George’s brother corresponded with me during my research for “Broken Pledges: The Deadly Rite of Hazing.”\n\n44) 1929\n\nFlint, Michigan\n\nBoyhood hazing (likely bullying in today’s language)\n\nBlood poisoning due to injury Merrill A. Putnam, 8, died after older boys repeatedly slammed him to the ground in a prank they called the “Royal Bumps.”\n\n45) 1931\n\nStout Institute (Wisconsin)\n\nClass hazing: Physical contact; hazing horseplay\n\nFirst-year student Lloyd Neuman Aune of Baldwin, Wisconsin, died a painful death after his spinal cord was severed in a wrestling tussle. According to the Milwaukee Journal (September 18, 1931) Clifford Tweed admitted to being one of those grappling with Aune but denied knowing how the young man suffered a serious spine injury. The Journal noted that the student body voted to end all hazing.\n\n46) 1934\n\nOregon State University\n\nLambda Chi Alpha\n\nShooting death\n\nPaul Kutch was shot in the head in a so-called act of horseplay while dueling with revolvers thought to be unloaded.\n\n47) 1935\n\nDickinson College (Pennsylvania)\n\nPhi Delta Theta Fraternity hazing\n\nPhysical contact\n\nPhi Delt pledge Richard Wendell Beitzel was somehow severely injured in a fall and cut his leg on a tree stump, dying later of blood poisoning (nephritis). The Reading Eagle (April 19, 1935) said the college president banned all hazing as a result of the death. See especially Altoona Tribune, April 12, 1935.\n\n48) 1936 Death (Injury incurred in 1934)\n\nMiami-Dade High School\n\nIota Phi fraternity Physical hazing\n\nAccording to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune (February 25, 1936), sophomore Taylor Lewis succumbed of injuries incurred two years earlier in a hazing initiation.

(Hugo) Spake Jr. died by smothering following a drinking session mandated by a fraternity chapter unrecognized by the university. He likely was the first of many fraternity pledges or members to die from alcohol intoxication during an initiation, according to Hank Nuwer’s historical research. Ironically, Spake already was a brother of Kappa Sigma fraternity and returned to the Kappa Sigma house where he was discovered by two pledges on “wakeup” chores. See El Paso Times, March 11, 1940. See also the NY Daily News for investigation of Theta Nu Epsilon, dated March 31, 1940.\n\nPS: added June 2, 2017 It was not uncommon even 100-110 years ago or more for undergraduates at sundry colleges to appropriate the fraternal name of a national without permission, and then to besmirch that national’s name with loud and boorish or dangerous behavior. A prime example of this was a onetime national sophomore society called Theta Nu Epsilon. That organization had subrosa, unregulated, unauthorized chapters all over the country. Since it was a sophomore society, its members often or usually had additional membership in authorized nationals. So it was in March, 1940. that Hubert L. Spake, Jr, died in his sleep after an alcohol-fueled initiation for an unauthorized Theta Nu Epsilon chapter at the University of Missouri Kappa Sigma house. The Missouri Dean Albert Heckel shut down the unauthorized chapter after Spake choked to death on his own vomit. Prior to the death, the illicit chapter operated as a freewheeling chapter at Mizzou.\n\n52) 1941\n\nHighmore High School (S. D.)\n\nAthletic hazing, Lettermen’s Club:\n\nHazing by electrocution\n\nGerald De Gooyer, 20, a multi-sport athlete was killed by an initiation requiring him to sustain an electric shock.

Three were injured.\n\n54) 1943\n\nHigh school hazing and St. Norbert’s College (Wisconsin)\n\nHigh school hazing with college students present: Death from nephritis (but disputed by D.A.)\n\nWayne Rogers, assaulted by at least seven older students, died on his first day in a senior high school. He succumbed after his parents asserted the hazers had taken “indecent liberties” with him. The attending physician ruled he died of nephritis caused by a blow but District Attorney Elmer R. Honkamp dismissed any connection between Rogers’s death and hazing. Wayne’s parents expressed outrage.\n\n55) 1945\n\nSt. Louis University (Missouri)\n\nPhi Beta Pi\n\nFatal Accident During Hazing\n\nRobert G. Perry was turned into a human torch and died after members coated his naked body with flammable substances and applied an electric shock to his skin.\n\n56) 1948\n\nMontana State University\n\nLes Bouffons (The Clowns) Secret Society (local chapter)\n\nShooting by security guard during prank\n\nWar veteran James Peterson, a married father, was shot in the chest as he and 11 initiates of the local society attempted to break into a heating-plant building to set off a whistle as part of their initiation celebration. Peterson, 26, survived 38 air combat missions during World War Two, according to the Ogden Standard Examiner (April 5, 1948).

Niswonger was hit by a car as he slept on a highway after being dropped off from campus. ATO pledge Jerry Wendell escaped death but suffered a fractured arm. The driver of the semi who hit the boy was exonerated. The chapter was back pledging in one year. A coroner ruled the death accidental. They two had been blindfolded and sleep deprived. ATO member David E, Farley left school and enrolled at Midland College in Nebraska where he pledged KAI Fraternity. Col. William R. Dayton was a distinguished alum years before the accident.

Regarding 1952 and hazing, Univ. of North Carolina Sigma Chi pledge Charles W. Hill was on a “partying” road trip off campus. Hill was killed (two other pledges unhurt, one brother injured) when the car he was in missed a stop sign and collided with a lumber truck. Pledges were routinely served alcohol, according to a newspaper of the day, but the drinking age was 18, and it would be many years before alcohol routinely was looked at in hazing cases. Hazing WAS a hotbed topic at UNC in the spring of 1952, and the UNC IFC was accused of covering up hazing incidents. There was one near-death in question by another chapter.\n\nHowever, barring new information, 1952 remains a year without a confirmed death. –Hank Nuwer Posted Dec. 5, 2021.\n\n63) 1953\n\nMilligan College (Tennessee)\n\nFreshman class hazing: Required “games” of first-year students\n\nCalvin Dougherty, 17, a highly regarded basketball player from Johnson County, Indiana, died from the after-effects of internal injuries suffered when he slammed into a cable during a race mandated by upperclass students. A newspaper in Franklin, Indiana, followed his recovery, setback, and death in detail.

Bechtel, mocked for his dark, longish hair, went home and returned to campus with a revolver, .22 rifle, and 134 bullets, according to The Greenville News.\n\nBechtel, a student aiming to become a Unitarian minister, went to Wharton Hall, a residence hall, and ambushed tormentor Francis Holmes Strozier, a sophomore from Akron, Ohio. He shot him by the light of his flashlight with the rifle. “I had a rage against them,” Bechtel told police. “I felt they were persecuting me.” Bechtel raced about Wharton Hall as if berserk and fired several more shots until other Strozier’s roommate, Robert Witt, 19, subdued him.\n\nBechtel, a hall proctor who knew where his tormentors lived, tried to get into several locked rooms without success. Although newspapers widely characterized the death as bullying, the pranks themselves were more akin in today’s terms as a type of bullying. In a classic case of hidden harm, the tormentors had picked on Bechtel who came to Swarthmore after being discharged from the U.S. Air Force with a nervous breakdown. Bechtel was ruled insane and shipped to a mental hospital.\n\n66, 67) 1955\n\nNew Philadelphia, Ohio\n\nBoy Scouts of America Auto accident during blindfolded initiation march\n\nThe Ashbury (N.J.

The deceased killed by the registered nurses were Charlotte Smith and Kathleen Oehler. The act was certainly one of negligence but not in any way intended to be malicious. The ether was supposed to create a temporary feeling of numbness. The two perpetrators were severely burned beating out the flames. Source: Indiana (PA.)

He was likely not present at Swanson’s death. However, the tradition likely existed without a death when David Nelson was a pledge and member.\n\n76) 1959\n\nYakima High School (Washington State); Moxee School District\n\nMoxeee Letterman’s Club\n\nPaddling and dunking of new members wearing burlap sacks; under supervision of a coach\n\nHenry Allen Sherwood, Jr., the unlucky one of 16 initiates, drowned wearing a burlap sack after submitting to a paddling. Head football coach Donald L. (Don) Smith was present and overseeing the paddling and subsequent tragedy. School officials took no swift action in the week following the death, and Smith and up to 40 players were questioned by a prosecutor. As would be commonplace over time, the death was ruled accidental. The parents sued, lost, and won an appeal charging the Moxee school district with negligence that sent the case to trial.

The force of the impact disintegrated the vehicle into more than 100 pieces and made identification of bodies difficult. Four died in the accident that included one pledge and four senior members in the car. (The bus driver was unhurt, and no passengers were on board). Killed instantly were Harry Lamphier, Jr., 24, freshman William Gustafson, 18, William Kempfer, 19.\n\nJohn Pauls, 19, died later at a hospital.

Da Virro, a fellow pledge, who hit him in a speeding car. Ten pledges consumed at least two gallons of wine the night of the death. Members still maintain that the press overreacted to the death. Alcohol was a prime factor in the death. Jeffery was the son of Alden and Judith Long.\n\nThe fraternity previously was the scene of a 1973 party attended by more than 1,500 guests in which guest Patricia Cathaline (Cathi) Farish was raped and strangled by another party guest, Aden R. Trey Miller III, a farm worker, who killed himself in police custody.\n\nCharges against the members and pledges named below were dropped:\n\nLetter from chapter in local paper:\n\nHi! I was at Chico State the semester following the death of Jeffrey Long. I made the mistake of pledging Sigma Phi Epsilon in spring 1984. The house was right next to the Tau Gamma Theta house. I was able to piece together a bit of information in regards to that incident and hazing in general at that point. The TGs (Tau Gamma Theta), had no problem getting pledges the following semesters, until they were allowed campus recognition in fall 1985. The general feeling of most in the greek system was “it could have happened to any fraternity’. While true it could have, there was a lack of compassion or awareness to the death of someone. To put it another way, a complete indifference. The Inter Fraternity Council was made up often of junior actives, who were members of hazing fraternities, that viewed meetings as a waste of time, and did it as a way to earn their stripes so to speak. In other words a rather impotent entity. One fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, had a big brother little brother drink off, that always resulted in the pledges being sick for days after. They even made t-shirts for it. I quit the fraternity I was in, in disgust at the beginning of the next semester, as did a number of other guys in it. I have not come across a college where hazing is policed by the campus administration or any student government entity. I went back to Chico State in 1998 to pursue another degree. Hazing was still rampant, and the administration had nothing but cop out excuses when an incident took place. If you have read this far, thank you. I hope you can heighten the publics awareness that hazing still goes on. Neil Jones\n\nTau Gamma Theta also experienced the suicide of Benjamin Kovar in 2002, a fire caused by carelessness of members, and a fire started by an arsonist that destroyed the house. When former Chico President Paul Zingg announced fraternal reforms in 2006, he was opposed by the chapter’s alumni association.\n\n137) 1985\n\nUniversity of Colorado\n\nKappa Alpha Theta\n\nAlcohol-related pledging death\n\nUnder-aged pledge Sherri Ann Clark’s blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit when she fell to her death at a party sponsored by two sororities. Fraternity and sorority national executives then and now have defined giving alcohol to pledges to be a form of hazing, but Clark’s death at the time was classified as a non-hazing alcohol-related death. Alcohol was a factor in the death. Read about a prestigious scholarship established in her name to honor her memory by her family. John Bennett Rosen was the last to see her alive. Charges against Rosen were dropped.\n\n138) 1985\n\nUniversity of Missouri, Columbia\n\nLambda Chi Alpha\n\nAlcohol-related, pledging-related accident\n\nRushee Richard Allyn Butler, being driven home from a rush party by member Robert Sexe was killed in a car accident. Alcohol was a factor in the death. See Springfield News-Leader, October 4, 1985.\n\n139) 1986\n\nLamar University (Texas)\n\nOmega Psi Phi with involvement by non-member\n\nPhysical hazing\n\nPledge Harold Thomas, 25, died on a track of heart failure when a non-member in a fraternity shirt made him exercise. Authorities ruled the death non-hazing, but the incident sparked national interest in taking strong measures against renegade chapters and members. Thomas did not have the university-mandated grade-point average required for pledging eligibility. Alcohol was not a factor in the death. Overexertion led to death. A professor observed the abuse and failed to interfere or report.\n\n140) 1986\n\nUniversity of Texas\n\nPhi Kappa Psi\n\nAlcohol-related hazing\n\nMark Seeberger, 18, died with a blood-alcohol level of 0.43 when members gave him rum and beer. A Travis County grand jury refused to indict anyone. Alcohol was a factor in the death.\n\n141) 1987\n\nUniversity of Mississippi\n\nKappa Alpha Order\n\nAlcohol-related fall\n\nAlthough the death of Harry (Skip) Cline Jr., 18, was ruled an accidental, non-hazing death by university officials, it occurred after an annual drinking party at the house in which pledges were encouraged to drink.\n\nAlcohol was a factor in the death, according to Frank Hurdle who was student newspaper editor at the time. “Alcohol was definitely a factor in the death of Skip Cline, following a Big Brother/Little Brother in which pledges went around asking actives if they were their big brother. If no, they were offered a drink but not forced to drink. Cline passed out at the house and is estimated to have reached a BAC of .45. He woke the next morning and walked out the back exit and fell down the second-floor steps. BAC at that time I think was .24.”\n\n142) 1987\n\nUniversity of Arkansas\n\nPi Kappa Alpha\n\nAlcohol-related pledging death\n\nRushee Todd Alan Prince, an underage drinker, was killed outside a restroom by a passing vehicle during a fraternity hayride in which the chapter supplied alcohol. Alcohol was a factor in the death.\n\n143) 1987\n\nStanford University (California)\n\nZeta Psi\n\nAlcohol-related Rush accident\n\nRush chairman David Dunshee, 20, died during a fraternity party held on a lake. Alcohol was a factor in the death. Moderator: Here is a helpful note from a member of Zeta Psi edited only for length, not content.\n\nHi Hank. This email will likely sound like one of self-preservation or defense on behalf of my fraternity, but I am simply submitting it to you because I figured you’d appreciate it. I found the original article about the incident on the Stanford Daily archives: https:// stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi- bin/stanford?a=d&d= stanford19870427-01.2.2# Dunshee was a rush chairman. Although the party was a Rush event and alcohol was being served, and not being fully educated on the definitions in your area of study, I don’t really know if it falls under the category of a pledging-related death, though I can see that if having a rush event with alcohol is a precursor to any death then this incident could fall under that definition, even if it was not a pledge or a deliberate hazing incident.\n\nOf course, you will know best how to edit the current entry. It does sound like the Zetes in that day certainly took some actions which were harmful to others, and in one case pledges were found bound by hands and feet at a nearby horse stable.. how that encourages unity is beyond me.\n\nI’ll be reading more of your work in the coming weeks and I hope that you continue your fight along with the other groups working on policy change, so that we don’t hear these stories like the one at Penn State any longer. I feel fortunate that during my pledging process I was not subjected to anything like I have read on your website and elsewhere.. it makes me sick to my stomach thinking that a group of men all agreed at some point that some of these rituals are a good thing.\n\n144) 1988\n\nRutgers University (New Jersey)\n\nLambda Chi Alpha\n\nAlcohol-related Pledging Death\n\nPledge James Callahan died after members set up more than two hundred mixed drinks for he and other pledges to consume. Alcohol was primary cause of death.\n\nBelow: Central NJ Home News, Feb. 21, 1988\n\n145) 1988\n\nState University of New York at Albany\n\nTau Kappa Epsilon\n\nElectrocution during pre-initiation “cleansing” ritual\n\nSchool and law-enforcement officials ruled that hazing did not occur when pledges and members agreed to enter a lake that, unknown to them, was laced with an electric current due to a malfunctioning cable. Pledge Bryan Higgins died in the high-voltage death trap. Unknown to me whether alcohol was consumed in this episode.\n\n146) 1988\n\nUniversity of Richmond (Virginia)\n\nPi Kappa Alpha\n\nAccidental death during servitude\n\nMatthew S. McCoy, 18, died asleep at the wheel while on a pledge errand. A school official ruled the incident was non-hazing although such pledging errands were not permitted by the international fraternity. Alcohol was not cited in investigation of fatal accident.\n\n147) 1988\n\nUniversity of Texas\n\nDelta Tau Delta\n\nPledging-related Accidental Death\n\nMember Gregg Scott Phillips, 21, fell from a cliff while trying to escape pledges intent on tossing him fully clothed into a swimming pool. Unknown to me whether alcohol was consumed in this episode. Not mentioned in press coverage, however.\n\n148) 1988\n\nRider College (New Jersey), now Rider University\n\nTheta Chi\n\nPledging- and Alcohol-related Death (aka “pledge sneak”\n\nPledge Sean T. Hickey, 19, died in a car filled with pledges and a kidnapped chapter member. A 19-year-old driver received a one-year sentence for his reckless speeding at the time of the accident. Alcohol was cited in investigation of fatal accident.\n\n149) 1989\n\nMorehouse College (Georgia)\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha\n\nPhysical hazing\n\nPledge Joel Harris, 18, who had an enlarged heart, died after physical hazing. His death is covered in Nuwer’s “Broken Pledges.”\n\n.\n\n150) 1989\n\nDickinson College (Pennsylvania)\n\nAlpha Chi Rho\n\nPledging-related death\n\nRushee Steven Butterworth fell out a window to his death after consuming ten quick drinks at a rush party. The death was ruled accidental, not a hazing. Alcohol was cited in investigation of fatal accidental fall.\n\n151) 1990\n\nWestern Illinois University\n\nLacrosse Club\n\nAthletic hazing\n\nNick Haben, a non-drinker ordinarily, died from an alcohol overdose while participating in alcohol games for a school athletic club. Several members were convicted by the courts of serving alcohol to a minor. Alcohol was direct cause of death. Nick’s death is covered in “High School Hazing” (Scholastic) by Hank Nuwer.\n\n152) 1991\n\nUniversity of Missouri, Rolla\n\nSt. Pat’s Board\n\nAlcohol-related hazing\n\nMike Nisbet, 28, choked on his own vomit during a drinking initiation into a campus local club. Alcohol was direct cause of death.\n\n153) 1991\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nPhi Gamma Delta\n\nAlcohol-related pledging death\n\nPledge John Moncello, 18, came to the house when ordered even though he warned members he had been drinking. Unsteady, he fell to his death from a fire escape. Alcohol was a factor in the death.\n\n154) 1991\n\nTrinity University (Texas)\n\nTriniteers\n\nAlcohol-related Pledging Accident\n\nPledge Rolland C. Pederson died when struck by a car on the side of the road while headed to a pledge retreat. Even though alcohol was involved, the school ruled the incident merely violated its alcohol policy and was not hazing. Alcohol was present and a factor but unknown if it was primary cause of accident.\n\n155) 1992\n\nUniversity of Vermont\n\nSigma Phi Society Rush party\n\nAlcohol-related accidental death\n\nRushee Jonathan S. McNamara, 17, fell from a cliff when he lost his balance while on an outing with members of the chapter he wished to pledge. His blood-alcohol level was 0.125. Alcohol was present and a factor but unknown if it was primary cause of accident.\n\nDonations to the Jonathan S.

McNamara Memorial Scholarship Fund.” 100% of donations go to college-bound high school graduates of Vergennes Union High School.\n\n156) 1992\n\nUniversity of Virginia\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha\n\nPledging-related Accidental Death\n\nGrossly sleep-deprived pledge Gregory Batipps died at the wheel of a car. A county commonwealth attorney called the death accidental, but the victim’s father disputed that hazing had not occurred. Physical hazing led to the exhaustion, according to news stories then quoting the victim’s father, a doctor.\n\n157) 1992\n\nFrostburg State University (Maryland)\n\nPhi Sigma Kappa\n\nPledging-related death\n\nAn ill and exhausted J.B. (John B.) Joynt III died following a pledge sneak in which pledges rough-housed with members. The fraternity blamed the death on illness and argued that hazing had not occurred. No charges were filed, and police destroyed Joynt’s pledge book. Unknown to me if alcohol was a factor. Victim’s sister cited physical violence, not alcohol, during my interview with her.\n\nJ.B. Joynt III Memorial Scholarship\n\nThe recipient must be a full-time incoming freshman who is a graduate of Laurel High School, Laurel, MD.

His death is covered in “Wrongs of Passage” by Hank Nuwer. Pledges were dressed like Santa’s elves.\n\nAlcohol was a direct cause of death. Another pledge was injured when he fell out a window.\n\n159) 1993\n\nAlcorn State University (Mississippi)\n\nAlpha Phi Omega (inactive, banned chapter at the time)\n\nDeath During So-Called Prank\n\nLeslie Ware, 18, was shot at 1 a.m. on a school light while stealing a chair. He was shot by the boyfriend of the woman who owned the chair. The surviving pledges originally said they were procuring the chair for a member who requested it, but then retracted the claim to say they were pulling a prank on their own. I do not know if the shooter had been drinking at time of death. No press accounts mention alcohol or physical hazing.\n\n160) 1994\n\nBloomsburg University (Pennsylvania)\n\nDelta Chi\n\nAlcohol-Related Death of Member at Hell Night\n\nMember Terry Linn, 21, died following pledging Hell Night with a blood-alcohol count of 0.40.

He threw up and suffocated. His parents sued the chapter, labeling the activities hazing. The University of Iowa responded with a student alcohol awareness campaign funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\n165) 1996\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire\n\nAcacia\n\nAlcohol-related fall from roof\n\nAcacia was well known for its hazing practices and was on probation for 1991 hazing violations. Pledge Todd Cruikshank, 18, drank along with members and other pledges. The party continued on the roof and the intoxicated youth fell to his death.\n\nThe chapter at the time put the blame for the death of 18-year-old Todd Cruikshank in a roof fall on him, saying he like others in the house and above it had chosen to drink voluntarily.\n\n166) 1997\n\nTexas A & M\n\nPhi Gamma Delta\n\nAsthma attack during pledging activities\n\nA Brazos County grand jury brought no charges against members who soaked a pledge with water on a chilly January day. Although Trey Walker was cleaning the house, members insisted no hazing had occurred. Walker’s family argued hazing was a factor in his death.

Sanders and Brian Pearce died during a pledge and member outing in which alcohol was served pledges. Alcohol likely contributed to the two deaths. Brian died heroically died trying to locate Pearce. The national fraternity closed the chapter.\n\n169) 1997\n\nNorth Carolina State University\n\nTau Kappa Epsilon\n\nDrowning Following Initiation\n\nSteven Velazquez, 19, died when he and other members and new members dove into a lake for a traditional swim following the initiation of pledges. A 911 call reporting the accident said all had been “roughing around” when the death occurred. Hazing was denied by participants. Unknown if alcohol was a factor in drowning).\n\n170) 1997\n\nLouisiana State University\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon\n\nAlcohol-related Pledging death\n\nBenjamin Wynne, 20, died at the start of the LSU school year while celebrating his acceptance as a pledge. His alcohol level was nearly six times the legal limit. Alcohol was the cause of death.\n\n171) 1997\n\nClarkson University and State University of New York at Potsdam\n\nTheta Chi\n\nAlcohol-related hazing\n\nBinaya Oja, 17, died from alcohol intoxication on bid night. Alcohol was the cause of death.

Charges were filed against the chapter instead of members, and the chapter merely dissolved with little or no consequence to individuals. The school settled with Krueger’s parents for $6 million. Alcohol contributed significantly to the death. He was removed from life support due to alcohol-related damage to his body.\n\n173) 1998\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDelta Kappa Epsilon\n\nSuicide a possible link to hazing incident\n\nJohn Laduca, 18, a newly initiated member who had endured hazing but also had personal problems, killed himself in the house. The national fraternity said the personal problems, not hazing, contributed to Laduca’s suicide. Laduca’s family insisted the hazing and sleep deprivation might have clouded their son’s judgment. Unknown to me if alcohol was present during the suicide itself. Important Declaration: Although media accounts have linked suicides on this page to hazing, it is important for journalists and the public alike to recognize that depression is the most common link to suicides of all populations. I think it important to report when the parents of victims believe hazing is the cause and quote them accurately, but it is also important to note that it is one thing to note there is a huge difference between an alleged link between hazing/bullying and listing it as “the cause” of such deaths. I try to err on the side of caution. HN\n\n174) 1998\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nPhi Delta Theta and Chi Omega\n\nFall of Pledge out a window\n\nCourtney Cantor had a small amount of alcohol and possibly a date-rape drug in her system as she plunged from a dormitory to her death. In some ways, her death was a mystery in that her final movements were unknown. However, both national organizations strongly insist on alcohol-free pledging. Alcohol was present in the under-aged woman’s system\n\n.\n\n175) 1998\n\nUniversity of Mississippi\n\nSigma Chi\n\nSuicide\n\nDudley R. Moore IV died by hanging. He had been hazed prior to dying, but the family and university blamed personal problems, not the chapter, as the main cause for Moore’s actions. Unknown to me if alcohol was present during the suicide itself. Important Declaration: Although media accounts have linked suicides on this page to hazing, it is important for journalists and the public alike to recognize that depression is the most common link to suicides of all populations. I think it important to report when the parents of victims believe hazing is the cause and quote them accurately, but it is also important to note that it is one thing to note there is a huge difference between an alleged link between hazing/bullying and listing it as “the cause” of such deaths. I try to err on the side of caution. HN\n\n176) 1998\n\nUniversity of Texas\n\nPhi Kappa Sigma\n\nAlcohol-related death\n\nMember Jack L. Ivey, Jr., 23, died after pledges played a drinking game with him. His blood-alcohol level was 0.40. Alcohol was cause of death.\n\n177) 1999\n\nIona College (New York)\n\nSigma Tau Omega\n\nAlcohol-related death\n\nPledge Kevin Lawless, 18, died during pledging from an alcohol overdose.

A member found guilty of a felony had his conviction thrown out by a judge years after the trial.\n\n179) 1999\n\nUniversity of Richmond\n\nFirst-year class orientation tradition\n\nDrowning accident\n\nFirst-year student Donnie Lindsey Jr. drowned after jumping into a campus lake in an unsanctioned ritual following a university-sanctioned signing of the school’s honor code. No hazing charges were brought against event organizers. No mention of alcohol was in press coverage. It is unlikely given the circumstances, however. He was a star athlete and competent swimmer.\n\nContinued: See 2000 – 2021 U.S. Hazing Deaths, Hank Nuwer"
