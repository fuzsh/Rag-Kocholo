        "text": "Princess Beatrice’s ex-boyfriend Paolo Liuzzo was found with a deadly new street drug in his system when he overdosed in a Miami hotel room, according to a report.\n\nPaolo Liuzzo tested positive for ketamine, cocaine, fentanyl and a potent new depressant called bromazolam, according to his autopsy report, which was obtained by the Daily Mail.\n\nAccording to the outlet, more and more deaths across the US are happening as a result of a deadly concoction of fentanyl and bromazolam — called “benzo-dope.”\n\nThe toxic combination can “exacerbate” the respiratory system, according to a 2023 report by the National Library of Medicine.\n\nLiuzzo, who hailed from Woodbury, NY, succumbed to “acute combined drug toxicity,” the autopsy stated. He was 41.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment.\n\nMiami police were called to Liuzzo’s room at the luxe citizenM Miami Worldcenter Hotel at 3:22 p.m. on February 7.\n\nHe was pronounced dead 12 minutes later.\n\nLiuzzo’s body was transported from Miami, Fla., back to Long Island where a funeral was held on Feb 16.\n\nThe Italian native began dating Princess Beatrice in 2005 when she was 17 and he was 24.\n\nDespite the age difference, the pair’s relationship was approved by her parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson after they invited him to join the family on a skiing vacation in Verbier, Switzerland.\n\nBefore his romance with the Princess, Liuzzo was charged with the manslaughter of Jonathan R. Duchatellier, a fellow student at the College of the Holy Cross, after they got into a drunken fistfight.\n\nHis charge was later reduced to assault and battery and he served 100 hours of community service.\n\nHowever, when his romance with Beatrice went public, he was sent back to the US for violating his three-year probation, which was extended by six months.\n\nLiuzzo, thought to have inherited his fortune from his father, was employed as an art industry consultant at the time of his death.\n\nIn 2009, Liuzzo — who reportedly never married — had yet another run-in with the law after crashing his rental car in Australia’s Gold Coast.\n\nHe was later arrested and charged with fraud and cocaine possession after attempting to dine and dash at a casino.\n\nBeatrice, 35, has yet to comment on Liuzzo’s death.\n\nBeatrice ultimately wed entrepreneur Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July 2020. The pair share a 2-year-old daughter named Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nMozzi also shares son Christopher “Wolfie” Woolf, 6, with former girlfriend Dara Huang."
