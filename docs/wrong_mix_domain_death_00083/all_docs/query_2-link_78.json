        "text": "Jonathan Swift decided to write pre-emptively his own elegy fourteen years before his actual death. The poem, written in brisk and un-elegiac tetrameters starts with an epigraph from De La Rochefoucauld, which Swift translates in the opening lines of the poem: there is always something in the misfortune of our best friends which does not displease us. Of course it is true, he claims, because we are jealous by nature and can’t stand when our friends are more successful. And when we hear our friend groan with pain, aren’t we secretly thinking “better you than me”? Swift then, rather courageously, turns the brunt of satire against himself: of course I hate it, he says, when Pope and Gay are better poets than me, Arbuthnot a greater ironist, and Bolingbroke and Pulteney better political polemicists. This part ends with a paradoxical wish that the Fortune may send her gifts to his foes, but never to his friends: he can endure the former, but the latter really makes him angry. But this was just by the way of introduction and now the poem proper. He is nearing his death and he can already foresee how it can make his friends happy, although he cannot guess what they stand to gain by his death. He can imagine how they are going to be hypocritically sorry about his failing health and memory problems. Poor guy, they will say, he repeats the same stories over and over again. He now takes up with younger friends, who will put up with him and are willing to listen to his tales because he serves good wine, but he has to replace them with a new set every quarter because even they get bored. This was written eight years before Swift had to retire from his job and ten years before he had to have legal guardians appointed because of his dementia, but these lines are still chilling, despite their humorous tone. Did he already start to feel the first symptoms of the approaching dementia, I wonder?"
