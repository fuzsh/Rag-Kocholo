        "text": "III. SWIFT: THE MIDDLEMAN AND THE DEAN\n\nFrom Rhetoric to Fiction: The Drapier’s Letters\n\nSwift’s satire descends directly from the argumentative, highly rhetorical satire of Lucian. The many studies of Swift’s rhetoric attest to the fact that his satire is at least as argumentative as Lucian’s. Often, as in the Examiner essays or in a pamphlet like The Public Spirit of the Whigs, the element of anything we can call fiction is slight and incidental. Even Gulliver’s Travels, which does transform abstractions into an action, characters, and incidents, has a noticeably discursive quality: the progression is as often argumentative as dramatic. Swift arrives at his distinctive fiction through original and extremely complex devices of persuasion; accordingly, the surest way to approach his strategy is to take one of his most abstract and discursive works, The Drapier’s Letters (1724), and isolate the fictional elements that appear in it.1\n\nThese pamphlets in general take their form from the pamphlet they answer, argument for argument. Consistency is sacrificed to the debator’s art of winning points; sometimes the fiction is merely a decorative fringe upon an argumentative progression. In the first two letters, addressed to the common people of Ireland, the story-telling element is naturally strongest; in the third and fourth, addressed to the upper classes, the argument is logical and fairly abstract, the fictional element being saved as dessert till the end: in III the image of David and Goliath (Drapier versus William Wood), and in IV the consequences of Wood’s coinage (in the picture of hundreds of Walpole agents coming to Ireland to make the Irish eat his half-pence).\n\nSwift begins with the historical fact that Ireland needed small change but that the patent for producing and importing these coins (the famous Wood’s half-pence) was granted by the Whig government of Sir Robert Walpole to an Englishman, William Wood: the point being that the patent was sold to the highest—or most adroit—private bidder in England. Before Swift entered the fracas some of the polemical possibilities had already been exploited. James Maculla, writing in mid-August, 1723, seven months before the first Drapier pamphlet appeared, emphasizes the large quantity, with the accompanying unwieldiness, of Wood’s coins as a means of exchange, the shoddiness of the workmanship, and the consequent ease with which they could be counterfeited.2 If, as the vagueness of his patent hinted, Wood could make as many coins as he wanted, he could single-handedly destroy the economy of Ireland. Maculla’s conclusion is that “this Nation will be over-run therewith, if the publick are not on their Guard in the Taking such Coin, and also some speedy Remedy had to stop the vast Inundation which is flowing like a great Sea …” (pp. xix–xx). Already, with the image of a flood, a fiction is beginning to take shape: this is the chaos that corresponds to the civil war which is Dryden’s central symbol of evil consequences. It is not to our purpose to explore the question of whether or not these fears were justified, but from such assumptions Swift constructed a subtle and effective edifice which did not by any means rely exclusively on argument. His main purpose was to persuade the business classes of Ireland that they must not accept Wood’s coins. And by the same token, he had to persuade the government of England that they should not introduce the coins.\n\nThe idea suggested by Maculla is the one Swift develops in the first of the letters: what will happen given the amount and quality of the coins, and Wood’s right to import as many as he thinks fit? To answer this question, Swift has his supposed author, the Drapier, begin by describing a scene in an ale house with a soldier bullying the proprietor into taking his half-pence; and the shopkeeper, forced to accept Wood’s coin, has to charge ten times the ordinary price for goods. The Drapier summons up a series of such scenes, going down the line from the customer to the proprietor to the distributor to the farmer to the landlord, showing the whole structure of society being destroyed by the debased coinage: “we are all undone” is his refrain (p. 7). He has projected a series of nightmare images, a vision of civil chaos in the near future: squabbling soldiers, enormous loads of money needed to purchase the simplest necessities, tenants evicted and farms turned to grazing pastures; and behind all this the horror of the irrational—the single man who can assign any value he likes to money. “For then,” the Drapier says, “… we might be bound to take PEBBLE-STONES or Cockle-shells, or Stamped Leather for Current Coin, if ever we should happen to live under an ill PRINCE, who might likewise by the same Power make a Guinea pass for Ten Pounds, a Shilling for Twenty Shillings, and so on …” (p. 10).\n\nThe man who loosed this irrationality on the world, rather than the consequences themselves, is Swift’s center of attention. The William Wood Swift gives us is a little man (“a mean ordinary Man, a Hard-Ware Dealer”) who would set himself against the corporate good of a whole kingdom, both Ireland and England: “It would be very hard if all Ireland should be put into One Scale, and this sorry Fellow WOODS into the other, that Mr. WOODS should weigh down this whole Kingdom …” (p. 10). He is constantly (with diminishing adjectives attached to him) contrasted to “Our whole Parliament put together,” or “all the Kingdom” (p. 6); in Letter II, “one single, diminutive, insignificant, Mechanick” is put up against “a great Kingdom,” “the Entire Legislature,” and “the Properties of the whole Nation” (p. 24–25).\n\nThe implication is double: that Wood is a selfish individualist who would sacrifice a whole realm to his greed, and that he is alone. Swift’s aim (carried out primarily in Letter II) is to isolate Wood from the king, at the same time suggesting that behind him there are unscrupulous Whigs for whom he is, in effect, a mere catspaw. By separating him from power and authority, Swift turns Wood into an impotent threat and his project into an illusion. But as a tempter he remains dangerous, and Swift’s attack is thus in a sense on the crowd, the apathetic Irish public who are allowing this man to get away with his scheme when they do not have to. Without the king’s backing, Swift is careful to emphasize to the crowd, any such scheme can come to nothing. This line of development reaches its climax in the image of Wood as a housebreaker or highwayman (the appropriate image for Swift’s shopkeeper audience, as well as a reductive one for Wood): but significantly he is a highwayman without a firearm.\n\nIf an High-way-man meets you on the Road, you give him your Money to save your Life, but, God be thanked, Mr. Woods cannot touch a Hair of your Heads.… If a Madman should come to my Shop with an Handful of Dirt raked out of the Kennel, and offer it in payment for Ten Yards of Stuff, I would Pity or Laugh at him, or, if his Behaviour deserved it, Kick him out of my Doors (p. 29).\n\nWood is turned into a subject for contemptuous laughter: he is the puny evil that is apparently powerful—and is dangerous only so long as the people think he is powerful. And so Swift’s object is to show him as he really is.\n\nThrough equations, adjectives, metaphors, scattered references, and addresses to divergent groups of people, Swift gradually isolates and defines, or builds up an image of, a particular “William Wood”: it is not an individualized character, but it is a recognizable symbol around which the reader’s feelings (of fear, contempt, or even pity) are strongly realized. He is a man both dangerous and pathetic, both terrible and funny: and this mixture of response makes him memorable.\n\nThe consequences of Wood’s project are equally ambiguous. If they are shown to be terrible in the first letter, they become comic in Letter II, where Wood appears powerless to effect meaningful consequences. Here the social chaos has become merely the comic multiplicity of potential evil—an image of busy bungling:\n\nLet Mr. Woods and his Crew of Founders and Tinkers Coyn on till there is not an old Kettle left in the Kingdom, let them Coyn old Leather, Tobacco-pipe Clay or the Dirt in the Streets, and call their Trumpery by what Name they please from a Guinea to a Farthing, we are not under any Concern to know how he and his Tribe of Accomplices think fit to employ themselves (p. 22).\n\nAnd in Letter IV this becomes the preposterous image of Walpole’s agents, computed at 50,000, who must come over to Ireland to feed Wood’s coins to the Irish. Part of the image of chaotic consequences, then, is the fruitless busywork of the agents of chaos, just as part of the villain is his incompetence.\n\nThe fiction Swift creates thus revolves around a villain, William Wood; his project; the consequences of his project, which are made out to be the utter destruction of Ireland; and the people of Ireland, who, if they are not careful, can become Wood’s dupes.\n\nThe final element in the fiction is a speaker for the people of Ireland, M. B., Drapier, the first-person “author” who draws our attention to the character of the projector Wood and to the consequences of his project. The Drapier is Swift’s mouthpiece, the norm of his satire, and an appropriate one in that he is a middle-class Irishman (much more suitable than a Dean of the Church of England); he is an honest and respectable tradesman who will himself be affected by Wood’s coins. As Martin Price says, he is “prosperous enough to resist temptation … enough an Irishman to identify his interests with the kingdom’s.”3 His appeal begins as a sort of triumphant scoffing at Wood and shifts to an admission of the hopelessness of his task, of the crowd’s having indeed gone over to Wood, and of his own defeat. Even in Letter II, in the midst of the imagery of Wood as the one lone man against the whole world, we learn that the Drapier too is alone; he is doing his best to save the Irish, but they are all cold and indifferent (p. 28), and in Letter III, when the situation for Ireland has worsened, he pictures himself as the only person willing to meet the threat.\n\nSwift’s mimetic method follows directly from the old practice of answering the opponent’s argument point for point, where half of the pamphlet is quotation. Given the patent issued to Wood, Swift expands upon the implications that appear to him (overlooked by the authorities, though probably not by Walpole and Wood) until he has projected the image of national fiscal chaos.4 The more typical Swiftean strategy can be seen in the image of Walpole’s agents come to feed Wood’s coins to the Irish (Letter IV). This apparition arises not as a logically-computed outcome of Wood’s project but out of the mouth of Walpole himself. A pro-Irish pamphlet published in Bristol had Wood reporting Walpole’s saying that he “will cram this Brass down our Throats” (p. 85); and the Dublin Intelligence quotes Walpole as saying that “he could make them [the Irish] swallow it in Fireballs” (p. xli). Swift gives these words a life of their own so that they can redound upon their “maker,” who unconsciously exposes his real intentions toward the people of Ireland. The Drapier explores their implications in a story of\n\na Scotch-man, who receiving Sentence of Death, with all the Circumstances of Hanging, Beheading, Quartering, Embowelling and the like, cryed out, What need all this COOKERY; And I think we have Reason to ask the same Question; for if we believe Wood, here is a Dinner getting ready for us, and you see the Bill of Fare, and I am sorry the Drink was forgot, which might easily be supply’d with Melted Lead and Flaming Pitch (p. 85).\n\nThis then leads into the image of 50,000 English soldiers landing in Ireland with spoons to force-feed the Irish the coins and fireballs, “which, considering the Squeamishness of some Stomachs and the Peevishness of Young Children, is but reasonable” (p. 86). The resulting image is somewhere between torture and unpleasant doses of medicine; between the terrible and the ludicrous, the dangerous and the merely foolish.\n\nOne important level of the reality Swift constructs (and plays with) is this live, swimming, protean world of words becoming things and things generating scenes and actions. It is a short step from the pamphleteer who exaggerates his opponent’s arguments into their caricature to the satirist who steps back and allows the opponent to speak for himself, creating his own absurdities. He simply signs his pamphlet with the opponent’s name.\n\nIn his most audacious satire, A Tale of a Tub (1704), Swift attributes the origin of the imagery to the first-person speaker himself (a nameless Grub Street hack) and their elaboration is attributable to his “converting imagination” in the Puritan manner. Nor are his high-aspiring words mere gibberish or noise, as they are for Pope in The Dunciad: they reveal the speaker’s hidden thoughts, his secret intentions and motives. The fact that the exposition is beyond the intention and awareness of the speaker is also part of Swift’s point. Behind Cleveland’s conceits there was doubtless a conservative world view that acknowledged the authority of the past and the common response, as opposed to the ephemeral Puritan who pretended to such permanence. Swift is much more specifically Christian in his emphasis, relying on the same assumption seen in The Drapier’s Letters, that the evil agent attempts to pervert nature while Nature herself smiles unperturbed or quickly puts him in his place. In Swift’s mind this leads to the Lucianic first-person speaker who damns himself out of his own mouth. Nothing else is needed in this formulation: nature, or the good, is implicit in his self-condemnation. Moreover, the speaker’s inability to see the import of his own words merely emphasizes the fact that evil is, like Satan, ultimately a tool of God, part of a larger plan of which he is unaware.\n\nSwift’s first-person speakers are usually approached through his rhetoric, his use of ironic structures; and this is appropriate, because, unlike other examples of irony embodied in character—for example, Lazarillo de Tormes or Don Quixote—Swift’s speakers retain something of the superstructure. The degree of dramatization in Swift’s first-person satires is a question that has been debated at length and seems to depend on personal preference. The simplest view is that Swift is himself the satirist adopting a series of ironic poses, one minute blaming by praise and the next condemning without irony. The brilliance is entirely in the rhetoric and the effect is of Swift making a speech. Scott was not the last to remark Swift’s ability to “assume any character which he chose to personate.”5 This explanation fits many of Swift’s satires and points up the particular direction Swift takes toward dramatization. Nevertheless, when the point of view impersonated does not have the characteristics of the satirist, when it is maintained with some consistency, and when it is implemented by intimate details that do not fit the Dean of St. Patrick’s, the dramatic implications of the situation begin to take precedence over the rhetorical. The reader may or may not be aware of Swift’s presence behind the mask or that he holds the puppet strings. With Ebenezor Elliston or Isaac Bickerstaff, the intention is to trick the reader into thinking that he is reading a true confession and a true almanac. Indeed, Swift gives us more to go on with his “authors” than Defoe does with a narrator like Mrs. Bargrave’s neighbor who recounts the Apparition of Mrs. Veal; she is only a woman and a point of view, while the writer of the Tale of a Tub is a hack writer, lives in a garret, has had domestic troubles, and has spent time in Bedlam; and the Modest Proposer is a bourgeois, has a wife past childbearing, and his youngest child is nine years old. On the other hand, in most cases (the Bickerstaff Papers and Gulliver’s Travels are exceptions), Swift’s speaker is presenting an argument, not describing a scene. Our interest is not focused on his description of people but on the way his own mind operates—however clouded it may be by the diction, syntax, and clichés of the project-form in which he writes.\n\nThe device of the pseudo-author goes back to the Restoration. Dryden’s mock-heroic served to take a man at his own evaluation of himself: Shadwell thought he was as good as Ben Jonson or even Virgil. However, we never hear Shadwell saying this, only the satirist who places the real Shadwell in a world of Virgilian echoes. Denham, Butler, and some of the anonymous satirists of Rump Songs had followed the device toward its logical end, moving beyond the analogizing satirist toward the method of direct impersonation, but Swift went so far as to publish pamphlets and whole books that pretend to have been written by hacks, projectors, and astrologers.\n\nThe unique effect of Swift’s satires is partly owing to his preoccupation with what he considered subversive literary forms. He was not the first to sense in new literary trends a threat to old values or to equate literature with religion and government as part of a moral climate; Dryden had made clear the relationship between the moral and the literary in Mac Flecknoe when he showed the poetasters King Flecknoe and Prince Shadwell holding court on a stage in a ruinous part of London well known for its brothels. But in A Tale of a Tub Swift made literature the vehicle of his metaphor: his fiction, speaker, syntax, form, and general subject are first a reflection of current literary forms, and then—sometimes overtly, sometimes not—a reflection of religious, political, and moral solecisms. In an imitation of the book in which the author’s imagination supersedes principles or examples of order (and introductory chapters, indexes, and digressions overwhelm his book), Swift created his own version of the Achitophel who would overthrow the state to gain his private ends.\n\nSwift’s Version of the Tory Fiction\n\nAs Swift developed his own interpretation of the Augustan Tory assumptions, he constructed his typical fiction out of the following elements:\n\n(1) The “plot” has become the central element. It is a written work, a project, plan, scheme, or panacea, which the Grub Street Hack or Simon Wagstaff, or almost any of Swift’s “authors,” proposes and outlines in detail. Besides plausibility it gives Swift’s satires their form by offering an argument, a catalog of particulars or proofs, and a list of answers or reasons (as in An Argument against Abolishing Christianity or A Modest Proposal). The astrologer’s almanac of the Bickerstaff Papers is a similarly ideal vehicle with its long list of entries, and the rules of a conduct book (as in the Directions to Servants) is another. The critical and “literary” hack writing of the time offered an extremely flexible form with a place for everything from the chapbook tale to the Royal Society project, from footnotes to digressions.\n\nDryden expended his mimicry on the Bible, the Aeneid, and Paradise Lost, giving his villains a dignity which Swift denies his; Swift imitates the popular forms and idioms that have usurped their place, and his mock-heroic level is accordingly lower, more commonplace and contemporary. In his satiric impersonations this level becomes the prosaic projector’s talk of “the universal benefit of mankind” or of the “fair, cheap, and easy” proposal that will “deserve so well of the Publick [or be so “Beneficial to the Publick”], as to have [its author’s] Statue set up for a Preserver of the Nation.”6 The reality is the speaker’s economic motivation and the horrible plan itself that emerges from his words; the proposal for making the children of Ireland “sound and useful Members of the Commonwealth” is opposed to the reality of cooking them for profit.\n\nThe projector’s pamphlet therefore expresses Swift’s double aim: verisimilitude and a form for conveying the conscious and unconscious operations of a mind—proposals with a false semblance of reason and order, with paragraphs beginning “First,” “Therefore,” “In answer to,” and “It is further objected.” The very ordering and formalizing of raw thought expresses a certain kind of mind (still essentially Puritan) that wishes to mask reality with reason and rhetoric.\n\n(2) The purpose of the Swiftean “author’s” project is to implicate or catch the mindless crowd. When blame-by-praise irony is dramatized in a speaker, two elements result: a speaker who is foolishly but sincerely praising obvious follies—moderns’ large posteriors or the transience of their works; and an audience of people who can be persuaded to admire large posteriors. The pamphlet presupposes the audience to which it is ostensibly addressed and so a single wavelength on which author and audience communicate; it is crowd-oriented, aimed at their lowest, most restless instincts. One of Swift’s satiric assumptions is that the crowd, the ostensible audience of his ironic address, will read and accept the level of meaning that involves selling and cooking babies.\n\n(3) The hint of the good appears outside the fiction in the true audience of Swift’s ironic structure, those people with ordinary moral and intellectual awareness. And so inside the fiction it appears in the natural rectitude of language and logic. The reader acknowledges this when he accepts the eiron’s (Swift’s) level of meaning, as opposed to the persona’s illogical, extravagantly personal, and often mad meaning. Common sense, logic, ordinary meaning become the law of nature or of God against which the recalcitrant characters are revolting, and which is constantly reasserting itself.\n\nIf the ideal is partly an implied common sense, it is also planted concretely here and there in the text. In the Argument against Abolishing Christianity, the “author” remarks, “I have heard it affirmed for certain by some very old People, that the contrary Opinion [that is, that Christianity is meaningful] was even in their Memories as much in vogue as the other is now; and that a Project for the abolishing of Christianity would then have appeared as singular, and been thought as absurd, as it would be at this Time to write or discourse in its Defence” (italics mine).7 “Real Christianity” existed only, we are told, “in primitive Times” (p. 27).\n\nSwift’s foil to the image of evil is often complicated by the fact that he implies both an impossible ideal and a humanly possible norm. The original coat in the tale of the brothers (A Tale of a Tub), given by the father to his sons, cannot be recovered; the best that can be managed is Martin’s attempt to steer a middle course between Peter’s piling up of braid and Jack’s ripping of the coat’s fabric. Inevitably Martin’s coat retains the imperfections of some braid and some rents. By adding an ideal above and beyond the middle way, Swift reminds his readers who correspond to the norm that even they have little to be proud of. In the Argument against Abolishing Christianity the implicit advice to the reader is to retain or resurrect as much of “Real Christianity” as is consonant with present-day England (more, clearly, than the name).\n\n(4) The civil chaos that results from the plot or project takes two allied forms in Swift’s satire. First, it is the image of imminent destruction, which Pope was to enlarge upon in The Dunciad. In Swift’s early poem, The Ode to the Athenian Society, it is the Flood and the descent of the Goths on European civilization; A Tale of a Tub specifically invokes the English Civil War and the split in Christendom as the twin corruptions of politics and religion. In the projects, almanacs, and the like, however, this hypothetical scene in the future takes on a quite different form. The facts, reasons, explanations the projector gives us in his argument create a perfect, orderly anti-utopia in which a gentleman, when he wishes to propagate an heir, summons a clergyman (the only physically sound male left), and himself repairs with his mistress to the church for an assignation. Or he projects a world in which babies are sold at a year old for butchering, and so national revenues are enormously increased, prosperity reigns, and gourmets have a new delicacy. Poor tenants will have something valuable of their own (since their cattle are confiscated and money is “a Thing unknown”), and poor mothers will have eight shillings profit and no maintenance of children after their first year. Kindness and love settle over the land: seducers are now inclined to press for marriage, and when married they pamper their wives, not daring to kick them during pregnancy for fear of a miscarriage. Even mothers love their children and care for them almost as if they were calves.\n\nThis pseudo-utopia is, of course, based on a false order. A wonderful effect—the most orderly society imaginable—follows from the most appalling causes and motives. Rhetorically, however, the hypothetical situation usually takes the form of Horace’s Epode XVI, to which Swift alludes in the Argument against Abolishing Christianity: an impossible alternative, like sailing to the “blessed isles” with the whole population of Rome, which reveals the impossibility of the situation as it stands in Rome (or England or Ireland). In the Argument the nominal Christianity projected by the “author” points up the impossibility of living meaningfully without true Christianity. In A Modest Proposal the projected hypothetical situation first serves as a means of defining the speaker, becoming with him a symbol of the evil; second, it becomes a preposterous alternative which shows up the intolerable situation of human selfishness and indolence which makes this monstrous proposal the only feasible one—better, awful as it is, than the present situation. The Proposer suggests that the parents themselves be asked “Whether they would not at this Day think it is a great Happiness to have been sold for Food at a Year old, in the Manner I prescribe.”8\n\n(5) The evil agent himself, at his simplest, is the Earl of Wharton, the prototypical “liar” who is descended, Swift suggests, from the father of lies, Satan. He is the complete casuist, distributing lies “every Minute he speaks, and [which he] by an unparallelled Generosity forgets, and consequently contradicts the next half Hour.”9 Like Satan’s, Wharton’s “lies” are not permanent works but, being made for the minute, transient illusions quickly swept away. They are a mad exaltation of the moment at the expense of the substantial and permanent. The Devil can create nothing permanent or do any real damage. Nevertheless, as Swift insists, “if a lye be believed only for an hour, it hath done its work,” and some corruption of human value is possible.\n\nLike Wharton’s lies, modern writings posted one day cannot be found the next, and the very existence of modern writers “to the moment” is in doubt. The tailor and the spider are both immobile, completely alone, though presumably worshipped by moderns, and their only source of knowledge is within themselves. The tailor invents fashions of the moment, superseded as quickly as they appear, and the spider weaves his flimsy web out of his own guts. The spider has contact with no one or thing besides his own dirty surroundings; and the tailor is surrounded with sexual puns and imagery which connect him with sterility and impotence (Swift is playing upon the old saying: “It takes nine tailors to make a man”). The modern is completely alone, having no contact with others, even quarreling with his own kind, and is ultimately like the madman in Bedlam who (like the spider) feeds only on his own excrement.\n\nBut instead of accepting his ephemerality, which (as Swift himself recognizes in the Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift) is part of the human condition, the tailor, the spider, the Grub Street Hack, Peter, and Jack try to impose their ephemerality on others: each one forcing others to see things according to his own crazy view. The evil man is merely the ordinary man become proud of his very weakness and ephemerality, and anxious to fortify himself by imposing them on others. He is the man with the heavily braided coat who tries to make everyone he sees wear heavily braided coats, or the man with the tattered coat who tries to make the rest of the world tear up their coats.\n\n(6) Swift has gone beyond Dryden, focusing on the culprit without the intermediary of a normative satiric commentator. He does, however, reflect Dryden’s approach in a curious but significant way. Dryden’s satiric speaker (partly as a reaction against the satyr-satirist) was outside the object of attack but raised no questions about his own character because he ironically assumed the culprit’s own view, seeing him as he saw himself. But if this speaker of blame-by-praise irony is taken seriously (that is, fictionalized), he becomes a duped adherent of the culprit. Swift’s speakers are related to the unfictionalized ironic commentators of Mac Flecknoe and Absalom and Achitophel in that the satirist is still praising evil, but now his irony is completely embodied in a fiction. He is not the evil himself any more than Dryden’s praiser of evil was, but a combination of satirist and satiric object in a single speaker.\n\nSwift seldom shows his evil directly—only its reflection in his first-person “author.” As he makes abundantly clear in his “character” of the Earl of Wharton, such monsters are rarely encountered and require careful study when they do appear. Perhaps thinking of Wharton, he wrote in his Proposal for Correcting the English Language: “Satire is reckoned the easiest of all wit, but I take it to be otherwise in very bad times: for it is as hard to satirize well a man of distinguished vices, as to praise well a man of distinguished virtues. It is easy enough to do either to people of moderate characters.”10 Even a monster like William Wood in The Drapier’s Letters has a greater monster behind him, Walpole in England. In A Tale of a Tub the evil hovers offstage in the books of the moderns, in the shadowy figures of Bentley, Wotton, and others; it appears in the tale of the brothers in Peter and Jack; and in such symbols as the tailor and the spider. But all of this is reflected in the “author,” for he is most of the time reporting the moderns’ (as opposed to his own) views. He is a bungling adherent of the wicked who exposes himself and his models to the accompaniment of his laboriously unfolding argument.\n\nTo get at the peculiar quality of this figure, Swift’s dupe, we should look back at one of his classical sources, Horace’s Satire II.3.11 This satire, a remote relative of the satirist-satirized fiction and a source of the “Digression on Madness,” presents a stoic sermon on madness which draws attention to the fact that the people we conventionally think of as mad—spendthrifts or visionaries—are no crazier than their opposite extremes, the misers or hardheaded scoundrels we praise. The gist of Swift’s “Digression” is much the same: the kings who start wars, the fanatics who invent religions, and the philosophers who create systems are really no more in control of their wits than the inmates of Bedlam.12\n\nThe use of madness as a satiric touchstone is by no means unusual; but Swift also follows Horace in a more important particular, that of his structure. The stoic sermon in Horace’s satire does not stand alone. Horace has a ne’er-do-well named Damasippus recount (in effect, imitate) the words of a stoic named Stertinius. The recounted sermon is framed by a dialogue between Horace and Damasippus which places the sermon in perspective, casting satiric shafts upon both the stoic philosopher and his new disciple, Damasippus. In the frame dialogue we learn that Damasippus has failed in his crazy business ventures, is a laughingstock, and is on the point of committing suicide. Stertinius the stoic has tried to set his mind at rest by demonstrating in considerable detail that if Damasippus is mad (he has subtly shifted folly, or poor business sense, to madness), certainly so is everybody else: “Now learn why all, who have given you the name of madman, are quite as crazy as yourself.”13 As he ticks off the categories, he shows that literally everybody is in some sense mad. Stertinius proves his point; he uses madness as a satiric touchstone that reveals the irrationality in much supposedly normal behavior. He points out to Agamemnon (in an imaginary interview) that Ajax’s fury was less insane than Agamemnon’s own “reasonable” sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia, and that the man who accuses another of madness had better pause to question the rationality of his own behavior. On this level the satire operates as a generalized attack on man’s pride and his penchant for self-deception.\n\nBut as Stertinius’ examples accumulate, the initial truth of his commentary gives way to the reader’s realization that he is going too far—his demonstration itself becomes a kind of madness. The sermon ultimately embodies a satiric attack on the stoic philosopher who finds everybody mad except himself. However, even more important is the light the sermon throws on Damasippus. For him the stoic’s sermon is not so much an attack on man’s pride as a license for his own madness: “Such were the weapons which my friend Stertinius, eighth of the wise men, put in my hands, that no one thereafter might call me names with impunity.”14 Now Damasippus has a taunt he can fling back whenever he does something ridiculous. He has a device for reducing all human behavior to the level of his own folly.\n\nHorace expresses three points of view, three kinds of folly, in the sermon. First, Stertinius exposes our common madness. Second, Stertinius’ own intention is to show that only the stoic is sane, and he comes close to proving his own madness. And third, we hear his sermon secondhand, delivered by his convert Damasippus, who does not quite see through Stertinius’ apologia. Damasippus presents it as a defense of his own madness. This is essentially the form that Swift uses throughout A Tale of a Tub, where the Grub Street Hack is recounting the opinions of the moderns in an attempt to excuse his own failures and frustrations. He is giving us not original insights but those “of our illustrious Moderns” (p. 92), and behind him there always lurks the “modern” he is emulating. In the “Digression on Madness” he gives us a half-truth (or a satiric truth)—that all men are mad—followed by his own gradual self-exposure, and the reader’s growing awareness that this half-truth is an evasion and that the madness of mankind is not an adequate excuse for one’s own lunacy. The Hack tries to reduce all evil to a mental instability (ultimately to the effect of a vapor) and all people to his own level of erratic behavior. At the end he admits that he has spent some time in Bedlam himself, and all of the pieces fall into place: he has been reducing “the Notions of all Mankind, exactly to the same Length, and Breadth, and Height of his own,” gathering the rest of humanity into the fold of his own madness (p. 166).15\n\nFiltered through him the evil of “modernism” is less Satanic than Quixotic. As Satan rebels against God, Don Quixote, a somewhat lower, certainly more comic and ineffectual prototype, rebels against the commonplace world of windmills and sheep. The Grub Street Hack, like Quixote, has read all the wrong books and now sallies forth to act upon their assumptions. The actual evil being attacked lies behind him, as it did behind Quixote, in the books of modern philosophy and romance. The reader’s attention is on the little man who aspires upward and blunders into codes of behavior which he does not completely understand. But the Hack, a less sympathetic Quixote, is using the moderns to sanction his own weaknesses, just as Damasippus used the speech of Stertinius to sanction his folly.\n\nAs a Quixote, Swift’s dupe is also the madman who would try to change the world to suit his own limited vision, but constantly collides with hard realities which unhorse him. He serves as a reductio ad absurdum of Peter and Jack, the moderns and schismatics he imitates; for all of them are tilting against the real meanings of wills, the true nature of words or cloth, the hard sensuous reality of lampposts and cold, high garrets. The very fact that every evil agent is an individualist is expressed in this lone representative who has his own, slightly askew, slightly misunderstood plan (the moderns themselves, he tells us, have repudiated him).\n\nThe important points about Swift’s protagonist are his lack of originality and his relative sincerity—his obtuseness rather than hypocrisy. He descends from Absalom rather than Achitophel, the fool who wants to be king and, with the help of Achitophel, persuades himself that he is acting for the “benefit of mankind.” In this respect he also draws upon Molière’s Orgon, the foolish and incompetent pater familias who (like Horace’s Damasippus) is duped by the religious hypocrite Tartuffe because the doctrines Tartuffe offers give him the sanction he needs to tyrannize over his family. Lady Fidget and Sir Jasper in Wycherley’s The Country Wife stand in the same relation to Horner, who offers wives an opportunity to have lovers without losing their “honor,” and husbands an opportunity to appear free with their wives without any danger to their honor. Of the various dupes of Restoration comedy, the fop is probably the closest to Swift’s protagonist. The latter shares the fop’s unawareness, his dedication to the externals, and unconcern for the reality. Like the fop he is an outsider who apes the fine talk, clothes, and love-making of the true rake. Swift merely omits mention of the consequences to his dupes, although he implies them. He also omits all of the characters except the dupe and their reflection in his eyes.\n\nMost important, he omits the satirist. In Dryden the satirist accepted the premises of the fools and knaves, becoming, as a satirist, rather dim; in Swift the satirist has disappeared. The satire’s subject is an ambiguous figure, a Damasippus who is one part villain and one part satirist—a self-satirist as he unconsciously exposes himself and a Drydenesque satirist of others as he unconsciously exposes his models.\n\nAs a symbol, he is an intermediate figure who, by presenting soberly what he only half understands, allows us to distinguish between his own and a larger, more absolute evil of which he is an imitator or disciple. He is a middleman in the sense that he is a hack writer, a popularizer of other men’s ideas, and, to Swift’s thinking, a relatively new species (literary, political, economic, moral): the man who accrues his own profit by peddling the products of other people who are more clearly defined in terms of good and evil.\n\nHe stands between two extremes: on one side of him is the evil, on the other side the good, and the unsavory task he takes upon himself is to reconcile the two for his own profit. In An Argument against Abolishing Christianity he maintains a position between the evil (the abolishing of Christianity altogether) and the good (true Christianity), advocating nominal Christianity. In A Modest Proposal the speaker is trying to put a good face on the barbarism of the Irish and English treatment of Ireland. To one side of him is the selfishness of the English and the absentee Irish landowners, the economic motive that has produced the hopeless situation in Ireland; to the other is the idea of a plan for alleviating Ireland’s misery. The Proposer takes the savagery of the evil and combines it with the good intentions of the projects to produce a vicious compromise.\n\nIt should be noted that this situation is a parody of a structure ordinarily associated with Augustan satire—the Horatian dialectic with two opposite extremes, both evils, bracketing an inferential golden mean. Swift transforms the Horatian pose of fairness into a false dialectic employed by the speaker who tries to establish a middle way, not between the extremes of opposite excesses, but between the extremes of good and evil. His golden mean is at worst to attach the name of the good to the reality of the evil, at best to split the difference. The result is the Mac Flecknoe fiction, a parody of order and law.\n\nThe absolute evil, Swift implies, no longer speaks our language, and so we can get at it only through an intermediary—or it can only get at us in this way; but he would also say that not the real evil—which is rather easily seen—but the plausible appearance of reason and morality or even strength and order is the great danger. On the other hand, the evil we can cope with is human and commonplace. Every man is something of a Quixote or a Damasippus; only some men can submit to the controls of church and law and commonsense, as only some men can be outright knaves.\n\nDryden, like Furetière and other French equivalents, attacked the aspiring mind, but Swift is the first satirist to dramatize the vice at its source. While Dryden still attacks its consequences in civil war, Swift, significantly, makes the consequences hypothetical, part of a plan that is still on paper, suspended between the inventor’s brain and execution. He has to a startling extent taken the evil action from the external world, where it was in Dryden and remained in Pope, and located it in the human consciousness. The evil dramatized in The Modest Proposal is finally in the mind spinning its plans, or in the project itself, which is only a physical manifestation of the plans; the cooked and eaten babies are not in the objective world but in a projector’s hypothesis. The pathetic situation in Ireland is real enough, but the particular evil that Swift presents is the state of mind that allows the situation to exist and even hopes to make it yield a new source of income.\n\nAs a result of the new Lockean epistemology, Ernest Tuveson shows, “literature, from the eighteenth century on, has been drifting steadily toward contemplation of the world as seen by the mind rather than on ‘truth’ per se.”16 Swift was, of course, terribly concerned with this drift, and so he dramatized over and over “the world as seen by the mind,” with a scathing irony that made clear its moral error and so his own confidence in the reality of “truth” outside the mind. The very ephemerality of thought seemed to suggest to him the ephemerality of evil. And Locke’s picture of the mind supported his view. By producing the picture of a mind that can have no innate ideas, Locke showed that “no philosophy could clothe itself in an imprescriptible authority, for nothing is above the test of experience. The test, moreover, of common experience, and of the common, but alert mind.”17 Though Swift disagreed with the doctrine of the tabula rasa, he found in every other way a philosophy of mind suited to his satiric mission of attacking the reason that claimed too much for itself or that deceived itself.\n\nSwiftean Realism: The Bickerstaff Papers\n\nAs the example of the Damasippus situation showed, Swift’s effects are always means to the single end of ridiculing the morally reprehensible. However complex his fictions become, they are first persuasive structures, every detail making its satiric point, and only second (even incidentally, though it is this which sets off Swift from lesser satirists) profound explorations of certain areas of experience. In this section we shall examine some of Swift’s techniques and indicate their rhetorical purpose and their effect.\n\nBlack journalism, or the use of a pseudo-author, offers not only a satiric symbol but the real possibility that the reader will believe that a Puritan or hack writer is writing and unconsciously exposing his sinister motives. As his love of practical jokes and hoaxes shows, Swift seems always to have wished to achieve a kind of ambiguous status somewhere between acceptance as real and recognition as satire. In fact, the interplay of life and art that impinges upon a man’s actual existence seems to have been a favorite device of Swift and his circle.\n\nIn the most famous of these hoaxes an almanac maker, Isaac Bickerstaff, predicted the death of another almanac maker, John Partridge, down to the exact day and hour. When the day came a second pamphlet appeared announcing the fulfilment of the prophecy—Partridge’s death. The fact and the fiction almost merged: there was, of course, a John Partridge, and when Swift’s second pamphlet was published the account of his death was believed, to the extent that his name was struck from the rolls in Stationer’s Hall. Even Partridge himself was shaken: after his 1709 almanac he issued no other until 1714, and this did indeed prove to be his last; the following year Bickerstaff’s prophecy was fulfilled.18\n\nIt is interesting as a sign of the times that Swift was joined in the hoax by Rowe, Congreve, and others; the hoax expresses the insider’s scorn for the outsider and, conversely, a feeling of group solidarity. At its harshest it isolates the bore from society altogether, attempting to convince society that, like William Wood in The Drapier’s Letters, he is alone, against everyone and opposed by everyone or, like Partridge, he is dead.\n\nIn a broader sense, however, such hoaxes represented a strategy for conveying a sense of the real by destroying the distinction between real and fictional—the opposite of Cervantes’ practice of making the real more real by juxtaposing it with the obviously fictional. This was not a new strategy, but one well explored, like so many of the Augustans’ techniques, by the early humanist satirists. The Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum (1515) was published so as to appear to be the New Learning’s reply to Reuchlin’s Clarorum Virorum Epistolae of the preceding year; each correspondent exposed himself, unselfconsciously, in all his “doltishness, pedantry, and, it must be added, immorality.”19 And in the seventeenth century Pascal used the same technique in his Provincial Letters. These works, unlike Erasmus’ Praise of Folly, or the imitations of Denham and Butler, make claims to be taken as the works of real, live people.\n\nDefoe of course produced such works, sometimes with specifically polemical if not satiric intent (The Shortest Way with the Dissenters [1702]), and sometimes with no other aim than to convince of the reality of author, book, and story. Steele’s misinterpretation of the Epistolae, an edition of which had been dedicated to him,20 though partly due to reading a work out of its historical and polemical context, showed that Defoe, Swift, and Pope were all writing to a pluralistic audience, a large part of which could (or must) be counted upon to accept the literal level. This made for some very curious effects; but also in Defoe, if not in Swift, for the possibility that the rhetorical aim of persuasion will become subordinated to the aim of simply portraying reality convincingly. At any rate, the members of the Scriblerus Club persisted in producing such first-person narratives that were intended to pass for fact in bookstalls where they rubbed shoulders with Defoe’s latest authentic criminal memoir. The Scriblerians’ use of illusionistic documents—forged projects, confessions, and travel memoirs—suggests the paradox that as satire increases in rhetorical effectiveness it draws less and less attention to itself as satire; ultimately the most effective satire (given its generic aims) would be the one that passed as something else. (The reader’s knowledge that he is reading satire makes him more aware of formal matters and less concerned about combating evil.)\n\nThe ideal hoax is one in which no reader—no one but the satirist and his friends—can with certainty tell fact from fiction. Thus in Swift’s Ebenezor Elliston hoax of 1722 the “genuine” “Dying Statement” of the condemned criminal was advertised in Dublin newspapers, and Swift’s pseudo-document was put into circulation at exactly the same time as Elliston’s own, as he was on his way to the gallows. The public at the execution could have accepted Swift’s as the real one, and Elliston himself (who was doubtless indignant hearing a rival “Dying Statement” hawked) was shortly in no condition to prove which was genuine. The Swiftean statement included the fact that Elliston had left a list of his confederates in crime which was to be given to the authorities if they did not give up their robbing and killing. According to Scott, Swift’s realism had its desired effect, and the crime rate in Dublin went down.21\n\nSwift’s friend and confederate, Alexander Pope, also liked to create an event on paper that was meant to have happened in fact, or even to carry out a fact that could then be recorded and embellished on paper. In either case the physical condition of the enemy was worked upon (fictionally or factually) to accord with the satirist’s idea of his spiritual state, and the device was essentially one of punishment. In his Narrative of Dr. Norris (1713—again a combined effort, with Steele and perhaps others), he has the critic John Dennis go mad. The appropriateness of this hypothetical situation derived from Dennis’ attack on Pope’s Essay on Criticism, an attack whose violence seemed near the borderline of sanity, and whose main contention was that Pope was not writing poetry with the passion that Dennis, a good Miltonian and Longinian, believed was the duty of the younger poets. The satire takes the form of an authentic doctor’s report, and at least partly gains its effect by attempting to convince people that Dennis is in fact out of his senses. Dr. Norris, a well-known quack who advertised his ability to cure lunatics, is called to Dennis’ house on the report that he has fallen into a fit, and finds him thus (not so different from the real Dennis as to be improbable):\n\nHis Aspect was furious, his Eyes were rather fiery than lively, which he roll’d about in an uncommon manner. He often open’d his Mouth, as if he wou’d have utter’d some Matter of Importance, but the Sound seem’d lost inwardly. His Beard was grown, which they told me he would not suffer to be shav’d, believing the modern Dramatick Poets had corrupted all the Barbers in the town to take the first Opportunity of cutting his Throat.… His Flannel Night Cap, which was exceedingly begrim’d with Sweat and Dirt, hung upon his Left Ear; the Flap of his Breeches dangled between his Legs, and the Rolls of his Stockings fell down to his Ankles.22\n\nPope also contributed three papers on the sorrows of Edmund Curll. In the first he describes (or imagines) the results of the purge he did in fact administer (concealed in a drink) to the unscrupulous bookseller who had impugned the honor of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In the second he combines an imaginary account of Curll’s further sufferings from the emetic with a list of his earlier punishments at the hands of an outraged public, such as his being tossed in a blanket by the boys of Westminster School. Finally, he reports as fact an imaginary parable of Curll’s insatiable greed, the cause, Pope assumed, of all his immoral actions from the slighting of Lady Mary to the pirating of Pope’s works. He describes the unfortunate outcome of Curll’s initiation into the Jewish faith, which he thought would gain him more money and instead renders him another in the line of sterile Augustan villains. In all of these satires on Curll the sexual and excretory are made the symbols of his just punishment: his lust for money is cured by emasculation and his repletion by catharsis.\n\nThe creation of a false reality that interferes with, or even supersedes, the real—a false Curll that is confused with the real—is the most powerful way of creating an image of consequences. Thus the world of Pope’s formal satires, the Horatian imitations and the moral essays, where he also sought to define by consequences, stands in curious contrast to his direct imitations of reality.23 Characteristically, Pope acknowledged the former, but not the black journalism we have been discussing. As Aubrey Williams has noted, he carries the effect over into the pseudo-realism of his Dunciad notes, which has caused literary historians to call him both inaccurate and a liar; the villains with whom he is dealing are made to appear more real by the contrast between their “historical” accounts in the notes and their symbolic appearance in the poem itself.24 But at the same time that Pope is convincing his readers of the reality of his fiction, he is obscuring, rendering illusory if not nonexistent the reality itself. Their actual poverty and wretchedness are part of Pope’s satiric picture of the dunces—badges of their real being under their false titles and pretensions; but turning one (again Curll) into a syphilitic wretch, or a person so obscure that his existence can no longer be proved, also makes the dunce more real and convincing as well as more exemplary. For an image that convinces, that gets across the satirist’s point, Pope and Swift seem to have believed, may finally be the most realistic.\n\nBut establishing verisimilitude and grounding his satire in the world of fact are only preliminary steps for Swift. As their derivation from classical models suggests, his characters are primarily devices, as are the situations in which he places them: the Drapier is one minute the triumphant scoffer, the next the lone defender. A good Lucianic satire attempts to make as many simultaneous points as possible—the more different aspects of an evil the satiric symbol catches the better; and in this sense Swift’s pre-eminence as a satirist is obvious. The Bickerstaff Papers (1708), to which we have already alluded, will serve as our example.\n\nFirst there is the satire on Partridge, the almanac-maker, the creator of an alternative reality which will of course come tumbling down in a few months’ time when the prophecy is proved untrue, but profitable at the moment: a neat embodiment of the Swiftean image of evil. The point of the satire is to prove “how ignorant these sottish Pretenders to Astrology are in their own Concerns.”25 Partridge the prophet, placed in the unsynchronized world of Quixote or Absalom and Achitophel, does not even know that he himself is going to die. Bickerstaff, the “true” astrologer, explains that he would offer no prophecy “to the world of which I am not as fully satisfied, as that I am now alive” (p. 143). As he demonstrates, Partridge is not very sure of his own existence, let alone of anyone else’s. In a very general sense this is the skeptical reduction which begins with the proud man (here the prophet) and strips away all certainty, even of his own existence, leaving him the bare broomstick he in fact is.\n\nBut at the same time Swift is projecting a situation in which almanacs are correct and the world is full of Partridges—a world set going from his own assumptions (in this case the truth of almanacs). But therefore any almanac must tell the truth, and so Partridge is trapped in his own folly. Once the machinery has started it goes against Partridge, defeating and punishing him, plunging him into a nightmare world.\n\nBickerstaff himself, as a satiric device, is simply Swift pretending to be a better astrologer than Partridge—and in this normative role he was picked up by Steele for The Tatler. But Bickerstaff, too, is used in contrary ways. One wonders how much his Vindication is to be taken at face value as a comic criticism of Partridge and how much as a self-revelatory speech? At the end of the third letter Partridge is crying, “I shall demonstrate to the Judicious, that France and Rome, are at the bottom of this horrid Conspiracy against me”; but in his “vindication” we find Bickerstaff answering a man who has claimed that (contrary to his prophecy) the Cardinal de Noailles is still alive by asserting that he is “a French Man, a Papist, and an Enemy” (pp. 161, 223). For, if we have gotten rid of one astrolger, we still have the “art of astrology” advocated by Bickerstaff.\n\nAnd so the satire is also turned on Bickerstaff. His belief that astrologers are imposters but the art of astrology is true allows Swift to speak direct abuse of Partridge through Bickerstaff’s mouth, and yet, without breaking the mold of his fiction, he can expose less directly other aspects of astrology in Bickerstaff himself. On one side is Partridge, the false prophet and primary object of attack, and on the other side the truth that astrology lies. In the middle is Isaac Bickerstaff who (as the author of the Argument repudiated the idea of abolishing Christianity) proves that Partridge’s astrology lies but upholds the great art of astrology, in particular his own practice of it. Bickerstaff’s pride declares that he is not “of the Level of common Astrologers” (p. 149): he sets himself up as the only true artist. We notice the note of pride in his first pamphlet, and in the second the reporter who has come to verify the prophecy concludes, after Partridge’s death: “But whether he [Bickerstaff] hath not been the Cause of this poor Man’s Death, as well as the Predictor, may be very reasonably disputed” (p. 155). And in the sequel (supposedly by Rowe), Partridge refers to him as “my nameless old Persecutor,” who goes to such lengths to prove him dead that he provides Partridge “a Monument at the Stone-Cutter’s, and would have it erected in the Parish-Church” (Partridge calls this a “piece of notorious and expensive Villainy” (p. 222).26\n\nThe modern in A Tale of a Tub forced his reader to follow elaborate rules and conventions, and ultimately to set up in a garret to live his own kind of life, in order to understand his book; Peter forced his brothers to accept bread as claret and roast beef; and in the same way Bickerstaff must bring about the death of Partridge once he has prophesied it. He is the “freshest Modern” taking over Partridge’s territory, destroying him in the process. Short of murdering him, he simply acts as if Partridge were dead.\n\nThis is, I think, the proper way to look upon the Bickerstaff Papers. They were, of course, a splendid practical joke on Partridge. But the practical joke itself is part of a meaningful fiction, which turns back upon Bickerstaff, too. Partridge is the appropriate sufferer because he shares the mad assumption of Bickerstaff: that if his almanac says something, it will be true. Swift’s fiction says that the only way a prophecy will be fulfilled is for the astrologer to act as if it has been.\n\nSwift is demonstrating a number of things: (1) He proves that Partridge is really dead, in a factual as well as a fictional sense. As Bickerstaff says, “whether he be since revived, I leave the World to judge” (p. 163), and again, “for I think I have clearly proved, by invincible Demonstration, that he died at farthest within half an Hour of the Time I foretold” (p. 164). And we feel that it is true: in a professional sense Partridge is dead, and also in a moral sense. In no meaningful sense is he alive, any more than are the modern authors the Grub Street Hack tries so desperately to prove exist (he cannot produce their ephemeral works). Everyone else considers Partridge dead (and offers no objections); and so his claiming he is still alive becomes an act of egotism and pretense to self-sufficiency connecting him with the spider, the aeolist, and the tailor. (2) At the same time Swift proves that Bickerstaff’s prophecy (like all prophecies) is false: Partridge is still alive. And so Swift’s satiric fiction accepts both the fictional fact that Partridge is dead and the real fact that he is alive, in order to reflect on both Partridge and Bickerstaff. In the mad world of his fiction—which is essentially controlled by what he would call the logic of almanacs—both Bickerstaff and Partridge are solipsists: Partridge for refusing to agree with the majority that believe he is dead; and Bickerstaff for creating Partridge’s death out of his own imagination and trying to impose it on him. (3) At the same time Swift shows the coercion necessary if any prophecy is to come true. And perhaps the further implication that a prophecy is dangerous—it may contribute to the fact it merely predicts: thus Partridge’s mental anguish which is vividly portrayed in the second pamphlet. Any prophesier has to kill the man he predicts dead in order for his prophecy to come true. (4) The satire is also, of course, on the crowd, the reader who accepted the news of Partridge’s death—the tendency of people to take whatever appears in print (whether prophecy or report) as gospel truth. This is what happens and produces Partridge’s nightmare: where it is only “carried at last by two Voices, that I am still alive” (p. 222). (5) Incidental satire is accomplished by the juxtapositions in Bickerstaff’s almanac entries, the deaths of a buffoon and of the king of France and the Pope, the affairs of Poland and the fall of a booth at Bartholomew Fair. It gives Swift a chance to kill off a great number of troublesome people such as the king of France, and their deaths, like Partridge’s, suggest that in some ideal sense they should be dead.27 In the letter supposedly written by Partridge, his death is used as a touchstone by which to judge the undertakers who literally have such a sharp nose for death that they arrive before the fact, and the sexton who accuses Partridge of pretending death to escape church dues.\n\nFinally, (6) in the second letter the satire catches the aristocratic, rather condescending reporter who “in Obedience to” a nobleman’s wishes, “as well as to satisfy my own Curiosity” (“partly out of Curiosity,” he repeats later), comes to chronicle Partridge’s death. He is, after all, one of those fooled enough by the prophecies Partridge is now abjuring; and he is blind to the extent that he sees as the important consideration not Partridge’s death but the accuracy of Bickerstaff’s prediction.\n\nAnyone playing with as many levels or kinds of reality as Swift in the Bickerstaff Papers should not be too surprised when the fiction erupts into a reality beyond his intention (if it is beyond Swift’s intention). One critic believes that this happens in the scene of Partridge’s death described by the reporter. He sees Partridge, in this situation, having confessed his imposture, as “momentarily pitiful as he says that he carried on this false art only to support a wife, since he had ‘no other way to get … bread.’”28 The truth of the matter is that Partridge, for one intense moment, becomes the norm; he has been pushed into a situation in which he changes roles from villain to Swift’s spokesman, putting Bickerstaff in proper perspective. And the switch gives pathos to his abjuration of prophecy:\n\nHe replied, I am a poor ignorant Fellow, bred to a mean Trade; yet I have Sense enough to know, that all Pretences of foretelling by Astrology are Deceits; for this manifest Reason, because the Wise and Learned, who can only judge whether there be any Truth in this Science, do all unanimously agree to laugh at and despise it; and none but the poor ignorant Vulgar give it any Credit, and that only upon the Word of such silly Wretches as I and my Fellows, who can hardly write or read.\n\nHe confesses and repents his “fooleries … from the very Bottom of my heart,” explaining that he had\n\na Wife to maintain, and no other Way to get my Bread; for mending old Shoes is a poor Livelihood. And (added he, sighing) I wish I may not have done more Mischief by my Physick than my Astrology; although I had some good Receipts from my Grandmother, and my own Compositions were such, as I thought could at least do no Hurt (p. 154).\n\nThough Swift’s emphasis is on the danger of false prophets, still the complexity of response is apparent. The reporter is a fool, and Bickerstaff is beginning to appear a knave. If the character’s role is suddenly changed, so is the reader’s response. From seeing everything through Bickerstaff’s eyes, he has suddenly been made to see through Partridge’s. His sympathy for the dying man now outweighs his satisfaction at the sort of poetic justice manifested in Partridge’s end, and he sees Bickerstaff’s knavery.\n\nIn his characteristic first-person satire Swift begins with the Lucianic monologue, which allows for the maximum immersion a reader can suffer in a satiric form, but he goes a step further and removes the safe sign posts of the frame action and the sensible adversarius that Lucian often used to give his reader perspective. By removing these he plunges the reader into a fictional world in which he must with some difficulty find his own bearings. The speciously plausible argument, the numbing effect of logic, draw the reader on until he is trapped. The concrete detail, the particular name, and the complexity of the speaker’s thought processes also contribute. The violently sensuous object or action has the same effect on the reader it did in Rabelais. The most violent, uncontrolled actions served to show the violent upsurge of energy, both intellectual and physical, that Rabelais felt was needed to bring new life into the old religious forms. Panurge, with his bulging pockets and ultimate individualism, serves in many details as a prototype for Swift’s protagonists. What Rabelais presents as an ideal—or at least a good corrective—Swift takes as a serious threat.\n\nBut he is not content with showing the reader the extravagance of the Rabelaisian imagination in syntax, form, images, actions, and characters; he also believes that he must, in fact, cast the reader adrift, as Rabelais does, in this sinister world and show him what would happen. It is important that up to a certain point the reader is fooled—made to accept the early assumptions of a projector’s mad plan, or the early pages of a travel memoir, or the prophecy of Partridge’s death. As Swift lamented in the preface to The Battle of the Books, “Satyr is a sort of Glass, wherein Beholders do generally discover every body’s Face but their Own.” Clearly it was his aim to trap his reader into recognizing his own face in the mirror. He exerts his greatest ingenuity to implicate the reader in the folly in order, first, to give a greater effect to the peripeteia and the reader’s anagnorisis when it comes; but also, second, to make him see how close he comes himself to being the monster portrayed—or rather a part of the crowd that is being duped by the monster. He proves, in a sense, how universal the folly is. To do this he must suck the reader in, showing him how it feels to be evil or foolish. Then, by the very violence of the shock when it comes, he turns the reader back to seeing the scene in perspective. In this sense, Swift’s constant aim is, by whatever means are at his disposal, to make his true audience read the irony at the level of the false audience.29\n\nThe notorious difficulty with Swift’s strategy is that the effect of identification is often so powerful that some readers do not make the transition back to the world of moral choice and objective facts. Or, looked at differently, a character is raised momentarily to a pitch of reality that is inconsistent with the rest of the work.\n\nNevertheless, a particular image of reality emerges. If Swift’s feigned pamphlets produce static “characters” of their authors, these “characters” only make sense in terms of implied relationships with others above and below them on the moral ladder. In a series of pamphlets, like the Bickerstaff Papers, where a group of characters collect, the scene, situation, and characters are used in such a way as to bring out shades of guilt in a succession of unexpected areas. All the characters are linked in a common network of guilt, revealing a close interaction, even interdependence; and the densely satiric scene becomes a spectrum of moral responsibility.\n\nSwiftean Picaresque: Gulliver’s Travels\n\nSo far the center of interest in Swift’s satire has been a symbol of the perversion of values, turning this way and that to offer exposition of all its various facets. A Tale of a Tub comes no closer to a narrative in time and space than the scattered references to the Grub Street Hack’s goings and comings and his increasing concern with his book and its purchasers as he nears the end of his writing and publication time approaches. The Horatian dialectic, seen in the story of the brothers, is reflected in the Hack’s attempt to reconcile the value terms of morality and art (such as “universal benefit of mankind”) with the assumptions of the moderns; but the relationship set up remains a static one, a sort of constantly reiterated tableau.\n\nWhen he turned to narrative in Gulliver’s Travels (1726), Swift utilized the fiction of the picaresque novel. Some of the time Gulliver is simply an observer, traveling and recording, becoming more or less of a gull by the extent to which he accepts what he sees. But these parts are largely limited to a chapter or so in each voyage and to much of the third voyage. More often he is a touchstone: by his enormous size and equal magnanimity he sets off the puzzled, treacherous, belligerent, or presumptuous reactions of the Lilliputians. At the center of Swift’s action is the relationship between the traveler and the strange people he meets.\n\nFor example, among the Brobdingnagians, where Gulliver is specifically a servant with contrasting “masters,” the brutality of the giant farmer is brought out by his treatment of the tiny, helpless Gulliver; and the pettiness and human pride of Gulliver are shown by his posturing before his second master, the kind King. The relationship shifts as Gulliver goes from master to master. The Emperor of Lilliput is very like Lazaro’s first master, the blind beggar, and similarly vulnerable, and Gulliver is like Lazaro, the complacent servant, adjusting to his surroundings, revealing his master’s villainy by praising or even imitating it. But the relationship is made overwhelmingly ironic by the servant’s being a mile high. Like the picaro, who assumes the values of his masters, Gulliver ends by assuming the values of the people he visits. It follows that his complaisance turns him (as it does Lazaro) into a fool who makes possible his master’s knavery. In the case of his good masters, Gulliver imitates that aspect which is least appropriate to him; returning from Brobdingnag he acts like a giant, and returning from Houyhnhnmland he acts like a horse. There are other nobler aspects he could imitate—and in this respect his is a more complex situation than the picaro’s. By the end of the voyage to Brobdingnag the emphasis has shifted from the master’s tyranny to the servant’s willingness to be tyrannized, and this situation no doubt explains something of Gulliver’s relationship to his Houyhnhnm master. The relationship between master and servant, then, is Swift’s central irony, explored in a slightly different way in each voyage.\n\nSwift’s cast of characters owes something to the satiric fiction we have traced in his other satires. In all but the third voyage, which reverts to the old and simple form of the satiric anatomy or survey, the protagonist is given a master, various outside threats to his safety, and a friend. The master represents the structure of order, whether good or bad, which protects Gulliver from the forces of enmity and disorder—unruly soldiers, an enemy like Skyresh Bolgolam, rats, dwarves, nasty children, wasps, and Yahoos. These figures, who like Bolgolam are “pleased, without any Provocation, to be my mortal Enemy,” are completely negative.30 In fact, by placing in parallel functions the Bolgolams and the rats and monkeys who attack Gulliver in Brobdingnag, Swift suggests that such obvious threats are probably amoral rather than immoral. The friend is the unnamed man who warns him of the Lilliputians’ plans to destroy him, or Glumdalclitch in Brobdingnag, or the Sorrel Nag in Houyhnhnmland. (Sometimes the friendship proves ironic, as in Reldressel, who argues for the kindness of blinding Gulliver instead of killing him.)\n\nWhile the forces of evil are hardly even supplied with motives for their natural viciousness, the master is guided by an awareness of his own position or advantage—fear that Gulliver will go over to the Blefuscudians, or the desire to make money, or the fear that Gulliver may cause the Yahoos to revolt. So from Gulliver’s point of view we have once again the structure of Swift’s first-person satires: the undisguisedly evil on one side (Gulliver is never deceived by Bolgolam or the jealous dwarf) and the obviously good on the other. In the middle is the ambiguous figure who puts a good face on his selfish actions: the emperor who uses Gulliver to carry out his policies, and whose cruelty is marked under fine phrases. Even the King of Brobdingnag and the Houyhnhnm master, though not intended as evil creatures, are masters and follow the pattern. They cannot see others except in relation to themselves; anything beyond their experience baffles them. The King, though wise, is simply so large that he regards Gulliver with an undue detachment, in effect imprisoning him like a bird in a gilded cage and hoping to find a mate so that this curious species can be propagated; and the Houyhnhnm master, though surpassingly wise, cannot see Gulliver as more than a Yahoo of superior intelligence (and so, dangerous). To both of them he remains a lusus naturae. When the Houyhnhnm master explains why Gulliver must be sent out to sea to certain death, he sounds very much like the Emperor of Lilliput justifying the proposed murder of Gulliver (pp. 71, 279), just as Gulliver, when he tries to justify his master’s decree, demonstrates an irony as cutting as in his earlier attempt to justify the Emperor’s sentence (pp. 72–73, 280).\n\nBut the Brobdingnagian and Houyhnhnm masters are present less as comments on themselves than as comments on Gulliver. Gulliver’s function changes with the second voyage, and he becomes himself the object of satire, assuming the role of the middleman who attempts to rationalize his miserable situation into a state to be proud of. Even in Lilliput he finds on one side of him the ideals of liberty and duty to one’s country, on the other enslavement, and, entirely to his own disadvantage, attaches the name of liberty to the fact of his slavery, justifying his degradation by means of the rhetoric of his masters. He is the man who puts a good face on his own unsatisfactory situation by seeing it as his “masters the Moderns” do. He shows his descent from the Grub Street Hack as well as Martinus Scriblerus (as whom he originated) in his automatic reactions as a correct modern—collecting specimens in Lilliput and weighing hailstones, keeping a cabinet of curiosities, and wishing to dissect a louse in Brobdingnag; showing his pride in England as well as in the latest “modern” inventions for improving warfare.\n\nLike any searcher for a Utopia, Gulliver sets out voyaging to escape the restraints of his homeland. The first page gives us this impression through words suggesting confinement: his father’s “small Estate,” applying himself “close” to his studies, the cost being “too great for a narrow Fortune,” his being “bound Apprentice” to a surgeon, and receiving “small Sums of Money.” Opposed to these references and the emphasis on specific numbers of years, pounds, and the like, is the indefinite “long Voyages.” After his first voyages, he settles in London, but soon sets out again in order to escape the corruptions of business without which one cannot succeed in England: “for my Conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my Brethren” (p. 20); and a subsequent business has begun to fail. The sea seems to represent release for him; and so it is the first of a series of ironies on this theme when, running into the ultimate in freedom, the violent storm at sea that sets him free even from the confinement of his boat, he wakes up and attempting to rise, is “not able to stir: For as I happened to lie on my Back, I found my Arms and Legs were strongly fastened on each Side to the Ground.” Even his hairs are bound to the earth, and he is in a kingdom far more constricting than his homeland.\n\nThe allegorical message (emphasized in Hogarth’s print, The Punishment of Lemuel Gulliver, published in December 1726) is this: England in seeking freedom (the individualistic freedom for which the Whigs stood) has found itself in the most constricting kind of world—one of people six inches high who treat the good old Englishman as a slave in spite of the obvious discrepancy in their sizes. And the foolish, “gullible” Englishman gratefully accepts this slavery: the privilege of turning over on his side to make water, of living chained in the equivalent of a dog’s house, and of kissing the hand of a mite.31 (One need only recall the figure of Arbuthnot’s John Bull, and disguise the allegory considerably—since Arbuthnot was on the winning side when he wrote, and Swift was now on the losing side. The character of John Bull was not unlike Gulliver’s—both were ordinary bluff Englishmen, somewhat dense, as their names equally imply.) The situation of the majority cowed by a minuscule, single, actually powerless figure is a usual Swiftean image for the enemy, which he employed about the same time in the image of William Wood. Here numbers are on the Lilliputians’ side, but obviously the tail is again wagging the dog if they can order Gulliver around. So on the political level, Swift is ridiculing the folly of the great lethargic mass that allows itself (“in the most submissive Manner”) to be exploited by fear or custom or something of the sort when there is no reason to do so.\n\nOn the level of human action, however, Gulliver is a foolish, subservient man, easily enchained by plausible knaves and apparent authority. The repetition of the word “liberty” (the refrain of the first voyage) points to the relationship: Gulliver’s humble petitions for his “liberty,” the Emperor’s refusal and limited grant, and “the Liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a Semicircle” (p. 28). Once he is physically released, his liberty is even more restricted without the physical fears. Chapter III begins with the humiliating relationship between the Emperor and his advisers, the rope dancers and the stick jumpers; and it goes on to the equally humiliating, though less reasonable, relationship between the Emperor and Gulliver. Gulliver’s eager building of a tilt field with his handkerchief is described, as well as his service as the Emperor’s arch of triumph and his humble reception of the “charger” which grants him his “liberty.”\n\nThe unambiguous self-enslavement of Voyage I becomes in Brobdingnag a less obvious but more sinister one; for here the little Gulliver, whose pride grows as he shrinks in size (a kind of compensation for one’s littleness, as it was in the Tale for one’s transcience), fancies himself free when he is obviously kept as a kind of toy or pet locked in a box;32 whereas in Lilliput, although he was physically free, he allowed himself to be convinced that he was a servant or captive. Here, more than anywhere else in his travels, Gulliver thinks of himself in terms of his “masters,” and his progress can be measured by them. One is a tyrant, one is benevolent—and yet Gulliver’s behavior is the same with both. Fear of reprisals, as with the farmer’s child, causes him to be obsequious among these huge people, as respect for abstract authority did in Voyage I. But once among the royal family, his servility is based on his growing pride; and the ignominy of being shown off by his first master changes to an anxiety to show off before the King. As soon as he is presented to the Queen he slips into courtier’s jargon, and he is soon telling how during meals he sits at the King’s “left Hand before one of the Salt-sellers” (p. 106). He is only pleased when the Queen is “diverted” by him, as when the dwarf releases flies under his nose (p. 109), or when she is “agreeably entertained with my Skill and Agility” at rowing a boat (p. 120) or with his laborious performance at the piano (“the most violent Exercise I ever underwent”). He is constantly referred to as a “Sight,” “Spectacle,” “Show,” or “Curiosity”; and even Glumdalclitch, “although she loved me to Excess, yet was arch enough to inform the Queen, whenever I committed any Folly that she thought would be diverting to her Majesty” (p. 124). Even his explanation of the “State of Europe” is a performance and a show as he stands on the top of a cabinet “which brought me almost to a Level with his Face” (p. 127). The resemblance between these shows and the involuntary shows on the farmer’s table, with admission charged, completely escapes Gulliver.\n\nThe prison box he lives in is thus not a reflection on the Brobdinagians but on his own pretensions. He designed it himself, is safe in it and happy, and does not see it as a prison until the King suggests that if he could get a woman of Gulliver’s size he would like to see the pigmy race propagated. “But,” says Gulliver, more out of pride than self-awareness, “I think I should rather have died than undergone the Disgrace of leaving a Posterity to be kept in Cages like tame Canary Birds” (p. 139). Even when his first cry upon being picked up by a rescue ship is “to be delivered out of the Dungeon I was in” (p. 143), he sees no connection between the dungeon his box has become floating in the water and the one it was in the Brobdingnagian court. He sees no humor in the reference to Phaeton’s fall made by Captain Wilcocks, who cannot understand what was the “enormous Crime, for which I was punished at the Command of some Prince, by exposing me in that Chest” (p. 145).\n\nMuch the same situation is portrayed in the fourth voyage. Gulliver’s eagerness to become a Houyhnhnm and deny any connection with Yahoos follows from his eagerness to become a show for the Brobdingnagian royal family. The Houyhnhnm master persuades his frends to treat Gulliver “with Civility,” because “this would put me [Gulliver] into good Humour, and make me more diverting” (p. 238). Whether we regard the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos as opposite extremes of the human and inhuman, or of human attributes—reason and passion—or of good and evil, the point of Gulliver’s role as a whole is to become a middleman who attempts to attach the reason of a Houyhnhnm to the pride and body of a Yahoo.\n\nTherefore, if Gulliver derives in a sense from the corruptible picaro he also derives from the Swiftean middleman, the villain of the other satires examined. However, as the derivation from the picaro implies, if this figure is much lower than Houyhnhnm, he is also not so debased as a Yahoo. He is much more normative than Swift’s earlier villains, and this has been brought about by the shifting of emphasis from the wickedness of Gulliver’s imitation of his masters to the consequences of his imitation: imprisonment, insecurity, betrayal, and even madness. There is also a much greater admixture of truth and well-meaning in Gulliver’s imitations, as well as a more idealistic motive that drives him to emulation in all but the second voyage.\n\nSomething of his character, particularly in the fourth voyage, can be explained by reference to another classical source for the dupe of which Swift was so fond. The Nigrinus of Lucian, though it derives from Horace’s Satire II.3 (concerning Damasippus), produces a more ambiguous and disturbing satirist-satirized situation. Like Horace, Lucian presents a man, A, repeating ecstatically what another man, B, has lectured to him. There may be considerable truth in B’s words, which are largely satiric, but they are somehow inapplicable to A, or to people in general, and A’s enthusiasm is excessive and his understanding incomplete. The listener, C, ironically agrees to A’s account, but by his questions brings out the absurdity of A’s position.\n\nIn Lucian’s fiction a friend reproaches “Lucian” for his haughty airs now that he has returned from a journey—he will no longer have anything to do with his old friends. “Lucian” explains that it all came from seeing Nigrinus, the platonic philosopher, who has revealed to him the real ugliness of the apparently pleasant life he has been living. “Lucian” had gone to Rome to see an oculist about his failing eyesight and instead found Nigrinus, who improved his spiritual vision, turning him into a misanthropic satirist. The consequence, he shows, is halfway between drunkenness and frenzy. In the course of “Lucian’s” account Nigrinus is compared to an intoxicating drink, a beacon far out in the ocean upon which he fixes his gaze, an archer who impales Lucian’s heart, and (his interlocutor finally adds) a mad dog whose bite Lucian is now communicating. It all suggests that we should approach Nigrinus warily. He has unhinged “Lucian”: “I was seized with a violent attack of giddiness; I was bathed in perspiration, and when I attempted to speak, I broke down; my voice failed, my tongue stammered, and at last I was reduced to tears.”33 This is the effect of such philosophy on an ordinary man. Nigrinus states an ideal—but a philosophical ideal which, if taken seriously, would make man simply withdraw from life. His attacks on Roman corruption, which closely follow those of Juvenal, are to be accepted as true. But Nigrinus’ platonism causes him to withdraw from all human contacts: “From my high seat in this vast theatre,” he says, “I look down on the scene beneath me; a scene calculated to afford much entertainment …” (p. 18). Like Horace, Lucian catches three different groups in his satiric net: he uses Nigrinus as a way to castigate the vices in Rome and to present an ideal; but Nigrinus is also a philosopher, and in a human context his solution is an absurd extreme; finally, “Lucian” himself will have to come down to earth again before he will be a better man for his experience. Yet, we are left with the possible interpretation that Lucian is presenting Nigrinus’ view as the ideal, and the joke is in the discrepancy between this ideal and his own, or any human’s, ability to follow it.\n\nIn Houyhnhnmland Gulliver, like Lucian, encounters someone who shows him a truth he had never before suspected and it virtually unhinges him, turning him into a railing satirist. At first sight this appears to be a new role for Gulliver; the external revelation is a contradiction to his beliefs in the superiority of people who look like him. But, as soon becomes apparent, Gulliver adjusts the new revelation to his own case, pitting himself and the Houyhnhnms against humans; he does not change himself, if anything ending a less desirable man. Like Lucian with his nose in the air, Gulliver refuses to live with Yahoos like his wife and children and spends his time in the stable.\n\nGulliver demonstrates how the Swiftean villain, by some shifts of emphasis, becomes a character who, if not in fact a hero, can be regarded as essentially ordinary, an Everyman. Much of his effect depends upon the fact that Swift has moved from a static portrait showing this figure at his worst to a narrative in which the decent but fallible man finds his way through a world of frightful or deceiving experiences such as extremes of size and of reason and passion. The acts of folly, though climactic, do not completely cancel out the many neutral or even virtuous acts.\n\nGulliver is not intended as the hero of a bildungsroman: he makes no self-discovery, comes to no awareness of himself, except to the parody of awareness he suffers in Houyhnhnmland. He is closer to the Horatian “you,” the test figure who guides the reader between polar errors. But the direction of the satire is less toward a proposed (or implied) code of conduct than toward the eighteenth-century preoccupation with the definition of man. Gulliver’s Travels is less closely related to Pope’s Horatian satires than to his Essay on Man.\n\nSatiric structures appear at their simplest in the third voyage, in which the Laputans, Struldbrugs, and the rest, like Lazarillo de Tormes’ fifth master, are merely observed by Gulliver. The skeleton is not covered, the rhetoric is naked, and the fiction is the relation between an observer and an object: sometimes the observer is normative, sometimes ironically ingenuous, sometimes gulled by appearances. The relationship at its most complex produces simple error followed by disillusion and revaluation wrought by contact with the ghosts of Glubbdubdrib and the Struldbrugs. Book III is the traditional satiric anatomy of misdirected reason, at its most typical in the survey of the Academy of Lagado in which a tour of the Royal Society is equated with one of Bedlam. The trips up to the floating island, down to the ghosts of Glubbdubdrib, and horizontally to other odd places are unvarnished descendants of the Lucianic dialogues, equally concise and brilliant but largely unintegrated. The voyage does make some sense on two levels other than the rhetorical: on the metaphysical it extends Swift’s study of man from body to mind, and on the representational it begins to prepare us for Gulliver’s breakdown in Houyhnhnmland (developing the disillusionment begun in the King of Brobdingnag’s “odious little vermin” speech). But like the rhetoric these are naked, and roughly indicated (almost a sketch) as compared with the full rendering of the other three voyages. (Though parts of the voyage were written as late as 1724, other parts clearly contain vestiges of Martinus Scriblerus’ travels and whatever else did not fit in the other voyages.)\n\nThe first two and the fourth of Gulliver’s voyages also began as Lucianic devices for getting new perspectives on man but embodied them in close-fitting fictions. Lilliput and Brobdingnag are vantage points from which to see man’s true situation and humble his pride; through a telescope or a microscope, or from a far higher or lower physical position, man could be seen with more detachment or in more minute detail. Lucian’s and Rabelais’ aim with the same device was to shake up the reader’s accepted values; Swift’s is the same, but applied first to his protagonist Gulliver, and second to the reader who identifies with him. While Rabelais (if not Lucian) intended his reader to emerge with a sense of growth, discovery, and confidence in himself, Swift hopes he will emerge humbled and chastened. Pascal, who had also suggested the use of these vantage points, summed up the effect:\n\nIf a man will look at himself as I suggest, the sight will terrify him; and, seeing himself suspended in the material form given him by Nature, between the two abysses of Infinity and Nothingness, he will tremble beholding these marvels, and I think that, as his curiosity turns to awe, he will rather gaze in silence than dare to question them.34\n\nThis is the general rhetorical aim of the devices in Gulliver’s Travels, though many variations are rung. The fourth voyage simply substitutes shape and other opposing qualities for size, probably originating, as R. S. Crane has shown, with Swift’s inversion of the traditional equations of homo with rationale and equus with irrationale (and, for that matter, hinnibile) to be found in Latin logic books.35 Another of Crane’s illuminating insights into the fourth voyage is that Gulliver is used there in the same way as the man in Plato’s myth of the cave who is forcibly taken out and brought face to face with reality:\n\nhe will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned toward more real existence, he has a clearer vision,—what will be his reply?36\n\nThese satiric devices have in common the polarization of Gulliver and what he sees—Lilliputian, Brobdingnagian, and Houyhnhnm. In the general sweep of his narrative Swift uses the extremes of size and shape as part of a dynamic structure which advances from one alternative to another, gradually questioning and defining the poles of Gulliver and his alter egos. Like the earlier narrative satires we have examined, Swift’s is constructed on a series of parallels established through echoes and allusions. For example, when Gulliver expresses nausea at the Queen of Brobdingnag’s “craunch[ing] the Wing of a Lark, Bones and all, between her Teeth, although it were nine Times as large as that of a full grown Turkey” (p. 106), the reader recalls his earlier remark that his Lilliputian servants “were astonished to see me eat it [a sirloin] Bones and all, as in our Country we do the Leg of a Lark. Their Geese and Turkeys I usually eat at a Mouthful …” (p. 64), or, yet earlier, that the great pieces of meat the Lilliputians prepare for him are “smaller than the Wings of a Lark” (p. 24). Gulliver’s drawing his sword and amazing the Lilliputians with the sun glancing off it (p. 36) is echoed in the Brobdingnagian horsemen who do the same, with the same effect on Gulliver (p. 138). The contrast shows how different the little man among the big is from the big among the little. There is, of course, dramatic irony, as in the Brobdingnagian king’s desire to find Gulliver a woman his size “by whom I might propagate the Breed” (p. 139) in the light of Gulliver’s similar desire when he was preparing to leave Blefuscu (p. 78). Thus the rat who ate some of his Lilliputian sheep on the return voyage becomes the rat who tries to eat Gulliver in Brobdingnag, and the doghouse and chain in Lilliput becomes Gulliver’s box in Brobdingnag. The effect of such parallelism and contrast in a satire like A Tale of a Tub was to give a thematic unity to a work that represented a radical disunity on the level of action (the speaker’s conscious argument). In Gulliver’s Travels the effect is to create a series of parallel experiences.\n\nIf each contrast has an immediate point to make about man, together they serve as alternatives of action that suggest the direction the reader should or should not take—and that test the protagonist and reveal his growth or lack of growth. For instance, Gulliver’s fear, when he is at the mercy of a Brobdingnagian field hand, that “human Creatures are … more Savage and cruel in Proportion to their Bulk” (p. 87) is contrasted with the reader’s memory of his gentle treatment of the Lilliputians. The reader, feeling apprehension with Gulliver, should still remember and recognize that size limits viewpoint, and that in fact the smaller the man the crueller he is likely to be. But once placed as part of a temporal and causal continuum between voyages, the scene makes the reader also aware that Gulliver, as the same character who visited Lilliput, sees no connection between this situation and his own gigantic benevolence toward the Lilliputians—he has not learned from his experience.\n\nThe parallels run through all four voyages (though less noticeable in the third), beginning with the basic situation of each voyage: Gulliver arrives in a new country, slips into the assumptions of the natives, is threatened with catastrophe, and escapes and returns to his own country. From one to the other there is a progress not so much from good to evil as from safety to danger, or from experiences that Gulliver can take in his stride to those with which he cannot finally cope. The progression is reflected in the disasters that place Gulliver in each strange land. These advance from natural disaster that wrecks his ship to shipmates that run for their lives and leave Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians (we can hardly blame the sailors, however, for leaving him in their fright, particularly since he had no business going ashore; the sailors went to get water, he to gather scientific specimens); then from the pirates who capture him and the wicked Dutchman who prevails upon them to cast him adrift to the final evil of his own crew mutinying and marooning him on a remote island. While these events trace a downward plunge in human experience characteristic of the satiric world view, they also influence Gulliver’s changing attitudes as he moves from the harmless land of pigmies to the dangerous land of giants, from the mad or evil lands of the third voyage to the shocking experience of the Yahoos.\n\nThe system of parallels also sets up expectations of other parallels that help to clarify some of the more obscure parts of the fourth voyage. In the first two countries Gulliver is examined by philosophers and concluded to be a lusus naturae (pp. 49, 104), and so when the Houyhnhnms cannot decide whether Gulliver is a Yahoo or a unique creature we tend to accept this as another case of man’s inability to grasp what does not fit his picture of himself, as well as a sign of how difficult it is to define a human being. In each country before Houyhnhnmland (with some exceptions within the third voyage) Gulliver adjusts to the viewpoint and customs of his hosts. In Lilliput he is soon bragging of his title of nardak and, when he hears that the Emperor intends to kill him, he can barely shake himself free of the assumption that he is a loyal subject; so in Brobdingnag he begins “to imagine himself dwindled many Degrees below [his] usual Size” (p. 107), as in Houynhnhnmland he sees himself through the Houyhnhnms’ eyes as a Yahoo in a suit. When he returns from Brobdingnag, however, he has come to see himself as a Brobdingnagian, regarding the sailors who rescue him as “the most little contemptible Creatures I had ever beheld” (recalling the king’s opinion that Europeans are “little odious vermin”), and when he walks along a road in England he is “afraid of trampling on every Traveller” and calls “loud to have them stand out of the Way” (pp. 147–49). Thus when he sees things from the viewpoint of the Houyhnhnms in the fourth voyage, he also ends by looking upon the sailors who rescue him as the Houyhnhnms look upon Yahoos, and later can get no closer than a table’s length from his wife and children, spending his time in the barn with the horses.\n\nIt will be noticed, however, that most of the parallels that appear in the fourth voyage go back to the second voyage rather than to the first. The monkey who takes Gulliver for a relative in Brobdingnag (p. 122) becomes the female Yahoo who takes him for a Yahoo of the other sex in Houyhnhnmland (p. 266), and the normative Captain Wilcocks who rescues Gulliver from Brobdingnag certainly suggests that we are to take Captain Mendoza, who rescues him from Houyhnhnmland, as similarly normative. One set of parallels concerning relative sizes connects the first and second voyage, and another, concerning Gulliver’s pride, which only begins to emerge in Brobdingnag, ties together the second and fourth.\n\nWith the scene in which the King of Brobdingnag and his philosophers with difficulty decide that Gulliver is a lusus naturae, Swift enters upon the theme of human definition that has been latent though implicit in both the contrast of sizes and the centrality of Gulliver-Everyman. Pascal concluded from his beneficial shock of showing man “the two abysses of Infinity and Nothingness”: “For, I ask, what is man in Nature? A cypher compared with the Infinite, an All compared with Nothing, a mean between zero and all.”37 Thus Swift asks, is it still a man if it is only six inches high, or six miles high? Or if it has the body of a horse or of an ape?38 The question of when is a man free is merely a part of this larger question. Gulliver is clearly no lusus naturae; but he is, on the one hand, the individual lowering himself to the role of a slave, an animal, a show; on the other hand, by this "
