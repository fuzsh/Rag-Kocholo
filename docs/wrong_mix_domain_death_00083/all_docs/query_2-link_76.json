        "text": "The line \"tis still terribly cold - I wish my cold hand was in the warmest place about you, young women\" would have had the satirist and moralistJonathan Swift sacked on the spot, if he'd been moonlighting as a Sky sports presenter.\n\nLetters Swift wrote to his beloved \"Stella\" – Esther Johnson – and her companion, Rebecca Dingley, reveal in detail Swift's mixture of bawdry and baby talk.\n\nThe letters, translated by an academic with the help of her three-year-old son, show Swift addressing Stella as his \"poo poo ppt\" – his poor poor poppet.\n\nThe baby talk passages are in tiny writing and often lightly crossed out. Scholars assumed this was done after Swift's death to protect the reputationof the author of Gulliver's Travels. But Abigail Williams, an English tutor at St Peter's College, Oxford University, who edited the letters, is convinced he crossed out his own words.\n\n\"I think the effect was intended to be a kind of guessing game with his readers. The women he was writing to needed to undress the text before they could fully enjoy it. This disguising of affectionate endearments is clearly part of a secret code of intimacy that characterises the journal as a whole, which uses baby language and a series of special names to emphasise the closeness between Swift and his readers.\n\n\"The interesting thing is he doesn't cross out quite sensitive political or court gossip, or the bawdier passages – it's just the baby talk, which is both infantilising and quite sexualised. The effect is to create a special place – not necessarily a place one would want to go to.\"\n\nThe book includes 65 letters but Williams also studied 25 surviving manuscripts in the British Library collection to crack his code. The letters were addressed jointly to Stella and Dingley, and intended to be read aloud: Stella, with very poor eyesight, could not have read the smallest writing.\n\nShe conscripted two experts, an FBI forensic document analyst and her three-year-old, William, who spoke the lines aloud.\n\nWith William's help, \"I expect a Rettle vely soon: & that MD is vely werr, and so Nite de MD\" became \"I expect a letter very soon, and that my dears are very well, and so night dear my dears\". The boy's help was not needed for phrases such as \"saucy sluts\" or \"agreeable b-tch\", or passages such as \"Stella is just now shewing a white leg and putting it into the slipper\".\n\nSwift's relations with women have fascinated generations of scholars. His writing mercilessly parodied the mawkish sentimentality of his day – including the immortal line, from a shocked suitor staggering away from his beloved's dressing room: \"Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!\"\n\nThe book, The Journal to Stella: Letters to Esther Johnson and Rebecca Dingley, 1710-1713, is due out this year. \"I wouldn't say the work has made me think worse of Swift,\" Williams said. \"I always thought he was pretty peculiar.\""
