He was buried in the Bellvue Cemetery at Lawrence, Essex County, Massachusetts\n\nNOTES: William Wallace Colby, an undertaker and funeral director of Lawrence, and one of those who have carried on this business longest in this city, was born in Eaton, now Madison, N.H., June 24, 1818, son of Ebenezer Colby. The Colby family traces its ancestry back in direct line to the year 1133. It was first represented on American soil by Anthony Colby, who came from old England to New England at a very early date, settling in Amesbury, Essex County. The Colby homestead in Amesbury, that has not been out of the possession of the family since it was acquired by Anthony Colby, is now owned and occupied by two maiden sisters.\n\nColeman Colby, the grandfather of William W., was a New Hampshire farmer. He was first married to Phoebe Garland, and subsequently to a Miss Barrows. He reared nine children; namely, Coleman, Ebenezer, Judith, Timothy, Phoebe, Rachel, Abram, Richard, and Lorenzo. Richard, a lawyer, died comparatively young. Lorenzo had reached the age of fourscore when he died in Chelsea, Mass. Ebenezer Colby, born in Eaton, N.H., March 12, 1791, died in the same place in the winter of 1859. An industrious husbandman, he toiled early and late on his rocky farm to support his family. He was twice married. His first wife, Dorothy, a daughter of Philip Jackson, of Eaton, N.H., died at the age of forty-two years. Of their six children, a daughter died in infancy. The others were: John, Mary Ann, William Wallace, Charlotte, and Stephen. A second marriage united Ebenezer with Mary Morrison, of Freedom, N.H., who bore him three children --Eben, Albion, and Mary. Of his nine children, two are living -- William W. and Eben. Eben is a farmer in Moultonboro, N.H.\n\nAfter completing his education in the district schools of Eaton, William W. Colby assisted in the care of the home farm until he attained his majority. Then, in June, 1839, he left home with ten dollars in his pockets, five of which was borrowed from a neighbor, and began the struggle of life in earnest. Having taken the stage-coach at three o'clock in the morning, he reached Dover, some seventy miles distant, at ten o'clock that night. Early next day he resumed his journey, reaching Haverhill, Mass., at three o'clock in the afternoon. Here he accepted work on a farm at twelve dollars a month. At the end of nine months he had saved ninety-six dollars, for which he took his employer's note. During the ensuing winter, in East Haverhill, he worked as an apprentice at the shoemaker's trade for his board. In the following summer he took charge of the farm of a widow in the vicinity. About eight years after his marriage he settled in Lawrence, where he was active in municipal affairs for a time. In 1864 and 1865 he was a member of the Common Council. After this he conducted an express business between Boston and Methuen for a time. During the years 1871 and 1872 he was superintendent of the cemetery. In 1875 he engaged in the undertaking business, which he has since successfully carried on. In politics he is a stanch Republican, and he belongs to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The senior Deacon of the Free Baptist church, he has the distinction of being the oldest living member of the society.\n\nMr. Colby was married November 26, 1840, to Elizabeth A. F. George, a daughter of Moses George, of East Haverhill, Mass. Of their ten children, three have passed away, namely: Eli, who died in infancy; Frederick A., at the age of fifteen years; and Edward L., who contracted consumption while serving in the late Rebellion, and died at Oakland Cal., in June, 1887, leaving a widow and two children. The seven living are: George M., who is in the undertaking business with his brother; William R., who lives in the west, and has two children; Charles M., who is employed by the Lawrence Board of Health; Arthur E., who is in business with his father, and has a wife and three children; Guy I., who is the manager of the meat market of Swift & Co. and Springfield, Ill., and has a wife and three children; Susan Jane, who is the wife of Captain Frank F. Eastman, of the United States army, stationed at Vancouver, Wash., and has six children; and Mary F., who is the wife of John W. Bolton, of Lawrence, and has five children. Mrs. Elizabeth Colby died in July, 1874, aged fifty-three years. On September 2, 1875, Mr. Colby married Lavinia C. Pray, of Lawrence. They have one child, Alice Lavinia, who was graduated from the Lawrence High School in 1897.

At the age of 21, he resolved to penetrate the forests of New Hampshire for the purpose of selecting a location for his father, four brothers, and himself. The spot selected was on Wood Hill in the town of Bow. The homestead was originally on both sides of Wood Hill Road. The section east of the road was later separated by the road (Woodhill-Hooksett Road) from Wood Hill to Great Hill. The house is at the northeast corner of the intersection. (William \"Willie\" Colby, and his wife, Frances, lived there until his death on 25 Jul 1969) Willaby soon went back to his Amesbury home and married Sarah Sargent of Newton, NH, on 14 Jan 1767. She was born 3 Dec 1745. They started making arrangements to emigrate to their new home. His first child, James, was born in the Fall of 1767. The next Spring, they all started for their new home in Bow, his wife on horseback with their child in her arms. He soon built a frame house east of where his son Philip afterward lived. In 1774 he purchased of Benjamin Noyes, a hundred acre lot, No.5, 14th Range, in the Bow Bog District, which he divided between his rtwo sons, James and Philip. This lot was called Nottencook. He was well skilled in the use of carpenter's tools and would glide over a frame as safely as on terra firma. Their first log house stood a short distance south of where William Elliot lived in 1892, where his father, Abraham, with the youngest son, Jonathan lived and died. He signed the Association Test, along with his father, Abraham, on 3 Sep 1776. He was a Revolutionary soldier. In July 1777, Lt. Willaby Colby, with seven others, under Capt. Benjamin Bean, marched for the relief of Fort Ticonderoga. On their arrival at the Fort in Charlestown, NH (Old Fort No.4) news came of its evacuation and orders to return. They were in service seven days. In February 1781, he petitioned the General Court for payments for his services in the war, stating that in July of 1777, he was drafted by Capt. Benjamin Bean to march to Ticonderoga. Capt. Bean died shortly after their return and did not pay them. In 1792, he, Enoch Noyes, and Timothy Dix, were chosen a committee to accept of the meeting house, if work was done according to previous agreement. He was one of the Town Selectmen in 1796 and 1797. His wife, Sarah, died at Bow on 22 Apr 1796 at the age of 54.\n\nSOURCES: (1) \"The Old Families of Salisbury and Amesbury Massachusetts\" by David W.
