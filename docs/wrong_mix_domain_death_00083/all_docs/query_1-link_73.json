        "text": "1667-1745\n\n\"Life is not a farce; it is a ridiculous tragedy, which is the worst kind of composition.\"\n\nBirthplace\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\nEducation\n\nTrinity College, Dublin, receiving his degree only by \"special grace\" after indiscipline.\n\nOther jobs\n\nReverend, polemicist, diplomatic envoy between England and Ireland\n\nDid you know?\n\nA Modest Proposal, Swift's most savage piece of twisted logic - a pamphlet suggesting that the 'Irish problem' be solved by getting the poor to sell their babies to the rich for food - was taken seriously by some.\n\nCritical verdict\n\nAccording to Dr Johnson, Dryden remarked to him early in his career, \"Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet\"; and the ages of Enlightenment and Victoria found his rage, twisted logic and scatological tendencies rather hard to take (though Voltaire wrote him a fan letter stating \"The more I read your works, the more I am ashamed of mine\"). The twentieth century, needless to say, reads him precisely for these qualities: this, together with the diagnosis of his famed insanity at the end of his life as Méniere's disease, has rehabilitated his critical reputation. His many pamphlets and attacks on religious corruption and intellectual laziness are too specific to their times to reach a general readership, but Gulliver's Travels (the only work he was paid for) has been adored since its first publication, and was at first so convincing that, reported Swift to Pope, \"a Bishop here [in Ireland] said, that Book was full of improbable lies, and for his part he hardly believed a word of it; and so much for Gulliver.\"\n\nRecommended works\n\nGulliver's Travels; A Modest Proposal; the selected poems\n\nInfluences\n\nHe frequently followed classical models, either seriously or for sometimes scatological burlesque, and excelled at pastiche - mocking quack astrology, illogical polemic and unbelievable travellers' tales (the originals have now sunk into literature's footnotes).\n\nNow read on\n\nThough he's a unique voice, Swift had a big influence on Yeats and Joyce, while his famous \"savage indignation\" - which he had inscribed on his tombstone - and surreal content can be found today in Will Self. Peter Cook, too, had a Swiftian air.\n\nAdaptations\n\nGulliver's Travels has frequently been filmed, though often as bowdlerised fairytale (the 1939 all-singing, all-dancing sub-Disney cartoon has curiosity value). The watchable Richard Harris made a brave stab at seriousness in 1977.\n\nRecommended biography\n\nThe letters have been collected by H Williams, and there is a massive life by Ehrenpreis, Swift: The Man, His Works and His Age.\n\nCriticism\n\nGeorge Orwell has an excellent essay on Gulliver in Shooting an Elephant.\n\nWork online\n\n· Gulliver's Travels: text with notes and illustrations\n\n· Links to other works, including A Modest Proposal\n\n· Fragment of autobiography"
