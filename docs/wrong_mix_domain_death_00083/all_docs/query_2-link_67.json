        "text": "As Rochefoucauld his maxims drew\n\nFrom Nature, I believe 'em true:\n\nThey argue no corrupted mind\n\nIn him; the fault is in mankind.\n\nThis maxim more than all the rest\n\nIs thought too base for human breast:\n\n\"In all distresses of our friends,\n\nWe first consult our private ends;\n\nWhile Nature, kindly bent to ease us,\n\nPoints out some circumstance to please us.\"\n\nIf this perhaps your patience move,\n\nLet reason and experience prove.\n\nWe all behold with envious eyes\n\nOur equal rais'd above our size.\n\nWho would not at a crowded show\n\nStand high himself, keep others low?\n\nI love my friend as well as you\n\nBut would not have him stop my view.\n\nThen let him have the higher post:\n\nI ask but for an inch at most.\n\nIf in a battle you should find\n\nOne, whom you love of all mankind,\n\nHad some heroic action done,\n\nA champion kill'd, or trophy won;\n\nRather than thus be overtopt,\n\nWould you not wish his laurels cropt?\n\nDear honest Ned is in the gout,\n\nLies rack'd with pain, and you without:\n\nHow patiently you hear him groan!\n\nHow glad the case is not your own!\n\nWhat poet would not grieve to see\n\nHis brethren write as well as he?\n\nBut rather than they should excel,\n\nHe'd wish his rivals all in hell.\n\nHer end when emulation misses,\n\nShe turns to envy, stings and hisses:\n\nThe strongest friendship yields to pride,\n\nUnless the odds be on our side.\n\nVain human kind! fantastic race!\n\nThy various follies who can trace?\n\nSelf-love, ambition, envy, pride,\n\nTheir empire in our hearts divide.\n\nGive others riches, power, and station,\n\n'Tis all on me a usurpation.\n\nI have no title to aspire;\n\nYet, when you sink, I seem the higher.\n\nIn Pope I cannot read a line,\n\nBut with a sigh I wish it mine;\n\nWhen he can in one couplet fix\n\nMore sense than I can do in six;\n\nIt gives me such a jealous fit,\n\nI cry, \"Pox take him and his wit!\"\n\nWhy must I be outdone by Gay\n\nIn my own hum'rous biting way?\n\nArbuthnot is no more my friend,\n\nWho dares to irony pretend,\n\nWhich I was born to introduce,\n\nRefin'd it first, and show'd its use.\n\nSt. John, as well as Pultney, knows\n\nThat I had some repute for prose;\n\nAnd, till they drove me out of date,\n\nCould maul a minister of state.\n\nIf they have mortify'd my pride,\n\nAnd made me throw my pen aside;\n\nIf with such talents Heav'n has blest 'em,\n\nHave I not reason to detest 'em?\n\nTo all my foes, dear Fortune, send\n\nThy gifts; but never to my friend:\n\nI tamely can endure the first,\n\nBut this with envy makes me burst.\n\nThus much may serve by way of proem:\n\nProceed we therefore to our poem.\n\nThe time is not remote, when I\n\nMust by the course of nature die;\n\nWhen I foresee my special friends\n\nWill try to find their private ends:\n\nTho' it is hardly understood\n\nWhich way my death can do them good,\n\nYet thus, methinks, I hear 'em speak:\n\n\"See, how the Dean begins to break!\n\nPoor gentleman, he droops apace!\n\nYou plainly find it in his face.\n\nThat old vertigo in his head\n\nWill never leave him till he's dead.\n\nBesides, his memory decays:\n\nHe recollects not what he says;\n\nHe cannot call his friends to mind:\n\nForgets the place where last he din'd;\n\nPlies you with stories o'er and o'er;\n\nHe told them fifty times before.\n\nHow does he fancy we can sit\n\nTo hear his out-of-fashion'd wit?\n\nBut he takes up with younger folks,\n\nWho for his wine will bear his jokes.\n\nFaith, he must make his stories shorter,\n\nOr change his comrades once a quarter:\n\nIn half the time he talks them round,\n\nThere must another set be found.\n\n\"For poetry he's past his prime:\n\nHe takes an hour to find a rhyme;\n\nHis fire is out, his wit decay'd,\n\nHis fancy sunk, his Muse a jade.\n\nI'd have him throw away his pen;—\n\nBut here's no talking to some men!\"\n\nAnd then their tenderness appears,\n\nBy adding largely to my years:\n\n\"He's older than he would be reckon'd\n\nAnd well remembers Charles the Second.\n\n\"He hardly drinks a pint of wine;\n\nAnd that, I doubt, is no good sign.\n\nHis stomach too begins to fail:\n\nLast year we thought him strong and hale;\n\nBut now he's quite another thing:\n\nI wish he may hold out till spring.\"\n\nThen hug themselves, and reason thus:\n\n\"It is not yet so bad with us.\"\n\nIn such a case, they talk in tropes,\n\nAnd by their fears express their hopes:\n\nSome great misfortune to portend,\n\nNo enemy can match a friend.\n\nWith all the kindness they profess,\n\nThe merit of a lucky guess\n\n(When daily \"How d'ye's\" come of course,\n\nAnd servants answer, \"Worse and worse!\")\n\nWould please 'em better, than to tell,\n\nThat, \"God be prais'd, the Dean is well.\"\n\nThen he who prophecy'd the best\n\nApproves his foresight to the rest:\n\n\"You know I always fear'd the worst,\n\nAnd often told you so at first.\"\n\nHe'd rather choose that I should die,\n\nThan his prediction prove a lie.\n\nNot one foretells I shall recover;\n\nBut all agree to give me over.\n\nYet, should some neighbour feel a pain\n\nJust in the parts where I complain,\n\nHow many a message would he send?\n\nWhat hearty prayers that I should mend?\n\nInquire what regimen I kept,\n\nWhat gave me ease, and how I slept?\n\nAnd more lament when I was dead,\n\nThan all the sniv'llers round my bed.\n\nMy good companions, never fear;\n\nFor though you may mistake a year,\n\nThough your prognostics run too fast,\n\nThey must be verify'd at last.\n\nBehold the fatal day arrive!\n\n\"How is the Dean?\"—\"He's just alive.\"\n\nNow the departing prayer is read;\n\n\"He hardly breathes.\"—\"The Dean is dead.\"\n\nBefore the passing-bell begun,\n\nThe news thro' half the town has run.\n\n\"O, may we all for death prepare!\n\nWhat has he left? and who's his heir?\"—\n\n\"I know no more than what the news is;\n\n'Tis all bequeath'd to public uses.\"—\n\n\"To public use! a perfect whim!\n\nWhat had the public done for him?\n\nMere envy, avarice, and pride:\n\nHe gave it all—but first he died.\n\nAnd had the Dean, in all the nation,\n\nNo worthy friend, no poor relation?\n\nSo ready to do strangers good,\n\nForgetting his own flesh and blood?\"\n\nNow Grub-Street wits are all employ'd;\n\nWith elegies the town is cloy'd:\n\nSome paragraph in ev'ry paper\n\nTo cure the Dean or bless the Drapier.\n\nThe doctors, tender of their fame,\n\nWisely on me lay all the blame:\n\n\"We must confess his case was nice;\n\nBut he would never take advice.\n\nHad he been rul'd, for aught appears,\n\nHe might have liv'd these twenty years;\n\nFor, when we open'd him, we found\n\nThat all his vital parts were sound.\"\n\nFrom Dublin soon to London spread,\n\n'Tis told at Court, the Dean is dead.\n\nKind Lady Suffolk in the spleen\n\nRuns laughing up to tell the Queen.\n\nThe Queen, so gracious, mild, and good,\n\nCries, \"Is he gone! 'tis time he should.\n\nHe's dead, you say; why, let him rot:\n\nI'm glad the medals were forgot.\n\nI promis'd them, I own; but when?\n\nI only was the Princess then;\n\nBut now, as consort of a king,\n\nYou know, 'tis quite a different thing.\"\n\nNow Chartres, at Sir Robert's levee,\n\nTells with a sneer the tidings heavy:\n\n\"Why, is he dead without his shoes?\"\n\nCries Bob, \"I'm sorry for the news:\n\nO, were the wretch but living still,\n\nAnd in his place my good friend Will!\n\nOr had a mitre on his head,\n\nProvided Bolingbroke were dead!\"\n\nNow Curll his shop from rubbish drains:\n\nThree genuine tomes of Swift's remains!\n\nAnd then, to make them pass the glibber,\n\nRevis'd by Tibbalds, Moore, and Cibber.\n\nHe'll treat me as he does my betters,\n\nPublish my will, my life, my letters:\n\nRevive the libels born to die;\n\nWhich Pope must bear, as well as I.\n\nHere shift the scene, to represent\n\nHow those I love my death lament.\n\nPoor Pope will grieve a month, and Gay\n\nA week, and Arbuthnot a day.\n\nSt. John himself will scarce forbear\n\nTo bite his pen, and drop a tear.\n\nThe rest will give a shrug, and cry,\n\n\"I'm sorry—but we all must die!\"\n\nIndifference, clad in Wisdom's guise,\n\nAll fortitude of mind supplies:\n\nFor how can stony bowels melt\n\nIn those who never pity felt?\n\nWhen we are lash'd, they kiss the rod,\n\nResigning to the will of God.\n\nThe fools, my juniors by a year,\n\nAre tortur'd with suspense and fear;\n\nWho wisely thought my age a screen,\n\nWhen death approach'd, to stand between:\n\nThe screen remov'd, their hearts are trembling;\n\nThey mourn for me without dissembling.\n\nMy female friends, whose tender hearts\n\nHave better learn'd to act their parts,\n\nReceive the news in doleful dumps:\n\n\"The Dean is dead: (and what is trumps?)\n\nThen, Lord have mercy on his soul!\n\n(Ladies, I'll venture for the vole.)\n\nSix deans, they say, must bear the pall:\n\n(I wish I knew what king to call.)\n\nMadam, your husband will attend\n\nThe funeral of so good a friend.\n\nNo, madam, 'tis a shocking sight:\n\nAnd he's engag'd to-morrow night:\n\nMy Lady Club would take it ill,\n\nIf he should fail her at quadrille.\n\nHe lov'd the Dean—(I lead a heart)\n\nBut dearest friends, they say, must part.\n\nHis time was come: he ran his race;\n\nWe hope he's in a better place.\"\n\nWhy do we grieve that friends should die?\n\nNo loss more easy to supply.\n\nOne year is past; a different scene!\n\nNo further mention of the Dean;\n\nWho now, alas! no more is miss'd,\n\nThan if he never did exist.\n\nWhere's now this fav'rite of Apollo!\n\nDeparted:—and his works must follow;\n\nMust undergo the common fate;\n\nHis kind of wit is out of date.\n\nSome country squire to Lintot goes,\n\nInquires for \"Swift in Verse and Prose.\"\n\nSays Lintot, \"I have heard the name;\n\nHe died a year ago.\"—\"The same.\"\n\nHe searcheth all his shop in vain.\n\n\"Sir, you may find them in Duck-lane;\n\nI sent them with a load of books,\n\nLast Monday to the pastry-cook's.\n\nTo fancy they could live a year!\n\nI find you're but a stranger here.\n\nThe Dean was famous in his time,\n\nAnd had a kind of knack at rhyme.\n\nHis way of writing now is past;\n\nThe town hath got a better taste;\n\nI keep no antiquated stuff,\n\nBut spick and span I have enough.\n\nPray do but give me leave to show 'em;\n\nHere's Colley Cibber's birth-day poem.\n\nThis ode you never yet have seen,\n\nBy Stephen Duck, upon the Queen.\n\nThen here's a letter finely penn'd\n\nAgainst the Craftsman and his friend:\n\nIt clearly shows that all reflection\n\nOn ministers is disaffection.\n\nNext, here's Sir Robert's vindication,\n\nAnd Mr. Henley's last oration.\n\nThe hawkers have not got 'em yet:\n\nYour honour please to buy a set?\n\n\"Here's Woolston's tracts, the twelfth edition;\n\n'Tis read by every politician:\n\nThe country members, when in town,\n\nTo all their boroughs send them down;\n\nYou never met a thing so smart;\n\nThe courtiers have them all by heart:\n\nThose maids of honour who can read\n\nAre taught to use them for their creed.\n\nThe rev'rend author's good intention\n\nHath been rewarded with a pension.\n\nHe doth an honour to his gown,\n\nBy bravely running priestcraft down:\n\nHe shows, as sure as God's in Gloucester,\n\nThat Jesus was a grand imposter;\n\nThat all his miracles were cheats,\n\nPerform'd as jugglers do their feats:\n\nThe church had never such a writer;\n\nA shame he hath not got a mitre!\"\n\nSuppose me dead; and then suppose\n\nA club assembled at the Rose ;\n\nWhere, from discourse of this and that,\n\nI grow the subject of their chat.\n\nAnd while they toss my name about,\n\nWith favour some, and some without,\n\nOne, quite indiff'rent in the cause,\n\nMy character impartial draws:\n\n\"The Dean, if we believe report,\n\nWas never ill receiv'd at Court.\n\nAs for his works in verse and prose\n\nI own myself no judge of those;\n\nNor can I tell what critics thought 'em:\n\nBut this I know, all people bought 'em.\n\nAs with a moral view design'd\n\nTo cure the vices of mankind:\n\nHis vein, ironically grave,\n\nExpos'd the fool, and lash'd the knave.\n\nTo steal a hint was never known,\n\nBut what he writ was all his own.\n\n\"He never thought an honour done him,\n\nBecause a duke was proud to own him,\n\nWould rather slip aside and choose\n\nTo talk with wits in dirty shoes;\n\nDespis'd the fools with stars and garters,\n\nSo often seen caressing Chartres.\n\nHe never courted men in station,\n\nNor persons held in admiration;\n\nOf no man's greatness was afraid,\n\nBecause he sought for no man's aid.\n\nThough trusted long in great affairs\n\nHe gave himself no haughty airs:\n\nWithout regarding private ends,\n\nSpent all his credit for his friends;\n\nAnd only chose the wise and good;\n\nNo flatt'rers; no allies in blood:\n\nBut succour'd virtue in distress,\n\nAnd seldom fail'd of good success;\n\nAs numbers in their hearts must own,\n\nWho, but for him, had been unknown.\n\n\"With princes kept a due decorum,\n\nBut never stood in awe before 'em.\n\nHe follow'd David's lesson just:\n\n'In princes never put thy trust';\n\nAnd, would you make him truly sour,\n\nProvoke him with a slave in pow'r.\n\nThe Irish senate if you nam'd,\n\nWith what impatience he declaim'd!\n\nFair Liberty was all his cry,\n\nFor her he stood prepar'd to die;\n\nFor her he boldly stood alone;\n\nFor her he oft expos'd his own.\n\nTwo kingdoms, just as faction led,\n\nHad set a price upon his head;\n\nBut not a traitor could be found\n\nTo sell him for six hundred pound.\n\n\"Had he but spar'd his tongue and pen\n\nHe might have rose like other men:\n\nBut pow'r was never in his thought,\n\nAnd wealth he valu'd not a groat:\n\nIngratitude he often found,\n\nAnd pity'd those who meant the wound:\n\nBut kept the tenor of his mind,\n\nTo merit well of human kind:\n\nNor made a sacrifice of those\n\nWho still were true, to please his foes.\n\nHe labour'd many a fruitless hour\n\nTo reconcile his friends in pow'r;\n\nSaw mischief by a faction brewing,\n\nWhile they pursu'd each other's ruin.\n\nBut, finding vain was all his care,\n\nHe left the Court in mere despair.\n\n\"And, oh! how short are human schemes!\n\nHere ended all our golden dreams.\n\nWhat St. John's skill in state affairs,\n\nWhat Ormond's valour, Oxford's cares,\n\nTo save their sinking country lent,\n\nWas all destroy'd by one event.\n\nToo soon that precious life was ended,\n\nOn which alone our weal depended.\n\nWhen up a dangerous faction starts,\n\nWith wrath and vengeance in their hearts;\n\nBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound,\n\nTo ruin, slaughter, and confound;\n\nTo turn religion to a fable,\n\nAnd make the government a Babel;\n\nPervert the law, disgrace the gown,\n\nCorrupt the senate, rob the crown;\n\nTo sacrifice old England's glory,\n\nAnd make her infamous in story:\n\nWhen such a tempest shook the land,\n\nHow could unguarded Virtue stand?\n\n\"With horror, grief, despair, the Dean\n\nBeheld the dire destructive scene:\n\nHis friends in exile, or the tower,\n\nHimself within the frown of power,\n\nPursu'd by base envenom'd pens,\n\nFar to the land of slaves and fens;\n\nA servile race in folly nurs'd,\n\nWho truckle most when treated worst.\n\n\"By innocence and resolution,\n\nHe bore continual persecution,\n\nWhile numbers to preferment rose,\n\nWhose merits were, to be his foes;\n\nWhen ev'n his own familiar friends,\n\nIntent upon their private ends,\n\nLike renegadoes now he feels,\n\nAgainst him lifting up their heels.\n\n\"The Dean did by his pen defeat\n\nAn infamous destructive cheat;\n\nTaught fools their int'rest how to know,\n\nAnd gave them arms to ward the blow.\n\nEnvy hath own'd it was his doing,\n\nTo save that helpless land from ruin;\n\nWhile they who at the steerage stood,\n\nAnd reap'd the profit, sought his blood.\n\n\"To save them from their evil fate,\n\nIn him was held a crime of state.\n\nA wicked monster on the bench,\n\nWhose fury blood could never quench,\n\nAs vile and profligate a villain,\n\nAs modern Scroggs, or old Tresilian,\n\nWho long all justice had discarded,\n\nNor fear'd he God, nor man regarded,\n\nVow'd on the Dean his rage to vent,\n\nAnd make him of his zeal repent;\n\nBut Heav'n his innocence defends,\n\nThe grateful people stand his friends.\n\nNot strains of law, nor judge's frown,\n\nNor topics brought to please the crown,\n\nNor witness hir'd, nor jury pick'd,\n\nPrevail to bring him in convict.\n\n\"In exile, with a steady heart,\n\nHe spent his life's declining part;\n\nWhere folly, pride, and faction sway,\n\nRemote from St. John, Pope, and Gay.\n\n\"His friendships there, to few confin'd,\n\nWere always of the middling kind;\n\nNo fools of rank, a mongrel breed,\n\nWho fain would pass for lords indeed:\n\nWhere titles gave no right or power\n\nAnd peerage is a wither'd flower;\n\nHe would have held it a disgrace,\n\nIf such a wretch had known his face.\n\nOn rural squires, that kingdom's bane,\n\nHe vented oft his wrath in vain;\n\nBiennial squires to market brought;\n\nWho sell their souls and votes for nought;\n\nThe nation stripp'd, go joyful back,\n\nTo rob the church, their tenants rack,\n\nGo snacks with thieves and rapparees,\n\nAnd keep the peace to pick up fees;\n\nIn ev'ry job to have a share,\n\nA jail or barrack to repair;\n\nAnd turn the tax for public roads,\n\nCommodious to their own abodes.\n\n\"Perhaps I may allow, the Dean\n\nHad too much satire in his vein;\n\nAnd seem'd determin'd not to starve it,\n\nBecause no age could more deserve it.\n\nYet malice never was his aim;\n\nHe lash'd the vice, but spar'd the name;\n\nNo individual could resent,\n\nWhere thousands equally were meant.\n\nHis satire points at no defect,\n\nBut what all mortals may correct;\n\nFor he abhorr'd that senseless tribe\n\nWho call it humour when they gibe.\n\nHe spar'd a hump, or crooked nose,\n\nWhose owners set not up for beaux.\n\nTrue genuine dulness mov'd his pity,\n\nUnless it offer'd to be witty.\n\nThose who their ignorance confess'd\n\nHe ne'er offended with a jest;\n\nBut laugh'd to hear an idiot quote\n\nA verse from Horace, learn'd by rote.\n\n\"He knew a hundred pleasant stories\n\nWith all the turns of Whigs and Tories:\n\nWas cheerful to his dying day;\n\nAnd friends would let him have his way.\n\n\"He gave the little wealth he had\n\nTo build a house for fools and mad;\n\nAnd show'd by one satiric touch,\n\nNo nation wanted it so much.\n\nThat kingdom he hath left his debtor,\n\nI wish it soon may have a better.\"\n\nDans l'adversité de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons quelque chose, qui ne nous déplaît pas.\n\n[\"In the hard times of our best friends we find something that doesn't displease us.\"]\n\nForm: couplets: Composition Date: 1731\n\n1.Described on the original title-page as: \"Written by Himself: Nov.\n\n1731.\" First published in 1739. A shortened form of the poem with many\n\nalterations was printed by some of Swift's London acquaintances in 1739.Dissatisfied with this version, Swift immediately issued the complete poem,\n\nas given in the text, in Dublin. D.S.P.D.: Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin.\n\nLa Rochefoucauld (1613-1680) published in 1665 his Ré;flexions\n\nou Sentences et Maximes Morales. This maxim, number xcix in the first\n\nedition, was suppressed by the author in later editions.\n\n47 ff. Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot were Swift's closest friends, and fellow-members\n\nof the Scriblerus Club, with whom he had planned, in 1714, a general attack\n\non all the follies of the age, out of which eventually came The Dunciad,\n\nThe Beggar's Opera, and Gulliver's Travels. See head note\n\nto Pope's Dunciad.\n\n55.Arbuthnot, physician to Queen Anne, was the most successful imitator\n\nof Swift's ironical method in prose satire. See his History of John Bull.\n\n59. St. John: Viscount Bolingbroke, Tory Secretary of State, with whom\n\nSwift had been closely associated during his political career under the Harley\n\nadministration (1710-14). See note to Pope's Essay on Man, I, 1.\n\nPultney: originally a friend of Walpole's, but later, with Bolingbroke,\n\ncontributor to the political organ of the anti-Walpole faction, the Craftsman.\n\n80.Dean: Swift was made Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin, in 1713.\n\n83. vertigo: the giddiness Swift so often complained of, accompanied\n\nby loss of memory.\n\n128. approves: gives evidence of .\n\n165.

He had a\n\nway of insinuating himself into all ministers under every change, either as\n\npimp, flatterer, or informer. He was tried at seventy for a rape, and came\n\noff by sacrificing a great part of his fortune. He is since dead, but this poem\n\nstill preserves the scene and time it was writ in.\" (F)\n\n192. Bob: \"Sir Robert Walpole, chief minister of state, treated the Dean in\n\n1726, with great distinction; invited him to dinner at Chelsea, with the Dean's\n\nfriends chosen on purpose; appointed an hour to talk with him of Ireland, to\n\nwhich kingdom and people the Dean found him no great friend, for he\n\ndefended Wood's project of half-pence, etc. The Dean would see him no\n\nmore; and upon his next year's return to England, Sir Robert on an accidental\n\nmeeting, only made a civil compliment, and never invited him again.\" (F)\n\n194.

In one copy of the poem there is the following manuscript\n\naddition (possibly by Swift himself) in the form of a marginal note: \"The Irish\n\nParliament are reduced to the utmost degree of slavery, flattery, corruption, and\n\nmeanness of spirit and the worse they are treated, the more fawning and servile\n\nthey grow; under the greatest and most contemptuous grievances they dare not\n\ncomplain; by which baseness and tameness, unworthy human creatures, the\n\nkingdom is irrecoverably ruined.\" See also the poem entitled The Legion Club.\n\n351. \"In the year 1713, the late Queen was prevailed with by an address of the\n\nHouse of Lords in England to publish a proclamation promising three hundred\n\npounds to whatever person would discover the author of a pamphlet called\n\nThe Public Spirit of the Whigs; and in Ireland, in the year 1724, my\n\nLord Carteret at his first coming into the government, was prevailed on to\n\nissue a proclamation for promising the like reward of three hundred pounds\n\nto any person who could discover the author of a pamphlet called The\n\nDrapier's Fourth Letter, etc., writ against that destructive project of coining\n\nhalf-pence for Ireland; but in neither kingdom was the Dean discovered\" (F).\n\n365 ff. \"Queen Anne's ministry fell to variance from the first year after their\n\nministry began. Harcourt the Chancellor, and Lord Bolingbroke the Secretary,\n\nwere discontented with the Treasurer Oxford, for his too much mildness to the\n\nWhig party. This quarrel grew higher every day till the Queen's death. The\n\nDean, who was the only person that endeavoured to reconcile them, found it\n\nimpossible, and thereupon retired to the country about ten weeks before that\n\nfatal event: upon which he returned to his deanery in Dublin, where for many\n\nyears he was worried by the new people in power, and had hundreds of libels\n\nwrit against him in England.\" (F)\n\n374.

The greatest preferments in the Church in both\n\nkingdoms were given to the most ignorant men, fanatics were publicly caressed,\n\nIreland utterly ruined and enslaved, only great ministers heaping up millions,\n\nand so affairs continue until this present third day of May, 1732, and are likely\n\nto go on in the same manner.\" (F)\n\n394. \"Upon the Queen's death the Dean retired to live in Dublin, at his\n\ndeanery-house.

All the\n\nkingdom took the Drapier's part, except the courtiers or those who expected\n\nplaces. The Drapier was celebrated in many poems and pamphlets.
