        "text": "It’s hard to find the humor in evil when it grows beyond exaggeration.\n\nAs we have known for some time, comedy is dead: run over by the serial bandwagons of political correctness, and left as roadkill on the shoulder of the Highway of Progress. What were once considered masterpieces of the stand-up comedian’s art are now unspeakable, such as Henny Youngman’s perfectly crafted two-liner, “I dropped my wife off at the beauty parlor the other day. She was there for three and a half hours; and that was only for the estimate.” Indeed, such jokes are today stonable offenses.\n\nComedy can only take root in soil watered by self-reflection and quickened by the sunshine of liberty; in an age in which audiences are drunk on the sour grapes of resentment, victimhood, and fragile self-esteem, the comedic arts fall on stony ground. Ironically, comedy thrived even amongst the Untermenschen of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, though not, of course, among the self-serious fanatics of those ruling parties. And in our Western progressive theocracies, practically everyone who counts—the media, the academy, Big Business, Big Tech—is a member of the Party.\n\nAll of this is rather sad—some might say tragic—because comedy is one of the oldest literary genres in Western civilization. Its origins go back to the dramas performed in ancient Greek theaters a century or so before the tragedies of Aeschylus. Scholars refer to them as “satyr plays,” because the chorus consisted of actors dressed as such: in the costume of the lascivious and inebriated mythological beings imagined as goats below the waist and men above. Earnest feminists now regard all men as goats below the waist, and thus prime targets of comic ridicule, but Youngman’s suggestion that women can on occasion succumb to vanity is “stereotyping” and thus taboo.\n\nSatire is another extinct species of the comedic genre. In the hands of such masters as Horace, Ovid, Juvenal, and Lucian of Samosata, its golden age extended from the first century B.C. to the second A.D., during which everything was fair game—politics, religion, race, homosexuality—and the ability of dictatorial emperors to cancel and shame incorrect opinion remained a pitiful thing by comparison to that of our own progressive censors.\n\nEven under the supposedly repressive medieval Church, satire thrived in the works of such renowned poets as Chaucer, Chrétien de Troyes, Guillaume de Lorris, and Jean de Meun. As is depressingly typical of our humorless and revisionist age, tone deaf as it is to irony, de Meun’s monumental allegorical poem Roman de la Rose (c. 1275) continues to be misread as an earnest celebration of erotic passion, while it is in fact an uproarious moral satire on the sin of lust aggrandizing itself as a sacred “religion” of celestial love. Indeed, as the average medieval reader would have understood immediately, its dream vision is the allegorical transcript of a pubescent male’s nocturnal fantasy. Readers should think of the “garden of delights” as Woodstock, and its presiding spirit, Sir Pleasure, as Hugh Hefner.\n\nBut satire of the medieval—or any—sort is simply no longer possible. What passes for satire, such as the weekly collection of skits on the supposedly satirical Saturday Night Live, now amount to two hours of angry Democratic Party raillery. I don’t merely mean that satire is forbidden and that the would-be satirist will be susceptible to deplatforming, censorship, firing from his day job, Maoist struggle\n\nsessions, and public rituals of remorse. I mean that it is no longer possible in the sense that it is no longer even possible to write.\n\nSatire depends upon the exaggeration of evil, irrationality, or folly to its distillation point, to a reductio ad absurdum in which the latent or embryonic absurdity of an idea or practice becomes manifest to all. Satire is thus optimistic in adumbrating and seeking to preempt the hard landing at the base of the slippery moral slope—assuming, that is, we are still on the slippery slope. Once we have reached bottom, no reductio—and no satire—is any longer conceivable. The absurdity of the modern world speaks for itself; the plainly visible reality on its face is self-satirizing, or ought to be.\n\nJonathan Swift’s 1729 satirical masterpiece, A Modest Proposal, is a scathing exposé of the delusions of the social engineers, do-gooders, and busybodies of his day—the founding mothers of the modern welfare state—and their risible “solutions” to the problem of poverty. Through a series of rigorously logical deductions from their premises, Swift purports to end the scourge of starvation and overpopulation in Ireland by encouraging impoverished Irish parents to commit infanticide and eat their newborns, thus alleviating the economic burden of children and relieving their hunger at the same time.\n\nYou see the problem. In the 18th century, the intellectual incoherence and moral enormity of Swift’s “modest proposal” would have been instantly apparent to all. But after two centuries in which the coin of evil has undergone steady inflation, Swift’s repugnant “proposal” has been broadly implemented, and is scarcely controversial today. Tens of millions of abortions are committed every year around the world, and justified under the pretext that they will\n\nreduce the economic burden on single mothers and forestall the apocalypse of world hunger due to overpopulation. We don’t eat our aborted babies, of course, but we’ve found a myriad of other “altruistic” uses for their body parts.\n\nLet me close this literary obituary with two recent examples of social phenomena upon which the absurdity of no satirist could improve.\n\nIn a scholarly article in the eminent Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, one Dr. Donald Moss calls “whiteness … a malignant, parasitic-like condition to which ‘white’ people have a particular susceptibility.” He explains, “Parasitic whiteness renders its hosts’ appetites voracious, insatiable, and perverse. These deformed appetites particularly target nonwhite peoples.” From his position at the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in New York, Dr. Moss teaches students how to treat this appalling condition:\n\nEffective treatment consists of a combination of psychic and social-historical interventions. Such interventions can reasonably aim only to reshape Whiteness’s infiltrated appetites—to reduce their intensity, redistribute their aims, and occasionally turn those aims toward the work of reparation. When remembered and represented, the ravages wreaked by the chronic condition can function either as warning (“never again”) or as temptation (“great again”).\n\nNow, if you were writing a take-off on the current progressive dogmas of “critical race theory,” “systemic racism,” “white privilege” (and the supposed Trump Nazis who are exclusively responsible for these ills), would it be possible for even Swift to do better than the above?\n\nAs an erstwhile aspirant to Swift’s mantle, some time ago I began to compose a parody on the recruitment of children by homosexual and transgender activists in our public schools, government propaganda, and the ubiquitous corporate advertising for such annual celebrations as Pride Week, which has now become Holy Week in the liturgical calendar of progressives. Such campaigns of homosexual indoctrination struck me as especially ironic in the context of the law recently passed by Canada’s Parliament making illegal the “conversion” of children from “alternative lifestyles” to normalcy. In other words, any attempt to counsel gender dysphoric children by doctors, priests, or even their own parents is punishable by up to five years in prison in Canada, while conversion from normalcy to deviancy is the official policy of the State.\n\nI set out accordingly to satirically “exaggerate” such homosexual evangelism by depicting an oleaginous television preacher merchandising the promise of salvation through sex reassignment, punctuated by rousing hymns sung by the hundred-voice Sodom Tabernacle Choir. My assumption was that since Christian proselytism is so repugnant to moderns, homosexual missionizing, especially amongst children, ought to be equally repellent. Then, into my inbox came a YouTube music video that I shall attempt to describe to readers with iron stomachs.\n\nThe 2021 video opens with a soloist from the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus. Thumbnails of their boy-next-door visages are tiled across the screen, singing the following catchy lyrics set to music so insipidly hummable it might have been composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber:\n\nYou think we’re sinful,\n\nYou fight against our rights,\n\nYou say we all lead lives you can’t respect.\n\nBut you’re just frightened,\n\nYou think that we’ll corrupt your kids, if our agenda goes unchecked.\n\nIt’s funny, just this once you’re correct.\n\nWe’ll convert your children.\n\nHappens bit by bit, quietly and subtly,\n\nAnd you will barely notice it.\n\nYou can keep him from disco,\n\nWarn about San Francisco,\n\nMake him wear pleated pants, we don’t care.\n\nWe’ll convert your children…\n\nAnd so it goes, with admonitory boasts that intolerant parents who “worry” that their kids might “change their group of friends,” be exposed to child pornography online, or go places at night they “won’t approve,” might as well throw in the towel. Then it ends in a rousing full-choir refrain:\n\nWe’ll convert your children, yes we will, reaching one and all.\n\nThere’s really no escaping it….\n\nWe’re coming for them,\n\nWe’re coming for your children,\n\nWe’re coming for your children.\n\nCongratulations to YouTube, by the way, for not deplatforming this inspiring summons to pedophilia (and also for not deplatforming the recruitment propaganda of the Taliban, whose children I hope the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus will try to convert), but for removing those noxious videos criticizing the U.S. government’s most highly paid employee, Dr. Anthony Fauci (now retired).\n\nAnd stay tuned for the Chorus’s upcoming YouTube video featuring their other popular gay gospel hits, “How Great Lot Art,” “Go Tell It in the Schoolyard,” “Somewhere Over the Rainbow Flag,” “Don’t Cry for My Pedophilia,” and, that favorite of transitioning toddlers, “LGBT, EFG, Now I Know My ABCs.”"
