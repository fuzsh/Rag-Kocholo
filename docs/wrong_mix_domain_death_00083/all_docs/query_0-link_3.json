        "text": "This is the last part of a four-part series. Read the first part.\n\n(EDITOR’s NOTE: ALL QUOTATIONS IN THIS ARTICLE ARE TAKEN EITHER FROM OFFICIAL RECORDS OR FROM CONVERSATIONS, TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM, BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND THE PRINCIPALS.)\n\nInstitutional dourness and cheerful domesticity coexist on the fourth floor of the Finney County Courthouse, in Garden City, Kansas. The presence of the county jail supplies the first quality, and the so-called Sheriff’s Residence, a pleasant apartment separated from the five cells that make up the jail proper by steel doors and a short corridor, accounts for the second. For the last three years, the Sheriff’s Residence has in fact been occupied not by the sheriff, Earl Robinson, but by the under-sheriff and his wife, Wendle and Josephine—or Josie—Meier. The Meiers have been married more than twenty years. They are much alike—tall people with weight and strength to spare, with wide hands, with square and calm faces, and a kindly look, the last being especially true of Mrs. Meier, a direct and practical woman who nevertheless seems illuminated by a quite mystical serenity. As the under-sheriff’s helpmate, she puts in long hours; between five in the morning, when she begins the day by reading a chapter in the Bible, and 10 P.M., her bedtime, she cooks for the prisoners, sews and darns for them, does their laundry, takes splendid care of her husband, and looks after the five-room Sheriff’s Residence, with its gemütlich mélange of plump hassocks and squashy chairs and cream-colored lace window curtains. The Meiers have one child, a daughter, who is married to a Kansas City policeman, so the couple live alone—or, as Mrs. Meier more correctly puts it, “alone except for whoever happens to be in the ladies’ cell.”\n\nThe jail actually contains six cells. The sixth, the one reserved for female prisoners, is actually an isolated unit situated inside the Sheriff’s Residence; indeed, it adjoins the Meiers’ kitchen. “But that don’t worry me,” says Josie Meier, “I enjoy the company. Having somebody to talk to while I’m doing my kitchen work. Most of those women, you got to feel sorry for them. Just met up with Old Man Trouble is all. Course, Smith and Hickock was a different matter. Far as I know, Perry Smith was the first man ever stayed in the ladies’ cell. The reason was the sheriff wanted to keep him and Hickock separated from each other until after their trial.” Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock were a young pair of ex-convicts who had confessed that in November of 1959 they murdered in his home a prominent Finney County farm rancher, Herbert W. Clutter, and three members of his family: his wife, Bonnie; their sixteen-year-old daughter, Nancy; and a son, Kenyon, fifteen. Smith and Hickock were arrested on December 30, 1959, in Las Vegas, Nevada; on January 6, 1960, they were returned to Garden City to await trial. Robbery and a desire to avoid the consequences of possible identification were the confessed motives for the crime.\n\n“The afternoon they brought them in, I made six apple pies and baked some bread and all the while kept track of the goings on down there on Courthouse Square,” Josie recalls. “My kitchen window overlooks the square; you couldn’t want a better view. I’m no judge of crowds, but I’d guess there were several hundred people waiting to see the boys that killed the Clutter family. I never met any of the Clutters myself, but from everything I’ve ever heard about them they must have been very fine people. What happened to them is hard to forgive, and I know Wendle was worried how the crowd might act when they caught sight of Smith and Hickock. He was afraid somebody might try to get at them. So I kind of had my heart in my mouth when I saw the cars arrive, saw the reporters—all the newspaper fellows running and pushing. But by then it was dark, after six, and bitter cold, and more than half the crowd had given up and gone home. The ones that stayed, they didn’t say boo. Only stared. Later, when they brought the boys upstairs, the first one I saw was Hickock. He had on light summer pants and just an old cloth shirt. Surprised he didn’t catch pneumonia, considering how cold it was. But he looked sick, all right. White as a ghost. Well, it must be a terrible experience—to be stared at by a horde of strangers, to have to walk among them, and them knowing who you are and what you did. Then they brought up Smith. I had some supper ready to serve them in their cells—hot soup and coffee and some sandwiches and pie. Ordinarily, we feed just twice a day—breakfast at seven-thirty, and at four-thirty we serve the main meal—but I didn’t want those fellows going to bed on an empty stomach; seemed to me they must be feeling bad enough without that. But when I took Smith his supper—carried it in on a tray—he said he wasn’t hungry. He was looking out the window of the ladies’ cell. Standing with his back to me. That window has the same view as my kitchen window—trees and the square and the tops of houses. I told him, ‘Just taste the soup—it’s vegetable, and not out of a can. I made it myself. The pie, too.’ In about an hour, I went back for the tray, and he hadn’t touched a crumb. He was still at the window. Like he hadn’t moved. It was snowing, and I remember saying it was the first snow of the year, and how we’d had such a beautiful long autumn right till then. And now the snow had come. And then I asked him if he had any special dish he liked—if he did, I’d try and fix it for him the next day. He turned round and looked at me. Suspicious. Like I might be mocking him. Then he said something about a movie; he had such a quiet way of speaking—almost a whisper. Wanted to know if I had seen a movie—I forget the name. Anyway, I hadn’t seen it; never have been much for picture shows. He said this show took place in Biblical times, and there was a scene where a man was flung off a balcony, thrown to a mob of men and women, who tore him to pieces. And he said that was what came to mind when he saw the crowd on the square. The man being torn apart. And the idea that maybe that was what they might do to him. Said it scared him so bad his stomach still hurt. Which was why he couldn’t eat. Course, he was wrong, and I told him so—nobody was going to harm him, regardless of what he’d done; folks around here aren’t like that. We talked some—he was very shy—but after a while he said, ‘One thing I really like is Spanish rice.’ So I promised to make him some, and he smiled, kind of, and I decided—well, he wasn’t the worst young man I ever saw. That night, after I’d gone to bed, I said as much to my husband. But Wendle snorted. Wendle was one of the first on the scene after the crime was discovered. He said he wished I’d been out at the Clutter place when they found the bodies. Then I could’ve judged for myself just how gentle Mr. Smith was. Him and his friend Hickock. He said they’d cut out your heart and never bat an eye. There was no denying it. Not with four people dead. And I lay awake wondering if either one was bothered by it—the thought of those four graves.”\n\nA month passed, and another, and it snowed some part of almost every day. Snow whitened the wheat-tawny countryside, heaped the streets of the town, hushed them. The topmost branches of a snow-laden elm touched the window of the ladies’ cell. Squirrels lived in the tree, and Perry, after weeks of tempting them with scraps left over from breakfast, lured one off a branch onto the window sill and through the bars. It was a male squirrel, with auburn fur. He named the squirrel Big Red, and Big Red soon settled down, apparently content to share his friend’s captivity. Perry taught him several tricks—to play with a paper ball, to beg, to perch on his shoulder. All this helped to pass time, but still there were many hours the prisoner had somehow to lose. He was not allowed to read newspapers, and he was bored by the magazines Mrs. Meier lent him—old issues of Good Housekeeping and McCall’s. But he found things to do: file his fingernails with an emery board and buff them to a silky pink sheen; comb and comb his lotion-soaked-and-scented hair; brush his teeth three and four times a day; shave and shower almost as often. And he kept the cell, which contained a toilet, a washbasin, a shower stall, a cot, a chair, and a table, as neat as his person. He was proud of a compliment Mrs. Meier had paid him. “Look!” she had said, pointing at his bunk. “Look at that blanket! You could bounce dimes.” But it was at the table that he spent most of his waking life. He ate his meals there; it was where he sat when he sketched portraits of Big Red and did drawings of flowers, and the face of Jesus, and the faces and torsos of imaginary women; and it was where, on cheap sheets of ruled paper, he made diarylike notes of day-to-day occurrences.\n\n“Thursday 7 January. Dewey here. Brought carton cigarettes. Also typed copies of Statement for my signature. I declined.” The “Statement,” a seventy-eight-page document he had dictated to the Finney County court stenographer, recounted admissions—including the murder of the Clutter father and son—that he had already made to Alvin Dewey and Clarence Duntz, Special Agents of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, who had questioned him in Las Vegas after his arrest. Dewey, speaking of his encounter with Perry Smith on January 7th, remembered that he had been “very surprised” when Perry refused to sign the statement. “It wasn’t important,” Dewey said. “I could always testify in court as to the oral confession he’d made to Duntz and myself. And, of course, Hickock had given us a signed confession while we were still in Las Vegas—in which he accused Smith of having committed all four murders. But I was curious. I asked Perry why he’d changed his mind. And he said, ‘Everything in my statement is accurate except for two details. If you’ll let me correct those items, then I’ll sign it.’ Well, I could guess the items he meant. Because the only serious difference between his story and Hickock’s was that he denied having murdered the Clutters singlehanded. Until now, he’d sworn Hickock killed Nancy and her mother. And I was right! That’s just what he wanted to do—admit that Hickock had been telling the truth, and that it was he, Perry Smith, who had shot and killed the whole family. He said he’d lied about it because, in his words, ‘I wanted to fix Dick. For being such a coward. Dropping his guts all over the goddam floor’ And the reason he’d decided to set the record straight wasn’t that he suddenly felt any kinder toward Hickock. According to him, he was doing it out of consideration for Hickock’s parents—said he was sorry for Dick’s mother. Said, ‘She’s a real sweet person. It might be some comfort to her to know Dick never pulled the trigger. None of it would have happened without him—in a way, it was mostly his fault—but the fact remains I’m the one who killed them.’ But I wasn’t certain I believed it. Not to the extent of letting him alter his statement. As I say, we weren’t dependent on a formal confession from Smith to prove any part of our case. With or without it, we had enough to hang them ten times over.” Among the elements contributing to Dewey’s confidence was the recovery of a radio and a pair of binoculars that the murderers had stolen from the Clutter house and eventually disposed of in Mexico City (where a K.B.I. agent named Harold Nye, having flown there for the purpose, traced them to a pawnshop). Moreover, Perry, while dictating his statement, had revealed the whereabouts of other potent evidence. “We hit the highway and drove east,” he’d said, in the process of describing what he and Dick had done after leaving Holcomb, the village where the murders took place. “Drove like hell, Dick driving. I think we both felt very high. I did. Very high, and very relieved at the same time. Couldn’t stop laughing, neither one of us. Suddenly it all seemed very funny—I don’t know why, it just did. But the gun was dripping blood, and my clothes were stained—there was even blood in my hair. So we turned off onto a country road, and drove maybe eight miles, till we were way out on the prairie. You could hear coyotes. We smoked a cigarette, and Dick went on making jokes. About what had happened back there. I got out of the car and siphoned some water out of the water tank and washed the blood off the gun barrel. Then I scraped a hole in the ground with Dick’s hunting knife—the one I used on Mr. Clutter—and buried in it the empty shells and all the leftover nylon cord and adhesive tape. After that, we drove till we came to U.S. 83, and headed east toward Kansas City and Olathe [Hickock’s home town]. Around dawn, Dick stopped at one of those picnic places—what they call rest areas—where they have open fireplaces. We built a fire and burned stuff. The gloves we’d worn, and my shirt. Dick said he wished we had an ox to roast; he said he’d never been so hungry. It was almost noon when we got to Olathe, Dick dropped me at my hotel, and went on home to have Sunday dinner with his family. Yes, he took the knife with him. The gun, too.” K.B.I. agents were dispatched to Hickock’s home, a four-room farmhouse near Olathe, and they found the knife inside a fishing-tackle box and the shotgun casually propped against a kitchen wall. (Hickock’s father, who refused to believe that his “boy” could have taken part in such a “horrible crime,” insisted that the gun hadn’t been out of the house since the first week in November, and therefore couldn’t be the death weapon.) As for the empty cartridge shells, the cord, and the tape, these were retrieved with the aid of Virgil Pietz, a county-road worker, who, using a road grader in the area pinpointed by Perry Smith, shaved away the earth inch by inch until the buried articles were uncovered. Thus the last loose strings were tied. The K.B.I. had now assembled an unshakable case, for the tests established that the shells had been discharged by Hickock’s shotgun, and the remnants of cord and tape were of a piece with the materials used to bind and silence the victims.\n\n“Monday 11 January. Have a lawyer. Mr. Fleming. Old man with red tie.” Having been informed by the defendants that they were without funds to hire legal counsel, the court, in the person of District Judge Roland H. Tate, appointed as their representatives two local lawyers, Arthur Fleming and Harrison Smith. Fleming, who was seventy-one, was a former mayor of Garden City, a short man who habitually enlivened an unsensational appearance with rather conspicuous neckwear. He resisted the assignment. “I do not desire to serve,” he told the judge. “But if the court sees fit to appoint me, then, of course, I have no choice.” Hickock’s attorney, Harrison Smith, was forty-five, six feet tall, a golfer, and an Elk of exalted degree. He accepted the task with resigned grace: “Someone has to do it. And I’ll do my best. Though I doubt that’ll make me too popular around here.”\n\n“Friday 15 January. Mrs. Meier playing radio in her kitchen and I heard man say the County Attorney will seek Death Penalty. ‘The rich never hang. Only the poor and friendless.’ ” In making his announcement, the County Attorney, Duane West, an ambitious, portly man of twenty-eight who looks forty, told newsmen that day, “If the case goes before a jury, I will request the jury, upon finding them guilty, to sentence them to the death penalty. If the defendants waive right to jury trial and enter a plea of guilty before the judge, I will request the judge to set the death penalty. This was a matter I knew I would be called upon to decide, and my decision has not been arrived at lightly. I feel that, due to the violence of the crime and the apparent utter lack of mercy shown the victims, the only way the public can be absolutely protected is to have the death penalty set against these defendants. This is especially true since in Kansas there is no such thing as life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Persons sentenced to life imprisonment actually serve, on the average, less than fifteen years.”\n\n“Wednesday 20 January. Asked to take lie-detector in regards to this Walker deal.” A case like the Clutter case—a crime of such magnitude—arouses the interest of law-enforcement men everywhere, and particularly those investigators burdened with similar but unsolved crimes, for it is always possible that the solution to one mystery will solve another. Among the many officers alert to events in Garden City was the sheriff of Sarasota County, which includes Osprey, Florida, a fishing settlement not far from Tampa, and the scene, slightly more than a month after the Clutter tragedy, of a quadruple slaying on an isolated cattle-raising ranch. Again the victims were four members of a family—a young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Walker, and their two children, a boy and a girl, all of whom had been shot in the head with a rifle. Parallels aside, there was another circumstance that made Smith and Hickock first-class suspects: on the nineteenth of December, the date of the Walker murders, the Clutter murderers had spent the night in a Tallahassee hotel. Not unnaturally, Osprey’s sheriff, who had no other leads whatever, was anxious to have the two men questioned and a polygraph examination administered. Dick consented to take the test, and so did Perry, who told Kansas authorities he had seen reports of the slaying in a Miami newspaper: “I remarked at the time, I said to Dick, I’ll bet whoever did this must be somebody that read about what happened out here in Kansas. A nut.” The results of the test—to the dismay of Alvin Dewey, who does not believe in extraordinary coincidences—were decisively negative. The murderer of the Walker family remains unknown.\n\n“Sunday 31 January. Dick’s dad here to visit Dick. Said hello when I saw him go past [the cell door] but he kept going. Could be he never heard me. Understand from Mrs. M [Meier] that Mrs. H [Hickock] didn’t come because she felt too bad to. Snowing like a bitch. Dreamed last night I was up in Alaska with Dad—woke up in a puddle of cold urine!!!” Mr. Hickock spent three hours with his son. Afterward, he walked through the snow to the Garden City depot, a work-worn old man, stooped and thinned down by cancer, which would kill him a few months later. At the station, while he was waiting for a homeward-bound train, he spoke to a reporter: “I seen Dick, uh-huh. We had a long talk. And I can guarantee you it’s not like people say. Or what’s put in the papers. Those boys didn’t go to that house planning to do violence. My boy didn’t. He may have some bad sides, but he’s nowhere near bad as that. Smitty’s the one. Dick told me he didn’t even know it when Smitty attacked the man [Mr. Clutter]—cut his throat. Dick wasn’t even in the same room. He only run in when he heard them struggling. Dick was carrying his shotgun, and how he described it was ‘Smitty took my shotgun and just blew that man’s head off.’ And he says, ‘Dad, I ought to have grabbed back the gun and shot Smitty dead, Killed him ’fore he killed the rest of that family. If I’d done it, I’d be better off than I am now.’ I guess he would, too. How it is, the way folks feel, he don’t stand no chance. They’ll hang them both. And having your boy hang, knowing he will—nothing worse can happen to a man.”\n\nPerry Smith’s only living relatives were his father and a sister, and neither of them wrote to him or came to see him. The father, Tex John Smith, was presumed to be prospecting for gold somewhere in Alaska—though investigators, despite great efforts, had been unable to locate him. The sister, on the other hand, had told investigators that she was afraid of her brother, and requested that they please not let him know her address. (When Perry was informed of this, he smiled slightly and said, “I wish she’d been in that house that night. What a sweet scene!”) Except for the squirrel, and except for the Meiers and an occasional consultation with his lawyer, Mr. Fleming, he was very much alone. He missed Dick. “Many thoughts of Dick,” he wrote in his makeshift diary one day. Since their arrest, they had not been allowed to communicate, and, freedom apart, that was what he most desired—to talk to Dick, be with him again. Dick was not the “hard rock” that Perry had once thought him—“pragmatic,” “virile,” “a real brass boy.” He had proved to be “pretty weak and shallow,” “a coward.” Still, of everyone in all the world, this, for the moment, was the person to whom he was closest, for at least they were of the same species, brothers in the breed of Cain, and, separated from Dick, Perry felt “all by myself. Like somebody covered with sores. Somebody only a big nut would have anything to do with.”\n\nBut then, one morning in mid-February, Perry received a letter. It was postmarked Reading, Massachusetts, and it went, “Dear Perry, I was sorry to hear about the trouble you are in and I decided to write and let you know that I remember you and would like to help you in any way that I can. In case you don’t remember my name, Don Cullivan, I’ve enclosed a picture taken at about the time we met. When I first read about you in the news recently I was startled and then I began to think back to those days when I knew you. While we were never close personal friends I can remember you a lot more clearly than most fellows I met in the Army. It must have been about the fall of 1951 when you were assigned to the 761st Engineer Light Equipment Company at Fort Lewis, Washington. You were short (I’m not much taller), solidly built, dark with a heavy shock of black hair and a grin on your face almost all the time. Since you had lived in Alaska quite a few of the fellows used to call you ‘Eskimo.’ One of my first recollections of you was at a Company inspection in which all footlockers were open for inspection. As I recall it all the footlockers were in order, even yours, except that the inside cover of your footlocker was plastered with pictures of pin-up girls. The rest of us were sure you were in for trouble. But the inspecting officer took it in stride and when it was all over and he let it pass I think we felt you were a nervy guy. I remember that you were a fairly good pool player and I can picture you quite clearly in the Company day room at the pool table. You were one of the best truck drivers in the outfit. Remember the Army field problems we went out on? On one trip that took place in the winter I remember that we each were assigned to a truck for the duration of the problem. In our outfit, Army trucks had no heaters and it used to get pretty cold in those cabs. I remember you cutting a hole in the floorboards of your truck in order to let the heat from the engine come into the cab. The reason I remember this so well is the impression it made on me because ‘mutilation’ of Army property was a crime for which you could get severely punished. Of course I was pretty green in the Army and probably afraid to stretch the rules even a little bit, but I can remember you grinning about it (and keeping warm) while I worried about it (and froze). I recall that you bought a motorcycle, and vaguely remember you had some trouble with it—chased by the police?—crackup? Whatever it was, it was the first time I realized the wild streak in you. Some of my recollections may be wrong; this was over eight years ago and I only knew you for a period of about eight months. From what I remember, though, I got along with you very well and rather liked you. You always seemed cheerful and cocky, you were good at your Army work and I can’t remember that you did much griping. Of course you were apparently quite wild but I never knew too much about that. But now you are in real trouble. I try to imagine what you are like now. What you think about. When first I read about you I was stunned. I really was. But then I put the paper down and turned to something else. But the thought of you returned. I wasn’t satisfied just to forget. I am, or try to be, fairly religious [Catholic]. I wasn’t always. I used to just drift along with little thought about the only important thing there is. I never considered death or the possibility of a life hereafter. I was too much alive: car, college, dating etc. But my kid brother died of leukemia when he was just 17 years old. He knew he was dying and afterward I used to wonder what he thought about. And now I think of you, and wonder what you think about. I didn’t know what to say to my brother in the last weeks before he died. But I know what I’d say now. And this is why I am writing you: because God made you as well as me and He loves you just as He loves me, and for the little we know of God’s will what has happened to you could have happened to me. Your friend, Don Cullivan.”\n\nThe name meant nothing, but Perry at once recognized the face in the photograph—a young soldier with crew-cut hair and round, very earnest eyes. He read the letter many times; though he found the religious passages unpersuasive (“I’ve tried to believe, but I don’t, I can’t, and there’s no use pretending”), he was thrilled by it. Here was someone offering help, a sane and respectable man who had once known and liked him, a man who signed himself “friend.”\n\nGratefully, in great haste, he started a reply: “Dear Don, Hell yes I remember Don Cullivan. . . .”\n\nDick Hickock’s cell had no window—he faced a wide corridor and the façades of other cells—but he was not isolated. There were people to talk to—a plentiful turnover of drunkards, forgers, wife beaters, and Mexican vagrants—and Dick, with his lighthearted “con-man” patter, his sex anecdotes and gamy jokes, was popular with the inmates. (There was one, though, who had no use for him whatever—an old man who yelled at him, “Killer! Killer!,” and who once drenched him with a bucketful of dirty scrub water.) Outwardly, Hickock seemed to one and all an exceptionally untroubled young man. When he was not talking or sleeping, he lay on his cot smoking or chewing gum and reading sports magazines or paperback thrillers. Often, he simply lay there whistling old favorites (“You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,” “Shuffle Off to Buffalo”) and staring at an unshaded light bulb that burned day and night in the ceiling of the cell. He hated the light bulb’s monotonous surveillance; it disturbed his sleep and, more explicitly, endangered the success of a private project—escape. For the prisoner was not as unconcerned as he appeared to be, or as resigned; he intended taking every step possible to avoid “a ride on the Big Swing.” Convinced that such a ceremony would be the outcome of any trial—certainly any trial held in the State of Kansas—he had decided to “bust jail, grab a car, and raise dust.” But first he must have a weapon, and, over a period of weeks, he had been making one: a shiv, an instrument very like an icepick—something that would fit with lethal niceness between the shoulder blades of Under-sheriff Meier. The components of the weapon—a piece of wood and a piece of hard wire—were originally part of a toilet brush he had appropriated, dismantled, and hidden under his mattress. Late at night, when the only noises were snores and coughs and the lugubrious whistle-wailings of Santa Fe trains rumbling through the darkened town, he honed the wire against the concrete floor of the cell. And while he worked he schemed.\n\nOnce, the winter after he finished high school, he had hitchhiked across Kansas and Colorado. “This was when I was looking for a job,” he recalled one day. “Well, I was riding in a truck, and the driver, me and him got into a little argument, no reason exactly, but he beat up on me. Shoved me out. Just left me there. High the hell up in the Rockies. It was sleeting, like, and I walked miles, my nose bleeding like fifteen pigs. Then I come to a bunch of cabins on a wooded slope. Summer cabins, all locked up and empty that time of year. And I broke into one of them. There was firewood and canned goods, even some whiskey. I laid up there over a week, and it was one of the best times I ever knew. Despite the fact my nose hurt so and my eyes were green and yellow. But when the snow stopped, the sun came out. You never saw such skies. Like Mexico. If Mexico was in a cold climate. I hunted through the other cabins and found some smoked hams and a radio and a rifle. It was great. Out all day with a gun. With the sun in my face. Boy, I felt good. I felt like Tarzan. And every night I ate beans and fried ham and rolled up in a blanket by the fire and fell asleep listening to music on the radio. Nobody came near the place. I bet I could’ve stayed till spring.” That, provided the escape succeeded, was the course he had determined upon: to head for the Colorado mountains, and find there a cabin where he could hide until spring—alone, of course. (Perry’s future did not concern him.) The prospect of so idyllic an interim added to the inspired stealth with which he whetted his wire, filed it to a limber stiletto fineness.\n\n“Thursday 10 March. Sheriff had a shake-out. Searched through all the cells and found a shiv tucked under D’s mattress. Wonder what he had in mind (smile).” Not that Perry really considered it a smiling matter, for Dick, flourishing a dangerous weapon, could have played a decisive role in plans he himself was forming.\n\nAs the weeks went by, Perry had become familiar with life on Courthouse Square—its habitués and their habits. The cats, for example, the two thin gray toms who appeared with every twilight and prowled the square, stopping to examine the cars parked around its periphery: behavior puzzling to him until Mrs. Meier explained that the cats were hunting food—dead birds caught in the vehicles’ engine grilles—and thereafter it pained him to watch their maneuvers, “because most of my life I’ve done what they’re doing, the equivalent.” And there was one man of whom he had grown especially aware: a robust, upright gentleman with hair like a gray-and-silver skullcap; his face, filled out, firm-jawed, was somewhat cantankerous in repose, the mouth down-curved, the eyes downcast as though in mirthless reverie—a picture of unsparing sternness. And yet this was at least a partly inaccurate impression, for now and again the prisoner glimpsed him as he paused to talk to other men, joke with them, and laugh, and then he seemed carefree, jovial, generous, “the kind of person who might see the human side”—an important attribute, for the man was Roland H. Tate, Judge of the Thirty-second Judicial District, the jurist who would preside at the trial of the State of Kansas vs. Hickock and Smith. The name Tate, as Perry soon learned, was an old and awesome one in western Kansas. The judge was rich, he raised horses, he owned much land, and his wife was said to be very beautiful. He was the father of two sons, but the younger had died—a tragedy that had greatly affected the parents and had led them to adopt a small boy who appeared one day in court as an abandoned, homeless child. “He sounds softhearted to me,” Perry once said to Mrs. Meier. “Maybe he’ll give us a break.” But that was not what Perry really believed. He believed what he’d written to Don Cullivan, with whom he now corresponded regularly: his crime was “unforgivable,” and he fully expected to “climb those thirteen steps.” However, he was not altogether without hope, for he, too, had plotted an escape. It depended upon a pair of young men whom he had often observed observing him. One was red-haired, the other dark. Sometimes, standing in the square under the tree that touched the cell window, they smiled and signalled to him—or so he imagined. Nothing was ever said, and always, after perhaps a minute, they drifted away. But the prisoner had convinced himself that the young men, possibly motivated by a desire for adventure, meant to help him escape. Accordingly, he drew a map of the square, indicating the points at which a “getaway car” could most advantageously be stationed. Beneath the map he wrote, “I need a Hacksaw Blade 5′′. Nothing else. But do you realize the consequences if you get caught (nod your head if you do)? It could mean a long stretch in prison. Or you might get killed. All for someone you don’t know. YOU BETTER THINK IT OVER!! Seriously! Besides, how do I know I can trust you? How do I know it isn’t a trick to get me out there and gun me down? What about Hickock? All preparations must include him.” He kept this document on his desk, wadded and ready to drop out the window the next time the young men appeared. But they never did; he never saw them again. Eventually, he wondered if perhaps he had invented them. (He once mentioned a notion that he “might not be normal, maybe insane.” This had troubled him “even when I was little,” he said, recalling, “My sisters laughed because I liked moonlight. To hide in the shadows and watch the moon.”)\n\nWhether the young men were phantoms or not, he ceased to think of them. Another method of escape, suicide, replaced them in his musings, and despite the jailer’s precautions (no mirror, no belt or tie or shoelaces), he had devised a way to do it. For in his cell, too, was a ceiling bulb that burned constantly; also, unlike Hickock, he had in his cell a broom, and by pressing the broom brush against the bulb he could unscrew it. One night, he dreamed that he had unscrewed the bulb, broken it, and, with the broken glass, cut his wrists and ankles. “I felt all breath and light leaving me,” he said, in a subsequent description of his sensations. “The walls of the cell fell away, the sky came down, I saw the big yellow bird.” Throughout his life—as a child, poor and meanly treated; as a footloose youth; as an imprisoned man—the yellow bird, huge and parrot-faced, had soared across his dreams, an avenging angel who savaged his enemies or, as now, rescued him in moments of mortal danger. “It lifted me,” he said. “I could have been light as a mouse. We went up, up. I could see the square below, men running, yelling, the sheriff shooting at us, everybody sore as hell because I was free, I was flying, I was better than any of them.”\n\nThe trial was scheduled to start March 22nd. In the weeks preceding that date, the defense attorneys frequently consulted the defendants. The advisability of requesting a change of venue was discussed, but the elderly Mr. Fleming warned his client, “It wouldn’t matter where in Kansas the trial was held. Sentiment’s the same all over the state. We’re probably better off in Garden City. This is a religious community. Eleven thousand population and twenty-eight churches, And most of the ministers are opposed to capital punishment, say it’s immoral, unchristian. Even the Reverend Mr. Cowan, the Clutters’ own minister and a close friend of the family—he’s been preaching against the death penalty in this very case. Remember, all we can hope is to save your lives. I think we stand as good a chance here as anywhere.”\n\nSoon after the original arraignment of Perry and Dick, their advocates appeared before Judge Tate to argue a motion urging comprehensive psychiatric examinations for the accused. Specifically, the court was asked to permit the State Hospital in Larned, Kansas—a mental institution with maximum-security facilities, a hundred miles east of Garden City—to take custody of the prisoners for the purpose of ascertaining whether they were “insane, imbeciles or idiots, unable to comprehend their position and aid in their defense.” Hickock’s attorney, Harrison Smith, informed the court that he had driven to Larned the previous day and conferred with several of the hospital’s staff. “We have no qualified psychiatrists in our own community,” the attorney noted. “In fact, Larned is the only place within a radius of two hundred and twenty-five miles where you’ll find such men—doctors trained to make serious psychiatric evaluations. That takes time—four to eight weeks. But the personnel with whom I discussed the matter said they were willing to start work at once—and, of course, Larned being a state institution, it won’t cost the county a nickel.”\n\nThis plan was opposed by the special assistant prosecuting attorney, Logan Green, who, certain that temporary insanity was the defense his antagonists would attempt to sustain in the forthcoming trial, feared that the ultimate outcome of the proposal would be, as he predicted in private conversation, the appearance on the witness stand of “a pack of headhealers” sympathetic to the defendants. (“Those fellows, they’re always crying over the killers. Never a thought for the victims.”) Mr. Green, a short, pugnacious man, a Kentuckian by birth, began by pointing out to the court that Kansas law in regard to sanity adheres to the M’Naghten Rule, the ancient British importation contending that if the delinquent knew the nature of his act and knew that it was wrong, then he is mentally competent and responsible for his actions. Furthermore, said Green, there was nothing in the Kansas statutes indicating that the physicians chosen to determine a defendant’s mental condition must have any particular qualifications. “Just plain doctors,” he explained. “Medical doctors in general practice. That’s all the law requires. We have sanity hearings in this county every year for the purpose of committing people to the institution. We never call anybody in from Larned or psychiatric institutions of any kind. Our own local physicians attend to the matter. It’s no great job to find whether a man is insane or an idiot or an imbecile. It is entirely unnecessary, a waste of time, to send the defendants to Larned.”\n\nIn rebuttal, Counsellor Smith suggested that the situation in question was “far graver than a simple sanity hearing in probate court.” Pleading with the judge quite directly, he added, “Two lives are at stake. Whatever their crime, these men are entitled to examination by persons of training and experience. Psychiatry has matured rapidly in the past twenty years. The federal courts are beginning to keep in tune with this science as related to people charged with criminal offenses. It just seems to me we have a golden opportunity to face up to the new concepts in this field.”\n\nIt was an opportunity that the judge preferred to reject, for, as a fellow-jurist once remarked, “Tate is what you might call a lawbook lawyer; he never experiments, he goes strictly by the text.” But this critic also said of him, “If I were innocent, he’s the first man I’d want on the bench. If I were guilty, the last.” Judge Tate did not entirely deny the motion; rather, he did exactly all that the law demanded by appointing a commission of three Garden City doctors and directing them to pronounce a verdict upon the mental capacities of the prisoners. In due course, the medical trio met the accused, and after an hour or so of conversational prying they announced that neither man suffered from any mental disorder. When Perry was told of their diagnosis, he said, “How would they know? They just wanted to be entertained—hear all the morbid details from the killer’s own terrible lips. Oh, their eyes were shining!” Hickock’s attorney was angry, too, and he at once travelled to Larned State Hospital, where he appealed for the unpaid services of a psychiatrist willing to go to Garden City and interview the defendants. One man volunteered, Dr. W. Mitchell Jones, and he was exceptionally competent—a sophisticated specialist in criminal psychology and the criminally insane, who had worked and studied in Europe and the United States. Dr. Jones agreed to examine Smith and Hickock, and, should his findings warrant it, to testify in their behalf.\n\nOn the morning of March 14th, counsel for the defense again stood before Judge Tate, on this occasion to plead for a postponement of the trial, which was then eight days distant. Two reasons were given. The first was that a “most material witness,” Hickock’s father, was currently too ill to testify. The second was subtler. During the past week, a boldly lettered notice had begun to appear in the town’s shopwindows; it was also displayed in banks, in restaurants, and at the railroad station, and it read, “H. W. CLUTTER ESTATE AUCTION SALE * 21 MARCH 1960 * AT THE CLUTTER HOMESTEAD.”\n\n“Now,” said Harrison Smith, addressing the bench, “I realize it is almost impossible to prove prejudice. But this sale, an auction of the victim’s estate, occurs one week from today—in other words, the very day before the trial begins. Whether that’s prejudicial to the defendants, I’m not able to state. But these signs, coupled with newspaper advertisements, and advertisements on the radio, will be a constant reminder to every citizen in the community, among whom one hundred and fifty have been called as prospective jurors.”\n\nThe judge was not impressed. He denied the motion without comment.\n\nEarlier in the year, Hideo Ashida, Mr. Clutter’s Japanese neighbor, had auctioned his farming equipment and moved to Nebraska. The Ashida sale, which was considered a success, attracted not quite a hundred customers. Slightly more than five thousand people attended the auction at River Valley Farm, the Clutter place, in Holcomb. Holcomb’s citizenry had expected an unusual turnout—the Ladies’ Circle of the Holcomb Community Church had converted one of the Clutter barns into a cafeteria stocked with two hundred homemade pies, two hundred and fifty pounds of hamburger meat, and sixty pounds of sliced ham—but no one had been prepared for the largest auction crowd in the history of western Kansas. Cars converged on Holcomb from half the counties in the state and from Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas, and Nebraska. They crawled bumper to bumper down the lane leading to River Valley Farm. It was the first time the public had been permitted to visit the Clutter place since the discovery of the murders, and this circumstance explained the presence of perhaps a third of the immense congregation—those who had come out of curiosity. And, of course, the weather was an aid to attendance, for by mid-March winter’s high snows had dissolved, and the earth beneath, thoroughly thawed, had emerged as acre upon acre of ankle-deep mud; there was not much a farmer could do until the ground hardened. “Land’s so wet and nasty, can’t work nohow,” said Mrs. Bill Ramsey, the wife of a farmer. “We figured we might as well drive on out to the sale.” Actually, it was a beautiful day. Spring. Though mud abounded underfoot, the sun, so long shrouded by cloud, seemed an object freshly made, and the trees—Mr. Clutter’s orchard of pear and apple trees, the elms shading the lane—were lightly veiled in a haze of green. The fine lawn surrounding the Clutter house was also newly green, and trespassers upon it, women anxious to have a closer look at the uninhabited home, crept across the grass and peered through the windows as though hopeful but fearful of discerning, in the gloom beyond the pleasant flower-print curtains, grim apparitions.\n\nShouting, the auctioneer praised his wares—tractors, trucks, wheelbarrows, nail kegs, sledgehammers, unused lumber, milk buckets, branding irons, horses, horseshoes, everything needed to run a ranch, from rope and harness to sheep dip and tin washtubs—and it was the prospect of buying this merchandise at bargain prices that had lured most of the crowd. Though the hands of bidders flickered shyly—work-roughened hands timid of parting with hard-earned cash—nothing went unsold. There was even someone keen to acquire a bunch of rusty keys, and a youthful cowboy wearing pale-yellow boots bought Kenyon Clutter’s “coyote wagon,” a dilapidated truck that the dead boy had used to harass coyotes, chasing them on moonlit nights. The sceneshifters—the men who hauled the smaller items on and off the auctioneer’s platform—were Paul Helm, Vic Irsik, and Alfred Stoecklein, each of them an old, still faithful employee of the late Herbert W. Clutter. Assisting at the disposal of his possessions was their final service, for today was their last day at River Valley Farm; the property had been leased to an Oklahoma rancher, and thenceforward strangers would live and work there. As the auction progressed, and Mr. Clutter’s worldly domain dwindled, gradually vanished, Paul Helm, remembering the burial of the murdered family, said, “It’s like a second funeral.”\n\nThe last things to go were three horses, including a dappled mare much beyond her prime, Nancy’s horse, big, fat Babe. When bidding on the horse began, it was late afternoon, school was out, and several schoolmates of Nancy’s were among the spectators. Susan Kidwell, Nancy’s closest friend, was there. Sue, who had adopted another of Nancy’s orphaned pets, a cat, wished she could give Babe a home, for she loved the old horse and knew how much Nancy had loved her. The two girls had often gone riding together on Babe’s wide back—jogged through the wheat fields on hot summer evenings, and down to the river, and into the water, the mare wading against the current until, as Sue once described it, “the three of us were cool as fish.” But Sue, because she lived with her mother in a small apartment, had no place to keep a horse. “I hear fifty . . . sixty-five . . . seventy . . .” The bidding was laggardly. Nobody seemed really to want Babe, and the man who got her—a Mennonite farmer, who said he might use her for plowing—paid seventy-five dollars. As he led Babe out of the corral, Sue Kidwell ran toward the horse. She raised her hand as though to wave goodbye, but instead she clasped it over her mouth.\n\nThe Garden City Telegram, the day before the trial started, printed the following editorial:\n\nSome may think the eyes of the entire nation are on Garden City during this sensational murder trial. But they are not. Even a hundred miles west of here in Colorado few persons are even acquainted with the case—other than just remembering some members of a prominent family were slain. This is a sad commentary on the state of crime in our nation. Since the four members of the Clutter family were killed last fall, several other such multiple murders have occurred in various parts of the country. Just during the few days leading up to this trial at least three mass-murder cases broke into the headlines. As a result, this crime and trial are just one of many such cases people have read about and forgotten. . . .\n\nAlthough the eyes of the nation were not upon them, the demeanor of the event’s main participants, from the court recorder to the judge himself, was, on the morning of the court’s first convening, unmistakably self-aware. The lawyers, all four of them, sported new suits, and the new shoes of the big-footed County Attorney creaked and squealed with every step. Dick Hickock, too, was sharply dressed, in clothes provided by his parents—trim blue serge trousers, a white shirt, a narrow dark-blue tie. Only Perry Smith, who owned neither jacket nor tie, seemed sartorially misplaced. Wearing an open-necked shirt (borrowed from Mr. Meier) and blue jeans rolled up at the cuffs, he looked as lonely and inappropriate as a seagull in a wheat field.\n\nThe courtroom, an unpretentious chamber on the third floor of the Finney County Courthouse, had dull white walls and furnishings of darkly varnished wood. The spectator benches could seat a hundred and sixty persons. On the morning of Tuesday, March 22nd, the benches were occupied exclusively by the venire of Finney County residents—all male—from which a jury was to be selected. Not many of the summoned citizenry seemed eager to serve. (One potential juror, in conversation with another, said, “They can’t use me. I can’t hear well enough,” to which his friend, after a bit of sly reflection, replied, “Come to think of it, my hearing’s not too good either.”) It was generally thought that the choosing of the jury would take several days. As it turned out, the process was completed within four hours. Moreover, the jury, including two alternate members, was extracted from the first forty-four candidates. Seven were rejected on peremptory challenge by the defense, and three were excused at the request of the prosecution; twenty more won dismissal either because they opposed capital punishment or because they admitted to having already formed a firm opinion regarding the guilt of the defendants. The fourteen men ultimately elected consisted of a half-dozen farmers, a pharmacist, a nursery manager, an airport employee, a well driller, two salesmen, a machinist, and the manager of a bowling alley. They were all family men (several had five children or more), and were seriously affiliated with one or another of the local churches. During the voir-dire examination, four of them told the court that they had been personally, though not intimately, acquainted with Mr. Clutter, but each of these, upon further questioning, said he did not feel that this circumstance would hinder his ability to reach an impartial verdict. The airport employee, a middle-aged man named N. L. Dunnan, said when he was asked his opinion of capital punishment, “Ordinarily I’m against it. But in this case no”—a declaration that to some who heard it seemed clearly indicative of prejudice. Dunnan was nevertheless accepted as a juror.\n\nThe defendants were inattentive observers of the voir-dire proceedings. The previous day, Dr. Jones, the psychiatrist who had volunteered to examine them, had interviewed each of them for approximately two hours. At the end of each interview, he had suggested that its subject write for him an autobiographical statement, and it was the act of drawing up these statements that occupied the accused throughout the hours spent assembling a jury. Seated at opposite ends of their counsel’s table, Dick worked with a pen and Perry with a pencil.\n\nSmith wrote, “I was born Perry Edward Smith Oct. 27 1928 in Huntington, Elko County, Nevada, which is situated way out in the boon docks, so to speak. I recall that in 1929 our family had ventured to Juneau, Alaska. In my family were my brother Tex Jr. (he later changed his name to James because of the ridicule of the name ‘Tex’ & also I believe he hated my father in his early years—my mother’s doing). My sister Fern (she also changed her name—to Joy). My sister Barbara. And myself. . . . In Juneau, my father was making bootleg hooch. I believe it was during this period my mother became acquainted with alcohol. Mom & Dad began having quarrels. I remember my mother was ‘entertaining’ some sailors while my father was away. When he came home a fight ensued, and my father, after a violent struggle, threw the sailors out & proceeded to beat my mother. I was frightfully scared, in fact all us children were terrified. Crying. I was scared because I thought my father was going to hurt me, also because he was beating my mother. I really didn’t understand why he was beating her but I felt she must have done something dreadfully wrong. The next thing I can vaguely recall is living in Fort Bragg, Calif. My brother had been presented a B.B. gun. He had shot a hummingbird, and after he had shot it he was sorry. I asked him to let me shoot the B.B. gun. He pushed me away, telling me I was too small. It made me so mad I started to cry. After I finished crying, my anger mounted again, and during the evening when the B.B. gun was behind the chair my brother was sitting in, I grabbed it & held it to my brother’s ear & hollered BANG! My father (or mother) beat me and made me apologize. My brother used to shoot at a big white horse ridden by a neighbor who went by our place on his way to town. The neighbor caught my brother and I hiding in the bushes and took us to Dad & we got a beating & brother had his B.B. gun taken away & I was glad he had his gun taken away! . . . This is about all I remember when we lived in Fort Bragg. (Oh! We kids used to jump from a hay-loft, holding an umbrella, onto a pile of hay on the ground.) My next recollection is several years later when we were living in Calif.? Nevada? I recall a very odious episode between my mother and a Negro. We children slept on a porch in the summertime. One of our beds was directly under my mother and father’s room. Everyone of us kids had taken a good look through the partly open curtain and seen what was going on. Dad had hired a Negro (Sam) to do odd jobs around the farm, or ranch, while he was working somewhere down the road. He used to come home late in the evening in his Model A truck. I do not recall the chain of events but assumed Dad had known or suspected what was happening. It ended in a seperation between Mom & Dad & Mom took us kids to San Francisco. She run off with Dad’s truck & all of the many souvenirs he brought from Alaska. I believe this was in 1935. In Frisco I was continuously in trouble. I had started to run around with a gang, all of which were older than myself. My mother was always drunk, never in a fit condition to properly provide and care for us. I run as free & wild as a coyote. There was no rule or discipline, or anyone to show me right from wrong. I came & went as I pleased—until my first encounter with Trouble. I was in & out of Detention Homes many many times for running away from home & stealing. I remember one place I was sent to. I had weak kidneys & wet the bed every night. This was very humiliating to me, but I couldn’t control myself. I was very severly beaten by the cottage mistress, who had called me names and made fun of me in front of all the boys. She used to come around at all hours of the night to see if I wet the bed. She would throw back the covers & furiously beat me with a large black leather belt—pull me out of bed by my hair & drag me to the bathroom & throw me in the tub & turn the cold water on & tell me to wash myself and the sheets. Every night was a nightmare. Later on she thought it was very funny to put some kind of ointment on my penis. This was almost unbearable. It burned something terrible. She was later discharged from her job. But this never changed my mind about her & what I wished I could have done to her & all the people who made fun of me.”\n\nThen, because Dr. Jones had said he must have the statement that very afternoon, Perry skipped forward to early adolescence and the years he and his father had lived together, the two of them wandering all over the Middle West and Far West, prospecting, trapping, doing odd jobs: “I loved my father but there were times when this love and affection I had for him drained from my heart like wasted water. Whenever he would not try to understand my problems. Give me a little consideration & voice & responsibility. I had to get away from him. When I was sixteen I joined the Merchant Marine. In 1948 I joined the army—the recruiting officer gave me a break and upped my test. From this time on I started to realize the importance of an education. This only added to the hatred and bitterness I held for others. I began to get into fights. I threw a Japanese policeman off a bridge into the water. I was court-martialled for demolishing a Japanese cafe. I was court-martialled again in Kyoto, Japan, for stealing a Japanese taxicab. I was in the army almost four years. I had many violent outbursts of anger while I served time in Japan & Korea. I was in Korea 15 months, was rotated and sent back to the states—and was given special recognition as being the first Korean Vet to come back to the territory of Alaska. Big write up, picture in paper, paid trip to Alaska by air, all the trimmings. I finished my army service in Ft. Lewis, Washington.”\n\nNow Perry hurried toward more recent history, including the motorcycle accident that had crippled him, and the burglary in Phillipsburg, Kansas, that had led to his first prison sentence: “I was sentenced to 5 to 10 years for grand larceny, burglary and jailbreak. I felt I was very unjustly dealt with. I became very bitter while I was in prison. Upon my release I was supposed to go to Alaska with my father—I didn’t go—I worked for awhile in Nevada and Idaho—went to Las Vegas and continued to Kansas where I got into the situation I’m in now. No time for more.” He signed his name, and added a postscript: “Would like to speak to you again. There’s much I haven’t said that may interest you. I have always felt a remarkable exhilaration being among people with a purpose and sense of dedication to carry out that purpose. I felt this about you in your presence.”\n\nDick did not write with his companion’s intensity. He occasionally stopped to listen to the questioning of a prospective juror or to stare at the faces around him—particularly, and with evident displeasure, at the muscular face of the County Attorney, Duane West, who was his own age, twenty-eight. But his statement, written in a stylized script that looked like slanting rain, was finished before the court adjourned for the day. He wrote, “I will try to tell you all I can about myself, though most of my early life is vague to me—up until about my tenth birthday. My school years went quite the same as most other boys my own age. I had my share of fights, girls, and other things that go with a growing boy. My home life was also normal, but as I told you before, I was hardly ever allowed to leave my yard and visit with playmates. My father was always strict about us boys [Dick and his brother] in that line. Also I had to help my dad quite a lot around the house. I can only remember my mother and dad having one argument that amounted to anything. What it was about, I don’t know. My dad bought me a bicycle once, and I believe that I was the proudest boy in town. It was a girl’s bike and he changed it over to a boy’s. He painted it all up and it looked like new. But I had a lot of toys when I was little, a lot for the financial condition that my folks were in. We were always what you would call semi-poor. Never down and out, but several times on the verge of it. My dad was a hard worker and did his best to provide for us. My mother also was always a hard worker. Her house was always neat, and we had clean clothes aplenty. I remember my dad used to wear those old fashioned flat crown caps, and he would make me wear them too, and I didn’t like them. In high-school I did real well, made above average grades the first year or two. But then started falling off a little. I had a girl friend. She was a nice girl, and I never once tried to touch her anyway but just kissing. It was a real clean courtship. While in school I participated in all the sports, and received 9 letters in all. Basketball, football, track and baseball. My senior year was best. I never had any steady girl, just played the field. That was when I had my first relationship with a girl. Of course I told the boys that I’d had a lot of girls. I got offers from two colleges to play ball, but never attended any of them. After I graduated from school I went to work for the Santa Fe railroad, and stayed until the following winter when I got layed off. The following spring I got a job with the Roark Motor Company. I had been working there about four months when I had a automobile wreck with a company car. I was in the hospital several days with extensive head injurys. While I was in the condition I was in I couldn’t find another job, so I was unemployed most of the winter. Meantime, I had met a girl and fallen in love. Her dad was a Baptist preacher and resented me going with her. In July we were married. All hell broke loose from her dad until he learned she was pregnant. But still he never wished me good luck and that has always gone against the grain. After we were married, I worked at a service-station near Kansas City. I worked from 8 at night till 8 in the morning. Sometimes my wife stayed with me all night—she was afraid I couldn’t keep awake, so she came to help me. Then I got an offer to work at Perry Pontiac, which I gladly accepted. It was very satisfactory, though I didn’t make a lot of money—$75 a week. I got along good with the other men, and was well liked by my boss. I worked there five years. During my employment there was the beginning of some of the lowest things I have ever done.” Here he revealed that he had pedophilic tendencies, and after describing several sample experiences he wrote, “I know it is wrong. But at the time I never give any thought to whether it is right or wrong. The same with stealing. It seems to be an impulse. One thing I never told you about the Clutter deal is this. Before I ever went to their house I knew there would be a girl there. I think the main reason I went there was not to rob them but to rape the girl. Because I thought a lot about it. That is one reason why I never wanted to turn back when we started to. Even when I saw there was no safe. I did make some advances toward the Clutter girl when I was there. But Perry never gave me a chance. I hope no one finds this out but you, as I haven’t even told my lawyer. There were other things I should have told you, but I’m afraid of my people finding them out. Because I am more ashamed of them (these things I did) than hanging. I have had sickness. I think caused from the car wreck I had. Spells of passing out, and sometimes I would hemorage at the nose and left ear. I had one at some peoples house by the name of Crist—they live south of my parents. Not long ago I had a piece of glass work out of my head. It came out the corner of my eye. My dad helped me to get it out. I figure I should tell you the things that led to my divorce, and things that caused me to go to prison. It started the early part of 1957. My wife and I were living in a apartment in Kansas City. I had quit my job at the automobile company, and went into the garage business for myself. I was renting the garage from a woman who had a daughter-in-law named Margaret. I met this girl one day while I was at work, and we went to have a cup of coffee. Her husband was away in the Marine Corps. To make a long story short, I started going out with her. My wife sued for divorce. I began thinking I never really loved my wife. Because if I had, I wouldn’t have done all the things I’d done. So I never fought the divorce. I started drinking, and was drunk for almost a month. I neglected my business, spent more money than I earned, wrote bad checks, and in the end became a thief. For this last I was sent to the penitentiary. My lawyer said I should be truthful with you as you can help me. And I need help, as you know.”\n\nThe next day, Wednesday, was the proper start of the trial; it was also the first time ordinary spectators were admitted into the courtroom—an area too small to accommodate more than a modest percentage of those who applied at the door. The best seats had been reserved for twenty members of the press and for such special personages as Hickock’s parents and Donald Cullivan—who, at the request of Perry Smith’s lawyer, had travelled from Massachusetts to appear as a character witness in behalf of his former Army friend. It had been rumored that the two surviving Clutter daughters would be present; they were not, nor did they attend any subsequent session. The family was represented by Mr. Clutter’s younger brother Arthur, who had driven a hundred miles to be there. He told newsmen, “I just want to get a good look at them [Smith and Hickock]. I just want to see what kind of animals they are. The way I feel, I could tear them apart.” Instead, he took a seat directly behind the defendants and fixed them with a gaze of unique persistence, as though he planned to paint their portraits from memory. Presently—and it was as if Arthur Clutter had willed him to do it—Perry Smith turned and looked at him, and recognized a face very like the face of the man he had killed: the same mild eyes, narrow lips, firm chin. Perry, who was chewing gum, stopped chewing; he lowered his eyes, a minute elapsed, then slowly his jaws began to move again. Except for this moment, Smith—and, for the most part, Hickock, too—affected a courtroom attitude that was simultaneously uninterested and disinterested. They chewed gum; they tapped their feet with languid impatience as the state summoned its first witness.\n\nNancy Ewalt. And, after Nancy, Susan Kidwell. The young girls described certain observations they had made upon entering the Clutter house on Sunday, November 15th: the quiet rooms, an empty purse on a kitchen floor, sunshine in a bedroom, and their schoolmate Nancy Clutter surrounded by her own blood. The defense waived cross-examination, a policy they also pursued with the next three witnesses—Nancy Ewalt’s father, Clarence, and Sheriff Earl Robinson, and the county coroner, Dr. Robert Fenton—each of whom added to the narrative of events of that sunny November morning: the discovery, finally, of all four victims, and accounts of how they looked, and, from Dr. Fenton, a clinical diagnosis of why (“Severe traumas to brain and vital cranial structures inflicted by a shotgun”).\n\nThen Richard G. Rohleder took the stand. Rohleder is chief investigator for the Garden City Police Department. His hobby is photography, and he is good at it. Rohleder had taken pictures that, when developed, revealed Hickock’s dusty footprints in the Clutter cellar—prints that the camera could discern, though not the human eye. And he had photographed the corpses—death-scene images that Alvin Dewey had pondered continuously while the murders were still unsolved. The point of Rohleder’s testimony was to establish the fact of his having made these pictures, which the prosecution proposed to put in evidence. Dick Hickock’s attorney objected: “The sole reason the pictures are being introduced is to prejudice and inflame the minds of the jurors.” Judge Tate overruled the objection, and allowed the photographs to be put in evidence, which meant that they must be shown to the jury. While this was being done, Dick Hickock’s father, addressing a journalist seated near him, said, “The judge up there! I never seen a man so prejudiced. Just no sense having a trial. Not with him in charge. Why, that man was a pallbearer at the funeral!” (Actually, Tate had been but slightly acquainted with the victims, and had not been present at their funeral in any capacity.) Mr. Hickock’s was the only voice heard in an exceedingly silent courtroom. Altogether, there were seventeen prints, and as they were passed from hand to hand, the jurors’ expressions reflected the impact that the pictures made: one man’s cheeks reddened as if he had been slapped, and a few, after the first distressing glance, obviously had no heart for the task, for it was as though the photographs had prized open their mind’s eye, and forced them at last really to see the true and pitiful thing that had happened to a neighbor, his wife, and his children. It amazed them, it made them angry, and several of them—the pharmacist, the manager of the bowling alley—stared at the defendants with total contempt. The elder Mr. Hickock, wearily wagging his head, murmured again and again, “No sense. Just no sense having a trial.”\n\nThe prosecution had promised to produce as the day’s final witness a “mystery man.” It was the man who had supplied the information that led to the arrest of the accused—Floyd Wells, Dick Hickock’s former cellmate. Because Wells was still serving a sentence at Kansas State Penitentiary, and was therefore in danger of retaliation from other inmates, he had not previously been publicly identified as the informer. Now, in order that he might safely testify at the trial, he had been removed from the prison and lodged in a small jail in an adjacent county. Nevertheless, his passage across the courtroom toward the witness stand was oddly stealthy—as though he expected to encounter an assassin along the way—and when he walked past Dick, Dick’s lips moved as he whispered a few atrocious words. Wells pretended not to notice, but, like a horse that has heard the hum of a rattlesnake, he shied away from the betrayed man’s venomous vicinity. Taking the stand, Wells stared straight ahead—a somewhat chinless little farm-boyish fellow wearing a decent dark-blue suit, which the State of Kansas had bought for the occasion, the state being concerned that its most important witness should look respectable, and consequently trustworthy. His testimony, perfected by pre-trial rehearsal, was as tidy as his appearance. Encouraged by sympathetic prompting from the special assistant prosecuting attorney, Logan Green, the witness acknowledged that he had once, for approximately a year, worked as a hired hand at River Valley Farm; he went on to say that some ten years later, following his conviction on a burglary charge, he had become friendly with another imprisoned burglar, Richard Hickock, and had described to him the Clutter farm and family.\n\n“Now,” Green asked, “during your conversations with Mr. Hickock, what was said about Mr. Clutter by either of you?”\n\n“Well, we talked quite a bit about Mr. Clutter,” Wells said. “Hickock said he was about to be paroled, and he was going to go West looking for a job; he might stop to see Mr. Clutter to get a job. I was telling him how wealthy Mr. Clutter was.”\n\n“Did that seem to interest Mr. Hickock?”\n\n“Well, he wanted to know if Mr. Clutter had a safe around there.”\n\n“Mr. Wells, did you think at the time there was a safe in the Clutter house?”\n\n“Well, it has been so long since I worked out there. I thought there was a safe. I knew there was a cabinet of some kind. The next thing I knew, he [Hickock] was talking about robbing Mr. Clutter.”\n\n“Did he tell you anything about how he was going to commit the robbery?”\n\n“He told me if he done anything like that he wouldn’t leave no witnesses.”\n\n“Did he actually say what he was going to do with the witnesses?”\n\n“Yes. He told me he would probably tie them up and then rob them and then kill them.”\n\nHaving established premeditation in great degree, Green left the witness to the ministrations of the defense. Old Mr. Fleming, a classic country lawyer, more happily at home with land deeds than with crimes of violence, opened the cross-examination. The intent of his queries, as he soon established, was to introduce a subject that the prosecution had conspicuously avoided—the question of Wells’ own role in the murder plot, and his own moral liability.\n\nHastening to the heart of the matter, Fleming said, “You didn’t say anything at all to Mr. Hickock to discourage him from coming out here to rob and kill the Clutter family?”\n\n“No. Anybody tells you anything about that up there [Kansas State Penitentiary], you don’t pay any attention to it, because you think they are just talking anyway.”\n\n“You mean you talked that way and didn’t mean anything? Didn’t you mean to convey to him [Hickock] the idea that Mr. Clutter had a safe? You wanted Mr. Hickock to believe that, did you not?”\n\nIn his quiet way, Fleming was giving the witness a rough time. Wells plucked at his tie, as though the knot were suddenly too tight.\n\n“And you meant for Mr. Hickock to believe that Mr. Clutter had a lot of money, didn’t you?”\n\n“I told him Mr. Clutter had a lot of money, yes.”\n\nFleming elicited a repetition of the account of how Hickock had fully informed Wells of his violent plans for the Clutter family. Then, as though veiled in a private grief, the lawyer very wistfully said, “And even after all of that you did nothing to discourage him?”\n\n“I didn’t believe he’d do it.”\n\n“You didn’t believe him. Then why, when you heard about the thing that happened out here, why did you think he was the one that was guilty?”\n\nWells cockily replied, “Because it was done just like he said he was going to do!”\n\nHarrison Smith, the younger half of the defense team, took charge. Assuming an aggressive, sneering manner, which seemed forced—really he is a mild and lenient man—the lawyer asked the witness if he had a nickname.\n\n“No. I just go by Floyd.”\n\nThe lawyer snorted. “Don’t they call you Squealer now? Or do they call you Snitch?”\n\n“I just go by Floyd,” Wells repeated, rather hangdog.\n\n“How many times have you been in jail?”\n\n“About three times.”\n\n“Some of those times for lying, were they?”\n\nDenying this, the witness said that once he had gone to jail for driving without a license, that the reason for his second incarceration was burglary, and that the third, a ninety-day hitch in an Army stockade, had been the outcome of something that happened while he was a soldier: “We was on a train-trip guard. We got a little intoxicated on the train, done a little extra shooting at some windows and lights.”\n\nEveryone laughed—everyone except the defendants (Hickock spat on the floor) and Harrison Smith, who now asked Wells why, after learning of the Holcomb tragedy, he had tarried several weeks before telling the authorities what he knew. “Weren’t you waiting for something to come out? Maybe like a reward?” he pursued.\n\n“No.”\n\n“You didn’t hear anything about a reward?” The lawyer was referring to a reward of a thousand dollars that had been offered by a Kansas paper, the Hutchinson News, for information that would result in the arrest and conviction of the Clutter murderers.\n\n“I seen it in the paper.”\n\n“That was before you went to the authorities, wasn’t it?”\n\nAnd when the witness admitted that this was true, Harrison Smith triumphantly continued by asking, “What kind of immunity did the County Attorney offer you for coming up here today and testifying?”\n\nLogan Green protested. “We object to the form of the question, Your Honor. There’s been no testimony about immunity to anybody.”\n\nThe objection was sustained, and the witness was dismissed. As he left the stand, Hickock announced to everyone within earshot, “Son of a bitch. Anybody ought to hang, he ought to hang. Look at him. Gonna walk out of here and get that money and go scot-free.” This prediction proved correct, for not long afterward Floyd Wells collected both the reward and a parole. His good fortune was short-lived, however. He was soon in trouble again, and, over the years, has experienced many vicissitudes. At present, he is an inmate of the Mississippi State Prison, in Parchman, Mississippi, where he is serving a thirty-year sentence for armed robbery.\n\nBy Friday, when the court recessed for the weekend, the state had completed its case, which encompassed the appearance of four Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in Washington, D.C. These men, laboratory technicians who were skilled in various categories of scientific crime detection, had studied the physical evidence connecting the accused to the murders—blood samples, footprints, cartridge shells, rope, and tape—and each of them certified the undoubted validity of the exhibits. Finally, four K.B.I. agents provided accounts of interviews with the prisoners and of the confessions that the prisoners eventually made. In cross-examining the K.B.I. personnel, the defense attorneys, a beleaguered pair, argued that the admissions of guilt had been obtained by improper means—brutal interrogation in sweltering, brightly lighted, closetlike rooms. The allegation, which was untrue, irritated the detectives into expounding very convincing denials. And later Hickock’s lawyer, in reply to a reporter who asked him why he had dogged this misleading scent at such length, said, “What am I supposed to do? Hell, I’m playing without any cards. But I can’t just sit here like a dummy. I’ve got to sound off once in a while.”\n\nThe prosecution’s most damaging witness proved to be Alvin Dewey. His testimony, the first public rendering of the events detailed in Perry Smith’s confession, earned large headlines (“UNVEIL MUTE MURDER HORROR—COLD, CHILLING FACTS TOLD”), and shocked his listeners, none more than Richard Hickock, who came to a startled and chagrined attention when Dewey said in the course of his commentary, “There is one incident Smith related to me that I haven’t as yet mentioned. And that was that after the Clutter family was tied up, Hickock said to him how well built he thought Nancy Clutter was, and that he was going to rape her. Smith said he told Hickock there wasn’t going to be anything like that go on. Smith told me he had no respect for anyone who couldn’t control their sexual desires, and that he would have fought Hickock before allowing him to rape the Clutter girl.” Theretofore, Hickock had not known that his partner had informed the police of the proposed assault, nor was he yet aware that, in a friendlier spirit, Perry had altered his original story to claim that he alone had shot the four victims. This fact was revealed by Dewey as he neared the end of his testimony: “Perry Smith told me he wished to change two things in the statement he had given us. He said everything else in that statement was true and correct. Except these two things. And that was that he wanted to say he killed Mrs. Clutter and Nancy Clutter—not Hickock. He told me that Hickock . . . didn’t want to die with his mother thinking he had killed any members of the Clutter family. And he said the Hickocks were good people. So why not have it that way.”\n\nHearing this, Mrs. Hickock wept. Throughout the trial, she had sat quietly beside her husband, her hands worrying a handkerchief. As often as she could, she caught her son’s eye, nodded at him, and simulated a smile—an expression that, though flimsily constructed, affirmed her loyalty. Now her control was clearly exhausted. A few spectators glanced at her, and glanced away, embarrassed; the rest seemed oblivious of the raw dirge counterpointing Dewey’s continuing recital. Even her husband, perhaps because he believed it unmanly to take notice, remained aloof. At last, a woman reporter—the only one present—led her out of the courtroom and into the privacy of a ladies’ room.\n\nOnce Mrs. Hickock’s anguish had subsided, she expressed a need to confide. “There’s nobody much I can talk to,” she told her companion. “I don’t mean people haven’t been kind—neighbors, and all. And strangers, too—strangers have wrote letters to say they know how hard it must be and how sorry they are. Nobody’s said a mean word, either to Walter or to me. Not even here, where you might expect it. Everybody here has gone out of their way to be friendly. The waitress over at the place where we take our meals, she puts ice cream on the pie and don’t charge for it. I tell her don’t, I can’t eat it. Used to be I could eat anything didn’t eat me first. But she puts it on. To be nice. Sheila, that’s her, she says it’s not our fault what happened. But it seems to me like people are looking at me and thinking, Well, she must be to blame somehow. The way I raised Dick. Maybe I did do something wrong. Only I don’t know what it could have been; I get headaches trying to remember. We’re plain people, just country people, getting along the same as everybody else. We had some good times at our house. I taught Dick the fox trot. Dancing, I was always crazy about it, it was my whole life when I was a girl, and there was a boy, gosh, he could dance like Christmas—we won a silver cup waltzing together. For a long time, we planned to run away and go on the stage. Vaudeville. It was just a dream. Children dreaming. He left town, and one day I married Walter, and Walter Hickock couldn’t do Step One. He said if I wanted a hoofer I should’ve married a horse. Nobody ever danced with me again until I learned Dick, and he didn’t take to it exactly, but he was sweet. Dick was the best-natured little kid.” She removed the spectacles she was wearing, polished the smeared lenses, and resettled them on her pudgy, agreeable face. “There’s lots more to Dick than what you hear back there in the courtroom. The lawyers jabbering how terrible he is—no good at all. I can’t make any excuses for what he did. His part in it. I’m not forgetting that family; I pray for them every night. But I pray for Dick, too. And this boy Perry. It was wrong of me to hate him; I’ve got nothing but pity for him now. And you know—I believe Mrs. Clutter would feel pity, too. Being the kind of woman they say she was.”\n\nCourt had adjourned. The noises of the departing audience clattered in the corridor beyond the lavatory door. Mrs. Hickock said she must go and meet her husband. “He’s dying,” she said. “I don’t think he minds anymore.”\n\nMany observers of the trial scene were baffled by the visitor from Boston, Donald Cullivan. They could not quite understand why this staid young Catholic, a successful engineer who had taken his degree at Harvard, a husband and the father of three children, should choose to befriend an uneducated, homicidal half-breed whom he knew but slightly and had not seen in nine years. Cullivan himself said, “My wife doesn’t understand it, either. Coming out here was something I couldn’t afford to do—it meant using a week of my vacation, and money we really need for other things. On the other hand, it was something I couldn’t afford not to do. Perry’s lawyer wrote me asking if I would be a character witness. The moment I read the letter, I knew I had to do it. Because I’d offered this man my friendship. And because—well, I believe in the life everlasting. All souls can be saved for God.”\n\nThe salvation of a soul—namely, Perry Smith’s—was an enterprise in which the deeply Catholic under-sheriff and his wife were eager to assist, even though Mrs. Meier had been rebuffed by Perry when she herself suggested a consultation with Father Goubeax, a local priest. (Perry had said, “Priests and nuns have had their chance with me. I’m still wearing the scars to prove it.”) And so, during the weekend recess, the Meiers invited Cullivan to eat Sunday dinner with the prisoner in his cell.\n\nThe opportunity to entertain his friend—to play host, as it were—delighted Perry. He planned the menu—wild goose, stuffed and roasted, with gravy and creamed potatoes and string-beans, aspic salad, hot biscuits, cold milk, freshly baked cherry tarts, cheese, and coffee. The dinner seemed to concern him more than the outcome of the trial (which, to be sure, he did not consider a suspenseful matter, saying, “Those prairiebillies, they’ll vote to hang fast as pigs eat slop. Look at their eyes. I’ll be damned if I’m the only killer in the courtroom”). All Sunday morning, he made his preparations for receiving his guest. The day was warm and a little windy, and leaf shadows, supple emanations from the tree boughs that brushed the barred window of the cell, tantalized Big Red, Perry’s tamed squirrel. Big Red chased the swaying patterns while his master swept and dusted, scrubbed the floor and scoured the toilet, and cleared the desk of literary accumulations. The desk was to be the dining table, and once Perry had finished setting it, it looked most inviting, for Mrs. Meier had donated a linen tablecloth, starched napkins, and her best china and silver.\n\nCullivan was impressed—he whistled when the feast, arriving on trays, was placed upon the table—and before sitting down he asked the host if he might offer a blessing. The host, head unbowed, cracked his knuckles as Cullivan, with head bowed and palms together, intoned, “Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through the mercy of Christ, our Lord. Amen.”\n\nThen Perry remarked that in his opinion any credit due belonged to Mrs. Meier. “She did all the work,” he said. Heaping his guest’s plate, he went on, “Well, it’s good to see you, Don. You look just the same. Haven’t changed a bit.”\n\nCullivan, in appearance a cautious bank clerk with depleted hair and a face rather difficult to recall, agreed that outwardly he hadn’t changed much. But his interior self, the invisible man, was another matter, he continued. “I was coasting along,” he said. “Not knowing God is the only reality. Once you realize that, then everything falls into place. Life has meaning—and so does death. Boy, do you always eat like this?”\n\nPerry laughed. “She’s really a terrific cook—Mrs. Meier. You ought to taste her Spanish rice. I’ve gained fifteen pounds since I got here. Course, I was on the thin side. I’d lost a lot of weight while Dick and me were out on the road riding all to hell and gone—hardly ever eating a square meal, hungry as hell most of the time. Mostly, we lived like animals. Dick was always stealing canned stuff out of grocery stores. Baked beans and canned spaghetti. We’d open it up in the car and gobble it cold. Animals. Dick loves to steal. It’s an emotional thing with him. A sickness. I’m a thief, too, but only if I don’t have the money to pay. Dick—if he was carrying a hundred dollars in his pocket, he’d steal a stick of chewing gum.”\n\nLater, over coffee and cigarettes, Perry returned to the subject of thievery. “My friend Willie-Jay used to talk about it,” he said, referring to a onetime fellow-prisoner of his, a chaplain’s clerk. “He used to say that all crimes were only ‘varieties of theft.’ Murder included. When you kill a man you steal his life. I guess that makes me a pretty big thief. See, Don—I did kill them. Down there in court, old Dewey made it sound like I was prevaricating. On account of Dick’s mother. Well, I wasn’t. Dick helped me—he held the flashlight and picked up the shells. And it was his idea, too. But Dick didn’t shoot them, he never could’ve—though he’s damn quick when it comes to running down an old dog. I wonder why I did it.” He scowled, as though the problem were new to him—a newly unearthed stone, of a surprising, unclassified color. “I don’t know why,” he said, as if he were holding it to the light and angling it now here, now there. “I was sore at Dick. The tough guy. The phony brass boy. But it wasn’t Dick. Or the fear of being identified. I was willing to take that gamble. And it wasn’t because of anything the Clutters did. They never hurt me. Like other people. Like people have all my life. Maybe it’s just that the Clutters were the ones who had to pay for it.”\n\nCullivan probed, trying to gauge the depth of what he assumed would be Perry’s contrition. Surely he must be experiencing a remorse sufficiently profound to summon a desire for God’s mercy and forgiveness?\n\nPerry said, “Am I sorry? If that’s what you mean, I’m not. I don’t feel anything about it. I wish I did. But nothing about it bothers me a bit. Half an hour after it happened, Dick was making jokes and I was laughing at them. Maybe we’re not human. I’m human enough to feel sorry for myself. Sorry I can’t walk out of here when you walk out. But that’s all.”\n\nCullivan could scarcely credit so detached an attitude: Perry was confused, mistaken; it was not possible for any man to be so devoid of conscience or compassion.\n\nPerry said, “Why? Soldiers don’t lose much sleep. They murder, and get medals for doing it. The good people of Kansas want to murder me, and some hangman will be glad to get the work. It’s easy to kill. A lot easier than passing a bad check. Just remember: I only knew the Clutters maybe an hour. If I’d really known them, I guess I’d feel different. I don’t think I could live with myself. But the way it was, it was like picking off targets in a shooting gallery.”\n\nCullivan was silent, and his silence upset Perry, who seemed to interpret it as implying disapproval. “Hell, Don, don’t make me act the hypocrite with you: throw a load of bull—how sorry I am, how all I want to do now is crawl on my knees and pray,” he said. “That stuff don’t ring with me. I can’t accept overnight what I’ve always denied. The truth is, you’ve done more for me than any what you call God ever has. Or ever will. By writing to me. By signing yourself ‘friend.’ When I had no friends. Except Joe James.” Joe James, he explained, was a young Indian logger with whom he had once lived in a forest near Bellingham, Washington. “That’s a long way from Garden City. A good two thousand miles. But I sent word to Joe. About the trouble I’m in. Joe’s a poor guy, he’s got seven kids to feed. But he promised to come here, if he had to walk. He hasn’t shown up yet, and maybe he won’t, only I think he will. Joe always liked me. Do you, Don?”\n\n“Yes. I like you.”\n\nCullivan’s softly emphatic answer pleased but rather flustered Perry. He smiled, and said, “Then you must be some kind of nut.” Suddenly rising, he crossed the cell and picked up the broom. “I don’t know why I should die among strangers. Let a bunch of prairiebillies stand around and watch me strangle. I ought to kill myself first.” He lifted the broom and pressed the bristles against the light bulb that burned in the ceiling. “Just unscrew the bulb and smash it and cut my wrists. That’s what I ought to do. While you’re still here. Somebody who cares about me a little bit.”\n\nThe trial resumed on Monday morning at ten o’clock. Ninety minutes later, the court adjourned, the case for the defense having been completed in that brief time. The defendants, who had pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, declined to testify in their own behalf. Therefore, the question of whether Hickock or Smith had been the actual executioner of the Clutter family did not arise.\n\nOf the five witnesses who did appear that morning, the first was the hollow-eyed Mr. Hickock. Though he spoke with a dignified and mournful clarity, he had but one contribution to make that was relevant to a claim of temporary insanity. His son, he said, had suffered head injuries in a car accident in July, 1950. Prior to the accident, Dick had been a “happy-go-lucky boy.” He had done well in school, and been popular with his classmates and considerate of his parents—“no trouble to anybody.”\n\nHarrison Smith, gently guiding the witness, said, “I will ask you if, after July, 1950, you observed any change in the personality and the habits and the actions of your son, Richard?”\n\n“He just didn’t act like the same boy.”\n\n“What were the changes you observed?”\n\nMr. Hickock, between pensive hesitations, listed several: Dick was sulky and restless, he ran around with older men, he drank and gambled. “He just wasn’t the same boy.”\n\nThe last assertion was immediately challenged by Logan Green, who undertook the cross-examination. “Mr. Hickock, you say you never had any trouble with your son until after 1950?”\n\n“I think he got arrested in 1949.”\n\nGreen smiled, and asked, “Remember what he was arrested for?”\n\n“He was accused of breaking into a drugstore.”\n\n“Accused? Didn’t he admit that he broke into the store?”\n\n“That’s right, he did.”\n\n“And that was in 1949. Yet now you tell us your son had a change in his attitude and conduct after 1950?”\n\n“I would say so, yes.”\n\n“You mean that after 1950 he became a good boy?”\n\nHard coughs agitated the old man. “No,” he said, “I wouldn’t say that.”\n\n“Then what was the change that took place?”\n\n“Well, that would be pretty hard to explain. He just didn’t act like the same boy.”\n\n“You mean he lost his criminal tendencies?”\n\nThe lawyer’s sally induced guffaws—a courtroom flareup that Judge Tate’s dour gaze soon extinguished.\n\nMr. Hickock, presently set free, was replaced on the stand by Dr. W. Mitchell Jones. Dr. Jones identified himself to the court as a “physician specializing in the field of psychiatry,” and, in support of his qualifications, added that he had attended perhaps fifteen hundred patients since 1956, the year he entered a psychiatric residency at Topeka State Hospital. For the past two years, he had served on the staff of Larned State Hospital, where he was in charge of the Dillon Building, a section reserved for the criminally insane.\n\nHarrison Smith asked the witness, “Approximately how many murderers have you dealt with?”\n\n“About twenty-five.”\n\n“Doctor, I would like to ask you if you know my client, Richard Eugene Hickock?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Have you had occasion to examine him professionally?”\n\n“Yes, sir. I made a psychiatric evaluation of Mr. Hickock.”\n\n“Based upon your examination, do you have an opinion as to whether or not Richard Eugene Hickock knew right from wrong at the time of the commission of the crime?”\n\nThe witness, a stout man of twenty-eight with a moon-shaped but intelligent, subtly delicate face, took a deep breath, as though to equip himself for a prolonged reply—which the judge then cautioned him he must not make: “You may answer the question yes or no, Doctor. Limit your answer to yes or no.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And what is your opinion?”\n\n“I think that within the usual definitions Mr. Hickock did know right from wrong.”\n\nConfined as he was by the M’Naghten Rule (“the usual definitions”), a formula quite color-blind to any gradations between black and white, Dr. Jones was impotent to answer otherwise. But, of course, the response was a letdown for Hickock’s attorney, who hopelessly asked, “Can you qualify that answer?”\n\nIt was hopeless because, though Dr. Jones agreed to elaborate, the prosecution was entitled to object, and did, citing the fact that Kansas law required nothing more than a yes-or-no reply to the pertinent question. The objection was upheld, and the witness was dismissed.\n\nHowever, had Dr. Jones been allowed to testify further, here is what he had written out and would have said: “Richard Hickock is above average in intelligence, grasps new ideas easily, and has a wide fund of information. He is alert to what is happening around him, and he shows no sign of mental confusion or disorientation. His thinking is well organized and logical, and he seems to be in good contact with reality. Although I did not find the usual signs of organic brain damage—memory loss, concrete-concept formation, intellectual deterioration—this cannot be completely ruled out. He had a serious head injury with concussion and several hours of unconsciousness in 1950—this was verified by me by checking hospital records. He says he has had blackout spells, periods of amnesia, and headaches ever since that time, and a major portion of his anti-social behavior has occurred since that time. He has never had the medical tests which would definitely prove or disprove the existence of residual brain damage. Definitive medical tests are indicated before a complete evaluation can be said to exist. Hickock does show signs of emotional abnormality. That he knew what he was doing and still went ahead with it is possibly the most clear-cut demonstration of this fact. He is a person who is impulsive in action, likely to do things without thought of consequences or future discomfort to himself or to others. He does not seem to be capable of learning from experience, and he shows an unusual pattern of intermittent periods of productive activity followed by patently irresponsible actions. He cannot tolerate feelings of frustration as a more normal person can, and he is poorly able to rid himself of those feelings except through anti-social activity. His self-esteem is very low, and he secretly feels inferior to others and sexually inadequate. These feelings seem to be overcompensated for by dreams of being rich and powerful, a tendency to brag about his exploits, spending sprees when he has money, and dissatisfaction with only the normal slow advancement he could expect from his job. He is uncomfortable in his relationships to other people, and has a pathological inability to form and hold enduring personal attachments. Although he professes usual moral standards, he seems obviously uninfluenced by them in his actions. In summary, he shows fairly typical characteristics of what would psychiatrically be called a severe character disorder. It is important that steps be taken to rule out the possibility of organic brain damage, since, if present, it might have substantially influenced his behavior during the past several years and at the time of the crime.”\n\nAside from a formal plea to the jury, which would not take place until the next day, the psychiatrist’s testimony terminated Dick Hickock’s planned defense. It was now the turn of Arthur Fleming, Perry Smith’s elderly counsellor. He presented four witnesses: the Reverend James E. Post, the Protestant chaplain at Kansas State Penitentiary; Perry’s Indian friend Joe James, who, after all, had arrived by bus that morning, having travelled a day and two nights from his wilderness home in the Far Northwest; Donald Cullivan; and, once again, Dr. Jones. Except for the last, these men were offered as “character witnesses”—persons expected to attribute to the accused a few human virtues. They did not fare very well, though each of them managed some skimpily favorable remark before the protesting prosecution, which contended that personal comments of this nature were “incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial,” hushed and banished them.\n\nFor example, Joe James, a dark-haired man, even darker-skinned than Perry, and a lithe figure who looked, with his huntsman’s faded shirt and moccasined feet, as though he had that instant mysteriously emerged from woodland shadows, told the court that the defendant had lived with him off and on for over two years. “Perry was a likable kid, well liked around the neighborhood—he never done one thing out of the way to my knowledge,” he said.\n\nThe state stopped him there, and it halted Cullivan, too, when Cullivan said, “During the time I knew him in the Army, Perry was a very likable fellow.”\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Post survived somewhat longer, for he made no direct attempt to compliment the prisoner but described sympathetically an encounter with him at Lansing: “I first met Perry Smith when he came to my office in the prison chapel with a picture he had painted. A head-and-shoulders portrait of Jesus Christ done in pastel crayon. He wanted to give it to me for use in the chapel. It’s been hanging on the walls of my office ever since.”\n\nFleming asked, “Do you have a photograph of that painting?”\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Post had an envelope full of photographs, but when he produced them, ostensibly for distribution among the jurors, an exasperated Logan Green leaped to his feet and said, “If Your Honor please, this is going too far!”\n\nHis Honor saw that it went no further.\n\nDr. Jones was now recalled, and, following a repetition of the preliminaries that had accompanied his original appearance, Fleming put to him the crucial query: “From your conversations and examination of Perry Edward Smith, do you have an opinion as to whether he knew right from wrong at the time of the offense involved in this action?”\n\nAnd once more the court admonished the witness: “Answer yes or no, do you have an opinion.”\n\n“No.”\n\nAmid surprised mutters, Fleming, surprised himself, said, “You may state to the jury why you have no opinion.”\n\nGreen objected, “The man has no opinion, and that’s it.”\n\nWhich it was, legally speaking.\n\nBut had Dr. Jones been permitted to discourse on the cause of his indecision, he would have said, “Perry Smith shows definite signs of severe mental illness. His childhood, related to me and verified by portions of the prison records, was marked by brutality and lack of concern on the part of both parents. He seems to have grown up without direction, without love, and without ever having absorbed any fixed sense of moral values. He is oriented, hyper-alert to things going on about him, and shows no sign of confusion. He is above average in intelligence, and has a good range of information, considering his poor educational background. Two features in his personality makeup stand out as particularly pathological. The first is his ‘paranoid’ orientation toward the world. He is suspicious and distrustful of others, tends to feel that others discriminate against him, and feels that others are unfair to him and do not understand him. He is overly sensitive to criticisms that others make of him, and cannot tolerate being made fun of. He is quick to sense slight or insult in things others say, and frequently may misinterpret well-meant communications. He feels he has great need of friendship and understanding, but he is reluctant to confide in oth"
