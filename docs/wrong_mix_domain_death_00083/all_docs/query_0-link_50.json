I have some information--a story really--on David Dale Condit 6817 431 birthplace and his father Daniel Dale Condit 6817 43.\n\nDavid Dale Condit [6817 431] was born in India, where his father D. Dale Condit [6817 43] was working as a petroleum geologist for S. Pearson & Sons Ltd, an English company exploring for oil. In 1920, David's father [6817 43] and colleague Ralph W. Howell were attacked by tribal men while exploring for oil in the Baluchistan-Punjab region of British India. David's father, Daniel Dale [6817 43], escaped with injuries while the colleague was killed in India. Daniel Dale [6817 43] met his future wife, the sister of Ralph , at Ralph's funeral in Washington, DC, in 1920. They married in 1922 and she accompanied him back to India. David Dale's [6817 431] brother Ralph Howell Condit [6817 432] was named after his mother's brother and father's colleague who was killed in India.\n\nSources: NYTimes November 1920; journal \"Science\" Vol 50 No 1300, p. 499\n\n--\n\n/Melanie McCalmont, M.Sci.\n\nRochester, NY\n\n608-535-0351\n\nAuthor “A Wilderness of Rocks”\n\n8602. “California Death Index, 1940-1997 for Ione Clara (Condit) Dickerson,” Ancestry.com, Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2000.

Andrea Hutchinson, dre5085@yahoo.com, “Thank Godâ¦I have Condit info and need Condit infoâ¦ & Re: Zebulon Wallace Condit Family,” 6/4/2010-6/6/2010, Email files of David Condit.\n\n6/4/2010\n\nI have some Info on the Condit Family line and thanks to you I have a couple key pieces of info that I was missing. Angaline Condit was my husbands great grandmother. Her 2nd daughter Merton Merle Condit Hutchison wasn't born until 1902 so she doesn't show up on the 1900 census. Mertie as she was called was my husband grandmother. I have pictures of Angaline, Wallace, Orlando, John, Delpha, along with some of Orlando's children. I am still trying to piece together this particular section of the family and your website is the first I've seen that even mentions these folks. If you know of anyone who might be a decendent of Orlando's I would love to contact them. I attached Orlando's death cert. I hope you can read it. If there is anything else you want to know please feel free to ask. Thank you so much for your website. I wish more people did this\n\n6/6/2010\n\nIt sure is great to find a connection finally. They are hard to figure out. I have all information on Mertie and some pictures of the family as well.\n\nMerton Merle Condit married James Robert Hutchison June 9, 1919. They had 11 children, however the two youngest didn't make it. They were named but little else is known. Her children were Evelyn Ester, Dorothy Louise, Lu Lu May , James Robert Jr., Homer Lee, George Walter , Fern Eve, Lester Lee, Warren Basil , Franklin Theodore, and Ida Belle.\n\nLester Lee married Margie Cecilia Summers February 17, 1956. They had 6 children. The oldest James Robert Hutchison died from Sids, however, everyone else is doing well. After James was David Lee, Alan Leonard, Loy Edwin, Christine Ann , and Peter Andrew.\n\nI am married to Loy Edwin Hutchison . He has 2 children from his first marriage to Wendy Gayle Hendrickson on July 16, 1988. They are Brooke Nicole and James Robert. We have no children together.\n\nAs far as we know John Condit had no children, and Delpha died young, in her teens is what I have been told. No one even knew about Clyde.\n\nI have attached some pictures of the Family. We really have scant information on them. The ones in the know have all died. The ones remaining don't seem to remember much. I know that Angaline's maiden name was Cooper. She claimed to have a half--brother by the name of Eska Joyner but she would not talk about her mother or father so we are having a hard time tracing that line as well.\n\nBasically, any other information we have is from word of mouth. Please feel free to ask any other questions you may have. I was wondering if you had any documents like birth and death certificates on Z. Wallace or any of their kids? Again, thanks so much for all your work!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrea Hutchison\n\n8616.
