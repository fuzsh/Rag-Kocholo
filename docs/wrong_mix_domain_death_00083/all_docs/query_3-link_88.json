        "text": "OJ Simpson’s health took a turn for the worse a week and a half before he died from cancer, forcing him to cancel a pre-scheduled event, according to an old friend of the controversial ex-NFL player.\n\nBruce Fromong told People Saturday that Simpson was hired to do a signing for the PSA-JSA memorabilia company owner but had to bail on the commitment because of his condition.\n\nThe retired NFL star reportedly held out hope that he would get better soon but was still not ready to take a rain check on the signing.\n\n“Nah … just give me a little bit of time,” Simpson allegedly told Fromong when asked to reschedule their plans. “Let me get to feeling better.”\n\n“That meant he was really not feeling well,” the memorabilia dealer added before pointing out that he initially thought the former athlete was simply battling something minor like “a cold or flu.”\n\n“We thought he was getting better, and he was not,” the longtime pal added.\n\nFromong said Simpson’s appearance was also deceiving because he “looked fine” when he saw him at the Aliante Golf Club a few months ago.\n\nIn February, the father of five also seemed lively and in good spirits during an outing in Las Vegas, where he reportedly ditched his cane to walk around Sin City.\n\nHowever, when Fromong reached out to Simpson one last time on Tuesday with a text that read, “Hey old buddy, hope you get to feeling better, and we’ll talk soon,” he did not get a response back.\n\nSimpson died a day later at age 76 from prostate cancer. His family said in a statement on Thursday, “On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer.\n\n“He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren. During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nSimpson’s death drew mixed reactions — including a scathing message from Caitlyn Jenner — given his role in the scandalous trial surrounding the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson.\n\nFromong, for his part, was sympathetic to the loss — even though he had his own complicated relationship with OJ.\n\nThe “If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer” author once robbed the memorabilia dealer in a Las Vegas hotel room back in 2007, and had to serve nine years in prison for his crimes.\n\nHowever, Fromong previously advocated for OJ’s early release and told People Saturday that he will “absolutely” miss his old pal.\n\n“It’s the end of a long friendship,” he told the outlet. “I will always be a friend that will think about him.”"
