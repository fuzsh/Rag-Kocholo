It was formed in the year 295, during the tetrarchy reform of Roman emperor Diocletian, and assigned to the civil diocese of Pannonia, which was attached in the fourth century to the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, and later to the Praetorian prefecture of Italy.

During the 4th and 5th century, the province was raided several times, by migrating peoples, including Huns and Goths. In 490s, it became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom.
