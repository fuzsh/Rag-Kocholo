        "text": "How did a small Bronze Age settlement, founded at the end of the second millennium BC and later recorded in ancient written sources as Segestica and Siscia, transform into one of the most important Iron Age centers in the Sava and Drava River interfluve? The Segestica and Siscia – a settlement from the beginning of history exhibition and catalogue try to provide an answer to this question. They present the founding, development, and the cultural dynamics of this exceptional settlement, the everyday lives of its inhabitants, their attire and warrior equipment, their diet, their economic and trading activities, and their spiritual life. Finds that are kept in the collections of the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, the Sisak Municipal Museum, and the Hungarian National Museum (Magyar Nemzeti Múzeum), accompanied by the results of contemporary archaeological research, have allowed the study of the continual development of the prehistoric settlement in Sisak throughout the first millennium BC, up until 35 BC, when this settlement, situated at the key strategic position for taking over Pannonia, was conquered by Roman legions led by Octavian, the future emperor Augustus. That is when the settlement became an important military stronghold that later developed into the famous Roman city of Siscia.\n\nOne of the fundamental events in the formation of the medieval European continent was the transition to more complex organisational structures, even for the inhabitants of the territories beyond the Roman limes. The historical-social transformation movement of the western European world and the new multiethnic composition of the new Roman-Germanic societies were only two of the consequences of the collapse of the division between the highly-developed Mediterranean world and the areas not directly controlled by Rome where, however, stable socioeconomic organisational forms had still developed, involving both the steppe and the Germanic populations. Even if it never was an insuperable boundary for all those who lived in the areas not under Roman control , the limes forever lost that ideological concept of barrier and border between two diverse and opposing worlds. The mechanism that caused such consequences involved very complex processes that, as they occurred, affected the environmental geographic conditions as well as the local traditions and ethnic affinities. The populations that continued to live in the areas beyond the Pannonian border introduced themselves into the stream of cultural transformations that arose in that part of the post-Roman European territories between Late Antiquity and the early medieval centuries. It would still be several centuries before this change would complete its natural cycle. In the end, the tribal societies disappeared and new social and cultural structures arose. This helped to spread new ways of using nature, new standards for social coexistence and a new vision of the world. 1. THE BALKAN AREAS AS THE CROSSROADS OF CULTURES In 364, following Jovian's death in Ancyra, the commanders of the regiments and other high-ranking imperial officials chose Valentinian, a Pannonian officer and a Christian, to succeed him as emperor; in turn, Valenti-nian personally proclaimed his brother Valens Augustus on 28 March of that year. 1 The end of the Constantine dynasty led to a return to the system of the 'military monarchy' of the third century and, as was the case under the Tetrarchy, to the division of East and West into two areas, assigning the pars ori-entis to Valens and the pars occidentis to Valentinian. Given that they had to deal with the problem of defending the imperial boundaries, the emperors lived more and more frequently at their residences near the borders – Treviri, Antioch and Constantinople – rather than Rome. 2 In the western areas, Valentinian had to deal with constant raids by the Alamanni in Gaul, the Picts and the Scots in Britannia, and the Sarmatians and the Quadi along the Danube. Valentinian died in Pannonia in 375 and was immediately succeeded by his son Gratian and half-brother Valentinian II, although the latter was appointed upon the advice of the magister militum per Illyricum, the Frank Merobaud, solely to garner the loyalty of the imperial regiments. 3\n\nThe founding works of A.H.M. Jones, C. Lepelley and J.H.W.G. Liebeschuetz on cities in Late Antiquity have shown that their so-called decline and fall, defended by Fustel de Coulanges, were rather corresponding to profound changes in terms of topography, forms and functions, than to an actual disappearance. It is undeniable that the Roman classical model one day ceased to be, but it was not by leaving room for nothingness. There was indeed a lively world of Late Antique and Early Medieval cities. The last centuries of Antiquity even saw the foundation of new cities, some of them having never been anything but Christian cities. Given the magnitude of the impact of the great invasions/migrations in this region, the three dioceses of Illyricum, Dacia and Thrace were among those, in the Late Roman World, which saw their civic system most shaken by wars and population movements between the third and the eighth centuries. This session proposes to re-evaluate and to illustrate this historical issue in the light of archaeological discoveries of an overlooked region, especially with regard to the spread of Christinianity, by taking a look at the provinces that covered, in Late Roman times, the northern part of the Balkans.\n\nAbstract The site of Caričin Grad in south-eastern Serbia – currently listed on UNESCO’s tentative list – has been the subject of archaeological investigations for more than 100 years. For the last decades it has been the focus of a joint project of the Archaeological Institute in Belgrade and the École Française de Rome. A reconstruction of the economic, environmental and social history of the city is the main objective of a cooperative project started in 2014 with the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz. The remains of the early Byzantine complex of Caričin Grad show the features of a city built in the classical, Hellenistic-Roman tradition, combined with ecclesiastical Christian architecture. Based on the comparison of Byzantine text sources with the settlement’s topography and its architecture, Caričin Grad is supposed to be identical to Iustiniana Prima, a city newly founded by the Emperor Justinian as the region’s episcopal and administrative centre. With the period of occupation covering a mere 90 years, from circa AD 530 to circa AD 615, the site allows a rare archaeological “snapshot” of a short period of very intensive use, which furthermore remained undisturbed from later encroachments. Due to these circumstances, Caričin Grad offers the unique opportunity to analyse a city at the turn of the Late Antique era to the Early Medieval epoch and the complex issues associated with periods of cultural transition. Based on the perspective of human ecology and social sciences, the project will establish new approaches and investigate the concept of “city” during periods of cultural transition by using methods of archaeozoology, archaeobotany, geoarchaeology, soil science and GIS. The main topic addressed within this context, “Households, consumption and everyday life” will deal with single domestic units concerning methods of production, consumption and activity zones regarding comestible goods. This perspective on the town and its consumption will be complemented by a viewpoint on the surrounding landscape focussing on its resources and agrarian production."
