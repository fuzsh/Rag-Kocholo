        "text": "Abstract: The site of Nova tabla near Murska Sobota revealed the remains of an early medieval settlement. These remains included the sunken features SZ 6 and SO 149A, charcoal samples from which have yielded 14 C dates that indicate the site was already inhabited in the first half of the 6 th century. The associated pottery is comparable with the so-called Prague type pottery unearthed in Croatia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Ukraine. In Slovakia and Germany, sunken features and graves with such pottery have also been dated with the help of 14 C analyses, while the sites in Ukraine are dated on the basis of typochronological analyses of the metal artefacts and finds of Byzantine coins. Such early settlement of the western fringes of the Pannonian Plain on the part of Prague culture groups, most likely corresponding to the Early Slavs, is supported by the spatial distribution of the Late Antique and Langobard settlements in the 6 th century, by the results of linguistic analyses and by the first written records mentioning the presence of Slavs in Pannonia.\n\nThe recent salvage excavations in Slovenia have brought to light a number of early medieval settlements. One of the most important is Nova Tabla, near Murska Sobota. A relatively large number of radiocarbon dates obtained from charcoal samples collected from that site have encouraged speculations about the date of the Slavic settlement in Prekmurje (the region along the river Mura). However, both the collection and the publication of the radiocarbon dates are faulty, and the conclusions drawn on such a basis are therefore wrong. The paper addresses those notions and suggests a new interpretation of the site. Over the last few decades, salvage archaeology has completely changed the understanding of the early medieval settlements and cemeteries of East Central Europe. Large-scale infrastructure programs, such as the construction of highways, have led to the discovery of many new sites. In Slovenia, archaeological excavations carried out between 1995 and 2008 along the route of the highway segment between Celja and Lendava (central and eastern Slovenia, respectively) have brought to light a relatively large number of settlement sites in the valley of the river Mura (part of the region known in Slovenia as Prekmurje), south of present-day Murska Sobota. 1 Simultaneously, salvage and systematic excavations have brought to light many more sites in northern Croatia, along the southern bank of the Drava (the region known in Croatia as\n\nThe article initially shows a short presentation of medieval archaeological sites of the Slovenian Pomurje and Podravje regions, which have been discovered after 2008, following the completion of major research projects on the Podravje and Pomurje motorway routes. In sequel the article presents the results of a synthesis attempt of the settlement of Slovenian Pomurje and Podravje in the early Middle Ages. In doing so, we took into account archaeological as well as historical, linguistic and cartographic sources. Known archaeological data were mapped separately according to time of formation: an initial settlement in the 6th–7th centuries, developed settlement in the 8th–9th centuries and the settlement after the arrival of the Magyars in Pannonia in the 10th–11th centuries. In doing so, we payed special attention to the position of settlement points depending on the soil and hydrological characteristics of the area. In addition, we observed their position in relation to the proximity of historic transport corridors. Changes in settlement pattern throughout the centuries were interpreted as a consequence of the introduction of different agrarian activities. The initial settlement of the 6th–7th centuries focus on areas of moist alluvial soil suitable for animal husbandry. Developed settlement of the 8th–9th centuries moves to the agriculturally more suitable space on the edge of the gravelly river fan. In the 10th–11th centuries, immediately after the settlement of Hungarians in Pannonia, the settlement re-focus on areas of moist soil, which we again associated with an increase in livestock production. Despite strong caesura in the settlement, which applies to the result of the Hungarian plundering expeditions from the end of the 9th to the mid-10th century, we observe in the area of most important settlements in the 9th century, were certain non-agrarian central functions where carried out, a continuity of settlement in the second half of the 10th and 11th centuries. As an important factor in the formation of non-agrarian central functions of the 9th century has proven to be a strategic location on major transport corridors.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2005 at Brunn am Gebirge, Lower Austria, at the southern border of Vienna, parts of a big early Neolithic settlement could be prospected and excavated. The terrain is flat and has a slight rise in the direction to the northeast. The remains of longhouses found belong to different separated groups, which were called sites 1–7. 77 longhouses are known by now, most of them by excavation, some of them only after their destruction by trenches and a big part by magnetic prospection. But as not the whole area has been prospected, a total number of more than 100 houses can be expected. The excavated area is about 100 000 m2. The total area with the sites has a length of more than 1km and a breadth of 400 m, so only a small part has been excavated till now. The houses are usually oriented south-north with deviations to the west and also to the east at different sites. Their dimensions are 20 m length and 7–8 m breadth. There are different constructions visible, mainly in the better preserved part of site 3. If these differences are functional or chronological is still under investigation. Currently we see the absolute time frame between 5650–5150 BC for the whole settlement. The oldest part of the settlement may be localized in site 2a, then followed by 2b, 3, 5, 4, 1 and 6 (7 is only known by some shards). In the oldest parts Linear Ceramics is missing, the rough ceramics is burnt at lower temperatures and has no or at least only plastical ornaments. The pot forms from site 2 are very similar to that from excavations in southern Hungary and Croatia, attributed to the Starčevo Culture, partially to the phase Early Starčevo Linear B and mostly to the late Starčevo Spiraloid B. From site 3 going the rise upwards to the younger parts of the settlement Linear Ceramics is increasing. Parallel runs the increasing use of fine ceramics besides the coarse one. On the other hand the number of idols found is decreasing. Also for the stone implements a development is visible in the same direction from the oldest site 2 to the youngest site 1. Of special interest is that we found many stone implements, more than 10.000, which is very much in contrast to other Austrian sites. At the beginning the main raw material is coming from Bakony-Szentgál, near Lake Balaton in Hungary. Local “Hornstein” is used very seldom. This percentages are changing continuously from old to young. At the end of the development in site 1 and 6, we have only a small number of local lithic material. Animal bones are not preserved in a big number at site 2. But we can also see a development in the usage of animals in the course of time. In site 3 it seems that capra-ovis bones are dominating and in the youngest site 1bovids is preferred."
