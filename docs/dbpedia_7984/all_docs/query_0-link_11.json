        "text": "Urbanism of Roman Siscia: Interpretation of historical and modern maps, drawings and plans presents a comprehensive picture of the structure of Roman Siscia. The information has been obtained from the processing of the data from every archaeological excavation, and the analysis and interpretation of all available historical and modern documents. The position of Siscia at the confluence of the rivers Sava, Kupa and Odra below the present-day town of Sisak, is documented in the antique literary sources and in cartography through the Middle Ages, to modern times, when the site became the subject of archaeological excavations beginning in the second part of the 19th century. In the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century, the basic outline of Roman Siscia was identified with town walls, public buildings, shrines, water supply system, cemeteries and the main roads that connected the city with other Roman towns. An older settlement, Segestica, dating from prehistory, was identified on the right bank of the Kupa River. The excavations carried out from the 1950s to 1990s were connected with the construction of the infrastructure and development of modern Sisak. These excavations confirmed the basic elements of the perimeter and urban elements of Roman Siscia: a Roman ditch and the town wall were discovered in several places, as well as an orthogonal street network, public buildings, houses, and other elements of the Roman city. This volume provides a comprehensive starting point for all future work on the Roman city.\n\nContents\n\nForeword ;\n\n1. Introduction ;\n\n2.
