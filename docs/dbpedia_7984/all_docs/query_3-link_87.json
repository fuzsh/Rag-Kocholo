The settlements/findings around Lake Garda was clearly for water.\n\nI note that Paul the deacon was correct in that the lombards settled firstly in eastern Austria as per the map\n\nR1b-U106 not germanic at all, only NW archaic I-E germanized only during the Volkswanderungen??? I don't agree:\n\nsurely some R-U106 were present at low level among Belgae and N-Celts (arrived late enough, maybe at iron Ages), the maxima of U106 is among the Frisia people and these ones are late came people in N-Netherlands! and they are more 'nordic' than a lot of Scandinavians; they were preceded there, I think, by a mix of Megalithers+Danubians neolithical people+ Mesolithic \"aborigenes\" already partially indoeuropeanized since the Funnelbeaker period, the most of R1b-U106 bearers were part of the 'germanic cristallization' around Denmark, I think... I have not the new results for SNPs but comparing STR, we see the \"frison\" STR is commoner in N-Netherlands and far less common South of the Rhine river in S-Netherlands, yet today: so the first I-E speaking populations before Germanics were not the strongest for U106: a point again here! I told yet U106 bearers were settled early enough south the baltic shores, maybe as far ago as the Bronze Age, maybe before-\n\nI don' t know about present day Lombardy for R-U106 - apparently the have about 6% of Y-I1, what is more than the remnant of Italy but poor enough at absolute rate - but genuine ancient Longobards were never the majority in these celtic lands of N-C-Italy - and Lombardy currently have about 1,5% of Y-I2a2, what is far less than central Italy of Urnfields-Villanova-Umbrian affinities (Y-I2a2 has nothing to do with typical Germanics: it diffused among them from the metallurgic or ores regions of pre-Germany, maybe acculturing them partially, but the relative distribution of Y-I2a2 compared to global Y-I is not so strong in N-parts of \"Great Germania-Scandinavia\" - in this relative %, it is more \"occidental european\" than \"northern european\" or \"eastern european\"-\n\nwhen compared to I1 only, I2a2 is ridiculously weak in Scandinavia and on this aspect and rapport, Irish and French, even eastern Frenchmen (Burgundians?), and too western Iberians (Wisigoths Ostrogoths, Sueves?) look closer to Scandinavians (Vikings and Co) than modern Lombards of today Italy, and of course than modern Netherlanders - but if Longobards were more on the W-germanic side???\n\nthe problem will be: are the cemeteries studied of real longobard settlers or of a mix of Longobards and allies? (as very often the time is of importance, that were seen in other invaded lands)\n\nskwizh on ha moned a ran da gousked!\n\nkenavo, read you again...\n\nIIRC paul the deacon stated that the lombards first settled around eastern Austria and where the first people to clash with the migrating slavs coming from the east around 650AD.\n\nWell, if i remember correctly it was Prokopius who recorded the migration of the Langobarden once they emerged on the Danube.\n\nThe Langobarden first settled in Rugiland [North of the Danube - after Odoaker defeated the Rugii] ~ 488 AD\n\nThe Langobarden clashed with the Heruli (not Slavs) in ~ 508 AD; [disputes over the Langobarden princess Rumetruda]\n\nThe Heruli had a powerful kingdom between the March and Theiss rivers (North of the Danube),\n\nbut after a massive battle (recorded by Prokopius) the Langobarden defeated the Heruli and their King Rodulf commited suicide. [End of the Heruli Kingdom]\n\nThe Langobarden King Audoin marched into Pannonia ~526 AD; with the Byzantine Emperor Justinian granting the Langobarden full control of Pannonia & Noricum [South of the Danube] ~547/548 AD\n\nThe Langobarden were an important part of the Byzantine army during the Gothic war in Italy (Battle of Taginae 552 AD);\n\nNeil Christie - Towns and Their Territories Between Late Antiquity and the Early Middles Ages (2000)\n\nSubsequently, according to Procopius, in 547/548 the Byzantine emperor Justinian \"bestowed upon the Lombards the towns (poleis) of Noricum and the fortresses of Pannonia\", meaning Pannonia Savia and Sccunda with a formal recognition of their existing holds in the north.\n\nIts important to note that the Hunnic invasion [390 - 454 AD] caused massive turmoil amongst the Germanic peoples and Sarmatians; And therefor the History of the Balkans (after Attila and the Battle of Nedao) is fundamental in understanding the Germanic migration era and Early Byzantine Politics;\n\nReading about the Ostrogoths in Jordanes and Cassiodorus or the Langobarden in Prokopius and Paul the Deacon reveals a lot about this time.\n\n- Histories & Chronicles\n\nhttp://www.northvegr.org/\n\nOstrogoths , visigoths etc already went through Italy prior the Lombards, what findings do you expect?\n\nNot concerning Italy;\n\nIn General comparing migration era Germanic tribes with each other.\n\nWell, if i remember correctly it was Prokopius who recorded the migration of the Langobarden once they emerged on the Danube.\n\nThe Langobarden first settled in Rugiland [North of the Danube - after Odoaker defeated the Rugii] ~ 488 AD\n\nThe Langobarden clashed with the Heruli (not Slavs) in ~ 508 AD; [disputes over the Langobarden princess Rumetruda]\n\nThe Heruli had a powerful kingdom between the March and Theiss rivers (North of the Danube),\n\nbut after a massive battle (recorded by Prokopius) the Langobarden defeated the Heruli and their King Rodulf commited suicide.

So by the time the Lombards departed the Pannonian plain and moved towards Italy they had a considerable amount of R1b-U152 and small percentage of G2, and R1a-Z94+... (maybe Z2122+ and/or Z2123+) thrown in for good measure! A real barbarian mix with a small German speaking elite.\n\nI agree for the most with you, but I 'm not sure scandinavian Hgs ahve to be excluded from continental Germanics tribes, because I suppose the germanization is a process where a big osmose North-South was envolved: only the percentages showed some variations, I think...\n\n@ zanipolo\n\nFara = German fahren / English fare\n\nIts a Germanic term, also present amongst the Bajuwaren - Faramanni\n\nLangobarden place names in Northern Italy (mostly Po Valley)\n\nhttp://www.terraorobica.net/Articoli...Longobarde.htm\n\nFara Langobarden towns in North Italy\n\n---\n\nYes,\n\nTacitus, Ptolemy and Strabo all place the Langobarden on the lower Elbe;\n\nHowever the Origo Gentis records a migration from the East after a battle with the Vandals;\n\nStrabo also records that the Langobarden migrated (fled) to the Elbe from the east;\n\nStrabo - Book VII\n\nNow as for the tribe of the Suevi, it is the largest, for it extends from the Rhenus to the Albis; and a part of them even dwell on the far side of the Albis, as, for instance, the Hermondori and the Langobardi; and at the present time these latter, at least, have, to the last man, been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river.\n\nThe Langobarden called themselves Winniler, before the conflict with the Vandals;\n\nOrigo Gentis Langobardorum - Chap.I\n\nThen the leaders of the Wandals, that is, Ambri and Assi, moved with their army, and said to the Winniles: ‘Either pay us tribute or prepare yourselves for battle and fight with us.’ Then answered Ybor and Agio, with their mother Gambara: ‘It is better for us to make ready the battle than to pay tributes to the Wandals.’ Then Ambri and Assi, that is, the leaders of the Wandals, asked Godan that he should give them the victory over the Winniles. Godan answered, saying: ‘Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.’ At that time Gambara with her two sons, that is, Ybor and Agio, who were chiefs over the Winniles, besought Frea, the wife of Godan, to be propitious to the Winniles.\n\nAcc. to the Historia Gentis Langobardorum,\n\nthe Winniler migrated from Scadanan > Scoringa (Baltic coast) > Mauringa (east Elbe lands)\n\nI dont know from what study this is (a Polish study) - but it shows the Langobarden (Longobardowie) clustering closest to the Przeworska culture;\n\nPrzeworska culture = Iron age culture, closest associated with the Vandals;\n\nS. J. Shennan - Archaeological Approaches to Cultural Identity (2003)\n\nThe archaeological Vandals —i.e. the Przeworsk culture— show many similarities in the material record with the Early Iron Age cultures of North Jutland and of the Eastern parts of Central Celtic Europe."
