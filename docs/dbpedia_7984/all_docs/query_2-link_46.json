        "text": "The city of Sisak is located southeast of Zagreb and is bordered by the beautiful large rivers Kupa and Sava. Only the geographical position and natural advantages have resulted in the accelerated development of this city from ancient times to the present day. Of the number of famous historical figures associated with the city, the main place is occupied by the Sisak patron and bishop Kvirin. Throughout history, Sisak was marked by wars against the Turks that lasted for almost 5 centuries, the most famous being the battle of Sisak in 1593, when almost all of Europe was defended from the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, Sisak became more and more focused on tourism and improving its tourist offer, especially thanks to its protected wetlands of the nature park, rare rural wooden architecture, the old fortified town of Sisak, the attractive town center Siscia."
