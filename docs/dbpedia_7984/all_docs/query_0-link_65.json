        "text": "<strong>ILLYRICUM</strong> <strong>IN</strong> <strong>CHRISTIAN</strong> <strong>LITERATURE</strong> UNTIL THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE A SHORT REVIEW OF POLITICAL EVENTS Dalmatia and Pannonia were amongst the most important parts of the Roman Empire. As the Province was being threatened by Barbarians from the east, Salona was ruled by the legatus augusti who had the military and civil power. During these turmoiled times military commanders from these provinces managed to obtain imperial honours, so the Pannonian prefect, Lucius Septimus Severus, who had proclaimed himself as son of Marcus Aurelius, managed to overtake the imperial authority relying on his Pannonian army in the year 193, \"the year of the four emperors\". Military commanders in Pannonia, such as Pacatianus and Decius, wanted imperial authority. Decius, who originated from Sirmium, managed to do so (249-251). Virtus Illyrici (Illyrian wit), which he had engraved as an inscription on his coins, didn't help him for long as he died in battle against the Greeks. During the 3rd century military and civil authorities were separated in order to watch the borders in a more alert manner. During the times of the emperor Galien (254- 268), instead of being ruled by the imperial legate (legatus augusti), the province was headed by the prefect (praeses provinciae) who had civil authority in Salona and the border commander (dux Illyriciani limitis) who had military authority. The reputation of military officers grew to the point that the army often imposed them as emperors. Claudius II, Gothicus, originating from Dalmatia or south Illyricum, before becoming emperor (268-270), was commander of the whole Illyricum (dux totius Illyrici). His days ended in Sirmium, and in 270 the Pannonian legions elected Aurelianus (Lucius Domitius Aurelianus) as emperor. Aurelianus was probably born in Sirmium or its surroundings. He introduced dominate (Dominus et Deus) to the state. After his death in Bitinia, in 275 in the war against the Persians, there were two emperors during a short period.The throne was then seated by the Illyrian Probus (Marcus Aurelius Probus, called Aequitius, 276-282). He was killed in the vicinity of Sirmium, and the army chose the Pretorian prefect, the Illyrian Carus (282-283) as emperor. He filled the post of praeses Provinciae from 282 to 284. The election of Constantius Clorus, who later also became emperor, speaks for itself of the importance of this Roman province. Carus was succeeded by his sons: Numerianus in the East (283-284) and Carinus in Gaul (285), who had to fight Julianus for power in Pannonia, and then Diocletianus (Gaius Valerius Aurelius Diocletianus, 284-305) who had a lengthy authority in the Roman Empire. Maximilianus (Marcus Aurelianus Valerius Maximilianus) was also Pannonian, and in 286 Diocletianus took him as an Augustus, and Galerius and Constantinus were Illyrians whom Diocletianus named caesars. In 297 Diocletianus divided the empire in 4 prefectures, 13 dioceses and 116 provinces. The Dalmatian province was divided into two prefectures: Praevalis with 1"
