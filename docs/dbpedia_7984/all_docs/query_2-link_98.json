        "text": "Segestica was an ancient city in Croatia, now known as Sisak. Segestica was once a part of Illyria, and it was conquered by the Roman Republic general Manius Julius in the winter of 260 BC; 956 of its people were enslaved after the city's capture. The Greek buildings were demolished and replaced by Roman buildings, and Segestica became known as \"Siscia\". Segestica's \"old town\" was maintained over the following centuries, but the town was gradually replaced by the new town of Sisak."
