        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn his paper the author examines the sources of the supposed Western Roman military expedition of Emperor Avitus in Pannonia in 455 that was thought to be the last Roman military action in the territory of the former Roman province. Analizing the sources, he comes to the conclusion that during his short reign, Avitus had no time to visit the province and his route (iter) mentioned by Sidonius Apollinaris must be identified with his journey from Arelate to Rome. The Roman military action in Pannonia can probably be identified with a short demonstrative campaign in the SW region of the dioecesis (i.e. Savia) or with a legation of the Pannonian Barbarians to the emperor in Northern Italy.\n\nOne of the last episodes of late Roman Pannonia was – according to several theories – that Emperor Avitus would have visited Pannonia in 455–456 AD and regained the control of the provinces after Attila’s death and the battle of Nedao in 454.1 Some scholars even tried to localize it exactly, and the last Roman period of the inner fort of Keszthely-Fenékpuszta had been connected to this event.2 As the fort was interpreted as a supply base of Avitus they identified its final destruction layer and mass graves with an unknown siege of the Ostrogoths who arrived at the province in the following year.3 Despite these opinions, in my paper I intend to deal with this supposed imperial visit, and first of all, with its sources.\n\nConcerning Avitus’ Pannonian visit only one single written source exists, a panegyric, written and presented by Sidonius Apollinaris to the emperor, his father-in-law, on the occasion of his consulship in Rome on 1 January 456.4\n\nSidonius Apollinaris Carm. VII.588–591 hic tibi restituet Libyen per vincula quarta, / et cuius solum amissas post saecula multa / Pannonias revocavit iter, iam credere promptum est / quid faciat bellis.\n\n‘He shall restore Libya to thee a fourth time in chains—and when a man has recovered the lost Pannonias after so many generations by a mere march, ’tis easy to feel sure even now of what he can do by waging war’ (translation by B. W. Anderson).\n\nIn the latter passage of the panegyric (lines 585–598), the poet depicted Avitus’ anticipated victories, mainly a success against the Vandals.5 These were illustrated by the emperor’s march/route (iter) that recovered the province. Examining the text, it becomes clear that there was no fight and the success was achieved only (solum) by the route itself.\n\nThe supposed event can be dated exactly as it surely happened between the elevation of Avitus at Arelate (9 July 455) and the presentation of the panegyric (1 January 456), most probably after 21 September when Avitus entered Italy. Several written sources are available concerning his short reign in 456 (15 months: cf. Chron. Gall. 625 Chron. min. I p. 664). His Pannonian visit cannot be supposed to happen in this year because Avitus had no opportunity to leave Rome and visit Pannonia (and it should have lasted at least three months). During his reign he stayed constantly in Rome and he had to deal with several much more serious problems than Pannonia. Despite his attempts, he was never recognized by East Rome, the Vandals attacked Sicily and Corsica, there was a famine in Rome, he could hardly pay his Gaulish Barbarian mercenaries, he had to send him back. From the very beginning, he was very unpopular in Rome and in the senate that finally revolted against him.6 Based on these Avitus’ supposed Pannonian visit (if ever existed) should be dated between September and December 455.\n\nThe following dates are available concerning Avitus’ reign.\n\nThe route mentioned in the text as already Anderson observed must be identified with Avitus’ journey from Arelate to Rome (another is unattested before his escape from Rome),9 and he entered Italy on 21 September (Auctar. Prosp. Haun. 7 Chron. min. I p. 304), therefore he could reach Rome at the beginning of October, as the earliest.10 Avitus could choose a shorter and faster continental route along the seashore (cca. 880 km) and a longer\n\n(cca. 1450 km), but more probable one was via Augusta Taurinorum–Mediolanum–Placentia–Ravenna in order to assure North-Italian capitals Mediolanum and Ravenna. Probably this time Avitus left his officer Remistus with troops (PLRE II, Remistus) at Ravenna (Chron. min. I p. 304). Both routes needed at least 45–60 days travel-time.11 Why did not he leave immediately after his elevation Arelate? His only probable reason was that he needed time to organize suitable troops for his travel and he wanted to appoint new, Gaulish officials and made a pact with the king of the Goths, Theoderic II in order to avoid the Suebian danger in Hispania (Cf. Sid. Ap. Carm. VII.475–580, esp. 510–518 and 520–521, Hyd. 163, 170, 173).12 During his journey Avitus could hardly make a detour in Pannonia as he had to hurry to Rome. However the senate probably acknowledged him in his absence as emperor (Hyd. 166 a Romanis et evocatus et susceptus fuerat imperator) (probably this date is given in Victor Tunnunensis’ work: 5 August (Chron. min. II p. 186); because of his Gaulish origin Avitus remained very unpopular in Rome and in the senate as well (that is why significant Gaulish and Goth troops followed him cf. Greg. Tur. II.11, Ioan. Ant. Frag. 202).13 His elevation could become complete only in Rome before the senate as the expression praesumptus honor mentioned in one of the continuations Prosper Tiro’s Chronicon, based on the Consularia Italica (Continuatio Hauniensis Prosperi) clearly shows (Chron. min. I p. 304). Hydatius mentioned his route to Rome as follows: 163 Romam pergit et suscipitur. As Sidonius Apollinaris or another source omit to mention where Avitus exactly entered Italy but the suggested14 route via Noricum or Pannonia must surely be excluded as a route Arelate–Noricum– Pannonia–Rome is unattested. During his route, Avitus probably stopped at Mediolanum as Lacam suggested, but a Pannonian detour seems to be improbable.15\n\nIn view of this, the emperor never visited Pannonia or any other province of dioecesis Illyricum, Avitus as Aetius’ officer fought much earlier in Noricum (lines 232–233).16 On the other hand, Mathisen correctly came to the conclusion that the plural Pannoniae used by Sidonius Apollinaris could concern the other provinces of West-Illyricum.17 For instance, Savia, Noricum mediterraneum had a special role in the defence of Italy and the Alps and one of Avitus’ commanders could make a detour in this direction in order to confirm the claustra Alpium that signifcantly weakened during Attila’s Italian campaign in 452.18\n\nLatter event could confirm the Roman authority in the region that never belonged to the Huns and local Barbarian nominally acknowledged the Roman rule (based on a new foedus?). This success could have been mentioned in the panegyric. The revocatio Pannoniarum, establishing the Roman rule in entire Pannonia was naturally Sidonius Apollinaris’ poetice exaggeration but the use of the plural Pannoniae can mean that at least two provinces of dioecesis Pannonia, Savia and the Norican provinces (?) were recovered.\n\nWhat could be the reasons Avitus’ activity in Western Illyricum?\n\nFirst of all, as a new emperor he had to prove his abilities as supreme commander of the Roman army.19\n\nAfter Nedao, a power vacuum is formed in Pannonia that the Gepids in Transylvania could not and did want to fill.\n\nAnother factor must also be considered: Marcellinus,20 comes Illyrici (PLRE II, Marcellinus 6) backed by Constantinople revolted against the western rulers after Aetius’ death (Proc. Bell. Vand. I.6.7), and he did not acknowledge Avitus’ reign either. Because of this fact, Avitus had to secure main continental roads leading from Italy to Constantinople.21\n\nThe next point is that Avitus intended to recognize his rule with East Rome. His attempts (legation: Hyd. 166, coin minting in Marcianus’ name: RIC 10 (1994) 2303–2305 and p. 181), according to his propaganda were successful (Hyd. 169), but Marcianus most probably never recognized him (cf. his consulship was not recognized in East, never promulgated laws together, coins were not minted in eastern mints in Avitus’ name). Avitus probably tried diplomatically to solve the disputes situation of Illyricum between East and West.22 This could have been followed by a demonstrative campaign of a part of his army. Based on the treaty concluded in 424, realized in 437 following Valentinian’s and Eudoxia’s marriage (Cassiodorus Var. XI.1.9, Jord. Rom. 329), a part of West Illyricum, probably only Pannonia II came to the jurisdiction of Constantinople (cf. Attila occupied Sirmium during a war against East Rome in 441: Prisc. Frag. 11.1 and 2, Iust. Nov. XI.1–2, Hierocles Synecdemus c. XIX, Not. ep. eccl. Const. 13,848).23 The Goths were settled down into Pannonia in 456 following a foedus with Marcianus in territory of Pannonia I, II and Valeria (Jord. Get. L.264, LII.268, 270, 272).24 In the former passage, Jordanes geographically described Pannonia, its boundaries and cities. The author used several late antique geographic works (esp. Rav. Geogr. IV.19, Dim. prov. 18, Oros. I.2.27, Cosm, II.27), but he mentioned only nearest and the furthermost cities of the province in the point of view of Constantinople, Sirmium and Vindobona: Ornata patria civitatibus plurimis, quarum prima Syrmis, extrema Vindomina. His description has nothing to do with the new home-land of the Goths that he described separately: 268 qui in Pannonia sub rege Valamir eiusque germani Thiudimer et Videmir mora­ bantur, quamvis divisa loca, consilia tamen unita (nam Valamer inter Scarniungam et Aqua nigra fluvios, Thiudimer iuxta lacum Pelsois, Vidimer inter utrosque manebant. Their land lay between the lacus Pelso/Balaton in Pannonia I and two rivers, the Scarniunga and the Aqua nigra in Valeria or Pannonia II (both are unidentifiable as they are not antique hydronyms, the former is clearly German name25 that show the lack of Roman provincial population in Valeria). It cannot be accidental that Eugippius later localized the Goths in Pannonia inferior: Eug. v. Sev. 5.1 Ru­ gorum siquidem rex, nomine Flaccitheus, in ipsis regni sui coepit nutare primordiis habens Gothos ex inferiore Pannonia vehementer infensos, quorum innumera multitudine terrebatur. That is why Goths could have fought against the Sadages/Sadagarii, qui interiorem Pannoniam possidebant (Jord. Get. LIII.272).26 Pannonia secunda was included into the Gothic rule as the easternmost Pannonian town, Bassiana was defended by the Goths against the Hun siege (LIII.272 venientesque ad Basianam Pannoniae civitatem eamque circumvallans fines eius coepit praedare. 273 Quod conperto Gothi ibi, ubi erant, expeditionemque solventes, quam contra Sadagis collegerant, in Hunnos convertunt et sic eos suis a finibus inglorios pepulerunt). The continuation of Jordanes’ account dealing with the Dalmatian incursion of the Suebi is more interesting: 273 Quiescente vero tandem Hunnorum gente a Gothis Hunumundus Suavorum dux dum ad depraedandas Dalmatias transit, armenta Gothorum in campis erran­ tia depraedavit, quia Dalmatia Suaviae vicina erat nec a Pannonios fines multum distabat, praesertim ubi tunc Gothi residebant. Latter passage clearly shows that the land of the Goths was in the near of Dalmatia and Suavia, that proves, originally, Savia was not included in Marcianus’ foedus with the Goths27 but the Hunimundus’ Suebians did not live in province as the returning Suebi were defeated by the Goths by the Balaton (LIV.274) and the Danube (LV.280). Based on this fact, already Schmidt and others suggested Avitus’ role in the new treaty but Jordanes did not mention the western ruler. Avitus’ route mentioned by Sidonius Apollinaris cannot be identified with a legation of the Goths who would have met the emperor at Mediolanum.28 On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that other Barbarians living in Noricum or Savia as the Rugians or Suebi would have intended to settle their situation with the new emperor and Avitus could have regained the control over these provinces based on a new foedus.\n\nThese Barbarians in Savia could have been the antiqui Barbari mentioned in Cassiodorus’ Variae (Var. V.14.6), who were in all likelihood Germans (probably Suebi: cp. the consciously used variant of the province name Savia/Suavia (i.e. land of the Suebi) in Jordanes’ works and in the early medieval manuscript tradition of several other works but it is clear that they were not identical (the Goths defeated the Suebi returning from Dalmatia by the Balaton and later, Thiudimer let them go home to Suavia, i.e. North of the Balaton) and the official province name could not be Suavia (cf. Cassiodorus used always the variant Savia: IV.49, V.14.6, 15, IX.8): Jord. Rom. 218, Get. LIII.273, 274, Chron. min. I p. 539). These Barbarians recorded his earlier arrival even in the 6th century (before the Ostrogoths’ rule in Italy and Savia).29\n\nIt cannot be accidental that Marcianus who intended to normalize the situation in the Danubian provinces after Nedao concluded foedera with the winner Gepids (Jord. Get. L.264)30 and the Goths as well. It is striking that province Savia was not included in the treaty. That is why it can be supposed that the strategically important provinces remained (Noricum mediterraneum, Savia) under the control of Avitus.\n\nOther contemporary events can show that the recovery of a part of Western Illyricum, i.e. Savia and Noricum mediterraneum/ripense cannot be excluded in this period:\n\nBased on the treaty, the Goths were settled down into several provinces of West-Illyricum, i.e. in Pannonia prima, Valeria and Pannonia secunda but they avoided the provinces that were important strategically, i.e. Savia and Noricum mediterraneum.\n\nMajorian collected a strong but ethnically complex army in 459 in order to regain the control over Gaul, Hispania and Africa (cf. Sid. Ap. Carm. V,472–479), but he had to fight against the revolting commander of his army, the Hun Tuldila (PLRE II, Tuldila) and his people (Carm. V,483–510).31 According to Sidonius Apollinaris’ remark, they came from the direction of the Danube where he lost their lords, i.e. most probably the Huns who lost their king, Ellac in the battle of Nedao in 454 (Carm. V,485–487):32 quae nuper ab Histro / rettulit indomitum solito truculentior agmen / quod dominis per bella caret. In the description of Majorian’s army the poet enumareted Huns, Suebi, Rugians, Ostrogoths, Sarmatians and Pannonians among other, fictitious or hardly known peoples. Barbarians who lived now in the territory of the former Roman province may have been called Pannonians (Carm. V,475).33 Based on these two passages it seems highly likely that Majorian called these Danubian Barbarians based on foedus that could have been concluded by Avitus.\n\nAccording to the account of the Fasti Vindobonienses Priores 577 that used the lost Consularia Italica written in Ravenna, Savaria was destroyed by an earthquake 9 September 456.34 The destruction had to be big enough to record it in the Fasti where only the activities of emperors (mainly Western), campaigns, Barbarian incursions or ecclesiastical events and interesting natural phenomena (eclipses, bigger earthquakes) were mentioned. In this case the event was placed among the records concerning Avitus’ reign. Probably the same earthquake was mentioned in Eugippius’ vita Severini in the region of Comagene (Tulln) in Noricum in a distance of approx. 100 km from Savaria (Eug. v. Sev. 2).35 On the other hand, the fact that news of the catastrophe reached Noricum and Northern Italy does not mean that Savaria and Western Pannonia I would have belonged to the Roman Empire, but it clearly shows the presence of provincial population in the former Roman colony.\n\nComing to conclusion, Avitus had no opportunity to command personally a military action or an imperial visit in Pannonia during his short reign. The iter can only be identified with his route from Arelate to Rome. There was hardly any chance to regain the control over the entire territory but a smaller military action or a legation can be supposed in the autumn of 455 and as a result of this Rome recovered the SW part of the dioecesis, namely province Savia and Noricum mediterraneum in order to confirm the security of Italy. Another possibility is that during his route a Barbarian legation from Pannonia met the emperor in Northern Italy and they concluded some kind of foedus that was interpreted by Sidonius Apollinaris as the recovery of Pannonia. The late Roman inner fort of Fenékpuszta and its destruction has nothing to do with Emperor Avitus.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nThe relevant sources\n\nSidonius Apollinaris Carm.
