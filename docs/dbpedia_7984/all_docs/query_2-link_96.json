While the paper begins with the end of the industrial era in a medium-size socialist industrial city, it aims to consider what comes next. We argue that post-industrial subjectivity emerges and that activism arises after the collapse of industrialism as a particular strategy to negotiate living in the industrial landscape and to fight the inherited burdens of industrial pollution.",

        "text": "Ethnography of post-industrial pollution\n\n2For those who remain, the landscape also conceals shady activities related to hazardous waste storage. Here, the question of how to deal with socialist industrial remnants is yielding actual post-industrial ecological disputes. Over the last few years, these disputes have become ever more apparent.\n\n3We developed the concept of accidental environmentalism, which we use interchangeably with accidental environmental activism, in order to grasp the social agency that is not focused on one type of environmental concern, and is not permanent, but is accidental in how it came to being and how it unfolds. The example of accidental environmental activism encountered during our fieldwork impelled us to investigate the resistance to secretive political efforts directed at using the backyards in the Novo Pračno settlement in the Southern Industrial Zone (FIG. 2) for building an underground landfill for medical waste disposal. Thus, we unexpectedly ventured into the ethnography of post-industrial pollution and came to recognise its interconnectedness with post-industrial anthropology.\n\nEthnography of late industrialism in the light of environmental entanglements\n\n10The new dilemmas incorporate a feeling of having no real choice – only a helpless choice of a greater or lesser evil. In the past, they believe that they chose jobs. Job had a clear priority, even if health was risked and pollution produced. When one of our interlocutors casually mentioned that “[other citizens] do not want ‘green solution but pollution’” and concluded that “‘green and clean’ means nothing to us,” he spoke about the environmental classism typical for working-class communities. “Just give us pollution and contamination, and we’ll be fine,” the saying goes on. The resulting logic is that the city’s past polluting industry was not to its detriment, but to the benefit of workers. This kind of pollution is narrated as inevitable; it should not be fought against as long as it ensures livelihood. When asked about the pollution in the city, one of our informants recalled his youth:\n\n25 From interview with S., an architect and designer, mid-thirties, born in Sisak, September 2020.\n\nThere wasn’t much talk about it. “The refinery smells bad” and that was it. It was a normal thing. I remember waking up in the mornings to close the window because of the smell from the refinery brought in by the southern wind. … Actually, I [lived] not far away from the refinery because … maybe about two and a half kilometres away as the crow flies. But the pollution. ... My folks used to tell me that no questions were asked about the pollution because it was a kind of by-product ... you know ... “Let’s grin and bear it because we have factories, we have jobs.”\n\nIf I remember correctly, the talk picked up in 2004 or 2005. There was even a demonstration called “bal gas-masqué.” I was a teenager, in high school, and there was a stage set at the city’s main square, in front of the building of Veliki Kaptol. One of the radio announcers hosted the event. There was a protest line stretching all the way to the refinery. That was the time when everything started to crumble and the question was, like, “Why do we have to breathe that bad air?”\n\n11The awareness about choosing the greater evil, as we named it, is integrated in the industrial subjectivity and inseparably linked to class subjectivity, which associates the burden of pollution with industrial workers. As one of the informants told us, aware of the impossible choice:\n\n26 From group interview with members of civic initiative “Siscians don’t want to be scavengers,” Sisak (...)\n\nThey were all polluters, but back then, you knew the reason why. You had a job. You had moved to Sisak. You knew that’s the price of earning the livelihood for your family. To live in a polluted city. And that’s it! Today? Today you don’t have a job, but you sure have the pollution. ... It used to be like “... in sickness ...”[she laughs at her allusion to marital vows as if the citizens were married to industry and rightly stayed married to it in good and bad times].\n\n13Completely different narratives about urban environmental pollution emerge in the people-driven activist organisation and their activities around the newly opened waste processing plants. We interpret these narratives through the lens of a “historicised curse.” The “curse“ results from the existing industrial waste generated by the manufacturing processes of long-closed factories and the anticipation of future pollution, stemming from the announced construction of a liquid medical waste storage tank and waste incineration plant. As we strolled along the city walkway, from a small elevation, we could see the landfills packed with chemical waste from crude oil refinement along the banks of Kupa River. At the entrance of the former chemical factory Radonja, on the other side of the city, where a few small brownfield facilities for processing and storage of hazardous and non-hazardous waste have been located for a while, the nameplates appeared, featuring the names of waste processing companies. As our informants implied, Sisak has slowly but surely become a legitimate place of work for the Croatian “king of waste,” Petar Pripuz.\n\n“Siscians don’t want to be scavengers” – activists accidentally\n\n17After having learned in 2019 that two companies were granted the license to build plants for hazardous and non-hazardous chemical and infectious waste management, including the right to build an underground waste storage pool and waste processing facility, the civic initiative “Siscians don’t want to be scavengers” started with intensive public activities. We arranged an interview with several female members by phone and met with them in the centre of Sisak one late Sunday evening. We were told that they usually met once a week to debrief and plan new actions – we had been invited to attend that week’s meeting. Tatjana greeted us in front of the jazz club Mali Kaptol, where they usually meet. After everyone had arrived, the group moved down the walkway along the bank of Kupa River because the club had been reserved for a private event. We sat at a nearby bar in Tuškanova House and introduced ourselves to Tatjana, Katarina, Snježana and Andrea. Katarina was first to speak as the most vocal among them. She was publicly recognised as the representative of the group. Tatjana confirmed our impression a bit later, telling us that each of the women in the group played her own role. For herself, she said that she was the bully – loud and ready for action, even a violent one, if need be. She is in charge of writing objection letters and requests because she is sharp-tongued and feisty. Katarina is the spokeswoman, Snježana is a researcher and internet-savvy person, Andrea is backing them up when needed.\n\n18Our conversation started with the question about how they formed the group. They highlighted two things essential for understanding their resistance – first, they decided to stay and live in Sisak and fight against the notion that the city has no future. Second, they did not want the resources of the ruined industrial landscape to be used as an industrial waste storage site.\n\n35 For the protection of interests of our informants, their individual opinions and statements are cit (...)\n\nS1: Sisak has no finances anymore. The city had no idea where to get money from after industry died. Actually, it didn’t die, it was robbed and ... what I wanted to say is that they see their interest and source of income in waste management. No matter how much we fought against it, waste industry will come to Sisak. … We are horrified by the fact that Sisak is playing with the thought of becoming the city of waste. They need to fill the budget. ... They have to find the money somewhere. … There is a lot of crime, a lot of mafia in the city. These companies have been located here for a while, but in principle. ... They run a semi-legal business.\n\n19Another woman joins in:\n\nS2: Those are sister companies. ... And you don’t know who’s behind them. There were eight of them. In the end, when these octopus tentacles were untangled, it turns out that the head is one and the same company in Zagreb, the mother to all of these eight companies [for hazardous waste management; authors’ commentary]. And we have [discovered] twenty-seven of them ... companies dealing exclusively with waste, at the moment. … Waste management! That’s right! With eight of them having the license for hazardous waste management. When you look closer, you see that a single man owns all of these eight small companies.\n\n20While explaining the context that brought them together and the mechanisms they used for exposing the connection between politics and the waste management industry, one of the women said that the ownership links among the companies were concealed behind an especially suspicious and symptomatically corruptive model of the waste industry development in Sisak.\n\nS1: We, the citizens, didn’t know about it until the beginning of this year when the information surfaced. Completely accidentally ... a journalist found out. ... So we were totally uninformed, and their intention, their goal, was to keep us uninformed.\n\n21The clandestine information they learned about made them extra alert. Thus, the post-industrial community was formed when this information was published, reacting to the potential ecological provocation.\n\nS1: Look, in the beginning, we weren’t careful. … We were like ... I, specifically, live in the village where we found out overnight that hazardous chemical waste was to be disposed of.\n\nS2: A suburb neighbourhood! I mean really …!\n\nS1: Ok, so, a suburb neighbourhood … Novo Pračno … It’s about seven hundred meters away from the school. A kilometre away from my house …\n\nS2: Eight hundred meters from my place …\n\nS1: And that’s where the hazardous chemical waste was supposed to be deposited. Thirty thousand tons. We were horrified when we saw it.\n\n22The initiative acts and explains its motivation based on the experience of being horrified. Out of it comes the public protests, the attendance of open sessions of the City Council, the formation of the “Siscians don’t want to be scavengers” group, the investigative work on the circumstances under which Rijekatank and Remondis Medison set up their business in Sisak, the networking with other similar initiatives in the neighbouring cities, and the appeals and petitions. In trying to gain more support, the initiative exposed their findings in a Facebook post:\n\n36 The public Facebook group “Siscians don’t want to be scavengers!,” post by Snježana Sužnjević Vago, (...)\n\nWhy are we here?\n\nThe civic initiative “Siscians don’t want to be scavengers” was formed online, through social networks, because of the concerns that arose around the recent events in the city of Sisak and other cities in Sisak-Moslavina County, related to the arrival or announced arrival of companies that do hazardous and non-hazardous waste management. In a broader context, we are concerned about the announced nuclear waste disposal in Čerzekovac near Dvor na Uni, asbestos in Glina, communal waste from Zagreb in Novska, and everything else included in the notifications and pilot projects in Sisak. In Sisak, there are 28 companies that deal with hazardous and non-hazardous waste management, 5 of which work with hazardous waste. Sisak-Moslavina County is slowly turning into one big disposal site and landfill for different kinds of waste, the place intended for disposal of anything that richer and more developed countries don’t want in their backyards.\n\nWe are being assured that this hazardous and non-hazardous waste is not harmful, that it can be processed and managed without having any detrimental effect on people and the environment. At the same time, nuclear waste is being disposed of as far away from Zagreb and tourist areas as possible, and, for example, Zagreb communal waste is transported by train to the small town of Novska instead of to the incinerator that was supposed to be built in Zagreb. The company from Rijeka that has moved to Sisak is the company that was expelled from Rijeka because of multiple breaches of regulations, because of the bad smell it produced, and because of the protests of locals accusing it of causing them health problems. Other companies that arrived to Sisak in the last several years, or are about to arrive, are companies that filed papers because of their involvement in various ecological and safety incidents. At the same time, there is unprecedented deforestation and forest devastation across the County. Trees are disappearing, as well as animal habitats. We are consternated by the magnitude of the damage done, and we fear possible consequences. For these reasons, we as the citizens organised this group, and we are building networks with similar civic initiatives in other cities and towns in the County and beyond, whose goal is to protect the environment and prevent its further devastation.\n\nS1: We were also … hurt, as citizens, because it seems that we are discriminated against compared to the rest of Croatia. Because of the waste problem, some people in Zadar County will comment when they see us on the news, “Oh, poor Siscians. Poor, poor them.” But they won’t say: “OK, we’ll take on part of the waste because no one wants the waste.” Because the entire Croatia is glad that it won’t end up in their backyard. And then, in principle, we were discriminated against, we felt like we were, because nuclear waste is about to be dumped in our county …. You know that (…).\n\nS1: Well, I got us thinking, why is our health less important than the health of those living in Zagreb? Your child is as precious to you as mine is to me. What would people in Zagreb say if our waste was dumped in their city? I mean, who’d want it? We also feel discriminated against in that respect. If that waste is so harmless, why has it not remained in its city of origin? Because it is not a big plant, it’s a really small plant. It’s about four times this cafe in size. So it’s not such an amount of waste that Zagreb could not find any room for. But, as it seems, there’s no room for it. But, as it seems, it’s not as harmless as they say. ... It wouldn’t be transported all that way, every day, for sixty kilometres. ... That’s how we see it. So it is the discrimination that bothers us. We have been chosen as the target city for all the crap.\n\nS3: Because this area is poor. The entire county is poor. And the city was going down the tubes. Like, really falling to ruins all by itself. And on top of all that, we have to put up with this now. It could be organised differently. The entire story may be turned upside down. Given the poverty ... the pollution is not as bad as it could have been. So, why not make the most of these potentials? Why kill the possibility to bring all those healthy solutions here?\n\n25Being placed at the margin of economic activities, at the national economic periphery, the city has been perceived as poor and, thus, powerless. In other words, it became the perfect place for projects in waste management (FIG. 7, FIG. 8 and FIG. 9).\n\n26The initiative used a conventional approach in expressing its opposition to the city authorities and its non-transparent corporate development plans. However, although the Facebook group counts over 2,000 members and 1,347 people signed the petition, citizens-at-large do not always, or not often enough, recognise them as a positive initiative.\n\n27Certainly it is not easy to categorise this initiative. With their firm grasp on pollution issues and peripheral position vis-à-vis the political mainstream, the members of the initiative do not resemble a typical community-organised ecological group or movement. However, they do not resemble typical activist organisations either. They are women with professions – a physician, an investigative journalist, a city politician, an ecologist, a librarian, of diverse political loyalties, different lifestyles, and social standing.\n\n28Perhaps this in-between status explains why their fight for ecological justice has not received wide recognition. They do not have wide recognition either among the well-off or the poor and unemployed citizens of Sisak. Neither did they get strong support from city politicians. Moreover, they are symbolically punished at work and among their acquaintances for their petitions and vocal expression of distrust in the City Council. Such behaviour violates the norms and calls for stonewalling and blaming because most people still have ambivalent (if not still positive) feelings toward industry as a provider of secure jobs. One member of the initiative recounted, “at a meeting for coffee with girls, a friend of mine, a colleague who works at the County Council, said to me – and she was sitting right there – she told me: ‘Yes, the refinery is being closed down because of the likes of you.’”\n\n29Upon hearing this comment, retold during the group interview, the other women burst into cynical laughter. Ironising their responsibility for the collapse of Siscian industry, they started exchanging jokes at their own expense, interrupting each other, and exclaiming: “But of course, it’s us. … Yes!, we are to blame for the refinery being shut down.” One woman was adamant that people wronged them by accusing the initiative of certain actions: “It’s awful to imply that we stole all the material resources and industrial supplies! People don’t have a clue what this is all about.” Suspicions abound that their activity has a political background; they face accusations of conspiracy; and are dismissed as simply lacking common sense for rebelling against the prospect of new jobs. “Simply put, we were called ‘fucking hags’… [they said] we don’t want them to get employed.” But one of the members explained: “They [the waste processing companies] will employ ten people. … If they would employ a thousand people, if they did everything by the book – we’d say go for it!”\n\n30Another thing people found unusual was that only women were active. One of the women we interviewed said: “A friend of mine asked me: ‘Why are only women here?’ And I told him: ‘You tell me why only women are here. Do you get it?’” Another woman continued the explanation: “We have children, and it’s understandable our thinking is different. … Female energy...” Yet their roles as mothers are also raised to deter them: “I was told, ‘You don’t understand what you’ve got yourself into. You have kids and a family.’”\n\n31However, their impression was that they “did not present danger” and they “really did not put anyone at risk.” By the time we interviewed them, members of the initiative were disillusioned. They had asked for a change in the general urban plan, but they did not get it. They had asked for a ban on issuing licenses, and that did not happen. They had asked for a clear response as to why the city – which publicly claims to support sports and sustainable development – had been turned secretly into a city-landfill; they had never received an answer.\n\n32The experience of this initiative is instructive for better understanding the possibilities for grassroots environmental activity. We can conclude from this case, that it is almost impossible to realise the interests of a post-industrial community, especially those related to work and pollution issues, without strategic support and systematic networking of an environmentally-aware community in a broader sense. Existing collaborations have not yet yielded a sustainable model: one of the women in the initiative had become a member of the Sisak Environmental Protection Committee – itself newly established – but she resigned after only a few months. She thought it was something of a success that she made it into the committee and, indeed, that such a body had been formed at all. But the committee’s actions were as unsuccessful as those of her own initiative. The public response rate was low. If anything was achieved, it was simply that the “politicians stopped for a moment, wondering if there really is someone who wants and can show resistance.” Resistance, however, was something yet to come; something the members of the initiative were beginning to think was necessary as part of the community’s maturation and as a new type of social action. Current politics, she concluded, are corrupt: “They’ve got money, and money is the law here. If you’ve got money, you’ve got the power. You have everything you need! It’s something we should stand up to.”\n\n33Though the founders of the civic initiative “Siscians don’t want to be scavengers” were pessimistic when we interviewed them, their own actions – as well as their reflections on the small successes that had been made – indicate that a post-industrial ecological community in Sisak is present. This community emerges from the experience of living in an industrial landscape, but the former experience of powerlessness to influence the political and economic structures that make decisions about strategic development means that the community acts almost accidentally in response to local events – in this example, it was the acute fear of living next to a toxic waste landfill that prompted an improvised series of actions. Though initiatives within this community may be unplanned, it is an increasingly informed community that thinks about life and work after industry, conceptualises the future effects of pollution, and brings the topic into the public space for discussion.\n\nActive but not local activists – Ana, Marijan and Ivo\n\n34To show another side of the post-industrial ecological community in Sisak, we turn to describing some other citizens who see themselves as “active” but not as “activists.”\n\n41 Ana, excerpt from the interview, July 2019, Sisak.\n\nThe city promoted it as money incoming, as new jobs. (…) But, it is not an industry that employs hundreds of people. Also, it is an industry that brings down the value of other things, of arable land, organic food production, generally, of the property. Ironworks’ real estate is known to have the lowest market value in Croatia.\n\n36Ana’s insights are based on her ecological education and in her desire to live in a healthy and peaceful city, oriented toward sustainable development and a green economy. Her emotional and robust account during the interview showed us that there are citizens who are neither positive about, nor ambivalent to, the effects of industrial pollution. These citizens are available to gather in an ecological initiative; they are convinced that industrial pollution brings intolerable risk; and they have a vision for the future of the city. Moreover, they have developed an assessment of the underlying reasons why Sisak was identified as a location for brownfield development; and project that this logic will lead to a further vicious circle. For example, Ana believes that the earlier and yet-unaddressed industrial pollution, public image of a collapsing city, known loss of jobs, and presence of abandoned factory infrastructure made it easy for developers and public authorities agree that brownfield developments could do no heavier damage than had already been done, and might even do some good. Yet as Ana sees it, double damage will be done: further pollution will be worse and the new industry in waste management will make the city’s image so unfavourable that it will not be able to attract any non-polluting development projects.\n\n42 While Ana is no longer an offical member of the initiative, she still aligns herself with the initi (...)\n\n43 Ana, excerpt from the interview, July 2019, Sisak.\n\nThe prices [of real estate] will drop even more if people avoid moving into the city, if they show no desire to live here, and they won’t have any desire to live in a place where hazardous waste is being processed. Second, we are surrounded by rivers. This is a flood plain, clay soil, and the waters drain further down into the rivers, meaning that we contaminate our own river. More so, our landfill, Goričica, is located at the bank of the Kupa River, that is, Sava River. … These are the problems of the old industrial town, of the urban plan, that we as an organisation see as important. I’d say that Sisak is seen, in the eyes of the entire country, as: “Oh well, nobody else wants it, let’s move it to Sisak. It has always been the most contaminated area, so let’s keep it on like that. We need a place where to dump the worst waste.” So that’s it.\n\n38So far, the perspectives voiced by active but non-activist citizens would seem to be similar in their level of analytical sophistication to those of professional ecologists. Sometimes even much more sophisticated. For example, Ivo, othervise a professional ecological activist and scientist living and working in Zagreb, whom we contacted to get an expert opinion on brownfield developments and potential ecological catastrophes, answered with a reminiscence from the childhood years he spent in Sisak:\n\n45 From oral interview with a professional environmental activist and scientist, Sisak, May 2020.\n\nI wasn’t really aware of it, except for the smell from the refinery. It was a sulphur smell, like rotten eggs. As for the smell from Ironworks, people said that it was iron dust and they couldn’t dry their clothes outdoors and stuff like that. But you should really ask my Mum. ... I was too little for doing the laundry.\n\n39He also remembered an occasion in a new school he attended after his parents relocated him in 1991 because of the war. It was the comment made at that time by the music teacher when he introduced himself to the new classmates: “‘Oh yeah, I know Sisak. Children, it’s the place where the snow is black in winter.”” And I said, like, ‘no, it fucking isn’t.’ Because it fucking isn’t!”\n\nWhat stands between them?\n\n41However, the political interplay is not conducted on an even field of party-politics. By making a connection between the situation in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and the main concessionaire for hazardous waste management, Ivo expressed a common suspicion, which surfaced in other interviews with members of the initiative and with individual citizens, that the king of waste wielded exceptional power to stifle environmental activism.\n\n43Professional ecological activists in Croatia, as globally, aspire at participating in public policy formation at national and international levels. Even without Petar Pripuz, they would be likely to view local actions as primarily an interplay of “politics, money and pollution.” Moreover, professional activists are concerned that local actions provincialise the fight against pollution and have a “modest reach” and myopic perspective. Because they act at two levels, the global and national ecological activism of degrowth economy and the local action either do not recognise each other or do not cooperate. Although attempting to draw the attention of leading ecological organisations, local action belongs to the realm of localised ecological subjectivity. The accidental nature of their activity results from living in and being inextricably intertwined with the toxic post-industrial landscape. It means that the everyday relationship with the source of pollution – watching it, smelling it or just hearing machines running – is a source of frustration, helplessness, anger and rage, leading to affective action of limited insights and limited reach.\n\nConclusion\n\n44Research into post-industrial cities and communities necessarily entails a journey into their industrial past. In the context of the pollution research that is unfolding in these cities, it is almost impossible not to come across the narrative and circumstances related to the industrial pollution of the past. However, as revealed by the example of Sisak, our interlocutors associated the earlier industrial pollution with jobs, employment and secure livelihood. As they explained, the pollution that is going on in Sisak today is the result of the lack of jobs, industry and employment. Sisak has become a peripheral disposal site for hazardous waste, the “waste yard” of nearby Zagreb and a potentially toxic living area.\n\n45In our article, we focused on a group of Siscian women who actively and publicly tried to articulate that threat, shown primarily as their fear for themselves and their families in the future. We called them bearers of accidental environmentalism because they joined up and directed their activities at a specific environmental problem in the community. At the same time, they were ill-equipped for local politics, not connected with national experts in environmental protection and have not joined environmental coalitions. Actually, they have not perceived themselves as ecological activists at all. Our description of these accidental activists who recognised that waste management is no less threatening than industrial pollution is completed by the equally critical insights of an environmental expert, a local female entrepreneur and a local artist. These three individuals have been exceptionally interested in environmental issues, but have taken a different approach to the pollution and waste industry issues. Advocating a sustainable development and green economy, they have departed from raising questions based on fear and danger and focused on political decision-making on the waste industry, deliberated on green economy aspects and advocated environmental justice.\n\n46In Sisak, accidental activism and local professional activists do recognise each other, but their association and mutual cooperation has still been limited. All the while, a somewhat eerie transformation of the city unfolds."
