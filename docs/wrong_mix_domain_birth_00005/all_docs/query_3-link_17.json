Beyond the powerhouse vocals and chart-topping hits, here are ten facts that showcase the uniqueness of the iconic Mary J. Blige.\n\nBronx Roots: Mary Jane Blige was born on January 11, 1971, in The Bronx, New York. Her upbringing in the heart of the hip-hop scene played a significant role in shaping her musical style and persona. She also called Richmond Hill, Georgia her home for a time, ultimately returning to New York.\n\nFirst Hip-Hop Soul Artist: Mary J.

Her rise to fame is a testament to her resilience and determination to overcome adversity.\n\nAcademy Award Nominee: Mary J. Blige made history as the first person to be nominated for both a performance and an original song in the same year at the Academy Awards. This recognition came in 2018 for her role in the film “Mudbound” and the song “Mighty River.”\n\nMethod Acting: In preparation for her role in “Mudbound,” Mary J. Blige immersed herself in the character by wearing little to no makeup and spending time on a farm. Her commitment to method acting added authenticity to her portrayal.\n\nEntrepreneur: Mary is not just a musical icon; she is also an entrepreneur. She launched her own sunglasses line, Melodies by MJB, reflecting her bold and stylish personal aesthetic, as well as Sun Goddess Wines, “an exclusive collection of limited-edition wines.”\n\nRecognized in Academia: In 2010, she received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, recognizing her contributions to the music industry.\n\nSupport for Women: Mary is a vocal advocate for women’s empowerment. She founded the Mary J. Blige and Steve Stoute Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now (FFAWN) to support and empower women in need.\n\nDual Grammy Wins: Mary J. Blige made history at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards in 2008 by winning both Best R&B Album and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. Her album “Growing Pains” and the single “Just Fine” earned her these prestigious honors.\n\nStage Actress Extraordinaire: Not only has Mary J. Blige conquered the silver screen, but she has also showcased her talents on the stage.
