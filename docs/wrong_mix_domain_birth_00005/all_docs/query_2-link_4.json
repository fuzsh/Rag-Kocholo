        "text": "NEW YORK â June marks Black Music Month and a local star is in the spotlight.\n\nThe life of Bronx-born singer Mary J. Blige has been on display for the world to witness over her more than 30-year career. That means her successes and her failures have been well documented. Sharing her pain in her music has helped to make Blige a superstar.\n\n\"'My Life' was probably my darkest album, like one of the darkest times I have had,\" Blige said in her Amazon Prime video documentary, which debuts Friday. \"Most of the time I was just depressed and didn't want to live.\"\n\nTitled, âMary J. Bligeâs My Life,â itâs about the making of her 1994 album, âMy Life.â\n\n\"There are so many people in this documentary explaining what this album did for them,â said Blige. \"Fans are in groups talking about how it helped them to become better people and save their lives.\"\n\nSuccessfully combining the hip-hop flavor of the 1980s and 90s and the gritty soul sound of the 60s and 70s, Mary J. Blige quickly became know as the queen of hip-hop soul in the 1990s.\n\nSharing her lifeâs story of trials and tribulations makes her extremely relatable and loved by her fans.\n\nNo personal topic seems untouchable. From a tough childhood, to her adult battles with abuse, depression and addiction, the music has it all and so does the documentary.\n\n\"You get it from the horse's mouth and instead of on paper from a reporter,â Blige said while laughing.\n\nâThere are so many songs that define me because they are all pretty much about me,\" she added.\n\nSongs like, âWhatâs the 411?\" âNo More Drama,â and âTake Me As I Am.â\n\nBlige has earned multiple honors and awards, including nine Grammys. The singer and songwriter also has the acting bug with two Academy Award nominations and two Golden Globe nominations.\n\nIf thereâs more drama to come in the singerâs life, weâre sure to hear about it in her music.\n\n------"
