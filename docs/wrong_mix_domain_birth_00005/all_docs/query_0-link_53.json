        "text": "Born\n\nNovember 8th, 1949\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"Nick of Time,\" \"I Can't Make You Love Me,\" \"Angel from Montgomery,\" \"Love Me Like a Man\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nNorah Jones, Sheryl Crow, the Dixie Chicks\n\n\"For many years, I couldn't stand listening to my own voice,\" says Bonnie Raitt. \"Not enough gravitas or experience to convey the depth of emotion I wanted to express.\" But Raitt would become a blues force all her own on songs such as the ferocious \"Love Me Like a Man\" from 1972, combining influences ranging from Ray Charles and Joan Baez to Muddy Waters, as well as her father, John Raitt, a star of Broadway musicals. By the time of 1989's Nick of Time and 1991's Luck of the Draw, she had grown into her vocal ambitions, most obviously in her heart-rending delivery of ballads such as \"I Can't Make You Love Me.\" \"I've never been one to think about how to sing,\" says Raitt. \"Once I start, I'm just living it. I prefer to just let 'er rip.\"\n\nBorn\n\nSeptember 12th, 1931\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\" \"She Thnks I Still Care,\" \"(We're Not) The Jet Set\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nGarth Brooks, Elvis Costello, Alan Jackson\n\nGeorge Jones doesn't sound like he was\n\nInfluenced by any other singer: He sounds like a steel guitar. It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them and comes off them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. The dynamic of it is very tight and really controlled — it's like carving with the voice.\n\nHe has had a huge effect on all of country music — you can hear a direct line from him to Buck Owens to Randy Travis to George Strait. The Beatles listened to Buck Owens and his Buckaroos, and I think through them, George Jones' sound informed McCartney's style — McCartney had that George Jones swoop, as I call it.\n\nThe first time I heard George was on a copy of his greatest hits. I was already familiar with Hank Williams and Porter Wagoner, but not George and his West Texas thing. I was amazed at what he was doing with his voice. Since then, I've covered a couple of my favorites — \"Why Baby Why\" and \"She Thinks I Still Care\" — and I wrote a song called \"Bartender's Blues,\" where I tried to sound as much like George as I could. And then he recorded it himself! It was one of those things where it all comes around.\n\nBorn\n\nNovember 17th, 1966 (died May 29th, 1997)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"Mojo Pin,\" \"Last Goodbye,\" \"Hallelujah\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nChris Martin, Damien Rice, Rufus Wainwright\n\nHearing Jeff's Live at Sin-é EP was one of those moments that happens only a few times in your life as a music fan — it was something otherworldly, and he shocked me with the depth of talent he displayed. I can't compare his voice to anything — he had such an unusual breadth of influences, from Sonic Youth to Edith Piaf. Jeff and I became friends, and when we performed together, I would watch him and try to figure out things — like, \"How is it possible that he's holding that note that long?\"\n\nBut you can talk all day about technical aspects, and you get nowhere. Jeff had the ability to sing a cappella in almost a whisper in a packed club environment and be able to hear a pin drop — that's not about technical ability, that's something else.\n\nThere was an almost punk-rock tenacity to the way he would force you to listen to the effeminate side of his voice. I saw shows with a room full of guys wearing flannel shirts, and he would bring a song down to him singing vocal runs a cappella. He would keep doing it to the point that it was beyond discomfort for these guys who were all standing there trying to be tough. You would be uncomfortable for so long that you would then have this rejuvenation and discovery that this guy was fearless. Listening to him sing — it's one of those indications that the human race isn't all bad and life is worth living and there is beauty and brilliance in humanity.\n\nBorn\n\nMay 106th, 1960\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"One,\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" \"Beautiful Day\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nEddie Vedder, Chris Martin, Thom Yorke\n\nI would describe Bono's singing as 50 percent Guinness, 10 percent cigarettes — and the rest is religion. He's a physical singer, like the leader of a gospel choir, and he gets lost in the melodic moment. He goes to a place outside himself, especially in front of an audience, when he hits those high notes. That's where his real power comes from — the pure, unadulterated Bono. He talks about things he believes in, whether it's world economics or AIDS relief in Africa. But the voice always comes first. That's where his conviction lies.\n\nHe has so many influences. You hear Joe Strummer, Bob Marley, Otis Redding, Elvis Presley, even John Lennon. And he has the same range as Robert Plant. It's amazing, the notes he has to go through in the first lines of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday.\" But it's filtered through this Irish choirboy. The Joshua Tree shows the mastery Bono has over his voice and what he learned from punk, New Wave and American musicians like Bob Dylan. In the quiet moments of \"With or Without You,\" you can imagine him sitting under the stars. Then, when he comes back to the chorus, all of a sudden it's a hailstorm.\n\nA lot of Bono's free-form singing comes from the band's rhythms and the church-bell feeling of the Edge's playing, the way the guitar sings in that delay. Bono can glide vocally through all of that. But it's very natural. And he's not afraid to go beyond what he's capable of, into something bizarre like his falsetto in \"Lemon.\" In \"Kite,\" on All That You Can't Leave Behind, he belts it out like he's crying with joy.\n\nI never had the feeling he was manipulating the power of his voice to show off. They say a submarine never goes in reverse. That's Bono, always looking for a new way of singing something. That's one thing I learned from him: Never rest. Keep learning and be a good listener. That's the spirit of singing — and he definitely has it.\n\nBorn\n\nAugust 29th, 1958\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"I Want You Back\" (the Jackson 5), \"Billie Jean,\" \"Man in the Mirror\" (solo)\n\nInfluenced\n\nJustin Timberlake, Chris Brown, Usher\n\nMichael Jackson is a perfect storm of innate talent and training. His singing as a child is astounding: He just nailed \"I Want You Back\" — there's maybe one bum note on that song, which is crazy to me, because he was only 11 years old.\n\nOne of the key elements of his style is how he uses his voice as an instrument. His signature grunts — \"ugh,\" \"ah\" and all that — are rhythmic things that guitar players or drummers usually do. He's one of the most rhythmic singers ever — Prince emulated James Brown a lot more, but Michael Jackson approximated it more naturally.\n\nAnd he has insane range. I can sing pretty high, but I had to drop \"Beat It\" a half step when I sang it. He sings this incredibly high note — I think it's a high C or even a high C-sharp, which no one can hit — on \"Beat It,\" as well as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Thriller.\" What people don't realize is that he can go pretty deep too. You hear that on \"Burn This Disco Out,\" on Off the Wall — he goes deep into his range, which blows me away.\n\nWhen somebody gets as big as he did, you lose sight of how avant-garde and revolutionary they are, but Michael Jackson pushed the boundaries of pop and R&B. Think about it: On \"Beat It,\" you had an R&B singer doing a full-on rock song with Eddie Van Halen. Or the intro on \"Man in the Mirror\": He's got this reverb in his voice, and any time he goes \"uh!\" it goes for miles. To me, that's up there with some Brian Eno shit. That's how far out there it is.\n\nBorn\n\nFebruary 6th, 1945 (died May 11th, 1981)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"No Woman, No Cry,\" \"Redemption Song,\" \"I Shot the Sheriff\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nBono, Lauryn Hill, Buju Banton\n\nTo talk only about Bob Marley's singing voice would negate what makes him one of the greatest voices of our time — why his voice is stamped in our history. He sang about heavy ideas, and he put them out there so delicately and so lightly, with such a generous groove, a generous feel and a generous voice. He didn't sing correctly; he wasn't trained, but he had a beautiful voice, a lot like one of my other favorite singers of all time, Marvin Gaye. If they had more similar accents and had sung in more similar styles, you'd hear it.\n\nIt's hard to separate his voice from what he was singing about. Bob Marley sang with a great deal of power — enough to shake the foundations of his country's government. A measure of a great singer is getting a message across, saying things that otherwise won't be heard. And in a world that has ways of shutting down people that talk about peace and love, Bob Marley could get that message across and inspire us. It's rare that something so serious and so beautiful as his music can rise as clearly to the top as he did. His voice is one of the most important inspirations of our time — he was the voice of oppressed people all over the world.\n\nBorn July 26th, 1943\n\nKey Tracks \"Gimme Shelter,\" \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"Satisfaction\"\n\nInfluenced Jack White, Steven Tyler, Iggy Pop\n\nI sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. But what he does is so complex: His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection. There are certain songs where he just becomes a different person. Take \"Angie\": I've never heard that tone from him since, and it wasn't there before. And I love when he sings falsetto, like on \"Emotional Rescue\" or \"Fool to Cry.\"\n\nI like him best when he's singing super-raw. When I co-produced \"God Gave Me Everything\" [for Goddess in the Doorway], he did what he thought would be a scratch vocal. He barely knew the lyric — he was reading off a piece of paper. There were no stops, just one take. Bam! It ended up being the vocal we used on the record.\n\nMick is a disciplined artist, completely dedicated to his craft. His voice has changed somewhat and has a different texture, but it's stronger now. One time the Stones were on tour, and during a two-week break Mick and I went on vacation in the Bahamas. We'd hang out during the day, go to the beach, shop at the market, cook dinner, drink wine. In the evening he would go to the bottom floor of the place where we were staying and put on a Rolling Stones soundcheck tape — just the band playing songs without him singing. He would stay down there, dancing and singing to keep himself in shape. Your voice is like a muscle. If you're on the road and you stop for two weeks and then go back to do a show, you're going to get hoarse. So he was down there every night practicing. As a result, at 65 years of age, he's stronger than ever.\n\nThe beauty of that experience was sitting in a living room hearing \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Satisfaction\" live through the floor. That was my entertainment every night. It was very surreal.\n\nBorn May 3rd, 1933 (died December 25th, 2006)\n\nKey Tracks \"I Got You (I Feel Good),\" \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" \"The Payback,\" \"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\"\n\nInfluenced Michael Jackson, Sly Stone, Prince, George Clinton\n\nFor me, James Brown was never just the voice. It was the whole package. But the impact of that voice gave me hope, because it was a simple presentation and didn't trade on range. And there was that scream. It was like an inner voice. It sounded like an assertion of rights of primitive man: \"I am alive, and I can do things.\" He used to describe his dancing as \"African nerve control.\" He had a point.\n\nIf you go back to his early recordings, he was trying to sing standards. He didn't quite have what it took. The first time I heard him was on Live at the Apollo, from a few years later. I was working at a record store. Apollo has still got a lot of formal songs on it — \"Try Me,\" \"Lost Someone.\" But what really blew my mind and influenced my thinking was the continuity of the performance. You have the long introduction and the incredibly detailed entrance music. And when James comes in, he does a lot of holding back, with dynamic effect, loud and soft. In \"Lost Someone,\" there's this opiate repetition where the band is going back and forth on two chords, and he's saying, \"I'll love you tomorrow,\" on and on. Then all of a sudden, he goes, \"Uh!\" He whacks you, and the band replies. Nothing is casual, but it doesn't sound forced or straitjacketed.\n\nHe was a terrific editor. The one that flipped me out — I still remember being in the car, hearing it — is \"I Can't Stand It.\" He was down to fuck the chorus, fuck the melody. This is barely a riff. But he pushes the group along like the coxswain on a Roman galley: Stroke, motherfucker, uh!\n\nHe always has an edge in his ballads where he lets you know it's real. There's a lesser-known one called \"Mama's Dead,\" from Black Caesar. It just kills me. At the end, after he's sung all these heavy things, he just says, \"Everybody got a mother, and you know what I'm talkin' about.\" Or in the chorus of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" — a lesser artist would say, \"It wouldn't mean nothin' without a woman.\" Or \"without a girl.\" But they wouldn't say both. And it's not just a lyric. He is singing something primitive and basic. He tells you how society runs. Man makes this, this is how money works. Maybe that comes from being somebody who didn't have many things when he started out. The part in his autobiography that always gets me is when he lived with his dad, tapping the pine trees for rosin. You're down to real poverty.\n\nThe big thing I got from him was, don't just stand there and look at your shoe. Fuck that. It had to be like something's going on here. He always sounds like he's breaking loose. Once you've made the decision to go out in front of people and start moving around, it frees up so many things. You're now creating movement in a society that's based on order. And within yourself, you feel different. That motion makes you make decisions as a vocalist, decisions that free you from the stilted stuff.\n\nIn those situations, music has a cathartic power, and the guys who do it, they know that. That's why James Brown could call himself Soul Brother Number One — and nobody ever said he was bragging.\n\nBorn\n\nMay 13th, 1950\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"Superstition,\" \"Sir Duke,\" \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nDonny Hathaway, Maxwell, Adam Levine\n\nTo me, Stevie Wonder's voice always sounds like tears of joy — like he's right on the verge of crying, but it's out of glee and peace, as opposed to the pain of someone like a Sly Stone.\n\nThere's a richness to his voice, a clarity to all of its inflections. That vibrato is so impactful and piercing, but he never loses that underlying straightforward singing voice. His lack of sight must heighten his other senses, his ability to imagine and feel. It makes his music very visual, very graphic.\n\nThe first time I remember hearing Stevie Wonder was when I heard him singing \"Fingertips,\" in the movie Cooley High. I was in awe of this child's ability to see himself so clearly and be so sure of himself so young. Then I had to go back and discover Stevie Wonder as a whole. My uncle had an album collection, so I had seen Talking Book and Innervisions, but I knew the covers before I knew the music. I got turned on to his amazing performances like \"Superwoman,\" \"I Ain't Gonna Stand for It\" and, of course, \"Ribbon in the Sky\" — that song is so simple, but it's so significant. His voice has so much variation and such diversity.\n\nHis confidence and his sense of self are just supernatural. Stevie Wonder knows exactly who he is, what role and responsibility he's been given. But he revels in being chosen, singled out, and that's what makes him who he is. He's like a miracle.\n\nBorn\n\nSeptember 9th, 1941 (died December 10th, 1967)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,\" \"These Arms of Mine,\" \"Try a Little Tenderness\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nAl Green, Toots Hibbert, Chris Robinson\n\nThe first time i saw Otis, i had no idea who he was. It was on the sidewalk at 926 East McLemore Avenue in Memphis, which was Stax Rec-ords. This guy was unloading equipment and suitcases from a station wagon, taking it into the studio. He was a driver for the singer Johnny Jenkins. I didn't see him much the rest of the day until later, when he asked for his audition. He sang \"These Arms of Mine.\" It was in B-flat.\n\nIt didn't seem like an audition at all. It was a performance. It wasn't the size of his voice — we knew lots of people with vocal powers like that. It was the intent with which he sang. He was all emotion. It was like, \"This guy is definitely not singing for the money.\" I don't think he ever did.\n\nRange was not a factor in his singing. His range was somewhat limited. He had no really low notes and no really high notes. But Otis would do anything that implied emotion, and that's where his physicality came in, because he was such a strong, powerful man. Backstage, he would be like a prizefighter waiting to get out there. Playing \"Respect\" live with him was just energy and relentless joy.\n\nWithout singing, Otis was more distracted, not sure of himself. He couldn't make the same movements in the studio when he sang. He was more restricted. You got the impression, though. He would do that thing where he stomped the left foot, then the right. And we all played with more intensity around him. He had that magnetism — \"I'm a man!\" — and he knew it, too. \"These Arms of Mine\" is still Otis' signature song for me. It is so simple in its beauty and message. Here is a young man singing to a girl: \"If you would even consider being with me, how happy I would be.\" That's such a basic emotion. That's how he sang it, and that's what got him over.\n\nBorn\n\nMay 24th, 1941\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"Like a Rolling Stone,\" \"Lay Lady Lay,\" \"Visions of Johanna\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nJohn Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith, Conor Oberst\n\nBob Dylan did what very, very few singers ever do. He changed popular singing. And we have been living in a world shaped by Dylan's singing ever since. Almost no one sings like Elvis Presley anymore. Hundreds try to sing like Dylan. When Sam Cooke played Dylan for the young Bobby Womack, Womack said he didn't understand it. Cooke explained that from now on, it's not going to be about how pretty the voice is. It's going to be about believing that the voice is telling the truth.\n\nTo understand Bob Dylan's impact as a singer, you have to imagine a world without Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, Kurt Cobain, Lucinda Williams or any other vocalist with a cracked voice, dirt-bowl yelp or bluesy street howl. It is a vast list, but so were the influences on Dylan, from the Talmudic chanting of Allen Ginsberg in \"Howl\" to the deadpan Woody Guthrie and Lefty Frizzell's murmur. There is certainly iron ore in there, and the bitter cold of Hibbing, Minnesota, blowing through that voice. It's like a knotted fist, and it allows Dylan to sing the most melancholy tunes and not succumb to sentimentality. What's interesting is that later, as he gets older, the fist opens up, to a vulnerability. I have heard him sing versions of \"Idiot Wind\" where he was definitely the idiot.\n\nI first heard Bob Dylan's voice in the dark, when I was 13 years old, on my friend's record player. It was his greatest-hits album, the first one. The voice was at once modern, in all the things it was railing against, and very ancient. It felt strangely familiar to an Irishman. We thought America was full of superheroes, but it was a much humbler people in these songs — farmers, people who have had great injustices done to them. The really unusual thing about Bob Dylan was that, for a moment in the Sixties, he felt like the future. He was the Voice of a Generation, raised against the generation that came before. Then he became the voice of all the generations, the voices in the ground — these ghosts from the Thirties and the Dust Bowl, the romance of Gershwin and the music hall. For me, the pictures of him in his polka-dot shirt, the Afro and pointy shoes — that was a brief flash of lightning. His voice is usually put to the service of more ancient characters.\n\nHere are some of the adjectives I have found myself using to describe that voice: howling, seducing, raging, indignant, jeering, imploring, begging, hectoring, confessing, keening, wailing, soothing, conversational, crooning. It is a voice like smoke, from cigar to incense, where it's full of wonder and worship. There is a voice for every Dylan you can meet, and the reason I'm never bored of Bob Dylan is because there are so many of them, all centered on the idea of pilgrimage. People forget that Bob Dylan had to warm up for Dr. King before he made his great \"I have a dream\" speech — the preacher preceded by the pilgrim. Dylan has tried out so many personas in his singing because it is the way he inhabits his subject matter. His closet won't close for all the shoes of the characters that walk through his stories.\n\nI love that album Shot of Love. There's no production. You're in a room hearing him sing. And I like a lot of the songs that he worked on with Daniel Lanois — \"Series of Dreams,\" \"Most of the Time,\" \"Dignity.\" That is the period where he moves me most. The voice becomes the words. There is no performing, just life — as Yeats says, when the dancer becomes the dance.\n\nDylan did with singing what Brando did with acting. He busted through the artifice to get to the art. Both of them tore down the prissy rules laid down by the schoolmarms of their craft, broke through the fourth wall, got in the audience's face and said, \"I dare you to think I'm kidding.\"\n\nBorn\n\nApril 2nd, 1939 (died April 1st, 1984)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"What's Going On,\" \"Let's Get It On,\" \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nD'Angelo, R. Kelly, Usher\n\nThere's no sound like Marvin Gaye: the way he sang so softly, almost gently — but also with so much power. That came straight from the heart. Everything in his life — everything that he thought and felt — affected his singing.\n\nThe first time I was really introduced to Marvin Gaye was the What's Going On album, and I fell in love. It was so moving to hear him talk so desperately about the state of the world, on top of all that brilliant musicality. One of my favorite things he did was to follow the strings with his voice, or double things that the instruments are doing. There's such a simple, subtle lushness to it that adds this whole other layer to the music.\n\nThese days we have Pro Tools and a thousand tracks, and you can do different vocals on every track. But back then you really had to innovate, like the way Marvin answered himself in songs, or all that really distant backing work, where his voice is all the way in the back and echoing. It's haunting; he delivered every single song with such clarity that it gave me chills.\n\nThe live version of \"Distant Lover\" has to be one of the most incredible performances ever captured on tape. You can feel his confidence, his yearning — you can imagine his movements. The entire audience is hanging on his every word; he's teasing them the whole time. That's what makes Marvin Gaye immortal: the emotion that he evokes. What's Going On changed my whole world — my life, my songwriting style, everything.\n\nBorn\n\nOctober 9th, 1940 (died December 8th, 1980)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"I Feel Fine,\" \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" \"Imagine,\" \"Instant Karma\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nBono, Neil Young, Liam Gallagher\n\nThere was a tremendous intimacy in everything John Lennon did, combined with a formidable intellect. That is what makes him a great singer. In \"Girl,\" on Rubber Soul, he starts in this steely, high voice: \"Is there anybody going to listen to my story. . . .\" It's so impassioned, like somebody stepping from the shadows in a room. But when he comes to the chorus, you suddenly realize: He's talking directly to her. When I heard this, as a young teenager, it hit the nail on the head. It embodied the feelings I was living with every day — completely burning with sexual desire, with almost a regret at being so overpowered.\n\nHe had a confidence, a certainty about what he was feeling that carried over into everything he sang. One of the things about John Lennon and the Beatles that went by a lot of people was how unusual it was for people in their class, from Liverpool, to be catapulted into the higher reaches of entertainment and society, without disguising their working-class roots and voices. It was such an audacious thing to do, not to change who they were. That was the heart of John Lennon's singing — to say who he was and where he was from.\n\nHe didn't sing very loud. I got that sense when I was learning \"Oh My Love,\" on Imagine. That song has to be done quietly, which turns out to be a feat of strength. It's ironic — to sing high and quiet, you have to be physically strong. In \"I'm Only Sleeping,\" on Revolver, he sounds sleepy, like he's half in bed as he sings. Or \"I'm So Tired,\" on the White Album — there is an irritableness to it. These songs live in you because of the remarkable facility of the singer to inhabit those moments and portray them. \"Imagine\" is a masterful performance. He inhabits that idea — our innermost longing for a world in which peace is real — when he sings it. And it is sung with fearlessness, without erring on either side — polemic or sappy. It's wonderful to have an idea expressed so well that everybody can sing it. That's a song he made you want to sing.\n\nThe more he developed as a writer, he was able to show his voice in various contexts. There is a thrilling aloneness in the way he sings \"A Day in the Life.\" His singing on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is to the bone. He willed himself to express his pain: \"Mother/You had me/But I never had you.\" It's a crushing depiction that stays with you forever. Double Fantasy is less tortured — there is a lot of happiness there. The singing is just beautiful, perhaps more the product of singing at home, to his son. John Lennon went through a lot to have the life he had. He gave up some things to get others. And he died before a lot of those themes could be examined.\n\nBut it was a stunning thing — he always told the truth. He felt he had the right to talk about this stuff, and that gives his voice a singular identity. It's not the chops of a heralded singer — no one goes on about his actual technique. He went right to what he felt, what he had to say.\n\nBorn\n\nJanuary 22nd, 1931 (died December 11th, 1964)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" \"Bring It on Home to Me,\" \"You Send Me\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nOtis Redding, Art Garfunkel, Rod Stewart\n\nIf a singer is not singing from the soul, I do not even want to listen to it — it's not for me.\n\nSam Cooke reached down deep with pure soul. He had the rare ability to do gospel the way it's supposed to be — he made it real, clean, direct. Gospel drove Sam Cooke through his greatest songs, the same way it did for Ray Charles, who came first, and Otis Redding.\n\nHe had an incomparable voice. Sam Cooke could sing anything and make it work. But when you're talking about his strength as a singer, range is not relevant. It was his power to deliver — it was about his phrasing, the totality of his singing.\n\nHe did a lot of great songs, but \"Bring It on Home to Me\" is a favorite. It's just a well-crafted song with a great lyric and melody. It's a song that's written to allow you to go wherever you can with it. \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" is another song I covered; it's a great arrangement.\n\nNot many people can play this music anymore, not the way Sam Cooke did it, coming directly from the church. What can we learn from a singer like him, from listening to songs like \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"? It depends on who the singer is and what they are capable of, where their head is and how serious they are. But Sam Cooke was born to sing.\n\nBorn\n\nJanuary 8th, 1935 (died August 16th, 1977)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n\"Mystery Train,\" \"Hound Dog,\" \"Suspicious Minds\"\n\nInfluenced\n\nBono, Bruce Springsteen\n\nThere is a difference between people who sing and those who take that voice to another, otherworldly place, who create a euphoria within themselves. It's transfiguration. I know about that. And having met Elvis, I know he was a transformer.\n\nThe first Elvis song I heard was \"Hound Dog.\" I wasn't equipped with any of the knowledge I have now, about the Big Mama Thornton version or where all that swing was coming from. I just heard this voice, and it was absolutely, totally in its own place. The voice was confident, insinuating and taking no prisoners. He had those great whoops and diving moments, those sustains that swoop down to the note like a bird of prey. I took all that in. You can hear that all over Led Zeppelin.\n\nWhen I met Elvis with Zeppelin, after one of his concerts in the early Seventies, I sized him up. He wasn't quite as tall as me. But he had a singer's build. He had a good chest — that resonator. And he was driven. \"Anyway You Want Me\" is one of the most moving vocal performances I've ever heard. There is no touching \"Jailhouse Rock\" and the stuff recorded at the King Creole sessions. I can study the Sun sessions as a middle-aged guy looking back at a bloke's career and go, \"Wow, what a great way to start.\" But I liked the modernity of the RCA stuff. \"I Need Your Love Tonight\" and \"A Big Hunk o' Love\" were so powerful — those sessions sounded like the greatest place to be on the planet.\n\nAt that meeting, Jimmy Page joked with Elvis that we never soundchecked — but if we did, all I wanted to do was sing Elvis songs. Elvis thought that was funny and asked me, \"Which songs do you sing?\" I told him I liked the ones with all the moods, like that great country song \"Love Me\" — \"Treat me like a fool/Treat me mean and cruel/But love me.\" So when we were leaving, after a most illuminating and funny 90 minutes with the guy, I was walking down the corridor. He swung 'round the door frame, looking quite pleased with himself, and started singing that song: \"Treat me like a fool. . . .\" I turned around and did Elvis right back at him. We stood there, singing to each other.\n\nBy then, because of the forces around him, it was difficult for him to stretch out with more contemporary songwriters. When he died, he was 42. I'm 18 years older than that now. But he didn't have many fresh liaisons to draw on — his old pals weren't going to bring him the new gospel. I know he wanted to express more. But what he did was he made it possible for me, as a singer, to become otherworldly.\n\nBorn\n\nSeptember 23rd, 1930 (died June 10th, 2004)\n\nKey Tracks\n\n“What’d I Say, Pts. 1 & 2,” “I Got a Woman,” “You Don’t Know Me,” “Georgia on My Mind”\n\nInfluenced\n\nVan Morrison, Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder\n\nRay Charles had the most unique voice in popular music. He would do these improvisational things, a little laugh or a “Huh-hey!” It was as if something struck him as he was singing and he just had to react to it. He was getting a kick out of what he was doing. And his joy was infectious.\n\nBut there was something else I didn’t realize until we sang together in the Eighties, on my song “Baby Grand.” When he sings, he’s not just singing soulfully. He is imparting his soul. You are hearing something deep within the man. I thought it would just turn me into this little nerd from Levittown, New York. But it didn’t. It emboldened me. It was like an evangelical event. He was the minister and I was the congregation. I got all fired up.\n\nRay started out wanting to be Nat “King” Cole. When Nat went down low in a song, like “Mona Lisa,” there was a growl in there that was kind of sexy. Ray took that to a whole other level. He took the growl and turned it into singing. He took the yelp, the whoop, the grunt, the groan, and made them music.\n\nAlso, he was a piano player. The piano is a percussion instrument. You put your body into it. Ray had a lot of unique body movements I didn’t know until I saw him. Before I saw him, I heard those movements as he sang. I heard his shoulder go up a little on the left side, the way he lifted himself off the stool. Then I realized the voice I was hearing was also playing that piano.\n\nThe first Ray Charles I heard was Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. He’d had hits before that, the R&B stuff, like “What’d I Say.” But here is a black man giving you the whitest possible music in the blackest possible way, while all hell is breaking loose with the civil rights movement. When he sang “You Don’t Know Me,” I thought, “He isn’t just singing the lyrics. He’s saying, ‘You don’t know me. Get to know me.’ “\n\nHe could be very sly with a song. His 1972 version of “America the Beautiful” is an iconic recording. There was so much feeling in his performance. It was his way of saying, “This is my country too. We gave you your popular music. This was ours before it was yours.”\n\nBut Ray synthesized the blues into a language everybody could relate to. You can’t listen to Ray Charles and not say, “This is a man who felt deeply, who has lived this music.” He shows you his humanity. The spontaneity is evident. Another guy might say, “That was a mistake, we can’t leave that in.” No, Ray left it in. The mistake became the hook.\n\nBorn March 25th, 1942\n\nKey Tracks “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “Respect,” “I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You),” “Think,” “Chain of Fools”\n\nInfluenced Whitney Houston, Alicia Keys, Aaron Neville, Annie Lennox\n\nYou know a force from heaven. You know something that God made. And Aretha is a gift from God. When it comes to expressing yourself through song, there is no one who can touch her. She is the reason why women want to sing.\n\nAretha has everything — the power, the technique. She is honest with everything she says. Everything she’s thinking or dealing with is all in the music, from “Chain of Fools” to “Respect” to her live performances. And she has total confidence; she does not waver at all. I think her gospel base brings that confidence, because in gospel they do not play around — they’re all about chops, who has the vocal runs. This is no game to her.\n\nAs a child, I used to listen to Aretha’s music because my mom played “Do Right Woman” and “Ain’t No Way” every single day. I would see my mother cry when she listened to those songs, and I’d cry too. Then I discovered her on my own with the Sparkle soundtrack. I must have played “Giving Him Something He Can Feel” 30 times in a row; eventually, I connected the dots to that voice my mom was listening to.\n\nEven the way she pronounces words is amazing: In “Giving Him Something He Can Feel,” when she sings, “Many say that I’m too young” — the way she says “I’m,” you can almost see her saying it, like she’s all in your face, but you’re still right with her. You can really visualize her hands when she sings, “You’re tying both of my hands,” on “Ain’t No Way” — it’s the powerful way she hits the word “both.”\n\nWhen you watch her work, you can see why Aretha is who she is. When we did the song “Don’t Waste Your Time” on my album Mary, she just went in there and ate that record like Pac-Man. She could be doing a church vocal run, and it would turn into some jazz-space thing, something I never encountered before. You’d say, “Where did that come from? Where did she find that note?”\n\nIt’s beautiful to see, because it helps people with a lack of confidence in their ability, like myself. I look at her and think, “I need a piece of that. Whatever that is.” —Mary J. Blige"
