        "text": "Mary Jane Blige (born January 11, 1971) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. She is often referred to as The Queen of Hip Hop Soul, due to her music mainly being R&B mixed with hip hop and soul. She has released 11 studio albums, 82 singles, and 8 other albums.\n\nIn 1988, Blige recorded an cover of Anita Baker's \"Caught Up in the Rapture\" at a recording booth in a local mall. Her mother's boyfriend at the time played the cassette for Jeff Redd, a recording artist and A&R runner for Uptown Records. Redd then sent it to the president and CEO of the label, Andre Harrell. Harrell met with Blige and, in 1989, she joined the label, becoming the company's youngest and first female artist.\n\nProduction for Blige's first album, Whats the 411?, began in 1991. Sean \"Puffy\" Combs (at the time a beginning A&R executive at Uptown) organised the project. Also enlisted were some of the top R&B and hip hop producers of the time, among them are Tony Dofat, Mark Morales and Cory Rooney, Dave \"Jam\" Hall, and DeVante Swing.\n\nIn 2014, Blige toured with R. Kelly called \"The King and Queen Tour\".[2]\n\nBlige is a Democrat.[3]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2001 Prison Song Mrs. Butler Movie debut 2009 I Can Do Bad All By Myself Tanya 2012 Rock of Ages Justice Charlier 2013 Black Nativity Platinum Fro Nominated — American Black Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast 2017 Mudbound Florence Jackson Gotham Special Jury Award for Best Ensemble Performance\n\nNew York Film Critics Online for Best Ensemble Cast\n\nIndieWire Critic's Poll Award for Best Breakthrough Performance (Film)\n\nHollywood Film Awards – Breakout Actress Award\n\nHollywood Film Awards – Breakout Ensemble Award\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress (Runner-up)\n\nNominated — Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nNominated — Academy Award for Best Original Song\n\nNominated — Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nNominated — Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n\nNominated — Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nNominated — Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Acting Ensemble\n\nNominated — Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture\n\nNominated — Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song\n\nNominated — Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor\n\nNominated — Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture\n\nNominated — Washington D.C.
