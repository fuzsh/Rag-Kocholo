        "text": "Mary J. Blige’s sound implements hip-hop, soul, R&B, and gospel in a unique way. A trailblazer in the ’90s and ’00s, she’s known as the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. With a career spanning nearly three decades, she has won nine Grammy awards (nominated for 37), won an Emmy, and has been nominated for two Oscars.\n\nA recurring theme in Mary’s music is being very vulnerable and expressing pain from toxic romantic relationships. More recently, she sings about how to turn those negative feelings into positive ones. Her Grammy-nominated 14th studio album Good Morning Gorgeous was released in 2022. She spoke to Good Morning America at the time about what the phrase means to her.\n\n“It’s a positive affirmation I had to speak over myself when I was in a really dark situation,” she explained.\n\n“Be Without You,” “No More Drama” and “Real Love” are just some of her anthems about navigating relationships and finding a way to move on. She even got to perform her greatest hits in 2022 on the world’s biggest stage. At the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show, she performed alongside Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, and 50 Cent.\n\nMary J. Blige: Beyond The Music\n\nIn recent years, Mary has successfully delved into acting. She plays Monet in Power Book II: Ghost which was created by fellow hip-hop artist 50 Cent. The Bronx native even plays alongside her “I’ll Be There for You/You’re All I Need to Get By” partner Method Man in the series. The Grammy winner won two Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the NAACP Awards in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn 2018, she was nominated for two Oscars for her work in Mudbound. Being nominated twice in the same year was a feat that had not been done by an African American entertainer prior to her. She also became the first person to be nominated for an Oscar in an acting and music category in the same year.\n\nThe Bronx native has been using her music to uplift her fans for decades. She created the Strength Of A Woman festival as a way to highlight women in the music industry. Mary began the festival in 2022. Whether it’s music, television, or building a lasting legacy, Mary continuously proves why she will always be the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.\n\nTake a look below at 10 of Mary J. Blige’s best songs ranked:"
