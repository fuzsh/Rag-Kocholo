Following tuition at the Suzuki Violin School in London & Matsumoto, Japan, and at the junior department of the Royal College of Music, he went on to read Music at the University of Manchester, where he specialised in contemporary classical & electroacoustic composition, and performance. He was later awarded the Gladys Bratton, Montague Cleeve & TCM Trust scholarships for postgraduate study at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.\n\nSince then he has performed across the world, making solo appearances with the Evergreen Symphony Orchestra in Taiwan, and performing with the Symphony Orchestra of India and Ahmadi Music Group in Kuwait. Closer to home he performs with ensembles including the Multi-Story Orchestra, Charles Hazelwood’s Army of Generals, and the Paradisal Players, with concerts broadcast live on BBC Television and Radio. He has also made solo appearances at St John's Smith Square, the Wigmore Hall and Purcell Room.\n\nA versatile musician, Frederick has toured extensively with the comedy string quartet Graffiti Classics, and has performed with Mary J. Blige and hip hop pioneer Grandmaster Melle Mel. He has collaborated with a diverse range of artists, from tours with Edgar Meyer and Béla Fleck, to recordings with Rick Wakeman and performances with grime artists Merky Ace & Jammer. Frederick also is an experienced jazz musician and improviser, and has performed with the Glenn Miller Orchestra and Outlook Orchestra."
