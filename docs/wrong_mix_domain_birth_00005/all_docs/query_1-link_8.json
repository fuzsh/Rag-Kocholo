        "text": "Blige released her first album, What’s the 411?, in 1992. The album mixed classic soul with hip-hop. It redefined soul music and influenced many other artists.\n\nThrough the 1990s and into the 2000s, Blige’s personal and emotional music continued to be popular with fans and critics. Her albums Share My World (1997) and Growing Pains (2007) earned the number-one spot on the music charts. Blige’s tour in 2008 with rapper Jay-Z made her one of hip-hop’s wealthiest live acts. She went on to win praise for later releases, such as My Life II…The Journey Continues (Act I) (2011) and Strength of a Woman (2017).\n\nBlige found success in acting as well. She appeared on a number of television shows and in such films as Rock of Ages (2012) and Mudbound (2017). Blige earned two Academy Award nominations for her work in Mudbound: one as a supporting actress and one for “Mighty River,” the song she wrote for the film."
