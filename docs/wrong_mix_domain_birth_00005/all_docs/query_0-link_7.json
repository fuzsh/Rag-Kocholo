        "text": "The insurgencies across black America during the 1960s had a soundtrack, and I remember those same songs – “Stand” by Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On?” and “People Get Ready” by Curtis Mayfield – blaring out of the windows of Liverpool 8 before and during the “riots”. But there was another song on the summer breeze in 1981, broadcast everywhere too, including out of my own bedroom windows in Catharine Street at the edge of the riot zone, in the so-called “Piggeries” flats in Everton and even off leafy Lark Lane, behind Sefton Park. A special Liverpool 8 song which would, many years later, become a huge hit for Phil Bailey of Earth, Wind and Fire, Courtney Pine and latterly Mary J Blige.\n\nBut not many people in America (nor many in England either) know that “Children of the Ghetto” was written as part of a trilogy in and about Liverpool 8, on Stanhope Street, which connects Toxteth to the docks. Even fewer know that it was composed by the same band – the Real Thing — that gave the world “You To Me Are Everything” and “Can’t Get By Without You”, to which teenagers have shaken their bones across disco floors around the planet.\n\n“You to Me”, one of the biggest dance hits of all time, goes: “You to me are everything / The sweetest song that I could sing / Oh Baby, Oh Baby … Now you’ve got the best of me / Come on and take the rest of me” – blah blah; it’s terrific. But the Liverpool 8 anthem by the same group, written beforehand in 1975, goes: “Children of the ghetto / Runnin’ wild and free / In the concrete jungle / Filled with misery / There’s no inspiration / To brighten up their day / So out of desperation / I would like to say /Children of the ghetto / Keep your head / To the sky”.\n\nBy the time of the riots, the Real Thing were a phenomenon: one of the very few black British soul bands to achieve world renown – “You To Me” was an instant number one . But before it had been composed, Eddy and Chris Amoo, the brothers at the band’s core, had already written an epic three-part eulogy to Liverpool 8, of which “Children of the Ghetto” was the heart. When it was released after the two disco anthems, says Eddy Amoo now, more in bewilderment than bitterness, “it almost finished us”.\n\nThe mystery, and extraordinary story behind the soundtrack to Liverpool’s uprising unfolds after crossing the threshold of the heart-warming Amoo household in Sefton Park, behind Toxteth, past a fin-de-siecle statue, a giant American Indian dream-catcher and a leaking roof which Amoo’s gracious wife and daughters curse as rain comes through into the vestibule. Eddy arrives indoors from the garden, bare-topped and sodden with rain and sweat after an evidently strenuous workout; he is scarily fit for a man in his 60s. “In my business, it’s essential, it’s survival,” he explains.\n\nA large photograph signed by Paul McCartney in honour of “great times” adorns Amoo’s office wall, and it shows: the Beatles, the famous 1960s Merseyside MP “Battling” Bessie Braddock, the lord and lady mayor of the day and the four members of a doo-wop, a cappella band called the Chants, in which Eddy Amoo sung for 13 years, before joining the band he helped his younger brother Chris form. They say every picture tells a story – but this one tells hundreds.\n\nAmoo grew up, he says, “a kid like any other, sleeping in a cupboard with my brothers. I’m a Liverpool 8 kid from a mixed-race family – my granny was white. We grew up in Tennyson Street, which has been knocked down now, and race was never an issue. I didn’t even know I was black until my mother finally got us a flat in Myrtle Gardens. We were the first black family in Myrtle Gardens, and that’s when I started to be called a nig-nog.” Only, he adds perceptively, “I think I realised that this was not racism so much as that kids are cruel. The boys thought it was cool, or funny, the thing to do. Because pretty soon the same boys were coming round to ask my mum, ‘Is Eddy around?’”\n\nThere was trouble: “It was cool to play catch with a knife,” he recalls. Only one day, just as the blade landed in Eddy’s grasp, “a police Black Maria pulled up. I saw it all in slow motion, and I still can: I looked around, and everyone had gone. ‘You little black bastard,’ said the police officer”. Arrested and charged, Eddy was, he says, “incarcerated in Her Majesty’s – a thing called ‘borstal report’. And in there, everyone was ‘Hey bro, doesn’t matter what you do, you’re here for life, so you might as well have a laugh’. But I thought, ‘Is this going to be my life? Is this it?”\n\nAmoo’s father, living in Bradford, returned to plead with the judge, scold the boy in equal measure, and in doing so secured his son’s release. “That was the moment,” says Amoo, “that I was rescued from going the same way as people I know who did long jail sentences. I got the break, while my friends learned their politics in jail. I teamed up with my mates, and we formed the Chants” — inspired by American R&B and doo-wop music brought into Liverpool by waiters and crewmen aboard Cunard liners, and US airmen based nearby.\n\nYoung Eddy would go to the Rialto, a dance hall at the junction of Prince’s Avenue and Upper Parliament Street, where “it wasn’t cool to arrive too early with your gang” – until one night when “it was already packed out early, with this new crowd of people with long hair. I asked who was playing, and my mates said it was a band with this funny name, the Beatles. When they played, I was gobsmacked – how come there’s a Liverpool band of white kids playing black American music like that – ‘You Really Got a Hold on Me’, ‘Twist and Shout’…”\n\nSoon after, the Chants’ story changed on the night that their founder, Joe Ankrah, met up with Paul McCartney in the dressing room after a Little Richard concert in New Brighton in 1962. “He invited us to the Cavern for an audition,” recalls Amoo. “The Beatles finished their show and Paul said, ‘Up you go’, and we went through our routine. Then Paul said, ‘Come on stage with us tonight’. So we came back that evening, only by then Brian Epstein was there, and he said, ‘My group doesn’t back anyone.’ But they went into a huddle, and John Lennon insisted, like, and we did it, played with the Beatles.”\n\nEven this prestigious backing was not enough to secure the Chants great success beyond Liverpool, such was Britain’s mass reluctance to appreciate black American soul music – for all that the giants of jazz had compelled the intelligentsia – and later the Delta blues. Amoo recalls going to a concert by Tamla Motown stars including the Supremes and Stevie Wonder touring Britain, but playing to sparsely filled halls.\n\n“We were empowered from America,” says Amoo, “by people like Curtis Mayfield and by “What’s Goin’ On”. I was about 26 when Shaft came out, and at last we had a real black hero – not just a passive idol, but someone who was off the street and could make a difference.”\n\nBut Eddy Amoo was himself already writing what he calls “message songs” like “Man Without A Face” in 1967. When his younger brother Chris founded the Real Thing in 1974, Eddy was not only coaching them musically but offering them “street-conscious” material like a song called “Vicious Circle”, “about everyone being out on strike, and it just keeps going round”. Soon he joined the band himself.\n\nThey launched their career by coming under the wing of the legendary soul manager Tony Hall, and pairing up with David Essex. When the Amoo brothers wrote the “Children of the Ghetto” trilogy to strengthen their “message” repertoire and include in their live show, “David said that was the kind of thing we should be doing”, recalls Amoo. But soon after he had composed what is in retrospect the anthem of black British ghetto soul, continues Amoo, “someone came into the office with ‘You To Me Are Everything’. The record company wanted something commercial, they wanted a hit. So we did it, to shut them up basically, get them off our back, and it got to number one. I saw the whole thing as a big digression, but David Essex took me aside and said: ‘Too late, mate, they’re not going to let you stop now.’ And hey, who doesn’t want to be number one if you come from Liverpool 8?”\n\nFrom every stage they played, on every radio set and in every discotheque across the world, there was only one Amoo brothers song the greater public wanted to hear.\n\nAgainst the grain, however, in 1977, Amoo delivered the album he wanted to make: 4 from 8 – a tour de force with the haunting trilogy of ghetto songs as its denouement. Since which, by some cruel twist, “Children of the Ghetto” became the anthem of insurgent Liverpool — and later a smash hit in America — but reduced the Real Thing, says Amoo, “to being like ghosts. We still have our public. We still play a show at the Liverpool Philharmonic every two years, we sell it out, we do ‘Children of the Ghetto’ and they go wild. But on the great stage, we’re a ghost band – ‘Children of the Ghetto’ finished us.”\n\nSo the remainder of our conversation is an excavation into why could such a bizarre fate befall the Real Thing? Why should the song that finished them illuminate the careers of Phil Bailey and Mary J Blige? It is a conversation comprising theories, but no real answers. “Why is it, with all that happens in America, that there is no really successful black British band, let alone a political black British band?” pleads Eddy Amoo. “Yes, there’s Jazzie B, and I like him, good luck to him, but he plays the MTV game and all that, using black girls as soft porn. And yes, I do dare to have this feeling that if we’d put that album out and we came from Chicago it would not have finished our careers. In Britain, it’s different for some reason. It’s always ‘we’ll do this for the Africans, we’ll do this for the Muslims’, or whatever, and fine. But the black British: it’s ‘oh, they’re OK, they’ll be all right’. It was like that in 1981, and it’s like that now. Why is it that there simply is not a voice in music and the arts for the black British? It’s not racism like the National Front, in your face – no, it’s something bigger, something institutional.”\n\nExasperated in his search for an illustrative example, let alone an answer, Amoo calls in his lovely daughter Dee, who has a story to tell about her own daughter applying to university. “She asked me what to put on the form,” recounts Dee, “regarding her ethnicity. It was an online form, so it had these computer options: ‘Black African, Black West Indian, Black Other, Rather Not Say’. Actually, she’s Liverpool-born black: so she’s African, West Indian, Irish and Portugese. I said: ‘Put that you’re Black British, love.’ And she said: ‘It’s one of those computer forms where you have to choose an option, and it’s not there, so there’s no way I can be that, Mum’.”\n\nWhen the riots came, Amoo says, “I had grown up with the people who were masterminding them. People who had become politically intelligent the hard way, politically knowledgeable. And when it happened, part of me thought – this is horrific, burning down the ghetto, and another part of me thought: ‘They’re trying to find a way of making people listen to them. It’s come to this, and this is what it takes’.”\n\nThe Real Thing play Danson festival, Bexleyheath and many other dates across the summer"
