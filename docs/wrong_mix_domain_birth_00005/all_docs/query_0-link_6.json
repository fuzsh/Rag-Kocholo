        "text": "Mary comes from a family where her parents did not have time for her or care for her needs. Back in the beginning of the movie, Mary lived in India with her parents and during a party there was an earthquake that later ended up causing her to become an orphan. She was “shipped” to Liverpool England where she was later taken in by Medlock. When Mary arrived at the Manor, in her room she hid an\n\nAs Mary’s story unravels, she continues to suffer long hours of work, starvation, and separation from her family. She reads her holy bible and is constantly reminding herself that God is with her and will see her through these trials. Her spirits are lifted her master agrees to sell Mary to her husband, and her mistress begins the journey with her, but before long the mistress decides not to go any further and they turn back. Not long after, she starts to loose hope that she will ever be reunited with her family. She becomes discouraged, and her spirit\n\nMary begins the story as a doting housewife going through her daily routine with her husband. She is content to sit in his company silently until he begins a conversation. Everything is going as usual until he goes “ slowly to get himself another drink” while telling Mary to “sit down” (Dahl 1). This shocks Mary as she is used to getting things for him. After downing his second drink, her husband coldly informs her that he is leaving her and the child. This brutal news prompts the first change in Mary, from loving wife to emotionless and detached from everything.\n\nShe possessed a vibrant and vivacious personality and spoke her mind freely from childhood; friendly, sharp-witted and outgoing, she made friends easily, however she never hesitated to express to loved ones exactly what or how she thought they should handle a situation. This of course as everyone knew was regardless of her opinion being was solicited or not. This no doubt was the result of growing up as the baby of the family. Mary grew quite accustomed to getting her own way with her older siblings, Marvin and Corinne and growing up, surrounded by a bounty of loving family members; aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nAlso this is to teach you about how hard it was to be a person that had so many people die in their life. In the five paragraphs its going to be about her life. Mary is a very out going, smart, and intelligent person. She was a stay at home mom and she took care of the children , cooked and she cleaned. I think that nobody influenced her. I mean who could influence her? Her mom died when she was 7, her dad died July 26 1926, and lots of her other loved ones died. So I think that she was just being herself and that’s all. Her sister could've influenced her but she had her own things to worry about other than Mary like her husband, and her kids Julia Cook Edwards Baker, Charles Edwards, and Albert Stevenson Edwards. Also Mary and Elizabeth usually got\n\nThis displays that her being ostracized has forced her to change her views on society and realize not everyone is as nice as they appear. Later on in Mary’s life, her aunt says to Dunny: “Now she remembers so little, and it’s better so, because when she does remember she thinks of Paul” (Davies, 129). This proves that she has continuously been ignoring and forgetting about society for a couple of years. She has isolated herself to avoid conflict and hatred. This alienation Mary has experienced has changed her perception of\n\nShe started to look and things a lot differently. In my eyes she helped a lot of people out without a care in the world. Mary Baker was often called on to cure cases physicians had given up. People looked up to her so much and at time she uses to be hurt because she couldn’t help. At all times she wrote everything in her book to expand into her primary.\n\nIn her role as a Puritan Minister’s wife, Mary, was a firm believer in the faith. From the first of the narrative, it is apparent that Mary has deep roots in the Christian faith. Whenever there is a positive development in her captivity, she attributes it to God’s goodness and mercy upon her. For example, she believes she has been blessed by God when her wound heals. When hardships arise, she views them as either a punishment for something wrong, she has done or the will of God for her life. Mary believed that God had used the Native Indians as a way to punish them because they had offended Him. She draws strength and hope from the strong belief that God is with her throughout all her sufferings under her captors. In their capture, some of the captives enter into a state of despair, which drives them to commit suicide. Mary Rowlandson looks into her faith and draws the strength she needs to stay alive. She credits God for keeping her alive and protecting her from being abused sexually by the Native Indian men. During her confinement, she leans on Biblical scripture and stories to keep her going. She believes that just as God redeemed Daniel, and Job, He would do the same for her. So deep was Mary’s\n\nIn the play, Mary is a beautiful woman and lives the life like any other girls of her time; but she is emotionally attached to her sons and her family when she marries into the Tyrone family. She is also getting old, so she keeps going on her days worrying about her change of appearance. She suffers from a morphine addiction and she is psychologically wounded because of her past. She tries many times to break free but she could not stop as she spends time with her family. She has gone through many struggles but she cannot move on with her life. She keeps looking back into the past; and she regrets marrying into the family because of the dreams she had to sacrifice such as becoming a nun or a concert pianist."
