        "text": "Long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...three musicians banded together and created some of the most amazing tunes ever to grace the celestial heavens. Their identities kept secret for a while, they were simply known at the time as \"Klaatu.\" The band's first album 3:47 EST reverberated across the universe and caused a crack in the cosmic egg as their music sounded undeniably \"Beatleseque.\" Beatle fans began their own magical mystery tour of sorts looking for clues in Klaatu's music and album covers if only to prove that both Klaatu and Beatles were the same musicians. But alas, over time it was eventually revealed to them that the \"Beatleseque\" group consisted of three very talented Canadian musicians by the names of John Woloschuk, Terry Draper and Dee Long.\n\nWith the release of 3:47 EST, Klaatu recorded four more albums: Hope (exemplifying \"classical rock\" at its very best in terms of concept albums); Sir Army Suit (showcasing a variety of tunes comparable to the Beatles' White Album); Endangered Species; and finally, Magentalane. Klaatu's music garnered legendary status in the music industry which was backed by a cult following known as Klaatusians! The demand for Klaatu product has been so strong in the past that two greatest hits compilations were released: Klaasic Klaatu and Peaks. As the band's legacy and cult following continued, so too did the demand for the re-mastering of all Klaatu albums. Enter now Jaimie Vernon, President of Bullseye Records who responded to the call by re-mastering and re-issuing the first four albums (including their greatest hits album Peaks.) Not only are those albums currently available, Jaimie is now planning two more major projects for Klaatu: The first one being a Klaatu reunion for fans to meet with the actual band members to take place on May 7, 2005 in Toronto. The second project is a soon-to-be released Klaatu boxed set (it will be presented on both vinyl and CD format) containing early demos and alternate recording takes that Klaatu recorded for their catalogue. The boxed set will feature new album cover artwork by Ted Jones. Ted, by the way, did the art work for four out five Klaatu album covers: \"He did not do 'Sir Army Suit', much to my chagrin,\" said band member Terry Draper. The boxed set will include posters, postcards, and other memorabilia.\n\nThese announcements will prove to be a busy schedule for Bullseye Records. But the Klaatu boxed set, when released, will be a welcomed joy for Klaatusians! The release could cause the planet Earth to stop spinning on its axis for a brief moment to take note which may best be described as: \"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\"\n\nPlease read Jaimie Vernon's official announcement e-mailed on August 21, 2004:\n\n\"We're proud to announce that all three members of Klaatu - John, Terry and Dee - will be attending the Klaatu - World Contact Day 2005 Konvention. Contracts are being signed this week so attendance is guaranteed.\n\nBy request of the band the date has been officially set as May 7th in Toronto at the International Plaza Hotel.\n\nTicket information, prices, and schedules for the events (along with additional guests as they're confirmed) will be posted the third week of September on three separate websites:\n\nhttp://www.klaatu.org/\n\nhttp://www.bullseyecanada.com/\n\nhttp://www.fansfirstinc.com/\n\nThis will occur shortly after a meeting with all three band members around September 13th (when Dee comes into town). We'll be setting out the schedule of events and going over the final details of the boxed set.\n\nA final list of songs for the boxed set has been established, but format still seems to be fluctuating. I have introduced the idea of going to a 3-CD set to accommodate all the material that John seems to think is necessary for the set -- Terry is reluctantly coming around. That leaves the DVD as a separate component yet to be decided.\n\nThe vinyl release song list still needs to be finalized....with a release definitely set for this year as promised. I've seen the final version of Ted's new painting and everyone has signed off on it. The painting will be photographed and digitized this week for use on the boxed set, posters, websites, promotional brochures, etc.\n\nStay Klaatuned!\n\nJaimie Vernon,\n\nPresident, Bullseye Records\n\nhttp://www.bullseyecanada.com/\n\nAuthor, Canadian Pop Music Encyclopedia\n\nhttp://www.canoe.ca/JamMusicPopEncycloPages\n\n----------------------------\n\nAugust 17\n\nAmnesty International releases new re-recording of \"Give Peace A Chance\"\n\nNOTE: People wishing to support Amnesty International (a non-profit organization) for their social causes can order a copy of the new re-recording of \"Give Peace A Chance\" with the link that Robert Harrison has provided below:\n\nHello John and Tony,\n\nThe new \"Give Peace a Chance\" recording was officially released today (click on \"English\" in upper right-hand corner of screen).\n\nThe verses are sung, in order, by Nanette Workman (former back-up singer for John Lennon and Rolling Stones), David Usher (lead singer of group Moist), Justin Trudeau (son of late P.M.

The company said it will issue a new artist-designed Peace Chuck every year till peace arrives.\"\n\n----------------------------\n\nAugust 12\n\nTwist and Shout!\n\nBBC musicologist Spencer Leigh has written another book based on the Cavern years in Liverpool entitled \"Twist and Shout!\" According to Philip Key of the Daily Post, \"Twist and Shout! features hundreds of interviews, most of them on tape and conducted for Leigh's Radio Merseyside programmes. The well-organised Leigh transcribes all his taped interviews so they are easier to access.\" The book also combines some of the original material from Spencer Leigh's first effort on this subject when in 1984 he published \"Let's Go Down the Cavern\".\n\nTo read Philip Key's article about Spencer Leigh's new book, please click: Writer gives Cavern legends twist in tale legends\n\n----------------------------\n\nAugust 4\n\nClimb aboard with the Yellow Submarine Book!\n\nApple is delighted to present its first picture-book version of the classic animated film.

The announcement was made yesterday morning by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. We most certainly hope that both Mark and Paul win in all categories. The results will be televised from the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium on Sunday, September 19, on the ABC Television Network.\n\nThe 5 categories are: 1) Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special; 2) Lighting Direction (Electronic, Multi-Camera) for a VMC Programming; 3) Variety, Music or Comedy Special; 4) Sound Mixing for a Variety or Music Series or Special; 5) Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. A complete list of all Emmy nominations is available either as a \"Nominations (Word)\" doc or \"Nominations (PDF)\" file from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences web site.\n\nThe Paul McCartney in Red Square special was produced by MPL Tours, Ltd. in association with A&E (the Arts and Entertainment Network). The program illustrated how Beatles music had impacted on the downfall of communism (just one of several factors at work) as well as Paul performing in front of 100,000 fans and highlights from his 3-day tour in Russia during May, 2003.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJuly 15\n\nUpdate: Beatles' Lost Holy Grail Tapes turns out to be a sham!\n\nThe Abbeyrd Beatles Page reports that two different Beatle fan club representatives from England, Pete Nash (from the http://www.britishbeatlesfanclub.co.uk/) and Richard Porter (from the http://www.beatlesinlondon.com/ ) have confirmed that the tapes in question that were discovered in Australia, have turned out to be material already bootlegged on an LP entitled \"Arrive Without Aging\" and from other bootleg sources. For details, click here.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJuly 13\n\nThe Beatles' Lost Holy Grail Found?\n\nSeems as though the press has been eager to jump on a recent discovery touted as being possibly (but not likely) Mal Evans' long-lost suitcase containing alternate versions of \"We Can Work It Out\" and \"Cry Baby Cry\". The 4-hour recording tapes which were marked as \"Abbey Road...not for release\" also contained studio banter between Lennon and McCartney trying out songs that were never completed. The suitcase had a mass of \"400 photographs, vinyl records, concert programmes\" which were discovered by Mr. Fraser Claughton in a flea market in Lara, a town near Melbourne, Australia. He paid $50.00 for the suitcase.\n\nHowever, speculation remains concerning the authenticity of the discovery as it may turn out to be merely bootlegged material that has already been in circulation in one form or another. Noted Beatle scholar Mark Lewisohn who works for the Apple Record label, had listened to the tapes over the phone and downplayed the discovery: \"From my point of view there isn't anything lost here,\" said Mr. Lewisohn.\n\nAs usual, one of the big auctioning firms have shown some interest in the discovery. A spokesperson for Christie's in London said: \"We haven't seen it and we won't be able to say anything more until we have.\"\n\nFurther reading: The Case of the Missing Beatles Songs + Long and Winding road to Beatles' holy grail\n\n----------------------------\n\nJuly 9\n\nPop star Neil Diamond slams Beatles' LSD talk as harmful\n\nWith the recent interview from Paul McCartney in UNCUT magazine, Paul admitted that during the recording of Sgt. Pepper he took \"coke for about a year around that time. Coke and maybe some grass to balance it out. I was never completely crazy with cocaine.\" He also admitted that some of the Beatle songs were about drugs: \"On the earlier albums, we'd have been using those drugs socially so, in that sense, the drugs informed what we did. A song like \"Got To Get You Into My Life\", that's directly about pot, although everyone missed it at the time. \"Day Tripper\", that's one about acid. \"Lucy In The Sky\", that's pretty obvious. There's others like that make subtle hints about drugs on The Beatles' music.\"\n\nBut not all in the pop industry agreed back then with the position that the Beatles were taking on drugs. Certainly Paul McCartney himself made a public admission on June 19, 1967, that he had taken LSD four times. \"Something ought to be done about the Beatles' publicly talking about using LSD,\" said singer/songwriter Neil Diamond in a 1967 interview. \"It was very stupid on their part.\" Diamond, who admitted to trying both marijuana and LSD at least once, had this to say about the experiences: \"I once tried marijuana. It was a very disappointing experience. The effect was no more than that of a screwdriver.\n\n\"When I used LSD - just once - I stopped being aware of myself. Then it became a nightmare in color -- colors that weren't there. I wasn't rational. It didn't wear off for a couple of days and its effect continued for much longer.\n\n\"I know of a musician who used LSD and wound up in a home for the insane.\n\n\"Most users, I think, are losers. They think they're turning themselves on -- but actually they're turning themselves off -- trying to escape from the world.\n\n\"The musician who took LSD -- he could have avoided his 'trip' and accomplished the same thing by taking rat poison!\"\n\nNeil Diamond's interview was conducted by Earl Wilson and appeared in The Ottawa Journal on September 20, 1967 (see: \"Singer Says Beatles' LSD Talk Harmful\").\n\n----------------------------\n\nJuly 2\n\nBill Eppridge photography: The Beatles Backstage and Behind the Scenes\n\nThe Allen Lambert Galleria in Toronto is showcasing 84 rarely-seen photographs of the Beatles that were taken by Bill Eppridge of LIFE magazine. The collection, which is on display from July 26 to August 27, includes photos from the CBS archives highlighting the Beatles debut on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964.\n\nThe Allen Lambert Galleria is located on 181 Bay St. For more details, phone: (416) 364-4693.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 24\n\nThe making of Yellow Submarine\n\nA new book tells the story of the making of the brilliant animated movie. One of the four writers of the film, Al Brodax, has published Up Periscope which tells the full story.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 22\n\nFormer Beatle Pete Best to perform in Ottawa at Barrymore's Music Hall, July 6!\n\nShow time for the Pete Best and his band begins 8:00 p.m. with advance tickets costing $20.00 and possibly $25.00 at the door on opening day. According to the manager at Barrymore's, the opening act is \"Moonlight Graham\". Some tickets are available through Ticketmaster at: (613) 755-1111.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 20\n\nPaul is Back In the U.S.S.R.\n\nA crowd of 60,000 Russian Beatle fans watched Paul McCartney perform in the opulent Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. This was Paul's first performance in that city and his 3,000 concert gig. The show which was sold out was delayed for one-and-a-half hours partly because of security measures as concertgoers were screened through three security checks. As a result, traffic was paralyzed around the central square.\n\nFor McCartney, it was his second appearance in Russia, a country were they once banned Beatles music as being a corruptive influence from the West. Under communism, fans would secretly listen and hide their Beatles music in fear of reprisal from Soviet authorities. One such Russian, Malsky, told the Associated Press that he recalled a school friend being punished for listening to the Beatles.\n\nIn spite of the crackdown, Beatles music had a very positive and liberating effect on Russians. Said Kolya Vasin: \"Like many of my compatriots, who lived in the oppressive Soviet atmosphere, I was kind of a scared person with many complexes,\" he said. \"I never had friends.\n\n\"The Beatles knocked all that out of me.\n\n\"Their music taught me to enjoy life. And they brought many friends into my life.\"\n\nOver time, the Beatles music would eventually become one of several different factors leading up to the downfall of communism.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 9\n\nRussian has devoted 40 years to the Beatles\n\n¬ìI already know what I will wear,¬î Kolya Vasin said, planning his campaign to meet the rock legend. ¬ìA T-shirt that says Paul, Welcome Home.¬î\n\nMcCartney is to perform on Sunday before an estimated 50,000 fans in St Petersburg¬ís Palace Square, in front of the Hermitage Museum.\n\nThe concert, McCartney¬ís first in St Petersburg, will mark the peak of the northern city¬ís famous White Nights, when the sun barely dips beyond the horizon before starting its upward climb again.\n\nVasin, who has invited McCartney to visit him while he is in St Petersburg, has dedicated the last four decades of his life to honouring the Beatles. (See also: St. Petersburg Times; The Scotsman).\n\nFormer Apple General Manager, Alistair Taylor, passes away\n\nJust a few weeks shy of his 69th birthday, on this date, James Alistair Taylor has passed away in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He is survived by his widow Lesley Gillibrand (the couple did not have any children). It is reported that he died from \"a short bronchial illness\". An obituary on Alistair has been published by BBC music historian, Spencer Leigh. For details, please click here. Beatle historian Martin Lewis has also paid a tribute to Alistair Taylor. For his report, click here. See also the report in Matlock Today.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 6\n\nHistorical Flashback: Sexy Sadie turns Beatles on to Mind-Bending Kick\n\nThe now defunct Toronto Telegram wrote an article on October 7, 1967 concerning the Beatles meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during the month of August of that year. When it was written, it occurred roughly around same the time when John and George were seen on the David Frost show on September 29, 1967, chatting about drugs and meditation. Folk singer Donovan Leitch -- who was present for the second retreated with the Beatles in February of 1968 -- describes the Maharishi as a \"man who's going to tell us something.\" Leitch went on to say: \"McCartney said the same thing and I think Lennon said the same thing -- 'We're going to go over and he's going to tell us how to really lay this peace on earth because we know this man is advanced.' We were looking for this guy to tell us something. The main thing with the Maharishi for me was that he laughed. We realized that we were also turning the Maharishi on. It was two ways. The press were outside. The Beatles, one Beach Boy, me, and Paul Horn, we were inside. The Maharishi taught us how to meditate.\"\n\nJohn Lennon would later profess that the song, Sexy Sadie, was all about the yogi: \"That was inspired by Maharishi,\" he told David Sheff for Playboy. \"I wrote it when we had are bags packed and we were leaving. It was the last piece I wrote before I left India. I just called him 'Sexy Sadie.' I was leaving the Maharishi with a bad taste.\" Hindsight is 20/20 as they say and Lennon certainly did not see through the Maharishi during their first retreat based on a report that was filed by the Toronto Telegram entitled: Foursome Plan to Become 'Spiritual Guides' -- Beatles Now on a Mind-Bending Kick.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 5\n\nHow Ringo Starr chose the black oyster pearl drum kit from Ludwig\n\nThe drumbeat of success for Ludwig could not have been better timed when on February 1964, the drum kit that Ringo was using on the Ed Sullivan show was beamed by CBS television into American homes thereby giving the manufacturer instant recognition. What happened next was the enormous commercial demand for that very lovely black oyster pearl drum kit. A very interesting article which chronicles that history is available by clicking: The Night That Changed The Music World.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJune 1, 2004\n\nPeace gets another chance\n\nSee May 17 item below....\n\n----------------------------\n\nMay 27\n\nCBC Arts News: \"Photo exhibit celebrates John and Yoko's Bed-in for Peace\"\n\nA news article from the CBC is highlighting the photography of Gerry Deiter. Mr. Deiter, who at the time was taking pictures for \"Life\" magazine, was present throughout the John and Yoko peace campaign in Montreal. The article, \"Photo exhibit celebrates John and Yoko's Bed-in for Peace\" contains an external link to the Elliot Gallery which is currently displaying some of Mr. Deiter's rare photography of John and Yoko's bed-in .\n\n----------------------------\n\nMay 17\n\nQu√©bec artists to re-create \"Give Peace A Chance\" at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel\n\nTo commemorate the 35th anniversary of John Lennon's \"Give Peace A Chance\", on June 1 a group of Qu√©bec artists will go to the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in room 1742 to re-record Lennon's classic peace anthem. Donald Tarlton, the brainchild behind the idea, was actually present when Lennon and Ono recorded the original hit song. To this very day he still remembers what Lennon said before introducing the new peace song to the participants in the room: \"He had such clear focus and such clarity of thought,\" said Tarlton. \"He said, 'From the United Nations to all the power the power brokers in the world, there are 10 million reasons why things can't be done -- but it boils down to a simple message: Give Peace A Chance.' As he said it, he started to sort of hum it and sing it.\"\n\nRock group La Chicane will accompany the various Qu√©bec artists to re-record the song which will be issued by BoomBox, either available over the internet or over the counters at music stores. All proceeds from the sale of the song will be donated to Amnesty International which has been approved by Yoko Ono.\n\nInterestingly, CBC director Paul McGrath is currently preparing a television documentary on 35th anniversary of the recording of \"Give Peace A Chance.\" McGrath has gone to great lengths in recruiting as many of the original participants who sung along with John Lennon and Yoko Ono when they recorded their peace anthem on June 1, 1969. Donald Tarlton was interviewed by McGrath and is expected to make an appearance in the show. And in an email correspondence dated March 3, 2004, to John Whelan of the Ottawa Beatles Site, McGrath describes some of the celebrities lined up for the CBC program: \"We will interview Andre Perry when he comes to Montreal between April 12 and 23. I interviewed Tom Smothers in San Diego last week, and his yarns are likely to provide the funniest moments in the doc. He tells the story of John correcting his guitar playing, and tells it with a twinkle in his eye and fabulous timing. Most people in the room for the recording say Petula was not there at that point (Smothers insists she wasn't) but it's likely she heard John working on or rehearsing the song beforehand, and that's good enough for inclusion in our doc. We'll be talking to her in Atlantic City between April 5 and 12.\"\n\nThe working title of the CBC television special, \"Give Peace A Song,\" is expected to be aired sometime in the winter of 2005.

Sandy Gardiner, in case you didn't know, was the first journalist who made use of the phrase \"Beatlemania\" into a North American newspaper report. His article is also listed here at the Ottawa Beatles Site.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMay 5\n\nBeatles Contract Sold At Christie's\n\nThe original revised management agreement between the Beatles and Brian Epstein was sold at Christie's auction house for $220,306. The document is dated October 1, 1962, was estimated to fetch between $44,832 and $62,765 but tripled in value when it was sold to a private collector. Interestingly, a questionnaire for the Record Mirror that was filled out by the Beatles was also sold at the auction house. It had revealed some very flattering remarks about Brian Epstein: \"Without Brian none of us would have had some of the wonderful chances which his management has opened for us,\" wrote Ringo Starr while Paul McCartney described Epstein as a \"good manager: astute, sympathetic, good lad, dad!\" The questionnaire which also contained comments from George, was sold for $25,644.\n\nOther Beatle items auctioned at Christie's: Lennon's leather collar that he wore in 1967-1968 sold for $247,000; a colored felt pen drawing by Lennon sold for $24,700; Lennon's pen-and-ink drawing (\"Happy Fish\"), sold for $23,465; a letter signed by Lennon sold for $13,585; and a 1966 custom-made Vox Kensington guitar, used by both John and George, fetched $240,000. The guitar had been previously owned Alex Mardas as a gift from John Lennon.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMay 1, 2004\n\n\"THE BEATLES with Tony Sheridan - The Beginnings in Hamburg - A Documentary\"\n\nAn excellent DVD exploring the early years with Tony Sheridian and the Beatles has been released by Universal Music. The DVD, entitled \"THE BEATLES with Tony Sheridan - The Beginnings in Hamburg - A Documentary\", runs 2 hrs 17min, features interviews from Tony Sheridan, Roy Young, Klaus Voormann, Astrid Kirchherr, Horst Fascher and the Beatles first manager, Allan Williams along with a host of other contemporaries from that period.\n\nTony Sheridan, the central figure in the documentary, provides insight to the origins of the song selection for the tracks that he and the Beatles recorded for Polydor. While the Beatles only recorded 7 tracks with Sheridan, featured here are 16 of those tracks done by the pop star. As each song is played, still photography is introduced linking the viewer back to the days of the Kaiserkeller, the Reeperbahn, the Top Ten Club and the Star-Club adding historical value to the documentary. While some photos will be familiar to fans, there are enough interesting \"never-before-seen\" photography of the locales in Hamburg along with group photos of the Beatles and Tony Sheridan. Also included in the still photography segments are rare and unique photographs of Stuart Sutcliffe, presumably taken by Astrid Kirchherr, Stu's girlfriend at the time.\n\nThe interviews are informative with the best contributions coming from Tony Sheridan, Allan Williams and Roy Young. Tony Sheridan tells his stories with much candor and at times enthusiasm while the Beatles first manager, Allan Williams, lives up to expectations in the similar elk that he wrote in his first book, \"The Man Who Gave Away The Beatles\". In the documentary, Beat Brother Roy Young remains true during the interviews and his answers are similar to an interview that he gave to the Ottawa Beatles Site a few years ago (see: A Roy Young Interview). But the only drawback found in this documentary happens to be the interviews of the German participants: they present their answers in German with English subtitles appearing at the bottom of the screen. This includes invaluable comments from Klaus Voormann, Astrid Kirchheer, Jurgan Kramer, Sound Assistant for the Sheridan/Beatles recordings and Horst Fascher, Sheridan's manager and a few band members from The Rattles and others which sometimes takes away from the entertainment value (it might have been better if the producer had used \"English voiceovers\" rather than using English subtitles for the spoken German responses.) That said, the historical value of this DVD gets a close \"topermost of the popermost\" rating for exploring the early beginnings of The Beatles and Tony Sheridan --definitely a must-have in your Beatles collection.\n\nHistorical value: **** / 5 stars\n\nEntertainment value: *** / 5 stars\n\n----------------------------\n\nApril 29, 2004\n\n\"Lennon\" Musical Heading for Broadway\n\nBoth the Scotsman.com and Playbill news services are reporting that a musical play on the life and times of John Lennon will make its debut at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on February 1st before heading on to Broadway in 2005. The idea for the play was conceived by Don Scardino. The musical is setting out to illustrate that John Lennon was more than just a musician. Said Scardino in an interview with Playbill: \"He always seemed to be ahead of the curve. Or, by example, the curve followed him. He was such a leader for a certain generation, particularly, that he's emblematic of the times he came through.\"\n\nThere are thirty songs scheduled for the play (approved by Yoko Ono) which include: \"Imagine,\" \"Instant Karma,\" \"Give Peace a Chance,\" \"Mind Games\", \"Gimme Some Truth\" \"Working Class Hero,\" and \"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\". Ten actors will be used to depict the various stages of John Lennon's life from Merseyside to New York where the pop star resided.\n\nThe play, which has been three years in the making, has Scardino teamed up with Allan McKeown (producer of Jerry Springer - The Opera). It is expected that both the casting and creative team will be announced at a later date.\n\n----------------------------\n\nApril 28, 2004\n\nNew Book: \"THE Ringo Starr Enclyclopedia\" by Bill Harry\n\nBill Harry, founder of Mersey Beat magazine, has written a 170,000-word book recognizing the humour, talent and courage of Ringo Starr. Entitled \"THE Ringo Starr Enclyclopedia\" the book will be published by Virgin Books on May 4, at ¬£12.99 (or about $30.00 Canadian and $22.00 American.) Dave Charters of Liverpool Daily Post, highlights this new book along with an interview from Bill Harry in an article entitled: \"Starr Is Brought to Book\".\n\n----------------------------\n\nApril 19, 2004\n\nLast known sketch by John Lennon up for sale\n\nWhat is believed to be the last known sketch with John Lennon's signature on it, is on sale for $325,000 at Moments in Time web site.\n\nRabiah Yazzie Seminole, the original owner of the valuable note had been working as a switchboard operator at the Record Plant in Manhattan on December 8, 1980. In a sworn affidavit, Seminole states that \"as John Lennon and Yoko Ono were leaving Record Plant they gave me a drawing done by John Lennon and signed by him and Yoko Ono.\" Rabiah recalls receiving the sketch at about 10:25 p.m. that night. A very short time later that night, just before 11:00 p.m., Lennon was tragically gunned down by a deranged fan outside the Dakota.\n\nFor years the sketch had been on Seminole's bedroom wall and not many knew about its existence. She has decided to put the famous last note by Lennon up for sale in order to raise money for her horse sanctuary, \"The Blue Horse Mukwa Equine Retirement and Rescue Center\", a non-profit organization which she runs in Chesapeake, Virginia. Her horse sanctuary takes in horses who have been either neglected or abused, some with broken legs or gunshot wounds. The sanctuary was damaged last year by a hurricane causing a financial hardship to keep it running. Said Rabiah: \"I didn't want to capitalize on John's death, but I think he would have wanted to help the horses.\"\n\n---------------------------\n\nApril 2, 2004\n\nCultural reform activist, John Sinclair, declares today's music as \"sappy and lame\"\n\nCultural reform activist John Sinclair has denounced most of today's music scene as being \"sappy and lame\" -- devoid of any content that reflects reforms or protests concerning today's social injustices. His comments appeared on The State News - Michigan University Independent Voice web page. Said Sinclair: \"It's been a negative example. I think they've used the music by making it sappy and lame for the past 30 years since The Eagles and Lindsey Buckingham. They started to sap the progressive content of the music that was developing at the time, and now it's made by machines. They eliminate the possibility of originality and intelligence. You can do it, but you won't be rewarded. I always say, 'If you take the pledge of poverty, you can do whatever you want with art in America, because they don't care. It's rough.'\"\n\nSinclair, a vanguard of the 1960's cultural radicalism, was arrested and jailed in 1969 for possession of two joints of marijuana. He spent 29 months of his ten-year sentence before his name became elevated into the international spotlight by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The couple held a \"Free John Now\" concert in 1971, at Ann Arbor's Crisler Arena. \"John was terrified going onstage,\" recalled Stu Werbin. \"He was following Stevie Wonder, with a make-shift band, trying out new material. He worried that people might start yelling for 'Hey Jude'.\" Lennon opened the set with \"John Sinclair\" which was followed up with \"Sisters, O'Sisters\" by Yoko Ono and then \"Attica State\". But it was the lyrical lines in \"John Sinclair\" that became the most revealing of all in terms of just how unfair Sinclair's lengthy jail time was. \"The lyrics referred to recent revelations that the CIA was involved in heroin trafficking in Southeast Asia on a massive scale while Sinclair rotted in jail for selling two joints\", wrote Jon Wiener in his book \"Come Together John Lennon In His Time\". The concert and music worked...three days later Sinclair's sentence was overturned. Wiener also revealed that Sinclair recalled Lennon with great fondness: \"Lennon was very groovy - if that term means anything today. A real sweet, warm, nice, outgoing type of guy.\"\n\nToday, John Sinclair still holds the same viewpoints as he did back then concerning the laws on drugs. \"I don't want to reform them; I want them thrown out,\" he told Michigan State News reporter A.P. Kryza. \"I want the Dutch model, only more. America has built a huge industry for the right-wing law enforcement who have benefited from this more than anyone admits....We're as close to a police state as you have in a democracy.\"\n\nSinclair is still active in music and poetry. He will be making an appearance at the Creole Gallery, April 2, at 8:00 p.m. in Lansing backed with the Blues Scholars and will be performing with Glow on April 3, at 4:20 p.m. at the Hash Bash hullabaloo in Ann Arbor.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMarch 27, 2004\n\nHistorical Flashback: The Beatles were shut out at Expo 67\n\nYou would think that the Beatles after having received their prestigious M.B.E. (Member of the British Empire) awards in 1965, that Britain would logically have honored the group in their pictorial gallery at British pavilion during Canada's centennial, Expo 67. Apparently they did not! In a report filed by Richard Jackson of the Ottawa Journal on April 29, 1967, the COI (Central Office of Information) in London did at one point consider using a photographic portrait of the Beatles at Expo but were instead passed over for the bad boys of rock and roll, the Rolling Stones! The Stones image was displayed along with other historical notables such as \"Shakespeare, Christopher Wren, Drake, Wellington, Disraeli, Victoria the great and all the illustrious hundreds of others\" wrote Jackson. While the honor at the time might well have pleased Mick Jagger and the rest of the Rolling Stones and their fans, staff members at the British pavilion reacted negatively. Wrote Jackson: \"The COI just better watch it. For there are 30 glorious English girls serving as hostesses in the pavilion and they're blazing mad, and waiting for the publicists of the information office to just dare show up. 'If the Beatles haven't earned a place of honor, who has?' asks the head hostess Dorothy Rogers, 28, from Lytham St. Annes in Lancashire.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the American pavilion had given the nod to their own pop icon, Elvis Presley, along with photographic images of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Marilyn Monroe and whole slew of other famous notables.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMarch 23, 2004\n\nLennon art trial secrets revealed\n\n\"A prosecution over John Lennon's \"erotic\" drawings may have failed because of implications for major art collections\" writes the BBC news services.

He was 75.\n\nBrief \"bio\" on Alfred George Bicknell: Alf was born in Haslemere, Surrey, on October 28, 1928, and was educated locally. His early jobs included working as an \"apprentice butcher and as a circus clown\" wrote the Telegraph and he also \"did three years' National Service in the Army\". During the 1950's, Bicknell became a chauffeur to a number of foreign embassies in England. By 1964, he was highly recommended to and hired by Beatles manager, Brian Epstein. Alf drove and worked with the Beatles on their tours and in August of 1965, both he and the band met Elvis Presley at the pop-stars Bel-Air home. On another occasion, both Alf and the Beatles met up with legendary American folk singer, Bob Dylan. However, one of the low-points during touring occurred on July 1966 when the band was roughed up in the Philippines. George Harrison once said: \"Alf Bicknell lived moment to moment with the Beatles through those years....Anyone who was beaten up by Imelda Marco's bully squad is a friend of mine.\" With regards to Beatles recordings, Bicknell made a proud appearance on \"Yellow Submarine\". Said Alf: \"I did some of the sound effects and sang in the chorus. You can hear the anchor going down just be a voice says, \"Full steam ahead, Mr. Bo'sun.\" That was me with an old tin bath and a piece of chain.\" When touring stopped in 1966, so too did Bicknell's employment with the Beatles. He continued being a chauffeur but this time with the New Christy Minstrels in America. For three years, Bicknell also chauffeured Lord McAlpine. He also gained employment at the Tilbury Construction. Bicknell would later share his Beatle memories with fans by attending various Beatle conventions and through various publications: In 1989, Bicknell released \"Baby, You Can Drive My Car!\" that was co-written with Beatles expert Garry Marsh. In 1995, saw the release of \"Alf Bicknell's Beatles Diary\" which was in the form of a book and video package and in 1999, he co-wrote with Alasdaire Ferguson, \"Ticket to Ride: the ultimate Beatles tour diary!\" Alf Bicknell is survived by his wife Jean and their son.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMarch 06, 2004\n\nBaby, You're A Rich Man\n\nYesterday, Reuters reported on the web that Paul McCartney fortune \"is bigger than the combined wealth of Elton John, Mick Jagger and Madonna, according to a new rich list.\" McCartney's wealth is now listed at 725 million pounds -- or to put this into a North American perspective, that would be $1,761,871,422.35 (Canadian) or $1,336,175,000.00 (American) based on the exchange rates taken on this date from the Universal Currency Converter.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMarch 05, 2004\n\nBeatles \"1\" still a top Billboard seller\n\nAfter 172 weeks on the charts, for the week ending March 13, 2004, Billboard is reporting that Beatles \"1\" is No. 2 in terms of popular pop catalog albums being sold in the marketplace. Last week \"1\" was also in this same position on Billboard. Since the album's November release in 2000, Beatles \"1\" has sold over 25 million copies world-wide. Meanwhile, \"Let It Be Naked\", which was Paul McCartney's idea to release the upgraded version of the Beatles 1970 \"Let It Be\" album, continued to slide down the charts. It was at No. 130 on Billboard's top 200 album chart as of February 6, 2004.\n\n----------------------------\n\nFebruary 28, 2004\n\nWere You There for the Recording of \"Give Peace A Chance?\" If so, C.B.C. television is looking for you!\n\nThe C.B.C. television is working on a new documentary that will focus on the recording of \"Give Peace A Chance\".

(Snowy is a fairly affluent house builder in Perth, but some years ago the band played a sellout tour around Australia -- after the lead singer had been released from prison where he was doing time for drug offences).\n\nMy comments about the Beatles are based upon the general feeling of a lot of people at the time -- I had known them for a few years before their fame.\n\nBrian Epstein made The Beatles (it was business) they were the first real manufactured band -- Lennon's prolific song writing put them at the top (and lets face it some of those songs will still be classics in 50 years time (my favourites did not achieve single's status, but were tracks on some of the first albums).\n\nThe Beatles last show on the cave after fame found them was an Easter Bank holiday weekend -- all the bands (and we were among them) had a big card school running in the dressing room and it was a fantastic weekend.\n\nThe Stones played Liverpool when The Beatles were in town and my band was playing the Blue Angel (Alan is another club manager with a memory of convenience -- he only remembers his input into the big bands) imagine our surprise when John and Paul arrived (John brought his psychedelic Rolls Royce) and they were followed by The Stones -- they all dashed out to view John's new Roller.\n\nMost people can't imagine what it was like to play at the cave, even before it was world famous it was pretty intimidating --trying to get the sound right with all those vaulted arches and pillars (hot steamy and jam packed almost every night).\n\nThe front row harridans (the cave's official veto crew of some not very pretty females) stared at the bands and decided if you would come back.\n\nIf you had a gig somewhere else before your cave spot you had to fight your way through the packed crowd with amps and instruments -- interfering with Cavern Stompers (the official dance due to lack of space for free movement of limbs).\n\nEpstein opened a nightclub in a Liverpool backstreet (it was very posh inside and a drink cost ¬£1.00 a pint -- normal pubs you could buy 6 pints for that amount of money -- my band The Dions was the first act to play there and we played there a number of times (Epstein and Lennon came a couple of times together and we thought hello what's all this then? -- Eppy offered to sign us up, but my dad said no, so eppy recommended another agent (I quit the band shortly after that -- the new agent had wandering hands).\n\nCilla used to work at the cave and got her chance through eppy on Lennon's referral, I loved her first hit and backed numerous artists at clubs singing that song over the next 10 years.\n\nWe could enter into a working relationship, with me passing snippets of memories etc -- especially when I meet up with a lot of the other lads.\n\nThe Liverpool bands would have continued to play and enjoy themselves -- most of us did it for the personal pleasure -- as we made little money and had expensive equipment -- The Coasters could not turn pro with Billy (Billy J) as all the rest of the group were actually serving apprenticeships in various trades, my band had a guy studying chemistry another accountancy and so on -- some of the bands found fame after Beatlemania, but most of us just enjoyed playing (I played in a pipe band as well as groups and did 2 stints in the percussion section of Liverpool philharmonic youth orchestra -- I also occasionally played with big dance bands and jazz bands).\n\nJoe Morrello (Dave Bruebeck five drummer) came to Liverpool and gave a 1 night drum clinic -- nearly 300 drummers attended and only a couple of big heads worked for many different groups around the city that night -- most clubs actually closed due to shortage of drummers -- I don't think any of the guys at the drum clinic ever turned pro and none really wanted to.\n\nI've had the honour to appear on the same bill (spot before) as Buddy Rich and his band (I nearly retired after that show --haven't played drums in public since though).\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn Trust\n\n----------------------------\n\nFebruary 24, 2004\n\nGeorge Harrison \"Dark Horse Years 1976 - 1992\" deluxe box-set is released!\n\nThe long awaited deluxe-box set containing the solo work that George Harrison did on his Dark Horse label, has been released by Capitol records. It comes with a booklet that contains press clippings, unseen photographs and illustrations. A 75-minute DVD containing 7 music videos (fully restored) is also included in the box-set.\n\n\"George had lots of work lined up in 1999, but his priority was to reissue his entire catalog,\" said Olivia Harrison. \"He began that process by the remastering of All Things Must Pass in 2000. The Dark Horse Years were to follow. These songs are especially dear to me because they chronicle events in our life together. If you want to know what George was doing those years just listen to his music.\"\n\nOn March 15, 2004, George will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and will be later broadcasted on VH1 on March 21 between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m.\n\n----------------------------\n\nFebruary 20, 2004\n\nPossible forthcoming book on the '60s from artist Simon Posthuma (\"The Fool\")\n\nGood evening John,\n\nI just past by at your beautiful website on The Beatles, which I found through a link on Beatle City. Actually I was looking for works of the Dutch Simon Posthuma who painted John's Rolls in the Sixties. At present Simon Posthuma presents parts of his work in Zaandam, a viallage just north of Amersterdam / the Netherlands. With his girlfriend Marijke, he left the Netherlands 50 years ago to tour around and finally ended in London where he met The Beatles and (where) he started to work for their Apple Corp.\n\nDuring this week our national Radio 2, broadcasted the \"Week of the Sixties\", with lots of good music on The Beatles, Stones and many, many others, 24 hours a day during 5 days.\n\nDuring an interview which was aired last Thursday afternoon, I suddenly heard Simon Posthuma talking about his years in England, while working with and for The Beatles and so I learned that he returned to his native village Zaandam. He also announced that he would soon present a 350 pages new book on the Sixties.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCor van Breukelen\n\nPuch 66, Puch and Tomos club\n\nThe Netherlands\n\n----------------------------\n\nFebruary 19, 2004\n\nFree public celebration of George Harrison Day in L.A.\n\nThe City of Los Angeles has declared Sunday 22 February 2004 GEORGE HARRISON DAY.

She was 67.\n\nOriginally born as Doris Higgensen on January 6, 1937, in Bronx, New York, she was the daughter of a Baptist preacher where early on she was exposed to gospel music. Doris later abandoned gospel music in favor of the jazz group, the Halos. While honing her songwriting abilities, Doris Troy concentrated on background singing for artists such as Soloman Burke; Chuck Jackson; and The Drifters. By 1963, she co-penned \"Just One Look\" with her friend Gregory Carroll. While the song was only recorded by Doris in demo form, Juggy Murray of Sue Records who was presented with a copy of the song, failed to move on it. Determined to get \"Just One Look\" into the marketplace, she then approached Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records who decided to release the song exactly in its demo format...it ended being a major Top Ten hit in the USA. The song was then covered by the Hollies in 1964 and charted a the No. 2 spot turning \"Just One Look\" into a smash hit once again. (Incidentally, the composition has also been covered by Linda Ronstadt, Harry Nilsson and Bryan Ferry.)\n\nDoris Troy's soul career spanned 40 years. She moved to London in 1969 where she was soon signed on by Apple Records. In an earlier interview, Troy recalls how that came about: \"I got a call from Madeline Bell inviting me down to a recording session that Billy Preston was doing for Apple. George Harrison was producing \"That's the Way God Planned It\" and Billy and I agreed to write some songs together for his Apple album. That's when George asked me about my own ability to record. As it turned out, I wasn't signed to anyone. Within days, we had three agreements: one for me as an artist, one as a writer and one as a producer.\" Her debut album on Apple was simply entitled Doris Troy, was released in Nov. 9, 1970, in the USA featuring some big name performers in the rock music industry: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Bobby Keys; Peter Frampton, Ringo Starr to name just a few. While under contract with Apple, two singles were also released: Ain't That Cute and Jacob's Ladders. She was also backup singer for the following rock artists: Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\"; Carly Simon's \"You're So Vain\"; George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\"; The Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and Dusty Springfield's \"In the Middle of Nowhere\".\n\nIn March, 1983, a musical play based on Doris Troy's life entitled Mama, I Want To Sing, opened at the Heckscher Theatre in Harlem. The play was written by her sister Vy Higgensen and brother-in-law producer Ken Wydro. By 1984, Time magazine proclaimed the musical as one of New York's 10 best stage shows to be presented in the city. The non-Broadway musical, which saw Doris Troy casted in the role of her mother \"Geraldine\", was successful enough to take on the road across the USA between 1984 to 1998. In that time frame the musical also made appearances in London and Japan. The New York Times indicates that the \"show is to begin a 20th-annivesary run at Williams C.M.E. Church in Harlem\" on February 21, 2004.\n\n----------------------------\n\nFebruary 12, 2004\n\nCouple recall meeting not-so-fab Beatles\n\nIn a February 8th, e-mail correspondence to the Ottawa Beatle Site, Barbara Kaufman writes:\n\n\"I met the Beatles in approximately 1959 (the late 50's) in the Cavern Club. My husband played there frequently with a traditional (dixieland) jazz band called \"The Saints\" and the Beatles were one of the intermission bands, along with other local Liverpool bands i.e., Billy J. Kramer, Gerry and the Pacemakers etc., who were trying to make a name for themselves. In fact, I feel sure I spoke to them on their first gig at the Cavern.\"\n\nBoth Barbara and her husband Merton Kaufman were published by the London Free Press here in Canada. There are two articles on the same page: The first one deals with the 40th anniversary of the Beatles where the couple recall their fond memories on how the Beatles presented themselves during the Cavern days. The second article is a tribute to George Harrison which was published shortly after his passing.\n\nIt was Barbara and Merton's wish to have these articles published at the Ottawa Beatles Site and they hope you will enjoy reading them. We have archived their reports under \"Articles of Historical Interest\".\n\n----------------------------\n\nFebruary 7, 2004\n\n\"Beatles U.S. arrival anniversary\"\n\nNeena Chowdhury of the Canadian Press, interviews Ottawa Beatle Site proprietor, Tony Copple, on the 40th anniversary of \"Beatlemania\". Neena also interviews Bhesham Sharma, a music professor at the University of Western Ontario.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJanuary 31, 2004\n\nOn the eve of the 40th anniversary of \"Beatlemania\" and the Beatles invasion into the United States, on this date the Beatles Timeline has received 75,000 visitors! Thanks to one and all who have visited this Beatles time capsule.\n\nThe Beatles Timeline was launched in January, 2000.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJanuary 28, 2004\n\nCirque du Soleil to play in Las Vegas?\n\nReuters is reporting that the MGM Mirage Casino in Las Vegas has shown interest in having the Cirque du Soleil perform a theatrical version of \"Yellow Submarine\" that would replace illusionist Roy Horn who was critically injured last October after being mauled by a tiger.\n\nAlan Feldman, spokesperson for the MGM Mirage, claims that its \"fairly likely\" that the theatre troupe would perform at the Casino but the Cirque du Soleil has denied any deal with the Mirage casino concerning a Beatles show. The renewed interest from the Mirage goes back to 2001 when, according to Reuters, the \"Beatles' company, Apple Corp. Inc., confirmed in 2001 that a Cirque show in London was under consideration, but Beatle George Harrison, who was friends with Cirque Chief Executive Guy Laliberte, died shortly after that announcement and the show never materialized.\"\n\nThe Ottawa Beatle Site supports the Reuters position that George Harrison had a keen interest in seeing a theatrical play based on \"Yellow Submarine\" be performed by the Cirque du Soleil. According to local musician Robert Tremblay, who is a very big fan of George Harrison, had this to say in an e-mail to Ottawa Beatle Site proprietor, Tony Copple, dated 04/03/2003: \"I was wondering if you were aware of the fact that George Harrison came to Montreal during the Grand Prix racing car, in June 2001. He was also there to negotiate the leasing of the copyright of Yellow Submarine to Le Cirque du Soleil. He attended a party at Guy Latraverse's house (well known Montreal producer), where he played guitar with professional musicians of the Montreal scene. He also met Robert Marchand, CEO of Musique Plus (music video channel). I hold this information from an interview given at Radio Canada on behalf G.H. death in November 2001.\"\n\nSome time has now passed since George Harrison's death and it would be a nice tribute to George if Apple records were to provide some renewed interest and leadership in making this project become a reality. The Cirque du Soleil has showcased some very entertaining theatrical productions even to a point where they have been captured on film and released on DVD: Journey of Man; Saltimbanco; Dralion; La Nouba; Quidam; O; Verakai and Mystere. If a theatrical version of \"Yellow Submarine\" were done by the Cirque, one ponders what financial rewards might come if it were later released on a DVD? Certainly this idea of a theatrical production and the contracts that George Harrison was preparing at the time with the Cirque is worth looking into once again.\n\n----------------------------\n\nJanuary 24, 2004\n\nGive Peace A Dance interview with Yoko Ono\n\nWe're pleased to see that the Ottawa Beatles Site isn't the only publisher that feels that John Lennon and Yoko Ono's peace activities from 1969 became just one of several factors that led to the eventual ending of the Vietnam War. This months publication of Rhythm magazine has a report filed by Jeff Tamarkin who makes a similar claim: \"John and Yoko...campaigned for peace together. Just how effective their efforts may have ultimately been in turning the tide against the Vietnam War we might never really know. But make no mistake: they did have an impact.\" Tamarkin goes on stating that by John and Yoko's peace bed-in's at Amsterdam and Montreal where they ended up recording and releasing the timeless peace anthem, Give Peace A Chance, the couple had become, in effect, \"masters of the staged media event.\"\n\nThe feature article for the magazine provides a very basic but excellent overview of the life and times of Yoko Ono. It also includes a small interview with Ms. Ono along with some very touching photography work of the avant-garde artist done by Jeffrey Apoian.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nJanuary 16, 2004\n\nDr. Gilbert Lederman and Harrison family settle guitar dispute\n\nOnly 10 days after the Harrison family had filed a $10 million federal lawsuit against Dr. Gilbert Lederman of having coerced George Harrison in his last remaining days to sign an autograph on his son's guitar, the doctor has now agreed through his attorney that the signed guitar \"will be disposed of privately,\" writes Reuters press.\n\nThe suit had alleged that Lederman held Harrison's hand as the musician wrote his name on the guitar \"with great effort and much obvious discomfort\" even though the failing rock star had initially resisted such a request. Harrison was also forced to sign his name on two cards for two of Lederman's daughters but the settlement now reached will include also include having the doctor dispose of them privately.\n\nThe settlement, announced in a Brooklyn courtroom before U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis, acknowledges that the medical treatment by Lederman was not an issue in this particular claim. The agreement also cites that the Harrison family, in return, will give a new guitar to Ariel Lederman as a replacement. Ariel, the 14-year-old son of the doctor, was the owner of the guitar that has Harrison's signature on it.\n\nBeatle photo exhibit now in Smithsonian Museum\n\nA photo presentation entitled: \"The Beatles! Backstage and Behind the Scenes\" will be on display at the Smithsonian Museum at the institutions \"National Museum of American History\".

It has been organized Vickie Rehberg, president of ArtVision Exhibitions of Baca Ration, Florida.\n\nThe photo collection was previously viewed at the Provincial Museum of Alberta in Edmonton and there are ideas that Italy might be the next stop for this photo display.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nJanuary 14, 2004\n\nAnother Grammy award for the Beatles\n\nOn this date, the Recording Academy announces that the hit song, Let It Be, will be inducted into the \"Grammy Hall of Fame.\"\n\n-----------------------------\n\nJanuary 12, 2004\n\nEarly book sales of: \"The Beatles: The Investigation of a Myth (1960 - 1962)\" by Eric Krasker exceeds author's expectations!\n\nHi John!\n\nFirst, I would like to wish you and Tony Copple a happy new year 2004, full of \"new\" Beatle material.\n\nThe book is a real success in France where it already sold a few thousand (I've heard something like 6-8000 copies, and it's only a beginning). It's a good thing when you know that the Beatles are really not a priority in French culture!\n\nWarmest Regards,\n\nEric\n\nPretty impressive sales figures for the first three months, Eric! Especially in light of the fact that France is the only country where this book is being published at this time. Hopefully, Eric, you'll soon find an American publisher...certainly these sales figures can only help advance your cause in getting your excellent Beatle book out into the North American marketplace.

I play bass with Randy Bachman's Band and happened by your post. Lot's of great work on your site. A friend of mine who hasn't played since the early sixties (he's a property developer now) played at the Cavern at the same time as the big boys. His band was called \"The Karacters\" and they have a prestigious spot on the wall in the new cavern. He has told me that he wants to regroup his old band while they're all still alive and rehearse to play a couple of the old venues (including the fabled Cavern - which I've yet to visit), and he wants me to play drums (the drummer's too weak these days). The fact that I haven't played drums in over twenty years still makes me fairly up to snuff in his eyes...lol.\n\nI played with a Beatles Show called Revolver for a bit, and on two occasions we were escorted to the stage in THE Rolls Royce....quite a buzz!!!\n\nI also have a picture that I found in a book, of my wife at a very young age in Maple Leaf Gardens sitting directly behind the Beatles Stage - where her 'front row' tickets were. Broke her heart at the time apparently, until I dug up the photo and had it blown up framed for her.\n\nKeep on doing it - it's great to have a passion isn't it?\n\nCheers,\n\nMick\n\nThank you Mick, for your kind words and for also sharing with us some of your own Beatle recollections...the Cavern gig sounds definitely like a great idea! Give us an update if you decide to go over and we'll post it here for fans to read.\n\nTo learn more about Mick Dalla-Vee's musical background, please visit his excellent website at: http://www.mickdallavee.com/ and for information on Randy Bachman of B.T.O.
