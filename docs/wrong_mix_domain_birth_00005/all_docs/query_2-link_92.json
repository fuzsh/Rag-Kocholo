        "text": "There’s this white guy who used to be my driver. He would pick me up at my apartment, at 123rd Street and Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem, and carry me into the music-business world of midtown Manhattan. It was 1991. I had recently served as the female voice of Public Enemy, the political black-nationalist hip-hop band, and now I was finishing up my first solo CD for Epic Records. The white people I usually encountered were power brokers and decision makers who could take a girl like me, package her talent, and offer her a seat on top of the world—or dismiss her into the valley of obscurity. So this chauffeur was just about the only working-class white guy I could claim to know.\n\nMost of the time, I liked to ride in silence. But one night the driver interrupted my thoughts to ask, “Do you know Mary?”\n\n“No,” I answered dryly.\n\n“I’m surprised,” he said. “Mary J. Blige is going to be a big star. I drive for her, too. The other night, she let me hear one of her songs when I took her home from the studio. Her music is great. But what I like most is that she’s really nice—just a nice person. In my world that matters. I meet a lot of nasty people.” He glanced at me in the rearview mirror and I smiled politely, not wanting to be tossed into the “nasty” pit.\n\nNot long afterward, I went to the Impact Conference in Atlantic City—an annual gathering of musicians and music-industry heads—and ran into a group of young black men wearing T-shirts that read “Mary J. Blige—The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.” Damn, that’s a big title to give anyone, I thought, but it didn’t mean that much to me.\n\nSean (Puffy) Combs in a Mary J. Blige T-shirt—that meant something to me. He was the director of A. & R. at Uptown Records then, but I had known him since he was a student at Howard University. While other students had become activists or jockeyed for positions in sororities and fraternities, Puffy had emerged as a promoter who could pull in the top stars of the moment—from Heavy D. or Doug E. Fresh to Public Enemy. He had quickly earned a reputation as someone who always knew who was hot and who was not.\n\n“We’re showcasing Mary today, Souljah,” he told me with a smile and a certain confidence. “Stop through and check her out.” I was surprised, honestly, to see him and Uptown’s street team so enthusiastic about a young woman’s talent. I had never seen guys, popular guys, so united and solid around a female performer—not MC Lyte, or Queen Latifah, or any young sister, for that matter. Even the man who was my date at Impact—and who later became my husband—was excited about the showcase, where Mary J. Blige would receive her formal introduction to the industry. So, in the spirit of a true ghetto girl who’d rather have the attention for herself, I persuaded him to skip it with me.\n\nIt didn’t matter that I had forfeited that chance to hear Mary J. Blige. Weeks later, her voice shot across the country with the release of the single “You Remind Me,” from the soundtrack of the movie “Strictly Business.” The song combined R. & B. with unrelenting hip-hop, heavy beats with the clean, clear, sincere voice of Mary J. Blige—marrying two forms of music that had had a notoriously hostile relationship for years—at a level of innovation that no one had seen since Teddy Riley introduced new jack swing. It became a huge underground hit. Blige was only twenty years old at the time and she brought something fresh and soft into an arena that had been dominated by competing hardcore male m.c.s. Hip-hop audiences had grown used to the gangster tales of the rap group Niggaz Wit’ Attitude (N.W.A.), whose hit “Fuck tha Police” went multi-platinum. They had been politicized by the revolutionary and ultra-masculine rhymes of Chuck D in Public Enemy. And no hip-hop audience had missed the merciless and skillful rhymes of Ice-Cube, then affiliated with the Nation of Islam, who put out the explosive hit “AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted.” Mary J. Blige addressed the same audience, and it embraced her, her music, her lyrics.\n\nIt soon came to my attention through industry chitchat that this girl was “the real thing.” She had been born in the Bronx, in 1971, and grew up in the housing projects of Yonkers. Before hip-hop, living in the projects had been a source of shame. But now it was a litmus test, a testament to legitimacy, a badge of honor, even. The project Mary lived in was called Slow Bomb, and she sang like she came from there—like she knew it was either make this song work for her or share the fate of hundreds of youths whose bios all read the same: ghettos, single parents, poverty, frustration, poor education, loneliness, and, ultimately, so-called self-destruction.\n\nAs a girl, Blige sang in school talent shows and sometimes in the church her mother required her to attend. Then, as a teen-ager, she recorded a cover of Anita Baker’s “Caught Up in the Rapture,” in a karaoke booth at a local mall, not expecting to do anything with it. But her mother’s boyfriend handed the tape to a friend, Jeff Redd, who was then an artist on the Uptown Records roster. Redd passed it to an executive at Uptown, who called Blige in and offered her the recording deal that would change her life.\n\nIn early 1992, I was sitting in a car with the same white driver when the first single from Mary J. Blige’s début album, “What’s the 411?,” hit the airwaves. “Real Love” silenced the skeptics who’d thought Blige a one-hit wonder. The lyrics were sensitive and soulful, yet her voice was powerful—it rode on top of, behind, beside, and under the beats of Audio Two’s “Top Billin’.”\n\nLike many ghetto girls who battle for the love of the few surviving available, sane black men, I wanted to see what Mary J. Blige looked like. Given the tremendous influence of hip-hop in the black community, I knew that we would all be compared with her. So I surfed Video Music Box, BET, and MTV looking for the “Real Love” video. When it finally premièred, my apprehensions were confirmed. Mary was beautiful. She was big-boned yet shapely, with a classic round African behind, a small waist, and comfortable wide hips. As I looked at her tight pants and her combat boots, I thought, Hey, that’s me. That’s all of us. Mary reps for us, and she’s making us all look good.\n\nWhile I was battling my own Presidential-size political problems in the potent Public Enemy era of the early nineties, I heard Mary’s voice cutting through it all, singing about love, loss, and abuse. She was surprisingly unafraid to link herself to the powerless position of a woman led by emotion and then washed away by betrayal. Even the songs she chose to cover—Rose Royce’s “I’m Goin’ Down” and Chaka Khan’s “Sweet Thing”—told stories of women who were faithful to careless, callous, or sometimes sadistic men. The issues she sang about carried a lot of weight in African-American communities, where, unless we rediscovered love and family, we stood to lose many of the gains of the civil-rights movement.\n\nMary J. Blige was not a revolutionary. She was not a Harriet Tubman or an Angela Davis. But, over the next six years and four albums, she did what many other divas had failed to do. She found success in the music business without “biting,” or imitating anyone else’s style. She kept her rough voice; she exposed her own vulnerable heart; she pronounced her words in unashamed black English and she danced her unchoreographed, unladylike steps with class. Urban kids elevated Blige for “keeping it real.” When she didn’t want to see people, she said so. When she wasn’t in the mood to talk, she told you to back up out of her face. For this frankness, she was sometimes accused of having a bad attitude. The press labelled her “difficult,” dogged her for showing up late to interviews, cussing like a sailor, or offering bold responses to their questions. But magazine and newspaper stories about Mary J. Blige getting kicked out of her mother’s apartment when she was fifteen, dropping out of school, and experimenting with alcohol and drugs did not diminish her audience. They only broadened it. The essence of hip-hop is, after all, to express through rhyme and music the realities of youth in America.\n\nThese days, after a long line of poor managers and questionable deals and a difficult and abusive long-term relationship, Blige has come into her own. She has gradually detached herself from the talented yet parasitic partners she chose early in her career. She has also separated her business from Puffy Combs and is standing alone, musically and financially. She has done this at a price. Her fan base is huge, but she no longer has the marketing excitement that comes with an affiliation with the ringmaster Combs. Still, Blige has grown tremendously with each album. Her fifth and latest, released last month and entitled simply “Mary,” features duets with Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Eric Clapton, and Lauryn Hill. It also includes a duet with K-Ci, formerly of the group Jodeci, who was Mary’s lover for nearly three years and rumored to be the source of much of the storm in her life.\n\nBlige and I crossed paths briefly on a few occasions after I first missed her at Impact, but each time I was afforded only a glimpse. Finally, in the heat wave of last July, I spent some time with the “Queen of Hip-Hop Soul” at a restaurant in midtown Manhattan. My husband was with me, ostensibly to record the conversation, but we both knew the real reason he was there—millions of men in America would kill to sit at the same table as Blige. Her hair was earth-red, her skin milk-chocolate brown. She was the star, yet she was the one who was nervous. Her perfectly manicured nails fumbled with the menu. She was guarded, but very openly aware—perhaps too aware—of her own imperfections.\n\n“I got to know myself a lot better,” she said of her eight-year career. “I accept the things that I thought were so ugly and not right. I accept the way I speak. I accept not finishing high school. I accept a lot.”\n\nI questioned her use of the word “ugly,” which seemed incompatible with the woman in front of me.\n\n“It’s a private world behind closed doors that I really don’t like to talk about but I sing about,” she said. “It comes from the mouths of those people who are close to you who are supposed to love you.” Press Blige to name names and she won’t. This is the code of the projects: you don’t discuss the specifics with strangers. Whatever you say may be used against you. Blige admitted to the excesses, drugs, and alcohol abuse of the past, but she didn’t elaborate, saying simply, “My depression is over. My substance abuse is done.” When I mentioned that many music reporters have likened her to the late Billie Holiday, she rejected the comparison immediately, thinking that people make it only because of Holiday’s drug use. But if anything was clear from our conversation it was that Mary’s victimization was over. “Long ago, it was easy to do the wrong thing,” she told me. “Now I really know my limits. I know how friendly to be and who to be friendly with.”\n\nWe spoke of favorite performers, and she cited Michael Jackson, who she said brought happiness into her childhood. I asked whether any people had seen her collaboration with Elton John as a crossover, and she dismissed the question. She recorded the song, she said, because when she was young her father had played Elton John at home and she dug it. “I wanted to invite Elton into Mary’s world,” she added forcefully. “In the studio he was comfortable with us.”\n\nWhat was the happiest moment in her career, I asked. We sat still for minutes. Finally, she said, “The day I realized I did not have to live for the music business. I mean, I’m in it, but not of it.” ♦"
