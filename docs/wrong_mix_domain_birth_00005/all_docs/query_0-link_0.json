        "text": "There's a song on Mary J Blige's eighth album, Growing Pains, entitled 'Grown Woman', a hymn to self-respect, dignity and the kind of confidence that comes with maturity and self-knowledge. 'I wear these Seven jeans, but baby they don't wear me/I keep it covered up 'cause I'm a lady,' she asserts, and certainly the 37-year-old woman sitting before me in the hotel room high above Park Lane seems to have found a grace and poise a million miles away from her once-formidable diva reputation. Dressed discreetly in a cerise sweater, tight jeans (Seven, presumably) and boots, she pauses frequently to swipe her thick caramel fringe away from her wide almond eyes, and smiles. Her eye contact is still tentative but she often used to wear sunglasses for interviews, so this seems like progress. Today she looks every inch a sophisticated, mature woman who has grown into her beauty and accepted herself. Given that her songs always provide such a transparent running commentary on each stage of her life, is 'Grown Woman' the song that best tells us how the 'Queen of Hip-Hop/Soul' feels about herself in 2008?\n\n'Uh-uh,' she says, shaking her head. 'That would be \"Work in Progress\", that's definitely it.' This is one of the most personal songs on the album, a warning to onlookers not to imagine that, just because she has dramatically turned her life around in the past few years, this means she has it all sewn up. 'Take one more look, past my celebrity/That's where you'll find the real me/To you do I still look complete?' it asks, and goes on: 'Just like you, sometimes I get down, sometimes I want to cry, sometimes I get depressed'.\n\n'This music business can suck all the love out of you,' she says earnestly, 'all the compassion for people - you can start to think you're better than them. But I want to continue to let people know that I'm no better and no worse, I'm just like you.'\n\nYet she seems happy, I say, she seems ... together is the word that comes most readily to mind. She looks pleased, erupting into one of her unexpected bursts of warm, melodic laughter.\n\n'Well, I am, because it's such a new place for me, but you have no idea how hard I have to work to continue being here. When you come from so many damaged places you don't ever want to spiral back there, so you gotta continue to check yourself. You have to make sure that one drink is not turning into 20 drinks, or that you're not even thinking about going back to drugs, or that you continue not to react and get angry. But it's how you respond that determines how it's going to be.'\n\nMary J Blige has never shied away from sharing her most painful experiences, both in her music and in print, and it is partly this willingness to step off the pedestal reserved for icons that has endeared her to fans. Seven years ago, as she entered her thirties, she was already a multi-platinum-selling R&B legend, at the top of her business and living the whole ghetto-fabulous dream, festooned in statement jewellery and a riot of designer labels, spending every night high on drink and cocaine, surrounded by hangers-on eager to get a piece of the lifestyle her money provided. She became notorious for her demands, her tantrums and, famously, for once allegedly threatening to punch an interviewer. But all the bling masked a mess of self-hatred and a self-destructive streak that was leading her to destroy her greatest gift - that extraordinary voice. At one point she was smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a night to counter the effects of all the cocaine she was taking. Wouldn't fans have been amazed to know that someone who appeared to have made it so big could hate their life so much?\n\n'People know what they see but they don't know what's happening inside,' she says firmly. 'If you want to know who you are and how you feel about yourself, take a look at your environment. And my environment then was telling me that I hated myself. All the things I was doing, the hanging out late late late, always looking in the mirror and thinking I was ugly inside and out, the people I hung out with. Those people didn't really like me or care about me, and they were causing me to lose my career. They were the reason I didn't make it to interviews on time, they were all getting paid but they didn't want to tell me what I should be doing because they were all scared to lose the chance of hanging around Mary J Blige the superstar. And there's not one of those people who's around me today,' she adds, with emphasis.\n\nIt was only when she met the man who is now her husband, music producer Kendu Isaacs, that she finally found someone prepared to tell it to her straight, but the desire to change the life she was living pre-dated meeting him. 'Before all of that, it was prayer,' she says. 'Even when I was drinking and getting high, I knew there was a God. So one day I started to pray - I just said: God, you gotta send me somebody to help me because I'm tired of living like this but I don't want to die.'\n\nWas that a real fear? She nods slowly.\n\n'People started dying around me - like, one of my beautiful girlfriends is dead today because of something she was dealing with and then someone I knew in the music business died [the singer Aaliyah] and then the World Trade Center blew up and I was like: \"OK, I'm next!\" I seriously thought I was going to go.'\n\nMeeting Isaacs might have given her the impetus and the support to believe she could change her life, but the reality was not straightforward. For a start, he made her look with new eyes at the people she considered her friends.\n\n'He wasn't mean about it, he was just like: \"Do you see that?\" Those simple words: \"Do you see that? What makes you think she likes you? She's just spending your money.\"' She offers one story as an example. 'There was one time I went to a club with these people, and I thought everyone was paying for their own drinks. Then I got the receipt for the drinks and I was like: \"Oh, I guess I'm paying for the drinks then.\" Then we went to get our cars from the parking lot and they had all put their cars on my ticket. My security guard went back and told my husband and he was just like -' she adopts a gently admonishing, parental tone - '\"I told you.\" And to be challenged like that - it hurts, because you're in denial, you want to believe that people are your friends.'\n\nIt must have been isolating, then, to walk away from that lifestyle definitively?\n\n'When I said I'm not drinking any more, I'm not hanging out any more - it was almost like people ran away from me.' She keeps her voice neutral but looks away when she says this, her eyes downcast. 'They just vanished, and it hurt me really, really bad because there was a point where I believed those people loved and liked me, I really did. And that's devastation - but for me it's a little easier, I know how to turn off from the world and go into a hole and stay there by myself; I know how to do that and it hurts, but I'll do it just to survive.'\n\nThis disappearing act was her means of surviving a childhood and adolescence that these days would be the stuff of bestselling memoirs. Mary Jane Blige grew up in the housing projects of Yonkers, north of New York, surrounded by drugs and crime. Her musician father, Thomas, left the family when she was four; her mother Cora, who was 17 when Mary was born, worked long hours in a series of jobs. Then, at the age of five, Mary was sexually abused by a friend of her mother's, something she was unable to talk about for years, until her journey of reinvention began.\n\n'I saw that I was insecure and I hated myself, and I was like: \"OK, why?\" And when I tried to find out why, not to go into all those details but it goes back to the time when I was a five-year-old kid and I realised: this is not my fault. I can't undo what they did, but I owe it to myself to make my life better.'\n\nBut surely, amid all this talk of forgiveness and acceptance, she must resent what was done to her, the person who did it and those who turned a blind eye or failed to help her?\n\n'I believe everything happened for a reason and I would not trade my life, because if it didn't happen I would not be this person who continues to seek to be free, who continues to want to learn to be better, to love people better.'\n\nShe speaks consistently in these pre-fab phrases of evangelical self-help, though she is proud that she never went through therapy, either to get off drugs or to deal with her emotional issues, and fought her own demons through sheer force of will, together with her new-found faith and support from her husband and mentors at the church. But behind the jargon, there is a simple sincerity in the way she speaks about her past.\n\nIt is clearly hard for her to talk about what happened to her as a child, though she has been astonished by the degree to which her revelations have affected other people's lives.\n\n'Every time I walk out the door, everywhere I go, people are like: \"Mary, you saved my life, you saved my marriage, you helped me get out of an abusive relationship, you helped me get off drugs.\" And it's amazing but it's like: oh my goodness, this is a responsibility, this is not a game - I have to take it seriously.'\n\nDoes she feel a pressure to be a role model?\n\n'I cannot save the world, that's not what I'm trying to do. I guess I'm just trying to walk the walk and be an example to those that want it. Not everybody does, but if Mary J Blige can come out of that same hole you were in, then you can do it too - that's my goal: to do that without saying it, but actually live it.'\n\nThe one moment when her emotions catch her off guard is when I ask if she remembers the first time she realised that music could transform the way she felt, lift her out of her unhappiness momentarily. A memory is triggered and those beautiful, feline eyes well for a second with tears.\n\n'It was Soul II Soul - \"Keep on Movin\". Oh my, I'm about to cry,' she says, running a finger under her lashes to protect her careful make-up. 'When I first heard that record there was something about it that let me know we were going to get out of that situation and get out of the projects and something was going to change. I'm just hearing it in my mind' - she pauses, and disappears inward for a moment, then smiles and nods - 'the first part, the \"It's our time\"... I remember thinking: it's our time, that means something's going to happen for us.'\n\nWhen the break came, it happened unexpectedly. She always knew her voice was exceptional, 'but I thought I was a needle in a haystack; like, what are the chances of somebody like me getting out, getting into the music business? It was so far-fetched, but then sometimes I'd listen to myself singing and it would just make me feel good. And I knew the things other artists could do - Tina Marie and Anita Baker - I could do those things, too.'\n\nIn fact, it was imitating Anita Baker on a karaoke version of 'Caught Up in the Rapture', recorded for a laugh at the local mall when she was 17, that launched her career. Through her mother's then boyfriend, the tape found its way to Andre Harrell at Uptown Records, who signed her. In 1992, when she was 21, her debut album What's the 411? was produced by Sean Coombs (later to become P Diddy) and went triple platinum.\n\nAs her career began to soar, her personal life grew increasingly tumultuous. For six years she was involved in a relationship with K-Ci Hailey, frontman of R&B quartet Jodeci, which she has repeatedly described as abusive. That, added to the memories of her childhood, left her with some serious hang-ups when it came to trusting men. Then, just at the time she began praying for God to send her some help, she met the man who would become her husband. When I ask her how they met, something of the grown woman's poise melts and a girlish softness comes over her face; though they had their fourth wedding anniversary last December, Blige still takes as much pleasure in talking about her man as any teenager after a first date.\n\n'I was doing a duet with Queen Latifah and he'd been producing her for years, so I walked into the studio and he was there,' she begins breathlessly, 'and I thought nothing except that he was cute. But he must have been questioning her about me because later she called and said they wanted to come to the show, and they came and later we all went to the club and he was all, like: \"You looked really good on stage\", and he was sitting there talking to me.' She beams widely at the memory. There was just one problem - Isaacs was already in a relationship, with children.\n\n'There was one night we hung out and after that I got really sad because I realised he was my husband. And I said, \"You know what, all the good men are always taken,\" because I thought he belonged to someone else, and I said, \"It's sad that you're my husband and I can't even have you.\" And it was the craziest thing I had ever felt in my whole life, and he felt it too, but he had other things he had to fix in his life and I just let him go.' She pauses. 'I said: \"I don't want to wreck your home and whatever you have going on with your children and your woman, so I'm going to get out of here,\" and I believed that he would find me.'\n\nThen she seems to backtrack slightly. 'But it turns out his relationship was already over, that's why he was out talking to other women, but I kept running because I thought: you're not going to hurt me. But the last time we found each other, that was it - he couldn't stay away from me, I couldn't stay away from him, he made his decision. I had to make him make a decision because I didn't want to hurt her either. I try to think about the next woman - you're not going to hurt both of us, so if one of us hurts then at least we're going to know the truth, so go figure that out. And the rest is history.'\n\nIt must have been hard, with her experiences, to believe this was something different?\n\n'I was clueless, but I just knew he looked at me in a way no other man has ever looked at me - it was like this look of concern, like \"Are you all right?\", kind of fatherly.' She giggles. 'It was like: wow, he really cares. And I don't care what kind of terrible relationship you've been in, who hasn't treated you right - when someone walks into your life and shows that kind of concern, you know when it's real. I never had that before, and I still ran because I didn't know for sure - I thought he might just be a great actor, but when it's real it tells you the truth here.' She bangs a fist across her chest.\n\nThese days, between work commitments, she and Isaacs live a quiet life in their exclusive corner of New Jersey (their neighbours are Chris Rock and Denzel Washington), though the best part of this year is going to be spent touring with Jay-Z. Now she's 37, does she have any plans to have a family?\n\n'I do have a family, I have my stepchildren,' she says, almost affronted. 'As far as having my own child, that's not something that's on my list to do right now, but I definitely would like to take time out, to walk away for about three years and say whatever happens, happens - if I get pregnant and have a baby, great. Although ... three years, I don't know. I think I'll go crazy!'\n\nMaybe she could combine a career and motherhood, I suggest.\n\n'All this,' she gestures to the hotel room, the paraphernalia of the publicity whirl. 'This would be too much for a child. I'm not going to be able to give it my undivided attention and I don't want to have a nanny, I don't want the child growing up thinking the nanny is its mother, so I definitely would need time. I don't know when that might happen, that's something we just can't say.'\n\nIn the meantime, she is busy loving life. Growing Pains has sold more than 2m copies worldwide and is still riding high in the Billboard album charts, and in December she won two Grammies out of three nominations, taking her career total to eight. There's the tour with Jay-Z, and she's also slated to play Nina Simone in a biopic of the jazz singer, though this is a project that has been talked about for some time. 'I have the script now,' she says, 'but as far as the production goes, I just don't know - when I know, you'll know.' The possibility of more acting work interests her, but she says: 'I've got to get more comfortable in my own skin first, you know what I'm saying?'\n\nThis project, the project of becoming Mary J Blige, is the real work in progress, but it's one that is making her happy, and this sense that she is finally in the right place and happy to be there is palpable in everything she says.\n\n'I have never thought so clearly and seen life so crystal clear in my life,' she says, smiling almost shyly. 'The way I was - I would never want to go back there again. I love to be able to be a woman and be powerful through being kind and even being vulnerable. That's hard at the end of the day but I can see all the things I need to do, and I love being a grown woman - to me that's a lot of fun.'\n\nWhat about the downsides of maturity? Would she, for example, ever consider surgery? She hoots with laughter.\n\n'Not me, I don't care! I'm already old. Older, so I'm OK. I'll turn 40 or 50 and still be OK, I think. Now I'm not killing myself over vanity, I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do - you're supposed to want to exercise and get dressed and look nice but it becomes obsession when you're running to the clinic to get your lips bigger or you're looking at some chick on a magazine, you know what I'm saying? You gotta be smart about it. The older I get, the more I pull back. I got my man - as long as he's happy. And the day he's not happy -' she grins and shrugs. 'Well, I still gotta be happy with what I got.'\n\nLong may she continue to be happy with herself. After all her struggles, Mary J Blige is proving that her power to affect people goes beyond her musical talent; she is making her life into something inspirational. Who, you have to wonder, would be up to playing her in the film of her life, except Mary J herself?"
