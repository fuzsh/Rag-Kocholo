Former Strictly Come Dancing winner Jill Halfpenny has given birth to her first child.

The actress, who starred in EastEnders and Waterloo Road, welcomed son Harvey Reece on May 3.

Husband Craig Conway said the couple had kept the news a secret for the last three weeks to give them time to adjust to the new arrival.

He told the Daily Express: "We are really proud of our baby. We won't do anything for a [while] because we just want to get settled."

Harvey weighed in at 6lb 8oz and both mother and baby are said to be well.

The pair, who live in Northumberland, married in 2007 after dating for five years.
