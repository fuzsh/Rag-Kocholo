        "text": "Everyone knows a girl like Sloane. She was always The Single One. She never brought a plus-one to weddings. She was the woman you’d set up with your single cousin. She joined ballroom dancing classes to meet men and was the queen of online dating.\n\nBut then she met Myles. Perfect Myles, with denim-blue eyes and a dazzling smile that melted her insides. She’d finally found The One.\n\nExcept she didn’t imagine that Myles’s idea of Happy Ever After would include Sloane battling an overflowing laundry basket, buying birthday cards for his family, and ironing his Calvin Klein underpants.\n\nThen Sloane finds out that Myles has a secret.\n\nThe fairy tale is well and truly over. Her heart is blown to smithereens. Eating her weight in Ben & Jerry’s and large Meat Feast pizzas can only get Sloane so far before she has to make a decision… Can she learn to love herself more than she loved the love of her life?\n\nMy Review\n\nDating is a serious business. Of course it has to be fun too, but every first date might be the start of the rest of your life, so it’s only natural that you are often put off by the shallowness of some people.\n\nSuddenly, when you least expect it, there he is : The One. He turns your world upside down and if he would ask you to follow him to the end of the world, you would not hesitate one single moment. You love him, you trust him, you are on cloud nine.\n\nThere is no doubt in your mind that this will last for ever and ever, right?\n\nThis is a story that has put a smile on my face due some little quips here and there but certainly due to the love you felt between the characters when they needed someone the most, but it also made my eyes well up because of the sadness that people can create whether it is deliberate or not.\n\nCan you remain friends with someone who used a sledgehammer to crush your heart? No, not a chance, but you once loved them dearly and somehow they will always remain special. It’s not easy to forget and get over bad times, but it’s equally impossible to erase the good times. 5 stars\n\nThank you, Sophie Ranald and Bookouture.\n\nAbout the author\n\nSophie Ranald is the youngest of five sisters. She was born in Zimbabwe and lived in South Africa until an acute case of itchy feet brought her to London in her mid-20s. As an editor for a customer publishing agency, Sophie developed her fiction-writing skills describing holidays to places she’d never visited. In 2011, she decided to disregard all the good advice given to aspiring novelists and attempt to write full-time. After one false start, It Would Be Wrong to Steal My Sister’s Boyfriend (Wouldn’t It?) seemed to write itself. Her second, third and fourth novels followed. Sophie also writes for magazines and online about food, fashion, finance and running. She lives in south-east London with her amazing partner Hopi and Purrs, their adorable little cat.\n\nAuthor Links\n\nWebsite: sophieranald.com\n\nTwitter: @SophieRanald\n\nFacebook:www.facebook.com/SophieRanald\n\nBook Links\n\nAmazon: https://geni.us/B07Z415G92Social\n\nApple: https://apple.co/2IR02ri\n\nKobo: http://bit.ly/2qfvHwa"
