        "text": "This year was my 50th Year of Pantomimes- Every single year since 1974 up to the most recent Pantomime in 2023-2024\n\nIve listed every Pantomime- and the cast and creatives that made it happen. From Playing Animals in Panto to teaming up with the incredible Peter Robbins- for twenty-eight years-with Both Paul Elliott and then Nick Thomas and Michael Harrison- to playing solo Dame.\n\nIts a journey through Pantomimes and some of the amazing people Ive met on the way. It starts at the beginning, so you can fast forward or pause as you wish!\n\nGrowing up in Swansea I was fortunate to spend a lot of time at The Swansea Grand Theatre.My Brother Vivyan was House Manager, and John Chilvers was the Administrator.As a child and as a teenager I was able to watch many Swansea Grand pantomimes over the years from both auditorium and backstage.\n\nThe biggest Pantomime influence on me was Freddie Lees. Freddie often played Dame at The Grand and was comedy lead in the weekly Rep seasons at the time, Along with Jean Fergusson, Eleanor Thomas, and Vivienne Moore.\n\nI was also fortunate to belong to The Swansea Youth Theatre - some of the Grands Rep actors had started their careers with the SYT, and that was where I appeared in my very first Pantomime at the Llewellyn Hall. John Griffiths was in The Youth Theatre and I did a few Pantos with him.\n\nWhen I went to College to study Drama and English at Carmarthen, one of the projects I got involved in was a touring pantomime- Dick Whittington where at the age of eighteen I was Sarah The Cook, and I appeared in this with (now Doctor) Chris Abbott as part of the Drama course! The seeds were set.\n\nI already had my Provisional Equity card before I went to college, gained through parts in television for HTV and BBC Wales, and through variety in clubs. A few months after finishing college in 1974 I auditioned for The Welsh Nation Opera & Drama Company, and got my first tour that led to the first Panto style season at Cardiffs Sherman Theatre.- Enjoy!\n\n2021 Hull New Theatre\n\nPresented by Anton du Beke with a framed collection of some of my Dame photos from 50 years while onstage at Woking this year (2024) - From Michael Harrison and all at Crossroads Pantomimes!\n\nPanto 1974-75 Panto 1975-76 Panto 1976-77 Panto 1977-78 Panto 1978-79 Panto 1979-80 Panto 1980-81 Panto 1981-82 Panto 1982-83 Panto 1983-84 Panto 1984-85 Panto 1985-86 Panto 1986-87 Panto 1987-88 Panto 1988-89 Panto 1989-90 Panto 1990-91 Panto 1991-92 Panto 1992-93 Panto 1993-94 Panto 1994-95 Panto 1995-96 Panto 1996-97 Panto 1997-98 Panto 1998-99 Panto 1999-2000 Panto 2000-01 Panto 2001-02 Panto 2002-03 Panto 2003-04 Panto 2004-05 Panto 2005-06 Panto 2006-07 Panto 2007-08 Panto 2008-09 Panto 2009-10 Panto 2010-11 Panto 2011-12 Panto 2012-13 Panto 2013-14 Panto 2014-15 Panto 2015-16 Panto 2016-17 Panto 2017-18 Panto 2018-19 Panto 2019-20 Panto 2020-21 Panto 2021-22 Panto 2022-23 UK Pantomime Awards 2022 Panto 2023-24 The Pantomime Roadshow Pantoland The Brick Lane Pantomimes Weakest Link 2004 & Cover Girls! The V&A Display\n\nPANTO 1974-75\n\nTouring 1974 then Sherman Theatre Cardiff Jan 2nd-Jan 11th 1975\n\nWelsh National Opera Drama Co\n\nGAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT\n\nNigel Ellacott, Hilary Gilman, Patrick Salvadori, Richard Morse, Antony McDonald, Mathew Scurfield, Elspeth Walker\n\nDirected by Elspeth Walker, Written by David Snodin. Music by Stephen Oliver. Designed by Iona Macleish.\n\nThe Welsh National Opera company created a Drama division, and this show, based on the Knights of The Round Table, was chosen to tour schools and centres, and played the Sherman Theatre straight after Christmas. We toured it for four months prior to the Sherman.\n\nNigel as Sir Gawain\n\nI played Sir Gawain, and the play had panto elements- A Villain- The Green Knight, who gets his head chopped off and keeps walking around, , a wicked Witch, a jester, King Arthur, a love interest, and a few woodland animals thrown in. The Music was by Stephen Oliver, a hugely talented composer who went on to write for major Opera Companies and the National Theatre. His 50 Operas, included Timon Of Athens and The Duchess Of Malfi.\n\nBeheading The Green Knight- Twice Daily\n\nThe tour carried on after the Sherman Panto Style production, through the spring.\n\nPANTO 1975-76\n\nSherman Theatre Cardiff\n\nTheatr Yr Ymylon\n\nMADAM WEN\n\nChristine Pritchard, John Prior, Shirley King, Sarah Reynolds, Frank Lincoln, Eilian Wyn, Stewart Jones, Robin Griffith, Christopher Davies, Nigel Ellacott.\n\nDirected by David Lyn, Set Design Ken Leech, Chris Brown. Lighting Howell Watkins, Wardrobe Anne Fowler & Felicity Shepherd, Music by Nick McGeegan & Nigel Ellacott,\n\nThis was a swashbuckling Pirate story in Panto style, based on Welsh legend and the novel by W.D. Owen about Einir Wyn who led a double life as the Lady Pirate Madam Wen (Wen is Welsh for White). She led a band of smugglers in North Wales, close to Puffin Island, Anglesey.\n\nThis is how I came to be dressed as a Puffin accompanying myself on my Ukelele- no mean feat in flippers.or wings.. The star of our show was Christine Pritchard, one of Waless busiest actresses, with countless appearances in Television soaps and plays and theatre. Christine is my oldest Panto friend- we are still in touch and met up recently forty five years after this show played The Sherman Theatre Cardiff, and toured around Wales!\n\nChristine Pritchard\n\nThe highlights were writing songs for the show, playing Puffins, Pirates and anything else required, and a set that had periactoids. Id never heard of the term- triangular Toblerone shaped pieces of scenery that spun around making three sets.\n\nA \"Periactoid\"\n\nWe had a locking Quay that joined them to make the Docks. Except for the Lyric Theatre Carmarthen when it didnt lock, and Christine, Christopher and myself started to move unaided towards the audience and our Periactoids went INTO the audience. All part of the atmosphere! I loved the show and the company!\n\nThe Sherman Theatre Cardiff\n\nPANTO 1976-77\n\nKenneth More Theatre Ilford\n\nDecember 23rd 1976- January 22nd 1977\n\nMOTHER GOOSE\n\nTerri Gardener, Michael Heath, Anna Lou & Maria, Jonathan Kiley, Eleanor Thomas, Gareth Armstrong, Robert Quarry, Gilly Daniels, Nigel Ellacott, Ludmila Nova.\n\nDirected by Vivyan Ellacott, Choreographed by Alma Rippon, and Tracey Hart. Musical Director Ted Heath, Percussion Terry Wyatt. Stage Manager Pat Nelder . (Costumes from Cyril Fletcher & Betty Astell).\n\nTerri Gardener and Barri Chat were drag performers who teamed up as Ugly Sisters in Pantomime. After Barrys death Terri continued as Dame- he first appeared in the revue Were In The Forces in 1944, and lived locally. He played Mother Goose and his transformation in the pool of beauty was very glamorous!\n\nAnna Lou and Maria presented a magic act with a finale of coloured doves flying from the back of the auditorium , following the path of the Follow Spot into their outstretched arms!\n\nMichael Heath went on to play The Phantom of The Opera at Her Majestys, as well as other West End musicals- his Brother, Ted was our MD. Eleanor Thomas and Gareth Armstrong I had known since Youth Theatre days, and this was a rare foray into panto- they appeared in rep and in the West End.\n\nTerri Gardener, Nigel Ellacott, Eleanor Thomas, Jonathan Kiley, Michael Heath\n\nJonathan Kiley played Colin- thats the traditional name of the Principal Boy in Mother Goose. Little did he or I know that forty three years later we would both still be working alongside each other- he is an executive Producer at Qdos Pantomimes, and has produced many of my Pantomime appearances in recent years.\n\nI played Priscilla The Goose and a couple of other characters- I'm a waiter in the picture above and a strolling Minstrel in the one below!\n\nNigel & Ukelele in the Village of Much Dawdling\n\nLudmila Nova played the Fairy. A very tall beautiful artist who had appeared frequently in Stars On Sunday alongside Jess Yates. Ludmilla was a dancer and had been at the Palladium. Our Fairy turned out to be a real life Baroness-The Baroness Ludmila Von Falz-Fein. She was the daughter of The Russian Baron Eduard Von Falz-fein, living in Liechtenstein, and Virginia (Gallico) Lady in waiting to the Monaco Royal Family. She worked in theatre and in film with appearances in The Slipper and The Rose and Black Joy until she retired to marry two years after this Panto in Ilford! A real fairy-tale ending!\n\nPriscilla, who had seen better days, and Fairy Ludmilla Nova, Once Upon A Time!\n\nPANTO 1977-78\n\nBelgrade Theatre Coventry\n\nDecember 15th 1977-January 28th 1978\n\nMOTHER GOOSE\n\nReg Dixon, Buster Skeggs, Ellis Jones, Carol Cleveland, Nigel Ellacott, Malcolm Reid, Colman O Doherty, Judy Riley, Robert Benfield, James Harvey, Pat Garrett, Shirley McGennity, Pauline Osborn, Lindsay Richards, The Belgrade Babes.\n\nDirected by Ed Thomason, Designed by Terry Parsons, Choreography Pauline Osborn, Musical Director Terry White, Lighting Paul Carter, Senior SM Ian Tunstall, Sound Peter Balint.\n\nNigel Ellacott as Priscilla and Reg Dixon as Mother Goose\n\nMy agent Keith Salberg told me that I was unlikely to play comic in Panto as I was a bit too young, and comics in commercial pantos were names- but he said if I Specialised (I think doing a role not many people wanted to do!) I would always get work. Having played Goose at Ilford the year before- This Panto saw me in the Rolls Royce of Geese- designed by Terry Parsons, and created by master craftsman of puppets- Peter Pullen! He also told me Rep pantos paid better- their contracts were for 8 shows, commercial pantos 12- so you got overtime on the extra four shows a week plus- at the Belgrade- In House accommodation! Flats for performers within the theatre, highly subsidised! A Golden Egg indeed!\n\nCarole Cleveland as Fairy, Malcolm Reid as Demon and a brand new Terry Parson set and costumes.\n\nThe Goose made by the very talented Peter Pullen\n\nReg ConfidentallyDixon was the star- His catchphrase was Ive been proper poorly from his Variety Bandbox years on Radio, and a very big star of Stage- he replaced George Formby at The Palace Theatre London in 1952 in Zip Goes A Million and played for 18 months. Star of recordings Confidentally  his Theme song is here on YouTube: Heres the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-ve_TgPx58\n\nThe pic accompanying the YouTube recording is from this panto. It was his fifth panto in his home town, and at that point his 30th. I was pretty much in awe, but not when he kept forgetting I was INSIDE the Goose, and kept hugging the gooses neck- underneath was me in a crash helmet affair strapped to my head. I had the wings attached to my elbows, the two cords working the eyes infront of my face, a duck call in my mouth, a vast feather and metal body  oh and tap shoes under the webbed feet! No wonder no-one else wanted the job!\n\nThe glamour of Theatre!\n\nEllis Jones was know to TV viewers from \"The Squirrels\", and played Hal in \"Pardon My Genie\" with Roy Barraclough and Hugh Paddick.\n\nBuster Skeggs as Colin\n\nBuster, Judy and me in the Belgrade Dressing Rooms\n\nMy first experience of a Terry Parsons designed panto- Costumes and scenery drowning in feathers and glitter! Remained friends over the years with Carol Cleveland- Carol was the only female member of Monty Pythons Flying Circus, and was a stunning Fairy, and Malcolm Reid a Glorious Demon King. I remained in touch with Malcolm until he passed away this December (2019). Im still in contact with Buster Skeggs. Our Jill Principal Girl Pat Garett became Choreographer in films such as Little Shop Of Horrors, The Muppet Movies for Henson and at The National Theatre, RSC and over fifty theatre credits.\n\nPANTO 1978-79\n\nHaymarket Theatre Leicester\n\nDecember 21st 1978\n\nMOTHER GOOSE\n\nRoy Macready, Stephen Price, Caro Gurney, Eddie Davies, David Oakley, Kalman Glass, Suzanne Kaye, Anita Pashley, Nigel Ellacott, Jean Morton, Russell Henderson, Robert Moore, Pauline Francis\n\nDirected by Alexander Dore, Music by Jo Stewart, Lyrics by Edna Dore, Choreographer Patrick McIntyre, Musical Director Ian Smith, Designer Terry Parsons, Lighting Chris Ellis, Sound Peter Balint, Company Stage Manager Soozie Copley, DSM Robert Lee-Corby, ASMs Judy Craymer & Dee Jones.

Roy Macready (a firm favourite at the Haymarket) played Dame in very traditional Dan Leno style. I recall at some point Edna Dore took over directing from her husband. She was later to appear as Mo Butcher (Pats Mother) Eastenders.\n\nI became great friends with Suzanne Kaye in that show, and she gave me my Honey Bear mascot. Its been on my wall in every pantomime since. Suzanne is possibly my longest Pantomime friend!\n\nThe panto was part of the Haymarket Rep season. The cast were also rehearsing and performing My Fair Lady that would play the season at the Haymarket,followed by a tour, before transferring to The Adelphi in London. It starred Tony Britton and Dame Anna Neagle along with Liz Robertson. It was Choreographed by Gillian Lynn.\n\nA favourite Green Room moment. The door opened. The Dame looked in. If anyone finds a gold parker pen with Dame Anna Neagle inscribed on it, its mine. \n\nA great happy jolly panto, but it was time to hang up my wings, and take my agents advice.

Growing up at The Swansea Grand Freddie was the Panto Dame many times, and guest artist in the rep seasons. This is the man who influenced me more than anything (apart from my Brother) to work in theatre and especially Pantomime. Freddie was all you could want from a Dame, traditional, funny and with perfect timing. I was so lucky to get to work with this amazing man who was also my friend.\n\nGilly Daniels and Peter Dayson played Good and bad fairy and witch. I am still in touch with both of them, and Peter directs and plays Dame in Panto each year. Stephen Fletcher became Stephen Fischer and along with Sally Ann Triplett appeared in West End Musicals and were our entry in the 1982 Eurovision Contest.\n\nI can remember one terrible Panto Joke that Freddie and I did onstage- He entered wearing a horse. Whats that I said A Paloyorno said Freddie. Dont you mean a Palomino? Freddie: Any Palayorno is a Palomino. Here's the scene photographed.\n\nPuss in Boots is a Panto that has now been neglected- the story-line is thin- The tale of A Millers Son who inherits an artful cat- the Cat passes him off as The Marquis Of Carabosse, and between them they defeat an Ogre. The next time the Kenneth More did this Panto Peter Thorne was Dame and David Ian (Now an International Producer) played The Miller's Son who is traditionally called Colin!\n\nHere's My Brother Vivyan with Freddie and me celebrating the opening night!\n\nPANTO 1980-81\n\nCity Hall, St.Albans\n\nDecember 22nd 1980- January 10th 1981\n\nPUSS IN BOOTS\n\nDavid Williams, Nigel Ellacott, Hilary ONeil, Gillian Hayes, Frank Seton, Beryl Vuolo, Michael Gordon, John Griffiths, Annette Farrant.\n\nProduced by David Capel-Jones, Directed by David Williams, Choreographed by Dallas North, Musical Director Ian Henry, Percussion Colin Badreck. Scenery, Costumes & properties Albermarle Of London. I provided my own Puss costumes- the crouching non verbal Tizer the cat ones, and the all talking singing Puss In Boots ones. With the magic of Margaret Bryce costuming me, I think Puss was pretty sparkly!\n\nThis pantomime followed the previous Puss In Boots at The Kenneth More. Hilary ONeil played the Marquis, and David Williams was comic. Oddly there was no Pantomime Dame.John Griffiths played a baddie, and I had known him since the days of the Swansea Youth Theatre. I still see John and Hilary to this day! They both pre-date me as an Ugly Sister!\n\nHilary O'Neil as Colin, and me as Puss.\n\nHilary and I can recall the moment when a pyro was set off as the double cat was transformed into me as Puss, and the grassy bank we were both on caught fire! A scary moment for us both! I have a memory of Hils stamping on the bits of me that had ignited!\n\nHilary had a couple of speciality song and dance numbers, and we both fought a lion at one point- when the Ogre transformed.\n\nThe part of King was played by Frank Seton. Frank was part of theatre history. He was the understudy who went on as Old Mother Riley when Arthur Lucan died in the wings before his entrance in Old Mother Riley In Paris at The Tivoli Theatre Hull in May 1952. Frank told me of his experiences in rep, as part of the top Shakespearean touring companies, and his times with Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane. A lovely man. He and Beryl Vuolo were a diminutive King & Queen in the panto! It was lovely to costume Frank a year later at Ilford where he played Alderman Fitzwarren.\n\nI stayed locally and can remember how beautiful St Albans looked at Christmas, all the shops and street decorations. I made some good friends that season.\n\nMy friend Tina Jones sent me this sketch she made of me as Puss. I love this illustration!\n\nPANTO 1981-82\n\nRedbridge Theatre Company\n\nKenneth More Theatre Ilford\n\nDecember 18th 1981-January 30th 1982\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nPeter Robbins & Nigel Ellacott, Chris Lloyd , Robert Quarry, John Griffiths, Gareth Snook, Shealagh Dennis, Michael Gordon, Maggie Carr, Patrick Wood, Aidan James, Nicholas Goldwyn, Traci, Lyssa & Danni Elster.\n\nDirected by Vivyan Ellacott, Choreographed by Dawn Wenn, Musical Director Laurence Payne, Designed by Amanda Fiske, Costumes by Margaret Brice, Lighting Andy Stone. Stage Manager Doug Wilson.ASM Elaine Kasner. Percussion Dave Hawthorn.\n\nThe Ugly Sisters are born!\n\nPeter Robbins and I were effectively put together by our mutual agent Barrie Stacey. I was writing Cinderella for The Kenneth More, and looking for a Sister. Barrie cast us both in a lager commercial which took all day and most of the night- by the end of it wed more or less sorted out our Sister routines! After that meeting we began to work together in tours of childrens plays and by the rehearsals were as one on stage!\n\nPeter brought along some costumes (Hed played Sister at Crewe the previous year), and I had some, and we made further costumes. Resident wardrobe Mistress Margaret Brice made some for us- Im delighted and proud that two of her later costumes for us are now on display at The Victoria & Albert Museum! Margaret created gorgeous costumes for Peter and me for the rest of our Sisters careers.\n\nMargaret Brice made all our costumes as Sisters and she made them so robustly and so perfectly that long after she retired her costumes are still worn to this day!\n\nAlso in the V&A are two Ballroom wigs- made by Kevin Powling & Gerry Westley, then called Modreno and later WigArt. They had made for Sisters John Inman & Barry Howard, and I think at that point Biggins- in those days Hard wigs were a rareity- now nearly every Dame wears them!\n\nIt was lovely to be on home ground, working alongside my Brother and enjoying the season. John Griffiths I'd worked with the year before, and a lot of the company I already knew. Peter commuted from South London- little did he know he'd be calling the Kenneth More his second home for the next nearly thirty years!\n\nHalf way through we decided to make a go of annual Sisters- little knowing it would continue for twenty-eight years! We decided to put money aside each week and use this to make new costumes and wigs for future years, to be Act as known- this means wed provide everything. Thanks to that KMT Debut, we were set to work together in plays, musicals and Pantomimes for nearly thirty years!\n\nHere's The Dressing room at The Kenneth More Theatre where Peter and I decided to team up as \"The Ugly Sisters\".

The Management was Charles Vance, a flamboyant Actor Manager of The Old School. The theatre is not large backstage. We asked if there was a quick change area and were presented with a packet of cup hooks!\n\nI recall the show being cancelled a couple of times because of High Tides, and the pony taking Cinders to the Ball being, shall we say.. not well at all. Neil West played Buttons, and was in the BBC Hospital drama \"Angels\", and Bryn Williams was our Baron Hardup.\n\nBryn was a lovely man and a joy to work with. I had done a few Television shows with Bryn who was known for being a part of the \"Ryan & Ronnie\" series, hugely popular Welsh comedians who had a series on National TV. Bryn appeared with them a lot.\n\nI appeared in a series called \"Hawksmoor\" with Bryn a few years before on BBC.He had recently appeared in the film of \"Under Milk Wood. He also had a great singing voice. Oliver Bradshaw was another lovely actor who played Major Domo, and worked a lot with Charles Vance's rep companies.\n\nCinderella was Ria Jones- possibly her first professional role-from Swansea, like me- Ria is now of course a leading lady in The West End, and star of many musicals in the UK and recently in Paris at the Comedy Francais- she took over from Glenn Close in Sunset Boulevard at The Coliseum theatre. Her Mum, Avril was at the Box Office at The Swansea Grand during the time my Brother Vivyan was House Manager. Its a great source of joy to have been there at the beginning of Ria's career and to watch her well deserved rise in our business. An amazing talent!\n\nSue Cheriton was Company Stage Manager. We were to meet up again six years later when we played Southampton Mayflower, and Sue was House Manager.\n\nPeter & I received these two notices in the two papers who were in on the same night.\n\nThe hilarious goings on of the Ugly Sisters, their outrageous costumes and expressions brought forth gales of laughter (Paper one)\n\n A hopeless loss in what were supposed to be the funniest roles in Panto (Paper Two)\n\nCant win em all!\n\nPANTO 1983-84\n\nPaul Elliott E&B Productions\n\nGORDON CRAIG STEVENAGE\n\n19th December 1983-14th January 1984\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nPeter Byrne, Spencer K.

This was the first day of E&B school!\n\nWind In The Willows- With Paul Laidlaw- Paul would later be Stevenage's long standing Pantomime Dame. Here we are with Peter Robbins, Peter Thorne, Peter Wiggins, Larry Drew and Jennifer Haley\n\nFor Peter and I, this was our first pantomime for Paul Elliott- King Of Pantomime, and our third season together as The Ugly Sisters. I dont recall auditioning- The agent Ann Zahl rang us up and asked if we would go in to see Paul Elliott in his office in Aldwych. Ann had not seen us, but told us she owed Paul a favour and that he was looking for Sisters. When we got the job we immediately offered Ann commission, which she refused. It was a favour she said. At this point she would have had 37 years commission, which I mentioned to her a few years back. She laughed! Ann was producer on the \"Red Dwarf\" series among other major projects.\n\nWe saw Paul and his Producer Brian Hewitt-Jones. Paul looked at our photos of costumes, seemed impressed and said Are you camp?. Peter said Pardon?. Paul repeated the question.. On stage or Off? said Peter . And the deal was done!\n\nOur wonderful Director was Peter Byrne. The B in E&B Productions when it was created. Peter and I were worried our double act Business would not be known to him, so we craftily invited Peter B to tea. At The Ritz. Over tea we sorted it all out, and many years later (Peter Byrne, and indeed Peter Robbins sadly no longer with us) Peter B declared it was the best bribe hed ever received, and wed have had all out business inserted into the show anyway! A lovely gorgeous man who is sadly missed.\n\nThis season we made friends we still have to this day- Spencer I see from time to time, and Linda Hayden (who became Mrs Paul Elliott)and Paul I still talk to and see all those years later. I've had communications from Betty's daughter in Australia, and very sadly attended Peter Byrne's funeral after he passed away at Denville Hall.\n\nPeter and I had no idea that we were to join a family that grew, carried on for twenty-eight years, as an extended family, with Paul Elliott, with Jonathan Kiley and Nick Thomas and Michael Harrison- a family that I am still a part of almost forty years later!\n\nBetty Benfield and Cheryl Taylor we were fortunate to work with many more times in Pauls Cinderella, and it was the loveliest Pantomime to start our twenty eight years as Sisters for Paul Elliott ,(E&B) and then for Nick Thomas and Michael Harrison (QDOS).\n\nThat was 1983- I would not have imagined that last year in 2019,, thirty-seven years later I would be filmed by Stevenage Museum to \"meet and Greet\" young visitors to an exhibition of pantomime, and be involved in a celebration of my favourite occupation!\n\nPaul Elliott with Nigel at the launch of his book \"Keeping My Balls In The Air!\" 2018\n\nPANTO 1984-85\n\nBECK THEATRE HAYES\n\n13th December 1984-January 12th 1985\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nDennis Waterman, Rula Lenska, Annabel Etkind, Ken Wood, Peter Purves, Jane Danielle, Peter Robbins & Nigel Ellacott, Betty Benfield, Ifor Gwynne Davies, Susie Laughton, Mandy Fryer, Shelley Laurenti, Rosemary Sandifer, Karen Hesmondhalgh, Jocelyn Bowlan.\n\nDirected by Peter Purves, Choreographed by Mike Fields, Musical Director Paul Jury, CSM: Ifor Gwynne Davies, DSM: Tracey Lane, ASM: Ray Daniels, Wardrobe Enza Dormizzi.

She also got an MBE.\n\nDennis with Peter Purves and Jane Danielle as Dandini.\n\nRula Lenska and Dennis Waterman were husband and wife, having met on the set of Minder and lived locally. Rula I have to credit for my make-up! Previously Peter and I had drawn age lines, blacked out teeth, in an attempt not to look young! Rula asked us why we put all that mess over our faces, and took us in hand. The result was a cleaner, fresher and prettier look for the not so Ugly Sisters! Rula was now the second titled Aristocrat we had worked with in the space of three years! First Countess Ludmilla Nova and now Baroness Lubienska, or Rula Lenska , star of \"Rock Follies\". Bearing in mind we were the Step-Daughters of Baron Hardup, played by Blue Peter's Peter Purves, and chasing a Prince Charming-we were all Panto Nobility!\n\nMy Gerald Scarfe cartoon from \"The Sunday Times\" and a very nice revue!\n\nPeter, Dennis & Nigel The Finale\n\nPANTO 1985-86\n\nPaul Elliott E&B Productions\n\nPAVILION BOURNEMOUTH\n\n20th December 1985-26th January 1986\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nRolf Harris, Bill Owen, Kathy Staff, Ward Allen, Caroline Dennis, Maureen Scott, Jane Danielle, Peter Robbins & Nigel Ellacott, Betty Benfield, Doug Ridley, Jayne Longfield, Trudy Raynor, Sharon Wilden, Alison Deegan, Suzi Mollett, Tallulah Beckett, Philip Edwards, Carl Newman.

Princess Alexandra and husband, Angus Ogilvy, and a reception on Richmond Green for The Royal Star & Garter charity. The Princess asked Peter & I about our walkdown hats, which were made by Gerald Cheshire- he was milliner for the original My Fair Lady stage production. She had a good eye for hats did Her Royal Highness!\n\nAnneka Rice was at the height of Treasure Hunt fame. She was the first person I saw with a phone you could walk around with! (the size of a house brick, but a marvel!).The scene opened with whirring helicopter sounds, and Anneka lowered from the flies arriving onstage . Caroline Dennis was Cinderella and Jayne Danielle Prince Charming.\n\nThe Ensemble and Ward Allan & Roger The Dog\n\nThis was a terrible winter, and on one frightening occasion I finally made it through thick snow and ice as the curtain had risen. That is one of the quickest transformations from Bedraggled person into Ugly Sister carried out in the wings with minimalist make-up!\n\nThis pantomime saw me in casualty- not the TV series, but the A&E , as I fell off the throne! During the slipper fitting I got dragged off the chair as usual, but fell and gashed my chin, ending up with stitches. I carried on until Peter shoved me offstage as I was spurting blood and talking gibberish apparently! I returned the next day stitched and plastered- a VERY Ugly Sister and had to shave around it until I had a goatee by the end of run!\n\nVivienne Ross\n\nBetty Benfield was billed as Fairy Godmother on the poster, but I believe was touring for Paul Elliott in Big Bad Mouse and he replaced her with Vivienne Ross. No credits for Stage Management in the programme. The picture of me under the dryer was from our Boudoir scene.

Another major change was the inclusion of Patrick Fyffe- Dame Hilda Bracket as Fairy Godmother.\n\nThe posters had Carmen Silvera (Edith from Allo Allo) as Fairy. She was released to appear in the Stage Show at The London Palladium, and Patrick was asked late on to play Fairy Godmother.Here's Patrick's head that was affixed on top of Carmen's head, and a sticker covered her name up with Patricks! Patrick agreed to play Fairy Godmother, and wrote his own material- this was pure panto magic.\n\nAdam & Patrick in the Sisters top floor Boudoir\n\nHe WAS Dame Hilda, and his comedy business was a masterclass I will never forget. Added to this Fiona Kennedy went along with whatever Patrick would create (daily) for the Kitchen scene- just the two of them- and the result was the cast in the wings watching each show for his sheer brilliance! In Act Two he sang The Night Is Young by Sigmund Romberg (1935 Evelyn Laye) to Cinderella. You might have thought this not suitable for the audience- you could hear a pin drop! Pure unadulterated magic!\n\nFiona with Fern and David Stenning\n\n70 performances all a sell-out! Sue Cheridan was House Manager. She had been CSM when Peter & I did our second panto together at Porthcawl six years previously.\n\nThis was Fern Brittons first Pantomime.

A hugely popular singer and chart topper from the 50s was Pauls lucky mascot. He was in his first Pantomime, and continued to star in Goldilocks and Goody Two Shoes for Paul long after. He had married his lovely wife Christine earlier that year, and she dressed Peter & I for the run. This year was Ronnies 27th Year in Panto, in his home town.\n\nA favourite picture of mine- Ward Allan in a technical rehearsal. We worked with Ward Allan so many times, and later Dawson Chanceand Bob Carolgees. All masters of their craft.\n\nWard Allan & Roger The Dog. \"What has he got? He's got a balloon! Superdog....

We took a bungalow by the seafront, and a regular feature was Peter cooking a meal, and June and Windsor joining us- those chats late into the night about Junes career  at The National Theatre, Windsor joining Margaret Rutherford and her husband Stringer Davies in her films- magical theatrical memories! I think Windsor has to be one of the nicest and most delightful gents I've had the privilege of working with. A true gent. Sadly missed in Pantoland. He enjoyed a good retirement, and was able to spend all the time he wanted with his family.\n\nJune, Peter and I discovered a shop- it was the forerunner of what was to become Lush- Called Cosmetics To Go in those days. A beautiful shop with a fire in the fireplace. We all did our Christmas Shopping there!\n\nThe Ensemble. Stefan & Dave Bradford.\n\nOur Prince was Caroline Dennis (previously our Cinderella) and Susie McKenna was Dandini. Susie had been Principal Boy at Nottingham Playhouse. In recent years she has appeared in several West End shows- Cats, Chicago and went on the run Hackney Empire. She wrote and produced The amazing Pantomimes there, many of them starring Sharon D Clark, Clive Rowe and herself.Caroline is the daughter of the quick fire comedian Bobby Dennis, and an accomplished pianist. She's worked all over the globe.\n\nCaroline & Susie\n\nJune Brown, David Bradford and Cheryl Taylor.\n\nStefan was a great Buttons, and we had a very social time that season. Carole Todd directed a fast moving show- I seem to remember Cadbury Branding, with a large prop Finger of fudge causing much merriment! This show was a very special time. Fond memories.\n\nTHE PANTOMIME ROADSHOW\n\nPaul Elliott asked us if we would do some promotions, possibly in Theatre foyers that might tie in with Cadbury Sponsorship. We had a think, and came up with an idea that could take The Magic Of Pantomime to schools- it could be the first introduction to Pantomime in many cases, but we were adamant we would not perform a pantomime!\n\nThe Sisters Roadshow\n\nCadbury Colours!\n\nWe toured The Sisters Roadshow every Autumn with assistance from the Theatres. Our organisers were Lara O'Connor and Laura Taylor from E&B.\n\nWe would take the panto style to schools, promote going to see a panto, and tell them a little about the traditions. There were three Roadshows in fact. One involved \"The Ugly Sisters\" visiting with their friend Buttons (three in a van from Wimbledon to Aberdeen!) another commissioned by Peter Tod to keep the Hippodrome Alive in performance during its refurbishment- That was about \"Tower The Hippodrome Cat\".\n\nThe Hippodrome show with Andrew Ryan, Lorna Laidlaw, Peter, Nigel & Ian Sandy\n\nThe final incarnation where Billy, Mr Pike and The Theatre Manager visit a school and bring the magic of Panto.

Jennifer Saunders came to see the panto and a little while later we got asked to do an episode! As it turned out that didnt happen, but it led to Peter & I doing the Mirrorball Pilot for Jennifer, and filming it with Joanna Lumley and all the Ab Fab cast, including June!

It was a very special pantomime. All the elements, all the magic was there. It was West End quality, presented by Paul Elliott and Carole Todd in my favourite Pantomime Venue.\n\nWith Paul Elliott Press Launch\n\nGary Wilmot as Buttons\n\nPaul and Carole Directed the panto superbly. The lighting by Jenny Cane was at its most spectacular when Olympian Robin Cousins took to the ice rink on stage, surrounded by Beatrix Potter style animals in a scene Peter and I watched almost every show from the wings. Judy Cornwall and Gary became mates to this day, and it is the pantomime I cherish the most- Peter Tod the manager co produced and also remains a long time friend . We did lengthy Pantomime Roadshows for Peter Tod in Birmingham, and appeared regularly in Arts Fest in the square where the new library now stands in Birmingham.\n\nArts Fest Birmingham\n\nThe pantomime was chosen by The Victoria & Albert Museum as one they would like to film for posterity. It was a three camera shoot over two days. During the interval Catherine Haille of the V&A said how much the Museum would love to exhibit our ballgowns- I remember saying to Cathy that we were still very much in need of them, but in the future.... Wind on twenty odd years, and these ballgowns are now preserved, also for posterity, and on display at the Theatre section of the V&A.

As with all Commuter pantomimes, the social part of the day doesnt exist, and mostly everyone headed for train or car as soon as the curtain falls. Jonathan Kiley made one of his last appearance on stage as Prince and was our Company Manager, and Jodie Jackson (now the top MadonnaTribute act in the country) was our lovely Cinderella.\n\nPeter & Nigel with Jodie Jackson\n\nGary Wilmot commuted, Peter and I travelled in each day, with the rare overnight stay. Bob Carolgees and Judy Cornwell stayed for the run. The theatre was run by Rosemary Squire who, along with her husband Howard Panter went on to found ATG.This was the final Pantomime/Theatre show for Rolf Harris. He retired from liveshows at the end of the season.\n\nWith Donna, Gary & Robin\n\nThis was the year that Peter and I made the documentary \"Pantoland\" and filmed during the Summer, into the Autumn, and completed the last shots of the Channel 4 show on the Opening night of Woking Panto.

Peter had just left Coronation Street, having played Derek Wilton for a very long time. Peter was a Panto expert, and co-owner of Pollocks Toy Shop with its museum of antique toy theatres in Covent Garden. Jamie Benson was our Cinderella, and Daniel Whiston (later to star in Dancing On Ice) replaced Robin Cousins as our skating Dandini. Bob Carolgees played Brokers Man with Spit The Dog. His routine Old Shep is a masterpiece of variety Theatre!\n\nWe had a lovely season- and the Theatre Royal is one of my favourite Panto Palaces to play.\n\nJudy Graham, a hugely talented artist and actor arrived at the Theatre Royal to do a photographic sitting. She was to create a series of portraits that year of Pantomime Dames and Ugly Sisters. They were impressive, large and, I think, captured the essence of Pantomime. Judy and Caithy Haile at the V&A museum arranged for them to go on display at their Covent Garden Museum- we were very proud to be on the wall beside Les Dawson, Terry Scott, Brian Godfrey and David Moreton, John Inman and others in Judys collection. The portraits are in our Gallery Section.\n\nThe above from Homes & Antiques magazine- and below with a few Chippendales!\n\nWe had a great season, and lived very close to The Playhouse Theatre, where Kenneth Alan Taylor was doing his panto.

The building wasnt ready on time, and so we delayed the Pantomime for a week before opening. When we arrived with the costumes the glass wasnt in the dressing room windows, and we shared the corridor with a cement mixer for the tech rehearsals! We had electricity supply problems, and even the sewer decided to create problems, but- the show DID go on!\n\nBradley Walsh was Buttons- at this point he was known for Wheel Of Fortune, and Our Fairy Godmother was the Gorgeous Britt Ekland- making a Movie Star entrance through the auditorium.

He moved into a vast apartment in Aberdeen with one small case that he lived out of, and was a really nice lad. His Brother had been in the Soap as well, and he did a couple of pantos in the UK.

The Campaign was Panto themed, and we did two full days photo shoot at The Royal Academy Of Dramatic Art (RADA) for the Brochure, and another shoot for the Cardboard Cut-Outs of the two of us that were installed in every Post Office in the UK- Thats a LOT of Ugly Sisters!\n\nThe shoot was pretty frantic, with a lot of costume and wig changes involved. The main hall at RADA was set up as studio, and we got changed below in the basement. The height below stairs was very low. You ducked to go into the dressing room, got made up, ducked to exit and then got changed. We did this about a dozen times. I did 11.. I forgot to duck, and knocked myself out! A cup of tea later we were back in the studio!\n\nDaisy The Cow and all the props we brought with us- RADA looked like Aladdins Cave!.\n\nHere are the Cardboard Cut-outs, now installed safely in The Postal Museum, London.\n\nIt was very strange queuing up at the Post Office that Christmas next to yourself. We were on Smiley stamps (not real stamps) and banners, bunting and flags- and in addition we accompanied Adam Crosier, The Chief Exec of The Royal Mail to launch this Panto campaign on all the radio stations- we sat in the BBC studios over two days and talked all things Panto and all things post office!

When we arrived at Stage Door we discovered several crates of champagne awaiting us from the Royal Mail. It was champagne for the cast every night in Number Two dressing room!\n\nOur digs were the nearest weve ever been to the Theatre, and were on the perimeter wall of The Coronation Street Set, our windows looking towards Ritas Cabin! Below us were flats where several of the Corrie Actors lived, in close proximity to the set. At the corner of the main road was The Old Grapes, a pub run by Liz Dawn, the Streets Vera Duckworth.\n\nWe could walk to the Opera House in less than four minutes. It was a lovely treat to be in a direct transfer, and to meet up with everyone. It was a very jolly season. The Ponies used to pass our dressing room twice a day- we had carrots or polo mints at the ready. We were given two small rooms, so we opened the second room up as a Green Room. It became the nightly Champagne Bar! It was a decent length of run, too. The Press Club was almost next door, and between The Grapes and The Press Club we ran into lots of mates playing various theatres in the City.\n\nPANTOMIME DIARY 2003/04\n\nWEAKEST LINK 2004 & COVER GIRLS\n\n2004\n\nTwo Panto Events in 2004 were The Publication of the bookIts Behind You, and The Weakest Link Panto Special\n\nPeter Latham wrote this highly illustrated book on Pantomime, and its-behind-you.com supplied some archive material and photographs.

A few days before taping I became ill with flu , and by the time a car arrived to take me to Pinewood I was dosed up with everything I could find to get me through the day. Id picked the heaviest costume and wig, not knowing wed be on show (there was an audience) in the studio for about five hours, maybe six. At one point I must have looked ghastly, and Ruth Madoc dressed as a Wicked Queen took me outside dressed in a huge ballgown and purple wig. That was the moment we came face to face with Johnny Depp dressed as Willy Wonka! Its a funny old world!\n\nHere was our line up:(l to r) Joe Pasquale, Peter Duncan, Ruth Madoc, Lucy Benjamin (She won!) Shane Lynch, Anne Robinson, Britt Ekland, Nigel Ellacott,, Alvin Stardust and Helen Noble.\n\nBackstage at Pinewood\n\nAlvin in make-up-and on set.\n\nBritt & Helen\n\nIt felt like the longest day, The flu had to be banished by Doctor Stage and held at bay until I staggered out of the studio around 7pm. I came a close second- lost out to Joe Pasquale, so I was there almost to the end. Curiously I got to play The Queen Of Mean, Ann Robinson, a few times in Panto since then! We could be sisters!\n\nPanto 2004-05\n\nQDOS\n\nTHEATRE ROYAL PLYMOUTH\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nBrian Conley, Nigel Ellacott & Peter Robbins, Dawson Chance, Lynsey Britten, Sean Needham, Lynsey Britton, Rachel Spry, Jody Crosier,\n\nEmma Katie Adcock, Tanya Stricker, Rosanna Stocchino, Alice Chilver, Michael Laidler, David Austen, Edwin Ray, Philip Dzwonkiewicz\n\nExecutive Producer Paul Elliott, Directed & Choreographed by Paul Robinson, Musical Director Mark Crossland, Lighting Designer David Howe, Sound Design Richard Price, CSM Antony Bishop, DSM Susan James, ASMs Linda Louise Derby, Darren McKeown.\n\nSadly Anthony Bishop passed in the spring of 2020.\n\nAgain, this was almost a complete transfer of the same show to Plymouth. Brian Conley had his flat a few doors from us, and we had a screening of a video of the show with everyone in our flat. It was the sunniest Christmas Day I can remember, a group of us walking around The Hoe.\n\nDawson & Peter\n\nThe Theatre is a fabulous venue with a backstage canteen, and a boasted amazing rehearsal facilities at TR2, along with a large resident wardrobe that refurbished the show. Here are the Panto wardrobe crew with Sylvia Blackler who dressed me during the run, and some of the Plymouth Crew.\n\nBoxing Day saw the most terrible news breaking of the Tsunami that hit the Indian Ocean off Sumatra. A huge loss of life and property. A staggering event. Everyone in the world rushed to help and raise funds. Theatres around the UK supported, and we, along with a few other theatres put on a fund raising Variety show- all proceeds going to the fund.\n\nThe Cast did Act one- musical numbers from Abba and Dance routines. Solo numbers from shows and ensemble numbers.Dawson did a spot with audience members- I did my Piano act, with assistance from Rosanna and Michael dancing to my Paderewskis Minuet. Brian Conley did Act Two with his own Musicians. We raised a lot of money, as did Bournemouth Pavilion panto on the same night.\n\nPANTOMIME DIARY 2004/05\n\nPanto 2005-06\n\nQDOS\n\nTHEATRE ROYAL NEWCASTLE\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nJill Halfpenny, Clive Webb, Danny Adams ,Nigel Ellacott & Peter Robbins, Sean Needham, Jody Crosier, Lauren Hill, Emma Katy Adcock, Amy Burns, Amy Bruce, Jenny Dougan, Innis Robertson, Sean Hackett, Karl Williams, Ricardo Canadinhas, The Marron Stage School\n\nExecutive Producer & Director Michael Harrison, Choreographer Jon Bowles, Musical Director Irvin Duguid, Lighting Designer Ben Cracknell, CSM Ray Tizzard, DSM Shane Thom, ASMs Michelle Dixon, Nicholas Potts.

It was to see the start of fifteen years of Clive and Danny appearing in Panto here, and still counting! After Peter and I came Brian Godfrey and then Chris Hayward who has been Dame at Newcastle since then, each year with more lavish costumes!The Glamorous Dame Rita!\n\nI have fuzzy memories of rehearsals and Tech/Dress rehearsals. A few days into the rehearsals in London I came down with full on proper flu. I was in bed for around six days in London, and arrived in Newcastle just to sleep in the dressing room through tech rehearsals, until the last Dress Rehearsal. Peter gave me all the moves, the changes and the notes on arrival, and somehow it all went well!\n\nJill Halfpenny was the star, a local lady she had just won BBCs Strictly and performed her jive from the show to Im Still Standing sung by Jody and partnered by Innis Robertson. We had a flat right by the iconic bridge, and enjoyed watching the nightlife kicking off as we headed home after the shows!\n\nClive Webb & Danny Adams- Father and Son tour in Circus Hilarious. They brought an amazing full on slosh act to this panto. It ends with Clive falling into a wheelbarrow of slosh. Until the matinee when I came out of the Quick change, knocked the barrow and flooded the wings (and the babes one flight below) with slosh! Not a good day for me!\n\nThe Wheel Barrow of slosh!\n\nPANTOMIME DIARY 2005/06\n\nPanto 2006-07\n\nQDOS\n\nBIRMINGHAM HIPPODROME\n\nCINDERELLA\n\nBrian Conley, Shobna Gulati, Nigel Ellacott, Peter Robbins, Dawson Chance, Sean Needham, Jody Crosier, Michelle Potter, Sinead Blairs, Louise Corbett, Nathan Daniel, Sean Hackett, Lucy James, Bethany King, Desi Valentine, Wesley Wareham, Kitty Whitelaw, Andy Young.\n\nProduced & Directed by Paul Elliott, Choreographer Heather Douglas, Musical Director Robert Willis, Lighting Designer David W Kidd, Company Manager Ian Sandy, Production Manager Mark Sherwood, DSM Martin Hinkins, ASMs Linda Derby, Darren McKeown, Helen Reeve.

I had no idea that it would be my last Pantomime with Peter, and our last Hoorah with our Cinderella Family. The next time we were to meet was at Peters funeral in the April of 2009. In fact the last time I saw Peter was when we arrived at St Pancras the day after this panto finished. Paul Elliott gave a very moving speech at his funeral, and so very many of our Qdos Panto family, and show business mates attended the service.\n\nWhen Peter died on April 15th (aged 56) we both had signed for the long run of Cinderella at Wolverhampton Grand. Michael Harrison took me for lunch and asked me what I wanted to do now. I had already decided I wouldnt want to play Ugly Sister with anyone else, and that playing Dame would be the way forward. Michael offered me a Dame part for Qdos, and I thanked him and made a request.\n\nI asked Nick Thomas and Michael if I might Get my act togetherand create my Dame at my home theatre, Directed by my Brother Vivyan, and in a Panto written and costumed by myself, That way I could prepare the way forward, and indeed ask them to come along and see for themselves. That is exactly what happened.\n\nPANTOMIME DIARY 2008/09\n\nPETER ROBBINS 1953-2009\n\nPanto 2009-10\n\nKENNETH MORE THEATRE\n\n17th December 2009- 23rd January 2010\n\nSNOW WHITE\n\nNigel Ellacott, Isobel Hurll, Loraine Porter, Robert Quarry, Michael Conway, Ellie Robertson, Rikki Stone, Nathan Daniel, Jocelyn Prah, , Owen Smith, Tami Stone, William Dignon.

Here I was Twenty-eight years later starting another new venture- Dame.\n\nFor nearly thirty years Peter and I got in early, made tea, chatted, put make-up on without really thinking about it, stopping to chat to people and then suddenly discovering it was beginners and we werent ready! Now, it was just me and a lot of silence.\n\nBecause I was able to costume and write the panto I was able to set up a template for my future Dame. I had huge help from everyone at the Kenneth More Theatre, and I was able to incorporate some Sister business into the part, and I added a Football themed costume, Picking my Man with a camera pointed at the audience, and to change the double act into a solo act- as well as adding Worker costumes a Dame needs that a Sister doesnt have. The hardest part was toning down the sharpness and bringing up the warmth.\n\nThe most heart-warming thing was the huge support I got from friends in The Business- coming to support this debut. From Barbara Windsor and Scott Mitchell, Vicki Michelle, Dr Jack Watters and Ian from New York, The Qdos Management, Michael Harrison and Kathryn Rooney to my neighbour Anna Karen and Britt Ekland, amongst so many others- I was so uplifted by these visitors and their support.\n\nBy the end of the run I was ready and I hoped able to accept the next Qdos contract- just down the road!\n\nDAMES DIARY 2009/10\n\nPanto 2010-11\n\nQDOS\n\nORCHARD THEATRE DARTFORD\n\n4thDecember 2010- 9th January 2011\n\nJACK & THE BEANSTALK\n\nBobby Davro, Nigel Ellacott, Wayne Perrey, Katy Osborne, Lisa Andrews, Jay Worthy, Jan Eric Brenner, TJ Roberts, Katie Osbourne , Kelly Titheridge, Kate-Emma Portlock, Natasha Thompson-Wilde, Lyndsey Forfar, Kevin Reddington and John Ward-Wilkinson.\n\nExecutive Producer Jon Conway, Directed by Alan Cohen, Choreographer Sarah St.George, Musical Director Dave Pinkney, Lighting Graham McLusky.

Wayne now has a succesful career as master carpenter and designer both on and off Television.\n\nOur Baddie was Jay Worthy, who also specialised in Sister when not being A Demon King or Evil Henchman.\n\nThe Orchard Theatre is about thirty minutes by car from my home.. Sarah Ford came along to dress me for the second time, and we drove to work each day- until the snows came down. Heavy snow for several days, to the point where they had to shovel the stage door open, and the cast limped in convoy to the nearest hotel on two occasions. Some people commuting to London spent six hours stranded on a journey of thirty minutes!\n\nOddly we featured a Snow scene in Act Two and for some reason large snowballs were thrown out at the audience who threw the back. Its a knockout resulted in me dodging wig toppling giant snowballs for the season.\n\nIt was a Circus themed Jack and The Beanstalk. It was unusual in many aspects.\n\nDAMES DIARY 2010-11\n\nPanto 2011-12\n\nVENUE CYMRU LLANDUDNO\n\nQDOS\n\n10th December 2011-31st December 2011\n\nALADDIN\n\nJason Gardiner , John Evans, Nigel Ellacott, Marc Mulcahey, Tim Morgan, Lucy May Barker, Michael Anderson, Aaron Sweeney Harris, Stephen Johnson Kerry Crozier, Emma Cooper, Hannah Varnham and Rosy Thompson.\n\nExecutive producer  Jonathan Kiley, Director Simon Delaney, Musical Director Matt Smith, Choreographer Matt Cole.

Wolverhampton and Birmingham along with Bradford were the longest runs. Sherrie Hewson I had met before, and we have been mates since this run- we had a fun time in a hotel around the corner, only a few minutes walk away, and settled in to enjoy the season. Keith and Orville played the Dairyman, and he did two spots with Orville and with cuddles. I had no idea this would be his last panto. Sadly Keith became very ill and later passed away. A big gap was left in the world of Variety and Panto- his Humpty Dumpty Pantos that he produced were spectacular.\n\nDuring this run we were sponsored by Dudley Zoo, and I adopted Tallulah The Tapir- I had several visits in the years afterwards until she packed her trunk and hoofed off to Whipsnade. Here we are bonding over a branch.\n\nOur Hotel family included Ken Morley, Sherries Coronation Street Co-Star, and Ben James Ellis who played Jack.We enjoyed many nights of wine and chat at the Novotel!\n\nNiki Evans was our Fairy, and brought her incredible voice to fill the Theatre twice Daily. The season was memorable for rogue Fire Alarms that went off a good few times. The Entire cast, crew and audience assembling in the rain outside the building. A great crew at Wolverhampton too!\n\nOne memorable time Sherrie was about to announce- Behold, The Giant Blunderbore! when out we went. For a long time. Soaking wet we returned. The wings were mopped where wed dripped, the Giant was positioned to enter. Up went the curtain.. Behold The Giant Oh! Theres nobody here! The house full of schoolchildren and pensioners had departed in their pre-booked coaches!

So lovely to have this sort of continuity in a Theatre. Rare and lovely.

It was a fun show, and once again a delight to have Simon and Ashleigh in the Panto- a transfer of last years show more or less. The comedy routines were adapted by Chris.\n\nSadly Pudsey had passed away that year, and Ashleigh brought Sully along with her, and Pennys dog Eliza to do their routines. I watched them from the wings most shows, unless I was in mid quick change! A wonderful set of routines- and then each March Id catch up with them in Crufts at the Agility Championships, which Sully continues to win.\n\nI Shared a hotel with Chris and never ran out of panto anacdotes in the entire run! We did a pretty impressive If I were not in Pantomime all of us! The Theatre very kindly gave Simon, Ashleigh, Penny, Chris and myself a Christmas Dinner between shows in a spare dressing room.
