I don't reckon many blokes could pull that off and be even remotely sexy,\" she grins.\n\nBut drop dead gorgeous leading men aside, glamorous Jill, who's just as happy treading the boards as playing characters on the small screen, says the real reason she loves acting is that no two jobs are ever the same.\n\n\"I love the variety. That's one of the reasons that I'm in this business - you can be doing Chekhov one minute and pantomime the next. It keeps me on my toes as I do get bored pretty easily,\" admits the former Byker Grove actress.\n\nIn fact, the only thing the 31-year-old doesn't feel comfortable with is being recognised in public.\n\n\"I still find that a bit strange and I've never really got used to it. I just find it really uncomfortable and bizarre. I mean, everybody is always really nice, but it's the expectation factor of it all. I always think, 'Oh, God, what do they expect me to be like, do they want me to dance'?\"\n\n\"The worst thing is that I get stopped all over - on the Tube, on holiday or in the lift - which is the very worst situation as you have nowhere to go!\" But Jill is still happy to see her fans. \"Obviously I don't mind. I've never, ever refused anyone an autograph or a photo or anything, but sometimes you just don't feel your best.\n\n\"You know what it's like, you dress up when you feel nice and not one single person sees you, and then the one day that you have coldsores, you're in your tracky bottoms and you feel crap, someone runs up to you and wants a picture.\n\n\"Still, it's not exactly the biggest brunt to bear is it? I can think of worse things,\" Jill smiles.\n\nReturning to BBC One for a second series of classroom drama Waterloo Road, Jill stars as Izzie Redpath, the charismatic drama teacher and mother of two teenage girls, who has just moved in with fellow teacher and former best friend Tom.\n\n\"After all the turmoil in the first series between Izzie, Tom and his ex-girlfriend Lorna, Tom and Izzie finally decide to make a go of it,\" Jill says.\n\n\"They're thrilled to be expecting a baby together as well, but unfortunately they never really get the chance to settle down and enjoy their happiness because Lorna turns up out of the blue.\n\n\"She's meant to be away in Australia, but she rocks up at Waterloo Road on the first day of term, all cheery and happy, which immediately makes both Izzie and Tom feel massively paranoid.\" Jill says the new couple start to row about how to handle the situation, since Izzie still feels guilty about stealing Lorna's man, but Tom smells a rat.\n\n\"It puts a wedge between them from the moment they see her, and it all really comes to a head when she ends up moving in with them for about a week, causing nothing but trouble for everyone.\n\n\"She pretends that there's been a flood at the bed and breakfast she's staying in and it all gets very weird.\"\n\nDespite her character's ups and downs, Jill says she was immediately drawn to playing Izzie because she gets the most emotional storylines.\n\n\"It's mainly about her personal life and I think that's the appeal of Izzie's character -she's very spontaneous and lets her heart rule her head, which I really admire.\n\n\"It's great to be back for a second series because none of us had a clue how it was going to be received last year, but the response we've had has been great.\"\n\nOf course, Jill isn't just a great actress. Two years ago, she and her professional dance partner Darren Bennett were crowned Champion of Champions in BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing show, although the Chicago star confesses that she hasn't danced much since.\n\n\"Imagine going from having one-on-one lessons from some of the best dancers in the world to suddenly going to a class with 20 people and you just don't want to do it. I admit that I've been a bit spoilt,\" she laughs.\n\nAlthough Jill's success on Strictly Come Dancing was a highlight of her career, it was her role as ex-cop Kate Mitchell in EastEnders that made her a household name.\n\n\"I loved being in EastEnders and I'd never say never about doing another soap, but at the moment I'm happiest doing my own thing,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm really pleased about the way that things have gone after EastEnders. Strictly Come Dancing opened a lot of doors for me and I've had an amazing run since then, so fingers crossed that it continues, as I've had loads of opportunities and I'm loving every minute.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jill says she likes nothing more than flopping in front of the TV whenever she's got a spare minute between filming.\n\n\"I loved watching America's Next Top Model - I'd rearrange my social life to watch that. Modelling is quite a bizarre profession when you really think about it, but there must be more to it than their looks.\n\n\"I suppose it's a bit like my job really. People always think that they could easily be actors, but I'd like to see them try!\" Happily, despite her image as a Geordie glamour puss, Jill remains refreshingly down to earth and admits that she often indulges in eating TV dinners in front of her favourite programme.\n\n\"I definitely don't mind eating while watching TV It's a bad habit, I know, but I really don't mind it,\" she says.\n\n\"My Mam really likes to eat around the table, but it's a bit weird if you're in the house on your own. I always just end up eating really fast so I can watch telly anyway!\"\n\nWaterloo Road begins on BBC One on Thursday, January 18.\n\nPROFILE\n\nReal name: Jill Halfpenny\n\nBirthdate: July 15,1975\n\nSignificant other: Engaged to actor Craig Conway\n\nCareer high: Playing Phil Mitchell's wife Kate in EastEnders between 2002 and 2004\n\nCareer low: Her first acting role was playing an urchin in a Newcastle production of Sweeney Todd\n\nFamous for: Her role in EastEnders\n\nWords of wisdom: \"I bite my nails terribly.
