        "text": "Sandy Cowell said on 23/May/23\n\nIt turned out that Jill was playing an undercover cop, but the couple fall in love anyway. Philâs pride is so badly hurt that he tells Jillâs Kate to leave. They both cryâ¦..\n\n5ft2.5.\n\nSandy Cowell said on 21/Apr/23\n\nJill has joined the cast of EastEnders and sheâs dating Phil, enjoying dinner with him and his Mum. They looked very cosy together. ðð±ðð±ðð±\n\nPhil should consider himself fortunate to have found a girl\n\nequivalent in height to himself, but then I have never seem him dating a tall girl.\n\n5ft2.75.\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 22/Mar/22\n\nJillâs Rebeccaâs flirtation with the married man didnât stay innocent at all!\n\nNow sheâs gone to Dubai and left him permanently, so Martin comes home and tells wife Gail all about it. Understandably, sheâs about as hurt as a woman can be, but wants to try again.\n\nI wouldnât.\n\n5ft3.\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 4/Jan/22\n\nJill started as Rebecca in Coronation Street at the tail end of 1999. She's working as a nurse and pouring out her marriage problems to Gail's husband, who is also a nurse.\n\nCertainly so far, it looks pretty innocent to me!\n\nFive foot three from what I can see.\n\nð¥ð©ââï¸ð¨ââï¸ðâ\n\nLeesheff85 said on 21/Jan/21\n\nRob how tall would her ex husband craig Conway be? He starred in films doomsday as sol and the descent as a crawler,devils playground plus tv shows the fades and prey. He is listed 5ft 8 but seeing pictures of him with jill I'd guess 5ft 6 1/2 to 5ft 7 maybe\n\nEditor Rob\n\nwith Jill I'd be hard-pressed to envisage him over 5ft 7.\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 25/Nov/19\n\nJill's smile really makes her stand out on the Coronation Street page!\n\n5ft2.5. ðð\n\nNik said on 17/Jul/19\n\nI suppose that 5'5.5\" is a tall height if 5'2.5\" is short!\n\nIt's great to know that Jill's Birthday is on the same day as mine!\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 16/Jul/19\n\nððð Happy Birthday Jill! ððð\n\nSilly me, I forgot to mention that it was Jill's Birthday yesterday. I hope it was a good one! ð\n\n5ft2.5.\n\nðððð°ðððð°ðððð°ðððð°"
