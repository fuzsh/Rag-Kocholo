        "text": "SHE thrives on being busy, which is just as well because Jill Halfpenny's life is a whirl of activity that shows no sign of calming down.\n\nFor the past few months she has been organising her wedding to actor Craig Conway - while also buying a new home, completing a second series of the hit BBC1 drama Waterloo Road, which returns in a fortnight, and appearing in panto.\n\nAnd given that she doesn't want to waste any time starting a family - a large one, at that - Jill will have her hands full for some time to come.\n\n\"We've set a date, booked the church, the band, the photographer and the honeymoon,\" says 31-year-old Jill, excitedly.\n\n\"At the end of last year I knew I'd be busy filming Waterloo Road so we tried to get as much planning as possible out of the way first - it's been a lot of work.\n\n\"We'll definitely start trying for children in a couple of years. I'm really looking forward to starting a family. Two children doesn't seem enough - I want between two and four.\"\n\nFortunately, her hectic schedule didn't stop her seeing fellow Geordie Craig, 30, over Christmas.\n\nThe couple - who met in a stage version of George Orwell's 1984 and got engaged in December 2005 - have been co-starring in Jack & The Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal in their native Newcastle. Craig might play the villainous \"Snot Gobbler\" to her good fairy figure \"Mother Nature\", but Jill knows she has found her Prince Charming. Their big day is rumoured to be taking place once the panto ends in two weeks' time.\n\n\"I'm not going to tell you exactly when it is because it will be a private family do,\" says Jill, who first found fame at the age of 10, with Ant and Dec in Byker Grove.\n\n\"Will there be celebrities there? Yes, in the respect that I have friends who act. But, no, Ant and Dec aren't coming!\"\n\nOnce the wedding is over, Jill and Craig will start renovating the house they have just bought in the North.\n\n\"My New Year's resolution is to take my time doing it up,\" she says. \"I'm so impatient, I want it all done tomorrow. But I'm determined to enjoy living there and the process of doing it up, rather than thinking it's a pain.\"\n\nAfter appearing in Coronation Street, EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing, there is no doubt that Jill is the more famous of the two. Luckily, that doesn't bother Craig.\n\n\"He doesn't mind that I'm more recognisable,\" she says. \"If we're in a restaurant and people ask for a picture he'll be the first to offer to take it.\n\n\"We respect each other, make each other laugh, fancy each other, confide in each other and are best friends as well.\"\n\nShe has clearly not been put off having kids by her experience of unruly teenagers in a failing comprehensive in Waterloo Road, in which she plays teacher Izzie Redpath.\n\nLast time, Izzie got together with Tom Clarkson. But their romance is rocked in the new series when Tom's ex-wife Lorna returns to the school.\n\n\"Neither Izzie nor Tom are sure why she's sticking around, and it causes a rift between them,\" says Jill.\n\n\"I'd never have the patience to teach. Nowadays teachers have to cope with disciplining teenagers as well as teaching them. You hear parents saying how difficult their kids are being - imagine having a whole class of them. They do an unbelievable job.\n\n\"It was hard being away from home during filming in Manchester. It's hard enough being away from Craig. I can't imagine what it would be like to be away from your children - you'd miss them terribly.\n\n\"Craig and I go through our diaries to find out when we can next see each other. We spend ages on the phone - I dread the mobile bill coming in.\"\n\nJill's Waterloo Road co-stars include Denise Welch, who played her best friend's mum in Byker Grove.\n\n\"She's exactly the same,\" she says. \"Full of beans, really chatty, makes me laugh and always has a good bit of gossip.\"\n\nJill has barely stopped working since playing schoolgirl Nicola Dobson in Byker Grove, and has learned to accept the accolades and deal with the knockbacks.\n\n\"The minute I'm told I haven't got a job I plan ahead to my next audition,\" she says. \"I always look forward, not back. I have been lucky, I know hundreds of fantastic actors who don't work as much as I do. One day I'd like to get into films.\"\n\nYet asked where she would like to be in 10 years' time - a single star in Hollywood, or married with kids in Newcastle - she doesn't hesitate: \"Marriage and children, definitely.\"\n\nThough still ambitious, being in her thirties has changed her outlook. \"I'm more confident and less worried about what people think of me,\" she says. \"I think there's a ridiculous amount of focus on skinny celebrities. If I wasn't an actress I'd be less aware of the pressure to be thin, but I have to be fit for my job. Plus, I don't want to get to 60 and not be able to touch my toes.\n\n\"My 20s were spent on my career, but as you get older you start thinking of other people, which is fantastic. Who wants to go through their whole life thinking just about themselves?\"\n\nantonia.hoyle@mirror.co.uk\n\nWATERLOO Road returns to BBC1 on January 18."
