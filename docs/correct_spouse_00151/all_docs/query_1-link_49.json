        "text": "Dark Mon£y: Jill Halfpenny stars in thrilling teaser for BBC drama\n\nJill Halfpenny, 44, opened up about her partner’s death for the first time on Line of Duty actor's Craig Parkinson podcast The Two Shot Podcast.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress, who played Kate Mitchell in the soap, spoke about the heartache she felt after her partner, Matt, passed away when he suffered a heart attack at the gym.\n\nJill said his death mirrored that of her father, Colin Halfpenny, who also died of a heart attack in 1979.\n\nInitially speaking about her father’s death, Jill went on to say: “I experienced something I've never ever spoken about so bear with me.\n\n“Something happened a couple of years ago that I’ve never spoke about and it’s weird it feels like a part of my life is missing.”\n\nShe said: “In January 2017 my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, he went to a peloton class at the gym and he had a heart attack and died.”\n\nHer voice breaking, Jill went on to say: “My grief at losing Matt, my partner, was so brutal and so shocking but then what happened was it brought out all of my grief from my dad as well.\n\n“It was like dealing with a double loss - a loss I'd never actually dealt with.\"\n\nJill opened up on the “unbearable” pain she felt and how she struggled to cope with her feelings following his death.\n\nShe said: \"I just found myself thinking oh my God, this is unbearable what am I gonna do, I cannot cope. I just want cessation, the feeling to stop.”\n\nJill candidly continued: “It was too much, it was overbearing.\n\n“I’m a fairly sort of industrious. I thought to myself I’ve got a child, I’ve got to get through this, but I’m not gonna put this in a box, I’m going to feel every single feeling that comes my way.”\n\n“It’s really weird what life gives you, and what the universe has planned for you,” she reflected.\n\nJill added: “By facing it, it has freed me up, unlocked something in me.”\n\nThe star recently spoke about her father’s death in an interview with The Radio Times, where she said he went out to play a game of football, and suffered a heart attack in the middle of the match.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I'll be my own rescuer’’.”\n\nJill married fellow actor Craig Conway in 2007 but divorced in 2010, they have one child together."
