        "text": "\"Something happened a couple of years ago - I experienced something I've never ever spoken about,\" she began, as she told how she felt a part of her life was missing.\n\nHer voice breaking, she said: \"In January 2017 my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, went to the gym, had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nAnd her sudden loss was so brutal and shocking, that \"what happened was that it brought all of my grief from my dad as well; it was like dealing with a double loss - a loss I'd never dealt with.\"\n\nThe actress, originally from Gateshead , added how she thought: \"Oh my god, it's unbearable. I cannot cope with these feelings. I just want cessation: the feeling to stop.\"\n\nThe Two Shots Podcast , hosted by Line of Duty actor Craig Parkinson, recorded the pair in recent conversation in London and online listeners are warned that they might want to postpone hearing its 'sad and brutal but incredibly honest' content if they are not feeling in a good place themselves.\n\nBut those who have tuned it have been sharing their admiration for the award-winning actress's honesty.\n\nOne Twitter comment said of it: \"Compelling, moving. Privilege to listen\" and on Facebook Rachael Flasczak wrote: \"Just listened! Wow! Really interesting, and heart breaking but also gives you the strength to know life is better when you talk.\"\n\nThe conversation covers a range of topics and also includes plenty laughter, ending on an upbeat note.\n\nThe Bay actor Dan Ryan also tweeted the actress to say: \"Thank you Jill for being so damn honest. That was an unbelievably powerful chat. On a train, laughing and crying and learning and growing. Feel like a better person for listening and Iâ€™d encourage ANYONE to get their ears around it. x\"\n\nFormer Coronation Street and EastEnders actress Halfpenny , who won extra fans with her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing, has an acting CV which takes in stage roles including Legally Blonde which won her an Olivier Award and a recent part in BBC series Dark Money, which saw her speak about being put through the emotional wringer .\n\nDuring the podcast, she discussed her early acting days, appearing in local theatre and Byker Grove where she spent her teenage years from 13 to 17, then tells of the \"brutal\" effect of losing her father in an instant, when he left the family home to play football one day and never came back.\n\nWhile she has had therapy over the years, the attitude of the time saw her family \"get on with things\" and her own reaction was to counteract her mother's unhappiness by acting happy - but she then would go to her bedroom and cry.\n\nWith acting, Halfpenny said she was always \"very happy to be someone else\" and described how she often questioned herself and has found many situations a struggle, such as making small talk at parties - which she found exhausting as it was a performance.\n\nBut she told Craig Parkinson: \"Sitting here with you now is quite relaxing for me: it's true.\"\n\nHalfpenny, who was previously married to North East actor Craig Conway and has a son, says she has now adopted an attitude of not putting emotions away in a box but instead experiences every feeling despite the hurt.\n\nMentioning \"post-traumatic growth\", she added: \"I'm becoming a different person.\""
