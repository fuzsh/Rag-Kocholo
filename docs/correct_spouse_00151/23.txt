Geordie acting couple Jill Halfpenny and Craig Conway have been talking about their new life together ahead of their wedding.

Ex-EastEnders actress Jill and fellow actor Craig met four years ago when they both starred in a stage version of George Orwell's classic novel 1984 at the Newcastle Playhouse.

The couple, both 30, share a flat in London and plan to tie the knot at St Andrew's Church in Newcastle.

They have asked Theatre Royal set designer Neil Murray to design the backdrop for their reception.

After pondering a venue for some time, the couple settled on a church wedding. Jill said: "In the end we settled for a big wedding for family and friends in Newcastle because it's where our roots are."

Giving Jill away will be Derek Halfpenny, who raised Jill after her real father Colin collapsed and died during an amateur football match when Jill was four.

Jill says Colin remains in her thoughts, especially on the day she chose her dress.

In an interview with Hello magazine, Jill explained: "On my dad's birthday I went to a bridal studio and there was the dress - it was almost as if he'd guided me there.

"When I tried it on, my mum burst into tears. There's no question about it, weddings are hugely emotional."

The big day itself has been put back to February because of work commitments. "And when you're an actor, you don't complain about that," said Jill.

Among those commitments is a joint appearance in Jack and the Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal this Christmas.

Jill said: "I'm playing Mother Nature and Craig's playing a character called Snot Gobbler. We won't really come up for air until the end of January - just in time for the wedding."

The couple say they are planning to start a family.

Craig said: "We are definitely getting ready for parenthood. We talk about it a lot. I think we know it's coming but there are still some things we want to do as a couple first."
