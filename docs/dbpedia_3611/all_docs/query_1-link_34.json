        "meta_description": "The Jinjiang horse is a unique Chinese indigenous horse breed distributed in the southern coastal areas, but the ancestry of Jinjiang horses is not well understood. Here, we used Equine SNP70 Bead Array technology to genotype 301 horses representing 10 Chinese indigenous horse breeds, and we integrated the published genotyped data of 352 individuals from 14 foreign horse breeds to study the relationships between Jinjiang horses and horse breeds from around the world. Principal component analysis (PCA), linkage disequilibrium (LD), runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis, and ancestry estimating methods were conducted to study the population relationships and the ancestral sources and genetic structure of Jinjiang horses. The results showed that there is no close relationship between foreign horse breeds and Jinjiang horses, and Jinjiang horses shared a similar genetic background with Baise horses. TreeMix analysis revealed that there was gene flow from Chakouyi horses to Jinjiang horses. The ancestry analysis showed that Baise horses and Chakouyi horses are the most closely related ancestors of Jinjiang horses. In conclusion, our results showed that Jinjiang horses have a native origin and that Baise horses and Chakouyi horses were key ancestral sources of Jinjiang horses. The study also suggested that ancient trade activities and the migration of human beings had important effects on indigenous horse breeds in China.",

Refer to the original study to confirm details provided. Submit correction.\n\nThis study unravels the origins of the Jinjiang horse, a unique breed from the coastal regions of China, using advanced genotyping technology. The research suggests that Jinjiang horses are indigenous to southern China, primarily sharing a genetic background with Baise and Chakouyi horses.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe researchers employed Equine SNP70 Bead Array technology to genotype 301 horses from 10 different indigenous Chinese breeds.\n\nThis data was integrated with previous genotyping data from 352 horses across 14 foreign breeds to compare and contrast the genetic makeup of Jinjiang horses with other horse breeds globally.\n\nAnalysis Techniques\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA), linkage disequilibrium (LD), and runs of homozygosity (ROH) analyses were utilized to study the population relationships.\n\nAncestry estimating methods were used to determine the ancestral sources and genetic structure of Jinjiang horses.\n\nFindings\n\nThe study revealed that there wasnâ€™t a close genetic relationship between Jinjiang horses and the foreign horse breeds used in the comparison.\n\nSimilarities were found between the gene pool of Jinjiang and Baise horses, indicating a shared genetic lineage between the two breeds.\n\nAnalysis through TreeMix revealed gene flow from Chakouyi horses into Jinjiang horses, suggesting natural horse breeding or intentional crossbreeding in the past.\n\nAncestry analysis showed Baise and Chakouyi horses as the closest relatives to Jinjiang horses, thus suggesting that they are the main ancestral sources of this coastal breed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe study concluded that Jinjiang horses have native origins and are not related to foreign breeds.\n\nIt indicates that Baise horses and Chakouyi horses played a critical role as primary ancestral sources of Jinjiang horses.\n\nThe research also suggests that historical trade activities and human migration significantly influenced indigenous horse breeds in China.\n\nCite This Article\n\nAPA\n\nMa H, Wang S, Zeng G, Guo J, Guo M, Dong X, Hua G, Liu Y, Wang M, Ling Y, Ding X, Zhao C, Wu C.
