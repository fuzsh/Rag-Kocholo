        "text": "Lingzi Xiaoli joined ORPB as an associate service fellow with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology. Previously, she worked as a contract microbiologist, specializing in whole genome sequencing wet-lab assay developments for different platforms. She has also worked as a microbiologist and bioinformatician at CDC. Lingzi has a BS in food quality and safety from China Agricultural University, an MS in molecular biology and biochemistry from the Institute of Biophysics of Chinese Academy Sciences, and a PhD in food science, with a concentration in food microbiology and a minor in statistics, from Pennsylvania State University. As a fellow, Lingzi hopes to gain field training, learn epidemiology tools and languages, and understand the partner needs to help combat infectious diseases in the future. In her free time, Lingzi enjoys hiking, skiing, traveling, and trying new food."
