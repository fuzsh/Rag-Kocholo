Only a very few Chinese scholars and remaining Naxi are able to read it.\n\nThe digitization of Harvard-Yenching Libraryâ€™s 600-plus Naxi manuscripts is being shared with scholars in China, who will add translations to the collection that will preserve the record of the customs, religious practices, and daily life of the Naxi people."
