        "text": "How was the start of your semester here?\n\n-The introduction and welcome service from school are super nice and considerate. I got a welcome email in advance to introduce life and study in Sweden and also got a checklist. It was super nice to have the pick up service from the central station welcome package and guided tour around campus. I met many friends at Welcome Fair and many other welcome activities held by IntU. The School also introduced exchange students to student buddies so that I could find help when I was new in Sweden.\n\nHow did you prepare for your exchange semester in Gothenburg?\n\n-I prepared the IELTS-test and other supporting materials for the application process. When I got the exchange opportunity, I booked flight tickets and a residence permit in advance. And also, I prepared some necessities which I thought might be hard to find in Gothenburg, I even brought a rice cooker from China. However, it turns out that I could buy almost everything in Gothenburg,\n\nHow is the atmosphere at the School?\n\n-International and friendly. In the courses I took there were students from different countries besides Sweden. Every faculty member and student I met were super friendly!\n\nHow was your social life as an exchange student at the School?\n\n-Social life at the School was beyond my expectation. The student union often held activities like island trip, international dinner, balling night and so on. And there are many activities in student Facebook groups, everything from from a Lappland trip to second hand market shopping. Last but not least, I met many friends at Olofshöjd student apartments and we often cooked together.\n\nWhat are the teachers like?\n\n-They are professional and willing to help every student. My Econometrics teacher Mr. Andreas Dzemski not only provided me with many learning materials for beginners but also gave me some suggestion when choosing further study.\n\nIf you could give any tips to future exchange students, what would you share?\n\n-The winter daytime in Sweden is quite short, buying some decoration lights and spending time with friends will help you survive the depression caused by darkness.\n\nHow did you solve your housing situation?\n\n-I received an email, which instructed me how to book a student apartment on the SGS website. It was very easy and SGS provided many housing options.\n\nHow would you say you experienced life in Gothenburg?\n\n-I loved it so much! Choosing to be an exchange student in Gothenburg is the best decision I have ever made during my college life. I met so many friends and had unforgettable memories here.\n\nHow was it to live here and not speak Swedish?\n\n-There is no problem if you only speak English in Sweden. All the courses I took were in English and every Swedish person I met spoke English.\n\nYour favourite memory from your time as an exchange student?\n\n-The island trip with my friends in Gothenburg in the Gothenburg’s fantastic autumn."
