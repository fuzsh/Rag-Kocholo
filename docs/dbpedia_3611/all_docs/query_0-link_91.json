        "text": "Lingzi was born on August 17, 1989, to a loving traditional Chinese family. As an only child, her arrival brought so much joy to her parents and grandparents. Since she was a toddler, she had a great love of books. She followed her grandpa everywhere because he always had a lot of books around him.\n\nShe was also the family entertainer and loved performing for her parents. As her grandmother put it, “where there was Lingzi, there was fun.”\n\nThrough her school years, she pushed herself to study hard and never stopped challenging herself; setting goals higher and higher. While pursuing academic success with great determination and discipline, she blossomed into a young lady who also enjoyed playing piano and loved nature’s gifts with great curiosity as well as gained a true appreciation for food.\n\nShe had a tender heart towards animals, especially those in need, and a big heart for the people around her.\n\nOn April 15, 2013, her journey stopped unexpectedly on Boylston Street in Boston, while cheering on the marathon runners at the finish line, she had given her best until the very last moment.\n\nThe Lingzi Foundation has been proud to host the annual Lingzi Dream Dash 5k Run/Walk. It is a great way to connect with our runners, supporters and communities. Whether in-person or virtual, we have seen the community’s everlasting strength and unwavering support in carrying Lingzi’s spirit."
