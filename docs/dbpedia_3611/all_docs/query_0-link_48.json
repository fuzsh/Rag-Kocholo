        "text": "BEIJING — She was a food fan, eager for culinary discoveries. In her last microblog update the morning before the Boston Marathon blasts, the Chinese graduate student identified as the attack’s third victim posted a photo of ciabatta-like bread chunks and fruit.\n\n“My wonderful breakfast,” Boston University statistics student Lu Lingzi wrote.\n\nBoston University confirmed Wednesday that Lu was studying mathematics and statistics at the school and was due to receive her graduate degree in 2015.\n\nIt said she and two friends had been watching the marathon near the finish line. One of the friends, also a BU student, was injured while the other was unharmed.\n\nChinese state media said Lu was from the northeastern city of Shenyang.\n\nReports of her death drew an outpouring of comments and condolences from friends and strangers, both on Lu’s Sina Weibo account — with nearly 20,000 comments as of Wednesday — and on their own. Her former neighbor in Shenyang, Zhang Xinbo, lamented how the news brought home the tragedy. “I think of her loved ones, and I don’t know how they are coping with this painful news …,” he wrote on his blog."
