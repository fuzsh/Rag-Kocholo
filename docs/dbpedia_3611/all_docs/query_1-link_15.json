        "text": "The third person killed in the Boston Marathon bombings was a Chinese graduate student at Boston University named Lu Lingzi, a state-run Chinese newspaper reported Wednesday.\n\nThe Shenyang Evening News said on its official Twitter-like microblog account that she is from the northeastern city of Shenyang.\n\nAn editor at the newspaper told the Associated Press that Lu's father confirmed his daughter's death when reporters visited the family home. The editor declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to foreign media, AP reported.\n\nA Hong Kong broadcaster reported the student was studying statistics. Lu graduated from a Shenyang high school and studied international trade at Beijing Institute of Technology before enrolling at Boston University, according to media reports, Lu's friends and her Facebook page.\n\nAn official at the consulate's press section, who was not authorized to give his name, told the Associated Press that one Chinese student was injured and another died in the blast. The official said a work group from the consulate was in Boston to investigate the situation and assist relatives.\n\nThe BU statement said that the students were two of three friends who watched the race near the finish line. The injured student had surgery on both Monday and Tuesday and was in stable condition at Boston Medical Center. The third student was not hurt in the blasts.\n\nRev. Robert Hill, the dean of Boston University's Marsh Chapel, visited the injured grad student at the hospital. \"She is doing well,\" Hill told Boston University's news service, BU Today. \"She has her friends around her, and she will soon have family around her.\"\n\nIn a letter of condolence, Brown said: \"I write to you with great sadness to inform you that one of the fatalities in yesterday's bombing near the finish line of the Boston Marathon has been identified as a Boston University graduate student.\"\n\n\"Our hearts and thoughts go out to the family and friends of both victims,\" he wrote.\n\nBoston University held a vigil at the campus chapel on Tuesday evening to commemorate the victims.\n\n\"Now that we know just how seriously the Boston University community has been affected by yesterday's events, this vigil takes on a deeper and more somber significance,\" Brown said.\n\nThe bombs at the Boston Marathon went off seconds apart around 3 p.m. near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street. Three people were killed and more than 170 were injured. The two other victims were Martin Richard, 8, of Dorchester, Mass., and Krystle Campbell, 29, of Arlington, Mass."
