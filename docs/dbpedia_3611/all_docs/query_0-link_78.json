        "text": "Chinese media say that global focus on the Boston marathon bombings is skewed, as the public continues to mourn the death of a Chinese student killed in the blasts.\n\nPeople's Daily, external and Global Times , externalsay the Western media have placed \"disproportionately high\" attention on Boston compared with terrorist attacks in Iraq and elsewhere or the earthquake on the Iran-Pakistan border.\n\nTa Kung Pao,, external a Hong Kong Beijing-backed daily, tells the US that its biggest threat is from terrorism, not China, and stresses that the Pacific is big enough to accommodate China and the US.\n\nIt accuses US President Barack Obama of turning China into a \"new enemy\" by expanding its military presence in Asia and boosting military alliances with Asian countries.\n\nThe majority of mainland state media continue to stay silent on the identity of Dorothy Lu Lingzi, a Chinese student from north-east Shenyang, who was one of three people killed by the Boston marathon bombings.\n\nThis has fuelled even more speculation among internet users on whether the student was the daughter of a \"naked official\" - a reference to officials who transfer assets and their families overseas.\n\nBeijing News commentator Yang Gengshen, external criticises how photos and the identity of the student are already widespread on the internet.\n\nHe says netizens speculating over the student's identity are being \"disrespectful\" towards the request for anonymity from the deceased's family.\n\nShenyang Evening News , externalsays local residents held a candlelight vigil for \"Little Lu\" last night.\n\nShenyang Daily, external recounts how her last microblog entry on Monday showed a photo of bread and fruit and the message, \"My wonderful breakfast\". Over 25,000 condolence messages were posted on the entry.\n\n\"I had not thought that this would be your last breakfast,\" read one. Another said: \"May you rest in peace,\" South China Morning Post , externalreports."
