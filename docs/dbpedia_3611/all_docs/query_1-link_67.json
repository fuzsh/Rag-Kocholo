        "text": "Hope all are having a terrific summer...and now for the fourth installment of __Hypatia Onboards: The Mini-Series__ . In the heart of August we're going to talk about risk management. That's right, more pitching of my new firm‚Äôs capabilities and sharing insights from the Leathwaite team! Three (count 'em) co-authors for this episode: Rosie Gibson, Consultant in the Legal, Risk and Compliance (LRC) practice and our compliance functional expert, Lisa Zonino, Senior Advisor also in LRC with deep experience in risk management and HR (and a mentor), and finally Steven Kaufman, Director in the Technology practice and a cybersecurity specialist. This killer article (üëá) focuses on how risk management in financial services continues to transform in response to regulatory pressures, technological advancements, and evolving market demands. We highlight several themes in 2024 that are shaping the function‚Äôs future: - The increasing scope, complexity and scale of what enterprise risk management means for leadership talent; - Organizational upskilling to bridge the talent gap alongside innovative recruitment strategies; - Cybersecurity leaders moving from first line roles to second line cybergovernance roles within risk; - Non-financial risk expertise alongside credit/market/liquidity, design thinking, commercial acumen all to the fore; - Interest in diversifying risk and compliance leadership remains and compliance continues to have higher representation vs other risk functions; Enjoy the waning summer days, read more and learn more (like I am!) below as I am ALMOST FINISHED onboarding at Leathwaite! #Leadership #HumanCapital #RiskManagement #FinancialServices\n\nWelcome once again for the third episode of __Hypatia Onboards: The Mini-Series__ where I practice pitching my new firm‚Äôs capabilities and share insights from our terrific team at Leathwaite! My co-author and faculty member for this episode is Jaemi Taylor, a Director in our Human Resources Practice. Jaemi co-leads the HR Practice in the Americas, focusing on strategic senior-level placements in human capital for both both public and private Fortune 500 clients as well as private equity-backed companies. Her 20+ year career has honed her expertise as a trusted and accomplished talent advisor. Jaemi's article (üëá) focuses on the increasing gaps in private capital portfolio company leadership and how progressive private capital organizations are willing to think outside of the existing talent box: - Lengthened investment horizons and more complex deals are shrinking the pool for \"been-there-done-that\" experience; - Private capital's ability to gauge a leader's potential must improve, a huge challenge given volatility; - Experiential use cases such as transformation and turnarounds can indicate potential, and longer horizons allow more time for talent development internally and benchmarking externally; - increasing diversity is overdue as diverse hires can tap into more wells of potential; - Human capital leaders are becoming sophisticated partners to both investment teams and portfolio companies; - This new breed of leader can challenge norms and widen the aperture of diversity within the talent pool for private capital.

Next up on the faculty front are Kaila (Malone) Rakin and Helen Parker, two stellar Consultants in our CFO practice. Helen has been with us for seven years and has worked in both our London and New York offices and specializes in both financial services and private equity portfolio companies. Kaila joined us eight years ago and has a specialization in CFOs as well as other executive roles in financial services and corporate roles in private equity. Kaila and Helen‚Äôs article (üëá) highlights the latest in Financial Officer leadership as we enter the second half of 2024: - default elevation of the CFO role is having impact on other financial officers; - CFO profiles have decidedly changed (only one of the 20 new Fortune 100 CFOs in 2023 has a CPA), creating larger technical and leadership gaps in the accounting and tax functions; - As a consequence, the roles of the Chief Accounting Officer and Chief Tax Officer are on the ascendancy with higher expectations for their own transformative impact; - These pressures are driving a looming succession crisis in senior tax leadership across the sector; - Technology debt is felt acutely in finance organizations, and those orgs who automated early and often (for example big tech companies) are winning the talent wars; - Diversity amongst financial officers has shown incremental improvement and yet the risks of ‚Äúglass cliffs‚Äù remain real.

A literal generation having passed since I have onboarded into a new company, it seems apropos to acknowledge my learning curve at Leathwaite as Head of Americas. So welcome to __Hypatia Onboards: The Mini-Series__ where I get to practice pitching the firm‚Äôs capabilities and share insights from our fantastic team. First up amongst my multi-generational faculty is Shafali Goutam, one of our outstanding Senior Associates. A veteran herself of startups and global firms alike, Shafali works daily with CXOs in technology and operations across a wide swath of banking, alternative investments, market infrastructure, payments and fintech. Shafali‚Äôs article (üëá) highlights several themes in tech and ops leadership across sectors as we enter the second half of 2024: - A shifting landscape of Return to Work strategies as preferences for flexibility persist; - Talent seeks roles with meaningful impact while employers want transformational track records; - Realignment of shared platforms to increase operational efficiency; - Strategic leveraging of today‚Äôs AI and a voracious appetite to understand tomorrow‚Äôs; - Increasing ubiquity and complexity of cybersecurity embedded in architecture, controls, and governance; - Sustained interest in diversity, equity, inclusion and sustainability. Any of these themes resonating with you? Tell us more and learn more (like I am!) below‚Ä¶ and stay tuned for my next lesson at Leathwaite! #Leadership #Innovation #Transformation #FinancialServices\n\nAfter more than twenty wonderful years at Spencer Stuart, I am delighted to finally announce that I have joined Leathwaite as their new Head of Americas. A fantastic global leadership advisory boutique with an equally fantastic reputation and team, Leathwaite will be my new home beginning June 3rd. For the next several months I will be spending considerable time in both New York and Seattle as I settle into this new rhythm. I hope to cross paths with many of you along the way!\n\nTons of useful data in this C-Suite Snapshot regarding diversity and internal/external talent across 11 leadership roles within the Fortune 500. I find a few facts particularly interesting: - Fortune 500 CEOs have an average tenure 52% longer than the C-suite average. - Chief operating officers (80%) are the most likely to be promoted from within, followed by CEOs (77%). COOs also turn over more \"likely because the role often is meant to be a temporary development position for CEO aspirants.\" - Based on our data the CEO and COO roles also exhibit the least diverse leadership population within the Fortune 500. 21% and 19% respectively are women and/or members of historically underepresented ethnic and racial groups. - In previous research with the S&P 500, Spencer Stuart has mapped paths to the CEO role from the COO, CFO and skip level leadership and the relative success of those leaders. We found that depending on context, the skip-level rookie can be the most successful (see our 2021 piece on Why Rookie CEOs Outperform). If internal promotion is the likely path to the top job, and lengthier CEO tenure offers potentially one opportunity for change within an organization's talent 'generation', how does the Fortune 500 accelerate internal development of diverse talent to better position their women and leaders from historically underrepresented groups to emerge as CEOs and COOs? Let's talk about it! #diversityinleadership #fortune500"
