        "text": "Lingzi Sang obtained her B.S. degree in Chemistry from Xiamen University (Xiamen, China) in 2009. She went on to the University of Arizona and obtained her Ph.D. in 2015 under the guidance of Prof. Jeanne E. Pemberton. During this period, she developed molecular understandings associated to charge transfer efficiencies at the critical interfaces in organic photoelectronic devices. She was awarded the Outstanding Research Scholar, Galileo Circle Scholar, and the Carl S. Marvel Fellow. She then moved to Champaign-Urbana for her postdoctoral research at the University of Illinois under the supervision of Prof. Andrew A. Gewirth and Prof. Ralph G. Nuzzo. During her postdoctoral training, she worked on multidisciplinary measurements at electrode and electrolyte interfaces in all-solid lithium ion batteries and unraveled molecular level origins that responsible to battery shorting and capacity fade. Lingzi joined the University of Alberta as an Assistant Professor Aug. 2018. The Sang research group focus on electrochemistry and spectroscopy measurements at critical interfaces in all-solid energy conversion and storage systems.\n\nThe Sang group will develop multi-disciplinary characterization approaches to understand the fundamental processes associated with the critical interfaces in all-solid energy storage and conversion systems. We will engage our expertise in analytical spectroscopy, electrochemistry and materials chemistry to develop a range of suitable tools including electrochemical measurements, in-operando vibrational and synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy. The knowledge of solid-solid interfacial processes will ultimately enable the optimized molecular design at the interface for promoted device performances. The current three major research directions in the Sang lab include: (1) control the electrode/electrolyte interfaces for all-solid sodium batteries; (2) understanding hysteresis of Perovskite Solar Cells; (3) investigate material structures under mechanical stresses."
