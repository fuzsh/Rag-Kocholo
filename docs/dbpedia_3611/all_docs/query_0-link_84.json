        "text": "Beijing-based Jiu, 33, whose real name is Zhu Zhiping, aims to paint a realistic picture of China's 'sexually dishonest women' in a book which is soon to be released in English. She is also hard on the heels of Mian Mian and Wei Hui, authors who provoked outrage by writing up the amoral behaviour of their generation. Although some of Jiu's contemporaries have called her a 'prostitutes' writer', she responds by saying she is just a camera, a neutral observer.\n\n'I want to present readers with a real picture of Chinese women as they are today. Chinese girls do go abroad for prostitution,' Jiu says. 'All the others just want to blow up a false, plastic woman and say that is reality.'\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, the daughter of a retired People's Liberation Army officer, Jiu studied journalism in Chongqing, before she worked on a number of prestigious television documentary series like Deng Xiaoping And China's Economic Reforms and Xiaoping, Ni Hao. She worked as an independent producer before she started to write novels and then in 1995 travelled to Singapore for two years to study English. In the past, Chinese women went abroad to study so they could return and help save their motherland.\n\nIn Crows (Lingzi Media $98), Jiu paints a rather different picture of her generation, however. The book, translated into English by Alan Chong, recounts the gripping story of two 'little dragon girls' who go to Singapore, ostensibly to study English, but who spend their nights working the nightclubs and bars, trawling for sugar daddies.\n\n'So many Chinese girls are attracted to foreign men, like moths to a flame,' Jiu explains. 'They are desperate to find a better life.' Drawing on its writer's own experiences and press reports, the novel is roughly based on what happened to a classmate of Jiu's who became a nightclub hostess and then the mistress of an older man in the hope of gaining permanent residency in Singapore. Mainland girls borrow heavily to raise enough money to pay for their tickets, tuition fees and living expenses in the city state.\n\nThey cannot obtain work permits, however, and those who do earn money in nightclubs fear they would lose face if they failed to return home without making a fortune abroad. When, after three years, the affairs run out, her visa expires and the man does not agree to marry her, Jiu's character, Helen, explodes in anger and frustration. 'So she shoots the man with a gun they had both used to play shooting games with. In the past, it [the weapon] was never loaded but this time it had bullets in it. Afterwards she claims it was an accident,' Jiu says, adding she doesn't know if her classmate was ever sentenced.\n\nIn Chinese literature, women are often either cast as the pitiful victims of a traditional, patriarchical and Confucian society or as tender home-lovers who are driven to prostitution by the cruelties of heartless capitalism. Some Chinese readers are finding it hard to accept this new image of their nation's women as the fiercest predators in the sexual jungle.\n\n'[Jiu] is simply a degenerate. This is a shameful work which humiliates those Chinese girls overseas,' says one contributor to a mainland Web site, one of hundreds of people who have accused Jiu of making up stories to win notoriety and sell books.\n\nThe notion that Chinese women could be hard-nosed and manipulative ought not to be so shocking. In many earlier autobiographical works by Jung Chang, Nien Cheng and books describing the life of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, Chinese women hardly come across as kittens; often they are pitiless revolutionaries and ruthless class warriors. Nevertheless, Jiu has the kind of brash self-confidence that is unique to her generation. 'My novel has been criticised by more than 80 per cent of readers. I am the only person who praises the book,' she says before she lashes out at the older generation of writers like Wang Anyi.\n\n'For a long time, there has been a fake culture in China,' she says, blaming more established writers for creating a false picture of Chinese women as tender young hearts searching for ideal love. What they really want, Jiu adds, is loads of money and a foreign passport, and her earlier works, Ai Shang (Brief Passion) and Piao Bo Nuren (Vagabond Women), have tried to set the story straight. It is just the sort of brassy approach that delights Wang Shuo, the doyenne of Chinese 'hooligan' literature, who is among the few who have spoken up in Jiu's defence. 'Without any fear of losing face, Jiu bares her soul,' Wang Shuo writes. 'It is without any of the literary pretensions that other Chinese writers suffer from.'\n\nJiu has also traded insults with the other writers in the new generation of Chinese 'chick lit'. Their row follows an earlier spat between Wei and another chronicler of the 'me generation', Mian Mian, which encouraged the sales of both their works.\n\nWei, the author of Shanghai Baby, first accused Jiu of writing 'prostitute literature', and then of 'selling her own body', according to Yazhou Zhoukan. Then Wei charged her fellow writer with going to any lengths to gain publicity. 'A friend told me in Beijing that this woman wanted to bribe officials . . . to ban her book. Is she crazy? Or is she trying to emulate the success of my book after it was banned?' Wei wrote, referring to the burning in public of her own best-seller.\n\nSina.com's Cultural Forum Web site even runs a debate about the phenomenon of 'pretty women writers'. 'It is high time for some of us in cultural circles to stand up and shout, 'Stop!' We need a cultural renaissance,' one contributor writes. 'These modern writers are actually misleading people. Too many people are smoking drugs and watching pornographic films - and this is the fault of these modern writers.'\n\nYet Jiu claims she is becoming the true voice of a generation. 'Within the next five years, I will become the spokeswoman of the majority of writers,' she says with typical self-assurance. The author plans to write two more novels set in Singapore and in the same vein, Fenghuang (Phoenix) and Xique (Magpies). Jiu adds that the outrage Crows sparked in Singapore is proof that her observations are not just titillation but on target. Her book has sold 10,000 copies in Singapore and started a heated debate among the island state's men who have been outraged by the unflattering picture she paints of them and their womenfolk, who are pleased by the attention it draws to a genuine problem.\n\n'In my circle of friends, I know of quite a number of homes which were wrecked by Chinese women,' a 30-year-old Singaporean woman told the island state's Lianhe Wanbao newspaper. The book, which has also sold 50,000 copies on the mainland and perhaps another 100,000 in pirated copies from Changsha, has helped to undermine Singapore's well-ordered image.\n\n'Singaporean people always think of themselves as somehow better than the Chinese, while the Chinese girls who have been born in a dirty place and want to enjoy Singapore's blue skies sometimes look down on themselves,' Jiu says. 'Now people see Singapore differently.'"
