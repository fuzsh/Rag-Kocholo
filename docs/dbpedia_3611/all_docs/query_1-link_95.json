        "text": "Updated 12:10 p.m. Eastern Time\n\nLu Lingzi, a 23-year-old graduate student in statistics at Boston University, is one of the three people killed in the Boston Marathon bombings, CBS News has confirmed.\n\nLu, who hailed from industrial Shenyang in northeastern China, was with two friends watching the race at the finish line, according to the university. Another BU student from China, Zhou Danling, was seriously injured in the attacks but is recovering at Boston Medical Center.\n\nBoston University has not yet released Lu's name, though it was revealed overnight in a state-run Chinese newspaper and has been independently confirmed by CBS News.\n\nThe New York Times reported that China is in mourning over Lu's death, with her account on the Twitter-like site Weibo attracting thousands of condolence messages. Lu, who had aspired to a career in finance, had embraced Christianity while in the United States. Her last message on Weibo, posted Monday morning, showed a fruit salad accompanied by the words, \"My wonder breakfast!\"\n\nIn an email to CBSNews.com, a fellow Chinese graduate student at Boston University who posted a photo of Lu on Facebook Tuesday described her as \"such a good girl.\"\n\nLu is the third fatality to be identified from the bombings. Eight-year-old Martin Richard and 29-year-old Krystle Campbell were also killed in the attacks. As of Tuesday, 27 people remained in Boston-area hospitals in critical condition.\n\nCampbell, a restaurant manager who was at the race with her best friend, was hailed by her mother on Tuesday as a \"wonderful person\" who was loved by everyone who knew her.\n\n\"She was always smiling, friendly,\" said Patty Campbell, through tears. \"I couldn't ask for a better daughter. And I can't believe this is happening.\"\n\nPatty Campbell and her husband William were initially informed that their daughter was alive and in surgery. When they got to Mass General hospital they discovered that the young woman being operated on was not their daughter.\n\nWilliam Campbell described his daughter to the Associated Press as a \"very caring, very loving person,\" adding that she \"was daddy's little girl.\"\n\nMartin Richard, from the tight-knit community of Dorchester, Mass., was described as a caring boy with a love of learning who liked to climb trees in his neighborhood.\n\nHis mother Denise, the school librarian at his school, was badly injured in the attacks, and reportedly underwent emergency brain surgery Monday to save her life. His younger sister Jane, also a student at Pope John Paul II Catholic Academy, reportedly lost one of her legs. Martin's older brother and father were unharmed."
