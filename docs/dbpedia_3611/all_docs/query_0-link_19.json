        "text": "More than 20%2C000 people posted messages on her micro-blog\n\nShe often shared her life%2C likes and dislikes online\n\nU.S. Embassy offers help to family members\n\nBEIJING — Many Chinese went online Wednesday to mourn Lü Lingzi, 23, the Boston University graduate student who died in Monday's Boston Marathon explosions. More than 20,000 people posted messages of condolence on her micro-blog, where her final entry featured her last breakfast. Many more people noted their sorrow on other social media platforms.\n\nShe called herself Dorothy Lu in English, but to her parents and the Chinese nation sharing their grief, she will forever be Lü Lingzi, whose given name Lingzi means \"Excellent Child\" in Chinese. She had been living up to that exacting name.\n\nBorn in the northeast province of Liaoning, an industrial heavyweight under China's planned economy that declined into rust belt in more recent, capitalist times, Lü attended the Northeast Yucai School in the provincial capital Shenyang. Yang Yongkun, a former teacher, called Lü \"especially smart, sincere and honest,\" according to the Shenyang Evening News, her hometown newspaper.\n\nIn 2008, she moved to the Chinese capital to study international economics and trade at the Beijing Institute of Technology. From 2010 to 2012, Lü held internships at companies including the Bank of China and Deloitte Consulting, according to her LinkedIn page, then secured a place at Boston last autumn to pursue a master's degree in mathematics and statistics.\n\nFriend and classmate Wes Viles, 29, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate from Brookline, Mass., said Lü, a first-year graduate student, was engaging and interested in meeting people from all walks of life.\n\n\"I met her on the first day, and I just remember seeing how sweet and innocent and kind she was,\" Viles told USA TODAY.\n\nWednesday was a difficult day for the department, and many students wanted to process the tragedy quietly, said Viles and others in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, where Lü studied.\n\nMonday's bombing also claimed the lives of Boston-area residents Martin Richard, 8, and Krystle Campbell, 29.\n\nA post on a Boston University website, BU Today, said Lü was one of three friends who went to watch the marathon. One was not injured; the other was identified as Danling Zhou, who remained in stable condition at Boston Medical Center Wednesday afternoon, according to the report.\n\nBU Chaplain Robert Hill said he had visited the injured woman twice, and \"she has her friends around her, and she will soon have family around her.\"\n\nDespite regular tensions in the U.S.-Chinese relationship, Chinese students flock to U.S. universities in such numbers that they are the leading source of international students in the USA, known as the \"Beautiful Country\" in Chinese.\n\nLike most young, urban Chinese, Lü enjoyed documenting and sharing her life and likes online. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are banned by China's communist authorities because of their capacity to inform and organize protest and opposition, but their domestic, censored versions are hugely popular.\n\nOnce she reached the USA, Lü kept posting on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter equivalent, and could more easily access her Facebook page, where she wrote \"New Hampshire is such a great place!\" last October.\n\nOn Weibo, Lü listed her interests as food, music, reading and finance. She enjoyed posting pictures of cooking experiments, including her first \"successful\" kimchi pancake March 30. She noted unhappier moments, such as the time a professor's criticism \"wrecked\" her good mood March 8.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in China released a condolence statement Wednesday. U.S. government officials \"stand ready to provide any assistance to the family members to ensure they are able to personally deal with this tragedy as quickly and easily as possible,\" it said.\n\nGiven Lü's age, she is probably an only child, as China's strict family planning policies began in the early 1980s. Liu Chun, CEO of top Internet firm Sohu, forwarded a post on his micro-blog about the extreme grief of Lü's relatives because \"a single child is the root of life for a whole family.\" Many other Chinese chimed in with criticism of the one-child policy.\n\nSome state-owned Chinese media used the bombings as a chance Wednesday to criticize what they see as the West's \"double standards\" on terrorists, meaning the failure to meet Beijing's request to crack down on exile groups advocating independence for Xinjiang, China's Muslim province in the far northwest.\n\nSome Chinese found positive signals in China's response to the Boston tragedy. \"When 9.11 happened, many Chinese cheered that the U.S. imperialists had been blown up,\" wrote Anhui province writer Cao Junshu on Weibo. \"But after the Boston bombing, few cheers were seen online, most expressed mourning and concern.\" Cao credits the development of China's Internet with changing people's minds. Official \"brainwashing\" through the media and textbooks is losing influence, he said. \"China's people already know that America is not a totally evil country.\""
