        "text": "I have so many mixed feelings about the making of Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, based on this behind-the-scenes documentary. Ultimately, they made a really brilliant, trashy movie. But at what cost?\n\nWell, not much financial cost, given that hardly anyone got paid. For example, Robin L Watkins, who has a major role as the manager of the chicken shop, was paid $100 for the whole month of shooting until he quit and was given another $300 to complete it. How generous. But it seems that the majority of the cast and crew did it for $0, simply because they wanted to be part of a Troma film. If you're willing to work for no pay, then fair enough,…\n\nLloyd Kaufman has three rules for every film production. These are his gospel, posted in large type around his sets and numbered in order of importance.\n\n1. Safety to people.\n\n2. Safety to property.\n\n3. Make a good film.\n\nAs this behind the scenes documentary shows, he comes nowhere near minimum adherence to the very vague but simple standards of rules 1 and 2, and is even further away from accomplishing rule number 3. Despite his self proclaimed \"160 IQ\" Lloyd is still somehow grossly incompetent at running a set even though he's been doing it for decades. In each making-of documentary, of which there are 5 or 6, he becomes worse at his job.\n\nLloyd is the DIRECTOR (bold,…\n\nI really respect how brutally honest this is on what seemed like mostly a nightmare of a production.\n\nOn one hand it’s admirable seeing so much passion and hard work on such a low budget, and with so many Troma fans volunteering and working long days without pay. But it’s hard not to get that exploitative feeling, with the little to no pay, a lot of wasted time, less than desirable working conditions. On top of Lloyd Kaufman frankly coming across as a a bit of a dick at times who frantically yells and berates a lot of the crew. l can definitely understand why a lot of the cast and crew felt taken advantage of. It makes me feel…"
