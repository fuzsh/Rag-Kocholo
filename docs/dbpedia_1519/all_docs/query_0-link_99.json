        "text": "MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM is a 2022 doc based on the book of the same name by Lizzy Goodman. Directed by Will Lovelace and Dylan Southern, this look at '00s nostalgia focuses on a cluster of rock bands coming out of New York and Brooklyn at the beginning of the George W. Bush era. These bands that went on to define this scene were The Moldy Peaches, The Strokes, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Rapture, LCD Soundsystem, and TV On the Radio - or so this film would have us believe.\n\nIt's inarguable that this cluster of musicians made a lasting impact on music culture and are among the most successful acts still touring. The doc digs in, but is there much dirt to unveil?\n\nOur guest is returning indie rock veteran, publicist Daniel Gill.\n\nMMITB is now available to watch on Showtime\n\nFollow Daniel:\n\nInstagram: @NITARecords\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nIT CAME FROM AQUARIUS RECORDS is a feature-length documentary about the SF-based independent record store, Aquarius Records. Having closed in 2016 after 47 years, this small apartment-sized store championed local, underground, independent, and challenging music to the masses - most memorably with their infamous bi-weekly, college essay-length, new-release lists.\n\nThis doc has interviews with the aQ owners dating back to 1970, other record store owners from around the world, musicians, label heads, music journalists, and INTENSE music collectors. Interviewees include Matt Groening (The Simpsons), Wayne Coyne (Flaming Lips), Bruce Ackley, John Darnielle (The Mountain Goats), Ty Segall, and Liz Harris (Grouper).\n\nAquarius Records influenced and enriched countless peoples’ musical tastes with their curated selections - but this film also shows the realities of an indie record store trying to survive in an increasingly difficult market of brick-and-mortar music shops, especially in the ever-changing and price-gouging Mission District of SF. Six years in the making, the film has a very personal angle, with lots of behind-the-scenes footage (and drama) that shows both the joy and excruciating stress that comes with running — and closing — a store like this.\n\nUpcoming screenings:\n\nOct 4th 6 pm Los Angeles City College w Howie Klein\n\nOct 6th Tucson Film and Music Festival\n\nNovember 1st, 7pm Nitehawk Cinema, Williamsburg Brooklyn\n\nFilm screening, followed by a moderated Q+A, with:\n\nKenneth Thomas\n\nBrian Turner (The Brian Turner Show, WFMU)\n\nJeremy DeVine (Founder / President of Temporary Residence Records)\n\nJon Fine (Bitch Magnet, Author of Your Band Sucks: What I Saw at Indie Rock’s Failed Revolution (but Can No Longer Hear))\n\nEmil Amos (Grails, Om, Holy Sons)\n\nModerated by Anna Lopez (Temporary Residence Records, Union Pool)\n\nNov 4th & 5th Doc Utah St. George, Utah\n\nKenneth Thomas is a teacher and filmmaker from Arcata, California.

Featuring over a dozen multi-camera live concert shoots and 20 interviews about independent heavy metal music culture, the film has screened in over two dozen film and music festivals on every continent (except Antarctica) and is currently being independently distributed. This documentary led to him directing two music videos for bands in the film, one of which aired on MTV’s Headbanger’s Ball.\n\nKenneth currently teaches Live TV Production and Audio Production at Los Angeles City College, with occasional freelance stints as a key camera operator for live multi-camera streams of LA Philharmonic concerts, and directing live multi-camera streams of heavy metal concerts in Boston and Los Angeles.\n\nArtist Windy Chien is best known for her 2016 work, The Year of Knots, in which she learned a new knot every day for a year.

We look at all the forms of fungi, the roles they play in recycling matter, communicating with the trees, and even their role in human evolution. You may never look at mold the same way again. Our guest for this episode is comedian Jessica Sele.\n\nFantastic Fungi is a consciousness-shifting film about the mycelium network that takes us on an immersive journey through time and scale into the magical earth beneath our feet, an underground network that can heal and save our planet. Through the eyes of renowned scientists and mycologists like Paul Stamets, best-selling authors like Michael Pollan, Eugenia Bone, Andrew Weil and others, we become aware of the beauty, intelligence and solutions that fungi kingdom offers in response to some of our most pressing medical, therapeutic, and environmental challenges.\n\nJessica Sele is a Los Angeles-based comedian whose teeth were cut sharply in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her material ranges from sexuality to substance abuse to living in the end times. Her performances leave audiences to feel that demons have just left their bodies to take the night off. She hosts the West LA comedy night at Giant Robot, as well as the podcast, “Hot Topic: Jessica Sele talks about climate change for some reason.” Jessica has performed on Viceland, is a regular feature at her home club the San Francisco Punch Line, and has performed at fancy comedy festivals, colleges, clubs, and alt shows across the nation.\n\nFollow Jessica on:\n\nTwitter: @jsele\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nWe review the documentary Too Soon: Comedy After 9/11 which you can catch on Vice TV on Sept. 8th, just a few days before the 20th anniversary of the 2001 attacks.\n\nThe documentary features interviews with comedians including David Cross, Gilbert Godfried, Janeane Garofolo, and Marc Maron about the struggle to re-establish humor’s place in the aftermath of the attacks that day. The film explores how stand-up comedians, Broadway performers, late-night hosts, and Saturday Night Live helped audiences laugh even in the darkest of days. Our guest is Julie Seabaugh the director, executive producer, and story editor of Too Soon: Comedy After 9/11.\n\nToo Soon premieres on VICE TV September 8 at 9 p.m. and will be repeating numerous times thereafter. (VICE TV is available via all major satellite and cable providers and the VICE TV app via iOS, Android, Apple TV, Roku, and Chromecast.)\n\nJulie Seabaugh grew up on a farm in rural Missouri and discovered stand-up when Dave Attell performed during her senior year of college. Way back in 2003, she founded and edited the criminally ahead of its time print and online comedy magazine Two Drink Minimum. Now the only full-time freelance comedy journalist in the United States, she’s contributed to The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter, GQ, Variety, The A.V. Club, The Village Voice, The Huffington Post, Spin, Playboy, Vulture, Paste, Time Out New York, Time Out Chicago, and numerous other alt-weeklies.\n\nSeabaugh’s coverage of modern roasting culminated in the 2018 book Ringside at Roast Battle: The First Five Years of L.A.'s Fight Club for Comedians, and her love of Mitch Hedberg led to producing/hosting 2020’s Hope on Top: A Mitch Hedberg Oral History for SiriusXM’s Comedy Central Channel (available to stream via the SiriusXM app). With Emmy-nominated director and editor Nick Scown, she is currently producing the documentary Too Soon: Comedy After 9/11. Participants include David Cross, Janeane Garofalo, Gilbert Gottfried, Lewis Black, Darrell Hammond, Doug Stanhope, and Marc Maron; the film’s 2021 release will mark the twentieth anniversary of the attacks.\n\nAmong her career highlights, simultaneous Bridget Everett Village Voice and Roast Battle L.A.

It’s full of lively adjectives and truly paints a picture of what the Amazing Johnathan looks like, what he’s experiencing and how he got to his current state. I felt like he was sitting next to me, boisterously telling his story.”\n\nFor nearly two decades Seabaugh has covered, judged, and moderated panels at festivals including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Just for Laughs Montreal, SXSW, San Francisco Sketchfest, New York Comedy Festival, Just for Laughs Toronto, Sasquatch, Grand Rapids' Gilda's LaughFest, Montana's Big Sky Comedy Festival, Austin's Moontower, Portland's Bridgetown, the Seattle International Comedy Competition, Riot L.A., Nashville's Wild West Comedy Festival, and Atlanta's Laughing Skull.\n\nFollow Julie on:\n\nTwitter: @julieseabaugh\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nWe are talking about This Is Pop, the music documentary series currently streaming on Netflix. This is Pop uncover’s the real stories behind your favorite pop songs and charts the impact of the festival scene, Auto-Tune, boy bands and more. Our guest is Eric Scwartz who is almost featured prominently — in Episode 2 — simply named Auto-Tune. In this episode the producers examine how Auto-Tune is embraced and mocked, and shifts the pitch of the pop charts and changed the game for artists such as Cher, T-Pain and Kanye West.\n\nOne of the most creative and original comedians working today, Eric has earned the description, “everything there is to love about entertainment” (First Order Historians). GQ India names him one of “5 International Comics You Must Catch.” E! News Daily host Ryan Seacrest said Schwartz is “rocking the web” with “video that’s got everyone Googling” and Forbes.com applauds him for having “a minor industry in pop music parodies.”\n\nA product of America’s melting pot, Eric was raised on the outskirts of Los Angeles in a Jewish and Mexican family during the golden age of hip hop. His entertainment career began when he spent his Bar Mitzvah money on DJ gear and began entertaining at parties and school dances, and eventually became one of the most popular DJs at entertainment-industry events. Not content to only speak with his hands, Eric never hesitated at an opportunity to get on the mic and make the audience laugh.\n\nThese would be the seeds to grow Eric’s style of musical comedy, leading him to television appearances on Showtime, The Tonight Show, Comics Unleashed, BET and his one-hour special, “Surrender to the Blender,” on Hulu. A pioneer of viral video, Eric has racked up over 100 million views on his stand-up clips, music videos and sketches. He has created content for and with with Grammy-winner Jason Mraz, Jo Koy, Tiffany Haddish, Craig Robinson, Anjelah Johnson, Disney, Yahoo, and more.\n\nEric is heard regularly as host and creator of Podcast: The Musical, where he conducts an interview and creates songs based on the conversation. He headlines across the country, in addition to opening for Jo Koy on his Just Kidding World Tour.\n\nFollow Eric on:\n\nTwitter:@ericschwartz\n\nInstagram: @eeeericschwartz\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nGeorge covers a lot of ground with Chris Metzler, Quinn Costello, and Jeff Springer; co-directors of Rodents of Unusual Size. Documentary about the nutria overtaking and destroying Louisiana's swamp land. I also ask Chris and Jeff about their earlier collaborations, Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone and Plagues & Pleasures On the Salton Sea, and their work as Tilapia Film.\n\nWe learn about nutria itch and the right lighting for country music videos, among other things.\n\nHard headed Louisiana fisherman Thomas Gonzales doesn't know what will hit him next. After decades of hurricanes and oil spills he faces a new threat - hordes of monstrous 20 pound swamp rats. Known as “nutria”, these invasive South American rodents breed faster than the roving squads of hunters can control them. And with their orange teeth and voracious appetite they are eating up the coastal wetlands that protects Thomas and his town of Delacroix Island from hurricanes. But the people who have lived here for generations are not the type of folks who will give up without a fight. Thomas and a pack of lively bounty hunters are hellbent on saving Louisiana before it dissolves beneath their feet. It is man vs. rodent. May the best mammal win.\n\nRodents of Unusual Sizeon Kanopy, AppleTV, Amazon Prime.\n\nEveryday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone\n\nPlagues & Pleasures On The Salton Sea\n\nFollow Rodents Of Unusual Size on:\n\nTwitter: @rousdocumentary\n\nInstagram: @rousdocumentary\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nGeorge and Paco sit down with musician and journalist Kevin Seal to recap Alex Winter’s 2020 documentary Zappa. On this episode we have three different Frank Zappa fans ranging from George, who is new to Zappa’s music, to Kevin, who loves Zappa but occasionally needs a break to Paco, who has been a life long Zappa-head. We get into many topics including: would Zappa be a Trumper, our collective love of Ruth Underwood, Steve Vai’s audition, how art should be a threat to the establishment, Gail Zappa, being an archivist, Captain Beefheart, Edgard Varèse and much more!\n\nFrank Zappa – you either love him or hate him. There is no in between. There have been a few Zappa documentaries out in the last few years but this time it would seem that Alex Winter is a fan first and filmmaker second. “Zappa” is a six-years-in-the-making love letter. Alex was given the family’s blessing and access to the prolific musician’s personal vault and he used as much as he could. We are privy to rarely seen and heard music, films, home movies and interviews up to the point of being just a few months before Zappa’s death in 1993.\n\nKevin Seal has been writing and recording unfashionable music since the ’90s. His band Griddle released four studio records, including a concept album about Olympic athletes and cannibalism. He has played and sung on albums by 20 Minute Loop, Michael Zapruder, and more. Since the shelter-at-home began, he has co-hosted a music game show called Lo Fidelity. He grew up in Cincinnati.\n\nFollow Kevin on:\n\nTwitter: @Kevin_seal\n\nInstagram: @Kevin_seal\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nToday we wrap up the docuseries THE VOW on HBO, the story of the whistleblowers who left the cult group NXIVM, started by “the smartest man in the world” Keith Raniere. We are again joined by the very funny comedian Johnny Pemberton, who loves cult-leader stories.\n\nDirected by Jehane Noujaim (Control Room, The Square) and Karim Amer (The Square, The Great Hack), this film relies on insiders revealing their own stories along with hours of archival footage. Get to know players like Frank Parlato, Cathering Oxenberg, the two Tonis, and watch George and Paco strain their empathy.\n\nWe are covering episodes 6 through 9 of the series. It was recently announced there will be a second season. The first 5 episodes focused on Sarah Edmondson and Mark Vicente, high-level leaders who left Raniere’s organization and went to the press with their discoveries. You can hear our take on Part 1 episodes 1-5 with Johnny here.\n\nJohnny Pemberton is a comedian, actor, writer, mildly knowledgeable gardener, reggae enthusiast, and friend to both insects and mammals.\n\nJohnny is the voice of ‘Peanut’ on the Disney XD show “PICKLE AND PEANUT”. He can be seen in the films “21 JUMP STREET” “22 JUMP STREET” “NEIGHBORS 2” “THE WATCH” “ANT MAN” “BAND OF ROBBERS” “THE 4th” “ACTION POINT” “TONE DEAF” and Armando Ianucci’s Oscar nominated film \"IN THE LOOP\". He plays 'Bo' on NBC’s \"Superstore\", 'Max' on season 4 of FXX's \"You're the Worst\", and 'Alangulon' on the FOX series “Son of Zorn”.\n\nJohnny is a nationally touring comedian and host of the vanguard podcast “LIVE to TAPE” on Starburns Audio.

He lives in Los Angeles.\n\n*George recorded a review of the STARZ series, SEDUCED: INSIDE THE NXIVM CULT with our friend Chaki Sklar, over on our Patreon.\n\n**After this episode came out it was announced that Raniere was sentenced to 120 consecutive years in prison.\n\nFollow Johnny on:\n\nTwitter: @johnnypemberton\n\nInstagram: @Johnny_pemberton\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nToday we cover the docuseries THE VOW on HBO, the story of the whistleblowers who left the cult group NXIVM, started by “the smartest man in the world” Keith Raniere.\n\nAfter a decade as a leader in NXIVM, Sarah Edmondson finds herself blindfolded and branded as part of an inner ring of women called DOS. Grooming women and controlling their weight Sarah is blackmailed with \"collateral\" and is desperate to take back her life. Along with Mark Vicente, their spouses, and actress Catherine Oxenberg, the small group of defectors sets about dismantling NXIVM with all the information they share.\n\nDirected by Jehane Noujaim (Control Room, The Square) and Karim Amer (The Square, The Great Hack), this film relies on insiders revealing their own stories along with hours of archival footage.\n\nWe are covering episodes 1 through 5, which are wild, and there will be spoilers in our conversation.\n\nJohnny Pemberton is a comedian, actor, writer, mildly knowledgeable gardener, reggae enthusiast, and friend to both insects and mammals.\n\nJohnny is the voice of ‘Peanut’ on the Disney XD show “PICKLE AND PEANUT”.

Was director Andrew Jarecki irresponsible in how he handled the footage and information he had? Was there a bias towards helping Jesse? Will our guest Curtis Cook and Paco ever see eye-to-eye on this doc? Listen to find out!\n\nThe true crime documentary Capturing The Friedmans was directed by Andrew Jarecki. Released in 2003, this was Jarecki’s first film and was subsequently nominated for an Academy Award. While preparing a documentary about children’s birthday party entertainers, Jarecki learned that professional clown David Friedman, was the son and brother of two men who had been convicted of child sexual abuse in a high-profile 1980s criminal trial.\n\nUsing home videos made by the Friedman family before and during the trial, Jarecki explores the conflicting stories of the accused, the alleged victims and the investigators as this modern day Greek tragedy unfolds on film. There are many documentaries like Capturing The Friedmans but somehow this doc is entirely unforgettable.\n\nOur guest Curtis Cook is a writer and standup comedian living in Los Angeles. He’s puked after a keg stand on a show called Flophouse, traveled through an Ebola checkpoint for a segment on Vice News, and awkwardly interacting with Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein during a sketch on Portlandia.\n\nMost recently, Curtis’ standup has appeared on Comedy Central, where he also wrote for the reboot of Crank Yankers and was a writer/correspondent for the WGA Award nominated The Jim Jefferies Show.\n\n*Brendan Lynch's \"clown joke\" is not really a clown joke\n\n*Curtis' shutdown talk show The End Is Night\n\nFollow Curtis Cook on:\n\nTwitter: @curtis_cook\n\nInstagram: @curtsicookcomedy\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nPaco and George are pleased to have on today’s guest Tylor Norwood the director of Robin’s Wish. This documentary centers around the final years of Robin Williams and the confusion around why this comedy icon killed himself in 2014.\n\nAfter his death, the media narrative skewed the facts surrounding why Williams died. It wasn’t until a coroner’s report that the complexity of his situation was better understood: he had a severe case of Lewy Body Syndrome.\n\nWilliams’ widow, Susan Schneider Williams, has become a championing voice for the little-known form of dementia with Lewy Bodies. Showing the frailty of a suffering genius in his last months, Robins Wish is the first time the public is seeing this side of Williams’ life.\n\nThis story is lovingly crafted by director Tylor Norwood, who has been a guest on Sup Doc for his previous documentary, The United States of Detroit. Tylor was approached by Susan to tell this story, and his team tracked down friends and neighbors while laying out the details of a fairly obscure disease that is very difficult to diagnose.\n\nRobin’s Wish comes out on Video on Demand (VOD) everywhere on September 1st.\n\nFollow Tylor on:\n\nTwitter: @tylornorwood\n\nInstagram: @tylornorwood\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nToday Paco and George are joined by Dakin Hardwick to recap the new Showtime documentary The Go Go’s. Notably the first all-femme band to write their own songs, play their own instruments, and snag a #1 US album.\n\nDirected by Allison Ellwood, this straightforward music documentary looks at the LA group's rise, reign and breakup, along with youthful ambition, firings, drugs, rehab, money squabbles, breakup, and inevitable reunions.\n\nDakin Hardwick is the one of the founders of Spinning Platters, a website started by a small group of Bay Area based music fans. He was not a writer before starting this blog, and honed my craft in the public eye. The blog is still alive and well after a decade on the internet, even managing to continue to put out content during the COVID crisis. In addition to managing the blog, Dakin has managed to work in music his entire adult life, starting out as a clerk at Wherehouse Music, interning for both Universal Music Distribution and Six Degrees records, and then working at Ticketfly throughout the entire lifespan of the company, then eventually landing at Eventbrite, working on their Music venue product up until the COVID pandemic wiped out the industry, causing the company to let go a large percentage of it’s staff. Dakin, along with fellow Spinning Platters founder Gordon Elgart, occasionally hosts music trivia in San Francisco.\n\nDakin currently lives in Oakland, CA, and is hunting for a full time day job while raising his 1-year old daughter, making sure she understands the importance of listening to music that will alienate her from her peers.\n\nDakin's new podcast How Did I Get Here?\n\nFollow Dakin on:\n\nTwitter: @vagueofthrones\n\nInstagram: @friedoxygen\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nWe look at the 2016 documentary A Genuine Forger (Un Vrai Faussaire) directed by Jean-Luc Leon. Available on Amazon Prime. Our guest is comedian and podcaster Scott Simpson.\n\nThis doc profiles Guy Ribes, one of the world's most notorious art forgers. For over three decades Ribes scored major deals selling works by Picasso, Matisse, and other legends, with a twist: He painted the works himself. Fake heirs, ruthless dealers, and more - it's all here in this documentary.\n\nWe also talk about the current state of comedy, Paco being conned when he first moved to San Francisco, and how we want our con-men to be part Robin Hood. As our guest stated “I love art, fakes, and con men. Great forgers are all three”.\n\nScott Simpson is a comedian based in San Francisco, but his career started in the corporate world. He helped create and run the Apple iTunes podcast store and later did the same with iBooks. Now,, he's a full time comedian and performer. His show \"You Look Nice Today\" received the Podcast Award for Best Comedy Podcast. He produces the most popular independent standup show in San Francisco, Cheaper Than Therapy, which -until recent events intervened- entertained over 500 comedy fans per week.

Foundational to modern American documentary, this is a biting, vital, and angry film that is sadly still relevant today.\n\nMichael Moore demands answers when General Motors suddenly closes the doors of all its auto plants in the Flint, Michigan, the city where he grew up. With over 30,000 people out of work, Flint is economically devastated, and Moore aims to track down GM CEO Roger Smith to make him answer for his actions. While on the search, Moore also chronicles the emotional effect the closings have had on his family and friends, while violent crimes begin to skyrocket in Flint. As Moore pokes around what has been described by one magazine as \"the worst place to live in America\", he finds out how the local populace is coping with GM's betrayal of the American Dream. Among those visited are a family who is evicted just before Christmas, and an enterprising middle-aged woman who set up a thriving business slaughtering and skinning rabbits. Never feigning objectivity, Moore contrasts the impact of the shutdown on the average Joes and Janes with the diffident reaction of Flint's power elite. The latter's patronizing attitude towards the unemployed multitudes is succinctly captured in the scenes in which visiting celebrities Robert Schuller, Anita Bryant, Bobby Vinton and Pat Boone exhort the citizenry to grin and bear it. Even more out of synch is \"Miss Michigan\" Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, who in her morale-boosting speech to the disenfranchised GM employees begs them to pull for her in the upcoming Miss America pageant! The film's throughline is Moore's futile effort to locate GM chairman Roger Smith, so that he can show Moore first-hand the utter devastation of Flint. Roger & Me is very funny, but it is the gallows humor of soldiers about to embark on a suicide mission.\n\nIn 1992, Michael Moore more or less updated Roger &amp; Me with his half-hour short subject Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint.\n\nWe also learn about Paco's time working third shift in a GM plant, why no one in San Francisco works, being a living statue, '80s fashions, woke branding, and debate whether soda is food.\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nTo conclude our Munchie May series on food documentaries we watched FAT: A Documentary by Peter Curtis Pardini (2019).\n\nTrainer-to-the-stars Vinnie Tortorich exposes the history behind widespread myths regarding healthy eating, fat, and weight loss. Is the American Obesity epidemic a product of culture, government intervention, corporate greed, or lack of will?\n\nAnd helping us pick through the layers is our medical and comedic guest, Dr. Priyanka Wali, who schools George and Paco on the science behind the doc.\n\nPriyanka Wali is a board-certified Internal Medicine and Obesity Medicine physician who graduated from the University of Southern California cum laude as an undergraduate in Los Angeles and continued her training there for medical school. She completed her residency in Internal Medicine at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco She is also a nationally recognized expert on the ketogenic diet and has lectured about the impact of insulin resistance and sexual dysfunction at conferences across the United States. In addition to helping patients as a practicing physician, Dr. Wali truly believes that laughter is the best medicine and likes to cover her bases as a touring stand up comedian. She was named by Refinery29 as \"50 Female Stand-Up Comedians You Need To Know\" and before Covid-19 she performed routinely all throughout the United States and abroad, including corporate gigs, casinos and comedy clubs.

Filmmaker Laura Gabbert joins the show to talk about the film and the legacy of the late Jonathan Gold. Jonathan Gold was the Pulitzer Prize winning food critic who came up through The LA Weekly, music journalism, and being a cellist in noise bands. City of Gold chronicles his career, life as a family man, and his love for the diverse cultures and flavors of Los Angeles.\n\nDocumentary director Laura Gabbert’s critically acclaimed films deploy full measures of humor and drama to unflinchingly put a human face on a range of social and cultural issues. NO IMPACT MAN (Sundance ’09), which the LA Times called “terrifically entertaining, compelling and extremely funny,” played theatrically in over 30 cities. Her previous film SUNSET STORY (PBS) won prizes at Tribeca and LAFF. About it, the New York Times wrote, “Sunset Story may break your heart, but it will also make your day.” Gabbert directed the feature film CITY OF GOLD (Sundance 2015) about Pulitzer Prize winning food writer Jonathan Gold. The film played theatrically in over 50 markets. About it, the New York Times wrote “the film does as much to demystify and yet romanticize Los Angeles as any Chandler novel.” Vogue Magazine included CITY OF GOLD in their list of the “the 60 best documentaries of all time.” In 2017 Gabbert was a director on the Netflix show UGLY DELICIOUS and directed the Field of Vision short film MONUMENT | MONUMENTO about a unique spot on the US-Mexico border. Most recently, she directed the feature documentary OTTOLENGHI AND THE CAKES OF VERSAILLES about a collaboration between chef Yotam Ottolenghi and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She is currently co-directing the seven-part non-fiction series THE POWER OF FILM based on the lectures of legendary film scholar Howard Suber. Most recently, Gabbert is working on a Covid-19 food supply chain documentary, collaborating with author/editor, Ruth Reichl.\n\nThis episode we shout out our friends at Chelsea Got Cakes!\n\nFollow Laura on:\n\nTwitter: @lauragabbert1\n\nInstagram: @lauragabbertfilms\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nMay 2020 is the five-year anniversary of Sup Doc.\n\nTo celebrate we’re talking food documentaries all month long for Munchie May, our brand new theme series.\n\nWe talk to comedian Derek Sheen about his pick, NOMA: MY PERFECT STORM (Pierre Deschamps 2015).\n\nFor three years running, Noma in Copenhagen was voted the \"Best restaurant in the world.\" This puts an immense amount of pressure on René Redzepi, the driven chef who has up-ended the food world and put Nordic cuisine on the map. He has an attitude and brilliance that is undeniable but he starts questioning his own motivations and ideas about success. Along the way we meet the foragers, suppliers, staff, and critics who all have their lives changed by Noma.\n\nOur guest Derek Sheen is a cuddly mess of insecurities and a gifted, one-of-a-kind storyteller. His dark humor has made Derek a cult favorite of comedy nerds everywhere. He has amassed a loyal fan base touring with comedy legends Brian Posehn, Patton Oswalt, and Janeane Garofalo. Derek has released four critically acclaimed albums on Stand Up! Records, with Grammy Winning producer Dan Schlissel. The most recent, \"Macho Caballero\", just came out on April 24th and is on Streaming Services everywhere.\n\nOur sponsor for this week's show is Berkeley-based Squabisch, artisanal pretzel business that does curbside-pickups (and some delivery within the East Bay).

The store closed in 2016 and this documentary captures the last month and a half of the store’s activity, with former employees, fans, and musicians all showing up to pay their respects. There are interviews and guest appearances from Martin Gore of Depeche Mode, Jason Schwartzmann, Regina Spektor, William Basinski, Tunde Adebimpe, Cornelius, and Benicio Del Toro. More than the famous talking heads, this feels like a vital reminder of the before-times, a celebration of community.\n\nThe film's release plans had to be altered with the COVID19 quarantine, so instead Other Music has a special online release for a limited time starting April 17th. A \"Virtual Cinema release\" through Factory25, part of the profitsare being channeled to record stores, book stores, movie theaters, and other retailers shuttered due the the pandemic. Each partner has a custom URL to rent through; find a store you want to support here!\n\nPuloma Basu was born in Buffalo, NY and raised in Kolkata, India. She began her career in film working on Mira Nair's The Namesake and has since worked on numerous TV shows including Bored To Death and Flight Of The Conchords and feature films such as St. Vincent and The Meyerowitz Stories. She and her husband Rob Hatch-Miller directed and produced season one of the standup comedy TV series Night Train With Wyatt Cenac for NBCUniversal's digital platform Seeso. Together they've also directed music videos for artists including Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Aimee Mann. This is Puloma's first feature film as a director.\n\nWhile studying Film & TV at NYU's Tisch School Of The Arts, Rob Hatch-Miller began a life-changing job as a staff member at Other Music. Rob has worked on numerous documentary features including Laura Poitras' The Oath and Eugene Jarecki's The House I LiveIn. He directed and produced the soul music documentary feature Syl Johnson: Any Way The Wind Blows, which won the Best Documentary Jury Prize at the 2016 Sidewalk Film Festival and the Best Documentary Audience Award at the 2015 Indie Memphis Film Festival. Rob has also produced numerous music videos, an episode of Adult Swim's Infomercials TV series and dozens of web comedy shorts for Funny Or Die including Hillary Clinton: Between Two Ferns With Zach Galifianakas.\n\nFollow Other Music on:\n\nTwitter: @OtherMusicDoc\n\nInstagram: @othermusicdoc\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nYou can support Sup Doc on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nOn Ep 136 host Paco Romane sits down with comedian Brooke Heinichen to recap and discuss the Netflix documentary Miss Americana. Brooke guides Paco thru the life and albums (seriously, Brooke made a album to album synopsis) of Taylor Swift. They also talked about being a woman in entertainment, technology, ageism, Brooke’s pet peeve and you get to hear Paco do a horrible British accent!\n\nWatching Miss Americana you get the feeling that the entire documentary wants you to see Taylor Swift as we first see her – sitting relaxed and drinking coffee, looking through her journal and talking about her past relationships and what kind of person she sees herself being in the future. These quiet solo moments are a world removed from her giant, arena shows that are packed with adoring fans. In one telling moment we see Taylor look from behind a curtain as if she is still surprised that fans come see her shows. This documentary can feel like its made more for long time fans of Taylor’s. If you watch Miss Americana as someone that doesn’t yet know much about her you’ll leave with a feeling that there is much more to talk about what makes Taylor Swift...Taylor Swift.\n\nHere is Taylor Swift's full Billboard 2019 Woman Of The Decade speech.\n\nListen to Brooke's handpicked Taylor Swift Spotify Playlist.\n\nAaaaaaaaand Brooke's Album to Album Taylor Swift info sheet!\n\nFollow Brooke Heinichen on:\n\nTwitter: @brookeheinichen\n\nInstagram: @brookeheinichen\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nOn Ep 134 Hosts Paco Romane and George Chen recapped the twisty and terrifying Netflix documentary Don’t F**K With Cats (like we don't know what \"F**k\" means) with the hilarious and insightful Tara Jepsen. We had no idea that there was such a thing as “Rule Zero” of the Internet. It makes sense, especially because cute cat videos have been the best thing the Internet has brought us. The rule says, “Don’t fuck with cats, or we’ll find you.”\n\nTRIGGERS - a guideline to triggering animal abuse scene timecodes (in episode one) were kindly shared with us by @hilldawg\n\nIf you've never heard of Luka Magnotta, consider yourself lucky. Someone is anonymously torturing and killing kittens and posting videos online. A home-schooled Canadian sociopath creates a bunch of sock puppet accounts about how cool he is with poorly photoshopped images and plants rumors about dating a serial killer. The heroes of the piece are facebook sleuths who crowdsource clues, tearing apart aspects of the video to try and locate and identify the perpetrator. Along the way, the hunters become the hunted, online vanity and murderous impulses clash, and we have to ask whether these tragic events could have been averted.\n\nTara Jepsen is a writer and comic living in Los Angeles. Her novel \"Like a Dog\" was published by City Lights in 2017. She has made many short films with collaborator Beth Lisick, and they have a new one coming out this year. She and illustrator Miriam Klein-Stahl founded Pave the Way Skateboards, which seeks to elevate queer visibility in skateboarding and whose boards are collected by the Smithsonian.\n\n*Cvlt Nation on Peruvian post-punk\n\n*Gary Spivey Wikipedia\n\nFollow Tara Jepsen on:\n\nTwitter: @captaindingbat\n\nInstagram: @captaindingbat\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nOn this episode of Sup Doc host Paco Romane sits down with comedian and musician Phil Johnson to rcap the 2019 Netflix documentary ReMastered: The Lion's Share.\n\nTo put it bluntly the music business is brutal. From royalties and demanding record labels to artists being sued for copyright infringement, it’s sometimes difficult to remember a time when these things weren’t the norm. The Lion Sleeps Tonight is one of the most recognisable songs in our history, under the original title “Mbube” written and recorded in 1939 by South African singer Solomon Linda. Through a combination of chicanery and misunderstanding this international hit song is a complex tale of artist exploitation, though only its circumstances make it out of the ordinary. The attempts to right this wrong are the subject of The Lion’s Share, the latest episode of Netflix‘s music documentary series, Remastered.\n\nOur guest is comedian and musician Phil Johnson who because of his long hair often gets mistaken for a woman, but only by those not paying attention. That revelation kicks off a battle for self-awareness where comedy and music are the weapons of choice. It’s a battle that has taken Phil to such esteemed festivals as the Edinburgh Fringe and Sundance Film Festivals and the Top 8 Finals of the World Series of Comedy.\n\nFollow Phil Johnson on:\n\nTwitter: @roadsidephil\n\nInstagram: @philjohsoncomedy\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nOn episode 130 hosts Paco and George recap the new Eddie Murphy biopic Dolomite Is My Name about Rudy Ray Moore currently streaming on Netflix. It has been quite awhile since Eddie Murphy has been cast in a R-rated movie with so much swearing as he frequently employs in “Dolemite Is My Name,” and it’s a welcome sight. It’s not just the triumphant return to cussin’ that fans have been craving, it’s also a reminder: Sam Jackson’s favorite word may be maternal-adjacent and twelve letters long, but before he commandeered it, it was owned by Rudy Ray Moore. Murphy plays Moore, the opportunistic hustler who parlayed his ability to change and his tenaciousness into a career as a stand-up comedian whose signature character, Dolemite, made him famous. Rudy Ray Moore credits his neighborhood wino as the genesis for his Dolemite stories and raps. As one person says in the film, a lot of these guys had been in jail and, to pass the time, crafted these tall tales from their own life experiences and stories they heard around the neighborhood.\n\nWe enjoyed the film and would recommend it to any Eddie Murphy or Rudy Ray Moore fans but both Paco and George agree it seems as if this film was released 20 years too late.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nDid you watch Jawline? Liza Mandelup's 2019 Hulu documentary was a Sundance hit, capturing a scene of teenage influencers and influencer kingmakers, and to a lesser extent the girls that pay to interact with them. Without a heavy-handed narration it's all shot in a gauzy dream-like way. Protagonist Austyn Tester is from a small Tennessee town and plays the naive foil to media shark Michael Weist. It all makes one wonder who this film is targeted at, and does it warrant the attention it got? Will you do what it takes to become a living meme, including drop out of high school? And is this still better than the Travis Scott documentary?\n\nGeorge's guests are a young couple who watched this film together, possibly an awkward date night.\n\nElijah Katz is a Los Angeles born and bred comedian who runs “Margaret: a mid-city comedy show” every other Wednesday at a vintage shop.

The Amazing Johnathan described himself as the “Freddy Krueger of Comedy,” and used that manic energy to regularly catapult his way onto Late Night With David Letterman and Comic Strip Live. His gory, smart and silly deconstructions of magic and coked-up circus geek tricks eventually earned him Las Vegas headlining gigs for a decade or longer. Then, in 2014, he announced that he’d been diagnosed with a serious heart condition, saying doctors had given him only a year to live. The Amazing Johnathan retired, seemingly destined to fade into the annals of cult comedy and the memories of ’80s kids who watched too much cable. But then came the kicker: Johnathan kept on living. And after a while, he grew bored and anxious to return, even if it meant dying on stage. Literally. And this is where both documentaries pick up the story. And the story of the two competing documentaries become a story within the story.\n\nAndy Deemer has been a screenwriter, magazine editor, product manager, and now Macaulay Culkin’s personal Magician.

This documentary tells the history of the Westside Barbell Powerlifting Club and its founder Louie Simmons. The doc is narrated by Ron Perlman and focuses on Louie’s youth, his discovery of the Culver City Westside Barbell club, his journey into powerlifting and his accomplishments. Plus a lot of powerlifting drama. If you follow the sport you’ll be sure to recognize many of the club’s famous names and accomplishments. The doc follows Westside from its origins to its its domination through the 90s and early 2000s and to relative obscurity in the era of raw powerlifting.\n\nOur guest is comedian Jesse Hett. Jesse is a stand-up comedian based in Oakland, California. He has appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal doing comedy while wearing a virtual reality helmet. That sounds made up but it's true, you can look it up. He has performed in SF Sketchfest and the Savage Henry Comedy Festival; Rooster T. Feathers, the San Jose Improv, and the San Francisco and Sacramento Punch Lines. His style has been described as \"observational absurdism\" and one newspaper reviewer wrote that he \"says very smart things in a very dumb way\" which is kind of mean but print media is dying so Jesse Hett will have the last laugh.\n\nFollow Jesse on:\n\nTwitter:@JesseTheHett\n\nInstagram: @JesseTheHett\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nPaco talks with Bay Area comedian and baseball coach Ben Kolina about the 2018 Netflix documentary Screwball. Screwball Recounts the high-profile doping scandal that rocked Major League Baseball. This entertaining doc takes us into the surreal Miami underworld that provided performance-enhancing drugs to Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez and other star players. They say South Florida is a sunny place for shady people and this is certainly true of steroid peddler Anthony Bosch. While Bosch's medical credentials may be lacking, his storytelling skills are first rate. The documentary also raises serious questions about doping and ethics in sports.\n\nThe incredible nuttiness of “Screwball” could someday be adapted into an award-winning feature film a la “I, Tonya.” It has that same kind of out-there, Coen-esque feel in which people’s greed and stupidity lead to national news. There are plenty of dumb people out there, but only a select few that end up playing on as big a scene as Tony Bosch and Porter Fischer, who arguably changed the trajectory of one of the most popular sports in the world.\n\nBen had his first experience getting laughs at the expense of visiting outfielders in Bleacher seats of the Oakland Coliseum.

We hope you enjoy it and let us know what Bi-OP-Pics you want us to cover.\n\nOn the premiere episode we look at Rocketman (Dexter Fletcher, 2019)about the life and music of Elton John. Yes THAT Elton John. Both George and Paco agree that Rocketman is a formulaic, paint-by-numbers biopic. One glaring problem was that the musical numbers are not in order of when the songs were released. Rocketman begins oddly at a moment of a huge crossroad in Elton's career, then backtracks to show us how he ended up there—a narrative device that already was a cliché when “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” parodied it back in 2007. Taron Egerton does an admirable job with what he's given.\n\nPaco and George also talk about how Rocketman is seemingly prepackaged for the Broadway stage, packed with Elton John hits you’ve known and maybe loved for decades. And of course what self-respecting biopic would not have plenty of montages: the obligatory scenes of Elton hits rising up the charts and racking up, all the gold records and the sex and drugs that go along with the rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nCorrection: Not Bernie Maupin nor Armistead Maupin but Bennie Maupin and he's not a piano player but a reed player.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nPaco can't quite get into Bob Dylan although our guest has tried to turn him on to the canon. Comedian Tony Camin joins the Sup Doc gang to provide a Dylan fan's insight into the obtuse Netflix concoction Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese (2019).\n\nNetflix describes it as “part concert film, part fever dream” and an “alchemic mix of fact and fantasy.”\n\n“Rolling Thunder Revue” is an engaging but disorganized and long-winded account of the time in 1975 that Bob Dylan convened a vagabond caravan of musicians, poets, reporters, photographers, money men, and hangers-on to tour the United States in the lead-up to the country’s Bicentennial celebration. The tour was a bust financially and in terms of cultural impact. Nevertheless, the Rolling Thunder Revue rejuvenated Dylan as a musician, in the manner of Elvis Presley’s 1968 “comeback” special. And it generated enormous amounts of tour footage, some of which is reproduced here, within a highly conceptual framework, by Scorsese.\n\nOur guest Tony Camin has appeared on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Real Time with Bill Maher, and lots of others that have been cancelled. He’s has performed at The Just For Laughs festival in Montreal as well as The HBO US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, as well as the Melbourne Comedy festival in Australia. Tony has written for programs on NBC, VH1, and Comedy Central. In addition to being co-creator/ performer of “The Marijuana-Logues”, he can also be seen as a correspondent for “The Media Project”, on IFC, and was a recent contestant on NBC’s Last Comic Standing.\n\nFollow Tony:\n\nTwitter: @tonycamin\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nOur Mayhem True Crime series continues with the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr.\n\nIn July 2016, Gypsy Rose Blanchard was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in the brutal stabbing death of her mother, Dee Dee. Gypsy, then 24, was arguably the biggest victim of all, held hostage by her mother since she was a young child – a casualty of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Gypsy’s plan to kill Dee Dee was a last-ditch attempt to flee this abuse and her partner-in-crime is doing life.\n\nNot only is there this documentary but America is abuzz about the hit Hulu series based on this case, The Act starring Patricia Arquette as Dee Dee and Joey King as Gypsy.\n\nAlly Johnson is a radio host, voice actor and comedy writer based in Los Angeles.

It also marks four years since we began Sup Doc back in good ol' 2015.\n\nToday's documentary is The Legend of Cocaine Island (Theo Love 2019). A lazy wish-fullfilment DIY rags-to-riches story that is more rags than riches. Of course it goes down in the state that gave us every sharable bonkers story that starts with “A Florida Man.” Cocaine Island centers around Robert Hyden who was on top of the world as a Florida businessman before the recession hit. He went from living in a mansion to a double wide no bigger than what used to be his garage. As he was looking at the bad hand life had dealt him, he heard a great urban legend repeated. There was a guy walking the beach in Puerto Rico one day and he saw a bag floating in the shallow water. He brought it in to shore and found millions of dollars in cocaine. Basically, there was a buried treasure of millions of dollars in drugs just waiting for someone to find it. And that’s what he set out to do.\n\nComedian Chris Riggins has taken the art of stand up comedy and stands out amongst a sea of other talented artists. From producing unique shows such as the Outdoor Comedy Club, opening for Dave Chappelle his first time on stage, to featuring and headlining at major clubs and colleges throughout the United States, the sky is truly the limit for Chris. While a unique take on growing up in the Bay Area and finding humor in the struggle are the centerpiece of Chris’ act, he is relatable to people from all walks of life.\n\nIf you haven’t seen The Legend of Cocaine Island there are some spoilers in this episode.\n\nFollow Chris on:\n\nTwitter: @ChrisRigginsHaa\n\nInstagram: @ChrisRigginsComedy\n\nFollow Sup Doc on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nPaco is joined by Bay Area comedian Hayley Beacon to recap the bizarro '70s kidnapping documentary Abducted In Plain Sight.\n\n*Trigger Warnings and Spoiler Alerts abound.*\n\nJan Broberg said she was “groomed” by her kidnapper to believe UFOs and extra-terrestrial life were a plausible possibility.\n\nIf truth is stranger than fiction it doesn’t get stranger than this hit true crime documentary Abducted In Plain Sight (originally released in 2017 as Forever B). On October 17, 1974, 12 year old Jan Broberg was kidnapped by her next-door neighbor and parents’ best friend B. Never trust someone that goes by a letter. Abducted In Plain Sight is a true story of the Brobergs; an Idaho family who fell under the spell of a sociopathic neighbor with his eyes set on their twelve-year-old daughter. Abducted has everything: desire, deceit, faith and forgiveness. Plus handjobs, aliens and the CIA.\n\nTheir troubling admissions reveal epic failures and untold personal dramas that point to the biggest tragedy of all — that these crimes could have been prevented.\n\nOur guest is comedian Hayley Beacon. Hayley is a Bay Area native and has been a selected performer across the country at Pittsburg Comedy Festival, Blue Whale, Motor City Comedy Fest, SF Sketchfest and has been a guest on the Las Cultaristas podcast. If you’re into defensive millennial material, cliche sassiness and pop-sociology references, you’ll love her.

KARP has a small but mighty cult following, especially for the ‘90s Pacific Northwest, the scene that Badgley grew up in.\n\nThe Slits were a wild band of young women in the first wave of UK punk. ‘\n\nthey broke up in the early 80s, then reformed with 2 principal members in the oughts and kept touring until the death of singer Ari Up in 2010\n\nBadgley is wrapping up his documentary about Don Letts, the crucial link between London’s punk and reggae subcultures who is an archivist and filmmaker in his own right (and former manager of The Slits). I was able to catch an in-progress cut of the Letts film, Rebel Dread, at the Echo Park Film Center - so there’s some talk about that version which will be pretty different by the time of an official release.\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nRestrepo is a 2010 American documentary film about the Afghanistan war, directed by American journalist Sebastian Junger and British photojournalist Tim Hetherington.\n\nThe film explores the year that Junger and Hetherington spent in Afghanistan on assignment for Vanity Fair. The 2nd Platoon is depicted defending the outpost (OP) named after a platoon medic who was killed earlier in the campaign, PFC Juan Sebastián Restrepo, a Colombian-born naturalized U.S. citizen.\n\nJeff Dean is a San Francisco-based comedian, writer, and actor originally from Reno, Nevada. Over the years, he’s become a staple in the Bay Area Stand Up comedy scene. He currently runs two weekly comedy showcases, The Fun Stuff at The Laundry in San Francisco, and Double Standard Comedy Night at Double Standard Brewery in Oakland.\n\nIf documentaries are meant to change hearts and minds, that’s exactly what Sebastian Junger’s “Restrepo” has done for Jeff. Since seeing this doc, Jeff has grown a deep empathy for our nation’s veterans, and decided to produce benefit comedy shows raising money for non-profits benefiting veterans experiencing homelessness. This partnership lead a much bigger life change, as he switched careers, quitting sales to join a non-profit providing direct service to people experiencing homelessness. Jeff’s life has changed quite a bit, and while there were many factors that lead to these decisions, none of them would have been made without the decision to watch “Restrepo” along with the follow up documentary “Korengal”.\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nThis is a bonus Sup Doc mini-episode brought to you by our friends at THE ORGANIST podcast, an arts and culture show produced by McSweeney's and KCRW.

Decline 3 chronicles the lives of L.A.’s homeless gutter punks, and she met SIN during its filming. He's been struggling with mental illness and voices in his head, which are described in this segment.\n\nTHE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION box set is available on Shout Factory.\n\nThis segment was recorded by David Weinberg and produced by Myke Dodge Weiskopf, Jenny Ament, Ross Simonini, and Andrew Leland for the Organist.

Currently he doesn't have an agent, manager, or a million Twitter followers, but club bookers still take a chance on him. Kaseem has appeared on Viceland, NBC SeeSo, KQED, and Rooftop Comedy, and was named one of SF Weekly's Comics To Watch.\n\nLauren J is a Los Angeles based writer, podcast-crasher & dog mom.

The police found one suspect, but could this one man account for the bogeyman legend of Cropsey? Was he working alone, or was he the wrong man altogether? Cropsey is like a horror movie come to terrifying life.\n\nAndy Sell is a comedian, actor, and writer who has been obsessed with horror movies since he started watching them at an arguably inappropriate age. Born in Iowa, Andy graduated film school from a college in New Mexico that no longer exists and currently resides in the Los Angeles area where he co-produces the monthly storytelling show, We Still Like You. Andy has performed at comedy shows and festivals across the country. He has no representation but still managed to co-write and co-star in a Comedy Central snapchat series called Nostalgia-rama in 2016, and act in a principle role in the neo-noir feature film, Los Angeles Overnight (now available on Amazon). Andy worked for Ray Bradbury's Pandemonium Theatre Company, has officiated four weddings, mains Junkrat on Overwatch (but will fill as healer), loves cats, and is candid about mental health onstage. He is followed on Twitter by some pretty cool well-known people despite not being verified, but doesn't want to drop names (but like, you would totally be jealous). If you want to hear Andy (and producer and co-host Adam Tod Brown) talk about horror movie history, check out the podcast Ghoul School when it hits the Unpops network and the usual podcast places. Did the part about not having representation come off as bitter or just desperate? What about the Twitter thing, that was too much, right? Either way, he wants an agent.

We recap this follow-up to the Paradise Lost series with horror filmmaker Gavin Michael Booth. Gavin is shooting a new feature film \"Last Call\" this summer, and make sure to check out his newly released music videos for artist SYML titled \"Body\" and \"The War\"!\n\nCanadian born director Gavin Michael Booth’s film, music video and commercial work has been featured around the globe in theatres, on television and online. His work includes collaborations with Third Eye Blind, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures, Blumhouse, Royal Bank of Canada and more. Currently LA-based, Gavin is available for projects in the U.S. & Canada.\n\nAs with the Paradise Lost film and its two sequels, West of Memphis follows the events of the West Memphis Three, a case in which three teenagers (Jessie Misskelley, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin) were arrested for the murders of three 8-year old children.\n\nThe West Memphis Three were subsequently convicted of murder and remained in prison for more than 18 years. West of Memphis focuses on Terry Hobbs, stepfather of Stevie Branch, one of the victims of the 1993 crime, as a potential suspect due to physical evidence linking him to the crime, a history of violent behavior and his lack of an alibi for the time the murders were committed, as well as damaging statements made by his ex-wife, former neighbors, and most recently his own nephew, who claims Hobbs confessed to him. The film reveals that inexplicably Terry Hobbs was not interviewed by police at the time of the murders.\n\n*If you love listening to Sup Doc please consider being a patron by supporting us thru our Patreon page!\n\n*We have a live screening and panel for Freaks and Geeks: The Documentary at SF DocFest!

If not, what are you waiting for?\n\nWhen the Rajneesh movement and their leader the Bhagwan came to rural Oregon in the 1980s was it just a clash of cultures (worldly orange-clad hippies vs. conservative townspeople) or a mafia-style hostile takeover? The directors Maclain and Chapman Way have crafted a twisting drama with unearthed videotape of the Rajneeshpuram saga, plus new interviews with many key players. While most of you reading this may not know the name Bhagwan Rajneesh, those who were around to watch the news in the early 1980s can tell you that he was a massive story around the country. That’s because Rajneesh and his followers spent $125 million back in 1981 to build Rajneeshpuram in in the Oregon desert, a 64,000-acre “utopia,” complete with a hospital, schools, restaurants, a shopping mall, and their own airport. What happened there and in the surrounding area is so far-fetched that you won’t believe it’s all true.\n\nOne of the great things about the doc is the way the filmmakers weave footage from the actual events in alongside new interviews with the people involved.\n\nOur guest is journalist-podcaster/multi-hyphenate Los Angeles native, Richard Parks III. Richard has written for Lucky Peach, the New York Times, and McSweeney's. He has created a radio drama with Wayne Coyne, the short doc Music Man Murray, a documentary about Biosphere2, and contributed to Snap Judgement and KCRW’s Lost Notes.\n\nFollow Richard on:\n\nTwitter: @reechardparks\n\nInstagram: @reechardparks\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nHost Paco Romane sat down with comedian, writer and cook Drew Platt. Not only is Drew a great comedian, he is equally adept in the kitchen. Drew made some delicious Wiener schnitzel. We ate and drank some tasty brews and watched American Movie. One of the greatest docs ever made and one of Paco's favorites. Paco and Drew also discuss comedy, small towns, the entertainment biz and so much more!\n\nAmerican Movie is a very funny, sometimes sad documentary directed by Chris Smith about Mark Borchardt's life, his friends, his family, his films and his dreams. Mark's life is a daily cliffhanger involving poverty, desperation, discouragement and diehard ambition. He's behind on his child support payments, he drinks too much, he can't even convince his ancient Uncle Bill that he has a future as a moviemaker. He plunders the bank account of his Uncle Bill for funds to continue, he uses his friends and hapless local amateur actors as his cast, he enlists his mother as his cinematographer, and his composer and best friend is a guy named Mike Schank who, after one drug trip too many, seems like the twin of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob. American Movie is a classic documentary!\n\n*We are co-presenting a special Oakland screening of The United States Of Detroiton Tuesday April 17th at the New Parkway in Oakland, with director Tyler Norwood and comedian Karinda Dobbins on panel.

They discuss Russell Simmons' socks, living in Nigeria, The Get Down, Wild Style, Boston's music scene, and much more. Ed's latest EP Flourish just came out on Deathbomb Arc.\n\nWhile Ed Balloon has never shied away from soul bearing with his streamlined and catchy music, with each new release he brings more socially-focused content to the minimal sound his fans already love. In a unique space between club tracks, love songs, and pop anthems, Ed is able to find the core of a sound, shed the rest, and produce such a focused sound that it is at once huge and cosmic and also as intimate as a cuddle. It is the perfect musical forum for contemplating the ways our world’s huge issues fall right in our laps. Ed Balloon is the best friend we all wish we had; able to tell us those hard truths in a way that is a pure act of love.\n\nHip-Hop Evolution features in-depth, personal interviews with the progenitors of DJing, rapping, and production, culminating in what is now taken to be Hip hop music and rap, adding to the existing understanding of hip-hip's earliest decades.

We hit the stage with The Devil and Daniel Johnston with our guest, musician Kip Uhlhorn!\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Johnston is a 2005 documentary film about the noted American musician Daniel Johnston. It chronicles Johnston's life from childhood up to the present, with an emphasis on his experiences with bipolar disorder, and how it manifested itself in demonic self-obsession. The film was directed by Jeff Feuerzeig, edited by Tyler Hubby, and produced by Henry S. Rosenthal.\n\nKip Uhlhorn formed Cloudland Canyon in 2002. The first Cloudland Canyon release, Requiems Der Natur, 2002-2004 was released by Tee Pee in 2006. Cloudland Canyon quickly set about releasing a number of other releases and touring that same year, most notably a single track collaboration 12”/LP entitled Exterminating Angel with Chicago musician Lichens in 2007 on Holy Mountain.\n\nIn 2007, the band was signed to Kranky and released their first proper album Silver Tongued Sisyphus. In 2008, the band released another collaborative 12” with Mythical Beast on Not Not Fun, as well as their second full length, Lie in Light on Kranky. The latter was chosen as one of top 25 albums of the year 2008 by the Magnet magazine. Cloudland Canyon subsequently moved to Holy Mountain, where the band began their own imprint of Holy Mountain (Intercoastal Artists) for 2010’s album Fin Eaves, which has become their best-received work to date, landing on numerous year-end lists.

On Ep 58 Paco, George and producer Will sit down with the Craig Staggs and Steph Swopes (Minnow Mountain) the animation director and producer of the 2016 documentary Tower. Tower is an animated documentary film directed by Keith Maitland about the 1966 shootings at the University of Texas at Austin. August 1, 1966, was the day our innocence was shattered. A sniper rode the elevator to the top floor of the iconic University of Texas Tower and opened fire, holding the campus hostage for 96 minutes in what was a previously unimaginable event. TOWER combines archival footage with rotoscopic animation of the dramatic day, based entirely on first person testimonies from witnesses, heroes and survivors, in a seamless and suspenseful retelling of the unfolding tragedy. The film highlights the fear, confusion, and visceral realities that changed the lives of those present, and the rest of us, forever - a day when the worst in one man brought out the best in so many others. The film is based on a 2006 Texas Monthly article by Pamela Colloff, \"96 Minutes.\" Maitland originated from New Jersey and attended UT Austin. Maitland read the article in 2006 and asked Colloff to have lunch with him. He suggested making a film about the incident during the meeting. Colloff became one of the executive producers of the film. Early on Maitland realized that he and his team likely would not be able to film reenactments on the University campus and so they decided to opt for an animated aesthetic \" to show the geography of the campus\". Footage was mostly shot in Maitland's backyard and then animated by production company Minnow Mountain who was aided by pictures Maitland had shot around campus. Craig Staggs is an animator, illustrator, filmmaker and writer. His illustrations have been featured in publications such as The New York Times and the covers of Simon and Schuster’s Star Trek: Starfleet Academy book series. His iconic work on Richard Linklater’s cult classic A Scanner Darkly lead to a successful freelance animation career before founding Minnow Mountain with the goal of developing original feature films, television and web series. He is a Co-Producer/Director of Animation on Tower and the Creator of Earp. After earning a BFA in Photography from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Steph Swope began a diverse career in the visual arts. A veteran of the independent film industry, Steph rose from art department and photo/video research to producing award winning animation and video. She is a Co-Producer/Producer of Animation on Tower and Executive Producer of Earp. http://www.towerdocumentary.com/ http://igg.me/at/murderlake http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/96-minutes/\n\nFollow us on:\n\nTwitter: @supdocpodcast\n\nInstagram: @supdocpodcast\n\nFacebook: @supdocpodcast\n\nsign up for our mailing list\n\nAnd you can show your support to Sup Doc by donating on Patreon.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nThis episode of Sup Doc is sponsored by GUIDEDOC - http://www.guidedoc.tv/supdoc/ For our 2 year anniversary, we're covering true crime documentaries all throughout our Month Of Mayhem series. Paco and George delve into the iconic Errol Morris documentary The Thin Blue Line (creating the exoneration/investigation genre) with our guest comedian, writer, and FrotCast podcaster Vince Mancini. The Thin Blue Line is the fascinating, controversial true story of the arrest and conviction of Randall Adams for the murder of a Dallas policeman in 1976. Billed as \"the first movie mystery to actually solve a murder,\" the film is credited with overturning the conviction of Randall Dale Adams for the murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood, a crime for which Adams was sentenced to death. With its use of expressionistic reenactments, interview material and music by Philip Glass, it pioneered a new kind of non-fiction filmmaking. Its style has been copied in countless reality-based television programs and feature films. Terrence Rafferty in The New Yorker has called it \"a powerful and thrillingly strange movie. Morris seems to want to bring us to the point at which our apprehension of the real world reaches a pitch of paranoia -- to induce in us the state of mind of a detective whose scrutiny of the evidence has begun to take on the feverish clarity of hallucination.\" It was voted the best film of 1988 in a Washington Post survey of 250 film critics. Premiere magazine described it as one of the most important and influential movies of the '80s. Vince Mancini is a writer, comedian, and podcaster. A graduate of Columbia’s non-fiction MFA program, his work has appeared on FilmDrunk, the UPROXX network, the Portland Mercury, the East Bay Express, and all over his mom’s refrigerator.
