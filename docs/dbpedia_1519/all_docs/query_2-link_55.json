        "text": "To view Lloyd Kaufman’s Official IFTA Bio click here.\n\nâ€œLloydâ€™s body of work has now proven to be a seminal influence on film today. Just look at any film created by the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Takashi Miike, Peter Jackson, Eli Roth, Gasper Moe and James Gunn, to name a few, and you are likely watching a film influenced Class of Nuke â€˜Em High, Tromeo & Juliet, or Citizen Toxie.â€\n\n– Stan Lee – creator of Spider-Man\n\nâ€œHis (Lloyd Kaufman) string of low-budget, lowbrow horror comedies stretching back to the â€™80s has been cited as influence by Peter Jackson, the Farrelly Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, Takashi Miike, and Guillermo Del Toro, just to cite a few prominent examples.â€\n\n– Lou Lumenick, chief critic – New York Post\n\nâ€œThere would be no Tarantinos without the shock-sploitation satires of the iconoclastic Kaufman, which can often give more critical insight about the world than some grand Hollywood epics.â€\n\n– Robert Dassonowsky, Director of Film Studies – University of Colorado\n\nColorado Springs\n\nâ€œAcclaimed directors such as Peter Jackson, Quentin Tarantino, Spainâ€™s Ãlex de la Iglesia and Japanâ€™s Takashi Miike have all sited independent film director Lloyd Kaufman and the infamous film The Toxic Avenger as major influences.\n\nWhether or not he would accept the fame (or blame) for these raunchy, mainstream blockbusters, there can be no doubt that what Kaufman has achieved is enormous. In 30 years, Kaufman, along with Yale friend and partner Michael Herz, has built Troma Studios up from a young company struggling to find its voice in a field crowded with competitors to legendary status as a lone survivor, a bastion of true independence, and the worldâ€™s greatest concentration of camp. Among Troma Entertainmentâ€™s library of over 1,000 movies are the early performances of such stars as Kevin Costner, Billy Bob Thornton, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert DeNiro, Dennis Hopper, Dustin Hoffman, Fergie (Black Eyed Peas) and countless others! As a filmmaker, Lloyd Kaufman has accumulated a remarkable list of credits, as well as a more extraordinary list of debits to loan sharks and pawn shops across New York.â€\n\n– Rupert Bottenberg\n\nâ€œThe impact of Troma can be seen in nearly every independent filmmaker who cut his teeth in the video era, from Peter Jackson and Quentin Tarantino to South Parkâ€™s Trey Parker (whoâ€™s debut, Cannibal! The Musical was a Troma production), and the Troma universe has a devoted worldwide fan base to rival that of any comic book.â€\n\n– The A.V. Club – The Onion\n\nâ€œNobody knows how to make films and not make any money doing it better than Lloyd Kaufman.â€\n\n– Trey Parker – co-creator of South Park\n\nIn the late 1960â€™s, Kaufman was enrolled at Yale University (where he would later present his Make Your Own Damn Movie Master Classes), diligently working on a respectable degree in Chinese Studies. However, Kaufman was destined for other things. As he explains in his hit book “All I Need To Know About Filmmaking I Learned From The Toxic Avenger” (published by Penguin Putnam, and first of his seven books), â€œAt Yale I was placed in a dormitory room with two film fanatics, and I knew everything had irrevocably changed.â€ In fact, Kaufman was infected with a love of movies from which he never recovered.\n\nIn 1971, Kaufman met his future partner Michael Herz at Yale. The Troma Universe was born in 1974 with a series of highly original, raunchy comedies such as “Squeeze Play!,” “Stuck On You!,” “Waitress!,” and other titles ending with an exclamation point. These movies, independent precursors to such later smash hits as National Lampoonâ€™s “Animal House” and “Porkyâ€™s,” did well financially, although Kaufman continued to work on such outside productions as “Rocky” and “Saturday Night Fever.” Kaufmanâ€™s relationship with mainstream Hollywood would not last long. â€œThere were problems,â€ Kaufman said, â€œas I always wanted to do things my own way and my employers insisted I do things the correct way.â€ He continued to build up a list of impressive credits as well as some overpowering debts.\n\nKaufman proved his former employers wrong with his 1984 breakthrough movie, “The Toxic Avenger.” This tale of a health club mop boy named Melvin who is transformed into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength struck a chord with audiences and critics alike, demonstrating that there were a large number of people who were interested in seeing things done Kaufmanâ€™s way. “The Toxic Avenger” led to an animated television series, â€œToxic Crusaders,â€ action figures, different Marvel comic book titles,hot sauce, etc.There were three sequels. The most recent film in the series is “Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV.” Currently, “The Toxic Avenger” is being developed by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman and team as a big budget Hollywood remake. “Toxic Avenger The Musical” is playing in London’s West End, with music by Bon Jovi’s David Bryan.\n\nThe success of The Toxic Avenger was followed by a string of commercial and artistic triumphs in a similar vein, blending fantasy, heavy action, comedy, and eroticism in a style that can only be described as â€œTromaticâ€. These films, including the “Class of Nuke â€˜Em High” trilogy, “Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD,” and “Tromaâ€™s War,” were often ignored or scorned by the intelligentsia of the time but spoke to an entire generation of young people who rejected the pandering, commercial films of the mid-to-late 80â€™s. Some of these Troma fans went on to become filmmakers themselves, including Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Mike Judge, Peter Jackson, and Trey Parker. Thanks to these admirers, Kaufman has been asked to make cameo appearances in films like James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Sharknado 4,” Trey Parkerâ€™s “Orgazmo,” Eli Rothâ€™s “Cabin Fever,” and about 200 other indie movies. His “Return to Nuke’em High Vol 1“and “Tromeo and Juliet” were showcased by The Museum of Modern Art in New York last year.\n\nHere is NSFR theatrical trailer for RETURN TO RETURN TO NUKE’EM HIGH, aka Vol 2:\n\n(Premiered at MUSEUM OF THE MOVING IMAGE) opened, NYC Nov 2017\n\nLLOYD KAUFMAN HAS BEEN MARRIED TO PATRICIA S KAUFMAN for 44 years and has three daughters, Lily Hayes (writer), Lisbeth (CEO KITSPLIT.com), and Charlotte (Director/ DP).\n\nEDUCATION\n\nTRINITY SCHOOL 1964\n\nCum Laude Society\n\nPresident of Student Council\n\nVoted Most Likely to Soil Himself in Public\n\nYALE UNIVERSITY, B.A. 1969\n\nDean’s List and Lightweight Crew\n\nSpent one year in Africa, teaching and boffing in a small village in Chad, received letter of thanks from the U.S. Ambassador to Chad (for teaching only)\n\nElected member of the Yale Elihu Society\n\nLanguages: fluent French; some Chinese; pidgin English\n\nFilm & Television Credits\n\nRETURN TO NUKE â€˜EM HIGH (2013)\n\nFeature Film\n\nProducer/Director\n\nFATHER’S DAY (2011)\n\nFeature Film\n\nProducer\n\nTHE TOXIC AVENGER (Announced)\n\nFeature Film (Remake)\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nMR BRICKS: A HEAVY METAL MURDER MUSICAL (2011)\n\nFeature Film\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nPETA PSA (2011)\n\nDirector Pro-Bono\n\nMOTHER’S DAY (2010)\n\nFeature Film (Remake)\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nPOULTRY IN MOTION: THE TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN CHICKEN (2008)\n\nFeature-Length Documentary\n\nProducer\n\nPOULTRYGEIST: NIGHT OF THE CHICKEN DEAD!
