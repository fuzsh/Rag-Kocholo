        "text": "Kaufman is a true original, a filmmaker who has used the freedom of low budgets and disreputable genres to express subversive political views and provide gobs of gore and gratuitous nudityIt is hard to think of another book that is simultaneously so honest and so inspiring; the fact that it is also smart, hilarious and informative makes Produce Your Own Damn Movie! a real treasure. - Jim Hemphill, American Cinematographer Magazine\n\n\"Founder of Troma Entertainment, the longest-running entertainment studio, Kaufman knows what he's talking about when it comes to producing your own indie movie. With candid interviews featuring some of the best producers working in the field, Kaufman shares funny, helpful tips on how to get your movie made.\" - Goldy Moldavsky, Independent Magazine\n\n\"[Kaufman is] humorous, smart, observant, educated and at times completely insane. All the workings of a long-time producer. Lloyd goes over financials, selling films, making films cheaply and reusing scenes as much as you can get away with. Now that's talent!.\" - HorrorNews.net\n\n\"Candid interviews, tips, tricks and tidbits scattered throughout the DVD give filmmakers practical tools for getting a movie shoot off the ground, keeping it afloat and seeing it through to the end- Lloyd Kaufman shows you how it's really done.\"--Horrorbid.com!\n\n\"[D]on't expect to plop this in the tray and be led from point A to point B, thinking you'll soon know exactly what to do. However, you'll still get a ton of useful advice, especially if you're a good study, and you'll probably watch certain segments multiple times as you get ready to produce your own damn movie. But even more casual movie fans (sure, I'd like to write a few screenplays some day - who wouldn't?) such as myself can find plenty of entertainment while enjoying these 'on the down low' interviews with indie movie greats. Lloyd's always got a trick up his sleeve, but here amongst the rock bottom production costs of this set is a treasure trove of information.\"--DVDTalk.com"
