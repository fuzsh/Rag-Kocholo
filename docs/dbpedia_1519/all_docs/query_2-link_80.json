        "text": "Director – Addison Binek (Movies to Watch on a Rainy Day)\n\nStarring – Addison Binek, Andrew Barber, and Brad LaJoye\n\nRelease Date – 2020\n\nRating – 4/5\n\nI love when I meet another Troma fan in the indie community. A lot of my friends don’t care for Troma so I always find it cool when I come across other fans of theirs. A few years back I met Troma fan Addison Binek at Cinema Wasteland. His YouTube series Movies to Watch on a Rainy Day is fairly popular and his first episode of Tromasterpiece Theatre has a solid fanbase.\n\nAddison recently wrapped on his second episode of his Mystery Science Theater 3000 inspired series Tromasterpiece Theatre and reached out to me to review. I couldn’t turn it down especially after learning it was on Troma’s Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. Thank you Addison for allowing me the opportunity to check this out.\n\n**Spoiler Alert**This episode once again follows Addison and his bag of popcorn Corny and film reel Reelie as they work at the local theater. During another slow night the three decide to watch another Troma film. This time they toss in Lloyd’s 2006 Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. The three then make their way through the film delivering 1 liners and puns.**Spoiler Alert**\n\nI had extremely high hopes for this entry in Tromasterpiece Theatre. I fucking love Poiultrygeist and after having as much as I did with the first episode I knew this one was going to be better. Addison may not have created the concept of riffing movies but he does add his own spin to it which is purely entertaining. This review is only for the portion Addison is responsible for and not Poultrygeist.\n\nThe acting in this one is more of the same from the first episode. The voice acting works great with the puppets. They match so well and I couldn’t imagine these puppets having a different voice. Also, Addison does a great job as well. In both episodes he is natural in front of the camera and delivers a very entertaining performance. Once again you can tell her has a lot of love for these projects and gives every scene his all.\n\nThe story for this one is more of what we received in the first episode. We follow the three as they watch Troma movies and poke fun at them. It works with the jokes but I would love to see a little more screen time with the characters interacting than what we do get. These short segments are fun and adds a little more to a film that some of us fans have seen several dozens of times.\n\nFinally, the Tromasterpiece Theatre portion of the film lacks blood and gore but it does have some puppet fun. Gorehounds will still enjoy the red stuff in Poultrygeist but if you are looking for additional carnage you will not find it here. Overall, this is a fantastic addition to the fun that you already get with Poultrygeist. It doesn’t take away from the film but does add some additional laughs. If the film ever gets a special release later down the road then Lloyd may want to include this in the special features. I highly suggest checking this out!"
