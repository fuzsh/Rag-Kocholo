McAlarney’s Futuristic and controversial horror-prophecy of an American Race-War. Ungovernable Films, Boston, MA.\n\nThrough practical effects, informed low-budget filmmaking techniques and unapologetic social commentary Honky Holocaust both pays tribute to and without irony presents itself as exploitation cinema. Lust charged graphic nudity, fully resolved images of your worst nightmares and more than a bit of A Clockwork Orange ultra-violence. The story and the visual narrative of Honky Holocaust comes with an anarchist message through the history of hate and violence by imagining what could be when we refuse to uphold any dishonest mainstream portrayal of racism meant to defer discomfort. Honky Holocaust was produced and directed in Boston by Ungovernable Films, director Paul M. McAlarney’s film operation with the mission to “Take Motion Pictures Back By Force”.\n\nUngovernable Films takes the position that the only thing more dangerous than bigotry is political correctness and the collective takes influence from all corners of exploitation cinema to create movies that fearlessly demonstrate their radical social critique on the modern condition.\n\nTHE THINGY: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE PLACENTA\n\nDirected by Joel Rabjins and Yves Sondermeier, Beglium\n\nDirector Joel Rabjins and Yves Sondermeier’s surreal sci-fi coming-of-age tragedy about Luuk, a human born, pre-teen mutant living placenta. The Thingy is a dark portrayal of a young and sensitive lifeform attempting to understand his God-given circumstances in a brutal world that rejects Luuk and traumatizes the placenta-child physically and morally for his grotesque and misunderstood “other-ness”. As The Thingy presses on within the cruel conditions of a society that bullies and alienates him we see the manifestation of traumatic stress in the empathetic creature that is forced into a realization of the dark pathology of human motivation from both those who reject him and those who exploit him to amuse their needs.\n\nSICK SOCK MONSTERS FROM OUTER SPACE!\n\n( DOLCEZZA EXTREMA)\n\nStarring Marco Antonio Andolfi, Alessandro Bianchi and Giovanni De Giorgi\n\nDirected by Alberto Genovese\n\nItalian Language/English Subtitles\n\nInterstellar Sock-Puppet Sci-Fi, 35 MM with CGI\n\nIn an unspecified year in the future, the Captain Pixws and his space-pirate crew are foreced to deliver tanning showers to every corner of the universe. The starship,Dolcezza Extrema, shot on 35 mm film using a greenscreen to incorporate psychedelic, futuristic visual effects that take sock-puppetry into a mind-blowing state of the art galactic-cinema!\n\nFEARTOWN, U.S.A.\n\nFROM ANNUM FILMS, NYC\n\nFrom Annum Films, New York, NY\n\nDirector Brandon Bassham’s party-slasher comedy takes place on the fictional St. Blevins Day at a mountain house weekend celebration in the named of debauchery.\n\nAmidst all the jokes, jocks, jizz and jams, the shamelessly entitled sex-seeking singles become victims of a holiday massacre when a redneck menace comes to crush more than their fragile egos if an evil curse doesn’t destroy them first.\n\nFeartown, U.S.A. imbibes the gory and sexy conceits of 80’s sleaze with a modern comedic dialogue to deliver a new form in horror movies.\n\nTHE SLASHENING\n\nDirected by Brandon Bassham. ANNUM FILMS, NYC\n\nDirector Brandon Bassham’s psycho-stalker comedy murder movie preys on a group of longtime friends who reunite for a “girls-night-only” sleepover, only to inevitably reveal their personal betrayal to each other during a game of truth or dare.\n\nThe spoof on a chick flick takes a sick twist when a night stalker begins to further eviscerate their sham sisterhood and enforce poetic justice with a stab in the back.\n\nREVENGE OF THE SPACEMEN\n\nDirected by Jay Summers, Radiograph Pictures\n\nRevenge of the Spacemen descends onto earth in a flying saucer, to the disbelief of a few witnesses that spot the outer-space craft. Unable to convince other backwater locals that what they saw was more than an intoxicated hallucination, the witnesses embark on a mission to find proof of the extraterrestrial invasion. When the gang turns up a couple of missing backwater cretins who recount their tales of anal-probed alien abduction (compounded with a seriously out of this world case of gas), townspeople finally start to BELIEVE. The noxious gases go from unbelievable to unbearable, and it takes a boozy backyard standoff to eradicate the extraterrestrial BDSM terror!\n\nVHS MASSACRE\n\nDirected by Thomas Edward Seymour and Ken Powell\n\nDirector Thomas Edward Seymour and Kenneth Powell’s Award-Winning New York City based documentary that investigates the decline of analog media in home movie distribution platforms. VHS Massacre explores the genesis of VHS through it’s death rattle with a uniquely Generation X point of view in its fondness for video tape consumerism and open-minded attempt to make sense of the effects of digital streaming and sharing on both the audiences and the artists.\n\nJUNK BONDS: THE RETURN OF JUNKBUCKET\n\nDirected by Stephen Lange, creator of Junkbucket\n\nGrisly psycho-shocker JUNK BONDS: THE RETURN OF JUNKBUCKET\n\nfrom seattle director Stephen lange. Lange’s exploitation of both visual and narrative horror uses a horror of taboos and references universal and ancient archetypes from the darkest circle on mankind’s subconscious.\n\nJunk bonds: The Return of Junkbucket will continue to sever and gnaw piece of mind long after you finally get around to putting away the junk.\n\nHECTIC KNIFE\n\nDirected by Greg DeLiso, Starring Peter Litvin\n\nFrom Munrovia Pictures, Detroit\n\nGreg DeLiso and Peter Litvin’s black and white pulp comedy centered on the story of a knife wielding backstreet vigilante called “Hectic” through a period of self-realization that follows the emergence of a new local villain, the “Piggly Doctor” that DeLiso’s new anti-hero must resolve before certain Apocalypse!\n\nB.C.

The story follows a beast of mythic lore on his quest for bloodlust and lovesick psycho revenge warpath unleashed onto a tribe of spatting cavewomen.\n\nStarring Kato Kaelin as an ambiguously gay and philandering cave fop, a cameo from Rodney Bingenheimer and a performance by rock-n-roll California quartet “The Ugly Kids”, BC Butcher is a superlative story set within the cinematic spirit of Troma Tradition.\n\nFear of the Light\n\nBy Jose Victor Fuentes\n\nDark Horror Thriller\n\nSpanish Language, English Subtitles\n\nTahísa and Paula live on a small island surrounded by mysteries with those who have learned to live together.
