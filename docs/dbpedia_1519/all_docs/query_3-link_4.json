        "text": "The film made national headlines in 2011 when a man named Sidney Klawitter purchased what he thought was a DVD cleaner, but turned out to be a copy of the movie. Klawitter called the film horrifying and a XXX film. The store owner stated that the device was prepackaged and purchased from a company based in Oakland, CA. No charges were ever filed in the case.\n\nThe American Chicken Bunker scenes were filmed in and around an empty McDonalds (the original doors, registers, grills, and fryers can all be seen in use). Other scenes (including a sex scene that takes place in the restaurant) were filmed in a church that also served as a home for the cast and crew.\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone were set to have a cameo as Arbie's parents, but the scene was scrapped during shooting so the audience never sees the parents. While the movie was still in production, Parker and Stone were often credited for being in the film."
