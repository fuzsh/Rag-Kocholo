When the American Chicken Bunker, a military themed fast food restaurant, builds it's latest chain restaurant on the site of an ancient Native American burial ground, the displaced spirits take revenge on unsuspecting diners and transform them into chicken zombies! Now, it's up to a dimwitted counterboy, his collegiate lesbian ex-girlfriend and a burqa-wearing fry cook to put an end to the foul feathered menace once and for all. A sly mix of social satire, extreme gore, slapstick comedy and toe-tapping musical numbers, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead is the wildest and best-reviewed movie in Troma's 35 Year History!",
