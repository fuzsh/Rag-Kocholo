A landmark achievement in the field of cursed-chicken-franchise horror mu sicals, “Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead” carries gross-out humor to extremes and beyond.

This no-budget release from the legendary shlockmeisters at Troma Films is about a horny teen called Arbie and a fast-food joint built on an ancient Indian burial ground, which leaves ample opportunity for vomit takes, poop jokes and gratuitous nudity.

It’s also a wicked, “South Park”-style satire of everything from campus protests to corporate power, and the amateurish acting and slow pace won’t stop this from being an underground hit.

Running time: 98 minutes. Not rated (graphic violence, sex, nudity, profanity, bawdy humor). At the Village East, 189 Second Ave.
