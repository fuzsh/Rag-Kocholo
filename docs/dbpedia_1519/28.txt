This has to be my favorite documentary that I’ve seen this year. Andy Deemer wrote and directed his experience as a producer making Lloyd Kaufman’s Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. It is painful to watch, while also being hilarious, tragic, and yet somehow uplifting. Well, the uplifting part is a stretch. It’s NSFW as there are lots of gruesome effects, gore, and, coming from Troma, nudity. At the same time, it’s blisteringly candid look at Independent films and the toll they sometimes take. I want to do a full review at some point and for now, just wanted to include this link. It’s an hour and a half but if you are interested in filmmaking at all, you should watch this. Awesome footage.
