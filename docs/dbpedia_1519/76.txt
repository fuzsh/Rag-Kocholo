I have so many mixed feelings about the making of Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, based on this behind-the-scenes documentary. Ultimately, they made a really brilliant, trashy movie. But at what cost?

Well, not much financial cost, given that hardly anyone got paid. For example, Robin L Watkins, who has a major role as the manager of the chicken shop, was paid $100 for the whole month of shooting until he quit and was given another $300 to complete it. How generous. But it seems that the majority of the cast and crew did it for $0, simply because they wanted to be part of a Troma film. If you're willing to work for no pay, then fair enough,…

1. Safety to people.

2. Safety to property.

3. Make a good film.

On top of Lloyd Kaufman frankly coming across as a a bit of a dick at times who frantically yells and berates a lot of the crew. l can definitely understand why a lot of the cast and crew felt taken advantage of. It makes me feel…
