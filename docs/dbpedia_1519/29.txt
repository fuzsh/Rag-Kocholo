Movie plot tags

When a fast food chicken restaurant is built on the site of an ancient Native American burial ground, the

displaced spirits unite with ghosts of exterminated chickens and transform into Indian Chicken zombies seeking

revenge! Now, it's up to a dim-witted counter boy, his lesbian ex-girlfriend, and a burqa-wearing fry cook to put

an end to the foul-feathered menace once and for all.
