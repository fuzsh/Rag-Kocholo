        "text": "ComingSoon can exclusively reveal that Cineverse has acquired the psychedelic docufilm Atlantide at the Berlin International Film Festival, with plans to debut it on its streaming service, Fandor.\n\nAtlantide follows the story of a young man from Sant’Erasmo, an island on the edges of the Venice Lagoon, who lives on his wits, isolated even from his peer group who are busy exploring an existence of pleasure-seeking expressed in the cult of the barchino (motorboat).\n\nYou can see the trailer below.\n\nAtlantide Trailer\n\nThe movie has received plenty of praise at film festivals worldwide, including Venice IFF, IDFA, Viennale, Göteborg Film Festival, Luxembourg Film Festival, CPH:DOX, Thessaloniki IFF, Seville European Film Festival, Vilnius IFF, Istanbul IFF, Visions du Réel or Docaviv\n\nThe cast of Atlantide features Daniele Barison, Maila Dabalà, Bianka Berényi, and Alberto Tedesco. It is written and directed by Yuri Ancarani.\n\nEric Rowe, Director of Programming at Cineverse said, “Atlantide is a prime example of the type of cinema we covet at Fandor. A vibrant document of people and place, the picturesque lagoons of Venice come to life in this alluring sensorial experience that offers plenty of style and substance. This bold, transfixing vision that defies typical genre conventions is precisely the type of film Fandor viewers looking for bold, creative, and entertaining films will enjoy, and this ride should arrive just in time for summer.”\n\nAtlantide is produced by Dugong Films with Rai Cinema, in coproduction with Luxbox, Unbranded Pictures, Alebrije Productions and Mirfilm.\n\nA premiere date will be set for Atlantide’s Fandor debut at a later date."
