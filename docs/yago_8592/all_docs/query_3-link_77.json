        "text": "SYNOPSIS\n\nDaniele is a young man from Sant’Erasmo, an island on the edges of the Venice Lagoon. He lives on his wits, isolated even from his peer group who are busy exploring an existence of pleasure-seeking expressed in the cult of the barchino (motorboat). This obsession focusses on the building of ever more powerful engines to transform the little lagoon launches into dangerously fast racing boats.\n\nDaniele too dreams of a record-breaking barchino, one that will take him to the top of the leader board, but everything he does to further his dream and win respect from the others turns out to be tragically counterproductive. The decline that erodes the relationships, environment and habits of a rootless generation is observed from the timeless perspective of the Venetian landscape and its island outskirts: the point of no return is a foolish, vestigial tale of male initiation. Violent and destined to fail, it explodes dragging the ghost city along on a psychedelic shipwreck.\n\nCREDITS\n\nDIRECTOR | Yuri Ancarani\n\nMUSIC BY | Sick Luke and Lorenzo Senni/Francesco Fanitni\n\nD.O.P. | Yuri Ancarani in collaboration with Mauro Chiarello\n\nEDITING | Yuri Ancarani and Yves Beloniak\n\nSOUND | Mirco Mencacci, Mirco Fabbri\n\nPRODUCED BY | Dugong Films with Rai Cinema (IT), Luxbox (FR), Unbranded Pictures (US), Alebrije Productions (MX) Mirfilm (RU)\n\nFESTIVALS\n\n2022\n\nGöteborg film festival, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nLuxembourg Film Festival, Luxembourg\n\nCPH:DOX, Copenaghen, Denmark\n\nVilnius Iff, Vilinius, Lithuania\n\nInstanbul Iff, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nFestival Do Cinema Italiano, Lisboa, Portugal\n\nVision du rèel, Nyon, France\n\nBellaria Film Festival, Bellaria, Italy\n\nIDFF Beldocs, Belgrade, Serbia\n\nBiografilm Festival, Bologna, Italy\n\nDocaviv, Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nRomania, TBA\n\n2021\n\nPremiere “Orizzonti” Mostra del cinema Biennale di Venezia , Venice, Italy\n\nVIENNALE, V’21, Vienna, Austria\n\nFilmfestival Cologne, Cologne, Germany\n\nFilmmakerfestival, Milan, Italy\n\nWarsawfilmfestival, Warsaw, Poland\n\nLa Roche Sur Yon Film Festival, La roche de la sur, France\n\nIDFA, International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherland\n\nThessaloniki International Film Festival, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nSevilla Film Festival, Sevilla, Spain\n\nAlice nella Città, Rome Film Fest, Rome, Italy\n\nLjubljana International Film Festival, Ljubljana, Slovenia"
