        "text": "Though most of the male costars were swapped out depending upon the language in which the film was shot, Brigitte Helm's command of German, French, and English meant that she starred in all three versions of L'Atlantide, thus ensuring that the hypnotic allure of Antinea, the queen of Atlantis, was totally convincing across the trio of films.\n\nAway from Helm and her personal magnetism, the film (I watched the 90-minute French version) often falls flat, and is bizarrely difficult to follow. Given the fact that the great majority of the lines spoken by Capitaine St. Avil — he who, when the film begins, confesses that he has been to Atlantis, and launches us into a flashback — are just yelling…\n\nAmbitious, oneiric, occasionally sexy, often just insane and a ready source of the sort of unadultered, unironic, pulpiness that has long been dispatched from the world but was still there in shadowy tenth generation xerox form during my formative years of Claremont and Moore.\n\nIt makes great use of it's saharan location shooting but it, for better or worse, also makes use of the people it found there. Playing on their otherness with a mixture of directness and artistic vision that could only really happen at that point in history, a collision of pre-war european colonial confidence and silent film trained imagery that probably shouldn't be celebrated or mourned but should at least be recognised.\n\nThe scenes of the lead…\n\nIt's a brilliant dream. Atlantis in the most unexpected place, not under water but under sand. Everyone there seems drunk, high or a slave to the strange queen. Some of the richest implied and sometimes shown sexuality in a film this old. Breasts squeezed and then a man collapsing. This was filmed in 3 languages all with Brigitte Helm as the lady of atlantis. She might not be in the film for long but she is its soul and the best performance. I'm reminded with the story and images of later surrealist works both filmed and in a way a book I read recently - Goose of Hermogenes. It made me think of the ending of the excellent and dreamy bizarre mystery that is the 1960s tv version of Belphegor. I highly recommend that by the way. Also Meshes of the Afternoon. The way the buildings are shot and the way most of the characters rarely stay still.\n\n(2nd G.W. Pabst film, watched the french language cut/version of this movie and I really want to find the German language cut of this!)\n\nThose looking for a standard pulpy action adventure movie in this will likely be disappointed or bored by this, BUT if you are looking for an absolute peak dream logic german expressionist nightmare of a movie starring 1927's \"metropolis\" star Brigitte Helm as the queen of a lost city in the desert, you will probably enjoy this one quite a bit!\n\nThis really feels like an art film crashed into an pulpy Indiana Jones fantasy adventure movie and came out as a totally out there hybrid of the two!\n\nI loved every second of this gem!"
