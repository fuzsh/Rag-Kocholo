        "text": "I gotta say, I’m really impressed by how rapid the drop-off in attention for silent films is as you slowly move away from the “canon”. As of today Metropolis has been logged by 124k people on Letterboxd. Die Nibelungen: another silent masterpiece by the same director Fritz Lang is sitting on a more paltry 4.3k. So what chance does little old L’Atlantide made by the now obscure Jacques Feyder have? None at all. Less than 200 views.\n\nI point this out because by all accounts L’Atlantide was huge success on release. As an ambitious adaptation of an award-winning novel it had no problem recouping its budget of 2 million Francs (huge at the time), brought its director a career of success and goodwill, and…\n\nFirst adaptation of Pierre Benoit‘s 1919 adventure / fantasy novel, which I had read as a teenager and loved for the original plot, inspired of course from Plato‘s (Timaeus and Critias), but differing in that the remains of Atlantis are found in the mountains of Hoggar, part of the Algerian Sahara.\n\nBut… despite the oriental setting, the spirit of adventure with camel rides, a secret fortress, a mysterious queen and her beautiful servants/ slaves and the wonderful design of the sets, costumes and inventiveness of the use of colours giving the movie a dreamy quality\n\n(More to read about this here https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/beyond-black-and-white-the-forgotten-history-of-color-silent-films/396785/)\n\n… the story takes much much too long to unfold ( and this is an understatement), maybe out of…\n\n*Written in August of 2013. There are some legitiamte spoilers.**\n\nJacques Feyder's Queen of Atlantis: Cinema You Can Believe In.\n\nThose interested in history and cinema cannot ignore Queen of Atlantis, a spiritual/secular clash of beliefs rendered through the form of adventure epic. In any year this film would be an achievement, and yet, coming from 1922 it becomes instead a damning indictment of our own pop-culture’s waning intelligence, taste, and ability to believe.\n\nThe film plays on our desire to know, as does cinema, and it is through this desire that we meet the film’s dual protagonists: Saint-Avit is an explorer of the earth and all its hidden treasures and Morganhue a holy man on assignment to complete a…\n\nUp until a few weeks ago, I must confess I had not heard of the name Jacques Feyder until getting a copy of Cahiers de la Cinémathèque (Institut Jean Vigo's magazine for a while, not the famous Cahiers du Cinéma) labelling him \"the grandfather of French cinema.\" And seeing that he did the original version of L'Atlantide - the more famous version came 11 years later courtesy of G.W. Pabst (a version I've yet to see admittedly) - made me want to jump straight into this.\n\nThere's something about the 1920s love of films shot in the desert and this film is no exception. Sumptuously filmed, it looks and feels like an epic. Love parallelograms, lust, murder, intrigue - the…\n\n1921\n\nA sweeping desert adventure epic whose influence can be seen in everything from Lawrence of Arabia to Aquaman. What it lacks in dramatic and narrative sophistication (some of which can perhaps be attributed to missing footage), it more than makes up for with the sheer scale of its imagination.\n\nThis also has elements of Lovecraftian horror to it, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn the author was a fan of both this film and the novel on which it's based. It's basically a tale of explorers driven to obsessive madness by the non-white people Lovecraft was actually afraid of, rather than the myriad yuggoths and shoggoths he used as stand-ins for them in his work. And, for what…\n\nThe original silent version of the famous book L'Atlantide is much better than the later 1932 sound version, which is quite impressive considering the difference in movies between the two. The story of 2 men who find themselves in the mythical city of Atlantis after being lost in the Sahara desert, where they are seduced by the ageless queen Antinéa, who turns her lovers into Gold statues, is a bit easier to follow in this version, being over an hour longer, and even though it has a good amount of extended scenes, it never feels like it lags as much as the later version. Also, it uses its setting in the Sahara desert to a much better effect, and uses…\n\nbased on Pierre Benoit's very successful adventure fantasy novel with the same title published two years earlier (February 1919), Feyder's \"L'Atlantide\" is a monument of early adventure cinema in France.\n\nthe story is a H. Rider Haggard style \"lost world\" tale (similar to \"She\" or \"Lost Horizon\") about a near-dead lieutenant rescued in the North African desert who recounts his adventures in a mysterious hidden kingdom ruled by a ravishing queen named Antinéa who - through her medusa-like aura - makes men fall in love with her and (eventually) die an anguished death, after which she has them gold-plated and installed in her trophy room.\n\nthis is a big budget production with wonderful location shooting in North Africa (with lots…"
