        "text": "I’d been meaning to see the French version of Pabst’s L’ATLANTIDE ever since I saw a ratty copy of the English version.\n\nIt plays like a fever dream, and can only be made sense of if we assume Brigitte Helm as the Queen of Atlantis is the embodiment of some kind of psychotropic drug, and Pierre Blanchar a man in thrall to addiction.\n\nThe epic settings, bleak and alien, give way to claustrophobia once we’re entombed with Brigitte, and things quickly stop making sense. Oneiric doesn’t begin to cover it.\n\nThe movie benefits from a very fulsome and exotic score by one Wolfgang Zeller. Stays quiet for ages then kicks in and barely lets up, adding to the fervid atmosphere. Zeller also scored VAMPYR, which makes sense.\n\nIncredible to think Pabst supposedly made this the same year as PANDORA’S BOX *and* DIARY OF A LOST GIRL *and* THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU. He’d been making a solid film a year since 1923 and suddenly this explosion of crazed masterpieces. With its Algerian desert locations — among the best desert stuff I’ve ever seen — this is not exactly a modest production.\n\nIf the movie IS a production from 1929, per IMDb, this would be like BLACKMAIL, a film full of music because it still has one foot in silent cinema. But the IMDb only dates the French version to 1929, the English and German ones came out in 1932, so if the 1929 thing is a mistake, this would be part of the great German rediscovery of film scoring that also includes DER MORDER DIMITRI KARAMASOFF and DER MANN, DER SEINEN MORDER SUCHT.\n\nMy house is full of Pabst materials right now for reasons, so it should be possible to ascertain whether this is his first sound film or if WESTFRONT 1918 has that honour. IMDb proudly proclaims that this one opened in Hungary in June ’29, but I can’t see it. Unless, as well as releasing French, English and German versions with different casts, Pabst also prepared a SILENT version three years earlier… OK, The Films of G.W. Pabst, edited by Eric Rentschler, makes no mention of any version of this coming out before ’32. So he’d made WESTFRONT and THREEPENNY OPERA and KAMERADSCHAFT already. THAT makes more sense, or as much as anything in Pabst’s strange, peripatetic and conflicted career, and as much as anything in this delirious and haunting film.\n\nFiona and I had both had the same experience of the Hammer film SHE — as kids, we’d caught the ending on TV and been horribly fascinated by it. Watching as adults, we had relatively meagre hopes for the movie, but it proved to be solid fun. It grips from the beginning, loses its way slightly in the desert, and arrives at its climax amid plenty of drama. Roy Ashton’s makeup effects are predictably crude, but the (spoiler alert) accelerated aging of Ursula Andress’s Ayesha still has some power to disturb, especially when Andress is replaced by a genuine old lady in heavy prosthetics — the hunched posture would be impossible for an actor to mimic.\n\nWe were watching because of the Peter Cushing Centenary Blogathon hosted by Frankensteinia: The Frankenstein Blog. Cushing is typically fine in this, and it’s nice to see him in heroic mode, but it’s not one of his most memorable roles. He forms part of a trio of heroes a bit like the lads in GUNGA DIN, with John Richardson from ONE MILLION YEARS BC as the purportedly handsome one (Cushing is striking, which is better than being handsome) and Bernard Cribbins as the token working-class comedy relief. Cribbins, his head a knob of gristle, ears like jug handles protruding either side, is played more grotesque than usual, I feel. He’s one of the neglected figures of British cinema (still going strong today) with roles in FRENZY, several of the CARRY ON series, and supporting roles to Peter Sellers. He also co-starred with Cushing in the awkwardly titled DALEKS’ INVASION EARTH: 2150 AD before returning to Doctor Who on TV in recent years.\n\nCushing’s hero was Olivier, and he aspired to his idol’s crisp delivery and athleticism — you can really see it in the climaxes of CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA, and in his Sherlock Holmes. “We admired the precision of his movements within the frame,” said Martin Scorsese, though I take leave to doubt how many of the future filmmakers teenage pals were appreciating Cushing’s use of his body as a compositional element in those 42nd Street grindhouses of the early sixties.\n\nCushing’s best scene in SHE, delightfully, is played opposite Christopher Lee, as the high priest of this lost tribe of Egypt (who are all curiously white). The film, true to H. Rider Haggard’s source novel, displays a number of retrograde attitudes, with the black natives a primitive bunch easily dominated by the pale pseudo-Egyptians (though the black uprising at the end is viewed more or less with favour!), but Cushing’s scene is amusingly sexist, as he tries to understand why Lee and his cohorts allow themselves to be dictated to by a mere woman. “You are many, and men, whereas she is alone, and a woman.” He reckons without the power of Andress’s frosty stare.\n\nAh, Andress. She dominates the proceedings, not by means of acting, but by an admirable refusal to contemplate anything resembling a performance. She simply impresses. Director Robert Day lets it go at that, happy to move things around her as briskly as possible, while reveling in Les Bowie’s cheap-as-chips (but charming) special effects. Andress is also dubbed, by Nikki Van der Zyl, who not only revoiced her in DR NO, but replaced Raquel Welch’s too-American cave-speak in ONE MILLION YEARS BC — meaning that in both of his most famous roles, John Richardson found himself acting with Van der Zyl.\n\nThe movie made me admire Haggard, whom I’ve never read, more than previously. If this film is even remotely accurate to the book, Haggard’s original clearly not only inspired L’Atlantide, that much-filmed piece of Saharan exotica, but also bits of Kipling’s The Man Who Would Be King. Not bad going. The film’s weakest point is probably the use of Roman soldier costumes for its Egyptians. Not quite clear what the thinking was there.\n\nThe adventure yarn is a genre Hammer dabbled in, but didn’t really pursue with the doggedness of their horror cycle. I suspect the reticence was budget-driven. A shame — the hallucinatory mess that is THE LOST CONTINENT is probably Michael Carreras’ finest achievement, and SHE is one of their most entertaining non-horror flicks."
