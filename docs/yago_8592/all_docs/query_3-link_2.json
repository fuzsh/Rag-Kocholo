        "text": "Story of search and illusion need. A mythical land who must be discover. Or invented. In an impressive library, two old men. One is a great Polish archaeologist at the end of his work. The second- his best friend. They are masters of a substantial slice of human history: legendary Atlantis. It is refuge and masterpiece, propriety and treasure.\n\nIn a day- two other strangers. A soldier and a theologian. For the first Atlantis is the space of great love. For the second- subject of many questions, of ambiguous desire and fatal knowledge. And so, the recreated Paradis dies. The gorgeous goddess is only poor ghost of a old man for who the truth can be fabricated.\n\n\"L'Atlantide\" is not a exceptional film. It is a version of Pygmalion myth, a ordinary copy of explorers memories, a page with Arabian flavor in old \"Don Quixote\"'s edition.\n\nBut his little message is universal. For everyone, at a moment, the dream is more important than reality. The illusion more powerful than the daily mud. So, the chimera is only solution.\n\nAnother merit of film/director is the casting. Jean Rocheford or Tcheky Karyo are good actors and their work in this film is interesting. But the story rests always gray with same dust taste of beginning. And the intention- remarkable but empties."
