        "text": "Synopsis\n\nCelebrated for his immersive performances on the big screen, Joaquin Phoenix, the acclaimed actor renowned for iconic roles such as the Joker, possesses a distinctive feature—a microform cleft—that has captivated the curiosity of fans.\n\nRenowned for his immersive portrayals on screen, Joaquin Phoenix, the acclaimed actor behind iconic roles like the Joker, carries a distinctive feature—a microform cleft—that has piqued the interest of fans. This article delves into Phoenix's medical history, shedding light on this unique aspect and offering an understanding of his journey with a mild form of cleft lip.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix's Medical Landscape\n\nBeyond the intense characters he embodies, Joaquin Phoenix presents a feature that has become a point of fascination—a microform cleft situated between his lip and nose. Unlike the common misconception of a prominent gap, a microform cleft manifests as a scar or notch. This represents the mildest form of cleft lip, a congenital condition that takes shape early in pregnancy, usually before the 10-week mark.\n\nStatistics Unveiled: Cleft Lip in Numbers\n\nStatistical insights reveal that approximately 6,800 babies in the United States are born annually with various forms of cleft lip or cleft palate. In the case of microform clefts, like Phoenix's, a 2009 study in the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery indicates their occurrence later in the labial formation process, nearing its completion.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix's Cinematic Odyssey\n\nJoaquin Phoenix recently graced the big screen in Napoleon, showcasing his versatility and acting prowess. The actor is set to captivate audiences once again in the upcoming film, Joker: Folie A Deux, directed by Todd Phillips. This highly anticipated movie boasts a stellar cast, including Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, Zazie Beetz, and Brendan Gleeson. Catherine Keener and Gattlin Griffith also join the ensemble, promising a cinematic experience of unparalleled depth.\n\nPhoenix's return in Joker: Folie A Deux follows his iconic portrayal of the Joker in Todd Phillips' previous installment, \"Joker\" (2019), earning him critical acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Actor. Joaquin Phoenix's filmography, marked by standout performances in Gladiator (2000), Walk the Line (2005), and Her (2013), highlights his ability to breathe life into diverse characters. As audiences eagerly anticipate his return in Joker: Folie A Deux, Phoenix's impactful contributions to cinema underscore his status as one of the industry's most revered actors.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat movie made Joaquin Phoenix famous?\n\nThe movie that solidified Phoenix's status as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). In this Roman saga, he portrayed the self-centered and paranoid young emperor, Commodus, starring alongside Russell Crowe's heroic character.\n\nDid Joaquin Phoenix have a baby?\n\nPhoenix and Mara welcomed their first child, a son named River, in 2020. The joyful news was disclosed by Victor Kossakovsky, a Russian filmmaker who collaborated with Phoenix on the documentary Gunda, during the Zurich Film Festival. \"He just got a baby, by the way,\" Kossakovsky announced in September 2020.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
