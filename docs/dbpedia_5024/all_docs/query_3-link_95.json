        "text": "‘‘I’M 42!’’ JOAQUIN PHOENIX EXCLAIMS when asked why he has zero social-media presence. It’s a late afternoon in May — a few weeks before he wins Best Actor at Cannes for playing a contract killer in Lynne Ramsay’s ‘‘You Were Never Really Here’’ — and he’s sitting by an open window on the 11th floor of a high-rise overlooking the flatlands of West Hollywood. One hand clutches an iPhone-5, earbud wires are wrapped around his neck, a pack of American Spirits are balanced on his knee, his sunglasses are hung in the crook of a white tee. He has a dad bod and his stubble is grayish. Phoenix is an activist, primarily concerned with animal rights (he’s been a vegan since he was 3) and has supported, among others, PETA, Red Cross and Amnesty International — but how would anyone know this, since he has no social-media presence (no Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter) to connect with followers and inspire them? It seems indicative of Phoenix himself; extremely passionate but unconcerned with the reality, the tangible facts, of what he does and who he is: the most soulful screen actor of his generation, and arguably its greatest.\n\nHis reticence to engage with Hollywood and the media is famous, and probably has its roots in how the press covered his older brother River’s overdose outside the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard in 1993. (Joaquin, 19 at the time, made the anguished 911 call.) But it also comes from the fact that he’s noticeably uneasy accepting what he sees as the fake confines of the celebrity interview. He talks about it now: the photo shoot he just endured for this piece, sitting here in this office with me, trying to form answers to questions that don’t really mean anything to him. (‘‘Everyone lies on talk shows,’’ he told Ellen DeGeneres in 2015 when he was promoting ‘‘Inherent Vice.’’) When flailing for an answer about the perils of doing publicity and his refusal to get comfortable with the fitting of suits and posing amid the flashes of cameras on red carpets, he finally admits, in a high strangled voice, that this reluctance might stem from ‘‘some antiquated idea of rebellion as I plummet into middle age, desperately clinging to something.’’\n\nHis performances are inquisitive and improvisatory, and he’s resolutely a screen actor. (When in talks about doing a play, Phoenix learned how long the run would be: ‘‘ ‘At least five months?!’ I said, ‘You’re outta your mind!’ ’’) Time means more to him now than it ever has. When asked if he’d ever do a Marvel movie, he says, ‘‘Something that’s going to demand six months of my time? I don’t know.’’ Part of his reluctance to discuss acting is that he works in an intuitive, untrained way, lately in idiosyncratic, large-scale auteur movies helmed by James Gray and Paul Thomas Anderson. ‘‘It’s just instinct,’’ he says. He has no idea where his craft comes from. He’s suspicious of the actor who ‘‘nails’’ it, and he doesn’t like rehearsing: ‘‘If I figured it out, I would be much happier and more confident and less anxious every time I work. But I enjoy not figuring it out. Bad acting is being self-conscious. Sometimes it’s a couple weeks on set before it feels like I find something.’’"
