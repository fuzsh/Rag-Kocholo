        "text": "Patricia Arquette\n\nOscar winner Patricia Arquette wasn’t just raised in Virginia’s Skymont Subud cult, but her parents were the founders of it. The so-called “spiritual movement” was known for not allowing access to bathrooms, electricity, or running water in the name of “inner guidance.”\n\nWhile still living with her family, she and her family left the commune to return to a more conventional life. Per ABC, however, the Arquette family wasn’t any better at that time either. “There was a lot of drama in the house,” Arquette said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. “There were a lot of chairs flying around.”\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, along with his siblings River, Rain, Liberty, and Summer, was raised in Children of God, which is a group with an extensive history of making members give up their money and contact with the outside world.\n\nIn a previous interview with Playboy per Marie Claire, Joaquin revealed his parents left when he was just four years old. “I think my parents thought they’d found a community that shared their ideals,” the Oscar winner told the outlet. “Cults rarely advertise themselves as such. It’s usually someone saying, ‘We’re like-minded people. This is a community,’ but I think the moment my parents realized there was something more to it, they got out.”\n\nRose McGowan\n\nAnother celebrity who grew up in the Children of God group was Rose McGowan. In McGowan’s memoir Brave, she detailed how she started to separate herself from it when she was nine and saw how the women were treated.\n\n“I remember watching how the [cult’s] men were with the women, and at a very early age, I decided I did not want to be like those women,” she revealed. “They were basically there to serve the men sexually—you were allowed to have more than one wife.”\n\n“My dad and I escaped with my dad’s other wife in the middle of the night,” she remembered. “I remember running through a cornfield in thunder and lightning, holding my dad’s hand and running as fast as I could to keep up with him…[The cult] sent people to find us. I remember a man trying to break in with a hammer.”\n\nGlenn Close\n\nAt just seven years old, a young Glenn Close and her family entered the movement Moral Re-Armament, a group founded in the 1930s known for its belief that the world could avoid war if people experienced a moral and spiritual awakening.\n\n“You basically weren’t allowed to do anything, or you were made to feel guilty about any unnatural desire,” she told Hollywood Reporter. “If you talk to anybody who was in a group that basically dictates how you’re supposed to live and what you’re supposed to say and how you’re supposed to feel, from the time you’re 7 till the time you’re 22, it has a profound impact on you. It’s something you have to [consciously overcome] because all of your trigger points are.”\n\nAs it turns out, Close only left the group after many years at age 22 when she started going to college.\n\nWinona Ryder\n\nWhen she was just 7 years old, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder moved to a commune in Northern California with six other families. “The place we lived at was 380 acres of redwoods,” she told Parade about the time. “It was beautiful.”\n\nFour years later, when she was just 11 years old, her family moved away to Petaluma, California.\n\nAngel Haze\n\nRapper and singer Angel Haze says that they grew up in a strict religious community, the Pentecostal Greater Apostolic Faith, that they now consider a cult.\n\n“We all lived in the same community, within 10 minutes of each other,” they told The Guardian in 2012. “You weren’t allowed to talk to anyone outside of that, you weren’t allowed to wear jewellery, listen to music, to eat certain things, to date people … you weren’t allowed to do pretty much anything. Church was on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.”"
