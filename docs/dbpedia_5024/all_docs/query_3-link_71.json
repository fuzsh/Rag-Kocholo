        "text": "An actor that continues to blow my mind with every performance, but does not get the recognition he deserves is Joaquin Phoenix. I’ve recently been on a Phoenix kick … and although I haven’t seen everything he has been in, I have seen enough to appreciate his work and his incredible talent. In over 20 years of acting, he has been nominated for 4 Academy Awards, but he has only won 1. Through his years of work, he has continuously given exceptional performances ranging from powerful biopics to heartfelt romances, and he never fails to amaze the audience every time.\n\nOne of his most recognizable and celebrated performances is as the Joker in the 2019 film. I’m not gonna lie, I had not seen the movie until yesterday after I read the screenplay, but I was amazed when I saw it. Joker (2019) is one of THOSE films that are cherished and constantly praised by film buffs everywhere (like Fight Club, The Godfather, and Pulp Fiction), and I enjoyed it … but only because of his performance. I think the film was good and well done, but Phoenix’s performance was what sold it. With a story that has already been done many times, it is hard to set them all apart from each other, but this one stood out because of him. He brought so much life into the character, not just from the outside, but even behind his eyes. He brought innocence to the Joker but also gave the sinister, cruel energy to the character that we all know. It was interesting to see his take on the character, especially after reading the screenplay. I also read that there were certain parts that he improvised and changed around because he knew the character well and wanted it to feel authentic. It wasn’t the script that brought the character to life, it was Joaquin Phoenix and this is just one of his many astounding roles.\n\nAnother role, in a completely different genre, that he is well-known for is in the 2013 film, Her. While Joker is more of a crime and drama, Her has elements of romance, comedy, and a little sci-fi. In this role, Phoenix shows a different side of himself. He explores love and loneliness and gives a heart-warming as well as a heart-breaking performance. Similar to his role as the Joker, you can see so much emotion behind his eyes. I think the best actors are the ones who can portray emotion without saying a word, and Phoenix has repeatedly shown his ability to do this. Even in silence, he could make me cry. There is so much stillness and simplicity to Her and he does an incredible job capturing every element and theme of the film. Without him, it could have been boring and the story would not come across as it did, but he brought meaning into it. Even looking at the poster makes me want to cry because of the story behind his eyes. This film is just another example of how he continues to amaze and how he can succeed in any role.\n\nNow, switching up real quick to the epic, action-filled movies he has been a part of. Action movies are arguably one of the hardest genres to achieve in, especially because they involve a lot of fighting as well as powerful monologues. But surprise-surprise, Joaquin Phoenix can do action too! Gladiator (2000) is one of the most well-known historical/action movies of all time, and he gave another incredible performance in it. He was even nominated, for the first time, as Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars. Although he did not win the award, it was still a huge step forward for him to be nominated. His performance is constantly talked about and he showed how he could successfully portray a difficult role in a blockbuster movie. He also recently starred in Napoleon (2023), which was another action-packed, historical drama and action film. He gave a chilling and commanding performance that channeled the power and triumph of the leader he portrayed. As one of his most recent films, this role truly reflected his whole career and how he has continued to give exceptional and versatile performances in every genre.\n\nAn underrated role of his that I want to quickly touch on was in the 2021 film, C’mon C’mon. I honestly didn’t even know about this movie until I found it and watched it a few weeks ago, but I was mind-blown and in tears. The black-white picture follows the story of an uncle and his nephew traveling together and connecting in new ways while they both struggle with their own lives and emotions. Something about this performance, and the film itself, spoke to me for some reason. I still can’t put my finger on it, but it feels nostalgic and fun while being a bit sad and melancholic. This is another performance where Phoenix portrays a lonely and emotional role, and he conveys that strongly through the screen. His performance made me cry one minute, and laugh the next. He was earnest and solemn, and he brought new emotions into it that are hard to find in films these days. I wish this movie was talked about more because it shows a new level of talent and skill from him that is difficult to reach as an actor.\n\nI did not know this was a topic I would feel so passionate about until I started typing, but it’s important to share because, in an industry full of so much up-coming talent, it is easy to forget about the incredible talent that already exists. Joaquin Phoenix has shown an incredible display of talent throughout his many years of acting, and he deserves all the flowers and all the praise. While he is an extremely famous actor, he is still underrated and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves in the coming years.\n\nThat’s all for today, but be sure to follow me on Letterboxd @sydneybroyls for more reviews and fun takes!"
