        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix Won The 2020 SAG Award For \"Joker\" And Thanked Heath Ledger\n\n\"Really, I’m standing here on the shoulders of MY favorite actor...\"\n\nSo let's cut right to it, shall we? Joaquin Phoenix has been positively CLEANING UP this awards season for his role as the titular role in Joker.\n\nAnd the 2020 SAG Awards were no different, with Joaquin once again taking home the Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role trophy.\n\nHis speech was wonderful, with him using his time onstage to thank each and every one of the fellow actors in his category, beginning with a HILARIOUS nod to his past competition with Leonardo DiCaprio in auditions:\n\nHe then went on to compliment Batman — I mean Christian Bale — by speaking to his incredible transformations onscreen and begging him to be awful in just ONE movie:\n\nHe also thanked Adam Driver and Taron Egerton, stating he can't wait to see more from both actors and that they deserve to be there:\n\nBut at the end of his speech, when he was winding down, he decided to break absolutely everyone's heart by giving an incredibly simple-yet-sweet shoutout to his friend and fellow Joker, Heath Ledger:\n\nUm...yeah, I'm in tears. Cool.\n\nNaturally, I wasn't the only fan to have a total meltdown at this callout:\n\nSeriously, the joke's on me because I'm never going to be OK again:\n\nAm I allowed to call out of work tomorrow for \"emotional turmoil caused by the Joker(s)\"?\n\nSo yeah, I'm sorry I had to make you emotional this evening, but seriously, what an amazingly gracious speech. Now, on to the Oscars!\n\nShare This Article"
