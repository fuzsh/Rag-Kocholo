        "text": "River always looked so sad and depressed. His mom was a typical stage mother but her hippy-dippy \"peace and love\" demeanor just makes her seem less of a bitch. River was forced into the showbusiness and supported his his parents and siblings. He kept doing it out of an obligation that no child/teen should have placed on them. His parents chose to be in a cult and have all those children, they should have been working their asses to support those kids. Anyway, River's true passion seemed to be music and also environmentalism/activism. Unlike other Hollywood stars, River appeared to have a real personality and would speak his mind. He was a beautiful man and very talented but unfortunately developed a nasty drug addiction that killed him.\n\nI have no idea where, but I remember reading a batshit-crazy article in which his mother said River was chosen by god to deliver a message about the environment. River didn't want to do it — something she knew before he was even born — but eventually he said he would come for a couple of years and then go back.\n\nExhausted by arguing with a pre-embryo, god stated his boundaries and River begrudgingly agreed to come for twenty-three years, but no more than that. And thus he was born with a non-negotiable expiry date.\n\nIn other words, the family wasn't accepting any responsibility for any of it and she had already washed her hands of the whole mess.\n\nI found it. I was a little off.\n\n[quote]Heart spoke, holding Rob Reiner’s hand for support. Her hopes for her son had always been on a wholly different plane than most stage mothers’. “We believed we could use the mass media to help change the world,” as Heart puts it now, “and that River would be our missionary.” She tried to explain that calling to the mourners, saying that she’d sensed from the beginning, as her labor extended to three and a half days, that River didn’t want to be in the world. She told how she had awoken two days after his death, understanding for the first time why dawn is called “mourning,” and suddenly had a vision of how God had tried to convince River to be born one more time. River told God, “I’d rather stay up here with you.” So they bargained, Heart said, smiling. God was persuasive, and River offered to go for five years, and then ten, and finally agreed to visit earth, but only for twenty-three years.\n\n[quote]Heart then invited others to speak. After a few further testimonials, director John Boorman suddenly blurted out from the corner of the stage: “Is there anybody here who can tell us why River took all those drugs?”\n\n[quote]The question quivered in the air. River’s young sisters, Liberty and Summer, ran out, and Heart looked astonished.\n\n[quote]“John Boorman’s question was a good one,” Heart Phoenix says now.\n\n[quote]“It’s what everyone was thinking. ‘Why, when you’re living this dream, when you can have any car, any house, any girl, you’re so famous—why? Why?’”\n\n[quote]“The only understanding I can come to is that River knew the earth was dying and that he was ready to give his passing as a sign.”\n\nJoaquin and Casey no longer speak. Their friendship always seemed more like a rivalry. Casey was Joaquin's tag-a-long ever since To Die For. There were a ton of rumors about Casey and Rooney Mara when they did their first movie together, when he was still married to Summer. But I think she always wanted/was in love with Joaquin since \"Her\".\n\nI think Casey was always jealous of/wanted to be Joaquin, and was trying to ruin him with I'm Still Here so he can take his career. Him winning an Oscar first seemed like an Eve Harrington moment. but Joaquin, who never campaigned for awards, decided he wanted to win too. Joker reaffirmed that he's the bigger star. The Academy was always just waiting for him to admit that he wanted an Oscar, then quickly gave it to him. Casey hasn't done much at all since his Oscar.\n\nR77 I think that's the biggest story on this thread, reveals who this family really are. When I became aware of it I quickly realized why it never caught fire. Someone who supported Emma and Hope claimed the site was threatened, even mentioned death threats.\n\nJoaquin Pheonix has a very young half sister Hope Phoenix Morris. Born in Costa Rica. I take it Hope's mother who's English and father who called himself Juan Phoenix had a nasty bustup 2012.\n\nAnyway comments on the petition claimed the child was essentially kidnapped by the father and given to Liberty Phoenix. The family made false claims against the mother, but she complied with psychological testing and extensive substance abuse tests and came up clean.\n\nBut no one in the Phoenix family was tested for fitness in any way. I learned that Costa Rica is a rat's nest of child trafficking and corruption. Probably easy to bribe authorities. Assuming you have the money.\n\nTo make matters worse the one person that posted on behalf of Juan on the petition gave a document signed by is disbarred lawyer and a sex offender! And I've heard Juan was an alcoholic.\n\nWere it not for lucky breaks in child-acting, these are a family who would be running the local grungy healthfood-cum-alternative-medicine store in Venice. The locals all know and slightly fear the family, who talk a lot about karma with sinister insular tones and smell like they possibly sleep in dog blankets. Maybe in the mid-late nineties Dad also ventures into a side-hustle running an anarchist bookstore that also sells porn, but the Internet puts that out of business with a quickness.\n\nThe kids all grow up as grommets - Joaquin & Rain surf like it’s religion, while Summer & Liberty attach themselves to skateboards - and they all drop out of school early in protest when they discover Buddhist philosophy at the same time (like the Glass family in Salinger). By College age they abandon that idea, however, to take over the store when Dad leaves to shack up with a bored but tight and wealthy yoga Mom from Trousdale, and Mom can’t deal.\n\nAt first most of the family suit the low-achieving beachy lifestyle well enough and get enough culture messing with tourists or reading weird books, but being a beautiful gay man with a tortured soul the restless and mopey River needs more. So, he takes off on his bike when he hits thirty. After a good few years burning rubber he comes to a willing stop to be with an older man he meets at Burning Man, and they end up making it work as a couple with adopted kids, in a sustainable Earth-friendly collective in Puerto Rico. The other Phoenixes only hear from him at the holidays via a phone-call or a postcard when he remembers.\n\nAs the years go by in Venice, the others give it a shot working together for the long haul, but eventually Summer becomes frustrated and depressed. She tries going it alone as a tattoo artist, but fails out when she realises she doesn’t have the drive or the talent. Her money-management and timekeeping skills even let her down when she runs a craft-fair table selling tie-dye. She then gets too far in with an acid crowd and disappears one night on Van Nuys never to be found.\n\nLiberty on the other hand secretly goes to night-school to study nursing, quietly resentful of her siblings’ listless existence. After moving away to put in late shifts at USC General, she meets a doctor who takes her under his wing. Eventually she marries him and turns yuppie housefrau, glad of the escape from the L.A. underbelly.\n\nEventually the store is put out of commission by a Whole Foods moving in on the outskirts of the neighbourhood, and by a failed inspection from the County Dept. of Public Health who discover rats and mold on the premises. Just a couple of years later, Mom passes with modest fanfare like any respectable granola crone, and all the local freaks & hippies slouch their way to the beach to pay their respects with Kum-By-Ya and plenty of ecstatic dance. Rain & Joaquin are the only ones of her kids in attendance. Despite their gloomy prospects, they smile at each other through the billows of incense around the eco-friendly funeral pyre, and rest their joined hands over Rain’s womb where their son is growing ever bigger. The beach grows dark and the waves rumble like a distant engine.\n\nR119 Long winded but I can say I found some of it interesting. However when Summer talks about not judging people as good or bad I can see where people like them can get into trouble. Verbage seems to be masking a sloppy even dangerous interpretation.\n\nNo doubt many if not most people have good sides, acknowledge it. Fine. It doesn't mean they're all healthy to be around for long stretches, or that you can fix them.\n\nMakes you wonder what kind of woke parents with woke values would produce kids like Summer and Joaquin who with all the people they meet they choose Affleck to not only fuck but marry and spend 6 months working on a project. Personality that would be intolerable for most people.\n\nLearning about Juan Phoenix and how he treated Hope and Emma fills in some blanks. They believe in amorality. Human life is cheap, if said human gets in the way. They say one thing, do another.\n\nI can see how these people can easily tip into criminal behavior. Or is it the rich in general.\n\nThe mother and father are useless. They never made any money and used the children at all times after birth to be lil earners. They couldn't even own a business, they are such lazy bastards. They joined a cult to take care of them. The cult was sexually abusive and preached sex with babies. They stayed in the cult until they found a better earning situation. So them the kids sang on the streets and begged. The family is dysfunctional. The drugs and liquor are a way to function for all of them. Joaquin made a documentary with Afflek that showed his own decline. Tried not to hide it. Then, he ran back to mom. She goes to awards with him. She is always there. Exploiting as she encourages him in animals rights. Animals have always been a creepy thing they go on about. The torture of animals....the mother wants them to be HER little soldiers. All are useless except for pimped out Joaquin.\n\nR148 amazing analysis. That is exactly the core problem with the family dynamic.\n\nThis is why it wouldn’t surprise me if there were some sibling incest afoot. When children are forced to step into the role of the provider-caregiver, then mentally they make the mental & psychological switch to the role of their own ‘parents’ - long before they are mature enough, and before they have the chance to grow up and go off to find their own partner outside the family with whom to mate and procreate.\n\nWith River gone and Dad split and Mom not solvent or working, traumatised and uneducated Rain & Joaquin became the de facto heads of the family and took on the role of ‘Mom & Dad’ to the younger sibling and even their infant nephews & nieces.\n\nI still miss River and often think what would've become of him had he lived. Too many people made mistakes that night. It could've been prevented had he gotten help and the right people around him. You can blame River for taking the drugs but he was a young actor in Hollywood, which he didn't even enjoy, to provide for a whole ass family while still being mentally fucked from his childhood in a cult. He also probably didn't know what was in the drink John Frusciante (or Johnny Depp, if you wanna go there) gave him or that it could kill him. And everyone around him enabling him just for the sake of keeping the checks coming in.\n\nJust sad and tragic overall. RIP River."
