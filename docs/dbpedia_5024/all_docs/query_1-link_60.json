        "text": "What is Joaquin Phoenix's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is an American actor, director, producer, and musician who has a net worth of $80 million. Notable works of his include \"Walk the Line\" (2005), \"The Master\" (2012), \"Her\" (2013), and \"Joker\" (2019). He has won many awards, including an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards.\n\nPhoenix's acting career began at a young age in television shows, but it was his film work that brought him widespread recognition. One of his early notable roles was in the film \"To Die For\" (1995), where his performance garnered critical acclaim. However, it was his portrayal of Commodus in \"Gladiator\" (2000) that catapulted him to international fame. This role showcased his ability to play layered, intense characters and earned him his first Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn the following years, Phoenix continued to take on challenging roles that demonstrated his range and dedication. His performances in films like \"Walk the Line\" (2005), where he played Johnny Cash, further solidified his status as a leading actor in Hollywood. For \"Walk the Line,\" Phoenix not only received critical acclaim but also showcased his musical talents, performing all of the songs himself, which led to a Grammy win.\n\nPhoenix's career is notable for his willingness to take on roles that push the boundaries of traditional filmmaking. This is exemplified in films like \"The Master\" (2012), \"Her\" (2013), and \"Inherent Vice\" (2014), where his performances were met with critical acclaim for their authenticity and emotional depth.\n\nPerhaps one of his most significant roles came with \"Joker\" (2019), where he played the title character. His portrayal of the iconic comic book villain was both unsettling and deeply human, earning him numerous awards, including his first Academy Award for Best Actor. This role underscored Phoenix's ability to transform completely into his characters, offering a performance that was both haunting and deeply empathetic.\n\nOff-screen, Phoenix is known for his advocacy for animal rights and environmental causes, often using his platform to raise awareness about these issues.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJoaquin Rafael Bottom, better known as Joaquin Phoenix, was born on October 28, 1974, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His parents, Arlyn (n√©e Dunetz) and John Lee Bottom, were both from the United State mainland; his father is of mostly English descent, while his mother is an Ashkenazi Jew of Hungarian and Russian ancestry. The family were members of the religious cult Children of God and traveled throughout South America with the cult. Eventually, when Phoenix was three years old, the family left the cult and returned to live in the United States. It was upon their return to the U.S. that they changed their last name from Bottom to Phoenix to symbolize a new beginning, just like how the mythical bird rises from its own ashes. He has five siblings, including a half-sibling from his father's previous relationship. Many of his siblings have nature-related names, such as River or Rain, and Phoenix called himself \"Leaf\" until he was fifteen, partially out of a desire to be more like his siblings.\n\nChildhood Career\n\nThe Phoenix children would perform at various talent shows to help provide financial support for the family and were eventually discovered by iris Burton, a leading children's agent in Hollywood at the time. When he was eight years old, Phoenix made his acting debut with his brother River in the television series \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" in a 1982 episode. He then appeared in various other projects with his siblings, such as the ABC Afterschool Special \"Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia\" (1984); the shows \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"The Fall Guy,\" and \"Hill Street Blues\"; the television film \"Kids Don't Tell\" (1985), and the films \"SpaceCamp\" (1986) and \"Parenthood\" (1989). He also starred in the film \"Russkies\" (1987).\n\nPhoenix, having established himself as a child actor, made the decision to retire from acting and traveling Latin America with his father.\n\nCareer as an Adult\n\nIn the '90s, Phoenix returned to acting, although he was often typecast in supporting roles as darker, conflicted characters in films like \"To Die For\" (1995), \"U Turn\" (1997), and \"Clay Pigeons\" (1998). The year 2000 became a turning point for his career when he starred in three films: \"The Yards,\" \"Gladiator,\" and \"Quills\". For his role as the emperor in \"Gladiator,\" he was nominated for an Oscar, and he went on to appear in several M. Night Shyamalan films (\"Signs\" and \"The Village\"). In 2004, Phoenix landed roles in \"Hotel Rwanda\" and \"Ladder 49\" before he was cast as Johnny Cash in \"Walk the Line\" (2005) with Reese Witherspoon. He won a Best Actor Golden Globe and was nominated for his second Academy Award for his performance as Cash.\n\nIn 2006, Phoenix was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the following year, he appeared in the film \"We Own the Night\" (2007) and was also the film's producer. In 2010, Phoenix co-wrote the mockumentary film \"I'm Still Here\" with Casey Affleck and was directed by Affleck. It follows Phoenix's life, particularly his retirement announcement back in 2005 and his subsequent \"career\" as a rapper. It was later revealed that his \"retirement\" and eccentric behavior were all staged and conducted for \"I'm Still Here.\" Other films he has appeared in include \"The Master\" (2012), \"Her\" (2013), \"Inherent Vice\" (2014), \"Irrational Man\" (2015), \"Mary Magdalene\" (2018), and \"The Sisters Brothers\" (2018), to name just a few.\n\nIn 2019, Phoenix received rave reviews and Oscar buzz for his titular role in the Todd Phillips-directed movie \"Joker.\" Phoenix and Phillips both accepted lower salaries in exchange for backend points. Joker went on to generate more than $1 billion in revenue and $500 million in profits. As of this writing, it is the most profitable R-rated movie of all time.\n\nVoice Acting\n\nIn addition to his on-screen work, Phoenix has also worked on many projects as a voice actor. In 2003, he voiced the role of Kenai in the animated film \"Brother Bear.\" He has also narrated the documentaries \"Earthlings\" (2005), \"Unity\" (2015), and \"Dominion\" (2018).\n\nJoker Salaries\n\nHow much money has Joaquin Phoenix earned playing the Joker?\n\nFor the first \"Joker\" Joaquin earned $4.5 million as a base salary. Both Joaquin and the director Todd Phillips accepted lower salaries in exchange for backend points on the first \"Joker\" movie. For example, assuming Joaquin negotiated a 5% cut of profits, that would have translated into an additional $25 million payday. Todd Phillips had a 20% cut of profits and likely earned $100+ million from the film. These numbers have not been fully confirmed yet.\n\nFor \"Joker 2,\" Joaquin was paid an upfront fee of $20 million. He will still have a small share of backend points, but much smaller than his first deal.\n\nIn September 2020, it was reported that Joaquin is working under a 2-film deal to play the Joker. For the two films, he will earn a total of $50 million. Since we know he is earning $20 million for the second film, it is presumable that he will earn $30 million if there is a third installment in the future.\n\nOther Work\n\nIn addition to his acting pursuits, Phoenix has directed many music videos, including for artists like Ringside, She Wants Revenge, People in Planes, Arckid, and Albert Hammond Jr. He was also an executive producer for the television show \"4Real\".\n\nPersonal Life\n\nSince late 2016, Phoenix has been in a relationship with the actress Rooney Mara, and they confirmed their engagement in July 2019. He has previously been romantically linked to the actress Liv Tyler and South African model Topaz Page-Green.\n\nPhoenix is the champion of several charitable organizations, including Amnesty International and the Peace Alliance. The vegan actor is an avid animal rights supporter and has appeared in productions for PETA and Nation Earth."
