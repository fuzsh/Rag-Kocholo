        "text": "#20: Merrill Hess\n\n“Signs” (2002)\n\nThis M. Night Shyamalan thriller sold us with its eerie premise, but “Signs” caught audiences off guard with its moments of humor. Most of those laughs come from Phoenix’s Merrill, who moves in with his older brother following a family tragedy. Although he helps look after his niece and nephew, Merrill possesses a childlike curiosity that wants to believe. While Phoenix brings levity to the profound subject matter, the character has more inner demons than expected. Having struck out in the Minor League, Merrill is aimlessly searching for direction. He doesn’t know where he’s going, but Merrill’s search for a purpose ultimately leads him back to his baseball bat. Phoenix hits this supporting performance out of the cornfield.\n\n#19: Charlie Sisters\n\n“The Sisters Brothers” (2018)\n\nBased on the 2011 Patrick deWitt novel of the same name, “The Sisters Brothers” is dramedy about a pair of assassins in the Old West. Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly bring the titular brothers to life as Charlie Sisters and Eli Sisters, respectively. Now, Phoenix was certainly in good company playing opposite Reilly, and the addition of Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed only makes things easier, but his is nonetheless (arguably) the standout performance of the bunch. While Eli has doubts about their bloody lifestyle and dreams of something simpler, Charlie is drunk, angry, violent, unpredictable and wholly committed to their career as killers. It’s one of Phoenix’s lesser-known recent films, but a must-watch for any committed fan.\n\n#18: Ray Elwood\n\n“Buffalo Soldiers” (2001)\n\nThis 2001 satire, set around the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, follows Joaquin Phoenix as Specialist Ray Elwood, a soldier in the U.S. army. In the eyes of his commanding officer, Col. Berman, he’s the definition of a good soldier, but in reality, Elwood is anything but. He’s actually heavily involved in the trafficking of heroin in West Berlin’s black market, and when a new superior rolls in, his carefully balanced disaster of a life is totally upended. Elwood is one of those characters who is at once despicable, but also utterly magnetic thanks to his devilish charisma. In lesser hands, this incorrigible character could have felt two-dimensional, but Phoenix’s performance sells it.\n\n#17: Jack Morrison\n\n“Ladder 49” (2004)\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is known for playing eccentric, troubled, and strange characters. He inhabits these roles in ways that few actors can pull off, but in a certain sense, it’s almost more impressive to see him similarly excelling in a more relatable role. In “Ladder 49,” he plays Jack Morrison, a dedicated firefighter. Over the course of the film, we get an overview of his adult life, both professional and personal, and bear witness to risks inherent to his career choice. Morrison’s life has been one of heartbreak, trauma, and sacrifice, and yet he remains committed to his calling, always willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice. The film gets heavy-handed at times, but Phoenix’s deeply human performance grounds it in genuine sentiment rather than emotional manipulation.\n\n#16: Willie Gutierrez\n\n“The Yards” (2000)\n\nDirected and co-written by James Gray, “The Yards” is a 2000 crime film about the competing contractors hired to repair railway cars in NYC, and the lengths to which they’ll go to come out on top. As Willie Gutierrez, Joaquin plays a young man who fully leans into and embraces the corrupt lifestyle that comes with his line of work. He works hard, plays hard, and hustles even harder. The character seems to have an unshakable confidence in himself despite the fact that, at any moment, his world could come crashing down. In the role, Phoenix switches faces on a dime - fun-loving and charming one moment, a terrifying force of violence and intimidation the next, but always vibrating with energy. It’s truly remarkable.\n\n#15: John Callahan\n\n“Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot” (2018)\n\nIn this 2018 film, released by Amazon Studios and directed by Gus Van Sant, Phoenix plays real life artist, cartoonist, and musician John Callahan. After a car accident leaves John with quadriplegia, he tries to come to terms with his own alcohol use with the support of AA, channeling his frustrations into his dark and macabre cartoons. The film didn’t get a whole lot of attention, which is a shame because it did well with critics and the cast, including Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara, and Jack Black, is fantastic. Phoenix is in full swing here, expressing the unwieldy frustrations of his character in masterfully chaotic and humorous fashion - and Hill is right there with him. The end result is a biopic that’s utterly unique.\n\n#14: Abbé du Coulmier\n\n“Quills” (2000)\n\nBetween Geoffrey Rush, Michael Caine, Kate Winslet, and of course Joaquin Phoenix, there’s a whole lot of great acting going on in this underrated film. A period drama directed by Philip Kaufman, it’s a reimagining of the end of the life of the Marquis de Sade. Phoenix plays Abbé du Coulmier, a role that demands he play it subtle and nuanced in a film jam-packed with big characters played by even bigger names. And you know what? One could argue that Phoenix’s performance is the one that has aged the best. Quiet, contemplative, but oh so deliberate, Phoenix’s performance is a lesson in “less is more.”\n\n#13: Bobby Green\n\n“We Own the Night” (2007)\n\nIn this crime drama, Phoenix plays Bobby Green, a manager of a nightclub in 1988 Brooklyn. Though he comes from a family of cops, Green has chosen a life of pleasure. But despite his attempts to distance himself from his family, the fact that Russian mobsters frequent his club puts him in the middle of a messy conflict. Like so many of his best roles, Phoenix plays Bobby as a deeply conflicted individual, a man who attempts to remain aloof and detached, only to dive headfirst into a world of extreme choices and actions. The film was less well-received than Joaquin’s previous collaboration with director James Gray, but in a film made up of archetypes, Phoenix stands apart by playing Green complex and nuanced.\n\n#12: Leonard Kraditor\n\n“Two Lovers” (2008)\n\nLeonard finds himself torn between two women in this romantic drama. Although Vinessa Shaw’s Sandra is the healthier choice in every sense, Leonard can’t help but be drawn to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Michelle, who’s also torn between two lovers. Phoenix is at the center of this love square, seeing a part of himself in the deeply flawed Michelle. Sandra represents true happiness, which perhaps scares our protagonist more than anything else. This builds to a resolution that some might read as a happy ending, but it just as easily could be read as a tragedy. Giving a reserved performance, Phoenix couldn’t be more convincing as a man drowning in his own self-destructive nature. Whoever he chooses, joy will likely never come naturally to Leonard.\n\n#11: Jimmy Emmett\n\n“To Die For” (1995)\n\nWith films like “Parenthood,” Phoenix established himself as one of his generation’s most promising child stars. He’d take a step back from the spotlight after playing Garry Buckman, resurfacing six years later as Jimmy Emmett. No longer a kid, Phoenix was ready for darker, more adult roles. This black comedy delivered precisely that. Working alongside fellow rising star Casey Affleck, Phoenix stands out as an easily influenced young man who makes the leap from delinquent to murderer. Nicole Kidman plays the seductive woman that Jimmy is willing to die for. While Jimmy could’ve just been a pawn in the grand scheme of things, Phoenix masters a tricky balancing act of being creepy, vulnerable, and hopelessly devoted, painting an authentic portrait of a manipulated soul.\n\n#10: Napoleon Bonaparte\n\n“Napoleon” (2023)\n\nPortraying a historical figure as iconic as Napoleon is a tall order to fill. And no, that’s not a short pun because Napoleon was actually average-sized. Phoenix is more than up to the task of playing the French military leader turned infamous ruler. Capturing multiple sides of Napoleon, Phoenix seamlessly transitions between being understated and commanding without ever missing a beat. Phoenix unearths moments of dry wit, finding the humor in a conqueror who was simply never satisfied, no matter how much power he amassed. As intimidating as Phoenix can be in the role, he demonstrates how Napoleon was also kind of pathetic. Some will tell you Wellington and Blücher defeated Napoleon, but it was just as much his inflated ego, which Phoenix fully embodies.\n\n#9: Beau Wassermann\n\n“Beau Is Afraid” (2023)\n\nIn almost any movie, Phoenix usually plays the most unhinged character. Although we wouldn’t call Beau normal, he is the least terrifying presence in this surreal expedition to the edge of all reason. On a journey to a funeral, Beau winds up at the mercy of a disturbed domestic family, a traveling theater of lost souls, and a mother who will never untether him. Battling figurative and literal demons, Phoenix earns our empathy as a man who can’t catch a break. We’d say that Beau is the most sane person on screen, although when you’re a magnet for such madness, one must question their own sanity. As far as Beau travels, Phoenix supplies the film with a claustrophobic sentiment that’ll inevitably crush our hapless hero.\n\n#8: Larry ‘Doc’ Sportello\n\n“Inherent Vice” (2014)\n\nWe all have preconceived notions of what a private detective should look and act like. The same can be said about hippies. You wouldn’t expect these archetypes to go together. Yet, Phoenix effortlessly blends them with this one-of-a-kind performance. Doc is smarter and more attentive than his shaggy sideburns suggest. At the same time, Doc is every bit as dazed and confused as he appears, often stumbling into altercations with bizarre supporting characters as a mystery unfolds. Although the grooviness of the 60s is still alive in Doc, he also reflects the paranoia and grit that would become more predominant during the 70s. Through Doc’s stoned eyes, we’re given a unique perspective of a changing landscape where free love is harder to come by.\n\n#7: Johnny\n\n“C’mon C’mon” (2021)\n\nOnce upon a time, Phoenix was a child star sharing the screen with legends like Dianne Wiest. In “C’mon C’mon,” Phoenix is now the Hollywood vet with a young screen partner. Woody Norman more than holds his own as Jesse, a nine-year-old who’s placed in his Uncle Johnny’s care while his parents go through a difficult period. Johnny isn’t prepared to look after a kid, but he tries to make the best of the situation. It turns out to be a learning experience for both as Johnny unearths his parental side while Jesse grapples with who he’ll grow up to be. Johnny might be Phoenix’s most relatable character, showing how even when you’re middle-aged, you’ll still probably be a work in progress.\n\n#6: Joe\n\n“You Were Never Really Here” (2017)\n\nWe’ve seen Phoenix don a wide variety of masks throughout his career, but never has he played such a visceral and brutal force of violence than in this psychological action thriller. In the movie, Phoenix plays Joe, a deeply troubled man who uses his military and FBI experience, coupled with the fuel of his own history of abuse, to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. Phoenix doesn’t say a whole lot in the film, but with his body language, facial expressions, and limited dialogue, he speaks volumes about this character’s inner turmoil. It’s strange to call an exercise in violence and despair such as this “beautiful,” but what Phoenix does with the role is a masterclass in acting, further elevated by Lynn Ramsay’s direction.\n\n#5: Commodus\n\n“Gladiator” (2000)\n\nWith his first Oscar-nominated performance, Phoenix revealed just how vindictively evil he can be as Commodus. Murdering his way to his father’s throne, Phoenix plays Commodus with the sniveling punch-ability of an entitled rich boy. It’s a choice that could’ve backfired, but Phoenix prevails as a villain who manages to be threatening and pitiful at the same time. One minute, Commodus can be the most confident man in the arena. The second that somebody like Maximus one-ups him, though, Commodus is exposed as the coward he is. Phoenix brings a Shakespearean gravitas to the role, matching the romanticized tone of this historical epic. Although the “history” part might not always be accurate, Phoenix and the rest of the cast all hit their targets.\n\n#4: Johnny Cash\n\n“Walk the Line” (2005)\n\nIn another Oscar-nominated turn, Phoenix delivers one of the definitive music biopic performances as the Man in Black. On a dramatic level, Phoenix was well-suited to portray the tormented Cash. His musical chops were uncharted territory, however. Rather than rely on archival recordings, Phoenix learned to sing for the role, adopting a distinct bass-baritone voice that’s haunting and soothing all at once. Going a step further, Phoenix brushed up on his guitar-playing skills as well. While this added to the transformation, it’s the heart and soul that Phoenix had to nail above all else. Phoenix succeeds in a performance that goes in harmony with Reese Witherspoon’s equally committed portrayal of June Carter. Both walk the line between love and heartbreak in this emotional powerhouse.\n\n#3: Theodore Twombly\n\n“Her” (2013)\n\nPhoenix excels at playing lonely losers - and we mean that as the highest compliment possible. If anything, we see a lot of ourselves in Theodore, who only becomes more introverted with a divorce looming. Theodore turns to technology for comfort, falling in love with an operating system named Samantha. Samantha Morton was originally cast as the virtual assistant, acting on set with Phoenix, although the two avoided making physical contact. In post-production, director Spike Jonze chose to replace Morton’s recordings with Scarlett Johansson. Despite this disconnection, we completely believe the bond between Theodore and Samantha, as if they’re two people speaking face to face. The romance may reach an inevitable conclusion, but Theodore emerges ready to love again and live like never before.\n\n#2: Arthur Fleck / Joker\n\n“Joker” (2019)\n\nVarious actors have been tasked with bringing this iconic character to life on the big screen over the years. And each of them has done something a little different - for better or worse. We’re not here to pit Phoenix’s performance against that of Ledger or Nicholson; that’s for another time and a much larger discussion. What we will say, however, is that with “Joker,” Phoenix has turned in the performance of a lifetime. He plays Arthur Fleck as a man utterly unhinged, and yet, for all his criminal insanity, he somehow remains sympathetic - if not relatable. He’s a tragic character, one who is at once hard to watch but impossible to turn away from due to the sheer magnetism of Phoenix’s acting.\n\n#1: Freddie Quell\n\n“The Master” (2012)\n\nPhoenix was in an uncertain place when “The Master” came out. He had only made one other movie in the past four years, playing a mystifying version of himself in “I’m Still Here.” To the bewildered public, Phoenix appeared to be a lost soul, not unlike Freddie Quell. Following World War II, Freddie struggles to reenter society. Searching for meaning, Freddie goes from the Navy to dedicating himself to a cult led by the charismatic Lancaster Dodd. The film revolves around Freddie’s journey of self-discovery. On Freddi’s road to independence, though, Dodd just might destroy him first. The ending may leave Freddie on an ambiguous note, but Phoenix unequivocally found his way back in a performance that solidified him as one of the all-time greats.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Joaquin Phoenix performance?
