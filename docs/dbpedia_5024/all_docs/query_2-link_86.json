        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara! It appears that the Hollywood couple, who welcomed their first child together in 2020, have quietly tied the knot.\n\nMORE: 12 of the most stylish celebrity couples at the 2022 Oscars\n\nIn a recent interview, the Joker actor referred to Rooney as his \"wife\" but did not share any more details about when or where their nuptials took place.\n\nWATCH: Joaquin Phoenix pays emotional tribute to late brother River during Oscar speech\n\nChatting to Italian magazine Best Movie about his BAFTA-nominated film C'mon C'mon, Joaquin, 47, revealed that it was Rooney, 36, who encouraged him to take on the role.\n\nWOW: The diamond engagement rings anyone would say 'I do' to\n\nHe said: \"He [director Mike Mills] invited me to his house and we started discussing why he wanted to make this film with me and eventually I listened to my wife, who is always right, and I agreed.\"\n\nThe couple have been dating since 2016\n\nElsewhere in the chat, Joaquin also made a rare comment about their 18-month old son while discussing what it was like to work with Woody Norman, his teenage C'mon C'mon co-star. \"I let Woody guide me, he taught me a lot, I hope my son can grow up with his sensitivity,\" he said.\n\nJoaquin and Rooney, who have been together since 2016, quietly welcomed a little boy in September 2020 but, in a similarly lowkey fashion, did not share the news publicly until many months later.\n\nMORE: Joaquin Phoenix pays tribute to late brother River\n\nIt is believed that they have named their son River after Joaquin's late brother River Phoenix, who tragically died in 1993 from a drug overdose.\n\nThe two stars met when they worked together on the 2013 Spike Jonze film Her; however, they didn't start dating until three years later when they reunited on the set of Mary Magdalene. They confirmed their engagement in July 2019."
