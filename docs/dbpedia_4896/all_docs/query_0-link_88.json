No show until now has ever won any of my best series categories without winning another award in my personal awards!\n\n– Better Call Saul (Writing), Billie Piper, Luke Kirby, Maisel (Directing) and The Other Two (Writing) all are repeat winners. With the exception of Piper they each all won their categories last year. Additionally The Good Fight repeats in supporting actor for a different performer.\n\n– With 8 wins The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5 just edges out I May Destroy You to become the most awarded season of television this decade.\n\n– The English is the show with the most wins without a win for best series.\n\n– Barry is this year’s biggest show loser having received 9 nominations and 0 wins and gone from 4 wins last year to 0 this year. It is however the runner up in comedy supporting actress this year for Sarah Goldberg. In its inaugural year ITVX is this year’s biggest network loser having received 7 nominations for Nolly but lost all of them. It was the runner up however in period/fantasy costumes to The Crown and limited series to Mrs. Davis.\n\n– This year’s drama series winner Better Call Saul wins the top category for the second time and both drama actor and supporting actress for the third time. It previously won all three in 2019 with its additional wins in drama actor and supporting actress having been in 2015 and 2020 respectively. Interestingly when it won drama series in 2019 it wasn’t competing against a single previous drama series winner whilst this year it was competing against 3 (Happy Valley, I Hate Suzie and Succession).\n\n– The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel comes back from its 2022 snubs to win comedy series and comedy actress for the first time since its first season having been the runner up in 2020 for the latter category and nominated for both for its second season. Previous winners Alex Borstein and Tony Shalhoub also win their second trophies after their previous wins in 2019 and 2020. Luke Kirby and Amy Sherman-Palladino meanwhile win their third and fourth awards respectively. The former previously won in 2019 and 2022 whilst the latter has won for every season of this show with the exception of its second in 2019 where Bill Hader won instead for Barry. No comedy in the history of my personal awards has ever won as many above the line categories.\n\n– With 17 this year marks the highest number of shows with sole wins since 2018.\n\n– Not really a record but I don’t think anyone has been the frontrunner for one of my awards as long as Ben Whishaw has in limited/movie actor for This is Going to Hurt which I originally saw back in February(!) last year.\n\n– I’ll add that a lot of these categories were actually a lot closer than I imagine most people might expect at first glance (it really was interesting seeing forwardswill, alittle03 and Victor’s respective predictions especially as all three of them together managed to crack what my top 3 in drama supporting were lol). For example I’ve championed the performances given by Emily Blunt and Rhea Seehorn in The English and Better Call Saul since both of those shows aired but there were moments were I was slightly torn between Blunt and Weisz (who currently stands as my favourite performance of 2023) in limited/movie actress and Seehorn and Debicki in drama supporting actress. Ultimately my appreciation for both performers, the fact that I’ll have the opportunity to still potentially award Debicki next year and the fact that as soon as I saw both performances I instinctively felt passionate about them like I did with no other performance this year (sans Billie Piper’s indomitable performance in I Hate Suzie Too). Comedy actor was probably the hardest overall to decide and was only one I probably felt sure about last night when I posted that I was ready to announce my winners tomorrow. It isn’t that I don’t think either of Pointing, Tarver or Amer’s performances stood out enough but rather that all three were excellent and it was interesting in Tarver’s case because whilst I thought he was better than Amer I thought he was level with Yorke who had some tough competition to overcome in my comedy actress category with Brosnahan and Everett. That’s probably the main reason why I went with 1st and 2nd runner up titles in both categories this year.\n\n– A bit more of a personal note about something that I’ve already touched on before but there’s something that just feels so cathartic about so many shows that I awarded and discovered when I first joined this site in 2018 getting recognised again with nominations and wins in my personal awards for their final seasons this year. And likewise so many record being broken from that year too.\n\nFYC:\n\n- Elizabeth Debicki (\"The Crown\")\n\n- Hacks in all categories\n\n- Juno Temple (\"Fargo\")\n\nInspired choices all around, but I especially love the Tony Shalhoub win (he’s my personal winner and I *never* understood why some people thought he did nothing this season) and having a second runner-up in comedy actress to shoutout Heléne Yorke! I also may have to check out I Hate Suzie, it sounds quite interesting.\n\nIt’s actually quite interesting with Maisel because whilst I absolutely knew that I was going to award it in series (you all know me so well 😎) and directing and Alex Borstein more or less got an advantage point after “The Testi-Roastial”, I wasn’t actually so sure about whether I was going to award it in actress, supporting actor and guest actor and I do wonder if the way the Emmy nominations played out and seeing how much I ended up really started to properly root for Brosnahan and Kirby to win again and seeing how gutted I was about Shalhoub’s snub ended up influencing me (especially seeing as in the case of the latter I’m still unsure who I want to win the Emmy in a category without him even though three of my personal nominees are Emmy nominated performances too). I was already considering each of them for the win in their categories and they each would probably have been a runner up at worst but when I was ready to award them I felt so sure that I do have to wonder how much the passage of time really influenced things. There is one thing I can say for sure that did which was that I have not rewatched a single episode of television from this cycle but I rewatched the Maisel finale two days after it came out (which is a speed I don’t even remember if I’ve ever done with a show before).\n\nI’d definitely recommend I Hate Suzie! If not for Piper’s incredible crescendo then for the really creative and subversive ways in which the show tackles such a real subject matter that in other hands could come across as too exploitative and horrible to put on screen but is something that really ends up being quite cathartic and down to earth here.\n\nWell I called a few but was way off at the rest lol.\n\nAll three of you did a really good job though! I really liked when you commented that I was a fan of all 8 of the performances I nominated for drama actress so any of them can win because that was true and in any other year any of them could have won. I also felt so exposed when you all correctly predicted my drama writing winner (and when you in particular correctly predicted my runner up too) and when both alittle03 and forwardswill predicted Sacha Dhawan for drama guest actor because I thought I almost got away with both my drama guest acting winners and runner ups being curveballs at that point.\n\nFYC:\n\n- Elizabeth Debicki (\"The Crown\")\n\n- Hacks in all categories\n\n- Juno Temple (\"Fargo\")\n\nGot bored this week and since I never posted my winners (I blame the Emmys rescheduling) I thought I’d give us all whiplash and go back in time. This was the first Emmy season I actually spent time on the forums and got comfortable here. Even though I have managed to catch up on a bit more since the nominations came out, I like to keep exact records of my winners at the time of voting to compare them year to year, so I’ll post my choices from August (that I really should’ve just posted back then).\n\nI’ll just do ATL + guest + casting for now, I do have winners for every category but my hands can only type so much. Since this is my first time doing this, I’ll also give a quick mention to my personal winner in the category from the year prior.\n\nFirst up we have COMEDY:\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nSupporting Actress\n\n• Alex Borstein – The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\n• Kristin Chenoweth – Schmigadoon!\n\n• Ayo Edebiri – The Bear\n\n• Janelle James – Abbott Elementary\n\n• Jane Krakowski – Schmigadoon!\n\n• Sheryl Lee Ralph – Abbott Elementary\n\n• Molly Shannon – The Other Two\n\n• Lisa Ann Walter – Abbott Elementary\n\nAnd the award goes to:\n\nWinner: Jane Krakowski – Schmigadoon!\n\n2022 Winner: Janelle James – Abbott Elementary\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nSupporting Actor\n\n• Brandon Scott Jones – The Other Two and Ghosts\n\n• Ken Marino – The Other Two\n\n• Ebon Moss-Bachrach – The Bear\n\n• Chris Perfetti – Abbott Elementary\n\n• Paul Reiser – Reboot\n\n• Josh Segarra – The Other Two and She-Hulk: Attorney At Law\n\n• Tony Shalhoub – The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\n• Tyler James Williams – Abbott Elementary\n\nAnd the award goes to:\n\nWinner: Chris Perfetti – Abbott Elementary\n\n2022 Winner: Alan Cumming – Schmigadoon!\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nDirecting\n\n• Jamie Babit – “I Know Who Did It” (Only Murders in the Building)\n\n• Kat Coiro – “Is This Not Real Magic?” (She-Hulk: Attorney At Law)\n\n• Chris Kelly – “Cary & Brooke Go to an AIDS Play” (The Other Two)\n\n• Charlie Gruet – “Cary Gets His Ass Handed to Him” (The Other Two)\n\n• Alice Mathias – “Bells and Whistles” (Schmigadoon!)\n\n• Amy Sherman-Palladino – “Four Minutes” (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel)\n\n• Christopher Storer – “Review” (The Bear)\n\n• Jude Weng – “The Last Day of Bunny Folger” (Only Murders in the Building)\n\nAnd the award goes to:\n\nWinner: Christopher Storer – “Review” (The Bear)\n\n2022 Winner: Trent O’Donnell – “The One, The Only” – Hacks\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nGuest Actress\n\n• Ayo Edebiri – Abbott Elementary\n\n• Tina Fey – Only Murders in the Building\n\n• Patty Guggenheim – She-Hulk: Attorney At Law\n\n• Taraji P.
