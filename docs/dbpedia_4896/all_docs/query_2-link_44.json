        "text": "Update: July 22, 2022, 2:05 p.m.: Set decorator Eric Frankel reached out to provide the complete list of cookbooks featured on The Bear, including in Carmy’s cookbook pile, in the restaurant, and in Sydney’s apartment. Frankel writes that he put together the list by researching chefs' lists of favorite cookbooks and scouring message boards to learn what cookbooks people training to be chefs liked and found most useful. The cookbook list below is updated with the complete list of cookbooks Frankel provided to Eater SF. (And thank you to all the sleuths who sent in emails to help fill out the previous list.)\n\nThe most talked-about TV show of the summer is certainly The Bear and there’s been plenty of discourse about almost every aspect of it, from the clothing — see, “Actually The Bear Is a Menswear Show” — to the internet’s thirst for the “Sexually Competent Dirtbag Line Cook.”\n\nNow I want to talk about the cookbooks.\n\nThe show excels at building impressively multidimensional characters through the eight-episode first season, but the showrunners also hid various Easter eggs to add even more layers. Throughout the show, cookbooks serve as shorthand for viewers in the know, giving additional insight into characters and station, while also serving as a bit of set dressing for those who don’t know the NOPIs from the Nomas (which is fine, this is all food nerdery, anyway). The most obvious use of a cookbook as a plot device comes in Marcus’s storyline, as he ups his dessert game, diving deep into The Noma Guide to Fermentation. It’s a fitting nod to the “World’s Best Restaurant,” given that creator Christopher Storer said in an interview Marcus is based on chef Malcolm Livingston II, who worked as pastry chef at the Copenhagen destination.\n\nThere are smaller cookbook moments, too – if you’re paying attention. Volume 1 of Modernist Cuisine, the mammoth culinary encyclopedia infamous for being pretty much useless to home cooks, sits like a paperweight in the back office of the restaurant. But perhaps the biggest — and most fleeting — restaurant name check is the big reveal of Carmy’s culinary influences via a giant stack of cookbooks. The scene lasts but a few seconds during the final episode, as Carmy wakes from his cooking show nightmare and hears his brother’s voice alongside jarring quick cuts. “Come on, you’re better than this place,” Mikey says before the camera slowly zooms in on books haphazardly piled on Carmy’s apartment floor.\n\nI freeze-framed this shot to stare at the stack. There were some expected books and authors — Anthony Bourdain, Tartine Bread. But then there were some unexpected inclusions, too, like Cooking at Home by David Chang and Priya Krishna, a book geared almost exclusively toward the home cook. I had questions about the books featured: Does this feel like a fair representation of a chef’s collection or a thrown-together pile of random books? And what does the collection say about the main character?\n\nI reached out to Ken Concepcion, chef and co-owner of Los Angeles cookbook store Now Serving, to help unpack some of the titles picked out for the show. Here are some takeaways — about Carmy, the state of the cookbook industry, and the culinary world at large.\n\nOne of the most striking things about Carmy’s cookbook collection is that it overwhelmingly skews white. But Concepcion, who worked in the restaurant world, including at Wolfgang Puck’s CUT in Beverly Hills, for 12 years, says that’s par for the course. He points to the fact that fine dining has historically been a white, male-led industry, which has boiled over into the cookbook world. “I tag Carmy as early 30s, literally a rising-star chef,” Concepcion says. “So he probably has gobbled up every single fine dining chef’s book, which will illustrate it’s a very white list of authors, for the most part. But I think that’s indicative of fine dining in itself, and of publishing.”\n\nIn good news, Concepcion says there’s been a “sea change” in publishing in the last 12 years, with a larger focus on home cooking and home cooks, and a shift away from restaurant chefs. “The focus, especially in the last five years, has been people. The audience now loves food,” he says, noting that cookbook readers today want to learn how to make delicious food at home, not just replicate restaurant dishes. “So it’s a very different field, in addition to the last three years of seeing more of a diverse range of authors and food writers and chefs being selected.”\n\nIn regard to the lack of diverse voices in Carmy’s collection, Concepcion has a number of suggestions on how the chef could make some improvements — really, lessons for all cookbook lovers. Beyond being surprised that Harold McGee’s On Food and Cooking and Sandor Katz’s The Art of Fermentation didn’t make appearances in the pile, Concepcion’s recommendations aim to give more depth to the collection. He suggests adding in the Bay Area’s own Brandon Jew and Tienlon Ho’s Mister Jiu’s in Chinatown, and generally, more books about Asian cuisines. He’d also love to see books in the stack on Gullah Geechee cuisine, like Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor’s Vibration Cooking, or books celebrating Black foodways and history, like Toni Tipton-Martin’s Jemima Code or Jubilee. “Obviously, diversity would be great, but I also want to see diversity of American regional cuisines, too, like American South, Cajun, Creole, all that stuff,” Concepcion says. “I would love to hand him Mosquito Supper Club’s cookbook, and he would just get lost cooking okra for eight hours.”\n\nConcepcion also name-checked a few standout titles, calling the inclusion of these books — Organum: Nature Texture Intensity Purity by Peter Gilmore and Grand Livre de Cuisine: Alain Ducasse’s Desserts and Pastries — a “big flex” since both are out of print and therefore difficult to acquire. “He definitely went to Kitchen Arts and Letters [in New York City] or Omnivore Books to get those when they came out,” he says. Or, he tracked down these tomes secondhand, which would have required a substantial investment. A quick fact-check of pricing shows the books go for $134 and $337 on Amazon, respectively. For what it’s worth, there’s also an amount of showiness in including three of seven books from the El Bulli collection, which clocks in at $625 from Phaidon.\n\nBay Area viewers likely also noticed numerous local authors in the mix. As fans know, Carmy worked for two big-name restaurants, Yountville’s French Laundry and Noma in Copenhagen. Fittingly, then, an outsized number of cookbooks hail from the Bay Area: the aforementioned Tartine Bread, as well as a handful of Chez Panisse books, Christopher Kostow’s A New Napa Cuisine, Rich Table, and SPQR. And though it initially struck me as odd Carmy would have so many books from a region where he worked, Concepcion set me straight. “When you’re working in restaurants you’re like, ‘Oh, my friend’s a sous at Manufactory, so I’m gonna pick this up’ or ‘Another friend is a cook who worked on a few recipes at NOPI so I’m picking that up,’” Concepcion says. “So not only do you follow what interests you or what chefs you want to be inspired by, but you also want to support, even if you never cook from the book.”\n\nAs for the home cooking cookbooks, Concepcion had a simple answer to account for their presence. “Every cook and chef has a family member or a parent that will give them a cookbook,” Concepcion says. “I’m not saying anything about David Chang — but that feels like a gift.”\n\nHere’s the full list of cookbooks in The Bear:\n\nFranklin Barbecue: A Meat-Smoking Manifesto [A Cookbook]\n\nAaron Franklin\n\nSweet: Desserts from London’s Ottolenghi [A Baking Book]\n\nOttolenghi, Yotam; Goh, Helen\n\nDessert Person: Recipes and Guidance for Baking with Confidence\n\nSaffitz, Claire\n\nThe Seven Sins of Chocolate\n\nSchott, Laurent\n\nRoger Verge’s New Entertaining in the French Style\n\nVerge, Roger\n\nChez Panisse Vegetables\n\nWaters, Alice L.\n\nDaniel My French Cuisine\n\nBoulud, Daniel\n\nSignature Dishes That Matter\n\nMuhlke, Christine\n\nManresa: An Edible Reflection [A Cookbook]\n\nKinch, David; Muhlke, Christine\n\nOaxaca al Gusto: An Infinite Gastronomy (The William and Bettye Nowlin Series in Art, History, and Culture of the Western Hemisphere)\n\nKennedy, Diana\n\nUrban Italian : Simple Recipes and True Stories from a Life in Food\n\nCarmellini, Andrew; Hyman, Gwen\n\nLarousse Gastronomique : The New American Edition of the World’s Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia\n\nLang, Jenifer H.\n\nTartine All Day: Modern Recipes for the Home Cook\n\nPrueitt, Elisabeth\n\nEssentials of Classic Italian Cooking\n\nHazan, Marcella\n\nDali\n\nSalvador Dali\n\nBlood, Bones & Butter: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef\n\nHamilton, Gabrielle\n\nEveryday Greens: Everyday Greens\n\nSomerville, Annie\n\nMedium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook\n\nBourdain, Anthony\n\nTu Casa Mi Casa: Mexican Recipes for the Home Cook\n\nOlvera, Enrique; Meehan, Peter [Contributor]; Soto-Innes, Daniela [Contributor]\n\nMomofuku Milk Bar: A Cookbook\n\nTosi, Christina\n\nRitz London : The Cookbook\n\nWilliams, John; the Ritz Hotel (London) Limited\n\nInstitut Paul Bocuse Gastronomique : The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide to Culinary Excellence: Key Techniques, Ingredients and Recipes Explained in 1,800 Photographs\n\nInstitut Paul Bocuse\n\nBook of St. John: Still a Kind of British Cooking\n\nHenderson, Fergus; Gulliver, Trevor\n\nModernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking\n\nMyhrvold, Nathan; Young, Chris; Bilet, Maxime\n\nThe Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery\n\nEscoffier, A.\n\nelBulli 2005-2011\n\nAdrià, Ferran; Adrià, Albert; Soler, Juli\n\nThe Art of Simple Food: Notes, Lessons, and Recipes from a Delicious Revolution: A Cookbook\n\nWaters, Alice; Curtan, Patricia; Kerr, Kelsie; Streiff, Fritz\n\nThe A.O.C.
