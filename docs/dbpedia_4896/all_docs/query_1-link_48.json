There’s no other explanation for how Phoebe paid all of the bills by herself.\n\nShe had her grandma for the first 5 seasons, and could have been left some inheritance money once she died\n\nMaybe. I suppose I just assumed that Phoebe would’ve been a bit better off (money wise), had her grandmother had money. She was pretty broke in the earlier seasons.\n\nI suppose there’s the fact that she didn’t seem to pay taxes prior to working as a Swedish masseuse (😆), so she likely just took cash in hand jobs and made decent money for a time.\n\nI always thought Joey should’ve been better off and recognised a lot more than he was, since he was a major character on a popular soap opera. He made a big budget movie with a really famous actor too, but nothing seemed to come of that.\n\nA couple of petty gripes based on a couple of different episodes I have seen on Comedy Central recently.\n\nFirstly the episode with Phoebe’s cookies - there is talk about her grandmother giving her the cookie recipe on her deathbed, but back when she died I’m sure it was mentioned that she dropped dead instantly in a supermarket.\n\nThe episode when Monica isn’t invited to cousin Frannie’s wedding because she slept with her husband - but I assume she slept with him prior to Frannie getting together with him, so not really sure what the drama is.\n\nA couple of petty gripes based on a couple of different episodes I have seen on Comedy Central recently.\n\nFirstly the episode with Phoebe’s cookies - there is talk about her grandmother giving her the cookie recipe on her deathbed, but back when she died I’m sure it was mentioned that she dropped dead instantly in a supermarket.\n\nThe episode when Monica isn’t invited to cousin Frannie’s wedding because she slept with her husband - but I assume she slept with him prior to Frannie getting together with him, so not really sure what the drama is.\n\nThe cookie episode had a few goofs like that. Rachel knows how to sail in that episode, but she had previously stated she didn’t know how.\n\nAs for the Frannie thing, some people are just like that.\n\nA couple of petty gripes based on a couple of different episodes I have seen on Comedy Central recently.\n\nFirstly the episode with Phoebe’s cookies - there is talk about her grandmother giving her the cookie recipe on her deathbed, but back when she died I’m sure it was mentioned that she dropped dead instantly in a supermarket.\n\nThe episode when Monica isn’t invited to cousin Frannie’s wedding because she slept with her husband - but I assume she slept with him prior to Frannie getting together with him, so not really sure what the drama is.\n\nThe cookie episode had a few goofs like that.

That makes no sense, Ross got an invite so he’d know and yet he also feigns ignorance. And given that they sent Ross an invite are they stupid enough not to realise that Ross just might let Monica know?!

That whole thing is nonsensical.\n\nI don’t think the issue was Monica knowing though. The issue was Monica being at the wedding.\n\nThe only thing that didn’t make much sense to me was Ross not telling Monica in advance, although maybe he didn’t know the guy well himself and didn’t realise about him and Monica until he saw them together.\n\nA couple of petty gripes based on a couple of different episodes I have seen on Comedy Central recently.\n\nFirstly the episode with Phoebe’s cookies - there is talk about her grandmother giving her the cookie recipe on her deathbed, but back when she died I’m sure it was mentioned that she dropped dead instantly in a supermarket.\n\nThe episode when Monica isn’t invited to cousin Frannie’s wedding because she slept with her husband - but I assume she slept with him prior to Frannie getting together with him, so not really sure what the drama is.\n\nThe cookie episode had a few goofs like that.

Phoebe could be doing a Michael Scott in not understanding the phrase “deathbed” when he leaves"
