        "text": "Thanks to the recommendations you have sent my way, I have compiled the following watch list for my new Britbox subscription:\n\nDeath in Paradise – beloved of the Puzzle Doctor, recommended by many – I watched several Season One eps when the show was on Netflix, but I’m willing to take a deeper dive . . . and maybe it’ll goose me into reading that Thorogood novel that’s been sitting on my shelf for three years\n\nVera (the early seasons) – it’s my friend Viv’s favorite public TV comfort food\n\nBrokenwood Mysteries – according to Bill, it’s New Zealand’s answer to Midsomer Murders mixed with Death in Paradise – only better\n\nSherlock Holmes w/ Jeremy Brett (at least the pre-Reichenbach Falls episodes and The Sign of the Four) – a promise made to Nick and Sergio during our Sherlock Holmes draft\n\nSilent Witness – Melmialeo calls it complex and satisfying (but I’ll have to keep my eyes closed during the autopsies)\n\nThat final season of Jonathan Creek (unless it’s truly terrible as some have said)\n\nThat final season of Line of Duty (which I also hear is awful)\n\nWith so many choices of where to begin, I ended up going in a more ecclesiastical direction. Many friends have spoken rather disparagingly about Father Brown and a bit more kindly about its spin-off series, Sister Boniface Mysteries. I decided to watch the first three episodes of both. I’m sure my opinion will have a huge effect on the success of Father Brown, which celebrates its 11th anniversary this month. Still, everyone is entitled . . .\n\nFATHER BROWN\n\nRumor has it that this is based on the classic detective created by G.K. Chesterton, of whom I have admittedly read next to nothing, this TV incarnation seems to bear little to no resemblance to the cleric on the page. (I am aware that Kenneth More played the character in a 1970’s series and would be interested in hearing from people as to whether that show stuck closer to its literary inspiration.) The fifty-three Father Brown stories were published between 1910 and 1936, but the modern inclination of the BBC and ITV when adapting “classic” mysteries seems to be to set them in the 1950’s, a much easier decade for when you have to find British locations that can pass for “period.” Father Brown is filmed in the Cotswolds, and unlike the book character who travels all over the place, this priest stays put – I assume, for budgetary reasons.\n\nActor Mark Williams (Mr. Weasley from the Harry Potter films!!) plays the good Father, and he’s perfectly lovely. Any weakness I detect in his speech or behavior I blame on the writing, which is blandly generic and transforms what could have been a very special detective show into Murder, He Preached. I have read that this series was created to be shown on afternoon TV, which I’m sure had some effect on its conception. It’s not that the program shies away from adult topics; it’s just that, with a few exceptions, these topics are presented with all the dramatic flair of tapioca.\n\nWhile I like Williams, I’m less enamored of the supporting cast I have met so far. But then, I have shied away from early episodes of Poirot because of the way it stuck Hastings, Japp and Miss Lemon into every episode in a broadly comical way. At least, it’s Hastings, Japp and Miss Lemon! So far, I’m not crazy about any of the regulars on Father Brown. All of them are original characters not to be found in the stories, and they amount to little more than a series of broad character tropes stuffed into human form. Lady Felicia Montague (Nancy Carroll) flirts, Inspector Valentine (Hugo Speer) grouses like a poor man’s Inspector Slack, and the worst offender is Mrs. Bridgette McCarthy (Sorscha Cusack), Father Brown’s housekeeper, who quickly wears out her welcome with standard lines about her great cooking, her “hatred” of gossip, and her antipathy for Lady Felicia or just about any other person in Father Brown’s life.\n\nThe first three episodes are all based on actual stories. Well, they share the names of the stories, something that will evidently fade out after the first season. But it doesn’t matter: these screenplays include only the rudimentary elements of the tales on which they were based. Each story has been adjusted to more closely resemble a “traditional” mystery, with more suspects of a generic variety, the tendency of Father Brown to be on the scene for the murder, where he finds clues under the nose of the clueless Inspector Valentine, who invariably arrests the wrong suspect. Sometimes, the dialogue pays lip service to Father Brown’s superior goodness as well as his intellect: he is neither racist nor classist nor homophobic nor mean, just practically perfect in every way.\n\nEpisode One is based on the story, “The Hammer of God,” which concerns the murder of an aristocratic cad, the brother of the local vicar, who is cuckolding the local blacksmith and is found struck to death in the graveyard with the blacksmith’s hammer. These three men, plus the blacksmith’s wife, constitute the cast of the written tale, but here there are several more suspects, including Lady Felicia and Father Brown’s Polish housekeeper. For no reason whatsoever, the victim is made bisexual, with another added character serving as his pathetic gay sex toy. (Funnily enough, there is no sign of this in Chesterton’s story!) At least the solution is the same, and in both cases Father Brown confronts the murderer on the church roof. The speech he gives in the story is a quietly thrilling one about ecclesiastical humility; unfortunately, this gets lost in the translation to the screen.\n\n“The Flying Stars” is the weakest episode I have watched so far, mostly because when a certain character appears, they should be wearing a t-shirt that says “ARREST ME, PLEASE! I AM THE KILLER!” Lady Felicia becomes a suspect for the second time in a row. The killer is revealed with fifteen minutes left to go and very little to explain, but Father Brown does his best on a train while the killer sits scowling . . . in drag. Sadder still, the printed tale stars Father Brown’s arch-nemesis – the thief Flambeau; evidently, we are going to have to wait until a later episode to meet him.\n\n“The Wrong Shape” is easily the best episode so far, largely thanks to some great acting by Ruth Gemmell (Bridgerton) as the estranged wife of a doctor turned poet. The poor woman is forced to live on the estate with her husband’s much younger (and very loud) mistress and the Hindu mystic that the doctor befriended on a solo trip to the Far East. The very grumpy family attorney rounds out this list of suspects. As usual, Father Brown is on the scene, invited along with Lady Felicia to a poetry recital (the housekeeper unfortunately tags along). The material in the recital is shocking enough to offend the guests, but it’s also so poorly written by the show’s screenwriters that we wince for all the wrong reasons.\n\nStill, things improve after the murder, and for the first time, the character to whom I pointed at the screen and cried, “J’accuse!” was not the killer! In fact, the ending, propelled by Gemmell’s performance, is quite moving, and Father Brown’s handling of the people and the situation is very endearing. If the show moves in this direction, my whole viewing experience might improve. Unfortunately, I think the Murder, She Wrote vibe is too deeply settled in, and I have a feeling that my progression through eleven seasons of Father Brown will be slow and sketchy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSister Boniface made her first appearance in the first season of Father Brown as a recurring character. A middle-aged nun, she is also a brilliant scientist, and she provides forensic support, as well as some good common sense, to whatever investigation comes her way. A spin-off series for the character was ordered for Britbox and has been playing on the service for two 10-episode seasons, with a third series now being filmed.\n\nSister Boniface clearly capitalizes on the success of Father Brown by being as similar as possible. We’re still in the Cotswolds, although now we are in the 1960s, a much more interesting decade than the 50’s. Lorna Watson is a charming Boniface, although as soon as she began speaking I had to flip on the subtitles; she rattles off scientific information a mile a minute! Like Father Brown, our heroine is surrounded by an extensive supporting cast. But while none of them stand out as particularly original characters, they are a far more compelling and humorous lot.\n\nAs a longtime fan of films like The Trouble with Angels and Sister Act, I admit to being a sucker for a good comedy centered around nuns. I’ll even confess to having watched The Flying Nun as a kid!! Carolyn Pickles, a niece to the great Christina Pickles, makes an enjoyable foil to Sister B. as the Mother Superior, and Virginia Fiol and Tina Chiang are excellent as Sisters Reginald and Peter. For once, the local policeman, Sam Gillespie (Max Brown) is not a boob! In fact, he’s quite good-looking, smart, and more than happy to work with Sister Boniface. Jerry Iwu plays Felix Livingstone, a cop from Bermuda who was supposed to work with Scotland Yard and ended up in the village of Great Slaughter instead. (The jury is still out as to how much charm and interest this “fish out of water” subplot will bring to the whole.) There’s also a love interest for Max in the form of a headline-seeking local journalist (Miranda Raison) and a very funny landlady for Felix named Mrs. Clam (Belinda Lang).\n\nSince G.K. Chesterton had nothing to do with the creation of Sister Boniface, all the mysteries are original tales. So far, they’re funnier and somewhat more involving than the ones I’ve seen on Father Brown. The first episode, “Unnatural Causes,” does a nice job introducing the series characters and involving them in a fairly intriguing mystery of a rather pathetic woman being murdered at the local festival. The killer’s identity isn’t a total surprise, but their transformation into a particularly cruel villain at the end is well rendered.\n\nEpisode Two, “Lights, Camera, Murder,” is a charming comedy about the convent renting the church to a TV studio in order to film an episode of the hit espionage series, Operation QT. When a prop gun ends up shooting real bullets, Sister Boniface steps in to try and prevent a real murder. As much as the saving of human life concerns her, the really pressing issue is dealing with Mother Superior’s antipathy for the show business. The show does a much better job than Father Brown of interweaving the preoccupations of its series characters into the mystery of the hour.\n\nOperation QT is a delightfully ridiculous show-within-a show. The whole production seems totally cheesy – until you remember the early production values of Dr. Who. I thought everyone was very funny, and if the solution comes out of nowhere, it’s still an enjoyable romp.\n\nEpisode Three, “Love and Other Puzzles,” concerns a serial killer who is targeting women of late middle-age who are looking for love in all the wrong places. Again, this one is very entertaining, but you have to accept the fact that Sister Boniface plays even serious situations like this for laughs. Plus, the killer in this one is waaaay too obvious!\n\nSo far, Sister Boniface seems light and enjoyable, while Father Brown feels light and far too diluted from its source. Neither of these series seem particularly binge-worthy, but for an occasional hour of not-too-taxing mystery fare, they both promise mild fun.\n\nNow, let’s get cracking in search of the really good stuff!"
