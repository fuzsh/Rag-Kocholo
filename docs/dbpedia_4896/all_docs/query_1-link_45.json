I'd imagine most of the possible records were probably in the late '80s-early '90s, when casts were really bloated. I know that at one point in mid '95, AMC had 38 contract cast members. I think GL in the '90s may have had more than this, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThis is the highest I've seen in the last six or so years\n\nAMC had 35 contract players in this opening (36 characters with Adam/Stuart)\n\nI was just going to say! And of course a year or two after that the cast reallys tarted to feel tiny (and I guess a lot of roles were cut). I forgot some of those characters--talenst like Bobby Seggert (who's becoming a huge theatre name) wasted as Sam...\n\nHow big was the cast at AW when it was 90 minutes? I remember reading it was kinda unwieldy.\n\nNever realized but PGP really did try at saving GL in the 1990's and the big cast must have been an effort at seeing if any new characters took hold.\n\nI would quess that Y&R must have had a large cast when it changed to a hour and Bell created the new familes and phased out the old crew. I still respect how he managed to pull it off.\n\nI'm not sure if Y&R had that large of a cast during the transition. There was a very limited group during the half-hour run.\n\nI would think ATWT of the Marland era had a large contract cast, but then I realized a lot of the people may have been recurring or on short-term deals.\n\nVery good question. I remember in I think it was Soap Opera Weekly used to run the cast list to the shows once in awhile and I remember GL/ATWT, and sometimes GH and AMC having larger casts then the rest of the shows\n\nI'm not sure how many of those were on at the same time (I think Ted, the Lavertys, and Sylvie were gone by the time the Holloways arrived; Alice, Brooks, Rose, Miranda, Taylor, Louise, Kevin were gone by the time Leigh Hobson showed up).\n\nThese had to have been the two years that Y&R's contract cast was the most bloated.\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Nu01FzhLY\n\nNo wonder people like Jerry, Jeanne, even Jess were struggling for story (or so we think) I don't even know why half of those people in the 1997 cast list were even put on contract.\n\nAMC has 37 regular cast members listed in the closing credits of Tom and Erica's wedding from 1978. There's no clear distinction between who was on contract and who was just recurring, though. You'd assume that there would be some sort of separation, but you have people like Ruth, Charles, and Nancy way at the end, after kids like Tad and Charlie:\n\nFrances Heflin as Mona Kane\n\nSusan Lucci as Erica Kane\n\nNick Benedict as Philip Brent\n\nChris Wallace as Mel Jacobi\n\nRay MacDonnell as Dr. Joe Martin\n\nRichard Van Vleet as Chuck Tyler\n\nNancy Frangione as Tara Martin Brent\n\nCandice Earley as Donna Tyler\n\nPatricia Dixon as Caroline Murray Grant\n\nDaren Kelly as Dan Kennicott\n\nJohn Danelle as Dr. Franklin Grant\n\nRichard Shoberg as Tom Cudahy\n\nJack Magee as Wally McFadden\n\nWilliam Griffis as Harlan Tucker\n\nKathleen Noone as Ellen Shepherd\n\nMark La Mura as Mark Dalton\n\nWilliam Mooney as Paul Martin\n\nRuth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler\n\nPeter White as Lincoln Tyler\n\nFrancesca James as Kelly Cole\n\nEileen Herlie as Myrtle Lum Fargate\n\nSusan Plantt-Winston as Claudette Montgomery\n\nSandy Gabriel as Edna Thornton\n\nLarry Fleischman as Benny Sago\n\nJames O'Sullivan as Jeff Martin\n\nRobin Strasser as Christina Karras\n\nWarren Burton as Eddie Dorrance\n\nTricia Pursley as Devon Shepherd\n\nJohn E.
