        "text": "Might have been said before (perhaps by me), but in TOW with all the Rugby, the British accents of Emily’s friends are appalling\n\nNot disagreeing but weren’t both actors British?\n\nOne of the actors is apparently from Manchester, so if he speaks with a Mancunian accent irl that means he faked his accent in the show.\n\nI don’t know about the one who played Liam, but it’s possible he faked or exaggerated his accent.\n\nIt still amuses me that Christina Pickles (Judy) is originally from Yorkshire.\n\n0\n\nI remember a British actor being interviewed about his role in a US show (or film). He said he was sent to a linguistics coach in order to make his accent sound more 'British' for a US audience. Apparently this is not unusual, which may explain why the accents often sound unnatural or exaggerated to UK audiences.\n\n1\n\nI remember a British actor being interviewed about his role in a US show (or film).

I’m from the South East and my Husband is Scottish.

There’s no other explanation for how Phoebe paid all of the bills by herself.\n\n0\n\nI remember a British actor being interviewed about his role in a US show (or film).

There’s no other explanation for how Phoebe paid all of the bills by herself.\n\nShe had her grandma for the first 5 seasons, and could have been left some inheritance money once she died\n\nMaybe. I suppose I just assumed that Phoebe would’ve been a bit better off (money wise), had her grandmother had money. She was pretty broke in the earlier seasons.\n\nI suppose there’s the fact that she didn’t seem to pay taxes prior to working as a Swedish masseuse (😆), so she likely just took cash in hand jobs and made decent money for a time.\n\nI always thought Joey should’ve been better off and recognised a lot more than he was, since he was a major character on a popular soap opera. He made a big budget movie with a really famous actor too, but nothing seemed to come of that.\n\n1\n\nA couple of petty gripes based on a couple of different episodes I have seen on Comedy Central recently.\n\nFirstly the episode with Phoebe’s cookies - there is talk about her grandmother giving her the cookie recipe on her deathbed, but back when she died I’m sure it was mentioned that she dropped dead instantly in a supermarket.\n\nThe episode when Monica isn’t invited to cousin Frannie’s wedding because she slept with her husband - but I assume she slept with him prior to Frannie getting together with him, so not really sure what the drama is.\n\n0\n\nA couple of petty gripes based on a couple of different episodes I have seen on Comedy Central recently.\n\nFirstly the episode with Phoebe’s cookies - there is talk about her grandmother giving her the cookie recipe on her deathbed, but back when she died I’m sure it was mentioned that she dropped dead instantly in a supermarket.\n\nThe episode when Monica isn’t invited to cousin Frannie’s wedding because she slept with her husband - but I assume she slept with him prior to Frannie getting together with him, so not really sure what the drama is.\n\nThe cookie episode had a few goofs like that.

Ross and Monica didn’t have much luck with cousins in season 7, that cousin and Denise Richards!\n\nI don’t know what to think of it tbh. Ross knew Monica had slept with Stuart, hence the “who you did” line. He must’ve recognised his face, but maybe not his name. I don’t know 🤷‍♀️😆\n\nYou’d think Monica would’ve found out the groom’s name before attending the wedding, especially since Monica cares about details.\n\n0"
