I thought I knew a lot about him, but in this piece I learned his mother is author Sandra Brown and he met his wife Victoria Arbiter, who‚Äôs the ‚Äúroyal contributor‚Äù for The Early Show on CBS, while on Guiding Light. Find the article in Soap Opera Digest and check out his author page. http://www.ryanbrownauthor.com\n\nIn the February 3, 1997 issue of People Jerry ver Dorn (Ross Marler) was quoted as saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thoroughly convinced that we could go back to 1937 , do this in front of black drapes and if the story is good enough, they‚Äôd still watch.

She has a few credits on IMDB.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1950756\n\nBeth Chamberlain (Beth Raines Spaulding #2) gave a quote out during Guiding Light‚Äôs 70th Anniversary year. It appeared in the January 22, 2007 issue of Television Week. She talked about her experience meeting fans during her book tour for Loreli‚Äôs Diary. ‚ÄúEverywhere I went, there would be three, four generations of women there, and the great-grandmother had gotten the grandmother into the show, who got the mother into it. When I got back from that, I had a completely different perspective about being part of Guiding Light. I‚Äôm not just a part of a TV show, I‚Äôm part of mother-daughter tradition.
