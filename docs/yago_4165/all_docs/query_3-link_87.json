But a producer found Fun World’s Ghostface mask in a house that Alfred Hitchcock once filmed in — and Craven immediately loved it.\n\nThe Stories Behind 5 Horror Movie Masks\n\nIn “You’re Next,” a family is attacked by three men wearing a lamb mask, a fox mask and a tiger mask. The screenwriter, Simon Barrett, said in an interview with IGN, “If the movie has a theme, it’s what people are hiding on the inside.”\n\nThe Stories Behind 5 Horror Movie Masks\n\nThe grotesque mask from the 2012 horror movie “Smiley” (left) recalls the smiley emoticon. It’s well-matched to the movie’s theme, about a killer who can be summoned via the internet to murder people."
