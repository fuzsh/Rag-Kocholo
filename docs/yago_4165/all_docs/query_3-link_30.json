However, the only known information is that it was intended to be a horror film.\n\nHistory\n\nNew Line Cinema planned to make an adaptation of the comic book character \"The mask\" and was intended to be scary and similar to the comics. So, it was planned as a horror version of which only some tests were done with Jim Carrey.\n\nWhy It Was Cancelled\n\nThe studio changed the style of the film when they saw that the horror version did not work with Jim Carrey.\n\nDirector Chuck Russell thought that the film would be too similar to the style of Freddy Krueger.\n\nResults\n\nA comedy version was released in 1994 and was a blockbuster hit.\n\nThe horror version was permanently cancelled."
