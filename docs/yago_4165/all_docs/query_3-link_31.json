        "text": "Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the most terrifying and memorable masks sported by cinematic killers, monsters, freaks, and psychos. Spoiler Alert! Which of these masks freaked you out the most? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n#30: The Baby Mask\n\n“Happy Death Day” (2017)\n\nA classic slasher meets “Groundhog Day” in “Happy Death Day,” which sees Tree Gelbman reliving the same day again and again and attempting to prevent her violent death. She’s done in by the Bayfield Babyface Killer, a mysterious murderer who dons, you guessed it, a baby mask. This mask is utterly horrifying, complete with a malicious grin accentuating the large, predatory eyes. The idea for this mask came from director Christopher Landon, who was expecting his first child during production. He told Newsweek that he may have been “subconsciously scared of becoming a father” and had the piece constructed by Tony Gardner, the same man who made the iconic Ghostface mask. More on that in a bit…\n\n#29: The Animal Masks\n\n“The Wicker Man” (1973)\n\nA classic bit of pagan horror, “The Wicker Man” contains one of the most iconic endings in horror history. Sergeant Neil Howie goes to a secluded island to find a missing girl named Rowan. However, he eventually learns that Rowan was used as bait and that he is being targeted as a human sacrifice to ensure a good harvest. During the climactic May Day celebration, the islanders are costumed in various garbs, including a number of creepy animal masks. These masks represent the best of pagan oddness, being scary in and of themselves while also representing the collective unity of the islanders against poor Howie.\n\n#28: The Jester\n\n“Slaughter High” (1986)\n\nA mostly forgotten slasher from the ‘80s, “Slaughter High” tells the story of a high school reunion gone horribly wrong. Ten years earlier, these students pranked a lonely outcast named Marty, and these pranks left Marty physically disfigured. Now the reunion is being ruined by a man in a jester mask, who is killing off the guests one by one. Ten points if you can guess who it is! The mask is wonderfully designed, mixing the traditional dangling sleeves with a wrinkled old man face. It’s a fun little addition to the horror-movie-mask pantheon, and it’s sure to disturb those who have a problem with clowns.\n\n#27: Cupid\n\n“Valentine” (2001)\n\nDespite being a little-known slasher, “Valentine” contains a big cast of notable names. Celebs like Denise Richards, Katherine Heigl, and David Boreanaz pop up here, and they are all stalked by a killer in a Cupid mask. Don’t expect the cute little flying baby here. Nope, this Cupid is much scarier, looking much like a porcelain doll with the kind of blank, emotionless eyes that befits the creepiest predators. The movie itself isn’t very good, but this Cupid mask has been etched into our memories since the early days of the new millennium.\n\n#26: The Mannequin Mask\n\n“Tourist Trap” (1979)\n\nThe slasher genre was in full swing by the late ‘70s, with timeless classics and cheap imitators released at the same time. This one swings more to the latter than the former, but it still has some redeeming qualities that make it worthwhile. One of them is the villain’s mask, which is basic in theory but terrifying in execution. It’s just a simple mannequin mask, with pale features, large black eyes, and an exposed mouth. Let’s be honest, this mask is pretty much just a ripoff of Michael Myers and Leatherface. But hey, if you’re going to copy something, you might as well copy the icons!\n\n#25: Satan\n\n“Satan’s Little Helper” (2004)\n\nA black comedy that satirizes the horror genre, “Satan’s Little Helper” is about a nine-year-old boy who unknowingly aids a serial killer in his atrocious crimes. For such a cheap little indie movie, “Satan’s Little Helper” contains a really killer mask… get it? It evokes an atmosphere of otherworldly horror and is full of fantastic detail that necessitates using the pause button. There are demonic red eyes, black horns, an enormous toothy smile, and even a little billy-goat’s beard that dangles below the chin. Take this to a Halloween party and watch the compliments come flooding in.\n\n#24: The Gas Mask\n\n“My Bloody Valentine” (1981)\n\nThere’s something inherently creepy about old-school gas masks. Maybe it’s the large, inhuman eyes that stare into your soul. Maybe it’s the circular structure where a mouth should be. Or maybe it’s the rubber hose that dangles from the face, looking much like an invasive alien appendage. It’s like gas masks were designed to be as unnerving as possible, and this movie utilizes that to a horrific degree. One of the greatest cult classics in horror, “My Bloody Valentine” is a small little Canadian film in which The Miner disposes of his victims with his signature gas mask and pickaxe. Sometimes it’s the simplest ideas that prove the most effective.\n\n#23: Blank Face\n\n“Blood and Black Lace” (1964)\n\nSpeaking of simple ideas, how about the mask design in “Blood and Black Lace”? It doesn’t get much simpler than, well, nothing. Mario Bava’s film was hugely influential, inspiring directors like Martin Scorsese and introducing many elements of the giallo subgenre - most notably its striking use of vibrant colors. In it, a masked murderer targets a series of models in an attempt to conceal a secret. The mask couldn’t be simpler, being nothing but a piece of blank material stretched over the killer’s face. This could have easily come across as cheap and silly, but Bava makes it work with some exceptional direction. It’s incredibly effective at preying on our instincts, as we desperately search for some kind of humanity that simply isn’t there.\n\n#22: The Phantom\n\n“Phantom of the Paradise” (1974)\n\nThis is a wickedly bizarre film, but that’s what you usually get with Brian De Palma. Sort of a “Rocky Horror”-esque blowout, “Phantom of the Paradise” is a rock opera-horror hybrid about a masked man who stalks a concert hall. “Phantom of the Paradise”... “Phantom of the Opera”... right? The disguise in this film is highly evocative of its ‘70s rock opera excess: it’s a large silver mask in the shape of an owl. Taking one look at this bad boy tells you all you need to know about the film, its bombast, and its penchant for not taking itself too seriously. It’s highly memorable, and yes, more than a little creepy.\n\n#21: Frankenstein Mask\n\n“The Funhouse” (1981)\n\nClassic horror filmmaker Tobe Hooper starts off our list with this carnival of terrors. The minimalist plot has a bunch of teenagers doing what they do best in '80s horror flicks: which involves lots of rowdy behavior, and ends up leading them to sneak into a carnival’s creepy funhouse to spend the night there. Clearly that’s a bad idea, and they end up witnessing the bizarre ride assistant murdering someone. Knowingly stuck with a masked murderer, the teens scramble to escape. There’s little explanation at first as to why this killer is walking around wearing a Halloween mask, but we soon find out there’s something more gruesome hiding underneath.\n\n#20: Owl Mask\n\n“Stage Fright” [aka “Deliria”] (1987)\n\nThis sadly under-seen and under-appreciated slasher film is mostly recognized today for the famous owl mask worn by the killer. The film takes place in a theater, where a group of actors have locked themselves in to rehearse a musical about a serial killer named the Night Owl. This unlucky group slowly realizes that locked inside with them is an actual recent psych-ward escapee… and an actual serial killer. As he wears the killer’s costume, which includes a huge, imposing owl’s head, he honors the play’s source material and goes on a killing rampage. Safe to say, there will be no opening night.\n\n#19: Surgical Mask\n\n“Eyes Without a Face” (1960)\n\nHorror movie masks aren’t merely a more modern trope, growing in popularity with the rise of slasher flicks in the late ‘70s. This film’s early use of a mask to convey terror harkens back to the aforementioned “Phantom of the Opera,” showing the audience a blank, expressionless face that’s hiding more sinister intentions. Our protagonist’s surgical mask may be hiding her deformed face from the world, but the evil intentions are her father’s, as he looks for victims whose faces he would surgically remove and give to his disfigured daughter. Having caused the car accident that disfigured his child, the insane father will go to any lengths to give her a new face.\n\n#18: Wax Mask\n\n“House of Wax” (2005)\n\nWhat seemed like another typical teen horror flick turned out to be a surprisingly entertaining romp about a group of teenagers trying to get to a football game. Through a series of events, they all end up in a deserted town whose main attraction, the House of Wax, has a sinister past and a disturbing secret. While the clueless teens try to figure out why the wax figures seem all too real, they are stalked by two brothers who have been running this twisted wax museum. Vincent hides his disfigured face with an expressionless wax mask as he kills the innocent victims, who are destined to be the future stars of his museum.\n\n#17: Animal Masks\n\n“You’re Next” (2011)\n\nTaking a cue from the classic “Wicker Man,” “You’re Next” takes innocent animal masks and transforms them into the stuff of nightmares. When a group of siblings and their partners visit their country home to celebrate their parents’ anniversary, the party is halted by a group of killers that seems to be stalking the family. Donning lamb, fox, and tiger masks, the killers are determined to use their arsenal of weapons to take out the family members one by one. Soon enough, however, the hunters in the animal masks become the hunted.\n\n#16: Sack Mask\n\n“The Orphanage” (2007)\n\nAs a general rule, every parent should be wary of their children befriending invisible kids… especially if he says they’re wearing sacks over their heads. This is what happens when Laura decides to move her family into the now-defunct and incredibly creepy orphanage she grew up in. Her adopted son Simón befriends the ghostly Tomás, and it’s all fun and games until Simón goes missing. A plot involving a previous worker of the orphanage and the morbid history of the building unfolds in tragic waves, but ghostly little Tomás and his sack mask remain the tortured centerpiece of this horror drama.\n\n#15: Green Mask\n\n“Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon” (2006)\n\nWhile there have been horror-comedies in the past, “Behind the Mask” succeeds in creating something utterly unique and mesmerizing. The main subject of the film being what truly lies behind a killer’s mask, this mockumentary shows us the daily life and intense preparation required to be a masked slasher killer. How do you create fear with a mask and carefully-timed power outages? Although the movie satirizes the lifestyle of a lonely copycat wanting to emulate his masked heroes such as Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers, Leslie Vernon ends up creating a believable and terrifying persona, and equally disturbing and emotionless mask.\n\n#14: Grinning Masks\n\n“The Purge” (2013)\n\nWith a plot that resembles a political thriller, the filmmakers took the backstory of a future America whose government has approved an annual Purge, and transformed it into a home-invasion survival horror film. The Purge allows all crime to be legal, including murder, for one night only. Although wealthier households have added the ultimate in security to keep Purge-supporters at bay, the Sandin family nevertheless becomes targets. Their attackers cannot be prosecuted during the purge, and therefore do not need to hide their faces. This makes their grinning masks more terrifying, as they are simply used for theatricality and pure intimidation.\n\n#13: Sam’s Mask\n\n“Trick ‘r Treat” (2007)\n\nThe movie that revitalized the horror anthology, 2007’s “Trick ‘r Treat” offers a fresh variety of ghoulish stories featuring everything horror can offer, from monsters to killers to Halloween goodness. The most memorable aspect of this cult hit – and the only thread that ties all stories together – is the mysterious little trick-or-treater, Sam. Is little Sam an ordinary kid looking for candy on Halloween? Wearing a now-iconic burlap sack and armed with a deadly lollipop, each subsequent story reveals more and more of the evil that is hiding behind those button eyes. Halloween-haters: beware.\n\n#12: Doll Masks\n\n“The Strangers” (2008)\n\nHome-invasion films, along the lines of classic stalk-and-slash horror flicks, are a dime a dozen, and most seem to feature some kind of scary mask. What will make a killer’s mask scarier and a cut above the rest? Those four ominous words: “Inspired by true events.” With an incredibly simple plot ripped from the news headlines, a young couple comes back to their secluded vacation home, only to soon realize they are not alone. Offering up more tension than gore, this thriller introduces the world to the pin-up doll strangers and their bag-headed leader, who will easily be entering everyone’s nightmares for a long time to come.\n\n#11: Button Mask\n\n“Nightbreed” (1990)\n\nIn this Clive Barker film, you see subterranean monsters, disfigured humanoids, and undead creatures. However, this masked serial killer may just take the cake from all of them. While this movie may have flown under the radar as a cult classic, the button mask worn by its villain, Dr. Decker, is clearly the star of the show. Both the button eyes and zipper mouth really up the creep factor – which is saying something, as he’s already a knife-wielding murderer. Crazy? No, he’s death – plain and simple.\n\n#10: The Phantom\n\n“The Phantom of the Opera” (1925)\n\nSo we’ve done “Phantom of the Paradise,” and now it’s time for its obvious influence. There have been many iterations of “The Phantom of the Opera” throughout the years, each with its own unique design. Everyone knows the famous half-mask from the Broadway play and Joel Schumacher’s 2004 film, (xref) but for this entry, we’re going all the way back to 1925. Lon Chaney stars as the titular Phantom, who hides behind a simple disguise resembling a human face. It’s such a simple design but incredibly eerie owing to its inexpressive stare. But however eerie the mask is, it’s nothing compared to his real face!\n\n#9: Pig Mask\n\n“Saw” franchise (2004-)\n\nPigs don’t generally inspire fear, but combine a somewhat unsettling representation of a swine’s head with brutal deaths, and gut-wrenching horror is bound to follow. Worn by Jigsaw and his accomplices to hide their identities, and also representing the zodiac year in which the killer began his reign of terror, this gruesome disguise dials up the dread in an already-horrifying scenario. Regardless of which one of his notorious games Jigsaw has you playing, seeing the pig mask is pretty much a sign that you’re screwed.\n\n#8: Mrs. Tredoni Mask\n\n“Alice, Sweet Alice” (1976)\n\nAlready an unnerving film to watch, this film’s creepy overall tone is heightened further by the appearance of a clear mask with a horrible makeup job. Not only that, but when paired with a violent yellow raincoat – well, to call it unsettling would be an understatement. In the hands of a child, it’s kind of eerie – maybe even a little disturbing. But on the face of a killer, that ghastly eye shadow and sinister permanent smile is the stuff of night terrors.\n\n#7: The Hag\n\n“Curtains” (1983)\n\nAuditioning for a movie role is terrifying enough. But when you add a murderer to the mix, things become slightly more intimidating, to say the least. Coming from this Canadian ‘80s slasher flick, “The Hag” mask is nothing short of terror-inducing; with its deep, hollow eyes, and frown of murderous intent spelling trouble before the killer wearing it can even strike at you. A sickle, a few rival actresses, and lethal determination bring new meaning to the phrase “fierce competition.” Perhaps showbusiness isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.\n\n#6: Another Babyface Killer\n\n“The Hills Run Red” (2009)\n\nWhile this mask might be a fairly recent addition to the horror genre, it certainly doesn’t skimp on the scare factor. It might be the shattered human jaw combined with the cracked, porcelain cheeks. Or the creepy baby-doll face. Or the fact that it’s held together with barbed wire. Or it might just be because there’s a vicious murderer behind the mask. Or more likely, a combination of all of those things. Whatever the case, this is definitely the film’s main freak-out, and it’s truly the stuff nightmares are made of.\n\n#5: Hannibal Lecter\n\n“The Silence of the Lambs” (1991)\n\nThe fact that this otherwise seemingly cool, calm and collected middle-aged gentleman has to be restrained with a straightjacket and muzzle says it all. Seething with cannibalistic intent and the curious appetite of a thousand stoners, Hannibal the Cannibal’s mask serves as a constant reminder that he can straight up kill you whenever he wants. And eat your organs with a complimentary beverage. So if your occupation happens to be a census taker, you’d best stay away from him if you don’t want to become his dinner.\n\n#4: Ghostface\n\n“Scream” franchise (1996-)\n\nAlthough this entry comes from a franchise that’s essentially a satire of horror film tropes, the Ghostface mask seems like it was designed to inspire the perfectly crafted scare. The gaping eye holes, the contorted mouth, the white-on-black coloring – it’s not a mask you want to see showing up in your dreams, or at your door. Or in any context, really. Despite originating from a campy, but clever film, the Ghostface mask has become synonymous with sharp scares and even sharper knives.\n\n#3: Leatherface\n\n“Texas Chainsaw Massacre” franchise (1974-)\n\nAs a general rule, cannibals tend to be a little off-putting – to say the least. A cannibal wearing a mask made of human faces and carrying a huge chainsaw is probably as bad as it gets. However, it’s this mask, made from the skin of his victims, that truly drives home the absolute bone-chilling fright of Leatherface. Of course, the chainsaw and his massive size pretty much mean instant death. So next time you and your friends go on a road trip, drive right back around the moment you see a man wearing this truly terrifying mask – or hear a loud buzzing noise.\n\n#2: Michael Myers\n\n“Halloween” franchise (1978-)\n\nWho knew that a Captain Kirk mask could haunt the dreams of children, and most adults, for generations? Armed with a chef’s knife and almost supernatural killing abilities (and an almost supernatural ability to cheat death), Michael Myers is the killer that keeps on killing – and murder has been his bread and butter for four decades and counting. His super creepy mask, complete with matted hair and hollow eyes, delivers the kind of terror that makes you need a nightlight… as if that would really make much difference.\n\n#1: Jason\n\n“Friday the 13th” franchise (1980-)\n\nThe third installment of the “Friday the 13th” film franchise forever changed the way we view sports equipment – and more specifically, hockey goalies. Jason Voorhees dons his trademark mask for the first time in this film, and thus, nightmares were born. The relative harmlessness behind a hockey mask is quickly washed away and replaced with homicidal bloodlust, as Jason kills teenager after horny teenager – all while sporting a mask he snagged from one of his victims. It’s an iconic horror mask that brings to mind menace, murder and machetes."
