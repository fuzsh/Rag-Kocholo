        "text": "(Photo by Weinstein Company/Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe Best French Horror Movies\n\nFrance has had a long history with horror that dates back to 1896, when Georges Meilies directed the original horror movie, The Haunted Castle. It had bats, and spooky skeletons! Jean Epstein’s The Fall of the House of Usher is one of the early horror masterpieces from the 1920s. And in the 1950s, France produced two of what many consider the greatest horror movies ever: Diabolique and Eyes Without a Face. Not to be outdone by the past, the aughts-bred New French Extremity movement set the new standard in brutality with the likes of Martyrs and Inside, continuing into Julia Ducournau’s 2016 Raw.\n\nBest Spanish-Language Horror Movies | Best Korean Horror Movies | Best Italian Horror Movies\n\n2020’s Best Horror Movies | 200 Best Horror Movies Ever\n\n#1\n\nEyes Without a Face (1960) 97%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 104603%\n\nCritics Consensus: A horrific tale of guilt and obsession, Eyes Without a Face is just as chilling and poetic today as it was when it was first released.\n\nSynopsis: Dr. Génessier (Pierre Brasseur) is riddled with guilt after an accident that he caused disfigures the face of his daughter,...
