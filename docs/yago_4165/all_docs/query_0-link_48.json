( ¿Quién puede matar a un niño? , Narciso Ibáñez Serrador, 1976). While masks have long been an iconographic staple of horror cinema, Makinov took this generic fascination to its logical extreme: not only did he promote the film wearing a crude red sack mask with eyeholes cut out, but the cast and crew of Come Out and Play allegedly never saw his face during the production itself. ¹ In a video introduction to a 2012 Toronto International Film Fest screening of Come Out and Play, Makinov said ‘I wear my mask because through anonymity I can be all I want. As a beloved writer says, I believe in my mask, the man I made up is me. I believe in my dance and my destiny.’ ² Through this reference to Sam Shepard’s The Tooth of Crime (1972), this horror film-maker made clear his belief that there is a meaningful connection between power, creativity and identity. Whether a publicity stunt or a material manifestation of his aesthetic philosophy, this is a memorable instance of the potency of horror film masks being deployed beyond the fictional constraints of cinema to make a statement.\n\nAs a horror film-maker, Makinov’s mask consciously evokes a long history. Masks are closely linked to the horror legacies of icons like Lon Chaney Sr. and Vincent Price and in slasher franchises like Friday the 13th (1980–2009) and Halloween (1978–2018). When used diegetically, horror film masks imply associations with broader notions of identity and there are complexities embedded in how they are both deployed and are understood over time: their symbolic potency as objects linked to ritual, power and transformation has evolved over history. The conceptual force of horror film masks stems from both its generic ubiquity and simultaneous status as a cross-cultural associated with a complex range of historically defined meanings and values. These meanings and values are constantly evolving in horror to reflect new cultural and ideological contexts, rendering masks a persistent and important element of the genre’s iconography. There is a crucial tension at play across the history of horror film masks between variation and consistency: while the mask is itself an enduring element of the genre, the meanings and values attached to it are demonstrably dynamic and adaptable.\n\nFrom the outset, it must be stated that horror masks are not specific to only feature-length horror films, and horror narratives and media experiences across television and videogames are themselves worthy of future discussion and exploration, spanning as they do from a long literary history where masks and horror intersect (that will be discussed elsewhere in this book). The focus here, however, is specifically on horror feature films as they have a much longer history as a screen phenomenon that privileges masks. It thus can inform future examinations of other media, be it in terms of how it overlaps or – just as significantly – how it deviates. Horror film masks are a continuation of a multifaceted historical trajectory, their transformative potential continuing ritualistic and myth-making processes linked both to power, ideology and identity (as seen across myriad cultures with a recorded history of privileging this object) and also to genre itself. Horror film masks provoke associations with disguise and anonymity with a predominantly narrative purpose: to obscure – then possibly expose – the identity of a killer. Yet this reduces the utility of horror film masks to purely one of revelation and occlusion. While not untrue, often in horror movies we know the identity of the mask wearer: there is, for instance, no mystery about the Halloween franchise’s slasher killer Michael Myers or that of the Friday the 13th films, Jason Voorhees. To conceive horror film masks solely as anonymity-creating devices undermines the power of the objects themselves. Even in their earliest, supposedly ‘primitive’ usages, masks were often bestowed with great power in terms of spiritual belief across a range of religious practices. This power is linked closely to masks as transformative devices.\n\nFocusing on the intersection of ritual (be it secular or religious), power and transformation, we can see that horror cinema is a durable forum for the enduring potency of the mask’s broader symbolic power to be constantly re-explored, re-imagined and re-invented, continuing key aspects of its cross-cultural and ritual significance that existed long before moving image culture. While there have been numerous critical examinations of horror film masks in specific movies, franchises, national and subgeneric contexts, there remains a broad absence of any substantial critical research dedicated to horror film masks and how they intersect with cultural histories of masks more broadly. We can employ this past research to assist building the foundations of a focused, critical analysis of horror film masks, synthesising and expanding upon these scattered treatments to map a cultural history of horror film masks, focusing specifically on ritual, power and transformation.\n\nChapter 1 expands on this notion of the shamanic imagination, examining how it plays out in cinema more broadly and how it intersects with traditions surrounding the trickster figure. Rather than attempting to draw a direct (and, as I soon illustrate, ideologically dubious) line between the history of traditionally conceived shamanism with horror film masks, we can more productively opt for a more elastic understanding of this relationship. The shamanic imagination is a cultural sensibility which pertains to how we broadly comprehend the potency of the mask (in horror cinema and elsewhere) beyond any specific anthropological definition or application of shamanism in the more orthodox sense. Rather, the shamanic imagination consists of residual traces of what shamanism ‘means’ in the broader popular consciousness, manifesting in contemporary horror cinema through a diverse range of rituals, be they explicitly religious or spiritual, or more secular phenomena like birthday parties, family meals or the act of cinema-going itself. The shamanic imagination allows us to think through movement across liminal spaces, linked historically to masks and the supernatural and the closely related figure of the trickster. These are all useful when considering the endurance of masks as a potent cross-cultural iconographic feature of horror cinema.\n\nPart One explores the history of horror film masks as they move increasingly towards codification as a key aspect of the genre’s iconographic palate from 1970 onwards. Chapter 2 examines masks in Japanese Noh theatre, the Italian commedia dell’arte, in the literary gothic and the work of H. P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, and in French theatre in relation to the Grand Guignol and Antonin Artaud’s Theatre of Cruelty. Across these we can identify a continuum of sorts through the mask and horror that underscore its affinity for subversion in a manner consistent with Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of the carnivalesque. This chapter ends considering the intersection of masks and horror in early cinema, moving towards chapter 3 where this loose historical overview continues. Here we explore screen adaptations of Gaston Leroux’s novel The Phantom of the Opera (1909), the Old Dark House tradition, Universal monster films and cross-generic manifestations through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and specific figures linked to masked horror performances such as Vincent Price, Lon Chaney Sr., William Castle and Peter Lorre. We then examine the internationalisation of horror and the rise of masks as a staple of horror iconography in Eyes without a Face (Georges Franju, 1960) from France, the El Santo films from Mexico, Mario Bava’s Black Sunday (1960) with Barbara Steele from Italy and Onibaba (Kaneto Shindô, 1964) from Japan.\n\nPart Two focuses on horror mask typologies across four case-study chapters that intersect with ritual, power and transformation in horror films made almost solely after 1970: skin masks, blank masks, animal masks and repurposed masks. Beyond ubiquitous Halloween costume masks (skulls, witches, monsters) whose deployment in horror cinema is tied to their explicit association with that festival, these categories allow a range of examples to be considered that underscore Steve Neale’s claim that the longevity of film genres hinge on the interplay of ‘repetition … difference, variation and change’.³ Chapter 4 examines skin masks in horror and how they relate in specific instances to a number of rituals and power dynamics, including religion in The Abominable Dr. Phibes (Robert Fuest, 1971) and Alice Sweet Alice (Albert Sole, 1976), feminine identity in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974) and Curtains (Richard Ciupka, 1983), and class in Happy Birthday to Me (J. Lee Thompson, 1981) and Smiley (Michael Gallagher, 2012). Chapter 5 investigates blank masks in horror in relation to repetition across the Halloween franchise and its remakes, to notions of place in Gurozuka (Yoichi Noshiyama, 2005) and Celia (Ann Turner, 1988), and to masculine identity in Bruiser (George A. Romero, 2000) and Hush (Mike Flanagan, 2016). Chapter 6 explores animal masks in horror and totemism in Motel Hell (Kevin Connor, 1980) and Bloody Reunion (Seuseung-ui eunhye, Dae-wung Lim, 2006), mythology in Stagefright (Michele Soavi, 1987) and The Conspiracy (Christopher MacBride, 2012), and note diverse yet simultaneously overlapping spirit of ambivalence to animal masks in Jean Rollin’s The Nude Vampire (La Vampire Nue, 1970) and You’re Next (Adam Wingard, 2011). Chapter 7 considers repurposed masks (intended for one use but deployed in horror in another way) and untrained labour in My Bloody Valentine (George Mihalka, 1981) and Evidence (2013) by director Olatunde Osunsanmi, in relation to social play Friday the 13th Part III (Steve Miner, 1982) and Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman (Kuchisake-onna, Kōji Shiraishi, 2007) and professional labour (in this case, medicine) in Dead Ringers (David Cronenberg, 1988) and Anatomy (Anatomie, Stefan Ruzowitzky, 2000).\n\nWhile Part Three continues this focus on how horror movie masks, ritual and transformation intersect, it does so by turning an eye simultaneously towards the future and the past by considering the role of technological masks and temporality itself by looking at two pre-1970 horror films that employ the object specifically to ‘move’ through time, Peeping Tom (Michael Powell, 1960) and The Mask (Julian Roffman, 1961). It also considers the relationships between technological masks, ritual and consumerism in Halloween III: Season of the Witch (Tommy Lee Wallace, 1982) and The Den (Zachary Donohue, 2013) and the broader notion of performance in the Swedish television movie Månguden (Jonas Cornell, 1988) and The Poughkeepsie Tapes (John Erick Dowdle, 2007). While many of these films might feel distinctly more contemporary in their subgeneric categories and focus on current advances in technology, we can see how technology itself is fundamental to the transformative capacity of masks in horror film. Exploring films made by directors from around the world, through both their differences and similarities they collectively demonstrate the endurance of the object as a key aspect of the genre’s iconography. In doing so, we can therefore answer the question at the core of this book: why are masks such a persistent motif in horror cinema?\n\nWhy Masks? Ritual, Power and Transformation\n\nAmongst other things, masks are tools of transformation. As objects that facilitate disguise, they encompass dual strategies of revelation and obscuration. This tethers masks to ritual traditions, of which cinema more broadly has a long history: Eric Michael Mazur noted that across film history ‘rituals mark transformations’, from Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977) to My Fair Lady (George Cukor, 1964).⁴ The scale and significance of this transformative potential, however, cannot be undervalued and as Walter Sorell stated, the belief that masks can transform their wearers – literally or symbolically – is an essential and broadly cross-cultural feature of human civilisation.⁵ The transformative capacity of masks is also aligned with heftier questions about being and death and rituals often connected to spiritual and/or religious belief. For N. Ross Crumrine, ‘through the dramatization of the generation, communication, transmission and transformation of power, often in relation to the problem of death and the life-death opposition, the mask radiates its own power or transmits power to the masker and or the audience’.⁶ This aspect often plays out in horror films in the dynamics between a masked killer and their intended victim. Despite its potential complexity, there are few objects more ubiquitous yet critically underexplored in horror studies. Masks are used in diverse, complex ways that often contain broader socio-political dimensions and are part of a visual language whose transformative capacities are linked in a range of ways to power and ritual.\n\nFraming Horror Masks\n\nNumerous writers have considered the etymology of the word ‘mask’. Elizabeth Tonkin noted that the English word ‘person’ has its origins in the Latin term for mask, ‘persona’.⁷ John W. Nunley and Cara McCarty also traced its linguistic origins to the Arabic maskhara (to transform or falsify), while in Ancient Egypt the word msk referred to leather as a ‘second skin’.⁸ As Laura Makarius noted, subjects of the Rorschach test commonly identify inkblots as masks, prompting Gaston Bachelard to suggest human masks are an integral aspect of a collective human psyche, echoing Carl Jung (discussed in chapter 1).⁹ ‘Mask’ is both a verb and noun: as the former, it pertains to what Crumrine identified ‘as the ritual transformation of the human actor into a being of another order’.¹⁰ As a noun, John Mack suggested that masks refer to a singular, specific object, while for Nunley and McCarty, it is an object which covers the head to conceal the face.¹¹ But it can also imply any aspect of disguise or concealment, often with an element of pretence or deception.¹²\n\nYet such definitions elide the complexity of their functionality. As W. Anthony Sheppard suggested, the symbolic nature of masks is linked to a neutral duplicitousness: they ‘are fundamentally double in function, signification and experience, serving simultaneously as tools for disguise and as markers of identity’.¹³ Masks can be disguises, but even this is not a simple process of obscuring identity: its presence implies a potential unmasking, a moment of revelation. As we explore from chapter 2 onwards, from contemporary horror films back to early examples, masking often activates the power imbued within the object itself. Likewise, there is a process of deactivation when the mask is removed: in the context of horror, the unmasking of a killer is often (but again, not always) implied to neutralise the power it is implied the mask has granted them. In Suspension (Jeffery Scott Lando, 2015), the opening scene shows a young woman in a half-face mask tormenting a man she accuses of being a serial killer. He escapes and before he kills her he removes her mask and places it over his own face. This shift in their power dynamic is defined through the forced exchange of the mask and acts of masking and unmasking are intrinsic to the transformative power associated with the object.\n\nIn horror cinema, the presence of a masked villain implies the possibility that their identity will be revealed. This is typical of the Scooby Doo scenario: a supposedly all-powerful supernatural monster is exposed as a mere human menace, the act of unmasking removing their power. But in horror, it is often not simply a case of disguising identity as it is disguising certain personality aspects. In horror cinema, the act of masking often allows its wearers to behave in ways they would not otherwise be able to and unmasking can punctuate a return to the status quo. Recalling carnivalesque traditions, masking grants horror antagonists the ability to behave in otherwise unacceptable ways: for Nunley and McCarty, ‘the power of anonymity gives us the protection to behave in ways we otherwise might not, to act aggressively or to break rules’.¹⁴ Bakhtin’s notion of the carnivalesque will be discussed further shortly.\n\nYet this is certainly not applicable to all horror movies. As noted, in the case of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, we know their identities – the faces underneath their masks are subjects of curiosity, but not linked to a revelation of their literal identities. In these instances, masks contain the thrilling possibility of unleashing what lies beneath; even if the wearer’s identity is known, masks are understood as obscuring something crucial about the type of person who could commit the acts of violence typical of slasher films. Masks transform Jason and Michael from humans into something more powerful, simultaneously concealing something we do not know, while providing an outlet for something to be discovered or strengthened through the mask’s transformative capacity and its relation to ritual and power. This echoes Rose Butler’s observation that ‘We are not just able to project our own fears onto slasher killers because their faces are hidden. The masks used to hide their features can tell us everything about them: their traumas and motives.’¹⁵ Similarly, as John Schechter observed, in theatrical history ‘the mask hides and reveals at the same time’.¹⁶ This paradox is crucial to the potency of horror film masks.\n\nMack identified a series of motives for masking from an anthropological perspective, which is useful when considering horror film masks as part of a broader historical tradition of mask-wearing linked to ritual, power and transformation. As Mack noted, they can be found in traditional cultures as part of ceremonies surrounding birth and death:¹⁷ from the surreal surgical masks in the birth flashbacks in Sergio Martino’s All the Colors of the Dark (1972) to the iconic facial covering of Leatherface in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (discussed in chapter 4), there are many instances of this in horror cinema. Masks can be found in rituals and ceremonies concerning the shift from childhood to adulthood,¹⁸ a tradition brought to the screen in the mud-masks of the seven demon worshipping brothers’ intent on impregnating their sister at the onset of menarche in The Johnsons (De Johnsons, Rudolf van den Berg, 1992). For Mack, masks traditionally mark other significant life changes, again often demonstrated in horror cinema: for instance, shifts in social ranking of an upwardly mobile nature are often formalised through masked rituals, celebrations or performances.¹⁹ Although not technically a horror film, Stanley Kubrick’s 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut is a dark fantasy that echoes this history. Alternatively, masks were traditionally employed in judicial and legal rituals, recalling the animal mask-wearing jury in Vernon Serwell’s 1968 film Curse of the Crimson Altar (animal masks in horror are explored in chapter 6). In agricultural cultures, Mack noted that masks were employed during rituals marking seasonal changes, recalling The Wicker Man (Robin Hardy, 1973).²⁰ The relationship between masks and ritual practice is crucial when considering the enduring presence of the former in horror cinema.\n\nMasks and Rituals\n\nThe meanings and functions of masks are diverse. They can have practical safety functions in some contexts, while maintaining near-mystical symbolic force in others. As explored in chapter 7, in practical terms mask-wearing is a ubiquitous part of everyday life for surgeons, welders, divers, fencers, hockey players and others, and a wardrobe staple for wrestlers, stage and carnival performers, masquerade ball attendees and children dressing-up for birthday parties or Halloween.²¹ As Victor Turner argued, across a range of cultures these latter events in particular require specific customs related to dress, food, song and dance, the decoration or presentation of the event itself, and of course dress including (but not limited to) masks themselves.²² Ritual practices are diverse and can take a variety of forms.\n\nRitual is a key concept here and therefore worth clarifying further. Mask-wearing has documented associations with ritual practices. Ronald L. Grimes identified mask-making as a ‘ritual gesture’,²³ a definition that privileges the embodied nature of mask-wearing: the object is an extension of the wearer’s body and a tool for somatic, non-lingual communication. For Richard Schechner, whether ‘performance’ is conceived in the context of sport, music, theatre or day-to-day living, it fundamentally contains gestures that have a ritualised quality.²⁴ Horror film from this perspective therefore is conceived as a forum where precisely this kind of mask-centric, ritualistic action takes place.\n\nPerformance and ritual have a long, overlapping history. While Schechner challenged assumptions that the performing arts grew directly out of ritual, he conceded that even from very early on there was an overlap between the entertainment aspects of performance and its ritual qualities.²⁵ Thus, even film star personae can be understood as masks of sorts,²⁶ while for Paul Coates, the screen is a mask-like membrane between the faces that are filmed and those who are watching those faces across a range of exhibition and reception contexts.²⁷ Ritual therefore manifests in film in diverse ways and has been approached by numerous critics in relation to horror cinema.²⁸\n\nThis link between ritual and performance is demonstrated in Lee Strasberg’s American method acting, which Michael L. Quinn argued is intrinsically ritualistic in nature, particularly concerning the influence of Polish director and theorist Jerzy Grotowski.²⁹ These ritual aspects of method acting combine with horror masks in the German horror film Masks (Andreas Marschall, 2011), a homage to Dario Argento’s Suspiria (1977), that follows actor Stella (Susen Ermich) who is granted a place at Berlin’s Matteusz Gdula Institute. Stella endures an intense study regime reliant upon method-like masked performance techniques that dehumanise students and indoctrinate them into a death cult. In Masks, the surrendering of identity through masked performance rituals that recall method acting techniques are a source of horror.\n\nEven attending the cinema can be considered a contemporary ritual.³⁰ Michael Richardson observed that the surrealists understood cinema-going itself as a kind of ancient ritual where contemporary dramas could be played out, while Maruša Pušnik noted that from its earliest days cinema-going itself had a whole spectrum of ritualised aspects to it.³¹ James B. Twitchell famously claimed that horror films themselves are rituals governed by strictly coded formulae pertaining to social norms with an almost didactic intent to deliver to its teen audience, drawing parallels to the social learning aspects of traditional fairy tales (especially when it comes to sexuality).³² Although clearly reductive,³³ at the very least Twitchell’s identification of horror film spectatorship as ritual in general terms is noteworthy.\n\nVera Dika much more successfully saw a connection between horror and ritual in her observation that the return of the killer in stalker or slasher films is frequently associated with the memorialising of an event that triggers the murderer’s action.³⁴ These are often linked to almost always secular social and cultural ritual events,³⁵ evident in film titles alone: Black Christmas (Bob Clark, 1974), Halloween (John Carpenter, 1978), Graduation Day (Herb Freed, 1981), April Fool’s Day (Fred Walton, 1986) and Happy Birthday to Me and My Bloody Valentine (the latter two are discussed at length later in this book). Essential to Dika’s and Twitchell’s observations is the central role of ritual, supported by a whole array of other horror movies themselves. An obvious case is Lamberto Bava’s Demons (1985), which uses masks to explore the ritual act of cinema-going. Set in a cinema, film-goers see a masked figure on display in the foyer who later appears in the horror film they all watch that bleeds into their own reality. In Demons, the mask is a contagion, turning those affected into its eponymous monsters. Mask-wearing and cinema-going rituals collide with spectacular, visceral results."
