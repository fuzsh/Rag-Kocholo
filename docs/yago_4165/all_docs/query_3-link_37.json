        "text": "[Narrator] These other worldly masks and monsters,\n\nalong with thousands and thousands of others,\n\nwere made by this man,\n\na master of monster masks\n\nand creator of countless creatures you know.\n\nSeriously, look at his IMDB.\n\n[eerie, upbeat music]\n\nYou'll notice it looks a little big.\n\nWelcome to my studio.\n\nThis is where I do my job\n\nof designing creatures for movies and television\n\nand video games.\n\n[Interviewer] Alright, can you draw something\n\non the fly for us?\n\nI probably could. Yeah.\n\n[Interviewer] Alright, draw something aquatic,\n\nancient, and a hunter.\n\n[soft music]\n\nI would say that the first step\n\nis just start laying down geometric shapes\n\nand the large forms\n\nto try to get the look you're after.\n\nSome gills.\n\nWhat I like to do is sketch it out\n\nand then get more definition.\n\nThere're pencils and then there're inks.\n\nSo the pencils establish the rough layout,\n\nand then inking is where you really define\n\nthe specificity of your look.\n\nI don't know if this necessarily captures\n\nexactly what was described.\n\nIt's a fish man.\n\nI don't know if it gets across hunter.\n\nIt certainly looks mean.\n\n[Interviewer] And what's his name?\n\nI don't know, he looks like a Dave to me.\n\nDave's kind of a jerk.\n\nHe's not really a monster, but he's a monster of a person.\n\n[soft, upbeat music]\n\nI think monsters represent a powerful being,\n\nbut it's something that is concrete\n\nand can be dealt with very directly.\n\nDavid slays Goliath.\n\nKing Kong falls off a very tall building.\n\nThese dangerous bad things\n\ncan just be dealt with, and they're gone, and it's over.\n\nAnd that's kind of a fantasy because\n\nrooting out evil in real life is much more complex\n\nand much more difficult than that.\n\n[soft, upbeat music]\n\n[Narrator] Putting down his pencil and pen,\n\nJordu picks up a new set of tools\n\nto sculpt, mold, and paint his designs\n\nfrom the page into a three dimensional mask.\n\nIn order to start the sculpting process,\n\nI take water based clay\n\nand I just start building up a face shape.\n\nAnd I'm just gonna do this outta my imagination\n\nfor expediency sake.\n\nI'm just sort of establishing some unusual features\n\nand, to be honest, I don't exactly know where it's gonna go.\n\nYou know, as a matter of fact,\n\nit might change a great deal as I go.\n\nI use an enormous amount of clay.\n\nEvery month, I probably order several hundred pounds.\n\n[soft, eerie music]\n\nOne of the things about creating\n\nis that you do get into kind of a zen mode.\n\nTime goes by,\n\nand you don't even realize how much time is passing.\n\nThe act of creating is so pleasurable.\n\nI mean, it's addicting.\n\nIt really is.\n\nSo I'm putting eye forms in which are just spheres,\n\nplastic spheres that establish the shape of the eyeball\n\nthat once we mold it, will make a nice clean shape in there\n\nbecause the plaster will\n\nrecord the nice clean shape of the sphere.\n\nBut what we're always going for is\n\nwhat is going to bring us the most character?\n\nWhat is going to affect the viewer the most?\n\nIf it's adding teeth, it's adding teeth.\n\nIf it's giving the eyes a more sinister feel,\n\nif it's scrapping it and starting over,\n\nthe whole point is to\n\nbring out the most and the best character you can.\n\nSo it's not necessarily going to look exactly like this,\n\nbut almost all of this is just by way of establishing\n\nthe kind of feel I want.\n\nI know I want these horns to be full of intricate detail.\n\nI've added these sort of braided looks to them,\n\nand, eventually, I want them to kind of feel\n\nalmost like tree branches or gnarled roots.\n\nSo everything I've done is very deliberate\n\nin the sense that it takes my character\n\nto where I think it should go.\n\n[Narrator] Jordu's love of monsters\n\nhas been a central part of his imagination\n\nsince his childhood.\n\nI grew up in the 1970s and the early 80s,\n\nand latex masks\n\nwere becoming, actually, a very competitive art form.\n\nI wanted to know how these things were made\n\nfrom a very early age.\n\nSo when I was 14 or so,\n\nI started trying to figure out how to make latex masks\n\non my own.\n\nI got little snippets of information\n\nfrom magazines like Fangoria and Cinemagic,\n\nand I started to kind of get a general idea.\n\nThe first really professional mask I ever did\n\nwas a very simple demon mask that I did when I was about 17.\n\nIt had a slick finish to it\n\nthat I just hadn't achieved before.\n\nEventually, I got offers\n\nfrom mask companies throughout the United States\n\nto come work for them.\n\nThe first film I worked on\n\nwas a piece of [beep] called The Bride of Re-Animator.\n\nIt's the sequel to The Re-Animator,\n\nwhich is a kind of fun movie,\n\nbut the Bride of Re-Animator is terrible.\n\n[Narrator] But no matter the movie, he loves making masks.\n\n[soft, upbeat music]\n\nAfter a multi-day process\n\nof layering plaster onto a sculpture\n\nand pouring latex into a plaster mold,\n\na final shape of a mask is produced.\n\nSo now we're at the beginning of the painting process.\n\nAnd we've got our blank latex piece here,\n\nand I mixed up a base color in acrylic paint,\n\nand I'm just gonna start by brushing it on\n\nwith a big chip brush just like this.\n\nThe colors you use and the base colors you choose\n\ncan be anything under the sun.\n\nIt all depends on the effect you want it to have on viewers.\n\nI want people to feel like this is sort of a whimsical,\n\nalmost H.R. Pufnstuf kind of character, so.\n\nFor you young kids,\n\nthat was a show on TV like, 50 years ago.\n\nThen the next step I often do is spattering.\n\nSo I take a very thinned down acrylic ink,\n\na cut down chip brush,\n\nand I start spattering the color on it.\n\nThe point of the spattering\n\nis to make the skin more convincing\n\nbecause skin of almost any kind isn't just one flat color,\n\nand this helps to kind of simulate that appearance.\n\nIt's really just a matter of what I think is going to work.\n\nAnd I've painted so many things\n\nthat it becomes sort of second nature.\n\nYou know what's going to work and what isn't going to work.\n\n[soft, upbeat music]\n\n[airbrush hissing]\n\nNow, I'm using an airbrush,\n\nwhich is to a spray paint can\n\nwhat a baseball bat is to a toothpick.\n\nIt can do extremely fine mists of paint.\n\nIn fact, this particular airbrush\n\ncan get down to a hair's width.\n\nPainting realistic characters\n\nmeans layers and layers of color\n\nand blending them as artfully as you can\n\nand that's how you will result in good looking art.\n\n[Narrator] After painting in the eye details,\n\nJordu applies his own epoxy mixture\n\nto create a natural wet look for the eyes and nose\n\nas a final touch.\n\nSo this is what a finished mask looks like.\n\nIt's got the epoxy on the eyes and the mouth and the nose.\n\nThe paint job is finished.\n\nYou could always take it further with hair work\n\nor more intricate painting if you chose.\n\nBut for now, this is essentially how I do a mask.\n\n[Narrator] This is just one example of a finished mask.\n\nJordu could add infinite details to make each mask unique.\n\nSo this is one of my masks.\n\nThis one is meant to feel considerably more realistic.\n\nYou can see that there's\n\na tremendous amount of detail in it.\n\nThis is an example of mask making\n\ntaken to its most elaborate conclusion.\n\nMost of the hair is glued on in the back,\n\nand then as you approach the hairline,\n\nit's punched in one by one with a needle.\n\nThe sculpture isn't very complicated,\n\nbut the hair makes it feel very convincing.\n\nThis one is my interpretation\n\nof The Creature from the Black Lagoon.\n\nThis one also comes complete with a translucent acrylic fin\n\nthat has to be cut and made separately.\n\nTo attach the fin, you have to go in with layer after layer\n\nof thickened rubber to put it into the trough\n\nthat I sculpted into the mask,\n\nand that way it's totally part of the mask.\n\nIt's really cool to be [soft music]\n\nwell known among the mask community at large.\n\nBut I think the most gratifying thing\n\nis knowing that I've influenced a generation of mask makers\n\nwho now are doing their own stuff based on my work.\n\nAnd there're a lot of young up and comers\n\nwho are quite extraordinary.\n\nWay better than I was at that age.\n\nWhat's interesting to me\n\nis that I've taken such a niche part of the planet,\n\nsomething that's really quite absurd,\n\nand turned it into my life's passion.\n\nIt's endlessly fascinating to me.\n\nThere's something about the idea\n\nof coming up with a new life form\n\nand breathing enough life into it\n\nthat other people believe it.\n\nIt's just the most exciting thing in the world for me."
