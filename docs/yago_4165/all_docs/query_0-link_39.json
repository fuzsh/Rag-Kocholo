        "text": "Tony Malanowski was 24 years old when he made his first film in 1981, a little ditty about Confederate soldiers returning from the dead known as Night of Horror. It is one of the worst films I have ever come across. It's so bad that it's often claimed that Tony only made it as a student project, not intending to ever release it as a commercial film.\n\nAdding more credence to this theory is the fact that Malanowski would remake the film the following year. The film was released in 1982 as The Curse of the Screaming Dead. Five years later, the film would be released on video by the Troma Team, where it would become better known as Curse of the Cannibal Confederates.\n\nThe title sounds rather promising, a real out-there concept that could deliver some good, cheesy thrills. Well, it is a demonstrably better film than Night of Horror. That being said, it's still goddamned terrible.\n\nIt features two returning cast members from Night of Horror, Steve Sandkuhler and Rebecca Bach. Bach was also one of the writers on Night of Horror. With Curse, Bach has ceded screenwriting duties to a Mr. Lon Huber, and her character is written as a bitter, angry feminist. Her character's name is Sarah, but I'll just call her Angry Feminist.\n\nAs for the other characters, there's three guys and two gals. Steve Sandkuhler is the main guy. His character's name is Wyatt, but I'll just call him Steve. He's joined by two other blokes, Bill and Mel, who is a kleptomaniac. They all look like rejects from a '70s rock band. The two other women are Japanese sisters named Lin and Kiyomi, who's blind. Of course, being blind means she's also psychic and can detect dark energy.\n\nWhile Night of Horror felt like it was written by some wannabe novelist, with lots of meandering narration, Curse of the Cannibal Confederates is written more like a typical slasher flick, with a bunch of bickering youngsters heading out into the woods and encountering some freaky shit. Except most slasher films of the time didn't have such bad acting, editing, and sound, and they made plenty of trash back then.\n\nInstead of long sequences of driving down the highway in their RV, like in Night of Horror, this one skips over the road trip at the start. But don't worry, they make up for it with long sequences of wandering around the woods, in the dark, with some suspenseful '70s horn music in the background, which repeats throughout the film, becoming a real earworm.\n\nMel finds a graveyard in the woods, next to an abandoned, dilapidated church. Outside the church, he discovers a chest, from which he recovers a Confederate flag. When Steve takes the flag, he is suddenly transported from the woods at dusk to someone’s lawn at mid-day. The same thing happens when Kiyomi trips and falls.\n\nBut let's circle back to the Angry Feminist. What do Angry Feminists usually do? Well, they'll bitch at you for offering to help carry their luggage, of course. Oh, and they have no respect, not even for the dead. While everyone decides it's wrong to take the flag, as it may belong to one of the fallen soldiers, Angry Feminist starts bitching at everyone to take it, and to think of the money they could get from it. I bet Rebecca Bach was very happy that she let Mr. Lon Huber write her lines this time. Maybe she agreed with his portrayal of feminists? You never know.\n\nMel decides to swipe a Confederate diary from the gravesite, and soon after, the fallen soldiers rise from the dead to reclaim their stolen property, but not before chowing down on some fools. We get some extended sequences of the Cannibal Confederates tearing out people’s guts and slurping on them, which sounds like they’re giving some really sloppy head. This goes on for minutes. If you hate mouth sounds, don’t watch this. If you don’t mind mouth sounds, still don’t watch this.\n\nThis army of the living dead is led by a commander. I've seen this image of him rising from the grave several times over the years, and I didn't realize until seeing the film on my big screen TV that he had a beard painted white, and that he wasn't wearing a loose-fitting mask.\n\nAlso, at least one of the Confederate soldiers is a woman, apparently. Perhaps they were more progressive than we realized, or maybe we got ourselves a Southern-fried Mulan.\n\nThe idea of an undead commander still giving orders to his troops with the little amount of brain power he has left is kind of intriguing. There's something to be said about military brainwashing there. Too bad this film is complete garbage. Perhaps this idea is better explored in other films.\n\nBack to our ragtag team of campers. Kiyomi is getting scared of all the bad vibes she's feeling, and begs Mel to hold her, which he is aggravated by. What kind of a man do you have to be to refuse affection to a blind Japanese woman? I'd hate to meet that kind of a man.\n\nThe gang came to the woods to go deer hunting, but it's easy to forget that. Those guns they brought sure come in handy when battling zombies. The biggest laugh I got out of this film was when Angry Feminist says, \"I want a gun, too!\", and pouts like a child, then cut to Mel with his head down yelling, \"No!\", then abruptly cut to another zombie attack, like the film skipped or something.\n\nThe film climaxes with the men firing at the zombies, or at least dummies rigged with nitroglycerin. Most of the gang end up perishing at the hands of the zombies, until Steve is the last man standing. Steve hands the soldiers back their valuables, and they back off. Then, Steve is asleep and is woken up by Lin. The film is so poorly shot and edited, with such little sense of space and time, that I wasn't sure if Steve fell asleep on the spot, as if the zombies put him in a trance, or if it was supposed to be all a dream. Perhaps it's left up to your interpretation. Very Lynchian.\n\nThis review was a bit of a mess, so it's a perfect description of Curse of the Cannibal Confederates. It's one of the worst horror films made before the digital age, and yet it's still considerably better than its premake Night of Horror. At least it's better lit, so you can see what's going on most of the time, and the climax isn't literally unwatchable. That oughta be a prerequisite for any film, but Night of Horror isn't any film."
