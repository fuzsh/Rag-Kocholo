        "text": "In October of last year, I embarked on a journey to watch every horror film made in the 1960s, at least every one I could find online that was logged on Letterboxd. Now, a little over six months later, I've completed my mission, save for a few leftovers.\n\nI started the decade with the classic French film Eyes Without A Face, released in January of 1960, and ended the decade with another film about a lost soul behind a mask, although a very different one indeed, John Carpenter's short film Captain Voyeur. The last feature film I saw was another film about a mad doctor's botched operation on a young woman, the awful Mexican film La señora muerte, with John Carradine as the doctor. Either way, the decade is bookended with connections.\n\nI went into this marathon knowing that I would have to sit through a lot of crap, but hoping to find a treasure trove of hidden gems, which indeed I have, and I have written about many of these films. Little did I suspect, however, just how few and far between these winners were, in contrast to the amount of bland, repetitive, bargain-basement shite I subjected myself to.\n\nWhile the 1960s saw a rise in creative freedom for filmmakers, it also saw a rise in cheap drive-in trash, when producers all over the world perfected their own formulas and exploited them to no end. This is why I had to suffer through the same awful plots and eye-rolling tropes over and over.\n\nWhether it's Hammer's gothic horror flicks and their many imitators, Jess Franco's mad doctors, Larry Buchanan's paltry TV monster movies, the countless wrestling flicks produced at the Churubusco-Azteca studio, or the infinite number of films set in old European castles. It all became so exhausting. It was simultaneously a massive chore and a real treat, in that I got to discover some of the worst and the best that the genre has to offer.\n\nAnd now, because I am a madman, I am about to continue my journey into the 1970s. I am confident that this will be at least a marginal improvement over the last decade, since the '70s was the greatest decade, not just for horror films, but for cinema in general, and indeed, the culture at large.\n\nIt was a time of great change, when people were rethinking the way they saw the world, and more barriers were breaking down, including the stranglehold of the Hollywood studio system. All of this enlightenment unfortunately slowed down during the coke-fueled Reagan years.\n\nFor now, I say farewell to the 1960s and salutations to the 1970s! Feel free to comment below asking any questions you like on the horror of the 1960s, and join me on this ride through some of the weirdest and wildest films ever made."
