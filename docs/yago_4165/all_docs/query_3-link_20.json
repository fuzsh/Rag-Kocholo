From novel adaptations to sequels to remakes, icons reborn, and even *original ideas*, 2024 is set to be jam-packed with horror movies.\n\nSo, please sit back and get your flashlights ready; here are some of the new horror movies coming in 2024 that we’re dying to see.\n\nUpcoming Horror Movies in 2024\n\nNight Swim\n\nRelease Date: January 5, 2024\n\nBlumhouse is kicking off the new year with Night Swim, inspired by the 2014 horror short of the same name. A retired baseball player (Wyatt Russell) moves into a new house, but the swimming pool in the backyard holds some secrets. We need more water horror, so this movie is exciting. Wet ghosts hit harder than dry ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounders Day\n\nRelease Date: January 19, 2024\n\nThis new slasher brings us to a small town where a mayoral election will occur. Meanwhile, a string of murders begins at the hands of a masked assailant. Erik and Carson Bloomquist helm the feature as director and writer, and this horror/mystery movie can be found in theaters on January 19, 2024.\n\nI Know Exactly How You Die\n\nRelease Date: February 4, 2024\n\nA horror writer sees his manuscript begin to take on a life of its own in this horror slasher directed by Alexandra Spieth. Little else is known about this film at this time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLisa Frankenstein\n\nRelease Date: February 9, 2024\n\nThis PG-13 horror comedy written by Diablo Cody (Jennifer’s Body) stars Kathryn Newton, Liza Soberano, Cole Sprouse, and Carla Gugino and is the directorial debut of Zelda Williams. Lisa Frankenstein tells the tale of a girl named Lisa who falls in love with a monster. You can find Lisa Frankenstein in theaters on February 9, 2024.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2\n\nRelease Date: February 2024\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh is back for blood; this time, he has his friends with him. One note that many viewers had while watching Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey was the absence of many iconic characters. The sequel is set to make this right as it appears Tigger and Owl will be joining Winnie the Pooh and Piglet on their next adventure out of the Hundred Acre Wood. (Do you know how hilarious it is to me that I’m referring to a horror movie right now?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has yet to be a confirmed release date for the film, though Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 should be expected in February, with a rumored release date of February 16, 2024.\n\nImaginary\n\nRelease Date: March 8, 2024\n\nThis Blumhouse production, directed by Jeff Wadlow, brings horror to teddies with the seemingly haunted Chauncey bear in Imaginary. Judging by the trailer for Imaginary, we’re in for a ghost story, as Chauncey gives a little girl an ominous to-do list as a shadow figure lurks about the house.\n\nReturn to Silent Hill\n\nRelease Date: Expected 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAudiences are going back to Silent Hill with this psychological horror reboot. In 2022, a teaser trailer for Return to Silent Hill was dropped during a Silent Hill Transmission stream, and filming wrapped in July 2023.\n\nThough an official release date for Return to Silent Hill has yet to be announced, a 2024 release date is likely.\n\nThe First Omen\n\nRelease Date: April 5, 2024\n\nThe Omen prequel has been underway since 2016 and is only months away from finally hitting theaters. The First Omen takes place at a church in Rome, where a conspiracy to bring about evil incarnate is unveiled. 20th Century Studios is producing this Omen prequel, and Arkasha Stevenson is in the director’s seat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntitled Universal Monster Movie by Radio Silence\n\nRelease Date: April 19, 2024\n\nIt seems like a new vampire movie is coming, as this Untitled Radio Silence Monster Movie project was initially rumored to be titled Dracula’s Daughter. While there’s been no confirmation on a title or subject matter, the plot, if it follows the 1936 horror film of the same name, will center on a group of kidnappers who find out the hard way that one of their victims is the daughter of a famous universal monster. Melissa Barrera (Scream 5, 6) takes a leading role.\n\nWitchboard\n\nRelease Date: Expected 2024\n\nChuck Russell, who previously gave us movies such as The Blob, The Mask, Nightmare on Elm Street 3, and Bless The Child, is returning to horror with Witchboard. This reimagining of the 1980s paranormal horror of the same name sees Jamie Campbell Bower (Stranger Things’ Vecna) as an occultist whom a paranormal-afflicted couple (Madison Iseman, Aaron Dominguez) seek out for help. There’s been no official release date for Witchboard yet, but it should arrive sometime in 2024.\n\nHorrorscope\n\nRelease Date: May 10, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter attending a party where their horoscopes were read, a group of teens began dying in ways that matched their astrology readings. Horrorscope is based on a novel of the same name by “Nicholas Adams.” Adams was a collective pen name used by a group of 90s YA horror writers. Expect a fun, creative slasher with a little mystery.\n\nThe Strangers: Chapter One\n\nRelease Date: May 17, 2024\n\nDirector Renny Harlin is bringing us The Strangers trilogy in 2024, each film existing as its chapter in a larger story. All of this is setting up the potential for a The Strangers universe in the future, with even more films to follow.\n\nThe first film in the trilogy, The Strangers: Chapter One, is expected to be released on May 17, 2024. While the release dates of its successors are not yet known, they are all expected to be released sometime in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Shrouds\n\nRelease Date: Unknown\n\nThe king of body horror, David Cronenberg, will have a unique treat for us soon through his upcoming horror movie The Shrouds. Filming reportedly wrapped back in June 2023, so some sources speculate that The Shrouds will premiere at the Cannes Festival in April 2024, with a widespread release to follow not long after. The Shrouds is about a businessman who invents a way to connect with the dead through a burial shroud, allowing people to watch their lost loved ones decompose in real-time. That’s just the beginning of this scary movie that will undoubtedly leave its mark on viewers.\n\nThe Watchers\n\nRelease Date: June 7, 2024\n\nA woman named Mina (played by Dakota Fanning) becomes isolated in a bunker alongside three strangers in the Irish wilderness as ominous creatures lurk just outside. The Watchers is the feature film directorial debut of Ishana Shyamalan, the daughter of M Night Shyamalan.\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One\n\nRelease Date: June 28, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis spinoff-prequel of the original story by John Krasinski sees Emily Blunt, Djimon Hounsou, and Millicent Simmonds reprising their roles. However, expect a new story with new characters as Lupita Nyong’o (Us) takes the lead in A Quiet Place: Day One.\n\nTrap\n\nRelease Date: August 2, 2024\n\nThe plot for M Night Shyamalan‘s new movie has been massively kept under wraps. However, while speaking at CineEurope, M Night Shyamalan hinted Trap is a “psychological thriller set at a concert.” This film is M Night Shyamalan’s first in a new multi-movie deal with WB and New Line Cinemas, so expect a Shyamalan resurgence in the years to follow.\n\nSpeak No Evil\n\nRelease Date: August 9, 2024\n\nIn 2022, the Danish film Speak No Evil left its mark on audiences due to its disturbing, unforgettable nature. In the summer of 2024, Blumhouse will deliver a remake of Speak No Evil, starring James McAvoy and Mackenzie Davis. The original film sees a family terrorized while on vacation in the countryside, making this a perfect horror movie to close summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nRelease Date: August 16, 2024\n\nXenomorphs are returning to the big screen with Fede Álvarez in the director’s seat. Star Cailee Spaeny recently confirmed Alien: Romulus will take place between the events of Alien and Aliens. A pre-sequel, if you will. If that tickles your tulips, you’ll be delighted to know that FX has an Alien prequel series underway.\n\nThey Listen\n\nRelease Date: August 30, 2024\n\nThe plot of this upcoming horror film, produced by Blumhouse and directed by Chris Weitz, has been massively kept under wraps. We know the release date was pushed off in 2023, and we expect They Listen to release on August 30, 2024.\n\nBeetlejuice 2\n\nRelease Date: September 6, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost 40 years after its predecessor was released (and 30 years since the TV series ended), we are finally getting more Beetlejuice. Michael Keaton is reprising his role as the titular bad guy, with Winona Ryder (Lydia Deetz) and Catherine O’Hara (Delia Deetz) returning. The movie will also introduce Jenna Ortega as Lydia’s daughter and Monica Belluci as Beetlejuice’s wife. As Beetlejuice is no longer a bachelor, we are undoubtedly about to see Beetlejuice in a way we haven’t seen him before.\n\nSaw XI\n\nRelease Date: September 27, 2024\n\nA year after the release of Saw X, expect the eleventh Saw movie to emerge in theaters. Plot details are cloudy, but Saw XI producer Oren Koules hinted that picking up where they left off during Saw X “would be the natural place to take at least the next one.” This statement paints a future with more Saw movies to come and would mean the return of Tobin Bell for Saw XI, though nothing has been confirmed yet.\n\nBambi: The Reckoning\n\nRelease Date: Expected 2024\n\nHorror is coming for another childhood classic this year, as Bambi: The Reckoning is coming. The Bambi horror film was announced by Entertainment Weekly in 2022 and promises to show us a terrifying side to the beloved icon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalem’s Lot\n\nRelease Date: ???\n\nThe new Salem’s Lot movie has eluded us for over a year. The completed film saw its original Fall 2022 release pushed to April 2023, which was then canceled, and Salem’s Lot has been in limbo ever since. Though nothing has been substantiated, there were rumors that the film would be released straight to streaming on Max. I’m optimistically including Salem’s Lot as a 2024 release, hoping this film will soon see the light of day.\n\nSmile 2\n\nRelease Date: October 18, 2024\n\nSmile was a top horror movie in 2022, and the sequel was green-lit right away. In the past, director and creator Parker Finn hinted in an interview with Collider that we had yet to see all the layers of the Smile entity, so Smile 2 will likely explore that.\n\nWolf Man\n\nRelease Date: October 25, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe full moon isn’t safe. Blumhouse is breathing new life into another universal monster with Christopher Abbott starring in Wolf Man. Given Blumhouse’s running success giving Universal Monsters a modern-day treatment in The Invisible Man and Renfield, this is one to watch out for.\n\nTerrifier 3\n\nRelease Date: October 25, 2024\n\nArt the Clown is returning to terrorize theaters for Halloween, and the scares look like they’ll last through Christmas. In Terrifier 2, director Damien Leone reminded us why practical effects are king, delivering squirm-inducing deaths that need no introduction further than “bleach and salt” or “mashed potatoes.” Terrifier 3 plans to show us that its predecessors are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nSlaughter Horse\n\nRelease Date: Expected October 31, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis indie horror flick seems like it’s going to be a blast. Toby Johansen directs Slaughter Horse, and its story follows a woman at odds against a deranged kidnapper who has a thing for wearing a horse mask.\n\nMaXXXine\n\nI’m including this one, although, as of this writing, there has been no news on any release date. The Ti West-directed trilogy that started with X, which we’ve been waiting on since Pearl was released last year, should be here soon.\n\nAfter all, the first two films were only released six months apart, and MaXXXine is currently listed as in post-production. It’s safe to assume we will see the trilogy conclude in 2024. Following the events of X, Mia Goth reprises her role as Maxine, who is headed to Los Angeles in pursuit of her dream to become an actress.\n\nThe Toxic Avenger\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nThe reboot of this 1984 cult classic should be here soon. Peter Dinklage takes the role of Winston Poze, the hapless janitor who fell into a pit of toxic slime, transforming him into the Toxic Avenger. This reboot also features Kevin Bacon, Elijah Wood, Taylour Paige, and Jacob Tremblay. The Toxic Avenger premiered at two festivals in the fall of 2023, so it’s reasonable to assume a release date sometime in 2024, though there’s been no official statement as of this writing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaces of Death\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nThe remake of the 80s cult horror film Faces of Death has no official release date yet and is not guaranteed to appear in 2024. However, news of Faces of Death, starring Barbie Ferreira and Dacre Montgomery, has been mounting over the last two years, and the film is expected soon.\n\nNosferatu\n\nRelease Date: December 25, 2024\n\nIt’s been over a hundred years since Nosferatu was released, creating iconic shots that are still replicated in many films today. Nosferatu, heavily inspired by Bram Stoker’s Dracula, also impacted the vampire mythos, as the film Nosferatu is responsible for the idea that sunlight could kill vampires. It’s exciting to see this film revived.\n\nThe Nosferatu remake, directed by Robert Eggers and costarring Lily-Rose Depp and Willem Dafoe, should be released on Christmas Day. The antagonist (Count Orlock) is played by Bill Skarsgard, who previously made his own mark on horror with his depiction of Pennywise. I have high hopes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan Peele’s New Movie\n\nPreviously expected: December 25, 2024, new release date TBD\n\nSome time ago, Jordan Peele announced that he had a fourth horror movie on the way, and all that is known about it is that it would be released on Christmas Day 2024. Unfortunately, due to not wanting to compete with the release of Nosferatu, the original Christmas release date has been pulled, with a new one still to be determined. Jordan Peele’s new movie will likely be pushed back until 2025; however, since it was a 2024 movie release I was looking forward to, its 2024 absence deserves to be noted.\n\nNote: Unfortunately, I do not have Madame Horror Press’s uncanny powers of omnipotence. However, my preternatural senses tell me we can expect even more new scary movies in 2024 than the ones listed here. As such, this list is by no means exhaustive. A hurricane of horror may very well be on the horizon; please prepare yourself adequately.\n\nI hope you enjoy all the horror movies that 2024 intends to rain down upon us. Let us know in the comments which scary movie of 2024 you’re most excited about.\n\nTo never miss out on fun horror updates, conversation, and more, follow us on Instagram @HORRORPRESSLLC and subscribe to our monthly Apparitions newsletter.

Unfortunately, it seems most publications pay them little to no mind, and that’s a crying shame. Some of the best filmmakers got their start by making short films and so many future stars have short films on the festival circuit today. Let’s take a look at the short films of the Tokyo Horror Film Festival.\n\nStand Out Shorts Fresh From Tokyo Horror Film Festival\n\nKneading\n\nDirected by Lulu & Augie Syracuse\n\nWritten by Lulu Syracuse\n\nAn office worker pisses their boss off when they forget to feed the office cat. Surely this will be a normal exchange!\n\nKneading is short, sweet, and to the point. Lulu and Augie Syracuse have crafted an incredibly weird and atmospheric short film with a stinger you won’t see coming a mile away. The practical effect work gets the job done and leaves a lasting impact. There’s a lot of potential within this two-and-a-half-minute short, and it will be interesting to see where they go from here.\n\nBackward Creep\n\nWritten and Directed by Christopher G. Moore\n\nThree friends are en route to an anime convention, but their plans are stopped in their tracks after they run over a pedestrian.\n\nDelightfully campy, Backward Creep excels in one thing: giving audiences a good time. There’s not much to this short, and that’s fine. We have three friends who ran something over and it gets its revenge. It’s simple, in the best way possible. Some shorts try to overcompensate for their short runtimes; Moore doesn’t do that. He puts it all out there and lets you exist within this world for just a few minutes. Supposedly, there is a feature version of this in the works. If Moore keeps the feature fully practical and keeps the gnarly creature design, I’m sold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChateau Sauvignon: terroir\n\nWritten by David M. Night Maire and Allyssa Rivera-Cabrero\n\nDirected by David M. Night Maire\n\nA young boy and his father run a winery that might be more nefarious than it seems.\n\nLike a fine wine, Chateau Sauvignon: terroir feels a bit pretentious. It takes itself very seriously and constantly withholds from the viewer. Night Maire and Rivera-Cabrero’s script ends up feeling a bit too smart for its own good. Michael Lorz charismatically, and creepily, leads this short with the exhausted vigor of a young adult resigned to a life of depravity. The practical effects in this short look gorgeous and impactful. It’ll make you think twice before going back to a winery, that’s for sure.\n\nTen of Swords\n\nWritten and Directed by Faye Jackson\n\nWhat would happen if you woke up dead, destined to a life of forced labor? Would you take it on the chin, or fight back?\n\nLet’s see a show of hands if you had no clue Ten of Swords was a tarot card reference. (Raises hand.) Ten of Swords has a lot to say. It comments on forced labor, predestination (to an extent), and the human condition. Jackson’s script does a decent job of getting the point across, but the short really feels like it just goes beat to beat without any real visual flow. Overall, it’s an enjoyable watch with some great action and practical effects. The set and production design is impeccable and provides excellent world-building for this dystopian future. Knowing now, what tarot card this short references feels a bit on the nose with some of the visuals, but that doesn’t mean it’s not impactful.\n\nGrease Bunny\n\nWritten and Directed by Benedetto Cocuzza\n\nAfter a long day of work, Stacy (Haley Hammonds) gets home and orders a pizza. What could go wrong?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Benedetto Cocuzza might ring a bell for a few of you. He is the founder of the indie horror video game studio Puppet Combo. I’ll be able to put my bias aside, but there isn’t a single Puppet Combo game I don’t consider a 5 out of 5. Cocuzza’s PlayStation 1 low-res style just tickles that nostalgic spot in my brain that reminds me of my childhood. If you think his short films would be stylistically different from his games, you’re wrong. Grease Bunny is a liminal body horror nightmare, dripping with grease, cheese, and pepperoni. Hammond’s campy acting perfectly embodies the Puppet Combo style, though it could possibly be a turnoff for those who aren’t familiar with Cocuzza’s style. If you’ve ever wondered what a giant pepperoni pizza monster nibbling on someone’s toes would look like, then Grease Bunny is the short film for you.\n\nAlso, go check out Puppet Combo’s games; they’re truly excellent.\n\nSupport indie game devs!\n\nBeverly Hills Exorcist\n\nWritten and Directed by Rem Scobell\n\nA group of exorcists in Beverly Hills attempt to exorcise a house from a giant-headed demon.\n\nI’ll be upfront here, Beverly Hills Exorcist didn’t work for me. There’s a line of camp I can accept and enjoy…this short leaps over that line. The acting feels forced and unrehearsed and it all just happens too fast. Too much character development for too many characters happens in such a short amount of time and it feels overstuffed. Scobell’s idea is fun and could possibly work in a larger sense, but as a short film, it doesn’t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBody\n\nWritten and Directed by Ronald Short\n\nAn electronic Frankenstein toy makes its way into a couple’s house…and it’s moving!\n\nBody is incredibly cute. The entire short takes place in the kitchen with Dawn (Leila Anastasia Scott) and Jack (Aaron G. Hale). Scott and Hale are incredibly adorable together and exhibit one of the most believable relationships I’ve seen in a short film. Short has created a short film that should be studied by those who want to make short films. What he created with one prop, two actors, [presumably] one camera, and some fake blood is beyond impressive. Very little happens in this short, but it’s what happens and how it happens that makes this short film charming and exciting.\n\nThe Pencil\n\nWritten by Madina Schultz and Thomas Schultz\n\nDirected by Thomas Shultz\n\nSara (Mika Saruar) is an artist struggling to make ends meet. One day she finds a pencil that brings her drawings to life; flowers, money…monsters.\n\nOne of my favorite things about festival coverage is when I see a good short at a festival, and then another festival, and another, etc. At this point, I think I’ve seen The Pencil at four different festivals, and it’s well deserved. Coming in at just over 10 minutes, The Pencil tells a harrowing tale of struggle and love. Schultz’s script is tight and precise, and it gets its point across with enough time to play around a little bit. After seeing this short for the first time, I had nightmares of the short film’s creature. Well, guess what’s back in my nightmares now! The Pencil is a perfectly crafted short film that NEEDS a feature-length version.\n\nIf you get a chance to see any of these shorts at a film festival near you, be sure you do!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShudder is taking Hot Girl Summer to heart this August. This month’s press release was small but mighty, and I am canceling my plans to fit all these titles into my schedule. Before I tell you about the five movies I’m most excited to see on the streamer, I have to point out they are dropping a new original series called Horror’s Greatest on August 27th. It’s described as a deep dive into everything we love about horror. So, I expect it to be at least 1000 episodes long, and I love that for me. Anyway, here are the five movies I am not going to stop talking about this month.\n\nAnd as always, if you don’t have a Shudder sub, get one here!\n\nThe Best Movies to Stream on Shudder This Month\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nA serial killer with a bladed glove preys on teens as they sleep. I am a Petty Freddy stan account, so I live my best life every time the original film comes to Shudder. This remains one of the best films in the franchise. It is also arguably one of the most cherished films on Wes Craven’s resume.\n\nYou can watch A Nightmare on Elm Street on August 1st.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDancing Village: The Curse Begins (2024)\n\nA supernatural entity terrorizes a village. I have never seen an Indonesian horror movie that didn’t mess me up. So, of course, I will be hitting play on this new nightmare fuel the second it’s available on the streamer. I’m ready to see this spirit run through this town like the Tomb Raider.\n\nYou can watch Dancing Village: The Curse Begins on August 16th.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Deeper You Dig (2019)\n\nThe line between the living and the dead collapses after a roadside accident. I was late to The Adams Family party, so I still need to see this one. I’m thinking I might double feature it because their new movie Hell Hole will arrive on the streamer fresh from the Fantasia Film Festival on August 23. Seems like a disturbing family night to me, and I am ready.\n\nYou can watch The Deeper You Dig on August 19th.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (1994)\n\nAn investigator realizes that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to an author’s horror stories. They had my attention because someone read a horror writer’s work. That’s the dream, even if some people are probably about to go through it in this movie. This John Carpenter movie stars Sam Neill, and I am surprised (and ashamed) that this will be my first watch. Thanks for helping a girl out, Shudder!\n\nYou can watch In The Mouth Of Madness on August 1st.\n\nWes Craven’s New Nightmare (1994)\n\nAn evil entity uses the character of Freddy Kruger as a gateway to our world. This is my other favorite movie in the franchise. It might also be where I started to learn the definition of meta. Seeing the cast, who made the movie I loved, come back to play versions of themselves terrorized by Petty Freddy is one of my favorite childhood memories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can watch Wes Craven’s New Nightmare on August 1st.\n\nShudder really didn’t come to play this month, and I’m here for it. I am probably parked on the app while you are reading this. To which, I say, close your mobile device and turn on your TV, friend. It’s time!"
