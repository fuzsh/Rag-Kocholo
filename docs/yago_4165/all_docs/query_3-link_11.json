        "text": "Chuck Russell has made some pretty cool movies throughout his career. He’s of course known in the horror world for directing A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and The Blob (1988), one of the best horror sequels of all time and one of the best horror remakes of all time. He subsequently directed Jim Carrey-starring comedy The Mask, centered on a man who turns into a crazy green freak after putting on a mysterious mask.\n\nHey wait. That sounds like a horror movie, doesn’t it?\n\nWell, it was originally supposed to be!\n\nSpeaking with Xfinity in advance of this past weekend’s Bloody Disgusting co-presented Horror Fest at Wizard World Philly, Russell revealed that the 1994 family film was originally conceived as a very Elm Street-esque slasher flick. Stanley Ipkiss, well, he was going to become New Line’s new Freddy Krueger!\n\n“It’s a great example of really fighting for your vision in a film. We changed it from a horror film into a comedy,” Russell revealed. “It was originally conceived as being a horror film. That was a real battle. New Line wanted a new kind of Freddy movie. By coincidence, I had seen the same original Mask comic they ended up buying, and I thought, ‘That’s really cool, but it’s too derivative of Freddy Krueger.’ It really was. He would put on the mask and kill people. And have one-liners. It was a really cool, splatterpunk, black and white comic. They’ve redone the comics to be more like my movie, but the original comics were really cool, dark and scary.”\n\nHe added, “But I knew, as a film, it would be very reminiscent of Freddy Krueger.”\n\nWhat would The Mask look like as a horror movie? Find out below!\n\nThe M3GAN Universe will also be expanding next year with a spinoff horror movie titled SOULM8TE, starring Lily Sullivan (Evil Dead Rise, Monolith). After popping heads as Victoria Neuman on Prime Video’s “The Boys,” Deadline reports that actor Claudia Doumit has joined the cast of the horror spinoff.\n\nThe spinoff is being billed as a ’90s-style erotic thriller with a “new technological twist,” and it’s coming to theaters on January 2, 2026.\n\nDoumit will star opposite previously announced leads Sullivan and David Rysdahl, but character details are currently under wraps.\n\nSOULM8TE follows along as “a man (Rysdahl) acquires an Artificially Intelligent android (Sullivan) to help him cope with the recent loss of his deceased wife. In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, the man inadvertently turns a harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate.”\n\nKate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) will direct. The filmmaker rewrote an original draft from Rafael Jordan (Salvage Marines), which was based on a story by James Wan, Ingrid Bisu and Jordan. It’s said to be far more risqué than its parent film.\n\n“Fundamentally, I view this film as an exploration of relationships and loneliness,” Dolan said in a recent statement. “Despite technological advances, there are enduring human truths we cannot escape, and I am looking forward to delving into those depths.”\n\n“SOULM8TE is a thrilling and seductive addition to the M3GAN universe. We’re excited to partner with Kate to bring this story to life with her unique cinematic vision and point of view,” said James Wan, who produces through his company Atomic Monster.\n\nM3GAN was a massive viral hit for Blumhouse back in 2022, the film scaring up $180 million at the worldwide box office. It’s no secret why Blumhouse is all-in on all things M3GAN.\n\nWan and Jason Blum will produce, with Michael Clear and Judson Scott of Wan’s Atomic Monster exec producing alongside Ingrid Bisu. Alayna Glasthal is the executive overseeing the project for Atomic Monster."
