        "text": "With Friday the 13th tomorrow, I couldn't help but start thinking about what scary movies I definitely want to watch and which ones are on the \"never again\" list. I get scared easily, but for some genius, or maybe not so genius reason, I choose to watch these scary movies alone. Which is not ideal, at all. Everyone has their own idea as to what is scary and what is just so fake it has zero scare factor. Either way, I like a good rush as long as I can sleep after I watch it.\n\nI have made a list of my Top 3 Favorites and my Top 3 Worst Scary Movies.\n\nTop Favorite:\n\nThe Conjuring. Every single one of these creeped me out big time. From the jump scares, to the creepy feeling someone is in the room with you, it hit all my creep factor must-haves.\n\nCandyman. This movie still gives me the absolute creeps. The 1992 version, I still have to see the newest one!\n\nThe Blair Witch Project. The ONLY reason this movie is on here is that it came out when I was in high school and we went on a camping trip and one of my classmates decided to re-enact half the scenes while we were in the woods. Not cool, but it got me good!"
