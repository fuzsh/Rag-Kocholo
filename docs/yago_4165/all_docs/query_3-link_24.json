        "text": "When “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” came out in 1974, it was marketed as a true story, which undoubtedly added to the horror factor. The claim was mostly false, though the star of the movie, Leatherface, was loosely inspired by the killer Ed Gein, called the “Butcher of Plainfield,” who made furniture and a suit out of human skin. And there was another unnerving real-life inspiration. “The idea actually came from a doctor I knew,” Tobe Hooper, the director of the film, told Texas Monthly. “I remembered that he’d once told me this story about how, when he was a pre-med student, the class was studying cadavers. And he went into the morgue and skinned a cadaver and made a mask for Halloween.”\n\nEven before Covid made masks a daily inconvenience for us, they occupied a mighty space in our cultural imagination. Masks are a mainstay of horror, donned by mysterious strangers and serial killers while they terrorize innocents. The blank, lifeless visages of such classic horror masks as those belonging to Leatherface, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers seem to signify corpses — faces stripped of their verve and individuality.\n\nThese masks also embody the unknown: the mystery of the person behind the mask and the disconnect between what may seem otherwise mundane (an animal mask, a hockey mask) and the mask’s frightfulness when placed in a new context. But there’s something deeper to the psychology of our fear around masks, related to our worst fears about ourselves and the fragile structure of society — whether it’s in a house of cannibals in Middle of Nowhere, Texas, or in our own familiar haunts during a time of pandemic.\n\nLeatherface wears three different masks throughout the movie, which he switches into based on the situation, as a way to show emotion. Of course, the faces sag on his own face, so that on top of the horror of the mask itself, there’s the uncanny sight of our flesh-faced killer’s real features poking out from beneath the mask’s.\n\nWith masks, it is never about the monster but the man whose mask obscures and reveals him.\n\nIn the “Halloween” movies, Michael Myers’s chalk-white face mask, like Leatherface’s, is eerily emotionless. Designed by Tommy Lee Wallace, the mask was based on a Captain Kirk “death mask” that was created for “Star Trek.” The show didn’t end up using it, so Wallace converted it, coloring the hair and face and cutting the eye holes larger to create the vacant look.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
