        "text": "We are now much closer to determining the official answer to the question at the heart of the Love Triangle Debate.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the LTD has raised many points of contention over its long history. What it has ultimately boiled down to, however, is which course of events one believes took place near the end of Disc 2 at the time the party goes their separate ways, each seeking a personal motivation to carry the fight to Sephiroth inside the Northern Crater.\n\nCloud and Tifa, of course, remain behind at the airship, alone together. The contents of the scenes which immediately follow this development are then based on the prior actions of the player, and how high they have raised Tifa’s affection for Cloud. For those not in the know, through many of the optional dialogues and actions one may take during Disc 1, the player is able to influence the degree of affection four members of AVALANCHE have for Cloud: Aerith, Tifa, Yuffie and Barret.\n\nFor a complete list of the choices that influence these affection ratings, as well as the affects these choices have on the affection values, see Terence Fergusson’s Date Mechanics Guide at GameFAQs.\n\nWithin the game, the outcome of the player’s choices are presented in three scenes, two on Disc 1 and the last on Disc 2.\n\nThe first event they influence is who will tour the Gold Saucer with Cloud if the player doesn’t make a selection for this choice when they first arrive at the amusement park. The character with the highest affection rating for Cloud will be the default option if the player proceeds to explore the park without first choosing a companion. Otherwise, if the player does elect to choose, the character whom they pick (Red XIII being an exception) will receive additional affection points for Cloud (+3), while speaking to either Yuffie, Aerith or Tifa and turning down their offer to join you results in their affection for Cloud decreasing (-2).\n\nTurning down Red XIII, meanwhile, has no effect whatsoever.\n\nAlso, note that only the first selection made to increase or decrease affection values will actually do so. The effects of these choices are not cumulative if more than one such selection is made.\n\nThe second event influenced by the “date mechanics” is the game’s actual date at the Gold Saucer. The character with the highest affection rating for Cloud will come to his hotel room and drag him out for a night on the town.\n\nFinally, the third event to feel the effects of the player’s choices is the fan-dubbed “Highwind scene” at the end of Disc 2, diverging into two scenes that fans have also named: the “High Affection scene” and the “Low Affection scene.” These names rather intuitively reflect the conditions by which both scenes are unlocked — i.e. if Tifa’s affection for Cloud is below a certain value, the Low Affection scene plays; if her affection is equal to or above a certain value, the High Affection scene is witnessed instead.\n\nThe differences in the two scenes are described thus on pg. 198 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega guidebook:\n\n—\n\nNight before the final battle……\n\nAfter stopping Hojo’s recklessness and before heading to the Northern Crater, the conversation scene with Tifa can diverge drastically depending on Tifa’s affection rating. When the affection rating is low, the conversation of the scene where the two spend the evening is candid/apathetic and rather short. In the scene on the bridge the next morning, Tifa asks “Were you listening?” and taps her foot. On the other hand, if the affection rating is high, the two spend the evening in focused conversation, and on the bridge, Tifa asks “Were you watching?” and collapses in embarrassment.”\n\n[Caption for the screenshot of Cloud saying “This is probably the last time we’ll have together……”]\n\nWhen the degree of affection is high, the night passes meaningfully between the two……\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n決戦前夜に……\n\n宝条の暴走を止めてから大空洞へ突入するまでにくり広げられるティファとの会話場面は、ティファの好感度によって分岐する。好感度が低いと、ふたりで夜を明かす場面の会話 が淡白で短め。翌朝の操縦室の場面では、ティファが「聞いてたの？」と言ってつま先をトントンとする。一方、好感度が高いと、ふたりで夜を明かす場面 の会話が濃く、操縦室ではティファが「見てたの？」と恥ずかしがってへたりこむのだ。\n\n[Caption for the screenshot of Cloud saying “This is probably the last time we’ll have together……”]\n\n好感度が高い場合、ふたりで過ごす夜が意味深なものに……。\n\n—\n\nYou can observe the differences between the two versions in the following video and transcriptions (YouTube upload courtesy of TrippNessa):\n\n(High Affection version transcription)\n\n—\n\n[Below the Highwind]\n\nTifa: “Everyone’s gone…”\n\nCloud: “Yeah, we don’t have anywhere or anyone to go home to.”\n\nTifa: “You’re right…\n\nBut… I’m sure someday… they’ll come back, don’t you think?”\n\nCloud: “Hmm… I wonder…?\n\nEveryone has an irreplaceable something they’re holding on to…\n\nBut this time, our opponent…”\n\nTifa: “Hmm… But that’s all right, even if no one comes back.\n\nAs long as I’m with you… As long as you’re by my side… I won’t give up even if I’m scared.”\n\nCloud: “………Tifa……”\n\nTifa: “No matter how close we are… We were far apart… before this.\n\nBut when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice…\n\n…sniff… you probably don’t remember this…\n\nBut deep in my heart I heard you calling my name… Or at least I thought I did…”\n\nCloud: “Yeah… At that time I heard you calling me.\n\nYou were calling me back from the stream of consciousness in the Lifestream.\n\nAfter all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to you, I would come to help.”\n\nTifa: “Cloud…? Do you think the stars can hear us?\n\nDo you think they see how hard we’re fighting for them?”\n\nCloud: “I dunno… But…\n\nWhether they are or not, we still have to do what we can.\n\nAnd believe in ourselves…\n\nI’ll find the answer someday. Right, Tifa?\n\nThat’s what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream. ”\n\nTifa: “Yeah…… that’s right…”\n\nCloud: “Hey Tifa…… I…… There are a lot of things I wanted to talk to you about.\n\nBut now that we’re together like this, I don’t know what I really wanted to say…\n\nI guess nothing’s changed at all… Kind of makes you want to laugh…”\n\nTifa: “Cloud… Words aren’t the only thing that tell people what you’re thinking…”\n\nCloud: “…………”\n\n[Fade to black; the screen fades in early the next morning, with Tifa leaning against Cloud, asleep]\n\nCloud: “…………It’s almost dawn…”\n\nTifa: “H, huh…?”\n\nCloud: “Sorry. Did I wake you…? It’s almost dawn, Tifa.”\n\nTifa: “Umm… G, good morning… Cloud.\n\nGive me a little longer… Just a little bit longer…\n\nThis day will never come again… So let me have this moment…”\n\nCloud: “Yeah… okay.\n\nThis is probably the last time we’ll have together……”\n\n[The screen fades out once again, then fades back in to the sun fully risen and the two fully awake]\n\nTifa: “………”\n\nCloud: “We’d better go.”\n\nTifa: “But, I still…!?”\n\nCloud: “It’s all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday.\n\nAt least we don’t have to go on alone.”\n\nTifa: “Yes… That’s right!”\n\nCloud: “Okay! Let’s go!”\n\n[Back on the airship]\n\nTifa: “The airship is too big for just the two of us.\n\nYeah, it’s a little lonely without everyone.”\n\nCloud: “Don’t worry. It’ll be okay.\n\nI’ll make a big enough ruckus for everyone.\n\nBesides, I’m the pilot.\n\nNo more flying around casually like before.\n\nWe won’t have time to feel lonely.”\n\nTifa: “Huh!?”\n\nCloud: “It’s moving……”\n\n[On the bridge, they find Cid, Barret, Cait Sith and Red XIII, with Cid manning the controls]\n\nCloud: “Barret! Cid!”\n\nBarret: “O, oh…… is that okay with you?”\n\nCloud: “Red XIII!”\n\nTifa: “Why didn’t you tell me!?”\n\nRed XIII: “But, you know, Cid.”\n\nCid: “Hey, Red XIII.\n\nIf you butt in now, you never know what they’ll say later……”\n\nTifa: “……Were you watching?”\n\n[She quickly walks away before collapsing to the floor in embarrassment, her hands on her head, while Cloud, Cid and Barret all scratch their heads in embarrassment and Red XIII swishes his tail]\n\n—\n\n(Low Affection version transcription)\n\n—\n\n[Below the Highwind]\n\nTifa: “Everyone’s gone…”\n\nCloud: “Yeah, we don’t have anywhere or anyone to go home to.”\n\nTifa: “You’re right…\n\nBut… I’m sure someday… they’ll come back, don’t you think?”\n\nCloud: “Hmm… I wonder…?\n\nEveryone has an irreplaceable something they’re holding on to…\n\nBut this time, our opponent…”\n\nTifa: “Hmm… But that’s all right, even if no one comes back.\n\nAs long as I’m with you… As long as you’re by my side… I won’t give up even if I’m scared.”\n\nCloud: “………Tifa……”\n\nTifa: “No matter how close we are… We were far apart… before this.\n\nBut when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice…\n\n…sniff… you probably don’t remember this…\n\nBut deep in my heart I heard you calling my name… Or at least I thought I did…”\n\nCloud: “I see……\n\nI think I’ve heard about it, too.\n\nAt that time, it was Tifa’s voice……”\n\nTifa: “Cloud…? Do you think the stars can hear us?\n\nDo you think they see how hard we’re fighting for them?”\n\nCloud: “I dunno… But…\n\nWhether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves…\n\nI’ll find the answer someday. As long as I keep trying.”\n\nTifa: “Yeah…… that’s right…”\n\nCloud: “We’ve got a big battle tomorrow, we’d better get some sleep…”\n\nTifa: “Umm. Yes, I guess you’re right……”\n\n[Fade to black; the screen fades in early the next morning, with Tifa leaning against Cloud, asleep]\n\nCloud: “…………It’s almost dawn…”\n\nTifa: “H, huh…?”\n\nCloud: “Morning, Tifa. It’s almost dawn…”\n\nTifa: “Mmm…… Good morning, Cloud.\n\nGive me a little longer… Just a little big longer…\n\nThis day will never come again… So let me have this moment…”\n\nCloud: “…………”\n\n[The screen fades out once again, then fades back in to the sun fully risen and the two fully awake]\n\nTifa: “………”\n\nCloud: “We’d better go.”\n\nTifa: “But, I still…!?”\n\nCloud: “It’s all right, Tifa.

If a character’s response to a line chosen is positive, you can probably expect that their affection rating has increased. In addition, behavior involving the party exhibited during battles (such as healing or covering during a moment of crisis) can increase the rating as well, but the effect is very small in comparison to the dialogue choices.\n\nHow do the affection ratings influence events? Let’s look at some examples.\n\n[Screenshot of the “slum drunk” question in Aerith’s church]\n\nIf a positive selection is made when a choice appears, the affection rating will increase.\n\n[Screenshot of Cloud covering Aerith during a random battle]\n\nThe roster of the party at certain times and behavior during battle also have a small influence.\n\nMercurial Event 1 (The Companion)\n\nDuring the first visit to the Gold Saucer, if one tries to make Cloud walk around alone, the female character with the highest affection rating at that point will go along.\n\n[Screenshot of the party standing in the lobby of the Gold Saucer]\n\nDon’t speak to anyone here. Try to advance while ignoring all members.\n\n[Screenshot of Aerith stepping forward to tag along with Cloud]\n\nIf one tries to make Cloud go elsewhere, someone will go along after him like this (and be added to the party roster).\n\nMercurial Event 2 (The Date)\n\nThe large event after obtaining the Keystone. That night, the character with the highest affection rating will come to Cloud with an invitation. Although the examples below feature Aerith and Tifa, Yuffie and Barret are also available.\n\n[Screenshot of Aerith retrieving Cloud from his hotel room]\n\nAerith’s event. If one plays normally, she usually shows up.\n\n[Screenshot of the fireworks during the date with Aerith]\n\nOn the gondola. The line “I’m searching for you” has deep meaning (you get it, right?).\n\n[Screenshot of Cloud and Tifa on the gondola ride]\n\nTifa’s event. Her cautious personality foils her, and she doesn’t share her feelings.\n\n[Screenshot of Cloud and Tifa coming off the gondola ride]\n\nIn the end, she doesn’t voice her intentions.

As noted in Terence Fergusson’s Date Mechanics Guide, the “slum drunk” question actually doesn’t affect anyone’s affection value, and it’s also possible that Red XIII will stand in for Barret during the first visit to the Gold Saucer if Barret’s affection value is higher than that of the females. Furthermore, due to an apparent programming oversight, actions taken in battle have no impact whatsoever on the date mechanics.]\n\nSecondly, pg. 467 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega says the following:\n\n—\n\n“ULTIMANIA COLUMN The other events influenced by the affection ratings\n\nThe following two scenes change according to developments in the affection ratings, in the same manner as the date event.\n\n●When visiting the Gold Saucer for the first time…….If one attempts to move to another map alone, the character with the highest affection rating will come forward to go along (→126).\n\n●The conversation with Tifa the night before the final battle……If the degree of Tifa’s affection is above a certain value, there is a variation in the exchange between the two (→201)。\n\n[Screenshot of Red XIII accompanying Cloud after the first arrival at the Gold Saucer]\n\nIn the event that Barret’s affection rating is the highest during the visit to the Gold Saucer, Red XIII will step forward to be his substitute.\n\n[Screenshot of Tifa collapsing in embarrassment on the deck of the Highwind]\n\nAlso take notice of Tifa’s reaction to being teased by Cid and co.

This is confirmed in several official statements, one of which is found on pg. 27 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega, in Tifa’s profile:\n\n—\n\nWhen Cloud proposes that the group separates temporarily, she remains behind at the airship and communicates her feelings together with Cloud. The next morning, she departs for the Northern Crater along with her companions, who returned.\n\n“Words aren’t the only thing that tell people what you’re thinking……”\n\n—Said to Cloud, when he is at a loss for words while they’re alone\n\nIf Tifa’s affection regarding Cloud is high, when the two stay behind at the airship, they will confirm their feelings of desire/wanting for one another together. This line is said by Tifa at the conversation’s end. Immediately after saying it, Tifa forms a striking smile that summarizes everything.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドの提案で一時解散することになるが、飛空艇に残り、クラウドと想いを通わせる。翌朝、もどってきた仲間とともに北の大空洞へ発つ\n\n「想いをつたえられるのは言葉だけじゃないよ……」\n\nーふたりきりになり、言葉に詰まるクラウド\n\nティファのクラウドに対する好感度が高い場合、飛空艇に残ったふたりは、互いを求める気持ちを確かめ合う。このセリフは、そんな会話の最後にティファが口にするもの。告げ た直後にティファが浮かべる、すべてを受けいれるような微笑みが印象的だ。\n\n—\n\nFor those interested, by the way, the significant line quoted above as written in Japanese romaji — is as follows: “Tifa no Cloud ni taisuru koukan do ga takai baai, hikuutei ni nokotta futari ha, tagai wo motomeru kimochi wo tashikame au.” It breaks down thus:\n\n—\n\nTifa = Tifa, obviously\n\nno = particle indentifying possessive “of” or “for”\n\nCloud = Cloud, obviously\n\nni taisuru = “with regard to” or “concerning”\n\nkoukan = “affection”\n\ndo = “rating”\n\nga = identifies that the previous noun or clause is a subject\n\ntakai = high\n\nbaai = “occasion” or “circumstance,” so, for this sentence, “in the event that”\n\nhikuutei = “airship”\n\nni = particle identifying a place where something occurs “in” or “at”\n\nnokotta = “remained”\n\nfutari = two people, so, for this sentence, “the two”\n\nha = main subject identifier; here, it’s identifying everything said up to now\n\ntagai = “each other”\n\nwo = particle indicating that the previous noun or clause is the target of an action to follow\n\nmotomeru = “to want” or “to seek”; refers to something actively wanted/desired\n\nkimochi = “feelings”; modified by “motomeru,” the sentence is talking about “feelings of desire” or “feelings of wanting,” which are being directed toward whatever noun preceded the “wo” that preceded “motomeru”; in this case, “tagai”/”each other”\n\nwo = another target of action identifier; tells us that “feelings of wanting each other” is the recepient of some as-yet unidentified action\n\ntashikame = “confirmation”; tells us that the “feelings of wanting each other” are confirmed\n\nau = “to fit,” “to harmonize” or “to match”; as this verb modifies everything that came before, it’s probably best translated here as “together”\n\n—\n\nAs you can see, here it is said that they confirm feelings of desire for one another. While that alone may not sufficiently allude to something of an intimate nature occurring in that scene, an exchange during an interview in the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (pg. 9 of both the original and Revised Edition) does. Here, Kazushige Nojima describes the scene as containing a risque line of dialogue, referring to Tifa’s “words aren’t the only way” line.\n\nHe also goes on to describe the original presentation of the scene, which was even more suggestive:\n\n(translation by hitoshura)\n\n—\n\nKitase: “Katou also did the event on the airship, the night before the final battle.”\n\nNojima: “Oh, the scene with the risqué line of dialogue? It was\n\nKatou who wrote that as well, not me.”\n\n―”The line ‘Words aren’t the only way to tell someone how you feel,’ right? That was quite a mature conversation for a FF game.”\n\nKitase: “But I remember having to get another version that was too intense toned down.”\n\nNojima: “The original idea was more extreme. The plan was to have Cloud walk out of the Chocobo stable on board the Highwind, followed by Tifa leaving while checking around, but Kitase turned it down. But even with the line in question, maybe at that time none of us thought it would be something so important (laughs).”\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n北瀬 決戦前夜の飛空艇でのエベントも加藤さんですよね。\n\n野島 ああ、きわどいセリフがあところですか？あれを書いたのも、僕ではなくて加藤さんです。\n\n―「想いをつたえられるのは、言葉だけじゃないよ」というセリフですね。『FF』としては、かなり大人っぼい会話でした。\n\n北瀬 それでも、あまりにもどぎつい表現は抑えてもらった覚えがありますね。\n\n野島 当初のアイデアは、もっと過激でしたから。飛空艇のなかにあるチョコボ部屋からクラウドが先に出てきて、そのあとティファが周囲をうかがいながら出てくるっていう案 だったんですけど、それはさすがに北瀬さんが却下してました。でも、問題のセリフにしても、当時はそんなに重要なことだと誰も思ってなかったのかもしれない（ 笑）。\n\n—\n\nAlso notable here to the topic at hand is the reference to Masato Katou, whom Kazushige Nojima referred to as the one who wrote the dialogue in this part of the game.\n\nKatou would soon after pen another Square-developed RPG, “Xenogears” — a game which contains a scene near its ending very similar to the High Affection scene with Cloud and Tifa. In this love scene from “Xenogears,” some of the dialogue even recalls the High Affection Highwind scene (YouTube upload courtesy of Chilavert2010):\n\nNote the similarities to the High Affection Highwind scene in the fade to black immediately prior to intimacy, and the male character saying to the female character “Sorry. Did I wake you?” the next morning.\n\nThe question now becomes, “Which scene is canon?” Based on the descriptions of the two on pg. 198 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega, we know that in one version (the Low Affection version) the conversation is candid/apathetic — i.e. lacking in feelings — and was contrasted against a scene with meaningful contents.\n\nLet us also note at this time that it is Tifa’s affection level for Cloud that is said to influence the outcome of events. That alone is a significant observation in analyzing this scene.\n\nFurthermore, let us not forget that — despite the game mechanic provided to us with the affection values — Tifa always loves Cloud romantically within the actual story.\n\nGiven what we know thus far, it is actually a very simple matter to determine which scene is canon, as numerous official sources tell us that Cloud and Tifa shared feelings on that evening. We’ll now go over those sources, in order of their chronological release.\n\nThe first source is pg. 14 of the FFVII Kaitai Shinsho The Complete guide, in the Analects of Tifa section of her profile:\n\n—\n\n“Words aren’t the only thing that tell people what you’re thinking” (when she and Cloud are alone the night before the final battle)\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n「想いを伝えられるのは言葉だけじゃないよ」（最終決戦前夜、クラウドとふたりきりのときに）\n\n—\n\nNext is pg. 15 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega, in Cloud’s profile. There, the following is said:\n\n—\n\nDeclares that the team should dissolve in the final hours before the final battle, and communicates his feelings together with Tifa, who remains behind at the airship with him.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n最終決戦を前に一時解散を宣言し、飛空艇に残ったティファと想いを通わせる。\n\n—\n\nAs mentioned above, in Tifa’s profile on pg. 27 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega, we’re also told that feelings were exchanged that evening:\n\n“When Cloud proposes that the group separates temporarily, she remains behind at the airship and communicates her feelings together with Cloud.\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドの提案で一時解散することになるが、飛空艇に残り、クラウドと想いを通わせる。\n\n—\n\nNext, pg. 198 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega:\n\n—\n\nWhen their companions disperse to the places where people important to them await, Cloud and Tifa are the only two to remain behind. They reveal their feelings for each other in their final hours, and…….\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n大切な人の待つ場所へと仲間が散っていき、ふたりきりになたクラドとティファ。残された最後の時間でお互いの想いを打ち明け、そして……。\n\n—\n\nAnd then pg. 33 of the Crisis Core Ultimania, in Tifa’s profile from that book:\n\n—\n\nShe communicates her feelings together with Cloud in the final stages of the story, and in AC and DC they live together.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドとは物語の終盤に想いを通わせ、「AC」「DC」の時代は一緒に暮らしている。\n\n—\n\nPg. 118 of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (pg. 120 of the book’s Revised Edition; scan courtesy of Quexinos), in its Story Playback segment for FFVII:\n\n—\n\nCloud and Tifa, who remain, reveal their feelings for each\n\nother and clarify them together.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n残ったクラウドとティファは、互いへの想いを打ち明け、確かめ合う。\n\n—\n\nThis statement, by the way, is made next to a numbered notation that is matched to a numbered screenshot from the High Affection version of the Highwind scene: Cloud and Tifa are shown sleeping together in the early morning with Cloud saying “This is probably the last time we’ll have together……” — a line he only says in the High Affection version of the scene.\n\nPg. 195 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 1: Character guide; the Impressive Words section of Tifa’s profile:\n\n—\n\n“Words aren’t the only thing that tell people what you’re thinking…”\n\n—Prarie: What she said to Cloud the night before the final battle when he said there were many things he wanted to talk about\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n「想いを伝えられるのは言葉だけじゃないよ……」\n\n——荒野：最終決戦を前に、話したいことは多いが言葉に詁まるクラウドに\n\n—\n\nNext, let’s look at pg. 232 of the Final Fantasy 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario guide. There, in this book’s Story Playback section for FFVII, we find this line:\n\n—\n\nAnd when Cloud and Tifa remain behind alone, in their final hours, they reveal their feelings for each other together.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nそして、ふたり、きりになったクラウドとティファは、残された最後の時間で互いの想いを打ち明け合う。\n\n—\n\nAnd for those following the Japanese romaji constructions: “Soshite, futari, kiri ni natta Cloud to Tifa ha, nokosareta saigo no jikan de tagai no omoi wo uchi ake au.”\n\nYou’ll notice, by the way, that the Japanese form of this line is constructed almost identically to the line in the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania, which was unquestionably referring to the High Affection scene. The only notable difference is that the 10th Anniversary Ultimania’s statement includes 確かめ (“tashikame,” meaning “confirmation”) before the verb 合う (“au”). As such, it’s certainly reasonable to conclude that those who wrote the two books would expect us to believe both are describing the same development.\n\nFurther still, in the sidebar to the right of the primary passage in which the above quote appears, following one of the story summary’s several “Deviation” (分岐) arrows, we find the following:\n\n(translation by hitoshura)\n\n—\n\nDeviation\n\nThere are 2 versions of the conversation before the final battle. The conversation between Cloud and Tifa before the final battle will differ depending on Tifa’s degree of affection. If her affection value is high, the content of their conversation will be deep, showing that they strongly care for each other. Also, in the scene where Tifa is embarrassed to discover the next morning that the team were watching her and Cloud, her reaction when her affection is high is greater.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n分岐\n\n決戦前の会話は2種粨ある\n\n決戦前にクラウドとティファが交わす会話の内容は、ティファの好感度によって変わる。好感度が高いと、ふたりの会話が、お互いを強く思いやるような深い内容になるのだ。ま た、ふたりの樣子を仲間たちが見ていたことが翌朝発覚し、ティファが照れる場面では、好感度の高いときのほうが、彼女の照れかたが大きい 。\n\n—\n\nWhile acknowledging the existence of another version of the scene, the main body of the story summary itself used the High Affection version in its description of events, and even this blurb doesn’t bother with describing the Low Affection version — which, again, was described elsewhere as containing a conversation that lacked feelings.\n\nThe description of the High Affection version here implicitly contrasts it against a scene with a conversation lacking in deep subject matter, while the description of the Low Affection version from pg. 198 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega implicitly contrasts it against a version that features a conversation containing feelings — the message being clear that the conversation from the High Affection version is mutually exclusive from a version lacking deep subject matter, while the conversation from the Low Affection version is mutually exclusive from a version in which feelings are discussed.\n\nThose descriptions align perfectly with what we witness in the two versions, as seen in the game. Cloud definitely doesn’t communicate his feelings to Tifa in the Low Affection scenario; certainly none that are about her — and especially none that appear to match her own feelings of desire. He just listens to her talk and then says they should get some sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, in the High Affection version, he has quite a bit to say and is left trying to find the words to communicate “a lot of things I wanted to talk to you about” when Tifa suggests they employ a physical demonstration.\n\nGiven, then, that we are told numerous times — including in passages that don’t mention the different versions of the scene; and, in the case of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania, a book that doesn’t mention the different versions of the scene anywhere between its covers — that feelings were exchanged between Cloud and Tifa that evening, the High Affection version must have taken place.\n\nIt also bears acknowledgement at this point that the phrases “communicate their feelings ” (想いを通わせる) and “reveal their feelings for each other” (互いの想いを打ち明け) carry the same connotation that “realized their feelings for each other” does in English, particularly when the Japanese word for “feelings” (“omoi”) is rendered as it is here: “想い.” This kanji for “omoi” is typically used to denote intimate feelings, while feelings in general tend to be represented with the other kanji for “omoi”: 思い.\n\nYou need not take my word alone on that, by the way.\n\nNot only are you free to look into the matter yourself, but if you fear a bias on my part coloring my reading of those phrases, I also ask that you look to insight provided by Michael DePaula at AllExperts.com, whose expertise stems from some 10 years of experience with the Japanese language, most of which were spent in Japan. TheLifestream.net forum member Quexinos brought the matter to him for input, providing the quote from pg. 33 of the Crisis Core Ultimania, and was presented the following explanation:\n\n“It’s better to use 伝える for normal exchanges. 想いを通わせる implies something intimate.”\n\nQuexinos also took the question to masaegu, a Japanese native at JapanForum.com, supplying the same quote from the CC Ultimania. She was told: “The sentence in question is clearly about a romantic relationship,” and masaegu even went so far as to say “Show me a native Japanese-speaker that thinks the sentence … is NOT about a romantic relationship, I will show you a liar.”\n\nConcerning “omoi,” masaegu also added:\n\n“Basically, it is only a matter of aesthetic preference between 思 and 想. Since many prefer using the latter, it has kind of become the normal choice in talking about love or something very important.”\n\nAmong the most definitive statements of all comes on pg. 394 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario guide, in a section entitled “For the One I Love.” There, scenes of romantic declaration from throughout the Final Fantasy series (i.e. entries in the main game series that had been published by the time of the book’s own publication) are presented.\n\nHere is my translation of that page:\n\n—\n\nFor the One I Love\n\nThrough the long journeys, the love of the protagonists develop.

Tidus decides to comfort her in this way.\n\nExtra Thread\n\nScenes involving “love” other than romantic love\n\nIn the FF series, there’s not just the romantic love between men and women; there are various forms of love depicted. In FFV, there’s familial love between Galuf and Krile, as well as the brotherly love between Edgar and Sabin depicted in FFVI; and in FFIX, there’s an instance of love between Eiko and Mog that goes beyond race. Also, in FFVI, there’s the scene where Terra recovers her ability to fight and comes to understand the emotion called “love”; when talking about “love,” this is a scene that shouldn’t be left out.\n\n[Screenshot caption beneath the screenshot of Terra after transforming into\n\nher Esper form in the World of Ruin]\n\nDuring the event where Terra recovers her ability to fight, she regains her power and says “I’ll fight to protect the people I love”; she then throws herself back into battle.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n『愛する人のために』\n\n長い旅を通じて築かれる、主人公たちの恋愛感情。ときにはふたりが引き裂かれることもあるが、お互いを大事に想っていればどんな難局でも乗り越えていけるという気持ちは、 彼らに大きな力を与えてくれる。\n\n[Screenshot of Sara and Ingus from the ending of the DS version of FFIII]\n\n「III」真面目な兵士と素直な姫\n\nサスーン城の兵士と姫という身分ちがいの恋に、イングスは自分の気持ちを押し殺そうとするが、サラは彼への想いを隠そうとしない。\n\n[Screenshot from when Cecil rescues Rosa from Golbez]\n\n「IV」ふたりだけの世界\n\n捕らわれていたローザを救い出したとき、セシルは自分の本心を打ち明ける。再会したふたりは、人目も気にせず強く抱き合った。\n\n[Screenshot from when the Espers are making peace with General Leo]\n\n「VI」すれちがいの果てに\n\n帝国の将軍と反帝国組織の一員 — お互いの立場ゆえにすれちがっていたセリスとロックは、長い期間を経てようやく想いを通わせた。\n\n[Screenshot of Aerith’s date with Cloud at the Gold Saucer]\n\n「VII」秘密のデート\n\nゴ―ルドソーサーで仲間のひとりから誘いを受けりクラウド。誰が誘いにやってくるかは、それまでのクラウドの行動しだい。\n\n[Screenshot of Cloud and Tifa underneath the Highwind]\n\n「VII」最終決戦前夜に\n\nティファのおかげで自分を取り戻したクラウドはセフィロスとの最後の戦いを前に言葉では伝えられない想いを彼女と確かめ合う。\n\n[Screenshot of Squall and Rinoa hugging inside the Sorceress Memorial]\n\n「VIII」魔女リノアの騎士\n\n魔女として封印される直前のリノアを、無心で奪還するスコ―ル。「魔女でもいいさ」\n\nという彼の言葉は、リノアの心に安らぎを与えた。\n\n[Screenshot of Steiner and Beatrix preparing to defend Alexandria from\n\nKuja’s invasion]\n\n「IX」守るべき者のため\n\nひょんなことから、スタイナーにとってベアトリクスはかけがえのない女性となった。祖国と彼女を守るため、スタイナーは剣を振るう。\n\n[Screenshot of Zidane and Dagger reunited during the game’s ending]\n\n「IX」生命のしらべに導かれ\n\nイーファの樹で仲間の前から姿を消したジタン。彼は「いつか帰るところ」へ帰るために生きのび、愛いい人の待つ場所にもどってきた。\n\n[Screenshot of Yuna and Tidus together in the Macalania spring]\n\n「X」マカラニ―アの泉で\n\nずっと信じていた寺院に裏切られユウナは心のよりどころを矢った。ティ―ダは、そんな彼女を支えていくことを決意する。\n\n番外編\n\n恋愛以外の「愛」に関する場面\n\n「FF」シリーズでは男女間の恋愛だけでなく、さまざまな形の「愛」が描かれている。「FFV」におけるガラフとクルルをはじめとした家族愛や、「FFVI」のエドガーとマッシュのような兄弟愛、「FFIX」のエーコとモグのような種族を越えた情愛なだがその一例だ。また、「FFVI」においてティナが「愛」という感情を知ることで戦う力を取りもどすシ―ンは、「愛」そのものを語るうえで、はずせない場面のひとつだろう。\n\n[Screenshot caption beneath the screenshot of Terra after transforming into\n\nher Esper form in the World of Ruin]\n\n一度は戦う力を矢ったティナは、「愛する者のために戦う」ということを知って力を取りもどし、ふたりび戦いに身を投じる。\n\n—\n\nAlso, for those who may be interested in the romaji construction of the pivotal line here (“Thanks to Tifa, Cloud regains himself, and before the final battle with Sephiroth, he confirms with her feelings that can’t be expressed in words”), it is as follows: “Tifa no okagede jibun wo tori modoshita Cloud ha Sephiroth tono saigo no tatakai wo maeni kotoba deha tsutaerarenai omoi wo kanojo to tashikame au.”\n\nNot only is the statement plainly made here that the event in question happened, and without qualifying the matter on the basis of the date mechanics, but you’ll also notice that the Japanese text in the caption about Locke and Celes uses the same “communicated their feelings” (想いを通わせた) phrasing that was used several times in regard to Cloud and Tifa.\n\nFurther, we’re asked to connect this romantic description of the scene to the Story Playback’s summary of FFVII earlier in the book. Tifa’s line in the accompanying screenshot on the “For the One I Love” page (“This day will never come again… So let me have this moment…”) is quoted in floating text on pg. 232 below the summary of the scene and next to a screenshot of Cloud and Tifa under the Highwind.\n\nSure, the quote itself appears in both versions of the scene, but the obvious connection being drawn between the story summary and the “For the One I Love” page is asking to be pointed out.\n\nWhile on the subject of the “communicated their feelings” phrase, please note also this passage from Rinoa’s profile on pg. 135 of the FF 25th Memorial Ultimania Vol. 2:\n\n—\n\nA friendly and cheerful young woman, part of the resistance group called the Forest Owls, whose goal is the liberation of Timber. She joins in Squall and co.’s activities when they are dispatched by SeeD, and also participates in the witch assassination plot, which she wasn’t supposed to be involved with. During the conflict, she inherits the powers of a witch from Edea; she begin to fear that she will become an enemy of the whole world, but Squall communicated his feelings to her and protects her as she faces Ultimecia.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nティンバー独立を目指すレジスタンス「森のフクロウ」に身を置く、人なつっこくて快活な少女。 SeeDとして派遣されたスコールたちと行動をともにし、自身の当初の目的ではない魔女討伐作戦にも協力。戦いのさなかイデアから魔女の力を継承してしまい、自分が世界中の人々の敵となることに恐れを抱くが、想いを通わせたスコールに守られつつアルティミシアに立ち向かう。\n\n—\n\nAlong that same vein, consider as well this line about FFIX’s Beatrix and Steiner from pg. 241 of the same book:\n\n(translation by hitoshura)\n\n—\n\nA Love That Started With A Misunderstanding\n\nTo Beatrix, Steiner is the one opponent who has defeated her, and they both harbour a rivalry towards each other. But after mistaking Eiko’s love letter for one sent to them from each other, they start to take notice of one another and in the ending make their feelings known.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n恋のはじまりはカンちがいから\n\nベアトリクスにとってスタイナーはただ一度敗北を喫した相手であり、双方ともに対抗意識を燃やしていた。だが、エーコのラブレターを互いが互いに宛てたものだ とカンちがいして以来、ふたりは意識し合うようになり、エンディングで想いを通わせる。\n\n—\n\nThe same phrase appears once again with regard to Tidus and Yuna’s moment of revelation to one another on pg. 60 of the FFX Ultimania Omega, in its Story Playback for that game:\n\n—\n\nAt the mysterious spring that glitters like the stars, the two kiss and embrace many times, confirming their feelings for one another.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n星をのようにきらめく神秘の泉のなで、ふたりは、互いの想いを確かめ合うかのように幾度も抱擁し、唇を重ねた。\n\n—\n\nLikewise, the phrase appears for Cecil and Rosa’s moment of revelation on pg. 110 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario guide in FFIV’s Story Playback section:\n\n—\n\nReunited safely, Rosa and Cecil embrace one another, confirming their feelings for each other.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n無事に再会を果たしたローザとセシルは、思わず抱き合ってお互いの想いを確かめる。\n\n—\n\nThe similar phrase, “reveals feelings”/想いを打ち明けられる (recall that it has been used for Cloud and Tifa as well) is used for FFVIII’s Zell and Library Girl with a Pigtail on pg. 141 of the FF 25th Memorial Ultimania Vol. 2:\n\n(translation by hitoshura)\n\n—\n\nRomance with the Library Girl with a Pigtail\n\nDespite being seen as a troublemaker by the faculty, he is fairly popular with the students and people of Balamb. In particular, the member of the library committee with a pigtail likes him, and eventually she reveals her feelings to him.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n三つ編みの図書委員とのロマンス\n\n教師陣からは問題児あつかいされているものの、生徒やバラムの人々からの人気はそこそこ。なかでも三つ編みの図書委員には好意を持たれており、やがて彼女から 想いを打ち明けられる。\n\n—\n\nNow, ask yourself: What’s more likely? That all of these similar — and often identical(!) — choices of phrasing refer to the same thing, or that Cloud and Tifa are an arbitrary exception to the commonplace understanding of phrases being used in their commonplace context to describe no less than five other Final Fantasy couples — four of whom were also featured on the “For the One I Love” page?\n\nKeep in mind, too, that we’re discussing quotes from guide books — the purpose of which is presumably to *guide* the reader to an understanding of what took place on the screen. This isn’t a religious text written in metaphorical prose with ambiguous phrasing. It’s not even a literary composition that can stand alone and be valued on its own; it is a companion to such a composition. A guide book’s purpose is to tell you what you need to know to understand the primary work.\n\nIf the writer(s) of these guide books (repeatedly!) use this idiom that has a romantic connotation, and they’re using it to (repeatedly!) describe the same situation — one with a verified romantic context, at that — it stands to reason that the romantic connotation is an intended element of the understanding we’re being guided to.\n\nThere may be nothing inherently romantic in the idiom “communicated their feelings to each other,” but there isn’t anything inherently romantic in the English idiom “realized their feelings for each other ” either — yet because of the common usage they see in literary contexts, they are romantic phrases. They would not be used in a situation that could be taken for romantic unless the understanding of a romantic element was intended.\n\nLook at all these phrases that have meanings different from what the words “inherently” mean (we’ll ignore for the moment how preposterous it is to ever assume inherent meaning for *any* symbol):\n\n“This car is moving at a snail’s pace”\n\n“You have some bats in your belfry”\n\n“He kicked the bucket”\n\n“He bought the farm”\n\n“You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink”\n\n“It’s my way or the highway”\n\n“One bad apple spoils the whole bunch”\n\n“Shout it from the rooftops”\n\n“They know where their bread is buttered”\n\n“Birds of a feather flock together”\n\n“Dude is going postal”\n\n“When dad found my stash, he hit the roof”\n\n“She’s a bad egg”\n\n“He’s the big cheese”\n\n“Things are about to hit the fan”\n\n“If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”\n\n“A decent movie, but nothing to write home about”\n\n“I overheard them while dropping some eaves”\n\n“The automobile industry was Detroit’s bread and butter”\n\n“You can tell who rules the roost in this house” (or “wears the pants”)\n\n“His plan was like a house of cards”\n\n“Time to ride off into the sunset”\n\n“Now you’re cooking with gas”\n\n“You can’t get blood from a stone”\n\n“That’s the ticket”\n\n“Don’t cry over spilled milk”\n\n“We’re just chewing the fat “\n\n“Half-assed efforts aren’t going to cut the mustard”\n\n“Life ain’t a bed of roses”\n\n“We can’t rest on our laurels”\n\n“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”\n\n“I’m cool as a cucumber”\n\n“You’re comparing apples and oranges”\n\n“A little bird told me”\n\n“You reap what you sow”\n\n“He’s loaded for bear”\n\n“It’s ten miles as the crow flies”\n\n“We’re beating a dead horse”\n\n“This music is driving me up the wall”\n\n“He said some really off-the-wall stuff”\n\n“His elevator doesn’t go all the way to the top”\n\n“A stitch in time saves nine”\n\n“What got your panties in a twist?”\n\n“People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones”\n\n“The lights are on, but nobody’s home”\n\n“They’ve got him between a rock and a hard place”\n\n“My back is to the wall”\n\n“What you said really hit home”\n\n“The family has some skeletons in their closet”\n\n“Charity begins at home”\n\n“That’s water under the bridge”\n\n“What are you doing in this neck of the woods?”\n\nAnd there’s about 25,000 more of them in the English language alone — few of which would make sense to anyone who’s applying the literal meanings of the words involved. None of these idioms exist (at least not with the same wording) in Japanese.\n\nThat language had a separate origin, developed differently, was used by a different culture, and its own idioms came along. As with the English idioms, many of these would make no sense to someone applying the literal meanings of the words. For example, 猫に小判 (“neko ni koban”). The literal meaning of the words is “gold coins to a cat.” The meaning of the phrase involves something being given to someone who can’t appreciate it.\n\nIn other words, it’s equivalent to the English idiom, “casting pearls before swine.” Same meaning, different phrases. Like “communicated their feelings to each other” (Japanese) and “realized their feelings for each other” (English).\n\nThink of it like the English idiom “It’s a small world,” and its Spanish counterpart “El mundo es un pañuelo” (literally: “The world is a handkerchief”).\n\nAs TheLifestream.net forum member hitoshura once put it, Japanese is “a different language; it’s not just some version of English with squiggly shapes.”\n\nThe point being: A writer worth their salt is going to know the idioms of their own language, especially if writing a book intended for informative purposes. Put simply, they would not use the “communicate their feelings” phrase to refer to the moment two brothers were reunited after being separated for 10 years, just as a writer whose native language is English would not describe that same situation by saying “The reunited brothers realized their feelings for each other.”\n\nUnless, of course, they were specifically telling a romantic story about two brothers.\n\nIf I were to write a review of the film “Antwone Fisher” and said “In the film’s final moments, Antwone is at last reunited with his long-lost family in a moving love scene,” you’d be understandably taken aback. Is it a scene in which love is expressed? Yes. Is it a love scene? No. “Love scene” refers to something very specific in film, despite the words alone not lending to that understanding.\n\nThe same is true of two people “realizing their feelings for each other”— or “communicating their feelings to each other.”\n\nAdded to all that, keep in mind the target audience for Final Fantasy VII — and Final Fantasy in general — is a teenage-to-20-something audience. We know this because Yoshinori Kitase, the current executive producer of the Final Fantasy series and director of FFVII, said as much in a May 2009 interview with Edge magazine:\n\n—\n\nWe ask Kitase if, as he settles into his 40s, he ever thinks about those members of the Final Fantasy audience who have also grown up with the series. After all, even those players who only joined the fanbase with the seventh game in the series, the first to make a truly global impact, are now entering their 30s. Surely the expectations of these players and the things that they look out for in games are different now to what they were ten, 15 years ago. Is Square Enix interested in changing the tone or theme or style its output to meet these changing needs of the audience?\n\n“I actually think that it’s a very natural thing for players to grow out of the Final Fantasy series,” he answers. “In terms of the age group we target with each new game, it remains the teens to 20-somethings. That said, you’re right in saying that some of our staff have been working on the series for many years. They are having new experiences and growing and they inevitably do bring those new ideas and perspectives to their work. In Final Fantasy XIII, for example, we have a greater spread of older characters in the story than we have had in the past. Satzu is older, has a family and is not really the kind of character one would normally encounter or play as in the series. But, that said, I think it’s better that we keep the focus on the young generation rather than ageing the series’ appeal. If players choose to stick around and continue playing the games as they grow older then that’s great, but hopefully new generations will find the appeal, grow up with the series and then pass that down to the next generation as they themselves grow older”.\n\n—\n\nGuide books meant to convey information to a teenage audience are not going to be written in such a counterintuitive manner as to require a Phd. to decipher.\n\nAs TheLifestream.net forum member Vendel noted:\n\n—\n\nCertain segments of the FFVII fandom get the idea that this is some kind of puzzle to be worked out. Why would SE put out a guidebook that you are supposed to “find clues” in and piece together?\n\nTake for example the FTOIL page. What kind of screwball half-assed operation would put a bunch of text on a page if you are just supposed to ignore it and instead focus on one picture and a number that leads to a different page with the text we are supposed to be reading?\n\nWhy have so many instances of romantic phrases used for Cloud and Tifa if we are supposed to ignore the obvious meanings in all of them and instead use some sort of alternate interpretation?\n\n—\n\nVendel has also made the following, related observation:\n\n—\n\nThis line of reasoning bothers me. It assumes that the creators are putting all this effort into making us work for the answer. As if Cloud’s love life is a Riddler Trophy the fandom needs to figure out. It also assumes that Cloud’s love life is as important to them as it is to certain segments of the fandom.\n\nThe logical extension of this is the “SE would never answer a question as big as the LTD, the great mystery of FFVII, in an Ultimania. They need to hold a press conference to answer it properly-type responses.\n\n—\n\nFor the sake of simple digestion and recapping, here now is a collection of all eight lines which refer to the sharing of feelings between Cloud and Tifa beneath the Highwind, cited in order of publication:\n\nFFVII Ultimania Omega, pg. 15; Cloud’s profile\n\n“Declares that the team should dissolve in the final hours before the final battle, and communicates his feelings together with Tifa, who remains behind at the airship with him.”\n\nFFVII Ultimania Omega, pg. 27; Tifa’s profile\n\n“When Cloud proposes that the group separates temporarily, she remains behind at the airship and communicates her feelings together with Cloud.”\n\nFFVII Ultimania Omega, pg. 27; Tifa’s profile\n\n“If Tifa’s affection regarding Cloud is high, when the two stay behind at the airship, they will confirm their feelings of desire/wanting for one another.”\n\nFFVII Ultimania Omega, pg. 198; Story Playback section\n\n“When their companions disperse to the places where people important to them await, Cloud and Tifa are the only two to remain behind. They reveal their feelings for each other in their final hours, and…….”\n\nCrisis Core Ultimania, pg. 33; Tifa’s profile\n\n“She communicates her feelings together with Cloud in the final stages of the story, and in AC and DC they live together.”\n\nFFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania, pg. 118 (pg. 120 in the Revised Edition); Story Playback section\n\n“Cloud and Tifa, who remain, reveal their feelings for each other and clarify them together.”\n\nFF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario, pg. 232; Story Playback section\n\n“And when Cloud and Tifa remain behind alone, in their final hours, they reveal their feelings for each other together.”\n\nFF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario, pg. 394; “For the One I Love” page\n\n“Thanks to Tifa, Cloud regains himself, and before the final battle with Sephiroth, he confirms with her feelings that can’t be expressed in words.”\n\nAs if all this weren’t enough to make the case for the High Affection Highwind scene impenetrable, 2003’s Final Fantasy VII International Memorial Album — an extended reprint of the original FFVII Memorial Album from 1999 — published by DigiCube (Square’s former publishing subsidiary), provides a scene-by-scene tour of the game’s script — and includes only the high affection version of this scene (pp. 241–242).\n\nThe same is true of Tifa’s card (card #068) from 2001’s Final Fantasy Art Museum trading card collection, which includes Tifa’s “Words aren’t the only thing that tell people what you’re thinking” line, as well as this parenthetical description of it: “(Night before the final battle, when she and Cloud are alone).”\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n「想いを伝えられるのは言葉だけじゃないよ……」\n\n(決戦前夜、クラウドと2人きりで)\n\n—\n\nLike the “For the One I Love” page, the card speaks of this version of events in definite terms — not qualified terms based on the player’s actions.\n\nI would also argue that Cloud’s warm greeting to Yuffie upon her return to the airship the morning after the night he spent with Tifa is an indication of the High Affection version taking place. At the least, Yuffie’s profile on pg. 39 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega mentions that his kind greeting is a result of the previous night:\n\n—\n\nBecause of Cloud’s proposal that each of them ascertain their reason to fight, she briefly leaves the airship. She goes back the next morning, and departs for the Northern Crater with her comrades.\n\n“Gee, Cloud…… that’s so nice of you to say that. ……You sick?”\n\n—To Cloud, who affectionately greets her when she returns to the airship\n\nYuffie is unaware that Cloud and Tifa had just spent the night together. Woman’s intuition is as perceptive as ever, no?\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドの提案で、自分が戦う理由を確かめるため、いったん飛空艇を降りる。翌朝もどり、仲間とともに北の空洞へ発つ\n\n「おろ～……クラウドやさしいねえ。なんかあった？」\n\n—飛空艇にもどった自分を優しく迎えるクラウドに\n\nユフィは知らないが、直前にクラウドはティファとふたりきりの夜を過ごしたばかり。さすが、女のカンは鋭い？\n\n—\n\nNothing about the conversation that Cloud and Tifa had in the Low Affection version of the scene would logically lend itself to Cloud’s mood being so much warmer. In the High Affection version, however — where he gets to express his feelings of desire to the woman he wants to be with, and where she reciprocates those feelings — he most certainly does.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, though, it does bear acknowledging that pg. 201 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega makes the point that Yuffie’s line is the same regardless of which version of the Highwind scene took place:\n\n—\n\nBefore the final battle……\n\nVariations determined by Tifa’s affection rating apply from the beginning of the evening with Cloud and Tifa on the grassland until the conversation where they reunite with their companions on the airship. If the affection rating is high, Cloud and Tifa convey their feelings in powerful lines.\n\nUpon returning to the airship, Yuffie will say “Gee, Cloud…… that’s so nice of you to say that. ……You sick?” regardless of the contents of their conversation.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n最終決戦を前に……\n\nクラウドとティファが草原で夜を明かし、飛空艇で仲間たちと合流するまでの会話は、ティファの好感度によって変化する。好感度が高いと、クラウドとティファの互いを想う気 持ちがセリフに強く表れるのだ。\n\n飛空艇にもどったユフィは、クラウドたちの会話内容にかかわらず「クラウドやさしいねえ。なんかあった？」と話す。\n\n—\n\nThe case for the High Affection scene’s canonicity builds ever further when one also considers pg. 280 of the Crisis Core Complete Guide, where a “Cloud & Tifa” entry appears in the book’s Keyword Collection. One of the images that represents them there is a screenshot from the High Affection version of the Highwind scene — of Tifa’s “Words aren’t the only thing …” line, in fact.\n\nYou’ll also notice that the other image that represents them on that page is a screenshot from the scene in Advent Children where Tifa lets Cloud have it. In other words, the two scenes of utmost open and honest communication between the two were selected to represent the two here, perhaps because failing to be straightforward with one another about their feelings has been the ongoing obstacle the two have struggled with since childhood.\n\nFor those interested, here’s a translation of the complete keyword entry, courtesy of hitoshura:\n\n—\n\nCloud and Tifa\n\nCloud and Tifa are childhood friends, both born in Nibelheim. When Cloud leaves the village, he calls Tifa out to the water tower and promises that he will become a SOLDIER. At the same time, he is also made by Tifa to promise that he will come to rescue her if she is ever in trouble.\n\nFollowing this, the pair experience many hardships, such as the\n\nNibelheim incident which appears in CC, and the Jenova War in FFVII, and through these the distance between them shortens. And in AC, they live together with Barret’s daughter Marlene and a boy named Denzel. Though there was also a period later where Cloud lived away from them after having contracted Geostigma, they finally reach a commune and return to living together once again. In DC, they rush together to Vincent’s aid, in his battle against Deep Ground SOLDIER.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドとティファ\n\nクラウドとティファはニブルヘイム出身の幼なじみである。クラウドは村を出る時、ティファを給水塔に呼び出し、ソルジャーになると約束。その際、ティファにピンチの時は助けに来るようにと約束させられている。以降は、本作でも描かれているニブルヘイム事件、『FFVII』のジェノバ戦役など、数々の紆余曲折を経て、2人の距離は縮まった。そして『AC』ではバレットの娘マリンとデンゼルという少年を含めて、エッジの街で4人一緒に暮らす。その後、クラウドが星痕症を発症した際、別居をしていた時期もあったが、最後には心を通い合わせ、再び共に暮らすようになった。なお『DC』では、2人一緒にディープグラウンドソルジャーと戦うヴィンセントのもとへかけつけている。\n\n—\n\nAs one more source reference for the High Affection version of the Highwind scene being Square Enix’s chosen outcome, we turn to pg. 199 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario guide. There, in FFVII’s Impressive Scenes section — selections of prominent scenes from each game covered by the book, for which it provides scripts of the chosen scenes — under a heading that reads “The two’s time alone before the final battle with Sephiroth” is the script of the High Affection version of the Highwind scene.\n\nFurthermore, it’s accompanied by two screenshots — one of Tifa saying the risque line from the High Affection version, and the other of Cloud and Tifa sleeping against each other the next morning. The Low Affection version of the scene, meanwhile, isn’t spoken of at all here.\n\nOnly four scenes from the game were selected for the Impressive Scenes section, the other three being a conversation between Cloud and Barret from the raid on the mako reactor at the beginning of the game, AVALANCHE’s first meeting with Rufus, and Aerith’s death scene. To be chosen out of all the scenes in the game to represent it here certainly tells us that the High Affection version of the Highwind scene is more than an easily dismissed alternative.\n\nThe Low Affection version, on the other hand, *is* an easily dismissed alternative.\n\nAs much as I hate to make a numbers game of this, even if one were to — for the sake of argument — treat as version-neutral those “communicate their feelings” and “reveal their feelings” quotes that don’t make more explicit reference to the High Affection version of events, official references to the High Affection version would still far outweigh references to the Low Affection version. This is true whether they are taken on their own or combined with the “version-neutral” references to the scene.\n\nHere’s what we’d be working with so far:\n\n—\n\nFFVII Kaitai Shinsho The Complete\n\n-“Words aren’t the only thing” line quoted, along with a\n\nstatement that it occurs the “night before the final battle” (pg. 14);

Not really.\n\nWhat it does show, I would argue, is a preoccupation on SE’s part with the High Affection scene, as well as an emphasis to fans as to which version we should consider significant.\n\nFor that matter, while the numbers game alone may not prove SE’s intent, a reading of the associated passages in context most certainly does.\n\nAnother element of that context that is worthwhile to note is the manner in which Cloud and Tifa’s first conversation alone together and their last conversation alone together are bookended with stars.\n\nWhen they exchanged their promise as children, they did so sitting under a sea of stars. Really, go check that scene out again. There are a lot of stars visible above them. The scene even culminates in a shooting star flying by.\n\nDuring their final conversation as adults on the night they spend together under the Highwind, though we can’t see the stars above, we know they are once again there as Cloud and Tifa spend another night beneath the stars discussing what’s important to them. At one point, Tifa asks Cloud if he thinks the stars can hear them and see how hard they are fighting, so we know the lights in the night sky have come out by this point.\n\nAs TheLifestream.net forum member looneymoon once poignantly noted:\n\n—\n\nStars. Shooting stars. Symbol of Cloud/Tifa’s bond. They’re present during their promise as children. The promise they made because Cloud had strong romantic feelings for her. They’re used to frame their last night together under the Highwind. The night they spend together, during the time they’re supposed to realize “what they’re fighting for.”\n\nThe two scenes are connected. Tifa loves Cloud, there’s no doubt about that. Their feelings match. The star emphasizes the feelings they had as children still matter. It’s romantic no matter which way you look at it. Symbols can only be interpreted in so many ways, but they matter.\n\n—\n\nFor clarification’s sake, Tifa is indeed referring to the stars here, and not to the planet they are standing on. Though the Japanese word “hoshi” (星) can refer to any celestial body, and is also used in the game to refer to the planet the story is set upon, the term typically refers to stars when used in the plural form as “hoshi tachi” (星たち). This is how the word is used here by Tifa in the Japanese text of the game: ねえ、クラウド……私たちの声を、星たちも聞いててくれると思う？ 頑張っている私たちの姿を見ていてくれると思う？\n\n“Tachi” denotes a plurality, as in “watashi tachi” (私たち) within the same line (“watashi” means “I,” so a plurality of it means “we”).\n\nDespite the inarguable proof, counterarguments that something romantic actually occurred between Cloud and Tifa on that night are yet perpetuated.\n\nMost commonly, the claim is that the quotes about the feelings shared between Cloud and Tifa don’t identify the type of feelings being shared and confirmed between the two — and could, thus, be any kind of feelings. Or that when the feelings are specifically identified as mutually favorable, they are only done so in the context of passages describing the player-determined outcomes of the scene.\n\nAccompanying this claim, the quote from pg. 198 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega is usually also mentioned:\n\n—\n\nNight before the final battle……\n\nAfter stopping Hojo’s recklessness and before heading to the Northern Crater, the conversation scene with Tifa can diverge drastically depending on Tifa’s affection rating. When the affection rating is low, the conversation of the scene where the two spend the evening is candid/apathetic and rather short. In the scene on the bridge the next morning, Tifa asks ‘Were you listening?’ and taps her foot. On the other hand, if the affection rating is high, the two spend the evening in focused conversation, and on the bridge, Tifa asks ‘Were you watching?’ and collapses in embarrassment.\n\n[Caption for the screenshot of Cloud saying “This is probably the last time we’ll have together……”]\n\nWhen the degree of affection is high, the night passes meaningfully between the two……\n\n—\n\nThe claim is then expanded to say that the mutual feelings Cloud and Tifa confirmed could either be a) feelings of mutual romantic disinterest; b) romantic interest on Tifa’s part tempered to disinterest because she knows Cloud is in love with Aerith instead; or c) feelings of support for one another.\n\nEven the blatant terms in which the contents of the “For the One I Love” page are phrased — wording that states a romantic scene occurred, rather than wording that emphasizes or even mentions the optional events available to the player — get ignored due to the screenshot caption referencing pg. 232, where the “Deviation” sidebar about the low affection version is found.\n\nThat first argument is obviously baseless given that we know Tifa loves Cloud and is interested in him. We know this for so many reasons. FFVII shows us this. On the Way to a Smile: Case of Tifa shows us this. Advent Children shows us this. More than one Ultimania tells us this — e.g. Cloud’s profile on pg. 37 of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (pg. 39 of the Revised Edition), Tifa’s profile on pg. 194 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 1: Character guide, and the character flowchart on pp. 218-219 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega:\n\n(pg. 37 of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania; caption beside picture of Cloud and Tifa on the date at the Gold Saucer; translation from TheLifestream.net)\n\n“Both Aerith, who is forthright, and Tifa, who is demure, have feelings for Cloud but he is none the wiser to them.”\n\n(pg. 194 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 1: Character guide; caption beside picture of Cloud and Tifa on the date at the Gold Saucer)\n\n“She is shy when it comes to love. She’s getting better at plainly expressing her feelings to Cloud, though, and can do so more easily now.”\n\n(pp. 218–219 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega; arrow running from Tifa to Cloud)\n\n“Favors”\n\nJapanese text (in order of reference):\n\n積極的なエアリスとひかえめなティファ。ふたりの心にクラウドはなかなか気づかない。\n\n恋愛に関しては奥手。クラウドに想いを寄せながらも素直になれず、なかなか気持ちを伝えられずにいる。\n\n好意\n\nThe second claim is equally ridiculous. If Tifa’s interested in Cloud then she’s interested in Cloud. Not being interested in a relationship with a man who loves another woman until his affections turn to you isn’t equivalent to not being interested in a relationship with the man. It means you’re interested in a relationship with him right now and want things to change right now. In other words, there’s nothing mutual about the feelings in a situation like that.\n\nFor that matter, this second claim assumes as its premise the unverified condition that Cloud is in love with Aerith. That in itself is a counterclaim in need of support, and cannot be used as reasoning for a conclusion saying the same thing.\n\nBoth claims addressed here also fall short given that “communicate their feelings” and “reveal their feelings” are used in Japanese the way “realized their feelings for each other” is in English. Not to mention that it’s simply absurd that a scene would even be needed for two characters who aren’t interested in each another to confirm their romantic indifference for one another on the eve of global apocalypse.\n\nAs TheLifestream.net forum member Octorawk put it:\n\n—\n\n… How ridiculous it would be for them to “confirm friendship”:\n\nTifa: “Cloud…..there has been something I wanted to tell you.”\n\nCloud: “Yes, I’ve been meaning to tell you something too …”\n\nTifa: “Cloud, you’re a really good friend.”\n\nCloud: “Yup, you too Tifa … Gee … I hope we don’t die tomorrow. Nighty night.”\n\nOr “confirm mutual disinterest”:\n\nTifa: “Tonight may be our last night alive, so I think we should get one thing straight.”\n\nCloud: “Yes.”\n\nTifa: “I’m just not into you, Cloud. I just thought I better tell you that. Cos’ it would be awkward to spend the last 24 hours of my life thinking you thought I liked you.”\n\nCloud: “Yeah, don’t worry about it, I’m not interested in you either. I’m glad you said it, because it would have been weird.”\n\nTifa: “Phew… Well, that’s a load off …… Well, then. Goodnight, Cloud.”\n\nCloud: “Nighto.”\n\nSeriously, If you were watching a film and something like that happened, you’d walk out of the theatre and demand your money back.\n\n—\n\nSuch a course of events would be made all the sillier when looking at the overall Compilation of FFVII and what decisions Cloud and Tifa make immediately following the events of FFVII. Made in light of those, here’s an equally humorous riff on the notion by two other forum members, Isabella and Vendel:\n\n—\n\nAfter all they’ve been through together, Cloud and Tifa have a meaningful night in which they discover … they’re friends. And this realization leads them to live together.\n\nC&T are officially the dumbest characters ever put out by SE.\n\n—\n\n—Isabella\n\n—\n\n“Tifa, I like you so platonically that I just have to live with you.”\n\n“Oh, Cloud … I do so enjoy your company … Let’s adopt!”\n\n—\n\n—Vendel\n\nHowever, as we’re not going into the rest of the Compilation just yet, we’ll instead focus on the fact that Cloud and Tifa aren’t shown confirming any feelings in the Low Affection version of the Highwind scene to begin with. Cloud hardly says anything, after all, whereas in the High Affection version, he’s extremely forthcoming (for Cloud, anyway), left unable to even find words to properly express himself.\n\nGranted, he and Tifa do speak of supporting one another. That claim is true. Tifa says, “But that’s all right, even if no one comes back. As long as I’m with you… As long as you’re by my side… I won’t give up even if I’m scared.” The next morning, Cloud references this when he says, “It’s all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday. At least we don’t have to go on alone.”\n\nIt’s even been asserted before that Cloud’s last monologue in the diary-like entries from the Kaitai Shinsho The Complete guide (pg. 182) is evidence that the canon outcome for the Highwind scene is the lower affection version, with the two only confirming feelings of support for one another. Ignoring for now the questionable canonicity of the diary entries from the Kaitai Shinsho (see TheLifestream.net’s guide to FFVII canon), the basis for the above claim is this monologue:\n\n(translation by hitoshura)\n\n—\n\n[Cloud: To the final battle]\n\nI can feel it … from up north. He’s storing up some unbelievably powerful energy —\n\nThe path of destruction might be the only one left for us, no matter how much we struggle. We might just die a little before the planet, without Holy activating …\n\nEven so, I have to fight. To settle my past. To be myself. And, above all — tofree her frozen smile.\n\nAnd Tifa’s here for me. I’m not fighting alone, that’s what Tifa taught me—\n\nEveryone came back. Barret, Cid, Red XIII … Cait Sith taking part by remote control, while evacuating the citizens of Midgar. Vincent, who despite his cold attitude is really hiding a burning fighting spirit. Yuffie, who put up with her motion sickness and came back.\n\nEveryone each has their own reasons to right. And they’re all tied to the life of the planet.\n\nLet’s mosey, to the Northern Crater!\n\nShe left us hope, now we’ll release Aerith’s wish!\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n［クラウド：最後の戦いへ］\n\n感じるんだ……北の果てから。あいつが、とてつもなく強いエネルギーをたくわえているのが――。\n\nどうあがいても、俺たちには滅びの道しか残されていないのかもしれない。ホーリーを発動させることなく、星よりもちょっと前に死ぬだけなのかも……。\n\nそれでも、俺は戦わなきゃならない。過去と決別するために。俺が俺であるために。そして、何よりも――凍てついた彼女の微笑を溶かすために。\n\nそれに、ティファがいてくれる。俺の戦いは孤独じゃないんだって、ティファは教えてくれる――。\n\nみんなも帰ってきれくれた。バレットも、シドも、レッドXIIIも……。ミッドガルの市民を避難させながら、遠隔操作で参加してくれるケット・シー。さめた態度だけど、本当は熱い闘志を秘めたヴィンセント。乗り物酔いをおして、もどってきて くれたユフィ。\n\nみんなそれぞれ、戦う理由を持ってる。そしてそれは、星の命へとつながっている。\n\n行こう、北の大空洞へ！\n\n俺たちに希望を残してくれた、エアリスの想いを解き放つために！\n\n—\n\nIn the first place, I would argue that this entry is assuming the High Affection scene took place because of its reference to it as such in the Analects of Tifa section of her profile from the book, as quoted earlier.\n\nMore than that, though, the problem with this claim about friendship and support, quite simply, is that there’s no element of revelation in it, nor any need for confirmation of it. Cloud and Tifa had been supporting one another since before the beginning of the game, when she found him semi-catatonic at the Sector 7 train station.\n\nThey already knew they were there for one another — and not just in battle. Even with how slow on the uptake Cloud can be at times, if he didn’t pick up on the fact that she — and the rest of his comrades, for that matter — supported him emotionally when they stuck by him and encouraged him to journey on after he beat Aerith up and began to doubt himself, then he should have known it when Tifa helped him piece his shattered psyche together in the Lifestream. And even if not quite then, Tifa and the rest of AVALANCHE welcome him back with open arms after he recovers his memories, despite him having been Sephiroth’s puppet who allowed the villain to cast Meteor.\n\nCloud, as well, had supported Tifa. He participated in the second mako reactor mission because she reminded him of the promise he had made to her. He infiltrated Don Corneo’s mansion to rescue her. And before giving Sephiroth the Black Materia the second time around, he apologized to everyone — but he singled Tifa out for his greatest apology, and offered her encouragement that someday she might meet the “real Cloud.”\n\nSo, was it almost the end of the game when they realized and confirmed feelings of support to each other?\n\nNo, the two of them had definitely confirmed friendship and support of one another well before the end of Disc 2. There’s no argument to be made for them confirming such feelings in the Low Affection version of the Highwind scene — a version which, again, was said to have a conversation *lacking* in feeling.\n\nBefore we get too far from the “mutual disinterest” arguments, by the way, even if one wants to argue — as has actually happened — that taking advantage of the game’s affection ratings system to lower Tifa’s affection for Cloud allows one to change how she feels about him, this does not actually change how she feels about him in the narrative. The Ultimania pages referenced a few paragraphs above that speak to Tifa’s feelings for Cloud clearly apply regardless of an optional game mechanic.\n\nSeriously, we know Tifa digs Cloud. The player making use of an inherently illogical, completely arbitrary game mechanic (more on that in a moment) to lower Tifa’s affection rating for Cloud to something slightly less doesn’t change that — as far as the actual story is concerned — she still wants him. That she is in love with him is obvious, even in the Highwind scene’s lower affection version.\n\nFor that matter, Cloud doesn’t have an affection rating. His feelings are static (more on that soon as well). It is Tifa’s — as well as Aerith’s, Barret’s and Yuffie’s — affection for Cloud that can be manipulated.\n\nBy those who have taken that route, it has also been argued that the player, in the role of Cloud, influences the affection ratings of those he favors and doesn’t favor as a reflection of his own preferences. In other words, if a character’s affection rating for Cloud goes up, it’s because he favors them and shows this through his behavior.\n\nIn response, one must ask if Cloud, then, tells Tifa to be strong at the end of the mission at the No. 5 mako reactor in order to show off for Barret (that choice adds +1 to Barret’s affection rating for Cloud). Does he give Barret’s daughter a flower in order to impress him (+5 for Barret)? Does he tell Don Corneo that he has a boyfriend named Barret because he truly feels that way (+5 for Barret) — and even if so, why does a conversation Barret never hears increase his affection for Cloud?\n\nSimilarly, why does telling Jessie “Looking forward to it” during the train ride following the game’s opening mission lower Tifa’s affection rating by three? What does that have to do with Tifa? Not only is she not present for the conversation, but the player hasn’t even met her yet.\n\nHow about getting to the last train car before lockdown during the No. 5 reactor mission? Why does that give Tifa and Barret’s affection values five points?\n\nWhy does saying “I don’t know if I can hold on” at the end of that mission give Tifa’s affection rating one point?\n\nIf Aerith is chosen as Corneo’s date, why does saying “We’ve gotta help Aerith!” increase Tifa’s affection value (+3), while asking her if she’s alright lowers it (-2)? That one in particular is completely counterintuitive.\n\nWhy does who accompanies you to Barret’s fight with Dyne affect anything at all (+10 for Aerith, +3 for Tifa, +2 for Yuffie)? For that matter, in terms of the narrative, shouldn’t everyone have gone along?\n\nDoes Cloud push the wrong barrels in the church after meeting Aerith to make her not like him (-3 for each wrong barrel)? Or does her affection for him increase or decrease regardless of his motivations and intentions? Spoiler alert: it does.\n\nIf the affection ratings can change independently of Cloud’s affections, then haven’t we lost sight of the premise we began to argue for in treating Tifa, Aerith, Yuffie and Barret’s affection levels as a reflection of Cloud’s own? For that matter, in the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania interview referenced earlier in this analysis (pg. 11 of both editions of the book), Yoshinori Kitase commented that one of the contributing factors to the popularity of FFVII’s characters was “having 2 heroines, Aerith and Tifa, and having the hero waver between them, that was something new” (translation by hitoshura).\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nエアリスとティファというふたりのヒロインがいて、主人公がそのあいだで揺れ動くという設定も、当時としては新しかった。\n\n—\n\nThat Kitase thinks in terms of a love triangle rather than a love pyramid is sufficient on its own to show that the affection ratings are a fun diversion only — not a reflection of or determinant factor in the actual story.\n\nIf the affection ratings actually have narrative impact, as well as reflect Cloud’s feelings, why can one get someone other than Tifa for the date at the Gold Saucer, yet still get the High Affection Highwind scene? For that matter, why can one get Tifa for the Gold Saucer date — which would require her affection rating for Cloud be the highest among the four candidates — and still get the lower affection Highwind scene? Does he stop liking her halfway through the game?\n\nMost importantly of all, why treat an inherently illogical, completely arbitrary game mechanic as a reflection of the narrative?\n\nPerhaps more importantly, in fact: Where is this version of the lower affection scene in which Tifa and Cloud would express romantic disinterest? Where is it to be found?\n\nIt simply does not exist. No matter how many times one plays through FFVII, and no matter how low Tifa’s affection rating may be, they will never — short of modifying the PC version of the game — come across such a scene.\n\nTheLifestream.net and Cloud x Aerith forum member JayM once made the following valuable observations:\n\n—\n\nSo this isn’t a super-short post, I’m going to throw my hat in with the people who think the explanation of the LA HW scene is implausible. We see the entire LA HW scene (unless there’s more talking after the fade to black? But I thought it was implied to be short?). So the dialogue being mentioned could not have happened. Regardless of the feelings between the two characters, or the intentions of the creators, this “just friends” conversation did not exist in the narrative text of the LA HW scene.\n\n…\n\n—In order to make this argument, you guys’ve gotta prove\n\n1. That the conversation went beyond what we saw\n\n2. That the theorized extended dialogue was a confirmation of friendship. And if you want to really make this a point FOR Clerith\n\n3. That the reason Cloud would only want to be friends is because he is in love with Aeris, to the exclusion of being in love with Tifa.\n\nIMO this is a really convoluted way to work around to arguing that Cloud loves Aeris, and I think getting past point one will be incredibly difficult, much less getting to point three. I’d let this one go. CloTi doesn’t invalidate the existence of Clerith; you don’t need to disprove it to argue for Clerith.\n\n—\n\nAlong a similar vein, Master Bates made the following comment:\n\n—\n\nActually, I am more curious how the LA version somehow translates to Cloud is still in love with Aerith when the latter isn’t even included nor mentioned in that scene. There wasn’t even any reference to her, so how does that make getting the LA scene means Cloud loving Aerith?\n\n—\n\nTo summarize the matter, the lower affection scene ends when Cloud suggests that he and Tifa should get some sleep, and she agrees. One can argue until blue in the face that a conversation concerning “mutual disinterest” could have come up during the night, but — referring back to the quote from pg. 198 of the Ultimania Omega — how does it make sense for a scene said to be “rather short” to continue on for a longer, more significant conversation after the fade-to-black than it did prior to the fade?\n\nThe fade out at the end of the lower affection scene can’t be likened to that in the higher affection version. The latter is a discretionary shot that has been explicitly identified in official materials as providing a segue past a physically intimate moment; the former is the end to a conversation, not a prelude to more communication to follow.\n\nBoth scenes fade out, sure, but for different reasons. One fades out because Square wasn’t prepared to depict a scene of physical, romantic intimacy, while the other fades out because watching people sleep is boring.\n\nIn any case, how would a conversation in which Cloud and Tifa discuss not being romantically interested in one another not qualify as having deep subject matter, as the higher affection scene is said to contain on pg. 232 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario guide?: “If her affection value is high, the content of their conversation will be deep, showing that they strongly care for each other.”\n\nFor that matter, wouldn’t any conversation about Cloud and Tifa’s feelings for each other qualify as containing deep subject matter, regardless of whether their feelings were romantic or the feelings between best friends? And, as TheLifestream.net staff member Ryushikaze has commented, “Scenes without feeling cannot be scenes in which mutual feelings are confirmed.” There is no such confirmation in the Low Affection version of the Highwind scene. Period.\n\nPut even more simply, the bottom line here is: There can’t be any confirmation of feelings in a scene that doesn’t involve Cloud reciprocating Tifa’s digging of him. This is common sense.\n\nAnother common counterargument to the canon status of the High Affection scene is that, due to the scene being subject to player control, it can’t be said to have a canon outcome at all. This argument is even less grounded than the previous due to a great many scenes subject to player influence in FFVII and other Final Fantasy titles having officially confirmed results.\n\nWhile not every optional element of any Final Fantasy can be said to have a confirmed outcome, there is a simple, logical set of criteria we can follow to conclude if such an outcome exists. If the consequences of a particular outcome are shown to be in play in a chronologically subsequent title, or shown to be in play in an official book’s description of later events, then that’s how things went down. Also, if a particular version of events is outright said/shown to have occurred, then — unless the matter becomes messy due to inconsistencies — that’s also how things went down.\n\nExamples of the former include Yuffie and Vincent joining AVALANCHE, Clasko being influenced by Tidus in FFX to become a chocobo breeder in FFX-2 (despite the player having the option in the first game to inspire him to remain a knight), the choices in X-2 that lead to Tidus’s resurrection in the game’s ending, and Shadow surviving the events of the Floating Continent in FFVI.\n\nExamples of the latter criterion being met include Terra’s revelation about love (discussed on the “For the One I Love” page, as well as on pg. 186 from the same book, in FFVI’s Story Playback), FFV’s official ending being the one in which everyone in the party survives the final battle (featured at the end of that game’s Story Playback section on pg. 155 of the same Ultimania), and Tidus returning in X-2’s ending (on pg. 391; the Story Playback for that even shows a screenshot of he and Yuna together along with a caption for it saying “Tidus is resurrected in the ending movie, in a connection to the very end of the previous work’s ending” — ティーダが復活するエンディングのムービーは、前作のエンディングの最後からつながっている). The High Affection Highwind scene is also an example of this brand of confirmation, as we’ve observed at length.\n\nAmong the options discussed above, several are also filed under “Deviation” headings in the Ultimania, just like the Highwind scene received. Examples include Clasko’s profession (“Deviation” heading entitled “The Path Clasko Takes”/クラスコの進む道 found on pg. 353), Shadow being left behind on the Floating Continent (“Deviation” heading entitled “The Life and Death of Shadow”/シャドウの生死 found on pg. 183), and the optional decisions in FFX-2 that lead to Tidus’s return (“Deviation” headings entitled “Preparation for the Ending”/エンディングへの布石 on pp. 387, 388 and 391).\n\nAlso worth pointing out is that two of FFVI’s own four “Impressive Scenes” selections on pp. 160 and 161 were optional or contained optional elements, like the High Affection Highwind scene. The first of these is the scene depicting Terra’s revelation about love. The second is the Returners all confronting Kefka for the game’s final battle. The Highwind scene is not alone in being a mercurial event with a specific outcome chosen as one of the most memorable scenes for its game.\n\nMany events in FFVII and other Final Fantasy titles are subject to player control or influence, but still have canon outcomes.\n\nFor instance, in Final Fantasy XIII, a line in Vanille’s narration of Chapter 1 (“You said you liked my smile”) references an optional event that takes place in Chapter 11, where Hope mentions that Vanille’s smile makes him feel happy (YouTube upload courtesy of DavidGamesHD).\n\nThis cutscene can be easily missed if the player doesn’t go to the specific spot in Gran Pulse that triggers it. Even as an optional scene that the player may never see, it has a reference in the main body of the narrative before ever being available to the player.\n\nIn a similar case, Maechen from FFX can be completely ignored by the player during the course of play in that game. In FFX-2, however, during a conversation between he and Yuna, Maechen will comment that he conversed with Tidus on a number of occasions.\n\nFor an example closer to home, before Sephiroth casts Meteor in FFVII, the player has the option of leaving the Black Materia with either Red XIII or Barret for safekeeping. Despite this, all official sources on the matter depict Cloud as choosing Red XIII, just as all official sources speak of the High Affection Highwind scene taking place.\n\nSources included in this matter with Red XIII are pp. 179 and 183 of the FFVII International Memorial Album, pp. 35 and 165 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega, pg. 227 of the FF 20th Anniversary Ultimania File 2: Scenario guide, Reminiscence of FFVII and pp. 57 and 115 of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (pp. 59 and 117 of the Revised Edition).\n\nWith regard to pg. 35 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega and the first reference from the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania mentioned above, the event in question is even included on Red XIII’s personal timelines from his profiles in both books, while neither Barret’s personal timeline from the FFVII Ultimania Omega nor his personal timeline from the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania speak of the matter as including him with the definite phrasing used in Red’s entries:\n\n(pg. 35 of the FFVII Ultimania Omega)\n\n—\n\nWhen he receives the Black Materia from Cloud, the weight of the responsibility makes him shuffle. When he then loses sight of his comrades due to Sephiroth’s illusions, he goes into a state of near panic.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドから黒マテリアを預かった場合、責任の重さにビクビク。セフィロスの幻覚で仲間の姿を見失ったときは、なかばパニック状態になる。\n\n—\n\n(pg. 57 of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania; pg. 59 of the Revised Edition)\n\n—\n\nEntrusted with the Black Materia by Cloud, then tricked by Jenova mimicking Tifa, allowing Meteor to be invoked.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\nクラウドから黒マテリアを預かるも、ティファに擬態したジェノバにだまされ、メテオ発動を許してしまう。\n\n—\n\nIn fact, Barret’s timeline from his profile in the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (pg. 20) speaks of the matter in which he is left with the Black Materia as indefinite and subject to change:\n\n—\n\nDuring the event immediately following the recovery of the Black Materia, where some of the party wait on standby while Cloud and the others proceed into the Great Northern Cave, there are times when Barret is left with the Black Materia for safekeeping. Although he says “…Pressure’s on now” and is careful, he is easily deceived by Jenova when it assumes Tifa’s form and delivers the materia to Cloud, who became Sephiroth’s puppet.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n黒マテリアを奪還したのち、クラウドたちと一緒に大空洞の奥まで行かずに待機した場合、バレットが黒マテリアを預かることがある。「責任重大だぜ」と大事に持っているが、ティファに化けたジェノバにあっさりだまされ、セフィロスの人形と化したクラウドに渡してしまう。\n\n—\n\nMeanwhile, in the Story Playback section later in the book, on pg. 163 the matter of whom the materia gets left with is discussed as optional, but it is then shown to be Red XIII on pg. 165:\n\n—\n\nThe Black Materia is Handed to Another Party Member After the Jenova-DEATH battle, the Black Materia is recovered and it is decided to leave it with either Barret or Red XIII before proceeding. Whoever the Black Materia is left with will speak to Jenova while it mimics Tifa, then rush off to rejoin Cloud on that pretense.\n\n[Screenshot caption of Red XIII saying “You want me to take the Black Materia? ……all right, I understand”]\n\nWhen left with Red XIII. His nervous words and twitching are kind of cute.\n\n—\n\nJapanese text:\n\n—\n\n黒マテリアを預けた相手\n\nジェノバ・DEATH戦後に入手した黒マテリアは、先へ進む前にバレットかレッドXIIIに預けることになる。ここで黒マテリアを預かった者が、ティファに擬態したジェノバと話したり、クラウドのもとへ駆けつけたりするのだ（P.166,167）。\n\n[Screenshot caption of Red XIII saying “You want me to take the Black Materia? ……all right, I understand”]\n\nレッドXIIIに預けた場合。心細げな言動がちょっとかわいい。\n\n—\n\nLikewise, the Story Playback section of the FFVII 10th Anniversary Ultimania also features Red XIII as the party member chosen to safeguard the Black Materia (pg. 115; pg. 117 of the Revised Edition), and, as mentioned, the scrip"
