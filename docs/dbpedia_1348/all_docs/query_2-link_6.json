        "text": "This song captures the essence of all that is Final Fantasy.\n\nEdward Chris von Muir, on the Music Box in the 3D remake of Final Fantasy IV.\n\n\"Final Fantasy\", also known as \"Main Theme\" (メインテーマ, Mein Tēma?), is a recurring piece of music composed by Nobuo Uematsu in the Final Fantasy series. It has also been called \"Opening Theme\" (オープニング・テーマ, Ōpuningu Tēma?) and \"Prologue\", due to it being played during the opening sequences. Because of this, along with its recurrence, it is considered to be the series's main theme.\n\nThe theme first played during the opening of the original Final Fantasy and has since appeared in most main series titles, except for Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy X, and Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nThe theme from Final Fantasy is basically the song I'd like to be remembered by. I think it's very soft and warm, but there's a strength to it. It's appealing and I think it's the most important song in terms of everything I've ever done.\n\nNobuo Uematsu[1]\n\nGame appearances[]\n\nFinal Fantasy[]\n\n\"Opening Theme\" plays at the Cornelia Bridge and during the remake version's credits. It is track 3 on the All Sounds of Final Fantasy I & II album.\n\nThe original soundtrack of Final Fantasy Origins features an arrangement of this track by Nobuo Uematsu, and it is track 5 on disc 1.\n\n\"Opening Theme\" was remastered and released on the Final Fantasy I・II・III Original Soundtrack Revival Disc.\n\n\"Opening Theme FFPR Ver.\" is a rearrangement by Ryoue Takagi for the pixel remaster.
