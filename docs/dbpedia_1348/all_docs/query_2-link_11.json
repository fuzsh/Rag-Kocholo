        "text": "Final Fantasy XII: Original Soundtrack is the complete soundtrack for Final Fantasy XII, composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with the theme song composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The soundtrack includes six tracks not included in the game used in promotional stages. Vocals are performed by Angela Aki for the theme song, \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\".\n\nAlso included in the soundtrack is Taro Hakase's \"Symphonic Poem \"Hope\", arranged by Yuji Toriyama and based on the game's main theme by Hitoshi Sakimoto. It was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Robin Smith.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nWhen writing music for a movie, the timings are fixed and you can write things very precisely to match each and every cue. Writing for games is very different. Although the music can't always be written to match the scene you have much more time to develop themes and impressions over the course of the game. Using sounds, melodies and chords you can control the impact this has on the player.\n\nHitoshi Sakimoto\n\nYasumi Matsuno, the game's original director, chose Sakimoto to compose the music.[1] Sakimoto described the project as \"huge\", and that he was nervous about it. The main Final Fantasy series up until Final Fantasy XII had been known for Nobuo Uematsu's music, and Sakimoto was originally wondering whether he should try to emulate Uematsu's previous work or not.\n\nAfter considering the situation Sakimoto decided to go with his own style.[1] Before starting, Sakimoto already knew where the song \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" was going to be used in the game, and how the song was going to sound, so he took that into consideration.[2] By the time Sakimoto joined in the project, the basic battle parts had already been in the works and the storyline and character settings had been done. Sakimoto discussed some basic principles with Matsuno, such as the atmosphere that the music needed to create and the characters' emotional changes, and created the tracks following these principles.[2]\n\nEarly on it was decided that the game's music would use a fundamental orchestra form, not because of the image of the game itself, but to avoid a particular kind of arrangement that can be created by an unbalanced orchestration with use of folk instruments.[2] Since the game's battle system battles take place on the field instead of in a separate battle screen like in previous Final Fantasy titles, Sakimoto was initially unsure whether he should put the music's emphasis on battle or exploration.\n\nUltimately, Sakimoto decided to try to match the game's music to each location, a strategy that would convey the atmosphere regardless of whether the player is engaged in battle. As a result, many pieces alternate between being bombastic and quiet.[3]\n\nThe music in the opening and the ending were recorded live and have been fully mixed to support Dolby Pro Logic. Most of the music in the game, however, uses the console's internal sound chip. Sakimoto didn't want the game's overall mood to be too dark, so he tried to incorporate elements to keep things lighter. He names the \"Cerobi Steppe\" as his favorite piece from the soundtrack.[3]\n\nTrack list[]\n\nEnglish track name are from the iTunes release.\n\nDisc One (1:13:35)[]\n\nDemo Movie — 1:36\n\n(ループデモ, Rūpu Demo?, lit.
