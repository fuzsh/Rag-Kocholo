        "text": "August 16, 2021\n\n4.5 stars\n\nLiterally me the entire time I'm reading this manga: ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫\n\nI cannot get over how cute this manga is. I still am not a huge fan of the insta-love vibes but I love the art style so much and honestly it's just so darn cute I can't wait for the next volume!\n\nOctober 24, 2021\n\nItsuomi is about to head off on another backpacking excursion, but not before he and Yuki have a heart-to-heart talk. It turns out that honesty and communication might just play a part in a relationship after all...\n\nAh, I like this book (minus those awful covers). There‚Äôs really nothing like it right now (I would say [and have said] that A Perfect World is probably its closest match in subject matter, but from a very different perspective) and I continue to respect the work Morishita is putting in here.\n\nYuki absolutely makes this series come alive - she‚Äôs so upbeat and positive and trying her best to communicate despite being deaf. While the art remains singularly excellent, she is practically animated on the page at times (the chibi shocked expressions in this book are beyond reproach).\n\nItsuomi is, despite the book‚Äôs efforts, a little too poured from the mould of ideal super boyfriend - the cool college dude with a secret romantic side who travels the world so he can see things. Still, this wouldn‚Äôt be the first Morishita book where the male lead came a far distant second to the female (yes I am still annoyed by Shortcake Cake).\n\nI do give him credit for being very normal with Yuki, trying to pick up more sign language, and trying to involve her in his life. His pronouncements on how much of a pure soul she is read like something out of a trashy romance, but if that‚Äôs the worst thing he does then I‚Äôll be pretty happy.\n\nWhere this book really earns its stars is by how good it continues to be at depicting Yuki‚Äôs deafness and how she handles or experiences various situations. I found the section about her trying to find work and the boneheaded responses of the interviewer really believable (and depressing) and it provides a nice contrast to how normal Itsuomi treats her.\n\nIt‚Äôs a simple change, but it really shakes up the formula. How exactly are the two of them going to handle things when they fight? They still both have misreads and mishearings and skipped words and I love how this comes across in the text. There are a lot of cues that you miss without hearing and I feel relatively confident the series will keep addressing this going forward.\n\nStill not sure about overprotective rival guy, who seems unsure if he‚Äôs just going to be an unwanted worried parent or just tsundere his way into a plot complication. His sister was a cool addition to the cast though - I like that she sees right through Yuki from the get-go.\n\n3.5 stars, rounded up because of all the effort going into what it‚Äôs portraying and for not just shoving Yuki‚Äôs hearing issues to the side and making it an integral part of the storytelling while still making her a character with a disability and not a disability with some characterization. It‚Äôs not necessarily riveting from panel to panel, but it‚Äôs overall a very good book and a satisfying end to a year of manga.\n\nSeptember 12, 2021\n\nI didn't know that sign language evolves over time and that there are generational differences, or that sign language differs from country to country. This has a high enough edutainment level that I can easily see a reader getting interested in learning sign language from having read it, or becoming engaged enough to try and see it out in a world where it might otherwise have been invisible to them.\n\nYuki's a sort of null entity as a character, unfortunately. She's the same girl whose psyche entirely revolves around her man from the first moment they meet each other, that we've seen in shoujo manga forever. She, Rin, and Emma, for that matter, may as well all be the same person when it comes to their \"personalities\" and motivations. Which I guess is okay, in the sense that Yuki's disability doesn't affect that aspect of her at all.\n\nI do like the idea that Yuki and Itsuomi's worlds both expand as a result of having met each other. Another appealing part of the story is that Yuki is innocent and protected, and hasn't ever been subject to the cruelty of the world. The first indication of an uphill climb for her, is her applying for a part-time job as a data entry clerk and the employer possibly passing her over because she is deaf. But it's more a matter of whether she'll be able to \"go dutch\" rather than having Itsuomi pay, so the stakes aren't terribly high.\n\nIn any case, that these troubles are gently presented, or are more a matter of subtext than text, gives the reader a kind of idyllic or mostly utopian world that is sweet and pleasant to read.\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\n3.5 Stars. I have complicated feelings about this volume and the disability representation. While I adore our hero and heroine together and enjoyed seeing the progression of their relationship, I was thrown off by how he utilized her disability to say that she was innocent and that‚Äôs why he wanted to be with her. This could be a translation thing going on, but I have to be honest and say that it struck me as odd while reading. I will still continue with the series but I‚Äôm going to see if that is handled better going forward.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 8, 2023\n\nOkay, some of the relationship vagueness finally gets cleared up, but now this series -- while very cute -- is skating awfully close to the tipping point of being too gentle and mild for its own good. There's an impending warm and fuzzy overload if we don't get some drama stat.\n\nDecember 11, 2022\n\nJa, devojka u sreƒánoj i zdravoj vezi od skoro pet godina plaƒçem na poljubac dva fiktivna lika (ponovo).\n\nNovember 21, 2023\n\nthis is so cute i forgot i had pressons and i bit my nail clean off\n\nAugust 13, 2021\n\nAaaaaaaaaah my favourite volume so far because the big thing happens in this one *wink*\n\nI loved this instalment and A Sign of Affection has quickly become my new favourite current manga Yuki and Itsuomi are just so precious!!! <3 I get all the feelings that I got from reading Dreamin' Sun, and despite that being a different manga, I think Itsuomi reminds me of Taiga Fujiwara (who I also loved).\n\nVolume 3 sees Yuki and Itsuomi finally become a couple with Itsuomi declaring his feelings to her (and to his cousin, Kyouya, who does an insane amount of blushing when he learns Itsuomi is truly on cloud nine). Then there's Yuki's ever-lovable friend, Rin-chan, who is truly supportive of their relationship (and I really hope she gets to do the same with her crush, Kyouya).\n\nElsewhere, we see Yuki's childhood friend, Oushi, warning her against Itsuomi - but it's only because he has always like Yuki but has never known to vocalise it and instead comes across as being a mean a$$, and Yuki meeting up with Oushi's sister who she used to be friends with as a young girl.\n\nThe final chapter is just sweet perfection! <3 And I really hope Shin's reaction to this news isn't going to upset me in the next volume.\n\nLoved this with all of my heart!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nam i the only one who finds him creepy? hes attracted to her \"purity\" and wants to \"influence her\" are these not red flags????\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nThis volume was super cute! Sadly though it‚Äôs cuteness was marred for me by the continued interrogation and lack of respect for Yuki by Oushi who gets worse with each volume in my opinion and is just an annoying character overall. üòí\n\nAlso, I think Itsuomi should have asked again or made sure Yuki knew he wanted to kiss her before springing that on her‚Äîit was obvious she didn‚Äôt know what he was about to do and being so observant he should have clarified before going ahead. And again he often touches her sometimes very suddenly or without asking, which again I‚Äôm just not personally comfortable with.\n\nIf my library gets more of the volumes I might continue this series, but probably not likely due to things that keep making me annoyed or uncomfortable and the fact that nothing really happens much story wise. Which is super disappointing because I really wanted to like this series. üòî\n\nContent: mild swearing; a kiss; characters drink; suggestive hints\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nReread 4/20/24:\n\nUgh. It's SO. CUTE!!! I couldn't love this more. It's just the sweetest, most adorable thing I've ever read. I'm in love with Yuki and Itsuomi. I just want more. I want all of them. I'm definitely going to have to own this series some day in paperback.\n\nOriginal review 5/19/22:\n\nAhhhh another amazing edition to this series.\n\nI didn't think it could keep being as cute as book 2. How could it? But it did! It's still so sweet and making my heart pitter patter and I'm grinning like a fool the entire time I'm reading.\n\nSteam: we have a kiss! (Swoon)\n\nAugust 14, 2021\n\nSO AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!\n\nI loved loved loved it!!! I'm in a sea of feels which is no surprise because I knew I would be head over heels after reading. No not even AFTER, but DURING reading! I squealed, I laughed, I giggled.\n\nThis volume did seem faster pace than the previous two volumes. I know I binge read this series pretty hard, but am wondering if that's because the size of this volume was slightly smaller then the others? Well, not the ONLY thing as oh my goodness! Itsuomi was full of surprises in this one that left me turning through pages quickly! (I already plan to reread it again here today because I flew through this.) The opening kicks off right where volume two ended and just swept me away in a romance that I have been hoping for since the first page of volume one! I'm really excited to see their future together!\n\nI continue to love the sign language part of this manga a lot! I love the thought the creators put into this because it is extremely powerful to read. There are subtle things that I wouldn't have even thought about, but makes me realize how I take certain forms of communication for granted. A great example of this that Yuki it's a lot harder to sign when she's holding hands. I never any thought of that!\n\nThe art continues to be absolutely stunning! I just love the depth and beauty and the occasional humor because of facial expressions.\n\nAnother fantastic and wonderful volume in this manga! I'm already desperate for the next volume!!\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n‚ÄúNO\n\nMATTER WHERE I GO...\n\nTHERE'S OLY ONE YUKI..‚Äù\n\nüò£\n\nJanuary 28, 2024\n\nPotrzebujƒô przerwy od tej historii, jako ≈ºe poch≈Çoniƒôcie trzech tom√≥w na jeden wdech mnie przes≈Çodzi≈Ço, ale to moja wina, nie mangi.

People with disabilities get infantilized a lot, so this really didn't sit well with me.\n\n\"I think maybe part of it is because her ears have never heard the sound of the cruel world. She's transparent. It's like everybody starts off as a see through container. But then the container gets scratched, and dirty. And polished, because of the influence of other people. I want to have an influence on Yuki. It's like I never want to let her out of my sight.\"\n\nMaybe I'm thinking too much, or maybe this is just a shojo manga thing. I'm curious about other people's thoughts.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
