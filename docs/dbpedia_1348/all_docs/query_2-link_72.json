        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nbinjjo\n\n60%Xbox 360\n\n53h 9m Played\n\nFFXIII exceeded my expectations, but they were not very high to begin with. The game’s reputation for feeling “on rails” preceded it, and while this criticism is not unwarranted, I did find some enjoyment in my playthrough. The hallway-like map design, a lack of side objectives, and very few opportunities to explore means that the majority of the experience feels like a sequence of random battles broken up by cutscenes. That is not to say linearity is FFXIII’s biggest issue as many claim—FFX was just as linear—but the aforementioned gripes make most of the game feel lifeless and uninspired.\n\nMuch of the narrative’s finer details are conveyed to the player through text files in the datalog. The premise of the story isn’t bad, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired and I found the characters to be genuinely unlikable with very few exceptions. When it comes to character motivation, you are left in the dark for some time before their backstories are revealed in the numerous flashback cutscenes that depict the days leading up to the beginning of the game. I found this to be an interesting storytelling device, but it results in a plot that drip feeds you the details without giving a compelling reason to stick around and see things through. I did find myself warming up to the characters, but it took nearly 20 hours to get to that point and I think it would have worked a lot better if we were actually given a reason to like the cast before we see them at their worst.\n\nThe battle system is strange in that it encourages the player to rely on the auto-battle system. Only the party leader can be controlled in battle while the AI determines the actions of your party members. Abilities can be selected manually, but the pace of battle is so fast that doing so is not an efficient way to play. Instead, changing the party members’ AI behaviors on the fly via paradigm system is your primary focus. As weird as this sounds, it actually works really well and keeps the pace of battle consistently fast, but it often leaves you feeling like you have little influence on the combat itself. Adding to that, it takes several hours before the battle system really starts to open up and become interesting, much like the story.\n\nNear the tail end of the game, the map design pulls a 180 and gives you a huge area to explore with tons of monster hunting sidequests before narrowing back down to a long string of hallways and pointless combat encounters. I found this open ended section to be much more compelling to play, but it’s a shame it took almost 30 hours for the game to actually give me a reason to keep playing. It should be noted that this design choice does play heavily into the themes of fate and destiny, but I would not blame anyone for losing interest early on—the time investment required to feel any sort of satisfaction from playing this game is just ludicrous.\n\nIn many ways, FFXIII is the antithesis to its numbered predecessor—nearly every innovation introduced was drastically changed. It’s clear the developers took the criticisms raised with XII to heart (most notably being the a meandering plot, overwhelming character building options, and too much bloat) and over-corrected.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nPathelan\n\n60%Xbox 360\n\n43h 47m Played\n\nOverall, a pretty good game, but nothing too special. The music and world design are amazing, but the rest kinda falls flat.\n\nHowever, if you're expecting a traditional Final Fantasy game, this probably isn't for you. Try a good game in the series like Final Fantasy 6!\n\n...\n\nAs many have said before, this game is very much a Hallway Simulator. Most of your time will consist of walking down strict linear paths and encountering enemies along the way. Fortunately, this isn't too much of an issue, as long as you're willing to take things slow, taking in the beautiful scenery which still holds up very well to this day and spend time into learning how to effectively use the combat systems.\n\nMy major issue with the game is that it is so linear and so focused on the action, you hardly ever get to take in the environments and the constant action can feel rather draining. It takes around 20 hours until you are even given the option to take on side-quests, at wich point they feel more like chores compared to extra content.\n\nAt first, I was unsure how to feel about the combat system, being partially automated and in real time made it feel a little disconnected from the rest of the series. But I came around to enjoy it, even if it was only in the last few hours of the game. A lot of the intricacies of the combat which make it truly interesting and in-depth are never explained, or even hinted at in the game though.\n\nFor example, every 12 seconds, your ATB Guage fills when switching Paradigms. This not only helps boost your damage, but can make your entire team more versatile and combat much more interesting. This rewards constantly switching your paradigms throughout combat, for example it is much more efficient to switch between buffing and attacking compared to waiting until you have every buff. Yet, the game never tells you this, leaving you stuck thinking you're doing something wrong as the difficulty quickly ramps up in the later chapters.\n\nAnother issue I have witth the game is the needlessly complex and incredibly slow upgrade system. Admittedly, this was a system I hardly ended up using, but I tried to multiptiple times throughout this playthrough yet I found my progress to never really feel impactful. There are 2 different types of materials, Organic -which grant low amounts of XP, but allow you to increase your XP Multiplier at a lower cost- and Mechanical -which you use for large amounts of XP, but drain your XP Multiplier when enough are used, along with being rather expensive, draining most if not all of the Gil you have accumulated throughout your playthrough-. This wouldn't be an issue if you weren't constantly changing your equipment to deal with certain bosses and enemies, along with the upgrades becoming rather redundant as you find better equipment around the world, along with your pitiful amount of Gil you earn throughout your travels...\n\nNow for the story...\n\nIt's almost there, the characters are well written, the environments are very unique and interesting and the world holds a lot of mysteries and questions. But the story doesn't exactly land, it is very complex, constantly combining and branching, relying on a lot of in-world terminology which is poorly explained (The game poorly explaining things is kind of a running theme), which quickly leads to a feeling of disconnect and confusiuon as you lose track of what is happening and why.\n\nIn my eyes, this game is very close to being a good, possibly even a great game, but it misses the mark. Especially for how unconventional of a game this is for the Final Fantasy series. If you enjoy beautiful sceneries, well written characters along with a surprisingly complex combat system, I would recommend trying this game out. But if you are looking for a traditional JRPG, or even a good Final Fantasy game, I would not recommend it, at least not highly.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nPickles\n\n45%PlayStation 3\n\n43h 8m Played\n\nIf this was my first Final Fantasy game, I would never have played another one.\n\nAuto battle, tubes and a bunch of people repeating \"Cocoon, Fal'Cie, Gran Pulse, Focus\" without even recognizing each other.......that's how I would describe the game.\n\nIt's so bad that it just becomes sad, when there is dialogue each character talks without context. Nearly everything one character says seems to be unrelated to what the previous character said. They just keep repeating the same words....\n\nLinear isn't a problem, but when it's so linear where an accurate description of the game would be walking through a tube, and then another tube, followed by another tube for 45 hours.....then it's a problem.\n\nOn top of that, the gameplay is very....very boring. You have 1 playable character who auto battles, and yes it's exactly this basic.\n\nYou will need to switch jobs (aka paradigms) mid battle, but nearly every single battle follows the same strategy. Buff your team, debuff the enemy, attack and heal as necessary. Once your enemy is \"staggered\" go all out.\n\nOverall, boring.....very very boring. I literally fell asleep about a dozen times playing this game. I only beat it because it's a mainline FF game and Lightning is such an iconic character.\n\nPros\n\n✅High production value (They tried, and it shows, they just made a lot of poor design choices)\n\n✅Amazing graphics, almost feels like a PS4 game\n\nCons\n\n❌World map is literally a 45 hour tube that you just walk straight through. Small \"open\" area at the 20-25 hour point which is like a little web, then back to tubes.\n\n❌Auto battle\n\n❌Lack of variety in gameplay (Just the same strategy over and over)\n\n❌Boring story\n\nIf you are thinking about playing this..... don't. Seriously, play any other Final Fantasy game over this.\n\nIf you do decide to play this, 🐤Buy a drinking bird and have it tap X for 45 hours, and tape the analog stick upwards. 🐥That should get you through most of the game.\n\nMy mainline FF Ranking\n\nVII > VII Remake > IX > X > VI > > XII > II > I >>> XIII\n\nShareCompleted\n\nYannis_Spirou\n\n40%PC\n\n30h Played\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is often cited as one of the most controversial games in the entire series.\n\nAs someone who got into the series only few years ago, I didn't have any expectations before playing Final Fantasy XIII and I tried to get into the game open-minded.\n\nNow, a common complaint I heard from people before playing the game is that its level design is very linear. After playing through the game though, I can indeed confirm that the game is so goddamn linear, most of the game has you walking through narrow hallways and it almost feels like an interactive movie at times.\n\nAs for the story, there's a lack of proper introduction and explanation of important terms and plot points until halfway through, but it's too late at that point, and the second half suffers from absolutely terrible writing that doesn't make sense. Because of that, the story falls flat on its face and its characters aren't good enough to save it.\n\nThe gameplay though, is complicated; the first few hours were genuinely the most repetitive and mindless sections I've ever played through in a videogame, maybe ever. However, after the introduction of the paradigm shift, the gameplay got much better. With that being said though, the gameplay is not very good for the most part, not because it doesn't work well, but because it gets tedious outside of the boss fights, and the lenght of some chapters doesn't help.\n\nDespite all of these flaws though, I got to say, Final Fantasy XIII is a great looking game even to this day, and its music is good too.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Serviceable cast\n\n+ Interesting gameplay ideas\n\n+ Beautiful visuals\n\n+ Nice music\n\nCons:\n\n- Awfully linear structure\n\n- Convoluted narrative\n\n- Very bad story\n\n- Slow pacing\n\nNarrative: 2/10\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nContent: 6/10\n\nCharacters: 5/10\n\nMusic: 7/10\n\nGraphics/Audio: ?/10\n\nFinal Rating: 4/10\n\n- Weak -\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is blinded by its obsession to deliver a more cinematic experience than its predecessors while simultaneously utterly failing to deliver an engaging and well-written story.\n\nJust... why?\n\nDo I recommend it?:\n\nProbably only to those who want to get deeper into the series... at low price.\n\nShareCompleted\n\narclmpulse\n\n70%PlayStation 3\n\nLmfao, this game. I actually don't think it's as bad the community gives it shit for. Like, so many people have it as the worst game in the series, but I think it's just below average.\n\nThe story feels a bit overwhelming with how fractured the world building is with the data logs and how poorly delivered it is (the fuck is a L'cie??), but I don't think it was terrible per se. I really loved how the tone of this game felt different kinda like FF6, and that you were on the run, for a good chunk of the game. The game does feel pretty linear until Gran Pulse, the characters were kinda unlikable, but I thought that made them a bit more realistic. Snow is a criminally underrated character in the series imo, his arc of taking on too much while hiding behind a smile and learning that it's okay to share burdens with others was done perfectly. Lightning is similarly underrated as the MC of the game, since her arc is a foil to Snow's. One of the most interesting relationships FF has ever done, and it was completely platonic.\n\nThis game did have a weak villain, Dysley was completely unmemorable. I don't even remember what his goal was other than making the protags do whatever he wanted, lol.\n\nThe gameplay is what pissed a lot of people off. You only control one character in this one, you don't control the party in combat. So, it basically just tosses out all of the old combat out of the window, and was the start of this as FFXV kinda followed suit. Now I like turn based party RPGs and think they're a dying breed, but it wasn't... that big of a deal to me? I dunno, I've played so many games and different styles of RPGs that a change in combat honestly felt refreshing. I don't think it was particularly well implemented like some other games such as Xenoblade, but combat still required strategy and to think a bit, which I didn't really mind.\n\nI usually don't talk about OST, but Blinded by Light and Saber's Edge are the GOAT FF battle themes and I say this as someone who loves Don't be Afraid and Force Your Way from FF8 too, I don't think it's close. Those fucking strings, insane.\n\nThere's some things it does wrong, there's some things it does right. It broke away from the typical FF formula and overall wasn't particularly outstanding at it, but I also don't think it warranted so much hate. It's a perfectly mid game, imo.\n\n7/10\n\nShareCompleted\n\nShortchimp\n\n65%PC\n\n6.5/10\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a pretty infamous FF game, as apart from of course FF2, FF13 is pretty hated FF entry by the community. Now that I have finally played this entry... I get their complaints... and I agree with some aspects of it.... but at the same time I disagree with some points that are brought up in discussion.\n\nStory\n\nTo be quite honest, I am split on this story, as for some aspects of it I really did love. It has themes of fates and family all tied around, while having a simple goal in the beginning, save cocoon. While the story is easily character focused, it still had me interested enough to continue on this game. However it has a ton of issues that stand out. I don't think the story was well put together, pacing and just structure wise. Many points in this game just has the character blurt out these obvious \"deep lines\" where they monologue about something heavy out of nowhere, and while sometimes they did land, a ton of times they just stood out like a sore thumb. It doesn't help as well that the story in the very beginning is VERY complex/ convoluted, which I did like tbh. I know people complain that you NEED to read the datalogs to understand everything, and while I didn't fully explore them, a ton of details were given to you once during the story and as long as you were paying attention, you got what was their motivations, and if I forgot a detail, usually whenever you enter a new save or area it recaps the lore to you anyways. I think this story had a TON of potential, but just didn't land at specific points like how in the early game, its dumped on you while also having pretty unlikable characters (but ay, here is a ton of flashbacks to see they are all connected!), mid way point was good, but around late game it starts to have terrible pacing and slows down tremendously. Conclusion was bittersweet and I actually liked it, but MAN did the story just not land as much as I hoped it would.\n\nCharacters\n\nThis was easily the main focus of FF13, while the story was convoluted mainly, breaking the plot down, its honestly a pretty simple story of l'cie good and fal'cie bad (even if that is oversimplified). The characters however was what got the most development across the game, and for a bit I liked them... and hated some other arcs. I think overall Lightning's arc was pretty enjoyable, although wasn't my favorite character arc, which goes to Fang and Vanille's arc which easily went through the most development from the whole cast. I think Sazh was undercooked towards the mid way point after a certain plot point occurs for him, which I feel like can be blamed towards kinda resolving his arc too quickly, and he just stands around for the rest of the game till the VERY end. My least favorite arc was easily snow and hope's arc, cause good LORD was it annoying asf to watch their entire struggle be just cause of miscommunication. Literally, ANYONE ELSE could had just told snow the truth about hope but NOPE, lets just harm him so \"Hope can develop his own character by himself!\". It was just too annoying to watch. Most of the character's have bumps early game, but do start to become more likeable as they learn from their flaws and avoidable mistakes. Most of the good moments of this game revolves around them, and while I don't think it was perfect, it was pretty good, and what made the story also enjoyable.\n\nGameplay\n\nHere is easily the biggest complaint of FF13... the awful gameplay... kinda? I think most of the complaints I hear about 13 combat is people who played a bit then quit, cause the combat early game compared to late game combat might as well be a whole different game. That however is easily the biggest issue of ff13, is that for NINE chapters out of THIRTEEN, the gameplay is WAYYYY too slowly introduced to you, and is easily the worst aspect about 13. For basically a huge portion of the game, you have like 2 attacks, mainly 2 party members that the game decides to give to you, and tells you to mash. A TON of the mechanics in the game is slowly dripped to you, and you aren't even allowed to choose your own team till the 9th chapter, which is WAY too long, cause once you do get past that, while also having to deal with the awful hallway level design till chapter 11, its easy to see why some people just never reached the end of 13. Once you do get past that huge gap and the game FINALLY allows you to explore on your own for the paradigm system, its honestly pretty good, but not perfect. This is probably the hardest FF game I've played singleplayer wise for the normal msq, as the game after awhile actually punishes you for reusing the same strat over and over, and I am GLAD about that. However, there are flaws that linger on still. For one, there is a TON of pauses in everything you do, the character turning, the paradigm shifting first time taking years, and even after that taking a bit too long, annoying enemy types that force lame playstyles, especially ones that are not only tanky, but\n\nShareCompleted\n\njoaochorando\n\n100%PC\n\n105h 6m Played\n\nAfter nearly a whole year of playing it on and off, I can finally proudly say that I’ve 100% completed my very first Final Fantasy game! And what a great first choice too! I just love this game so much, man.\n\nThe battle system is perhaps my favorite in the entire franchise, rivaled maybe only by FF12. The story, the world building, the character progression, everything is just so perfect. If you give the time to get to know Final Fantasy 13 and all of its glory, the payoff is so freaking huge. I seriously never thought about getting a tattoo before until I saw the l’Cie brands and now I absolutely need one.\n\nThis game is everything that a true RPG is supposed to be. It’s fun, it’s engaging, it has mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to master, it’s a complete fucking package. Getting these last few achievements wasn’t fucking easy by any means. There’s a lot of grinding and fuck that piece of shit Long Gui with his 16 million HP. But taking my last stroll through Oerba, staring at the bleak horizon, looking back at a year’s worth of adventuring through this fantasy world is a memory I most certainly will cherish.\n\nI love this game. I love it so so so so much. Vanille is such an underrated character. And this game is too. I could keep talking about everything that I love about this game and how hard these achievements made me work for that 35/35 completion on my Steam account, but I’d rather encourage everyone maybe reading this to try it out yourself. FF13 does not disappoint. It’s got a lot of heart and emotion for a game people love to shit on so needlessly. Seriously, get to know these characters. Dive into this world, the incredible lore and all that.\n\nI’m gonna miss the feeling of not wanting to grind anymore because I’m finally done with it! And I’m surprisingly sad now that it’s over. Thanks Vanille, Hope, Sazh, Snow, Lightning and Fang. Love you guys. :(\n\nShareCompleted\n\nSpinnerweb\n\n100%PC\n\n35h 43m Progress\n\n'Epic' was the one word I kept thinking of towards the end, not so much in the dudebro sense lmao as in just what a monumental achievement it is. This game was spectacular in ways very few games I've played are. Definitely one of the best-looking games I've ever played, not just in terms of graphical fidelity, but also in terms of art direction. I have no idea how they managed to make a PS3 game look so good, how they managed to make the backgrounds look so alive and detailed, how they got the hair to look so good - better than most PS4 games, even - and how much work had to be put into the cutscenes. Fairly often, I couldn't even tell what was real-time and what was pre-rendered. Visually this game is such a treat that I have to struggle to think of any games or movies that are in the same league. It's incredible.\n\nThe world, too, is wonderfully constructed, and I read all the lore text in the menus because I wanted to learn more about the setting of this game, it fascinated me so. The story was, overall, great. It's lengthy and epic - the only nitpick I can think of is that by the two-thirds point of the game, all the character development is done, and the characters (designed by Tetsuya Nomura in his heyday, God bless) have overcome their interpersonal conflicts, and that's where there are some weak spots - not really weak, per se, but the majority of the game spoils you with so many shifting dynamics that make for great interactions, that when the characters finally 'settle,' they feel kinda like 'yeah, that's what this character would say' - and this might be simply because Lightning was my favourite of the cast (she's now one of my favourite female protagonists overall), but I felt like she wasn't getting enough dialogue. Which fits in with her stoic personality, yes, but I wish Snow would stop trying to be the main character. Lightning gets to be the one because if it wasn't her it should be Sazh, and the Japanese aren't ready to put a black man on the box art of a flagship RPG title yet.\n\nA common criticism of this game, one that seems to overshadow every single conversation about it, is its linearity. The game is linear as hell. 90% of the maps are corridors. The thing is, this is not a big deal. Non-linearity and free-roaming simply aren't what this game was going for, and in all honesty I feel like that works out in its favour - it keeps the game tight and focused and lets all the player investment shift to the battles which are amazing. The combat system is among my favourite in the series. They did away entirely with MP bars and most of the stocktaking between battles that are such a staple of RPGs, instead making the actual battles themselves more involved. One of the things I wasn't a fan of in FF XII was that once you had a strategy worked out, you ceased to be a part of the combat completely. FF XIII is the polar opposite of that, allowing and requiring the player to repeatedly change their tactics on the fly and make split-second decisions to keep from being gutted. All of the six roles have important functions, and switching between combinations of them as needed is a much more satisfying process than simply inputting winning conditions. Not to mention that battles, much like the rest of the game, look flashy as hell. The game also gets quite challenging at times, as grinding is greatly de-emphasized - to its favour, I feel, as it means the player's actual performance in combat is paramount to winning, as opposed to raw stats. For those that feel that turn-based combat is boring and 'press X to win', this game shows how it can be done.\n\nAfter a decade of progressively decreasing involvement in the series, this game also marks the first in the mainline series to lack any music from Nobuo Uematsu at all. No matter, because Masashi Hamauzu - who previously worked with the legend on FF X - is on the job. I feel that if these tracks were composed for a game that wasn't Final Fantasy with its astounding musical precedents, they would have defined that series in their own right, especially the battle theme. As it is, they're still excellent.\n\nAll in all, Final Fantasy XIII was an incredible experience for me, and is now one of my favourite mainline games in the series. I feel it's a shame how misjudged and hated and memed-on this game is, because I thought it was great, and I feel it's due for a re-evaluation. Hopefully someday. I keep reading about this supposed downfall of the Final Fantasy series - some say it started with VII (idiots), some with VIII, some with X, a lot with XIII, but in my own experience playing through them, I haven't seen any downfall yet, and I don't hope to. Final Fantasy XIII is a sleek, gorgeous and immensely satisfying game, a console-generation-defining masterpiece and I goddamn loved it. 10/10!"
