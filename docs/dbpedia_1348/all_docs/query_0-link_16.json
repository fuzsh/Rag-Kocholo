Iâm earning points like crazy, and Iâve put a goal for myself â â even though you can actually get gems and articles to go on your little dude â â I chose the reward I want so (you can customize it)and Iâm doing it!! Iâm doing what Iâm supposed to do. Itâs fun to go in and check it off and hear it make noises and give you points! I highly recommend if you donât have a habit of setting goals (your three things a day) that you go in and you start with at least three things you can delete what they have by swiping the left or you can stick with what they have and thereâs habits, daily, and Projects basically three different categories you can set up! There are so many different things you can do to customize this to fit your schedule and your needs you can make one for Budget. You can make one for Goals or Projects. The only thing negative is that itâs a little messy and difficult to navigate; or I wouldâve given it five stars. If they could clean it up a little bit, make the tabs to the different categories either up on top or larger and give a better understanding of points and how they were awarded it would be perfect ( and he's I went through the tutorials). But it's really awesome as is!!\n\nPandabooks ,\n\nReally Helpful for School!\n\nItâs ridiculously hard to stay motivated during virtual classes, and I think Habitica has been a big help! I have all my school assignments up on my To-Do list, which is really helpful for keeping track of what to do and for staying motivated in the middle of working on an assignment.\n\nThe main reason why I love it so much is that itâs ridiculously effective for me and itâs just what I was looking for. A lot of other habit-tracker/to-do list apps arenât in an engaging format, and I delete them after slowly losing interest over the course of a few days. I didnât have this problem with Habitica, because of how itâs part game and part productivity tracker. Iâve been looking for an app like this for ages, and I didnât find this until my friend recommended it (and thank goodness she did).\n\nI havenât noticed any bugs, other than the occasional small bug that comes from not syncing with the happening on my computer quickly enough. Occasionally thereâs an issue where I check off a To-Do list item or a Daily and it doesnât change color immediately, but itâs no big deal because the color changes if I go to another tab and then go back to the original. Iâm also not entirely sold on the idea of gems basically being only obtainable through money, but I can appreciate that the things they purchase confer mostly cosmetic benefit.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHey Pandabooks. Thanks for your review and kind words, they mean a lot to us! If you'd like to share any further feedback, please feel free to reach out via Menu - About - Send Feedback.\n\nVI Visceral ,\n\nHabitica can be a total Game Changer\n\nIâve been using Habitica for almost two years now, and Iâm here to say that as I was initially a casual user of the app, and have moved to being a player in a world parallel yet decidedly different from our own. With Habitica being a highly customizable game, you truly can gamify your habits and tasks to suit your own level of creativity, utilitarianism, minimalism, and community engagement. The guilds are supportive and members are eager to give encouragement and feedback, and the challenges that the guilds provide are usually well written and sometimes use âRPG lingoâ to make it more like a game and less like a chore list.\n\nI started changing the names of my tasks to âunlock achievements â and my habit lists to âActivate power ups â , and itâs been significantly helpful to keep my attention and engagement with the app. Furthermore: purchasing the app is going to be the game changer. While you donât technically âneedâ to, it opens up another level of interest and engagement with special Pet and potion Quests, and Habitica gives you a bundle of items every month you subscribe, and a special little pet as a thank you. Purchases keep the app free and free of ads for free users.\n\nHowever, this month I found that the Mystery Gift items did not show up in my Items list. Iâm wondering if itâs a bug\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHey VI Visceral! Thank you so much for this thoughtful review. We're happy to hear Habitica has been helpful for you! If youâd like to share any feedback with us directly, you can do that via Menu - Support - Submit Feedback."
