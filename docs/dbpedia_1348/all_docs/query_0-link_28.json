To all those who raised questions about unclear text or possible errors, thank you. I hope that going forward players will continue to speak up should they notice something!\n\nFAQ\n\nFurther Works\n\nSubreddit\n\nWelcome to the homepage of Ruina: Fairy Tale of the Forgotten Ruins, English edition!\n\nRuina: Fairy Tale of the Forgotten Ruins is a free-to-play Japanese game made with the RPG Maker 2000 engine, originally released on December 24th, 2008 by Shoukichi Karekusa (枯草章吉). It won the Grand Prize in Freem!’s 4th Annual Game Contest.\n\nThis translation is based on Ruina Version 1.21, the final released version of the original Japanese edition of the game. It was released with the knowledge and consent of its creator, Shoukichi Karekusa, under the following conditions:\n\nThat his name remain in or be added to any relevant documentation, signifying that he is the game’s creator.\n\nThat the game always be available free of charge.\n\nHowever, the content of this translation was not reviewed for content or accuracy by its creator. It is my wish that you, as the player, consider it to be not necessarily representative of Mr. Karekusa’s original work.\n\nWhat Is Ruina?\n\nRuina is a JRPG inspired heavily by classic adventure role-playing video games like Dragon Quest and tabletop role-playing games. If you’re familiar with anything in the RPG Maker 2000 engine, you’ll find that its battling is not terribly customized beyond what’s included in the program. The main draws of Ruina are its intricately-woven story and its gorgeous original artwork, including portraits, backdrops, event CGs, maps, and more.\n\nThe basic story of Ruina involves the search for the root cause of an enigmatic calamity as it strikes the Kness Dukedom. The player will meet a diverse cast of characters and fantastic races as various forces work to understand the purpose—and perhaps the benefit—of a network of sprawling, underground ruins, which just so happen to be situated directly beneath your hometown.\n\nRuina contains four origin stories to play, each with events, CGs, and an area unique to themselves, along with New Game+ features.\n\nWhat’s in This Translation?\n\nRuina in its original form and this translation contain graphic depictions of blood and violence. This mostly occurs in written word, though there are visual components to a small number of scenes, of which I am confident players will find tasteful. These segments all fall under the heading of generic violence and should not prove upsetting to those with specific concerns. The game does not contain sexual or exploitative content, and will not make any political or social assertions except those pertaining to the world inside the game.\n\nDownload Links\n\nMain download link\n\nLast updated: 2:55 PM EST August 8, 2021 (fixed various typographical errors, clarified or re-translated a few lines, and implemented English database file to smooth out garbage kana [thanks Goburinbro—see below for permanent credit])\n\nTo play, please run the RTP installer included in the main folder to its default location on your hard drive (if you have installed the Japanese RTP from a previous release, you do not need to go back and install the English one). Next, navigate to the “game” folder and double-click the “Player” application. That’s it! You should be playing the game. If your game is missing sounds, animations, and other stock assets, you either have not installed RTP, or have not installed it correctly.\n\nAny time the game is updated, you will not need to start the game over—your saves will be compatible between versions. Simply move any save files (.lsd) in the “game” folder over to same place in the new version.\n\n“bool’s tools”\n\nThis file contains various tips assembled by principal tester bool as he played through each of the game’s four routes. Beware that some of these tips may be considered spoilers, and in the case of the hidden treasures, most of them have in-game hints associated with them if you prefer to find them that way. But at present, please consider this the genesis of a future Ruina English wiki or strategy guide.\n\nPrevious release\n\nIf I somehow botched the game in an update, please report it. I’ll provide a hotfix as soon as I’m able.

If not, take a look here. I personally also discovered that Fiora appears two turns later in Chapter 19H (The Dread Isle) of the Japanese game (hereafter referred to as FE7J), for whatever that’s worth. These changes tend to be either a wash (like the removal of tactician blood type) or have few meaningful ramifications (supposedly lowered boss stats and small nerfs to thrones and gates). However, the reduction from 3x effective damage to 2x actually has massive ramifications on the paradigm of unit usability.\n\nWhich brings me to the point of this exercise. We’ll cover first the things that it’s not. This is not an argument that our perceptions of the North American and European games should be altered, as the various changes arguably call for their own separate meta. If I am to argue that a certain character is more usable in FE7J, it doesn’t retroactively mean we were wrong about that character. It just means that FE7J is its own thing that we’ve largely been neglecting in discussion—for good reason, as a majority of the Fire Emblem fanbase doesn’t read Japanese. Why would they play it? Instead, I’m going to focus on making a few points that speak more to the inherent design philosophies of the game across its different versions:\n\nThe game’s early-to-mid-game encounters play out so perfectly with 3x effectiveness that we can only conclude it was an integral part of the design on a smaller scale\n\nThe game was not intelligently readjusted to take 2x effectiveness into account whatsoever during localization\n\nThese principles severely hamper units that are otherwise relatively easy to raise and even throw off the balance of some units that were perhaps good enough already\n\nAbove all, I want people to consider experiencing FE7J for themselves, because it breathes some life into what’s kind of a played-out game. You may even notice some other subtle, undocumented changes like I did. I’ll link to some resources down at the bottom that might help players get into it without having to spend time learning Japanese or having to waste time unlocking Hector Hard Mode, which is the mode this article is based around. I think FE7J has interesting implications as a possible separate category for LTC runs and the like, though I really have no idea whether or not it’s already been considered. If nothing else, it may allow fans of some underpowered units to finally live out their fantasies of those units actually making a difference.\n\nI played through the game at a relatively brisk pace, and did not restart much, as I took needing to do so as a sign that my hypothesis was perhaps not sound. I stopped at Chapter 26H, Unfulfilled Heart, which is when you can promote one of Eliwood or Lyn, making for the last meaningful time these units can demonstrate benchmarks. The game has already begun to taper down on effective weapons by this point and will not reverse course, plus your units should largely be promoted and snowballing by this point, meaning the lines between unit effectiveness should be blurring. This will hopefully provide enough examples to make the points clear without having to drag readers through the entire game.\n\n(DID YOU KNOW? Unfulfilled Heart is 届かぬ手、届かぬ心 in Japanese, which is to say that “hands and hearts [of Bern] cannot be reached.” A different take might read, “Hardened Hearts, Clenched Fists.”)\n\nさあ、行こう。\n\nFirst, let’s demonstrate how effective might works using the game’s earliest opportunity. Attack is calculated as Strength + [(Might + Weapon triangle bonus) x Effectiveness] + Support bonus, and then Damage is calculated simply by taking that previous value and subtracting Defense or Resistance from it. The Wolf Beil has 10 might, which in NA means it gets doubled to 20 against mounted and armored units, or 22 if the enemy is holding a lance, as it also gains weapon triangle bonus. This means that in the JP version, effective weapons gain an entire extra unit of Might at no penalty—and potentially an extra point of weapon triangle—since Defense and Resistance are only subtracted after the entire Attack calculation is done. As you can see here, this means Hector can one-shot this Armor Knight without taking a counter:\n\nAs I go through more screenshots, I won’t be showing direct comparisons, as these get less and less reliable the further you get into the game. A zero-growths or average-growths run of both games would be more scientific, but I’m not sure whether or not those patches work cleanly with the Japanese game. If you feel skeptical at any point, you can at least do some easy math to subtract the extra weapon might yourself, along with an extra point for weapon triangle. This should illustrate how the extra might is so drastic that a few points of blessed Strength won’t matter anyway—I took several screenshots of exact kills, but by and large these encounters play out with such clearance that the benchmarks are comfortable in FE7J and not even close otherwise.\n\nBelow I will list the game’s affected weapons and some select bows for reference in case you need to know how much might to subtract in your head. I assume many of you can recognize weapons on sight by this point (and many like the Rapier should be obvious), but sometimes the icons might be obscured somewhat, and unfortunately the unit window doesn’t display friendly weapon names. But here:\n\nアーマーキラー (Armorslayer) 8 might\n\nぎんの弓 (Silver bow) 13\n\nソードキラー (Swordslayer) 11\n\nつらぬきのやり (Heavy spear) 9\n\nてつの弓 (Iron bow) 6\n\n長柄刀 (Longsword) 6\n\nはがねの弓 (Steel bow) 9\n\nハンマー (Hammer) 10\n\nハルベルト (Halberd) 10\n\nホースキラー (Horseslayer) 7\n\nマーニ・カティ (Mani Katti) 8\n\nレイピア (Rapier) 7\n\nNot all of these weapons will be on display here, but I’ve included them in the list just so you can imagine how much damage would be added to their calculations. Moving forward with the game, Rebecca and Eliwood, who join in the next chapter, make better use of the extra damage (shown here a few chapters later):\n\nThroughout Chapters 12 and 13, this mainly serves to occasionally free a stronger unit from having to take a detour to mop up units that can now be handled by one of these two. However, it’s also important to note early on here that readily scoring kills rather than simple chip damage dramatically affects their experience gain, allowing them to keep pace with your stronger units. This is something everyone already understands on some level, but doesn’t necessarily count it as a factor until they see it in action.\n\nRebecca one-shot most (if not all) Pegasus Knights I put her up against, even in her joining chapter, and Eliwood was able to one-round (and occasionally one-shot) most mounted and armored units, albeit under controlled circumstances where others can then shield him. I believe 13x is where it really becomes a game-changer:\n\nI’ve always found that 13x can be tricky to manage even with godly units like Marcus, just because there are a number of spots with things to do, and even he sometimes cannot effectively enemy-phase. The simple fact that Eliwood can now one-shot a Nomad allowed me to bottleneck this chokepoint with ease. I had never seen these enemies fail to destroy every one of the logs near their main camp before this run.\n\nMany bosses can now be one-shot. This doesn’t mean Hector can’t take Erik or Marcus can’t take Sealen already, but it’s amusing how often these line up so perfectly, and they usually contribute to more efficient clears:\n\nAnother cool thing you can do in Chapter 15 is send Eliwood to the left and take out that Nomad on turn one, which sets the stage for him and a ranged unit to hold that side by themselves:\n\nThis is surprisingly difficult to pull off otherwise, as you usually would need to pull valuable resources (like Marcus, Oswin, and/or the Horseslayer) over to that side to score that kill on the first turn. Coupled with the fact that Marcus more efficiently took on Sealen, I had a free unit (Rebecca) to send with Hector to that awkward chokepoint on the right. As a bonus, Eliwood even one-rounded a soldier on enemy phase.\n\nChapter 16 is made far less painless on a no-Lyn-story run for one simple reason:\n\nThis is where I became confident that my hunch about the game’s basic design philosophies was correct, as I’ve watched many people struggle with this part using base-level Caelin units.\n\nHere in Chapter 17, we find that Lyn, like Eliwood, can either one-round most mounted and armored units, or at the very least can finish one off with not as much setup. Coupled with the fact that Oswin can now one-shot cavaliers with the Horseslayer, I even left Lyn with him to deal with the Merlinus assassination squad, which they managed with no issues whatsoever. Eliwood also had a big win of his own:\n\nWhen I hit Chapter 17x, I noticed my normal strategies were utterly failing, and assumed I was merely succumbing to mental fatigue. I took a break, and then I remembered: enemies can have effective weapons, too.\n\nSo a chapter I thought I had solved became a struggle to keep track of where units specifically engineered to kill Marcus and Oswin were at all times. The result was a much more interesting chapter that nonetheless could have been circumvented the usual way, though at the cost of some experience (and possibly treasure).\n\nSkipping ahead to Chapter 19, we see that my units are still meeting benchmarks (at times narrowly), which allowed me to vie for control of several areas at a greater pace than usual. I nearly completed the chapter before Fiora had appeared, in no small part due to that Uhai can now be dealt with more effectively:\n\nAt Dragon’s Gate, we have some rare evidence of promoted Rebecca in HHM, along with how much easier it is to punch through Cameron’s cavalry (that fight against Cameron himself would have also been a one-shot even if he wasn’t weakened):\n\nBallistae can now be used for fun and profit:\n\nBeyond this point, anything I can say is going to feel fairly redundant. Powerful units like Hawkeye start to eclipse the effectiveness of units like the Archers and sword-locked Lords all the same. The ability to stay competitive late-game with enemy-phase prowess is still ultimately the best trait a unit can have. I have always felt, however, that units don’t necessarily have to be useful for the entire game, and FE7J definitely allows for more flexibility in early-to-mid-game. For those who are wondering how their favorite underappreciated units will fare beyond here, here is a small taste:\n\nAs you can see, bow users still present fair player-phase options at this point in the game, with Lyn comfortably one-rounding Wyverns and Louise often saving Silver bow uses thanks to the extra might. I didn’t bother showing off promoted Eliwood because I think most people’s issue with him is just getting him to promotion in the first place, not his increased usefulness beyond that point. And that’s really the biggest thing, in my mind—effective weapons are a huge asset to these otherwise underpowered units, and nerfing them really throws off their balance.\n\nI took at least twice the number of screenshots you see here, which tend to present similar circumstances with underpowered units one-shotting or one-rounding enemies they otherwise could not. I’ve omitted them for better readability, but hopefully you can see how this makes for a much cleaner path through the game. The player can much more easily raise certain units without having to constantly math out kills for them, and they even allow for new strategies. I think it’d be fun to see what people can do in high-level runs with restored effective weaponry, even if it doesn’t exactly change the existing conversation.\n\nYou may have come away with the notion that FE7J is easier, but I think all it really does is level the playing field, and I’m really not sure why they made the change from 3x effectiveness to 2x at all. All it seems to have done is make for a metagame reliant on overuse of a select number of units, and in many cases it destroys clear solutions to “puzzles” that require a specific weapon or character.\n\nIf you want to try FE7J Hector Hard Mode for yourself, here is a Gameshark snapshot with that mode unlocked. I think many of you can probably play the game just by looking at the icons, but in case Japanese text really turns you off, you can try this reversion hack that seems to have kind of flown under the radar. The snapshot is for the Japanese version, and the hack seems to be for the North American version, so they may not be interchangeable. I don’t know whether or not the hack works with a North American snapshot, so your mileage may vary. In any case, have fun with it!\n\nDo you remember the CD age of video games?\n\nI don’t think I have to explain what a compact disc is, as they’re still sort of a ubiquitous concept, and I still see them on store shelves. I was born well after the vinyl age and still had a clear idea of what those were. They would always catch my eye somewhere in a corner of my parents’ things, as I’m sure CDs do for children of Gen X and Millennial parents. Additionally, CDs look virtually identical to DVDs and Blu-Ray discs, so the disparity between generations of optical discs is somewhat less than it was to go from vinyl to 8-track to cassette to CD.\n\nBut let’s nix most of the ersatz technophilic rambling and instead cut to the part about video games on CDs. They were the predominant format for PC games for at least ten years, but the story with CDs on consoles is much more brief. I personally think of the 5th generation as the “CD generation,” but this entire idea is merely a testament to the power of the Sony PlayStation, the biggest console of its time. It is, in fact, the one truly successful home console to have used the compact disc as its media format, with only the Sega Saturn even remotely rising above the waterline beyond that.\n\nThis is mainly in regard to worldwide sales. CD-based consoles were more relatively successful in select parts of the world, especially Japan, which is where most of the major ones were developed. One of these was the CD-ROM² add-on for the PC Engine, which is how Japan would experience the initial release of Tokimeki Memorial in 1994—almost entirely voice-acted. This was made possible by the greater storage capacity allowed by CDs; voice acting was occasionally featured in a limited capacity in cartridge-based games before then, and could be done reasonably well on other 5th-generation consoles thanks to audio compression (like with Star Fox 64), but in general players just couldn’t take it for granted like they do now.\n\nTokimeki Memorial was later ported to the PlayStation in 1995. The PlayStation quickly became known for its multiple-disc games—something PC players were no stranger to even dating back to floppy disks—which became its own phenomenon where players would assume this meant they were getting more content. In reality, it was that the audio and cinematic files simply took up that much space. Players were quick to point out that the third disc of Final Fantasy VII pretty much only covered the very last segment of the game, with the ending cinematics being the main reason for its existence at all.\n\nNow, if your brain works like mine (which I hope for your sake it doesn’t), you may have at one point assumed that movie files would take up more space than audio files. Pound-for-pound that might be true—don’t quote me on any of this—because cinematics tend to feature both audio and video, but if you think about it, a game’s voice acting will run for much longer than its cinematics if you lay them each out end-to-end. Hopefully this illustrates why even partial voice acting was so rare, even for early CD-based games. The amount of voice acting you hear in any given game is also probably several times larger than it appears, given that lines must be recorded for each possible contingency a single player may never hear.\n\nWhen Konami released Tokimeki Memorial 2 on November 25, 1999 for the PlayStation, more than five years had elapsed since the first game’s PC Engine release, and it was even four years removed from the PlayStation port. Japan was set to release the PlayStation 2 in only three months. It was nowhere near the last game to be released for the original PlayStation, but it’s safe to say it came out well into the latter half of the console’s life cycle. This is typically the time when developers would get somewhat wild with console capabilities, as they’d become more familiar with its architecture and what they could get away with. This is when you’d start seeing things like add-ons and other plug-in features. For Tokimeki Memorial 2, all Konami really needed was the plain old memory card.\n\nWhat you see here is Tokimeki Memorial 2‘s EVS, which stands for “Emotional Voice System.” It allows you to choose a girl, enter your name, and specify pitch accent to create sound files you can load along with a new save file so that one girl can then speak your name during the game—rather than the girls simply skipping over your name and honorific as they did in the first game. You may have noticed that this is just the first EVS disc, which allows you to create files for only three of the game’s girls, with two girls being included with the main game files by default. These EVS discs had to be obtained via supplemental issues of Hibikino Watcher, which were real-life magazines that also served as the in-game version of the Memorial Spot feature from the first game. Konami even announced the creation of a “VR space” whose URL would be shown in the game, where users were expected to roleplay when using its forums:\n\nPlayers had to have the first three physical volumes of Hibikino Watcher to get each EVS disc, and the base game itself was five discs. That matches Riven: The Sequel to Myst for most discs on the console even without the EVS discs. With them, it doubles that of either Final Fantasy VIII or IX. When you use the EVS, it requires 11 memory blocks for a single girl. Then, you have to load the data every time you boot up the game, though this is not mandatory. Once you get into the game, you expect to find the familiar high school setting, but are instead dropped into an idyllic childhood during spring holiday one year. As Japanese schooling doesn’t involve a long break between school years like summer vacation in the United States, this suffices for that period of time when a child would most feel disconnected from that grind.\n\n「懐かしいなぁ…」\n\nThis open-world childhood simulation lets the player build their own personality by interacting with various memory nodes. This isn’t explicitly defined, but its purpose is obvious. If you interact with a dog, you can decide whether your character thinks dogs seem threatening or benign. An adult might prompt you to explain the degree to which you prefer school or vacation. Any transparent manipulation on the game’s part was excusable in my eyes because I felt a certain nostalgia despite never having played the game. Its distinctly PlayStation aesthetics charmed me, even as I knew in my heart that this game did not possess the same level of artistic craft as the first Tokimeki Memorial.\n\nI spent a long time combing through the credits for both games and trying to see how much of its staff carried over to the second game. Koji Igarashi had left to build his Castlevania legacy, that much I knew. But I couldn’t find many other key names, either. Akira Otsuka had replaced Masashi Kokura as art director. It says Konami on the jewel case, but it was actually developed by a subsidiary, KCET (Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo). I was disappointed, but chose not to write it off.\n\nAs you lead your friend Hikari Hinomoto (“the sun’s glow,” more or less) around town, you can encounter more involved events that usually have an emotional charge to them. Your character tends to act distinctly boyish. This often results in Hikari on the verge of tears. You manage to derive compassion from the collective unconscious, possibly for the first time in your life.\n\nSome keystone events happen no matter what. You revel in the comfort of being led by the hand once in a while, far from the paralyzing responsibilities of your real-world adult life. I chose to ride the merry-go-round, accompanied by “Waltz of the Flowers” from The Nutcracker, my favorite ballet.\n\nSoon, you arrive at the catch: you’re moving away. You and Hikari grieve. I recalled my own misgivings with a childhood that lacked permanence.\n\nSeven years and one disc pass, and you arrive at the more familiar starting point of Tokimeki Memorial, where you have a chance meeting with Hikari just before the opening ceremonies. She quickly chides you for making her sad when you moved away, but forgives you because you remembered her at all.\n\nLater, you resume catching up. She remarks that you haven’t changed, while telling you that she isn’t a crybaby anymore. You concur that she used to cry a lot when you were little. She replies:\n\n“Yeah, I was crying because of you.”\n\nI recalled the scene that I had witnessed just five minutes ago, seven years prior in the life of my character. Hikari, crying her eyes out as my parents drove me away to what might as well have been Shangdu. I felt guilty, even though it wasn’t my fault, nor my character’s. I felt—unlike with the first game, where its main character has spent his whole life in proximity to Shiori Fujisaki—that I had to right some wrong with this game. That’s where the game differentiates itself from its predecessor, and that’s where I was hooked.\n\nThe next stages play out more or less how you’d expect from a gameplay perspective. Despite my personal takeaways regarding the game’s introduction, the reality is that the game defocuses the 幼なじみ character somewhat after you put in the second disc. Unlike Shiori, Hikari does not markedly position herself directly in your path, has a set birthday (June 25) and blood type (A), and joins her own canonical club (track and field). This makes her feel more like one of the pack rather than being directly connected to the player, despite the Hikari-focused childhood stage of the game.\n\nThe girls are not as temperamental from a systemic point of view, and bombs are not as ubiquitous or dangerous. There is more of a focus on which girls are best friends with which other girls, which was present in the first game’s lore, but only implied within the game. Girls that enter into Tokimeki Memorial 2 don’t command your attention as readily, making single-minded pursuance of your target girl much easier, generally. This makes the game feel more relaxed at the expense of some of its challenge, though the more flamboyant, uncategorizable nature of the girls can make their preferences and best responses tough to pin down. How will you appease the student body president who rules with an iron fist?\n\nOne addition I really like is the weather system. Like in real life, you can only predict the upcoming weather reliably about a week out. You can schedule dates within the upcoming week, but in my experience girls will say they’re busy more often in Tokimeki Memorial 2 if you don’t give them as much notice, which may or may not be true. Inclement weather can affect date options and add cosmetic differences while not typically outright ruining your plans. The game also features a number of extra free date opportunities like a fireworks show, some of which thrust more than one dialogue option your way, making them sort of win-big-or-go-home opportunities (you can choose to go alone).\n\nI don’t want to get too in-depth with mid-to-late-game events because Tokimeki Memorial 2 remains somewhat pure in English-speaking circles, and there’s something sort of beautiful about that. I believe that the first Tokimeki Memorial will one day be playable in English, but I’m fairly confident this won’t ever be true of Tokimeki Memorial 2; it’s just so monolithically untouchable with its 5+3 discs, defunct “VR space,” untranslatable EVS system, and quirks that I didn’t touch on like a greater emphasis on honorifics. When you see a particular girl, you can choose to call out to her with any number of formal or informal Japanese name suffixes (or none at all), and choosing incorrectly can be very jarringly uncomfortable. Your character will default to whatever he knows to be that girl’s baseline if you simply bypass it, making it not strictly necessary, but it’s a feature that would be a shame to be omitted.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while it was still a hit in Japan, Tokimeki Memorial 2 did not sell as well as the first game, and did not appear on Famitsu‘s 2006 list of readers’ top 100 games of all time (the first game appeared three times). I believe players knew there was something inferior about the whole package, with its more run-of-the-mill art style, emphasis on stock music, and lack of finishing touches that made Tokimeki Memorial special, rather than just being the same kind of anime dating sim it would continue to inspire throughout the years. Regardless, Tokimeki Memorial 2 is a stunningly bizarre, endlessly interesting fragment of an era of games that will one day be referred to as its “nascent” stages. Hopefully this primer can suffice as basis for archeological study on what may always remain a black box to many.\n\nYou’ve taken part in the grand soiree, and now you’re after the real prize.\n\nIt may have become apparent to you that while you can effectively complete Tokimeki Memorial by simply making it to the end of high school by any means necessary, you haven’t truly beaten it unless you’ve successfully won over one of its girls, and you furthermore have not achieved its most difficult victory without seeing the ending with central character Shiori Fujisaki.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: it’s quite fine either way. You obviously don’t need to get that ending to enjoy the game to its fullest, as your choice of girl is a matter of personal taste. You’re not a lesser player for not having done it. However, for those who prefer Shiori, or simply wish to rise to the challenge, read on.\n\nIt’s true that Shiori is the most difficult girl to pursue. You can go into the game with a reasonably thorough understanding of its mechanics and quirks and still fail. Such was my experience on my first playthrough. Unfortunately, even if you read through the game’s wonderful instruction manual, have some prior familiarity with the game from a spectator’s point of view, and generally just have a good head on your shoulders, it’s highly likely that you will overlook something in a blind run. However, this doesn’t mean you’re overmatched. I was able to retool my approach and achieve her ending on my second run, and I think anyone can get there without a high degree of metagaming or other abuse.\n\nAs such, this article is geared toward those who have already completed the game at least once. Furthermore, this approach is intended for those who still wish to do most of the work under their own power without knowing things like every single best dialogue option or exactly which date spots will trigger unique events. These principles helped me to succeed without reloading saves very often (about two or three times to my recollection) and without much poring-over of technical guides at all. I do recommend staggering your save files to at least one extra slot and alternating between them, especially if you’re about a third of the way in and are reasonably happy with your progress.\n\nLet’s first talk about the required statistics you’ll need by endgame. This is only about as nitty-gritty as I want to get, but it’s important. By and large, I believe this is the toughest aspect to balance, as while you require everything in abundance for Shiori, stats are also what cause new girls to come out of the woodwork. Furthermore, if you don’t understand some of the finer points of the system, you may find it difficult to even elevate your numbers to begin with. Here were my endgame stats in my Shiori run:\n\nMy stats here are each about 7–15 points above what are commonly accepted to be her benchmarks, with the exception of athleticism (運動) because I needed to exercise quite a bit to get my determination (根性) up to par in the last couple months. It’s common to end up with a monster stat and a dwarfed 根性 value like this, so don’t feel like you’re necessarily doing anything wrong if you also end up with crooked values. Also, don’t spend too much time thinking about the fact that I made my nickname “BBPM.” To make sure you reach these levels by the end of the game, you must keep a few things in mind:\n\nYou can take advantage of the club system to give yourself a “custom” sort of activity for stats you consider to be a problem.\n\nIdentify a stat that gives you trouble and try to find a club that makes things easier, hopefully while helping out in another area. As you can see, I joined the fine arts club, which was actually Ayako’s club. You can do some math to manipulate the birthday system and put Shiori in whatever club you want, but know that it’s not strictly necessary, especially if you know Shiori’s preferences well enough already.\n\nSundays (日) and odd holidays give you the biggest and most drawback-free boosts out of anything.\n\nThese are also the only times when you are able both to make phone calls and schedule dates, so surely you see the issue here. Make sure to make time for both, as you can’t hit all Shiori’s targets without using some off days for personal improvement. Keep in mind that you’re going to need more Sundays for phone calls later on in the game and try to take advantage of the stat boosts early on. But know that this attracts more girls earlier on.\n\nYou will want to 休養 (rest) more than anything else, both to make sure you have a respectable 体調 value by endgame and to make sure some other unique problems don’t arise.\n\nI have not experimented thoroughly with the effects of high and low values of 体調 on stat-building, but a minor amount of empirical evidence seems to suggest that letting your physical health stay on the low side hurts your gains. I assume the same would be true of having a high stress value. One thing I do know for sure is that keeping your 体調 high ensures that you start with a high HP value in the random battles you can encounter in places like the class trip and date spots. These aren’t mandatory to beat, but they’re fun and assumedly net you some sort of date bonus if you do. I’m also fairly sure that having more 体調 acts as a buffer in case your club-mate accidentally gives you food poisoning.\n\nI’m reasonably confident you have some wiggle room in regard to benchmarks, but don’t push it.\n\nIn a different playthrough, I won Nozomi with numbers that seemed woefully inadequate given what other people have said her benchmarks are. Shiori may not be as forgiving, or things like university may influence different girls in this way. So just know that it’s not necessary a death knell if you are a bit short on something, but don’t seek to take advantage of it.\n\nMake sure you keep up with general academics consistently throughout the game.\n\nYou can neglect some stats until the end, but it’d be best to make sure you’re always keeping the study-related stats reasonably high throughout the game, as this allows you to climb the academic ladder throughout the years and thus be able to get into a first-rate university at the end. I’m not absolutely certain whether you need to do this progressively throughout the game or whether you can beef up right near the end, but I have strong feelings that it’s the former.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the game’s other girls and the obstacles they present in a Shiori run, starting with the ones you will absolutely not be able to avoid:\n\nYumi Saotome (早乙女優美)\n\nShe will appear at the beginning of the second school year, no exceptions. She is fairly easy to read and manage, but also very persistent and quick to turn on you if you spurn her. Her 💣 can go off quickly if left unattended. Note that you do not need to use a phone call to Yoshio to be able to call Yumi once she’s introduced.\n\nMegumi Mikihara (美樹原愛)\n\nShe will appear at some point in any Shiori run that’s going reasonably well; the only question is when. You can delay her somewhat by not getting into the second Christmas party. She is not overly difficult to manage either, though she has a couple interesting wrinkles. Not typically an aggressive 💣 thrower.\n\nYuko Asahina (朝日奈夕子)\n\nShe is not strictly unavoidable, but you will probably not be able to avoid her because general knowledge (雑学) is the one stat you can’t help but raise. The good news is that she’s even easier to manage than Yumi and slightly less persistent, but you still shouldn’t underestimate her 💣 potential.\n\nMio Kisaragi (如月未緒), Yuina Himoo (紐緒結奈), and Ayako Katagiri (片桐彩子)\n\nAs the academics, you will probably end up with at least one of them in the mix, if not all three. Mio and Ayako are fairly easy to read and slow to 💣 (Ayako seems to do it a bit more readily), while Yuina is more of a wild card. Her personality is much more idiosyncratic, and she can be tough to schedule dates with. Try to put off her entry into the game as long as possible.\n\nYukari Koshiki (古式ゆかり), Nozomi Kiyokawa (清川望), and Saki Nijino (虹野沙希)\n\nThe athletically oriented girls are, in my opinion, easier to avoid because there’s no pressing need for the stats they require. If you trigger any of them, it’ll probably be Yukari because she partially works off the appearance (容姿) stat, which you might want to keep fairly high if you intend on getting into the Christmas parties. They are not terribly problematic, though they can be persistent, and Nozomi is somewhat atypical.\n\nMira Kagami (鏡魅羅)\n\nIf you run into her, you boosted your appearance (容姿) far too highly and quickly. You can keep it relatively high without ever running into her.\n\nI was able to win Shiori while juggling seven other girls (Yumi, Megumi, Yuko, Mio, Yuina, Ayako, and Yukari), but it gets dicey at that stage. Don’t neglect your long-term stat-boosting, but don’t trigger too many girls too early on by boosting one stat up to a level where it causes one girl to appear, then immediately moving on to another stat that’s going to make another girl come out of hiding. Note that spending enough time using a club action will eventually trigger that club’s girl no matter what, even if you spend some time letting your stats drop back down a bit between sessions.\n\nAs far as how you manage them month-to-month is concerned, I would say that it’s easier and simpler to give at least somewhat positive responses to pretty much every girl who asks and possibly tank them at the end rather than to hot-and-cold them. If they want you walk home with you, let it happen. If they ask you out, say yes unless you have something you absolutely need to schedule as soon as possible for a more pressing reason. If you’re out on a date with one of them, don’t be a jerk—try to give what you think is the neutral or positive response, though bear in mind that there are a couple girls who are turned off by yes-men. When you need to schedule dates with girls other than Shiori, try to choose date spots that seem to have no relation to that particular girl, positive or negative. This usually results in a greater abundance of available neutral responses. Having to build them up and break them down constantly rather than just dealing with slight changes every so often is not only less stressful, it will also make you feel less like a psychopath.\n\nThe game gives you more freebies than you might think. Always bear in mind that having a 💣 go off is unequivocally worse than missing a single random romantic opportunity with your target girl. Bombs are deadly on their own and quickly turn into compound issues. With that said, such freebies can occasionally be used on other girls as stopgaps without ruining your run. It’s not the end of the world if a girl you’re not interested in shows up on the school trip or strongarms you into a date at a bad time. I even gave a bad response or two to Shiori during my successful run. Just keep it to a minimum and roll with the small failures as you secure the long game.\n\nOne thing: I’m not sure whether qualifying for Shiori at the game’s end makes her override other girls who are also sitting at the highest affection state, so if it’s around February of 1998 and you have a chance to take any other girls down a peg, I would consider going for it at that point just to be safe. They can still conjure bombs at that point, but they probably won’t go off in time.\n\nWith all that said, we can talk about Shiori more in a vacuum and how to make sure she reaches the highest affection stage by the end of the game:\n\nYou’ll want to get out of her initial “meh” stage as quickly as possible so that she’ll start walking home with you.\n\nShiori is the one of the only girls who will consistently decline to be walked home from the outset, which is a problem, because walking home with girls is a valuable free action that gives easy points and delays bombs. The best way to get out of this zone is to hound her with date offers to the concert hall from the outset of the game, as it hosts her favorite kind of music (classical) at the very beginning. This is especially important with Shiori because you will run into her more often outside of school than any other girl, even though Yumi makes up a lot of ground quickly…\n\nShe can still 💣 even though you’re childhood friends.\n\nYou cannot neglect her simply because you feel like you’re well on track with her. She can and will go off, though not particularly aggressively or quickly.\n\nThere is never a reason not to give her the most positive answers to everything.\n\nThis pretty much goes for any girl you’re trying to win over, but it’s worth stating. Remember that the girls you pursue—including Shiori—will eventually start asking you on dates themselves, and you’ll want to always say yes to these, especially since they will often ask you to date spots where they’re going to trigger a unique event.\n\nIf you’re not feeling confident, you can play with the birthday system (and probably blood type) to give yourself more of an edge.\n\nYou can trigger some additional unique events with Shiori if you give her and yourself the same birthday and have it fall on a holiday in some year, and there is probably some similar gameplay element associated with blood types (which is treated sort of like astrological signs in Japanese culture), though I’ve not heard of anything like that. I find this kind of a hassle, and didn’t need it in my playthrough. It may be helpful, however, to place her birthday strategically in a spot where you might need a relatively easy affection boost/bomb delayer during the year, which can substitute for a date in a pinch (I find gift-giving pretty intuitive). Just remember that her birthday also determines her club, in case you’re trying to plan that as well.\n\nYou can consider Shiori to be something of a middle-ground compared to other girls in terms of how dialogue options affect her mood, generally speaking.\n\nHer Yoshio bio should give you most of what you need to figure out her disposition and tastes, but pay attention to the subtler details of her personality. She is intelligent, but can still be sweet-talked much of the time. She is cultured, but can appreciate life’s simpler delights. She is something of a free-thinker, but may still have stereotypically narrow opinions. She can enjoy a smattering of the more off-kilter activities, though not too wild, by and large.\n\nI hope these tips allow for a relatively informed attempt at Shiori that doesn’t interfere too heavily with player agency. Keep in mind that a lot of this is based on empirical study of my own and may not be unfailingly accurate from a technical standpoint. This game—like many Japanese games—has numerous elements of random chance and quasi-gambling. It’s possible that some parts of my own playthrough cannot be reliably replicated, so keep your eyes open for patterns that other players (myself included) might have missed. Most importantly, have fun, and don’t agonize too heavily over every last decision.\n\nEnd Cutscene (Spoilers)\n\nIf you’ve successfully won Shiori’s heart by the end of the game, congratulations. If you aren’t able to hear what she’s saying (via a voice-acted version of the game), or it goes by too quickly for your comprehension level, I’ve transcribed and translated the scene as I did with the opening cutscene. As with that translation, know that this one is not always literal:\n\n「し、詩織…。\n\n“Sh, Shiori…”\n\n「ごめんなさい。こんな所に呼び出したりして。今日、あなたにどうしても言いたいことがあって…。\n\n“I’m very sorry, to call you to a place like this. There was something I just had to say to you, today…”\n\n「言いたいことって、何？\n\n“What is it?”\n\n「私ね、今まで男の子と付き合ったことがないの…。でも、興味がなかった訳じゃないのよ。私だって、男の子と付き合ってみたかったし、ラブレターだって何通も貰ったこともあるわ。でも、どうしても付き合う気になれなかったの。\n\n“I’ve never really gone steady with a boy, to this point in my life… I mean, it’s not like I wasn’t interested in the idea. I know people probably think one thing, with the boys I hang out with, the love letters I get. But, none of them were quite what I was looking for.”\n\n「ど、どうして？\n\n“W, why not?”\n\n「あなたが…。あなたがそばにいてくれたから…。今まで、あなたの事を、ただの幼馴染みだと思ってた…。ううん、きっとあなたに、私の本心を悟られるのが怖くて、そう思い込んでいたのかもしれない。でも、卒業する今…、離れ離れになるかもしれない、今になってやっと、この気持ちに気づいたの…。恥ずかしくて、逃げたい気分だけど、もう、ただの幼馴染みじゃ嫌…。一人の女の子として、私だけを見つめてほしいから、勇気を出して言います…。好きです…。世界中の誰よりもあなたが、好きです…。\n\n“It’s… you. It’s because I realized… I had you, by my side, all along. Until now, I’d only thought of you as my childhood friend. I was wrong… it was always you, I just may have been afraid to realize my true feelings, somehow. But now that graduation is here, I feel like maybe I can step back a little, and see it more clearly… I feel ashamed, and want to just run away, but I don’t want to just be ‘childhood friends’ anymore. So I’ve called upon the courage, to stand before you now, and hope that you might see me not as that girl, but… me, who I am now… I love you… more than anyone else, in the whole world…”\n\n「実を言うと…。俺も詩織のことが…。\n\n“When you say that… I feel the same way, Shiori…”\n\n「あ、あれ…？嬉しいはずなのに涙が出てきちゃった。本当に本当に、信じていいのね。\n\n“R, really…? I should be happy… why am I crying? Can my eyes not believe what I’ve just heard?”\n\n「もちろんだよ。好きだよ、詩織。\n\n“Believe it. I love you, Shiori.”\n\n「嬉しい…。いつまでも私のことを、離さないでね…。\n\n“I’m so happy… please, don’t ever let me go…”\n\n(Technically, when she says the part I translated as “I’ve called upon the courage,” she’s speaking in the present tense. However, I was very pleased with the callback to a certain part on New Year’s Day 1998 where Shiori can tell you she prayed for courage if you’re on track to win her heart, which players might not necessarily see.)\n\nじゃあ、「ときメモ」を遊びたい？\n\nYou’re in luck. I’m here to tell you that you can play it. Unfortunately, I haven’t translated the game nor created a patch for you to download. Some day you might be able to play a translated version of it, probably through efforts from the fan community—or, hey, maybe Konami will get sick of making crappy slot machines. In the meantime, why not just play it right now?\n\nThis is assuming you already want to play it. You may have watched the Action Button review, or have simply been around long enough that you’ve caught wind of it in dating sim circles or some similar community. If not, I won’t try and convince you of anything here. That is, except for the fact that you can play and enjoy it without complete fluency in the Japanese language.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. You will need more than absolute zero, but as long as you have a solid grasp of the syllabaries, basic kanji, and grammar, you’re at least at the bare minimum. Without complete fluency, you won’t necessarily catch everything, especially some of the more culturally idiosyncratic bits. Many of those sequences tend to fly by in real time, which can be hard to keep up with, and when they start touching on things like omikuji, that can only compound the situation if you’re not familiar with those kinds of things. I say it this way because I think many people among the game’s likely player base have at one time probably dabbled in learning Japanese. Perhaps you want to be better, but have had issues with time, motivation, focus, or any number of other issues.\n\nWell, lucky for you, this game can make you better. With perhaps a few cheat sheets to help with basic game mechanics, you can breeze through this game and even get one of the romantic endings. To help you along, I’ve transcribed and translated the auto-scrolling introductory sequence, which you can watch in the game and then reference and compare with the text below. It isn’t always translated literally, so don’t be alarmed if your own interpretation doesn’t line up perfectly with mine.\n\n「俺の名前は〇〇〇〇。ここ、私立きらめき高校の新入生だ。\n\n“My name is [player name].

To be enrolled at the same school as my secret crush, Shiori Fujisaki.”\n\n「実は…。彼女とは小学生からの幼なじみで、家も隣りどうしなんだけれど…。\n\n“As a matter of fact… she’s my childhood friend, and her house is right next door to mine…”\n\n「俺と比べて、月とスッポン。だから、いまだに友達以上の関係には…。\n\n“But she and I, we couldn’t be any more different. So, to this day, to even think of us as being more than just friends…”\n\n好雄「よう。何しけた面してんだよ。\n\nYoshio: “Hey, why so glum, chum?”\n\n「あ、あぁ…。別に…。（なれなれしい奴だなぁ…。）\n\n“Oh, uh… it’s nothing… (Nosy fella for a stranger…)”\n\n好雄「俺、早乙女 好雄。これからよろしくな。お前は何ていうんだ？\n\nYoshio: “I’m Yoshio Saotome.

What’s got the girls all riled up?”\n\n伊集院「やあ、諸君。待ったせたね。\n\nIjuuin: “Ah, my adoring public. I’ve kept you waiting.”\n\nこの僕の事を知らないものはいないと思うが…。僕が理事長の孫の伊集院レイだ。\n\n“I believe my reputation precedes me, but… regardless, I am Ray Ijuuin, grandson of the chairman of the board. For the rest of you gentlemen in this class, I almost feel sorry for you… but, I hope that we may get along cordially, nonetheless.”\n\n好雄「伊集院って、あの金持ちのか…。嫌なクラスになっちまったなぁ。\n\nYoshio: “Oh no, not that fat cat Ijuuin… this class is gonna suck.”\n\n「そ、そうだな…。（あっ、次は詩織の、自己紹介みたいだ。）\n\n“You can say that again… (Oh, it looks like Shiori’s up next.)”\n\n藤崎「みなさんはじめまして。名前は藤崎詩織です。趣味は音楽鑑賞で、クラシックとかを良く聴きます。みなさんこれから、よろしくお願いします。\n\nFujisaki: “It’s wonderful to meet you all.

How ’bout her measurements?”\n\n「そんなの知るかよ。\n\n“How would I know that?!”\n\nYoshio, unperturbed, slithers out of view and goes over his checklist.\n\n好雄「よし、チェックだ。チェック。\n\n“Alright, check, got that. And, check.”\n\n「お、お前…。そのメモ帳、女の子の事ばっかりじゃないか…。\n\n“T, that notebook… don’t tell me it’s filled with nothing but girl info…?”\n\n好雄「ま、女の子の事で、知りたいことがあったら、俺に連絡しな。力になるぜ。\n\n“Come on now, you know you’re gonna come calling for my intel. Let me be your secret weapon.”\n\n「そ、そうか…。ありがとう。\n\n“Hm, well… thanks.”\n\n好雄「それよりも。お前、この高校の伝説知ってるか？\n\n“But, forget about that for a minute. Do you know about the legend of this high school?”\n\n「伝説？何それ？\n\n“Legend? Wha?”\n\n好雄「ほら、そこの窓から、でっかい木が見えるだろ。\n\n“Look, you see that huge tree out the window?”\n\n「ん？あぁ。\n\n“Huh? Oh, yeah.”\n\n好雄「あの木の下で、女の子に告白されると、永遠に幸せな関係になれるんだってよ。\n\nYoshio: “If a girl confesses to you under that tree, your relationship will be blessed with eternal happiness.”\n\n「へぇ、そんな伝説があるのか…。\n\n“That’s what they say, huh…”\n\n好雄「誰が言ったかしらねぇが、うらやましい話だな。\n\nYoshio: “Well, don’t quote me on all that, but sure would be nice if it were true.”\n\n「伝説か…。そうだな、俺なら…\n\n“A legend… I wonder, if I…”\n\nShiori radiates in and out of view.\n\n「こうして、不安と期待の高校生活が始まった…。\n\n“And so, let a high-school stay of anxiety and anticipation begin…”\n\nWhile we’re at it, let’s take a look at the various screens you can interact with from home, which is where most of the gameplay happens:\n\n体調 is “health,” though specifically it refers to physical health.\n\n文系 and 理系 taken together is a chiefly Japanese concept that’s similar to “soft” and “hard” sciences, though the nuances are a little different. “Humanities” and “science” are a fine quick-and-dirty way to think about it, but it may be slightly more accurate to think of 文系 as fields that would lead to a BA in university and 理系 as those that might lead to a BS. “Science” as we understand the term in Japanese is 理科, while 理系 can refer to STEM as a whole.\n\n芸術 is “art,” albeit specifically fine arts, so as not to confuse it with 文系 “arts” that could include things like language arts.\n\n運動 is “athleticism,” more in the sense of the training and exercise portion of it rather than for the purpose of sport.\n\n雑学 is “general knowledge” in the same sort of sense as “trivia,” as one might want to have if they were competing on Jeopardy!\n\n容姿 is “appearance.”\n\n根性 is “guts” or “determination,” though it also means “one’s personal disposition,” so take that as you will. If you’re wondering, the word used in place of “determination” in the Japanese version of Undertale is 決意.\n\nストレス is “stress,” which we can take to mean it’s the deliberate counterpart to 体調, instead dealing with mental health.\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at the first issue (創刊) of the “Memorial Spot” magazine (情報誌), which is a key aspect of the game you can access by pressing the icon of the person with the magnifying glass. You should be able to tell what most everything represents at a glance, but there’s a couple things to note here:\n\nThe upper-left (このコーナーで、最新スポットの情報を紹介) is telling you that date spots will be suggested in that corner. Your character will automatically take note of them and make them available as choices when calling girls.\n\nThe bottom-left (このコーナーでは、次号より盛沢山のイベント情報を提供しています。おたのしみに) is telling you, predictably, that any particular unique events going on will be listed there. Also, it tells you to “have fun.”\n\nIn the upper-right, while the movie theater is closed (休館) initially, make note of how the current concert will tell you the genre, which for gameplay purposes is more important. In this case, it’s classical (クラシック), which may be of immediate interest to you. Any movies showing during that period of time will do the same thing.\n\nIn the bottom-right, the game is telling you that the first Suikoden (幻想水滸伝) game will be available in 1995. It’s a decent game! You may want to try it.\n\nHowever, another thing of note is how your character will remark, 「そうそう、カレンダーで自分のバイオリズムが確認できるんだった。」which says that you can see your biorhythm on the calendar screen.\n\nIf you’ve ever played such games as Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance or Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, you may already be familiar with this sort of gamified pseudoscience. I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what its significance is here.\n\nHopefully, this primer suffices for enough basic info to be able to physically control the game without many frustrating stoppages while also not informing any of the player’s in-game decisions. This information was collected using the PlayStation version of Tokimeki Memorial: Forever With You, which is also available for Sega Saturn and PC. This is the version I highly recommend you play, as the PC Engine CD original is more primitive in every way, while the subsequent ports are all butchered to some degree, even the Super Famicom version. They also don’t feature voice acting, which helps greatly with comprehension.\n\nI recommend you just let the game flow naturally throughout its narration and dialogue without getting hung up on understanding everything. Luckily, the girls’ facial expressions and voice acting will be a huge help in determining the tone and direction of conversations, so the meat of the game shouldn’t be terribly difficult to digest. The game does not ask you to actively deal with complicated text in general: if your crush said that some koalas were cute, would she most appreciate being told:\n\nCute? Are you kidding?\n\nTheir eyes are kind of freaky, though.\n\nTotally. Super cute!\n\nAnd that’s about it. With a bit of 根性, you too can make it through this game and even achieve one of its romantic endings.\n\n「頑張ってね。」\n\nI translated Ruina: Fairy Tale of the Forgotten Ruins from Japanese to English. That’s probably why you’re here. It might not be news to you.\n\nI’m opening with that statement because my translation of Ruina just reached its 500th download in its sixth month of existence. This value is probably somewhat inaccurate for various uninteresting reasons, but not wildly. Adjusted for time, such a number is roughly on par for an RPG Maker game of its era, as far as the English-speaking side of the internet goes. Only the singular Yume Nikki managed to transcend its trappings as a pre-XP RPG Maker game and secure its place in gaming history. Nowadays, games like Omori and Lisa: The Painful make waves with later iterations of the engine, but the coding functions have gotten sophisticated enough that games of that nature more often don’t show the seams and stitches generally left behind by amateur development tools.\n\nThis is not to say those games are somehow less authentic as indie productions for all of that, though “indie” has lost all meaning as a descriptor, as it has in music. The fact that these tools have gotten better and more versatile as time goes on is a good thing. What it boils down to is that any given creator can better craft an experience as they see it in their imagination. I only bring this up to illustrate that as these game-maker engines have gotten better, they’ve enabled the games created with them to slip into a market that’s been conditioned only to accept work done by a conventional studio.\n\nThe notion that consumers tend to pay more attention to brands, established franchises, or at the very least a recognizable veneer of high-budget production is not exactly a novel finding by me. We know that Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy in all but name, couldn’t break a million sold. We know that Shouzou Kaga’s Saga series of games was and continues to be dwarfed by the greater continuing success of the Fire Emblem series he created. And I’m sure we all can point to a game or series that each of us personally believes is produced under an agenda of pure cynicism—a soulless husk given triple-A shine, possibly owing to a legacy built by former glory. Above all, we know that it’s not the name of the company on the box that matters but the individual minds at work that make a game great. I believe that even someone content in their own complacency on the matter would agree with that notion. I should know. I’ve been there.\n\n“RPG Maker? No thank you,” one user said in response to another user’s linking of this very blog. Such a sentiment is not unique to this individual. I’d be remiss to say that the issue is as simple as one of corporate backing. Amateur development tools have long been linked to the horror genre (itself considered kitsch) and low-grade pornography. Furthermore, RPG Maker did not receive an international release for PC until XP, which ensured that only those willing to try their hand at building a game on a home console—good luck distributing that—or cognizant of an amateur localization of a pirated version of one of the engines would even get the opportunity to try and make a game all on their own to begin with. It’s no wonder these games accrued a poor reputation outside of Japan.\n\nSo far I’ve only mentioned RPG Maker. It wasn’t the only piece of game creation software available online back then, and it definitely isn’t now. I would say the most notable game ever made with one of these engines is Undertale, and that was GameMaker Studio. Perhaps the fact that the consecutive words “RPG Maker” were never associated with Undertale was part of the reason it wasn’t shunned. Incidentally, Vestaria Saga was made with SRPG Studio. In reality, I think most consumers don’t figuratively run to Wikipedia and check which engine powers any particular game unless it’s so obviously built on pre-existing foundations that they can’t help but run to confirm their suspicions.\n\nSometimes this hurts even commercial games in long-lasting ways, while sometimes it just doesn’t. No game making use of the Doom engine (Heretic, Hexen, Strife, Chex Quest, and even Doom II) ever received as much lasting praise as Doom. On the other hand, Obsidian Entertainment’s functionally identical sequels to Bioware games (namely Knights of the Old Republic II and Fallout: New Vegas) continue to be lauded as worthy entries, possibly even more than the original games.\n\nWhat it boils down to is this: people don’t like when games aren’t honest about their origins. More to the point is that they don’t like when they can’t recognize whether or not a game is being honest in this way. And that’s where RPG Maker tends to take another invisible hook to the jaw. It’s Dragon Quest Maker, and the world just isn’t as in love with Dragon Quest as the Japanese are. Many would-be players can’t stomach the most elemental of JRPG battle systems, no matter how much they might feel coaxed by a particular game’s host of other charms.\n\nBack in 1970, George Harrison’s single “My Sweet Lord” released four days ahead of its accompanying album, All Things Must Pass. The world forgave him for seemingly unintentionally plagiarizing the Chiffons’ “He’s So Fine.” Two decades later, Beatles descendants Oasis would endure years of ongoing criticism for their many lifted riffs and melodies. Neither would ever make apologies for their approach to making music, but personal reputation would ensure that the way each would be perceived would turn out entirely differently.\n\nGame makers do not typically enjoy such luxury of being able to make themselves visible and transparent owing to the very nature of the medium. Unlike popular music, television, and movies, artist celebrity is not typically incorporated into the consumer’s experience. The release of Undertale did not include sports-like press conferences in which Toby Fox would answer questions about the game’s similarities to Earthbound (Mother 2). Instead, games must be so well-refined, harmoniously crafted, unspeakably original in presentation so as to catapult it beyond reasonable impeachment. Stock music, sprites, and battling sets off alarm bells for most players.\n\nEvery so often, however, a piece of art manifests itself that is so otherwise superlative that one can overlook such perceived flaws. I recently found out that the soundtrack of Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee includes numerous elements that are, in fact, samples. I would have been roundly disappointed had I found this out as a teenager. As an adult, it doesn’t bother me because I know that art is often a matter of love and theft.\n\nIt’s also well-documented that people often perceive things that are free to be somehow inferior or undesirable, which is relevant here considering most amateur games are made available for free either through necessity (the game makes use of copyrighted assets) or magnanimity (the creator just wants their work to be enjoyed). I don’t know that this phenomenon has a name, nor do I know that it’s been studied in a professional setting and peer-reviewed, but if you wish you may refer to it as getting the “freebie-jeebies.” You may make use of this expression without credit, free of charge. Expressions like “You get what you pay for” and a general wariness of there always being a catch to such commodities have poisoned the simple act of, perhaps, just wanting someone living paycheck-to-paycheck to be able to enjoy something without adding extra strain on their budget.\n\nGranted, the freemium age has given players good reason to be on guard—that their immersion is going to be shattered by a paywall, or that the prospect of 99¢–$9.99 hats are going to be dangled in front of their faces around every corner. In this respect, truly free games represent just about the purest experience one can find in a game. Game makers can still produce a free game in pursuit of acclaim or praise, but a cursory glance at the history of such games reveals little in the way of ego-driven endeavors. Such is the will of the artist. Free games are the “mixtapes” of the video game world. We do not malign the rapper for a release of that nature—we celebrate their productivity and generosity. That samples proliferate among its tracks does not denigrate its very existence—it provides us with new perspective on old hat.\n\n“Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.”\n\nI’ve often heard—concerning various forms of art—the sentiment that when an endeavor is performed correctly or skillfully, the observer should almost forget that what they’re witnessing is effectively illusory. For example, there are some actors who are able to transform themselves so convincingly that a viewer might become partially swayed toward the notion that such is the actor’s real personality and mannerisms, or that the character being presented to them is somehow a distinct entity unto themselves.\n\nI believe the same is true of translation. One of the biggest roadblocks in creating a seamless experience seems to be a tendency to treat certain common words or phrases as gimmes. When these bits pop up during a translation effort, they often end up being translated in the exact same fashion for each instance, such that one could almost just use a “Find and Replace” function. In Japanese media—namely the Holy Trinity of anime, manga, and video games—these parts of speech end up getting trapped under a thick layer of overfamiliarity that perpetuates itself and only grows stronger as the number of works residing in that space increases.\n\nI call this “The Ganbatte Problem.” If you’ve experienced just about any work translated from Japanese, you’ve probably seen or heard a character talk about “doing their best” or impelling someone else to “do their best.” When you see this, you can be 99.9% sure that this was originally some form of the verb 頑がん張ばる. Once you understand this, you begin to see just how rote this process can get if the translator isn’t careful. Even if you don’t, it’s still easy to see patterns like this emerging and understand that there is some manner of shadowplay going on, akin to spotting a dangling boom mic.\n\nThis isn’t to say that these common translations are wrong, exactly. The issue is that translators often seem to have difficulty identifying when a word or phrase exists in some layer of idiomatic space. I say it this way because 頑張る isn’t exactly idiomatic as you probably understand it, yet it can invoke similar effects to such cliched phrases as “Keep on keepin’ on.” The other issue is that Japanese sentences are susceptible to inflation when translated into languages like English, especially if a sentence is comprised solely of a verb like 頑張る: grammatically complete in Japanese.\n\nIt is difficult to achieve a proper balance between translating a line with rightful fidelity and the ability to vary such common phrases in a way that doesn’t pervert the meaning while also controlling inflation. Speaking of “pervert,” perhaps 変へん態たい is an even better example—I rarely see this word translated in other ways such as “sicko” or “freak.”\n\nGranted, consistency is sometimes the better approach when it comes to translating a number of lines similar or identical to one another, especially in video games. If there’s a line that repeats persistently, especially one that serves a technical function, it should probably be translated the same way each time. But these turns of phrase typically don’t occupy this space in a given script, and should be treated with a different level of care than text that merely communicates something like item acquisition.\n\nI once read about makeup tricks in TV and movies involving actors and extras who get varying degrees of costume and makeup depending on how close they are to the foreground action. Sometimes, if you look closely, you can tell that background actors have had no work or dress applied at all. This sort of thing makes sense to me for translation, as well—some lines must be written off as “background actors” lest the translator waste ungodly amounts of time on relatively inconsequential details. I suspect that hackneyed “Ganbatte” lines are often seen as background actors, and in a way I wouldn’t blame anyone for feeling this way. However, those working in the field should never set out to skimp on the makeup as their default mode of operation.\n\nPerhaps this writing may do more harm than good for casual observers more readily seeing through the tears in the veil of translation. But I think we can make better translations if we simply learn to sew better veils.\n\n「これは一種のロール・プレイングなのだ。役割ロールを果たせ！役割ロールを演じきるのだ。」\n\nMetal Gear Solid was a phenomenon.\n\nThe late ’90s saw an influx of 5th-generation action-stealth games, of which Metal Gear Solid was not the first, but certainly the most celebrated. The core gameplay did not differ greatly from the MSX2 duology of Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, and it’s clear Metal Gear Solid was intended as a soft reboot. This was commonplace when a series did not have an overseas release up until a certain point in time, which is not exactly the case with Metal Gear—the first game had a European release for the MSX2, and a retooled port was created for the Famicom/NES, which itself was adapted for other systems. Despite this, most players hadn’t played Hideo Kojima’s true realization of Metal Gear, since the ported game was developed without his input and made sweeping changes. A non-canon sequel called Snake’s Revenge was also produced, which spurred Kojima to direct the true sequel.\n\nThough Metal Gear was not exactly obscure with overseas audiences during this time period, it also was not the sensation Metal Gear Solid became. The NES port, now widely regarded as inferior, was regarded then as a decent game, but did not secure a place in the personal pantheon of many players. A number of those players certainly were not even aware of the game’s development history at the time, but the discerning player must admit that it’s a flawed game even on its own merits. Despite this, it was usually included in various “best-of” lists throughout the following years, and such was its legacy that Metal Gear Solid became a highly anticipated game. Of course, it also helped that a demo was shown at E3, which was in only its third year of existence in 1997.\n\nI was nine when Metal Gear Solid was eventually released in Japan and North America in late 1998. I never owned an NES, and my tastes at the time were more along the lines of platformers and Japanese role-playing games. Final Fantasy VII had changed my life, as had Super Mario RPG before it. I did not own many titles that strove for realism, nor did I want them. Even with Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, a gritty title that I loved, there was an undercurrent of fantasy and cartoon appeal. But that game also presented a different level of challenge from JRPGs, and it wasn’t until some time later that I was actually able to beat the game without skipping around using a code. I learned to associate realism with challenge, and typically avoided more serious-looking games in my nascent period as a player.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have wanted Abe’s Oddysee if not for its inclusion on a demo disc that came with PlayStation Magazine. Metal Gear Solid was also part of one of those discs, but I never had that one. It’s hard for me to guess whether or not I would have wanted the full game if I’d had the demo, but I can tell you that an EGM2 strategy guide for the game did fascinate me. I would read about the progression of the entire game and what the player would be expected to do, over and over, yet I still felt daunted by the expected difficulty of the game. I felt close to the game without having ever experienced its gameplay or narrative. Perhaps this is because of its colorful characters. Through its veneer of realism, names like “Revolver Ocelot” and “Psycho Mantis” indicated to me that there was something more to its universe. I knew the game liked to break the fourth wall, having seen screenshots of the tricks Mantis pulls on the player.\n\nWhen Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty came out, I was 12. Part of me was still daunted by games I perceived as difficult, but by then I felt to Metal Gear Solid as much of a connection one can feel to a game without ever having played a single second of it. I was excited to finally get my hands on the series. I don’t quite remember the circumstances, but I’m almost certain I played it on the easiest setting.\n\nIn retrospect, it’s interesting that while Metal Gear Solid can function as a soft reboot should the need be there, its sequel is surprisingly accessible to those new to the series, as well. In fact, Sons of Liberty does more to catch the player up on the events of the first Solid game than that game does for its two predecessors. Of course, the relationship between the events of the two Solid games eventually proves key to understanding the very fabric of Sons of Liberty, so that’s probably more the point. It became known as one of the first “meta” narratives in games, or at least the one most sensational and discussed up to that point in history.\n\nPerhaps none of this is news to you, aside from the mundane details of my personal history. But it was necessary to frame the events leading up to when players would first hear the quote I included at the beginning of the essay. In the English version of the game, this would be the point when Col. Campbell, being impersonated by an AI, tells Raiden, “This is a type of role-playing game. The point is that you play out your part.”\n\nIn the twenty years since its release, there has been said just about all there is to say about Metal Gear Solid 2. People have had time to get over their initial feelings about the game, whatever they were, digest everything, and offer rational explanations for everything that happens in the game. Not only that, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots put to rest many existing theories about the game, as well as wrapping up many other loose ends. But one thing I’ve never seen discussed is the idea of Metal Gear Solid 2 being a type of role-playing game.\n\nA similar dilemma often arises in discussions of the Legend of Zelda series. I’ve long been a proponent of the argument that Zelda is not an RPG series, though until now I’ve never forced myself to come face-to-face with the fact that I don’t have a coherent set of reasons as to why it’s not. I suppose it’s because oftentimes RPGs—especially JRPGs—must be diagnosed rather than pass a specific litmus test. Most people know a JRPG when they see it without actively thinking about its specific components. But why is that? Why do we inherently know that Dark Souls is not the same thing as Dragon Quest?\n\nIt’s here that I’d like to point out that there is a subtle distinction between the Japanese and English versions of the Campbell AI’s above quote. In English, Raiden asks, “My role? Why do you keep saying that?” which prompts the AI to quip, “Why not?” followed by the rest of the line. In Japanese, Raiden says, 「また役割ロールか？」which is really more like he’s saying, “Again with this ‘role’ thing?” to which the AI replies, “This is a kind of roleplay. Play your part! Carry out your role.” Not much of a difference, but I think it’s important to note that the AI doesn’t exactly say “role-playing game” as if to refer to the Big Shell mission and Metal Gear Solid 2 in its entirety as a role-playing video game, even if the player will inevitably be forced to think about the whole game from that kind of abstract perspective. The statement is a bit more coy than that, giving the player a moment to reflect before presenting them with the very next Codec call, where the AI flatly implores, “Raiden, turn the game console off right now!”\n\nBut what if Metal Gear Solid 2 is a kind of role-playing game? What if it’s a JRPG? What would we need to be there for that to be true? Various amateur pieces have attempted to put to rest what is and isn’t a JRPG, but no one discussion or dissertation I’ve read over the years has really hit the mark. Even the Wikipedia article titled “History of Eastern role-playing video games,” while it defines some characteristics and noteworthy innovations of the subgenre as it sought to define itself, does not ever make any specific, pared-down judgment on what a JRPG actually is.\n\nAs I replayed the game with the idea in mind, I noted many aspects that seemed to be playing into JRPG conventions. Raiden could easily be a JRPG protagonist both in looks and personality. His relationship with Snake is comparable to other relationships between plucky younger characters and gruff veterans like Tidus and Auron of Final Fantasy X. Emma’s death is one of a long list of cute female characters that are mercilessly slain. Raiden is eventually given a sword: the traditional JRPG protagonist weapon, which allows him to stand against hordes of enemies with automatic firearms. The game even has a minor progression system in the way the player can level up the grip gauge.\n\nI’d be lying if I said these similarities are what drew me to the game in the first place. Raiden’s existence and the game’s general structure were closely guarded secrets prior to the game’s release. Like every other player, I assumed I’d be playing as Solid Snake for the entire game. But it’s a miracle I stuck with the game for its entire length considering how few action games I’d completed or even shown interest in by that point in my life. I didn’t understand much of what was going on in the game even prior to the point at which reality comes unhinged and an AI begins talking about roles and game consoles. Why did I bother seeing the game through to the end?\n\nIt’s because the deconstructivist nature of Sons of Liberty unwittingly lends itself so well to a broader sort of appeal. If the series isn’t treating its own canon that rigidly, then it doesn’t risk alienating players who might otherwise feel left out of the loop. Part of the point is that Solidus and the Patriots deliberately recreated the events of Metal Gear Solid as a way of testing the S3 Plan on Raiden, and on the surface that makes playing the first game seem essential. On the other hand, one could just as easily argue that Metal Gear Solid 2 functions perfectly as a standalone experience and even that the details of prior events are inherently dubious. Solid Snake himself is quick to dismiss such notions whenever prompted:\n\n“Legend? A legend is nothing but fiction. Someone tells it, someone else\n\nremembers, everybody passes it on.\n\nAt the time I first played Metal Gear Solid 2, that’s all the previous games were to me: legends. I had no somatic imprinting that told me whether or not what I was playing was truly Metal Gear. I was well-versed in “Snake Tales,” but I hadn’t lived them as Solid Snake had done. I didn’t even have any particular hatred for Raiden, and if we’re being honest, the fact that he was meant to seem somewhat pathetic—especially in comparison to Solid Snake—went over my head as a preteen. I became aware of the negative reaction to him, but to me this was no different than someone preferring the protagonist of one Final Fantasy to another. Raiden was not terribly different from Cloud Strife, in my mind. The fact that Cloud rode the coattails of a more significant soldier for a time, even bordering on impersonation, never bothered me. It didn’t seem to bother anyone else, either.\n\nUpon replay, I chose to reassess Raiden with a more objective mindset. I became aware of the notion that the player-character in any given game can seem more or less competent depending on the competency of the player. It seems obvious in retrospect, but I wonder just how much the presentation of a character affects player aptitude. If the player is told flat-out that they aren’t good enough, or are fighting an uphill battle in terms of their reputation, does that cause them to play down to their purported level? On the flip side, does being given control of a living legend make them feel more capable from the outset?\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2 lets you judge for yourself whether there’s really any difference between Solid Snake and Raiden by letting you control the two of them back-to-back. Functionally, they’re near-identical. Raiden doesn’t struggle with any physical aspect of the job, nor does he incur any mental break that renders him incapable of performing his duties despite his trauma. His struggles with his girlfriend Rose, byproducts of his harrowing past, darkly mirror those of real-life soldiers. He even displays somewhat remarkable empathy and poise in the gentle manner he guides Emma through various hazards. It’s Raiden who eliminates the Harrier, a more advanced craft that the Hind taken down by Snake in the previous game. It’s Raiden who picks Vamp off of Emma despite Snake being a quarter of the distance away. If he’s not a hero, then neither is Snake. Raiden begins the exercise a troubled warrior, and tries to come to terms with his past along the way as he seeks to differentiate himself.\n\n“Don’t obsess over words so much. Find the meaning behind the words,\n\nthen decide. You can find your own name. And your own future.“\n\nThe JRPG classification is more of a feeling than it is structure. They don’t often embody traditional roleplaying, nor are they always even of Japanese origin. What seems to tie JRPGs to RPGs as a whole is the emphasis on storytelling, and the ability to affect various outcomes within those stories. This can be something as crucial as deciding whether Meryl lives or dies, or as minor as handing an electric shaver to Snake so he can clean himself up for future cinematics. For me, the exact classification of Metal Gear Solid 2 doesn’t really matter. But I can’t deny there’s something about its particular spirit that makes me feel like I’m ロール・プレイング.\n\nQ: Is there anything I should know beforehand that’s essential to gameplay?\n\nA: Please refer to the Adventure Diary, where you can read the Beginner’s Guide. This item should be accessible from the moment you’re first able to control your character. Most of what you’ll need to know should be in here, with other bits of knowledge peppered throughout the game, mainly whenever things first become relevant.\n\nThis is also where you’ll be able to read various lore books, recount certain things that have been told to you, and review miscellaneous memos and hints. Some of the stories and history books hint at enemy weaknesses and other solutions, but many are just flavor, so don’t read too heavily into every other word. You may find that certain characters will tell you explicitly if there’s a relevant book to some situation.\n\nQ: Why can I only input kana when I go to enter character names?\n\nA: Make sure you’re booting up the game using the EasyRPG Player included in the “game” folder (please consider visiting their website if you wish to support the project in some way). Once you’ve done this, you should be able to cycle through kana, Latin letters, and symbols whenever the naming screen comes up. If you boot up the game using the RPG_RT file or what have you, you’re going to run into issues. This is an inherent flaw in RPG Maker 2000 that arose once the software was ported to other locales and was never addressed, to my knowledge.\n\nPlease note that this is actually important in regard to making progress in the game. There are several sections in the game where this function is required in order to solve riddles. The game will ask you to “name a character,” then check your input against a pre-set name that represents the correct answer. If you aren’t able to do this, you will eventually hit a point beyond which you cannot progress, and a few pieces of side content will be impossible to finish as well.\n\nQ: At one time you were looking for graphical help. Is that still the case?\n\nA: I am not currently looking for any more submissions for the menus and other graphics. If you were previously working on some when I still had the link up, you may submit them nonetheless. I am theoretically open to the idea of having more than one option for players.\n\nQ: Does this game have an English-language community?\n\nA: I’ve created a subreddit! It’s kind of barebones at the moment.\n\nQ: Why did you translate [name or line] like you did?\n\nA: At some point, I will release a list of things people have questioned or inquired about regarding the game’s translation along with my explanations. If you think you’ve found a goof, or would simply like to know my rationale on something, please submit any and all questions or concerns. You may find your answer in a future post.\n\nQ: I’ve found a typo, error, or something that just looks off. Can I report it?\n\nA: Please do! Feel free to submit anything you’ve found. If possible, please take a screenshot, and try to include information like the location of the map node (if relevant, and not already visible).\n\nQ: I’m having trouble installing Japanese RTP. Do you have any further instructions?\n\nA: As of version 1.01, English RTP has been included with the game files instead, and should work fine thanks to the EasyRPG Player. If you’re trying to play version 1.00, or independently downloaded Japanese RTP thinking that’s what you’d need to use, please download the latest build from the front page instead."
