(North America)\n\npop'n music Sunny Park\n\nRelease Information\n\nLocation test dates: June 28th to July 1st, 2012\n\nRelease dates: December 5th, 2012 (new cabinets), December 12th, 2012 (upgrade kits)\n\nSoundtrack release dates:\n\noriginal soundtrack vol.1: July 17th, 2013\n\noriginal soundtrack vol.2: March 5th, 2014\n\nGeneral Information / Changes\n\nTheme: park.\n\nFirst pop'n music arcade game since the original 1998 game to not have a number in the title.\n\nThe rival for a song is displayed on the right side of the music select screen when choosing a song, not unlike the first five pop'n music arcade titles.\n\nLicensed, non-cover songs use the jacket of the CDs/singles they're from on the right side of the music select screen, as opposed to showing the rival character.\n\nRating system is now expanded from 1-43 to 1-50. Most songs are upped 6-7 levels to compensate. BATTLE charts were not changed.\n\nSongs are now grouped into folders not unlike beatmania IIDX.\n\nYou can also choose your character using song folders divided by game, too.\n\nFirst pop'n music arcade game to have individual game folders for each CS pop'n music game.\n\nDuring the location test period of pop'n music Sunny Park, the song banners were absent. However, the banners were present again on the final release.\n\nAll artist and song titles now use a singular font.\n\nUnique characters or symbols in song or artist titles have been removed.\n\nYou can switch from genre sorting to song title sorting on the songwheel by pressing the 00 button on the eAMUSEMENT keypad (you no longer have to press the left yellow twice).\n\nAll genres in the TV/J-POP category songs has been replaced by their respective titles.\n\nDifficulty changes are now done by pressing the left or right yellow buttons.\n\n5-Buttons has been replaced by EASY, which uses a select number of buttons, as opposed to only the center five buttons. Not every song has an EASY chart.\n\nSongs with EASY charts are placed on top of the songlist of their respective folders.\n\n5-Button mode was still playable in the location test and even included on the new Sunny Park songs in the location test. This suggests EASY mode was a late addition to the game.\n\nThe TV/ANIME category has been renamed テレビ・Jポップ (TV/J-POP).\n\nThe BEMANI category now shows songs that were present only on the following BEMANI games: beatmania IIDX, DanceDanceRevolution, GuitarFreaks & DrumMania (both original and XG/GITADORA), jubeat, REFLEC BEAT, and SOUND VOLTEX.\n\nAs a result, the former ee'MALL songs that don't fit any of the above categories are gone from the BEMANI category, and they can only be found on the NAME, LEVEL, and ARTIST categories.\n\npop'n music originals that had/were arrangements in inactive BEMANI games were also removed from the BEMANI category (such as 夜間行).\n\nLicensed songs that have also appeared on other BEMANI games are now included in the BEMANI category.\n\nSongs that originated on a currently inactive BEMANI game, but that were crossed over to an active BEMANI game, can now be found in that active BEMANI game's category.\n\nAll songs now use one singular MISS/FEVER animation, introduced in Sunny Park.\n\nEASY and NORMAL MODEs are now merged into a brand new NORMAL MODE.\n\nBATTLE MODE now always has COOLs on.\n\nLicensed songs (except for Get Off of My Way) are not keysounded, a first in pop'n music.\n\nThe HinaBitter♪ and FLOOR INFECTION songs are also not keysounded.\n\nAll the characters' 3P palettes that could be obtained by inputting the code found at the back of certain pop'n music 19/20 collectible cards (as well as the new ones for Sunny Park) were moved into a brand new character category, the Special Color category.\n\nOther 3P palettes, such as the URA 3P palettes from pop'n music 11, weren't moved to this category, though.\n\nOPTION PREVIEW, a small window showing what the HIGH-SPEED, HIDDEN/SUDDEN or CHARA/BEAT-POP will be like for a song, is introduced. It is shown right before the beginning of a song, during the options screen before play.\n\nIf speed changes are present, previews will be shown for the lowest and highest BPM indicated on the BPM display.\n\nA new feature called Event Booster lets you use PASELI to speed up the process of unlocking songs.\n\nOnly pop'n music arcade title screen with no voices whatsoever if no coins are inserted.\n\nFirst pop'n music game since pop'n music 17 THE MOVIE in which the game's final song unlock doesn't feature its own unique movie.\n\nFirst pop'n music game since pop'n music 14 FEVER! with no REMIXes with MZD as the rival character.\n\nFirst pop'n music arcade game where Sanae Shintani has no new songs she sings in.\n\nFirst pop'n music arcade game since pop'n music 9 with no new TOMOSUKE song on the default songlist.\n\nFirst pop'n music game since pop'n music 3 where none of the game's licenses appear on a soundtrack.\n\nFinal pop'n music arcade game to date where all of the previous game's hidden songs are unlocked by default in the next game at launch.\n\neAMUSEMENT support ended for pop'n music Sunny Park ended on June 25th, 2014, the same day its successor - pop'n music ラピストリア - began.\n\nStaff Information\n\npop'n music Sunny Park OST Vol.1 Booklet Credits\n\npop'n music Sunny Park OST Vol.2 Booklet Credits\n\nFull Song List\n\npop'n music Sunny Park Full Song List\n\nDefault Songs\n\nNote: Songs listed with a grey background have been removed from pop'n music Sunny Park.\n\nGenre Song Title Artist BPM Character Normal Mode Battle 5 Button Normal Hyper EX Normal Hyper TV / J-POP Default マジLOVE1000% マジLOVE1000% ST☆RISH 129 KEIGO★ [17-2P] 4 15 27 36 9 16 オレンジ オレンジ PooooN 182 Jyun&Shingo [19-1P] 5 16 26 34 9 17 つけまつける つけまつける きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ 145 Mimi [TV&ANIME-CANDY CANDY] 3 16 23 29 8 15 オリオンをなぞる オリオンをなぞる UNISON SQUARE GARDEN 182 Sora [14-2P] 6 17 28 37 10 18 猛烈宇宙交響曲・第七楽章「無限の愛」 猛烈宇宙交響曲・第七楽章「無限の愛」 ももいろクローバーZ 174 Suisei Laura [16-1P] 4 17 24 39 6 11 Added on December 5th, 2012 空想メソロギヰ 空想メソロギヰ 妖精帝國 115 odile [17-1P] 7 18 27 38 14 23 Added on February 18th, 2013 Get Off of My Way Get Off of My Way MAN WITH A MISSION 135 DJ TSUYOSHI [15-2P] 4 20 32 40 9 16 いぇす！ゆゆゆ☆ゆるゆり♪♪ いぇす！ゆゆゆ☆ゆるゆり♪♪ 七森中☆ごらく部 182 SANAE♥chan [4-2P] 6 22 31 38 13 19 Added on May 15th, 2013 恋は渾沌の隷也 恋は渾沌の隷也 後ろから這いより隊G 158 *うさぬこ* [SP-3P] 4 23 32 41 9 17 にんじゃりばんばん にんじゃりばんばん きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ 130 AYAME [18-1P] 3 18 29 38 11 23 Added on July 3rd, 2013 マジLOVE2000% マジLOVE2000% ST☆RISH 141 ice [SP-1P] 4 21 30 37 15 20 sister's noise sister's noise fripSide 144 SHOKO [SP-2P] 5 23 31 39 12 21 Added on September 19th, 2013 天ノ弱 天ノ弱 164 feat.

Once all of a song's charts are unlocked, that character will no longer appear in the park.\n\nYou can also unlock popple parts by clearing various conditions.
