        "text": "How to Play Piano in FF7 Rebirth\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe piano is a tricky minigame at first, so here's some tips on how to A-Rank each piece:\n\nThe most important tip is that Dorian doesn't care at what speed you play the piece. You can A-Rank them all at the slowest speed and he'll still recognize your efforts.\n\nA-Rank is easier than it looks: you can miss 10-15% of the notes entirely and still have enough points to pass.\n\nBefore you start playing, you may want to listen to the tracks as heard in the Final Fantasy VII: Original Soundtrack, which is available on Apple Music and Spotify. This will allow you to get familiar with the original piece so that you can anticipate upcoming notes and get a feel for the piece's character.\n\nIt's worth noting that the track \"Two Legs? Nothin' to It!\" is called \"It's Hard to Stand on Both Feet !\" in this soundtrack.\n\nAudio lag may also be a hindrance, so here's two ways to solve it (thanks to GF-Lionheart in the comments!):\n\nIf you have a USB headset, use that via one of the PS5's USB ports.\n\nFor standard headphones, you can connect them to the 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom of the DualSense controller. Then, go to Settings > Accessories > Controller (General) and change \"Communication Method\" to \"Use USB Cable\". This further reduces lag when your DualSense is connected to your PS5 via a USB cable.\n\nWhile playing, the next note you need to play on a given analog stick will be highlighted in blue. This is important for the faster-paced songs where several notes will be coming up at once.\n\nYou have a fair bit of leeway to nail a note: all that matters is if the stick is in the right position at some point in the timing window. This means you can hit an adjacent-but-not-upcoming note by accident and still be able to play the note you were meant to.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! A song may seem too difficult on the first few tries, but this is often simply because you aren't familiar with it yet. Keep at it and learn the parts of the song, and you'll be hitting those notes before you know it.\n\nPiano Rewards\n\nThere is no reward for S-Ranking all pieces at the highest speed, but there are individual rewards for completing each piece at A-Rank at any speed. You can see the rewards for each piano music below, but in general, you'll get some Lv. 2 and Lv. 3 materia!\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nOn Our Way\n\nOn Our Way\n\nLocation: Junon Region - Crow’s Nest - Settlement - CAS Base Camp\n\nPrerequisite: Complete the “When Words Won’t Do” Side Quest\n\nDifficulty: 1\n\nReward: Lv. 2 HP Up Materia\n\nThe first piano in the game can be found in Crow’s Nest, the settlement in the eastern mountains of the Junon Region. Because of this, you cannot get to it until you complete the “Well-Earned Rest” story mission, and then the “When Words Won’t Do” Side Quest after that.\n\nOnce you’ve gained entry into Crow’s Nest, head into the large building in the northwestern part of the map, which is the local tavern. Then, look right to find it in the corner. You gain the \"On Your Way\" sheet.\n\nTifa’s Theme\n\nTifa’s Theme\n\nIf you were expecting to find this Sheet Music in Chapter 1 like in the demo, surprise! It's actually located in Costa del Sol in the full game.\n\nLocation: Corel Region - Costa del Sol - City Center - Main Street - The Royal Coast\n\nPrerequisite: Get the “Fun While It Lasts” objective in Chapter 6.\n\nDifficulty: 2\n\nReward: Lv. 2 MP Up Materia\n\nThe second piano is located in The Royal Coast hotel, which is the large hotel in the middle of Costa del Sol’s Main Street area. Unfortunately, you cannot access it as soon as you arrive at the start of Chapter 6.\n\nInstead, you’ll have to wait until you gain control of Tifa and Aerith during the “Fun While It Lasts” objective, where performing on the piano is part of the “Royal Coast Concert” sub-objective. The \"Tifa's Theme\" sheet can be found on the piano.\n\nAlso, Dorian will not appear at this piano until after you’ve completed Chapter 6.\n\nBarret’s Theme\n\nBarret’s Theme\n\nLocation: Corel Region - North Corel - Settlement - Lookout -Old Storeroom - Rock Bottom\n\nDifficulty: 3\n\nReward: Lv. 2 Warding Materia\n\nThis piano can be found in the settlement known as North Corel, which you reach after the mine cart segment of Chapter 7.\n\nAt the settlement, head for the wooden walkway between Maghnata Books and the Weapons Vendor to get up to the upper level. Directly ahead will be the Rock Bottom bar: head inside to find this piano on the opposite side.\n\nCinco de Chocobo\n\nCinco de Chocobo\n\nLocation: Gongaga Region - Gongaga - Laurel Hill\n\nDifficulty: 3\n\nReward: Lv. 2 Steadfast Block Materia\n\nThis piano can be found in the village of Gongaga, which is in the Gongaga Region (of course). You’ll visit this village as part of the story.\n\nThe building with the piano in it will be on the northeastern side of the river, Laurel Hill. It’ll be south of Memorial Hill, southwest of Zhijun the Queen’s Blood player, and west of the stone bridge.\n\nTwo Legs? Nothin’ To It\n\nTwo Legs? Nothin’ To It\n\nLocation: Cosmo Canyon Region - Cosmo Canyon - Water Grotto\n\nDifficulty: 4\n\nReward: Lv. 2 Empowerment Materia\n\nThis Materia is located in the Cosmo Canyon settlement in the northeastern corner of the Cosmo Canyon Region, which you visit as part of the story.\n\nHead for the Water Grotto section, the eastern-most point of the settlement, where you can find the inn Rest Spot and a Queen’s Blood player. Head for the back past reception to find the piano, to the right of the doorway to the outdoor eating areas. The \"Two Legs? Nothin’ To It\" sheet can be found on the piano.\n\nAerith’s Theme\n\nAerith’s Theme\n\nLocation: Nibel Region - Nibelheim - Village - Upper Level - Treatment Center - 2F\n\nDifficulty: 3\n\nReward: Lv. 3 Binding Materia\n\nThis sheet music is found in Nibelheim in Tifa’s old house, now known as the treatment center.\n\nHead for the Water Tower Square, then enter the eastern building. Go upstairs, make a U-turn to your left, then enter the farthest door on your right. The piano will be in the back of this room.\n\nLet the Battles Begin!\n\nLet the Battles Begin!\n\nLocation: Nibel Region - Nibelheim - Village - Upper Level - Treatment Center - 2F\n\nDifficulty: 5\n\nThis bonus sheet music is the reward for A-Ranking the previous six sheet music pieces, then talking to Dorian. You’ll also get a Level 4 Healing Materia and the Peerless Pianist Collector's Item, too!\n\nOne-Winged Angel\n\nOne-Winged Angel"
