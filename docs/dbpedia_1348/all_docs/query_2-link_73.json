The shipping to here is a bit pricey if order for only one book, But for me it’s worth it. Happy with the purchase\n\nThe two beautiful books arrived in perfect condition in under 2 days via DHL from Kyoto to Toronto! The books were well protected with stiff cardboard backing, wrapped with plastic bag and bubble sheets, then cushioned inside a box the exact size of the books. The thank you labels added a nice touch. Special thanks to Takenaka-san who kindly answered my email inquiries promptly.\n\nFujii Kaze’s arrangements and chord progressions are superb. I will be enjoying these scores for a very long time. Thanks to everyone at Sheet Music Japan!\n\nThis is my second purchase, the customer service is excellent, the quality of the books is good. Let's not miss out their speed as they shipped it out as soon as I placed the order. 5 stars for the service they provided!\n\nFast, secured delivery from Japan to North America.

I believe that our world needs this.\n\nI was so impressed with sheet music Japan’s website shopping experience- everything was so simple and straightforward. When my order arrived, it was beautifully and perfectly packaged. It had been raining a lot here, and I was afraid that my book would be damaged by water. However, the book was neatly wrapped with an additional layer of plastic for extra protection. Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to ordering again!\n\nThe package has been arrived few minutes ago and I am super happy! The care of the label for me and for the Deliver man is amazing!

It was a pleasure doing business with you, and I am truly grateful for your service.\n\nI have been looking around for sheet music of works by Piazzolla for piano solo and duo. Finally found them here! Excellent quality in terms of maintaining the balance between authenticity and unique ad lib. The print quality is great as well.\n\nIt might be good to have a sample page on the website to demonstrate the quality of the sheet music."
