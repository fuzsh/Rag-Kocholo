        "text": "The discs come in separate single jewel cases, packaged in a slipcase. Each jewel case has its own cover with Yoshitaka Amano artwork on the front and inside; tracklists are on the back of their respective jewel cases. The liner notes are separate and have generally the same content as the Squaresoft version, except the format and some artwork are different. These liner notes also include Amano artwork of Syldra, and Butz and Lenna (?) riding on some kind of creature, neither of which are in the SS version. Also, it does NOT have the artwork of Butz and Faris that the SS version has, and the photos of Amano and Nobuo Uematsu are larger.Comes in a slightly larger single jewel case that holds both CDs. (The back of the jewel case is blank.) The CDs are supposedly gold-pressed, but I can't verify that. The liner notes are the same as the first pressing and come outside the jewel case. Tracklisting is the same as the first pressing. I found this set secondhand, so there may be other elements that were included in it that I haven't described here.\n\nInformation about this set is sketchy, and my attempts at searching the 'Net for more info haven't turned up anything. The kanji on the front say, as far as I can make out, \"20-man-mai toppo kinen,\" which translate vaguely into \"breakthrough commemoration of 200,000 pieces,\" which I and a few other people have interpreted to mean that this limited-edition set was made to commemorate the selling of 200,000 copies. But I highly doubt that 200,000 copies of the soundtrack were sold, so I'm thinking it commemorates 200,000 copies of the FF5 game sold. If you have any info about this set, please let me know!The CDs come in separate single jewel cases with separate obis. Tracklists in kana are printed on the back of each CD cover. Neither CD has liner notes. Disc 1 also comes with a sticker with the FF5 soundtrack logo (measuring about 3.5 inches by 4.5 inches), while disc 2 has a sticker of the cover of the FF1 and 2 soundtrack (measuring about 4.5 inches square) and also comes with a customer survey sheet. These stickers may have been placed randomly in the CDs, so you might come upon different ones."
