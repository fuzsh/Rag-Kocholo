        "text": "The Theatrhythm Final Bar Line song list is absolutely huge. In total, there are 385 songs available in the base version of the game - and Square Enix has concrete plans to add a range more music tracks to this absolutely enormous music game. This page, as you might've guessed, is going to list all of the songs in the game - so you know what to expect.\n\nAdvertisement. Keep scrolling for more\n\nThe initial 385 tracks you'll find as part of the game on launch are all from the Final Fantasy series - while later on, you'll be able to purchase season pass access to DLC packs for music from Square Enix game series' including Nier, Mana, SaGa, and Chrono Cross & Trigger. In addition to all this, there's also a Digital Deluxe version, which adds a bunch more Final Fantasy songs to enjoy. This page covers it all, including when you can expect each DLC pack to release.\n\nThis list has been compiled with the help of our friends over at French FF fan site Finaland, and was pulled together with information from various official Square Enix resources.\n\nMusic Tracks in the Base Game\n\nDigital Deluxe Version Extras\n\nSeason Pass DLC Music\n\nMusic Tracks included with Theatrhythm Final Bar Line\n\nThe song list for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is very large, but that's in part because of much of it has appeared in the three previous Theatrhythm games - though there's still some all-new additions to this game, all of which are noted below.\n\nIn gameplay terms, the three core pillars of Theatrhythm are retained. Each stage is one of three types - EMS (Event Music Stage), FMS (Field Music Stage), or BMS (Battle Music Stage), with the play setup and mechanics differing slightly from one style to the next. Where we know, we've listed what type of stage each song is set to. In some cases, a song has multiple stages of multiple types available.\n\nFF1 / FF2 / FF3 / FF4 / FF5 / FF6 / FF7 / FF8 / FF9\n\nFF10 / FF11 / FF12 / FF13 / FF14 / FF15 / Spin-Offs & CDs\n\nAdvertisement.
