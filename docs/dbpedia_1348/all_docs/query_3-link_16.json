        "text": "Olivia “Livvy” Dunne isn’t done yet with her gymnastics career.\n\nThe 21-year-old — who helped bring the first NCAA Championship to LSU’s program in April — announced Monday she will return for her fifth and final year of eligibility with the Lady Tigers, sharing the news in a social media video captioned, “Not Dunne Yet.”\n\n“These past four years have changed my life. There is something about putting on a purple and gold leotard,” Dunne began. “… And no matter how many opportunities come my way off the mat, there’s just something about LSU. And that’s why I’m here to say, I’m not done yet.\n\n“Here’s to year 5, baby.”\n\nMonday’s news comes after Dunne recently told The Post in an exclusive interview that she was contemplating her gymnastics future.\n\nThe New Jersey native also ruled out an Olympics run.\n\n“I don’t think I’m going to try for the Olympics or anything after, since I once competed for Team USA and I closed that chapter and went to LSU,” she said.\n\nDunne was one of four seniors — among Elena Arenas, Haleigh Bryant and Chase Brock — on the 2023-24 gymnastics roster, which included seven graduate students.\n\nBryant, the 2024 NCAA All-Around Champion, and Brock both announced they will return to the Tigers for their final year of eligibility in 2025.\n\nArenas, who was limited due to a back injury in her senior season, retired from gymnastics and announced the news in a June 27 Instagram post.\n\nThe Lady Tigers secured the national title with a score of 198.225 to beat California (197.850), Utah (197.800) and Florida (197.4375) at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth.\n\n“The national championship, that was obviously the end goal,” Dunne told The Post. “That was the cherry on top of my senior year. It’s just so cool to be able to make history like with my whole team.”\n\nDunne — who has more than 13 million followers across Instagram and TikTok — became a face of the name, image and likeness (NIL) era and earns a reported seven figures annually."
