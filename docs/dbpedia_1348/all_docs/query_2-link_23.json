        "text": "Hello and welcome to another set of bonus posts, this time for Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts alike! Apologies for the lack of heads-up on the Final Fantasy side, there was some rescheduling. Brought to you today by the equal power of Disney magic and the magic of me writing most of this years ago, some coverage of the Theatrhythm series of games!\n\nFor those who don’t know, the Theatrhythm series is Square’s in-house Rhythm game franchise, and its Kingdom Hearts-themed close cousin, Melody of Memory, is going up on the blog soon. As it happens, I played Theatrhythm years ago as a “Solo Marathon” (alongside Chocobo Tales and Pictlogica Final Fantasy) before we widened the Marathon’s scope to include DS and 3DS games, and wrote up a Journal to accompany it. Once Melody of Memory came up, I figured it would be best to upload the Theatrhythm Journals early to help contextualize things, and that means bonus content for all! These bonus posts will be going up on Tuesdays for three weeks starting today, and will cover every entry in the series except the most recent (Theatrhythm Final Bar Line for the Switch), since I haven’t played that one yet, and it post-dates the Kingdom Hearts game anyways.\n\nYou know, normally I don’t add made-up words to my spellchecker for Marathon stuff, but “Theatrhythm” didn’t give me much choice, did it?\n\nThis is going to be a fairly short series, because despite spanning four games at this point, these games are almost all mechanics, which are easy to learn, hard to master… meaning someone who hasn’t mastered it, like me, can’t say very much! I’ll have to expand this series of blog posts later, definitely with coverage of Final Bar Line, and maybe even with a discussion of Final Fantasy’s musical releases…? But that’s all for the future.\n\nIt’s worth noting that I played my Solo Marathon entries on an actual 3DS with actual Theatrhythm carts. As a result, I don’t have any real footage from my run and the pictures you’re seeing in this post are last-minute replacements from the very start of their respective games, missing more advanced game modes and features. Still, the Solo Marathon has its upsides. Kyle and I will eventually play the games together, see all the major features and whatnot, but the games’ so-called “campaigns” are so vapid, empty, and time-consuming that I’m not sure we were ever going to play the campaigns in full. In other words, it was probably a blessing I did these on my own time, because I did get to the end of the campaigns that way!\n\nFor now, let’s start our little history with the first 3DS game. For starters, would somebody please tell me how to pronounce this Play-Doh ball of a title? It’s “Theatre-rhythm,” right? Not “Thee-at-rhythm?” Okay, good. The plot in Thumbelina Final Fantasy is a variant of Dissidia’s (more on that later, obviously): Cosmos and Chaos are gods, and they created the world, but keep fighting one another. The central difference, alongside a lighter narrative tone, is that there’s a Crystal involved called the Music Crystal. Chaos has recently grown powerful, and the Crystal dimmed, so it’s up to you to restore its light by gathering “Rhythmia” from the world by playing rhythm games with famous Final Fantasy tunes. Of course, straight out of Joseph Campbell! The game was released in 2012, and features music and characters from the first thirteen mainline Final Fantasy games, with absolutely zero acknowledgement of the actively tanking, original FFXIV. Rhythmia is basically points awarded for doing well in the Rhythm games, and you’ll need hundreds of thousands of them to save the world.\n\nI should note that this Journal is doesn’t cover the iOS version of Theatrthythm, and for good reason: not only is it no longer around, but it only came with two songs (“One-Winged Angel” and “Zanarkand”) and rest had to be bought as DLC at a buck a pop!\n\nThe game starts with you selecting a party of four, though thirteen characters are unlocked by default: the heroic reps from Dissidia at the time. That is to say: the Warrior of Light, nominally from FFI but more accurately created for Dissidia itself; Firion from FFII; a nondescript Onion Knight from FFIII Famicom; Paladin Cecil Harvey from FFIV (unlike Dissidia Cecil, he never appears in Dark Knight form, but the sequel would give him Darkness as a starting ability in an homage to his original Job); Freelancer Bartz Klauser from FFV; Terra Branford from FFVI; Cloud Strife from FFVII; Squall Leonhart from FFVIII; Zidane Tribal from FFIX; Tidus from FFX; Shantotto, the NPC rep for FFXI; Vaan from FFXII; and Lightning from FFXIII.\n\nThe characters here use a signature, chibi style, which can trace its origins back to Kingdom Hearts Mobile, seemingly by an artist named “Adachi” and their solo studio, Monster Octopus. The art also features in Airborne Brigade and would arguably go back to Kingdom Hearts in refined form for Kingdom Hearts χ.\n\nIf you’re at all familiar with Rhythm games, you’re probably wondering how an RPG party could possibly factor in. This is a pure reflex genre, right? And the music limits your inputs, so it’s not like a Platformer or a Fighting game, where characters might have unique abilities to help you navigate the stage. And you’re right! Despite the game opening with a character select screen, the characters are less important than the gameplay itself, so how about we swap things around and talk about the core gameplay before any “parties” or “characters”?\n\nAt the start of the campaign, you can only play in Series Mode. In this mode, you play through a set of five songs from one of the numbered Final Fantasy games of your choice. Each set includes a song from each of the three main modes: one “Battle Music Stage,” one “Field Music Stage” theme, and one “Event Music Stage,” in some order or another. Sandwiching those three are an opening and ending theme that share a fourth game mode that’s never given a proper name, and is only ever addressed as “Bonus Game.” After you complete a game in Series Mode, you unlock its three main songs for free-play – the Bonus Game songs can go rot. While most Rhythm games have difficulty selection from the off, because they’re a fairly consistent genre where you can carry over your real-life skills from other games and easily skip the casual modes, Theatrhythm 1 forces you to play on Easy at first, which was a dumb move, but we’ll talk more about it as we go along.\n\nLet’s go through them each game modes in the order… ehhhh, let’s sayyyy… in the order you see in FFI’s Series Mode. We we start with the Bonus Game for one of the game’s opening songs. This is usually the title screen theme or something from an opening cutscene. Unfortunately, that means that most of them are just “Prelude,” aka the “Crystal Theme.” Over. And over. Again. It doesn’t help that the Bonus Game itself is tremendously boring. It’s so bad that the devs were polite enough to provide a “Skip” button, but the Rhythmia payoff isn’t half bad, and so I’ve never had the heart to skip them!\n\nHere’s how the Bonus Game works. The Music Crystal appears in the middle of a black screen, and music notes are released towards it in time with the song. Your job is to tap the screen as the notes reach the Crystal. The game is not particularly informative about whether you’re supposed to tap at the exact centre, or exactly where the target hotspot starts and ends. but one assumes. While this is happening, a paragraph summarizing the game’s opening story flies by, Star Wars style. That’s it. The notes are released from around the edges of the screen, resulting in a spiral pattern. Bear in mind that the 3DS is widescreen, which means you have less time to respond to notes that fly in from the top and bottom. If I had an objection with this minigame… actually, I have plenty of objections! I think it’s boring and pointless! The devs clearly agreed in the long run because it never made a return in the sequels. But if I had a smaller objection, it’s that the Crystal flashes each time you tap the screen, but cycles its tap colour through the four elemental colours of Crystals in other Final Fantasy games, and the red and yellow look like a warning that you fucked up, instead!\n\nEnough weird, throwaway shit, let’s begin regular play with one of the other three game modes. FFI begins with its Field Music track. Field Music Stages (FMS) represent all the damned walking you do in Final Fantasy: it starts with your lead character walking from right to left, each environment specifically tailored to the song. The objective is to walk as far as possible by landing the notes with precise timing, which causes you to speed up. This is our first mode where you can lose, though I’m at a loss to determine what you’re losing represents. What, do you get lost? Run out of supplies? There are no enemies! We’ll discuss the particulars of the “HP” bar later on, but the short version is that whenever you screw up in the rhythm sequences, you lose HP, and when you run out, you lose.\n\nTheatrhythm unites its three main modes with similar mechanics, and this is most evident with the beats you have to land to play along with the song. The meat-and-potatoes gameplay unit is the red circle, which indicates that you should tap the screen. It doesn’t matter where you tap the screen, for this or any of the other mechanics: Theatrhythm is a Rhythm game that only cares about your… well, your rhythm!\n\nThe second kind of “note” is the yellow arrow icon. This is the toughest of the bunch. To clear an arrow, you have to “swipe” on the screen in the direction indicated, typically restricted to the eight, cardinal directions. How one actually performs a swipe is unclear, which I say even after clearing two full Theatrhythm campaigns! All the game tells you is that you have to move the stylus in the given direction, and you must not lift it. Okay, fine. But how far do you have to move it? Obviously until the note vanishes, but that’s kind of hard to track in the moment, and a visual guideline during the tutorial would have been helpful for practice. And you do have to lift your stylus after the game registers your note, so that you can start the next note, which means that second guideline is just confusing!\n\nThe third icon is green and indicates that you’re meant to hold the stylus down for a period, and then lift it when the green line that follows the note comes to an end. Extremely simple in the other modes, but be careful, because this mechanic is different in Field songs (as I’ll discuss in a moment). Just to make things worse, some of these green “hold” notes end with a swipe arrow, which means you don’t lift your stylus at the end, and have to swipe with your stylus down, instead, just to fuck with your muscle memory!\n\nLike any Rhythm game, this is all about score. Even your Rhythmia comes mostly down to score! Points are measured in extremely high numbers for multiple reasons: to reward your timing down to the frame, to help your points vary even more depending on your chain (i.e. the number of notes you get in a row), and lastly, to give you that hyper-inflated, pinball machine rush of getting an easy score in the billions. In fact, the points are so high that they could easily be rewarding random numbers and I’d never be able to prove it! You also get a rating for each note, which ranges from Bad, which breaks your current chain, to Critical, which has added benefits depending on the mode. There are several other results in between Bad and Critical, but they have no special effects, they just reward points and build your chain by a single unit.\n\nWith the basics out of the way, let’s discuss Field Mode Song (FMS) mode specifics. In Field songs, notes slide in your direction from left to right, as though you were walking towards them. You hit them when they reach a playhead on the right side of the screen, near your character. An empty circle sits in the playhead to show you the exact, horizontal position you want for a Critical, while a darker rectangle around it illustrates the safe zone for lower scores: so long as the note is touching even a pixel of the shading, you get at least a Good. If the note isn’t in that area, but is at least still on-screen, you get a Miss. Bad is vaguely in between.\n\nThe primary mechanical difference between FMS and the other modes is how it handles the green, “hold” icons. Unlike other modes where you can hold anywhere on the screen that you want, during FMS, you have to take the stylus on a little journey (get it? overworld travel?) by dragging it up and down as the hold icon’s “tail” waves about in a sine wave. This green wave can also end above or below the middle line (three specific, fixed position). All future notes will follow at that height, at least until the next hold note. It’s not a huge challenge, but it keeps things interesting.\n\nThis is probably a good opportunity to talk about party members. Party members in Theatrhythm have a full set of RPG stats, helpfully indicated with both numbers and “at a glance” rank icons, rating F through SSS. These stats will factor into gameplay in a variety of unusual ways. Grafting RPG stats and abilities to an established, reflex genre will always have unusual effects. Obviously character stats can’t help you tap the screen faster, so most of the time, Theatrhythm’s stats only helps your defence. For starters, HP helps you play for longer, characters’ Defence stats can reduce incoming damage, stuff like that. The few exceptions are there to get you prizes! As you get better at the game, you’ll need your stats less and less often, and expert players won’t need them at all. All considered, this probably is the only unobtrusive way to graft traditional RPG stats to a reflex genre like this, but it does feel a little meaningless under the microscope!\n\nStats also help in unusual ways depending on the game mode. In FMS, only one character walks at a time, starting with your leader, aka the character in the front slot, but if you Miss, your character will trip and be swapped out for the next character in line, cycling back to the leader only after you reach the end of the party. Only the active character’s stats matter (except in terms of your combined HP). This being a Rhythm game, you don’t aim to Miss to begin with, so you’re probably going to want to invest heavily in your leader! I should also mention character skills. Each character also gets four skill slots that can hold active skills, passive skills, or both depending on the character and the slot. Skills are learned as they level up, and generally apply exclusively to FMS or the upcoming BMS mode. Thankfully, FMS skills seem to be used no matter where the character is in the party, so they don’t have to be on the leader.\n\nAgain, the objective in FMS is to walk as far as possible before the music stops. Each note you land in FMS causes your character to speed up, with a higher speed boost for Critical compared to Good, Good compared to Bad, and Miss outright killing your momentum as you stumble and get replaced by the next character in line. Your Agility stat determines how fast you walk overall. The further you walk, the more silent, random RNG rolls you’ll earn to run into a Moogle, who will reward you with an item. While the game is still about getting high scores, Moogles are the only tangible prize you’ll get from FMS. Some of the Moogles’ prizes are equippable, and are used up under certain conditions, like a Potion triggering at low HP. Others are meagre collectibles, like trading cards that do nothing in this first game (there are even passwords to get a copy of every single card, one at a time, for free, because it just doesn’t matter!). You can also get an item at the end of the song, usually from a character native to the game world you’re visiting via this song, but that’s a freebie for surviving: your performance only affects these random Moogles.\n\nOne other thing to discuss is that every song features a section called “Feature Mode,” where all the notes turn entirely silver (making it harder to tell them apart, a bad call). If you land enough of the notes during Feature Mode, you’ll gain a special power for next stretch of notes, which will be golden to make them look even more important. In FMS, the bonus is that your character starts riding a Chocobo during the gold notes, and they remain on bird-back even if they take a hit, without even changing character, although you still lose HP. The type of Chocobo that spawns is random, with Yellow as the slowest and I believe the White Chocobo as the fastest (the game never says which is faster, so the only reason I think the White is fastest is because it’s also the rarest, so rare that I never saw one until the sequel!).\n\nAfter a song is done, you’ll be rewarded with Rhythmia (RM), mostly for your chain and the number of skills you managed to trigger, though you can also get some more esoteric bonuses like one for bringing a character from the game the song was from, for playing the algorithmically-selected “Daily Tune,” or for for playing the game multiple days in a row (this game was also released on smartphones, after all! Social game skinner boxes, ho!). There’s even a puny, 10 RM bonus for assembling a party of only men or only women. I feel like I’m trying to 100% Smash Bros Melee‘s “bonuses” for the Diskun trophy all over again, what a weird decision!\n\nBattle Mode Songs (BMS) are easily the hardest of the three modes for me, though I’m of mixed minds as to why I feel that way. The mechanics? Or is it because they tend to be faster tunes? In BMS, all four of your party members line on the right side of the screen like in the 2D Final Fantasy games, and the music notes come at them from the left on four separate tracks, one for each character. But don’t forget the game’s core rule: it doesn’t matter where you tap, just when! Don’t let the multiple tracks confuse you, because they’ll try!\n\nWhile you’re up top, desperately trying to keep the party alive by fending off the evil musical notes, your party members are fighting monsters! The separate tracks for notes may not factor into the rhythm game, but they do factor into this automated combat. Each time you hit a note, the character associated with that track will strike a blow at the monster on the left, using their Strength rating, and each time you miss, the monster hits that character at their Defence rating. The exact relationship between the types of notes and the damage of the attacks is fuzzy, but swipe notes seem to be more powerful than tap notes. Most character skills are dedicated to BMS, including all magic skills. Many of these skills are… let’s say, “proactive,” requiring you to reach a certain chain or simply hit a number of beats with that character, after which they’ll lob some extra damage at the current target.\n\nWhat’s the point of all this fighting? (…asked Shelke.) Well, if you defeat enemies and win a Luck-stat-related RNG roll, you’ll get an item, and if you manage to defeat enough enemies, eventually you’ll come to a boss, and killing them will get you a better item guaranteed! It’s like the Moogles in FMS again: you’re here for score and for prizes. The enemies themselves are infinite and you can even fight multiple bosses in the length of a single song. Once you make it to the end of the song, you just walk away from the final battle without any additional prizes (in contrast to FMS and its free, finishing prize).\n\nOne thing that’s worth noting in BMS combats is that only a little effort went into matching monsters and tracks to the games they actually came from. Bosses are almost always from the game you’re supposedly playing, but when minor enemies spawn in, all bets are off. Probably the most obvious example are when you see the region-specific, futuristic Esthar Soldiers from FFVIII, or the whatever-they’re-called soldiers from FFXIII, defending medieval villains!\n\nThe Feature Mode for BMS interrupts the current combat to perform a Summon! Shiva, Ifrit, Ramuh, Odin and Bahamut are each randomly available, and no, no I haven’t seen Bahamut, so he’s pretty rare, though I have got two copies of the item that would force him to appear! The Summon only seems to deal damage in a single blow at the end of the gold icons, a cumulative hit based on the number of gold icons you manage to snag (I know for a fact that you also deal regular damage for each gold note you hit in the sequel, even though they’re not animated. I’ve killed the occasional enemy with them in the sequel, but I’m not sure if that’s true of the original). If you don’t manage to call a Summon, the battle continues as normal, and you actually end up in a unique set of notes that you otherwise won’t see.\n\nI haven’t mentioned this yet, but the game breaks up each song into segments and stores your best critical hit percentage for each segment. It politely keeps track of both the Summon and non-Summon version of the BMS, requiring you to screw up and see the non-Summon version, and max the critical record!\n\nThat wraps up BMS, or at least for now since we’ll be coming back to it later on. That just leaves us with Event Mode, which typically plays a famous, but usually slow, theme from the game’s soundtrack. Your character choices and skills don’t seem to matter during EMS, except for providing HP (and possibly Defence?), and the characters themselves aren’t even on screen. Instead, a montage video of the game’s major events will play in the background, usually gameplay footage from FFI-VI, and cinematics for the games from FFVII onwards. The montages weren’t localized, and you can sometimes see Japanese text on screen – the text was probably “baked in” to the rendered CG, which wouldn’t have left the loc team with many options, especially not on such a low-budget project. These cinematics seem to have single-handedly bumped this cartoon puppet game up to an E10+ in ESRB regions, and a PEGI 12 in PAL. I mean, how many “Suggestive Themes” do you think these chibis were giving us without them? New scenes added to Curtain Call would push those ratings even further, with T in ESRB and a B in CERO!\n\nRather than send notes at the player from left to right on the bottom screen, EMS dances in all directions around the top screen. We follow a cursor that moves along a line that twists around as it pleases, eventually running into the familiar red, yellow and green notes. While this is probably the weirdest of the three modes as a result, gameplay is mostly the same even though the notes are doing their doodle ballet. Don’t let any lingering, Elite Beat Agents urges take over, since there’s no need to draw along the green “hold” notes or anything like that, just hold your stylus down and lift it when appropriate, same as ever! In fact, the tutorial hints at this by using the exact same sequence of notes for the tutorials for FMS, BMS, and EMS! Just watch out for the swipe icons: in previous game modes, they could only point in the eight cardinal directions, but in EMS they can be rotated at any possible angle, and you have to follow them!\n\nThe Feature Mode in EMS is easily the least forgiving. It always appears at the end: if you complete the silver notes successfully, you move on to the gold notes as usual, but if you fuck it up, you’re kicked out of the song entirely! That’s the bonus: you get to keep playing to the proper end of the song! Losing the Feature Zone still counts as clearing the song, but your score is almost guaranteed to nosedive.\n\nThe fifth song in Series Mode is the game’s “ending” theme, most often its credits theme. This is played in the Bonus Game, same as the opening theme.\n\nNow, like any Rhythm game, you know the real songs are going to be available in an easily-accessible menu somewhere. Unfortunately, you have to clear them in Series Mode to unlock them in the menu! What a pain. At least you get Rhythmia bonuses for playing in Series Mode, and if you manage to do all three main songs (FMS, BMS, and EMS) with a perfect chain, you’ll also get a massive EXP boost for your characters. Even pulled it off myself, once!\n\nNext week: song selection, alternate modes, and other weirdness."
