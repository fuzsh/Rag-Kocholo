        "text": "Just announced via Twitter:\n\nimage text said:\n\nFinal Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster launches in February 2022.\n\nIn order to bring you the best expeirence possible, we're allowing the necessary time to apply final polish while finishing development on the game.\n\nWe will be adding new items for those that pre-purchase the game individually, or have purchased the Pixel Remaster bundle on Steam.\n\nWe're looking forward to sharing the final title in our Pixel Remaster series with you all early next year and we hope you're looking forward to it.\n\nPer Steam, the extra items they're referring to are additional music tracks and wallpapers:\n\nFINAL FANTASY VI - FINAL FANTASY VI’s release date and pre-order bonuses - Steam News\n\nFF6 is planned to be released on February 2022\n\nSteam said:\n\nPre-purchase items for FF6 have been added as follows. These will be available at the time of title launch if you pre-purchase FF6 or have purchased the FF1-6 bundle.\n\n*The bundle is available now. Please wait for a while before you can pre-purchase \"FF6\".\n\nFINAL FANTASY VI Pre-Purchase items (Scheduled to be released on February 2022)\n\nSpecial Soundtracks\n\n・Locke's Theme (Timelapse Remix) [NOW ADDED TO PRE-PURCHASE ITEMS]\n\n・The Decisive Battle (Timelapse Remix)\n\n・Terra's Theme (Timelapse Remix)\n\n・Searching for Friends (Timelapse Remix)\n\n・Aria di Mezzo Carattere (Instrumental) [NOW ADDED TO PRE-PURCHASE ITEMS]\n\nSpecial Wallpapers\n\n・FF6: 2 types of wallpapers\n\n・FF1-6: 2 types of pixel remastered series wallpapers [NOW ADDED TO PRE-PURCHASE ITEMS]\n\n\"Timelapse Remix\" is a special soundtrack data that starts off with the original soundtrack version, but lets you also enjoy the reworked alternative soundtrack version as the soundtrack gradually transitions to the reworked alternative soundtrack version.\n\nEach wallpaper is available with 5 different sizes: 3840 x 2160, 2560 x 1600, 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 1024, 1024 x 768\n\nWe appreciate your continued support on both FINAL FANTASY VI and pixel remastered series.\n\nSteam has them listed:\n\nFINAL FANTASY VI Pre-Purchase items (Scheduled to be released on February 2022)\n\nSpecial Soundtracks\n\n・Locke's Theme (Timelapse Remix) [NOW ADDED TO PRE-PURCHASE ITEMS]\n\n・The Decisive Battle (Timelapse Remix)\n\n・Terra's Theme (Timelapse Remix)\n\n・Searching for Friends (Timelapse Remix)\n\n・Aria di Mezzo Carattere (Instrumental) [NOW ADDED TO PRE-PURCHASE ITEMS]\n\nSpecial Wallpapers\n\n・FF6: 2 types of wallpapers\n\n・FF1-6: 2 types of pixel remastered series wallpapers [NOW ADDED TO PRE-PURCHASE ITEMS]\n\n\"Timelapse Remix\" is a special soundtrack data that starts off with the original soundtrack version, but lets you also enjoy the reworked alternative soundtrack version as the soundtrack gradually transitions to the reworked alternative soundtrack version.\n\nEach wallpaper is available with 5 different sizes: 3840 x 2160, 2560 x 1600, 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 1024, 1024 x 768\n\nWe appreciate your continued support on both FINAL FANTASY VI and pixel remastered series.\n\nInstrumental version of the opera song and Timelapse Locke theme. 2 wallpapers that represent the full PR series rather than the ones for each game individually.\n\nFor those surprised by the delay-- it was obvious for about a month now that December wasn't happening, and that February was the most likely date. SteamDB lets you see the updates to the Steam repo, and the pace of daily updates only started a little over a week ago. We'll probably see a few more weeks of that pace, and then a few weeks of the final multiple-daily-updates blitz. FFV was super buggy at launch which led to it reviewing as the worst in the series in Steam reviews. Fixed now, but they should have waited.\n\nBut I've heard so many great things about VI, so I'm really looking forward to playing it for the first time via this remaster.\n\nSame. I have the GBA version, but think I'm gonna wait for this. Played through FF1PR a few months ago and absolutely loved its presentation, and this seems like it'll have even more effort put into it, so it should be great.\n\nLooks like they're going all out for FF6, as they should. This means FF6 should have the most changes and unique features.\n\nI don't think they're particularly going more all out on this than on the other games. FF6 is simply a bigger game, with more content and more complex systems than the others.\n\nSame. I have the GBA version, but think I'm gonna wait for this. Played through FF1PR a few months ago and absolutely loved its presentation, and this seems like it'll have even more effort put into it, so it should be great.\n\nI have the GBA version too and it's always just been sitting there in my backlog of shame. But yeah, FF1PR was fantastic! I bought it not sure if I was going to enjoy playing these old games, but I fell in love with it and then bought the rest of the PRs lol\n\nHow have the pixel ramasters been so far anyhow? Haven't actually went through that much of VI, so considering going through it with this.\n\nI think the PR of III and V are basically the best editions out there now. I would probably prefer to play IV this way as well.\n\nThe Steam versions had noticeable stuttering which modders managed to fix up. And the new soundtracks have been almost universally well-received."
