Here we present a special round-table discussion with the staff who contributed to its development as we delve into Chrono Trigger to find its appeal.\n\nExcitement over the story and new battle system!\n\nOur hero Crono's adventure begins when he goes to save a girl who was sucked into a time warp created by a teleportation device.\n\nSuch is the very simple start of Square's newest game, Chrono Trigger. But that simplicity is actually not to be trustedâthe details of this story, that gradually reveals itself as you travel through time to each different era, far surpass the story's creation. It is truly a first-rate piece of entertainment.\n\nLet us explain the two points that bring out the fun of Chrono Trigger.\n\nFirst is the mystery of a time travel story in which adventuring through various eras influences later eras, and the situations change again and again. The statue of the hero worshiped in the fiend village changes in response to battles fought in the past! And the stingy, greedy village elder... and the desert... and the adventurer... nngh, I want to write them. But I won't. I want you to see it all for yourself as you fully enjoy playing the game. The bartering system in the prehistoric era is fun (you trade items), and the most minor bits of dialogue really hit home. Anyway, I recommend going back to later eras every time you do something. It's really very good how the eras are altered and the story changes.\n\nThe second point is the lively battle scenes that make the game seem like an action RPG. It's a turn-based RPG, but the field doesn't change, and the monsters move around the battle scenes. The characters' actions are very distinct as well. Frankly, you could say that the charm of Akira Toriyama's characters shines more and more, precisely because of this battle system. The appeal that the designer put into the characters is drawn out 100%, and in that sense, you might say that this is a true character game. I really want you to experience this thrilling adventure RPG.\n\nCaptions:\n\nThe trial scene, with its elaborate graphics.\n\nThis line makes my heart skip a beat. Wow. (Line: The person I hate most? My dad, of course.)\n\nWho lives in the house in the desert?\n\nThe Great Adventurer Toma rests here. (Line: Crono, long time no see.)\n\nYou really feel presence in the battle scenes. They're turn-based, but suddenly you're at the edge of your seat!\n\n212\n\nDevelopment Team Special Talk\n\nThe battles are Chrono Trigger's greatest secret.\n\nFirst, I'd like to ask about the biggest special feature: the battles.\n\nHiguchi: Before, like in Final Fantasy for example, when you're walking around and you run into monsters, the screen would go fuzzy and it would cut to a battle scene, but that doesn't happen in Chrono Trigger.\n\nSo is it like Secret of Mana?\n\nHiguchi: No, Secret of Mana is a real-time battle RPG type, where you control the characters and slice things up.... This is a turn-based RPG. This is the first time we've done anything like that.\n\nKamata: In appearance, it does look like Secret of Mana, but as for what you're doing, it's closer to Final Fantasy.\n\nWas that really hard?\n\nHiguchi: It was hard. We had to meet a lot of conditions, which is why we hadn't ever done it before.\n\nYou had been cutting to a new scene.\n\nHiguchi: Yes. This all started when we decided to take on those conditions from the beginning.\n\nBecause that way is more natural than cutting to a new scene?\n\nHiguchi: That's right. And also, the battle backgrounds, like the town or the castle ruins, can stay the way they are on the field.\n\nSo you're saying that before you had just one image to express the battle backgrounds before, but now you can just show them as they are?\n\nKamata: That's right; so the world's presence and things like that are completely different, and it can draw the players in because it's like they're really moving, fighting, and living inside that world. And on top of that, it's not an action battle, so people who aren't so good with action can still play.\n\nWhen you do that, what kind of areas give you problems? For example, the monster graphics show up on the field, so you can't have monsters that are too big, maybe?\n\nKato: No, we do have big monsters. In the boss battles. They take up about half the screen.\n\nSo then do you make them move very forcefully?\n\nHiguchi: They're not very forceful (laugh). Like one part of it will be kind of vague. It was really hard seeing how far we could stretch the limits of V-RAM capacity and processing speed. Like, there wasn't enough V-RAM, so we could only show so much, or we couldn't draw something this huge or make it move.\n\nMay I ask for more specifics?\n\nHiguchi: We would get something from the field programmers, and the battle took place on it just as it was, but it was incredibly difficult to deliver it well so that the battle takes over smoothly and in a way that isn't obvious, and do it all in a way that wouldn't destroy the field programming and graphics. At first we couldn't really pull it off, and we'd destroy the monsters. Until now, in Final Fantasy type battles, there would be about a second of darkness, and a lot of things happened in that one second, and we were able to turn it into a battle scene. But this time, we couldn't do anything like that at all. We couldn't turn it black; we had to change it in a snap. That was extremely hard.\n\nSo it was an experiment that had never been tried before. As a programmer, how do you feel now that you've completed it?\n\nHiguchi: I've worked on Final Fantasy up until now, and it was really more of a behind-the-scenes job, and what I did didn't show up on the surface very much. For example, my calculations would be processed where no one could see them...\n\nCaptions:\n\nThe sound of the bats sucking blood is a nice touch.\n\nFive elite chosen to represent the Chrono development team of over 30 members.\n\nCreator's Profile:\n\nKatsuhisa Higuchi\n\nProgrammer. A veteran programmer who has worked on the Final Fantasy series for years. One of the people who toiled from beginning to end on the battle programming for Chrono Trigger. We hear that he became a father while working on Chrono Trigger.\n\nAkihiko Matsui\n\nPlanning. After working on Final Fantasy and then completing Romancing Saga 2, he moved to the Chrono Trigger team in the middle of its development. He was in charge of moving the monsters in battle.\n\n213\n\nHiguchi: ...and the only thing that actually showed up on screen were the numbers. Then this time, I did things like dimensions for the first time, and of course I struggled at first. Then somehow the schedule got tight, and I realized I had a mountain of work to do, and that's when I really hated it (laugh). But after getting through that and finding a kind of an end in sight, for the first time, I thought, âWow, look at the great game I made.â But at first, it was nothing but hard, and there were a lot of times I wanted to give up (laugh).\n\nBut you started out thinking, âI think it'll work if I do this,â right?\n\nHiguchi: Hmm, of course I did think that to an extent, but you don't know that it will work out the way you expect. It's that gap that's really hard. Actually, we were hoping to make something where the monsters moved better, and you could move around a lot doing the smallest actions, so it would move the same way as an action game, but the Super Nintendo had its limitsâthe processing speed was slow, there's only so much V-RAM, and we took a lot of time dealing with things like that.\n\nYou just mentioned the monsters. It seems like there aren't so many of them?\n\nMatsui: Numberwise, they probably aren't that many.\n\nKamata: But the pattern numbers...\n\nI see. Each character has a lot of different patterns.\n\nMatsui: That's right. Because they need a pattern to do anything. You can pretty much just reverse right and left, but they move looking toward and away from the screen, so compared to Final Fantasy, where you only see them from the side, they have to have a lot more patterns.\n\nSo you're saying there are fewer monsters, but it takes the same amount of data because of all the patterns they have.\n\nKamata: No, this way uses up a lot more data.\n\nMatsui: The amount of data we attached to everything went up quite a bit.\n\nThe side-view characters we've seen traditionally don't have so much data?\n\nHiguchi: Because you only see them from one side. And in Chrono Trigger, you get more than just one side. They move around, and they have their attack patterns, so their graphic data is overwhelmingly greater.\n\nKato: The enemies in a normal RPG are just the one still picture. And if a really cool picture shows up, then it moves just a little bit in the battle. In this game, it's not like that. The enemies really exist, and they move around like the characters, and it takes an enormous amount of data to animate them. That's just how alive the enemies are.\n\nIdeas are born from planning meetings with everyone participating\n\nThe basic premise is that it's about time travel. Where did that idea come from?\n\nKamata: At a general meeting. We wanted to start with something completely new, and we had a general meeting to solicit ideas of what kind of thing we wanted to do, and I guess someone suggested it there. They said, âI want to do something like a time patrol.â Then everybody thought that sounded interesting, so we threw ideas around, trying to think of scenarios that handled time.\n\nIt seems like it would be really hard to check for bugs on something like this. That goes for programming, too, but do you have to also check the story?\n\nKamata: What was hard about it was that we knew there were bugs, but when we fixed them, unexpected results would show up in other places. When you're working with something where the story only keeps going to the end, you only need to check what happens after that point, but here, there are places where it uses the thing you fixed and something happens before that point.\n\nRight, if you open the treasure chest with the crest on it in the past, then it's not there in the future. I thought it was done very well.\n\nKato: On the other hand, if you open it in the future, and then go to the past, it's still there.\n\nAh!\n\nKato: When you think about the flow of time, you can do things like that. If you go get it in the future first, then if you go to the past, you can get it again.\n\nI see, so that's how it is.\n\nKato: I think that once you see the entire flow of the story and understand it like that, you can think, âThe way time flows, it should be like this,â and make all kinds of sweet discoveries.\n\nBut for the people making it, that would be incredibly hard.\n\nKato: Indeed. But the fun comes first when we're making it.\n\nSo did everybody get really excited at that planning meeting?\n\nKato: Actually, I came to Square from outside...\n\nCaptions:\n\nAll these monsters appear and move around in one battle.\n\nCreator's Profile:\n\nMasato Kato\n\nPlanning. After leaving another software company, Chrono Trigger was his first work with Square. He was in charge of story and events. He says that he had never experienced such intense planning meetings before, and they really left an impression on him.\n\nYasuhiko Kamata\n\nGraphics. After working on Secret of Mana, he moved to the Chrono Trigger team. Mainly in charge of background graphics. He wracked his brain pulling the team along while managing group work--delegating jobs to the graphic team and creating entire images.\n\nYasunori Mitsuda\n\nMusic. After his training years (in his own words) of doing sound effects for Secret of Mana and sound engineering for Romancing Saga 2, he was finally able to attain is long-held dream of composing and was responsible for nearly all the music in Chrono Trigger. He used the full extent of his talent by composing up to 80 pieces.\n\n214\n\nKato: ...so this was my first game with Square. And a lot of people started from scratch to make it. So we were making the stories and this giant group of like 30 got together and clamored about at every meeting. It was pretty rough. My stomach would start hurting at the time (laugh).\n\nWas it the first time you'd experienced anything like that?\n\nKato: Yes. Until then, I'd worked in small groups, where we'd just go ahead and make something, and it was like, âOkay, I'm going to do it like this.â Everyone working together is a pro in and of itself, but we'd have to change direction because of opinions that came up when we had meetings. But when meetings were taken up mostly with, âWhat the heck is this guy talking about?â kind of opinions (laugh), I would almost snap. There were times I just barely managed to get through by holding myself back. Well, I think everyone in every division is the same way. Because at the general meetings, we'd also argue about the graphics. But there were some really painful things involving the scenarios.\n\nHiguchi: At first, your division has nothing to do with it, after all.\n\nKato: It's incredible. Everyone just says whatever they want without even thinking. That part was really hard to deal with, but once the basic parts are set, then everyone is left to their own devices to an extent, so it's like a battle of the game sense and abilities of the people working together on the various game events. It's very high-energy, and creates something with a lot of suspense, and that part of it is especially funâit makes me happy. It's like we were fumbling around in the dark, trying to find the possibilities of this media, what we can do only in video games, but not make a normal, straightforward epic.\n\nWringing out every drop of ability in the limited time allotted.\n\nMr. Mitsuda, you were in charge of music. I understand this was your first game?\n\nMitsuda: Until now, I did sound effects for Secret of Mana and engineering for Romancing Saga 2. They never let me do music before. That was my training period (laugh).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on your first game?\n\nMitsuda: Boy, it was tough. It was in development for two years, but I worked on Romancing Saga 2 in the middle of it, so I did it in the one year that was left. In the beginning, the music was ahead of everything. But towards the end, everyone had passed me by, and finally, the music was finished last (laugh).\n\nMatsui: There are times when we're doing it and we realize there really isn't enough music. And we start talking like, âI really do want a musical theme here,â and we make a ton of requests at once. When we're working on something as a big group, we can immediately divide it all up, but with music, it all focuses on one person.\n\nMitsuda: The number one goal this time was to make something that you could listen to over and over without getting sick of it, so each piece is really long. Normally, the music loops after a minute, but all of my pieces are more than two minutes. So no one gets tired of them, but it's tough writing two minutes of music. Well, it takes twice as long as usual. Then in the end, the number of pieces needed jumped dramatically, and I got so busy I couldn't do anything. Anyway, there is a sense that I accomplished as much as I possibly could at this point.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the impressions I got playing, this game had a slightly different feel from the Final Fantasy and Romancing Saga games that I've played. I thought it was interesting.\n\nKamata: Looking at the consumers' reactions, I think they're loving it like crazy.\n\nMitsuda: Yeah. The reactions weren't bad. But around December 20 of last year, when I needed so much more music all at once, I was at a total loss (laugh). I wrote the last battle, and then a long one, about four minutes, for the end credits, and I thought I was done, then they'd say, âHaven't you written the sub-boss music yet?â (laugh). I stayed at my office for four days without sleep to write the music for the last sub-boss, but I really wanted to run away. Well, I used up every ounce of my abilities, so anything I have left to do will have to wait until next time.\n\nAre there plans for a sequel?\n\nMitsuda: Hmm, I wonder (laugh). But I really don't know. I don't want to do it (laugh).\n\nThe music really is done by only a small number, huh?\n\nMitsuda: That's right. At our company, it's almost all done by one person.\n\nAbout how many people work on the graphics?\n\nKamata: This time, we ultimately got help from some of the first development division, but when it's just our fourth division, it's about fifteen people. Including the first division, it's about twenty.\n\nThe first division? You mean, once they were done with Final Fantasy.\n\nKamata: Yes, they happened to have some free time. In autumn, we got eight more bits, but there was no way we could handle them. Game graphics aren't done once the picture's drawn. You draw the picture, and then you have to turn it into data and then process it into the map. That processing eats up all the time. Drawing the pictures takes a relatively short amount of time, but all the time after that is taken up with making that data afterward, and we weren't able to get to those extra bits we were given.\n\nIt seems like this game really emphasized the feel of light. Were there any specific goals you had for this project?\n\nKamata: Good question. Basically, we did have the fact that it was Mr. Akira Toriyama, but personally, I think the expressions of Ridley Scott, the director of Alien, with the rays of light and the smoke coming up are very beautiful, and I wanted to make that the main feel of the game.\n\nCaptions:\n\nThe sub-boss that caused the composer four days of all-nighters.\n\nThe light gives the screen a feeling of solemnity.\n\nOne of the highlights is this statue of Magus that changes based on battles fought in the past.\n\n215\n\nI think the music has a lot to do with this, too, but it has a dank feeling. Is that what we might call the overall tone?\n\nKamata: To be honest, the first thing I thought was, âWe need to make this something that's not Final Fantasy or Mana.â I wanted to make it something that wasn't either of those but still very much a Square game. So first I thought about the in between. It is dank, but it's not as dark as Final Fantasy.\n\nAnd it's not as bright as Mana?\n\nKamata: Right. I think that Mana has white mixed in, like it's a pastel.\n\nIndividuality, cooperation, and curiosity. These are indispensable traits for a game developer.\n\nFinally, this is technically supposed to be a personnel recruitment article, so please give a message to those aiming to work for Square.\n\nHiguchi: If you're not motivated, don't bother (laugh).\n\nMatsui: I'd like some interesting people to come work here. You don't have to be almighty, but if you have just one talent, even if it's really pointless, then be really well-versed in it.\n\nWhat about you, Mr. Kato? Since you've only made one game since you started here.\n\nKato: You must be able to talk about normal things in a logical way (laugh). That's a major prerequisite. Of course, you need to have your own vision and game concepts, and have a clear idea of how you personally would want to make games, but before you get there, the very minimum requirement is to be able to talk normally and make games with other people (laugh).\n\nWhat about the graphics representative?\n\nKamata: I think being able to draw is a good prerequisite, and you should like playing with computers. I think the graphics are rapidly going to move to CG, and in the next generation of consoles, they'll be completely CG. We need someone who would be like, âI wanna try this! I wanna try that!â\n\nAnd what about the underpopulated music division?\n\nMitsuda: First, we need someone who can go along with new ideas. All of our musicians are idiots who aren't afraid to play along with crazy ideas (laugh). And it would probably be good to be interested in all kinds of things. I don't think they'll let anyone in who doesn't listen to lots of different music and think, âOh, this is nice,â or, âI'd like to try that.â But it takes more time than regular music, so I think the workload would be really tough. You'd really have to be somebody who can stay awake for four days (laugh); I think it would be good to get somebody who can get by on little sleep.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nCaptions:\n\nThe team dissolves when the game is complete. When their break is over, they each have different games waiting for them.\n\nThe colorful events are one of the strong points of working as a team.\n\nThe Perfect: Talk Battle[edit]\n\nChrono Trigger: The Perfect \"Talk Battle\" developer interview with Yuji Horii and Hironobu Sakaguchi, translated by GlitterBerri. Thanks to CuteLucca for the source scans!\n\nSource\n\nV Jump Books Dokusen Project!!\n\nTwo members of the Chrono Trigger team discuss the secret story behind the game!\n\nItâs a scorching hot TALK BATTLE!!\n\nY. Horii VS H. Sakaguchi\n\nDREAM PROJECT\n\nEvent ideas, character design, the real story is just inside! See the dynamic relationship between the developers revealed as we present this information to you!\n\nThey are, of course, Yuuji Horii and Hironobu Sakaguchi, masters of the Chrono Trigger world!! We conducted this special interview for our readers!\n\nLet the interview begin!!\n\nThe game and its graphics were beyond belief.\n\nâLetâs start the interview off with something basic. After completing the game and playing the final version, what were your thoughts? Do you think you were able to accomplish what you set out to do?\n\nHorii:\n\nIn my mind, the game went beyond our expectations. There were highlights that, in the end, were more than I thought theyâd be. The scene where youâre going into the jail â just the feeling I got from entering the dungeon surprised me. Seeing the scrolling background of the passage left a deep impression on me. Not just the mountains in the background; the inside as well.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nOur colleagues who worked on the graphics were also talking about that. If the prison had been done in the normal style, it would have been rather devoid of colour.\n\nâHorii, would you say that he dungeon had the best visuals, in your opinion?\n\nHorii:\n\nYes. The graphics were excellent, if thatâs what you mean. Iâm not a professional artist, so I appreciate someone else going in there for me.\n\nâSakaguchi, how about yourself? Do you find that there was a place that went far beyond what you had imagined?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nSomething like the stained glass of the courtroom. That part was amazing. At the beginning I imagined the courthouse to be suspended in the sky, connected by a floating bridge to the mountains. I wasnât thinking about the contrast with the light, that was created the efforts of the staff who drew it.\n\nHorii:\n\nAs for this game, Iâm only involved with the plot. If thereâs a fairground, I just write that thereâs a fairground; I donât write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in. With entertainment like a robot battle and Squareâs ride, there are many things with which to amuse yourself. I think it lent a certain freshness to the game to have everyone working together.\n\nIdeas were brainstormed under the orders of the director.\n\nâDo you think that working with each other, there were parts of the game that reflected your personalities?\n\nHorii:\n\nOff the top of my head, I think that the fairground events were very Sakaguchi-esque. Characters like Gonzalez, especially.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nI was the one who created Gonzales. (laughter)\n\nâIs that so? (laughter)\n\nHorii:\n\nSuddenly bursting into songâ¦\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nActually, I was also behind the primeval dance next door. (laughter)\n\nHorii:\n\nItâs a good thing that I started dancing to it too.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nActually, Kitase, who was directing the game, was the one who asked me to put something in there.\n\nâWas it because you would always say that to him when you were the director and now your positions have been reversed?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThatâs right. (laughter) Kitase only recently became director, so he was always saying âSakaguchi, Sakaguchi, Iâm really sorry about this, but since Iâm the director now, Iâm going to have to ask you to do this.â (bursts out laughing)\n\nSquare had a variety of new ideas â Horii\n\nChrono Trigger had a degree of freedom never-before-seen in games.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThere were times that I felt under pressure to make as much of a Toriyama-style world as possible, but contrary to my expectations I found that it was okay to play around with Toriyamaâs universe. It felt like anything was possible.\n\nHorii:\n\nBecause of this, even in really serious scenes thereâs a lot of silliness. Take the part where you defeat the Dragon Tank after escaping from the prison. The enemies hanging off the edge link together to form a human bride. (laughter)\n\nâEven with the character names, like âSir Krawlie.â (laughing)\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThat would be impossible with something like Final Fantasy. It would be rejected immediately. (laughter)\n\nHorii:\n\nWe had a lot more freedom than we would with Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest. We werenât worried about the feel of the world; it would be whatever we ended up making.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nIt was a totally new game.\n\nâSakaguchi-san, would you say there was a part where Horiiâs personality shone through?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nYes and no. When I read the faxes he sent me, I was surprised. They were written like flowcharts, and the response time showed an almost user-like mentality. I thought it was amazing.\n\nThey wanted to make the most of time travel.\n\nâI thought I had played till the end, but after the Undersea Palace the game suddenly awarded the player a lot more freedom. You culd go around doing all sorts of things. What was your intention there, seeing as the story was so much linear before?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nFFVI wast he same. The style had its pros and cons. We had several events that had to be completed using time travel, so we wanted to make the most of them. Also, when we came up with ideas for bosses that you had to defeat by hitting their weak points, we began to realize we couldnât put them into a linear story. Players would get stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. As a result, I wanted to make use of those ideas in areas that were optional for the player. The game is accordingly easier to understand than Final Fantasy, and in order to help the player progress through the game we made the Brink of Time (End of Time). We created it so the player could go there to receive hints and carry on.\n\nâI feel that there is one particular optional event that youâd like the player to experience most. There were a lot of events that caused time paradoxes or made use of time travel, werenât there?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThose were the most popular Chrono-like parts according to the testers as well. Though surely if you just skipped through the story at that pace from the beginning, you wouldnât be able to follow it, right?\n\nHorii:\n\nIsnât that right. It wouldnât make sense.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nBecause the Chrono Trigger world could be understood through a linear story, I thought players would enjoy events that caused time paradoxes and required traveling through time.\n\nEnjoy the differences between the 1st and 2nd playthrough! â Sakaguchi\n\nThe second playthrough will feel different.\n\nâChrono Trigger has the option for a second playthrough using your progress from the first game. Was this so players could enjoy the multiple endings?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThat was one of our intentions, but there was also something we didnât expectâ¦the testers themselves felt as though they wanted to travel through time again. They wated to start a new game, go to Leene Fair, and time travel once more. That was actually the good thing about time travel, I think. In normal RPGs, the second time through, it feels like a chore to play all the way from the beginning again. With the New Game + youâre able to keep your charactersâ strength, so your sense of battle is different. You feel like time traveling in Chrono Trigger once more.\n\nHorii:\n\nWith the options in Chrono Trigger, you often find yourself wondering about what would have happened had you chosen to do something different. The second time through gives you more chances to toy with what people say.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nWherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in peopleâs reactions, even down to the smallest details. If you feel the changes, I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest.\n\nHorii:\n\nFor example, even if youâre found guilty during the trial the first time through, you might be found innocent the second time. During the initial playthrough, you wonât be aware of the hole in the dungeon wall; youâll clear he game wondering what it is. But, later, if you try to clear the game 100%, youâll go outside and realize that you could have gone out there in the first place. (laughter)\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nEven just waiting I the dungeon for your punishment to be enforced, youâre able to expand the story.\n\nâYou can play through again with a different history. By changing history through your actions, you can change the ending, right?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nEveryone will probably play a second time to see the different endings. But multiple endings aside, I think that if you enjoy the differences between playthroughs, youâll find the second time interesting as well.\n\nYou can toy with the subtle changes in peopleâs reactions â Horii\n\nWeâre often asked if we like frogs.\n\nDâThe world of Chrono Trigger is so varied that it gives rise to a variety of characters that suit it. Chrono Trigger seems to boast characters that have, until now, never before been seen in games like Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy. Where did those original ideas come from?\n\nHorii:\n\nThe staff studied the drawings of Toriyama. They put a lot of effort in. We felt as though we couldnât let the drawings go to waste.\n\nâOne of the protagonists is a frog. Was that your idea, Horii?\n\nHorii:\n\nToriyama gave us the rough sketch of a frog character had had drawn.\n\nâSo what made you decide to use a character like that?\n\nHorii:\n\nFor some reason, we had been talking about how we wanted a non-human character.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nWeâre often asked that. Frogs have appeared before in the Final Fantasy series. People ask if itâs because Square likes frogs! (laughter) But thatâs not the reason at all. (laughter)\n\nHorii:\n\nWhen we were creating the characters, we were thinking about what sort of friends Crono would have in each era. The gameâs protagonist is a young boy, so how many females should we have? When Square was working on in the in-battle actions, they thought it would be boring to have only human characters. When trying to think up characters that werenât human or robot, they started considering the frog. (laughter)\n\nâEasy to understand that development. It has character.\n\nHorii:\n\nThere were pigs, too. And monkeys. But they arenât so different from humans.\n\nI want to better capture the feel of a Toriyama-style world. â Sakaguchi\n\nThe events that make you burst into tears are the best.\n\nâOut of all the events, which ones did you two like?\n\nHorii:\n\nItâs a normal part of the story, but thereâs a course of action where Marle disappears somehow, you see the resulting future, and you have to do something to prevent it. Thatâs the start of it all; the rest of the story just stems from it. I like that part.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nI really like the episode with Marle and her father. Thatâs because in this game, contrary to what youâd expect, there are some family issues. (laughter) I like events that, rather than making you cry like in Final Fantasy, make you burst into tears.\n\nNo matter what the developers do, the game tends to be difficult.\n\nâFor the first time in a while, Sakaguchi designed detailed monsters.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nWhen we were making Final Fantasy III, Aoki, the producer of Chrono Trigger, was the one in charge of the monsters. Heâs been poking his nose into it ever since. So, I designed some concepts for monsters, then I, Aoki, and two others crowded into a room and discussed things like needing a barrier to defeat certain types of magic. In this game there are many enemies you have to defeat by hitting their weak points. I think it shows that we like simulations.\n\nâSo that means that your personality shone through, Sakaguchi.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nAt first getting through the game was tough. The testers were saying âYou guys are being cruel. Whose idea was this?â It was mine! (laughter) Harsh, right?\n\nHorii:\n\nWe developers had managed to make the game too difficult!\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nItâs always like that the first time, no matter what.\n\nHorii:\n\nItâs because we know too much. The developers think the gameâs just right; that theyâre being too soft. Theyâre thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didnât figure out things we thought theyâd get asily.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThere were exceptions to where people got stuck, though.\n\nHorii:\n\nRight, the places where players got stuck differed from person to person.\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nYou get to the point where you just need to talk to the person, so why donât you talk to them? (laughter)\n\nWeâll get Toriyama to draw the world map! (laughter) â Horii\n\nThey wanted to release the game by the end of the year.\n\nâItâs hard to hear after everythingâs finished, but do you feel there are places where you would have liked to have done something differently?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nIf we had tried a little harder, we could have reached our goal of releasing the game by the end of the year. (bursts out laughing) It was a little heartbreaking to have to change the release date.\n\nâCan we hear about what youâd like to do if you made a sequel?\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThe sense of dancing you get from exploring Toriyamaâs worlds is a little more difficult to capture than I initially thought. If we can successfully channel that feeling, weâll be able to create a fantastic world. If we try to do a sequel, I want to perfect that completely.\n\nHorii:\n\nAnd weâll get Toriyama to draw the world map for us! (laughter)\n\nSakaguchi:\n\nThen it will really be a Toriyama-style world. (laughter)\n\nâWell, everything turned out great! (laughter) Thank you very much for joining us today.\n\nHironobu Sakaguchi Profile\n\nBorn in 1962 in Mito City, Ibaraki Prefecture.

Let's listen as these three spill the secrets behind the creation of Chrono Trigger!\n\nHironobu Sakaguchi:\n\nAround two years ago we traveled to America to do some research, checking out the latest in computer graphics.\n\nI ended up travelling together with Mr. Horii and Mr. Toriyama.\n\nDuring the trip we decided that we wanted to create something together, something that no one had done before.\n\nWe were really naive...\n\nYuuji Horii:\n\nWe got all fired up about it.\n\nNormally you'd think things would have ended there, that we wouldn't have been so excited...\n\n(laughing)\n\nHironobu Sakaguchi:\n\nThat's right, we were really enthusiastic about it.\n\nJust talking about it was really exciting.\n\nHowever, once we decided we were going to do it for sure, we spent a year or a year and a half thinking about all the difficulties we'd encounter.\n\nWe had almost given up when we received word from the producer, Mr. Aoki.\n\nHe said \"No, if you're going to talk like that, please ask me. I definitely want to help make it happen.\"\n\nWas it difficult, Mr. Aoki?\n\nKazuhiro Aoki:\n\nMy life was made considerably more difficult thanks to this project.\n\nHironobu Sakaguchi:\n\nWe were staying together too.\n\nKazuhiro Aoki:\n\nThat's right, one year ago, wasn't it?\n\nPacked like sardines...\n\nIt was hard.\n\nWe started thinking about what kind of game we should make...\n\nThis type, that type...\n\nFour whole days we spent...\n\nV-Jump Video 2[edit]\n\nInterview Dialogue[edit]\n\nTranscribed by GekkaHikko and translated by SheaNizbel.

Toriyama\n\nHello, this is Akira Toriyama.\n\nSo we have two games, namely Dragonquest and Final Fantasy, that appear to be comparatively similar to one another, and yet are polar opposites. In a sense, theyâve now become one in the same. Like itâs seriously as if we can choose the best of both worlds when it comes to Squareâs graphics. I was really surprised with how beautiful the graphics could get in just 3 hours time. Theyâre so beautiful that if I animated, say, some scenery a bit too much, then the game itself would become hard to look at, I think.\n\nBut being able to use shading in the game for more detail so that the graphics are easy on the eyes, for instance, was one of the things that surprised me the most.\n\nThis worked well for me, though. If I had them render my designs faithfully, or too faithfully, I thought that we could probably go even further with it if we had something better to display the graphics on (laughs).\n\nYuji Horii\n\nHello, Horii here. And Iâm in charge of writing the plot in Chrono Trigger.\n\nThe reason why I created the type of story I did, is because Chrono Trigger uses a 32 megabit ROM cartridge and that itâs possible to create a vast world with such technology.\n\nSo when I was thinking about how to utilize that technology in order to create the most enjoyable experience possible, I thought that being able to go on adventures in different eras of time would be a lot of fun. Like if you say, âI want to check out the prehistoric times!â, or âit would be cool to go to the middle ages!â, or âI want to go see what the futureâs going to be like!â, or âeven the present would be fun to look around in!â, you can do that! Itâs like you would be performing in your own historical plays for different time periods while solving mysteries and going on grand adventures. I thought that would be a lot of fun, so that was my mindset when I began working on the game.\n\nWhen I was working on the plot and had Square implement the scenarios I created for the game, this was my first time working in a group like this. Because of that, ROMS have been coming out one after another. And Iâve been thinking to myself about how good the artwork is. So with all thatâs been going on like with how the game was being produced with all these big scenes and everything, I felt as if I was working on something with artwork that actually movesâkind of like an anime. Thatâs what kind of game this is.\n\nBy the way, I think the game will probably be finished soon. I invite you all to give it a try.\n\nHironobu Sakaguchi\n\nHello, my name is Sakaguchi. Iâve been working with the man behind Dragonquest, Mr. Horii; and with the one who brought us all the wonderful artwork from Dragonball and Doctor Slump; and Iâm currently trying to put on the finishing touches to Chrono Trigger.\n\nActually, developers from Square, those who worked on the Final Fantasy games, Seiken Densetsu (Mana), Romancing SaGa, programmers, and many more amazing individuals have all come together to make a concerted effort in developing Chrono Trigger.\n\nAnd of course, we will all put our greatest efforts into creating an amazing RPG in which dreams are made of. So be ready for that! Thank you.\n\nMasanori Hoshino\n\nIâve been pixelating and bringing to life Mr.Toriyamaâs artwork for the game. What Iâm especially wanting players to see are things like the detail in the movements of the characters and how elaborate the movements in the battles are; and above all, players will get see 256 patterns per characterâthere are over 3000 patterns in the game!\n\nThanks to the 32-bit ROM technology, if players look closely, they will discover that there is a lot of movement in the graphics of the game.\n\nKeizou Kokubo\n\nWeâre going to be utilizing the technology and experience that brought you games such as Romance SaGa and Mana. To be clear, our goal isnât to simply combine all the elements of those games into a single game, but to craft an experience which surpasses that. As someone whoâs been working on the design of Chrono Trigger, Iâve been putting together some neat things for everyone to experience. Stay tuned!\n\nYoshinori Kitase\n\nI primarily directed the scenarios in Final Fantasy VI. Final Fantasy VI was set like an opera stage and want to go beyond that in Chrono Trigger. Players can expect to see locations not typically seen in RPGs, such as courtrooms and prisons. The gameâs ending is going to be great as well!\n\nTakashi Tokita\n\nIâm Chrono Triggerâs director.\n\nI want to put Mr. Toriyamaâs artwork and illustrations to good use for the game because theyâre so comical and full of life; players will be able to experience the game in such a vivid way thatâs reminiscent of one of Toriyamaâs mangas. In that way, theyâll be able to get a better sense of the serious parts of the game while being able to laugh during the more humorous parts.\n\nAlso, players will be able to choose from and play with any of the various characters that appear in each of the different eras in the game.\n\nKazuhiko Aoki\n\nIâm currently making adjustments to the newly developed âactive time battle systemâ. While players are traversing through the different areas in the game, theyâll run into events in which trigger encounters with monsters. Weâve included hundreds of types of such events and they are all hand-crafted. So I think that players will be surprised to see the diversity in the patterns in which these events come into motion. While in battle, the characters move as if they were in an action game and we want players to feel a great sense of speed when theyâre fighting enemies.\n\nChrono Trigger\n\nDreams now transcend time and space.\n\nScreenshot Unique and Different Lines[edit]\n\nTranscribed by GekkaHikko and translated by GlitterBerri.\n\nLeft Panel\n\nããªã¤ããã¢ã­ã©\n\nããªã¤ãã¦ã¦ã¸\n\nãµã«ã°ãããã­ãã\n\nRight Panel\n\nã­ã£ã©ã¯ã¿ã¼ãã¶ã¤ãã¼\n\nã²ã¼ã ã¯ãªã¨ã¤ã¿ã¼Left Panel\n\nToriyama Akira\n\nHorii Yuuji\n\nSakaguchi Hironobu\n\nRight Panel\n\nCharacter Designer\n\nGame Creator\n\nLeft Panel\n\nããªã¤ããã¢ã­ã©\n\nä»£è¡¨ä½ï¼\n\nãã©ã´ã³ãã¼ã«\n\n(é±åå°å¹´ã¸ã£ã³ã\n\nå¥½ï¼éï¼ä¸­\n\nRight Panel\n\nã­ã£ã©ã¯ã¿ã¼ãã¶ã¤ãã¼\n\nã²ã¼ã ã¯ãªã¨ã¤ã¿ã¼\n\nBottom Panel\n\né³¥å±±ãæ\n\nLeft Panel\n\nToriyama Akira\n\nWork/\n\nDragon Ball\n\n(Weekly Shounen Jump)\n\nRight Panel\n\nCharacter Designer\n\nGame Creator\n\nBottom Panel\n\nToriyama Akira\n\nLeft Panel\n\nããªã¤ãã¦ã¦ã¸\n\nä»£è¡¨ä½ï¼\n\nãã©ã´ã³ã¯ã¨ã¹ã\n\nããã ãã¹ããªã¼ã\n\nRight Panel\n\nã­ã£ã©ã¯ã¿ã¼ãã¶ã¤ãã¼\n\nã²ã¼ã ã¯ãªã¨ã¤ã¿ã¼\n\nBottom Panel\n\nå äºãéäº\n\nLeft Panel\n\nHorii Yuuji\n\nWork/\n\nDragon Quest\n\nItadaki Street\n\nRight Panel\n\nCharacter Designer\n\nGame Creator\n\nBottom Panel\n\nHorii Yuuji\n\nLeft Panel\n\nãµã«ã°ãããã­ãã\n\nä»£è¡¨ä½ï¼\n\nãã¡ã¤ãã«ãã¡ã³ã¿ã¸ã¼\n\nRight Panel\n\nã­ã£ã©ã¯ã¿ã¼ãã¶ã¤ãã¼\n\nã²ã¼ã ã¯ãªã¨ã¤ã¿ã¼\n\nBottom Panel\n\nåå£åä¿¡Left Panel\n\nSakaguchi Hironobu\n\nWork/\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nRight Panel\n\nCharacter Designer\n\nGame Creator\n\nBottom Panel\n\nSakaguchi Hironobu\n\n(not available)Chancellor: Hmph!

This Next Gate featured a postcard sent by a reader, asking why preview coverage in 1994 looked so different than the final product. What is thus established:\n\nThe V-Jump Festival 1994 VHS video apparently shows a 24 Mb build, prior to Chrono Trigger's expansion to 32 Mb.\n\nThe ice field map is a location that's floating in the sky. The magazine speculates that this area was like Zeal, but it's obvious they aren't sure what its purpose was.\n\nThe darkened chamber with the two Zeal statues \"had something to do with techs\", according to Square. The magazine speculates that Spekkio may have been involved.\n\nA Mode 7 overworld mode is shown. It's difficult to tell if it's Ayla or Marle walking on it.\n\nSpeculation:\n\nAre the R-66 series in the dummied out location \"Robot village\"?\n\nZenan Bridge has gravestones by the entrance. See later on this article, \"Mock-up Recreation\" section, for speculation on this based on the possible name of Zenan Bridge in the 24Mb build.\n\nV-Jump Player's Guide[edit]\n\n188 Toriyama sketches\n\n189 Toriyama sketches\n\nThe details of the making of Toriyamaâs character illustrations finally revealed. Letâs turn back the clock a bit and take a look at how the characters were born and how they evolved.\n\nChrono â The Protagonist That Retained His Innocence: His hairstyle, clothing, the Japanese sword he wieldsâ¦ it seems that the protagonist Chronoâs image has been more or less set in stone since the beginning. Only his expression belies his youth here.\n\nLucca â The Wise & Lovely Inventor Girl Genius: It seems that Luccaâs design has also been more or less set in stone since early development. The difference lies in her symbol-emblazoned headgear being a headband rather than than a cap.\n\nMagus â The Leader of the Demon Tribe, Shrouded in Sorrow: His cold gaze and long hair remain the same. Only the helmut and armor he was equipped with in early development are different from the final game. His pose is different as well. Kind of cool, isnât it?\n\nMarle â A Miniskirt Suited Her!: Her ponytail and bow gun are the same, but it seems that at first she wore a skirt. Her appearance is somewhat Robin Hood-esque.\n\nRobo â He Was Truly a Machine: His image changed so much that practically nothing of his prototype was retained. He was designed as a machine. He gradually became a little more human-esque, however.\n\nAyla â Her Beauty Was More Prominent Than Her Strength: Ayla has changed quite a bit. Instead of the curly hair she sports today, her hair was once straight and long. In addition, she isnât wearing her customary fur bikini. Her appearance looks quite neat and tidy.\n\nFrog â A Fiery Spirit Lies Hidden Within his Atypical Form: Is Frog really a frog? It seems that his image hasnât changed very much since the beginning. His pose brings to mind a knight, however.\n\nFinally, all the masterpieces complete! Ahaha!\n\nToriyama: Just kidding, everyone worked hard. Robo and Ayla were the characters that changed the most.\n\nCaption: A mysterious cut character, the âOld Manâ. What a waste, not to use him. Heâs got a certain charm.\n\nthanks to GlitterBerri\n\nBrut Press Volume, December 1994[edit]\n\nRecovered by Cabbusses's Retro Obscurities here.

A timeless RPG created by masters from various fields.\n\nNext, we would like to talk to Mr. Yamashita of Square.\n\nYou mean that the masters from various fields have participated in this project? That's...\n\nAkira Toriyama, Yutaka Horii, and myself, Hironobu Sagauchi. We started Chrono Trigger with the idea of making the most interesting game in the world. An unprecedented story and events that transcend time and space. A dream game that pushes the limits of RPGs with a wide variety of characters and breathtaking graphics. Chrono Trigger, the most epic role-playing game of this century, has finally been born. Game designer Yuji Horii, who has created numerous hit titles such as the Dragon Quest series, has created a new game, Chrono Trigger, which is the most epic role-playing game of the century.\n\nDr. Slump Dragon Ball\n\nAkira Toriyama, a popular manga artist who has released hit titles such as Dr. Slump Dragon Bus Ball. The three masters, Akira Toriyama, who has created hits such as Dr. Slump Dragon Ball, and Hironobu Sakaguchi, the supervisor, started the project with the determination to create the most interesting game ever.\n\nThe main character Chrono meets a girl in a square crowded with festivals. She urges him to go to the festival with her, and he decides to go with her. Crono decides to visit his childhood friend Lucca and her son to see their new invention. There he finds a mysterious machine...Marl, who is full of curiosity, willingly becomes a test subject. Crono's adventures unfold across all eras, past, present and future.\n\nAnd the unique characters that color the world of Chrono Trigger. The main character, a boy named Crono. Crono and Marl have a fateful encounter . Lucca, a girl who loves to invent . Mysterious character Frog who speaks human language . Eira, a female warrior of primitive times .\n\nAnd the latest system is introduced to combat. Active Time Battle, first introduced in Final Fantasy 4, has been significantly upgraded. Various other elements and new systems make Chrono Trigger even more fun and exciting. The first 32-megapixel Super NES RPG. The result is detailed graphics pushed to the limits of the hardware. The result is a world that is not at all inferior to the hardware of the new generation.\n\nThe biggest blockbuster of the century, role-playing game Chrono Trigger. March 1995.\n\n1995 Gendai Plus Chrono Trigger Feature[edit]\n\nSee 1995 Gendai Plus Chrono Trigger Feature.\n\nChrono Trigger Ultimania[edit]\n\nChrono Trigger Ultimania was released in January 2009, and featured interviews and concept art among other new content.\n\n[edit]\n\nPage 3, opening comments\n\nTranslated by Cherenkov.\n\nJapanese\n\nãã®æã¯ç ãã§ããã\n\nã¯ããå¤§æãããã«ä½ãäººéãã¾ã ãå¤§å°\n\nã«çã¾ãè½ã¡ãã°ããã®å¹¼ãç¨®æã ã£ãæä»£\n\n---ç ´æ» ãããããç é­ããæã®ä½å æ·±ãã«\n\nå·£é£ã£ãã®ã ã£ãã\n\nç å·£ã¯æ½ä¼ããªããé·ãå¹´æãããã¦è²ã¡ã\n\nããã¦æªæ¥ã®ä¸ç¹ã§æãé£ãç ´ããå°è¡¨ã¸ã¨\n\nããµããæãè²ãã§ããæ°å¤ã®çå½ãçµ¶æ» ã¸\n\nã¨è¿½ããããããã¯åæã«ãæã®å½ãã®ãã®\n\nã®çµçãæå³ããã\n\næ» ã³ã®æ¥ãè¿ãããã®å¹é£ãæã¯å¤¢ãè¦ãã\n\nã¿ãããã®ä¸ã§---å°ä¸ã§ã¤ãããã¦ããç\n\nãç©ãã¡ã®æ­´å²ããèµ°é¦¬çã®ããã«æãè¿ãã\n\nééãã¦ããããã¤ãã®æä»£ãããã¼ã¸ããã\n\nãããã«ã¤ãã¤ãã¨å¤¢æ³ããã\n\nããã¯ãçãã®ã³ããã¨ããå½ããè¨æ¶ã®\n\nã©ããã«æ­»ã®éå½ããéãããã¹ãè¨ããã¦\n\nã¯ããªããã¨ãæ¸å½ã«æ¢ãã¤ã¥ããè¡çºã ã£\n\nããç¡æè­ã«ããããã¨ãããçä¸å°½ãªæ­»ã«\n\nãããããçå½ã®ããã¹ãå§¿ã ã£ãã\n\nãã®å¤¢ã«ãå¿ããè ãã¡ãããã\n\næã®æ» äº¡ãæ±ºå®ããæ¥ããã999å¹´ããã\n\nã®ã¼ã£ãæä»£ã«çãã3äººã®è¥è ãã¡ãå¶ç¶\n\nã«ãæãè¶ ããææ®µãæã«å ¥ããå½¼ãã¯ãçµ¶\n\næã«å ã¾ããæã®è¡ãæ«ãç¥ããæ±ºæããã\n\nèªåãã¡ã«ã¯é¢ããã®ãªããæ°ãé ããªãã»ã©\n\nå ã®æªæ¥ã§ãããã¨ããããªããç ´æ» ããæã£\n\nã¦ã¿ãããã¨ãæãæ ãã¦æ­´å²ãå¤ããå¤§å°\n\nã«çãããã®ãã¡ã®åãçµéãã¦ãæã®å½ã\n\nåãç é­ããã®æã§åãã®ããã®ã ---ã¨ã\n\nãããã¦ãæã®å¤¢ã§ã¤ãªãããäºã¤ã®æä»£\n\nãè¡ãæ¥ãããã¯ã­ããã¡ã®æç©ºãè¶ ããå¤§\n\nåéºã®å¹ãä¸ããã\n\nãæªæ¥ããå¤ãããã ï¼ã\n\nEnglish\n\nThe planet was ill.\n\nIn the distant past, in the era when human beings were young and had only just been born from the earthâDestruction was being brought about by a terrible illness, nesting deep inside the planet.\n\nThe center of the illness, incubating and growing for many long years, until that time in the future when it will consume and destroy the planet. Bursting from the surface of the planet, forcing into extinction the many life forms the planet had given birth to. This simultaneously brought about the end of the planet's life as well.\n\nOn this day of destruction, at that very instant, the planet had a dream. Reliving and remembering all of the history of all the life upon the planet's surface, spinning before its eyes.\n\nTurning back the pages of countless eras, dreaming and reliving.\n\nIn order to preserve its life, searching its memories for a way to escape from the fate of death. The method of escape may not be found, but it is eagerly sought after.\n\nIn an unconscious struggle with the irrational death of all life.\n\nWithin this dream, there were those that answered. In an era 999 years before the determined day of ruination, lived 3 youths. By coincidence, discovering the means to cross through time, they knew the fate of this world wrapped in despair, and were determined.\n\nEven though a distant future with little connection to themselves, they were determined to save it from destruction. Traveling through time and changing history, and concentrating the strength of those living upon the planet, they seek to remove the disease threatening the life of the planet.\n\nThus, traveling back and forth between the five eras connected by the planet's dream, Crono and companions embark on their great adventure.\n\n[We will change the future!]\n\nIn case you'd like romaji:\n\nSono hoshi ha yandeita.

Her old pendant, which she treasures dearly, opens a gate to the past that sucks her in and draws back the curtains on Crono and his friends' adventure.\n\n<INFO BOX BESIDE MARL'S IMAGE>\n\nSEX: Female\n\nHOME ERA: The Present\n\nHOME: Guardia Castle\n\n<QUOTE; BROWN TEXT>\n\n'I'm my own girl BEFORE I'm a princess!'\n\n<SCREENSHOT 1 & BLACK BOX>\n\nKAERU: Indeed, youãresemble the queen closely.\n\nâMarl, thrown into the Middle Ages, is mistaken for her lookalike, Queen Leene.\n\n<SCREENSHOT 2 & BLACK BOX>\n\nMARL: I don't want to stay here anymore!

She debuts her great invention, the Super Dimensional Material Transfer Machine Telepods, at the Millenial Festival; when they cause a distortion in space-time that flings Marl into a different era, Lucca creates the Gate Holder--a device that uses the principles behind her telepods to stabilize space-time distortions--in order to rescue the girl.\n\n<INFO BOX BESIDE LUCCA'S IMAGE>\n\nSEX: Female\n\nHOME ERA: The Present\n\nHOME: Truce Village\n\n<QUOTE; BROWN TEXT>\n\n'No enemy can prevail against science!'\n\n<SCREENSHOT 1 & BLACK BOX>\n\nLUCCA: I'll fix it so that it won't do that.
