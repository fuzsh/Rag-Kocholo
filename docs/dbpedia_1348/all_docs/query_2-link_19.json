        "text": "This is part four of a series! The other parts can be found here: (one, two, three).\n\nAnd we’re back! Sorry it took so long, I had lots of work, a wedding, and a hurricane to deal with! But now it’s time for a soundtrack that I know is near and dear to a lot of people – Final Fantasy IV! Along with an original soundtrack, a remake soundtrack, and an arranged album, as we’ve come to expect, as well as a return of remixes, there is also another, shorter arranged album, and, for the first time, a piano collection album! This would start a trend of piano collection albums that would actually end up lasting longer into the series than the arranged albums – the last ‘piano collections’ album was for Final Fantasy XIII!\n\nI should give a small warning – though I like FFIV’s soundtrack, I’m not nearly as enamored by it as a lot of the rest of the internet seems to be. So it’s quite possible my picks will be at odds with popular opinion in some cases. I encourage you to look further into the soundtrack if you find yourself really liking all the tracks I recommend. Regardless, there’s a lot to love about this one, so let’s dive in!\n\nFinal Fantasy IV – SNES\n\nThe Super Famicom/SNES version of the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack was released in 1991 as an album titled “Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version“. It was Nobuo Uematsu’s first foray into higher-quality sound hardware for a videogame, a foray that was wildly successful by most standards.\n\nThere is a remastered version of this soundtrack, released in 2013. I highly recommend purchasing this version, should you decide you want to own this music. The remastered version has superior sound quality, of course, but more than that, it loops the songs twice instead of just once like on the original release, and it has a few extra tracks that didn’t make the cut before.\n\nThere’s a lot of tracks I like, but don’t quite love in this one, so expect a lot of songs in the ‘other fun tracks’ section.\n\nWhat you should definitely listen to:\n\nTheme of Love – starting strong, with arguably the most well-known and beloved piece of music from this whole soundtrack. There’s a good reason for it – it’s an amazing, beautiful track.\n\nThe Dreadful Fight – also known as “Battle of the Four Fiends”, this is a fantastic song that really ups the drama of the battle music to this point, cluing you into just how much of a challenge this series of bosses truly poses to you.\n\nMain Theme of Final Fantasy IV – a fun, flowing track that does a great job of setting the overall tone for the game.\n\nMystic Mysidia – there’s some really fun use of various sound effects in this one, that work to give an odd, unfamiliar air to the town it represents.\n\nDancing Calcobrena – it’s short, but boy does this track, a creepy waltz, leave a lasting impression.\n\nFight 1 – another great, peppy fight theme.\n\nSamba de Chobobo! – the song that would start the tradition of remixing the chocobo theme with different musical styles – and what a way to kick that tradition off!\n\nOther fun tracks:\n\nTower of Bab-il – a very enjoyable dungeon theme.\n\nThe Final Battle – Uematsu has a fun time again with the final boss music again, but it’s not as relistenable to me as many of his other efforts.\n\nThe Lunarians – though it’s not a very exciting track, I love the otherworldly tone this piece of music sets.\n\nTroian Beauty – a classic track that grates on me if I listen to it too much.\n\nCry in Sorrow – a sad track for a terrible loss.\n\nRydia – the theme for the character of the same name, with an appropriate amount of melancholy.\n\nThe Prelude – the first version of this melody that I like a fair bit.\n\nFight 2 – this is actually the normal boss battle music, and it’s fun, even if it’s not quite as catchy as Fight 1.\n\nHey, Cid! – a jolly theme for a version of jolly version of Cid.\n\nGolbez Clad in Darkness – the theme for the main villain (throughout most of the game), there’s some interesting use of a synthesized organ, but there’s not a lot else going on here, especially compared to later villain themes.\n\nFabul – an interesting track that manages to sound like a faraway land, as it no doubt intended.\n\nWelcome to Our Town! – the normal town theme, peaceful and inviting.\n\nThe Airship – another airship theme, and it’s fun, but not much different than all the others up to this point.\n\nFanfare – that good ol’ battle ending music.\n\nChocobo-Chocobo – pretty much the last ‘normal’ version of this theme, as virtually all others past this point are in some other musical style.\n\nChocobo Forest – a cute little Chocobo theme variant. This one can’t be found on the original release, only the remaster.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV – NDS\n\nReleased in 2008, the soundtrack to the DS remake of Final Fantasy IV was called “Final Fantasy IV Original Soundtrack“. Uematsu’s original tracks were rearranged for the DS hardware by Junya Nakano and Kenichiro Fukui, who did a fine job translating the original work.\n\nThis is the last remake soundtrack for quite some time, as the other SNES-era and the PS1-era games never had their music rearranged when they were ported to other systems.\n\nWhat you should definitely listen to:\n\nMoonlight ~Ending Version~ – it’s a vocal version of the Theme of Love, and it’s utterly gorgeous, and I love it.\n\nTheme of Love – an amazing song, now with more harp.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV Main Theme – I love the sound of the bass in this version.\n\nBattle 1 – this rearranged version of an old battle theme miraculously still sounds good!\n\nBattle with Golbez’s Four Emperors – listen to that lovely bass.\n\nTroia – the instrumentality of this version works a lot better for me than the original.\n\nOther fun tracks:\n\nThe Lunarians – this one sounds a bit more dire now.\n\nKingdom Baron – greater instrumentality makes for a more sonically rich and enjoyable version of this formerly mediocre song.\n\nBattle 2 – the boss music returns, and honestly I like this one a bit better than the original, but it’s still my least favorite FFIV battle theme.\n\nRydia – harp and strings make this song even more melancholy than before.\n\nBoss Cid – I love that tuba.\n\nMystic Mysidia – I don’t find the sounds in this one as charming as the original’s, but it’s still a good song.\n\nCastle Damcyan – I think it’s the bass that makes me enjoy this song more than the original.\n\nKing Giott’s Castle – this song makes me feel like I’m going to fall over – in a good way?\n\nGolbez, Clad in Darkness – now with more organ-y organ.\n\nDancing Doll Calcobrena – something’s a little lost in translation on this one.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV – Minimum Album, Celtic Moon, Piano Collections, & After Years\n\nFinal Fantasy IV was popular, and that popularity spawned several music albums, many remakes, and even sequels. There’s a lot of extra music to listen to, but is all of it worth it? Frankly, no. If you were to only buy one of the arrangement albums for FFIV, I would far and away recommend Celtic Moon. But, for the sake of completion, here’s the good stuff from all three side albums, and from the sequel game, The After Years.\n\nMinimum Album:\n\nThis album is decent, but there’s nothing particularly amazing about it. It includes arranged versions of some songs, and a few unreleased tracks. The best thing on it is, perhaps unsurpringly, the Theme of Love arrangement.\n\nCeltic Moon:\n\nThis 1991 release features, as one might expect from the title, Celtic arrangements of various FFIV tracks. They’re arranged by Máire Breatnach, and the majority of them are great. My absolute favorites are:\n\nMystic Mysidia – you haven’t lived until you’ve heard this one. It works so perfectly, and is by far my favorite track on the album.\n\nMain Theme of Final Fantasy IV – this is an overall very relaxing version of the main theme, with a fun extra melody thrown in partway through, and some really great percussion.\n\nDancing Calcobrena – the violin works so well for this song, and the second melody is quite good, too, even if it’s rather different.\n\nPiano Collections:\n\nThis 1992 album features piano renditions of several FFIV tracks, performed by Toshiyuki Mori. It’s a solid album, but I vastly prefer later piano collections.\n\nStandouts include: The Prelude, Rydia, and, once again my favorite, Theme of Love.\n\nThe After Years (Final Fantasy IV & The After Years Sounds Plus):\n\nThe soundtrack to The After Years, composed by Junya Nakano, is, like the game it represents, mostly forgettable. The one track I would most recommend is Epilogue II.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV – Remixes\n\nFinal Fantasy IV’s music is popular enough to have spawned not only a lot of remixes, but a whole fan remix album, called Echoes of Betrayal, Light of Redemption. Here’s a list of my favorites, both from that album, and from elsewhere on the internet (by which I mean ocremix.org).\n\nSmiling Hilltop for Four Hands, Kind of Green, All Your Calcobrena Are Belong to Us, Smooth Sun of Magma, Rydia’s Chocobo, and A Chocobo’s Mystic Life.\n\nThat’s it for the FFMG this time around. If there’s a song you feel I missed or should give a second chance to, leave a comment, and I’ll listen to and reconsider it! Let me know if there’s something different or more you’d like from me in these articles, or hey, if you just wanna tell me you like my picks, that’s cool too!\n\nNext time it’ll be the often-neglected Final Fantasy V!"
