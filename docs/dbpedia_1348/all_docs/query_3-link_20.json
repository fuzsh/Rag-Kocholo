        "text": "The following is a summary by bigscarythings\n\nLavi, Nayuta and Mikage are having tea together, but Mikage is in a sour mood. When Mikage rejects even candy, Lavi and Nayuta worry that she's sick, until Mikage outright tells them to ask her what's going on, whereupon she reveals that Mitama \"betrayed her.\" What seems to have happened is that Mikage was going to Mitama's shop with a surprise gift for Mitama, eager to see the look on Mitama's face...but finds Momoko, Kaede and Rena are there, telling a story to Mitama and joking around with her. Yachiyo and Mifuyu soon arrive with some snacks to share, which makes Mitama thrilled. Mikage explains that she believed neither she or Mitama had any friends, and the fact that Mitama now has them feels like a betrayal. Lavi suggests that if Mikage is jealous, then she should strive to make friends, too - since Mikage doesn’t want to make friends with her schoolmates, Lavi suggests making some Magical Girl friends instead. With that decided, Mikage's mood flips right around.\n\nSome time later, at school, some NPCs spot Mikage - one of them seems to have been one of Mikage's bullies - and they make a point to avoid Mikage as she walks by. Mikage shrugs it off, determined to make lots of Magical Girl friends - until she realizes she doesn't actually know where to find them to begin with. Mikage goes to the middle school and asks Himika where to meet Magical Girls. Himika suggests the Coordinator's, but Mikage wants to keep this mission a secret from Mitama. Himika knows one place that fits the bill - Emiri's counseling center!\n\nHimika and Mikage go to the consultation center, where Sasara, Asuka, Kanoko and Emiri are chatting. Himika introduces Mikage as Mitama's sister, which surprises Asuka, Sasara, and Emiri. The more they look her over, the more obvious it becomes, and they quickly fawn over her (cue that one memoria) - Mikage helps herself to some candy and revels in the attention - she didn't realize being Mitama's sister could make her so popular. At Emiri’s prompting, Mikage explains that she's looking for a Magical Girl to be her friend - but, Emiri points out, isn't she already Mikage's friend? Along with Sasara, Kanoko, and Asuka? Sasara and Kanoko point out that friendship isn't that simple. Asuka proposes that Mikage can deepen her friendships with a hard workout at the dojo. When Sasara calls her out for recruiting, Asuka switches the topic to fashion, which the other girls eager join in on. Through this, Mikage sees and actually likes Kanoko's designs, and agrees to try on some of the outfits that are stored in the counseling office, and their impromptu fashion show is a blast.\n\nShe and Himika leave, but Mikage wonders if they really are friends - since Kanoko is closer to Mitama's age, were they just amusing her like a kid instead of seeing her as a friend? Mikage deicdes she wants to meet some girls around her age, prompting Himika to suggest meeting Ui, along with Touka and Nemu. Mikage isn't so sure about being able to befriend Touka and Nemu, in light of them being geniuses, but will think about it.\n\nWhen Mikage returns home, she's surprised Mitama came home early. Mitama reveals a girl, Ui, has been kidnapped by Promised Blood. Expressing her fear that something will happen to Mikage, she urges Mikage not to reveal to anyone she's a Magical Girl and not to interact with anyone from the KMU. Mikage reluctantly agrees, but in her voiced line, expresses frustration that she was making friends, but now, her efforts have been foiled.\n\nSome time later, Mitama prepares to head out for more adjustment appointments, and Mikage gets mad at the hypocrisy - how come Mitama gets to go out and meet with KMU people, while Mikage is supposed to avoid them? Mitama argues that she's there for work, but Mikage points out that Mitama gets to have fun and goof around with her clients - it's not strictly business. Mitama changes tacks by urging Mikage to have patience, but Mikage is fed up - she's going to find a new big sister! She runs out and goes to Emiri's office, which turns out to be closed. That's when Rika and Ren approach - seems like they wanted to pop in and hang out with Emiri, too - and bump into Mikage. Rika assumes Mikage is a thief, but Mikage points out she knows Emiri, and Ren and Rika quickly connect the dots and realize she's Mitama's sister.\n\nFrom there, copying an earlier summary - Rika and Mikage hit it off over fashion. Rika takes Mikage to check out some low-price fashion stores, and Mikage explains the situation with Mitama along the way. At the store, Mikage loves the items on sale, but left her wallet at home, and only has 100 yen to spare. She tries puppy dog eyes on Rika, but Rika immediately catches on and tells her (with a sad look) that she won't buy it for Mikage. The three end up playing a crane game instead. Mikage loses her round, and Rika caves in and takes over, winning several stuffed animals, giving them to Ren and Mikage. Mikage asks Rika to be her big sister; Rika turns her down, but says she's happy to help Mikage when she needs it, and encourages her to talk to Mitama.\n\nMikage still isn't in the mood to come home, however. She instead decides to go find Kanoko, based on knowing Kanoko’s ward and that her family owns a factory. She successfully does so. When she gets caught, it seems like she tries disguising herself behind the stuffed animals Rika got for her, but Kanoko tells her to cut it out. Kanoko says she'll overlook the fact that Mikage basically stalked her, but says Mikage should go home, since it's getting dark. Mikage explains her issues, and Kanoko decides to let Mikage hang out for a bit and help make a pendant. It goes well. Mikage asks if Kanoko wants to be her sister, tempting her with the idea of Kanoko getting to dress up her sister, but before Kanoko can give in, Mitama finds them. She's had to go around and talk to a lot of girls to help trace Mikage's steps, and makes to drag Mikage home. Mikage pleads for Kanoko to help, but Kanoko tells her she had it coming, and it's best to have family members who scold you - her dad is strict, but she knows it's because he cares for her and is helping her.\n\nAt home, Mitama lays out the facts - Mikage is making lots of friends, which isn't a bad thing, but Mitama made it clear she's not to get involved with KMU girls. Mitama says Mikage needs to keep her phone charged - she's been calling Mikage all day with no response. That reveals that Mikage had blocked Mitama, and Mitama gets stern - they're in the middle of a war right now; anything could happen. Mikage finally vents her issues to Mitama - she's not allowed to make friends with magical girls, nor can she make at school (but she doesn't want to get along with her schoolmates to begin with), but Mitama gets to have all the friends she wants. All Mitama can do is apologize, but Mikage is still mad. Hungry, however, Mikage soon goes to the kitchen, and finds Mitama has made all of Mikage's favorite foods for dinner. In an off-screen sequence, she finds Mitama and apologizes (and Mitama does likewise), and Mikage gives Mitama the pendant she made with Kanoko.\n\nIn her voiced line, she apologizes to Mitama again, knowing how hard Mitama must have it right now.\n\nFor reasons that will be apparent in a few sentences, this seems to take place some time after Act 1 and 2. Mitama wears Mikage's pendant everywhere she goes. Today, Mitama is delivering(?) something to the guy running for mayor (the election is a recurring plot point in arc 2 so far), and Mikage wants to go, too. Mitama says it'll be boring and doesn't want to bother Mikage, but when Mikage frets, Mitama sends her on an errand to return a bento container to Chiaki's. Along the way, Mikage tries to act mature, and once there, bumps into Riko and Ui. She doesn't recognize them, but they recognize her as Mitama's kid sister. Even though, again, Mikage isn't supposed to hang out with them, once Ui invites her to play, she quickly agrees. First, however, Riko has to finish her work, so the three team up to help her finish her chores, though Mikage is determined to act like the big sister to Riko and Ui.\n\nIt doesn't work. Riko is the most experienced one, after all, and Mikage makes a lot of mistakes. She feels bad, but Ui and Riko are very happy with her work, which prompts Mikage to ask them, \"Why are you two so kind?\" She explains how the other kids at school aren't anything like them. Riko explains Mikage did her best, and did all this to help Riko, which makes her so happy. Mikage asks if all magical girls are like this - she explains her mission to make friends, noting how all the magical girls she's met so far seem so kind. Ui theorizes it's because magical girls are born of hope (and thus don't want to hurt people or make them sad), and that they know pain, which makes them kinder people as a result - at least, that's Iroha's take. With their work done, the three of them are now free to go play, and run out to do so. Mikage decides to herself that she wants to be friends with Riko and Ui, and introduce them to Sudachi someday so all four of them can be friends and play together.\n\nThe next day, Mikage is eager to go out again, but Mitama stops her, pleading with her to tell the truth of where she's going and with who. Mikage cracks and explains she's going out to play with Ui and Riko at Riko's place, even though she knows she's not supposed to meet with KMU girls. Mitama asks her yet again to please not go out, and Mikage cedes. Mitama apologizes profusely. Shortly after, however, Mikage gets texts from Riko and Ui, who explain they've been ordered to stay home, too. This prompts Mikage to flash back to the night she made her wish - we don't see her exact wish, but after the flashback, she thinks to herself: She's known her sister's wish. Ever since Mikage's wish was granted, it feels like she's been \"riding a wave.\" Try as she might, no matter what she does, it feels like she \"can't move forward,\" citing how she's been kept away from the KMU girls. She says she \"can't do this alone…\" We finish off with Mikage having tea again with Lavi and Nayuta, who want updates on Mikage's hunt for friends. Mikage explains how she's met a lot of Magical Girls, but she kept getting stymied by Mitama telling her not to associate with KMU girls. Lavi explains how the KMU girls are terribly upset, but she and Nayuta don't elaborate when Mikage asks why. Mikage seems to accept the lack of answer, to Nayuta's surprise. To this, Mikage says \"I think all this had to happen.\" She'll roll with this for now, but knows there will be a time when there will be a \"big wave\" that cannot be resisted, and that will when she has to act to change it. Nayuta says that's a big task, but Mikage is confident she can do it! She thinks to herself, \"Knowing my sister's wish...I pushed back on the wave she caused!\"\n\nShe says she won't give up on making friends with the KMU, either. She says out loud that Lavi and Nayuta are much older than her, so they're not exactly friends with her, but...wait a minute! They can be her big sisters instead! She instantly starts calling them such and pleads for them to take her to the candy shop. Lavi and Nayuta seem to give each other a look, then decide to treat Mikage just for one day. In the end, Mikage's voiced line expresses how one day, she wants her and Sudachi to be able to play with everyone."
