        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nBeesting\n\n65%Xbox 360\n\nIts a short FF game, but I did not want it to go any longer by the end. The story did not pull me in at all.\n\nGood\n\n- Graphics are amazing.\n\n- Random monster encounters are well implemented.\n\n- Battle system is quick pace and exciting. This only applies if you enjoyed FF13's battle system.\n\n- Monsters are fun to find and collect, since you are able to upgrade them and have them fight with you.\n\nBad\n\n- Environments such as plants and objects do not interact with your character properly. Small plants do not get bent when you pass by them, instead, there is like an invisible barrier around these objects such that you cannot even touch it.\n\n- The game speaks of paradoxes and timeline contradictions, but the puzzles the games gives you to solve that will \"correct\" these anomalies have nothing to do with a paradox. The puzzles are out of place with the story.\n\n- Puzzles can get a bit repetitive. One puzzle called \"hands of time\" requires pen and paper, unless you have phenomenal memory. On top of that, the clock puzzles are more work than actual fun.\n\n- Farming is needed for some materials in order to upgrade your monster. You also have to look for the locations, there are no indications of what monsters will drop what materials. You have to remember what the certain type of material the monster dropped, then go back to that area before and farm.\n\n- Not enough engagement with Final Fantasy 13 old characters.\n\n- Loading time when entering different worlds are too long. This loading time kills the incentive to hunt for items in previous worlds. When the game requires you to hunt, it becomes very annoying.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nwalkonwalkoff\n\n95%PlayStation 3\n\n28h Played\n\nThe Final Fantasy XIII trilogy is divisive, each entry as much as the other and the opinions as varying. But I will say that Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a great game. Why? Because it adds on to the FFXIII's atb style gameplay with a unique monster capturing mechanic where your monsters fill in as the third member of your party throughout the game. And collecting, rotating the 3d models of the monsters you grinded or maybe got lucky obtaining is incredibly satisfying. Not to mention the total collectible roster of monsters encapsulates nearly *every* mob you meet, significant or not. Maybe that's why franchises like pokemon and dragon quest monsters never fail.\n\nThe story and themes themselves are fun and a little out there. I know for each FFXIII game there's some loser on reddit saying this is the worst one ever!!! and that this ruins the sanctity of Fabula Nova Chrysalis or something but this opinion should fall on deaf ears after all, this is a second entry final fantasy game. This has been done before with FF X-2; it's a sequel made just because they can, and you should know that by now. Not to say it's necessarily bad though, because it's not.\n\nI remember this game coming out around the era of the world's introduction to the first wave of paid eshop dlcs. At the time people, me included, were naturally enraged in having to spend more on an already expensive full price console game. This most likely had an in impact on this game's lasting memory and its reputations. However, today we are enslaved gamers; dlc is an every day staple, and so from a present day perspective the collisseum DLCs are fun and great, getting to challenge unique artistic interpretations of of Gilgamesh, Ultros, Typhon, Omega, Pupu (from Final Fantasy VIII) from the B List uncommon Final Fantasy reoccuring cast is a refreshing wind reserved for a game like this that aims to just have fun. Lightning, Lieutenant Amodar, and Jihl Nabaat from the first game in the trilogy are recruitable upon defeat. A shame though, with the Half-Life N7 and Assassin's creed Ezio outfits being long delisted.\n\nThe only truly egregious thing is that the game ends with a \"to be continued...\" message which must've been infuriating to see, but I am writing this having finally beaten the game I never had time to end since middle school a decade later so that's now a non-issue since the next and final entry has been long released. I'm not sure if this needs mentioning, but it is a Square-Enix game so it looked absolutely stunning for its time, and very impressive on the PS3 even today. As a final word all I will say is that you will not regret playing this like you might with the many other games you might be thinking of starting at the moment.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nSpinnerweb\n\n40%PC\n\n8h Progress\n\nIt's hard for me to decide which I hate more as a sequel to an FF game I loved, this or X-2. Both of them manage to do what feels like irreparable damage to the epic tales that their predecessors were.\n\nThe entire story is founded on a stupid fucking retcon that cheapens the ending of XIII, and it only gets worse from there. I've watched music videos that have a more coherent plot than whatever this pile of shit is. It hamfists in elements of time travel and parallel worlds that are not a part of the original game's mythos at all, brings in an unwanted and unnecessary character for no apparent reason except as the writer's OC in this fanfiction that somehow gaslit its way to official status. Don't be fucking fooled, it's all a sham, the story is nonsensical, meandering and entirely at odds with all that is good in the world. I absolutely despise stories like these that constantly use big words like 'paradox' and 'forbidden history' and 'spacetime fortex' in a vain attempt to hide the fact that they absolutely SUCK. They suck in every single one of the multiple universes the writers use as an excuse for their storytelling ineptitude.\n\nI couldn't wait for this game to shut the fuck up, I stopped caring entirely, and true, just like XIII before it, it looks dazzling, the visuals are so good that it feels like playing a CGI film, but it's hard to appreciate when it stands for absolutely nothing, and that little shit gremlin moglin keeps yelling KUPO KUPO KUPOOOO in every scene so we can have some cutesy shit to go with the countless layers of obfuscation that drive this plot into the ground, if I had a gun I'd shoot that fucking hell-cherub so fast.\n\nThe gameplay isn't good either. As I said in my essay for XIII, linearity was not a problem in that game because it kept it focused; this game on the other hand is filled with false choices that is just time-wasting mechanics posing as open-endedness. For example, pretty early on you're presented with the 'choice' to either fight a boss head-on or walk three paces along an alternative path to get a device that weakens him. My manly nature dictates that I fight him head-on without resorting to trickery, but he will one-hit kill your party, so you're forced to take the second option anyway. Then why is it a choice at all? That's right: to pretend this game isn't every bit as linear as its predecessor, when it is, when it's a fucking SHAM. To waste your fucking time. The game also really liked to recycle its bosses, to interrupt boss fights with cinematic moments and QTEs and cutscenes, to basically do all that video games of this time were derided for in such an especially egregious fashion that even I found them annoying when I generally don't mind QTEs and the like at all, hell I often defend them, but this isn't a fucking action game is it?\n\nTo put it nicely, QTEs aren't what I'm looking for in a turn-based RPG. To put it not-so-nicely, these fucks might be able to deceive other people into thinking they have any input into the story by having four dialogue options pop up with a hilariously fancy 'Live Trigger!' splash in every conversation, but not me. I don't give a fuck. I don't get at all what's the appeal of these 'choices' that don't change one iota of the game, and the way they're presented like such a huge feature is kinda amusing to see in the same way watching a midget attempt to score a three-point field goal would be amusing. I am very upset with this game. Having only two party members and a rotating cast of captive Pokemon doesn't do it for me either, the battle system feels lesser than its predecessor with inconsequential features like Wounds (lowering your maximum HP) put in only for the sake of having more new features.\n\nThe music is nice, but I don't feel it melds into the game well pretty often - it's like they composed a lot of good tracks in a vacuum and then overlaid them into the game without too much consideration for context. In a game where the voice actors can't even get the inflections of their lines right, that would be too much to ask.\n\nThis game is a disservice and a blight on its predecessor, which I absolutely loved. It should have been left to rot on whatever page of Fanfiction.net it was uploaded to. 4/10.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nsmacd\n\n50%Xbox 360\n\n54h 15m Played\n\nFF13-2 is a game that has so much promise, but somehow managed to be a complete misstep from the beginning to the end. It takes extra effort to make a time travel plot boring, but this game succeeded. Not to mention making monster catching feel like a chore.\n\nMy experience with FF13 is that I disliked the setting and the story, but the underlying mechanics weren't bad. Unfortunately for FF13-2, they listened to \"fans\" and \"fixed\" all the wrong things. The battle system and character development was easily the best part of the first game. In 13-2, its relegated to a nuisance and the character development was changed in a way to make it a complete drag. Subsequently, I found fighting in FF13-2 something I wanted to avoid whenever possible.\n\nI'm not even sure what to say about the story. Or the characters. The world and setting was completely disjoint, which is a good way to describe the story as a consequence. You hop around time to completely random locations to do completely random things, and it never feels like a cohesive world or story.\n\nI was looking forward to this game, as everything I'd heard made me think I'd love this game. I tried to remain cautiously optimistic, but was only disappointed. There is no reason this game needed to exist, and I don't feel like I got anything out of playing it. Further, the DLC was among the worst DLC I've ever played, and I regret buying any of them.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nNenji_Avero\n\n80%PC\n\n30h 2m Played\n\n**Warning: Contains minor spoilers**\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 is one of those games where you spend hours doing stuff, but you usually don't really know what you're doing, or why you're doing it. Later, you find out, and the game gets more interesting.\n\nThis game has some differences from the first part of trilogy, and it's got a nice pace. However, playing FF13-2 felt like I was playing a game that is completely unrelated to FF13.\n\nI can't put my finger on it, but something was bothering throughout the game. Don't get me wrong - I liked it, I liked it a lot. It's different than many FF titles in more than one way, but at the same time - it felt as if it's not really a Final Fantasy game. More like a game that borrows characters and some things from Final Fantasy, but is an individual game.\n\nThe plot is weird, we all know that. Everything is in some kind of time-chaos, which leaves us to fix everything through lots of action, FMV sequences and dialogues. That's what we love about Final Fantasy, right? I liked the plot and the character progression. What I hated was the fact that I had very little chance to play with FF13 characters, since everything was revolving around the newcomer and Light's sister. Another thing I didn't like about the game was the limited focus on Alyssa's character, so her development seems a bit forced.\n\nThe Battle system is very similar to FF13's, so everyhing is great until you come to the \"Cinematic Action\" parts of the game. It's frustrating and annoying, and should've stayed a feature in one of those old Spider-Man games. It has no place in a Final Fantasy title IMHO. Action is cool, and the battle-animations are great. Again, I would love to have seen more of the original FF13 cast, but Noel and Serah did a fine job too.\n\nNow that Lightning Returns has come to steam too, I will finally be able to finish this trilogy, and this makes me very happy. Playing through Final Fantasy XIII-2 left me with mixed feelings. Final Fantasy 13 is a game that I will surely play again some day, but I'm not sure I want to play 13-2 ever again. I'll be honest and say that I finished this game just for the story, and was not too interested in many of the side-quests (although I did some).\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 is a nice filler between FF13 and Lightning Returns, but playing this game I couldn't get rid of the \"sequel syndrome\". It's good, but not as good as FF13. I recommend the game to any Final Fantasy fan, and I think that players who are new to FF will like it as well.\n\nDon't play it if you love Counter Strike, Black Ops and Fallout. It's not that type of game, and you probably won't like it at all.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nPrivate\n\n70%PC\n\n28h 45m Played\n\nThis game is a real mix bag of polar opposite opinions.\n\nFirst, the story is fantastic. FXIII is in by no means my favourite FF game, but I enjoyed it depite all of its problems. The story here though is pretty much stand alone from part one, with little mention of the infamous Fal Cie and l'Cie. If you wanted you could probably jump right in here. And instead of being strictly linear, the story is much more \"Choose-your-own-adventure\" like, with you bouncing about time and space as if it was a novel series of Doctor Who, meeting characters old and new at different points throughout their lives. It is much more remiscent of Chrono Trigger rather than FF. The ending as well does not dissapoint, leaving me with the strong temptation to start part 3 (Lightning returns) immediately.\n\nIn terms of the core gameplay the combat is almost exact same as what was seen in the first FFXIII game, really only with the Paradigm shifts being a bit faster, and the third member of your party being chosen from a selection of monsters you defeat along the way.\n\nThe rest of the game it self beyond this (with respect to the PC port), however, is a mess.\n\nFirst and foremost is that the game cannot handle cloud saves when connecting with Steam, and therefore this needs to be disabled.\n\nThe game also has issues running at higher graphic settings (despite my PC running newer games perfectly fine), outright crashing everytime you set foot in certain locations.\n\nThe sound mixing is all over the place, most notably in cutscenes, where character voices are drowned out by either background noise or music (thankful for subtitles here!)\n\nMini-games as well are simply frustrating with one clock game in which one needs either a PhD in Maths (or a dedictad website) to solve.\n\nIf you can get past these issues, there is a gem of a story here for FF fans. It's just a question of whether or not you're willing to put up with all of the issues to see it through."
