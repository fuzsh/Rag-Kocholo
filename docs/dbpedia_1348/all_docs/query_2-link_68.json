        "text": "//==============================================================================================\\\\\n\n\\\\==============================================================================================//\n\nModders Ressources:\n\nIf you want to learn how to modify the game in all kinds of different and unique ways then I would recommend you look at my articles below, as I started sharing my methods to modding various things: (Not finished, but still a great start for anyone looking to learn)\n\nHow To Edit All Text Based \".bin\" Or \".dat\" Files + Documentation\n\nHow To Edit \".ard\" Files + Documentation\n\nHow to Edit \".ebp\" Files (Enemy Scripts ONLY) + Documentation\n\nHow To Add New Monsters To The Game + Enemy Scaling\n\nHow To Modify Clan Primer Entries, Entry Page Count, Kill Count Per Page, Entry Placement, etc.\n\n//==========================================================================================\\\\\n\n\\\\==========================================================================================//\n\nRequirements\n\nHello, if you would like to replace the music in this game then firstly you will require the following 4 programs:\n\nVBF Browser\n\nSounds Of Ivalice: Audio Replacement Tool\n\nWavosaur\n\nFoobar2000\n\nVBF Browser is required to access the sound files within the game, Sounds Of Ivalice is so you can access the music directly and replace it, Wavosaur is to add loop points as it's required or else the music will never work, and finally Foobar2000 so you can convert whichever audio track to the correct format for the game to read.\n\n//==========================================================================================\\\\\n\n\\\\==========================================================================================//\n\nStep 1 - Extract The Audio Files From Your Game\n\nFirst thing you should do is manually download VBF Browser from the link above in the requirements section, then open the program. You should see 3 buttons on the top, \"Open\" and \"Exit\" and \"Previous\". Select open, then locate your Final Fantasy XII TZA root folder (The game's installation location). Using both a windows OS and steam, it should typically be located in this location unless you decided to install it somewhere else:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\FINAL FANTASY XII THE ZODIAC AGE\n\nThen once it loads, select this directory:\n\nps2data/sound/music/magi_data/win\n\nAll of the files there are the music files, all listed as musicXXX.win.mab Just select the file(s) you want to edit and click the extract button on the bottom and pick a location, I would recommend a new folder on your desktop so you don't get files all mixed up and become confused.\n\nStep 2 - Convert Your New Audio File(s)\n\nWhen you have whichever song(s) you want to add into the game downloaded and ready, download and install Foobar2000 from the link above in the requirements section then open it. Once Foobar2000 is opened, drag your audio file(s) and drop them into the program, now right click the song(s) and select convert then click the \"...\" From here you should have a little window pop up called converter setup, make sure output format says Format: WAV, Destination says: Output To Source Track Folder/File Name Pattern: %title% (If it doesn't, click on the blue word destination then select that option), Processing says: None, and Other says: When finished: Transfer tags and attached pictures. Click convert, and your file(s) now will have a .WAV version in the same folder as the original song. This is absolutely required as WAV format is the only one the game will accept.\n\nStep 3 - Add Looping Points To Newly Converted Audio File(s)\n\nWavosaur from the link above in the requirements section. Select the 64 bit version. Open the program, and then click on the song you want to add and drag it into the program and drop it. If that confuses you, go to the top corner of the program where it says file, click it then select open and then find your song. Once selected, it will open a rectangular window in the program with an audio wavelength chart, you probably will want to full screen the program and then grab the bottom right corner of the audio wavelength graph and pull it all the way to the corner so it's as full screen as you can make it. If you left click somewhere on the audio wave and hold the left button without letting go, then move your hand around you'll be able to highlight a portion of the audio file. Do this and then press L on your keyboard and you'll create a start and end point for the audio to loop. Now you can grab the start and end points individually and move them around. Find the desired points you'd like, drag them there and then go to the top left corner, click file, then select save. Now your file has looping points. This is absolutely required as the game will not play any new audio if they do not have looping points.\n\nStep 4 - Replacing Game Audio File(s) With New Audio File(s)\n\nNow it's time to manually download the mod Sounds Of Ivalice: Audio Replacement Tool from the link above, and open it. You should see 4 buttons on the top: Clear Workspace, Add Sources, About, and Quit. Select Add Sources, then find and click on the audio files you extracted from the game earlier. (The ones displayed like this: musicXXX.win.mab) Once opened, it should appear on the left of the program, click on it and you'll now see 3 files on the right side. These are all the same song, but it's the 3 different versions present in TZA being: Original, Reorchestrated, and OST. The first of the 3 files is the one with the highest quality so it's recommended to replace that one, and it's also not recommended to replace all 3 files as each of your musicXXX.win.mab files will probably be about 60-80MB each if you do, which means editing even a quarter of the audio in the game would be like 1-2GB. Just do one of the 3 and the files will probably only be 15-35MB each. Now, how you actually do this is pretty simple, first when you see the 3 versions of the audio file you just selected on the right, select the top one then right click on it and you should see 3 options: Convert as WAV, Extract as HCA, Replace Track. Click on replace track, then a window will pop up, so find and click on the song you just converted and added looping points to that you want to replace this particular audio file with. If you're unsure which game file you want to replace you can use the list below for reference or right click on one and select extract as WAV then listen to it yourself to find out. Once you replace the audio file, after 2 or 3 seconds you'll hear a little windows ding sound, the same sound you would hear if you clicked somewhere and a little error happened, and this means it's been replaced. Its quiet though so you may not hear it, if you want to be sure then click somewhere else on the left of the program then reselect the music file, and on the right you will see the first version of that song is in bold letters instead of the small ones. When you're done with each file, make absolutely certain you're selecting the right file, then click the big patch button at the bottom. Now, you can place this file in your mod deploy folder directly or create a mod archive and install it with Vortex, but the file is now ready to use. Just make sure it's name is musicXXX.win.mab, the XXX is whatever number you're editing like how 060 is the necrohol of nabudis theme.\n\nStep 5 - Add To Mod Archive And Play Your Mod\n\nTo Add it to an archive, make sure you have Vortex installed. When installed, it should by default have the FFXII COmpatibility Patch built in but still make sure it's there. Then select games, search for Final Fantasy XII then click manage, after a moment you'll be prompted to download both the FFXII External File Loader and the FFXII External LUA Loader, but if you don't get that then click on these links and download and install them. Once that's all set up, find your song(s) that you just patched and then make a folder called ff12data, then add a folder inside it called ps2data, keep adding folders inside of folders in the exact order I'm about to list, and make certain it's spelled exactly the same as how I'm spelling it.\n\nff12data\\ps2data\\sound\\music\\magi_data\\win\n\nOnce you have that whole directory created, drop your patched audio files in the win folder there, then come out of it and right click on the ff12data folder. If you're using WinRar or 7Zip it won't really matter which, click on add to archive. Now open vortex and click on the mod tab on the left side, go back to your archive then drag the archive into vortex, and after a second click the button beside the mod to install it. Now if you open your game, the audio will have been replaced. If the audio isn't working at all and you hear absolutely no sound outside of effects like attacks and running, then make sure you have looping points in your file or that you're using the right file, or that you're playing the game with the correct audio option selected like Original, Reorchestrated, OST based on which of those versions you replaced in the previous step. If you did that and still nothing, I'm not too sure what the issue could be but myself or someone could help in the discord, though try the steps mentioned first since it could be a very simple mistake. There's a very slim chance it might also be the audio list below, I'm borrowing it from Ema but I haven't really went through most of it, I'll be doing that just to make extra certain the information is completely correct, but if that's the case, you can still find out which audio file is the one you want by doing what I stated earlier and right clicking in Sounds Of Ivalice and extracting as WAV so you can listen to it. Thanks for following the steps and hopefully you can add your music in your game with as few issues as possible. It's quite easy!\n\n//==========================================================================================\\\\\n\n\\\\==========================================================================================//\n\nI'm borrowing this table from Ema Colito, a fellow modder with his own overhaul mods. You can find him and his work here. I'll make sure when I go over this list to change all the names below to their official song names, and to confirm everything is exactly correct.\n\nmusic007.win.mab Game Over Screen Theme\n\nmusic015.win.mab Nalbina Fortress\n\nmusic016.win.mab Ogir-Yensa Sandsea Theme\n\nmusic017.win.mab Vayne\n\nmusic018.win.mab Mosphoran Highwaste Theme\n\nmusic019.win.mab Rabanastre Uptown\n\nmusic020.win.mab Giza Plains Theme\n\nmusic021.win.mab Golmore Jungle Theme\n\nmusic022.win.mab Lhusu Mines Theme\n\nmusic023.win.mab Judge Gabranth Theme\n\nmusic024.win.mab\n\nmusic025.win.mab\n\nmusic026.win.mab\n\nmusic027.win.mab Victory Fanfare Theme\n\nmusic028.win.mab\n\nmusic029.win.mab Barheim Passage Theme\n\nmusic030.win.mab Dawn Shard\n\nmusic031.win.mab\n\nmusic032.win.mab Penelo Theme\n\nmusic033.win.mab Demon Wall (Weak)\n\nmusic034.win.mab Nalbina (Reks)\n\nmusic035.win.mab Daguza\n\nmusic036.win.mab Boss Theme\n\nmusic037.win.mab Dalmasca Westersands Theme\n\nmusic038.win.mab\n\nmusic039.win.mab Mt.Bur-Omisace Theme\n\nmusic040.win.mab Aeroship (When You Fly)\n\nmusic041.win.mab Giruvegan Theme\n\nmusic042.win.mab Eruyt Village Theme\n\nmusic043.win.mab\n\nmusic044.win.mab Sky Fortress Bahamut Theme\n\nmusic045.win.mab Salikawood Theme\n\nmusic046.win.mab Stillshrine Of Miriam Theme\n\nmusic047.win.mab Pharos Of Ridorana: Second Ascent Theme\n\nmusic048.win.mab To Walk Amongst Gods\n\nmusic049.win.mab Zertian Caverns Theme\n\nmusic050.win.mab Ozmone Plains Theme\n\nmusic051.win.mab Ba'Gamnan / Demon Wall (Stronger)\n\nmusic052.win.mab Old Dalan (Before Garamsythe Waterway)\n\nmusic053.win.mab Nalbina Fortress\n\nmusic054.win.mab Bhujerba Theme\n\nmusic055.win.mab Garamsythe Waterway Theme\n\nmusic056.win.mab Cerobi Steppe Theme\n\nmusic057.win.mab Pharos Of Ridorana: First Ascent\n\nmusic058.win.mab Jahara Theme\n\nmusic059.win.mab Reks Death (Hospital Cutscene)\n\nmusic060.win.mab Necrohol Of Nabudis Theme\n\nmusic061.win.mab Draklor Laboratory Theme\n\nmusic062.win.mab Old Archades Theme\n\nmusic063.win.mab The Tomb Of Raithwall Theme\n\nmusic064.win.mab Rabanastre Downtown\n\nmusic065.win.mab Gabranth Tears (End Of Bahamut Event)\n\nmusic066.win.mab\n\nmusic067.win.mab Ashe Determination (Before Jahara)\n\nmusic068.win.mab Cutscene when the party arrives in bahamut.\n\nmusic069.win.mab Judge Ghis/Judge Bergan\n\nmusic070.win.mab Judge Gabranth\n\nmusic071.win.mab Battle With An Esper\n\nmusic072.win.mab\n\nmusic073.win.mab Nabreuse Deadlands Theme\n\nmusic074.win.mab\n\nmusic075.win.mab Paramina Rift Theme\n\nmusic076.win.mab Leviathan (With Vossler)\n\nmusic077.win.mab\n\nmusic078.win.mab After Vossler Battle/Gabranth Battle\n\nmusic079.win.mab\n\nmusic080.win.mab Penelo And Larsa\n\nmusic081.win.mab Meeting With Basch (Lowtown)\n\nmusic082.win.mab Henne Mines Theme\n\nmusic083.win.mab Desert Village / Phon Coast Village\n\nmusic084.win.mab Ashe Theme\n\nmusic085.win.mab Shadowseer\n\nmusic086.win.mab Clan Centurio Theme\n\nmusic087.win.mab Archades\n\nmusic088.win.mab Phon Coast\n\nmusic089.win.mab Feywood\n\nmusic090.win.mab Chocobo\n\nmusic091.win.mab The Esper\n\nmusic092.win.mab Sochen Cave Palace Theme\n\nmusic094.win.mab Normal Boss Theme (Flan)\n\nmusic095.win.mab music096.win.mab Final Boss Theme\n\nmusic097.win.mab Battle On The Big Bridge\n\nmusic098.win.mab\n\nmusic099.win.mab Balfonheim Port Theme\n\nmusic100.win.mab Dalmasca Estersand Theme\n\nmusic101.win.mab\n\nmusic102.win.mab\n\nmusic103.win.mab\n\nmusic104.win.mab Nabreuse\n\nmusic105.win.mab Basch Memories (Cutscenes Barheim Pasasge)\n\nmusic106.win.mab\n\nmusic107.win.mab\n\nmusic108.win.mab\n\nmusic109.win.mab\n\nmusic110.win.mab\n\nmusic111.win.mab\n\nmusic112.win.mab\n\nmusic113.win.mab Vaan VS.
