        "text": "3\n\nWelcome to an unofficial set of analytic spreadsheets focusing on specific musicians' contributions to Nihon Falcom's video games.\n\nFalcom has earned a decades-old reputation for supplying its game products with sound effects (SFX) and background music (BGM) appropriate in-game and well appreciated outside that context. Their musicians and collaborators, using increasingly complex means of production, have iterated upon their work and patched a house style together. In turn, Falcom BGM boasts distinctive and pliable melodies, befitting chord usage, unique arrangement of instruments and rhythm, and plenty of surprises. Fans of their music, such as us, thoroughly praise, criticize, and discuss a variety of topics. We like to scrutinize individual BGM tracks in a score and collect the public histories of Falcom employees and affiliates.\n\nThis sheet set's purpose is to determine who composed what. For various reasons unknown, speculated, or hinted at in primary sources, Falcom does not list specific BGM track credits for its musicians per album release, in-game credits, or any other source.\n\nSince the late-1980s, Falcom has credited all of its internal audio developers as \"Sound Team J.D.K.\" (or \"Sound Team jdk\" since 1995), which evenly distributes credit regardless of how much each person contributed to a game. This contrasts with how a majority of game publishers and developers give specific track credits and responsibilities to specific developers. For example, Yuzo Koshiro famously requested and received credit for his music used in early-1990s console games like Streets of Rage 2. Over time this level of recognition became increasingly common in this industry. However, some cases of relative non-credit remainâ€”either via a \"sound team\" representing developers' involvement and collaboration on a project, or listing of names without specific track credits.\n\nOur goal with the following sheets is to organize as accurate a history of Falcom music post-1989 as possible by guessing the origins of BGM tracks in each game. We trawl through album releases, unofficially-extracted game soundtracks (\"game rips\"), and musicians' non-Falcom works in order to learn much about their composition and arrangement styles. This way, we should understand the differences between artists and, thus, which music they likely did for each score.\n\nIf you have suggestions or feedback to offer about the project, be sure to discuss the project with us on r/Falcom, its Discord server or elsewhere.\n\n7\n\nOur means for speculating on track composers fall under two categories:\n\nA. Direct confirmation via in-game data or feedback from musicians via social media or related communication.\n\nWe link to these online sources within sheets and connect them to related track guesses. In recent years, Chinese fans unearthed BGM data tables from three Falcom releases: Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys (corresponding to tracks from Ys IV J.D.K. Special), VM Japan, and Nayuta no Kiseki. These datasets contain codes assigned to each track which indicate which composer wrote them. Because these games came out each in a different decade, that gives us enough of a foundation to begin the process in Section B.\n\nAside from these tables, contributors have solicited certain Falcom musicians for track confirmations, such as Atsushi Shirakawa and Ryo Takeshita. This method is generally less reliable than BGM tables because Shirakawa, Takeshita, and others have to recall which tracks they did after a considerable gap of time. Because of this, at least one former musician (Naoki Kaneda) has declined to offer track confirmations due to fears of misrepresenting their work (and others' work) at Falcom.\n\nB. Speculative guesses of composer identity per track/game, based on process of elimination after analyzing musicians' identifiable composition and arrangement styles.\n\nThis approach accounts for the variety between contributors' guess tables. Inevitably, Falcom's attempts to enforce a house style on their games' soundtracks make it difficult to figure out who did which track.\n\nFor example, a track like \"The Merciless Savior\" from Sora no Kiseki SC shares enough stylistic elements in common with musicians who worked on that game to make it futile to guess, with any confidence, who made it alone or in collaboration. Our remaining option is to determine who likely didn't compose/arrange a track. We then narrow the options until it's more practical to analyze remaining candidate musicians and make track guesses. When possible, listening to non-Falcom works by musicians can reveal a lot more about their musical styles and evolution, all of which helps clarify ambiguities.\n\nPlease keep in mind that, while our goal is to determine who composed which tracks, Falcom musicians share virtual instruments, musical ideas, and arrangement techniques between each other across projects. This can aid or hinder process of elimination. It's roughly as easy to mistake one musician's track for another based on commonalities as it is to accurately separate certain tracks from others and determine their composers based on similar arrangement style. In games where outside musicians, like Yukihiro Jindo, apply their touch to Sound Team jdk compositions, this method loses some utility depending on how severely the arrangers modify the originals.\n\nGiven all of the above, we cannot guarantee that our guesses and theories about Falcom music are fully accurate or precise.\n\nOne concern is the possibility of biased and/or self-fulfilling analysis and track speculation. Constantly relistening to musicians' works, in turn re-examining our assumptions and foundational knowledge of Falcom-related music, should mitigate the potential of bias in these sheets. We're definitely aware that our collaboration here constitutes a fluid history which Falcom and/or related musicians may or may not invalidate at a later point. Our goal remains to stimulate appreciation of Falcom music and thoughts about its evolution, and there's every good reason for others to challenge our speculation.\n\nUpdate (2019-12-01) -- Massive leak with 15 years worth of Sound Team jdk data by an unknown Japanese atwiki contributor, including all the music credits of FC/SC/the 3rd, Zero/Ao, Sen I/II/III, Nayuta, Tokyo Xanadu and Ys VI/Origin/Seven/Celceta/VIII, with even detailed notes of the original composer/arranger and music codes. The leaked credits look highly credible and a lot of these are very internally consistent."
