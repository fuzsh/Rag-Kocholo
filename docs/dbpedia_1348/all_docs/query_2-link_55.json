Once you gain access to Tifa's bar, Seventh Heaven, in Chapter 3, you'll be able to grab Tifa's Theme from the jukebox in the right-hand corner of the bar.\n\nMusic Disc 2 - Hip Hop De Chocobo (27)\n\nLocation: Sector 7 Slums Residential Area\n\nBefore entering Seventh Heaven, there's a passageway to the right that you can. Follow it until you hear those soothing, jazzy tunes of Hip Hop De Chocobo. You'll see a man standing next to a radio, talk to him to receive this tune for yourself.\n\nMusic Disc 3 - The Prelude (01)\n\nLocation: Sector 7 Slums Item Shop\n\nFollow the main quest and you and Tifa will eventually come to the item shop. After a few moments of beating your chest at one another for Tifa's affection, you'll eventually be able to talk to the man and buy 'The Prelude' from his store.\n\nMusic Disc 4 - Barret's Theme (04)\n\nLocation: Sector 7 Undercity Station Item Shop\n\nOnce you've unlocked the Side Quest section of Chapter 3, you'll be able to head back towards the Undercity Train Station in Sector 7. Once you get there, you should be able to hear Barret's Theme blaring in the background.\n\nGo to the Item Shop to add it to your collection for just 50 gil -- a bargain!\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Chapter 5 Music Disc locations\n\nThere is one Music Disc to find in this chapter:\n\nMusic Disc 5 - Stamp (28)\n\nLocation: Corkscrew Tunnel Section E\n\nOnce you've defeated a few nasty enemies in Section E, you should see a few narrow corridors heading off in different directions. Check the one that leads you to a small box room, and you'll hear the rather catchy Stamp theme tune.\n\nPurchase it from the Potions and Music vending machine.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Chapter 6 Music Disc locations\n\nThere is one Music Disc to find in this chapter:\n\nMusic Disc 6 - Electric De Chocobo (18)\n\nLocation: Sector 4 / Plate Upper Level\n\nThis one can be easy to miss, especially if you're rushing through. During the main questline, you'll be asked to turn off 3 Sun Lamps in order to power up an elevator.\n\nOnce that's done, head back to the elevator, but don't go down it just yet. Instead, turn to your right and you'll encounter another elevator.\n\nUse that and you'll be transported to another area with a ladder. Climb that ladder and in the first room you come across, you'll discover a Potions and Music vending machine.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Chapter 7 Music Disc locations\n\nThere is one Music Disc to find in this chapter:\n\nMusic Disc 7 - Bombing Mission (02)\n\nLocation: Mako Reactor 5 (Gate Office)\n\nAfter you've been through one of the most annoying sequences in the world, aka a scene where Tifa, Cloud and Barrett have to push levers down at the same time, you'll unlock a door. Go through and you'll find the Potions and Music vending machine in a corner.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Chapter 8 Music Disc locations\n\nThere are four Music Discs to find in this chapter:\n\nMusic Disc 8 - Cait Sith's Theme (21)\n\nLocation: Sector 5 Undercity Station\n\nOnce you reach the Sector 5 train station, you'll come across a Potions and Music vending machine. It's there you'll be able to purchase the Cait Sith Theme before carrying on with the main quest.\n\nMusic Disc 9 - Tango of Tears (25)\n\nLocation: Leaf House Community Home\n\nDuring the main quest, you'll come across an orphanage on the right. To the left is another building that's full of old people, alongside a jukebox. Head on over there and you'll claim the Tango of Tears music disc.\n\nMusic Disc 10 - Costa Del Sol (19)\n\nLocation: Sector 5 Slums Materia Shop\n\nHead to the Sector 5 Slums and you'll come across a Materia shop. Head on over and you'll be able to pick up the hottest Sector 5 tune: Costa Del Sol.\n\nMusic Disc 11 - Gold Saucer (20)\n\nLocation: Sector 5 Children's Secret Hideout\n\nWe hope you've been saving up on Moogle medals, because you'll need 5 of them to purchase the Gold Saucer music disc from the Moogle shop.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Chapter 9 Music Disc locations\n\nThere are seven Music Discs to find in this chapter:\n\nMusic Disc 12 - Cosmo Canyon (22)\n\nLocation: Collapsed Expressway / Large Cave-In\n\nAfter the minigame where you lift Aerith with a mechanical arm, you'll come across a ladder leading down and a pathway going up.\n\nIgnore the ladder for now and go up the path, where a Potion and Music vending machine lies in wait for you.\n\nMusic Disc 13 - Honeybee Inn (10)\n\nLocation: Wall Market Item Shop\n\nOnce you enter Wall Market, you'll come across an Item Shop near the centre. You'll be able to purchase the Honeybee Inn music disc from there.\n\nMusic Disc 14 - Honeybee Inn (17)\n\nLocation: Wall Market Sector 6 Slums\n\nFrom the entrance of Wall Market, keep going straight until you spot Chadley. Once you find him, keep going straight up the first set of stairs you see, or follow the sound of music if that's easier.\n\nOnce up there, there will be a girl who looks like she mains McCree from Overwatch if that Stetson on her head is anything to go by.\n\nTalk to her and she'll give you the Farm Boy music disc.\n\nMusic Disc 15 - Under the Rotting Pizza (08)\n\nLocation: Wall Market Sector 6 Slums\n\nFrom the entrance of Wall Market, you'll spot a narrow passageway to the left of you. Go down it and to your right you should see a jukebox. Head on over to it to receive the Under the Rotting Pizza disc.\n\nMusic Disc 16 - The Midgar Blues (29)\n\nLocation: Wall Market Sector 6 Slums\n\nAs you continue throughout the main quest, you'll eventually get a sidequest that tells you to go to the gym.\n\nAcross the gym is a restaurant where you'll see a karaoke singer crooning this sweet, sweet song - the Midgar Blues.
