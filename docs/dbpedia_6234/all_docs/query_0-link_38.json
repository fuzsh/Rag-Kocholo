The market share is converted into a weekly sales estimate based on industry reports on the overall size of the market, including reports published in Media Play News.\n\nFor example, if our weekly retail survey estimates that a particular title sold 1% of all units that week, and the industry reports sales of 1,500,000 units in total, we will estimate 15,000 units were sold of that title. The consumer spending estimate is based on the average sales price for the title in the retailers we survey.\n\nWe refine our estimates from week to week as more data becomes available. In particular, we adjust weekly sales figures for the quarter once the total market estimates are published by the Digital Entertainment Group. Figures will therefore fluctuate each week, and totals for individual titles can go up or down as we update our estimates.\n\nBecause sales figures are estimated based on sampling, they will be more accurate for higher-selling titles.\n\nDVD Sales: Paddington Pads Its Lead\n\nMay 27th, 2015\n\nThe top of the DVD sales chart were dominated by new releases with four of the top five DVDs new to the charts. This includes Paddington, which took top spot with 216,000 units / $3.24 million. More...\n\nBlu-ray Sales: Paddington Leads Parade of New Releases\n\nMay 27th, 2015\n\nNew releases took the top three spots on the Blu-ray sales chart, led by Paddington. The film sold 168,000 units and generated $3.35 million in sales. Its opening week Blu-ray share was 44%, which is amazing for a live action family film. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for April 28th, 2015\n\nApril 28th, 2015\n\nThis is usually a terrible time of year on the home market with the dredges of January and February coming out and precious little else. However, this week is actually really strong with not only one of the best films of the year, Paddington, as well as a number of summer shows coming out on TV on DVD. Unfortunately, it is also a really shallow week and with the May monthly preview due on Friday, I'm not even going to pretend it's a deep week and I'm ignoring anything below second-tier releases. As far as Pick of the Week is concerned, there are really only two contenders. The first is the aforementioned Paddington DVD or Blu-ray Combo Pack. The second is Mommy a Canadian movie coming out on DVD this week. Paddington is the Pick of the Week, but Mommy earns the rarely awarded Puck of the Week.

More impressive, The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death earned fourth place with $15.03 million, which is significantly more than what most people were predicting. The overall box office was $155 million, which is 2% lower than last weekend. More importantly, it is 10% higher than the same weekend last year. Obviously it is far, far too early to judge 2015, but after what happened last year, I'll take any win and I'll be happy about it. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Close Battle over Christmas Break\n\nDecember 30th, 2014\n\nWe are still dealing with studio estimates for the weekend numbers, but we can at least tell you what film won, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, and roughly how much it earned, $41.42 million. The new releases were much closer than expected with Into the Woods and Unbroken both earning just over $30 million over the weekend. Because we don't have enough final numbers, we really can't compare the overall box office to last weekend or last year. So far, the final weekend of 2014 pulled in $200 million and that number should grow a little bit as box office numbers filter in. This is 52% more than last weekend and 2.3% more than the same weekend last year. I'm a little more bullish about January's box office chances after this result. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Christmas Wishes for Woods and Unbroken\n\nDecember 23rd, 2014\n\nWe have a short prediction column today detailing the three Christmas day wide releases, as well as the two bigger limited releases. Sadly, none of these five films are really living up to potential and Christmas Day could be rather weak at the box office. Then again, why should Christmas be any different than the past several months. 2014 got off to such a great start. Last Christmas was busier, but not particularly strong either, so at least 2014 won't lose too badly. More..."
