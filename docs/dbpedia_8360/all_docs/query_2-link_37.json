The idea of setting up an organization in the name of Maharan Khumbha a rare among the rarest kings of Mewar who a great ruler and warrior was not only but also a great musician himself, came up in 1962. Maharana Kumbha wrote Sangeetraj an authentic and original treatise consisting of 16,000 Sanskrit ‘Sholks’ dealing with all the three ‘Vidhas’ of Indian classical music. This earned him the title of ‘Vogeykar’ that means one who writes poems and composes music. This great work lay dormant for over 500 years before it was discovered due to light by the research done on it by Premlata Sharma, a disciple of Thakur.\n\nThe motivation came from Pandit Omkarnath Thakur, a legend in the world of music.\n\nThe first Sangeet Sammelan was inaugurated with a recital by this great maestro.
