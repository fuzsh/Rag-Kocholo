        "text": "Chapter XLIV\n\nNandi Brahmin relieved of Leprosy: He became a Poet\n\nNandi was a Brahmin suffering from Leprosy. He worshipped Tuljapur Bhavani for 3 years. He observed fast. He stayed near Bhuvaneshwari at Bhilavadi for 7 months and worshipped the deity devotedly. He was told in a dream to go to Shri Guru at Gangapur and that he would then be relieved of the disease.\n\nNandi said, 'You are Goddess yourself, how do you ask me to go to a human being. I shall be here, no matter if I have to lose my life.'\n\nThe Pujari also had similar dream. He and some others told Nandi, 'Do not trouble the Goddess hereafter and if you do not mind, we shall not allow you enter this Mandir.'\n\nBeing helpless he came to Gangapur and went to the Math and bowed to Shri Guru. Shri Guru asked him 'Leaving the Goddess, why did you come to a human being? When you doubt, how can you be relieved of the disease?'\n\nRealizing that Shri Guru knew what was in his mind, he said, 'I am a dullard. Kindly forgive me. I have come for your shelter. Kindly protect me. I am very much harassed due to this disease. My wife also left me and went to her parents. Chandla Devi has sent me to you. Kindly do not drive me away.'\n\nShri Guru asked Somanath to take Nandi to the Sangam and said, \"Let him bathe at the Shatkul and have rounds of the Ashwattha. Give him new clothes, throwing away his old ones and then bring him here for meals.\"\n\nAs advised by Shri Guru, Somanath took Nandi to the Sangam for bath. After bath his body became free from leprosy. After taking rounds of the Ashwattha, Somanath brought him back to the Math. Nandi bowed to Shri Guru and began to pray Him.\n\nShri Guru asked him, 'See if all your body has been free from the disease. He looked to his body and found that some patches had remained on his thigh. Being afraid he asked 'After having your blessings why these patches should be here?'\n\nShri Guru said, 'You came with a suspicion that what a man could do and so a little disease is there. You should stay here praying God, the little disease that is there will also be wiped off soon.'\n\nNandi said, 'I am illiterate. How can I compose poems of praise?'\n\nShri Guru asked him to draw out his tongue. When he did so, Shri Guru put little bhasma on the tip of his tongue.\n\nInstantly he became wise. He bowed to Shri Guru and began to compose poems in praise of Shri Guru. The summary of those poems is as follows: -\n\n'I was sinking in the worldly ocean, being deluded by the affection for my family members. I was roaming through different species as swedaj, Andaj, Udbhija and Jaraj i.e. animal life. Human life is the best of all. I had no knowledge in the Shudra birth. The birth of a Brahmin is the best amongst the human beings. But if a Brahmin is also a dullard, how can he have knowledge of Shri Guru?\n\nThe blood of the mother and the semen of the father unite and a fetus comes into existence as a bubble. After 15 days it becomes liquid. Within a month a small solid fetus is formed. I the second month the head and the limbs take shape. When the five great elements i.e. the earth, the water, the luster, the wind and the sky unite, the soul enters the fetus. In the fifth month the skin and the hair are formed. In the sixth month the fetus starts respiration. In the seventh month, the ear, the tongue, the brain and the marrow become solid. In this way I was growing in the mother's uterus. The mother would eat hot, salt, sour, pungent and acidic articles, due to which I was greatly troubled.\n\nI then took birth. My span of life was fixed. Half of the time i.e. the nights were spent in sleep in vain. The remaining half is divided in the three stages, childhood, youth and old age. In the childhood, I had to suffer much. I wept due to pain in the stomach, but my mother thought that I was hungry and took me to her breast. And when I was hungry, she thought I was ailing and gave me bitter medicines. At times due to scorpion bite, in the cradle I would cry. She would then sing lullabies and move the cradle to and fro and tried to lure me to sleep or she would think that I am affected by some spirit and so the tried Mantra - Tantra and tied a black string on my wrist. My mother would take pungent and sour articles and I had to suffer from diarrhea, cough etc.\n\nIn the youth, I was influenced by passion. I disregarded the parents and the guru and always thought about the female-sex. Due to vanity, I despised Sadhus, saints and old persons. How could have I adored Shri Guru during this period?\n\nIn the old age cough, gases and other troubles affected me. My hair became white while taking care of my family and children. I lost my teeth, I could not hear well and see properly. Even in this state I did not serve Shri Guru. You are the protector and liberator of the universe. Please liberate me.'\n\nIlliterate Nandi composed such poems. All wondered to see his feat Nandi further said, 'Vedas say that the feet of Shri Guru are holy there is no other way than the feet of Shri Guru, to be free from the worldly sea. By the favor of Shri Guru, all my sins are wiped off. Shri Guru Narasimha Saraswati is like Kamadhenu. So people should adore him and get liberated.\n\nNandi was later called 'Kavishwar' due to his poetry. The patches of leprosy on his thigh also disappeared in course of time. Nandi greatly rejoiced at the cure. He began to serve Shri Guru with more devotion.\n\nChapter XLV\n\nPoet Narahari Becomes a Disciple of Shri Guru\n\nOnce some disciples took Shri Guru to their town Hipperge. This is a holy place of Kalleshwar. A Brahmin Narahari lived there. He was a great devotee of God Kalleshwar. He daily composed five new stanzas in praise of Kalleshwar and worshiped him devotedly.\n\nPeople told him the greatness of Shri Guru and requested him to compose poems in his praise. But Narahari said, 'I have sold my tongue to Kalleshwar and I shall not compose poems in praise of a human being'. As usual he went to the temple to worship Kalleshwar. While worshipping, he had a nap and he got asleep. He saw a dream that Shri Guru was sitting on the Shiva Linga and that he was worshiping Shri Guru. Later the Linga disappeared and Shri Guru only was seen. Shri Guru smiled and asked him 'You do not believe in a human being and then why are you worshiping me?'.\n\nNarahari awoke and wondered about the dream. He repented for underestimating Shri Guru Narasimha Saraswati, who was all incarnation of Shri Shiva.\n\nImmediately he went to see Shri Guru, bowed to him and said, 'Kindly forgive me. Without knowing your greatness I underestimated you, but now I know that you are Kalleshwar himself. When Kamadhenu is at home, why should one be anxious? Kindly let me have your blessings. I wish to serve you hereafter.' Saying this he began to praise Him.\n\nShri Guru was pleased. He gave clothes to Narahari and accepted him as his disciple. Shri Guru said to him, 'Kalleshwar is great. You continue to worship him. Narahari said, 'When you yourself are Kalleshwar, why should I worship other Kalleshwar? I shall not go away leaving thy feet now.' In this way, Narahari poet also became a great devotee of Shri Guru.'\n\nChapter XLVI\n\nShri Guru Visits Eight Places at One Time\n\nAt the time of Diwali festival, seven devotes of Shri Guru came to Ganagapur Math and requested Shri Guru to come to their places for Diwali. As Shri Guru loved them all alike, it was a problem before him as to whose invitation should be accepted Shri Guru said to them, 'You are all from different places. How can I come to your homes at the same time? You decide among yourselves as to where I should go first and where I should go later.'\n\nEach devotee wished that Shri Guru should come to him first. So they could not decide and began to quarrel, Shri Guru called the devotees one by one and told each of them 'I shall come only to one house. So don't argue unnecessarily.'\n\nThen the devotees said, 'Oh Guru, do not make any distinction between the rich and the poor. Please treat us equally. If you neglect us we shall end our lives, we serve you and we do whatever you say.\"' With these words they all prostrated themselves before him humbly.\n\nThereupon Sri Guru said, 'All right, I shall visit you all. Rest assured about that.'\n\nOne of the disciples asked him, 'How can we be sure that you will visit the homes of all of us?\n\nThen Sri Guru called each of them separately and said, 'I will come to your house, but do not tell others.\"\n\nAll the seven devotees thereafter went back to their respective places, pleased.\n\nWhen the devotees of Ganagapur knew this, they requested Shri Guru; 'You should not go out of Ganagapur for Diwali.' Shri Guru promised them also that he would be there, and that they need not worry.\n\nIn the morning of Narak Chaturdashi day, Shri Guru took eight forms and went to 7 places of 7 devotees and also stayed at Ganagapur Math. He accepted Puja in all the places.\n\nLater the devotees gathered at Ganagapur for Deeparadhan on the Kartik Poornima. Each one told that Shri Guru had been to him in Diwali and showed the cloth presented to him by Shri Guru. The people of Ganagapur said, 'Shri Guru was here in the Math during Diwali.' But on seeing the articles presented by Shri Guru all realized that Shri Guru had taken 8 forms in Diwali and they all were amazed. The conviction that Shri Guru is the incarnation of Trimurties became more firm and they adored him with greater devotion. He who worships Sri Guru will have all is desires fulfilled. All try to experience the value of Guru Bhakti, but fools cannot appreciate Amrit. Only Jnanis and devotees can relish the Amrit of Guru Nama.\n\nThe Vedas and Shastras proclaim that he who looks down upon Guru as an ordinary human being will be born an animal. Sri Guru Charitra is equal to Veda-Shasta. Only Guru can liberate one from the throes of Samskara.\n\nThose who go to Ganagapur and serve Guru with devotion will surely get all their desires fulfilled. So listen, all of you purify your mind and visit Ganagapur.\n\nChapter XLVII\n\nParbati had Bumper Crops even in Scarcity\n\nThere lived pious farmer, named Parbati, in Ganagapur. He used to bow to Shri Guru when he went to Sangam in the morning an again at midday when Shri Guru returned. His field was on the way to the Sangam. Once Shri Guru asked him, \"Why do you take this trouble daily? What is your desire?\"\n\nParbati said, \"I wish that my field yields a good crop\".\n\nShri Guru, \"what have you sown?\"\n\nParbati said that jawar was sown in his field. He further added, \"It is due to your favor that this year the corp is good. I wish that you should kindly come to my field and have a look at the crop by your sight which showers nectar.'\n\nShri Guru went to the field, looked at the crop and said, 'If you have faith in me, do as I bid you.'\n\nParbati said, 'I shall obey you from the bottom of my heart'.\n\nShri Guru - 'Till I return at midday, cut off this crop'. Saying so, Shri Guru went to the Sangam.\n\nParbati approached the Revenue Officer and asked him to permit him to reap the crop on the rent as per the previous year.\n\nThe Officer said, `This year the crop is good, hence the old rent will not suffice'.\n\nParbati said, `I shall pay double the rent. So please give me permission'. The Officer agreed and granted the permission.\n\nParbati took some men with him, went to the field and reaped the crop. His wife and children tried to prohibit him; but he did not listen to them. The wife complained to the Officer, `The crop is good this year; but before the harvest, my husband is reaping the field on the advice of a Sanyasi and is depriving us of food. Kindly prohibit him to cut the crop'.\n\nThe Officer sent his men to ask Parbati why he was reaping the field before the harvest. Parbati said, `If the Officer has doubt of getting the rent; I shall pay the corn from reserve and keep my cattle at his door'.\n\nParbati reaped all the crop. Seeing that Shri Guru was returning from the Sangam, he bowed to Him and reported that he had cut the crop as instructed.\n\nShri Guru `You have reaped in vain!'\n\nParbati `I have read the crop as advised by you. I have full faith in you.'\n\nShri Guru `You will have the fruit of your devotion, the wife and children of Parbati said that they have lost their food. Parbati consoled them by saving, `Shri Guru is Shri Shiva incarnate. With his blessing,We shall have no loss. He told us to do this due to some unforeseen reason.'\n\nIn about a week, there was a severe code and all the crops in the country were lost. Then on Mul Nakshatra, there was heavy rain, which was also harmful to the crops; but Parbati's field yielded hundred times more crop of good quality. All wondered to see this.\n\nThe wife and children of Parbati also rejoiced. They begged apology of Parbati and repented for underestimating Shri Guru. The mention of all the above facts is made here in order to show the affinity of Shri Sai Baba to Shri Vithal of Pandharpur. One Sai Mandir at Phanaswadi, in the Girgaum area of the Bombay city, was formerly a temple of Vithal and it was known as \"Shri Premal Vithal Mandir\". In this temple the idols of Vithal and Rakhumai were installed by Shri Gajanan Vinayak Pradhan, as the temple itself was constructed my him as his own private property. However, Shri Vasant Shastri alias Aba Panshikar completely changed the Mandir and gave it the present form. One Shri Prabhakar Panshikar, is a famous actor on the Marathi stage and Shri Aba Panshikar is his brother. Shri Aba Panshikar was performing Keertans in the Vithal Mandir regularly. Shri Bhole Guruji, who is a Sai devotee, used to attend Shri Panshikar's keertans as he was staying very near the above Mandir, in the Mugbhat area Girgaum. Shri Bhole Guruji requested Shri Panshikar to start praying to Shri Sai Baba. Shri Panshikar was not aware of greatness of the saint of Shirdi up to that time and on being initiated by Shri Bhole Guruji, he gladly became a devotee of Shri Sai Baba. He very soon became a staunch and sincere devotee of Sri Baba and very soon thought of changing the Vithal Mandir into a Sai temple. It is because of the zeal and efforts of Shri Aba Panshikar that the Premal Vithal Mandir is now converted into a Sai Mandir and is now known by that name.\n\nIn this temple, we see the idol of Shri Sai Baba in plaster, which is about four and a half feet high. This idol is seated on an altar. It will be seen from the photograph of the temple published along with this article that the original idols of Shri Vithal and Rakhumai installed in the temple have still be retained in the temple as Shri Sai Baba had reverence for that god as stated at the beginning of this article. The beautiful idol of Shri Sai Baba in plaster was made by one sculptor Shri G.V. Patkar. Though the temple was originally constructed as a private temple, still it was later on thrown open to everyone for worship and at present anybody can go and offer flowers or garlands to Shri Sai Baba or Shri Vithal - Rakhumai.\n\nIn the rear side of this temple, there is a banyan tree about hundred years old. Around this tree we can also find the idols of Shri Datta, Hanuman and Pindi of Shri Shankar. In addition to that, there are the Padukas of Shri Sai Baba in silver in this area. These Padukas were installed at the October 1952.\n\nThe practice of getting prepared the silver Padukas of Shri Sai Baba and give them to different people or institutions dedicated to Sai worship, was started by this temple. So far, the Sai Padukas got prepared by this Mandir have been installed at five different places. It may be noted here that the Padukas installed at the Sai temple of Smt. Ajibai Wanarse at London, were got prepared by this Mandir.\n\n\"Service to humanity and Service to the dump mutes is the service to God\" this was the motto of Shri Sai Baba and the management of this temple has borne in mind this fact. They have therefore coupled a social duty with this religious institution. On the first floor of this temple, arrangements have been made for the free accommodation of poor and deserving students, Who have no arrangements to stay in Bombay. A great number of students have taken advantage of this facility and because of the religious atmosphere of the temple; these students are grooved in Sai devotion from the young age of their life.\n\nAarti, worship etc. are carried out at this temple every day as per those performed at Shirdi. Ramnavami, Gurupournima and Vijayadashami are the great festivals observed at this temple on the same lines as is done at Shirdi. This temple has started one more practice. On every Shivaratri day, the offering of fruits is made to Shri Baba and they are later on distributed to the devotees by way of prasad. Shri Pandurang Mahadev Warang is a staunch Sai devotee, who manages the daily affairs of the temple with great care. He is only thirty-one years of age at present, but for the last twenty-two years he is staying in the temple premises and is attending to the work of this temple. The management wants to expand the activities of the temple and arrange some further programs on a large scale; but due tot shortage of space they feel sorry that it is not possible for them. Shri Warang always says that all his difficulties are readily solved by Shri Sai Baba. This shows his great faith in Shri Sai Baba and his devotion to Him.\n\nGirgaum is a very crowded locality of Bombay city. They area round about Lalbaug and Parel which is known as the \"Mill area\" is perhaps another equally crowded area in Bombay. The people in the \"Mill area\" are so very busy in their struggle for existence that they have hardly any time to think about god or existence. The people in the Girgaum area are mostly white-collar people. They have regular hours of their office work. Similarly religious practices are imbibed in them from their childhood. Hence they find the need of a place for worship where they can get mental peace. The people who were formerly they devotees of Vithal have started visiting this temple for the worship of that god; but after seeing the idol of Shri Sai Baba in the temple and having come to know. His greatness, they automatically become His devotees. Thus this temple has a good place of worship for the devotees staying in Girgaum area of the Bombay city and is therefore frequented by a number of devotees every day.\n\nNamdharak bowed to Shri Siddhamuni with folded hands and said, \"gurudeo, you have narrated to me the life of Shri Guru and have given me the real gnyan(knowledge) which has wiped off my karma and by your blessing, I have known the essence of religion. Devotion to Shri Guru is like the Kalpataru and Rishis like Vashishta and Shuka also follow this path. Now kindly tell me the path of Sadguru.\"\n\nBeing pleased with the question, Shri Siddha said, \"Namdharak, you are very fortunate as you as you have asked question regarding the eternal principles, knowing with illusion and ignorance are wiped off and the mind becomes becomes as clear as the light of the sun.\n\nOnce when Shri Shankar was sitting on a beautiful point of Kailas, Devi Parvati with folded hands said to him with devotion, \"Great God of Gods, Guru of the universe, give me Gurumantra and kindly tell me the means by which one's soul becomes united with Brahma\".\n\nShri Shankar said, \"Dear Devi, this is a question which has never been asked to me so far by anybody. You are my second form. So I shall tell you this gist and this will benefit all the people also\".\n\nVeda, Shastra, Purana, Ithihas, Mantra-tantravidya, Smriti-jaran-maran(using the power of doing miracles by the devotees of Shiva and Shakti) and other various sciences put one in illusion. Without knowing the gist of devotion to Guru, people perform sacrifices, observe penance, vrat, charity, recitation and go to the holy places but only after the rise of the light of Shri Guru, difficult vidya, worldly illusion and ignorance are all wiped off. By serving Shri Guru, all sins perish and the soul becomes pure and united with Brahma.\n\nTaking the holy water, touched by the lotus like feet of Shri Guru, is like a bath at a holy place. This Tirth is as holy as Kashi or Prayag.\n\nAlways remember Shri Guru. Recite Shri Guru's name all the time. Obey his orders, serve and worship Shri Guru with devotion. Doing this, one can even attain my position.\n\nThe alphabet 'Gu' means darkness and 'Ru' means light. Guru means the knowledge of the light of Brahma, that destroys darkness of ignorance. 'Gu1 is the first alphabet to create illusion and other attributes. 'Ru' is the second alphabet of Brahma which destroys illusion and vain appearance. This power of Guru is supreme and is difficult even for the Gods to obtain.\n\nA Sadhak (disciple) should offer to Shri Guru good seat, bed, clothes, ornaments, conveyances etc. He should serve him with devotion for getting one's position, ashram, caste and pray him with body, senses, money, son, wife, etc. clearly and should not be ashamed to lay prostrate before him.\n\nMen go to hell by living in family life as one's body is full of worms, night-soil, urine, phelgm, slood, flesh and bad odor. Bow lo Shri Guru, who liberates a person from the worldly miseries.\n\nShri Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha and Para-Brahma. He is the cause of the creation of Universe, liberator of persons from this worldly sea and giver of the knowledge of all the vidyas.\n\nBy applying the ointment of Shri Guru's knowledge to one's eyes, closed eyes are opened, parents, brothers, and good men who give real knowledge of worldly life, are all Gurus. Though there is diversity in the universe, yet there is oneness. Shri Guru protects one from all difficulties, showing the cause and effect.\n\nIf Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu are enraged, Shri Guru protects the devotees, but when Shri Guru himself is enraged, even Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu cannot protect them.\n\nJust as the blind man cannot see the light of the Sun, so the dull persons do not see the nectar-like appearance of Shri Guru, which is visible only to the eyes of the thoughtful. Shri Guru is like a monarch, who is witnessing the drama of creation and destruction of the universe.\n\nThree Nath, Ganesh, 3 Bhairava Peethas, Siddha, 3 Batus, 2 Pad, 3 Dooties, Shri Shankar, 4, 6, 8, 9 Veeresh, 5 Veeravalies are all associated with the best 'Shri Malini' mantra. Bow to this Shri Guru mandal.\n\nTo think about Shri Guru's body is like thinking about everlasting Shri Shiva and to recite Shri Guru’s name to praise to eternal Shiva's qualities.\n\nShri Guru is birthless, devoid of oldage and has no begining. He is self created, devoid of change, full of bright bliss, minutest of the minute, greatest of the great and eternal. He is self shining, spotless, sky pervading, everlasting and has no decrease. Vedas and Manu describe Shri Guru's penance in this way. Therefore always remember Shri Guru.\n\nBy the knowledge of self, which is pervading all the universe, moveable and immovoable, sins of several births are atoned. There are no greater principle than the knowledge of self. There is no greater penance than the service of Shri Guru and there is no deeper knowledge than the advice of Shri Guru.\n\nShri Guru is Jagannath (lord of the universe) and the Guru of the 3 Lokas. Shri Guru is the universe and our soul is the soul of all the creation. Bow lo Shri Guru, who gives this knowledge.\n\nThe persons, who are proud of penance and knowledge and who are engrossed in the worldly affairs, are like the pots moving on the wheel of a pot-maker. Gods, Gandharvas, fore fathers, yaksh, kinnar, rishi, siddha, who do not serve Shri Guru do not get salvation.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is supreme joy and who gives the best pleasure. He is shrine of knowledge, above division, sky pervading, knower of Tattwam Asi' (that thou art) principle, only one, External, pure, immoveable, who witnesses everything and who is devoid of existence and three qualities(Satwa Raj and Tam).\n\nTo know one's self is the supreme knowledge and the utmost goal of life. This is attained only by the favour of Shri Guru.\n\nRemember Shri Guru till death. Even if he is fickle minded, do not forget or forsake him. The wise should not speak about Shri Guru with disrespect. Do not tell a lie before him.\n\nThose who despise Shri Guru go to hell. Those who discuss vainly with Shri Guru become Brahma Rakshas and have to live in barren and waterless places.\n\nOh Parvati, Shri Guru protects his disciples, even if god, muni or pannag curses. Gods and munies are weak before Shri Guru, whose curses can destroy them in no time.\n\nO Devi, according to Smrities and Vedas, Shri Guru is Parabrahma. Guru is a mantra of two syllables.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is pervading all the universe from Brahma to grass, who is eternal, whole, formless, devoid of qualities, engrossed in self-knowledge, above divisions and full of real bright-joy (sat-chit-anand rup).\n\nBrahma is eternal like fragrance in camphor and flowers and like the coolness and warmth in an object. This knowledge can be got only through Shri Guru. So worship and serve him with pure and dear heart and singular devotion. One, who is united with Brahma in meditation, realises Kundalini, Brahma Randhra and formlessness and gels salvation without doubt.\n\nThe ignorant wins over the worldly sea and the wise besides gets knowledge of actions and no-actions by following the path of Shri Guru.\n\nThose, who read, hear or write Shri Guru Geeta and give it in charity with money, all their desires are fullfilled. Always read Sri Guru-Geeta to get rid of the miseries of the wordly life.\n\nEach and every syllable of Guru-Geeta enables to win death, remove all difficulties and fear of yaksha, Rakshas, ghosts, thieves, tigers and diseases. It gives the power of using Bhasma, mesmerism and hypnotism.\n\nO Devi, read Shri Guru-Geeta, sitting on a site of kush grass (dharbhasan) or white blanket with attentive mind. Use a white seat for peace, red for mesmerising, black for punishing the evildoers and yellow for getting wealth. For peace, sit facing the north, for mesmerising facing the east, for punishing the evildoers facing the south and for wealth facing the west.\n\nRecitation of Guru-Geeta, gives one incentive power, develops one's qualities, destroys evil acts, makes good acts successful, removes fear of Gra has (planets), destroys evil dreams, gives issues even to sterile women, gives goodluck to the married women (keep their husbands alive all their lives) and gives peace of mind.\n\nIf a widow reads Shri Guru-Geeta without object, she gets salvation. If she reads with desire, she will get a good husband in the next birth and all her miseries, difficulties and curses will perish.\n\nShri Guru-Geeta is like a Kamadhenu to those who read it with some expectation. It is like a kalpataru to those, who read with desires. It is like a chintamani to the thinkers of everything good. If you read it for salvation you get salvation, if you read it for worldly pleasures, you will get them.\n\nOne can read Shri Guru-Geeta with some object, sitting on a bank of a river or the sea shore, in the mandir of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi or other God, math, cowshed, under vat, awala, mango tree or near a plant of Tulsi or dhotra or in the cremation ground at an lonely but clean and neat place.\n\nEven though a devotee of Shri Guru may be a fool, still he is great, all his good acts, penance, vral, diksha become successful. They are never futile.\n\nAs Shri Guru knows Brahma, he is always pure and whereever he goes, there is the presence of od, Tirth and Peeth. One who reads Guru-Geeta sitting or lying on a bed, standing, walking, speaking, riding on a horse or an elephant, is pure. He has no rebirth.\n\nA soul is one with God, just as the water in the sea, the milk in the milk pot, the ghee in the ghee-pot and the sky in the broken pot aro one with them, similarly the Dnyani (learned), is united with God and lies lost in himself day and night.\n\nO Parvati, when one is blessed by Shri Guru, all his doubts vanish, goddess Saraswati resides on his tongue and he gets both the pleasures and salvation by the favour of Shri Guru. One's recitation, vrat and penance of several births bear fruit.\n\nO Waranane (having good face), I told you, this principle of Sankhya sastra One God, one religion, one devotion, one penance are nothing else but Shri Guru himself. There is no higher principle .ban that of Shri Guru.\n\nThe home, where is devotion of Shri Guru, parents, family and race, is fortunate. Those, who do not adore Shri Guru due to Vanity of knowledge and penance, are unfortunate.\n\nEven to Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Gods, Rishi, Forefathers, kinnar, siddha, charan, yaksh, munies, the favour of Shri Guru, is like the great holy Tirth. Shri Guru's Tirth is the root of all the Tirths.\n\nIf one reads Shri Guru-Geeta in travel, or during war, at the time of the attack of an enemy, he gets victory in life and salvation at death.\n\nIf Shri Guru-Geeta is read with evil acts, at evil places and with fickle mind, it gives evil effects.\n\nAs you are dear to me, I have told this gist to you. Keep it with yourself. Tell this to one, who is not engrossed in wordly pleasures and has devotion; but do not tell it to him, who is not devoted, who is a deceit, cunning, atheist and who discusses vainly.\n\nHere ends the gist of Shri Guru-Geeta in the form of a dialogue between Ishwar and Parvati, included in the Uttarkhand of Skand Purana.\n\nChapter XLVIII\n\nAmarja Sangam and the Greatness of Ganagapur\n\nOn the parva day of Ashvin Vad 14, Shri Guru said to the disciple, 'We shall have bath at trishali (3 Holy places i. e. Prayag, Kashi and Gaya) with family and children.\n\nThe disciple said, 'For such a long journey, we require some time for preparations'.\n\nShri Guru, 'These holy places are near about. So there is no need for special preparation.'\n\nSaying this he went with them all to the sangamam. All took bath there. Shri Guru said, 'The Sangam is like Prayag. Bhima flows there northwards. This Amarja Sangam is as holy as the Ganga-Yamuna Sangam of Prayag. There are other eight holy places (Tirthas) near about.'\n\nThe disciples, -'Why this river is called Amarja?'\n\nShri Guru, -'Jallundhar Rakshasas were on War. Indra went to Shri Shankar and said, 'We kill Rakshas but from each drop of their blood, new Rakshasas are born and they have spread in Three Lokas. They have killed many Gods.'\n\nHearing this, Shri Shankar was enraged and started to kill the Rakshas in the form of Rudra. Indra said, 'You will kill the Rakshas: but kindly suggest any device to make the gods alive.'\n\nShri Shankar recited Amrit mantra and gave a jar filled with nectar. Indra sprinkled the nectar on the Gods and made them alive. While Indra was going with the jar of the remaining nectar some drops fell on the earth and a river was created called 'Amarja'. Bath in this river prevents diseases and untimely death. This river meets Bhima and this Sangam is great like Triveni Sangam of Prayag. Bath in this Kartik and Magha months, on Somwati, Sankratini grahan (eclipse) Parva at this Sangam is very virtuous.\n\nBefore this Sangam is the Ashwattha, bath near which fulfills all the desires. I also live here. After worshipping this Ashwattha, worship the 'Sangameshwar' with devotion. This is like Mallikarjuna of Shri Shailya. Bow to Nandi and Chandi, have three rounds and see Shiva Shankar.\n\nThere is the 'Varanasi' Tirth i. e. Kashi one mile ahead. One Brahmin of Bharadwaj Gotra was a great devotee of Shri Shiva. He roamed everywhere without clothes, people called him 'mad'. He had two brothers Ishwar and Pandurang. They were thinking of going to Kashi. At this time one devotee of Shri Shiva came there and said to his brothers, ' Why do you go to Kashi? Here is Kashi Vishweshwar.' The brothers said, 'Where is it? Show us'.\n\nThe devotee took a bath and sat in meditation. Shri Shankar appeared before him. The devotee requested him to create an idol of Kashi Vishweshwar there for daily worship and Darshan. Shri Shankar conceded and Manikarnika Kund was created first and the shrine of Kashi Vishweshwar came out of it. A river flowing northward like Bhagirathi also came into existence. All the principal places of Kashi were thus created here. Both the brothers then worshipped Kashi Vishweshwar. These brothers lived at Pandharpur and were known as 'Aradhye'.\n\nHearing this from Shri Guru, all took bath there and worshipped Shri Vishweshwar with devotion and observed other rites.\n\nShri Guru -'Here is ' Papavinashi Tirth' bath in which destroys all sins.' Shri Guru called his sister Ratnai here and said, 'You had killed a cat with a stick and therefore you are having leprosy. You bathe in this Tirth daily and your disease will disappear.' As advised, she bathed here for three days and her disease was wiped off.\n\nA little further is 'Koti Tirth'. One should bathe here on Sankranthi, Grahan, Poornima and Amavasya and give a cow with a calf in charity. Further to this is 'Rudra Tirth'. It is as holy as Gaya. Observe Shraddha here.\n\nFurther is 'Chakra Tirth' like Dwarka. Beyond is 'Manmath Tirth'. To the east of it, is 'Kalleshwar' like Gokarna Mahabaleshwar. By doing this, eight glories are obtained.'\n\nShri Guru thus narrated the greatness of the eight holy places and all were pleased. They bathed and observed other rites and returned to Gangapur with Shri Guru. A grand samardhana was arranged jointly.\n\nChapter IL\n\nThe Gist of Guru Geeta\n\nNamdharak bowed to Shri Siddha Muni with folded hands and said, \"Gurudev, you have narrated to me the life of Shri Guru and have given me the real gnyan (knowledge) which has wiped off my karma and by your blessing, I have known the essence of religion. Devotion to Shri Guru is like the Kalpataru and Rishis like Vasishta and Shuka also follow this path. Now kindly tell me the path of Sadguru.\"\n\nBeing pleased with the question, Shri Siddha said, \"Namdharak, you are very fortunate as you as you have asked question regarding the eternal principles, knowing with illusion and ignorance are wiped off and the mind becomes as clear as the light of the sun.\n\nOnce when Shri Shankar was sitting on a beautiful point of Kailas, Devi Parvati with folded hands said to him with devotion, \"Great God of Gods, Guru of the universe, give me Guru mantra and kindly tell me the means by which one's soul becomes united with Brahma\".\n\nShri Shankar said, \"Dear Devi, this is a question which has never been asked to me so far by anybody. You are my second form. So I shall tell you this gist and this will benefit all the people also\".\n\nVeda, Shastra, Purana, Ithihas, Mantra-tantra vidya, Smriti-jaran-maran (using the power of doing miracles by the devotees of Shiva and shakti) and other various sciences put one in illusion. Without knowing the gist of devotion to Guru, people perform sacrifices, observe penance, vrata, charity, recitation and go to the holy places but only after the rise of the light of Shri Guru, difficult vidya, worldly illusion and ignorance are all wiped off. By serving Shri Guru, all sins perish and the soul becomes pure and united with Brahma.\n\nTaking the holy water, touched by the lotus like feet of Shri Guru, is like a bath at a holy place. This Tirth is as holy as Kashi or Prayag.\n\nAlways remember Shri Guru. Recite Shri Guru's name all the time. Obey his orders, serve and worship Shri Guru with devotion. Doing this, one can even attain my position.\n\nThe alphabet 'Gu' means darkness and 'Ru' means light. Guru means the knowledge of the light of Brahma that destroys darkness of ignorance. GU is the first alphabet to create illusion and other attributes. RU is the second alphabet of Brahma, which destroys illusion and vain appearance. This power of Guru is supreme and is difficult even for the Gods to obtain.\n\nA Sadhaka (disciple) should offer to Shri Guru good seat, bed, clothes, ornaments, conveyances etc. He should serve him with devotion for getting one's position, ashram, caste and pray him with body, senses, money, son, wife, etc. clearly and should not be ashamed to lay prostrate before him.\n\nMen go to hell by living in family life, as one's body is full of worms, night soil, urine, phlegm, blood, flesh and bad odor. Bow to Shri Guru, who liberates a person from the worldly miseries.\n\nShri Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh and Para-Brahma. He is the cause of the creation of Universe, liberator of persons from this worldly sea and giver of the knowledge of all the Vidyas.\n\nBy applying the ointment of Shri Guru's knowledge to one's eyes, closed eyes are opened, parents, brothers, and good men who give real knowledge of worldly life, are all Gurus. Though there is diversity in the universe, yet there is oneness. Shri Guru protects one from all difficulties, showing the cause and effect.\n\nIf Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu is enraged, Shri Guru protects the devotees, but when Shri Guru himself is enraged, even Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu cannot protect them.\n\nJust as the blind man cannot see the light of the Sun, so the dull persons do not see the nectar-like appearance of Shri Guru, which is visible only to the eyes of the thoughtful. Shri Guru is like a monarch, who is witnessing the drama of creation and destruction of the universe.\n\nThree Nath, Ganesh, 3 Bhairava Peethas, Siddha, 3 Batus, 2 Pad, 3 Dooties, Shri Shankar, 4, 6, 8, 9 Veeresh, 5 Veeravalies are all associated with the best 'Shri Malini' mantra. Bow to this Shri Guru Mandal.\n\nTo think about Shri Guru's body is like thinking about everlasting Shri Shiva and to recite Shri Guru's name to praise to eternal Shiva's qualities.\n\nShri Guru is birthless, devoid of old age and has no beginning. He is self-created, devoid of change, full of bright bliss, minutes of the minute, greatest of the great and eternal. He is self-shining, spotless, sky pervading, everlasting and has no decrease. Vedas and Manu describe Shri Guru's penance in this way. Therefore always remember Shri Guru.\n\nBy the knowledge of self, which is pervading the entire universe, moveable and immovable, sins of several births are atoned. There is no greater principle than the knowledge of self. There is no greater penance than the service of Shri Guru and there is no deeper knowledge than the advice of Shri Guru.\n\nShri Guru is Jagannath (lord of the universe) and the Guru of the 3 Lokas. Shri Guru is the universe and our soul is the soul of all the creation. Bow to Shri Guru, who gives this knowledge.\n\nThe persons, who are proud of penance and knowledge and who are engrossed in the worldly affairs, are like the pots moving on the wheel of a pot-maker. Gods, Gandharvas, fore fathers, Yaksh, Kinnar, Rishi, Siddha, who do not serve Shri Guru, do not get salvation.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is supreme joy and who gives the best pleasure. He is shrine of knowledge, above division, sky pervading, knower of 'Tattwam Asi' (that thou art) principle, only one, eternal, pure, immovable, who witnesses everything and who is devoid of existence and three qualities (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas).\n\nTo know one's self is the supreme knowledge and the utmost goal of life. This is attained only by the favor of Shri Guru.\n\nRemember Shri Guru till death. Even if he is fickle minded, do not forget or forsake him.\n\nThe wise should not speak about Shri Guru with disrespect. Do not tell a lie before him.\n\nThose who despise Shri Guru go to hell. Those who discuss vainly with Shri Guru become Brahma Rakshas and have to live in barren and waterless places.\n\nOh Parvati, Shri Guru protects his disciples, even if god, Muni or pannag curses. Gods and Munis are weak before Shri Guru, whose curses can destroy them in no time.\n\nO Devi, according to Smrities and Vedas, Shri Guru is Parabrahmah. Guru is a mantra of two syllables.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is pervading all the universe from Brahma to grass, who is eternal, whole, formless, devoid of qualities, engrossed in self-knowledge, above divisions and full of real bright-joy (Sat-Chit-Anand Roop).\n\nBrahma is eternal like fragrance in camphor and flowers and like the coolness and warmth in an object. This knowledge can be got only through Shri Guru. So worship and serve him with pure and clear heart and singular devotion. One, who is united with Brahma in meditation, realizes Kundalini, Brahma Randhra and formlessness and gets salvation without doubt.\n\nThe ignorant wins over the worldly sea and the wise besides gets knowledge of actions and no-actions by following the path of Shri Guru.\n\nThose, who read, hear or write Shri Guru Geeta and give it in charity with money, all their desires are fulfilled. Always read Sri Guru-Geeta to get rid of the miseries of the worldly life.\n\nEach and every syllable of Guru-Geeta enables to win death, remove all difficulties and fear of Yaksha, Rakshas, ghosts, thieves, tigers and diseases. It gives the power of using Bhasma, mesmerism and hypnotism.\n\nO Devi, read Shri Guru-Geeta, sitting on a site of Kush grass (dharbhasan) or white blanket with attentive mind. Use a white seat for peace, red for mesmerizing, black for punishing the evildoers and yellow for getting wealth. For peace, sit facing the north, for mesmerizing facing the east, for punishing the evildoers facing the south and for wealth facing the west.\n\nRecitation of Guru-Geeta, gives one incentive power, develops one's qualities, destroys evil acts, makes good acts successful, removes fear of Grahas (planets), destroys evil dreams, gives issues even to sterile women, gives good luck to the married women (keep their husbands alive all their lives) and gives peace of mind.\n\nIf a widow reads Shri Guru-Geeta without object, she gets salvation. If she reads with desire, she will get a good husband in the next birth and all her miseries, difficulties and curses will perish.\n\nShri Guru-Geeta is like a Kamadhenu to those who read it with some expectation. It is like a Kalpataru to those, who read with desires. It is like a Chintamani to the thinkers of everything good. If you read it for salvation you get salvation, if you read it for worldly pleasures, you will get them.\n\nOne can read Shri Guru-Geeta with some object, sitting on a bank of a river or the sea shore, in the Mandir of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi or other God, math, cowshed, under vat, awala, mango tree or near a plant of Tulsi or dhotra or in the cremation ground at a lonely but clean and neat place.\n\nEven though a devotee of Shri Guru may be a fool, still he is great, all his good acts, penance, vrata, diksha become successful. They are never futile.\n\nAs Shri Guru knows Brahma, he is always pure and wherever he goes, there is the presence of God, Tirth and Peeth. One who reads Guru-Geeta sitting or lying on a bed, standing, walking, speaking, riding on a horse or an elephant, is pure. He has no rebirth.\n\nA soul is one with God, just as the water in the sea, the milk in the milk pot, the ghee in the ghee-pot and the sky in the broken pot are one with them, similarly the Dnyani (learned), is united with God and lies lost in himself day and night.\n\nO Parvati, when one is blessed by Shri Guru, all his doubts vanish, goddess Saraswati resides on his tongue and he gets both the pleasures and salvation by the favor of Shri Guru. One's recitation, vrata and penance of several births bear fruit.\n\nO Waranane (having good face), I told you, this principle of Sankhya Sastra One God, one religion, one devotion, one penance are nothing else but Shri Guru himself. There is no higher principle than that of Shri Guru.\n\nThe home, where is devotion of Shri Guru, parents, family and race, is fortunate. Those, who do not adore Shri Guru due to Vanity of knowledge and penance, are unfortunate.\n\nEven to Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Gods, Rishi, Forefathers, kinnar, Siddha, charan, yaksh, Munis, the favor of Shri Guru, is like the great holy Tirth. Shri Guru's Tirth is the root of all the Tirth.\n\nIf one reads Shri Guru-Geeta in travel, or during war, at the time of the attack of an enemy, he gets victory in life and salvation at death.\n\nIf Shri Guru-Geeta is read with evil acts, at evil places and with fickle mind, it gives evil effects.\n\nAs you are dear to me, I have told this gist to you. Keep it with yourself. Tell this to one, who is not engrossed in worldly pleasures and has devotion; but do not tell it to him, who is not devoted, who is a deceit, cunning, atheist and who discusses vainly.\n\nHere ends the gist of Shri Guru-Geeta in the form of a dialogue between Ishwar and Parvati, included in the Uttarkhand of Skandha Purana.\n\nChapter L\n\nThe Muslim King Comes to See Shri Guru\n\nWe have seen a reference of a Rajak in the 9th chapter. By the blessing of Shripad Shri Vallabha, he was born in a Muslim Royal family and he became king of Bidar. Due to devotion of previous birth he was kind and pious. He treated all religions and sects equally. There were several temples for which he had due sympathy. He also had respect for Brahmins. Muslim priests despised Brahmins and Vedic religion. But king said to them, \"God is one. Only the names are different. All are created from 5 great elements (Pancha --- Mahabhoot). The earth is the mother of all. Cows are different colors, but their milk is white. Ornaments may be many, but the gold is the same. Similarly Paramatma (God) is everywhere. So make no difference between the religions and castes.\"\n\nThus the king was ruling impartially. Once he had a tumor on his thigh, Vaidyas and Hakims treated him but to no effect. The king had great pain due to it. He called some Brahmins and requested them to suggest a remedy.\n\nThe Brahmins said, \"Sins of the previous birth harass one in the form of some disease. For this, visit holy places and give something in charity. Live in the company of saints. You go to the Papavinashi Tirth and bathe there. The tumor will subside.\"\n\nThe king went to the Papavinashi Tirth. He met a Sanyasi there. He bowed to him and showed him his tumor The Sanyasi said, - \"When you see a saint, you will be relieved of the disease. I shall tell you a tale in this connection.\"\n\n\"A Brahmin lived in Awanti i.e., Ujjain. He gave up bath and the Brahmin's rites i.e., Sandhya, Puja etc. and lived with a prostitute named Pingla. Once Rishabha Muni came to them. They treated him well. They worshiped him and took the Tirth of his feet. When the Muni was asleep, both served him keeping awake the whole night. Next morning the Muni went away. Later on in their old age, both the Brahmin and Pingla died.\n\nThe Brahmin became the son of king Vajrabahu in the next birth. When he was in Sumati's (eldest) womb, the younger queen became jealous and she gave poison to the eldest queen, who got eruptions all over the body. She delivered a male child, who was also affected by eruptions all over the body. The king got them treated by physicians but they could be cured. The king suspected that the infection would spread in the whole family and he therefore asked a fisherman to take the queen and her son to the forest and leave them there. People were sorry to know about this evil act of the king. Sumathi was roaming in the forest with her son in despair. Due to exertion, she was thirsty and was searching for water. She came to a Mandir and met some females, who told her, \"Padmakar is the king of this country. He is kind and pious. He will protect you.\" In the mean time some maidservants of the king came there. Sumathi narrated to them her sad account. They took Sumathi to the palace and reported to the king about her. The king was very kind and he arranged for her stay.\n\nHere too the eruptions on the body of the mother and son harassed them. One day due to unbearable pain, the child expired. Sumathi began to weep bitterly. The ladies of the neighborhood tried to console her, but she continued mourning.\n\nIn the meanwhile Rishabha Muni came there. King Padmakar received him warmly. As he heard a mourning sound he inquired. Padmakar narrated to him the sad account of Sumathi. Rishabha Muni came to her and began to console her, saying, \"It is futile to mourn for the bygone. All lives are like bubbles in water, this body is made of five elements and when these elements separate, nothing remains behind. So do not mourn for the perishable body. One has to suffer as per one's previous actions. For self-emancipation adore Shri Shankar\".\n\nSumathi said, \"I had to come here leaving the kingdom and here too I met this fate. Now I do not wish to live any longer.\" Saying so she fell on the feet of the Muni.\n\nThe Muni was moved to see her state. He remembered the service that her son had given him in his last birth. He applied a little Bhasma to his forehead and put a little in his mouth. Suddenly the child got life and began to move. The eruptions on his body and on his mother's body also vanished by the powerful sight of the Muni. Both looked as bright as gold. Sumathi and the child bowed to the Muni devotedly. The Muni blessed them and went away. The greatness of the blessing of a saint is like this. \"If you serve a saint you will be relieved from the tumor.\"\n\nThe Muslim king asked with folded hands, \"Kindly tell me where there is a saint, I shall go there\". The Sanyasi said \"Shri Guru lives at Ganagapur on the bank of Bhima. You go to him.\"\n\nThe king immediately went to Ganagapur and inquired about Shri Guru. The people were afraid when the saw that the Muslim king had come to Ganagapur. They did not speak due to fear. When the king asked again he was told that Shri Guru had gone to the Sangam and he would return soon. Hearing this, the Muslim king started to go to the Sangam. On the way he saw Shri Guru coming. He came down Palanquin and bowed to Shri Guru respectively.\n\nShri Guru said, \" O, Rajak, where have you been so far? I am seeing you after a long period\".\n\nHearing this, the Muslim king recollected his life of last birth. He lay prostrate before Shri Guru and began to shed tears of love and joy. With choked voice he asked \"Gurudev, why did you keep me away so long? Being entangled in the royal pleasures, I forgot you. Now I have come to your shelter. Liberate me. I am much harassed due to this tumor on my thigh.\"\n\nShri Guru smiled and said, \"Show me, where is the tumor?\". The king began to look his thigh. But no! The tumor had vanished! He said, \"By your blessings, I could enjoy the royal pleasures and glory. All my desires are fulfilled. I now wish that your holy self should come to my palace and bless my family members.\"\n\nShri Guru said, \"We are Sanyasis. We should not live in cities. You being Muslim, cows are slaughtered daily in your city. This is a great sin. Prohibit killing of cows in your kingdom.\"\n\nThe King said, \"I am not a king now. I am your devotee, a Rajak. Give me a place at your feet.\"\n\nShri Guru began thinking. Now in this Kaliyug, cruelty will be increasing. It would be better if I disappear from here. He therefore thought of going to Gouthami (Godavari). While returning to the math, the king seated Shri Guru in his palkhi and he took his Padukas (sandals) in his hands and walked on foot behind the palkhi.\n\nShri Guru said, \"You should ride on a horse as you are a king. Your persons will blame you for serving a Brahmin and a Sanyasi.\"\n\nThe king said, \"I may be a king for the people, but for you I am your devotee, a Rajak. My body of iron is transformed into gold by your sight. All my desires are now fulfilled\".\n\nBy this time all the elephants, horses and soldiers of the King had reached the place. Shri Guru said, \"Listen to me, ride a horse \".\n\nThe King first seated all the disciples of Shri Guru on the horses and then he rode a horse and the procession started ceremoniously.\n\nShri Guru then said to the king, \"If we come with you, we cannot observe our rituals punctually. Therefore I will go ahead. You come to Papavinashi to see me\".\n\nSaying this, Shri Guru disappeared instantly with all his disciples and reached Bidar. Nagnath the son of Sayamdev met Shri Guru there. He worshiped Shri Guru and did a samaradhana. Then Shri Guru went to the Papavinashi Tirth.\n\nThe Muslim king was very sorry to see the disappearance of Shri Guru from the procession suddenly. But he remembered that he was asked by Shri Guru to see him at Papavinashi. He rode a swift horse and started for Papavinashi. He covered the distance of 88 miles in a day. He saw Shri Guru and again requested him to grace his city by holy presence.\n\nThe kind decorated his city with flags, buntings and arches. He seated Shri Guru in a Palkhi. Nine kinds of gems were waved on him. The citizens waved Aarti at various places. The Muslims censured the king for serving for the Brahmins; but the Hindu citizens and Brahmins praised him for liberal, learned and pious.\n\nThe procession was going with musical instruments. Coins and clothes were being distributed to the poor. When the procession reached the main gate of palace, Shri Guru walked on the costly carpet spread on the path. Shri Guru was seated on the decorated throne and all the queens and children of the king bowed to Him respectfully. Shri Guru blessed the king and his family members and asked, \"Are all your desires fulfilled by now?\"\n\nThe king said, \"I have fully enjoyed the royal glory I now wish to serve at your feet\".\n\nShri Guru asked him to come to Shri Shailya and went to Gouthami at Nasik. He bathed there and returned to Ganagapur. All the citizens were pleased to see that Shri Guru had come back safe.\n\nShri Guru called all the disciples and said; \"Now I wish live secretly. Therefore I intend to go to Shri Shailya. Still I shall be staying at Ganagapur. If I live fear openly, the Muslims will come here daily and trouble me for fulfillment of their desires as the King himself had been here.\"\n\nChapter LI\n\nShri Guru's Journey unto Bliss: Disciples Get Flower-Gift\n\nKnowing that Shri Guru has decided to go to Shri Shailya, all the disciples and citizens felt very happy. They said, \"You are our treasure. Why do you go leaving us?\"\n\nShri Guru smiled and said, \"You need not worry. I shall stay here secretly. I shall have bath at the Amarja Sangam in the morning. In the midday I shall come to Gangapur math and accept Nirgun Puja and give Darshan to the devotees. From the viewpoint of the public, I am going to Shri Shailya Yatra. Have no doubt. I shall always stay at Gangapur. The Ashwattha here are like Kalpataru.\"\n\nSaying this Shri Guru started for Shri Shailya. People accompanied him for some distance and when they returned to the math they saw Shri Guru there. After some time he disappeared. All wondered at this miracle.\n\nShri Guru went to Patal Ganga, flowing at the base of Shri Shailya, He asked his disciples to prepare a flower-seat and said, \"I have to go to Mallikarjuna on Shri Shailya on the other side of the river.\" The disciples prepared a nice seat of flowers of Shevanti, lotus, malati, kanher etc. on the leaf of kardali and placed it on the riverside.\n\nShri Guru said, \"Now you should return to your respective places\". All were greatly aggrieved. Shri Guru sat on the flower seat on Magh Vad 1st, on Friday when Guru (Jupiter) was in Kanya (vergs) Rasa at evening time and before going away said, \" I am going to the place of self-bliss. I shall send flowers as gift, which you should distribute amongst yourselves and worship them, daily. I like singing. I shall be near those, who sing prayers. They will get all the pleasures\".\n\nSaying this Shri Guru disappeared in the river. After some time some boatmen came from the other side of the river. They told, \"We saw Shri Guru on the other side. He was looking like a sanyasi and was holding a dand (stick) in his hand. He had golden sandals. He told his name as 'Narasimha Saraswati. He has given a message for you, 'I am going to the Kardali-Van. Still I shall be at Gangapur. Do not worry. I am sending flowers as gift, which may be distributed amongst yourselves.\"\n\nAll were waiting for the flowers. After a little time, four flowers came flowing. They were taken one each by Sayamdev, Nandi, Narahari and myself. Here is the flower given to me. Saying this, Shri Siddha showed the flower to Namdharak.\n\nSuch is the greatness of Shri Guru. I have narrated only a part of Shri Guru's life, which is very exhaustive. Those who read, hear and write this life will attain all the pleasures. These nectar-like tales will give four Purusharthas and also Paramartha.\"\n\nChapter LII\n\nConclusion: Week-Reading Awatarnika (Contents)\n\nAfter hearing the 51 Chapters of Shri Guru-Charitra, Namdharak lost senses and got Samadhi. His body perspired, his throat got choked and tears flowed from his eyes. He could not speak out a word. Shri Siddha Muni was pleased to see this state of Namdharak. Though the disciple got Samadhi, he should be awakened for the benefit of the people. Thinking thus he moved his hand over his face and body with affection and called him and said, \"Dear boy, come on senses. You have got 'dnyan' and you will get salvation. But if you remain in meditation, how will the people be benefited and enlightened? You asked me and I narrated to you these nectar-like tales of Shri Guru's life. You also heard them conscientiously. You should therefore elaborate them and propagate amongst the people.\"\n\nNamdharak opened his eyes and placed his head on the feet of Shri Siddha and said, \"You are Shri Guru yourself. Shri Guru's life, that you have narrated, is even more sweeter than the nectar. I am not contended yet. Please tell me the whole life again in short\".\n\nHearing this just as a physician prepares the Sanjeevini pills mixing many medicines and keeps the pills with him, similarly I am telling you the summary of this life of Shri Guru.\n\nFurther Shri Siddha said, \"Though Shri Guru has disappeared still he gives Darshan to his sincere devotees as before\".\n\nNamdharak- \"Kindly tell me the procedure of week-reading and other rules to be followed during the week\".\n\nShri Siddha-\"Shri Guru-Charitra can be read any time with pure mind. The credit of reading it in a week is still great. For this, one place and seat should be selected. Keep control on the senses during the week. Before starting the reading bow to God, Brahmin and elders. Worship the volume of \"Shri Guru-Charitra\". One should complete 7 chapters on the first day, read upto 18th chapter on the second day, upto 28th on the third day, upto 34th on the fourth day, upto 37th on the fifth day, upto 43rd on the sixth day and upto 52nd chapters on the seventh day. After reading, worship the volume and take light dinner. Some observe fast for the week; but if this is not possible have food of only one type of corn. On the eighth day, for completion of the week reading, take meals with a Brahmin couple and offer money as Dakshina. If the reading is done with devotion and pure heart, Shri Guru gives Darshan in dream and fulfills one's desires. The trouble of spirits and ghosts vanishes and one gets peace of mind.\n\nNamdharak again expressed to Shri Siddha Muni his gratitude for narrating the life of Shri Guru, which has made his life fortunate and enabled him to attain the bliss.\n\nDedicated to Shri Dattatreya.\n\nOM TAT SAT\n\n*****"
