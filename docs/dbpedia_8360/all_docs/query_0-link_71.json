The violence took place against the backdrop of months of protests led by Muslim women at several sites across the national capital and in the country, against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed updates to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR). Maryam’s mother Nargis recalls the day as the beginning of “a dark, endless night” that has been written into their fates.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Freedoms Our Martyrs Won Are Under Seige\n\n15/08/2024\n\nOutlook / by Anand Teltumbde\n\nThis Independence Day, we are in an age in which we need assurances from our leader that the Constitution will survive\n\nSeventy-seven years ago, our martyrs won freedom from British colonial rule. Three years later, we gave ourselves a Constitution that guaranteed a plethora of freedoms, inspired not by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) but the indigenous ethos of our own freedom movement. Today, having traversed into the Amrit Kaal, these guarantees appear to have expired, needing a new guarantee from our supreme ruler that the Constitution itself will survive. If the likes of Bhagat Singh were to see the state of India’s freedom today, they would certainly ask themselves what was wrong with the British rule that they went to the gallows fighting them.\n\nRead more\n\nIndia Cries for Freedom!\n\n13/08/2024\n\nCountercurrents / by Cedric Prakash\n\nIndia cries for Freedom: Thanks to the relentless struggles and sacrifices of our freedom fighters, on 15 August 1947, India made her tryst with destiny! After years of colonial rule, she finally became an independent nation. Ever since (during these past 77 years), India has made rapid strides in every sphere, and this fact must be applauded; however, one must also humbly admit that, India still has an unimaginable long way to go in the internalisation and actualisation of her freedom!\n\n…\n\nIndia cries for Freedom for Human rights defenders (HRDs), right to information seekers and others who take a stand for truth, justice and human rights. They are at the receiving end of a vicious and vindictive system. The are intimidated, incarcerated and even killed! These include those in the Bhima Koregaon conspiracy case; Jesuit Father Stan Swamy is a case in point.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Telegraph / by Lalit Panda\n\nIn The Incarcerations, Alpa Shah provides a survey of these men and women that allows us to understand what truly connects them\n\nFor many who have followed the news regarding the Bhima Koregaon case, the saga of arrests, press conferences, cyber-forensic reports, bail hearings, statements of condemnation, and protests has gone on long enough and been spread out so thinly that fatigue and forgetfulness are real threats.\n\nNaturally, the opposite has been the case for the 16 individuals arraigned by investigative agencies in the matter. For these persons, the case has illuminated the state of our democracy, the nature of threats against it, and the identity of its most strident defenders.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Incarcerations: Bhima Koregaon And The Search For Democracy In India\n\nAuthor: Alpa Shah\n\nPublishing Date: March 2024\n\nPublisher: Harper Collins Publisher\n\nPages: 672\n\nRead more / order\n\nAlso read:\n\n▪ Bhima Koregaon: Challenging Caste.

Moreover, it became notorious as a sign of the government’s reactionary approach to democratic rights, intolerance of dissident voices, and an attempt to terrorise civic life.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Bhima Koregaon saga of injustice\n\n31/05/2024\n\nTribune India / by Julio Ribeiro\n\nCharges yet to be framed against the accused, even though the first arrests were made in 2018\n\nALPA Shah, whose family hailed from Gujarat, was raised in Nairobi, where my deceased wife, Melba, was born and lived till the age of 10.

The book records stories of her time in jail. She is out on bail after 3 years in the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon violence case.\n\nSudha speaks about her days in jail and how her time in a women’s prison made her aware of the gender gap in legal aid. “Many women are jailed- because their husband committed some crime and are now absconding- they don’t even know about the crime,” she says.\n\nSudha further says that she lives in the house of a friend, as she “can’t afford rent”.

Some prisoners pray, some weep, some just put their heads down and work themselves weary. Some fight defiantly every inch of the way, some are inveterate grumblers, some spew gossip.
