        "text": "By Ramu Ramanathan\n\nEven as malls and new eateries encircle this innocuous structure in busy Dadar, Shivaji Mandir continues to remain the last word in Marathi theatre.\n\nWill the real Marathi Manoos please stand up? Varun Narvekar’s premiere show of his rom-com Muramba at Juhu PVR was all about style, front-row celebrities, chic clothes. It was Marathi cinema, rebooted.\n\nTwenty-four hours ago, I was at Shivaji Mandir. A show of Nirmiti Sawant’s Shree Bai Samartha had concluded. Things look grim. Baloo Maruti Vaskar says only Code Mantra, originally a Gujarati play, draws a houseful in this day and age.\n\nBaloo knows what he is talking about. He has served chai to Prabhakar Panshikar, Dr Lagoo, Madhukar Toradmal, Nana Patekar, Bharat Jadhav and Mohan Joshi. He served customised chai to Reema Lagoo, who would start her act only after Baloo’s tea. Prashant Damle ensures his pre-show snacks at Shivaji Mandir are vada pavs and Baloo’s chai. It’s part of the charm.\n\nI ask Baloo when did he join the Shivaji Mandir canteen. He says, 38 years ago. Those days, the ticket prices were Rs 60 for the front rows. Now it is Rs 300 to Rs 500. What Gattu is to Asian Paints, Baloo is to Shivaji Mandir. He lives and works at Shivaji Mandir — and epitomises the saga of the old world backstage hand.\n\nIt’s only when you head into the office of Shashi Bhalekar, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Smarak Mandal Trust that oversees the theatre plus the schools, libraries, temple trusts and charity work, that you realise there is a subtext to the thing.\n\nShivaji Mandir was born on 3 May 1965. Other than Baloo, it is the Sawants of Sindhudurg who are the forces of tradition trying to resist the erosion of the arts in these times.\n\nThere are two types of Sawants. The Patel Sawant who originates from Gujarat (Patil) and Phond Sawant from Sindhudurg. Anna Sawant who is the head of the Mandal inherits the Sindhudurgi tradition. He belongs to the Sawant family from Sindhudurg, one of the earliest families to have migrated to Goregaon. They are five to six brothers who live together with over 100-odd members (three generations) under the same roof. The oldest brother was the late JB Sawant and his core business JB Engineering manufactured water pumps. Anna Sawant and his team are responsible for transforming and revamping Shivaji Mandir. When Shivaji Mandir celebrated its golden jubilee in 2015, the who’s who of Maharashtra were present. From the chief minister and his cabinet ministers, to Sharad Pawar.\n\nThe reason for this sort of considerable clout is easy to grasp. Jayraj Salgoankar of Kalnirnay explains, “The ruling family ruled from Sawantwadi and the Maharani lives in the palace. She encouraged wooden toy-making and handicrafts art.” Theatre Positive is the Konkani blood group. In addition, Konkan boasts of a robust tradition of the Dashavataar (ten avataars of Vishnu) which is enacted in temples and festivals. This is the reason, the average dramatic index in Konkan is on the high side!\n\nLokmanya Tilak was born in Ratnagari. He sweated on the theatre equity of his fellow Konkanis when he installed a Ganesha idol in Kesari Wada (Pune) in 1894. Tilak wrote in the Kesari: “Our Ganesh festival can be compared to the Olympian and Pythian festivals of Greece”. The girni kamgar who migrated from Konkan to work in the 150 industrial textile mills in Mumbai became the backbone of the freedom struggle. Thus began the tradition of the Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav which ensured community participation through discourses, dancedramas, poetry recital, musical concerts, and above all, the theatre.\n\nThe Sawants from Sindhudurg are the children of this cause. They have been imaginatively choreographing the culture scene in Mumbai since the past hundred years. Shivaji Mandir is a prime example. Plus there is the behind-thescenes work that operates behind the art facades of the hundreds of Ganpati Mandals. As printer Rupesh Sawant of Superlekha, says, “Look at the mandals like Lalbaughcya Raja. It’s like organising the Olympics annually.”\n\nThanks to this system, Mumbai has been blessed. It solved one of the biggest tragic-comic dilemmas in the arts: Who will foot the bill? As Shashi Bhalekar recounts, it was the ordinary people of Mumbai who lined up and bought tickets. He rattles off stats about the impressive run of plays. Thousand shows are de facto. This includes three to four shows per day at Shivaji Mandir, plus a bountiful collection at the box office.\n\nThe period Bhalekar is talking about is: the sixties and seventies. The theatre was prosperous and the theatrewallah was a creative genius.\n\nSatish Alekar (my favourite-most Indian playwright) agrees with Bhalekar: “We were performing my play Mahanirvan in 1977 at Shivaji Mandir. Chandrakant Kale was essaying the role of Bhaurao and I was playing his son Nana. It was a wellattended show. When the play began there was a rousing response from the front row. Gradually we realised that this extra response was coming from one person in the front row. Others started getting disturbed by this gentleman. Gradually we realised that the person who was giving this response was Dr Kashinath Ghanekar! He was the most popular actor at that time, acting in several plays written by Vasant Kanetkar. Kashinath is Kashinath after all! He was acting even while giving a response to a play. Since everyone knew him, nobody in the audience seemed to mind his gestures. They were looking at both styles of acting — one on the stage and the other from the front row. Dr Ghanekar was aware of what he was doing. He had such great appeal and charisma around him. The play went on with his gestures. He even stood up and clapped after Kale’s rendition of the Tukaram abhanga in Kirtan style. He rushed backstage during the interval and started praising everyone. Needless to say, the interval lasted for more than 45 minutes that day.”\n\nUnfortunately, there is no impunity from the bad times in the arts.\n\nThe first time I stepped into Shivaji Mandir was 1982. Datta Samant’s girni kamgar strike was raging. Textile mills were in closure mode. Innumerable workers were jobless. Going to the theatre was no longer a priority. The balcony was shut for the first time. In one single stroke, the main auditorium which had a capacity of 1032 seats was reduced.\n\nA decade later, the 1992-93 riots and 1993 bomb blasts impacted attendance. There was a breakdown of sorts, admits Bhalekar. The girni kamgar could not afford to visit Shivaji Mandir. Students and bohemian intellectuals, aspiring actors and playwrights drifted away. The triumphant middle class with their sixth pay commission preferred glitzier pastures. Many more theatre auditoriums sprung up in Mumbai. The malls were the new shrines. WhatsApp replaced the gajra veni.\n\nA year before he passed away, I had asked theatre producer Mohan Wagh at his adda in Gypsy (next to Shivaji Park), what is an ideal theatre? This larger than life persona who had produced more than a thousand shows of All the Best and sponsored the curtain at Shivaji Mandir replied, “Keeping in mind the Marathi audiences and the type of mainstream Marathi plays that are staged, there are basically four aspects. There is the design of the stage, there is maintenance and there is the staff that takes care of backstage and on-stage requirements.”\n\nAnd the fourth aspect? He replied, “More than all this stage-carpentry, what matters is, the word. Marathi theatre flourished because of the word. The words in our literature represent real life as well as new ideas and truths. Ultimately, the Marathi theatrewallah will need to return to the word.”"
