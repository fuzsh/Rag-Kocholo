        "text": "OM SAI RAM !!!\n\nChapter - 44\n\nNandi Brahmin relieved of Leprosy : He became a Poet.\n\nNandi was a Brahmin suffering from Leprosy. He worshippedd Tuljapur Bhavani\n\nfor 3 years. He observed fast. He stayed near Bhuvaneshwari at Bhilavadi\n\nfor 7 months and worshipped the deity devotedly. He was told in a dream\n\nto go to Shri Guru at Gangapur and that he would then be relieved of the\n\ndisease.\n\nNandi said, 'You are Goddess yourself, how do you ask me to go to a human being.\n\nI shall be here, nomatter if I have to lose my life.'\n\nThe pujari also had similar dream. He and some others told Nandi, 'Do not trouble\n\nthe Goddess hereafter and if you do not ming, we shall not allow you enter\n\nthis mandir.'\n\nBeing helpless he came to Gangapur and went to the Math and bowed to\n\nShri Guru. Shri Guru asked him 'Leaving the Goddess, why did you come to a\n\nhuman being? When you doubt, how can you be relieved of the disease?'\n\nRealising that Shri Guru knew what was in his mind, he said, 'I am a dullard.\n\nKindly forgive me. I have come for your shelter. Kindly protect me. I am ver much\n\nharrassed due to this disease. My wife also left me and went to her parents.\n\nChandla Devi has sent me to you. Kindly do not drive me away.'\n\nShri Guru asked Somnath to take Nandi to the Sangam and said, \"Let him bathe\n\nat the Shatkul and have rounds of the Ashwattha. Give him new clothes, throwing\n\naway his old ones and then bring him here for meals.\"\n\nAs advised by Shri Guru, Somnath took DNandi to the Sangam for bath. After bath\n\nhis body became free from lerosy. After taking rounds of the Ashwattha, Somnath\n\nbrought him back to the Math. Nandi bowed to Shri Guru and began to pray Him.\n\nShri Guru asked him, 'See if all your body has been free from the disease. He looked\n\nto his body and found that some patches had remained on his thigh. Being afraid\n\nhe asked 'After having your blessings why these patches should be here?'\n\nShri Guru said, 'You came with a suspicion that what a man could do and so a little\n\ndisease is there. You should stay here praying God, the little disease that is there\n\nwill also be wiped off soon.'\n\nNandi said, 'I am illiterate. How can I compose poems of praise?'\n\nShri Guru asked him to draw out his tongue. When he did so, Shri Guru put little\n\nbhasma on the tip of his tongue.\n\nInstantly he became wise. He bowed to Shri Guru and began to compose poems\n\nin praise of Shri Guru. The summary of those poems is as follows :-\n\n'I was sinking in the wordly ocean, being deluded by the affection for my family\n\nmembers. I was roaming through different species as swedaj, Andaj, Udbhija and\n\nJaraj i.e. animal life. Human life is the best of all. I had no knowledge in the\n\nShudra birth. The birth of a Brahmin is the best amongst the human beings.\n\nBut if a Brahmin is also a dullard, how can he have knowledge of Shri Guru?\n\nThe blood of the mother and the seman of the father unite and a fetus comes to\n\nexistence as a bubble. After 15 days it becomes liquid. Within a month a small solid\n\nfetus is formed. I the second month the head and the limbs take shape. When the\n\nfive great elements i.e. the earth, the water, the luster, the wind and thesky unite,\n\nthe should enters the fetus. In the fifth month the skin and the hair are formed.\n\nIn the sixth month the fetus starts respiration. In the seventh month, the ear,\n\nthe tongue, the brain and the marrow become solid. In this way I was growing in\n\nthe mother's uterus. The mother would eat hot, salt, sour, pungent and acidic articles,\n\ndue to which I was greatly troubled.\n\nI then took birth. My span of life was fixed. Half of the time i.e. the nights were spent\n\nin sleep in vain. The remaining half is divided in the three stages, childhood, youth\n\nand old age. In the childhood, I had to suffer much. I wept due to pain in the stomach,\n\nbut myu mother thought that I was hungry and took me to her breast. And when\n\nI was hungry, she thought I was ailing and gave me bitter medicines. At times due to\n\nscorpion bite, in the cradle I would cry. She would then sing lulabied and move the\n\ncradly to and frow and tried to lure me to sleep or she would think that I am affected\n\nby some spirit and so the trie Mantra - Tantra and tied a black string on my wrist.\n\nMy mother would take pungent and sour articles and I had to suffer from\n\ndiarrhoea, cough etc.\n\nIn the youth, I was influenced by passion. I disregarded the parents and the guru\n\nand always thought about the female-sex. Due to vanity, I dispised sadhus, saints\n\nand old persons. How could have I adored Shri Guru dring this perios?\n\nIn the old age I was affected by cough, gases and other troubles. My hair became white\n\nwhile taking care of my family and children. I lost my teeth, I could not hear well and\n\nsee properly. even in this state I did not serve Shri Guru. You are the protector and\n\nliberator of the universe. Please liberate me.'\n\nIlliterate Nandi composed such poems. All wondered to see his feat Nandi further said,\n\n'Vedas say that the feet of Shri Guru are holy there is no other way than the feet of\n\nShri Guru, to be free from the worldly sea. By the favour of Shri Guru, all my sins are\n\nwiped off. Shri Guru Narsimha Saraswati is like Kamdhenu. So people should adore\n\nhim and get liberated.\n\nNandi was later called 'Kavishwar' due to his poetry. The patches of leprosy on his\n\nthigh also disappeared in course of time. Nandi greatly rejoiced at the cure.\n\nHe began to serve Shri Guru with more devotion.\n\n!! दिगंबरा दिगंबरा श्रीपाद वल्लभ दिगंबरा !!\n\n!! हे दत्त योगेश्वर वासुदेव श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नारसिंह !!\n\n!! श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नरहरी दत्तात्रेया दिगंबरा !!\n\n!!

His field was on the way\n\nto the Sangam. Once Shri Guru asked him, \"Why do you take this\n\ntrouble daily? What is your desire?\"\n\nParbati said, \"I wish that my field yields a good crop\".\n\nShri Guru, \"what have you sown?\"\n\nParbati said that jawar was sown in his field. He further added,\n\n\"It is due to your favor that this year the corp is good. I wish that\n\nyou should kindly come to my field and have a look at the crop by\n\nyour sight which showers nectar.'\n\nShri Guru went to the field, looked at the crop and said, 'If you have\n\nfaith in me, do as I bid you.'\n\nParbati said, 'I shall obey you from the bottom of my heart'.\n\nShri Guru - 'Till I return at midday, cut off this crop'. Saying so,\n\nShri Guru went to the Sangam.\n\nParbati approached the Revenue Officer and asked him to permit him\n\nto reap the crop on the rent as per the previous year.\n\nThe Officer said, `This year the crop is good, hence the old rent\n\nwill not suffice'.\n\nParbati said, `I shall pay double the rent. So please give me permission'.\n\nThe Officer agreed and granted the permission.\n\nParbati took some men with him, went to the field and reaped the crop.\n\nHis wife and children tried to prohibit him; but he did not listen to them.\n\nThe wife complained to the Officer, `The crop is good this year; but before\n\nthe harvest, my husband is reaping the field on the advice of a Sanyasi and\n\nis depriving us of food. Kindly prohibit him to cut the crop'.\n\nThe Officer sent his men to ask Parbati why he was reaping the field before\n\nthe harvest. Parbati said, `If the Officer has doubt of getting the rent;\n\nI shall pay the corn from reserve and keep my cattle at his door'.\n\nParbati reaped all the crop. Seeing that Shri Guru was returning from the Sangam,\n\nhe bowed to Him and reported that he had cut the crop as instructed.\n\nShri Guru `You have reaped in vain!'\n\nParbati `I have read the crop as advised by you. I have full faith in you.'\n\nShri Guru `You will have the fruit of your devotion, the wife and children of\n\nParbati said that they have lost their food. Parbati consoled them by saving,\n\n`Shri Guru is Shri Shiva incarnate. With his blessing,We shall have no loss.\n\nHe told us to do this due to some unforeseen reason.'\n\nIn about a week, there was a severe code and all the crops in the country\n\nwere lost. Then on Mul Nakshatra, there was heavy rain, which was also\n\nharmful to the crops; but Parbati's field yielded hundred times more crop of\n\ngood quality. All wondered to see this.\n\nThe wife and children of Parbati also rejoiced. They begged apology of Parbati\n\nand repented for underestimating Shri Guru. The mention of all the above facts\n\nis made here in order to show the affinity of Shri Sai Baba to Shri Vithal of\n\nPandharpur. One Sai Mandir at Phanaswadi, in the Girgaum area of the Bombay city,\n\nwas formerly a temple of Vithal and it was known as \"Shri Premal Vithal Mandir\".\n\nIn this temple the idols of Vithal and Rakhumai were installed by Shri Gajanan\n\nVinayak Pradhan, as the temple itself was constructed my him as his own private\n\nproperty. However, Shri Vasant Shastri alias Aba Panshikar completely changed the\n\nMandir and gave it the present form. One Shri Prabhakar Panshikar, is a famous\n\nactor on the Marathi stage and Shri Aba Panshikar is his brother. Shri Aba Panshikar\n\nwas performing Keertans in the Vithal Mandir regularly. Shri Bhole Guruji, who is a\n\nSai devotee, used to attend Shri Panshikar's keertans as he was staying very near\n\nthe above Mandir, in the Mugbhat area Girgaum. Shri Bhole Guruji requested\n\nShri Panshikar to start praying to Shri Sai Baba. Shri Panshikar was not aware\n\nof greatness of the saint of Shirdi up to that time and on being initiated by\n\nShri Bhole Guruji, he gladly became a devotee of Shri Sai Baba. He very soon\n\nbecame a staunch and sincere devotee of Sri Baba and very soon thought of\n\nchanging the Vithal Mandir into a Sai temple. It is because of the zeal and efforts\n\nof Shri Aba Panshikar that the Premal Vithal Mandir is now converted into a\n\nSai Mandir and is now known by that name.\n\nIn this temple, we see the idol of Shri Sai Baba in plaster, which is about four\n\nand a half feet high. This idol is seated on an altar. It will be seen from the\n\nphotograph of the temple published along with this article that the original idols\n\nof Shri Vithal and Rakhumai installed in the temple have still be retained in the\n\ntemple as Shri Sai Baba had reverence for that god as stated at the beginning\n\nof this article. The beautiful idol of Shri Sai Baba in plaster was made by one\n\nsculptor Shri G.V. Patkar. Though the temple was originally constructed as a\n\nprivate temple, still it was later on thrown open to everyone for worship and at\n\npresent anybody can go and offer flowers or garlands to Shri Sai Baba or\n\nShri Vithal - Rakhumai.\n\nIn the rear side of this temple, there is a banyan tree about hundred years old.\n\nAround this tree we can also find the idols of Shri Datta, Hanuman and Pindi\n\nof Shri Shankar. In addition to that, there are the Padukas of Shri Sai Baba in\n\nsilver in this area. These Padukas were installed at the October 1952.\n\nThe practice of getting prepared the silver Padukas of Shri Sai Baba and give them\n\nto different people or institutions dedicated to Sai worship, was started by this temple.\n\nSo far, the Sai Padukas got prepared by this Mandir have been installed at five\n\ndifferent places. It may be noted here that the Padukas installed at the Sai temple\n\nof Smt. Ajibai Wanarse at London, were got prepared by this Mandir.\n\n\"Service to humanity and Service to the dump mutes is the service to God\"\n\nthis was the motto of Shri Sai Baba and the management of this temple has\n\nborne in mind this fact. They have therefore coupled a social duty with this religious\n\ninstitution. On the first floor of this temple, arrangements have been made for the\n\nfree accommodation of poor and deserving students, Who have no arrangements\n\nto stay in Bombay. A great number of students have taken advantage of this facility\n\nand because of the religious atmosphere of the temple; these students are grooved\n\nin Sai devotion from the young age of their life.\n\nAarti, worship etc. are carried out at this temple every day as per those\n\nperformed at Shirdi. Ramnavami, Gurupournima and Vijayadashami are the\n\ngreat festivals observed at this temple on the same lines as is done at Shirdi.\n\nThis temple has started one more practice. On every Shivaratri day, the offering\n\nof fruits is made to Shri Baba and they are later on distributed to the devotees\n\nby way of prasad. Shri Pandurang Mahadev Warang is a staunch Sai devotee,\n\nwho manages the daily affairs of the temple with great care. He is only thirty-one\n\nyears of age at present, but for the last twenty-two years he is staying in the temple\n\npremises and is attending to the work of this temple. The management wants to expand\n\nthe activities of the temple and arrange some further programs on a large scale;\n\nbut due tot shortage of space they feel sorry that it is not possible for them. Shri Warang\n\nalways says that all his difficulties are readily solved by Shri Sai Baba. This shows his great\n\nfaith in Shri Sai Baba and his devotion to Him.\n\nGirgaum is a very crowded locality of Bombay city. They area round about Lalbaug\n\nand Parel which is known as the \"Mill area\" is perhaps another equally crowded area\n\nin Bombay. The people in the \"Mill area\" are so very busy in their struggle for existence\n\nthat they have hardly any time to think about god or existence. The people in the\n\nGirgaum area are mostly white-collar people. They have regular hours of their office\n\nwork. Similarly religious practices are imbibed in them from their childhood. Hence they\n\nfind the need of a place for worship where they can get mental peace. The people\n\nwho were formerly they devotees of Vithal have started visiting this temple for the\n\nworship of that god; but after seeing the idol of Shri Sai Baba in the temple and\n\nhaving come to know. His greatness, they automatically become His devotees.\n\nThus this temple has a good place of worship for the devotees staying in Girgaum\n\narea of the Bombay city and is therefore frequented by a number of devotees\n\nevery day.\n\nNamdharak bowed to Shri Siddhamuni with folded hands and said,\n\n\"gurudeo, you have narrated to me the life of Shri Guru and have given me the real\n\ngnyan(knowledge) which has wiped off my karma and by your blessing, I have known\n\nthe essence of religion. Devotion to Shri Guru is like the Kalpataru and Rishis like\n\nVashishta and Shuka also follow this path. Now kindly tell me the path of Sadguru.\"\n\nBeing pleased with the question, Shri Siddha said, \"Namdharak, you are very fortunate\n\nas you as you have asked question regarding the eternal principles, knowing with\n\nillusion and ignorance are wiped off and the mind becomes becomes as clear\n\nas the light of the sun.\n\n!! दिगंबरा दिगंबरा श्रीपाद वल्लभ दिगंबरा !!\n\n!! हे दत्त योगेश्वर वासुदेव श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नारसिंह !!\n\n!! श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नरहरी दत्तात्रेया दिगंबरा !!\n\n!!

You are my second form. So I shall tell you this gist and this\n\nwill benefit all the people also\".\n\nVeda, Shastra, Purana, Ithihas, Mantra-tantravidya, Smriti-jaran-maran(using the\n\npower of doing miracles by the devotees of Shiva and Shakti) and other various\n\nsciences put one in illusion. Without knowing the gist of devotion to Guru, people\n\nperform sacrifices, observe penance, vrat, charity, recitation and go to the holy places\n\nbut only after the rise of the light of Shri Guru, difficult vidya, worldly illusion and\n\nignorance are all wiped off. By serving Shri Guru, all sins perish and the soul becomes\n\npure and united with Brahma.\n\nTaking the holy water, touched by the lotus like feet of Shri Guru, is like a bath\n\nat a holy place. This Tirth is as holy as Kashi or Prayag.\n\nAlways remember Shri Guru. Recite Shri Guru's name all the time. Obey his orders,\n\nserve and worship Shri Guru with devotion. Doing this, one can even attain\n\nmy position.\n\nThe alphabet 'Gu' means darkness and 'Ru' means light. Guru means the knowledge\n\nof the light of Brahma, that destroys darkness of ignorance. 'Gu1 is the first alphabet\n\nto create illusion and other attributes. 'Ru' is the second alphabet of Brahma\n\nwhich destroys illusion and vain appearance. This power of Guru is supreme and is\n\ndifficult even for the Gods to obtain.\n\nA Sadhak (disciple) should offer to Shri Guru good seat, bed, clothes, ornaments,\n\nconveyances etc. He should serve him with devotion for getting one's position,\n\nashram, caste and pray him with body, senses, money, son, wife, etc. clearly\n\nand should not be ashamed to lay prostrate before him.\n\nMen go to hell by living in family life as one's body is full of worms, night-soil,\n\nurine, phelgm, slood, flesh and bad odor. Bow lo Shri Guru, who liberates a person\n\nfrom the worldly miseries.\n\nShri Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha and Para-Brahma. He is the cause of the\n\ncreation of Universe, liberator of persons from this worldly sea and giver of the\n\nknowledge of all the vidyas.\n\nBy applying the ointment of Shri Guru's knowledge to one's eyes, closed eyes are\n\nopened, parents, brothers, and good men who give real knowledge of worldly life,\n\nare all Gurus. Though there is diversity in the universe, yet there is oneness.\n\nShri Guru protects one from all difficulties, showing the cause and effect.\n\nIf Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu are enraged, Shri Guru protects the devotees,\n\nbut when Shri Guru himself is enraged, even Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu cannot\n\nprotect them.\n\nJust as the blind man cannot see the light of the Sun, so the dull persons do not\n\nsee the nectar-like appearance of Shri Guru, which is visible only to the eyes of the\n\nthoughtful. Shri Guru is like a monarch, who is witnessing the drama of creation\n\nand destruction of the universe.\n\nThree Nath, Ganesh, 3 Bhairava Peethas, Siddha, 3 Batus, 2 Pad, 3 Dooties,\n\nShri Shankar, 4, 6, 8, 9 Veeresh, 5 Veeravalies are all associated with the best\n\n'Shri Malini' mantra. Bow to this Shri Guru mandal.\n\nTo think about Shri Guru's body is like thinking about everlasting Shri Shiva and to\n\nrecite Shri Guru’s name to praise to eternal Shiva's qualities.\n\nShri Guru is birthless, devoid of oldage and has no begining. He is self created,\n\ndevoid of change, full of bright bliss, minutest of the minute, greatest of the great and\n\neternal. He is self shining, spotless, sky pervading, everlasting and has no decrease.\n\nVedas and Manu describe Shri Guru's penance in this way. Therefore always\n\nremember Shri Guru.\n\nBy the knowledge of self, which is pervading all the universe, moveable and\n\nimmovoable, sins of several births are atoned. There are no greater principle than the\n\nknowledge of self. There is no greater penance than the service of Shri Guru and\n\nthere is no deeper knowledge than the advice of Shri Guru.\n\nShri Guru is Jagannath (lord of the universe) and the Guru of the 3 Lokas. Shri Guru\n\nis the universe and our soul is the soul of all the creation. Bow lo Shri Guru,\n\nwho gives this knowledge.\n\nThe persons, who are proud of penance and knowledge and who are engrossed\n\nin the worldly affairs, are like the pots moving on the wheel of a pot-maker. Gods,\n\nGandharvas, fore fathers, yaksh, kinnar, rishi, siddha, who do not serve\n\nShri Guru do not get salvation.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is supreme joy and who gives the best pleasure.\n\nHe is shrine of knowledge, above division, sky pervading, knower of Tattwam Asi'\n\n(that thou art) principle, only one, External, pure, immoveable, who witnesses\n\neverything and who is devoid of existence and three qualities(Satwa Raj and Tam).\n\nTo know one's self is the supreme knowledge and the utmost goal of life.\n\nThis is attained only by the favour of Shri Guru.\n\nRemember Shri Guru till death. Even if he is fickle minded, do not forget or forsake him.\n\nThe wise should not speak about Shri Guru with disrespect. Do not tell a\n\nlie before him.\n\nThose who despise Shri Guru go to hell. Those who discuss vainly with Shri Guru\n\nbecome Brahma Rakshas and have to live in barren and waterless places.\n\nOh Parvati, Shri Guru protects his disciples, even if god, muni or pannag curses.\n\nGods and munies are weak before Shri Guru, whose curses can destroy them in no time.\n\nO Devi, according to Smrities and Vedas, Shri Guru is Parabrahma. Guru is a mantra\n\nof two syllables.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is pervading all the universe from Brahma to grass,\n\nwho is eternal, whole, formless, devoid of qualities, engrossed in self-knowledge,\n\nabove divisions and full of real bright-joy (sat-chit-anand rup).\n\nBrahma is eternal like fragrance in camphor and flowers and like the coolness and\n\nwarmth in an object. This knowledge can be got only through Shri Guru. So worship\n\nand serve him with pure and dear heart and singular devotion. One, who is united\n\nwith Brahma in meditation, realises Kundalini, Brahma Randhra and formlessness\n\nand gels salvation without doubt.\n\nThe ignorant wins over the worldly sea and the wise besides gets knowledge of\n\nactions and no-actions by following the path of Shri Guru.\n\nThose, who read, hear or write Shri Guru Geeta and give it in charity with money,\n\nall their desires are fullfilled. Always read Sri Guru-Geeta to get rid of the miseries\n\nof the wordly life.\n\nEach and every syllable of Guru-Geeta enables to win death, remove all difficulties\n\nand fear of yaksha, Rakshas, ghosts, thieves, tigers and diseases. It gives the power\n\nof using Bhasma, mesmerism and hypnotism.\n\nO Devi, read Shri Guru-Geeta, sitting on a site of kush grass (dharbhasan) or\n\nwhite blanket with attentive mind. Use a white seat for peace, red for mesmerising,\n\nblack for punishing the evildoers and yellow for getting wealth. For peace, sit facing\n\nthe north, for mesmerising facing the east, for punishing the evildoers facing the\n\nsouth and for wealth facing the west.\n\nRecitation of Guru-Geeta, gives one incentive power, develops one's qualities,\n\ndestroys evil acts, makes good acts successful, removes fear of Gra has (planets),\n\ndestroys evil dreams, gives issues even to sterile women, gives goodluck to the\n\nmarried women (keep their husbands alive all their lives) and gives peace of mind.\n\nIf a widow reads Shri Guru-Geeta without object, she gets salvation. If she reads\n\nwith desire, she will get a good husband in the next birth and all her miseries,\n\ndifficulties and curses will perish.\n\nShri Guru-Geeta is like a Kamadhenu to those who read it with some expectation.\n\nIt is like a kalpataru to those, who read with desires. It is like a chintamani to the\n\nthinkers of everything good. If you read it for salvation you get salvation, if you read it\n\nfor worldly pleasures, you will get them.\n\nOne can read Shri Guru-Geeta with some object, sitting on a bank of a river or the\n\nsea shore, in the mandir of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi or other God, math, cowshed,\n\nunder vat, awala, mango tree or near a plant of Tulsi or dhotra or in the cremation\n\nground at an lonely but clean and neat place.\n\nEven though a devotee of Shri Guru may be a fool, still he is great, all his good acts,\n\npenance, vral, diksha become successful. They are never futile.\n\nAs Shri Guru knows Brahma, he is always pure and whereever he goes, there is the\n\npresence of od, Tirth and Peeth. One who reads Guru-Geeta sitting or lying on a bed,\n\nstanding, walking, speaking, riding on a horse or an elephant, is pure. He has no rebirth.\n\nA soul is one with God, just as the water in the sea, the milk in the milk pot,\n\nthe ghee in the ghee-pot and the sky in the broken pot aro one with them, similarly the\n\nDnyani (learned), is united with God and lies lost in himself day and night.\n\nO Parvati, when one is blessed by Shri Guru, all his doubts vanish, goddess Saraswati\n\nresides on his tongue and he gets both the pleasures and salvation by the favour of\n\nShri Guru. One's recitation, vrat and penance of several births bear fruit.\n\nO Waranane (having good face), I told you, this principle of Sankhya sastra One God,\n\none religion, one devotion, one penance are nothing else but Shri Guru himself.\n\nThere is no higher principle .ban that of Shri Guru.\n\nThe home, where is devotion of Shri Guru, parents, family and race, is fortunate.\n\nThose, who do not adore Shri Guru due to Vanity of knowledge and penance, are\n\nunfortunate.\n\nEven to Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Gods, Rishi, Forefathers, kinnar, siddha, charan,\n\nyaksh, munies, the favour of Shri Guru, is like the great holy Tirth. Shri Guru's\n\nTirth is the root of all the Tirths.\n\nIf one reads Shri Guru-Geeta in travel, or during war, at the time of the attack\n\nof an enemy, he gets victory in life and salvation at death.\n\nIf Shri Guru-Geeta is read with evil acts, at evil places and with fickle mind,\n\nit gives evil effects.\n\nAs you are dear to me, I have told this gist to you. Keep it with yourself. Tell this to one,\n\nwho is not engrossed in wordly pleasures and has devotion; but do not tell it to him,\n\nwho is not devoted, who is a deceit, cunning, atheist and who discusses vainly.\n\nHere ends the gist of Shri Guru-Geeta in the form of a dialogue between\n\nIshwar and Parvati, included in the Uttarkhand of Skand Purana.\n\n!! दिगंबरा दिगंबरा श्रीपाद वल्लभ दिगंबरा !!\n\n!! हे दत्त योगेश्वर वासुदेव श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नारसिंह !!\n\n!! श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नरहरी दत्तात्रेया दिगंबरा !!\n\n!!

Prayag, Kashi and Gaya)\n\nwith family and children.\n\nThe disciple said, 'For such a long journey, we require some time\n\nfor preparations'.\n\nShri Guru, 'These holy places are near about. So there is no need\n\nfor special preparation.'\n\nSaying this he went with them all to the sangamam. All took bath there.\n\nShri Guru said, 'The Sangam is like Prayag. Bhima flows there northwards.\n\nThis Amarja Sangam is as holy as the Ganga-Yamuna Sangam of Prayag.\n\nThere are other eight holy places (Tirthas) near about.'\n\nThe disciples, -'Why this river is called Amarja?'\n\nShri Guru, -'Jallundhar Rakshasas were on War. Indra went to Shri Shankar\n\nand said, 'We kill Rakshas but from each drop of their blood, new Rakshasas\n\nare born and they have spread in Three Lokas. They have killed many Gods.'\n\nHearing this, Shri Shankar was enraged and started to kill the Rakshas in the\n\nform of Rudra. Indra said, 'You will kill the Rakshas: but kindly suggest any\n\ndevice to make the gods alive.'\n\nShri Shankar recited Amrit mantra and gave a jar filled with nectar. Indra\n\nsprinkled the nectar on the Gods and made them alive. While Indra was going\n\nwith the jar of the remaining nectar some drops fell on the earth and a river\n\nwas created called 'Amarja'. Bath in this river prevents diseases and untimely\n\ndeath. This river meets Bhima and this Sangam is great like Triveni Sangam\n\nof Prayag. Bath in this Kartik and Magha months, on Somwati, Sankratini grahan\n\n(eclipse) Parva at this Sangam is very virtuous.\n\nBefore this Sangam is the Ashwattha, bath near which fulfills all the desires.\n\nI also live here. After worshipping this Ashwattha, worship the 'Sangameshwar'\n\nwith devotion. This is like Mallikarjuna of Shri Shailya. Bow to Nandi and Chandi,\n\nhave three rounds and see Shiva Shankar.\n\nThere is the 'Varanasi' Tirth i. e. Kashi one mile ahead. One Brahmin of\n\nBharadwaj Gotra was a great devotee of Shri Shiva. He roamed everywhere without\n\nclothes, people called him 'mad'. He had two brothers Ishwar and Pandurang.\n\nThey were thinking of going to Kashi. At this time one devotee of Shri Shiva came\n\nthere and said to his brothers, ' Why do you go to Kashi? Here is Kashi Vishweshwar.'\n\nThe brothers said, 'Where is it? Show us'.\n\nThe devotee took a bath and sat in meditation. Shri Shankar appeared before him.\n\nThe devotee requested him to create an idol of Kashi Vishweshwar there for daily\n\nworship and Darshan. Shri Shankar conceded and Manikarnika Kund was created\n\nfirst and the shrine of Kashi Vishweshwar came out of it. A river flowing northward\n\nlike Bhagirathi also came into existence. All the principal places of Kashi were\n\nthus created here. Both the brothers then worshipped Kashi Vishweshwar.\n\nThese brothers lived at Pandharpur and were known as 'Aradhye'.\n\nHearing this from Shri Guru, all took bath there and worshipped Shri Vishweshwar\n\nwith devotion and observed other rites.\n\nShri Guru -'Here is ' Papavinashi Tirth' bath in which destroys all sins.' Shri Guru\n\ncalled his sister Ratnai here and said, 'You had killed a cat with a stick and therefore\n\nyou are having leprosy. You bathe in this Tirth daily and your disease will disappear.'\n\nAs advised, she bathed here for three days and her disease was wiped off.\n\nA little further is 'Koti Tirth'. One should bathe here on Sankranthi, Grahan,\n\nPoornima and Amavasya and give a cow with a calf in charity. Further to this is\n\n'Rudra Tirth'. It is as holy as Gaya. Observe Shraddha here.\n\nFurther is 'Chakra Tirth' like Dwarka. Beyond is 'Manmath Tirth'. To the east of it,\n\nis 'Kalleshwar' like Gokarna Mahabaleshwar. By doing this, eight glories are obtained.'\n\nShri Guru thus narrated the greatness of the eight holy places and all were pleased.\n\nThey bathed and observed other rites and returned to Gangapur with Shri Guru.\n\nA grand samardhana was arranged jointly.\n\n!! दिगंबरा दिगंबरा श्रीपाद वल्लभ दिगंबरा !!\n\n!! हे दत्त योगेश्वर वासुदेव श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नारसिंह !!\n\n!! श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नरहरी दत्तात्रेया दिगंबरा !!\n\n!!

Who is it?\n\nDattatreya: I have 24 gurus.\n\nKing: Twenty-four gurus at such a tender age? Who are they?\n\nDattatreya: Mother Earth is my first guru. She taught me to hold those\n\nwho trample me, scratch me, and hurt me lovingly in my heart, just\n\nas she does. She taught me to give them my best, remembering that\n\ntheir acts are normal and natural from their standpoint.\n\nKing: Who is your second guru?\n\nDattatreya: Water it is a force that contains life and purity. It cleanses\n\nwhatever it touches and provides life to whoever drinks it. Water flows\n\nunceasingly. If it stops, it becomes stagnant. Keep moving is the lesson\n\nI learned from water.\n\nKing: Your third guru?\n\nDattatreya: Fire. It burns everything, transforming it into flame. By consuming\n\ndead logs, it produces warmth and light. Thus, I learnt how to absorb everything\n\nthat life brings and how to turn it into flame. This flame enlightens my life and\n\nin that light, others can walk safely.\n\nKing: Who is your fourth guru, sir?\n\nDattatreya: Wind is my fourth guru. The wind moves unceasingly, touching\n\nflowers and thorns alike, but never attaches itself to the objects it touches.\n\nLike the wind, I learned not to prefer flowers over thorns or friends over foes.\n\nLike the wind, my goal is to provide freshness to all without becoming attached.\n\nKing: The fifth guru, sir?\n\nDattatreya: This all-pervading and all-embracing space is my fifth guru.\n\nSpace has room for the sun, moon, and stars and yet, it remains untouched\n\nand unconfined. I, too, must have room for all the diversities, and still remain\n\nunaffected by what I contain. All visible and invisible objects may have their\n\nrightful place within me, but they have no power to confine my consciousness.\n\nKing: Who is your sixth guru, sir?\n\nDattatreya: The moon. The moon waxes and wanes and yet never loses\n\nits essence, totality, or shape. From watching the moon, I learned that waxing\n\nand waning-rising and falling, pleasure and pain, loss and gain-are simply phases\n\nof life. While passing through these phases, I never lose awareness of\n\nmy true Self.\n\nKing: Who is your seventh guru?\n\nDattatreya: The sun is my seventh guru. With its bright rays, the sun draws\n\nwater from everything, transforms it into clouds, and then distributes it as rain\n\nwithout favor. Rain falls on forests, mountains, valleys, deserts, oceans, and cities.\n\nLike the sun, I learned how to gather knowledge from all sources, transform that\n\nknowledge into practical wisdom, and share it with all without preferring some\n\nrecipients and excluding others.\n\nKing: And your eighth guru?\n\nDattatreya: My eighth guru is a flock of pigeons. One pigeon fell into a hunter's\n\nnet and cried in despair. Other pigeons tried to rescue it and got caught, too.\n\nFrom these pigeons, I learned that even a positive reaction, if it springs from\n\nattachment and emotion, can entangle and ensure.\n\nKing: Your ninth guru, sir?\n\nDattatreya: My ninth guru is the python who catches and eats its prey, and\n\nthen doesn't hunt again for a long time. It taught me that once my need\n\nhas been met, I must be satisfied and not make myself miserable running\n\nafter the objects of my desire.\n\nKing: Who is your tenth guru?\n\nDattatreya: The ocean, which is the abode of the waters. It receives and\n\nassimilates water from all the rivers in the world and never overflows its boundaries.\n\nIt taught me that no matter what experiences I go through in life, no matter\n\nhow many kicks and blows I receive, I must maintain my discipline.\n\nKing: Who is your eleventh guru, oh wise one?\n\nDattatreya: The moth is my eleventh guru. Drawn by light, it flies from its dwelling\n\nto sacrifice itself in the flame. It taught me that once I see the dawn, I must overcome\n\nmy fear, soar at full speed, and plunge into the flame of knowledge to be\n\nconsumed and transformed.\n\nKing: The twelfth?\n\nDattatreya: My twelfth guru is a bumblebee who takes only the tiniest drops\n\nof nectar from the flowers. Before accepting even that much, it hums and hovers\n\nand dances, creating an atmosphere of joy around the flower. It not only sings\n\nthe song of cheerfulness; it also gives more to the flowers than it takes. It pollinates\n\nthe plants and helps them prosper by flying from one flower to another. I learned\n\nfrom the bumblebee that I should take only a little from nature and that I should\n\ndo so cheerfully, enriching the source from which I receive sustenance.\n\nKing: Your thirteenth guru?\n\nDattatreya: My thirteenth guru is the honeybee who collects more nectar than\n\nit needs. It gathers nectar from different sources, swallows it, transforms it into\n\nhoney, and brings it to the hive. It consumes only a bit of what it gathers, sharing\n\nthe rest with others. Thus I should gather wisdom from the teachers of all disciplines\n\nand process the knowledge that I gain. I must apply the knowledge that is conducive\n\nto my growth, but I must be ready to share everything I know with others.\n\nKing: The fourteenth guru, oh wise seeker?\n\nDattatreya: Once I saw a wild elephant being trapped. A tame female elephant in\n\nseason was the bait. Sensing her presence, the wild male emerged from its domain\n\nand fell into a pit that had been cleverly concealed with branches and heaps of leaves.\n\nOnce caught, the wild elephant was tamed to be used by others. This elephant is\n\nmy fourteenth guru because he taught me to be careful with my passions and desires.\n\nWorldly charms arouse our sensory impulses and, while chasing after the sense\n\ncravings, the mind gets trapped and enslaved, even thought it is powerful.\n\nKing: Who is your fifteenth guru, sir?\n\nDattatreya: The deer, with its keen sense of hearing. It listens intently and is wary\n\nof all noises, but is lured to its doom by the melody of the deer hunter's flute.\n\nLike the deer, we keep our ears alert for every bit of news, rumor, and gossip,\n\nand are skeptical about much that we hear. But we become spellbound by certain\n\nwords, which, due to our desires, attachments, cravings, and vasanas (subtle\n\nimpressions from the past), we delight to hear. This tendency creates misery\n\nfor others and ourselves.\n\nKing: And who is your sixteenth guru?\n\nDattatreya: The fish who swallows a baited hook and is caught by the fisherman.\n\nThis world is like bait. As long as I remember the episode of the fish, I remain free\n\nof the hook.\n\nKing: Who is your seventeenth guru?\n\nDattatreya: A prostitute who knows that she doesn't love her customers, nor do\n\nthey love her. Yet she waits for them and, when they come, enacts the drama of love.\n\nShe isn't satisfied with the artificial love she gives and receives, nor with the payment\n\nshe is given. I realized that all humans are like prostitutes and the world, like the\n\ncustomers, is enjoying us. The payment is always inadequate and we feel dissatisfied.\n\nThus, I became determined not to live like a prostitute. Instead, I will live with dignity\n\nand self-respect, not expecting this world to give me either material or internal\n\nsatisfaction, but to find it myself by going within.\n\nKing: Who is your eighteenth guru?\n\nDattatreya: My eighteenth guru is a little bird who was flying with a worm in its beak.\n\nLarger birds flew after him and began pecking him. They stopped only when the little\n\nbird dropped the worm. Thus, I learned that the secret of survival lies in renunciation,\n\nnot in possession.\n\nKing: Who is your nineteenth guru, sir?\n\nDattatreya: My nineteenth guru is the baby that cries when it is hungry and stops\n\nwhen it suckles at its mother's breast. When the baby is full, it stops feeding and\n\nnothing its mother does can induce it to take more milk. I learned from this baby to\n\ndemand only when I really need. When it's provided, I must take only what I require\n\nand then turn my face away.\n\nKing: And your twentieth guru?\n\nDattatreya: A young woman whom I met when I was begging for alms. She told me\n\nto wait while she prepared a meal. Her bracelets jangled as she cooked, so she removed\n\none. But the noise continued, so she took off all her bracelets, one by one, until only\n\none remained. Then there was silence. Thus, I learned that wherever there is a crowed,\n\nthere is noise, disagreement, and dissension. Peace can be expected only in solitude.\n\nKing: And your twenty-first guru?\n\nDattatreya: A snake that makes no hole for itself, but who rests in holes other creatures\n\nhave abandoned, or curls up in the hollow of a tree for a while, and then moves on.\n\nFrom this snake, I learned to adjust myself to my environment and enjoy the resources\n\nof nature without encumbering myself with a permanent home. Creatures in nature\n\nmove constantly, continually abandoning their previous dwellings. Therefore, while\n\nfloating along the current of nature, I find plenty of places to rest. Once I am rested,\n\nI move on.\n\nKing: And your twenty-second guru?\n\nDattatreya: My twenty-second guru is an arrow maker who was so absorbed in shaping\n\nhis arrowheads that the king and his entire army passed without attracting his attention.\n\nThus I learned from the arrow makes to be absorbed in the task at hand, no matter\n\nhow big or small. The more one-pointed my focus, the greater my absorption, and the\n\ngreater my absorption, the more subtle my awareness. The goal is subtle, and can\n\nonly be grasped by subtle awareness.\n\nKing: Your twenty-third guru?\n\nDattatreya: My twenty-third guru is a little spider who built itself a nice cozy web.\n\nWhen a larger spider chased it, it rushed to take refuge in its web. But it ran so fast\n\nthat it got entangled and was swallowed by the bigger spider. Thus, I learned that\n\nwe create webs for ourselves by trying to build a safe haven, and as we race along\n\nthe threads of these webs, we become entangled and are consumed. There is no safety\n\nto be found in the complicated webs of our actions.\n\nKing: And who is your twenty-fourth guru?\n\nDattatreya: My twenty-fourth guru is a worm who was caught by a songbird and\n\nplaced in its nest. As the bird began singing, the worm became so absorbed in the\n\nsong that it lost all awareness of its peril. Watching this little creature become absorbed\n\nin a song in the face of death reminded me that I, too, must develop the art of listening\n\nso that I my become absorbed in the eternal sound, nada, that is always within me.\n\nListening to Dattatreya, the king realized that the wisdom of this sage flowed from\n\nhis determination to keep the goal of life firmly fixed in his awareness and from\n\nhis ability to find the teachings everywhere he turned.\n\nThis particular conversation is found Srimad Bhagavad Purana and\n\nis part of the conversation between Lord Krishna and Uddhava.\n\nThis dialogue is also part of various Puranas and other holy scriptures in Hinduism.\n\n!! दिगंबरा दिगंबरा श्रीपाद वल्लभ दिगंबरा !!\n\n!! हे दत्त योगेश्वर वासुदेव श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नारसिंह !!\n\n!! श्रीपाद श्रीवल्लभ नरहरी दत्तात्रेया दिगंबरा !!\n\n!!
