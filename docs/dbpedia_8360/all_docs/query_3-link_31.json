        "text": "Prabhakar Vishnu Panshikar was an actor and director of Marathi Theatre. He was also a manager in commercial Marathi theatre. Prabhakar Vishnu Panshikar was born in Bombay in 1931. He began his career as an actor in 1955 when he joined M. G. Rangnekar's Natyaniketan, and was trained by directors like Rangnekar and Nandu Khote. Real popularity came as the conman protagonist in Atre's to mi navhech or 'I'm Not Him' in 1962, of which he must have done over 1500 shows. However, he left owing to differences of opinion with Rangnekar and established his own company, Natyasampada, with Vasudev Kolhatkar and Mohan Wagh. Their first three productions failed miserably. The break came with Vasant Kanetkar's Ashrunchi jhali phule or 'Tears Have Become Flowers' in 1966. In that play his role of the professor-turned-goonda won tremendous appreciation. Later ventures, both prose drama and Sangitnatak proved almost equally successful, like Darwhekar's Katyar kaljat ghusli or 'Dagger Pierced the Heart' in 1967. He is said to have notched up over 5000 performances as an actor.\n\nThis article is a stub. You can enrich by adding more information to it. Send your Write Up to content@indianetzone.com"
