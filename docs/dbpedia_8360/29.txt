About Dinkar Panshikar

Dinkar Panshikar was born in Mumbai in 1936. He began his training under Dattatreya Kunte in Patan, Gujarat. Later, he moved to Mumbai and received advanced instruction from Vasantrao Kulkarni and Suresh Haldankar. But it was Panshikar’s final guru Nivruttibuwa Sarnaik who made a lasting impress on his gayaki. Panshikar spent over 10 years with Nivruttibuwa.

Dinkar Panshikar comes from a family accomplished in the performing arts. His elder brother is the renowned Marathi stage maestro Prabhakar Panshikar, and his nephew is the Hindustani vocalist Raghunandan Panshikar.

The Panshikars are originally from Goa, with their roots in the Panshi quarter of Pernem.
