        "text": "When it comes to royal couples, some dominate the headlines – Prince William and Princess Catherine, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and of course, we can never tire of talking about the late Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nBut one duo tends to shy away from the limelight and – despite being married for nearly 25 years – often slip under the radar. Prince Edward and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh have been married since 1999, and Edward remains the Queen’s only child who has not been divorced.\n\nUnlike the rushed introduction and later marriage of his older brother King Charles and his first wife Princess Diana, Prince Edward and Sophie met organically and began dating shortly after a charity event in 1993.\n\n“The failures of the marriages of Edward’s beloved sister Anne and then, in rapid and ever more embarrassing succession, Andrew and Charles, made him even more determined to put caution before commitment,” royal expert Ingrid Seward says.\n\nThe then-public relations executive with her own firm, Sophie Rhys-Jones was 34 when the royal engagement was announced – the same age as her husband-to-be.\n\nProposing with a stunning diamond ring that featured two heart-shaped gemstones, Edward asked Sophie to be his wife during a Christmas holiday on Windermere Island in the Bahamas and the couple tied the knot less than a year later at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSince marrying, the couple have welcomed two children – their eldest daughter Lady Louise Windsor was born in 2003 and their son James, Viscount Severn in 2007.\n\nBoth Edward and Sophie are regulars on the royal engagement calendar but still, as aforementioned, stay out of the limelight.\n\nWith that being said, the couple’s love story is something out of a fairytale and deserves a moment in the sun…\n\nKeep reading to see the relationship journey of Prince Edward and Sophie – from fun-loving boyfriend and girlfriend to the happily married Earl and Countess they are today."
