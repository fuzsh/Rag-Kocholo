        "text": "Prince Edward, the King’s youngest sibling, and the Duchess of Edinburgh’s 1999 wedding was a jubilant celebration, held at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe couple, who met at a tennis match in 1993, had a relatively simple Royal Wedding, with no ceremonial state or military involvement – in spite of being ‘relatively’ lowkey, their nuptials were still an impressive television moment, attracting 200 million viewers.\n\nSophie’s beautiful dress was designed by Samantha Keswick (née Shaw), a silk organza ensemble, decorated with 325,000 crystals and pearls. Her head was crowned with the Anthemion tiara, named so because of the design, the anthemion shapes consist of radiating petals, similar to a fan, and it was chosen from the Queen’s private jewellery collection.\n\nLooking back at photographs from the day is like entering a time warp, with the youthful 17-year-old Prince William, 15-year-old Prince Harry and 11-year-old Princess Beatrice watching from the sidelines and a photograph of a young-ish Prince Edward framed by his brothers.\n\nThe late Queen looked utterly majestic in a floor length lilac frock, completed with a diamond hair slide and purple feather.\n\nHere are a handful of the greatest pictures from that very day."
