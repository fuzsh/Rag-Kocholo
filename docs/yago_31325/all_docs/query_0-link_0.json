        "text": "Duchess Sophie in Bavaria\n\nPrincess Sophie Maria Friederike Auguste Leopoldine Alexandrine Ernestine Albertine Elisabeth of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony (Full German name: Prinzessin Sophie Maria Friederike Auguste Leopoldine Alexandrine Ernestine Albertine Elisabeth von Sachsen, Herzogin zu Sachsen[citation needed]) (15 March 1845, Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony[citation needed] – 9 March 1867, Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria[citation needed]) was the eighth and youngest child of John of Saxony and his wife Amalie Auguste of Bavaria and a younger sister of Albert of Saxony and George of Saxony.[citation needed] Through her marriage to Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria, Sophie was a member of the House of Wittelsbach and a Duchess in Bavaria.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\n[edit]\n\nSophie married her first cousin Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria, fifth child and third-eldest son of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, on 11 February 1865 in Dresden.[citation needed] Sophie and Karl-Theodor had one child:[citation needed]\n\nDuchess Amalie in Bavaria (24 December 1865 – 26 May 1912)[citation needed]\n\nIllness and death\n\n[edit]\n\nChildbirth caused severe respiratory problems for Sophie, which progressively weakened her, although she managed to recover. However, a year later she contracted a severe case of influenza that she could not overcome. Sophie died shortly before her 22nd birthday on 9 March 1867 and was interred at Tegernsee Abbey.\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
