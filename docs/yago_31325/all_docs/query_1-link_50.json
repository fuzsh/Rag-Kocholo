        "text": "A member of the royal family of Saxony who had been living in Co Westmeath since the 1950s has died, aged 91.\n\nPrincess Virginia, n√©e Dulon, was the last surviving member of her generation in the family.\n\nHer late husband, Prince Ernest of Saxony, was the third son of the last king of Saxony, Friedrich August III, who abdicated the throne in November 1918.\n\nBorn in Frankfurt, Germany, Princess Virginia ran a farm for several decades at Coolamber, near Mullingar, Co Westmeath.\n\nA local priest, Father Noel McGeeney, said he had been told that at one stage, she was one of the biggest employers in the area. He added that relatives from Germany had flown to Ireland to be by her side before she died.\n\nPrincess Virginia married her husband in 1947. He had previously been married to Princess Sophie of Luxembourg, who died in 1941. She is survived by her stepsons Gero and Dedo, niece Anja and nephew Joachim. The funeral Mass takes place today at 11 a.m. at St Mary's church, Lismacaffrey."
