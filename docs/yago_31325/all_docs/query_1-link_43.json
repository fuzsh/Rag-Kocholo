        "text": "So, another thread inspired by this thread, this one is about the successful marriage of Charles II to Sophia of Hanover in 1658, after Sophia speaks with Lord Craven, and the man assures her that Charles is marrying her for her, not for his fortune.\n\nChanges from this:\n\nCharles and Sophia marry in 1658, Barbara Villiers rise is stalled, and she will fall earlier and harder than otl, due to Sophia's personality. Charles and Sophia will have seven children, six sons and one girl, the eldest of who will either marry his cousin Anne Louise or Isabel of Portugal. James, Duke of York will marry Catherine of Braganza and have one daughter. Henry Duke of Gloucester who survives the illness ttl, marries firstly Erdumthe of Saxony and then when she passes, a widowed Maria of Nassau (open to change here) they have one son and three daughters.\n\nOther changes:\n\nPedro II and Maria Francisca have two children, a son and otl's Isabel of Portugal. The son would marry Marie Louise's sister, who became Duchess of Savoy otl.\n\nPrince Rupert's marriage here has yet to be decided, it's up in the air, looking for suggestions on this regard.\n\nIf there's anything I've forgotten, or should add please do let me know.\n\nHow's this looking @Valena\n\nAlexis II. Alexis is romanization of Alexei.\n\nNot a soldier, though. His military education OTL was VERY lackluster. Even compared to his brother Feodor, who despite spinal trauma was keen rider and archer, Alexei's educators practically ignored such sports. No records of war games for him unlike Feodor & Peter as well.\n\nIsabel marries Duke of Savoy in any TL where she has a full brother.\n\nOh that's very odd, wonder why that was, so he'd be the administrator, perhaps Feodor would be the military one, or as militaristic as he can be?\n\nAnd alright, Duke of Savoy for Isabel.\n\nAnd copying table over for ease:\n\nIssue of Charles II and Sophia of Palatinate (m.1658):\n\nCharles, Prince of Wales (b.1660)\n\nMarried Marie Louise d'Orleans, Mademoiselle d'Orleans, in 1679\n\nHad issue:\n\nCharles, Duke of Edinburgh (b.1680)\n\nMary Louise, Princess Royal (b.1684)\n\nFrederick James, Duke of Clarence (b.1661)\n\nMarried Christiane of Saxe-Merseburg in 1679 (negotiations ongoing since 1677)\n\nHad issue:\n\nPrincess Sophie Christiane of Clarence (b.1679)\n\nWilliam, Duke of Kendal (b.1666) -\n\nSophia Charlotte, Princess Royal (b.1668)\n\nMarried Frederick IV of Denmark circa 1688-1689\n\nHenry Philip, Duke of Sussex (b.1670) - bride unsure, possible daughter of Karl II of Palatinate & Amelia of Nassau-Dietz born circa 1675\n\nRupert/Robert Charles, Duke of Richmond (b.1671) - Inherited Richmond and Lennox titles after their holder, 3rd Duke, drowned in Denmark the same year\n\nMaurice Edward, Duke of Portsmouth (b.1674) - never married, became Anglican Archbishop. Rumors are that he preferred his own sex and thus never married\n\nIssue of James of York and Catherine of Braganza (m.1661):\n\nLady Mary of York (b.1662) (married Charles Philip, Duc de Valois, in 1677)\n\nIssue of Henry of Gloucester and Maria of Nassau (m.1661):\n\nLady Henriette Marie of Gloucester (b. 1662) (married her second cousin, Prince Palatine Robert, Earl of Holderness, in 1683)\n\nLady Sophia of Gloucester (b.1665)- Married John George IV, Elector of Saxony (match doubled with that of Duke of Clarence & Christiane of Saxe-Merseburg)\n\nHenry, Earl of Cambridge, later Duke of Northumberland jure uxoris (b.1667) (married Elisabeth Percy in 1679 as the way of securing income for cadet branch of Stuarts)\n\nLady Catherine of Gloucester (b.1669) - possible wife of ATL son of Karl II & Amelia of Nassau-Dietz and thus Electress Palatine (match circa 1688-1689)\n\nNote: Sussex and Portsmouth were dukedoms given to mistresses/husbands of bastard daughters OTL, I'm reusing them for Royal Dukes\n\nRegarding Alexei/Alexis' lack of military training, it was theorized that he had the more high-functioning version of condition affecting Ivan V - not preventing him from learning languages and sciences, but making him anxious in the open/agoraphobic, thus no military training for him. Though that's just a theory from a modern researcher.\n\nHis son, Michael II, would on the other hand be quite militaristic, due to influence of Uncle Feodor & Uncle Karl, complete with presents in form of elaborate sets of toy guns & ships ordered in Germany. So we may still have a warlike reign in Russia in early 1700ies, but that would be Russia undergoing great economic transformation and in general more ready for this reign.\n\nAlright I quite like that, it would make Michaels reign a lot easier in some sense, as he doesn;t have to do everything at once, as Peter did"
