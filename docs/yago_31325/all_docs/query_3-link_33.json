        "text": "How old is Sophie, Countess of Wessex and where is she from?\n\nSophie Rhys-Jones was born in Oxford, on January 20, 1965. She celebrated her 58th birthday in 2023.\n\nShe was born into a middle-class family. Her father, Christopher Bournes Rhys-Jones (born 1931), is a retired sales director for an importer of industrial tyres and rubber goods.\n\nHer mother was Mary (née O'Sullivan, 1934–2005), a charity worker and secretary.\n\nSophie also has an older brother, David (born 1963).\n\nHer godfather is actor Thane Bettany, her father's stepbrother, and the father of actor Paul Bettany.\n\nHow did she meet Prince Edward and when did they marry?\n\nWhile working at Smooth's sister station Capital in 1987, Sophie met Prince Edward, the youngest son of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, when he was dating her friend.\n\nShe later met Edward again at a charity event in 1993, and the two began a relationship. Their engagement was announced in January 1999.\n\nEdward proposed to Sophie with an engagement ring worth an estimated £105,000.\n\nThe wedding took place on June 19, 1999, at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. This was a break from the weddings of Edward's older siblings, which were large events at Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nUpon their marriage, Prince Edward was created a hereditary peer as Earl of Wessex, with Sophie becoming a Countess.\n\nThe family live at Bagshot Park in Surrey, while their office and official London residence is based at Buckingham Palace.\n\nWho are Sophie and Edward's children?\n\nEdward and Sophie's children are styled as the children of an Earl, rather than as prince/ss and royal highness.\n\nThe couple have two children: Lady Louise Windsor, born November 8, 2003, and James, Viscount Severn, born December 17, 2007.\n\nLady Louise was a bridesmaid at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011. She was born with esotropia, and underwent an operation in an unsuccessful attempt to correct the problem in January 2006. However, she had further treatment in 2013 that corrected her vision.\n\nJames currently attends Eagle House School, a coeducational school near Sandhurst in Berkshire.\n\nWhat does Sophie do for a living?\n\nBefore becoming a member of the royal family, Sophie first trained as a secretary. She then began working in public relations, representing firms across the UK, Switzerland, and Australia before opening her own agency in 1996.\n\nIn 2002, Sophie closed her business interests and began full-time work as a member of the royal family. She is now the patron of over 70 charities and organisations, including Childline and the London College of Fashion.\n\nSophie does over 200 royal engagements each year, including visits to schools, universities, and military bases.\n\nHer charity work usually revolves around people with disabilities, women's rights, avoidable blindness, and agriculture."
