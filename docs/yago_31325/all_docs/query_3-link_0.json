        "text": "Member of the British royal family (born 1965)\n\nSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh (born Sophie Helen Rhys-Jones, 20 January 1965) is a member of the British royal family. She is married to Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, the youngest sibling of King Charles III.\n\nSophie grew up at Brenchley, Kent, and later attended West Kent College, training as a secretary. She then worked in public relations, representing firms across the UK, Switzerland and Australia before opening her own agency in 1996. She met Edward in 1987 while working for Capital Radio; they began dating in 1993. Their engagement was announced in January 1999, and they married on 19 June at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The couple have two children: Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex, who are respectively sixteenth and fifteenth in line to the British throne as of 2024 .\n\nIn 2002, Sophie closed her business interests and began full-time work as a member of the royal family. She is the patron of over 70 charities and organisations, including Childline and the London College of Fashion. She undertakes over 200 engagements each year, including visits to schools, universities and military bases.[1][2] Her charity work primarily revolves around people with disabilities, women's rights, avoidable blindness and agriculture.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nSophie Helen Rhys-Jones was born at Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 20 January 1965 into a middle-class family.[3][4][5] Her father, Christopher Bournes Rhys-Jones (born 1931), is a retired sales director for an importer of industrial tyres and rubber goods.[4] Her mother was Mary (née O'Sullivan; 1934–2005), a charity worker and secretary.[6][7] She has an elder brother, David (born 1963), and was named after her father's sister, Helen, who died in a riding accident in 1960. Her godfather, actor Thane Bettany, was her father's stepbrother; both men spent their early life in Sarawak, North Borneo, then a British Protectorate ruled by the White Rajahs.[8]\n\nShe descends from King Henry IV of England[9] and is related to the family of the Viscounts Molesworth through her grandmother, Margaret Patricia Rhys-Jones (née Molesworth; 1904–1985), who was the great-granddaughter of the Rev. John Molesworth, himself the father of Sir Guilford Molesworth and a great-grandson of Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth.[10][11]\n\nRhys-Jones was raised in a four-bedroom 17th-century farmhouse in Brenchley, Kent. She began her education at Dulwich Preparatory School, before moving on to Kent College, Pembury, where she was friends with Sarah Sienesi, with whom she subsequently shared a flat in Fulham and who later became her lady-in-waiting. Rhys-Jones then trained as a secretary at West Kent College, Tonbridge.[12]\n\nShe began a career in public relations, working for a variety of firms, including four years at Capital Radio,[13] where she was assigned to the press and promotions department, as well as public relations companies The Quentin Bell Organisation and MacLaurin Communications & Media.[14] She also worked as a ski representative in Switzerland and spent a year travelling and working in Australia. In 1996, Rhys-Jones launched her public relations agency, RJH Public Relations, which she ran with her business partner, Murray Harkin, for five years.[14][15]\n\nPrior to her marriage, Rhys-Jones lived at Coleherne Court, London.[16]\n\nMarriage and children\n\nWhile working at Capital Radio, Rhys-Jones met Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, for the first time in 1987 when he was dating her friend.[17] She met him again at a promotion shoot for the Prince Edward Summer Challenge to raise money for charity in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards.[18][19] In December 1993 and amid growing speculation about whether they were planning to marry, Edward wrote a letter to newspaper editors, in which he denied any wedding plans and asked the media to respect their privacy.[20] Edward proposed to Rhys-Jones at a vacation in the Bahamas in December 1998 and their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999.[18][21] Edward proposed to her with an engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat white gold. The ring was made by Asprey and Garrard (now Garrard & Co) and is worth an estimated £105,000.[22] Rhys-Jones, who was reportedly close to the Queen from the beginning of her relationship with Edward, was allowed to use the royal apartments at Buckingham Palace prior to her engagement.[23]\n\nThe wedding took place on 19 June 1999 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, a break from the weddings of Edward's older siblings, which were large, formal events at Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral.[24] On the day of their marriage, Prince Edward was created a hereditary peer as Earl of Wessex with the subsidiary title of Viscount Severn (derived from the Welsh roots of his wife's family).[25]\n\nThe couple spent their honeymoon at Balmoral Castle.[24] Following their union, the Earl and Countess of Wessex moved to Bagshot Park, their home in Surrey.[26] While their private residence is Bagshot Park, their office and official London residence is based at Buckingham Palace.[27]\n\nIn December 2001, Sophie was taken to the King Edward VII Hospital after feeling unwell. It was discovered that she was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy and the foetus had to be removed.[28] Two years later, on 8 November 2003, she prematurely gave birth to her daughter, Lady Louise, resulting from a sudden placental abruption that placed both mother and child at risk, and the Countess had to undergo an emergency caesarean section at Frimley Park Hospital, while the Earl of Wessex rushed back from Mauritius.[29] Sophie returned to Frimley Park Hospital on 17 December 2007, to give birth, again by caesarean section, to her son, James (then Viscount Severn, now Earl of Wessex).[30]\n\nPublic life\n\nSophie's first overseas tour after her marriage was to the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island in 2000.[31]\n\nIn December 2011, the Countess of Wessex joined her husband visiting troops in Afghanistan. In February and March 2012, the Earl and Countess visited the Caribbean for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, visiting Saint Lucia, Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla and Antigua and Barbuda. Highlights of the tour included the 50th Anniversary Independence Day celebrations in Saint Lucia, a joint address from both houses of the Barbados Parliament and a visit to sites affected by the recent volcanic eruptions in Montserrat.[32] In June 2012, as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Edward and Sophie, represented the Queen during a three-day tour to Gibraltar. The couple attended a Queen's Birthday Parade and toured Main Street, in the historic old town.[33]\n\nIn 2013, the couple visited South Africa. Later that year, the Countess made solo trips to India and Qatar as the patron of the sight-saving charity Orbis UK.[23][34][35] She made a similar visit to Bangladesh in November 2017.[36] Sophie, as Colonel-in-Chief of Corps of Army Music, visited The Countess of Wessex's String Orchestra at the Royal Artillery Barracks, in London. On 3 March 2014, the Queen approved the title of \"The Countess of Wessex's String Orchestra\" for the new Army String Orchestra in recognition of the Corps of Army Music's Colonel-in-Chief.[37] In November 2014, Sophie was in Zambia representing the Queen at the state funeral of the late president of Zambia, Michael Sata.[38]\n\nOn 26 March 2015, Sophie attended the reburial of Richard III of England in Leicester Cathedral.[39] In May 2015, Sophie represented the Queen in the 70th anniversary celebrations to mark the Liberation Day of the Channel Islands. The Countess delivered a message from the Queen, who paid tribute to the island's continued allegiance and loyalty to the Crown.[40] She visited Canada and the United States in November 2015. While in Toronto, she criss-crossed across the city, making stops at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair and the UHN's Toronto General Hospital and Toronto Western Hospital, of which she is patron. Sophie then travelled to New York City, paying an emotional visit to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Sophie also made an appearance at an Armistice Day service at the Queen Elizabeth II September 11th Garden, which was opened in commemoration of the 67 British victims of the attack. The Countess later attended the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Gala dinner in Manhattan.[41][42]\n\nThe Earl and Countess of Wessex toured Canada in June 2016, visiting Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The couple visited a variety of places in and around Regina, Saskatchewan before attending the Globe Theatre's 50th anniversary gala.[43] In March 2017, Sophie embarked on a 4-day visit to Malawi as Vice-Patron of The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, visiting programmes to end avoidable blindness and champion young leaders.[44] On 9 May 2017, the Countess attended King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway's 80th Birthday Celebrations on behalf of the royal family.[45] The Earl and Countess of Wessex represented the Queen at the 50th Anniversary Celebrations of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's Accession to the Throne of Brunei in October 2017.[46] On 30 November 2017, Sophie visited the 'Making for Change' fashion training and manufacturing unit, a fashion training and manufacturing unit established by the Ministry of Justice and London College of Fashion at HM Prison Downview as patron of the London College of Fashion During her visit, the Countess met staff and prisoners, including female inmates, and awarded participants with certificates as part of their training programme.[47][48]\n\nAn avid supporter of charities that deal with learning disabilities, Sophie made a solo trip to Belfast in January 2018 to visit a number of charities that she had supported through her work over the last decade, including Mencap's children's centre.[49] She also opened the new dementia-friendly unit of Northern Ireland Hospice, the first of its kind in the UK.[49] The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited Sri Lanka in February 2018 to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of Independence, Sri Lanka–United Kingdom relations, the Commonwealth, education and young people.[50] In October 2018, Edward and Sophie toured the Baltic states.[51][52]\n\nIn March 2019, the Countess travelled to New York City to attend the 63rd session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). The annual event brought together more than 9,000 gender equality representatives from around the world. The CSW is \"the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.\"[53] From 29 April to 3 May 2019, the Countess, Vice-Patron of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, visited India in her final overseas tour as vice-patron ahead of the Trust's planned closure in January 2020. Sophie saw the work the charitable foundation has supported to tackle avoidable blindness and heard about programmes successfully launched by Queen's Young Leaders.[54]\n\nIn July 2019, the Earl and Countess visited Forfar on their first official visit to the town since the Queen granted the Earl the additional title Earl of Forfar in March 2019.[55] Later in October, Sophie visited Kosovo to meet victims of sexual violence after the Kosovo War and their families.[56] By the end of 2019, Sophie had completed 236 official engagements.[18] In March 2020, Sophie became the first member of the royal family to visit South Sudan. During the visit, which was requested by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sophie met victims and survivors of gender-based violence and promoted their rights by meeting the female political leaders in the country.[57]\n\nIn January 2022, the Countess went on a solo visit to Qatar in her capacity as the global ambassador for the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) to support the organisation's '2030 in Sight' initiative and visit projects by the Qatar Fund and Orbis International aimed at improving eye tests and treatments in India and Bangladesh.[58] As a supporter of the Women Peace and Security Network she met with Afghan women refugees who had been evacuated from the country following the 2021 Taliban offensive.[58] In March 2022, Sophie went on a four-day solo trip to New York City, visiting the Queen Elizabeth II September 11th Garden and Consuls General from across the Commonwealth to mark the Commonwealth Day.[59] She also delivered the keynote address on women's rights in Afghanistan at an event hosted by the UN Women and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.[59]\n\nIn April 2022, Edward and Sophie toured Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.[60] Their planned visit to Grenada was postponed after talks with the island's government and governor general, and the couple expressed their hopes to visit the country on a later date.[61] In October 2022, she visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo to engage with projects preventing sexual and gender-based violence in conflict, becoming the first member of the royal family to visit the country.[62] The tour also included visits to Rwanda, Botswana, and Malawi.[63][64] After her husband was created Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, Sophie and Edward visited Edinburgh to meet with members of the Ukrainian and Eastern European communities in the city, some of whom were displaced following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[65] In May 2023, Sophie visited Iraq at the request of the Foreign Office to promote the Women, Peace and Security agenda and raise awareness about conflict-related sexual violence.[66] She became the first member of the royal family to visit Baghdad.[67] On 29 April 2024, the Duchess visited Ukraine, the first British royal to make the trip since the Russian invasion, where she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyi.

The Appeal aims to create a memorial dedicated to the 1,500 nurses who gave their lives in First and Second World Wars.[112] In February 2018, Westmorland Agricultural Society welcomed the Countess as its president.[113] In January 2019, Sophie became the patron of the Thames Valley Air Ambulance, which saved her life during her ectopic pregnancy in 2001.[114] On 29 January, she was elected president of the Royal Smithfield Club, which promotes the education and knowledge to advance best practice in the meat and livestock industry.[115] On International Women's Day March 2019, Sophie officially announced her involvement in taking a stand against sex crimes in conflict zones, joining Angelina Jolie to work with the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI) as well as Women, Peace and Security (WPS) formed 20 years ago to tackle the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, and to promote the positive role women play in building peace and stability.[116] On 25 April 2019, it was announced that the Countess, along with her husband and her brother-in-law, the Duke of York, have each been appointed vice president of the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show.[117] In May 2019, she took over the patronage of the Chartered Management Institute from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[118]\n\nIn April 2020, the Countess helped Rhubarb, a catering company, in preparing and delivering food to NHS staff amidst the coronavirus pandemic, an initiative organised by Ian Wace.[119] Sophie has also volunteered at local food banks, including the Hope Hub and the Lighthouse, in Surrey and delivered parcels to the homeless during the pandemic.[120] In September 2020, Sophie, alongside her husband and children, participated in the Great British Beach Clean at Southsea Beach in support of the Marine Conservation Society.[121][122]\n\nIn February 2021, as grand president of St John Ambulance, the Countess started working as a care volunteer at an NHS vaccination centre.[123] In May 2021, Sophie become royal patron of Wellbeing of Women, a charity focused on all areas of women's reproductive health across a woman's life course, from menstrual health to menopause.[124] A patron of this charity, she later discussed her own struggles with menopause and how it affected her memory.[125] In July 2021, Princess Alexandra handed over the patronage of The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association to Sophie.[126] In December 2022, Sophie was honoured at the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, where she received the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for her work concerning sexual violence in war zones.[127]\n\nPublic image and style\n\nAt the start of her relationship with Prince Edward, Sophie was referred to as \"the girl next door\", and noted for her successful career and ordinary background.[128] In the early years of her marriage, Sophie faced public scrutiny for her business interests, and was often compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died two years earlier.[129][130][131] On her transition to becoming a full-time royal, she later stated: \"Certainly it took me a while to find my feet. The frustration was I had to reduce my expectations of what I could actually do. I couldn't turn up at a charity and go, right, I think you should be doing this, because that's what I was used to doing in my working life. I had to take a really big step back and go, OK, they want you to be the icing on the cake, the person to come in to thank their volunteers and funders, not necessarily to tell them how to run their communications plan.\"[132]\n\nSophie has since been cited as an under-the-radar \"stabilizing influence\" and a \"safe pair of hands\".[132] She has been said to have a low-key approach to royal engagements, and often drives herself to and from events.[133] Amanda Pullinger stated to Town and Country, \"She actually presents herself as an ordinary person and I think that is increasingly what the royal family needs to do.\"[134] She has also been noted for her long-term work on \"gritty\" subject matters such as gender-based violence in conflict, and trips to \"difficult areas\", such as South Sudan and Sierra Leone.[133][135] The Countess's engagements gained significant attention from the public post-Megxit, with her charity work and style choices receiving increased commentary and analysis.[136][137] Writer Ingrid Seward states that Sophie \"is not a self-publicist....She looks good, without being over-the-top, and she's not craving celebrity. You often wouldn't know she had carried out all those engagements.\"[138]\n\nSophie was not initially prominent for her fashion, but eventually began to develop her own style and has worn outfits by many notable designers.[139] She has exclusively worn Jane Taylor millinery designs since 2009 on numerous occasions.[140] In a Marie Claire interview, Taylor described her first royal commission: \"My first royal client was the Countess of Wessex, and it was quite nerve-racking. But she wears such lovely clothes and she always looks so fabulous, so it's quite easy to design for her. Since she came to see me, she's never worn any other milliner's hats, which is a big compliment. I was really excited, honored, and slightly nervous.\"[141] Alongside the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex, Sophie has been named one of the most stylish members of the royal family.[139][142] Sophie is particularly known for wearing different combinations of hats and coats, and favours silk dresses and frocks.[142] Describing her style in an interview by Sunday Express Sophie said: \"It's about my charities, but I recognize that I'm on display. [...] When you walk into a room, yes, people are going to talk about what you're doing there, but they're also going to want to know what you're wearing\".[143] She also revealed that she has never had a stylist of her own and that she makes her fashion choices herself.[144] In 2015, the Countess was named on Vanity Fair's Best Dressed List.[145] Together with the then-Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during the 2018 London Fashion Week.[146]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nViolation of privacy\n\nIn May 1999, less than a month before her wedding, The Sun published a photo of a topless Sophie with her Capital Radio colleague Chris Tarrant, which was taken during a business trip to Spain in 1988.[147][148][149] Buckingham Palace immediately issued a statement saying, \"This morning's story in The Sun is a gross invasion of privacy and cannot be regarded as in the public interest. It has caused considerable distress.\"[147][149] Prime Minister Tony Blair also condemned the publication of the photograph.[147][148] The Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC).[147][148] According to Sophie's business partner the incident had left her \"distressed\", and she was reportedly \"devastated\" and felt \"she was 'letting the side down' before her wedding\".[147][149][150] Tarrant later said, \"There was never, ever the slightest hint of romance between Sophie and myself, let alone these snidey insinuations.\"[147] Following its publication, the newspaper issued a statement and apologised to Rhys-Jones[147] and the next issue came out with the headline \"Sorry, Sophie\".[148] It also said that it would again apologise to Sophie in a letter and donate all sale proceeds of the issue to her charities.[148][151] The photo was sold to the tabloid by Kara Noble, a former friend and colleague of Sophie.[147][148] Noble later apologised in the following months saying, \"I just want to say sorry to everyone who was involved.\"[152] Both she and the newspaper faced criticism from the public,[147] and Noble was fired from her job at Heart 106.2 FM.[149] The couple later decided not to make a formal complaint.[151]\n\nIn 2011, close associates of Jonathan Rees, a private investigator connected to the News International phone hacking scandal, stated that he had penetrated Sophie and Edward's bank accounts and sold details about them to the Sunday Mirror.[153]\n\nMedia sting\n\nIn April 2001, Sophie appeared in the media after she was misled in a meeting at the Dorchester by a News of the World reporter posing as an Arab sheikh, Mazher Mahmood,[154][155] who was later exposed for perjury in Southwark Crown Court.[156] It was claimed by the newspapers that during their \"secretly taped\" conversation, the Countess had insulted the royal family and politicians, calling the Queen \"old dear\" and criticising the leadership of prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.[154][155][157] She also reportedly commented on Prince Charles's relationship with his then-partner Camilla, arguing that a marriage would not be possible as long as the Queen Mother was alive.[157] However, despite some initial reports, the paper acquitted her of referring to Cherie Blair as \"absolutely horrid\" and mocking Leader of the Opposition William Hague's appearance.[158] Murray Harkin, Sophie's business partner who was also present at the meeting, was recorded discussing his sex life and cocaine use and boasting about Sophie's abilities in securing celebrities for various events.[158] Tabloid newspapers claimed the Countess had sent apology letters to Blair, Hague and Prince Charles.[154]\n\nBuckingham Palace denied the accuracy of the reports, saying: \"The Countess of Wessex, who is trying to pursue her own career, is obviously vulnerable to set-ups such as this.\"[154] The Palace released a statement saying the reported comments were \"selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue\".[154] The Palace officials stated that Sophie had not insulted the Queen, the Queen Mother, or the politicians, while according to the Mail on Sunday four reliable sources had confirmed these reports.[154] The News of the World attributed the negative reactions to the jealousy of the rival media, as the outlet had previously conducted an interview with Sophie in which she addressed the rumours about her difficulties in marriage and discussed her husband's sexuality.[154] Sophie had reportedly agreed to the intimate interview on the condition that the newspaper would not publish transcript of the tapes.[159][160] In a separate statement Sophie said she was \"distressed by the carrying out of an entrapment operation\" on her, but also regretted her \"own misjudgment in succumbing to that subterfuge\".[158] Subsequently, in 2002, both the Earl and Countess announced that they would quit their business interests in order to focus on activities and official engagements on behalf of the royal family and aid the Queen in her Golden Jubilee year.[161]\n\nJewellery gifts\n\nThe Countess of Wessex was criticised for accepting two sets of jewels from the royal family of Bahrain during an official day-long[162] visit to the country in December 2011, as she and her husband returned to the UK from a trip to Afghanistan. She was given one set by Bahrain's king and a second set by the country's prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa. Her husband, the Earl, received a pen and a watch as well as a silk rug from the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who also gave Sophie a silver and pearl cup. The value of the jewellery has not been estimated and its precise contents were not disclosed.[163] Given concern about human rights abuses in Bahrain, this gift attracted controversy, with calls for the jewels to be sold, and the proceeds used for the benefit of the Bahraini people.[164]\n\nCritics said the Countess should sell the gems and give the proceeds to political protesters in Bahrain. Denis MacShane, then a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) and previously a Foreign Office minister, said: \"Given the appalling suffering and repression of the Bahraini people, it would be a fitting gesture for the Countess of Wessex to auction these trinkets and distribute the proceeds to the victims of the regime.\"[163]\n\nRoyal family guidelines and procedures relating to gifts, published by the government in 2003, state that \"before accepting any gift, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gift and the nature of the gift itself ... Equally, before declining the offer of a gift, careful consideration should be given to any offence that might be caused by such action.\"[162]\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nTitles and styles\n\nSophie was styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Countess of Wessex\" from her marriage in 1999 to 2023.

Prior to marrying Prince Edward her father Christopher Rhys-Jones had arms redesigned by Sir Peter Gwynn-Jones, Garter King of Arms, based on a 200-year-old family blazon never previously recognised. The new grant of arms included a remainder to Christopher's elder brother Theo Rhys-Jones and issue. About her new family coat of arms, Sophie is quoted saying: \"It's wonderful, I'm absolutely thrilled\", \"It's not modern and different, because it is representative of my family's heritage, so it's in keeping with that.\"[188]\n\nAdopted\n\n1999\n\nCoronet\n\nCoronet of a child of the Sovereign.\n\nEscutcheon\n\nQuarterly, 1st and 4th Gules three Lions passant guardant in pale Or armed and langed Azure, 2nd Or a Lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a Double Tressure flory counterflory of the Second, 3rd Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent, the whole differenced with a Label of three Points Argent with the central Point charged with a Tudor Rose (Royal Arms differenced for Prince Edward); impaled with a Shield quarterly Gules and Azure a Lion rampant regardant within an Orle Or (for Rhys-Jones).\n\nSupporters\n\nDexter, a Lion rampant gardant Or crowned with the Coronet of the rank of a child of the Sovereign Proper; Sinister, a Wyvern Azure gorged with a Coronet Or composed of Crosses pattées and Fleurs-de-lis a Chain affixed also Or.\n\nMotto\n\nCAS GŴR NI CHÂR Y WLAD A'I MACO\n\n(Welsh: Hateful the man who loves not the country that nurtured him)\n\nOrders\n\nSurrounding the Shield, the Royal Victorian Order circlet inscribed with its motto: VICTORIA;\n\nBehind the Shield, the Badge of the Order of St John:\n\nMaltese Cross (optional).\n\nOther elements\n\nIn Chief, as an augmentation of honour, the arms of the Order of St John (for GCStJ);\n\nGCVO insignia suspended below the Shield (optional).\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe Duchess's family arms allude to her family's Welsh heritage and one of her noble ancestors the warrior Elystan Glodrydd, Prince of Ferrig (represented by the lion).
