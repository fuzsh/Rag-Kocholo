        "text": "Prince Edward, duke of Edinburgh (born March 10, 1964, London, England) is the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh.\n\nEdward has three older siblings: Charles, Anne, and Andrew. He attended Gordonstoun School, a spartan boarding school in Scotland, and studied history at Jesus College, Cambridge. After Cambridge, he joined the Royal Marines but resigned his commission in 1987 in the middle of commando training. He worked briefly for musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber before setting up his own theatrical production company. This collapsed in 1991 with debts of £600,000 (almost $1 million). In 1993 he set up Ardent Productions, Ltd., which survived—mainly through making programs about the royal family’s past history, though seldom earning profits—until it folded in 2009. Despite these ups and downs, Edward won respect for his attempts to be the first child of a British monarch to seek a career in the private sector.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nPrince William and Catherine Middleton: The Royal Wedding of 2011: Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones"
