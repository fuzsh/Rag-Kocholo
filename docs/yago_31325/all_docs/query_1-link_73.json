His assassination in Sarajevo precipitated the Austrian declaration of war. This caused countries allied with Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers) and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente Powers) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.\n\nFull Name: Franz Ferdinand Karl Giuermo Anikò Strezpek Belschwitz Mòric Pinche Bálint Szilveszter Gömpi Maurice Bzoch János Frajkor Ludwig van Haverbeke Josef von Habsburg-Lothringen , was born in Graz, Austria, the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria (younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph and Maximilian I of Mexico) and of his second wife, Princess Maria Annunciata of the Two Sicilies. When he was only twelve years old, his cousin Duke Francis V of Modena died, naming Franz Ferdinand his heir on condition that he add the name Este to his own. Franz Ferdinand thus became one of the wealthiest men in Austria.\n\nWhen he was born, there was no reason to think that Franz Ferdinand would ever be heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. He was given the normal strict education of an archduke with an emphasis on history and moral character. From 1876 to 1885 his tutor was the historian Onno Klopp. In 1883 Franz Ferdinand entered the army with the rank of third lieutenant.\n\nAs a young man, Franz Ferdinand developed two great passions: hunting and travel. It is estimated that he shot more than 5,000 deer in his lifetime. In 1883, he visited Italy for the first time in order to see the properties left to him by Duke Francis V of Modena. In 1885, he visited Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey. In 1889, he visited Germany.\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here.\n\nSophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, born Sophie Maria Josephine Albina Chotek, Countess of Chotkova and Wognin (March 1, 1868 - June 28, 1914). She died at the age of 46. She is the morganatic wife of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Their assassination sparked World War I. (de: Sophie Maria Josephine Albina Chotek Gräfin von Chotkova und Wognin, later the Fürstin von Hohenberg, since 1909 Herzogin von Hohenberg, cs: Žofie Marie Josefína Albína hraběnka Chotková z Chotkova a Vojnína, later the kněžna z Hohenbergu, since 1909 vévodkyně z Hohenbergu)\n\nSophie was born in Stuttgart to a prominent Bohemian aristocratic family. She was the fourth daughter of Count Bohuslaw Chotek von Chotkova und Wognin and of his wife, Countess Wilhelmine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau. As a young woman, Sophie became lady-in-waiting to the Archduchess Isabella, wife of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen. It is unknown where Sophie first met Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, though many claim a ball in Prague.\n\nSophie and Franz Ferdinand kept their relationship a secret for years. When Franz Ferdinand began to make regular visits to the home of Archduke Friedrich, it was assumed that he had fallen in love with his eldest daughter, Marie Christine. When the relationship was discovered by Archduchess Isabella a public scandal was created.\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph made it clear to Franz Ferdinand that he could not marry Sophie. To be an eligible partner for a member of the Austro-Hungarian imperial family, one must be a member of one of the reigning or formerly reigning dynasties of Europe. The Choteks were not one of these families, although they did include among their ancestors in the female line princes of Baden, Hohenzollern-Hechingen, and Liechtenstein. Ironically one of Sophia's direct ancestors was Count Albrecht IV of Hapsburg; she was descended from Elisabeth von Hapsburg a sister of King Rudolph I of Germany.\n\nFranz Ferdinand insisted he would not marry anyone else. Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Pope Leo XIII all made representations to Franz Joseph on Franz Ferdinand's behalf arguing that the disagreement was undermining the stability of the monarchy.\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here.\n\nHere are some photos ( from Imageshack): Franz Ferdinand with Sophie,their daughter Sophie and with their three children .\n\nI wonder what would his wife's status would be when he ascended at the throne. I know he couldn't make her Kaiserin ( or he would go through hell from the other archdukes) but could he give her a higher title? I also wonder how his children would be viewed. For example Sophie seems quite beautiful. Would she have the opportunity to make a royal match or she would be looked down upon because of her morganatic status?\n\nAttachments\n\nFranzSophie.jpg\n\nSophie.jpg\n\nfamily.jpg\n\nHe is the emperor. That means everybody has to do what he want. That sounds weird, but Franz Jopseh did that without mercy. All archdukes and archuduchesse had the choice between a life at the court or a free life outside. And the most wanted a comfy life.\n\nI read somewhere, that FF wanted to change the rules, after FJ death. So Sophie had become Empress and the eldest son crownprince, later Emperor. Maybe the monarchy had live longer under FF. He wasn´t so narrow-minded. But who knows.\n\nAfter their parents' murder, the three children Sophie, Maximilian and Ernst lived with their maternal uncle (and close friend of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) the Prince of Thun-Hohenstein, who was the husband of Sophie's sister.\n\nBoth Ernst and Maximilian, but especially the latter one, were strong opposers of Anschluss and Nazi regime; they also worked closely to Archduke Otto, who was himself working for restoring the Monarchy in Austria and Hungary (and was strongly hated by Hitler). For these reasons, in 1938 they and their sister Sophie were imprisoned in Dachau concentration camp, where they remained until the end of World War II.\n\nPrincess Sophie (1901-1990) married in 1920 to Count Friedrich von Nostitz-Rieneck, with whom she had three sons and a daughter; the eldest son, Erwein, died in 1949 in a Soviet prisoner of war camp; the second son, Franz, was killed in action during the war.\n\nPrince Ernst (1904-1954) married in 1936 to Marie-Therese Wood, and they had two sons together, Prince Franz and Prince Ernst, both married with issue.\n\nDuke Maximilian (1902-1962) married in 1926 to Countess Maria Elisabeth von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee, and they became parents of six children, all sons: Franz Ferdinand, Georg, Albrecht, Johannes, Peter Gerhard.\n\nAt Duke Maximilian's death in 1962, he was succeeded as Duke of Hohenberg by his eldest son, Franz Ferdinand (1927-1977); he married in 1956 to Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg and Bourbon-Parma, daughter of Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg and her husband Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma; they had two daughters, Anita and Sophie.\n\nSince Franz Ferdinand had no sons, he was succeeded by his brother Georg, born in 1929, who is the present Duke of Hohenberg; he served as Austrian Ambassador to the Holy See and retired a few years ago.\n\nHe married in 1960 to Princess Eleonore of Auersperg-Breunner, and they have three children: Prince Nikolaus, Princess Henriette and Prince Maximilian; the two sons are married and with issue, while Henriette is unmarried.\n\nConsidering that the Imperial Family was very large, with dozens of Archdukes in the line of succession, and that a large part of them or at least some very influential were against FF and Sophie's marriage, I think it would be rather unlikely that as Emperor he would upgrade her and their children.\n\nI think it's more likely that he would do something to improve Sophie's social conditions and to mitigate the consequences of the morganatic marriage, that were somehow rather heavy and humiliating for her.\n\nAccording to Noblesse & Royautes, there is a new book about Archduke Franz Ferdinand entitled \"The Assassination of the Archduke\". It is written by Sue Woolmans and Greg King and is in English. Noblesse & Royautes asked her (Sue Woolmans) if the book will be published in French, and she said no, but it will be published in Polish, Czech and Portuguese. They also asked her what her sources are and she said that the current Duke of Hohenberg, Prince Georg, gave her permission to visit Haus Hof und Staatsarchiv, where the main archives about the Archduke are located. Sue Woolmans also says that other members of the Hohenberg family allowed her to look at their family archives. More of the interview, photos and information about Franz Ferdinand can be found here:\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nAs far as I can remember, I once read (I think on another forum) that in the 1880s Emperor Franz Josef wanted an union between his family and the Royal House of Saxony.\n\nHe firstly suggested a marriage between his son Rudolf and Princess Mathilde of Saxony, a daughter of King Georg, but Rudolf refused it because he found Mathilde unattractive. Rudolf later married to Princess Stephanie of Belgium.\n\nThe Emperor then suggested a marriage between his nephew Franz Ferdinand and Princess Mathilde, and again Mathilde was refused because also Franz Ferdinand found her unattractive.\n\nAt that point both Princess Mathilde and her father Georg became quite angry, because of these two refusals, but Franz Josef still wanted his Austrian-Saxon marriage. So he proposed that his other nephew Archduke Otto married to another daughter of Georg, the pretty Princess Maria Josepha, and this time finally the proposal was accepted.\n\nAs far as I can remember, I once read (I think on another forum) that in the 1880s Emperor Franz Josef wanted an union between his family and the Royal House of Saxony.\n\nHe firstly suggested a marriage between his son Rudolf and Princess Mathilde of Saxony, a daughter of King Georg, but Rudolf refused it because he found Mathilde unattractive.

For these reasons, also her relations with her relatives became strained."
