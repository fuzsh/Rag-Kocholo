        "text": "The new Duchess of Edinburgh is a former public relations woman who fell in love with a prince and became very close to the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nSophie, formerly the Countess of Wessex, is married to Prince Edward, who has recently been conferred the title of Duke of Edinburgh that belonged to his late father, Prince Philip.\n\nShe is expected to attend the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla on Saturday 6 May with her husband and other members of the royal family.\n\nHer position in the royal family has become increasingly more important since the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and in recent years she has chosen to highlight challenging issues.\n\nIn 2019 she publicly committed herself to supporting the UK’s work helping victims of rape, sexual violence and exploitation in war.\n\nShe has also been working in other fields to promote women, having founded the Women’s Network Forum in 2014 which she chairs, and bringing together a cross-industry group of senior figures to promote gender balance and equality in the workplace.\n\nDuring the pandemic Sophie privately volunteered with a range of organisations.\n\nThe duchess was born Sophie Rhys-Jones and like the Princess of Wales hails from a middle-class background with her parents sending her to private schools.\n\nSophie has been a member of the royal family for almost 25 years after marrying Edward at St George’s Chapel Windsor on 19 June 1999.\n\nThey were brought together by a mutual passion for the ancient sport of real tennis and romance blossomed between Edward, 59, and Sophie, 58, who once worked for Capital Radio.\n\nProblems arose when Sophie tried to combine her life as a royal with her professional career.\n\nShe was caught in a ‘fake sheikh’ sting and accused of trying to use her status to promote her public relations business.\n\nThe “Sophiegate” newspaper controversy was hugely damaging, resulting in reports of indiscreet remarks about a string of public figures including Sir Tony Blair and Lord Hague.\n\nIt led to a lengthy inquiry into how working royals should be regulated and Sophie and Edward later stepped down from their individual careers to become full-time royals.\n\nThe couple have two children, Lady Louise Windsor, 19, and 15-year-old James, Viscount Severn, the new Earl of Wessex.\n\nWith her family she played a poignant role in the aftermath of the Duke of Edinburgh’s death giving a televised tribute to Philip.\n\nToday Sophie is patron of more than 70 charities and organisations, with interests including agriculture, fashion, supporting people with disabilities, and the prevention of avoidable blindness in developing countries."
