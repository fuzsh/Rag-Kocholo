        "text": "Prince Edward and Duchess Sophie’s children Lady Louise Windsor and James, Earl of Wessex (formerly Viscount Severn), represent a new generation of the British royal family.\n\nWhile Prince Edward and Sophie have been notably protective of their children’s privacy, as they’ve matured, Lady Louise and James have gradually taken on more public roles.\n\nHere we dive into the lives of Lady Louise Windsor and James, Earl of Wessex.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones married on 19 June 1999, at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle – meaning they’ll soon be celebrating their 25th anniversary!\n\nFour years later, Sophie gave birth to her first child, Louise, on November 8 2003. Born prematurely due to placental abruption, Louise was later diagnosed with esotropia, a condition causing internal eye misalignment. After receiving surgeries in 2006 and 2013, the condition has since been corrected.\n\n“It’s still not perfect, but none of us are,” Sophie said of the experience in an interview with The Sunday Times.\n\nThe family welcomed their second child, James, on December 17 2007, thankfully, with less complications.\n\nFrom their earliest days, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Earl of Wessex, grew up out of the public eye, allowing for a semblance of normalcy amidst the grandeur of their lineage.\n\nLady Louise’s educational career began at St George’s School in Windsor Castle before moving to St Mary’s School Ascot, a private Catholic girls’ school. Growing up, she developed a keen interest in equestrianism, likely influenced by her grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth’s passion for horses.\n\nShe has participated in carriage driving, a sport her grandfather, Prince Philip, was fond of. Similar to his sister, James attended St George’s School in Windsor before transferring to Eagle House School.\n\nEmerging into the public eye\n\nAs they have grown, both Lady Louise (20) and James (16) have become increasingly visible figures within the royal family, participating in public engagements and developing their own areas of interest and expertise.\n\nLady Louise, in particular, has caught the public’s eye with her maturity and commitment to service. In 2022 she started at the University of St Andrews in Scotland – Prince William and Princess Kate’s alma mater and meeting place.\n\nJames, although younger, is beginning to follow in his sister’s footsteps, showing early signs of a keen sense of duty with recent public appearances including his presence at King Charles and Queen Camilla’s coronation with his family.\n\nDuchess Sophie shed light on her children’s early influences in her The Sunday Times interview in 2020, stating, “We try to bring them up with the understanding they are very likely to have to work for a living. Hence, we made the decision not to use HRH titles.”\n\n“They have them and can decide to use them from 18, but it’s highly unlikely.”"
