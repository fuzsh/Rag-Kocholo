        "text": "King Charles III gave his youngest brother, Prince Edward, quite a gift for his 59th birthday.\n\nToday, March 10, Buckingham Palace announced the sovereign named Edward the Duke of Edinburgh, a title their late father, Prince Philip, held for most of his life.\n\nEdward's title change effectively makes his wife, Countess Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh. And, their son, James, Viscount Severn, now becomes the Earl of Wessex.\n\nThe palace has already updated the family's new titles on their line-of-succession website (despite the fact that it took them about six months to update those of the Sussex children).\n\nThe new Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will visit Edinburgh this afternoon, where they will attend a reception to commemorate the anniversary of the Ukraine–Russia war. (The British royal family has publicly shown their support for Ukraine amid the conflict.)\n\nDespite his new dukedom, Edward will also remain the Earl of Forfar, a title he will hold for his entire life. But because the dukedom of Edinburgh is the more senior Scottish title, it is the one the senior royal will use.\n\nViscount Severn will become the Earl of Wessex and Forfar when the title of the Duke of Edinburgh reverts to the Crown, per the palace.\n\n\"The dukedom was last created for Prince Philip in 1947, upon his marriage to Princess Elizabeth, who held the title of Duchess of Edinburgh before acceding to the throne in 1952,\" the palace said in a statement. \"The new Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh are proud to continue Prince Philip's legacy of promoting opportunities for young people of all backgrounds to reach their full potential.\""
