        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2017\n\nPrincess Sophie of the Netherlands was the wife of Grand Duke Karl Alexander of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. She was born Princess Wilhelmine Marie Sophie Luise on April 8, 1824, at Lange Voorhout Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands, the youngest child of King Willem II of the Netherlands and Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia.\n\nSophie had four elder siblings:\n\nKing Willem III of the Netherlands (1817-1890) – married (1) Sophie of Württemberg, had issue; (2) Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, had issue\n\nPrince Alexander of the Netherlands (1818-1848) – unmarried\n\nPrince Hendrik of the Netherlands (1820-1879) – married (1) Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, no issue; (2) Marie of Prussia, no issue\n\nPrince Ernst Casimir (born and died 1822) – died in infancy\n\nAt the Kneuterdijk Palace in The Hague, The Netherlands, on October 8, 1842, Sophie married Karl Alexander. The two were first cousins as their mothers were both daughters of Paul I, Emperor of All Russia. Sophie and Karl Alexander had four children:\n\nKarl August, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1844-1894) – married Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had issue\n\nPrincess Marie Alexandrine (1849-1922) – married Prince Heinrich VII Reuss of Köstritz, had issue\n\nPrincess Anna (1851-1859) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Sibylle (1854-1908) – married Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, no issue\n\nIn her new homeland, Sophie quickly threw herself into charity work. With her own significant wealth, she founded numerous schools and hospitals throughout the grand duchy. These included the first girls’ high school in Weimar, a training school for nurses, an institute for the blind and deaf, and numerous schools and shelters. She also – much more privately – supported countless churches and religious organizations.\n\nIn 1885, Sophie inherited the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, following the death of his youngest grandson, and she established the Goethe Society in Weimar. Four years later, she also inherited the works of Friedrich von Schiller from his descendants. She established the Goethe and Schiller Archive and had a large building constructed on the banks of the Ilm river to house and display the works.\n\nWhen Sophie’s brother, King Willem III of the Netherlands, died in 1890, the Dutch throne passed to his young daughter, Queen Wilhelmina. As Wilhelmina was only ten years old and had no younger siblings, Grand Duchess Sophie was first in line to inherit the Dutch throne. She was very close to her niece Wilhelmina, and her sister-in-law, Queen Emma, and made regular visits to the Netherlands to see them. Both Wilhelmina and Emma viewed Sophie as one of their closest confidantes and advisors, and took comfort in knowing that the throne would pass to her should something happen to Wilhelmina. However, that sense of comfort did not extend to Sophie’s grandson, the future Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Following Sophie’s death, he became heir-presumptive until the birth of Wilhelmina’s daughter, Juliana in 1909.\n\nIn a way, Sophie was also instrumental in the marriage of her niece. It was at Sophie and Karl Alexander’s 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1892 that Wilhelmina first met her future husband, Duke Heinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His elder half-brother was married to Sophie’s daughter, Elisabeth. Wilhelmina and Heinrich went on to marry in 1901.\n\nAfter the death of her son in 1894, Sophie’s health began to deteriorate. The Grand Duchess died in Weimar, Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, now in Thuringia, Germany, on March 23, 1897. She was buried in the Weimarer Fürstengruft in the Historical Cemetery in Weimar.\n\nSaxe-Weimar-Eisenach Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\nGrand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach Index\n\nProfiles: Grand Dukes and Consorts of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nSaxe-Weimar-Eisenach Royal Burial Sites\n\nSaxe-Weimar-Eisenach Royal Dates"
