        "text": "When Sophie Rhys-Jones was introduced to the world, she was labelled by some as 'the new Princess Diana', her similarity to the late royal obvious to all.\n\nWhile the now-Duchess of Edinburgh, 59, certainly seems to have taken a leaf out of Diana's book when it comes to her charity work, the royal has forged her own path.\n\nSophie and Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh, have been happily married for the past 25 years and Edward, 56, remains the only one of the Queen's children who hasn't gotten divorced.\n\nThey have also dedicated their lives to helping others, as well as raising responsible, socially conscious children.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Kate's Trooping the Colour outfit gave us deja vu\n\nAs the couple celebrates their 25th wedding anniversary, let's take a look back at Sophie and Edward – from the moment they met to their long courtship and some of the bumps they have faced along the road to become two of the most popular, hardest-working members of the British royal family.\n\nBackground and career\n\nWhile Diana grew up mixing with the royals, owing to her father John Spencer's nobility as the 8th Earl Spencer, Sophie came from a middle-class background.\n\nBoth of her parents worked – her mother as a secretary and as a charity worker and her father as a salesman in rubber goods – and she has an older brother named David, 58.\n\nREAD MORE: British royal family unite for history-making traditional ceremony\n\nIt could be that Sophie learned early on how to exercise her social conscious through the example her mother set through her own charity work.\n\nSophie also followed in her mother's career footsteps at first, becoming a secretary before entering public relations, which became her passion.\n\nSophie's work in public relationship started in the UK and then took her to Switzerland and Australia before she returned home and began working for Capital Radio.\n\nA look at the timeless style of Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh\n\nHow they met\n\nSophie met Prince Edward in 1987 while working at Capitol Radio; she was 22 and he was 23. At the time, Edward was dating a friend of Sophie's.\n\nThey met up again six years later at a tennis charity event, and this time both were single. Sophie and Edward got along famously and soon after they began secretly dating.\n\nRoyal author Ingrid Seward, who wrote the book Prince Edward, says the couple almost broke up a year into their relationship after Edward got cold feet, realising this was a serious relationship that could lead to marriage.\n\nREAD MORE: Why everyone's talking about Lady Louise Windsor\n\nThey managed to get back on track and spent the next few years getting to know each other better before taking the next step.\n\nEdward proposed with an engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond made by Asprey and Garrard, worth £105,000 (AUD$184,398).\n\nIn 1999, the couple announced their engagement, two yeas after Princess Diana's death in a Paris car crash.\n\nThe new Diana\n\nSophie's similar hairstyle and quiet demeanour led to comparisons to the late Princess Diana in those early days, which also led to concerns over how the young woman would cope with royal life.\n\nWith the support of Edward, who shared her desire to steer clear of the spotlight unless fulfilling royal duties, they forged ahead and Sophie was able to learn her place in the monarchy and make the most of it.\n\nEven in her charity work Sophie has emulated Princess Diana, taking on causes previous royals have shied away from, including sexual violence and conflict in South Sudan.\n\nDiana had also spent time working in Africa, famously campaigning against land mines in Angola.\n\nWhen asked about the comparison in their charity work, Sophie told The Sunday Times: \"I'm not able to raise the profile by that extent. I'm not going to be able to change things the way she did, but I hope it keeps it from sliding off the agenda. I won't let it, it's too important.\"\n\nNude photo scandal\n\nAs Sophie was planning her wedding to Prince Edward, she was subjected to a nude photo scandal at the hands of a former friend and work colleague who 'shopped' photos of her sunbaking topless during a work trip to The Sun. Edward reportedly knew about the photos for some time and was assured by Sophie her friend would never betray her by making them public.\n\nSophie was reportedly devastated and humiliated by the scandal. Buckingham Palace was quick to respond in support of her, calling the sale of the photos \"premeditated cruelty\". The Palace made a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission.\n\nRELATED: Most shocking royal scandals\n\nSingle word from Meghan led to 'yawning silence'\n\nTheir full statement read: \"This morning's story in The Sun is a gross invasion of privacy and cannot be regarded as in the public interest.\n\n\"Prince Edward and Miss Rhys-Jones are very grateful to those members of the public who have telephoned offering support, which naturally is also our immediate concern. We shall, of course, be considering further action and no options have been ruled out.\"\n\nThe Sun editor at the time, David Yelland, issued an apology. He said: \"We clearly upset Miss Rhys-Jones. I have therefore decided to apologise to her and to the Palace.\"\n\nIt was later revealed the photos of Sophie sunbaking topless were taken and sold by former friend and work colleague Kara Noble, who was subsequently sacked from her position as co-host of Heart 106.2's breakfast show.\n\nThe royal wedding\n\nPrince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones were married on June 19, 1999 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. They became the Earl and Countess of Wessex.\n\nTheir choice of venue for the nuptials was a break in tradition, with most royals choosing much larger Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral to tie the knot.\n\nREAD MORE: Tragic story behind new Diana photo: 'We were very much in it together'\n\nEdward and Sophie were happy with the smaller venue and chose to spend their honeymoon at Balmoral Castle before moving to their home, Bagshot Park in Surrey.\n\nWhile Bagshot Park is the couple's main residence, their office and official London residence is at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAdjusting to royal life\n\nSophie later admitted to struggling to adjust to royal life. Both Sophie and Edward continued their careers following their union, with Sophie going on to start her own PR firm and Edward focusing on his TV and theatre production work.\n\nThe duchess spoke to The Sunday Times about her first few years as an official member of the monarchy, saying it took her a while to find her feet.\n\n\"Certainly it took me a while to find my feet,\" she confessed. \"The frustration was I had to reduce my expectations of what I could actually do. I couldn't turn up at a charity and go, right, I think you should be doing this, because that's what I was used to doing in my working life.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Hanging on by a thread': Battle awaiting Kate as she returns\n\n\"I had to take a really big step back and go, OK, they want you to be the icing on the cake, the person to come in to thank their volunteers and funders, not necessarily to tell them how to run their communications plan.\"\n\nAnother scandal\n\nIn April 2001, Sophie was the victim of media entrapment when News of the World journalist Mazher Dorchester posted as an Arab sheikh and secretly recorded their conversation. This led the couple to resign from their business interests to become full-time working royals.\n\nDuring the conversation Sophie was enticed to discuss members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth as well as politicians, namely British Prime Minister Tony Blair's wife Cherie Blair.\n\nThe newspaper alleged that during the recorded converstaion Sophie called the Queen \"old dear\", referred to Cherie Blair as \"horrid\" and criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\n\nSophie reportedly sent apology letters to each of them after the story broke and Buckingham Palace was quick to slam the actions of the journalist and publication.\n\n\"The Countess of Wessex, who is trying to pursue her own career, is obviously vulnerable to set-ups such as this,\" they said in a statement. They claimed her comments were \"selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue\".\n\nThe Palace denied claims Sophie had insulted the Queen, the Queen mother and politicians.\n\nDifficult path to parenthood\n\nPrince Edward and Sophie's road to parenthood hasn't been an easy one, with the Countess suffering a dangerous ectopic pregnancy in 2001.\n\nSophie was taken to King Edward VII Hospital after feeling unwell. She underwent two-and-a-half emergency surgery.\n\nIn September 2020, Sophie visited Thames Valley Air Ambulance who had flown her to hospital during the health crisis. She became a patron of the service after they saved her life.\n\nIn 2003, Edward and Sophie welcomed their first child, Lady Louise, although she was delivered early after Sophie suffered a sudden placental abruption which led to an emergency caesarean at Frimley Park Hospital. Prince Edward had been in Mauritius at the time and rushed back to be by his wife's side.\n\nShe recovered well and they went on to have a second child, James, Viscount Severn, in December 2007.\n\nFull-time royals\n\nSince leaving their careers to focus on their royal duties, Prince Edward and Sophie have become steadying influences on the monarchy. Sophie in particular has stepped up since the coronavirus pandemic hit in early 2020, becoming one of the first royals to check in with patrons via Zoom on a regular basis.\n\nBoth were pictured helping charity organisations working to support Brits during the pandemic. In December they joined volunteers at FoodWise TLC, a Surrey based charity providing cooking courses to those on low incomes. While there, the royals helped prepare meals for families living locally as well.\n\nSophie is now known as one of the hardest working members of the British royal family, taking on up to 200 engagements each year and working with over 70 charities. Her charity work focuses on people with disabilities, women's rights, avoidable blindness and agriculture.\n\nThe couple launched a foundation called The Wessex Youth Trust in 1999 to support Prince Edward's focus on youth and their development as he followed in his father Prince Philip's footsteps. They later changed the name of their foundation to The Wessex Foundation to better reflect both their work. It closed in 2023.\n\nEdward took on additional duties since his father, the late Prince Philip's retirement from royal duties, becoming president of the Commonwealth Games Federation and taking over the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. He and wife Sophie were also granted new titles, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, after the Queen's death in 2022."
