        "text": "Congrats to Prince Edward and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, who celebrate their silver wedding anniversary today.\n\nTo mark 25 years of marriage the couple released a new portrait photograph depicting the duke with his arms around his stunning wife.\n\nThe couple, who have two children – Lady Louise Windsor (20) and son James, Earl of Wessex (16) – are dressed down in the relaxed shot which was snapped in the gardens of their Bagshot Park home in Surrey.\n\nIn March Sophie gave a touching tribute to her husband ahead of his 60th birthday, describing him as “the best of fathers, the most loving of husbands . . . [and] still my best friend”.\n\nIn an interview on the ITV show Love Your Weekend earlier this year, Edward described Sophie as his “rock”.\n\nTestament to their enduring love story is the fact that Edward is the only one of the late queen’s children who has not divorced.\n\nKing Charles divorced Princess Di in 1994, Princess Anne divorced her first husband, Mark Phillips, in 1992 and Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996.\n\nRomance bloomed when Edward met Sophie while she was working in PR at an event in the early '90s.\n\nThey married on 19 June 1999 at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nEdward has described them as having a “brilliant partnership”.\n\nThey’ve given decades of service to the crown and continue to do so. In fact, they have established a reputation as a safe and reliable pair of hands, quietly getting on with the job with no fuss or drama.\n\nA 2020 documentary called Edward and Sophie: The Reluctant Royals explores their role within The Firm with Rebecca English, the Daily Mail’s royal editor saying, “They’re not showy people, a lot of what they’ve done has been under the radar.”\n\nThe couple are associated with over 150 charities around the world and carry out more than 500 engagements combined each year.\n\nIn recent years they’ve become invaluable as Prince Andrew and Prince Harry no longer perform any official duties, and they've stepped up in the midst of Charles and Kate, Princess of Wales, being treated for cancer\n\nIn recent years they’ve become even more invaluable with Charles and his daughter-in-law Kate, Princess of Wales, being treated for cancer and Prince Andrew and Prince Harry no longer performing any official duties.\n\nThe couple joined the king and other senior royals at the weekend for Trooping the Colour.\n\nSpeaking about their 20-plus years of service, Sophie told The Telegraph, “Inevitably the spotlight and the focus falls on younger members as time goes on. We’ve plodded along doing what we’re doing, hopefully doing it well.\"\n\nTheir daughter, Louise, turns 21 this year and is being tipped as someone who could possibly step up to help support the crown given its reduced ranks and Charles and Kate’s illnesses.\n\nRoyal expert Richard Eden says, “In my opinion, another great service the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh could do for the country is to encourage their children to become working royals when the time is right.\"\n\nLouise is currently in her second year at St Andrews University in Scotland while James will sit his GCSE exams this year.\n\n“When Prince William becomes king I hope he will follow the example of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and ask his cousins to share royal duties with him,” Richard adds.\n\n“What better way to build on the monarchy’s strengths than with an injection of energy from young people who have had values of public service and duty instilled in them since birth?”"
