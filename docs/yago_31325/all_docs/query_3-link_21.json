        "text": "Happy Silver Wedding Anniversary to the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh!\n\nCan you believe it's been 25 years today since Prince Edward tied the knot with his fianc√©e Sophie Rhys-Jones? To celebrate the momentous occasion, yesterday the palace released a new portrait of the couple embracing and posing in the gardens of their Surrey home, looking very much still in love. The casual nature of the portrait is totally reflective of Edward and Sophie's low-key style, and their own (relatively speaking, in royal terms) no-frills wedding back in June 1999.\n\nTheir church ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle marked the last British royal wedding of the millennium. Edward, then 35, and Sophie, 34, had requested a simple family day with no pageantry and little pomp, and they got their wish."
