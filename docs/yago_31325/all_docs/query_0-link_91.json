        "text": "Yesterday I took the train and went two hours to see an exhibition about Eugène (in February 2024 was the 200th anniversary of his death) that I could have seen in a small museum almost in my neighborhood from March to June, at a time when I just could not make it due to being overwhelmed with work. It was only two rooms, mostly display boards and photos, overall rather superficial, with several mistakes - but also some very nice illustrations I had not seen before.\n\nThe funniest part was that, when I had seen the exhibition and was about to leave the museum, another elderly lady adressed me, telling me there would be a guided tour of the exhibition and outing herself as another Eugène fan. Between us, we probably knew more than the tour guide who, however, took it in really good humour. It was only him and the two of us, we took 90 minutes for what should probably have been a 30 to 45 minutes tour, and we really had a blast.\n\nUnfortunately my old tablet and myself are equally bad at taking photos.\n\nPictured above is a part of a dinner service sporting the typical \"E\".\n\nViceroy Eugène at the combat of Bruck an der Mur (1809) by Albrecht Adam\n\nTwo rooms of Eugène's Munich \"Leuchtenberg Palais\". The study room above painted by his son Auguste, the second one painted by his daughter Eugènie.\n\nSpeaking of the children, there was one painting showing all seven of the Leuchtenberg children:\n\nWith little Caroline who had died only a couple of months old as an angel in the clouds\n\nThe viceroy of Italy reviewing his troops (by Achille Bertarelli)\n\nSomething I personally found interesting:\n\nShoes worn by vicequeen Auguste von Bayern, painted and real\n\nAnd of course, another quote by the poor sacrificial lamb who had to marry that awful Frenchman for the sake of her fatherland:\n\n\"Finally reached Milan […]. Three beautiful festivities were held in our honour at the theatre […]. I was wonderfully received, and the Prince (Eugène) is charming to me. On the whole, he resembles you, which is a great asset in the eyes of your child.\"\n\nAuguste von Bayern to her father, 18 February 1806. That's not even five weeks into the marriage.\n\nmy somewhat unpopular opinion is that \"famous story retold from female character's pov\" is a good concept, actually. it's just that it became gimmicky very fast and spawned a storm of lazy works that refuse to engage with the source material in any meaningful way and flanderize everything into generic YA tropes. but at its core taking a known story and exploring it through the perspective of a female character even, and perhaps especially, when said character is not a particularly active agent on said story, is a way to remind people that women are still people with rich inner lives and that the real life women that we learned to think as pawns in the lives of men were/are still humans whose complex interiority deserve exploration on principle that everyone, but especially the people who live on the margins, deserve exploration. but that's a concept that gets defeated when most people writing those lazy retellings can't write complex interiority to save their lives."
