        "text": "Sophia Dorothea (born Sept. 13, 1666—died Nov. 23, 1726, Schloss Ahlden, Lower Saxony) was the wife of George Louis, elector of Hanover (George I of Great Britain), who accused her of infidelity and imprisoned her for 32 years.\n\nThe only child of George William, duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Celle, by a Huguenot lady named Eleanore d’Olbreuze, she was married, for dynastic reasons, to her cousin George Louis in 1682. The union was an unhappy one. Her mother-in-law, the electress Sophia, hated her, and this feeling was soon shared by the prince himself. Under these circumstances Sophia Dorothea made the acquaintance of Count Philipp Christoph von Königsmark, who assisted her in one or two futile attempts to escape from Hanover and who was regarded as her lover."
