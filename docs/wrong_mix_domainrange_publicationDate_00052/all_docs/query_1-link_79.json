        "text": "Jake Casella Brookins\n\nOn the other hand the aphorism often cited, that “Necessity is the Mother of Invention,” appears to be nothing better than a fragment of uncritical rationalism…Doubtless, the felt need of ways and means has brought on many changes in technology, but doubtless also the ulterior consequences of any one of the greater mechanical inventions have in the main been neither foreseen nor intended in the designing of them. The more serious consequences, especially such as have an institutional bearing, have been enforced by the inventions rather than designed by the inventors.\n\nThorstein Veblen, The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1918)\n\n* * *\n\nEarly in December, in response to the tweet-prompt “What is your academic opinion that would leave people like this? [image of Macaulay Culkin screaming in Home Alone]”, writer and literary scholar Tyler Austin Harper tweeted the following:\n\nThis immediately touched a nerve with science fiction fans, setting off a wave of denunciations of Harper’s thought in the replies and quotes. While there are the occasional thoughtful or concurring response, the vast majority are defensive, dismissive, and recognizably angry.\n\nOne response that I particularly liked, from podcaster and weird art sharer Aaron Thorpe, stated: “this is basically ‘video games influence violent behavior’ but for an entire literary genre. science fiction didnt [sic] create our tech dystopia. capitalism did”. More on the back half of that thought later, but I’d actually go a step further and say that an even better framing—though the misguided demonization of video games is a good analogy—is Plato’s stance, in the Republic, that poetry is dangerously influential. Harper is recognizing the power of an artistic medium to shape people’s minds, and thus society. I think that, even if we acknowledge that some kind of draconian response—somehow banishing SF from existence, or bringing all poets under state control—is obviously a worrisome move, there’s still some substance to that recognition. It’s part of what we like about science fiction in the first place.\n\nI’ve been increasingly interested in, and critical of, the cognitive dissonance that I think is behind a lot of the heat in these defensive responses: the desire to claim a connection to SF’s supposed power—on minds, on technology—while also needing to claim that it’s “just” entertainment. Just reading, just watching. The dissonance of wanting to take, even if only in some tenuous way, credit for how this diverse, imaginative literature has impacted the development of many wonders—and an utter disavowal where it comes to the crushing atrocities our societies and technologies have wrought. Are wreaking.\n\nMy own response to Harper’s provocation, to quote from a private message group, was “is he wrong lol”. I want to very briefly expand on that, and then turn to my impetus for writing in this in the first place—a particularly egregious defense that, I think, shows the worth of the original offense Harper gave to so many science fiction lovers.\n\nThe biggest exaggeration in Harper’s original tweet is the causality—that SF is the sole or primary cause of either discrete technological innovation or the evils they are put to. Where his assertion is strongest is in its asymmetry. It is very easy to show the negative impacts science fictional ideas have had—folks like Musk and Thiel are quite open about their inspirations, for example—but it’s much harder to prove positive impacts. The vaunted prophylactic prophecy of science fiction—the ability to prevent an undesirable future by loudly predicting it—has consistently proven false: most humans live in surveillance states that would make Orwell blush, and they followed up Squid Game with…non-fictional Squid Game. While many SF writers are of immense personal importance to their readers—Le Guin, to take one example—if we’re actually weighing their material impact on the world, it’s hard to come up with something to balance out Palantir, or even just under-regulated SpaceX blunders harming critical ecosystems.\n\nThere’s a much larger point here to be made about the point of literature, of art, and how claims about its utility are doomed to a very particular kind of failure—one that I hesitate to get into, except that the kind of vitriol directed at Harper’s tweet shows exactly how deep those claims have hold of many science fiction fans. Amidst much larger (and fatuous) claims about the moral or intellectual superiority bestowed on readers by the very act of reading, speculative fiction is prey to a theory that it in particular is a noble and ennobling art—though SF readers don’t use the phrase anymore, we’ve never fully excised the belief that “fans are slans”, superior to non-fans, and back this up with questionable studies about readers’ greater empathy, imagination, and scientific knowledge, or the belief that somehow Star Trek (and, by extension, Trekkies) are to be credited with actual aerospace developments. (This might sound like an exaggeration, but I assure you that, in the halls of science fiction conventions and in the discussions of many online communities, this kind of invention-by-association is a common talking point.) This discourse has taken a distinctly moralizing turn in the last decade or so—part of a much longer and larger history, to be sure, but fandom’s reaction to and rejection of overtly right-wing bigotry during the “Sad Puppies” era has led to the frankly bizarre stance, rarely stated openly but readily discernible, that merely consuming properly diverse and inclusive science fiction is itself a moral act.\n\nSo one can imagine the kind of indignation that a claim as stark as Harper’s would elicit—calling into question a genre that has not only gifted the world with astonishing technology, but proven its moral worth.\n\nCausality is a weak argument here, asymmetry a stronger one. I want to talk about complicity, which I think is really the heart of the matter. The issue is not, or not just, that SF authors have invented the torment nexus and then had their cautionary tale misappropriated by thintelligent kleptocrats. The issue is that science fiction—and I’m talking fairly narrowly here about the harder, more technologically-oriented kind of science fiction—is intertwined with the entire cultural project of the anthropocene, with our philosophies of dominion and exploitation and their consequences. Call it capitalism, or neoliberalism—though those are probably too specific. Science fiction has been one mode, a prominent one, by which popular artistic consciousness makes known humanity’s relationship to the world, to technology, to each other. Those relationships have given us some very cool stuff, and they have, spoiler warning, set us on a course to self-destruct the biosphere; they’ve enabled a world of astonishing advances that’s also marked by horrific forever wars, a world in which a billion-plus people are locked in immiserated poverty.\n\nScience fiction didn’t cause that, but it’s been part of it, been produced by those social and material conditions and fed back into them; to the extent that literature changes perceptions and attitudes, I think it’s fair to ask what conditions SF has averted, and what conditions it has, actually, inspired, what it tolerates and condones. If we’re going to give science fiction credit for solar power and electric cars, then it’s only fair, unfortunately, to give science fiction credit for child slavery in the cobalt mines. If we want to claim that science fiction inspired reusable spacecraft or even the lowly Roomba, we must also reckon with the fact that it inspired the gun-wielding drones sniping hospital patients and staff in Gaza.\n\nThis is especially important to ask when the links between science fiction and the military industrial complex are on plain display. As an early convention-goer, I was frequently surprised by how openly and proudly connections between SF authors and think-tanks like SIGMA or DARPA were touted; I’m still aghast beyond words that Worldcon members gave von Braun a (Retro) Hugo in 2004. These tensions came into the open in 2021, with Worldcon listing the weapons manufacturer and war-crime-arranger Raytheon as a sponsor—something that I and many others protested, and which the organizers apologized for. The number of SF fans who were okay with or indeed defended the sponsorship, though, was shocking, and since then it’s become something of a running joke to figure out which supposedly liberal or progressive figures in SF work for an arms company. The military connection with science fiction is not one Harper specifically indicted, but one could readily drum up a list of SF folks involved in other aspects of malignant techno-poptimism, AI the most obvious at the moment—Solarpunk Magazine’s attempt to greenwash NFTs another egregious example.\n\nThe comfort with science fiction’s morally troubling aspects go hand-in-hand with an increased appetite for comfort within science fiction—both for stories that are smooth and palatable, and for the meta-comfort of being told that liking the genre is acceptable, is even laudable, is good. Science fiction is good, and technology is good, and your consumer choices have a positive impact on the world. In one of my favorite pieces of SF criticism in 2023, Clark Seanor wrote, of Becky Chambers’ Wayfarer series, that it “calcifies the current state of affairs in America and presents it as a future that we should be excited for.” That’s exactly it.\n\nI am not opposed to comfort reading—ask me how many comfort re-reads I did over this miserable, trying year—but I am incredibly wary of the insistence on and defense of comfort, of coziness, in our science fiction, of the insistence that they should reassure us. That’s how I read the challenge of Harper’s tweet. Where speculative fiction is at its best is where it defamiliarizes, where it challenges us, where it unsettles. We should beware and abjure, now and always, ideologies constructed around settlement.\n\nI probably would have kept my response to Harper’s tweet, and the small and very online firestorm that resulted, to that private “lol”, but then blogger and pundit Noah Smith wrote a more substantive response to Harper (as well as to another recent piece, from author Charles Stross, “Tech Billionaires Need to Stop Trying to Make the Science Fiction They Grew Up on Real”) that, to be blunt, has me tearing my hair out. I want to be fair here and note that Smith’s conclusion is pretty good, pointing out a very reasonable list of actual dystopian problems today and that they’re “not inspired by sci-fi”; Smith is also, like myself and like Harper, a big science fiction reader—the recent recommendation list he put together might not be the one I would have, but it’s a good one, and shows a broad and thoughtful engagement with the field.\n\nMost of Smith’s argument boils down to, as Karlo Yeager Rodriguez pointed out, dril’s tweet about drunk driving with more steps; it matches Harper’s hyperbolic techno-pessimism with a genuine but question-begging techno-optimism. That such an optimism inevitably entails a dismissal or at least minimization of counterpoints including looming climate disaster, technologically-mediated global injustice, and the non-trivial sins of the billionaire class is very much not beside the point, and I think it’s worth addressing, if only in brief, some of the other missteps this defense is making.\n\nSmith begins with Stross’s essay before moving on to Harper’s comments, arguing fairly, if perhaps irrelevantly, that there’s been a Torment Nexus bait-and-switch in Stross’s argument. The actual examples Stross cites—the space colonization fantasies of Musk and Bezos, the AI & life-extension investments of Thiel—are not, Smith points out, attempts to reify science fictional dystopias, but are in fact inspired by far more hopeful and pleasant fictions. (If we wanted to highlight a better Torment Nexus situation, the Soylent guy is right there—granted, the stakes, like the fruit, are pretty low for that one.) However, this is missing the heart of the complaint: not that billionaires have misread or misapplied SF ideas, but that they are actively creating dystopian systems, for real, right here on Earth, and citing SF ideas that are distractions at best.\n\nThroughout his defense of, variously, space exploration, AI, and effective altruism, Smith is fairly transparently assuming the (positive) conclusion: space colonization is cool and good, and we should applaud the folks working (actively or imaginatively) to make AI good rather than evil. When it comes to the effective altruist/x-risk/TESCREAL bunch (hard to summarize quickly, but these are a collection of SF-inflected “ethical” beliefs in vogue with certain tech/finance types), Smith claims “it’s strange for Harper to bash them while also evincing many of the same worries.” Well, it’s perhaps less strange if one takes an even slightly hard look at the effective altruist crowd: a fig leaf of morality over obscene greed, and, if you examine that fig leaf, it turns out to be a species of grifter-friendly and deeply unethical “utilitarianism”.\n\nIt’s not that space exploration isn’t cool, it’s that private actors leveraging government funds to establish unilateral control of important systems—and doing a fair amount of environmental damage along the way—isn’t cool; manipulating markets and governing bodies to engineer a new feudalism even less so. I don’t even know where to begin with AI; Harper’s twofold claim—that it’s “disruptive, damaging, racist, immiserating, and potentially apocalyptic” and controlled by people with dangerous ideologies—says it all. I’d actually argue that we shouldn’t let that “potentially apocalyptic” distract us; there are enough downsides now, from environmental costs and labor threats to the rapid degradation of shared cultural spaces, that we don’t need to invoke a “5% chance of Skynet”, especially when that’s more share-boosting hype than actual worry. To the extent that science fiction has prepared the ground for this largely-useless and largely-deleterious “innovation”, and boy has it, it’s a perfect example of the kind of fault Harper was assigning with his original claim.\n\nSmith correctly diagnoses that his essential difference with Harper is one of technological optimism versus pessimism. But I think he’s mischaracterizing techno-pessimism as technophobia, a simple and complete opposition, in the same way that Luddism is often mischaracterized. Harper has shown no indication of that blanket refusal, but simply a concern for awful applications of technology, and the ideologies that foster them. That’s basically unthinkable for the committed techno-optimist, for whom externalities and unintended consequences don’t exist.\n\nSometimes, necessity is the mother of invention—one hopes that green technologies rise to meet our needs, and it’s certainly been the case, as Smith points out, for things like vaccines. However, it’s much more common that invention is the mother of necessity—making something new and then convincing everyone they need it, regardless of actual utility, ethics, or larger consequences. And there’s yet a third category here when it comes to the invention and use of things like napalm and white phosphorus: I’m not at all sure one can genuinely point to a need that they met or a utility they fulfilled, there’s something else, much worse, going on there. It’s beyond the scope of this essay and beyond my ability to engage with science fiction’s relation to the invention, justification, and status of the atomic bomb, but Smith hand-waving away its use and its political consequences because “it’s possible” they “deter more deaths than they cause”—sent me, as the kids say. It is certainly good that the world hasn’t seen WWII’s scale of death in the decades since—a scale, it’s worth pointing out, created by less-sexy but still-technological innovation in the field of murder—and certainly good that we have, to date, avoided nuclear armageddon; I would not be so quick to chalk up as a win, for either the Manhattan Project or science fiction, a world of stalemated superpowers engaging in ever-bloodier proxy wars, or simply wars of oppression, with ever-more sophisticated toys of destruction.\n\nIf it’s not clear, my anger is a lot less about Smith’s reasonable (if not closely-reasoned) defense of science fiction, or even about the histrionic responses to Harper’s original attack, as it is about the current state of the world, and being reminded that science fiction—a genre I love, a community I’m a part of—is by turns the muse and the mouthpiece of an economic-technologic system committing atrocities that implicate us all. To defend science fiction, in this moment, against these charges, is to betray it, and to mistake what’s wonderful about it in the first place.\n\nJake Casella Brookins is a critic, independent scholar, and avid book-clubber.
