        "text": "Books you can buy\n\nSee my weblog -- there are links at the top of the right-hand column.\n\nMy Book FAQ will tell you what's due out and when.\n\nWelcome to my fiction pages and virtual short story collection.\n\nI've been selling science fiction stories to magazines and anthologies since 1987. A collection of my earlier short stories (titled Toast) is available; there are also no less than nine fourteen novels under contract, of which six are currently in print (as of February 2006). For full details, see my book FAQ.\n\nPeople ask me where I get my ideas. There's a partial answer in this interview (by Lou Anders, for Revolution SF).\n\nNote that the stories on this website are Copyright Â© Charles Stross, 1987-2006. Unauthorized reproduction outside the terms of the notice (you did read it, didn't you?) is going to get you some real bad karma. (Maybe you'll come back as a slug in your next life. Or if you're really bad, a lettuce.) If you want permission to reprint or reuse some of them, get in touch via the email form (see link at top of page): I don't bite, and I'll probably say \"yes\" to any reasonable proposals.\n\nYou'll notice a shortage of recent stories in the virtual collection. In 1999 I realised that I hadn't sold anything for a couple of years, and decided to rectify the situation. The result was a sudden burst of work. This was in turn followed by a hiatus in 2003-2004 (while I worked frantically on novels), and my production of short fiction is still depressed due to a surfeit of novels. I'll try to maintain a complete ongoing bibliography here. There'll probably be a new short fiction collection some time in 2008 that collects the post-Lobsters non-Accelerando stories.\n\nTrunk and Disorderly\n\nNovella, due for publication in Asimov's SF, January 2007.\n\nMinutes of the Labour Party Conference, 2016\n\nShort-short, to be published in the anthology, \"Glorifying Terrorism\", late 2006.\n\nMissile Gap\n\nNovella, published in \"One Million Years AD\", ed.

Gardner Dozois, 2001).\n\nMichael Swanwick reviewed it in Locus and said \"... so deftly and glancingly are the eldritch horrors worked into the story that it becomes a chilling metaphor for the self-deluding madness and unexamined evil that in our history wore a blander face. I hadn't been paying close attention to Stross's work ... It's a mistake I won't make again.\"\n\nSam Youd (aka John Christopher) wrote \"An extraordinary offspring of John W. Campbell and HP Lovecraft: it shouldn't work, and I'm still not convinced it can, but Stross suspends my disbelief. These are two very different kinds of imagination. What suspends disbelief is the quality of writing, which is excellent -- echoes of early Zelazny, but possibly better.\"\n\nNEW: You can read it online at Infinity Plus.\n\nAntibodies\n\nPublished in Interzone #157; republished in \"The Year's Best Science Fiction #18\" (ed. Gardner Dozois).

From The Weerde #2.\n\nSomething Sweet\n\nFrom New Worlds #1: collaboration with Simon Ings.\n\nHow not to sell a novel\n\nIt's a well-known cliche that every writer has half a novel sitting in a desk drawer, waiting to be published. I've got one that could have been published in 1994, except for a total communications breakdown between myself and an editor. As there seems no hope of publishing it in the immediate future, and as I'm working on other projects, I've put the novel on this web site under a Creative Commons license. (Note: this is the attribution, non-commercial, no-derivs license. The novel is not available for commercial sale). It's old stuff; I wrote the first draft in 1988, and this final version dates to 1993. I still have a fond spot for it, though, unlike most of the other unsold novels lining my filing cabinet; it's a little patchy in places, but I think it's sufficiently close to commercial quality that it deserves to see the light of day. So here's Scratch Monkey."
