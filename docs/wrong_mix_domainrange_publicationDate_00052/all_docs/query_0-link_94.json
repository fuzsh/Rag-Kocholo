        "text": "Counting The Days of Blogging\n\nThis post markss halfway through the year, and nine and a half years of blogging every day! (That’s more than a century in “blog years” : – ) )\n\nI intend to keep going to round out the ten years. Can’t stop now, can I!\n\nA Solar Anniversary\n\nThis solstice marked the first anniversary of my solar panels, which were energized on 21 June 2022. The reports shows that over the first year, our small array generated enough to displace over 2.5 Mwh of consumption, which the web app reckons saved about 2 tons of Carbon emissions. (This is something like 1 / 2 billionth of global emissions.)\n\nThe Dave Barry Tribute “Great Names For A Band”\n\nAs always, I collect great names for a band. These phrases are real terms from real technical articles—I am not making them up!\n\n“Insect Ears”\n\n“Fluent Pomposity”\n\n“Catastrophic forgetting”\n\n“Model collapse”\n\n“End Effectors”\n\nBooks\n\nAs always, each week I reviewed books I read.

I guess we’re going for a decade?\n\nReadership-unknown\n\nThat’s nice, but..\n\nIs anyone reading the posts? I don’t know. The stats are running far fewer hits than last year, but I don’t know what that means. Is this an artifact of the reporting system? Is this an artifact of something I don’t see, such as WordPress publicizing? Perhaps WordPress has improved its robot filtering, killing a lot of bogus traffic. Is this a side effect of larger factors, such as the fragmentation of the internet? (E.g., I get no hits from China, and now from Russia.)\n\nOr are people just not looking at my stuff?\n\nNot that it matters. I’m blogging for my own benefit. If other people like it, that’s pure bonus for me.\n\nRecurring Features\n\nSome Dave Barry Tribute Band Names\n\nA few ideas for band names, from real science and technology articles.\n\n“Leidenfrost effect“\n\n“Structured Thermal Armour”\n\n“Embayment”\n\n“Foehn wind” (which is “A warm, dry, downslope wind”)—so\n\n“Downslope wind”\n\nBooks Reviewed This Quarter\n\n6 non-fiction, 19 fiction this quarter\n\nSpecial mention for: Math Without Numbers by Milo Beckman and The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi\n\nNon-Fiction\n\nTreasured by Christina Riggs\n\nSpooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube, and the Rise of Private Spies by Barry Meier\n\nThe Modern Detective by Tyler Maroney\n\nThe 1619 Project ed. by Nikole Hannah-Jones, Caitlin Roper, Ilena Silverman, and Jake Silverstein\n\nMath Without Numbers by Milo Beckman\n\nOtherlands by Thomas Halliday\n\nFiction\n\nAnthem by Noah Hawley\n\nQuantum of Nightmares by Charles Stross\n\nEscape From Yokai Land by Charles Stross\n\nBefore the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi\n\nTales from the Café by Toshikazu Kawaguchi\n\nThe Goodbye Coast by Joe Ide\n\nPersephone Station by Stina Leicht\n\nMermaid Confidential by Tim Dorsey\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid\n\nOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood by Quentin Tarantino\n\nCentury Rain by Alastair Reynolds\n\nTo Sleep in a Sea of Stars by Christopher Paolini\n\nD (A Tale of Two Worlds) by Michel Faber\n\nCreative Types by Tom Bissell\n\nWhite on White by Ayşegül Savaş\n\nHarrow by Joy Williams\n\nFan Fiction by Brent Spiner\n\nConstance Verity Destroys the Universe by A. Lee Martinez\n\nThe Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi\n\nQuantum of Nightmares by Charles Stross\n\nEscape From Yokai Land by Charles Stross\n\nMore tasty goodness from Charlie.\n\nOne common theme suggests that he is spending time with children in theme parks. Which, obviously, are places where the walls are thin and tentacled horrors seep through to infest the succulent, innocent souls. Well, succulent and young souls, if not totally innocent.\n\nQuantum of Nightmares by Charles Stross\n\nIn 2020 Stross started a new set of characters in Britain under the New Management. This book picks up after Eve and Imp take over the company.\n\nSo, more adventures of “those darn kids”. Dark cults! A private island–with creepy Castle! Corporate raiding in every sense. Technological zombies.\n\nStross is less than totally content with contemporary Britain, and he really lets fly in his fiction. Corporate life is awesomely wicked. Privatized policing is as bad as you might expect. You aren’t going to want to go anywhere near the Deli counter after this.\n\nBut, of course, the kids are all right. Magic is real and astonishing. Goodness is there, if beat down.\n\nWhile Eve, Imp, and company are trying to take control of her company, they discover deeper and more dangerous conspiracies. Aside from everything else, Eve discovers that she has inherited a deep entanglement with a horrible death cult. The good news is, she’s legally in charge. The bad news is, it may not be for long.\n\nThere is a hostile corporate takeover in process. Extremely hostile. Wendy is sent in to unravel what’s up in the supermarket, and it’s much, much worse than expected.\n\nThere is also a kidnap plot. Mary impersonates a Nanny and snatches the four young children of government superheroes, Mr. and Mrs. Banks, AKA, Captain Collossal and Blue Demon. Mary is a low grade transhuman with a supernatural satchel made by her supervillain dad, Dr. Skullface. But the kids are transhuman, too, with unknown but evidently extreme powers—and the minds of children. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nStross has a lot of fun doing over Blackpool, retail employment, corporate law, channel islands, child care, and a lot of other stuff. It’s hilarious.\n\nEverything spins out of control, and evil is rising. It’s up to “those darned kids” to solve the mysteries and defeat wickedness. Mary turns out to be an awesome if unconventional Nanny, and is the only one who realizes that the kidnapees are possibly the most dangerous foursome in the UK.\n\nStuff happens. Magic stuff happens. The kids are all right.\n\nWe haven’t heard the last of this crew.\n\nEscape From Yokai Land by Charles Stross\n\nIn the Delirium Brief (2017) Bob Howard has returned from Japan. Yokai Land recounts what he was doing in Tokyo.\n\nSpoiler alert: there was a lot of pink. A LOT.\n\nAs the replacement Eater of Souls, Bob was dispatched to Tokyo to inspect and refresh some lockdowns originally supervised by Angleton. Underinformed, Bob must contend with both unknown supernatural threats and the very bad relations Angleton left with his Japanese counterparts.\n\nThe overly-tentacled beings seeping into our reality are similar everywhere, but they manifest according to the psyche and mythos of each locale. So, Bob finds the usual weird bollocks are Japanese in their weirdness. Including his two-tailed, cat eared liaison.\n\nThings go critical much sooner than expected, in a very frightening theme park. “Weaponized cuteness” sounds harmless, but really isn’t.\n\nCharles Stross, Quantum of Nightmares, New York, TOR, 2021.\n\nCharles Stross, Escape From Yokai Land, New York, TOR, 2022.\n\nSunday Book Reviews\n\nThis year was tough all over. In addition to the world-wide pandemic disaster and the US election disaster, your humble correspondent faced treatment for deadly illness. (Ironically, I probably would have been homebound much of the year even without the pandemic.)\n\nNevertheless, the blog persists! Without interruption! The blog has surpassed 2500 days in a row of daily posts.\n\nThis year saw over 34K hits*, which is more than 90 hits per day on average. This is up 6K (>22%) from 2019.\n\nOnce again, much of this traffic has been a “long tail”, a hit here and there on old posts. With about 3000 posts from almost 7 years, these dribs and drabs add up.\n\nFrom the stats I have, the traffic has been extremely bursty. Throughout the year, I see a week or 10 days with 50 hits per day, then 4 or 5 days with 250 or more hits, then another period of less traffic. (The standard deviation was over 97, with a mean of 94) This happened again and again, with no clear pattern or known underlying driver.\n\nCombined with the long tail already mentioned, it’s difficult to draw conclusions.\n\n(*I should note that I am only using the default stats provided by wordpress. I do not have enough information to know exactly how they are collected, or what possible sources of error or omission exist.)\n\nRound Up\n\nFor convenience, here are some year end summaries.\n\nGreat Names For Bands\n\nAs always, I’ve noted some “great names for a band”. Dave Barry pioneered this joke for many years in his columns. My variation is mainly taken from or nearly quoted from actual, real, “I am not making this up” scientific and technical articles.\n\nHere are this year’s bands:\n\nRocks from Ryugu\n\nRocks from Ryugu with Bennu Dust\n\nWing Models of Yi\n\nThe Great American Biotic Interchange\n\nVenus Feelers\n\nSkid n’ Bump – All-mechanical, Mostly Passive\n\nClockwork Cucaracha\n\nScotch Yoke Clinometer\n\nDouble Octopus\n\nCompound Obstacles\n\nThe South Pole Wall (also ia great name for a cocktail)\n\nSolar Canals of Gujarat\n\nBottlebrush block copolymer photonic crystals\n\nAntarctic Frogs\n\nFirst Fossil Frog\n\nEocene High Latitude\n\nGondwanan Cosmopolitinism\n\nTape-spool boom extraction system\n\nFlux Lobe Elongation\n\nMagnetic Pole Acceleration\n\nTowards Siberia\n\nPossible common capture events\n\nRadially Symmetric Fertile Parts\n\nPendicle Bending\n\nWing Heart\n\nScent Pads\n\nFailed Squid Meal\n\nPrey Seizure\n\nBooks Reviewed\n\nAs always, I wrote short reviews of books I read this year, usually appearing every Sunday. Over the whole year, I reviewed 55 fiction and 24 non-fiction books.\n\nGlancing at the list, I would especially recommend:\n\nFiction:\n\nThe City We Became by N. K.

We’ve been waiting forever, well, for more than a year for more from Stross.\n\nLast we read earlier , the world is in serious trouble and the UK has surrendered to New Management, the horrible faceless man, an Elder God. The new regime is a nightmare or corruption, death, and misery; but was chosen as the least bad alternative—much, much worse things are pushing at the fabric of reality, wanting in. Of necessity, the Laundry is sworn to the New Management.\n\nThis story takes place in this world, though the Laundry isn’t involved. Given the general downsizing and cooption of government, we can wonder if the Laundry is even functional.\n\nThis particular story is a complicated caper, chasing after not the Necronomicon but a concordance thereof. This is possible because an old family of magicians has built a strange memory palace out the back of their old home. The impossible corridor winds back in time somehow, in a kind of dungeon game thing.\n\nOur protagonists are the current descendants of the magician’s line, Jeremey and Evie, along with friends, retainers, Eve’s evil billionaire boss, Mr. Bigge, and assorted mercs.\n\nA whole parade is chasing this bounty, a squad of Russian mafia, Mr. Bigge’s personal agent (who the boss insists must cosplay as ‘Bond’), Bigge’s executive assistant (Eve) and her hired ‘Gammon’, and, of course, Imp (Jeremey) and his “clown car team of junior supervillains led by a theatrical impresario “, (i.e., Jeremey (imp) and his friends).\n\nOh and did I mention that the book has to be retrieved from 1888? Well, a dream of 1888. A haunted and cursed dream of 1888.\n\nThe object in question is protected by a magical ward that will kill anyone trying to steal it. It should be OK for Jeremey or Eve to handle—they are descendants of the owner. And Eve thinks she has leagally purchased it. But no one is totally sure how the death spell interprets “ownership”.\n\n“At what stage does the book consider itself to have been legitimately acquired? And by whom? Is it safe for you to handle it, as my employee? What about as an independent contractor not subject to the HMRC IR35 regulations? Am I an acceptable proxy for Bigge Enterprises, a Scottish Limited Liability Partnership domiciled in the Channel Islands, in the view of a dim-witted nineteenth century death spell attached to a codex bound in human skin by a mad inquisitor? It’s like digital rights management magic, only worse.”\n\nOK, this is kind of a ‘quest’, and the climactic action is a dungeon that is not only like video game, its like an early 90s dungeon game. I.e., simple and trite. (He even got in a line about “you meddling kids”. Sigh. ) (Imps “Lost Boys” also hook up with a grown up ally, “Wendy”. Sigh.)\n\nI’m generally annoyed by the incursion of video games into novels, but Stross is good enough to get away with it\n\nWe’re certainly rooting for the kids to get through this mess. If we get through this one, maybe there will be a sequel.\n\nCharles Stross, Dead Lies Dreaming, New York, TOR, 2020.\n\nSunday Book Reviews\n\nThis New Years marks close to six years of blogging every day. I write ‘em, a few of you click on ‘em.\n\nThe Traffic Stats Were Weird\n\nThe total hits on this blog increased again, up more than 10% from 2018. As before, there is a huge amount of “long tail” in this traffic, with hits spread widely over the thousands of posts from the last 8 years.\n\nBut it isn’t clear exactly how many people actually look at this blog. The stats I get are defaults from wordpress, so I don’t really know much about them.\n\nThis year saw a couple of mysterious blips. I don’t know how much of this is real traffic, and how much of it is artifacts of the data collection.\n\nEarly in the year, the daily hits dropped dramatically. This approximately corresponds to the European data privacy requirements, and the dearth of hits from that region suggest that the blog is either not available to some people (not being compliant in some way I don’t know about) or accesses are not reported (not having permission to collect that data). I dunno.\n\nBut then, around August, traffic picked up. Really picked up, to 100 hits per day. During this burst, it tended to be bursty, with a few days of high traffic, as much a 300 hits per day, and then several days of low traffic. From the imperfect information I can see, the bursts might be from Hong Kong (perhaps scraping the internet to make a copy to be used inside China?)\n\nThen, around November, traffic dropped off again and has stayed low. This drop approximately coincides with the increasing troubles in HK, so perhaps this reflects a cut off of Internet access there.\n\nI really don’t know.\n\nThe Usual Stuff\n\nThe blog continued to cover the usual stuff.\n\nCryptocurrencies, the Future of Work (and Coworking), Dinosaurs, Birds, Robots, the Ice Is Melting, Renewable Energy.\n\nI blog about anything that interests me and is worth the trouble. I try to have something useful to say, though sometimes it’s mainly a link with “this is cool”\n\nMany of the things I discuss are from current academic papers, which I cite and generally try to read at least the abstract and always point to the original sources.\n\n“Coworking – The Book” and other Writing\n\nMy 2018 book “What is Coworking?” continues to sell like hot cakes–if nobody had ever heard of hot cakes. I think it sold a couple dozen copies. My plans for a new villa are on hold…. : – )\n\nWriting is hard. Selling books is even harder.\n\nSpeaking of writing, I also contributed an article to a local free paper, which I really like the title to:\n\nRobert E. McGrath, Think Heliocentrically, Act Locally, in The Public I: A Paper of the People. 2019. http://publici.ucimc.org/2019/04/think-heliocentrically-act-locally/\n\nI archived a report on the 2013 Alma Mater project. Versions of this report was rejected by several conferences and journals. A problem with working outside the box is that the journals of boxology won’t publish your results.\n\nRobert E. McGrath, A Digital Rescue for a Graduation Ritual. Urbana, Illinois, 2019. http://hdl.handle.net/2142/105503\n\nOnward\n\nThis blog will continue in the same vein, and daily posts will continue at least for now.\n\nBand Names\n\nIn a continuing homage to Dave Berry, I have identified a bunch of phrases that would make great names for a band. In general, these phrases are taken from actual, real scientific and technical papers. So I am not making them up—just repurposing them.\n\nHere is this year’s crop.\n\ngerbil’s casket\n\nPreen Oil\n\nCarolina Preen Oil\n\nCarolina Junco\n\nDark eyed Junco\n\nArctic Albedo\n\nMean Surface Albedo\n\nArctic Amplification\n\nAmplified Arctic Warming\n\nSurface Air Temperature\n\nSnow Cover Fraction\n\nBuckypaper\n\nPacific Pumice Raft\n\nSichuan Mudslides (also a great name for cocktail)\n\nSoft Exo Suits\n\nThe Weddell Gyre\n\nGiant Miocene Parrots\n\nEocene Whale\n\nChicxulub ejecta\n\nPerching Drones\n\nPerch And Stare Mission\n\nDue to a lack of sunlight in Scotland\n\nBlogging Birds Of Scotland\n\nHuddle Pod\n\nCuddle Pod\n\nGiant Hopping Tree Rats\n\nKangaroo Ancestors\n\nPrehistoric kangaroos\n\nTiny Pronking Robots\n\nComputational Periscopy\n\nBooks\n\nAs always, I have continued the weekly review of one or more books that I read this year. This year I wrote about a total of 73 books, 24 non-fiction, 49 fiction.\n\nSome Favorite Books of the Year\n\nFiction:\n\nThe Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage by Sydney Padua\n\nThis is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone\n\nAngels of Music by Kim Newman\n\nNon-Fiction\n\nBreaking and Entering by Jeremey N.

Bob Howard is dispatched out in the country (to “Ruralshire” as he snarks), to deal with a potential outbreak.\n\nUnicorns? Really? Is his boss pulling his leg? The case file is absurd, so what’s going on?\n\nUnfortunately, it’s a pretty dangerous situation, and the unicorn manure definitely hits the fan. Bad stuff happens, and Bob and the hard boys of the military (very) special forces of SAS 21 (formerly The Artists Rifles) have their hands full.\n\nAs always, Bob’s report of these dire events is caustic and hilarious.\n\nToast (2002) by Charles Stross\n\nGoing even farther back, this book is a collection of short stories from the 90s. The title refers to just how fast change, especially technological change, eats up and ruins the futures created in science fiction. The theme is that the futures imagined here mostly didn’t happen, and in some cases are laughably off target.\n\nIn short, the stuff he creates is toast, sometimes a lot sooner than expected.\n\nIndeed, a lot of these stories seem quite dated, to the point that you have to have gray hair to even know what they heck he is talking about. (It’s frightening to realize that college students today were born after the great Y2K scare.)\n\nThis is even more poignant, with our additional twenty years perspective.\n\nBut Stross is good, so good that even wild misses are interesting and highly readable.\n\nPossibly the most dated aspect of this collection is the strange pre-9/11, pre-monopoly vibes. Stross is deeply cynical about institutions and power, and expresses his cyberpunk roots in 90’s style pseudo-libertarianism empitomized by the brainless slogan, “Information wants to be free”. (How can information “want” anything?) Yet, this cynicism is imbued with naïve pre-Facebook/Google/Apple ideas about the invincibility (and, indeed, morality) of free software and freely networking nerds.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, we have seen the surveillance state grow ever more capable everywhere. For that matter, we have seen the Internet evolve to be a mass surveillance system driven by advertising.\n\nWe have also seen non-state actors weaponize the Internet. In the age of mass identity theft, “hacker” is no longer an unambiguously positive cultural icon. And the motto “information wants to be free” would be a lot more meaningful if the information weren’t mostly fake and intended to enslave.\n\nThe things Stross wrote about in the 90s have come true, but not necessarily in the ways he, or any of us, thought.\n\nWasn’t the cyber world was so much more fun when it was just us kids fooling around in the basement!\n\nAnd that’s the problem. Who wants to have to be a grown up, to pay attention to innocent bystanders and unintended consequences?\n\nBut never mind that. Relax and enjoy some of Stross’s wonderful (and scary) alternative worlds.\n\nCharles Stross, Equoid, Burton, MI, Subterranian Press, 2013.\n\nCharles Stross, Toast and other rusted futures, Holicong, PA, Wildside Press, 2002.\n\nSunday Book Reviews"
