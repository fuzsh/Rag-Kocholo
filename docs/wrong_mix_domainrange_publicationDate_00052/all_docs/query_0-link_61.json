More the big business/politics side of things…\n\nIf you haven’t read them, Nathan Lowell’s Solar Clipper books are really enjoyable as well. They spend more time with the ships in space than I think we will, but still good to get the mind going along the interstellar shipping/trading/etc. lines of thought.\n\nI could go on for hours, but I just wanted to get the ball rolling.\n\nOh, great idea! Just extended my Amazon wishlist.\n\nI gotta admit I’m not as much of a connoisseur of classic sci-fi as I’d like to be. I’ve quite enjoyed the more recent The Expanse book series and I think it’s something Prosperous Universe draws some inspiration from. Also, not strictly hard sci-fi and not strictly a book, but the Ghost in the Shell manga (movies and TV series) paints a pretty compelling and somewhat bleak picture of a not-so-distant future. I’d say those two are my current favorite sci-fi-ish franchises.\n\nLet’s keep this train rolling! Anybody else got some suggestions? We need to do some writing soon, and what better way to get inspired than by the books our players already love!"
