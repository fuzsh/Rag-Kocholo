        "text": "Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the Arab world’s greatest leader, passed away 50 years ago today. He was the leader of the group of Egyptian military officers who overthrew a hated monarchy in the July 1952 Revolution, and presided over the establishment of a republic as well as the departure of the last vestiges of British colonialism from Egypt. His republican coup inspired similar military-led revolutions in Iraq (1958), Northern Yemen (1962), Syria (1966), Sudan (1969) and Libya (1969). Thus the Egyptian Revolution and the rise of Nasser was the most significant event in the Middle East in the 20th century, and would remain so until Nasser’s successors signed a ‘peace treaty’ with Israel and marginalised Egypt’s role in the Arab world on the one hand, and the Iranian Revolution in 1979 on the other.\n\nThough an Egyptian, Nasser worked tirelessly for Arab unity and freedom for Palestine. He enthusiastically tried to unite Egypt with Iraq and Syria for a short-lived United Arab Republic, which could not live up to its promise and split up in 1961. This disaster, together with Egypt’s disastrous involvement on the side of Yemeni republican forces in the Yemeni Civil War in the 1960s, and the devastating defeat of Arab forces in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War put paid to Nasser’s twin projects. Nasser never recovered from these incidents and passed away three years later, a broken but proud man.\n\nTo commemorate Nasser’s 50th death anniversary, I have chosen to translate one poem each from well-known Pakistani and Indian communist poets. Habib Jalib is Pakistan’s greatest resistance poet and his poem on Nasser, simply titled Gamal Abdul Nasser forms part of his 1975 collection Ehd-e-Saza (The Age of Punishment). This is an ode to the great Arab leader, and posits him as being immortal in contrast to his physical death as exemplified by the refrain Kon Kehta Hai Tu Mar Gaya Hai. So the reader comes away from the poem with a message of hope and determination. Here is how Jalib ends the poem in the original Urdu:\n\n‘Baat bandooq ki ab zuban main\n\nKar sake ga na koi jahan main\n\nAatish-e-gham na bharka saken gi\n\nBijliyan ab kisi aashiyan main\n\nAb hain sahme hue saamraaji\n\nAman se zulm ab dar gaya hai\n\nKon kehta hai tu mar gaya hai’\n\nNiaz Haider was an Indian resistance poet and theatre activist who was close to the Communist Party of India, which he never joined. He remains relatively little-known in Pakistan despite the fact that 2020 marks his birth centenary. The poem in translation here is titled Khabar-e-Irtihal-e-Nasir (News of the Death of Nasser) which is part of his 1959 collection Shola-e-Awargi (The Wandering Flame). In polar contrast to Jalib’s poem though, it is a classic dirge, the dark mood of the poem illustrated by mourning and lamentation, and the reader is really hard-pressed to feel hopeful. Here is the final stanza in Urdu:\n\n‘Yeh yakayak zameen ka tham jaana\n\nKis naye saanihe ki khatir hai\n\nSalab hone lagi hai taab-e-yaqeen\n\nKhabar-e-irtihal-e-Nasir hai’\n\nIt is upto the reader to judge which of the two poems translated below does justice to its great subject. Be that as it may, the passing away of Gamal Abdel Nasser marked the end of an era and the closing of a chapter in world history, the consequences of which we are still facing today.\n\n~\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser\n\n‘The dawn of Arab lands\n\nWho says you have died\n\nO beauty of the nation with your heart’s blood\n\nYou have fulfilled the demand of existence\n\nA million storms of untruths rose\n\nBut the bud of truth smiled\n\nThe night gave its all to stopping the sun\n\nBut morning had to follow suit, and it did\n\nNow darkness will never dominate\n\nYou have left the morning young\n\nWho says you have died.\n\nIs it less of a favour, that your nation\n\nKnows its enemy\n\nThat you were humanity’s masterpiece\n\nThe whole world acknowledges you\n\nThe curtains which covered the assassin’s face\n\nYou left them uncovered\n\nWho says you have died.\n\nNo one in the world will ever\n\nNow be able to wield a gun in speech\n\nThe lightning will now be unable to inflame\n\nThe fire of sorrow in any nest\n\nThe imperialists are now scared\n\nInjustice now fears peace\n\nWho says you have died.’\n\n~\n\nNews of the Death of Nasser\n\nOne hears a heartbeat\n\nWhy is the world so downbeat\n\nWithin the tear of blood was burnt and extinguished the light of the eye\n\nWhy is the light so momentary.\n\nEverywhere there is mourning and lamentation\n\nLowered are all the flags of liberation\n\nAs if life in relation to its death\n\nIs itself celebrating sorrow in mirth.\n\nThe air is lost for beauty\n\nThe winds breathe with difficulty.\n\nWhy are tears flooding like the monsoon\n\nSunk in sorrow are the sun and the moon\n\nThe torn dresses are in flight\n\nThe blue sky has disappeared from sight\n\nIndeed mourning for itself is life\n\nThe deserts and the tresses of the Nile, so rife.\n\nWhat an eye-burning sight\n\nTresses drenched in dust and blood, alight.\n\nWho seized from the flower its bloom\n\nWho condemned the heart’s moonlight to gloom\n\nWhy does the wailing possess grief and despair\n\nWhy is desire clothed in black attire.\n\nThis earth coming to a standstill suddenly\n\nIs this for the sake of another calamity\n\nLost is truth’s power\n\nWith the news of the death of Nasser."
