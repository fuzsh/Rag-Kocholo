        "text": "For many years, the best friend and trusted confidant of Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser was the chief of his armed forces, Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer. But the two had a serious falling out after Egypt’s disastrous defeat by Israel in June, and in September, while under house arrest for allegedly plotting a military coup, Amer either committed suicide—the official version of his death —or was killed. After his death, intelligence agents of another Arab state obtained in Cairo a 14-page document said to be Amer’s last testament. Though the Middle East makes a business of forgery, sources who knew Amer well and have read the document claim that on the basis of its style, opinions and signature, it is unmistakably Amer’s. It not only criticizes Nasser but offers strong indication that Amer was murdered. Excerpts:\n\nWE involved ourselves in a war with Israel without wanting it, without taking the initiative and without planning it or choosing its date. It was not enough for Gamal to stand up and say, “I take full responsibility [for the defeat].” We can carry out our responsibilities only when we explain to the people how the decisions that led to the destruction of our army were taken. That is why I offered my resignation. Many friends and colleagues tried to convince me that the decision was hasty. Others spread news about me that I was suffering from deep psychological crisis and that I attempted suicide several times. But who had not suffered a psychological crisis after the catastrophe that befell us? As for suicide, it is the farthest from my mind, because that would be running away from responsibility and from facing it with courage and frankness.\n\nHis Excellency, the President, surprised me when, before going to the Arab Summit Conference, he invited me to his house and informed me that security forces would arrest me. “Brother,” he said, “reports that I receive say that a large number of officers were seen entering and leaving your house. This endangers the regime. I do not know how truthful the reports are, but we must put an end to the visits.”\n\nI swore by my honor that the visits had nothing to do with politics. “Gamal,” I told him, “if I had wanted to seize power I would not have resigned in June. And if you still doubt my intentions, I am prepared to prove my innocence before any military court.” He said that this was not possible. I asked if he was ordering me to keep silent [about events leading up to the war]. “Yes,” he said. I answered that I could not keep silent because it would be a betrayal of my duty and military honor. He said, “You better think it over a second time.”\n\nNow that it is too late, I realize that the President neglected Egypt altogether, and that that is the cause of our failure. We should have looked after our people instead of getting involved in others’ revolutions and wars and squandering thousands of millions of pounds. We destroyed our economy by our own hands and put our destiny and history in the hands of the devil. We made many mistakes, but the biggest mistake we made was that we did not admit those mistakes.\n\nIf this “political will” is written in haste, it is because I am afraid of what is in store for me. I have lost confidence in my friend and brother Gamal. I have received various threats because I have asked for a public trial. Two hours ago, an intelligence officer whom I would not have given a glance during the time of my glory came to visit me. He threatened to silence me forever if I ventured to talk. I have been trying to make contact with the President by telephone but am told that he is busy. I feel sure that a conspiracy is being prepared against me. I wrote this will and made certain that it will reach trusted friends. Finally, I ask the Almighty for forgiveness. God is great, and glory to Egypt."
