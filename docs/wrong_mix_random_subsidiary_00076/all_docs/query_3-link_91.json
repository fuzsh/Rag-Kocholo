        "text": "Scores of people have been crushed or battered to death in Cairo as millions of people crowded onto the streets for President Abdel Nasser's funeral.\n\nThe funeral cortege should have been a sombre state ceremony attended by 40 major-generals and 5,000 troops.\n\nBut as the president's bier passed through the capital towards its final resting place, the sheer weight of numbers of grief-stricken Egyptians threatened to disrupt the procession.\n\nCommunal sorrow\n\nAs the coffin crossed Qasr El-Nil bridge soldiers were simply overwhelmed by a mass of communal sorrow as men and women, wailing their loss, swarmed around the entourage.\n\nIn a surge of spontaneity hysterical mourners attempted to bear their beloved leader's coffin themselves.\n\nSoldiers used rifle butts and batons to repel the crowd in the ensuing pandemonium.\n\nThe march was abandoned and the coffin transferred to a military vehicle.\n\nAuthorities drove the coffin in haste to its final resting place at Manshiet-el-Bakry mosque, now to be known as Gamal Abdel Nasser mosque, and completed the burial ceremony three hours ahead of schedule.\n\nEstimates put the number of mourners lining the funeral route at five million.\n\nMany more congregated in major cities across Egypt and the Arab world.\n\nWhile the majority of casualties in Cairo were caused by overcrowding, other cities in the Middle East witnessed more unusual fatalities.\n\nStray small arms fire is reported to have killed and wounded a number of people in Beirut.\n\nThe discharging of weapons into the air is a common mark of respect in the region for dead heroes and leaders."
