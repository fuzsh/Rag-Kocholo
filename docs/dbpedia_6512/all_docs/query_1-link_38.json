They have provided training to our team to train new employees and I’d recommend any dealership to look at HBS.\n\nI’d recommend any dealership to take a look at HBS Systems. Every time I have an issue, I submit a case and receive a call the same day. The problem is fixed right away. They have the best system in the industry.\n\nIf you are looking for a DMS, call HBS Systems. They provide the best response time and solution-based service of any company I’ve done business with! SupportNow customer service is to be applauded for their response time and they treat our employees with respect when correcting an error.\n\nThe integration of each facet of the dealership: sales, parts, and service. This software allows us to keep track of sales orders, daily parts orders, and customer work-in-process in real-time. We have been on the system for many years and it keeps improving with the dealership personnel in mind. It has also helped increase our efficiency which has led to much better bottom-line profitability for the dealership.\n\nI like being able to easily set up tiles on ActiveDesktop to get quickly into work areas that I need to do my job all on one screen. The simple search feature is great at saving time as well.\n\nWhenever I call with a problem, and usually it is a hard one, they always do their best to resolve it and keep me up to date on what is going on.\n\nHBS Systems is very easy to use and easy to get around in. The custom financials make it easy to look at all 13 locations on one consolidated screen, and if needed, I can look at each location for further analysis.\n\nI’d recommend HBS Systems to other dealers. They have great people and are always helpful when we have had challenges.\n\nI’ve been working with HBS for 12 years and have never been disappointed. We recently acquired a second location and did our training via a Zoom call and it was fantastic. The phone support staff are always friendly and courteous. Thank you for always being there to help when it is needed. I would recommend HBS Systems equipment dealership software to other dealerships."
