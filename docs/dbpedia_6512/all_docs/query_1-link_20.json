        "text": "The training we received in August was well worth every penny. Lots of new info that we learned and ways to be more efficient. Best training I have been at.\n\nHBS Systems is very easy to use and easy to get around in. The custom financials make it easy to look at all 13 locations on one consolidated screen, and if needed, I can look at each location for further analysis.\n\nDealership support and service are huge with a complex business system. HBS provides outstanding customer service and does well to react when we run into trouble or have questions. Very helpful and knowledgeable when things don’t go as planned.\n\nAs a long-term 25-year customer of HBS Systems, we were happy with the software; however, we were lured away from a competitor with a smoke-and-mirrors sales pitch. After switching to the competitor software, it only took about 6 months to figure out we had made a mistake and we switched right back to HBS Systems.\n\nI’d recommend HBS Systems to any equipment dealer; it’s a great system that saves time, decreases errors, and allows our team to improve upon customer service by providing real-time information within the software.\n\nHBS Systems worked with me to get everything set up in a way that works best for us with new hardware. They even sourced and ordered parts that are unusual for us. Any dealer looking for a DMS should call HBS Systems.\n\nWe were impressed with HBS Systems when we made a request specific to our dealership. Their team expedited the programming process to upload a short-notice store addition into the business system. I’d recommend to any dealership to take take a look at HBS Systems.\n\nI’ve been working with HBS for 12 years and have never been disappointed. We recently acquired a second location and did our training via a Zoom call and it was fantastic. The phone support staff are always friendly and courteous. Thank you for always being there to help when it is needed. I would recommend HBS Systems equipment dealership software to other dealerships.\n\nWhen we experienced problems with our server in 2019, the team at HBS went above and beyond to assist us to get us up and going as fast as possible. I’d recommend any dealership to choose HBS Systems.\n\nHBS worked with me to get everything set up in a way that works best for us with new hardware. They even sourced and ordered parts that are unusual for us. Any dealer looking for a DMS should call HBS Systems.\n\nHBS Systems provided system update training live at the dealership with our team to train us. The service after implementation has been amazing as well. The team is very quick to answer support questions and concerns.\n\nThey answer all of our questions regardless of how many times we have to ask them. Sincere thanks for all your work on behalf of the dealers you serve. Keep listening to what your dealers are telling you they need.\n\nIf you are looking for a DMS, call HBS Systems. They provide the best response time and solution-based service of any company I’ve done business with! SupportNow customer service is to be applauded for their response time and they treat our employees with respect when correcting an error.\n\nThe functionality of the system is very user friendly. The product support team is great and helps the ease of use with the software.\n\nIf we have any kind of problem we email or call and they are on it to get it solved. I’d highly recommend HBS Systems to any dealership to improve workflow. They truly understand the business."
