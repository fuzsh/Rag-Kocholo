Transforming staff alongside the technology We have talked about transformations in the broadcast environment at every big change: black and white to colour, analogue to digital, SD to HD. But today’s change – from linear audio and video to file-based architectures – is a real transformation, and it requires careful planning not just for the equipment but for the people. F rom the dawn of television you decision. But it does mean that, for risk of bottlenecks and critical points of could unplug a BNC and plug in broadcast engineers, the 100 or so racks failure are around the IP switches and a waveform monitor to see what of equipment are largely alien territory.

If the So the system integrator has to take automation went down you responsibility for designing a system that could still put an emergency programme can be supported, incubating the internal into a VTR to keep the station on air. Yes, resources within the broadcaster to staff needed training on new equipment, understand what the system can and but it was always a development on the should do, and provide a common point familiar. The systems we are building of support to triage faults and get them today for our customers are largely file- corrected as quickly as possible. The first based, built on IP infrastructures.

At you need to understand where the site-specific knowledge. There is real that point the broadcaster needs a single redundancy paths lie, and how they will be concern around the lack of new person to turn to, and it is likely that the implemented should disaster strike. engineering talent coming into the industry. system integrator is the best placed to The IABM is beginning to tackle this, with triage the fault and bring about a speedy Systematic transfer of skills introductory courses on the fundamentals resolution.

Because you are implementing some technology will be based on downtime and maximise performance, as not just new equipment but new concepts, commodity IT hardware and software, the well as verifying upgrades. there has to be a systematic transfer of special requirements of television will skills.

Bringing the brightest and best Am I suggesting this as a way of going to work. It is only by understanding engineers into broadcasting is going to justifying further fees for the system the logic of the design that engineers will take years, so for now at least the system integrator? No, I do not see it as a new be able to work through issues and integrator and customer have to work way of driving profit.

Ultimately, though, Lack of engineering talent user would agree an SLA with the key success depends upon identifying the right As I said earlier, some of these major vendors, specifying the speed of response people to support the system, helping file-based installations are going into to issues and the replacement of faulty them to buy in to the thinking behind it, greenfield sites, which means the in-house components. and developing their understanding of it engineering team will have to be recruited. over time.

It is fairly obvious if a VTR stops fully enthused, to make it work. Revised code of practice for sound systems at sports grounds The British Standards Institution has launched the revised BS7827, a code of practice for audio systems designers in sports venues.
