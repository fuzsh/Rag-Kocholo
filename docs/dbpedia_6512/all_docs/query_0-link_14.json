Customer Case Study Online Meetings Offer Eco-Charity Greener Way to Work WWF uses WebEx technology to collaborate more efficiently on global projects while reducing its carbon footprint. Challenge Executive Summary Founded in 1961 as the World Wildlife Fund, WWF is one of the largest and most respected Customer Name: independent conservation organisations in the world. Acting both locally and globally through a WWF (World Wildlife Fund) network of more than 90 offices across 40 countries, the charity strives to achieve its twin goals Industry: of saving biodiversity and reducing humanity’s impact on nature. Non-profit, Conservation Location: As part of this effort, WWF manages on-the-ground conservation projects in more than 100 Gland, Switzerland countries, many of which require collaboration amongst multinational teams.

Customer Case Study “The beauty of WebEx technology is that we can access it in remote locations like Tanzania, Cameroon, and Vietnam,” says Humphrey. “As a result, we’re seeing a steady but significant increase in usage. Over the course of two years, the number of WebEx meetings conducted within our organisation has grown by 58 percent.” “By reducing our reliance on travel, we are also minimizing our carbon footprint. So not only does WebEx technology meet our business needs, it aligns with our conservation efforts as well.” — Linda Humphrey, global technology services manager, WWF Senior management meetings WWF is using WebEx Meeting Center not just for regular catch-up meetings, but for meetings between its senior network executive team as well. Because attendees can now share presentations and documents in real time, Humphrey notes a smoother meeting flow than on previous occasions. The success of these WebEx-led executive meetings inspired WWF to share its best practices with industry colleagues. “At the WWF annual conference, we took the opportunity to explain the benefits of WebEx technology as one of our collaborative working solutions, and how it facilitates a different style of working,” says Humphrey. “We explained that not only does it eliminate the costs associated with travel, such as taxis, hotels, subsistence, and time out of the office, but also saves a significant amount of time, which helps boost productivity.” IT support WebEx technology is also proving invaluable for the IT support team because the team can now remotely fix server problems in countries such as Zimbabwe, Senegal, and Fiji. In the past, troubleshooting with staff over the phone often proved challenging, especially when talking to employees whose first language was not English. Using WebEx Meeting Center, however, an IT manager can share his or her desktop with a technician on Humphrey’s team, allowing WWF to fix its IT problems at a more rapid pace. “When there was a server problem in another country, we used to have to drop our normal workload, jump on an aeroplane, and fix the problem,” says Humphrey. “To have this unscheduled trip was highly disruptive and kept me out of the office for a week. But with WebEx Meeting Center, we can solve these IT issues remotely, saving me valuable in-office time to work on more strategic projects.” Job interviews WWF also uses WebEx technology to conduct job interviews with remote candidates, further reducing the need for air travel. “Our WWF staff in Switzerland recently interviewed an HR director based in Cameroon through a WebEx session,” says Humphrey. “It was a much more convenient experience for both parties.” © 2010 Cisco Systems, Inc.
