Magic Quadrant for Web Conferencing Gartner RAS Core Research Note G00205941, David Mario Smith, 4 November 2010, RA1 11182011 Pressure placed on prices in the Web-conferencing market by cloud collaboration suites is accelerating consolidation and causing leading vendors to rethink their go-to-market pricing strategies. In light of these developments, Gartner assesses 15 providers of Web-conferencing products. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The Web-conferencing market is experiencing heavy consolidation as acquisitions continue. Concerns about archiving and compliance are growing, especially among organizations in regulated industries. Free and low-cost Web-conferencing services such as Dimdim and Yugma are contributing to downward pricing pressure on more expensive and established market leaders. Adding to this pressure is Microsoft’s inclusion of Live Meeting as part of its Microsoft Business Productivity Online Standard Suite (BPOS) cloud collaboration suite, along with Exchange, Office Communications and SharePoint, for around $10 per user per month. These developments are commoditizing Web conferencing and impacting vendors’ pricing strategies. Google acted as a catalyst for cloud collaboration services with Google Apps. Microsoft and other major vendors, such as IBM and Cisco, are also adopting this strategy. This threatens niche players that charge a premium for Web conferencing. We believe this trend will continue to drive down the cost of Web-conferencing services, making this a buyer’s market. Although Web conferencing has traditionally been a stand-alone market, convergence with unified communications and collaboration (UCC) offerings and bundling with cloud suites are making it a more strategic decision for enterprises. Web-conferencing vendors are also investing in adjacent areas such as webcasting and virtual events, which already have established providers. Leading companies have turned some of their larger conferences and events into virtual events. We are still seeing growing interest in large virtual-event providers like Inxpo, ON24, Accordent and Unisfair. Offerings from these vendors overlap with those from traditional Web-conferencing vendors that are now offering support for larger events.\n\n2. 2 MAGIC QUADRANT Figure 1. Magic Quadrant for Web Conferencing Market Overview challengers leaders Web-conferencing products are real-time collaboration tools that support interactions over a network between participants in multiple meeting formats. The various types of meeting and communications that fall into the category of Web conferencing include Cisco webinars, online meetings, messaging and audio communications. Microsoft IBM ability to execute The primary justifications for Web Adobe conferencing are the cost savings and other Citrix Online benefits from reduced business travel.

Alcatel-Lucent Elluminate Dimdim Dialcom The market for Web conferencing, teaming Netviewer and social software will grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20% through 2011. Due to global economic challenges, interest in Web conferencing is at an all-time high as companies look to cut costs.
