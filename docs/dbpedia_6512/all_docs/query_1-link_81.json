        "text": "UPDATE 2022\n\nIt has been a while since we updated the software. In line with its original purpose - the visualization of metadata across population structure using population graphs - we have implemented a new version with tidyverse-like syntax:\n\nhttps://github.com/esteinig/netviewr\n\nConstruction of the underlying population graph and selection of suitable k-nearest-neighbour thresholds is integrated, and there is better documentation and tests. Hopefully it is somewhat easier to use the pipeline going from distance matrices to suitable population network visualizations.\n\nCode and tutorials in this repository are functional, but will not be maintained.\n\nIf you use the package for publication, please cite:"
