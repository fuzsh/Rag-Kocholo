For each licence sold, real-time collaboration software developer Netviewer says it will offset half a ton of greenhouse gases – meaning that users could be communicating more efficiently, saving travel expenses and protecting the climate at the same time.

On World Environment Day, today, 5th June, the company says it will honour its pledge by supporting the climate protection projects of Swiss non-profit organisation myclimate, including the restoration of hydropower plants in Indonesia. Founded 2001 in Karlsruhe, Germany, Netviewer enables business users to view each other’s PC screen simultaneously in order to work together, regardless of where they are. According to a new survey by the WWF (World Wild Fund for Nature) and ETNO (European Telecommunications Network Operators Association) 22 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced if 20% of all business trips in the 25 EU-nations were replaced by using technology, such as web conferences. With its virtual meeting and web collaboration solutions, Netviewer makes the point that it can contribute positively to that goal. Indeed, it says that last year Netviewer products were used for more than 200 million session minutes in companies all over the world – meaning that thousands of trips didn’t happen because of online meetings.
