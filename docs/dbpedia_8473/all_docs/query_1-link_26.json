In this context, the parties discussed the implementation of the existing economic potential and the possibility of holding a meeting of the Armenian-Syrian intergovernmental commission in the near future.\n\nThe Ambassador thanked Armenia for humanitarian assistance. Mohammad Ahmad Haj Ibrahim stressed the important role of Syrian Armenians in the development and construction of the State. During the meeting, reference was made to the reconstruction campaign in Syria, as well as other issues of mutual interest."
