        "text": "Signatories call on the UN to issue a report on the human rights situation in the areas under Turkish control\n\n337 views Download as PDF This post is also available in: Arabic Font Size A A A\n\n337\n\nNinety-two Syrian, Arab, and foreign figures released this statement to revive the case of the Newroz Eve murder in Jindires after 40 days of its occurrence. This statement calls on the United Nations (UN) to issue a report on the human rights situation in the areas under Turkish control, including Afrin, Ras al-Ayn/Serê Kaniyê, Tell Abyad, A’zaz, and al-Bab, with an emphasis on the violations, particularly those targeting women, races, religious and ethnic groups.\n\nA statement in the fortieth of the Newroz torch martyrs in Jindires\n\nCalls for accountability and promises to achieve it diminished, as if nothing had happened\n\nOn 20 March 2023, members of the Eastern Army/Jaysh al-Sharqiya and Harakat al-Tahrir wa-l-Binaa/Liberation and Construction Movement (LCM) of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) opened fire on four Kurds of one family in the northern Syrian town of Jindires of Afrin district on 20 March 2023, as they lit a torch during celebrating Newroz eve.\n\nThe men killed were identified as;\n\n– Nazmi Othman, 38;\n\n– Farah al-Din Othman, 43;\n\n– Mohammed Othman, 42;\n\n– Mohammed Farah al-Din Othman, 18.\n\nThis heinous crime is yet another in the long list of systematic abuses perpetrated by SNA factions against the original civilians of Afrin during the five years of the Turkish occupation. The abuses included murder, arbitrary arrest, torture, sexual assault, kidnapping for ransom, forced marriages, harassment of the Kurdish and Yazidi populations, especially women, widespread appropriation of property and crops, denying return to IDPs, settlement expansion, and demographic changes. Throughout the last five years, these abuses have been documented periodically by several independent local and international human rights entities including the United Nations (UN), Amnesty International, and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria. The occupation and the involved abuses led to an unprecedented decrease in the Kurdish population in Afrin. Notably, the Newroz crime came at a time when Jindires was mired in ruin and destruction by the 6 February devastating Syria-Türkiye earthquake, as it was the worst affected. That said, the Turkish Army and allied SNA factions politicalized the humanitarian response to the quake in Jindires by discriminating against its original population; they went so far as to deny the Kurds and civilians who do not have links with military groups access to humanitarian assistance.\n\nIt has been forty days since the Newroz crime, during which people took out to the street in big protests, which are the first since 2018 in Jindires and Afrin. The protests denounced the murder and demanded that the perpetrators of this heinous crime be held accountable and the SNA faction be expelled from their areas. Several parties offered protesters promises of meeting their demands but without taking further practical steps at the date of this statement. The perpetrators are still at large and the SNA factions are still in their ruling positions with their fullest powers. Things calmed down and silence on the case has reigned as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe Turkish Government\n\nTo take immediate action to pressure its forces, the SNA factions, as well as the military and civilian police in Jindires and Afrin, to bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime and all of those responsible for the violations committed against the population while ensuring transparent and public trials before impartial courts that follow international standards.\n\nTo take all necessary measures to protect the civilians in Afrin and all of Syria along with assuming its responsibilities as an occupying power in maintaining order, public safety, and the rule of law.\n\nTo expel the SNA factions from the area and close their secret and public detention centers, and to stop arbitrary arrests, torture, forced displacement, and demographic change along with ensuring the commitment to the provisions of the 1907 Hague Agreement.\n\nTo hand over the management of those areas to a civil administration elected by Afrin’s original population and to fully support its work to help it return expropriated property, stop seizures, abolish royalties imposed on civilians, and create conditions for the dignified and safe return of all those forcibly displaced from the region.\n\nTo take effective measures to stop the advancement of the terrorist-classified Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly al-Nusra Front, in Afrin and other northern Syria regions. Notably, the HTS used the crime as a pretext to advance in Jindires and its surroundings.\n\nThe National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the Syrian Interim Government, and all political bodies within it\n\nTo fulfill their pledges to hold the crime’s perpetrators accountable and bring justice to the families of the dead.\n\nTo publicly apologize to victims for their participation in and support of Operation Olive Branch in 2018.\n\nTo assume legal, political, and moral responsibilities regarding the crimes committed in Afrin, to intervene to stop the violations of the armed groups, and to support the demands of the local population.\n\nThe United Nations and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria\n\nTo end the Turkish occupation and place Afrin under international observation.\n\nTo release a briefing on the human rights situation in northern Syria, particularly in the areas under the effective control of Turkey, including Afrin, Ras al-Ayn/Serê Kaniyê, Tell Abyad, A’zaz, and al-Bab, with an emphasis on the violations, particularly those targeting women, races, religious and ethnic groups.\n\nSignatories:\n\nJad al-Karim
