        "text": "Several parties perpetrated the reported arrests, including the Military Police, Sham Legion/Faylaq al-Sham, and Sultan Muhammad al-Fateh Brigade/Liwa Sultan Muhammad al-Fateh\n\n770 views Download as PDF This post is also available in: Arabic Font Size A A A\n\n770\n\nIn October 2020, arbitrary arrests/detentions committed against civilian Kurds in the Kurdish-majority Syrian region of Afrin intensified compared to September, as perpetrators took no heed of the recommendations laid by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic to cease such abuses.[1]\n\nRelying on its network of field researchers that operates in areas across Afrin and other credible source, Syrians for Truth and Justice (STJ) documented at least 135 arrests/detentions and forced disappearances in October 2020. Among the detained were five women and a teenage boy.\n\nMoreover, STJ documented the release of 49 persons, including two women and the teenage boy, after some of these individuals, or/and their family members paid fines/bails, either in Turkish Lira (TL), or in Syrian Pound (SYP).\n\nIncluding three women, 86 persons were still locked away incommunicado at the time of writing on 15 November 2020.\n\nIt ought to be mentioned that the reported arrests demonstrate the violations committed in only six of Afrin’s districts in October, for STJ failed to document those carried out in Shaykh al-Hadid district.\n\nIn the districts in question, the arrests were carried out chiefly by the Military Police, Levant Front/al-Jabha al-Shamiya, and Sultan Muhammad al-Fateh Brigade/Liwa Sultan Muhammad al-Fateh. In additional cases, mostly individual, other security services and opposition armed groups were implicated.\n\nThis report essentially draws on information obtained by STJ’s field researchers, active in the six target districts, in addition to interviews with local sources, including family members of the detainees, and others affiliated with the opposition armed groups. The information about and names of the victims were thoroughly crosschecked, including those of 74 detainees that STJ collected, and others that the aforementioned sources provided.\n\nIt is also important to mention that a commander of the Military Police has in a former testimony reported to STJ that Turkey ordered opposition armed groups in Afrin “not to harass or arrest civilians,” as it has tasked the Military Police with carrying out arrests/detentions. However, the reported figures and documented arrests suggest otherwise.\n\n1. Arrests in Afrin District\n\nIn Afrin district and administratively affiliated areas, STJ documented the arrest of six persons in October, including a teenage boy. The teenager was released, but the other five are still held incommunicado. The arrests were carried out as follows:\n\nOn 2 October, in Afrin district’s center, the Civil Police arrested Bankeen Muhammad at a checkpoint, set up at the entrance to Afrin city. Bankeen, born in Shaykh al-Hadid district, was transferred to the Maratah Central Prison to be brought before a judge and pay a fine, uninformed of its reason, or motive.\n\nOn 2 October, in Maratah village, Adnan Janji, 23, Mustafa Abdurrahman Khalil, 24, and the teenage boy Bassam Abdo Qlaij, 16, were arrested by the personnel of a Military Police checkpoint, set up near Qestel village, for their alleged attempt at illegal entry to Turkey. At the time of writing, Bassam was already released, but the other two were still held incommunicado.\n\nAll three detainees used to live in Turkey and were forcibly deported for not having a Kimlik, i.e. the Temporary Protection Identity Document, when the Turkish government embarked on a campaign against Syrians with illegal residence status nearly a year ago, said a local source, who is a relative of one of these detainees.\n\nIn the first week of October, also in Afrin district’s center, the Political Security Service arrested Ibrahim Hayder Osman at his home in the Mahmoudiyah neighborhood. Ibrahim, born in Juwayq village, was uninformed of the charges against him. Ibrahim’s specific arrest date is unidentified, and he is still held incommunicado.\n\nOn 25 October, in Afrin district’s center, the Military Police arrested Adnan Mansour Hamza at Haret al-Bubanah neighborhood. He was still locked away in detention at the time of writing.\n\nAdnan owns a soap plant, and maintains strong ties with the director of the Maabatli Local Council, himself arrested earlier, a local source told STJ.\n\n2.
