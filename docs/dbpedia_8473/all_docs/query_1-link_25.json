His Holiness stated that the Mother See is in constant contact with the Primate of the Armenian Diocese of Damascus and the Primates of the Sister Church, and that every effort is being made to bring the problems of the Middle East to the international community's attention in ecumenical meetings and other various platforms, and to contribute to the conflict resolution.\n\nHis Holiness also informed the Ambassador about the spiritual and material support rendered to the Syrian Armenians by the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin.\n\nAmbassador Mohammad Ahmad Haj Ibrahim expressed gratitude for the support to Syria during this difficult period. The ambassador also highlighted the role of the Syrian-Armenian community, who have always enjoyed great respect in the country, in overcoming the existing challenges.\n\nThe Ambassador of Syria conveyed to His Holiness the greetings and best wishes of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, Grand Mufti of Syria.\n\nPraying for the restoration of peace in Syria, His Holiness asked for Godâ€™s protection of the Syrian people and wished that as a result of the rehabilitative work in the country, everyone would soon be able to return to their place of residence."
