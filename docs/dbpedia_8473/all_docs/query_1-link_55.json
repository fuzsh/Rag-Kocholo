        "text": "We, the families of those kidnapped by ISIS, are writing to the U.S. administration to ask for support in the search for our loved ones. When ISIS entered Northeast Syria, our loved ones were among the first to stand up against the extremist group, leading to them being kidnapped and disappeared. While information regarding the missing is extremely difficult to collect, estimates by human rights groups suggest that between 8,000 and 10,000 civilians remain missing.\n\nWhen the U.S. and its allies defeated the terrorist group in March 2019, we were hopeful that information about our family members would follow. However, we have not heard about any strategies or attempts to find or return those who were abducted.\n\nWe write to you filled with pain, struggling with aching hearts for our sons, daughters, wives, husbands, mothers, and fathers. We have the right to know the fates of our loved ones and do all we can to search for them every day. However, we cannot do it alone and it is the responsibility of the United States and its allies to lead the search.\n\nWe ask that the U.S. administration:\n\n1- Immediately open an investigation and review evidence of ISIS crimes collected by the U.S. and Kurdish forces.\n\nDuring the fight against ISIS, the U.S. and allied forces entered ISIS facilities, collecting a wide variety of data, including physical documents, computers, and hard drives. We demand a thorough search of this data for information regarding those kidnapped in Northeast Syria. Declassifying some of the information and sharing it with human rights organizations engaged in investigations could provide strong leads and help us in our search for our loved ones.\n\n2- Facilitate the interrogation and questioning of detained ISIS fighters in Northeast Syria regarding the issue of those missing and kidnapped by ISIS.\n\nWe believe that ISIS fighters are the single best source to obtain information on the missing, including the location of ISIS prisons and mass graves. The SDF must integrate questions regarding the names and possible locations and fates of missing persons into interrogations of detained ISIS fighters.\n\nto address widespread fear that those kidnapped by ISIS may be wrongfully detained alongside ISIS fighters. While many families have received ad hoc information that this may be the case, there is currently no path for them to confirm who is in SDF\n\n4- Make the search for the missing and kidnapped by ISIS a stabilization priority of the S. government in Northeast Syria\n\nLasting stability in the area will not be possible without answers about the missing and kidnapped by ISIS. Having a clear public statement from the U.S. administration on this issue will encourage other states, including members of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS as well as local authorities, to take similar actions and prioritize the issue of the missing.\n\nWe are families who were shattered because of the war, and are now joined in our dream of being reunited with our loved ones or at least knowing what happened to them. It is the U.S. administrationâ€™s responsibility to take action to protect human rights and help us learn the fate of our loved ones. As families, we strongly want peace, however we believe that the way to a peaceful end to the ongoing conflict must start with the truth and knowing what happened to those who were kidnapped in their fight against terrorism.\n\nWe request a meeting between representatives of the families of the missing and kidnapped by ISIS with U.S. officials to listen to and discuss these demands. We believe that we lose vital evidence every passing day, and look forward to your support on this urgent matter.\n\nWe thank you for your attention and we look forward to hearing from you."
