        "text": "Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in 570 CE in a mountain town located on a high desert plateau in western Arabia. He is believed to be the “Seal of the Prophets” – the last messenger in the long line of Prophets that includes Prophet Isa (AS) and Prophet Musa (AS). Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the founder of Islam and the proclaimer of the Holy Quran.\n\nBecause he was chosen as the last messenger of the word of Allah SWT, Muslims from all over the world strive to follow his Sunnah (lifestyle). Here is everything you need to know about the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the miraculous events at the time of the Messenger’s (PBUH) birth.\n\nWho Was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH) is the last Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT and the founder of Islam. According to the history of Islam, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, and worked as a merchant for most of his life. However, at the age of 40, a light sparked inside Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which made his search for answers about the Almighty Allah SWT. That is when Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received his first revelation inside cave Hira and was declared the Prophet (PBUH) of Islam and the proclaimer of the Holy Quran.\n\nSince then, the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT made it his life’s mission to spread Islam and the message of Allah SWT. He travelled from Makkah to Madinah and fought several battles in the name of Allah SWT. By 630 CE, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) had unified most of Arabia.\n\nThe Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT is an example for Muslims worldwide. He told his followers that the secret to a successful life in this world and the Hereafter is that one should abide by the teachings of the Holy Quran and follow his Sunnah.\n\nWhen Was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) Born?\n\nThe views aren’t unanimous when it comes to the exact date of birth of the beloved Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). In certain places, it is stated that the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT was born on 1st or 2nd Rabi al-Awwal (12 or 13 April 570 CE). Others say that He was born on the 8th or 9th of Rabi al-Awwal (19 or 20 April 570 CE).\n\nHowever, the date that the majority agrees on is that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born on a Monday, 12th Rabi al-Awwal (April 22 570CE).\n\nThe year the beloved Messenger (PBUH) was born was named the Elephant Year after the event in which Allah SWT sent down Ababeel to protect the Holy Kaaba from the Abyssinian Army. Al-Mutallib Bin Abdullah narrates, “I and the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT was born in the Year of the Elephant.” (Sahih Bukhari and Tirmidhi)\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH), when asked about the significance of fasting on Mondays, said, “This is the day on which I was born and the day on which I received revelation.” (Sahih Bukhari)\n\nWhere Is the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) House in Makkah?\n\nThe house of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is situated on Suq al-Layl Street, in close proximity to the Holy Kaaba, Great Mosque, in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. To be exact, as you leave Masjid Al-Haram and walk towards mount Safa, about half a kilometre away, you will see the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which has been renovated into a library today.\n\nThe layout of the House\n\nThe house in which Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born was 13 metres in length and 12 metres in height. It comprised one large living area, a bedroom which was also the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and a storage room. Today, the house of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is a modest two-story library.\n\nThe Life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\n\nDuring the days of his adulthood, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was given the title of “Al-Amin” (the trustworthy) and “Al-Sadiq” (the truthful). Even before Prophethood, he was respected and loved by everyone.\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH) of Allah SWT played an important role in the reconstruction of the Holy Kaaba and the treaty of Hudaibiya. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) got married to Khadija (RA), after which Allah SWT revealed the first revelation to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\n\nThe Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT then started spreading Islam, during which he faced many challenges. However, despite all hardships, Muhammad (PBUH) remained steadfast. On Allah’s command, he migrated to Madinah and fought several battles to spread the light of Islam.\n\nEarly Childhood\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH) had a very tough childhood. He lost his father even before he was born and his mother at the age of six. After being orphaned, his grandfather Abdul Muttalib took custody of the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT.\n\nHowever, he also passed away when Muhammad (PBUH) was just eight years old. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was then brought up by his uncle Abu Talib who taught him trade and how to fight. Even throughout his childhood, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was known as a trustworthy and loving child.\n\nMiraculous Events during Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) Birth\n\nThe birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was no ordinary event. It was the greatest blessing and favour to all Muslims. According to Islamic history, Allah SWT designed miraculous events when the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT was born. These were things that no one had ever thought about or experienced before.\n\n“Indeed Allah SWT conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger (PBUH) from among themselves, reciting unto them His verses, and purifying them, and instructing them (in) the Book (Quran) and Al-Hikmah, (the wisdom and the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH)), while before that they had been in manifest error,” (Holy Quran, 3:164)\n\nHowever, most of these events aren’t authentically proven. Close to the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), there is a narration that 14 balconies of the Persian King Kisraa’s palace magically collapsed. Not only this, but the sacred fire which had been burning for over 1000 years in the Temple of Fars, extinguished, and the churches located on Lake Sawah in Iraq also collapsed and sank to the ground.\n\nFurthermore, approximately 360 idols fell flat and broke within the Holy Kaaba. Many reputed Quraysh leaders, including Abdul Muttalib (RA), witnessed the falling idols’ miracle. It is reported that the idols lay broken for over 24 hours, and no one picked them up.\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH), in light of the miracle of his birth, stated, “I am a result of the supplication of my father Ibrahim (AS) and the glad-tidings brought by Isa (AS). And my mother – when she bore me – saw that a light shone out from her, which lit up the palaces in Syria.” [Al-Haakim]\n\nWhen Did Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) Die?\n\nAfter the conquest of Makkah, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), along with his fellow companions, decided to settle in Makkah. While performing the final pilgrimage (Hajjat ul-Wida), the Prophet (PBUH) of the Muslim Ummah delivered the last sermon at Mount Arafat.\n\nHowever, upon his return to Madinah, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) fell severely ill and peacefully passed away on 13 Rabi al-Awwal 11 AH (June 8, 632 CE) at the age of 62.\n\nHow Old Was the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) When His Mother Died?\n\nIbn Ishaq narrates, “Before his birth, the Prophet’s (PBUH) mother, Aaminah, was conscious of a light within her when she was pregnant with him, which one day shone from her so intensely that she could see the castles and palaces of Syria.”\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH) lost his mother, Aaminah (RA), when he was just six years old. The tragic incident took place when Aminah (RA) took young Muhammad (PBUH) to visit his father’s grave in Yathrib (Madinah). She, along with her son, Abdul Muttalib, and Umm Ayman, stayed in Madinah for a month. However, on their return, Aminah (RA) fell ill and died at a place between Makkah and Madinah.\n\nWhen Did Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) Father Die?\n\nAbdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib was the father of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). He was a tradesman by profession. Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and his caravan were on their back from Syria when they took refuge in Madinah, where he got sick and passed away almost six months before Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born.\n\nWhat Was Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) Grandfather’s Name?\n\nThe name of Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) grandfather was Abdul Muttalib (RA). He was the fourth chief of the Banu Hashim tribe. It is said that when Abdul Muttalib (RA) took his grandchild to the Holy Kaaba and named him Muhammad (PBUH), which meant “he who is praised,” the idols placed there fell after three days. As soon as the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was taken to the Holy Kaaba for the naming ceremony, the four corners of the walls of the Kaaba spoke and declared:\n\n“There is none worthy of worship except Allah, and Muhammad is the Seal of Prophethood.”\n\nAfter Aaminah (RA) passed away, it was Abdul Muttalib (RA) who took care of the young Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Sadly, when Muhammad (PBUH) was eight years old, Abdul Muttalib (RA), who became sick and old, died at 82 years of age.\n\nSummary – Birthplace of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\n\nProphet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in the city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, on 12th Rabi al-Awwal 570 CE. He was given the name “Muhammad” by his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. The birthplace of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is located nearby Makkah Masjid Al Haram. The house in which the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT grew up has been converted into a library by the Saudi Government."
