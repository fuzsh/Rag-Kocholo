        "text": "Whoever loved me, he should love these two i.e., Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein. (Ibn Hibban)\n\nAl-Hassan and Al-Hussein were brothers, not twins.\n\nAl-Hassan was the older brother. But there was a strong bond and love between them perhaps as much as twins have.\n\nThey ate and played together. They were always found together and received much love from the same family members. Their close bond as described in different narratives made me pair them up together on this post, although I know they were individually unique and have a long lost of fine qualities each to their names.\n\nBelow are 10 noble attributes of Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein.\n\n1. Pure Lineage\n\nThey were sons of the Messenger of Allah’s daughter – Fatimah; leader of the women of the worlds, daughter of Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, and among the most beloved of women to the Messenger. Their father, Ali bin Abi Talib was the first youth to embrace Islam.\n\n2. Unique Names\n\nThey were the first to be given their names because those two names were not known before Islam.\n\nIt was reported on the authority of ‘Umar bin Sulaiman that he said:\n\nAl-Hassan and Al-Hussein are from the names of the people of Paradise and they were not known during the Jahiliyyah.” (Usdul – Ghabah, vol 2 in ‘Child companions around the Prophet (Peace be Upon Him))\n\n3. Resemblance to the Messenger (PBUH)\n\nBoth of them resembled the Prophet physically and in their mannerisms as well.\n\nIt is reported on the authority of ‘Ali:\n\nAl-Hassan was the person who most resembled the Messenger of Allah (SAW) from his face to his navel and Al-Hussein was the person who most resembled him in what was below that. (At-Tirmidhi)\n\n4. Graduates of the Prophetic School\n\nThe Prophet was in their lives right from birth. He called Adhan in their ears, performed Tahnik on them and gave them their names.\n\nThey were both cared for and mentored by the Prophet from childhood in faith, character and morals. He loved them and they loved him too. He would always reassure them of his deep love and made sincere supplications for them. They were raised among a close and loving family fold.\n\nHe referred to them as his two Raihanahs – sweet basil; meaning beloved in this context.\n\n5. Bequeathal\n\nAl-Hassan and Al-Hussein were taken to the Messenger of Allah during his final illness and he bequeathed something to them.\n\nHe said:\n\nAs for Al-Hassan, he has repect and authority which I have, while as for Al-Hussein, he has my courage and my generosity. (Kanzul-‘Ummal) in Child companions around the Prophet (Peace be Upon Him))\n\n6. Very Closely Linked in Narrations\n\nMany hadiths do not mention Al-Hassan without mentioning Al-Hussein. There was neither superiority nor competition in their relationship and accompanying narrations.\n\nA hadith reported on the authority of Usamah ibn Zaid states:\n\nThese two are my sons and the sons of my daughter; Oh, Allah! I love them, so love them and love those who love them. (At-Tirmidhi)\n\n7. Masters of Youth in Paradise\n\nIt is reported on the authority of Hudhaifah that the Prophet said:\n\nOh, Hudhaifah! Gabriel came to me and he gave me the glad tidings that Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein are the Masters of the young men of Paradise. (Ahmad)\n\n8. Love and Esteem of the Companions\n\nThey were highly respected and revered by the companions. They seized every opportunity possible to honor them and be close to them knowing how much Allah’s Messenger loved them without a shadow of doubt.\n\nWhen ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab set up the Treasury, he gave orders for Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein along with those who participated in the Battle of Badr to be paid five thousand dirhams.\n\n9. Knowledgeable and Skilled\n\nBoth grandchildren were reported to be learned scholars, knowledgeable in Islamic Jurisprudence.\n\nThey were also both eloquent; while Al-Hassan was known as an Orator and renowned for his great linguistic abilities and profound thoughts, Al-Hussein was very articulate and renowned for his poetry, speeches and wisdom.\n\n10. Piety and Virtuousness\n\nAl-Hassan and Al-Hussein had great virtues. They were both reported to have performed Hajj twenty five times on foot. Al-Hasan was said to have read chapter Al-Kahf every night before sleeping and Al-Hussein known for his unmatched charitable deeds.\n\nIbn ‘Abbas said:\n\nI have not regretted anything which I missed during my youth, except that I did not perform Hajj on foot; Al-Hassan performed Hajj on foot twenty-five times. (Tarikh ibn ‘Asakir, 4/216)\n\nAz-Zubair bin Bakkar said:\n\nMus’ab informed me that Husain performed Hajj twenty five times on foot. (p. 64. Young Companions around the Prophet (Peace be upon him))\n\nTime to Take Action\n\nIt is interesting to read stories such as those of Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein but of what benefit is it to your life – you may wonder.\n\nAfter all, they were blessed by Allah (SWT) with these noble attributes. They were among the chosen few, while you are just an ordinary fellow.\n\nHold on… no so fast!\n\nYou have a lot of lessons to take for your own life. Here are just a few points of benefit to reflect and take action upon:\n\n– Give good names and nicknames to your children.\n\n– Make du’a for your young ones and their future generation.\n\n– Guide your children to love, respect and partner with each other as siblings.\n\n– Verbalize and show affection to your young ones through your actions/ manners.\n\n– Shower the children and youth under your care with genuine love, care and concern.\n\n– Take your grandchildren as your children; and your grandparents as your parents.\n\n– Even if you are blessed with a noble lineage, keep striving to do good and put in maximum effort to boost your knowledge and skills.\n\nNow it’s over to you. Which other lessons and points of benefits can you take from the noble lives of Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein (RA)?"
