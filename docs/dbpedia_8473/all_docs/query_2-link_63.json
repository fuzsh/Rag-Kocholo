He resigned due to rising intra-Fatah violence in the West Bank. Jaber then served as deputy head of the General Intelligence Service (GIS) – under Tawfiq Tirawi. In 2009, he was appointed by Mahmoud Abbas as a senior adviser on military and governorate affairs. He stood as a candidate for deputy chairman of the FCC in 2017 against Mahmoud Aloul."
