        "text": "In order to stop the threats of war and violence in northern Syria:\n\nOur country, Syria, has suffered multiple blows in the last decade, bringing us to the disastrous status quo: at least one million citizens were killed and disabled, hundreds of thousands of detainees, missing persons, and the displacement of half of the population, turning the country into a fragile, failed and divided state within several areas of control, and a state of divisions on all levels.\n\nAt these moments, our country is exposed to an immediate threat that could eliminate it and make it difficult or possibly be an impossible dream to bring it back together, if the Turkish government carries out its threats and launches its military operation or its fifth war in the north to complete what it calls the “safe zone” along the borderline and 30KM deep which includes all Syrian border cities and towns in that region.\n\nThere is a good understanding of the Turkish concern over its “National Security” from the Turkish government’s friends and rivals within Syria and Turkey. This concern can be met through dialogue and negotiation in order to mitigate the apprehensions and provide guarantees to all parties. We do not approach war calls and resolving the issue through violence as it would only exacerbate the situation and create a hostile status considered unwanted by all Syrian components.\n\nRead Also:\n\nThere are those among Syrian refugees who positively perceive Turkey’s government and people’s welcoming approach since they fled from an authoritarian regime’s massacres and absolute violence. Some remain in north Syria: Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, and Turkmen.\n\nThe implementation of the announced plan for returning hundreds of thousands of refugees and their resettlement along the borderline in swiftly-built housing blocs will not have the effect the Turkish government is aiming for, as it deepens the social contradictions in the northern borderline areas of Syria and repeats the demographic change attempts which became history. Therefore, similar attempts would see no success as they caused disasters the world still suffers from its consequences.\n\nWe call for peace and seek dialogue, understanding, and compliance with international agreements such as international law and human rights covenants. This remains the right way to solve the Kurdish cause through Kurdish-Kurdish, Kurdish-Arab, and Kurdish-Turkish dialogues, but it also remains right to resolve the Syrian cause and might be the only viable way for a safe and civilized future.\n\nWe, the undersigned national forces and public figures, demand the Turkish government reverse the course of war and destruction. Call on the peoples of the world and free persons to echo our call, and we appeal to the United Nations, International Coalition against Terrorism and the European Union to act in every possible manner to prevent this imminent catastrophe currently confronts our country.\n\nSignatories:\n\nSulaiman al-Kfairi Opposition politician\n\nDr. John Nasta National Coordination Commission\n\nMizgin Yousif Head of Syrian Yazidi Council\n\nSamira al-Masalmah Writer\n\nAlis Mafraj Feminist activist\n\nLina Wafa’i Feminist and political activist\n\nJoumana Saif Lawyer\n\nRuwayda Kan’an Feminist and political activist\n\nSabiha Khalil Feminist and political activist\n\nRatib Sha’bo Writer, researcher and Former Detainee\n\nDr’ Abdullah Turkmani Writer and researcher\n\nWa’el Sawah Syrian writer\n\nAhmad al-Ramah Writer and researcher\n\nAdnan Makiyeh Administration board of Center of Democratic Republic studies\n\nRabee’ al-Shatti Administration board of Center of Democratic Republic studies\n\nAmal Mohammed Political activist\n\nGoman Hussain Kurdish political activist\n\nSameeha Nadir Political activist\n\nAmarji – Syrian Democratic Panels\n\nAbdullah Haj Mohammed Syrian politician\n\nIssam Dimashqi Opposition politician\n\nBassam al-Mar’i Political activist\n\nHussain Qasim political activist\n\nAli Rahmoun Politician\n\nAdil Center for human rights\n\nMustafa Oso Syrian Kurdish Independent political activist\n\nPh.
