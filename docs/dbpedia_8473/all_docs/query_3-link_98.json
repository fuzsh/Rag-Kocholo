        "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan\n\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto tongue, first emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan during the Mujahideen’s control of the Afghan capital Kabul after the 1989 withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.\n\nThe US invasion of Afghanistan in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks ended the Taliban's rule in 2001, only for it to resurface two decades later as perhaps a stronger political force.\n\nAt a news conference in Kabul on Tuesday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, now acting culture and information minister, announced the formation of a 33-member interim Cabinet.\n\nAlthough just three or four portfolios were allocated to other ethnic groups in the interim government, as most of them went to Pashtuns, Mujahid claimed that in the future, more people will be part of the government.\n\nWhile Pashtuns make up about half of Afghanistan's 35 million population, they largely live in the country's southern provinces.\n\nTajiks are the second-largest ethnic group, living primarily in provinces north of Kabul, such as Panjshir, and in border areas with Tajikistan. Tajiks are estimated to make up about a quarter of the population.\n\nAfter the Tajiks, the Hazaras are the next biggest ethnic group, accounting for around 10% of the country's population. Other ethnic groups living in Afghanistan include Uzbeks, Turkmens, Balochs, Gujars, and Nuristanis.\n\nThe acting head of the ministers, acting ministers, and other administrative positions in the interim Taliban administration are as follows:\n\nMullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund (acting head of ministers)\n\nBefore being appointed the Taliban administration's acting head of ministers or prime minister, Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund was the head of the powerful decision-making body, Rehbari Shura or leadership council, for 20 years.
