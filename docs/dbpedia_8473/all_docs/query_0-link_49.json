        "meta_description": "Abstract Through an ethnographic account of Syrian halaqas (Sunni religious circles) from the 1980s until the 2011 Syrian revolution, this article argues that halaqas have a revolutionary potential. The analysis demonstrates that Syrian religious circles are spaces of self-transformation that have heterotopic qualities. The Darayya halaqa studied here is a space where present and future are collapsed: a space in which future revolutionary selves and societies are already enacted. This temporal collapse is thus simultaneously a scalar one, for through the emergence of a relational or unbounded subject, a revolutionary project is being performed. This project is, moreover, without a preexisting program that its members seek to implement in a distant future; it is rather a revolutionary project that is perpetually in the making through discussions and actions happening within it.",

        "text": "The Syrian revolution represents an extraordinary experience for hundreds of thousands of Syrians, as much a moral as a political trial, as much a renewal of the self as a social change. It is an insurrection against oneself and a revolution against what exists.\n\n—Yassin Al-Haj Saleh, La Question syrienne, 2016 (my translation)\n\nWhat makes a circle revolutionary? This article examines Syrian halaqas, a term that means “circle” in Arabic and originally describes the spatial configuration in which students and their teacher seat themselves for a Quranic lesson, often inside a mosque or religious study center. In contrast to classic revolutionary circles, a halaqa is not established with the aim of discussing politics or revolutionary ideas, but to learn about Islam and to shape pious and ethical selves. However, the transformation of the self is hardly an apolitical endeavor, and the halaqa not only describes the spatial configuration of meetings and specifies the format of a religious class, but is also a social shape that accounts for the relationship between its members and society at large.\n\nThis article mainly traces the evolution of the Anas halaqa—later known as the Darayya or nonviolent circle—from its formation to the establishment of the Darayya local council1 in the second year of the Syrian revolution (2012),2 and contrasts this halaqa to two others that also gained a central role in the revolution. It asks: What turned a local religious circle into a laboratory of radical political thought and actions, and how did its members become a revolutionary vanguard? Moreover, how is the halaqa a heterotopic space where different temporalities are at play, and through which self and society are constantly transformed and politics reimagined and performed through dialogues? This article is based on ethnographic engagement with Syrian revolutionaries, local councils, and former political detainees in Gaziantep, Turkey between 2014 and 2019, conducted during doctoral and postdoctoral research. The discussion particularly draws on conversations with three circle members—Ahmad, Youssef, and Samer3—who joined at the circle's inception and were among its most active and dedicated members, despite ideological differences and divergent life paths. Some of these conversations happened online, as complementary fieldwork was canceled due to the ongoing pandemic. The article also benefited from continuous dialogue with my main interlocutors throughout the writing process, two of whom offered insightful feedback on earlier drafts.\n\nSamer, Youssef, and Ahmad all lived in Darayya, an agricultural suburb of Damascus mainly composed of artisans and farmers, whose inhabitants started to become civil servants or to attend university in the 1970s, and many more by the 1990s. Most of local preacher Abdelakram Al-Saqqa's students belonged to farmers’, artisans’, and civil servants’—mainly teachers’—families. Youssef, the son of an electrician, had left Syria in the late 2000s to study abroad, and continued to participate in the circle's conversations online. Described as courageous and determined, he was the group's informal leader, along with his friend and symbol of the nonviolent resistance Yahya Shurbaji.4 Ahmad, a rather reserved person, is the son of a schoolteacher. He survived the revolution, the four-year siege of Darayya, and forced displacement inside and outside Syria. He is one of the main engineers of the Darayya local council, alongside halaqa members Mohammad and Youssef. Samer, the son of an influential local family, was among the members of the circle jailed in the 2000s. He left to study abroad after his release, but continued to participate in online activities and returned to Syria when the revolution started.\n\nOf the 30 male5 students who composed the first circle around Al-Saqqa in the late 1980s, a dozen members, then in their thirties, remained active when the revolution started in 2011; meanwhile, members of a second circle, then in their twenties—the circles were organized by age—became more active. Some members migrated to study or work in Europe and the Gulf, while others worked 12–14 hours a day or had families to support, so lacked time to meet with friends. Still others distanced themselves from the core group for security reasons, especially after 24 of them were arrested in 2003. The revolution's repression also hit the circle hard: four members6 were killed in the regime's jails and a dozen more were detained for several months to several years.\n\nThis article explores how a halaqa could become one of the most important political forums in Darayya before the Syrian revolution and lead to the organization of the most influential and effective local council of the revolution. What kind of revolutionary morphology emerges from such a circle? In other words, what kind of revolutionary subjects, actions, and temporality are created by and through the halaqa? Bringing together the nascent anthropology of revolution (Al-Khalili 2019; Cherstich et al. 2020; Mittermaier 2014) and the literature on self-formation and its relation to (revolutionary) politics and asceticism (Foucault 1997; Ghamari-Tabrizi 2016; Holbraad 2014; Mahmood 2001), I argue that the halaqa is a social shape that carries revolutionary potential. Indeed, halaqas are dedicated to the transformation of the self, a political endeavor that is heterotopic, for it is performative of the future in the present. However, not all halaqas become revolutionary circles. Yet not unlike in other revolutionary projects, the transformation of society starts at the level of the self and with the self, since the future is first embodied within the self of the circle's participants, and in the relations and sociality created within that circle. In other words, a scaling-up from the intimate to the collective is operated within and by the circle itself. In fact, the halaqa can be understood as a heterotopia: it is a space where a utopic yet indeterminate future is already enacted (see Foucault 1986). Indeed, there is no clear plan about the future, but rather a series of principles from which a project will emerge along the way.\n\nIn tracing its history, this article shows (1) why the circle's shape makes it a revolutionary (i.e., heterotopic) entity, and (2) how it expands and moves through a scaling-up from the self to the society, the individual to the collective, thus cultivating continuity rather than rupture between the intimate, the ethical, the religious, and the political. Moreover, it shows that the particularity of the halaqa as a revolutionary shape is its very indeterminacy: there is no predefined project or guiding ideology that leads toward the constitution of a predetermined future self and society. The shape of future selves and of society are both enacted in the present and created within and by the halaqa. Hence, revolutionary politics and selves can be described as a process that is both already happening and continuously being shaped in the present, rather than a distant and utopic future horizon.\n\nCircles and Islam\n\nHalaqas are traditionally places where subjects such as memorizing the Quran, jurisprudence, exegesis, and Islamic law are taught. Following the Prophet's tradition, the teacher does not sit in the middle of the circle, but rather forms a part of it with his students. This physical positioning symbolizes the equality between the students themselves, and between the students and their teacher, although in practice most teachers do not leave much space for discussion and questions. The boys joined the religious institute headed by Al-Saqqa aged 9 to get a religious education, as it was the only authorized institute in Darayya. In the early years, they did not study directly with Al-Saqqa: “it was only when I was 14 that things became more organized and we were distributed by age and level to different halaqas and teachers. I joined Al-Saqqa's one with the brighter and older students,” remembered Ahmad.\n\nAl-Saqqa's circle was untraditional and unorthodox in many ways. Al-Saqqa did not have a formal religious education, but studied in the Zayd Bin Thabet mosque that followed the dominant Sufi current in Syria (see Pierret 2013). Yet Al-Saqqa inscribed himself within the reformist and revivalist traditions, and understood Islam as inherently democratic and egalitarian. He followed the unorthodox and minoritarian thinkers Jawdat Sa'id and Malek Bennabi, who were criticized by the religious elite and the majority of the ulama for developing an Islamic humanism sometimes understood as a theology of liberation (see Pierret 2013; Séniguer 2014). These two thinkers heavily influenced the young circle members, although each developed a different degree of affinity with their work.\n\nThese “democratic principles” were applied within Al-Saqqa's lessons: the Anas circle was a space where discussion was welcomed and even encouraged, and where “all had an equal voice,” remembered Youssef. Al-Saqqa ran his circle in a “democratic way,” Youssef continued, explaining how Al-Saqqa would only briefly speak at the beginning of each lesson before letting his students lead the session. He thus made a virtue of the circle's shape, embracing its “egalitarian” and “democratic” potentials in the way he taught his students.\n\nIn its shape, the Anas halaqa sharply contrasted with surrounding circles, as well as with Sufi and Shi'i circles, which are marked by a strong concentric hierarchy among initiates, going from an outer (larger) to an inner (smaller) circle, with the master at the center. It also contrasted both with religious scholars’ public lessons (dars)—which can be attended by all, and where the speaker stands in front of rows of people in the manner of a preacher—and with school lessons (muhadara), wherein students are not allowed to speak, physical punishments are in order, and pupils are taught in a strict hierarchical way not dissimilar to the military. This hierarchy reproduces the regime's organizational structure, wherein the military and the leader have the most authority.\n\nMoreover, Al-Saqqa was particularly interested in discussing the Quran and hadiths, and in revisiting their meaning critically, as well as expanding his students’ reading list to non-religious topics. “He asked us to critically question everything, even the hadiths. He asked us to take nothing for granted, even what he told us,” recalled Ahmad. He did not ask his students to memorize the surat, ayat, and hadiths, but rather to discuss them, and to see the contradictions between some hadiths and the Quran, and between different schools and interpretations. “I go with the truth wherever it goes,” was his golden rule. This meant that “one shouldn't be fanatic about a school or a statement, and should be ready to abandon it if it proves to be untrue,” explained Samer. This was criticized by many outside the circle, who judged that its members were doing things according to themselves (‘ala kifon) rather than following the text, recalled Ahmad. However, in doing so, Al-Saqqa was inspired by religious thinkers such as Sa'id and Bennabi, who are prone to self-criticism and take a critical approach to religious exegesis.\n\nFor this reason, more than the content of his lessons, it was the way they were given that shaped Al-Saqqa's students durably. Contrasting his circle with others, Samer said,\n\nI remember that there was a tendency to teach us how to think. Sometimes it was boring: we didn't feel that we were progressing especially when we compare with our friends in other mosques who were progressing more in the traditional learning: they were memorizing more.\n\nAl-Saqqa would often give his students untraditional exercises: he asked them to reflect on the texts and to apply Quranic ethics in their everyday life, in the reformist fashion (cf. Mahmood 2001). Every week, one of the students chose a subject and wrote one page about it. Ahmad recalled,\n\nHe gave us writing and reading assignments starting with traditional things like patience, honesty, but over time we started to discuss what we called at the time “the Muslim's role in society or the Muslim's mission in life.”\n\nMoreover, one of the central pillars of the circle was nonviolence (la ‘unef), which is developed in Sa'id's theology of nonviolence, and from which he develops a heterodox understanding of jihad. It led the Anas circle to stand in sharp contrast to all other religious interpretations and caused them to often be understood by Islamists as secularists (‘almaniin). Moreover, they felt that the nonviolent atmosphere, methodology, and ideas developed within the circle contrasted sharply with the other spheres of their lives. “The idea of nonviolence was already a revolution in itself in our town,” said Samer, as he remembered how widespread was the “culture of violence.” “When you said something stupid you'd get slapped at home and at school!” he continued. “Violence was something normal and daily in our society,” he concluded.\n\nIn this first period, the halaqa's primary goals were thus personal: to improve oneself, and to shape oneself to be a good Muslim. This was a pious attitude to enact and embody in their everyday lives: it was not only about religious duties such as praying or fasting, but encompassed their lives as an ethical posture, shaping relations with their family, friends, and community. “We felt we have to do what is right even if the majority of people are not doing it. In the early 90s we didn't care about the government; we cared about saying the truth,” said Ahmad.\n\nThe circle was thus a space of self-transformation where ideas took shape through collective discussions, in which members invariably disagreed at first, as the main aim of the halaqa was to form (self-)critical ethical subjects. There is, in fact, a long tradition of self-cultivation in Islam that is often associated with the dialogic structure of the circle itself. But the shaping of Islamic and ethical selves within the semiprivate sphere of the halaqas is far from an apolitical project (Ghamari-Tabrizi 2016; Mahmood 2001). Indeed, the correlate of the cultivation of pious selves is the transformation of social life, since it is not “a withdrawal from socio-political engagement in as much as the form of piety it seeks to realize entails the transformation of many aspects of social life” (Mahmood 2001: 829).\n\nThis was particularly vivid in the Anas circle, since its members understood the transformation of the self as continuous and coterminous with the transformation of the society and, later, of the political regime. They developed a theory of gradual change in which transformation spread from the self to bigger circles—family, friends and acquaintances, neighbors, and the local community. As Ahmad summarized, “we understood change to start at the basis, at the bottom: if you change yourself you can change your family, then your surroundings, and eventually things will change for the entire society.”\n\nHowever, at the time they did not speak or think of regime change, although contrasting positions existed within the circles, with some members preferring to keep change at the individual level while others understood it in a more holistic way—the latter being more common. Yet the central idea remained that one should first experience these changes for oneself before advocating them. This was both an ethical and a political posture, since the youth knew their position would bother the security apparatus and they did not want to expose others to risks that they did not take for themselves.\n\nShrinking and dividing the circle\n\nOn 3 May 2003, the shebab and their teacher were summoned to the military intelligence branch in Damascus, marking the height of their confrontation with the mukkhabarat. Of the 24 initially arrested, 11 were transferred to the infamous Sednaya prison until April 2004, and four remained until definite release in November 2005. In the security branches and in prison, the halaqa tried to reconvene, but mainly to pray together and to take a few minutes to comment on a sura or aya.\n\nThe halaqa's imprisonment marked a turning point in the circle's history and goals: it strengthened the political objectives of some, mainly those jailed in Sednaya, and led to the exile and distancing of others who felt the pressure from the security apparatus was too strong. After their detention, the circle went through a dead period, only resuming meetings—albeit secretly— a year after all members were released. By then, the circle was reduced by half since some had fled the country, while others distanced themselves after marrying or starting demanding jobs, or otherwise refused to risk reimprisonment. In the sessions, the members did two things: read a sura or a page of the Quran and discuss it briefly, and speak about current affairs worldwide. Until the revolution, sessions mainly aimed to maintain a communications channel among the shebab—notwithstanding links through online platforms with members in exile—so that they could regain momentum.\n\nSednaya was, however, also lived as a period of “political education” and of expansion of the circle's political connections. Reflecting back on this period, Ahmad said, “For me it was an opportunity to expand my vision … We had been locked up in a small space of discussion, and now we had to learn more and more.” This led to understanding their struggle as a direct confrontation with the regime (al nizam). They also started to meet with political figures encountered in jail, and with those who advocated for their release, joining them in different secret political meetings. In these meetings outside of the circle, as well as through their advocating for civil disobedience and nonviolence online, their influence became national and later led to the establishment of a national nonviolent movement close to the secular opposition.\n\nDuring these years, many principles that later appeared as central to the revolution crystallized. Until Benali stepped down in Tunisia in late 2010, the circle was not publicly active; at this point, though, it became a major actor in the Syrian uprising.\n\nCircles in revolution\n\nWhen the uprising started in 2011 we started to organize the protests in Darayya. We were fortified by our experiences in 2000 and 2003. We knew better how to protect ourselves; we were used to working in secrecy.\n\nThese were Samer's words. Moreover, within the circle, people knew, understood, and trusted one another, which facilitated underground work and helped them to easily assign roles among themselves according to their skills and personality. Circle members individually participated in the first protest organized in Syria, which took place in downtown Damascus in February 2011. The circle first found itself drawn in by the events: “We had the feeling that things had started to be beyond our discussions … we were having sessions discussing different ideas, and suddenly we found that things had already started,” recalled Ahmad. Yet most of them did not think much before they started to protest: “as in the 2000–2003 period, we were waiting for an opportunity to take part in public actions,” Ahmad continued.\n\nThe circle, with its past experience organizing protests, imposed itself as the main organizer of the revolution in Darayya. In the first months of the revolution the group organized protests and candlelight vigils, distributed leaflets, spray-painted on walls, and organized debates. During the uprising, the circle members’ main challenge was to keep the protests nonviolent, for they conceived of their actions as figuring the future: a violent uprising would thus bring a violent regime. This meant choosing the songs that would be sung at the protests, and forbidding certain slogans and curses that they found violent. During the protests they tried to spot and stop any chanting of violent slogans, and afterward they would have long meetings discussing “every word” said at the protest, explained Ahmad. Summarizing their role, he added, “Our circle was the mastermind but not the leader of the protests: during the protests you would not notice many of us.” This dynamic lasted until the end of April 2011, when three protesters were killed and many injured. Soon after, the security situation started to make it harder to organize meetings. Moreover, other people started to take a bigger role in the protests. “The circle started to play the role of coordinator rather than initiator,” Ahmad explained.\n\nA few months after the revolution started, three circles became visible. Interestingly, they were also formed around halaqas in local mosques, but they adopted different methodologies and therefore developed different ideas and practices. However, the shape of the halaqa meant that these youths were used to meeting, discussing, and socializing together, and had similar religious and political orientations; it was therefore natural for them to work together. In a way, the halaqa appears as an “affinity group,” a “group of friends who remain connected for a long period of time, and are engaged in politics together and/or have a social life outside political action,” to borrow from Krøijer (2015: 11). They were thus not simply a group of friends (shalleh), youths from the same generation (shebab), or classmates (zumala) structured around specific spaces (schools or universities), activities (football, etc.), and personal affinities (friendship). There is thus something fundamental about the morphology of the halaqa that led to their importance in forming revolutionary selves, structures, and projects. Indeed, it presents Syrian revolutionaries “as the precipitation of relationships” rather than “human subjects [who] are actors who create relationships” (Strathern, in Mittermaier 2012: 251).\n\nThe circles later widened, embracing broader structures—coordination committees—that brought people from various paths together. However, the nonviolent circle was still identified as such, and continued to play a prominent role, positioning itself as a revolutionary vanguard throughout the revolution. Indeed, as well as influencing a nationwide nonviolent movement, in June 2011, the nonviolent circle members established a Local Coordination Committee (LCC) in Darayya in order to better fight the regime at the local, regional, and national levels. The committee was part of a network of LCCs that had emerged in many parts of Syria. Within the LCC a management committee was elected following a structure similar to the one that the nonviolent circle had established inside the mosque. However, the five elected members were quickly detained, and elections had to be run frequently due to ever-increasing arrests. This led the LCC to operate underground, and many of its members left town and went into hiding. A competing committee was also created by the “jihadi” circle, named “Darayya Committee the people want the downfall of the regime,” which tried to gain traction by playing on secularist versus Islamist and nonviolent versus violent social divisions, but the nonviolent circle's role remained prominent throughout the revolution. However, the nonviolent position of the Anas circle was increasingly criticized as nonviolent activists were killed and peaceful protests were attacked.\n\nIn order to make the revolutionaries stronger, Ahmad, one of the last circle members to survive in Darayya, worked to build a committee that would bring together representatives of the different groups of peaceful demonstrators and of the armed factions. By their opposition to the circles, the committees thus brought together people who did not specifically share a common past, did not have previous relations, and did not have identical political or religious views. They were also more diverse in terms of age and social background. The committee was composed of five people elected to coordinate actions between groups. Their work was mainly to keep armed activities under control and minimize their effects on civilians. This was the embryo of the local council that was created in October 2012 after the Great Massacre, during which the regime army killed seven hundred civilians in Darayya. If, in addition to the structure of the committee, many things made it different from the initial halaqas (e.g., the committee was not an affinity group sharing similar political and religious views and coming together around a teacher), it seems that the heterotopic nature of the circle still animated the committee: it embodied and enacted in the present the values and principles that the revolutionaries wished to see guiding the country's leadership in the future, while leaving the shape of the future government open.\n\nMoreover, the relation to time remained similar, as Ahmad described: “We didn't have time to think about the future … we had to focus on the present.” He later added, “If we thought too much about the future we would have stopped because nothing was clear! … so most of us were focusing on the moment.” Ahmad portrayed the spirit of the period:\n\nFor a long time during the revolution we were very much immersed in the practice on the ground so that for some time the overall goal of the revolution wouldn't be clear. … However, all our activities were directed towards a revolutionary change that we saw as inevitable [in 2012]. We knew things would not be the same anymore but we didn't really conceive what kind of change it would be.\n\nHowever, with the revolution turning into a war, Ahmad became increasingly isolated in his nonviolent position. Many circle members quit the council, as it had decided to cooperate with the local FSA (Free Syrian Army), while Ahmad thought it was better to stay within the council and use it as a tool to control the armed factions. Darayya local council became the only revolutionary council that managed to impose civilian control over the FSA, which made it a lasting symbol and example.\n\nConclusion: Halaqa, revolutionary heterotopia, and unbounded subjects\n\nThrough an ethnographic account of the functioning of the Darayya halaqa, this article argues that halaqas’ shape has a revolutionary potential, proposing a novel understanding of heterotopia in which the halaqa appears as a place where a utopia is made to exist through performative discourses and practices. Subjects are formed through these discourses and practices as they utter them and bring their utopia—a counter-society based on nonviolence, democratic practices, self-critique, and justice—to life by embodying these values.\n\nThis article thus proposes a definition of revolutionary selves, circles, and projects that sharply contrasts with those in the literature with respect to the relation to time so central to revolutionary projects—the idea of sacrificing the present to abolish the past and march toward a better or utopic future. Indeed, the revolution is already happening in the present in a heterotopic space, and there is a collapse between present and future times at the scales of self and society, and in the intimate and public spheres.\n\nThe article simultaneously proposes to break away from the “Eurocentric (not to mention Pauline and thus emblematically Judeo-Christian) idea of the person” (Cherstich et al. 2020: 91) by showing how an unbounded subject emerges from the halaqa. Indeed, it shows, to paraphrase and transpose Mahmood (2001: 203), how a particular notion of human agency, self-formation, and cultivation in the literature on revolution—one that seeks to locate the political and moral autonomy of the subject in the face of power—is brought to bear on the study of revolutionary subjects in a tradition such as Islam. It argues that despite the important insights it has enabled, the model of the revolutionary subject based on an autonomous individual shaped by a secular tradition is called into question by the formation of revolutionary selves within the halaqa.\n\nRevolutionary subjects appear as relational subjects that are cultivated and formed within the circle and by its shape in relation to one another and to the divine. Here, we see how revolutionary subjects and politics are formed through the embodiment of ritualized practices that are collective in nature. As such, the self is not autonomous, and is thought of in continuity with the wider society. This is why changing the self can be understood as changing the society, and why this specific program of self-cultivation has revolutionary potential.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis article is based on fieldwork that was carried out with the support of the ERC project Comparative Anthropologies of Revolutionary Politics (2013-CoG-617970).
