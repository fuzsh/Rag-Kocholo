        "text": "Our dear respected brother Al-Haj Rashid Ahmad American of Milwaukee Majlis passed away on February 7, 2015 at the age of 91, Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji‘un. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih V (may Allah be his helper) led his funeral Prayer in absentia on Friday, February 13, 2015 at Baitul Futuh Mosque, London.\n\nLife of Brother Rashid Ahmad\n\nBrother Rashid Ahmad was born in 1923 in East St. Louis, Illinois. He accepted Ahmadiyyat in 1947 in Chicago. At the time, Imam Bengali was the missionary in Chicago. There were other converts in Chicago as well who had accepted Ahmadiyyat through Hazrat Mufti Muhammad Sadiq (may Allah be pleased with him). One of his earlier friends, Brother Abid Haneef—who himself is a convert to Ahmadiyyat—recalls that Brother Rashid Ahmad was one of the most effective members of the community when it came to Tabligh and was known for his honesty. He was affectionately called \"Mr. Tabligh\" by his companions for his unshakable services to the spread of Islam and Ahmadiyyat.\n\nHazrat Musleh Mau’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) indicated his desire around 1948 for American Ahmadis to come to Rabwah, Pakistan, and dedicate their lives to study for the propagation of Islam. Brother Rashid Ahmad leapt at the opportunity and was fortunate to be selected for the honor. Hazrat Musleh Mau’ud himself welcomed him at the railway station of Rabwah. He stayed at Rabwah for five years and having been trained under the aegis of Hazrat Musleh Mau’ud, he became the first American missionary of the Jama'at. His friend Abid Haneef recalls, “He was our national hero…everyone wanted to be Rashid Ahmad!”\n\nBrother Rashid’s journey to Pakistan was nothing short of a miracle. He was arrested in the Middle East on his way to Pakistan and accused of spying! When he finally reached Pakistan, he had no idea where to go, in a completely foreign country with a different language. Yet he persevered and with Allah’s support had the honor of studying and serving by the side of Hazrat Musleh Mau’ud. During his stay at Rabwah, he was also able to attain good grasp of Urdu and Punjabi languages.\n\nBrother Rashid Ahmad was always actively involved in the Jama’at’s as well as Majlis’ activities throughout his life. He especially attended the National Ijtima’at of Majlis Ansarullah, USA till his very senior years. He was very passionate about Tabligh and served with great zeal. He regularly appeared on the live weekly TV program Islam Live on Milwaukee Public TV for 20 years. To satiate his thirst for Tabligh, he was actively involved with the local Tabligh stall till his last days.\n\nBrother Rashid Ahmad had the blessed opportunity to perform Hajj. He served as missionary in Chicago and St. Louis Jama'ats. He served as president of the Milwaukee Jama'at for a long period of time. He has also served as Amir Jama'at USA. He was the first recipient of the Mufti Muhammad Sadiq Lifetime Achievement Award. The award was presented by Majlis Khuddamul Ahmadiyya, USA at their annual Qa’idin Refresher Course (QRC) in 2007.\n\nSome Memorable Videos\n\nAt various events of Majlis Ansarullah, USA"
