He was sent into exile to Jableh in western Syria with his family after they were convicted of planning and carrying out future rebellions against the French. They also sentenced his eldest son Mohammed to 20 years in prison on the island of Arwad, and executed his son Mahmoud by shooting with several other revolutionaries.[1][2][3][4]\n\nShortly after Al-Haj and his family were sent to Jableh, he was assassinated by the French authorities in a café outside of the city by poisoning his coffee, and prevented the transfer of his body to his hometown in Deir Ez-zor for reasons of public security.

The club was closed during the era of President Hosni Al-Zaim in 1948, although it was owned by Mr. Abdul Qader Al-Ayyash who covered its expenses with his own money.[33][34][35]\n\nIn 1945 he published the Voice of the Euphrates magazine at his own expense, the first monthly cultural magazine in Deir Ezzor, its articles were limited to the definition of the civilization of the Euphrates Valley and the history of its cities and describe its economy and codify and highlight its famous heritage.[36]\n\nHe founded and headed the \"Adiyat\" Society in Deir Ezzor in 1958; He presided over the Supreme Council for the Welfare of Arts, Letters and Social Sciences in the United Arab Republic in 1961, where he continued fighting for the codification of the Euphrates Valley civilization.

The Syrian Ministry of Culture published a dictionary of Syrian authors which was written by Abdul Qader Al-Ayyash in 1982, and the Ministry of Folklore also issued three books were written by him.[38][39][40]\n\nHe died in Deir Ezzor in 1974 after he enriched the Arab Library with more than 117 books in the field of history, folklore and literature, President Hafez al-Assad described him in his condolence message sent to his relative as \"Lost of the homeland\".[41][42][43]\n\nThe epic battle of Ain Albu Gomaa\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were contacts between the leaders of the Great Syrian Revolution and some patriots of Syrian East area as Mohammed Al-Ayyash, who met in Damascus with Dr. Abdul Rahman Shahbandar, leader of the People's Party, and discussed with him the issue of extending the revolution to the Euphrates region and opened a front against the French to disperse their forces and ease the pressure on the rebels of Ghouta and Jabal al-Arab, after the returning of Mohammed Al-Ayyash from Damascus he started to raise the enthusiasm of the people of Deir Ezzor and invited them to fight, he agreed with his brother Mahmoud to go to the villages of the Albu Saraya clan who resided on the West of Deir ez-Zor and had a strong friendship with his father Ayyash Al-Haj, to form a revolutionary group with them to strike the French forces.[44][45][46]\n\nMohammed Al-Ayyash managed to form a revolutionary group of thirteen armed men who were ready to take any military action against the French forces, they were:[47]\n\nMahmoud Al-Ayyash\n\nHakami Al-Abed Al-Salameh (Al-Shumaitiya Village).\n\nAziz Al-Ali Al-Salamah (Al-Shumaitiya Village).\n\nHaji Ali Al-Abed Al-Salama (Al-Shumaitiya Village).\n\nHassan Al-Abed Al-Salamah (Al-Shumaitiya Village).\n\nHamza Al-Abed Al-Salama (Al-Shumaitiya Village).\n\nAslibi Masoud Al-Abdul Jalil (Al-Shumaitiya Village).\n\nKhaleef Al-Hassan Al-Muhammad (Al-Kuraitia Village).\n\nLions of Hamdan (Al-Kuraitia Village).\n\nAhmed Al-Hassan (Al-Kuraitia Village).\n\nHameed Al-Sultan (Al-Kuraitia Village).\n\nAbdullah Al-Khalaf Ibrahim (Deir Ezzor city).\n\nHamad Bin Rdaini – Al-Baggara tribe.\n\nSome people worked with the French at translation centers and other fields. Still, they were at the service of the revolutionaries, they were bringing news to Mohammed Al-Ayyash about the situation and movements of the French and their activities and the timing of their military operations and Mohammed Al-Ayyash guided the revolutionaries to strike the French forces.\n\nIn early June 1925, the translators informed Mohammed Bey ِAl-Ayyash that a military vehicle carrying four French officers who had come from France to inspect the French military construction departments in Syria and Lebanon, accompanied by their French driver, would leave Deir Ezzor on its way to Aleppo. He instructed his brother Mahmoud to set up an ambush in the area of Ain Albu Gomaa on the road to Deir Ezzor Al-Raqqa, where the highway runs through a profound valley and has a narrow stone bridge.[48]\n\nWhen the military vehicle arrived, the revolutionaries attacked and arrested the officers and took them with their car to a desert called \"Al-Aksiyya,\" and threw them with their driver in one of the abandoned wells where they died.[49]\n\nThe French were mad for losing contact with their officers and began an extensive campaign including planes to search for them, and when they found their bodies and inquired about the names of the revolutionaries, they sent a sizeable military force equipped with Heavy guns and planes to attack Albu Saraya clan and blockade it.\n\nFrench planes began bombing the villages of the clan, it was a horrific and devastating bombardment where the houses were destroyed with children and women and killed the livestock and burned their farms and crops, Some civilians were killed and many were wounded by bullets and shrapnel from plane bombs, All of this was to pressure the people to surrender the revolutionaries.\n\nWhen the French were convinced that the bombing did not work, they resorted to despicable means where they threatened to arrest the women of the revolutionaries, their mothers and sisters until the revolutionaries surrendered themselves to the French, when the news arrived at the revolutionaries, they emerged from their hideouts and surrendered themselves to avoid arresting their women.[51]\n\nRevolutionaries were tried in Aleppo, where the family of Ayyash Al-Haj appointed lawyer Fathallah Al-Saqqal to defend them, the court heard (Officer Bono) head of the French intelligence in Deir Ezzor, who said: If each of the criminals, who committed this terrible offense deserve dying once, the gang leader Mohammed Al-Ayyash deserves hanging twice.[52]\n\nThe French High Commissioner in Beirut, Maurice Sarrail, issued Decision No. 49S / 5 in August 1925, which ordered the exile of all members of the Ayyash Al-Haj family to the city of Jableh, Mahmoud Al-Ayyash and 12 of his companions were sentenced to death. The execution was carried out by firing squad on 15 September 1925 in Aleppo. Muhammad Al-Ayyash was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment on the island of Arwad in Tartous city.[53]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nShortly after Ayyash al-Haj family's living in Jableh, The French authorities assassinated Ayyash Al-Haj in a café outside the city by poisoning his coffee and prevented the transfer of his body to Deir Ezzor city for reasons of public security, He was buried in Jableh in the cemetery of sultan Ibrahim ibn Adham mosque, the absent prayers held for the spirit of this martyr mujahid in all the Syrian cities, He was lamented by many poets of Deir Ezzor, as the great poet Mohammed Al-Furati.[54][55][56]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]"
