        "text": "Marksmen of the Secret Department are the With Fire & Sword version of Manhunters.\n\nYou cannot attack groups of Marksmen of the Secret Department. If tried, they will ask you if you have seen any bandits. You can only say yes or no. If you manage to recruit them by rescuing a prisoner from an enemy party, they cost 3 to 4 thalers a week. One can typically find small parties of Marksmen of the Secret Department roaming the lands of the Muscovite Tsardom, especially around Moscow or Tver'.\n\nThe hero Fedot claims to have killed a clerk of the Secret Department after the latter formed a strong attraction to the former's wife.\n\nAlthough their name implies they are marksmen troops, it is possible for them to be mounted, not wielding guns at all, or both.\n\nDirect upgrades to the Marksmens' capture-only function can be done by customizing Cossack Mercenary Cavalry and Muscovite Mercenary Cavalry to be equipped only with blunt weapons, though the Muscovite ones have an advantage in heavier armor options and the ability to use a shield.\n\nStats and equipment[]\n\nNote: Troops have a set of default stats; at the beginning of a new game, these stats are randomly adjusted for each type of troop. The following is the default set for this troop as seen within the game code and may not reflect the specific stats you will see during actual gameplay. For more information, see Troop stats."
