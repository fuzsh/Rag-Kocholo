        "text": "Archaeology is the study of the human past using material remains. These remains can be any objects that people created, modified, or used.\n\nPortable remains are usually called artifacts. Artifacts include tools, clothing, and decorations. Non-portable remains, such as pyramids or post-holes, are called features.\n\nArchaeologists use artifacts and features to learn how people lived in specific times and places. They want to know what these peopleâs daily lives were like, how they were governed, how they interacted with each other, and what they believed and valued.\n\nSometimes, artifacts and features provide the only clues about an ancient community or civilization. Prehistoric civilizations did not leave behind written records, so we cannot read about them.\n\nUnderstanding why ancient cultures built the giant stone circles at Stonehenge, England, for instance, remains a challenge 5,000 years after the first monoliths were erected. Archaeologists studying Stonehenge do not have ancient manuscripts to tell them how cultures used the feature. They rely on the enormous stones themselvesâhow they are arranged and the way the site developed over time.\n\nMost cultures with writing systems leave written records that archaeologists consult and study. Some of the most valuable written records are everyday items, such as shopping lists and tax forms. Latin, the language of ancient Rome, helps archaeologists understand artifacts and features discovered in parts of the Roman Empire. The use of Latin shows how far the empireâs influence extended, and the records themselves can tell archaeologists what foods were available in an area, how much they cost, and what buildings belonged to families or businesses.\n\nMany ancient civilizations had complex writing systems that archaeologists and linguists are still working to decipher. The written system of the Mayan language, for instance, remained a mystery to scholars until the 20th century. The Maya were one of the most powerful pre-Columbian civilizations in North America, and their Central American temples and manuscripts are inscribed with a collection of squared glyphs, or symbols. A series of circles and lines represents numbers.\n\nBy deciphering the Mayan script, archaeologists were able to trace the ancestry of Mayan kings and chart the development of their calendar and agricultural seasons. Understanding the basics of the Mayan writing system helps archaeologists discover how Mayan culture functionedâhow they were governed, how they traded with some neighbors and went to war with others, what they ate, and what gods they worshipped.\n\nAs archaeologists become more fluent in Mayan writing, they are making new discoveries about the culture every day. Today, some archaeologists work with linguists and poets to preserve the once-lost Mayan language.\n\nHistory of Archaeology\n\nThe word âarchaeologyâ comes from the Greek word âarkhaios,â which means âancient.â Although some archaeologists study living cultures, most archaeologists concern themselves with the distant past.\n\nPeople have dug up monuments and collected artifacts for thousands of years. Often, these people were not scholars, but looters and grave robbers looking to make money or build up their personal collections.\n\nFor instance, grave robbers have been plundering the magnificent tombs of Egypt since the time the Pyramids were built. Grave robbing was such a common crime in ancient Egypt that many tombs have hidden chambers where the family of the deceased would place treasures.\n\nIn Egypt in the mid-1800s, an Egyptian man searching for a lost goat stumbled across the tomb of Pharaoh Ramses I. (Many archaeologists doubt this story and say grave robbers, working as an organized group, routinely scouted and plundered many tombs in the area.) Ramses I ruled for a short time in the 1290s BCE. Besides the body of the pharaoh, the tomb held artifacts such as pottery, paintings, and sculpture. The man sold the mummies and artifacts from the tomb to anyone who would pay.\n\nThe mummy of Ramses I wound up in a museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, where it remained until the museum closed in 1999. The Canadian museum sold the Egyptian collection to the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, which confirmed the mummyâs royal status through the use of CT scanners, X-rays, radiocarbon dating, computer imaging, and other techniques. Ramses I was returned to Egypt in 2003.\n\nOne of the most well-known archaeological finds is the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, also known as King Tut. Unlike many other Egyptian tombs, grave robbers had never discovered King Tut. His resting place lay undisturbed for thousands of years, until it was discovered in 1922. In addition to mummies of Tutankhamun and his family, the tomb contained some 5,000 artifacts.\n\nMany early archaeologists worked in the service of invading armies. When Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte of France successfully invaded Egypt in 1798, he brought artists, archaeologists, and historians to document the conquest. Napoleonâs troops took home hundreds of tons of Egyptian artifacts: columns, coffins, stone tablets, monumental statues. Today, these Egyptian antiquities take up entire floors of the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.\n\nSome archaeologists of this time were wealthy adventurers, explorers, and merchants. Often, they were from Western European colonial powers from places different from where they excavated. These amateur archaeologists often had a sincere interest in the culture and artifacts they studied. However, their work is also tied to colonialism and cultural exploitation. They profited off cultures that was not their own, and took sacred objects and remains away from their historical and traditional sites.The so-called Elgin Marbles are an example of this controversy.\n\nIn 1801, Greece had been taken over by the Ottoman Empire. The British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Lord Elgin, received permission to remove half of the sculptures from the famous Acropolis of Athens, Greece. These marble sculptures were a part of buildings such as the Parthenon. Lord Elgin claimed he wanted to protect the valuable sculptures from damage caused by conflict between the Greeks and the Ottomans.\n\nThe government of Greece has been lobbying for the return of the Elgin Marbles ever since. Most Greeks view the sculptures as part of their cultural heritage. Greece has cut off diplomatic relations to the United Kingdom several times, demanding the return of the sculptures, which remain in the British Museum in London.\n\nEventually, archaeology evolved into a more systematic discipline. Scientists started using standard weights and measures and other formalized methods for recording and removing artifacts. They required detailed drawings and drafts of the entire dig site, as well as individual pieces. Archaeologists began to work with classicists, historians, and linguists to develop a unified picture of the past.\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeologists began to re-assess their impact on the cultures and environments where they dig. Today, in most countries, archaeological remains become the property of the country where they were found, regardless of who finds them. Egypt, for example, is scattered with archaeological sites sponsored by American universities. These teams must obtain permission from the Egyptian government to dig at the sites, and all artifacts become the property of Egypt.\n\nDisciplines of Archaeology\n\nArchaeology is based on the scientific method. Archaeologists ask questions and develop hypotheses. They use evidence to choose a dig site, then use scientific sampling techniques to select where on the site to dig. They observe, record, categorize, and interpret what they find. Then they share their results with other scientists and the public.\n\nUnderwater archaeologists study materials at the bottom of lakes, rivers, and oceans. Underwater archaeology encompasses any prehistoric and historic periods, and almost all sub-disciplines as archaeology. Artifacts and features are simply submerged.\n\nArtifacts studied by underwater archaeologists could be the remains of a shipwreck. In 1985, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Dr. Robert Ballard helped locate the wreck of RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912, killing about 1,500 people. Ballard and other scientists used sonar to locate the wreck, which had been lost since the ocean liner sank. By exploring Titanic using remote-controlled cameras, Ballard and his crew discovered facts about the shipwreck (such as the fact the ship broke in two large pieces as it sank) as well as hundreds of artifacts, such as furniture, lighting fixtures, and childrenâs toys.\n\nUnderwater archaeology includes more than just shipwrecks, however. Sites include hunt camps on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico, and portions of the ancient city of Alexandria, Egypt, submerged due to earthquakes and sea level rise.\n\nThis basic framework carries across many different disciplines, or areas of study, within archaeology.\n\nPrehistoric and Historic Archaeology\n\nThere are two major disciplines of archaeology : prehistoric archaeology and historic archaeology . Within these groups are subdisciplines, based on the time period studied, the civilization studied, or the types of artifacts and features studied.\n\nPre historic archaeology deals with civilizations that did not develop writing. Artifacts from these societies may provide the only clues we have about their lives. Archaeologists studying the Clovis people, for instance, have only arrowheadsâcalled projectile pointsâ and stone tools as artifacts . The unique projectile points were first discovered in Clovis, New Mexico, in the United States, and the culture was named after the town. So-called Clovis points establish the Clovis people as one of the first inhabitants of North America. Archaeologists have dated Clovis points to about 13,000 years ago.\n\nA sub discipline of pre historic archaeology is paleopathology. Paleopathology is the study of disease in ancient cultures. ( Paleopathology is also a sub discipline of historical archaeology .) Paleopathologists may investigate the presence of specific diseases , what areas lacked certain diseases , and how different communities reacted to disease . By studying the history of a disease , paleopathologists may contribute to an understanding of the way modern diseases progress. Paleopathologists can also find clues about peopleâs overall health. By studying the teeth of ancient people, for example, paleopathologists can deduce what kinds of food they ate, how often they ate, and what nutrients the foods contained.\n\nHistoric archaeology incorporates written records into archaeological research. One of the most famous examples of historic archaeology is the discovery and decipherment of the Rosetta Stone. The Rosetta Stone is a large slab of marble discovered near Rashid, Egypt, by French archaeologists in 1799. It became an important tool of historic archaeology .\n\nThe stone is inscribed with a decree made on behalf of Pharaoh Ptolemy V. The decree was written and carved into the stone in three different languages: hiero glyphic , demotic, and Greek. Hieroglyphics are the picture-symbols used for formal documents in ancient Egypt. Demotic is the in formal script of ancient Egypt. Before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone , Egyptologists did not understand hiero glyphics or demotic . They could, however, understand Greek. Using the Greek portion of the Rosetta Stone , archaeologists and linguists were able to translate the text and decipher hiero glyphs . This knowledge has contributed vastly to our understanding of Egyptian history.\n\nHistoric archaeology contributes to many disciplines , including religious studies. The Dead Sea Scrolls, for instance, are a collection of about 900 documents. The tightly rolled parchment and other writing sheets were found between 1947 and 1956 in 11 caves near Qumran, West Bank, near the Dead Sea. Among the scrolls are texts from the Hebrew Bible, written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest versions of Biblical texts ever found, dating from between the third century BCE to the first century CE. The scrolls also contain texts, psalms, and prophecies that are not part of todayâs Bible. Discovery of the scrolls has increased our knowledge of the development of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nA sub discipline of historic archaeology is industrial archaeology. Industrial archaeologists study materials that were created or used after the Industrial Revolution of the 1700s and 1800s. The In dustrial Revolution was strongest in Western Europe and North America, so most in dustrial archaeologists study artifacts found there.\n\nOne of the most important sites for in dustrial archaeologists is the Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire, England. The River Severn runs through the gorge , and during the In dustrial Revolution , it allowed for the transport of raw materials such as coal, limestone, and iron . In fact, the worldâs first iron bridge spans the Severn there. By studying artifacts and features (such as the iron bridge), in dustrial archaeologists are able to trace the areaâs economic development as it moved from agriculture to manufacturing and trade .\n\nOther Disciplines\n\nEthnoarchaeologists study how people use and organize objects today. They use this knowledge to understand how people used tools in the past. Archaeologists researching the ancient San culture of southern Africa, for instance, study the way modern San culture functions. Until the mid-20th century, the San , maintained a somewhat nomadic lifestyle based on hunting and gathering. Although the San culture had evolved significantly, archaeologists studying the tools of the modern San could still study the way ancient San tracked and hunted animals and gathered native plants.\n\nEnvironmental archaeologists help us understand the env ironmental conditions that influenced people in the past. Sometimes, env ironmental archaeology is called human paleoecology. Env ironmental archaeologists discovered that the expansion of the Taquara/ItararÃ© people of the Brazilian highlands is closely linked with the expansion of the evergreen forest there. The forest grew as the climate became wetter. As the forest provided more resources to the Taquara/ItararÃ© people (timber, as well as plants and animals that depended on the evergreen trees), they were able to expand their territory.\n\nExperimental archaeologists replicate the techniques and processes people used to create or use objects in the past. Often, re-creating an ancient workshop or home helps experimental archaeologists understand the process or method used by ancient people to create features or artifacts . One of the most famous examples of experimental archaeology is the Kon-Tiki, a large raft built by Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947, Heyerdahl sailed the Kon-Tiki from South America to Polynesia to show that ancient mariners, with the same tools and technology, could have navigated the vast Pacific Ocean.\n\nForensic archaeologists sometimes work with geneticists to support or question DNA evidence. More often, they excavate the remains of victims of murder or genocide in areas of conflict . Forensic archaeology is important to the understanding of the âKilling Fieldsâ of Cambodia, for instance. The Killing Fields are the sites of mass graves of thou sands of victims of the Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge , forensic archaeologists studied the remains of the bodies in the Killing Fields , discovering how and when they died. The forensic archaeologists helped establish that the Khmer Rouge used starvation and overwork, as well as direct killing, to silence opponents of the regime .\n\nArchaeologists working in the field of cultural resource management help assess and preserve remains on sites where construction is scheduled to occur. Archaeologists working as cultural resource managers often col laborate with local governments to balance the infrastructure and commercial needs of a community with historic and cultural interests represented by artifacts and features found on construction sites.\n\nWhere to Dig?\n\nMost archaeology involves digging. Winds and floods carry sand , dust and soil, depositing them on top of abandoned features and artifacts . These deposits build up over time, burying the remains. Sometimes catastrophes, like volcanic eruptions, speed up this burial process. In places where earth has been carved awayâlike in the Grand Canyon in the U.S. state of Arizonaâyou can actually see the layers of soil that have built up over the centuries, like layers of a cake.\n\nCities and communities also tend to be built in layers. Rome, Italy, has been an urban center for thou sands of years. The streets of downtown Rome today are several meters higher than they were during the time of Julius Caesar. Centuries of Romans have built it upâmedieval home on top of ancient home, modern home on top of medieval home.\n\nEstablishing a dig site in an inhabited area can be a very difficult process. Not only are the inhabitants of the area inconvenienced, archaeologists donât know what they may find. Archaeologists looking for an ancient Roman fortress, for instance, may have to first excavate a Renaissance bakery and medieval hospital.\n\nBecause most artifacts lie underground, scientists have developed methods to help them figure out where they should dig. Sometimes they choose sites based on old myths and stories about where people lived or where events occurred. The ancient city of Troy, written about by Greek poet Homer as early as 1190 BCE, was thought to be a work of fiction. Homer âs epic poem the Iliad was named after Troy, which the Greeks knew as Ilion. Using the Iliad as a guide, German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered the ruins of the city near the town of Hisarlik, Turkey, in 1870. Schliemannâs find helped provide evidence that the Trojan War may have actually taken place, and that ancient manu scripts may be based on fact.\n\nSometimes, archaeologists use historical maps to find ancient artifacts . In 1973, for instance, archaeologists used historical maps and modern technology to locate the wreck of the USS Monitor, an âironcladâ ship used by the Union during the Civil War. The Monitor sunk in a storm off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in 1862. After archaeologists identified the ironclad , the United States designated the area as the nationâs first marine sanctuary.\n\nBefore securing a site, an archaeological team surveys the area, looking for signs of remains. These might include artifacts on the ground or unusual mounds in the earth. New technology has greatly increased their ability to survey an area. For example, aerial and satellite imagery can show patterns that might not be visible from the ground.\n\nOther technologies give clues about what lies under the surface. These techniques involve radar and sonar . Radar and sonar technologies often use radio waves, electrical currents, and lasers. Archaeologists send these signals into the earth. As the signals hit something solid, they bounce back up to the surface. Scientists study the time and paths the signals take to familiarize themselves with the underground landscape.\n\nAccidental finds can also lead archaeologists to dig sites. For instance, farmers plowing their fields might come across sherds of pottery . A construction crew might discover ruins beneath a building site."
