        "text": "If you’re a fan of historical drama—the genre that delivers fact and fiction, romance and betrayal, and power and intrigue and secrets galore—you’ll love these historical dramas to stream when you watch with PBS Passport, an added member benefit, right now! Note: Full episode streaming is only available within the United States.\n\n1.\n\nThe Miniaturist | Three Episodes\n\nPeriod: Set in the lush and black-drenched city of Amsterdam in 1686—think of Rembrandt’s The Night Watch—The Miniaturist brings the world of Dutch Golden Age to life with its opulence, repressed sensuality, and ambition.\n\nDrama: Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen’s Gambit, The Witch) plays 18-year-old Nella Oortman, who arrives in Amsterdam to meet her wealthy merchant husband only to be plunged into his mysterious household of secrets and lies, where a miniature replica of their prosperous house augers eerie coincidences and ever-increasing danger.\n\nWatch All Three Episodes of The Miniaturist Now.\n\n2.\n\nLes Misérables | Six Episodes\n\nPeriod: Love, death, and the struggle for social justice in early 19th-century France feature in this beautifully faithful retelling of one of the world’s most beloved stories, Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables.\n\nDrama: Twisted fates, a cat-and-mouse game, tragedy, and—above all else—love, feature in this epic six-part drama. Dominic West stars as fugitive Jean Valjean, with David Oyelowo as his pursuer Inspector Javert and Lily Collins as the luckless single mother Fantine. The distinguished British cast also includes Academy Award winner Olivia Colman (The Crown, The Favourite, Broadchurch) as Madame Thénardier, Ellie Bamber (Nocturnal Animals, Pride And Prejudice And Zombies) as Cosette, and Josh O’Connor (Emma, The Crown , The Durrells in Corfu) as Marius.\n\nWatch All Six Episodes of Les Misérables Now.\n\n3.\n\nThe Long Song | Three Episodes\n\nPeriod: In a story of endurance, passion and hope, The Long Song is told through the eyes of July, an enslaved woman and a spirited survivor. Exploring the last days of slavery in British-ruled Jamaica, The Long Song brings to life what is considered the largest rebellion of enslaved people in the British Caribbean, the “Christmas Rebellion” of 1831.\n\nDrama: The story unfolds at the Amity sugar plantation, where the strong-willed July (Tamara Lawrance, King Charles III, On Chesil Beach) is working as a lady’s maid for Caroline Mortimer (Hayley Atwell, Howard’s End, The Duchess, Captain America: The First Avenger). When Robert Goodwin, a new overseer at Amity arrives, both July and Caroline are intrigued by his revolutionary spirit and intent to improve the working conditions on the plantation. But the winds of change across the hot plantation fields end up fanning severe consequences.\n\nWatch All Three Episode of The Long Song Now.\n\n4.\n\nVictoria | Three Seasons\n\nPeriod: In 1837, a diminutive, neglected teenager is crowned Queen Victoria, navigates the scandal, corruption, and political intrigues of the court, and soon rises to become the most powerful woman in the world.\n\nDrama: Victoria dramatizes the romance and reign of the passionate young monarch finding her voice, her power, and the love of her life as a woman, a wife, a mother, and the ruler of an empire. Jenna Coleman (Doctor Who) as Victoria, Rufus Sewell (The Man in the High Castle) as Lord Melbourne, and Tom Hughes (Dancing on the Edge) as Prince Albert star.\n\nWatch Seasons 1-3 of Victoria Now.\n\n5.\n\nWorld on Fire | Two Seasons\n\nPeriod: World on Fire follows the lives of ordinary people coping with the most monumental war in human history, tracing the interweaved fates of several families in 1939 and 1940, from the Nazi invasion of Poland, to the near debacle at Dunkirk, to the fall of Paris and beyond.\n\nDrama: Love, death, heroism, and forgiveness bind together the characters from England, France, Germany, Poland, and America as their stories weave in and out of each other’s, and as the world changes around them.
