        "text": "The Secret Fire or \"Flame of Anor\" (probably aliases of the ancient Flame Imperishable) refers to a mysterious heavenly power in Eä and Arda.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Secret Fire seems to refer to Eru Ilúvatar's Power of Creation. This power was with Ilúvatar alone from the very beginning, so when Melkor sought for it, his efforts were in vain. Later, Ilúvatar set it (or an aspect of it) at the Heart of Arda.[1]\n\n\"Therefore Ilúvatar gave to their vision Being, and set it amid the Void, and the Secret Fire was sent to burn at the heart of the World; and it was called Eä.\"\n\n—The Silmarillion, \"Valaquenta\"\n\nThe Secret Fire was also described as being part of all Fëa, the soul of a living being or the spirit: it was that Gift which makes sentient beings capable of independent thought and will.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf the Grey referred to both the Secret Fire and the Flame of Anor at the Bridge of Khazad-dum when confronting the Balrog:[2]\n\n\"'You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. \"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.\"\n\n—The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, Book II, Chapter V: \"The Bridge of Khazad-dûm\"\n\nAnor was a name for the Sun in the mythology, as well as a name for the True West (i.e. Valinor). Further, some have speculated that Gandalf said \"flame of Anor\" in reference to the fact that he wielded one of the Three Rings of Power, Narya. Thus, it is uncertain if the flame of Anor was identical to the Secret Fire, but both it and The Secret Fire identified Gandalf as a servant of the Valar.\n\nSee also[]\n\nFëa and hröa\n\nTranslations[]"
