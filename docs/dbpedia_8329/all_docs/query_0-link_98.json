        "text": "How long is the hike?\n\nThe King's Trail (Kungsleden) is Sweden's most famous hiking trail. The entire route takes about a month to cover, but because it’s broken into sections, you can choose the length of your hike. The most popular section, which stretches between Abisko and Nikkaluokta, is about 105 kilometres long and will take absout 7 days, although if children are in your party it may take longer. This is where you’ll find stunning scenery and views of Sweden’s highest mountains.\n\nWhere to start hiking the King's Trail\n\nIf you hike the most popular and northernmost section, Abisko to Nikkaluokta, you start at the STF Abisko Turiststation and head south. You’ll pass through Abisko National Park, along with vast open areas, plenty of lakes and streams, and some of the highest mountains in Sweden, which will still be capped in snow even during the warm summer months.\n\nLevel of difficulty of the King's Trail\n\nDespite being located above the Arctic Circle, the King’s Trail is suitable for quite a wide range of hikers. The relatively low altitudes and reasonably level terrain, coupled with well-maintained hiking trails, make the route suitable for most people – even children – although plan a slower pace if you bring younger kids. If you use the mountain huts, you can lighten your pack quite a bit, making the hike that much easier.\n\nWhere to stay when hiking the King's Trail\n\nThe Swedish Tourist Association (STF) has about 16 mountain cabins dotted along the trail, providing a mattress, pillow, blanket, simple cooking facilities, and food for purchase. The cabins are about 10-20 kilometres apart, perfect for each day’s hiking. While there are no STF huts between Kvikkjokk and Ammarnäs, other quite rustic cabins are available.\n\nWhat to pack for hiking Sweden's King's Trail\n\nYou’ll surely encounter rain while hiking the King’s Trail, so a sturdy pair of waterproof hiking boots, a jacket and trousers are first on your list. Add walking poles to help traverse muddy sections and small streams, a waterproof tent, a sleeping mat, and a warm sleeping bag (the nights are generally cold.)\n\nWhen it comes to food, you can buy food at the many STF huts that dot the trail, but prices are higher than in the supermarkets, so pack as much dry food as you can carry. If you plan on cooking, bring a portable stove and a pan. Two water flasks (in case one break), painkillers in case you get ill, and bug-repellent: mosquitoes are notorious in northern Sweden.\n\nMost importantly, bring some disposable shopping bags to leave the landscape as pristine as you found it."
