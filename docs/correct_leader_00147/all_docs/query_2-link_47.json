        "text": "Ministry of Industry and Trade presents achievements of the Czech EU Presidency in the areas of competitiveness, energy, telecommunications and external relations (international trade).\n\nCOMPETITIVENESS (INTERNAL MARKET AND INDUSTRY)\n\nThe Informal Competitiveness Council\n\nThe most significant informal session took place on May 5, 2009 in the Congress Center in Prague. The Informal Meeting of Ministers for Competitiveness focused on the economic impacts of the EU enlargement, on the programme of cutting red tape for businesses and on the future of the internal market. The Czech Presidency chaired the meeting. Günter Verheugen, Vice—President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, Mario Monti, President of Bocconi University and Former EU Commissioner for Competition, and Jan Mühlfeit, Chairman Europe, Microsoft Corporation, made their presentations to the Member States ministers.\n\nThe Competitiveness Council (March)\n\nThe EU Competitiveness Council (March 5, 2009) highlighted the impacts of the economic crisis in the EU. The Council adopted three documents: the Conclusions on the automotive industry, the Council conclusions on the Commission´s Single Market Review Progress Report and the Key Issues Paper 2009 — contribution from the Competitiveness Council to the Spring European Council. These documents were adopted by the European Council March 19 — 20, 2009 in Brussels.\n\nThe Czech EU Presidency prepared the Conclusions on automotive industry as a reaction on the gravity of the current economic crisis and its impacts on the industry as a whole.\n\nThe Council Conclusions on the Commission’s Single Market Review set political directions, which the European Commission should reflect in its next steps in managing the internal market. The Conclusions also demonstrate the relevance of Single Market Policy in the current economic situation and outline a series of measures that have already been taken or are being prepared, in order to create conditions for European economic recovery.\n\nThe Key Issues Paper 2009, which is the Competitiveness Council’s contribution to the spring meeting of the European Council underlined that rapid and determined actions are needed in particular in the following five priorities: removing barriers and achieving a fully operational and modern internal market, reducing administrative burdens, improving framework conditions for industry with special focus on SMEs and innovation, stepping up and improving the quality of investment into knowledge, education and research, and a focus on the external dimension of competitiveness.\n\nThe Council also took note of the progress report on the state of play of the Better Regulation agenda. The Report took into account the Commission´s Third Strategic Review on Better Regulation and concentrated on the three main pillars of Better Regulation.\n\nThe Competitiveness Council (May)\n\nThe policy debate on industrial policy in the context of the current economic downturn was high on the agenda at the Competitiveness Council (May 28, 2009). Council adopted the conclusions on Industrial Policy. The Conclusions consist of two sections — horizontal and sectoral. The horizontal part underlines that maintaining a competitive and strong industrial base in Europe requires favorable, stable and predictable framework conditions that foster excellence, innovation and sustainability, so that businesses can operate, prosper and invest.\n\nThe Council not only agreed on horizontal measures targeting all industrial sectors, but also on conclusions on specific industries(chemicals industry, electric and electronic industry and automotive industry)that concluded work on these sectoral initiatives by various high level groups.\n\nThe Council held a policy debate on Small Business Act (SBA) for Europe initiative and concentrated on the specific measures of the SBA Action plan aimed at overcoming the economic crisis by helping small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the three priority areas: improving SMEs access to finance, a regulatory environment support of SMEs needs and enhancing the market access for SMEs. The Council took note of the Presidency progress report on the ongoing process for the creation of a European private company statute.\n\nThe Council also adopted the Conclusions on Better Regulation. The ministers held a discussion on ways to further promotion of the Better Regulation Strategy within the EU.\n\nMoreover, the Council took note of a Presidency report on ongoing negotiations aimed at establishing the Community Patent and the unified patent litigation system. The Czech Presidency continued examining the draft regulation on the Community patent and the draft of the Agreement creating a unified patent litigation system. In this regard, the Council agreed in principle to request the ECJ for an opinion on whether the envisaged Agreement, to be concluded between the Community, its Member States and other contracting parties to the European Patent Convention, is a compatible to the EC Treaty.\n\nFurthermore, the Council took note of information on the \"Google Project (scanning of books in US libraries to establish a database from digital copies)\" and its possible legal implications in terms of copyright.\n\nThe 1st Week of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)\n\nThe Czech EU Presidency underlined the significant role of small and medium enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy by. It supported the 1st SMEs week (taking place from May 6 to 14. 2009), which was coordinated by the European Commission within a campaign to promote entrepreneurship across Europe and to inform entrepreneurs about the support available to them at European, national and local level.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade organized a Closing Conference of 1st SMEs week entitled: \"Small Business Act for Europe: entrepreneurship without barriers\", and the European Enterprise Awards 2009 Ceremony. This international conference was focused on local and regional solutions to the key challenges facing SMEs, as identified in the Small Business Act for Europe.\n\nThe Conference on Future Services in the Internal Market\n\nThe Czech EU Presidency supports correct and coherent transposition of the services directive. Timely implementation of the services directive is crucial mainly for the small and medium enterprises, which could profit from the open market with services, thanks to the directive. On February 2, 2009 the Conference on Future of Services in the Internal Market represented an excellent opportunity to discuss the future role and the added value of the Services Directive for the Internal Market. Conference Conclusions articulate willingness of Member States to continue working together towards a fully functioning Internal Market of Services. This includes improvements ensuring e—technologies and simplifying the cross—border trade.\n\nThe most important legislative acts settled during the Czech Presidency in the area of competitiveness:\n\nProposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on machinery for pesticide application, amending Directive 2006/42/EC of 17 May 2006 on machinery (COM(2008)0535 — C6—0307/2008 — 2008/0172(COD))\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL repealing Council Directives 71/317/EEC, 71/347/EEC, 71/349/EEC, 74/148/EEC, 75/33/EEC, 76/765/EEC, 76/766/EEC, and 86/217/EEC regarding metrology\n\nProposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products (recast) (COM(2008)0049 — C6—0053/2008 — 2008/0035(COD))\n\nProposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning type—approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles (COM(2008)0316 — C6—0210/2008 — 2008/0100(COD))\n\nReview of a Regulation setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual use items\n\nENERGY\n\nGas Crisis\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, the Czech Presidency had to deal with the gas crisis, which was caused by interruption of gas supplies from Russia via Ukraine to the EU. On the 1st of January 2009, Russia suspended the gas supplies to Ukraine due to Ukraine´s deficient payments. On the 7th of January 2009, Moscow ceased supplies of gas to European countries with the explanation that Kiev drained gas from the pipelines.\n\nMartin Říman, the minister of Industry and Trade, was actively involved in the negotiations as a chairman of the EU Council in the energy sector. Mr Říman's involvement contributed to the resumption of gas supplies to Europe (cutting off supplies to the EU has caused a great economic harm and suffering to 20 European countries).\n\nOn January 12, 2009 , the Czech Presidency convoked an Extraordinary Energy Council meeting to discuss the crisis of gas supplies from Russia to Ukraine. Minister M. Říman chaired the Council. At this meeting, the ministers of the EU Member States appreciated efforts and steps undertaken by the Czech EU Presidency in order to solve the Russia — Ukraine gas conflict and to help to resume the gas supplies to the EU.\n\nIn the conclusions of the EU Council, Member States agreed that it is necessary to strengthen the energy security both on the national and European level.\n\nThe intense negotiations of the Czech Presidency were led with the representatives of Russian Gazprom, Ukrainian Naftogaz and with the highest representatives of Russia and Ukraine. On the 17th of January 2009, a summit on resumption of gas supplies took place in Moscow. After this event, prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement on immediate and full restoration of gas supplies to Europe. On the 20th of January 2009, Russia renewed gas supplies.\n\nEnergy Councils\n\nThe Energy Council, which was presided by Minister Martin Říman on February 19, 2009 in Brussels, focused on the provisions concerning EU’s energy security.\n\nEnergy security was one of the Czech Presidency Priorities. The Council approved the 2nd Strategic Energy review bearing the title ” An EU Energy Security and Solidarity Action Plan\". This 2nd Strategic Review defines the priorities for enhancing energy security, development of energy infrastructure and diversification of supplies, consolidation of external energy relations, oils and gas stocks, energy efficiency and making the best use of the EU´s own energy resources. The European Council in March has adopted the Conclusions of the Energy Council, particularly the 2nd Strategic Energy Review. These conclusions present the foundation for elaboration of a new EU Energy Action Plan for 2013 — 2020.\n\nAfterwards, the ministers discussed legislative proposals in the field of oil reserves and natural gas supplies. Ministers of the Member States of the EU also had a discussion on the selection criteria for energy projects. These projects will receive 3.98 billion EUR as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan.\n\nAt the last Energy Council in Luxembourg during the Czech presidency, the ministers reached a political agreement on new rules requiring Member States to maintain minimum stocks of oil and petroleum products. The proposed directive aimed to improve functioning of the current EU oil stocks mechanisms, in order to ensure availability of oil in the event of crisis. The directive sets an obligation for all member states to hold stocks for at least 30 days or a third of their stockholding in the form of refined petroleum products, so that they can be released quickly in time of crisis. The directive is also intended to align intra EU rules with International Energy Agency. In a public deliberation, the Council took note of a progress report summarizing the work done so far on the energy efficiency package, which contains the following three proposals: an energy labelling directive, a tyres labelling directive and an energy performance of buildings directive. The Council also took note of information provided by the Presidency and the Commission on events linked to development in international relations that took place during the Czech Presidency (the fourth EU — Russia Partnership Council, relations with Ukraine, the issue of supply of Russian gas via Ukraine, the Southern Corridor countries summit, the Energy Community and the EU — OPEC energy dialogue). During lunch, the ministers had an opportunity to discuss the location of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators.\n\nThe third European energy liberalization package\n\nThe finalization of the integrated and fully liberalized Energy Internal market, which contributes to the higher energy security in Europe, is the main precondition of the common European Energy policy. The Czech Presidency managed to negotiate the third European energy liberalization package with the European Parliament. This balanced document contributes to higher integration; liberalization and regional cooperation at the energy market and strengthens the power, duties and independence of national regulators. The Parliament endorsed a compromise on this package on 22nd April 2009. The final agreement among the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission includes five documents:\n\nProposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/54/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity (COM(2007)528),\n\nProposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/55/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas (COM(2007)529),\n\nProposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (COM(2007)530),\n\nProposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending and completing the existing Regulation 1228/03 on conditions for access to the network for cross—border exchanges in electricity (COM(2007)531),\n\nProposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending and completing the existing Regulation 1775/05 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks (COM(2007)532).\n\nEco—design Directive\n\nThe Czech Presidency negotiated a compromise on Eco—design Directive, which determines the minimal requirements for construction of energy related products. These requirements should guarantee environment—friendliness of the products during the whole life cycle. The Directive also has a positive impact on electricity consumption and represents one of the steps to energy efficiency enhancement.\n\nEnergy External Relations\n\nIn February 2009, minister Martin Říman participated in the mission of the Czech Prime Minister and the President of the European Council Mirek Topolánek to Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. One of the themes of the negotiations was the so called ”Southern Corridor\", a planned energy supply route from the Caspian region, through Turkey and into Europe, which will transport gas from Central Asia to Europe. In March 2009, the European Council has invited the Commission to present proposals for concrete action on the development of the Southern corridor including a mechanism to facilitate access to Caspian gas, by the end of this year.\n\nFollowing the negotiations, the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union organized the \"Southern Corridor Summit”, on May 8, 2009.\n\nWithin the framework of external energy relations, the fourth meeting of the Council of EU—Russia Permanent Partnership took place on April 30, 2009 in Moscow. This meeting supported a deal to monitor a gas flow from Russia to EU via Ukraine.\n\nEuropean nuclear energy forum (ENEF — May 29, 2009)\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade organized the fourth meeting of ENEF, under the patronage of the Czech Prime Minister. It represented a platform for discussion about the risks and opportunities related to use of nuclear energy. About 350 delegates attended this forum including the Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico and the Commissioner Vladimír Špidla. At the meeting, Vladimír Tošovský, Czech Minister of Industry and Trade, and Lubomir Jahnátek, Slovakian Minister of economy, signed the Memorandum of understanding and cooperation in the field of building a new nuclear block in the locality of Jaslovské Bohunice. by. Both the Czech and the Slovakian side made a commitment to mutually share experience and knowhow in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nTELECOMMUNICATION\n\nMinisterial conference on e—communication\n\nWithin the framework of telecommunications the Czech Presidency organized the ministerial conference \"Next steps in EU Telecoms” on February 17, 2009 in Prague. This conference was linked to a discussion on the regulatory framework and its appropriate instruments, which might be seen as incentives for investments into the digital infrastructure. The telecommunication as a sector with an annual turnover of 300 mld. EUR and creating about 4 % of all job places, represents a key sector for the competitiveness of the EU.\n\nThe agreement on roaming price regulation on the EU Internal market and the GSM Directive\n\nThe Czech Presidency negotiated the agreement on roaming price regulation on the EU Internal market as well as the GSM Directive. The adoption of the revised Regulation on roaming in public mobile networks will limit the prices of calls made or received and of data services. The European Parliament approved the revised Regulation on roaming on April 22, 2009. As a result, European consumers are expected to save up to 60 per cent on their bills for using their mobiles abroad in the EU.\n\nRegulation No 717/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC (COM(2008)0580)\n\nThe approved GSM Directive removes redundant legislation and enables development of the most modern information and communication technologies. In Europe, the 900—MHz spectrum was reserved just for GSM services but the revised GSM Directive allows using the universal mobile telecommunication technology (UMTS), which is both cost effective and gives users a wider transmission capacity.\n\nProposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive No 87/372/EHS on the frequency bands to be reserved for the coordinated introduction of public pan—European cellular digital land—based mobile communications in the Community\n\nTelecommunications package\n\nIn April 2009, the Czech Presidency reached a compromise on telecommunications package, at the meeting of Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER), which brings an ultimate revolution of the whole telecommunications sector. Unfortunately, the MEPs, influenced by the pre—election campaign, did not abide by the agreement with the Commission and the Council and they did not approve all the parts of the telecommunications package at the plenary session on May 6, 2009. The European Parliament approved the so—called amendment 138 or 46, which is inconsistent with the reached compromise.\n\nThe Telecommunication Council informally discussed the state of negotiation of the telecommunication package on June 11, 2009. The Council confirmed the readiness to solve this problem and to cooperate with newly elected MEPs in a conciliation procedure. Today, the Council can only run informal discussions, as the EP has not officially informed the Member States about its position within the second reading up to now.\n\nTelecommunication Council — June 11, 2009\n\nIn June, the Telecommunication Council dealt with the enhancement of network and information security and discussed the future of the agency ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency).\n\nHigh—level seminar on e—communication\n\nHigh—level Seminar on e—Communications: \"Future Europe: Modern Communications for Everyone\" took place on April 15 — 16, 2009 and was dedicated to the discussion about the telecommunications package.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\nThe launch of negotiations for an agreement with Canada\n\nA significant success of the Czech Presidency is the launch of negotiations for the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Canada, which was approved by the ministers of EU and by the Commission in the GAERC (General Affairs and External Relation Council). The negotiation for the agreement was launched at the EU—Canada Summit on May 6, 2009 in Prague and should be concluded by 2011. In case of successful conclusion of the agreement, the EU can expect a profit of about 11,5 mld. EUR.\n\nInformal meeting of trade ministers in Brussels\n\nAt the beginning of the year ( January 25, 2009), the Czech Presidency organized an informal meeting of trade ministers of the EU—27 in Brussels. Trade liberalization and fighting the economic crisis were the main issues discussed during the dinner.\n\nConference on trade liberalization\n\nThe conference on trade liberalization took place on February 3, 2009. Its conclusions confirmed that the EU refuses protectionism and supports markets to remain open. From participants’ point of view, the core factors of the EU competitiveness are transparent and predictable trade policy and the ability to innovate.\n\nConference \"Trade policy and SMEs — on the road to recovery”\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade, the agency CzechTrade and the University of Economics, Prague organized the conference \"Trade policy and SMEs — on the road to recovery” on May 5, 2009. The trade commissioner Catherine Ashton was the guest of honor at the conference. It was a part of series of related events took place during the European SME week (May 5 to 14, 2009).\n\nEU — South Korea relations\n\nThe fourth summit EU—Korea was held on May 23, 2009 in Soul. Very important issues of this informal summit were mainly the climate change and enhancement of the cooperation between EU and South Korea. The strengthening of the cooperation in the field of competition policy (the Agreement on cooperation in the field of competitions policy was signed), the commitment to conclude the negotiations towards a Free Trade Agreement and Framework agreement for trade and cooperation were the outstanding successes of the summit.\n\nTrade defense instruments (TDIs)\n\nDuring the Presidency, the Czech Republic focused on the transparent investigation of the trade defense instruments (TDIs). This initiative was launched in February 2009 and was positively accepted not only by the domestic industry and trade representatives but also by the Member states. Today, the Czech Presidency and the European Commission closely cooperate on particular proposals to improve the transparency where one of the main aims is to make this mechanism accessible to SMEs, and to be able to fight against unfair business practices.\n\nAccess to raw materials\n\nThe Commission prepared a non—paper, \"Access to raw materials — progress report”, indicating an overview of the strategy of access to raw materials including a list of steps needed to be taken. The Member states have supported the Commission’s intention to launch an integrated strategy aimed at ensuring better and undistorted access to raw materials in third countries, better framework conditions for extracting raw materials within the European Union and a lower consumption of primary raw materials by increasing resource efficiency and promoting recycling. The Czech Presidency has approved \"The raw materials initiative” and the aim to launch an integrated strategy in the Competitiveness Council conclusions on sustainable industrial policy.\n\nInformal meetings\n\nDuring the Czech Presidency, the informal meetings of Committee of article 133 — Full members (April) and of Committee of article 133 — services (May) took place as well. The informal meeting of the Working party on export credits was held on May 21 — 22,2009."
