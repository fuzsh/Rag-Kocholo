        "text": "He may have toned down his recent attacks on Brussels because his crusade against environmentalists who warn of climate change has taken up too much time, but the Klaus who has likened the EU to the former Soviet Comecon bloc and warned that the Czech Republic would dissolve within it “like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee” is never far away. On his last foreign trip before the first round of presidential elections, Klaus warned Slovakia about its ambition to become the next country to join the eurozone. And in an uncharacteristically toned-down New Year speech he lashed out at the risks attached to the Schengen zone’s enlargement.\n\nFor those in Brussels who have learnt to hate the smartly dressed premier – and Klaus’s uncompromising, some would say arrogant, personality invites either wholehearted love or hatred – the good news is that he could curb his criticism at least before and during the Czech presidency of the EU during the first half of 2009. The bad news is that with the Czech constitution banning three consecutive terms as head of state, he will have a free hand after the EU presidency, because he will not need to worry about re-election. The constitution deals the president a middleweight role, giving him a leading role for example in negotiating international treaties and allowing him to appoint the national bank board and top judges. But Klaus has another card up his sleeve: his standing within the right-wing party that he founded and of which he is still an honorary chairman, the Civic Democrats.\n\nThe dominant government party, with 81 seats in the 200-seat lower house and a majority of 41 in the 80-seat Senate, falls just short of being able to return Klaus on its own, but he also looks likely to get a large chunk of votes from the small Christian Democrat Party.\n\nIronically, power struggles within the Civic Democrats provide some scenarios for unseating Klaus. In one, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, whom Klaus described as a lightweight short on ideas, might secretly not be that upset if Klaus was voted into early retirement. In another, Klaus’s failure to get re-elected might pave the way for his succession by his main party rival, Pavel Bem, the mayor of Prague. Both versions look like wishful thinking from the hopeless.\n\nThe self-reliant Klaus, undoubtedly the dominant Czech political figure since the fall of communism, has never been keen to let chance play a major role in his future.\n\nThe ex-member of a communist-regime forecasting institution quickly rose to prominence in the hybrid Civic Forum movement despite his lack of dissident credentials. Klaus had held private economic seminars propagating capitalist ideas in the 1980s but, while apparently shadowed by the secret police, was not thrown out of his job or jailed.\n\nFormer president Václav Havel remembers that they were both members of a non-communist literary magazine in the late 1960s, but after not hearing anything more about him for 20 years, thought he had probably emigrated.\n\nAfter losing his post at the Czech Academy of Sciences in the 1968 crackdown following the Prague Spring, Klaus did leave for the US in the spring of 1969 to briefly attend Cornell University and tour the country in a Greyhound bus in what was apparently a major eye-opener for him.\n\nBack home, he returned to take up a run-of-the-mill bank job. It was a post that was to last 17 years until he joined the Prognostics Institute.\n\nBut even during the worst years of the communist ‘normalisation’, Klaus recalls that he could still get his hands on some of his favourite US publications, ‘The Journal of Political Economy’ and ‘The American Economic Review’.\n\nThe Velvet Revolution found him steeped in free market economic theory and with a certain reputation from his secret seminars given to a ragbag of students and dissidents low on non-Marxist economic know-how. Havel described Klaus in those early heady days as sometimes “unbearable”, describing his “negative energy”, “narcissism” and “irony” and, for most of the time well-hidden, aversion to the “left-wing intellectuals” making up the Civic Forum leadership.\n\nNonetheless, the hardworking Klaus, who regards a postprandial nap as “sacrilege”, was chosen as the first post-communist finance minister, though he was nearly dumped from the post a few months later as the Civic Forum tried to balance out its portfolios between Czechs and Slovaks.\n\nKlaus quickly established himself as the father of the economic reforms and a polished political performer, which he credits in part to his communication skills. “In the post-November 1989 politics, I was perhaps the only one who could appear on a one-hour television debate without stage fright,” he said in one interview. Klaus often got his way and got on, sometimes by wearing down opponents and sometimes, according to Havel, by pushing “to the very limits of what was ethically acceptable”.\n\nHis creation of the Civic Democrat Party, modelled on Thatcher’s Conservative Party, to fight the 1992 elections, gave him a solid power-base as the party-political fight he championed took over. The separation of Czechoslovakia, which he helped push through, increased his prospects for power in the new slimmed-down country.\n\nKlaus’s crusade against Brussels and a European superstate came slowly. In his early years as prime minister at the beginning of the 1990s he preferred to boast, quite inaccurately as it turned out, of how quickly the country would join the EU. But political analysts trace his transformation into outright critic of the EU to his period in opposition after 1998.\n\nDespite the flawless reputation that his acolytes have fostered, Klaus has suffered setbacks with his own personality playing a primary role. A revolt by smaller parties and top members of his own party in 1997 sparked by a party financial scandal was also fuelled by his manner of running the government and his habit of belittling fellow ministers.\n\nThe 2002 general elections, which Klaus appeared throughout the campaign to be destined to win, was largely lost because he overruled close advisers and agreed to appear in two television debates against his rival, current European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, helping boost Špidla’s status.\n\nThe coupon privatisation and other reforms which Klaus claims credit for put the country on the road to being a market economy but at the cost of many collapsed companies.\n\nAttacked as part of a spent generation of politicians by his rival for the presidency, Klaus, who still possesses the stamina to dance around the tennis court, looks like he has plenty of staying power.\n\nThe CV\n\n1941: Born in Prague"
