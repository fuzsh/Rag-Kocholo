        "text": "Vladimir Spidla narrowly survived a vote of confidence within his party\n\nCzech Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla has officially resigned after his party's performance in the European elections.\n\nMr Spidla offered his resignation to President Vaclav Klaus, who will lead talks on forming a new government.\n\nMr Spidla announced last weekend he would stand down after he lost support within his Social Democrat Party.\n\nHis successor as party leader, former interior minister Stanislav Gross, met Mr Klaus on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting, Mr Gross, a former train technician, told reporters he wanted to build a government which would last until the 2006 elections and would not rely on Communist support.\n\nHe said he would continue seeking a parliamentary majority for such a cabinet.\n\nMr Klaus has asked Mr Spidla and his outgoing coalition government, which also includes the centrist Christian Democrats and the right-wing Freedom Union, to lead the government until a new one can be formed.\n\nHe also thanked Mr Spidla for his work and efforts \"in a difficult position of the head of a fragile coalition government.\"\n\nVote\n\nMr Spidla actually survived a vote of confidence within his party, by a narrow margin.\n\nMore than 100 of his opponents voted against him, but they failed by six votes to gain the three-fifths majority needed to remove him.\n\nHowever, the result was poor enough to force him to go.\n\nThe confidence vote was called after a disastrous showing by the party in the European elections earlier in June apparently after alienating many traditional left-wing voters with a series of unpopular public finance reforms.\n\nThe Social Democrats won only two of the 24 seats at stake.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the president must now nominate a candidate for prime minister, who must then win a vote of confidence.\n\nMr Gross, 34, has a reputation of being a skilful negotiator who favours a minority left-wing government with the support of one or more opposition parties.\n\nMr Klaus has said he would not appoint any government that would have to rely on the Communists for support.\n\nHe has also said that if he failed to get agreement on a new government, he could call an early election."
