        "text": "Former Czech prime minister Vladimír Špidla will head a Czech-German working group with the task of bridging a growing divide between the Czech Republic and Germany over the EU’s continuing migrant crisis, the daily Lidové noviny reports. According to the daily, German diplomacy expressly asked for the nomination of the 64-year-old politician in the hopes he might blunt anti-immigration rhetoric by some Czech government members. Mr Špidla was prime minister in 2002-2004 and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities from 2004 to 2010. Although the Czech Republic and Germany enjoy strong economic ties, relations between the two countries are said to have suffered over differences on migrant quotas, which the Czech Republic opposes."
