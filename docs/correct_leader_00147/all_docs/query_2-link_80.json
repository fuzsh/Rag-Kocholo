Presence of the Council of Europe’s experts in the Office of the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for ensuring Human Rights and Civil Rights and Freedoms in the Chechen Republic\n\nOn 3 July 2003 Ambassador Orlov handed over a letter dated 30 June 2003 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Mr Igor Ivanov, concerning the prolongation until 4 January 2004 of the Agreement on the mandate of Council of Europe staff providing consultative expertise on human rights in Chechnya. A copy of the letter is attached as Appendix I.\n\nFollowing this prolongation I have appointed Mr Rikard Barkeling (Sweden), Ms Estelle Steiner (France) and Mr Martin Zeman (Czech Republic) as Council of Europe staff members to provide consultative expertise on human rights in Chechnya for the period 4 July 2003‑4 January 2004.\n\nThey will work in the Chechen Republic subject to security conditions, which at present do not allow for a permanent international presence there. According to the latest information from Mr Sultygov, the Special Representative of the Russian President for Human Rights in Chechnya, sufficient protection against terrorist acts is not available.\n\nMr Sultygov has also sent a preliminary draft proposal of additional tasks for consideration. These could be implemented during the absence of our staff from Chechnya. This draft includes proposals to continue the training in human rights for law enforcement agencies and for students from the Grozny State University, as well as the setting-up of a human rights library open to the public. Assistance in promoting local and self-government should also continue.\n\nPriority should be given to the training in Good Practice in the conducting of electoral campaigns for the electoral teams of candidates for the post of the President of the Chechen Republic. The presidential elections in Chechnya will be held on 5 October 2003. The training, if it is to be efficient, should be held in Nazran, Ingushetia, not later than the end of August / beginning of September 2003.\n\nTogether with the Parliamentary Assembly and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe, we shall also look into the conditions for appropriate observation of the presidential election. This, of course, presupposes receiving an invitation from the Russian authorities. I hope the ongoing visit to Moscow of the newly appointed Assembly’s rapporteur on Chechnya, Mr Andreas Gross, will bring more information on this issue.\n\nImplementation of the additional tasks as well as preparation for possible observation of the presidential elections will also be regularly discussed with other partner institutions, as well as with the OSCE, tomorrow in Strasbourg on the occasion of the annual meeting of the high officials.\n\nIn view of the successful start and good perspectives for the implementation of the additional tasks, we shall continue, in spite of the current difficult security situation, to explore all possibilities to follow up the applications registered by the Office of the Special Representative concerning alleged violations of human rights. The Joint Working Group of the Office of the Special Representative and the organs of the Prosecution, acting on the basis of a new agreement signed last spring, should be one of the platforms to be used for mutual action in this respect, even without the presence of our staff in Chechnya.\n\nFinally, I regret to add that I have not received any information or any new facts concerning the investigation of the bomb explosion in Grozny on 21 April 2003 involving the Council of Europe staff.\n\n2. Meeting with the Cypriot party leaders, 7 July 2003\n\nFurther to my official visit to Cyprus last January and my participation on that occasion in one of the round tables of political parties from both Cypriot communities in the Ledra Palace, I invited the political party leaders to Strasbourg as a token of their willingness to settle the Cyprus issue within Europe.\n\nThis initiative was realised with the visit to Strasbourg on 7 July 2003 of the representatives of 18 political parties from both Cypriot communities.\n\nThe programme started with the symbolic ceremony of the planting of a Cyprus Reconciliation Tree in the Parc de l’Orangerie in the presence of the Mayor of Strasbourg, Madame Fabienne Keller. Afterwards I met the party leaders for an exchange of views which lasted nearly three hours. In the afternoon they also met the Secretary General of the Parliamentary Assembly.\n\nFurthermore, the lunch and the informal dinner provided ample opportunities for personal contacts and very open and frank discussions in a most cordial atmosphere.\n\nMy clear line was that this meeting of all the Cypriot political leaders should not interfere with the ongoing efforts of internationally-supported negotiations, in particular in the context of the Annan-Plan. I hoped however that by inviting the political leaders to leave the negotiating environment of the island and to immerse themselves in the European reality, the Council of Europe’s mission to promote unity amongst its members would give a positive impetus to the settlement process.\n\nThe visit to Strasbourg was not part of a negotiation process. However, the open discussions allowed the singling out of some common areas of agreement. I summarised them at the Press Conference for which the party leaders appointed me as their common spokesman:\n\n· There is only a European option for the solution of the Cyprus issue. We are all working for a non-divided Europe; a divided Cyprus would therefore be an anachronism.\n\n· The political equality of the two communities is the basis for the future. This corresponds to basic Council of Europe principles of membership on an equal footing, no matter what the size of the country.\n\nThe two communities need each other for the preservation of the island (politically, economically and culturally).\n\nSince the opening of the gates between the North and the South, the people have clearly expressed their wish for the future. Politicians have to meet the expectations of the people.\n\nThere actually exists different views on the basis for a solution. The Annan-Plan is on the table, and even if all parties do not accept it in its totality, this should not prevent the start of negotiations. There is also not only one key to the solution. Even if the two Cypriot communities are mainly responsible for their common and peaceful future within Europe, the international community and the guarantee powers can make a useful contribution.\n\nFor the time being, the confidence-building measures subsequent to the opening of the gates should be further promoted and enlarged. There are still many political, psychological, practical and bureaucratic, as well as economic problems to be overcome.\n\nThe Council of Europe can continue to contribute to such measures, in particular with regard to the crucial issue of presenting and teaching history, the responsibility of the media (code of conduct) in favouring a common and peaceful future, as well as the promotion of the role of civil society as the expression of the aspirations of the people from both parts of the island.\n\nSeveral participants expressed the wish that this experience be repeated. In conclusion, I can only quote the spokesman of the political leaders at the dinner toast: “more such invitations to Strasbourg and we will succeed in our aim for a common homeland in Cyprus”.\n\nAt the end of July I shall attend a meeting of regional organisations in New York convened by the Secretary General of the UN, Mr Kofi Annan, when I will discuss further the Council of Europe’s involvement.\n\nThe list of the Delegations of Cypriot Parties is attached as Appendix II.\n\n3. Use of “Reserve for field missions” for action concerning the fight against the trafficking in human beings in Montenegro\n\nLast week we informed you about our contacts with the authorities in Montenegro and with the OSCE on the issue of trafficking in human beings. I have now been in contact with the Secretary General of the OSCE. A jointly signed letter has been sent to the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro accepting the Montenegrin authorities’ invitation to both organisations to look into the case of human trafficking in Montenegro involving a Moldovan citizen. This letter is attached as Appendix III.\n\nThus, two joint CoE/OSCE visits to Montenegro by a team of independent experts will take place shortly. They will look into a case of trafficking involving a Moldovan citizen, the aim of these visits being to make recommendations for future action in the fight against trafficking in human beings. A second visit to Podgorica is planned tentatively, should the first one prove to be insufficient.\n\nThe estimated cost of these activities is € 26 400 and I propose to finance them by using existing resources under the provision for fields missions/programmes.\n\n4. Opening of the Museum of Natural History, Dornbirn, Austria, 20 June 2003\n\nOn 20 June 2003 I opened the Museum of Natural History “Inatura” of Dornbirn. It is one of the most modern museums of its kind and I was impressed by the quality of the concept and the means deployed to effectively communicate science and nature. In my address, I referred notably to the work developed by the Council of Europe in the field of biodiversity.\n\n5. Europa-Forum “Die Zukunft der Europäischen Union : Neue Chancen durch innere Reform und Erweiterung”, Wachau, Austria, 28 June 2003\n\nOn 28 June 2003 I attended the Europa-Forum Wachau at the Göttweig Monastery near Krems. The Forum, the title of which was “The future of the EU: new chances through internal reform and enlargement” was hosted by the Federal Chancellor of Austria, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, and the Governor of Lower Austria, Mr Erwin Pröll. It was chaired by the Austrian Foreign Minister, Ms Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Chancellor Schüssel gave the closing address.\n\nI chaired a workshop entitled “A Europe of common values – where are its geographical borders?” My introductory remarks appear as Appendix IV.\n\nThe Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Dr Vladimir Špidla, also participated in the Forum, as did the Croatian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Tonino Picula, the MEP and Chairman of the EU Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Elmar Brok, and many others.\n\nFinally, a word on the history of the Forum. The Europa-Forum Wachau was created by the former Austrian Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Alois Mock, in 1995. This 5th Forum was held, as were all the preceding ones, at the historic Göttweig Monastery. The guiding principles of the Europa-Forum Wachau have been and remain to unite leading representatives from central, eastern and south-eastern Europe for fruitful dialogue and discussions.\n\n6. Crans Montana Forum – meeting of Central European Heads of State and Government on the subject “Towards an active and modern Democracy”, Crans Montana, Switzerland, 29 June 2003\n\nOn 29 June 2003 I participated in the Crans Montana Forum. I chaired a central European meeting on the theme “Towards an active and modern democracy”. This meeting was attended by the Heads of State and the Heads and members of Government of a number of central European countries, as well as the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro and the President of Kosovo and other personalities. The discussion focused on the democratic reforms in these countries and regional co-operation.\n\nI was also invited to address a plenary session of the Forum on “The Challenges of democracy in the 21st Century World”. My address is attached as Appendix V.\n\nIn the margins of the event I had a meeting with Mr Georges Grinda, Plenipotentiary Minister for European Affairs of Monaco on issues related to the procedure of accession of the Principality to the Council of Europe.\n\n7. Official visit to San Marino, 3-4 July 2003\n\nOn 3-4 July I paid an official visit to San Marino where I discussed current political issues as well as co-operation between San Marino and the Council of Europe.\n\nI held meetings with the Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs, Mr Fiorenzo Stolfi, and a government delegation at the Palazzo Begni. I also met the Captains Regent Pier Marino Menicucci and Giovanni Giannoni, as well as members of the Congress of State, at the Palazzo Pubblico, where I was awarded the Knighthood of Grand Cross of the Equestrian Order of St Agatha. I made a formal address to the Great and General Council, the text of which is attached as Appendix VI. This was followed by a meeting with members of the press.\n\nI also had the opportunity to meet representatives of all political forces in the Great and General Council as well as members of the delegation of San Marino to the Parliamentary Assembly.\n\nI should like to thank the authorities of San Marino and Ambassador Ceccoli most warmly for their hospitality and for the excellent organisation of my visit.\n\n8. Appointments to Council of Europe Field Offices\n\na. Belgrade Office\n\nAfter having been my Special Representative in Belgrade for one year, Mrs Verena Taylor, has rejoined the Secretariat in Strasbourg.\n\nMrs Taylor fulfilled her task with great professional skill and efficiency during this decisive period preceding Serbia and Montenegro’s accession to the Council of Europe, as well as during the launching of the post-accession programme at the beginning of April. I would like to thank her for this important contribution to one of our most challenging field activities.\n\nI have asked Mr Jorgen Grunnet to assume the function of my Special Representative in Belgrade as from 1 September 2003. As you know, Mr Grunnet is currently the Special Representative in Chisinau and prior to this he was my Special representative in Tirana. He has a profound knowledge of the region of South-East Europe.\n\nI am most grateful to the Danish authorities for accepting the continuation of Mr Grunnet’s secondment to his new position in Belgrade.\n\nb. Chisinau Office\n\nTo follow Mr Grunnet as my Special Representative in Chisinau, I have the pleasure to inform you that I have appointed Ambassador Vladimir Philipov. I am most grateful to the Bulgarian authorities for having seconded Ambassador Philipov to this post.\n\nAmbassador Philipov, a senior Bulgarian diplomat who also served as the Foreign Affairs Secretary to the President of the Republic, is at present the Bulgarian National Co-ordinator for the Stability Pact in South-East Europe. You will find his CV attached as Appendix VII. Ambassador Philipov will take up his duties in Chisinau on 1 September 2003. At the end of this month he will travel to Chisinau for contact meetings, together with Mr Grunnet, with the Moldovan authorities and all other relevant partners for the Council of Europe activities in the country. On this occasion, he will also participate in a meeting of the Round Table.\n\nc. Podgorica Office\n\nAs from 1 September 2003 I have appointed Mr Vlado Ristovski as Head of the Office in Podgorica. Mr Ristovski has been for more than four years Director of the Council of Europe Information Offices in Skopje and has been closely associated with the Council of Europe co-operation programmes and CBM activities in the region.\n\n9. Placement of national officials at the disposal of the Council of Europe and secondments\n\na. Directorate General of Legal Affairs (DG I)\n\nFurther to my announcement at your 840th meeting, I am pleased to announce the placement of Mr José Maria Fernandez Villalobos, a Spanish national, at the disposal of the Private Law Department. Mr Fernandez Villalobos is currently Head of the External and International Relations Department of the General Council of the Judiciary in Barcelona.\n\nb. Directorate General of Education, Culture and Heritage, Youth and Sport (DG IV)\n\nThe Directorate General of Education, Culture and Heritage, Youth and Sport (DG IV) is looking for the placement of two national officials in the Directorate of School, Out-of-School and Higher Education and the Cultural Heritage Division.\n\nA job description for each post is attached to this communication at Appendix VIII. I should be grateful to have your proposals by 15 September 2003.\n\nc. Directorate General of Human Rights (DG II)\n\nThe “Police and Human Rights – Beyond 2000” programme in the Human Rights Co-operation and Awareness Division of DG II is looking for three placements of police officers.\n\nAll related costs would have to be fully borne by the authorities placing the officials.\n\nThe current programme “Police and Human Rights – Beyond 2000” was launched at the outcome of the first three-year pan-European programme “Police and Human Rights 1997-2000”, which was finalised with a closing conference entitled “Police and Human Rights – Beyond 2002” (Strasbourg, 11-12 December 2000). The new programme was incorporated in the Intergovernmental Programme of Activities for 2001 and subsequent years, following your decision at your 699th meeting (16-24 February 2000).\n\nThe programme has been run since April 2001 by senior police officers seconded by the Swedish Government and the German authorities (Land Hessen). They have since been joined by senior police officers from the United Kingdom and Finland.\n\nSeveral major training projects have been launched and developed to promote knowledge on European human rights standards among the police services.\n\nA crucial ingredient in the development of the Police and Human Rights programme was that it was run and operated by police officers.\n\nIn order to enable the “Police and Human Rights – Beyond 2000” programme to continue with the implementation of the areas of work identified, the following three replacements are required as secondments: 1) a Programme Manager for a period of three years, and 2) two programme advisers for a period of at least 1-2 years.\n\nThe relevant job descriptions are attached as Appendix IX. I would be grateful to have your proposals by 15 September 2003.\n\n10. Staff matters (in camera)\n\nCommunication by the Deputy Secretary General\n\n1.

Juni)\n\nArbeitskreis 1: „Das Europa der gemeinsamen Werte – wo liegen die Grenzen“\n\nVorsitz: Dr Walter Schwimmer, Generalsekretär des Europarates\n\nDer Beitrag der europäischen Nachkriegsinstitutionen zur Schaffung eines auf Werten und Prinzipien begründeten gemeinsamen Europa\n\n1. Der gemeinsame „Wertesockel“ als Garant der Versöhnung der immer engeren Zusammenarbeit und damit der Friedenssicherung\n\n- die visionäre Entscheidung, nach den Nationalismen, Totalitarismen und Kriegen der Vergangenheit, 1949 die Mitgliedschaft im Europarat mit der Verpflichtung auf das „Mantra“ pluralistische Demokratie – Respekt der Menschenrechte – Rechtsstaat zu verbinden → dieser Mut und diese Weitsicht kommt dem heutigen Europa und seiner möglichen geographischen Dimension zugute.\n\n- Es ist und bleibt eine politische Verpflichtung aller demokratischen Kräfte, in ihren unterschiedlichsten institutionellen Ausprägungen, diese politische Botschaft mit aller Deutlichkeit zu vertreten : wir wollen das grösstmöglichste Europa in Frieden und Stabilität, auf der Grundlage der Respektierung der Gleichheit und der Würde aller Menschen, des effektiven Schutzes der Grundrechte und Freiheiten und wirkungsvollen Teilnahmemöglichkeiten am politischen, bürgerlichen und kulturellen Leben.\n\n- Wegweisende Abkommen wie die Europäische Menschenrechtskonvention (1950), die Kulturkonvention (1954) und die Sozialcharta (1961) wurden zum Sockel der europäischen Wertegemeinschaft und durch Dutzende andere Abkommen erweitert → Anti-Folter Konvention, Rahmenabkommen zum Schutze nationaler Minderheiten...\n\n- Die Institutionen der EG und EU haben diesen „Wertesockel“ von Anbeginn übernommen → seit 1993 Bestandteil der Kopenhagen-Kriterien zur Erweiterung; ein Großteil der Europaratsabkommen sind ebenfalls Bestandteil des „acquis communautaire“, den Kandidaten zu übernehmen haben\n\n- Am 16. April 2003, während der Beitrittsfeierlichkeiten in Athen, haben viele Delegierte die entscheidende Rolle des Europarates für die Beitrittsländer nochmals deutlich gemacht. Erst die aktive Mitarbeit im Europarat hat diese Länder in die Lage versetzt, mit Erfolg die Hürden auf dem Weg zum EU Beitritt zu nehmen. Gerade erst letzte Woche, anlässlich eines unserer regulären „Quadripartite“ Treffen, wurde dies erneut vom Vorsitzenden des EU Ministerrates, dem griechischen Aussenminister Papandrou ausdrücklich betont.\n\nEine neue europäische Perspektive nach dem politischen Wandel in Mittel- und Osteuropa (1989/90)\n\n2. Der unaufhaltsame Weg zum „Einen Europa“\n\n- EU-Erweiterung : 15+10+2+1; Perspektive 33 seit Saloniki 21. Juni (+ 5 West Balkan Staaten); Erweiterte Nachbarschaft-Politik\n\n- Gleichzeitig ER-Erweiterung : 45 (mit dem gesamten West-Balkan) und nur 2 Fehlenden (Monako/Belarus)\n\n- Der Vertragsentwurf des Konvents schließt nicht nur eine Grundrechte-Charta ein, er öffnet auch rechtlich und politisch den möglichen EU-Beitritt zur EMRK → in kohärentes Menschenrechtsschutzsystem für 800 Millionen Europäer\n\n→ EU Beitritt zur Kulturkonvention und zur Sozialcharta wäre ein weiterer Schritt in die Richtung der „einen“ europäischen Wertegemeinschaft\n\n- eine mögliche „assoziierte Mitgliedschaft“ der EU im Europarat wäre ein politischer Akt, um zu unterstreichen, dass beide Institutionen den gleichen Prinzipien und Werten verbunden sind und sie auch gemeinsam verteidigen und fördern\n\n- der Artikel I-7, des in Porto Carras vorgestellten Verfassungsentwurfs wird vom Europarat als wesentlicher Schritt in die richtige Richtung gewertet, da somit die politische Weichenstellung für einen Beitritt der Europäischen Union zur EMRK erfolgt ist.\n\n- Auch die Tatsache, dass die Kompetenz des Europarates in den Bereichen Kultur, Erziehung, Sport und Jugend erneut betont wurde, ist eindeutig zu begrüssen und unterstreicht den komplementären Charakter der beiden Institutionen.\n\n3. Bestimmt die Akzeptanz der gemeinsamen Werte die Grenzen Europas?\n\n- 1949 wurden im Rahmen des Europarates die gemeinsamen Werte festgelegt\n\nheute wird im Rahmen des Europarates die Zusammenarbeit zur Festigung dieser Werte praktiziert → von Reykjavik bis nach Wladiwostok, von den Azoren bis nach Baku\n\n- damit ist die Geographie bereits politisch korrigiert worden\n\n- durch die Kontrollmechanismen der EMRK und der Anti-Folter-Konvention hat der Europarat bereits einen supranationalen Raum der Grund- und Freiheitsrechte für 45 geschaffen\n\n- außerdem haben die 45 Europaratsstaaten einen de facto „Todesstrafe freien Raum“ in Europa geschaffen (durch Ratifizierung des 6. Protokolls der EMRK oder Moratorium)\n\n- zusammen mit der EU setzt sich der Europarat auch für den allgemeinen Beitritt zum Internationalen Strafgerichtshof (ICC) und seine Respektierung ein (Quadripartite – Communiqué)\n\n- Im Bereich der Kultur stellt die Kulturkonvention ein Pan-Europäisches Vertragswerk für 47 Staaten (+ Vatikan)\n\n- Auch die EU ermöglicht all denen, die sich auf die gemeinsamen Grundsätze verpflichten, die Mitgliedschaft\n\n- Über den „Barcelona-Prozess“ engagiert sich die EU auch im Mittelmeerraum\n\n- Weiterhin bestehen aus kolonialer Vergangenheit enge kulturelle Bindungen und Beziehungen zwischen EU-Mitgliedern und europäischen Nachbarregionen\n\n4. Die multikulturelle Vielfalt als wesentlicher Baustein/Grundpfeiler des Europa der Zukunft\n\n- Das heutige Europa ist bereits gekennzeichnet\n\ni. durch seine ethnische Vielfalt (keltisch, germanisch, romanisch, slawisch, zentralasiatisch, usw.), sowie\n\nii. durch seine religiöse Vielfalt (kath., ev., und orthodoxer Christen, Moslems, Juden, Agnostiker und Atheisten)\n\n- Das heutige Europa kennt bereits die Realität erheblicher Immigrationsströme aus Nordafrika, Schwarzafrika, Vorderem Orient und Asien\n\n- Der Schock des 11. September 2001 hat Europa die absolute Notwendigkeit eines verstärkten inter-kulturellen und inter-religiösen Dialogs klar gemacht → im Zeichen des besseren gegenseitigen Verstehens, der Solidarität und der Vertrauensbildung\n\n- Ich habe immer wieder in diesem Zusammenhang betont, dass die gegenwärtige Situation kein Zusammenprall der Zivilisationen ist, sondern ein Zusammenprall der Ignoranzen.\n\n→ das Europa der Vielfalt ist eine unumstössliche Tatsache → es erfordert die Verpflichtung auf gemeinsame Werte und Prinzipien →mit der gegenseitigen Einhaltung der Verpflichtungen und der Respektierung der Rechte und Freiheiten des „Anderen“ im Rahmen dieser definierten Wertegemeinschaft\n\n- Religion und Demokratie teilen das Konzept der Anerkennung und des Respekts des „Anderen“.\n\n→ das „Eine Europa“ kann nicht durch Grenzen und Trennungslinien gekennzeichnet sein →es erfordert aber auch von allen „Betroffenen“ die Anerkennung des gemeinsamen kulturellen Erbes, der gemeinsamen Werte, die auf Toleranz und Respekt des „Anderen“ fussen.\n\nAppendix V\n\nThe Challenge of Democracy\n\nin the 21st Century World\n\nA European Perspective\n\nOpening remarks by Walter Schwimmer\n\nSecretary General\n\nAs always, this meeting of the Crans Montana Forum has been an impressive gathering of leaders and, whatever the country, region or thematic covered, many of the sessions have provided a substantial background for this last plenary session.\n\nThey illustrated, I am sure, that, a few years into the twenty-first century, which for many started in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, democracy is an increasingly shared objective, however uncertain or distant in many cases.\n\nDemocracy is at the very core of the process of European integration in the widest sense, namely the creation of a continent of peace and prosperity without dividing lines.\n\nAnd, in the neighbourhood of Europe, where participatory governance has generally been lagging behind in comparison with regions like Latin America or East Asia, it is also becoming a solid reference in the many attempts to modernise states and societies and to give citizens some control on their collective future. While democracy cannot be imposed or parachuted, its power of attraction is irresistible.\n\nIn the tragedies of the last century, Europe has learned that there can be no peace without human rights and democracy.\n\nRecent European history may be seen as the steady transformation of that hard-learned lesson into policies and institutions that show, I think, a major qualitative change in international affairs: ensuring human rights, democracy, the rule of law have become the collective responsibility of all European States.\n\nThis is reflected in the continuous enlargement and strengthening of the Council of Europe, culminating in the accession, two months ago, of Serbia and Montenegro as the 45th member of the Organisation, only weeks after a violent assault on the democratic transition process in that country, with the assassination of late Prime Minister Djindjic. Allow me to pay tribute to his memory and to commend the courage of those who, after him, working together with Prime Minister Zivkovic, are pursuing with resolve the European drive with all the connected exigencies: fighting crime and corruption, cooperating with The Hague Tribunal, implementing the constitutional agreement, etc.\n\nThe collective responsibility towards democracy is exercised through common institutions for political dialogue, monitoring and mutual assistance. I would like to mention in particular, in addition to the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, its Parliamentary Assembly and its Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe. There is no “reserved domain” anymore, when it comes to the defence of fundamental values on our continent. Peer (friendly) pressure is everywhere, as is exchange of experiences and best practices. And 800 million citizens have right of access to the European Court of Human Rights, should breaches of their basics rights and freedoms not have been redressed by national courts and authorities.\n\nRespect for democracy is also the key condition for access to the European Union. The famous Copenhagen criteria for accession which were applied to the 10 countries, which will soon bring EU membership to 25, are in substance those applicable for Council of Europe membership plus economic requirements. The commonality of goals and values is remarkable. And it is rewarding in that context, that the Convention, created to prepare the future constitution of Europe, underlined this commonality by introducing in the draft treaty, a provision (Article I-7) which stipulates that “the European Union shall seek accession to the European Convention on Human Rights”.\n\nTaking place as it does after the tragedies linked to the retreat from democracy in the 1930s – continuing in Central and Eastern Europe after 1945 and until very recently - this European democratic journey has an undeniable power of attraction outside Europe.\n\nHardly a week passes without senior delegations from all over the world visiting us to discuss the power of collective responsibility in securing democracy.\n\nAs Europeans, we are particularly happy to share experiences with our immediate neighbours of the Southern shore of the Mediterranean. Following the terrible shock of September 11, our relationships with countries of that region, and with organisations like the Organisation of the Arab League or the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, have expanded. We have strengthened our dialogue, and in particular intercultural and interreligious dialogue. Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are an integral part of it.\n\nAs I said at the outset, it is clear that the idea of representative democracy has been gaining ground worldwide since the collapse of communism. However, numerous threats to democracy still exist.\n\nIntroducing a free market system without adequate social policies will lead to social exclusion or poverty. Economic and social well-being are central to democracy. There is a strong correlation between a market-oriented economy and a political democracy, but it is not a binding or direct correlation. One of the main threats to this correlation is corruption. Corruption undermines every aspect of democracy – the confidence of citizens for their leaders, the functioning of elections, economic management and decision-making, and democratic institutions. Corrupt leaders will cling to power to avoid democratic processes, which will hold them accountable.\n\nOther threats are those of racism and intolerance. Intolerance and racism are fundamentally anti-democratic as they are based on the idea that one group in society is superior to another. And since September 11 our societies face the challenges posed by terrorist threats. We must, however, always ensure that democratic principles are not undermined by measures aimed at fighting terrorism.\n\nThe Council of Europe has addressed all these issues through a variety of actions, instruments and co-operation mechanisms.\n\nI will not mention all of them, but would just like to draw your attention to the “Guidelines on human rights and the fight against Terrorism” adopted by our Committee of Ministers in May this year. These guidelines have already gone on record in the UN as “the little brown book”. [Available to participants]\n\nIndeed no guarantee for sustainable democracy exists. We are confronted with daily challenges, such as the growing malfunctioning of democratic institutions, insufficient ownership of fundamental values by public authorities, low participation in elections, rise of extremism, widespread intolerance, etc. I have drawn the attention of our Committee of Ministers to these challenges and, consequently, the tasks ahead of our Organisation, that is to say promoting responsible citizenship and responsive governance at all levels in order to revitalise the democratic institutions, procedures and practices building on the Council’s standards of “quality of democracy”. Such further development and strengthening of a democratic culture would be a key component of sustainable democracy.\n\nWe are sharing the blessings of democracy which is slowly but steadily taking root in all parts of the world, in all civilizations and all cultures. We are all, however, well aware that, like peace and economic development, democracy is not granted us once and for all. Its foundations must be continually reinforced through national efforts and by means of European, and indeed broader international, co-operation.\n\nI look forward to our discussion. I believe the time is ripe for the government’s of all democratic nations, and in particular those that have only just entered on the uphill path of democratic reforms, to reflect together on the condition of democracy in the world; the threats which confront it, and ways of strengthening international pro-democracy co-operation.\n\nLet us commit ourselves to making the 21st century the century of true democracy!\n\nAppendix VI\n\nStatement by Mr Walter SCHWIMMER\n\nSecretary General\n\nThe One Europe at the beginning of the new century\n\nSan Marino (4 July 2003)\n\nExcellencies,\n\nHonourable Capitani Reggenti,\n\nHonourable members of the Grand and General Council,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\n\nApproximately 13 years ago, in April 1990, on the same occasion, one of my predecessors as Secretary General, Mme Catherine Lalumière, spoke before the High Assembly of the Grand and General Council.\n\nSix months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she was visiting San Marino with a view to preparing your country’s presidency of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. Through the Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers from March to November 1990, your country actively participated in the early stages of this restructuring of Europe, which has now led to a continent-wide process of democratisation and to a Council of Europe of 45 member states.\n\nMeeting today in the same place and in the same solemn setting as in 1990 makes this a good opportunity to look briefly back with you at the way Europe has fared in the last decade. We should also try to define the challenges, which are still laying ahead for the Council of Europe, and consequently for the Republic of San Marino.\n\nSumming up these last 13 years of European history from a Council of Europe point of view, I would say that they have been influenced by three main factors:\n\n- The Democratisation process in Europe and the emerging of new European architecture;\n\n- The consequences of the military conflicts on the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1999;\n\n- The consequences of the 11 September 2001 attack and of the war in Iraq;\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAfter 4 years at the Head of the only pan-European organisation, and after many travels from one end of our continent to the other, I dare say – and I have to put it in French to fully express my idea - : “L’Europe sait encore séduire”. Given the age of this lady (which is often pointed out to her) this is a remarkable proof of an exceptional vitality and of an extraordinary capacity to transform and to adapt. No matter where you go in the countries formerly behind the Iron Curtain, Europe represents the hope for the consolidation of a democratic and prosperous future. From the Council of Europe point of view, this power of seduction is proven by the fact that today 800 million Europeans, between Gibraltar and Vladivostok, live in the same legal space based on the principle of the respect for Human Rights, pluralist democracy and the Rule of Law. After the accession of Serbia and Montenegro in April 2003, and the envisaged accession of Monaco to the Council of Europe, only Belarus is missing to complete this single space.\n\nBut the last 13 years have also taught us what a complex task it is to transform the Council of Europe’s principles and standards into a tangible reality for the citizens of all our member states, and in particular the “new” ones. 40, even 70 years of communist rule have bequeathed major problems to Eastern Europe: very young democratic institutions, a non-negligible corruption problem in society and a tendency among some elements of the political classes towards irresponsibility and an authoritarian behaviour. In April 1990 few realised the full weight of that heritage.\n\nThroughout its enlargement process, the Council of Europe has contributed in different ways and – allow me to say with undeniable success – to the democratic stabilisation of our continent, be it in the Balkans, the Caucasus or the Baltic States. It did so through a combination of political dialogue, assistance programmes and monitoring.\n\nIn April 1990 the new European architecture was nothing more than vague features wrapped in mist. Today it has taken on more concrete contours. These are clearly marked by the accession of 10 new members to the European Union, which the Council of Europe to an important degree helped to make possible.\n\nThe European Convention, created by the Laeken Summit, to prepare the future constitution of the European Union, has taken into account the concerns of the Council of Europe to assure the coherence and compatibility between European Union and Council of Europe standards in the field of fundamental rights. This is of essential importance for governments and courts in European Union member states. And it is of paramount importance for individual European citizens. The specific role of the Council of Europe in a number of areas such as culture and education has also been recognised.\n\nThe Council of Europe will continue to play an important role, in particular for the States that will stay outside the European Union, but who wish – and who have the right – to be full and equal partners in the process of European unification based on common values and principles. Europe will always need a forum where representatives of the whole continent, at government, parliamentary or regional level, can meet to discuss and cooperate on an equal footing in addressing continent-wide challenges. The Third Summit of Heads of State and Government of our member states, in late 2004 or early 2005, is expected to provide the necessary vision and guidance on the future role of our Organisation in shaping a one-Europe without dividing lines.\n\nLet me express my conviction, at this juncture, that the Council of Europe will never lose its importance for San Marino, which may be a small state, but which is also the world’s oldest democracy. I would like to invite you to reflect on the unique influence a country like San Marino can have, for instance, on the shaping of the European legal space through its seat at the European Court of Human Rights. San Marino also participates on an equal footing in ministerial and summit decisions on a wide range of key issues.\n\n*\n\n* *\n\nThe war in Yugoslavia was a tragedy. Europe’s behaviour during that crisis has not been very glorious. The only excuse may be that, particularly in Western Europe in April 1990, nobody could believe that such an explosion of ethnic hatred and violence could happen. In the last decade we have at least tried to draw the consequences of our European lack of forward thinking, in order to avoid that such tragedies may be repeated in the future. In this context the Council of Europe has played a central role by adopting a Framework Convention for the protection of national minorities. Since 1996 our Organisation, your Organisation, has also assumed an important role in the field of conflict prevention and resolution. Council of Europe standards in different fields have contributed to resolve or defuse many complicated and tense political situations in the Balkans, Caucasus and Baltic States, simply because they were accepted as common points of reference by the conflict parties. Even if the Chechnya conflict continues to cloud the picture, the Council of Europe and other international organisations are doing their utmost to prevent a future repetition of the Yugoslav scenario. Yet, Yugoslavia has taught us is that stability is not automatically and eternally assured, that the respect of Human Rights cannot be obtained for free, and that all of us who share the same values must always remain vigilant.\n\nIn recent years, reference has often been made to the opposing forces of Good and Evil in the world. In our recent History, 9 November 1989, the date of the fall of the Berlin Wall, will remain a numeric symbol for the good that human beings are capable of, while 11 September 2001, will remind us of the evil Human Beings are also capable of committing.\n\nAfter 11 September, the main challenge for Council of Europe member states has been to find ways of fighting terrorism without endangering the protection of Human Rights.\n\nThe Council of Europe guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism, known as the “little brown book” in New York, have become a global reference.\n\n11 September has also made abundantly clear the need to increase intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. Very often nowadays, Samuel Huntington’s book “The Clash of Civilizations” is quoted, but as I realised, very often by people who did not read it. Time and again, I have repeated my own conviction that the current situation does not reflect a clash of civilizations, but a clash of ignorances. Developing awareness of religious and cultural diversity and promoting dialogue within our European diverse societies are therefore among my very personal concerns. In addition, I strongly believe in greater Council of Europe involvement, through its North-South Centre and contacts with the Arab League and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, in the Mediterranean and Euro-Arab dialogue. In my view, the Republic of San Marino, given its geographic position, its traditions of direct democracy, could play an interesting role in that dialogue.\n\nIn this context I would also like to underline the importance of assuring an effective multilateral system based on the respect of international law for a successful fight against terrorism.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, in its long history San Marino has given some examples how smaller States can make a difference at certain moments of history. Was it not your country that gave asylum to Garibaldi in 1849 thus giving the great man a second chance to achieve the unification of Italy?\n\nSmaller states can also make a considerable difference by joining – or even being - the avant-garde for important political developments on the European level or even higher. San Marino has taken up this role when it adopted its new Constitution in 2002, which explicitly recognises the ECHR and its primacy over domestic law.\n\nIn April 1990 the Council of Europe, under San Marino’s presidency, started the last part of the trail towards a really democratic One Europe. Always when we thought it had come to an end, we finally discovered that the path continued. New situations produce new challenges. Would we have thought in 1990 that the fight against corruption and organised crime, trafficking in Human Beings and money laundering would take on such importance? True to her democratic traditions San Marino has joined the European family to face these new challenges – and I am very grateful for what Minister Stolfi said previously about San Marino co-operation with MONEYVAL.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, in these last 13 years, which I have laid out before you, our optimism for the future of Europe may have been somehow dampened. I would even go so far as to say that today this optimism has been replaced by realism, but realism based on Hope and a strong belief in the Human Being.\n\nAppendix VII\n\nVladimir Philipov\n\nActual Position\n\nNational Coordinator for the Stability Pact\n\nin South-Eastern Europe.
