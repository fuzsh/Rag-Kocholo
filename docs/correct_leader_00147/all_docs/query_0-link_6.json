        "text": "The Government Council for Sustainable Development of the Czech Republic, chaired by the Prime Minister, is an advisory body to the Government responsible for inter-sectoral coordination of the sustainable development policy among central administrative authorities. It consists of the representatives of all ministries, both chambers of the Parliament, municipalities, NGOs, trade unions, academia, industry, agriculture and research. Other relevant stakeholders are represented in its nine thematic Committees and working groups.\n\nIn order to foster partnership and inform all stakeholders about the latest developments in the field of sustainable development, the Office of the Government revived the tradition of the national Sustainable Development Forum, which is held annually since 2014. The Forum in 2015 was one of the first opportunities to discuss the implementation of the SDGs on the national level after their adoption.\n\nBrief history\n\nThe Government Council for Sustainable Development (the \"Council\") was established by Government Resolution No. 778 of July 30, 2003 as a standing advisory, initiative and coordinating body of the Government of the Czech Republic in the domains of sustainable development and strategic management. The first Statute of the Council was adopted by Government Resolution No 836 of August 6, 2003. In 2006 the Council and its secretariat was moved to the Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic. The Council and its horizontal, inter-sectoral importance was fully re-established and the Council was moved back to the Government’s Office (Department of Sustainable Development of the Office of the Government) by Government Resolution No. 434 of June 9, 2014. The Council newly integrated also the agenda of the former National Economic Council. The proposal to re-establish the Council originated from the need to create a body that would deal with the issue of sustainable development on a systematic and long-term basis, serve as an umbrella for the present efforts promoting sustainable development, and efficiently coordinate all related activities. The activities of the Council are specified in the Statute and Rules of Procedure.\n\nThe Statute\n\nThe present Statute was adopted by the Czech Government Resolution No. 622 of July 29, 2015 and sets the responsibilities and tasks of the Council, the Chairman, Council’s members, the Steering Committee, the Committees, the Working groups, Council’s Secretary and the Secretariat and external co-workers.\n\nthe Council meets at least 3 times per year;\n\nthe Prime Minister holds the office of the Chairman of the Council.\n\nMain Responsibilities\n\nDevelopment of the Sustainable Development Strategy and its reviews;\n\nBi-annual reporting on the implementation of the sustainable development strategy in the Czech Republic and monitoring of indicators;\n\nMethodological coordination of conceptual documents.\n\nMembers\n\nChairman\n\nAndrej Babiš\n\nPrime Minister\n\nMembers of the Steering Committee\n\nCouncil's Secretary, members of the Steering Committee and Chairmans of Council's Committees\n\nThe Steering Committee has been set up in November 2015.
