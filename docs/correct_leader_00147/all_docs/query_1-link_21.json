        "text": "Ireland is closely linked with Britain by a long history, and the work relationships are similar. Since 1922, the Republic of Ireland became independent and a member of the EU in 1973. With its 4.2 million inhabitants (as much as Saxony) Ireland takes part in the monetary union in contrast to the UK and has introduced the euro as currency from the beginning. Previously the island was one of the poorest regions of the EU, but could catch up significantly after EU accession. Because of high growth rates and strong decline in unemployment (with 4% today, the third lowest rate in Europe) the country is considered as the â€œCeltic Tiger\".\n\nAbout 70% of all foreign investments come from the U.S., including many high-tech companies and financial service providers engaged in a strongly anti-union strategy. However trade union membership is about 35%, higher than in the United Kingdom (28%). The Irish Congress of Trade Unions ICTU include 81 individual trade unions, which are also found in Northern Ireland. The other way around British trade unions as Unite which arose in May 2007 from the merger of Amicus and T & G also recruit members in the Republic of Ireland. Collective bargaining has been continuously encouraged by the Irish State unlike in the UK in Thatcher years. The two sides are working with the government in tripartite bodies such as the Labour Relations Committee, which can intervene in labour disputes.\n\nLocal works councils introduced by EU legislation in 2006\n\nMany Irish employers oppose the introduction of works councils, which they believe to be a relic from the 60s and 70s. The current pace of industrial change would require a direct communication with employees, and not via the detour of a works council. To meet the requirements of an EU Directive from 2002 which prescribes mandatory in companies from 50 employees information and consultation of the workforce in social and economic issues, the Irish government had to act, however, and to disregard these comments. The Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 introduced works councils for the first time. At the election, however, only union members may participate whose organisation represents at least 10% of the workforce. An election by the entire workforce will take place only when there is no union with a 10% membership.\n\nExplanations to the Irish works council law\n\nFull text of the 2006 act\n\nEuropean works councils in Ireland\n\nAccording to calculations by the European Trade Union Institute only six of 50 companies from the Republic of Ireland had founded an EWC in 2006, including in 1996 the packing group Smurfit and the national airline Aer Lingus. Even Guiness was one of the EWC pioneers, although the Irish traditional brewery (see photo) was bought in 1997 by the worlds' largest spirits manufacturer Diageo from London. Delegates from Ireland are now represented in every third EWC (in 298 of 816).\n\nEWC developments in Ireland 2002 - 2004\n\nFull text of the Irish EWC bill\n\nRyanair in a legal dispute over employee representation\n\nSince there is no tradition of works councils in Ireland as in many other Anglo-Saxon countries, trade union shop stewards play a crucial role in the companies. However they must first be recognized by the employer in a collective agreement (\"recognition agreement\") as a negotiating partner. Despite the high membership rate in Ireland there are companies that deny this including the airline, Ryanair. Since 1998 there were always legal disputes.\n\nA 2004 law gave the unions the right to represent their members also in companies without employee representation, so called \"non union companies\" such as Ryanair. Nevertheless, the management blocked with regard to the â€œEmployee Representation Committee\" (ERC), a replacement employee representation without union connections, founded by Ryanair. On 1st February 2007 the Supreme Court ruled on the collective bargaining competence of the ERC. Indeed the dispute was referred back to the Labour Court due to lack of evidence (from Ryanair staff no one was willing to testify), but the court made it clear that Irish workforce is entitled to an appropriate collective representation. Only in 2006, Ryanair was ordered to pay a fine of 1 million â‚¬, because senior managers had made false statements in court.\n\nReport on the verdict\n\nReview of the verdict from trade union perspective\n\nFull text of the 2004 law\n\nTrade union demands to the Irish legislator\n\nHistoric step for Vodafone UK\n\nThe recognition of a union plays a central role also in the British system. On 11th October 2007 a landmark agreement was concluded for the regional offices of the mobile phone company Vodafone. For the first time ever in company history, management agreed to recognize a union (in this case, the communication workers' union Connect) and to install an employee representation. The new agreement applies only to approximately 500 of the total 11,600 British employees. The remaining staff must continue to work without collective protection.\n\nThe move was not voluntary. Only after intervention of the independent Central Arbitration Committee, management was willing to sign the agreement. In a similar case a London industrial tribunal ordered the newspaper publisher Macmillan in July 2007 to pay a fine (see report in EWC News 2/2007).\n\n\"Union busters\" in the food industry\n\nThe situation is more difficult at the food manufacturer Kettle Chips. In September 2007 the management hired \"union busters\" from the USA (they call themselves more kindly as \"Labour relation consultants\") to stop the legal procedure for the establishment of worker representation. The 340 employees at the Norwich plant should be discouraged from joining the trade union Unite. The conflict arose in the payment of overtime and led to a media campaign and a consumer boycott against the company.\n\nIn the end the consultants from Malibu (California) could nevertheless achieve a success. Much of the workforce - about 40% are immigrants from Eastern Europe - were so intimidated that they voted in a ballot against the union. The British Trades Unions Congress (TUC) has now announced to train trade union officers specifically to hunt the hunters in the future (\"to bust the busters\"). The ruling Labour Party sees in the behaviour of the plant management a breach of UK employment law. A breach of EU standards should also be given.\n\nPress report about Kettle Chips\n\nPress report on the boycott\n\nStatement of the company after the ballot"
