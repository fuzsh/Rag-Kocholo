As member states attempt to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought about new challenges as living costs skyrocket.\n\nNational governments and welfare systems face new pressures and require greater support from the EU. In this context, how can the EU strengthen integration and support national governments in tackling the current and emerging crises?\n\nThe Foundation for European Progressive Studies, Masarykova Demokratická Akademie, and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung organised this year’s Call to Europe Conference in Prague. We brought together current and former progressive policymakers, academic experts, and activists to discuss not only the current state of play for Social Europe but also how European social and economic policy should be shaped moving forward so that all Europeans can have a decent quality of life.\n\nA panel of experts debated how to address the crisis of living costs we currently face. The discussion was followed by a keynote speech from EU Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit.\n\nFEPS member foundations were invited to join a meeting prior to the public conference, during which a discussion on social democracy in central and Eastern Europe took place. This was then followed by a closed-door roundtable on the energy crisis in the afternoon.\n\nDuring the event, László Andor, FEPS Secretary General, presented his latest work ‘Europe’s social integration’. This book examines the four factors that have challenged the fate of welfare states and social standards in Europe: neoliberal globalisation, monetary union, Eastern enlargement and digitalisation.\n\nSpeakers\n\nNicolas Schmit, EU Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights\n\nDaniela Ostrá, Vice-chair of the Czech Social Democratic Party\n\nLászló Andor, Secretary General, FEPS\n\nUrban Überschär, Head of FES Czech Republic and Slovakia Office\n\nKatya Koleva, President, Institute for Social Integration\n\nKarel Polanecký, Friends of the Earth CZ\n\nMatthias Ecke, Member of the European Parliament\n\nCecilia Bruzelius, Junior Professor of European Public Policy, Tübingen University\n\nLubomír Zaorálek, President of Masarykova Demokratická Akademie (MDA)\n\nJosef Středula, Chair of Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (ČMKOS)\n\nDaniel Prokop, Sociologist and researcher at PAQ Research\n\nVladimír Špidla, Former Czech Prime Minister, Former EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities\n\nSaša Uhlová, Journalist, internet daily Alarm\n\nModerated by Lubomír Zaorálek, President of MDA and David Rinaldi, FEPS Director of Studies and Policy\n\nQ&A with the audience moderated by Patrik Eichler, Director, Masaryk Democratic Academy\n\nNetwork\n\nFriedrich-Ebert-Stiftung\n\nMasarykova Demokraticka Akademie (MDA)\n\nFind all related publications\n\nPublications\n\nBuilding Economic Democracy in Europe\n\nConcepts, Cases and Achieving Progressive Change\n\nThe real effects of Next Generation EU\n\nRecovery Watch Series\n\nInequality and populism\n\nFEPS YAN Series\n\nTightening welfare belts again?\n\nFEPS YAN Series\n\nFind all related events\n\nEvents\n\nUpcoming\n\nBudapest, Hungary\n\nCall to Europe – A free Hungary in a stronger Europe\n\nPast\n\nKošice, Slovakia\n\nWho will pay for the green transition?\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nProgressive Governance Summit 2024\n\nProgressive security: Championing change in times of uncertainty\n\nFind all related news\n\nNews\n\nJoin Tax the EU Billionaires Day!\n\nFEPS welcomes the signing of the La Hulpe Declaration\n\nFEPS supports the declaration of Portimão calling for affordable housing in the EU\n\nAffordable housing needs Europe, Europe needs affordable housing\n\nCall for videos – Your Call to Europe\n\nThis call closed on 24/03/2024\n\nFind all related in the media\n\nIn the media\n\nOrbánov boj z zunanjim sovražnikom ni bil kos inflaciji\n\nby DELO 28/05/2024\n\nIn an article in Delo, László Andor criticises Viktor Orbán government's economic policies, such as not allowing Hungary to join the euro area, which he believes would have helped curb inflation.
