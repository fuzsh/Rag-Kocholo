But it has been stalled for five years by the European Council, formed of ministers representing the member states. The lack of progress is blamed mostly on the little-known Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper).\n\nEach of the 28 EU member states has a permanent representative in Brussels tasked with defending its interests. They meet on Coreper, aiming to achieve agreement between their governments on the issues being debated. But on maternity leave, Coreper hasn’t even started to reconcile national positions. “In spring 2015 the permanent representatives boycotted the meetings proposed by Belgian MEP Maria Arena (Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats), who has a keen interest in the issue, on the grounds that discussion was pointless without a consensus among the ministers,” says a Belgian member of the European civil service . It is not clear which states are blocking it and why. “Since 2010 we’ve been reduced to guesswork.”\n\nThe history of the directive shows the difficulties in establishing a European welfare state, another aspect of the “democratic deficit”. National governments find it convenient to blame Brussels, but they also take advantage of a system that fosters confusion over the division of responsibilities.\n\nIn 2008 the Commission, at the instigation of the EU social affairs commissioner Vladimír Špidla (Czech Republic), proposed to extend the minimum leave to 18 weeks, four weeks longer than provided by the 1992 directive, to follow the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), fight birthrate decline across (...)"
