During the meeting, the two leaders confirmed to strengthen the Japan-Czech relations and agreed on aiming for a peaceful and diplomatic solution on the nuclear issues of North Korea. In regard to the reconstruction of Iraq, the two leaders also agreed for Japan and the Czech Republic to work on various countries to participate in the Conference on the Reconstruction Assistance to Iraq which will be held in Spain this October.\n\nAfter the meeting, the two leaders signed the \"Joint Statement towards Strategic Partnership between Japan and the Czech Republic\" which proclaims their cooperation over the reconstruction assistance for Iraq and prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as strengthening of their bilateral relations in a wide range of fields such as politics, economy and culture. The Joint Statement was announced at the joint press conference.\n\nAt night of the same day (dawn of August 22, Japan time), a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Spidla was held at a State Guest House in Prague.
