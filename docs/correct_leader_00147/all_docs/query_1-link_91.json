        "text": "Political breakthrough on Chantilly Castle\n\nWith the exerted pressure of the French Minister of Labour Xavier Bertrand the leading associations of trade unions and employers took a decision of general principle at a European level which will influence the further course of the revision procedure of the EWC Directive substantially. At a conference of the Labour and Social Affairs Ministers of the EU on July 10th and 11th, 2008 in the Castle of Chantilly north of Paris (photo), the headquarters of the French army in the first World War, they accepted the bill of the European Commission as a base.\n\nDuring the summer break there were intensive discussions between the social partners to overcome the remaining differences. On August 29th, 2008, they presented to the public a common recommendation with eight concrete wording suggestions which shall be changed in the bill. However this change little in the core of the basic philosophy of the outline. More important is the fact that with this joint recommendation all sides have politically accepted a revision of the EWC Directive in the suggested scale.\n\nThe common recommendation in the wording\n\nPress release of EU Commissioner Å pidla for the joint recommendation\n\nObjections as they were formulated by the employers' federations or further-reaching demands of the trade unions (see report in EWC News 2/2008) will hardly play any role. Since it isn't a full revision of the EWC Directive but merely a \"recast\" (a restatement of the existing Directive) as originally planned, the influence possibilities of the European Parliament are strongly restricted. On October 2nd, 2008 the bill was again on the agenda of the meeting of EU Ministers of Labour in Luxembourg. They declared in view of the joint recommendation of the social partners for the fast adoption of the changed Directive. A meeting takes place in Lyon for the transnational social dialog on November 13th and 14th, 2008 where the topic is discussed publicly once again.\n\nThe outline of the new EWC Directive in the wording\n\nSummarized review: the previous course of the revision procedure\n\nPaper of the British government caused unrest\n\nWhile the conservative French government is actively promoting a fast revision of the EWC Directive, an internal paper of the social-democratic British government caused unrest among trade unions. Fundamental British doubts (\"UK Concerns\") are listed there: the competitiveness of EU companies is in danger if European works councils could hinder the implementation of restructurings. A rigorous impact assessment of the amendment of the law is demanded.\n\nThe British government warns of a setback for the European works councils if the legislator limits the flexibility of the business parties too much. This could deter many companies from the formation of an EWC, which don't have any EWC till now yet. An over-regulation would actually weaken the employee voice on a transnational level. Labour Party representatives in the European Parliament however do not share this liberal opinion, they stand behind the demands of the trade unions.\n\nThe British lobby work behind the scenes, however, couldn't prevent the joint recommendation of the social partners from August 29th, 2008. Therefore the British Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) reacted promptly and published a consultation paper on September 11th, 2008. Until October 6th, 2008, British companies can transmit their opinion, which then is given effect by the British government in the European Council of Ministers.\n\nThe consultation paper of the British Department for Business in the wording\n\nResults of an EWC survey of the British government in 2003\n\nImpact assessment of the European Commission\n\nTo be prepared for such objections, the European Commission worked out an impact assessment of its own for the revision of the EWC Directive. The document was published in July 2008.\n\nThe impact assessment of the European Commission\n\nAbstract of the impact assessment\n\nTrade unions present memorandum\n\nThe European trade union institute in Brussels published a scientific memorandum for the revision of the EWC Directive on August 26th, 2008. Based on current experiences concrete recommendations are formulated to the politics.\n\nThe memorandum in the wording\n\nSymposium to the new EWC Directive: What comes towards us there?\n\nMany EWC members are still uncertain about the legal consequences of the revision of the Directive and would like to design their current EWC agreement on the basis of the new legal situation. Works council members who still have the EWC foundation ahead also would like to early include the new regulations in their considerations. A number of questions will also arise for lawyers after the adoption of the new EWC Directive at the end of the year 2008. The training and consultancy network \" euro-workscouncil.net \" offers the opportunity on January 26th, 2009 on a symposium in Hamburg to discuss the new legal situation in detail with experts from Brussels as well as from Germany with theoretical and practical background.\n\nFurther information about the EWC symposium in Hamburg (in German)\n\nThe symposium is carried out in German. Interested parties in other languages are invited to contact us directly for the purpose of individual arrangements.\n\nStudy estimates costs of the EWC work\n\nOn behalf of the European Commission the consultancy firm GHK Consulting from London conducted between January and April 2008 telephone interviews in 70 companies, which have a European works council. Amongst them were 14 French companies as well as ten each with headquarters in Germany and the UK. Meanwhile the final report, which exactly estimates all costs a European works council causes is available.\n\nSo a plenary session of an EWC costs on average â¬ 101,000 and reaches in the individual case â¬ 370,000. Half of it is being allotted to travelling expenses (15%), interpreters (22%), hotel and catering (15%). The continued payment of wages of the workers' representatives is calculated with 29%. The costs of the steering committee come to on an average â¬ 25,700, what contains three annual meetings. A further education for the complete EWC costs â¬ 43,800. Even higher costs cause the SE works councils, so the name of the European works council in the European Company (SE). The \"most expensive\" EWC meetings carry out French companies, followed by German companies, while the EWC costs are less than half as high in British and non-European companies. It can hardly astonish that the quality of EWC participation rights is also developed differently.\n\nWorking time of the managers a part of EWC costs\n\nThe participation of employer representatives in EWC meetings makes an impact with 14% in the calculation. This isn't travelling expenses but merely around the working time. As a rule, the CEO reports together with further managers of the topmost executive level in an EWC plenum meeting. It is reported in the study that in some enterprises up to 13 managers report in the EWC meeting. On todayâs usual top salaries a four-hour Powerpoint presentation of the management can therefore drive the budgeted costs of an EWC quickly into dazzling height. This may also be one of the reasons why the legally specified minimum number of EWC meetings shall not be increased in the opinion of the employers' federations.\n\nHigh adviser costs in French companies\n\nTo be able to meet the policy units of multinational companies on a par, workers' representatives need good advisers. The costs for it amount in non-French companies on â¬ 3,500, in French companies however on â¬ 143,700 and in the individual case up to â¬ 500,000 every year. These numbers show why French councils significantly exhaust their information and consultation rights (if necessary also by legal proceedings) better than councils of other countries. Even well equipped German councils have a considerable catch-up demand in this (see report in EWC News 1/2008).\n\nThe cost differences are easily explained: as a rule, a European works council outside France is advised by a full-time trade union officer who doesn't bill for his activity. On the other hand, there is only little full-time trade union machinery in France which hardly is able to guarantee the continuous advice of a variety of EWC bodies. This gap is closed by private consultancy companies like the Groupe Alpha or Syndex. An additional difference: the EWC in many big German companies has employed subject specialists on a regular basis at its disposal who aren't credited as adviser costs although they do the same work.\n\nThe study of GHK Consulting in the wording\n\nReport about the activity of works council advisers in France (in German)\n\nThe British government also has checked more exactly\n\nThe British Department for Business BERR adds the annual costs for a European works council up on about Â£ 137,000 (â¬ 176,000). By the planned change of the EWC Directive they will increase to Â£ 215,000 (â¬ 277,000). The meeting of a special negotiation body (SNB) of the duration of a day is valued with about Â£ 62,000 (â¬ 80,000).\n\nThe consultation paper of the British government"
