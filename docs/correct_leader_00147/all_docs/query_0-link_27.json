        "text": "PRAGUE, April 29 (CTK) - The government decided last night to earmark 20 million crowns for immediate humanitarian aid to Iraq, Premier Vladimir Spidla (Social Democrats, CSSD) told journalists today.\n\nThe sam sum has been allotted to cover the stay of 20 Czech experts who will help the local authorities and the public of Iraq after the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein and will provide advise to Czech countries interested in participation in the post-war reconstruction of Iraq, Spidla said.\n\nIn a fortnight, the cabinet is expected to make a decision on the use of another more than 360 million crowns which, according to the Foreign Ministry, will go to Iraq. Foreign Minister Cyril Svoboda (Christian Democrats, KDU-CSL) is to submit, together with the Finance, Defence, Industry and Trade and Agriculture Ministries, a common plan for the Czech Republic's involvement in the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq, Spidla said.\n\nOnly then will it be clear whether the allotted sum will be higher or lower than the planned about 400 million crowns, Spidla said.\n\nA large part of the money will go to finance development programmes and for help to Czech companies, Spidla said.\n\nThe Czech Republic has a chance of participating in the reconstruction of Iraq and everything depends mainly on the initiative of Czech companies and businessmen, he said.\n\nThese are only possibilities and not certainties, he added.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Rudolf Jindrak said that the sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council would have to be observed also in the future.\n\nThe Czech Republic will send 20 advisers to Iraq who will be coordinated by former journalist Janina Hrebickova. The government confirmed the appointment of Hrebickova as the Czech coordinator in the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance for Post-war Iraq.\n\nThe complete team, members of which will be proposed by individual ministries, will be known by May 15.\n\nCzechs, along with representatives of the USA, Australia, Britain, Spain and Poland have been invited to attend a meeting on the formation of an interim Iraqi government.\n\nCzech Ambassador to Kuwait Jana Hybaskova informed U.S. reconstruction chief Jay Garner on Monday about Czech experience with the transition to democracy and about Czech plans concerning aid to Iraq.\n\n($1(.657 crowns)"
