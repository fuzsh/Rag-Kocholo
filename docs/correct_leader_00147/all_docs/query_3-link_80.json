        "text": "Štefan Füle, the Czech commissioner-designate for enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, is described by analysts as an experienced and ambitious diplomat. EURACTIV Czech Republic reports.\n\nMost analysts agree that Füle’s long diplomatic career makes him a competent and experienced professional fit for his new job as European commissioner.\n\nIndeed, outgoing Czech Commissioner Vladimír Špidla describes Füle as “fit for that post”.\n\nAn important milestone in his career, and one of the reasons for which he has been nominated to the enlargement post in the next European Commission, was his recent work as minister for European affairs.\n\nAlthough he did much opportunity to show his abilities, he helped to successfully negotiate and finalise the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland and the Czech Republic. Analysts say he was in the shadow of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, but he managed to gain credit in Brussels for his work nevertheless.\n\nAccording to V?ra ?ihá?ková, a research fellow at the Europeum Institute for European Policy, Füle should be seen as a Euro-optimist given the current Czech political climate, which saw President Václav Klaus lead resistance to the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nFüle’s critics, meanwhile, point to his communist past as evidence of his unsuitability for the Brussels post. A former member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS?), he studied at the MGIMO diplomatic institute in Moscow, which was known for its tight links with the Soviet secret service, the KGB.\n\nVáclav Havel, a former anti-communist dissident and former Czech president, recently came to his defence. Havel said that before 1989 there was just one place in the Eastern bloc where one could study diplomacy at the highest level: MGIMO.\n\nFüle himself adds: “As for the [MGIMO] school, I still appreciate it as a top educational institution. As for my KS? membership, I would like to repeat that it is not something I could be proud of.”\n\nFüle’s communist past may prove problematic during the January hearings in the European Parliament. But pundits generally agree that it should not present a significant hurdle, because he is neither the only nor the first commissioner to arrive with such a cumbersome past.\n\nEstonian Commissioner Siim Kallas, for instance, was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and former Polish Commissioner Danuta Hübner was a member of the communist Polish United Workers’ Party.\n\nFüle the Atlanticist\n\nDespite his affiliation with the centre-left Czech Social Democratic Party (?SSD), Füle’s views on international relations and security policy are seen as more pro-Atlanticist and more cautious towards Russia than his party’s official view.\n\nFor example, unlike the ?SSD, he voted to prolong the Czech mission in Afghanistan. Furthermore, he is a staunch promoter of further NATO enlargement, unlike the ?SSD, which is much more moderate in this respect.\n\nAccording to analysts, this is also the main reason for which he gained support from the other large Czech political party – the centre-right ODS, which is known for its pro-American views and for its cautious stance towards Russia.\n\nV?ra ?ihá?ková says she expects Füle to be a strong supporter of EU enlargement to the Western Balkans.\n\nIn an interview for EURACTIV.cz, ?ihá?ková recently said: “With respect to EU enlargement I do not expect any complication as far as Czech politics is concerned. There is a wide consensus among almost all the main Czech political parties in this regard. The only exception is the Christian Democratic KDU-?SL, which does not want Turkey to join the EU. No matter what government is in charge in Prague, I do not expect any communication problem between the Czech commissioner and the Czech Republic,” which she indicated had not always been the case with outgoing Czech Commissioner Špidla.\n\nIndifference to partisan politics\n\nAnalysts agree that Füle was nominated due to his relative indifference to partisan politics, which appears to have helped the main Czech parties agree on his nomination. It should also prove to be a strength in his new post, as the Commission is supposed to be above national or party politics.\n\nThere are other reasons for his nomination. Firstly, he is an experienced diplomat. He speaks very good English and knows how international organisations such as NATO, the UN or the EU work, and he has been Czech minister for European affairs for the last six months.\n\nFüle himself stated “I am familiar with EU structures,” and he prefers to speak about institutions rather than their representatives. Europeum’s ?ihá?ková adds that although he is not very well known in Brussels, he has probably built up contacts as European affairs minister.\n\nSecondly, he is known as a good communicator and seems to understand that nurturing good contacts with journalists is an important part of his work. That would represent a great shift in comparison with outgoing Czech Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, who was extremely introvert, Czech analysts said.\n\nThirdly, he is very demanding with his subordinates, ?ihá?ková says. “He will demand full diligence and concentration from his subordinates. Therefore, he could make his portfolio visible: never mind the fact that he is not well-known in Brussels so far,” she stressed.\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
