Daukanto str. 28, Kaunas\n\nRegistration: here\n\nKaunas – European Capital of Culture 2022 and the Memory Office programme invite everyone who cares about the city’s history, culture and the future of an open and democratic city to meet at the Litvak Culture Forum on 29-30 September. The Forum will take place over several days and will include discussions with renowned artists, scholars and representatives of the cultural world. We will ask questions: what does it mean to be Litvak today? How can art help us understand a complex history?\n\n• What does it mean to be a Litvak today?\n\n• How can art help us remember?\n\n• What can we learn from history today?\n\n• How can living memory teach us the universal values of respect and openness to others, empathy and love?\n\nThe Litvak Cultural Forum is part of the Kaunas 2022 CityTelling Festival organised by the Memory Office programme. Now in its fourth year, the CityTelling Festival opens up the forgotten pages of history.\n\nThis year, the CityTelling Festival will last several months. Starting in mid-July, we will awaken the Jewish memory of the city – we will talk about the rich culture that existed in the city, we will remember the forgotten names of Kaunas citizens and the fates of those who lived here. In October, we will look back at the stories of contemporary Kaunas, and end the festival with a reflection on the future at the International Symposium “The Idea of Europe”.\n\nIn a special cultural programme of the Litvak Forum, we are presenting “Kaunas Kantata”, composed by Philip Miller and Jenny Kagan, together with Lithuanian musicians – choirs, ensembles and soloists – which will remind us once again of the city’s complex history and the fate of its people. This encounter with history is more relevant than ever in today’s context.\n\nA unique programme of academic presentations and presentations of artistic projects will be accompanied by concerts, exhibitions and performances dedicated to Jewish memory. Many of these art projects have been created by world’s Litvaks such as William Kentridge, Philip Miller, Jenny Kagan, Bruce Clarke and others. The discussions will also include the participation of prominent academics such as Prof. James E.

It was a reflection of Marc Chagall’s twelve stained-glass windows mounted high up on the ceiling. They were full of symbols – triangles and circles, imprints of birds, fish, beasts, menorahs and Hebrew letters. A kind of Babylon. However, Shagal’s main source of inspiration is the Bible and his own experience. The image kept changing as the sun set. My work is also full of symbols – the clarinet recalls the former Jewish life in Europe, the percussion and the string quartet are like an allusion to the Biblical world.”\n\nŠenderovas’ work will be performed by the Chordos String Quartet, clarinetist Algirdas Žiūra and percussionist Arkadijus Gotesmanas.

The legacy of interwar photographers\n\n2022 07 28 - 2023 10 05\n\nMausha Levi and Shimon Bajer. The legacy of interwar photographers\n\n2022 July 28 at the Maironis Museum of Lithuanian Literature we will invite you to the exhibition of Lithuanian interwar photographers \"Mausha Levi and Shimon Bajer. The Legacy of Interwar Photographers\", which will enrich program of the Kaunas 2022. The photo studio \"Baer ir Levi\" was founded in Ukmergė around 1918. It is symbolic that the opening of the studio coincided with the proclamation of Independent Lithuania. Shimon Bajer was one of the first and best known owners of a photography studio in Kaunas after the First World War, his studio \"Š. Bajer fotografija\" was located at Laisvės al. Shimon Bajer organized the first Lithuanian Society of Commercial Photographers, which met in his studio.\n\nMausha Levi, according to family legend, gained some experience at a photo studio in New York. About 1923 became the sole owner of the Bajer and Levi photo studio and changed its name to \"M. Levi fotografija\". Over the years, Mausha Levi in Ukmergė and Shimon Bajer in Kaunas created a photo gallery depicting members of the Seimas and peasants, the army and clergy, students and ordinary citizens, famous foreign visitors, writers, artists, modern architecture and everyday street life. The organizer of the exhibition is Faina Borovsky, granddaughter of M. Levi and niece of S. Bajer, who originated in Šiauliai and currently live in New York.\n\nThe photographs reflect the Lithuanian interwar period, capture the bright personalities of that time, and characteristic details. The works are scattered very widely and are discovered even in New York museums, so today the most important thing is to rediscover them, collect them and take care that no one is left forgotten. At that time, the profession of a photographer was complex and multifaceted. Faina Borovsky is convinced: \"It was not enough to just take photos - you had to be a chemist, an illuminator, an artist, draw decorations, print photos. It had to be a universal man - a master,\" Photographs in the archives are selected according to the stamps belonging to the photo studio. All the images found raise many questions, so it is especially important to know what is depicted in the discovered photos. The exhibition features many interesting photographs, the context of which has been deciphered by people interested in history and remembering the interwar period. They aim to show what the cultural life of Lithuania and Jews was like, to remember the experience of the Holocaust.\n\nFB event\n\nRegistration\n\nfrom 09 23 Ecco homo: for those who stayed and those who left\n\n2022 09 23 - 2023 09 01\n\nEcco homo: for those who stayed and those who left\n\nA visual art and contemporary dance project at Fort IX, in collaboration with the National Resistance Museum of Luxembourg.

Monica Bohm, the curator of the exhibition and the artist’s daughter, will be present at the opening of the exhibition.\n\nA comprehensive retrospective of the renowned British artist of Litvak origin invites visitors to explore the artists who’s impressive career spans more than six decades and several continents. The exhibition features black and white and colour images illustrating the different phases of the Dorothy Bohm’s career and inviting to discover a wide array of aesthetically striking and deeply humane works that document people and landscapes in a rapidly changing world.\n\nAccording to exhibition curator Monica Bohm, ‘While the human figure in its natural setting remained the primary focus of Dorothy Bohm’s work, and she still used photography in its purest, un-manipulated form, her approach became more painterly and allusive, with an increasing interest in spatial and other forms of ambiguity.’ Dorothy Bohm’s retrospective at the Kaunas Photography Gallery will offer a glimpse of this transformation and into different elements of the photographer’s creative biography.\n\nDorothy Bohm (born 1924) spent her childhood in Memel (now Klaipėda), where she enjoyed a relatively carefree childhood. When Lithuania was occupied by the Nazis in 1939, the Dorothy’s parents decided to send her to the UK. There, Dorothy graduated in photography and began to practice portrait photography, establishing her own photography studio. Eventually, she abandoned studio photography after becoming interested in street photography. After a long period of shooting mainly black and white images, she used Kodak colour film for the first time, and thereafter abandoned black and white entirely. Although she stopped taking pictures a few years ago, Dorothy Bohm’s passionate engagement with her photography continues unabated. With some twenty-five solo exhibitions and over fifteen publications to her name, she is widely acknowledged as a doyenne of British photography.\n\nCurated by Monica Bohm.\n\nThe exhibition will run until November 13.\n\nThe exhibition is supported by Lithuanian Council for Culture.\n\n09 28 - 10 30 Photography exhibition “Back to Kaunas”\n\n2022 09 28 - 10 30\n\nPhotography exhibition \"Back to Kaunas\"\n\nA photography exhibition of the last Litvaks of Kaunas by Litvak Michael Schubitz (parents born in Kaunas).

Open until 30 October 2022.\n\nWhere? Vytautas Magnus University Central Hall, S. Daukanto str. 28, 2nd floor\n\n09 29 Exhibition “Lithuanians in the Streets of Israel”\n\n2022 09 29\n\nExhibition \"Lithuanians in the Streets of Israel\"\n\nThis exhibition is an invitation to take a walk on a symbolic street in Israel, an amalgam of various streets of the cities of Israel named after prominent Litvaks – spiritual and cultural leaders of the Jewish communities in the present and historical territory of Lithuania, visionaries of the ethnic Jewish state or world-famous scientists and artists. It is also significant that independent Lithuania has realised the importance of these persons to the history and culture of the country; some of these persons have become part of the public culture of remembrance with streets in Vilnius (Gaon, Antokolskio streets) and Kaunas (Mapu, Zamenhofo streets) bearing their names.\n\nThe initial version of this exhibition was displayed at Beit Hatfutsot: Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv in October 2015 during the visit of President Dalia Grybauskaitė of Lithuania to Israel. Lithuania cele- brates the 100th anniversary of the restoration of statehood this year and the State of Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary, so the exhibition in Vilnius has been supplemented by focusing on figures important to the statehood (Simon Rozenbaum – the interwar Lithuanian diplomat and Consul General in Tel Aviv), culture (Lea Goldberg – a famous Israeli writer, who has translated many Lithuanian folk songs into the Hebrew language), etc. of both countries. The lines from the poem by Goldberg accurately depict the relationship of Litvaks with Lithuania – often contradictory, but always painfully nostalgic. These lines were read out during the ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the State of Israel in Jerusalem:\n\nMy homeland – land of beauty and poverty\n\nThe queen has no home, the king has no crown.\n\nThere are seven spring days in the year\n\nAnd cold and rain all the rest.\n\nThe authors of the exhibition are Litvaks living in Israel– photographer Roza Litay with her granddaughter Lia and Dr Carol Hoffman. They immortalised the streets of various cities in Israel, predominantly the streets of Tel Aviv, which have become a symbol of the start of a new life of the Jews in Israel. As Roza Litay said, ‘Tel Aviv is like a physical symbol of the return of the Jews to Israel. Jerusalem is our internal world, our spirit and sanctity and Tel Aviv is our daily life.’ A street name is an important part of the pulsating daily life, chiefly related to the search for a specific address. The memorial and state ideology message sent by the street name in daily life is not normally visible (it becomes apparent during coups and turmoil when monuments are pulled down and streets or squares, etc. are renamed). The main idea behind the exhibition was to draw the eyes of the rushing passer-by to the plate with the street name and thus to capture not only practical information, but also the symbolic memorial message. The message communicated by the street name has its own meanings for the authors of the idea – one meaning for Roza who was born in Lithuania, and a different meaning for Carol, who was born in the US, and is preoccupied with its genealogy and the commemoration of her forefathers in Lithuania, and yet another meaning for Lia Litay, a student born in Israel, who first learned about Lithuania and Litvaks from her grandmother. Therefore, the brief information provided next to the photographs of the names of the streets is just a hint at the biographies of those extremely devout persons, whose contributions to Lithuanian and world culture you will become acquainted with at the Museum of Litvak Culture and Identity due to be opened in Vilnius in the next few years.\n\nAušra Rožankevičiūtė\n\nAuthors of the exhibition Roza Litay, Lia Shiboleth and Dr Carol Hoffman (IL).

Anatoly Shenderov's \"After Shagal\"\n\nThe composer Anatoly Shenderov said of this work: \"Almost 30 years ago, when I was in Jerusalem for the first time, in the special hall (synagogue) of the Hadassah Medical Centre, I saw extremely bright colours on the floor. It was a reflection of Marc Chagall's twelve stained-glass windows mounted high up on the ceiling. They were full of symbols - triangles and circles, imprints of birds, fish, beasts, menorahs and Hebrew letters. A kind of Babylon. However, Shagal's main source of inspiration is the Bible and his own experience. The image was constantly changing as the sun set. My work is also full of symbols - the clarinet recalls the former Jewish life in Europe, the percussion and the string quartet are like an allusion to the Biblical world.\"\n\nShenderov's work will be performed by the Chordos String Quartet, clarinettist Algirdas Žiūra and percussionist Arkady Gotesman. Shenderov and Gotesman have a long personal creative friendship: especially for this work, Gotesman has made a stand that can hold pieces of stained glass.\n\nWhen?

By singing Yiddish songs, Krupoves presents and promotes Lithuania and Jewish culture to the world.\n\n\"This is a concert about those whose glances recorded their lives in an invisible diary, those for whom the barrack wall was a prayer book, who kept their violins, whose fates eventually became the pride of the world. About Kaunas and its special spirit\", say the organisers.\n\nThe concert will commemorate the most prominent Jewish personalities from Kaunas: the philosopher Emanuel Levinas, the poets Leah Goldberg and Abba Kovner. The concert will recall an extraordinary event involving musicians who survived the Kaunas and Vilnius ghettos. On 7 May 1946, in the displaced persons camp in Landsberg, Bavaria, they gave a concert at the Nuremberg Opera House during the Nuremberg Trials to try the Nazis. It was a triumph of spiritual resistance.\n\nThe singer is accompanied by Artūras Anusauskas, violinists Borisas Kirzner and Vytautas Mikeliūnas, double bassist Eugenijus Kanevičius, accordionist Darius Bagdonavičius, clarinettist Haroldas Parulis and percussionist Arkadijus Gotesmanas.\n\nWhen? 29 September 2022\n\nWhere? \"Žalgiris Arena Amphitheatre, Karaliaus Mindaugo Ave. 50\n\n09 30–10 01 THE GRAND PREMIERE! „KAUNAS KANTATA“\n\n09 30 – 10 01\n\n„Kauno kantata“\n\nPublikos laukia nepamirštamas įvykis Kauno „Žalgirio“ arenoje.

The displacement of facts, stories and memories as a means of self-preservation or propaganda is typical for people from Johannesburg, Rome and Kaunas, says the artist. We all choose what to remember and what to push out of our memory. Kentridge hopes to fill in these cracks in memory and, at the same time, talk to us about what we do not remember, consciously or unconsciously.\n\nWhen?
