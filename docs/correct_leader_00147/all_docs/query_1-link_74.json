        "text": "Presented by Equinor.\n\nBy FLORIAN EDER\n\nwith ZOYA SHEFTALOVICH\n\nPRESENTED BY\n\nSend tips here | Tweet @florianeder | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\n\nSEE EU IN COURT, AZ: The European Commission is getting ready to launch legal proceedings against vaccine producer AstraZeneca, five EU diplomats told our colleagues Jillian Deutsch and Jacopo Barigazzi. The Commission raised the matter at a meeting of ambassadors Wednesday, during which the majority of EU countries said they would support suing the company over complaints it massively failed to deliver pledged doses to the bloc. Here’s the scoop.\n\nTHE BREXIT SUPER LEAGUE: Had any doubt football is a highly political sport? Ali Walker, who has been on the case of how the Super League got the mood in Europe so wrong, has this latest exhibit: Conceding the plan to create the breakaway league was dead in the water, Juventus chief Andrea Agnelli searched for a scapegoat, and landed on … Brexit. He told Reuters he had heard “speculation” that “if six teams would have broken away and would have threatened the EPL [English Premier League], politics would have seen that as an attack to Brexit and their political scheme.”\n\nGOOD MORNING. And now back to the normal level-playing-field competition in the major European leagues — where Manchester City is on course to win the third championship in the last four years, I reckon; Bayern München is most likely to win its ninth national championship in a row (with nary an oligarch involved) — something Juventus Turin already achieved with last year’s title; Paris St Germain, meanwhile, won seven of the past eight seasons. And let’s not dream of any possible suspense in Spanish football, home to the only two teams that theoretically remain in the league of greed that eventually wasn’t.\n\nON THE EASTERN FLANK\n\nWELCOME TO THE FREE WORLD: The Lithuanian government has agreed on measures aimed at helping Belarusian people and businesses relocate to the country. “Belarus authorities continue repressions against people and business, especially against the most progressive IT community,” Aušrinė Armonaitė, the Lithuanian economy minister, told Playbook. “We still need parliament’s approval but the political will and understanding of how important these amendments are for liberal democracy, is definitely here,” she said. An “open-door policy brought Lithuania to EU and NATO. By opening doors to Belarus businesses and people we help our closest neighbors and make one more step towards faster economic recovery.”\n\nINVISIBLE RED LINES: Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the situation in Belarus in his annual “state of the nation” address on Wednesday, claiming “The use of unjust sanctions is growing into something more dangerous: a coup attempt in Belarus.” Putin warned the West not to cross a “red line” with Moscow, before adding “We’ll decide for ourselves in each case where the red line is.” How convenient. The BBC has a write-up.\n\n**A message from Equinor: If the industrial heart of Europe beats weak, our communities lose drive and appetite for change. Equinor work hard to deliver decarbonization solutions for European industry and power generation, including first-of-a-kind hydrogen and carbon capture projects that we hope inspire other similar EU regions to action.**\n\nHEALTH UNION\n\nIDEALLY, YES: Angela Merkel backed Ursula von der Leyen’s quest to formalize and increase EU powers over matters of health. “Ideally we would have always taken a European approach when it comes to lockdowns,” said the German chancellor on Wednesday. Since that was not the case, she said “it is good” that the Commission president wants more power to coordinate and regulate.\n\nTreaty change not excluded: “I believe that Europe needs more competencies in the area of health,” Merkel said in her video-conversation with EPP group leader Manfred Weber, who suggested the Conference on the Future of Europe should prepare the ground for a new legal base for such powers. Merkel, in part, agreed: “Probably you also have to change the Treaties for this.”\n\nAnyway: “I have always been open to Treaty changes if they make sense,” Merkel said. “This is not an end in itself. And you can also do a lot of things through coordinating policy, at intergovernmental level, but it certainly makes sense to also have European competencies for certain situations, especially pandemics.” Hans von der Burchard has more.\n\nThe unruly: But new EU powers might not be particularly popular in every EU capital. Merkel made it clear that for her, the outcome is more important than the form it takes: “Wherever we do not speak with one voice, we won’t be able to act strongly,” she said. “What I would like to see is that we don’t act European where it suits us at the moment — and where it doesn’t, we break away.” In a dig at countries including Austria and Hungary (and her own ally, Bavarian state premier Markus Söder), Merkel said “I don’t find it good” that some are buying Russian or Chinese vaccines before the EU approves them.\n\nSorry, not safe: “The truth is, we haven’t treated our pharmaceutical industry so well for many years,” said Merkel, making the case for a re-think of industrial policies. The message: It’s not just the fancy tech stuff that needs to be taken care of — and those insisting that trade along global supply chains will solve any issue whatsoever should reconsider their general skepticism toward the concept: “I am glad that we still have pharmaceutical production in Belgium, Holland, Germany,” she said, adding, after a little hiatus, that France and Spain also still produce pharma.\n\nWarning for India? “We now have a situation with India where, in connection with the emergency situation of the pandemic, we are worried whether the pharmaceutical products will still come to us,” observed Merkel. “Of course, we have only allowed India to become such a large pharmaceutical producer in the first place, also from the European side, in the expectation that this should then also be complied with. If that is not the case now, we will have to rethink.”\n\nVAX TO THE MAX: Global trade negotiators are deadlocked over a proposal that would suspend intellectual property rights on coronavirus medical products to enable less-wealthy countries to develop them. The plan, pitched by South Africa and India at the WTO, is now gaining traction, but as Ashleigh Furlong and Sarah Anne Aarup report, waiving patents might not actually boost global access to vaccines.\n\nMONEY MATTERS\n\nKARLSRUHE GREEN LIGHT: EU ambassadors were among the first to know on Wednesday that Germany’s federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe had rejected a request to block the EU’s recovery fund from coming into effect. The message their German colleague Michael Clauß delivered to the Coreper meeting of ambassadors, according to diplomats, carried a sense of contentment with the fact Karlsruhe has opted to postpone, one more time, what some had feared could be a final showdown with the EU.\n\nNo need for urgent action: The court said in a statement that the complaint, brought last month, is “neither inadmissible from the outset nor manifestly unfounded” — but stalling the process for the entire EU outweighs the risk of breaching Germany’s constitution. “A summary examination does not reveal a high probability of a violation” of the country’s fundamental law, said the court. Details of the decision here from Paola Tamma.\n\nThe court will still assess the complaint’s merits: If we take Wednesday’s decision as a trailblazer, the judges are considering economic arguments for the necessity of the fund (and they are granting the Bundestag wiggle room to take on considerable financial risk — more than the plaintiffs said the German parliament should have). They are looking very closely at the construction of the fund, its liability rules and built-in limitations. And they might send the question to the EU’s top court, should further doubt arise during the in-depth assessment.\n\nFor now: In the immediate short term, the decision means German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier can now ratify the Own Resources Decision (a step that is still pending in 10 EU countries).\n\nThe other looming showdown: The European Parliament started its own scrutiny of the national recovery plans every EU country must present, kicking off the exercise with the first meeting of a working group that was set up to deal with the matter. Will Parliament’s involvement add another frontline in the battle for control over how the money is spent, or rather ease tension between countries that has started to emerge over in Council? We’ll know over the summer.\n\nWON’T BE EASY: Merkel, asked about the state of the rule of law in the EU during Wednesday’s event by the interviewer, Anne Gellinek of broadcaster ZDF, suggested last year’s spat about the conditionality in the EU budget was not the culmination but rather the beginning of a fight: “There are majorities in power that don’t implement the values that we expect and there are shortcomings in the legal sphere or in the freedom of press sphere,” she said, adding that the EU will not compromise on these values.\n\nHere’s Merkel-ish for ‘hell could break loose’: Enforcing the rule of law “is not easy and could become even more important in the coming years,” the German chancellor said, adding that “we have addressed the issue of the rule of law in our [Council] presidency in a very complicated procedure. Certain developments … are among the most difficult and sensitive imaginable in the handling of Europe.”\n\nCouncil defeat: The EU’s General Court ruled on Wednesday that Council had no right to withhold an opinion by its own legal service that raised significant concern about the rule of law conditionality — the opinion was from 2018, when the provision was still a key element of the Commission’s proposal for the current Multiannual Financial Framework. Law professor Laurent Pech, who took the Council to court, considers it a big win — less so because of the actual opinion (which POLITICO first reported on at the time) but because it limits the options for Council to classify legal advice by its own officials as secret. The Council, for its part, said it has yet to decide what to do in response to the ruling.\n\nAVOIDING COVID SIDE EFFECTS: With the pandemic heavily impacting tourism, some countries could be tempted to turn even more of a blind eye on less-sunny sources of income, like money-laundering. Malta, the country where journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was following the money before being murdered in October 2017, is one of those places where this risk must be avoided, warned Evarist Bartolo, the country’s minister of foreign affairs.\n\nReality check: Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a stark reality-check for us,” Bartolo said during a workshop organized by La Valletta to tackle money-laundering. “With tourism stagnating due to the COVID pandemic, the significance of the financial industry has further increased,” he argued. “Yet, a balance needs to be maintained between the quest by small international financial centers to grow their financial industry … and the need to fully and sustainably mitigate the oftentimes elevated risks that arise from such business concepts.” He added: “We in Malta have experience first-hand what can happen if that balance is lost.”\n\n**POLITICO Live virtual event \"Fit for 55 — How will the EU move towards climate neutrality?\" is happening on May 5, with MEP Peter Liese, Diederik Samsom, head of cabinet of European Commission executive vice president Frans Timmermans, and Ursula Woodburn, head of EU relations, CLG Europe. This first event of the Energy Visions series will focus on how the Fit for 55 energy and climate package will come together and how it aims to move Europe towards the ultimate Green Deal goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Register today.**\n\nBUSY COMMISSION\n\nAI RULES: The Commission has achieved a world first, proposing binding rules for artificial intelligence, in one of the major non-COVID projects of Team von der Leyen, and in particular of Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager and Commissioner Thierry Breton. Melissa Heikkilä has the details of what the Commission announced on Wednesday, and walks you though the six key battles ahead for Europe’s AI law.\n\nSUSTAINABLE BUREAUCRACY: In the fight against climate change, corporate reporting may seem an unlikely weapon. But not for the Commission, which unveiled plans for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive that puts companies’ green disclosures at the heart of efforts to mobilize more private capital into climate-friendly investments. Or so they say: Note that being in the market for investors is not among the criteria of whether a company has to comply with the new requirements. More for Energy and Climate, Sustainability and Financial Services Pros by Hannah Brenton here.\n\nTAX ‘EM INTO BEING GREEN: While some world leaders prepare showy new climate pledges ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden’s Earth Day summit starting today, the EU is arriving with a threat: do more to cut emissions or the world’s largest single market will make you pay. Karl Mathiesen and Paola Tamma have the details.\n\nOpinion — NATO’S climate challenge: Climate change is making the world a more dangerous place, with rising sea levels and more extreme weather increasing competition for scarce resources and fueling tensions and conflict, writes NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in this op-ed for POLITICO. “Climate change threatens global security, so NATO must be part of the response.”\n\nLE PERSONNEL\n\nHOW DARE HE: Former Commissioner Günther Oettinger has received approval from the Commission for every gig he has taken on in his new consultancy, so everything is above board, despite criticism from NGOs. But he may have pushed his luck too far, or the revolving door too heavily: Oettinger is on the advisory board of a comms firm that has Philip Morris as a client — and the connection with a tobacco firm has led to the EU Ombudsman becoming concerned. More from Lili Bayer and Hans von der Burchard.\n\nJUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS: Eugene Regan was reappointed as a judge of the EU’s Court of Justice, while Athanasios Rantos was reappointed as advocate-general. Meanwhile, Dimitrios Gratsias was named as a new judge of the top court and Nicholas Emiliou was appointed as a new advocate-general.\n\nBIRTHDAYS: Former European Council President Donald Tusk, now EPP president; MEPs Jaak Madison and Michael Gahler; Former MEP Hermann Winkler; Vladimír Špidla, former Czech prime minister and European Commissioner; Anna Drozd from the UK Law Societies Brussels office; International Maritime Organization’s Roel Hoenders; Nick Ashton-Hart of the Digital Trade Network and ICC United Kingdom; Renew Europe’s Jeroen Reijnen.\n\nMANY THANKS: Jacopo Barigazzi, Hans von der Burchard and producer Miriam Webber.\n\n**A message from Equinor: As Europe greens its economy, we in Equinor are ready to support ambitious targets. Partnering with European industry for large scale decarbonization in hard to abate sectors by means of clean and low-carbon hydrogen is one of our answers to the European energy transition. The world needs energy producers that can deliver affordable energy with lower emissions and large industry-scale projects that represent bold but practical steps towards delivering on the net-zero ambition. Our H2H Saltend project in the UK that is planned to produce hydrogen at scale, can play a leading role in the UK’s journey to net zero by 2050, renew the UK’s largest industrial cluster, and unlock technology that will put the UK at the forefront of a global hydrogen economy. We in Equinor hope continental Europe will follow the UK with the same determination.**"
