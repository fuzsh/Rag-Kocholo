        "text": "The motto of the Czech presidency of the EU, “Europe without barriers”, puts at the top of the agenda the four basic freedoms that are meant to be at the heart of the EU’s policies – the free movement of goods, capital, workers and services. The Czech government wants to focus on two of these freedoms as part of efforts to complete the single EU market. The Czech Republic’s first priority is free movement of workers. It will put pressure on those four member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Germany) that have not yet opened any significant part of their labour markets to workers from the states which joined the EU in 2004, to do so. The current restrictions remain in place until April 2009 and can be extended until 2011 if countries can show a risk of major disruption to their labour markets.\n\nThe Czechs will use a report they commissioned from the European Commission’s department of employment and social affairs, led by Vladimír Špidla, the European commissioner for social affairs and former Czech prime minister, to boost their arguments for lifting restrictions. The study, which was published on 18 November, showed that the economies of countries that have opened their labour markets have benefited from the influx of foreign workers, as have the countries of origin of these workers.\n\nBut the Czechs’ chances of getting the four stragglers to liberalise are limited as they are unlikely to agree to lift restrictions at a time of deep economic recession and looming unemployment.\n\nServices directive\n\nThe second fundamental freedom that the Czech government will be focusing on is the free movement of services and, in particular, the implementation of the services directive, which is meant to be enacted in national law by December 2009 at the latest. The directive is designed to allow service providers to operate in other member states than their own, by removing administrative barriers.\n\nBut the scope of the directive is limited, as significant parts of the services sector, including transport and social services, are excluded from it. The new EU member states were disillusioned with the watered down version of the directive that was agreed in 2006 after bitter negotiations, as richer older member states feared that their companies could be priced out of the market by cheaper competitors from central and eastern Europe.\n\nThe Czech presidency will hold a conference on services in the internal market in February.\n\nIt is also planning a number of other initiatives to show the positive effects of enlargement, including publishing a study it has commissioned from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, the rich countries’ Paris-based think-tank.\n\nLisbon strategy\n\nThese issues will be discussed at the informal meeting of competitiveness ministers in May and at a conference on “five years after enlargement” in March.\n\nThe Czech presidency will also focus on the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, which aims to boost the EU’s competitiveness. At the EU summit in March, which focuses on economic issues, the presidency will take stock of the first year of the second cycle of the Lisbon strategy and the follow-up to the revised Lisbon strategy national programmes that the Commission will present next week (16 December).\n\nThe Czech government is keen to emphasise the need for more structural reform and to reduce red tape by pursuing the better-regulation agenda."
