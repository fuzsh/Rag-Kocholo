        "text": "judge of the European Court of Human Rights\n\nAleÅ¡ Pejchal\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIÂ am greatly honored toÂ contribute toÂ an interesting discussion about freedom ofÂ speech and protection ofÂ privacy before this forum inÂ this beautiful place. When IÂ was thinking about myÂ presentation, I concluded that itÂ must beÂ both legal and journalistic. ItÂ is upÂ to you toÂ assess toÂ what extent IÂ was successful.\n\nIÂ will tell you aÂ story about aÂ very successful prime minister and also two journalists and members ofÂ aÂ tribunal established byÂ parliament, but first and foremost, members ofÂ human community. Because human community isÂ most important inÂ cases concerning the protection ofÂ freedom ofÂ speech. OnÂ aÂ deserted island its one and only citizen can shout whatever heÂ wants, and heÂ needs noÂ protection. There isÂ nobody who would protect him and nobody who would listen toÂ him and could possibly feel outraged byÂ his words.\n\nItÂ is remarkable that itÂ was actually former Syrian slave Publilius Syrus, who inÂ Ancient Rome inÂ the first century B.C. articulated aÂ great idea: âSibi primum auxilium eripere est leges tollere.â âObstructing the law means depriving ourselves ofÂ the basic protection.â This extraordinary idea will take usÂ through the whole story. But letâs get back toÂ the main heroes ofÂ my tale.\n\nMr. Bartholomew Patrick Ahern was the head ofÂ the Irish government for aÂ very long time, from 1997 toÂ 2008. During his premiership Ireland was nicknamed âThe Celtic Tigerâ. The national economy was unbelievably thriving, and the Prime Minister was literally aÂ darling ofÂ satisfied citizens almost until his bitter end.\n\nTwenty years before becoming the Prime Minister, Mr. Ahern was aÂ Member ofÂ Parliament, heÂ had rather big experience inÂ the government, first asÂ the Labor Minister, and later inÂ aÂ much more significant position asÂ the Finance Minister. And inÂ the period when heÂ was responsible for the national budget, some financial transactions were made which, metaphorically speaking, have later broken his neck.\n\nBut letâs not run ahead ofÂ events. ItÂ is necessary toÂ note here that during his premiership, heÂ paid several visits toÂ the Czech Republic. First, President ofÂ the Senate ofÂ the Czech Republic atÂ that time Petr Pithart received him inÂ the Senate onÂ 21 April 2004. The Irish Prime Minister delivered aÂ speech inÂ the Senate onÂ the expansion ofÂ the European Union which was, asÂ all ofÂ us know, very topical for the Czech Republic inÂ 2004. But itÂ was noÂ coincidence that itÂ was just Mr. Bertie (as heÂ was familiarly referred to) Ahern toÂ address the Czech Senate. Ireland was presiding over the European Union atÂ that time.\n\nAlmost aÂ month later, 20Â May 2004, Mr. Ahern came toÂ Prague again, this time toÂ meet with his EUÂ colleague, Mr. VladimÃ­r Å pidla, the Czech Premier atÂ that time. The topic ofÂ their discussion was not anÂ ordinary issue, but the question ofÂ the adoption ofÂ the Constitution for Europe; just aÂ year before the citizens inÂ France rejected the draft ofÂ this Constitution inÂ aÂ referendum onÂ 29 May 2005, and two days later, onÂ 1Â June, the same did the citizens inÂ the Netherlands.\n\nHowever, letâs get back toÂ Ireland; Mr. Ahern was somewhat more important there than inÂ the Czech Republic. But ifÂ you browsed through the Internet you would have found out that onÂ 6Â May 2008 the Irish Prime Minister involuntarily left his post. Most readers would certainly beÂ happy about the explanation which journalists released onÂ the server âLidovky.czâ. IÂ quote:â The details about Ahernâs transactions were first published byÂ The Irish Times inÂ the spring two years ago. AtÂ that time the Premier confessed that heÂ had received untaxed financial gifts from atÂ least 39Â businessmen, but heÂ denied that heÂ had done anything that would beÂ illegal â. This isÂ to say that journalists allegedly made the Prime Minister resign because ofÂ suspected corruption.\n\nBut the reality was slightly different. InÂ 2006 aÂ remarkable story, concerning Mr. Ahern, began toÂ develop, the end ofÂ which was written byÂ the the European Court of Human Rights onÂ 30 September 2014.\n\nBefore weÂ get toÂ the two journalists mentioned above, IÂ should briefly mention the so-called Mahon Tribunal. Under the Tribunals ofÂ Inquiry (Evidence) Act ofÂ 24 March 1921, meaning simply under the act onÂ inquiry tribunals, asÂ amended, the Irish Parliament founded such anÂ inquiry tribunal inÂ 1997 inÂ order toÂ investigate into the alleged corruption ofÂ politicians inÂ connection with planning aÂ developer construction inÂ the Dublin area.\n\nIÂ cannot avoid pointing out that the respective 1921 legislation was issued before the conclusion ofÂ the Anglo-Irish Agreement ofÂ 6Â December 1922 under which free Irish state separated from Northern Ireland which continued toÂ be part ofÂ the United Kingdom. However, the tribunal established inÂ 1997 was obviously the tribunal ofÂ the Irish Republic. And the name Mahon Tribunal was coined because its last President was Judge Mahon. The tribunal had all investigative powers which belong toÂ the High Court, including the summons and examination ofÂ witnesses, orÂ the request toÂ submit written documents.\n\nThe Inquiry (Mahon) Tribunal immediately began toÂ work very hard; from November 1997 toÂ March 2012, the estimated investigation costs were almost three hundred million EUR. ItÂ was the longest and most expensive investigation inÂ the Irish Republic.\n\nAnd finally, itÂ is back toÂ the two journalists: InÂ 2006 Mr. Colm Keena was 46, and Ms. Geraldine Kennedy was 55.Â Both were undoubtedly experienced journalists. AtÂ that time, heÂ was aÂ political affairs reporter, and she was the editor atÂ The Irish Times. The tribunal discovered anÂ important clue for its investigation. OnÂ 29 June 2006 itÂ wrote aÂ strictly private and confidential letter to Mr.Â K., who was aÂ businessman and also aÂ friend ofÂ Prime Minister Ahern, asking toÂ explain some payments, especially toÂ whom they were paid and why. The issue were the payments from the end ofÂ 1993, atÂ the time when Mr. Bertie Ahern was the Finance Minister. Mr.Â K. answered the questions posed byÂ the tribunal through his attorney.\n\nNow comes aÂ version ofÂ journalists which can beÂ neither confirmed nor disproved. All ofÂ aÂ sudden, aÂ copy ofÂ the whole correspondence between Mr. K. and the Inquiry Tribunal allegedly appeared onÂ Mr. Colm Keenaâs table onÂ 19 September 2006. The copies were delivered anonymously.\n\nColm Keena informed editor Geraldine Kennedy. The decision was unambiguous. Check what you can and release it. IÂ suppose 99%Â journalists would doÂ the same.\n\nAtÂ this stage IÂ need toÂ make aÂ comment. Have the journalists proceeded like watchdogs ofÂ democracy and the rule ofÂ law? Have they discovered anything new asÂ regards the Prime Minister ofÂ Ireland byÂ deciding toÂ publish part ofÂ the investigation ofÂ aÂ completely independent, professional, democratic institution which had very good reasons not toÂ publish anything at the moment? IÂ will not answer the question but will continue with myÂ story.\n\nOnÂ 21 September 2006 the whole Ireland and the entire world could read anÂ article inÂ The Irish Times with anÂ explosive headline: âTribunal Investigates Payments toÂ the Premier.â The article was based especially onÂ the letter from the tribunal toÂ Mr. K. Whole passages from the letter were used. The author ofÂ the article said that Mr. K. was just one ofÂ several developers who had offered bribes estimated atÂ 50 â 100Â thousand EURO toÂ Mr. Ahern when heÂ was the Finance Minister. InÂ the article, Mr. K. and the Premier refused any bribes.\n\nThis was the moment ofÂ the real start ofÂ the case which had its final sequel atÂ the seven-member senate ofÂ the European Court of Human Rights. This was the tipping point ofÂ the events. OnÂ the day, when the article was released, the tribunal sent aÂ letter toÂ Geraldine Kennedy expressing concern over the fact that the newspaper had published materials which were strictly private and confidential, and which were labeled asÂ such. ItÂ said that publishing these confidential documents before they were assessed inÂ the appropriate procedure, harmed the work ofÂ the tribunal and the rights ofÂ those who were mentioned inÂ the article. ItÂ also noted that itÂ had the right toÂ appeal toÂ the relevant court inÂ this matter.\n\nOnÂ the same day, Mr. K.âs attorneys approached the lady toÂ protest that the mentioned article infringed his rights. AÂ legal war flared upÂ on all possible battle fronts. AsÂ regards the Convention onÂ the Protection ofÂ Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, itÂ was aÂ fight between Article 8Â and Article 10,Â i.e. between the protection ofÂ privacy and freedom ofÂ speech.\n\nMs. Kennedy sent a cold answer to the tribunal the next day. Yes, The Irish Times received anonymously aÂ copy ofÂ the correspondence mentioned inÂ the article. However, she considered itÂ aÂ matter ofÂ public interest toÂ verify and publish everything. OfÂ course, she fully recognized the fact that the tribunal isÂ an important public authority, but the newspapers were obliged toÂ inform the public.\n\nThe tribunal objected and released anÂ order onÂ 26 September 2006 for journalists toÂ give toÂ the tribunal all documents which served asÂ the basis for the published article. Ms. Kennedy answered the same day that all the documents had been destroyed following consultations with legal experts.\n\nThe tribunal decided toÂ summon both journalists onÂ 29 September 2019. The journalists obliged and appeared before the tribunal. Nothing more was revealed than the earlier explanation that the materials had been destroyed. Ms. Kennedy only explained that asÂ the editor, she had given the instruction toÂ publish the article because the tribunal could decide that the facts itÂ had discovered about the payments toÂ the Prime Minister would beÂ outside its jurisdiction, and asÂ aÂ consequence nothing would have been published.\n\nOfÂ course, itÂ was then the courtsâ turn. The tribunal had toÂ appeal toÂ the court; meanwhile, journalists were quite atÂ ease. After all, the published article onÂ the Prime Minister was literally aÂ megahit.\n\nFirst ofÂ all, the tribunal had toÂ assess the situation and decide how toÂ proceed. ItÂ happened onÂ 5Â October 2006. The three-member tribunal arrived atÂ the conclusion that the behavior ofÂ journalists discredited its work and the tribunal had noÂ power toÂ impose any penalty. Therefore, itÂ had toÂ appeal toÂ the High Court toÂ protect its integrity and the public confidence inÂ its work. The media accused the tribunal ofÂ the leak ofÂ information. But all tribunal members were convinced that itÂ was out ofÂ the question. Therefore, inÂ the interest ofÂ the credibility ofÂ the tribunal itÂ was necessary toÂ identify the originator ofÂ the information leak, which the journalists precluded byÂ scrapping the documents which could lead toÂ discovering all necessary facts. The tribunalâs activity could not make the impression that itÂ would harm the interests ofÂ any involved party.\n\nThe action was filed onÂ 13 February 2007. The arguments ofÂ both parties did not change much. The tribunal claimed that its work could not allow the questioning ofÂ the integrity ofÂ persons who were investigated, and that isÂ exactly what happened byÂ publishing leaked information. The Irish Times, through Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Keena, adamantly defended any hint ofÂ breaking the protection ofÂ their source.\n\nThe High Court verdict ofÂ 23 October 2007 concluded that the Tribunal had the right toÂ investigate and toÂ find how the information leak had happened.\n\nThe most difficult thing was toÂ assess the balance between the functioning ofÂ aÂ democratically established tribunal and the freedom ofÂ speech ofÂ journalists which included the refusal toÂ publish the source of information. InÂ this respect, the High Court concluded that the rights and interests ofÂ the third party had toÂ be taken into account. ItÂ obviously acknowledged that journalists are not obliged toÂ reveal the source ofÂ information, however, the court had the authority toÂ assess all facts and circumstances. ByÂ destroying the required documents, the journalists assumed the position ofÂ judges who decided the case entirely inÂ their favor, irrespective ofÂ the rights and interests ofÂ the third party. The High Court described the behavior ofÂ journalists asÂ aÂ flagrant violation ofÂ the rule ofÂ law because they cannot stand above the law and usurp the function ofÂ the court, asÂ it happened inÂ this case. The journalists appealed toÂ the Supreme court. The verdict ofÂ 31 July 2009 isÂ very interesting. The journalists neither won nor lost. Many years on, Ms. Geraldine Kennedy called itÂ aÂ Pyrrhic victory.\n\nThe Supreme Court basically satisfied the journalistsâ appeal and rejected the tribunalâs complaint. ItÂ criticized the approach ofÂ the High Court concluding that itÂ had been too strict. ItÂ was too much focused onÂ the reprehensible acts ofÂ journalists destroying the documents and thus depreciating toÂ aÂ certain extent the privilege ofÂ journalists not toÂ reveal their source ofÂ information. But itÂ admitted that the court had toÂ honor journalistic privileges, but onÂ the other hand noÂ citizen, including aÂ journalist, had the right toÂ request the exclusion from aÂ legal process.\n\nHowever, inÂ this verdict, the Supreme Court did not make aÂ decision onÂ the issue ofÂ the statutory costs, itÂ stipulated that the issue would beÂ dealt with separately. With aÂ little bit ofÂ phantasy, this decision could beÂ expected toÂ stack the cardsâ¦\n\nAnd the Supreme Court took its time. OnÂ 26 November 2009 itÂ released aÂ comprehensive decision which did not spare journalists atÂ all. According toÂ the Supreme Court decision, journalists took the role ofÂ arbiters about aÂ proper balance between the relevant interests and rights. The act ofÂ scrapping the documents shifted this balance one-sidedly toÂ the benefit ofÂ journalists. This criminal, purposeful conduct ofÂ journalists deprived them, according toÂ the Supreme Court, ofÂ the usual expectations that inÂ case ofÂ success inÂ the subject, the statutory costs would beÂ paid toÂ them. The tribunal was competent toÂ conduct investigation which was, toÂ aÂ certain extent, thwarted byÂ the conduct ofÂ journalists, and itÂ was fully authorized toÂ appeal toÂ the High Court. And, according toÂ the opinion ofÂ the Supreme Court, inÂ this quite exceptional situation, the Supreme Court imposed onÂ the journalists, orÂ rather The Irish Times, the duty toÂ pay all the statutory costs toÂ the tribunal ofÂ both the High Court and the Supreme Court procedures.\n\nThe tribunal evaluated the costs almost aÂ year later, inÂ October 2010. The amount was exorbitant, 393Â 055, 42Â EUR. However, the amount was the subject toÂ review and assessment ofÂ the Taxing Master ofÂ the High Court. The proceedings onÂ the assessment ofÂ the amount ofÂ the statutory costs were suspended; and IÂ am sorry IÂ do not know what the final amount actually was.\n\nBut before the evaluation ofÂ the statutory costs was made, Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Keena appealed toÂ the European Court ofÂ Human Rights onÂ 19 May 2010.\n\nThe journalists complained pursuant Article 10Â of the Convention onÂ the Protection ofÂ Human Rights and Freedoms, that their right toÂ protect their journalistic sources were violated. They claimed that the infringement had neither anÂ evident nor anÂ appropriate legal basis, itÂ did not follow any ofÂ the legitimate aims acknowledged inÂ Article 10,Â paragraph 2Â of the Convention, and asÂ such could not beÂ considered necessary inÂ aÂ democratic society. Pursuant Article 6Â of the Convention, the journalists also complained that imposing the statutory costs onÂ them asÂ the successful party was unfair, inappropriate, and arbitrary. They invoked aÂ violation ofÂ Article 13Â of the Convention that they had noÂ effective instruments ofÂ remedy inÂ accordance with the convention. Referring toÂ Article 1Â of Protocol No.1 ofÂ the Convention, they also complained that the decision onÂ the statutory costs imposed onÂ them violated their ownership rights. Finally, under Article 14,Â inÂ connection with the articles ofÂ the Convention IÂ already mentioned, they pleaded that they had been exposed toÂ unjustified different treatment than persons inÂ aÂ similar situation.\n\nYou can look upÂ the decision ofÂ the Senate ofÂ the 5th Section ofÂ the European Court of Human Rights from 30Â September 2014 onÂ the webpages ofÂ the Council ofÂ Europe. Therefore, IÂ will cut aÂ long story short.\n\nItÂ should beÂ noted that all proposals ofÂ the complainants were rejected asÂ clearly unfounded. And the complaint was declared inappropriate byÂ the majority decision ofÂ the members ofÂ the Senate inÂ which IÂ was also sitting.\n\nWeÂ need toÂ realize that the point ofÂ the complaint was the duty toÂ pay the statutory costs, and according toÂ the journalists, itÂ was the violation ofÂ several articles ofÂ the Convention onÂ the part ofÂ the High Contracting Party, and especially anÂ unfortunate infringement ofÂ freedom ofÂ speech. And so, from the reasoning ofÂ the decision ofÂ the Senate, itÂ will beÂ probably most important toÂ mention only several crucial principles which were important for the decision:\n\nOnly after the Tribunal hinted atÂ its right toÂ appeal toÂ the court and after itÂ ordered toÂ submit the documents, the complainants â journalists decided toÂ scrap the evidence which was the basis for the court decision onÂ questionable public interests.\n\nThe complainants had the protection ofÂ courts toÂ be able toÂ defend their rights.\n\nAll persons must respect the role ofÂ the courts and noÂ one, including journalists, should usurp the judicial function.\n\nFinally, the European Court of Human Rights presumed that the real purpose ofÂ the decision ofÂ the Irish Supreme Court was toÂ send aÂ signal that noÂ party isÂ above the law and legal jurisdiction ofÂ courts.\n\nIÂ did not tell you this story because ofÂ the final decision ofÂ the European Court of Human Rights. This story conceals many more questions which are important toÂ discuss inÂ relation toÂ freedom ofÂ speech and protection ofÂ privacy ofÂ individuals. You would hardly find any similar story featuring aÂ successful prime minister, excellent journalists, anÂ investigation tribunal established byÂ the parliament, national courts, and finally anÂ international court. Therefore, let meÂ complete myÂ story with two observations.\n\nThe High Court took aÂ decision atÂ aÂ time when Mr. Ahern was the Prime Minister. The Supreme Court took aÂ decision after Mr. Ahernâs resignation. ItÂ may not beÂ important, but itÂ definitely isÂ interesting. The other observation isÂ deeper. Mr. Ahern did not resign inÂ September 2006 following the release ofÂ those documents which were mysteriously leaked during the investigation byÂ the tribunal which was established byÂ the Irish Parliament. InÂ 2007 Mr. Bertie Ahern led his party inÂ the election campaign again, and despite all news articles and suspicions heÂ won the election and became the Irish Premier for the third time inÂ succession.\n\nInÂ February 2008 Mr. Ahern was investigated byÂ judge Mahon again. There was aÂ fierce exchange ofÂ views. Mr. Mahon was anÂ excellent investigative judge. The Prime Minister lost his nerve and admitted that there had been some money sent toÂ the account ofÂ his former partner Celie Larkin asÂ aÂ loan. InÂ March former secretary ofÂ Mr. Ahern, Ms. GrÃ¡inne Garruth was unable toÂ bear the weight ofÂ evidence, and soÂ she admitted that some money had been deposited onÂ the account ofÂ her former boss. Well, the two ladies and anÂ excellent judge stood behind the fact that the Prime Minister was unable toÂ deal with the old sins, and, onÂ 2Â April 2008 heÂ announced his resignation asÂ of 6Â May 28,Â while the journalists continued toÂ be engaged inÂ aÂ lawsuit.\n\nWhat are the fates ofÂ our heroes today?\n\nMr. Bertie Ahern isÂ 68, heÂ is noÂ longer engaged inÂ politics but inÂ February 2015 heÂ won the honorary title ofÂ Doctor ofÂ Laws atÂ Washington College inÂ Chestertown, Maryland.\n\nMr. Colm Keena isÂ 59, and heÂ is still aÂ journalist atÂ The Irish Times.\n\nMs. Geraldine Kennedy isÂ of the same age asÂ Mr. Ahern. She isÂ no longer aÂ journalist atÂ The Irish Times. InÂ August 2012 she was appointed the associate professor ofÂ journalism atÂ the University ofÂ Limerick. She received the total ofÂ five honorary doctorates from Irish universities.\n\nMr. Alan Mahon isÂ also 68.Â After four years inÂ the post ofÂ aÂ judge atÂ the court ofÂ appeal, the Irish government nominated him for the position ofÂ the ombudsman ofÂ the defense forces inÂ 2018. HeÂ assumed the position onÂ 6Â July 2018 for the period ofÂ three years.\n\nAnd the Irish community? All ofÂ us would probably agree that the period ofÂ the Celtic tiger isÂ past history.\n\nIÂ have tried toÂ tell you aÂ story which, inÂ my view, deserves aÂ significant place inÂ law textbooks asÂ well asÂ textbooks onÂ journalism. The questions itÂ evokes, the lessons weÂ can learn, may beÂ more important than the verdicts and decisions IÂ mentioned and inÂ one ofÂ which IÂ was involved.\n\nThank you very much for the attention you paid toÂ this story."
