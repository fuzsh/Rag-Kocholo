        "meta_description": "The G20 and COP-27 summits have been overshadowed as Russia’s assault against Ukraine results in the first casualty on the soil of a NATO member after rocket or air defence missile debris kills two people in a Polish town bordering Ukraine. According to Wojciech Przybylski’s foresight, more collateral damage on the side of NATO can be expected as Moscow raises the stakes due to its faltering objectives on the battlefield. To read in more detail, see Przybylski’s piece here.\nOur special guest this week is Zsuzsanna Szelényi, former Hungarian parliamentarian and the author of “Tainted Democracy, Viktor Orban and the Subversion of Hungary”. As a former Fidesz insider and then founder of an opposition party, Szelényi provides a concise yet captivating account of how the consensual set of rules between the Hungarian public and government has been undermined since the landslide victory of the ruling party in 2010. Hungary’s recent anti-corruption reforms —  half-hearted at best — are unlikely to undercut systemic corruption. If a post-Orbán point in Hungary’s history can be imagined, restoring the integrity of democratic institutions and sustainable economic growth would be vital first steps for democratic security.",

Who is Péter Magyar and why does he generate massive interest today? And is it bad or good news for the opposition?\n\nWojciech Przybylski interviews Bálint Ruff, a political strategist and a host of Vétó show on Partizán YouTube channel\n\nRecommended reading: https://visegradinsight.eu/new-political-geometry-boosts-europes-defence/\n\nAdam Jasser speaks with Paul Taylor, a freelance columnist for The Guardian and veteran Brussels think-tanker and journalist, about last week's EU summit. Key topics included the ongoing farmers' protests, as well as discussions on the prioritisation of defence matters on the agenda as leaders deliberated on how the EU could bolster its own industry while promptly extending aid to Ukraine.\n\nWojciech Przybylski and Adam Jasser discuss President Duda and PM Tusk's US tour to celebrate 25 years of NATO enlargement. It is the first co-habitation trip, showing a sense of unity is possible even in the polarised Polish political environment, which can be inspirational for the domestic disagreements between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. This is all occurring as Poland starts to conceive having NATO nuclear deterrents on their soil.\n\nRead https://visegradinsight.eu/is-poland-mulling-its-own-nuclear-deterrent/\n\nIn today's episode, Galan Dall and Adam Jasser discuss reasons behind Hungary's surprising defeat at the EU summit over Ukraine funding, as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán seems to have finally lost all allies over his pro-Russian stance. Visegrad Insight editors also look at the broader implications of revelations that a Latvian member of the European Parliament is accused of being a long-standing Russian intelligence asset.\n\nWe discuss the outcomes of the historical EU summit, which decided to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. Hungarian leader Viktor Orban dropped his threat to block the decision, mainly because a change of government in Poland left him isolated in the EU. Check more info on future EU values agenda at our foresight project page: https://visegradinsight.eu/eu-values-foresight/\n\nEditors Galan Dall and Adam Jasser discuss the complexity behind Poland's delayed transition of power after the 15 October elections as well as the potential pathways forward for the new Polish government in obtaining the deeply sought-after transition funds.\n\nThen, Wojciech Przybylski discusses the role civic education can play in Europe with Caroline Hornstein Tomic, co-founder of THE CIVICS Innovation Hub. With the malign influence of growing revisionist powers increasing every year, it is the state of civic education which will determine the resilience of our societies.\n\nLink to Networking European Civic Education - https://nece.eu/nece-festival/programme-2023/\n\nLink to EU Values Foresight - https://visegradinsight.eu/eu-values-foresight/\n\nEuropean Parliament elections and the haggling between EU political groups and governments over the leadership and priorities for the next four-year term will likely overshadow Hungary's EU presidency in the second half of 2024. This will reduce Budapest's impact on actual policy decisions.\n\nThis podcast is part of our #EUvalues foresight which outlines four possible foresight-driven scenarios for EU strategic policy.
