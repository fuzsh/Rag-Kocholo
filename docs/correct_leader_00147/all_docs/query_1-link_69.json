        "text": "6\n\nCzech Republic\n\nState Cooptation of Reforms and Marginal Compliance\n\nThe government of the Czech Republic officially applied for EU membership in 1996 and received candidate status at the Luxembourg Summit in December 1997. Accession negotiations started in 1998 and were concluded in 2002. The Czech Republic became a member of the European Union in May 2004, following years of accession monitoring, structural adjustments and reforms.\n\nGender equality and equal treatment never featured high on the agenda of either the Czech public or the government. The Czech Republic did not experience the same type of heated public debates around reproductive rights and the role of women and men in society as we have seen in Poland. Marked by low awareness of the issues, the public perception of gender equality in the Czech Republic rested on a common belief that Czech society had already achieved high levels of gender equality; dating from the communist era, women already had access to education, to the labor market, and to social benefits. Many believed that gender equality was a communist legacy and a potentially dangerous and useless policy in the context of a free market economy. President Vačlav Klaus, for instance, called gender equality policies “a freedom impeding form of political correctness” (cited in Weiner 2010). Other right-wing politicians including two recent prime ministers, Mirek Topolánek and Petr Nečas, shared these views as well. Left-wing politicians of social democratic and communist ideologies are more supportive of women’s rights and, in general, recognize the value of gender equality in the labor market.1 However, their understanding of gender equality is different from the one espoused by liberal women’s groups and from the EU’s conceptualization of gender equality as an individual right. Instead, they embrace a statist approach to guaranteeing gender equality by extending state protectionism to a vulnerable group, in this case women, as was once practiced under the communist state. But even for left-wing politicians, gender equality in the labor market and in social security calculations did not constitute an urgent policy priority.\n\nTwo factors drove the reforms on gender equality in the Czech Republic: the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing and accession to the European Union. Policy and institutional reforms were initiated as part of government preparation of reports for the UN Division for the Advancement of Women. Major changes to the Czech Labor Act occurred under conditional pressures from European Union. In response to the EC criticism of Czech equality institutions, the Czech government established an inter-governmental advisory body on gender equality; however, none of Czech equality institutions developed substantial policymaking and enforcement capacity and were largely ignored by mainstream bureaucracy. Following the accession, the Czech government maintained the existing institutions and policies on gender equality. Czech equality institutions remained marginalized in the bureaucratic hierarchy of the government.\n\nOne of the major reasons for this marginalization is the structural weaknesses of women’s groups and their inability to create working relationships and ties with Czech political parties. This weakness allowed the Czech government to sideline women’s NGOs during the accession process, excluding them from key policy decisions and, consequently, co-opting the reforms. State cooptation of legislative and institutional adjustment in the area of gender equality during the EU accession negotiation process resulted in low compliance with EU accession requirements, fragmented legislation, weak and incoherent institutions, and the delayed adoption of a generic anti-discrimination act.\n\nBelow, I discuss the process of policy and institutional transformation in the Czech Republic in detail. But first, I briefly review the Czech political environment concentrating on the key aspects that determined the course of reforms—party politics and women’s NGOs. This discussion will create the context for understanding the debates on gender equality and the role of women in Czech political institutions; it will review the structure and relations between various women’s groups and their ties with political parties; and finally, it will reveal their effect on gender equality reforms. The chapter will begin with a brief discussion of Czech post-communist transition and governmental changes since 1995.\n\nTransition from Communism\n\nCzechoslovakia started a broad process of changes designed to re-institute democracy, recreate a market economy, and reclaim the nation’s rightful place in Europe following the collapse of the communist regime in November 1989. Mass demonstrations in Prague and Bratislava, also known as the “Velvet Revolution,” were preceded by twenty years of stagnation and low civil activity. Czechoslovakia had been a “model satellite state” received after the notorious Soviet suppression of reforms aimed to create “Socialism with a Human Face” in the summer of 1968 (Wolchik 2011). But the fall of the Berlin Wall and regime changes in Hungary and Poland encouraged underground opposition movements, including Charter 77 in Prague and Public against Violence in Bratislava. Within twenty-one days mass demonstrations and protests brought the rigid and repressive communist system down. The opposition leader and former dissident playwright Vačlav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia, symbolizing the victory of the Velvet Revolution. Parliamentary elections in 1992 brought new leaders to Slovak and Czech parliaments. Soon it became apparent that the perspectives and ambitions of political leaders in the Czech Lands and Slovakia differed dramatically, and they were not able to find a compromise on many critical issues, including the painful question of Slovak autonomy. The Velvet Divorce took place in January 1993, splitting the federal state into the two independent states of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. After that, these two states followed different paths until 1998, when the quasi-authoritarian government of Vladimir Mečiar was voted out and Slovakia took a resolute path toward liberalization and democratization.\n\nSince the early 1990s the Czech Republic had to address the same challenges as many other post-communist states in the region: political restructuring, economic transformation, and deteriorating social conditions. The Czech Constitution of 1993 established the Czech Republic as a parliamentary democracy and a unitary state where the supreme legislative authority is vested within the Parliament and the supreme executive power is given to a government led by the Prime Minister. The President is the formal Head of State with powers to approve the decisions of the government. The first Czech parliamentary elections of 1993 brought anti-communist, pro-market, reform-oriented parties to power, forming a right-wing government under the leadership of Prime Minister Vačlav Klaus (the Civic Democratic Party, OSD) (Mansfeldová 2004).\n\nFollowing heated debates about the route of economic restructuring, the government pursued gradual economic reforms and liberalization in order to avoid the shocks of dramatic economic restructuring. Until 1996 the Czech Republic was believed to be the most successful transition economy in Eastern and Central Europe. Its gradual reforms produced minimal negative effects, no hyperinflation and low unemployment rates (World Bank 1999). The situation, however, started to deteriorate in 1997, resulting in a three-year recession, uneven employment rates across the country, and growing budget imbalances. The economy crumbled, and the newly elected left-wing parties had to take measures to improve economic performance and high structural unemployment which was especially troubling in regions traditionally dominated by heavy industry, coal mining, and steel work (Vidovic 2002). The government placed the emphasis of economic reforms on changing the investment climate and attracting foreign direct investment. These measures proved to be successful in stimulating economic growth, diversifying the Czech industrial sector, lowering high unemployment rates, and making the Czech economy less vulnerable to internal and external economic shocks.\n\nFrom Right to Left: Czech Government, 1995–2010\n\nAfter the end of communism the one-party system was replaced by a plethora of political parties. The most prominent of these parties came together to form a protest movement, the Civic Forum. The Civic Forum was the foundation for a new post-communist government. After 1990 the number of new political parties that fielded candidates increased dramatically. However, few of these parties were able to seat their members in parliament. In the 1990 elections, thirteen parties competed and four gained access to parliament; in 1992, ten parties competed and six of them were successful in gaining seats in parliament. Furthermore, the number of Czech parties grew from one election to another: in 1996 the ratio of new parties to parties represented in parliament was 17:6; in 1998 the ratio was 13:5; in 2002 it was 17:4; in 2006 it was 26:5; and in 2010 it was 26:5 (Wolchik 2011, 198). This trend suggests that the Czech party system is still highly unstable and that newly formed or reincarnated parties contest the political space. Political commentators provided different analyses of party volatility in the Czech Republic. Some argued that, although party labels continued to change, emerging parties fell into the same clearly identifiable ideological spectrum of left- right divisions observable in most European polities (Kostelecký 2002). Others argued that party volatility is linked to fluid voter support and the general tendency of Czech voters to punish incumbent governments (Mansfeldová 2004). Table 6.1 illustrates this trend: it was quite unusual for Social Democrats to win elections twice in a row—in 1998 and again in 2002. In 2006 they lost to right-wing parties. Right-wing parties came to power again in 2010, albeit with a new coalition.\n\nWhile it is still debated whether a stable party system has become established or not in the Czech Republic, table 6.1 demonstrates that several parties have been able to gain seats in parliament since the early 1990s. (See also Table 6.2) The disintegration of the right-wing, anti-communist Civic Forum in 1991 gave rise to three political parties: the liberal-oriented Civic Movement (OH), the neoliberal-oriented Civic Democratic Party (ODS), and the conservative-neoliberal Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) (Mansfeldová 2004). The ODS is the most successful of these three right-wing parties. It gained seats in parliament in all elections since 1992 and was the dominant party in 1992 and 1996, forming the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Vačlav Klaus and again in the 2006 and 2010 elections. The Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) is the most successful left-wing party. Similarly to ODS, since 1992 it has always been represented in parliament. After a rough start in early elections, it finally received a majority of votes in the 1998 and 2002 elections. The inability to create a stable coalition, however, allowed the ČSSD to rule only as a minority government in 1998–2002 (with 94 votes in a 200-member parliament) resulting in the Opposition Agreement with ODS, which significantly decreased the ČSSD impact on policy formation. In the 2002 elections it managed to create a stable coalition with the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union-Democratic Union, a right-wing party focused on a liberal agenda. This was a peculiar alliance for Social Democrats, but it proved to be a functional governing strategy. Finally, the unreformed Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSBM) had enjoyed stable support from its electorate throughout all elections in the post-communist period, but it confined itself to opposition because it was unable to create alliances with other parties in parliament, including left-wing Social Democrats.\n\nGovernment stability is another problem that besets post-communist governments. The second government of Vačlav Klaus, a minority government with 99 out of 200 votes in parliament, had to resign in January 1998 to be replaced by a caretaker government of Josef Tošovský. The resignation of the Prime Minister Vladimir Špidla in 2004 shook the popularity of Social Democrats. The unpopular government of Stanislav Gross succeeded the government of Špidla, but he also resigned in 2005 and was replaced by the government of Jiří Paroubek. At that time a strong conservative right-wing turn all across Europe brought left-wing parties down, resulting in a right-wing coalition victory in the Czech elections of 2006.\n\nTable 6.1.

It is characterized by strong Euroskepticism, mostly associated with Vačlav Klaus (Prime Minister 1992–1998, President 2003–present) and two parties—a right-wing ODS and the non-reformed KSBM.2 Vačlav Klaus is the only Head of State in Europe who opposes the deepening of European integration. In April 2005 he started a campaign against the Constitutional Treaty of the EU, which created conflict with the European Parliament (Wiedermann 2008). In October 2009 Vačlav Klaus impeded the Czech ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by refusing to sign it without certain concessions from the European Union. He finally signed the Treaty on November 3, 2009, after the Constitutional Court rejected a challenge from the ODS. The Czech Republic was the last EU member state to sign the Treaty of Lisbon (Wolchik 2011). In recent years the ODS has softened its position toward the European Union and become more supportive of the EU integration processes. This led to the split between the ODS and its founding father and honorary chairman Vačlav Klaus, who left the party to form a new Euroskeptic party, the Party of Free Citizens, which unsuccessfully competed in the 2009 European Parliamentary elections.\n\nStrong Euroskepticism among Czech elites is also a sign of a widespread suspicion toward the European Union among the general public (Linden and Pohlman 2003). It is unclear whether the Czech Republic would have met EU accession requirements if right wing parties, most importantly the ODS, had dominated the parliament during the EU conditionality period. However, at the time of acquis transposition, pro-European parties led by Social Democrats dominated the parliament (1998–2006). Social Democrats were also responsive to EU and women’s NGO pressures to align Czech legislation with EU requirements on gender equality. Most of the changes to Czech laws on gender equality were introduced by amendments to the Labor Code and Administrative Act by 2002. The failure of leftist governments to adopt the Anti-Discrimination Act, however, resulted in its delayed adoption under enormous pressures from the European Union in 2009 when right-wing parties were in power.\n\nOverall, we observe a weak party system, typical for the post-communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. Parties do not enjoy strong public support and are characterized by low membership. Even such broad-based parties with historically large organizational bases, such as the non-reformed Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, KSBM, and the Christian Democratic parties (KDU-ČSL and KDU), have relatively small membership, are poorly staffed, and have a fragmented regional base. Levels of party identification among voters also remain very low. Many citizens in post-communist states are skeptical that political parties and their leaders are genuine. Rather they see political parties as vehicles for competition between politicians driven by goals of personal advancement and personal benefits. These trends in public perception reflect the legacies of the communist period and the negative experiences from parties’ inability to live up to their electoral promises and politicians’ involvement in scandalous corruption during the post-communist era.\n\nDivided Terrain: Fragmented Women’s Movement\n\nPolitical liberalization in 1989 inspired the creation of various civic and political initiatives, groups, and organizations all across the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. According to Potůček, approximately 20,000 civic organizations appeared by 1992 in the Czech Lands (1997). About 70 women’s organizations appeared in the early 1990s (Čermáková, Hašková, Křižková, Linková, Mařiková and Musilová 2000). As in many other CEE states, women’s participation in formal politics declined precipitously following the collapse of the communist system, with women gaining only 10 percent of the seats in the lower chamber of the Czechoslovak Parliament (Saxonberg 2003). Excluded from formal political institutions, women took an active part in civic organizing, starting and joining non-governmental organizations. These new women’s organizations addressed multiple issues neglected by the state, such as social care, health care, unemployment, domestic abuse, and human/sex trafficking. Many of the first women’s NGOs represented professional associations, networks for the political empowerment of women, branches of international organizations, and groups connected to other formal organizations, such as political parties, churches, civic movements, academia, and trade unions (Čermáková et al. 2000). The focus of their interest included various spheres: training, employment, advancement of women in the labor market, political participation and empowerment of female candidates, violence against women and trafficking in women, health, social care for children, elderly and disabled individuals, single mothers, minority women (most visibly the Roma), sexual minority, awareness about women’s rights, gender equality, gender sensitivity, and gender discrimination (Hašková and Křižková 2003; Sloat 2004a). There was a clear division among these new organizations into two categories: service-oriented groups, concerned with providing social services and support to vulnerable population groups, and advocacy groups, involved in education, training, lobbying, and awareness-raising about women’s rights and women’s rights violations in various spheres of public and private life. These organizations drew on various sources for support, but mostly relied on international donors and foundations. Funding from the local and national governments in the early 1990s was insignificant. Lack of charity and civic engagement in the post-communist region, coupled with significant financial struggles of the general population, resulted in the NGOs’ reliance upon international donors, rather than on community-based support. Competition for funding and the lack of a strong umbrella organization that could unite multiple women’s groups, produced fragmented activity within these organizations (Hašková and Křižková 2008; Röder 2009).\n\nSome Czech women’s activists recognized the disjointed character of multiple organizations and attempted to unite them through regional cooperation. Several Czech women’s organizations joined the Network of East-West Women, a regional alliance and advocacy organization that supported women’s NGOs in the post-communist region. In 1997 several Czech NGOs co-created the Karat Coalition, a regional umbrella organization and advocacy group for teaching lobbying strategies to women’s NGOs in order to advance the adoption and enactment of gender equality in post-communist EU Enlargement states (Hašková and Křižková 2008). Other organizations established contacts with the European Women’s Lobby (EWL), although Czech NGOs became eligible for joining the EWL only in 2002.\n\nWhile all these efforts were remarkable and did initiate cooperation among different women’s groups, the structural and ideological differences between Czech NGOs impeded greater integration and mobilization of women’s organizations, particularly in the area of gender equality and gender discrimination. In the Czech Republic, women’s advocacy groups focused on gender equality are divided into two camps: old communistera organizations, including the largest (the Czech Women’s Union), and new organizations affiliated with academia and academic research (Hašková and Kořálová 2003). These two sets of organizations are distinct in their voice and position on gender equality, they draw upon different financial resources, and they also align themselves with the government in different ways. The Czech Women’s Union (ČSŽ) was officially founded in 1990 after the Velvet Revolution, but it was created on the foundation of the communist mass women’s organization established in 1967. It enjoys the largest membership among all women’s NGOs, claiming some 20,000 members across all regions of the Czech Republic, and it maintains a network of some 1,600 local offices (Hajna 2005). The ČSŽ was the largest and the only legitimate women’s organization during the communist era due to the fact that it enjoyed large state support and high status. After its reincarnation as a civic organization in 1990, the ČSŽ lost most of its state-provided funding but became eligible for competitive state funding for specific programs. The ČSŽ’s large presence in the regions, its connections with the government, and its structural strengths, provided a clear advantage over other new and smaller organizations when competing both for state and foreign funding. The ČSŽ is also a successful fundraiser, having obtained the largest grant ever given to a Czech women’s NGO in 2003 (Linková 2005). About half of the government members of the Council for Equal Opportunities of the Czech Republic, a consultative body between the Czech government and Czech NGOs, are members of the ČSŽ, which allows this organization to enjoy insider access to some government officials, which other organizations do not have (Forest 2007).\n\nNew women’s organizations were established in the early 1990s. The Center for Gender Studies and Pro-fem are the largest of these organizations. The Center for Gender Studies focused on education and public awareness campaigns about gender equality and gender discrimination, while Pro-fem provided training and legal consultations for women victims of domestic violence. In 1997, both organizations were recognized by Czech governments and received the title of advocacy and lobbying organizations eligible for public support. The Center for Gender Studies was founded by the sociologist, Jirina Šiklová, an active promoter of feminist ideas and founder of the Gender Studies program at Charles University (opened in 1998 in the Department of Social Work). The goal of the program was to train social workers and public servants in a gender sensitive program and to assist victims of gender discrimination. The foreign funding and local supporters allowed the Center to open a gender studies library and create connections with research centers at Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences. Together with these research centers, Pro-Fem and the Center for Gender Studies took an active part in analyzing the impact of socioeconomic reforms on men and women in the Czech Republic as well as other CEE states. They provided evaluations of existing laws and institutions and issued reports on Czech compliance with EU requirements on gender equality. These organizations were successful at securing international funding, especially through the EU PHARE program (Forest 2007).\n\nThe two camps of women’s organizations, the ČSŽ and the new women’s groups, are not connected by a single umbrella organization, which could help generate an activist agenda for cooperative action.3 Each branch has its own agenda and its own voice. Moreover, activists in these organizations are mistrustful of each other; suspicion creates room for competition between the branches and leaves very little opportunity for strategic, collective action. Ideological differences are one of the reasons for mutual distrust between Czech women’s organizations. Some activists believe that they have different understandings of the principles of equality. For instance, NGOs affiliated with the Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences embrace equality principles as being individual rights that must be exercised in a free market economy. The old communist-time organizations understand social protectionism and state paternalism as guarantors of equality. Others say that this is a conflict between two generations: old-timers and new political leaders.4\n\nUnderstanding these differences among multiple women’s NGOs, EU funding encouraged greater partnership and collaboration between the groups by attaching “cooperation of multiple women’s groups” as a requirement for project funding. One such multi-year project, sponsored by PHARE, was coordinated by the ČSŽ on work and life balance. As a winner of the grant, the ČSŽ was required to contract with a large number of partner organizations across the country. The partner NGOs that worked on this project included such diverse groups as advocacy and academic organizations, service providing NGOs, trade unions, business organizations, and state institutions. This project created an opportunity for cooperation between different organizations that were sometimes resentful of each other. However, while praising these efforts and goals toward encouraging greater partnership, some experts remained skeptical about the ability of such temporary projects to create a solid foundation for cooperation in the future (Linková 2005). Others expressed concerns that, if such cooperative projects fail to foster mutual understanding between different groups, it could inadvertently instill implicit hierarchies in relations between NGOs (Hašková and Křižková 2008).\n\nIn comparison to Polish NGOs, which achieved higher levels of strategic cooperation, fragmentation of women’s groups in the Czech Republic was exacerbated by several factors. First, there was an absence of a salient politically charged issue, like the struggle for reproductive rights in Poland in the early 1990s, that could focus the energies of the disparate groups on a single concern. In Poland, political contestation of highly restrictive abortion laws provided a fertile ground for uniting the efforts of many pro-choice, liberal women’s organizations and fostered strategic cooperation, collective action, and trust between them, even when they disagreed on other issues. Liberal pro-gender equality organizations in the Czech Republic did not have such a contested issue which could foster their strategic cooperation. Thus, they did not have an opportunity to overcome suspicion and distrust toward each other. Second, this organizational weakness to act as a collective front allowed the Czech state to assume that they are dealing with weak organizations, and they could easily forgo the demands of women’s groups to be included in policy process. Moreover, the differentiated access to state bodies by women’s NGOs discussed above encouraged further fragmentation of women’s groups. As in many other countries, the Czech women’s organizations are close to the political left, but due to their organizational weaknesses, they did not persuade the Social Democratic government (1998 to 2006) to strengthen policy and institutional reforms. In the next section I will discuss the relations between the state and women’s NGOs in greater detail and analyze their consequences for policy and institutional reform.\n\nMissed Opportunities: Policy Reforms on Gender Equality\n\nAs in many other post-communist states, legal recognition of gender equality was instituted in the Czech Constitution. Article 3 of the Constitution guaranteed equality of women and men before the Czech law. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of 1993 provided that men and women have equal rights and guaranteed these rights as inherent, inalienable, unlimited, and un-appealable. The Czech Labor Code of 1965 also recognized gender equality in the labor market as a binding principle for labor regulation. None of these documents, however, went beyond formal recognition of equality principles. They did not provide clear definitions for what were and were not violations of gender equality or discrimination, and they provided no avenues for redress when these rights were breached. But the Czech Constitution recognized the binding character of ratified international treaties on human rights and established these international treaties as superior to the Czech laws (Maksová-Tominová 2003). The legal obligations of ratified international treaties created avenues for reforming domestic laws in accordance with international requirements. Czech obligations toward the CEDAW (signed and ratified in 1982) and the ratification of the Beijing Declaration in 1995 required the state to submit their first periodic report to CEDAW in 1994 and a second follow-up report in 1999. In the second report to CEDAW, the government had to address recommendations received in 1998 from the UN Commission on the Status of Women and enlist changes achieved since the initial report (1995 to 1999). The strongest criticism of the first periodic report concerned a tendency to “conceive women as mothers and within the context of the family, rather than as individuals and independent actors in the public sphere” (cited in Maksová-Tominová 2003). The Commission expressed concern about the flawed interpretations of gender equality, gender roles, and gender discrimination, and it urged the Czech government to undertake fundamental, legal reforms to define these terms more clearly and to provide guarantees of gender equality. The reforms of Czech laws to address all international requirements on gender equality were further influenced by the Czech Republic’s application to the European Union and the initiation of accession monitoring in 1998. Czech experts agree that major legislative reforms on gender equality laws occurred under international pressures from the European Union and the UN (Hašková and Kořálová 2003; Hašková and Křižková 2008; Havelková 2006; Maksová-Tominová 2003; Röder 2007). In 1998 the Czech government adopted the National Action Plan “Priorities and Procedures of the Government for the Enforcement of the Equality between Men and Women.” This document analyzed Czech policies in seven areas outlined in the Questionnaire to Governments on Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action published by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). The “Summary Report on the Fulfillment of the Government Priorities and Procedures for the Enforcement of Equality between Men and Women” was then distributed to all ministries and NGOs for comments and suggestions (Pavlik 2004). After 2001 all ministries were required to develop their own Action Plans to ensure gender equality in their institutions. Under the conservative government that took office in 2006, however, the deadline for developing the Priorities was postponed (Röder 2007).\n\nMajor changes to Czech laws took place on January 2001 with the amendments to the 1965 Labor Code. The “Harmonization Amendment of 2001” included definitions for direct and indirect discrimination, defined some principles of equality in access to employment, training, and promotion, prohibited gender-specific job advertising, and harmonized the provisions of parental leave with EU directives. In addition, the 2001 amendments to the Act on Civil Procedures align Czech legislation with EU requirements on establishing the burden of proof in cases of gender-based discrimination. The amended Wages Act and the Salary and Bonus Act explicitly defined the principles of equal pay. In 2004 additional amendments were introduced to the Czech Labor Code, the State Service Act, and the Military Act; and a new Employment Act was adopted. The 2004 amendments of the Labor Code provided more detailed definitions of direct and indirect discrimination and sexual harassment while also outlining the terms for exemptions and specifying the procedures for addressing sexual discrimination (Wiedermann 2008). The new Employment Act outlined the procedures for equal access to employment and strengthened the overall application of the EU Directive on Employment Equality. In addition, several other acts were changed to include gender equality principles: the Act of Service in State Administration (2002), the Act on Service in Security Forces (2003), and the School Act (2004). While many of the important legal acts were changed to transpose EU requirements on gender equality, the Commission and independent analysts considered these changes insufficient (Pavlik 2004). The Czech laws on gender equality appeared to have no single, binding anti-discrimination act. Thus, in 2007 the Czech Republic was in violation of nine out of ten EU Directives on gender equality (Röder 2007). Among major concerns are the inconsistencies of Czech equal treatment laws, insufficient provisions for finding redress in cases of discrimination, and prohibition of certain jobs for women, including mining and underground work. These laws violate the Equal Treatment Directive, provide insufficient definitions of sexual orientation and sexual identity, maintain inequality in social security calculations, and do not challenge the weakness of Czech gender equality institutions.5\n\nThe process of EU accession and the monitoring of Czech compliance with EU requirements coincided with a ruling left-wing government coalition (1998–2006). The left-wing government proved to be responsive to international pressures on gender equality, with the Czech government pursuing adoption of key legislative changes such as amendments to the Czech Labor Code (2001). The Czech reforms, however, exemplify a clear top-down initiative with no impact from non-governmental organizations. Although NGOs continued to lobby the government with their recommendations, their input was rather symbolic: all proposals by NGOs to elevate the status and functions of the equality institutions in the Czech Republic remained ignored (Pavlik 2004). Under pressures from the European Union, the government opened a body for state-NGO consultations in 2002, the Government Council for Equal Opportunities. It is an inter-ministerial consultative and advisory body with a mandate to promote EU policies on gender equality and equal treatment. But the Council was established after major changes to Czech legislation took place and NGO representatives did not have a chance to submit their comments and recommendations on the 2002 amendments.6\n\nMarginalization of independent advisors in the process of negotiations and legislative reforms allowed the Czech government to pursue minor policy and institutional changes. Their main argument was that the principles of gender equality in labor relations and in the Czech social protection system are already satisfied (Drapal 2005). Many politicians believed that the Czech social protection laws inherited from the communist state already included strong protective measures for working women and only minor adjustment was required to satisfy the EU Directives. These attitudes not only stalled major amendments to existing laws, but also precluded the adoption of Anti-Discrimination Laws. The commentators on Czech reforms note that the transposition of EU laws in some areas of policy was an uncontroversial process (amendments to Labor Code and other acts) while in others it sparked political debates and opposition (Anti-Discrimination Law) (Havelková 2010; Hašková and Křižková 2008; Wiedermann 2008). The proponents of reforms reaffirmed to the supremacy of EU law and argued that the Czech Republic’s chances for successful accession were being jeopardized by noncompliance. As a result, Vladimir Špidla, then a Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, often argued that EU provisions on gender equality had to be transposed exactly as they appeared in EU Directives (“copy and paste” method) (Wiedermann 2008), which could have resulted in the “mechanistic” transposition of these requirements into Czech laws (Hašková and Křižková 2008).\n\nAnti-Discrimination Act 2008\n\nGeneral anti-discrimination clauses are articulated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Czech Republic, adopted in 1993. In particular, Article 3 of the Charter guarantees equality in access to fundamental rights and freedoms, explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, color, ethnicity, language, religion, political views, national origin, property, and other status. It does not include provisions or definitions for sexual identity and sexual orientation, referring to all other forms of discrimination as “other status” (Röder 2007). Moreover, only the Constitutional Court can interpret and apply the Charter to specific cases of discrimination, which makes the process of redress very cumbersome and unattainable in most cases. Ingrid Röder states that in 2005, for the first time, the Constitutional Court delivered a judicial decision in a case of discrimination (2007). To respond to this shortcoming and address international requirements on umbrella, anti-discrimination law, the Czech government initiated the preparation of an Anti-Discrimination legislation in 2000. With some input from human rights NGOs, the Czech government’s Commission on Human Rights prepared the first draft of the law. The bill refers explicitly to the EU requirement: “Pursuant to the law of the European Communities, this Act regulates the right to equal treatment in the following matters.…” The footnote enumerates all relevant EU Directives (Wiedermann 2008, 43). Section 1 of the Act provided the scope of the application. Section 2 and 3 provided definitions to all terms in accordance with European Directives and the case law of the European Court of Justice. Section 5 identified some of the most typical exemptions from the principle of equal treatment. Part II of the draft provided measure of protection in cases of discrimination, focusing primarily on legal action in civil courts. Overall, the Act would have provided more comprehensive protection against discrimination than the multiple amendments to existing laws and acts passed in the early 2000s (Wiedermann 2008).\n\nHowever, the Anti-Discrimination Act did not find strong support among parliamentarians. The Parliament reviewed the first draft of the Act in 2004 and was approved by the Lower Chamber. Social democrats, holding a majority of seats, generally supported the draft in its existing form. But their coalition partners, the Christian Democrats, the KDU-CSL, rejected the draft, arguing that no adjustments to existing laws are necessary because the new amendments to standing laws aptly satisfied all EU requirements. The neoliberal ODS party also largely opposed the bill on the grounds that the Act could distort the employer-employee relations. In addition, they argued that the major anti-discrimination clauses were already addressed by the recent amendments. The draft was sent for further review. In 2005 the government prepared a second version of the Act and it was finally heard in parliament in 2006. The amended Act passed three readings in the Chamber of Deputies, was approved and forwarded to the Senate. The Senate rejected the Act, sending it back to the Chamber of Deputies for further work. At this point, the Act failed to gain the majority vote in the Chamber of Deputies and ultimately was rejected.\n\nThe new right-wing government that came to power in 2006 showed little support for the Anti-Discrimination Act; moreover, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, a well-known skeptic of gender equality and other forms of affirmative action, openly criticized the European Union for imposing such legislation on member states.7 But political opportunity opened up for proponents of the Anti-Discrimination Act. In June 2007 the Czech Republic hosted an opening ceremony for the European Year of Equal Opportunities. EU pressure, as well as the pressure from multiple human rights and women’s rights NGOs, increased. To avoid confrontation, the government of Mirek Topolánek made unprecedented concessions. First, it approved “The National Strategy of the Czech Republic for the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007)—Towards a Just Society and Priorities of the European Year.” Second, the government approved the Anti-Discrimination Act in June 2007—a draft that was defeated just a year earlier. The Parliament approved the Act in 2008. Finally, it created the new position of the Minister of Human Rights and Ethnic Minorities (although without a portfolio) within the structure of the Cabinet. While this position did not focus specifically on gender equality, its mandate contained gender-based discrimination as one of its responsibilities (Králiková 2007). While most experts recognize these changes as mere window dressing for the EU event (e.g., the position of the Minister of Human Rights was to be dismantled shortly after the new government took over8), the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act was a clear achievement.9 Another favorable factor that aided in the re-introduction of the Anti-Discrimination Act to the parliament in 2007 was the fact that the Green Party supported the bill. The Green Party was part of the ODS coalition from 2006 to 2010. It is a small party that has existed since 1990 but was able to gain seats in Parliament only in the 2006 elections. It campaigned on the platform of human rights and saw the reintroduction of the Anti-Discrimination Act as one of its policy priorities.\n\nThe saga of the Anti-Discrimination Act did not end when the government and parliament approved the bill in 2008. President Vačlav Klaus vetoed the Act in May 2008. He stated that the Czech Republic had already addressed all issues discussed in the bill in individual amendments to various acts and the Labor Code and also derided that Act as being poor in quality. The next parliamentary meeting that addressed the rejected bill was held in October 2008. MPs largely agreed that they must pass the bill in order to address the EU requirement and to meet the deadline (2008) set by the European Commission. Financial repercussions and unnecessary embarrassment were the main arguments in support of the bill. The Act was supported by a majority of the ODS MPs, traditionally opposing any forms of affirmative action. This caused a split between President Vačlav Klaus and the ODS leadership, resulting in Klaus’s resignation from the party he helped found in the early 1990s. A convinced Euroskeptic, Vačlav Klaus established another party with a strong, anti-EU integration focus. However, his party failed to gain enough support to take any seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections.\n\nCzech Institutions on Gender Equality\n\nCzech institutions for gender equality were created shortly after the Beijing conference. The Czech government had to submit its response to the Questionnaire to Governments on Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action to the UN Division for the Advancement of Women. In April 1997, an MP from the Czech Social Democratic Party, Hana Orgoniková, sent a request to Prime Minister Vačlav Klaus to report on government activities with regard to the National Report on the implementation of the Beijing Platform of Action, which was due in 1998. In response to her request, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs was given the responsibility of coordinating the policy area concerning women in society. The UN requirement to create a women’s policy machinery mirrored the EU’s accession requirement of establishing a government office on gender equality policies. To respond to these international requirements, the government adopted Resolution #8/98 and charged the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs with the task of establishing such an office. In the end, the Unit for Equality between Men and Women was created at the lowest organizational level; it is part of the Department for Integration to the European Union within the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Maksová-Tominová 2003; Linková 2005; Watson and Vörös 2005). The very status of the unit suggests that it has been established in order to satisfy the EU conditional requirement for accession, not to promote gender equality principles. Even today, the state provides only limited personnel and financial resources to the office, thus impeding the task of implementation of gender policies. The unit has five employees; two of these employees are IT managers whose task is to provide the IT support to the whole department. The three other employees are charged with the task of coordinating issues related to equal opportunities between women and men across the ministries. Originally, the unit was designed to align Czech legislation with EU requirements on gender equality. But being so poorly staffed, the unit had a small impact on policy development. Today the unit’s agenda includes legislative functions, development and dissemination of information related to gender equality and equal opportunity, organization of training seminars for civil servants, and subcontracting public opinion surveys regarding gender equality. Its largest responsibility, however, is preparing the Government Priorities and writing Reports on Government Priorities. In pursuing this task, the unit cooperates with other ministries, developing tasks and measures in order to improve their compliance with those Government Priorities. The unit does not have the power to enforce any laws and must rely on the good will of the ministries and other government administration offices to comply with its recommendations (Zhiriková 2005). In Zhiriková’s words, “the unit functions as a secretariat for coordinating government work on gender equality” (2005).\n\nIn 2002 the Commission of the European Communities reprimanded the Czech government for disregarding the EC’s requirements to develop “effective implementation and enforcement measures” (2002, 19). In response to this criticism, the government created the Government Council for Equal Opportunities (2002) to coordinate and shape Czech gender equality policies. This is a consultative advisory body with a mandate to promote EU gender equality policies. The Council includes about forty members, many of whom are ministers, top governmental officials, representatives from women’s NGOs, and academics. The Council can develop policy recommendations, but cannot make binding decisions; it does not have an independent budget, or the capacity to legislate or enforce those decisions. It is the only government institution that allows cooperation and input from women’s NGOs. But the NGO recommendations do not have a binding force on further government decisions. Overall, experts note the limited capacity of the Government Council to influence policy. They also remark that government officials show low interest in participating in the Council. The Council convenes two or three times a year. It is common for top government officials to send their low-ranking substitutes to the council meetings. Many regional representatives ignore the meetings altogether. All of this results in a highly inefficient and poor institution with a marginal impact on policy development. By 2005, the government has accepted only one recommendation made by the Council—to publish a methodology on gender budgeting, which was prepared by the Ministry of Finance (Niklová 2005). Other issues discussed by the Council, such as amendments to the existing Penal Code in support of the victims of domestic violence, were not signed into the Law.\n\nTo assist in greater coordination in the area of gender mainstreaming in state institutions, Vladimir Špidla, then Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and now the EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, and Equal Opportunities, proposed to create Gender Focal Points and enforce twinning projects (exchanges with Western counterparts) at the ministry level. Pursuant to Government Resolution #456 from May 9, 2001, the Gender Focal Points were established in all ministries in 2002. These positions are part time with responsibilities shared between gender equality coordination and advancement within the ministry, as well as other duties. The ministries had to make a decision about the status of this position. In most ministries, the position was created in the Department of Human Resources at the secretariat level. The most important task of this position is to develop a program for gender mainstreaming within each ministry. The quality and the prominence of the Gender Focal Points varies dramatically across the ministries. Since their establishment, this position at the ministry-level was one of the most notable ones, as it was charged with a task of developing a program on Gender Budgeting (Niklová 2005). Overall, Gender Focal Points are believed to have marginal effect on policy development (Pavlik 2004).\n\nThe Position of the Public Defender of Human Rights, the Ombudsman, was established in 1999. Originally, the main responsibilities of this position included analysis and review of cases of administrative mismanagement by authorities. The Ombudsman did not hold specific responsibilities to address issues on gender discrimination. Since the approval of Anti-Discrimination Act in 2007, the responsibilities of the Ombudsman offices have expanded to include all cases of discrimination, including gender-based violations. The position of the Minister on Human Rights, Minorities and Equal Opportunities, established in 2007, received a mandate to monitor and address cases of violations of the Anti-Discrimination Act, and propose programs to combat discrimination. The mandate, however, was largely restricted to cases of ethnic minorities. The position was abolished in 2010.\n\nTo sum up, the Czech institutions created to oversee the implementation of gender equality principles have critically limited functions; none of them have the power to assign tasks, issue binding recommendations, or effectively inspect other government bodies (Haškova 2005). None of them have the competence to independently assist victims of discrimination as it is required by Article 8a of Council Directive 2002/73/EC.\n\nInternational Pressures and Czech Compliance\n\nCzech reforms in the area of gender equality took place in response to coercive and noncoercive international pressures. The UN Conference on Women in Beijing (1995) and the responsibility of the Czech government to submit periodic reports to the UN Division for the Advancement of Women were the main reasons why the Czech government established the first office on women’s affairs, the Unit for Equality between Men and Women. The main responsibility of this office was to prepare and draft responses to international organizations as regards to gender equality in the country. The status, agenda, and responsibilities of this office have not changed since then. Political conditionality during the EU accession did not create an opportunity for elevating the status of this office.\n\nIn the Czech case, EU conditionality on gender equality brought about some policy and institutional reforms. As part of accession obligations, the Czech government adjusted the state Labor Code and several other relevant acts, like the Wages Act and Salary and Bonus Act. However, accession conditionality could not trump the resistance to the adoption of a separate anti-discrimination law. In response to EC criticism of weak equality institutions, the Czech government established an inter-governmental council on equal opportunity, but it was an insignificant institution which was disregarded by its own members. Overall, I find that accession conditionality secured minimal policy reforms and created weak institutions on gender equality in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn the post-accession period, pressures to assimilate to other EU members prevented the dismantling of EU required policies and institutions. The status of policies and institutions on gender equality remained the same. But EU pressures to assimilate to group rules created an opportunity for the adoption of a generic anti-discrimination act despite some stern criticism and opposition from many government officials. Overall, the Czech case demonstrated how social and conditional pressures from international organizations generated symbolic formalistic compliance with international requirements and resulted in minimal reforms on gender equality.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs in other EU Enlargement countries, Czech reforms on gender equality and equal treatment of women and men were driven by the desire to accommodate international pressures. The early reform efforts were a response to UN requirements to act on the Beijing Platform of Action, and since 1998 the EU accession requirements dominated state discourse on the issue of gender equality. In contrast to the Polish case, we did not observe public confrontation surrounding the role of men and women in society. Both public and state officials believed that gender equality was not a critical issue for Czech society because equality between men and women was achieved during the communist era. The Czech Republic inherited the communist legacy of gender equality in the labor market with women enjoying access to education, employment, and promotion, and most believed that no further guarantees to improve the status of women in society were necessary. While these beliefs are based on false assumptions and poor awareness about gender discrimination, the NGOs failed to mobilize a significant portion of the public in support of gender equality policies and also failed to appeal to government officials with demands to advance policies and institutions on gender equality. All proponents of gender equality, both in the government and in the non-governmental sector, appealed to their opponents with arguments about gender equality being part of the EU conditional requirements for accession. Such arguments implied that the adoption of these laws should mimic the language of EU directives (“copy and paste”), rather than engage in debate about the value of gender equality principles for Czech society. Lack of constituency and public support for these policies contributed to formal transposition of gender equality policies into Czech laws and allowed the government to co-opt the reforms without much input from women’s NGOs.\n\nThe largest policy and institutional changes took place during accession conditionality and coincided with left-wing parties being in power. Left-wing parties are hypothesized to be more supportive of gender equality laws than right-wing parties, and we find support for this general finding in the case of Czech Republic. But despite the fact that top officials, e.g., Vladimir Špidla, Prime Minister 2002–2004, endorsed gender equality policies, they failed to pursue comprehensive legislative and institutional reforms. Leftist governments also failed to establish meaningful cooperation with Czech women’s NGOs, marginalizing them in the process of accession negotiations and disregarding their input on policy recommendations.\n\nKey political figures, who were supportive of gender equality, endorsed policy and institutional reforms, but they could not overcome general resistance to these policies from the Czech political establishment. Among the key politicians whose role in policy reforms was so indispensable are Vladimir Špidla, Prime Minister 2002–2004, Michaela Maksová-Tominová, an NGO activist, who joined the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and Anna Čurdová, who served as a Chairperson of the Council for Equal Opportunities for Men and Women. While the role of individual politicians was important, the pure number of women in parliament did not have an impact on policy enforcement. First of all, women took a very small number of seats in the Czech parliament during the studied period. Second, women voted along the party lines on the changes concerning gender equality (Drapal 2005). Female MPs from liberal and conservative parties tended to criticize gender equality guarantees, albeit for different reasons; parliamentarians representing social-democratic parties tended to support these changes.\n\nIn the post-conditionality period, we do not observe a dramatic dismantling of the policies and institutions that were created during the accession period. Moreover, the rightist governments that came to power after the EU accession continued, albeit with delay, the reforms on gender equality and their efforts resulted in the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act in 2008. We also observe that the right-wing government expanded institutional capacities by creating a position for Minister on Minority and Equal Opportunity, but failed to give her a portfolio. Even if this position was sustained for two years, its creation by a Prime Minister who notoriously opposed any type of affirmative action is indicative of a state response to international pressures, on one hand, and the influence of concerns regarding international reputation, on the other hand. Overall, we observe that in the case of the Czech Republic, EU conditionality encouraged a government-led reform on gender equality policies and institutions. Such cooptation of reforms resulted in delayed and marginal policy transposition of gender legislation, weak institutional reform, and formalistic conformity to EU requirements in the post-accession period."
