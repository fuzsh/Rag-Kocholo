        "text": "Cross-sector EWC seminar in Hamburg\n\nWorks council members from various economic sectors met from 4th to 9th November 2007 to exchange views on the negotiation of EWC agreements and the strategic development of their European works council. Run by the Institute for the further education of works councils (ifb) and co-shaped by the training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\" a dialogue across industries could be conducted in Hamburg. Works councils from companies in the pharmaceutical and electronics industries, food processing, water treatment, market research, wholesaling, the petroleum industry as well as software providers, banks and automotive suppliers were present. To meet the growing demand for such cross-industry EWC events, a completely new and expanded seminar series has been designed for the year 2008 (see report in EWC News 3/2007).\n\nAustrian holding company will start EWC negotiations\n\nNegotiations on the establishment of a European works council in the Frauenthal group will begin in January 2008. The group is run from Vienna and consists of eleven production facilities with approximately 3,000 employees in Austria, Germany, France, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Poland. The focus is in the manufacturing of components for commercial vehicles (springs, handlebars, catalysts) and in the plumbing and heating technology. With the help of the training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\" first key issues were discussed from 14th to 16th November 2007 in Kassel for the upcoming negotiations. An important point is the adequate representation of all businesses in the future EWC.\n\nEmployee participation in port logistics\n\nFrom 19th to 24th November 2007 the final conference of the LINKS project was held in the northern Italian port city of Livorno with technical support of the training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\". About 50 participants from seven countries discussed the establishment of European works councils in an industry that has significant growth rates and is undoubtedly one of the winners of globalization. A similar workshop was held in May 2007 in Constanţa on the Black Sea (see report in EWC News 2/2007). So far, there is only a single EWC in the whole container handling for the company Dubai Ports World (see report in EWC News 3/2007).\n\nLegal personality of European works councils\n\nOn 5th December 2007 the legal situation of British EWCs was discussed at the headquarters of the British TUC in London (photo). After a dispute in the ferry company P & O in 2002, whose backgrounds are currently being analyzed by the training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\", there were no more court proceedings of a European works council on British soil. The unresolved question of the legal status of EWCs and significant financial risks have deterred the British trade unions since, said the EWC coordinator of the TUC, Sean Bamford (see interview in EWC News 3/2005). The completion of the report is planned for early 2008.\n\nCountry comparison on the legal foundations of the EWC work\n\nCountry comparison on the legal personality of an EWC\n\nBackground: European works councils in the United Kingdom (in German)\n\nMagazine article: Employee representation at British workplaces (in German)\n\nRestructuring in the rubber and plastics industry\n\nAs part of an EU-funded project, managed by the research institute Cesos in Rome, the training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\" is currently conducting three case studies on the practical influence of German works councils on restructuring (see report in EWC News 2/2007). To this end, the group ContiTech was also selected, a high-tech division of Continental's seven business units in the rubber and plastics technology. Earlier, the packaging group Smurfit Kappa and the forklift truck manufacturer Kion already were the focus of attention. All documents will be available shortly on the website of the project.\n\nThe website of the Cesos research project\n\nNew guide to the EWC foundation\n\nThe training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\" produced a guide that explains the most important aspects in the establishment of European works councils: legal issues, steps to establish an EWC, the negotiation of an EWC agreement, content of information and consultation rights, practical work in the EWC and its financial conditions. The study was supported financially by the European Commission and highlights in particular the situation in the courier, parcel and express service sector using the company examples DHL (Deutsche Post), FedEx, Securicor, TNT, UPS and Wincanton. It is available in English, French and German on request.\n\nAlso recommendable is a contribution in German on the same topic in the economic lexicon for the works council, which is published by the Professors Thomas Blanke and Thomas Breisig:\n\nThe contribution to the EWC formation in the economic lexicon\n\nArticles in professional journals\n\nThe German magazine Personalführung (personnel management) published two articles by Werner Altmeyer: in October 2007 on current developments in EWC consulting and in December 2007, a book review on participation in the European Company (SE). The acquisition of the Hilton hotel group by equity firm Blackstone illuminated an article in the October/November 2007 edition of the German magazine Mitbestimmung (codetermination).\n\nThe contribution on current developments in the EWC consulting (in German)\n\nThe book review on participation in the SE (in German)\n\nBackground report on the acquisition of the Hilton hotel group\n\nOther publications can be found on our publications page.\n\nver.di/GPA newsletter: new issue\n\nOn 21st December 2007, the latest edition of the German-Austrian EWC newsletter of ver.di and GPA appeared. It deals with the revision of the EWC Directive, several initiatives for the establishment of European works councils, the work of the ver.di department for utilities and waste management companies, European connections of GPA as well as protest calls against restructuring in Volksfürsorge and Novartis. Furthermore, a national report on the UK, seminar dates, meeting reviews and literature tips are included. The newsletter is produced by the training and consultancy network \"euro-workscouncil.net\" and published only in German."
