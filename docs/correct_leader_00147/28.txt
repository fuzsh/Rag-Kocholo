Background information:

In January 2016, Minister of State Roth and Vladimír Spidla established the German‑Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration, a format in which they meet alternately in Prague and Berlin and are joined by expert delegations. The delegation talks are supplemented by specific projects. As a result of the dialogue on migration and integration in Prague in November 2016, an agreement was reached to support a project seeking to improve the living conditions of refugees in Jordan. Together with Czechia, the Federal Government is supporting a project in the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan that is overseen by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). The objective of the project is to expand and maintain existing refugee accommodation and to distribute humanitarian aid supplies. Germany is supporting these measures with 1.5 million euros in 2017. Czechia has contributed a similar sum.
