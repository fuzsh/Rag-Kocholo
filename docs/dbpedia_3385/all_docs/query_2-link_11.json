        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThese 36 prominent celebrities are outspoken advocates for the LGBTQ community.\n\nMany have shared queer experiences through music, like Halsey, Lil Nas X, and Yung Miami.\n\nActors like Bella Ramsey, Asia Kate Dillon, and Laverne Cox have reflected the wide spectrum of gender on-screen.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNoah Schnapp came out as gay on TikTok.\n\nSchnapp posted a TikTok video in January that read, \"When I finally told my friends and family I was gay after being scared in the closet for 18 years and all they said was 'we know.'\"\n\nIn the video, the actor also lip-syncs to voice-over audio that says, \"You know what it never was? That serious. It was never that serious. Quite frankly, will never be that serious.\"\n\nSchnapp, who plays Will Byers on the Netflix hit show \"Stranger Things,\" alluded to the fact that he and his character were more alike than he realized. Will expresses his feelings for his best friend Mike on the show.\n\n\"Obviously, it was hinted at in Season 1: It was always kind of there, but you never really knew, is it just him growing up slower than his friends?\" Schnapp told Variety in a July 2022 interview. \"Now that he's gotten older, they made it a very real, obvious thing. Now it's 100% clear that he is gay and he does love Mike.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBella Ramsey has opened up about being nonbinary and has praised her show \"The Last of Us\" for its representation of queer relationships.\n\nIn 2023, \"The Last of Star\" Bella Ramsey told The New York Times her gender \"has always been very fluid,\" and that she considers herself \"nonbinary.\"\n\n\"I'm very much just a person,\" she told the outlet. \"Being gendered isn't something that I particularly like, but in terms of pronouns, I really couldn't care less.\"\n\nRamsey spoke openly about wearing a chest binder on the set of the hit Max show, and praised \"The Last of Us\" for portraying positive queer relationships on-screen.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Happy, Sad, Confused podcast in February, she said: \"I think it's just really nice and important that people can feel represented, and the hope is that it impacts people who aren't in the community just as much as it impacts people who are.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRapper Yung Miami of the City Girls confirmed that she was bisexual during a May podcast appearance.\n\nDuring an appearance on the podcast \"The Jason Lee Show\" in May, rapper Yung Miami spoke about her bisexuality and admitted that she had a crush on Megan Thee Stallion.\n\n\"I'mma smash all day and tomorrow,\" she said of Megan.\n\n\"Sexually, I've been with a woman before, I love it,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComedian Mo'Nique spoke about sexuality in her Netflix comedy special \"I Am Mo'Nique.\"\n\nMo'Nique said during the special that she grew up with a gay aunt who struggled to gain acceptance from her family.\n\nThat made it difficult for Mo'Nique to be completely honest with her family about her own burgeoning sexuality.\n\nAfter watching her aunt struggle to gain acceptance from her grandmother, Mo'Nique said she didn't want to go through the same thing.\n\n\"I couldn't tell my grandmother who her granddaughter really was. 'Cause I didn't want to be loved privately. I adored how she adored me,\" she explained.\n\n\"So I couldn't tell my grandmother my secret thoughts. And my fantasies. 'Cause I didn't want her to love me privately, and I did not want her to leave this earth thinking she was a failure,\" she continued. \"'Cause had I told her, my secret thoughts, she would've left thinking, that she failed.\"\n\nMo'Nique went on to say that while she wasn't a lesbian \"all the way\" she did feel sexual desires for women.\n\nShe did eventually confess these feelings to her husband, Sidney Hicks.\n\n\"'Daddy, I want to be with another woman, sexually,'\" she told him. \"And he looked at me, so beautifully and so patient and so loving, and said, 'Bitch, me too!' He said, 'You find that bitch and we will fuck that bitch together!'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliot Page described himself as trans and queer in a letter to fans.\n\nThe \"Umbrella Academy\" star, who was nominated for an Academy Award for the 2007 film \"Juno,\" clarified his name and pronouns in a letter shared on Twitter.\n\n\"I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life,\" he wrote. \"I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.\"\n\nIn the letter, Page denounced politicians \"who work to criminalize trans health care and deny our right to exist,\" and \"all of those with a massive platform who continue to spew hostility towards the trans community.\"\n\nHe added: \"I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer.
