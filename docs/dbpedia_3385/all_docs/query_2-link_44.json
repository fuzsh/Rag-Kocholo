        "text": "By Lee Gambol, Distance Learning Coordinator & Museum Educator\n\nIt was the spring of 2013, and I had just finished presenting the Museum’s program about Balto and his role in the 1925 “Race of Mercy” to Nome, Alaska. I was at the Renaissance assisted living facility in Olmsted Falls, Ohio, and as I was showing a video of the parade held on March 19, 1927, to welcome Balto and six canine teammates to Cleveland, I heard a voice call out from the audience: “I was there!”\n\nTurns out the voice belonged to Dorothy (“Dottie”) P. Battes, who was a 14-year-old resident of the East Side in 1927 when she read a newspaper article about Cleveland’s running a fundraiser for Balto. George Kimble, another Clevelander, had spotted Balto and several other huskies languishing in a shabby “dime” museum in Los Angeles. Kimble had talked the sideshow owner into holding the dogs for $100, hoping he could convince folks in his hometown to help raise the $1,500 to buy all seven dogs.\n\nDorothy told me all about how she LOVED dogs and had insisted on donating her lunch money to the fundraiser. And how her father took her downtown on a rainy day in March to welcome the dogs to their new home at the Brookside Zoo. She commented, “He [Balto] was little, and I was little!”\n\nHow amazing is that—to meet a person who is a living part of the history the Museum preserves, and to hear her firsthand account of meeting the dog who became a legend? It is my honor to track down these kinds of stories and add them to our collection of wonderful ways that a small black-and-white husky not only helped to save the lives of an entire town, but continues to inspire the hearts and minds of dog lovers everywhere who hear his story. In celebration of the date when our beloved Balto came to spend his well-earned retirement years in Cleveland, allow me to share with you some of my favorite frequently asked questions.\n\nWhat is the “Race of Mercy,” and why was it important in history?\n\nIn late January of 1925, in the midst of a raging blizzard, the small town of Nome, Alaska, experienced an outbreak of diphtheria. This bacteria lodges in a person’s windpipe and creates a thick membrane that suffocates the victim. Children are the most susceptible, and the native Inuit were particularly vulnerable to this illness, as it was newly brought to the area by the influx of prospectors looking for gold. A package of serum was located and brought as far as train allowed to Nenana, still 674 miles from Nome. Rather than trusting the open-cockpit biplane that was available, Governor Bone of Alaska chose to ask for volunteers to set up a relay of dogsled teams to transport the serum across the state. Twenty mushers and over 200 dogs managed to make the 674-mile trip in only five and a half days, saving the residents of Nome and instantly introducing the concept of dogsledding across the United States.\n\nWho are the two most famous mushers from the Serum Run?\n\nLeonhard Seppala – Born in Norway in 1877, he came to Nome in 1900 (on a ship called the S.S. Ohio!) during the gold rush. Failing to strike it rich, he pursued a career in breeding and racing huskies. During the Serum Run, with a 12-year-old Siberian husky named Togo as his lead, he drove 170 miles (274 kilometers) from Nome to Shaktoolik, from January 27th to the 31st, on his planned run to Nulato to meet the antitoxin. In addition to his return trip of 91 miles (146 km), from Shaktoolik to Golovin, that represents a grand total of 261 miles (420 km) covered by his team. That constitutes nearly five times the total distance covered by any other team. Seppala died in 1967 at age 90, and his ashes were scattered along the Iditarod Trail by his wife, Constance.\n\nGunnar Kaasen – Born in Norway in 1882, Kaasen came to Nome in 1904. His team, led by Balto, ran the last 53 miles in the Serum Run. He described two major incidents during this run: At one point, the wind was so fierce that his sled was blown over and the box of serum tumbled off the sled. Kaasen had to dig with bare hands in the snow, but he managed to find the package. Later, Balto suddenly stopped and refused to budge—his front paws had broken through the ice of the Topkok River! The dog saved the team from crashing into the icy water. At 5:30 a.m. on February 2, 1925, Kaasen delivered the serum to Nome’s hospital and went straight back to Balto, hugging him and repeating, “Damn fine dog.” Kaasen retired from mushing in 1950 and died in November 1960 in Everett, Washington.\n\nWhat is the meaning of the name “Balto”?\n\nBalto was named after Samuel J. Balto, who, along with Fridtjof Nansen, first crossed the Greenland Ice Cap in 1888. He also held mining claims in Alaska.\n\nWhen was Balto born, and when did he die?\n\nBalto was born in 1919, at Leonhard Seppala’s kennels in Nome. Because Balto’s body type didn’t match that of the racing huskies Seppala was breeding, no specific records were saved about him or his litter. He died March 14, 1933, and was assisted in his last hours by Dr. R.R. Powell. His body was preserved by taxidermist Frank Tobin of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where it is displayed today.\n\nHow old was Balto during the Serum Run to Nome?\n\nLeonhard Seppala was once quoted as claiming that Balto was 6 years old at the time of the Serum Run, which would make Balto’s birth year 1919.\n\nDid Balto ever have any puppies?\n\nNo. He was neutered at around 6 months of age. Seppala was in the market of breeding small, fast huskies for racing, and Balto was stout and strong—a “freight-hauling dog.”\n\nWhat other dogs were on Balto’s team?\n\nKaasen had a team of 13 dogs when the Serum Run occurred, but only six dogs remained after their two years of touring the country. They lived with Balto at the Brookside Zoo. Their names were Fox, Billy, Tillie, Sye, Old Moctoc, and Alaska Slim.\n\nWhy are Alaskans more fond of Togo than Balto?\n\nTogo was the lead Siberian husky sled dog for Leonhard Seppala’s team: courageous and strong, smart and possessing an exceptional ability to find the trail and sense danger. He was a sickly puppy; Seppala tried to give him away as a pet, but Togo broke loose and escaped back to the kennel where he was born. Once given a chance to try leading a team, Togo proved to be a superb leader. Several years before the diphtheria outbreak, Seppala was crossing the Norton Sound when the ice began breaking up, stranding his sled on a floating iceberg. He grabbed Togo and threw him across a gap to stable ice, and Togo braced himself so his master could pull the iceberg close enough for the team to scramble across! It was always an issue for Seppala that Togo was 12 years old during the Serum Run, but the much younger Balto received all the media attention. After helping to rescue Nome, Togo was allowed to retire and eventually taken to a resort in Poland Spring, Maine (owned by the husband of Elizabeth Ricker, Seppala’s friend and fellow musher). Togo was euthanized on December 5, 1929, at age 16. His body was mounted and is on display at Iditarod Trail Headquarters Museum in Wasilla, Alaska. His skeleton is stored at Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History in Connecticut.\n\nWhat’s the Cleveland Connection to Balto? Why is he at the Museum?\n\nSoon after Nome was saved, Kaasen and his dog team were sent to the lower 48 states for a chance to tour the country and introduce people to Balto. After two years, Seppala decided to sell off the dogs, send Kaasen back to Alaska, and take his own team on a second tour. In late February 1927, a Cleveland businessman named George Kimble discovered Balto’s team on display at a Los Angeles “dime” museum; all the dogs were ill and mistreated. Kimble struck a deal with Sam Houston, the sideshow owner: two weeks to raise $1,500 to purchase all seven dogs. Kimble placed an ad in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and the race was on to save Balto. The Plain Dealer established a “Balto Fund,” and radio broadcasts across the nation appealed for donations. Schoolkids (like Dottie!) collected coins in buckets and jars; the Western Reserve Kennel Club donated funds. The city managed to raise over $2,000—enough to also buy the dogs passage on a train to bring them to Cleveland. On March 19, 1927, after receiving a hero’s welcome parade through Public Square, Balto and the six remaining dogs settled down to enjoy retirement at the Brookside Zoo."
