It's against their religion.\"\n\n(Gregory Peck) \"Did they seem all that religious to you?\"\n\n(Sian Barbara Allen) \"Billy Two Hats? How did you get a name like that?\"\n\n(Unnamed) \"Well, my mother was a Kiowa and I don't know who my father was except he was white. My mother didn't know too much about him neither, except she told me he was kind of important. She said that in his room he had two hats; one for special and one for ordinary. That impressed my mother a whole lot. And when I was a kid it impressed me.\"\n\n(Sian Barbara Allen) \"How many (Indians) do you think there are?\"\n\n(Gregory Peck) \"Four, I think.\"\n\n(Sian Barbara Allen) \"How do you know there's four?\"\n\n(Gregory Peck) \"I counted their feet and divided by two.\"\n\n(Sian Barbara Allen) \"Once she gets excited she can hardly speak, so I give her a whack. It shakes her brain box up a bit.\"\n\nJack Warden as Sheriff Henry Gifford\n\n(Jack Warden) \"Who's out there?\"\n\n(Unnamed) \"Oh, just a lot of nothing.\"\n\n(Jack Warden) \"Can he wash?\"\n\n(Unnamed) \"Ah -- it's a mighty fancy 'breed, washing and all that.\"\n\n(Unnamed) \"Well, go on, but don't let him use a whole lot of water.\"\n\n(Jack Warden) \"Wash up. But don't waste any water.\"\n\n(Unnamed) \"Mighty fancy 'breed ya' got there, sure enough, Henry.\"\n\n(Jack Warden) \"Yeah, he's fancy all right.

Well, he's not out there. He's down in Mexico leaning up against some cantina bar, puking up all that money you and him and your dead partner stole. Yeah, all that money. Four hundred twenty dollars. You had to kill somebody at that. I don't like no kind of law breaker, breed. But the kind I hate worse is a cheap one. And cheaper than you and your friend, they just don't come.\"\n\nGregory Peck as Arch Deans\n\n(Gregory Peck) \"You remember, Billy -- he asked me why I came back for you.

And if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. And if one shall prevail against him, two shall withstand him.'\"\n\n(Unnamed) \"That's in a book?\"\n\n(Gregory Peck) \"Aye. That, and a LOT more, Billy.\"\n\nAdd or Update Quotes\n\nIf you have a quote to add or change and want to let us know, please fill in the form below.
