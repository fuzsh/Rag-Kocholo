I Feel Like a Woman!” superstar had the time of her life dancing to the 1989 single “Blank Space” in Vegas. “What a show,” she wrote on Instagram.\n\nEmma Roberts\n\nYes, yet another Emma was at The Eras’ Vegas stop, as she was spotted taking videos and dancing with sunglasses on to the tune of “Style.”\n\nWatch here.\n\nEllen Pompeo\n\nAnother “Blank Space” fan is Ellen Pompeo’s daughter Sienna, who starred in her mother’s Instagram Stories singing along to the track in Las Vegas.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nSwift’s longtime friend showed up for her at the April 1 show in Arlington, Texas. Selena and her little sister Gracie each dressed up as a Taylor Swift era — Folklore and Speak Now, respectively — and Gomez was spotted screaming along to “Cruel Summer.”\n\nJack Antonoff\n\nSwift’s prolific producer pal Antonoff also made it to see the star in Arlington on April 1. “holy shit,” he captioned an Instagram Stories video taken during the emotional stage production of “August,” a Folklore favorite that he co-wrote and co-produced.
