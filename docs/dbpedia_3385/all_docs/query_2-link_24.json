        "text": "Billy Ray Cyrus and Firerose's marriage is over.\n\nIn May 2024, the \"Achy Breaky Heart\" singer quietly filed for divorce from the Australian singer, whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges, after only seven months of marriage. A settlement was quickly reached in early August 2024.\n\n“She isn’t the person he thought he married,\" an insider told PEOPLE. \"He believes she married him so he [could] take care of her financially.\"\n\nThe duo first teamed up for a musical collaboration in 2021, and Firerose seemingly confirmed their romance in August 2022 when she paid tribute to Billy Ray on his birthday.\n\nFirerose and Billy Ray sparked engagement rumors when she posted a photo wearing a diamond on her ring finger on Sept. 13, 2022. It was later revealed that Billy Ray had proposed the month before.\n\nIn October 2023, the couple tied the knot, announcing the news on Instagram. \"10/10/23 will always be the beautiful, joyous day that our two souls united as one in holy matrimony,\" they wrote. \"It was the most perfect, ethereal celebration of love we could have ever imagined.\"\n\nBefore Firerose, Billy Ray was married to Tish Cyrus for 28 years and the couple share five children: daughters Miley, Noah and Brandi, and sons Trace and Braison.
