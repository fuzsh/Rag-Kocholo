        "text": "Sylvia “Marilla” Archuleta: 1938 – 2024\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Sylvia (Marilla) Archuleta. A beloved wife, mother, aunt, godmother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. After 86 years, Sylvia was called to heaven to be reunited with her beloved parents and seven siblings on July 28, 2024. Born on May 13, 1938 in Las Vegas, New Mexico she lived a long and beautiful life, filling ours with unconditional love and lifetime of memories.\n\nSylvia met the love of her life, Gilbert Archuleta, at a family party in New Mexico. Where they would talk, cruise around the back roads of New Mexico and dance the night away with each other. They married on July 27, 1957 at Assumption of Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Welby, Colorado. In 1965, Sylvia and Gilbert decided to move to Wyoming to raise their four daughters and create a beautiful foundation for their family. Sylvia took care of her four daughters and worked at Cheyenne Memorial Medical Hospital for 30 years as a housekeeper.\n\nShe always looked forward to the holidays where the house is filled with laughter and joy while we ate the meal that she worked so hard to cook that morning for the family. Afterwards the family would toast each other while we played poker, and Sylvia would always be the one holding the winning cards and would be the lucky one winning the final pot of the night and generously give her grandchildren some of her winnings.\n\nHer family all looked forward to her homemade sugar cookies and fresh tortillas while listening to her favorite Spanish records. Also making chocolate cake and her sweet rice during Christmas time. Sylvia would love to go on shopping trips to buy gifts for her grandchildren, go gambling in Blackhawk, eat ice cream in the car while talking about the good ‘ol days, and occasionally go out for a drink with her family. You always can count on going to her house during Halloween where she would have a hot meal, hot coca, fresh baked cupcakes and goodie bags for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nSylvia was the one her family turned to tell their secrets, the one who comforted them in time of need, and the one who encouraged them to dream big and live life to the fullest. If you need a button sew or even if your clothes needed pressed, with no hesitation Sylvia would be glad to do it. Her biggest joys were spending time with her husband, raising her daughters, grandchildren, great grandchildren and loving her son-in-laws as her own.\n\nSylvia is survived by her husband, Gilbert Archuleta; and her four daughters: Debbie Oliez (Robert), Yvonnie Maestas (Billy), Florenda Gutierrez (Raymond), and Stephanie Morales (Greg).\n\nAdditional survivors by her seven grandchildren: Tiffany Rein (Tyson), Joshua Gutierrez (Andrea), Gabriel Gutierrez (Tiffany), Paul Oliez (Kimberly), William Reczek, John Reczek, Hannah Morales; and numerous great grandchildren.\n\nSylvia was preceded in death by her parents, Juan and Florinda Ortega; her siblings: Fred Ortega, Rebecca Aerts, Joe Ortega, Evelyn Ortega, Joanne Gallegos, Casimirita Dean and Mary Sena.\n\nTillie C Garcia: 1936 – 2024\n\nIn loving memory of Matilda (Tillie) C Garcia:\n\nMatilda (Tillie) Cicilia Garcia, also known affectionately as Tillie, was a remarkable individual who touched the lives of many with kindness, warmth, and unwavering faith. Born on March 14, 1936, in Fort Collins, Colorado, Tillie’s journey came to a peaceful ending at home surrounded by her loved ones on July 25, 2024, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nTillie’s impact on the community was profound. She ran a beloved home daycare called “Tillies Daycare” on the west side of Cheyenne. Countless children of family and friends including all of her grandchildren and great grandchildren were welcomed into “Grandma Beans” loving embrace over the years. The front door of the house on 24th Street was always open, symbolizing Tillie’s welcoming nature and the love that she generously shared with all who crossed the threshold.\n\nHer career was defined by dedication and love for those in her care. Tillie had a loving sense of humor and knew when to give tough love. She held her family together like glue and will be deeply missed. Her fresh tortillas and beans, wonderful for filling meals and surprise goodie bags for every single person at the house during the holidays will forever remain cherished memories for those who were fortunate enough to know her.\n\nTillie’s roots were strong in faith and family. She graduated from high school in Fort Collins before starting a lifelong journey with her beloved husband Frank Garcia. Their marriage lasted an incredible 65 years until Frank’s passing, a testament to their enduring love and commitment.\n\nIn addition to Frank, Tillie is reunited in eternal peace with her parents Pete and Nellie Ortiz, in-laws John and Fidelia Garcia, brother Peter Ortiz sisters, Lupe, Cirila and Rita Ortiz, grandsons Lewis and Chris Garcia, as well as great-grandson Leandro.\n\nWhile we mourn the loss of this extraordinary woman, we also celebrate her life and legacy. Survived by Juanita Garcia, Frank (Rose) Garcia, George Garcia, Jimmy Garcia, Angela Schafer (Chris), Christina Penaflor (Gerald;) brother, Tom Ortiz; and sister, Romona Robertson. She has 20 grandchildren, 40 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. She has numerous relatives and friends who will continue to carry forward Tillie’s spirit of love and kindness.\n\nTillie had diverse interests including cooking, gardening, listening to Elvis Presley music, watching the Catholic channel, enjoying true crime shows but most of all – she enjoyed spending time with family during any leisure time she had. She always had time for anyone who wanted to hear about her experiences and learn from her loving words of wisdom and sound advice. We loved to hear her opinion on anything that ever came up,,,past or present.\n\nHer presence will be deeply missed more than words could ever explain but the memories she created will live on forever in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to know her.\n\nMay Matilda (Tillie) C. Garcia rest in eternal peace knowing that she brought light into countless lives during her time on earth.\n\nA livestream of Tillie’s Mass will be available for free online at: stmarycathedral.com/livestream.\n\nBonnie Jean Johnson: 1959 – 2024\n\nBonnie Jean Johnson, affectionately known as Nana, was a kind and sweet soul who touched the lives of many. She was born on January 26, 1959, in Omaha, Nebraska, where her journey began. Bonnie’s warm and welcoming personality made her a beloved figure to all who had the pleasure of knowing her.\n\nThroughout her life, Bonnie dedicated 39 years of hard work to Target, showcasing her unwavering dedication and strong work ethic. However, beyond her career, Bonnie’s true passions lay in spending quality time with her family, indulging in various crafts around the house, and tending to her garden. Her love for crafting was not merely a hobby but a form of creative expression that brought joy to those around her.\n\nTragically, on July 24, 2024, Bonnie passed away peacefully at Davis Hospice, leaving behind a legacy of love and cherished memories. Her departure has created a void in the hearts of her surviving family and friends. Bonnie is survived by her brother, Dan Christie; her sister, Cynthia Duke; son, Aaron Johnson; daughter, Christina Castillo; and several grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nBonnie has gone home to heaven to be reunited with the love of her life, Mack Johnson; her grandson, Mikey; and her parents, Willis and Mildred Christie.\n\nBonnie Jean Johnson will be remembered for being a beautiful soul inside and out — a hardworking individual who epitomized love and warmth. She will forever be treasured for the kindness she shared with everyone she met. May her gentle soul rest in eternal peace as she continues to inspire all those who were lucky enough to have had her touch their lives.\n\nDonald Dale Owsley: 1931 – 2024\n\nDonald Dale Owsley was born to Lewis and Theresa Tricillia Green Owsley in Hagerman Valley, Idaho. Who knew the impact this little whipper snapper would have on the lives of so many people? But hold on, we’ll get to that, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,\n\nTo many, Donald went by Don, some addressed him as Dale; but his favorite honors were husband, dad, grandpa, great grandpa, brother, uncle, or “my friend.” Whatever you called him, he would always answer, and listen with fullness of heart. What was valuable to you was central to Dad. Many sought out his wisdom and guidance; however, when correction was necessary, you would be read to from the “Book of Don.” It suffices to say many a family member has been read from a chapter or two.\n\nOur mother called him Dale. So, we will refer to him as Dale until he became Dad.\n\nIn search of making a good honest living, Dale’s father, Lewis, moved the family from the Hagerman Valley to Henderson, Nevada where he found work constructing the Hoover Dam. He found the safety of those laboring to complete the dam leaky at best. Lewis witnessed the loss of life to the unfortunate who fell to their final resting place, forever intombed in a concrete grave. Though Lewis was not one to shun a hard day’s work, that Hoover “Dam” job was not worth the risk. He loaded up the family along with their belongings and made his way up to Draper, Utah where he “raised” a poultry farm. This is where Dale spent a good portion of his early years. One of his first jobs found him “cooped up” raising and processing chickens for his dad. We loved listening to Dad, (Dale), telling us stories of how neighbors would trade goods they raised for goods they needed to help make ends meet.\n\nEven after butchering chickens day in and day out, chicken cooked in a special family recipe in a Dutch Oven became a family favorite. Dale refused to eat chicken cooked any other way.\n\nDale attended Jordan High School where he found creative ways to “pass” the test. For instance, he agreed to teach the instructor how to ski to “earn” an “A” in the class. Many of his classmates joined in on the fun and so began the Jordan High School Ski Club. Dale loved to ski, and it was not unusual to find him on the slopes doing flips and other tricks, Dale eventually joined the Alta Ski Patrol and continued to give skiing lessons to anyone that would sign up. Oh, and yes, he did pass that language class with an “A.”\n\nThroughout his life, Dale loved to compose verse where he blended word and passion with pen and paper. These treasures are bound together for family to enjoy for generations to come. It was moms wish that they never be published. Most were family related. Therefore, they were just for family.\n\nDale served in the Navy during the Korean Conflict. He was honorably discharged after his ship an auxiliary oil and gas tanker hit a mine off the coast of South Korea. He woke up at Trippler Army Hospital in Hawaii where he was presented the purple heart, a certificate, and a handshake while a photo was taken. His heart sank however, when the officer told him there was a shortage on purple hearts and he needed this medal to present to several other wounded men; Dale could present the certificate to any army navy store to pick up a purple heart.\n\nAfter being discharged, Dale returned home, wounded and broken. Life got better when his sister, Peggy, introduced him to Ellen Charlene Angell, who captured his heart and kept it beating for 51 years, one month, eight hours, 12 minutes, and it was not nearly long enough while they shared life together hand in hand. He longed to be reunited with her in heaven since her passing on December 21, 2003. Then, on July 21, 2024, after 21 years apart, he is once again dancing with our mother. We do know that the moment dad passed through the veil, we witnessed a smile.\n\nIt was October 8, 1953, when Dale and Ellen transitioned graciously to Dad and Mom with the birth of Dale Lewis Owsley. Every two years for the next eight the family increased one daughter at a time. This family of seven shared life’s most precious moments loving, supporting and of course the occasional antagonizing of one another.\n\nTogether, Dad and Mom poured their lives and love into five wonderful, adorable, children, (no, I’m not exaggerating). Through the years these five multiplied their legacy and the family continues to grow. At last count, (and dad took pride in counting each and every one of them): 18 grandkids; 44 great-grandkids; four great-great-grandkids, with three more on the way.\n\nTo support his young family, dad secured a job as a welder the Lang Company in Salt Lake City. From there he joined the union at the Salt Lake refinery which sometime later was acquired by and became known as the American Oil Company of Salt Lake City. It was there he worked his way up to the safety office, became part of management, and advanced to the position of Assistant Safety Director. During his employment there, dad and mom worked together on a “Safety Seat Belt Demonstration” that was shown to over 750,000 people in groups of forty to eighty people per demonstration. It was then shown to the National Safety Council, and finally to the United States Congress. This eventually led to him testifying before congress on two separate occasions, which resulted in the passing of the National Safety Seat Belt Law\n\nDad and mom loved taking the family on camping trips in the gorgeous mountains around Salt Lake City. Other favorite past times were hunting, skiing, archery, fishing – sometimes fishing with bow and arrow, hiking, exploring, cutting down our Christmas trees as well as simply going on drives enjoying the scenery. At Easter, we would join others at the Utah State Capital and roll Easter eggs down the capital lawns. Once the egg cracked, you could eat it. Some of us tossed them back and forth attempting to break them, one of us, (Leslie), sat on an egg, which later we joked about her laying an egg. Mom and Dad made EVERYTHING special. One year for Christmas we followed a string all the way through the house and finally found our new little brother, his name was Sam and for 8 wonderful years we monkeyed around with this Capuchin monkey.\n\nWinter found the family gathered working on puzzles, sipping hot punch, eating Moms’ amazing chili and listening to music. Dad and mom, on many nights after tucking the five of us into bed, would turn on their favorite big band music and gracefully waltz their way into the night. They also enjoyed the Cha Cha, polka and swing. Though mom favored the Cha Cha dad preferred to waltz holding mom lovingly in his arms.\n\nFrom beautiful Bountiful, Utah, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri where Dad found favor with the Bendix Corporation, but he did not find favor with the chiggers. From Kansas City, they moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming where he eventually became the Administrator of Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health. Dedicated to health and safety, Dad labored to write the Wyoming 18b plan. The Federal Dept. of Labor was not in favor of the state retaining their own authority and claimed the plan was flawed. So, Dad, and Governor Hathaway sued the DOL and succeeded in passing the 18B plan. Dad was known as the “Snake” on Capitol Hill. After he retired from Wyoming OHSA, he took on several cases as an expert witness and many cases were won solely based on his testimony. We are so proud of how Dad stood for what he believed in and saw things through to their victory by never backing down or cowering to threats.\n\nMany Cheyenne-ites knew Dad and Mom from Dunkin Donuts where they had part ownership with Craig and Terry Henning. There was a lot of truth in those commercials, where the owner met himself leaving through the door ” TIME TO MAKE THE DOUGHNUTS” Do you remember the “sign wars” on Lincoln Way between the Balloon Family and Dunkin Donuts? Many patrons would stop in or drive by simply to read the banter between the fun-loving word battle-ists.\n\nMom and Dad bought their earthly piece of heaven just north of Cheyenne, where they enjoyed their six-hole golf course on the prairie with four water shots and a sand pit. They also enjoyed conducting their N-gage locomotives in the train room they labored over together with help from other family members. Trains were a passion for dad and mom that began one Christmas when mom gave him his first set: “The De Witt Clinton” by Bachmann. The railway nostalgia has romanced its way through the generations and will long be in the hearts of those privileged to be ” n-gaged” with this affair.\n\nAfter the passing of our beloved mother, Dad became active in the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints. He was very active in the church, wore many hats, and made many friends. He was very respected and loved by his church family. This became a very important part of his life.\n\nThere is so much more to say, so much more to share, volumes could be put to paper. There are memories etched in the hearts of family and friends. Moments in time have been captured on slides, photos, film and even recordings of those familiar voices that speak of time past. We will continue the legacy for generations to come.\n\nDonald Dale Owsley was preceded in death by his life partner and best friend, Ellen Charlene Angell Owsley, whom he has rejoined in heaven; his parents, Lewis and Theressia Owsley; and sisters, Betty Lou Eileen Fitch and Peggy Donalue Fisher. Also departing ahead of dad were his oldest child and only son, Dale Lewis Owsley; son-in-law, Phillip Mireles; grandson, Michael Kopcho; and great-grandson, Eric Warren.\n\nHe is survived by his daughters: Cheryl Mireles of Mesa Arizona, Terry Henning, (Craig); Linda Kibben, (David), Leslie Jenkins, (Randy), all of Cheyenne, Wyoming; 18 grandchildren; 44 great-grandchildren; and four, soon-to-be-more, great-great-grandchildren.\n\nTo know Dad was to love Dad. One of his favorite things would be to engage with friends and strangers alike presenting them with a Hershey’s Kiss and he’d say, “You have just been kissed by a 93-year-old man.” He got more enjoyment from the responses he received than from giving the “kiss.” I hope you were blessed to be one of those who brought pleasure to our dad.\n\nAnd so – in loving respect and honor of Donald Dale Owsley – “Owsleys saddle up” and “Have any kind of a day you want!”\n\nKenna Lee Vosler: 1973 – 2024\n\nKenna Lee Hill-Vosler, 50 years old, of Cheyenne, Wyoming, passed away at home surrounded by Baloo, Gertrude, Elsa, and Miley.\n\nShe was born December 18, 1973, in Cheyenne, Wyoming to Rick and Dawn Hill.\n\nKenna graduated from Central High School. She worked at Sears for a while and then went to beauty school. Kenna finally found her groove, obtain her CNA License, and then cared for the elderly at the various nursing homes in Cheyenne. She ended up working at CRMC Home Health Care office.\n\nKenna loved crafting with her mother, Dawn, and carrying on many family traditions. Her cooking skills were out of this world. For her friends, she would light up the room when she came in. Kenna was our camp Queen for decades at Guernsey Reservoir. Kenna is survived by her father and mother, Rick and Dawn Hill; husband, Matt Vosler; son, Tyler Loveridge; daughter, Savannah Conner; stepchildren: Chase (Sara), Cody, Cortney and Cera Vosler; Kenna’s pride and joy, her grandchildren: Lilly, Matthew, Layla Loveridge, MaKenzie and James Johnson, Lincoln and Loki Clark, Treigh Ganison, Amirah Gonzales, Camilla and Sutton Lee Vosler; her brothers, James (Shenna) and Lane (Leslie) Hill; nephew, Rick Hill; nieces: Dara, Laney, and Olivia Hill; numerous aunts, uncles, and fun cousins.\n\nKenna was preceded in death by grandparents: Paul Doran and Caroline Schiely, James V and Jean Hill; and numerous aunts and uncles.\n\nHer purpose in life was to make her family — husband, grandchildren and friends — happy.\n\nA memorial service will be 10:00 a.m., Friday, August 2, at Wiederspahn-Radomsky Chapel immediately followed by a reception at The Gathering Place from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m."
