By the end of the gunfight, nine men lay dead or wounded, and the people of Ingalls had a vivid picture of Western lawlessness and the harsh means needed to restore justice.\n\nAll Hands on Deck\n\nDescription\n\nCars. Real estate. Cash. Jewelry. These are the items regularly seized by deputy marshals. But you would have to add about 13 Revolutionary War-era shipwrecks - including one believed to be Captain James Cook's HMB Endeavour - to make that list complete. The Marshals Service in 1999 was called upon by Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse to symbolically arrest and seize the vessels to prevent salvage hunters and recreational divers from vandalizing and pilfering them.\n\nUnited States Marshals and Their Deputies: 1789-1989\n\nDescription\n\nThe offices of U.S. Marshals and Deputy Marshal were created by the first Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789, the same legislation that established the Federal judicial system.

In Miami, \"Puño Airlines\" was set up and letters were sent to fugitives telling them that they had won a free flight, a weekend in the Bahamas, and $350 in spending money. A ticket counter was set up at Miami International Airport next to the Air Haiti ticket counter to add to the realism of the scam.\n\nFugitive Investigative Strike Teams - FIST VIII (1985)\n\nDescription\n\nLaw enforcement personnel based in Miami, with teams set up in Pompano Beach, Tampa, Tallahassee, Orlando, and Jacksonville, nabbed 48 accused or convicted murderers, 20 kidnappers, 61 rapists, 167 robbers and 593 major narcotics traffickers.

But history needs its enforcers. And when James Meredith sought to legally become the first black person to attend the University of Mississippi 60 years ago, the duty of upholding the federal law allowing him to do so fell upon the shoulders of 127 deputy marshals from all over the country who risked their lives to make his dream a reality.\n\nU.S. Marshals and the Moonshine War 1872-1913\n\nDescription\n\nOf all the duties in this country, that of U. S. Marshal is the most dangerous and onerous. The people of the neighboring counties seem to have the idea that the chief use of any officer of the law is to afford a target for their rifles and pistols, and we too well know how many United States officers have fallen victims to duty.\n\nProtection of Federal Judges\n\nDescription\n\nBased on this historical event, the Supreme Court held that the President has power, through the Attorney General, to direct a United States Marshal to accompany and protect federal judges from a threatened assault.

By \"us,\" which could be expanded to include the country or globe, but it certainly changed the U.S. Marshals Service.

Senior Inspector Geoff Shank, the Investigative Services Division case coordinator, recalled that costs exceeded $200,000 before Waagner was captured in December.\n\nHistorical Federal Executions\n\nDescription\n\nThe U.S. Marshal has been historically assigned the task of conducting the death sentences on those condemned by federal courts. This stemmed from \"An Act for the Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States\" (April 30, 1790) and the Judiciary Act of 1789. The first known federal execution under this authority was conducted by U.S. Marshal Henry Dearborn of Maine on June 25, 1790.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. - An Emergency Call to Montgomery\n\nDescription\n\nJust after one of modern history’s pivotal moments, Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Montgomery, Alabama, to honor the \"Freedom Riders,\" an organized assemblage of activists and citizens that traveled aboard interstate buses through terminals in the South. The original intent was to ride from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans in thirteen days in May 1961.\n\nWe Were There\n\nDescription\n\nAlthough the U.S. Marshals are often linked with civil rights, most recall our crucial role in desegregating educational institutions in the South during the 1960.

This is what occurred on August 28, 1963, when Dr. Martin Luther King led the Washington March for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nHistory in Custody\n\nDescription\n\nAt times, the U.S. Marshals Service is entrusted with objects of national and historic importance.

The U.S. Marshals' Office of Asset Forfeiture had custody of Muhammad Ali's World Boxing Championship Rings.\n\nPrisoner Custody in the 1880's\n\nDescription\n\nU. S. Marshals, similar to today, relied upon local sheriffs for jail space in the early to mid-1880's. The marshals also rented the places in which court was held and prisoners were housed. Generally during this period, the federal government did not build or maintain its own courthouses, preferring to lease county courtrooms or other facilities annually.\n\nSafe Surrender\n\nDescription\n\nFugitive Safe Surrender is a unique, creative, and highly successful initiative that encourages persons wanted for non-violent felony or misdemeanor crimes to voluntarily surrender to the law in a faith-based or other neutral setting.\n\nRetired Deputy U.S. Marshal Follows the Trail of Robert Forsyth’s Murderer\n\nDescription\n\nThe historical marker to the first U.S. Marshal killed in the line of duty, Robert Forsyth of the District of Georgia, stands just outside the cemetery of St. Paul’s Church in Augusta. Dedicated in June 2008, marker 121-12 relates the bare outline of the full tragedy that changed the lives of both assailant and victim.\n\nNo Greater Tragedy - February 13, 1983\n\nDescription\n\nGordon Kahl was one of the leaders of a group known as \"Posse Comitatus\", a loosely organized, armed vigilante group whose members engage in paramilitary training and oppose nearly every action of the federal government, particularly the collection of income taxes.\n\nBoxer...Deputy...Poet\n\nDescription\n\nIf Raging Bull, the story of Middleweight Boxing Champion Jake LaMotta - or even if you have not - it may interest you to know that the Marshals Service had a boxing champion of its own.

But the \"wild west'' past sometimes overshadows the present-day accomplishments of the Marshals Service. New missions have brought greater challenges and responsibilities to the Service.\n\nBicentennial of the U.S. Marshals Service\n\nDescription\n\nTwo hundred years ago, on September 24, 1789, President George Washington signed into law Senate Bill Number One, known as the Judiciary Act. This Act established the Federal judicial system and created the Office of the United States Marshal. Only two days later, President Washington nominated the first United States Marshals responsible for enforcing the Nation's laws and carrying out the orders of its courts.\n\nThe Constitutional Imperative\n\nDescription\n\nAbolitionists and other opponents of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law willfully and as a matter of conscience violated the law by rescuing fugitive slaves from the custody of U.S. Marshals. The freed slaves were taken to Canada. Northern hatred of slavery and Southern protection of their peculiar institution resulted in Southern session from the Union and national Civil War.\n\nAppreciation of Honorary U.S. Marshal James Arness\n\nDescription\n\nWith the passing of a great friend and Honorary U.S. Marshal—who solidified the penultimate character of Matt Dillon in Gunsmoke between 1955 and 1975, we tip our hats to a gentleman who truly got behind law and order in real life. Several times before and after his retirement from the series, he gave of his time and energy to the U.S. Marshals.\n\nA Visit to Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Helen Crawford, Retired\n\nDescription\n\nAt age 100, Helen Crawford still prides her long career with the U.S. Marshals. On July 14, 2008, from the sitting room at an assisted living facility, Bonner Place in Jacksonville, Texas, she related the most exciting of times. One was in 1934, when she began her career in the Eastern District of Texas, she remembered receiving one of her first calls–to be on the lookout for Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow–Bonnie and Clyde!\n\nLynn H. Kobliska\n\nDescription\n\nOn April 8, 2013, the United States Marshals Service lost an employee who had been part of our agency since 1985, and took with him a wealth of knowledge and wit. Lynn Kobliska, 50, began working in our warehouse when he came to the Washington, D.C. area from his native Iowa.\n\nElmore Leonard\n\nDescription\n\nElmore Leonard wrote about deputy U.S. marshals in a number of his fifty novels and short stories. Whether it was Karen Sisco, the female witness security inspector, in Out of Sight or the determined Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens in Fire in the Hole—the basis for the television series \"Justified,\" his characters publicized our agency in a new and exciting way.\n\nWillard C. McArdle\n\nDescription\n\nLongtime deputy U.S. marshal \"Mac\" McArdle was known for his dedicated career as a law enforcement officer, his ability to inspire friends, and appreciation of family. Most of all, he had an amazing knack to be at the center of history while it was occurring—several times.\n\nMedina's Thirty-Year Echo: Honoring the Memory of Our Fallen\n\nDenzil Nelson Bud Staple\n\nHis Name was William Degan: A Look Back on the 30th Anniversary of Ruby Ridge\n\nDescription\n\nBy David S.
