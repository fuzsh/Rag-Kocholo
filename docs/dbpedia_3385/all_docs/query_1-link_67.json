        "text": "Menswear designer Billy Reid has launched a special series of Alabama Gulf Seafood T-shirts and hats.\n\nReid, whose company is based in Alabama, recently was named Menswear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). The new merchandise is available for purchase at BillyReid.com.\n\nThe seafood collection includes two hats and four T-shirts, designed by Reid and featuring fishing boats, crabs and oysters along with the Alabama Gulf Seafood mark. Hats will sell for $38 and T-shirts for $56, and a portion of proceeds will benefit the Alabama Conservation and Natural Resources Foundation.\n\nReid created the line not only as a fundraiser but also to support a newly-launched effort to market Alabama Gulf Seafood.\n\nThe T-shirts and hats will be in Billy Reid stores in New York City, Florence, Ala., Atlanta, Charleston, S.C.; Nashville, Tenn, Dallas and Houston.\n\nReid has become known in the fashion world for his T-shirts designed to support various causes. Last year, he sold a limited-edition T-shirt emblazoned with the word RISE to benefit tornado relief in his home state. The year before proceeds from Reid’s “Tennessee Love” T-shirt benefited residents impacted by floods in and around Nashville."
