        "text": "We are proud to support Billy's efforts fighting food insecurity issues, his interests in growing the game with the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) Billy Horschel Junior Championship and his leadership of the diversity-focused Advocates Pro Golf Association (APGA) Tour Billy Horschel Invitational.\n\nAs a frequent PGA TOUR champion and entrepreneur, Billy has achieved success on an international scale. He knows that global reach is crucial to staying competitive, whether on the golf course or in the office. A native and lifetime resident of Northeast Florida, Billy has won seven times on the PGA TOUR and one time on the DP World Tour, most recently winning the 2022 Memorial Tournament. Billy is consistently ranked as one of the top golfers in the world and finished the 2021-2022 season No. 21 in the FedExCup, while also representing Team USA in the 2022 Presidents Cup. Billy is a dedicated husband to his wife, Brittany, and father to their three children. He hosts one of the most successful AJGA youth golf events, the Billy Horschel Junior Championship, and, along with Annika Sorenstam, was recently named as one of two National Chairmen on the AJGA Board of Directors. Billyâ€™s passion to grow diversity in the game of golf has led him to host an APGA Tour event that provides an opportunity for minority professional golfers to gain experience on and off the course through competition and networking with industry leaders in the golf space. Billy and Brittany recently established a foundation that is dedicated to serving their local community and the military, while focusing on causes such as addiction and combatting hunger."
