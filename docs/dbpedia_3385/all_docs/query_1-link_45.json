        "text": "Phoenix, Arizona\n\nNestled in the heart of Papago Park, surrounded by the Arizona desert’s natural beauty and framed by the stunning Papago Buttes, Papago Golf Club is a golfing haven in Arizona just under two miles from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Conveniently situated where Phoenix, Tempe, and Scottsdale meet, it’s a prime spot for golf enthusiasts.\n\nPapago Golf Club’s story begins with its creator, William Francis (Billy) Bell, the genius behind San Diego’s famed Torrey Pines. Bell’s knack for designing courses that blend seamlessly with their surroundings is evident in Papago, offering golfers unrivaled views of the iconic Arizona Papago Buttes, Camelback Mountain, and the vibrant Downtown Phoenix skyline.\n\nRecently chosen as the new home for Arizona State University’s men’s and women’s golf teams, “The all-new Papago” has become a hub for golfing excellence. The addition of the mid-century modern Lou Grubb Clubhouse, featuring the trendy Lou’s Bar & Grill, and Evie’s Pavilion for group events in 2018 has given Papago a modern twist while retaining its classic charm.\n\nPapago Golf Club invites golf enthusiasts to come enjoy not just the game but also the allure of its Arizona surroundings. With its rich history, modern amenities, and stunning vistas, Papago Golf Club offers a golfing experience like no other. It’s a place where players can immerse themselves in the thrill of the game while soaking in the beauty of the desert landscape, making every round at Papago a memorable experience."
