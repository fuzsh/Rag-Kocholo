        "text": "When you visit the Eisenhower National Historic Site, you are walking in the footsteps of many famous world and national leaders. During his presidency as well as his retirement years after his presidency, Dwight Eisenhower—and his wife, Mamie—welcomed many famous visitors to their Gettysburg home and farm.\n\nWhile president, Eisenhower used these visits from foreign leaders as part of his own personal style of diplomacy. At the farm, Eisenhower and his guests engaged in informal discussions that were off the record and used to get “the measure of the man,” said Eisenhower, a way for him to learn more about each leader individually, as a person and not just as a politician. Most of the visits were short, averaging just two hours or less. Only one famous visitor—Prime Minister Nehru of India—stayed overnight. And most of these visits to the Eisenhower Farm were in addition to more formal discussions and meetings that occurred in the Oval Office or at nearby Camp David. Oftentimes, visits to the farm included lunch, informal chats in the sunporch, meet-and-greets with members of the Eisenhower family including his grandchildren, and tours of Eisenhower’s Angus cattle barn and operation. On at least two occasions, Eisenhower personally led his distinguished guests on tours of the adjacent Gettysburg battlefield.\n\nWhile most of their famous visitors were heads of state, statesmen, and politicians, Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower also welcomed other well-known individuals to their Gettysburg home, including, among others, spiritual leader Reverend Billy Graham, entertainer Bob Hope, golfer Arnold Palmer, and famed American artist Andrew Wyeth. Three future presidents also visited with Ike and Mamie at their Gettysburg farm: Richard Nixon, who served as Eisenhower’s Vice President, visited on several occasions; Gerald Ford, who as House Minority Leader visited in 1961 and whose children received a personal two-hour-long battlefield tour from Dwight Eisenhower; and Ronald Reagan, who visited on June 15, 1966, when he was then a candidate for the governorship of California.\n\nSome of the famous world and foreign leaders who visited the Eisenhowers’ Gettysburg home and farm included Sir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of Great Britain, who visited in May 1959; Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, also in 1959; French President Charles De Gaulle (1960); Jawaharlal Nehru, First Prime Minister of India (1956); British Prime Minster Harold MacMillan (1957); British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (1957); Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of West Germany (1957); Adolfo Lopez Mateos, President of Mexico (1960); Alberto Lleraas Camargo, President of Columbia (1960); and King Mohammad Zahir Shah and Queen Homeira Begum, the last King and Queen of Afghanistan, who visited in September 1963.\n\nThe following is a gallery of images of some of the famous world leaders who visited Dwight and Mamie at their Gettysburg Farm."
