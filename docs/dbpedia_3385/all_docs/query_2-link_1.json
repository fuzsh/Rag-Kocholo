        "text": "Hard, round-crowned hat with a narrow rolled brim\n\nThe bowler hat, also known as a Coke hat, billycock, bob hat, bombín (Spanish) or derby (United States),[1] is a hard felt hat with a rounded crown, originally created by the London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler in 1849.[2] It has traditionally been worn with semi-formal and informal attire. The bowler, a protective and durable hat style, was popular with the British, Irish, and American working classes during the second half of the 19th century, and later with the middle and upper classes in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the east coast of the United States.[3]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bowler hat was designed in 1849 by the London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler to fulfill an order placed by the company of hatters James Lock & Co. of St James's,[4] which had been commissioned by a customer to design a close-fitting, low-crowned hat to protect gamekeepers from low-hanging branches while on horseback. The keepers had previously worn top hats, which were knocked off easily and damaged.[4]\n\nThe identity of the customer is less certain, with some suggesting it was Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester who had an estate at Holkham Hall, in Norfolk.[5] However, research performed by a younger relation of the 1st Earl casts doubt[vague] on this story, and it is claimed by James Lock & Co. that the bowler was invented for Edward Coke, the younger brother of Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester.[6][3] When Edward Coke arrived in London on 17 December 1849 to collect his hat he reputedly placed it on the floor and stamped hard on it twice to test its strength; the hat withstood this test and Coke paid 12 shillings for it.[7]\n\nCultural significance in the British Isles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bowler has had varying degrees of significance in British culture. They were popular among the working classes in the 19th century. From the early 20th century, bowler hats were more commonly associated with financial workers and businessmen working in the financial districts, also known as \"City gents\". The traditional wearing of bowler hats with City business attire declined during the 1970s.[2] In modern times bowlers are not common, although the so-called City gent wearing a bowler and carrying a rolled umbrella remains a representation of Englishmen. For this reason, two bowler-hatted men were used in the logo of the British building society (subsequently bank), Bradford & Bingley.[8]\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland the bowler hat is worn traditionally by members of the main Loyalist fraternities such as the Orange Order, the Independent Loyal Orange Institution, the Royal Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys of Derry for their parades and annual celebrations.[9]\n\nFemale officers of many British police forces also wear bowler hats as part of their uniforms. This includes a cap badge and generally has a black-and-white chequered band (called Sillitoe tartan) around the hat. Bowlers worn by female traffic police officers have white crowns or covers. These hats are not worn in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\n\nThey are also part of the uniforms of female police community support officers (PCSOs).\n\nA typical bowler hat of female British police officers\n\nA typical bowler of female PCSOs in the UK\n\nOutside the British Isles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bowler, not the cowboy hat or sombrero, was the most popular hat in the American West, prompting Lucius Beebe to call it \"the hat that won the West\".[10] Both cowboys and railroad workers preferred the hat because it would not blow off easily in strong wind while riding a horse, or when sticking one's head out the window of a speeding train. It was worn by both lawmen and outlaws, including Bat Masterson, Butch Cassidy, Black Bart, and Billy the Kid. In the United States the hat came to be known commonly as the derby,[5] and American outlaw Marion Hedgepeth was commonly referred to as \"the Derby Kid\".\n\nIn South America, the bowler, known as bombín in Spanish, has been worn by Quechua and Aymara women since the 1920s, when it was introduced to Bolivia by British railway workers. For many years, a factory in Italy manufactured such hats for the Bolivian market, but they are now made locally.[11]\n\nIn Norway, Hans Majestet Kongens Garde (the royal guards) wear plumed bowler hats as part of their uniform. It was copied from the hats of the Italian Bersaglieri troops; a regiment that so impressed the Swedish princess Louise that she insisted the Norwegian guards be similarly hatted in 1860.[12]\n\nIn the Philippines, bowler hats were known by its Spanish name sombrero hongo. Along with the native buntal hats, they were a common part of the traditional men's ensemble of the barong tagalog during the second half of the 19th century.[13]\n\nThe bowler hat was worn by the national hero of the Philippines, José Rizal, during his execution on 30 December 1896, and it is still seen as symbolic of the history of the Philippine Revolution.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bowler hat was famously used by actors such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Shemp Howard and Curly Howard; and by the fictional character John Steed of The Avengers, played by Patrick Macnee.[4]\n\nIn the 1964 film Mary Poppins, set in Edwardian London, 1910, the London banker George Banks (played by David Tomlinson) wears a bowler.[15]\n\nThe British bank Bradford & Bingley owns more than 100 separate trademarks featuring the bowler hat, its long-running logo.[16] In 1995 the bank purchased, for £2000, a bowler hat which had once belonged to Stan Laurel.[16]\n\nThe bowler is part of the Droog outfit that main character Alex wears in the film version of A Clockwork Orange to the extent that contemporary fancy dress costumes for this character refer to the bowler hat.[17][18]\n\nThere was a chain of restaurants in Los Angeles, California known as Brown Derby. The first and most famous of these was shaped like a derby.[19] A chain of Brown Derby restaurants in Ohio is still in business today.[citation needed]\n\nMany paintings by the Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte feature bowler hats.

The character of Captain Peacock is admonished for wearing a bowler when he is only entitled to a homburg, until Mr Grace, the store owner, insists that Peacock wear a bowler.\n\nIn the mid-1960s Batman TV series, the Penguin's band of \"fine feathered finks\" usually wear derby hats.
