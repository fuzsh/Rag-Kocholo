        "text": "The American West is symbolized by the trailblazing, sharpshooting, horseback-riding cowboy of American lore. Portrayed with the ubiquitous outfit of denim jeans with fringed chaps, boots with spurs & a plaid shirt. And though African-American cowboys don’t play a part in the popular narrative, historians estimate that one in four cowboys were black. This & other common tales about the cowboys of Hollywood legend aren't true:\n\nThey rarely fought Indians.\n\nThey were more likely to die from falling off a horse than in a gunfight.\n\nThey didn't wear those tall, wide-brimmed cowboy hats you see in Westerns.\n\nThe iconic Stetson came onto the market in 1865, and it wasn't popular until the end of the 19th century. A cowboy's preferred choice of hat? The Derby—also known as the Bowler.\n\nThe Bowler Hat is said to have been designed in 1849 by the London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler to fulfil an order placed by the hatters Lock & Co. A customer had commissioned the hat to design a close-fitting, low-crowned hat to protect gamekeepers from low-hanging branches while on horseback at the estate of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester. The keepers had previously worn top hats, which were knocked off easily and damaged. It is said that Europeans traveling to the colonies took these hats with them.\n\nFamous gunslinger and gambler Bat Masterson also favored the Derby. The classic photo of American West gunfighter Billy the Kid depicts the outlaw wearing what resembles a top hat. Wild Bill Hickok was photographed in a flat pancake hat. An 1882 photo of Jesse James shows the outlaw in a low-crowned cap with the sides of the brim upturned.\n\nMen commonly wore hats on the American frontier, and Derby hats were functional for various occasions. Most photographs from that time feature men wearing them, and one of the reasons they were popular is because they stayed on in windy conditions.\n\nFrontiersman typically wore hats related to their employment, and they were commonly made of beaver fur-felt and were natural in color. In addition to the Derby, men wore flat wool caps, Mexican sombreros, or old Civil War hats (such as the kepi)."
