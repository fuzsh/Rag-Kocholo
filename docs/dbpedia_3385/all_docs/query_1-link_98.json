        "text": "Floridians can look forward to some significant savings during the state's annual back-to-school sales tax holiday. This year's event spans two weeks, from Monday, July 29, to Sunday, August 11, 2024, offering tax exemptions on a wide range of items.\n\nThe holiday provides a break from Florida's usual 6 percent sales tax, helping families save on essential purchases as they prepare for the new school year.\n\nWhich items are exempt from sales tax?\n\nDuring this tax-free period, various items are exempt from sales tax, including clothing priced at $100 or less per item, school supplies costing $50 or less, and personal computers and tablets priced up to $1,500.\n\nAdditionally, learning aids and puzzles priced at $30 or less are also tax-exempt. Eligible items encompass a broad array of essentials, such as hats, shoes, shirts, pants, socks, backpacks, notebooks, pens, pencils, calculators, printers, keyboards, and more.\n\nWho items are excluded from sales tax?\n\nHowever, certain items are excluded from the tax exemption. Accessories like jewelry, watches, certain types of gloves, and specific clothing items such as umbrellas and non-prescription sunglasses are not eligible.\n\nElectronics exclusions include computer bags, CDs and DVDs, recreational-use computers, regular batteries, smartphones, surge protectors, tablet covers, game controllers, and digital cameras. Additionally, items like furniture, luggage, garment bags, and any rentals of eligible items are still taxable.\n\nPurchases made at theme parks, entertainment complexes, public lodging establishments, or airports are not covered by the tax exemption. This limitation is likely due to the holiday's primary aim of benefiting state residents.\n\nHow about online purchases?\n\nOnline purchases qualify for the tax exemption as long as they are shipped to a Florida address. Major online retailers, including Amazon, participate in the tax holiday."
