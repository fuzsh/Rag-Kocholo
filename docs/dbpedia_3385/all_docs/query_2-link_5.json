        "text": "What is the correct terminology? In the U.S., the most common term is “Native American,” but many people use or prefer “indigenous” or “American Indian.” On its website, the National Museum of the American Indian states that, “Native people prefer to be called by their specific tribal name.” Recognizing specific tribes and the differences between them honors the rich legacy of indigenous culture in our nation. Make it a habit to ask what term or tribe name a person prefers.\n\nIn the United States, there are 574 federally recognized Native American tribes, plus an estimated 400 more that are unrecognized, that speak nearly 200 different indigenous languages, making for an incredible diversity in culture and way of life. Unfortunately, Native American representation in popular culture has long been saddled with offensive stereotypes, caricatures and mascots. Depictions of Native American life and culture often homogenize and flatten it — if it is represented at all. But despite this lack of fair recognition, famous Native Americans are continuing to break barriers in science, politics, cooking, sports and more, including excelling as business owners and authors.\n\nOscar-winning actress Lily Gladstone made history by speaking Blackfoot language on the stage of the Academy Awards, while Poet Laureate Joy Harjo shares her powerful words every day. Sterlin Harjo brought indigenous culture to the screen with his show Reservation Dogs, while Link Wray influenced the development of rock and roll."
