        "text": "Former President Donald Trump formally accepted the Republican nomination for president for a third time on Thursday and thanked Americans for their support after he was injured and a man died in an assassination attempt at the former president's campaign rally last week.\n\nTrump vowed that \"our resolve is unbroken\" as he reflected on the shooting and called on Americans to unify after the attack.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,” Trump said in the beginning of his acceptance speech.\n\nStill, Trump took time to lay out his conservative vision for the country and criticize his Democratic rivals, knocking President Joe Biden's handling of the issues facing the nation. He also said Democrats should stop \"weaponizing the justice system,\" though there is no evidence that Democratic officials have affected the criminal charges the former president is facing.\n\nSome of Trump's most vocal allies took the stage on Thursday, from conservative commentator Tucker Carlson to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his son Eric Trump. Wrestling icon Hulk Hogan called the GOP nominee his \"hero,\" and UFC President Dana White introduced Trump ahead of his acceptance speech.\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network:\n\nTrump during his speech laid out key goals for a second presidency, saying that Americans should demand the best leadership in the world.\n\n“For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We’ve given everything to other nations, to other people,” Trump said. “You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families.” “I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough,” he continued. “It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless, and fearless. We can do that.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nThe crowd was pumped up when Trump came on stage after apperances by celebrities like Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock.\n\nBut what started as a contemplative speech has become somewhat rambling, with Trump veering off on tangents. He's still eliciting laughs, but the crowd seems less engaged − several are looking at their phones, some are beginning to leave and chants are far less frequent.\n\nIn the Michigan delegation, one delegate had to remind Republicans from the state to \"go nuts\" for the Trump's promise to save the auto industry. In the Minnesota section, a delegate left saying \"we can watch the stupid balloons on TV.\"\n\n− Riley Beggin, Clara Hendrickson and Sam Woodward\n\nDonald Trump's speech focused heavily on immigration, and the former president said he would re-implement several of his hardline border policies from his first term in office. Trump, who used dehumanizing language towards migrants, praised the GOP for codifying his campaign promise to “launch the largest deportation operation” in U.S. history.\n\nOn Day One, he said his administration will do two things: “Drill, baby, drill” and close the U.S.-Mexico border to immigrants.\n\nTrump made promises on a wide range of issues, saying he wants to provide additional resources to the U.S. military, address crime across cities and find cures for a variety of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. He also criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, claiming without evidence that he could “stop wars with a telephone call.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nFor the first time since the assassination attempt at his Pennsylvania rally, Trump addressed the shooting in person. He told convention attendees that they will never hear about the attack from him again because “it’s too painful to tell.”\n\nHe said that as he was discussing immigration that day, he turned his head slightly to see a chart of border crossings under his leadership when he heard a “loud whizzing sound” and he felt something hit him “really really hard.”\n\n“I said to myself ‘Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet’ and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down,” he said. “My hand was covered with blood, just absolutely blood all over the place.”\n\nHe praised the Secret Service agents who pulled him from the stage shortly after the gunman opened fire, saying that they were “very brave.”\n\n“Secret Service agents rushed to the stage and they really did - they rushed to the stage,” Trump said. “These are great people at great risk, I will tell you. They pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side.”\n\nSome lawmakers have been critical of the Secret Service agents’ actions that day, but Trump repeatedly praised them in his speech.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump during his acceptance speech honored Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed at his rally in Pennsylvania after a gunman opened fire.\n\n“He was incredible. He was a highly respected former fire chief − respected by everybody − was accompanied by his wife Helen. Incredible woman I spoke to today, devastated, and two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was.”\n\nA firefighter uniform that belonged to Comperatore appeared on stage with Trump. The former president also kissed Comperatore’s helmet and called for a moment of silence for the Pennsylvania man.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFact-checking RNC Day 4: What Trump, other speakers get right and wrong\n\nDonald Trump formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination Thursday, on the final day of the GOP convention.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,” Trump said in the beginning of his acceptance speech.\n\nUnity was a leading theme in Trump’s address, rewritten in the wake of the assassination attempt against him over the weekend.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nDonald Trump walked onto the convention stage with his last name in lights behind him. He also walked alongside a helmet and firefighter jacket that belonged to Corey Comperatore, the man who was killed in the shooting at the former president's rally on Saturday.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nUFC President Dana White described his 25-year relationship with Donald Trump as he introduced the former president, saying \"I know he wants what's best for the American people. All American people.\"\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nKid Rock performed on the convention stage on Thursday, encouraging Republicans in attendance to \"fight.\"\n\nIt's a clear reference to Donald Trump's reaction after the attack on his weekend campaign rally, when he told his supporters to \"fight\" after a gunman fired on the event.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump entered the convention floor wearing a red suit as a Beethoven symphony played.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nEric Trump, son of Donald Trump, praised his father’s achievements in a spirited speech to convention attendees, hitting on issues including the economy, foreign policy, immigration and other hot-button debates.\n\n“My father stands before you with the boost growth of any Republican candidate in the history of our nation,” Eric Trump said. “He has defied the predictions of every political pundit. He fills stadiums across our country. He energizes Americans to the issues facing this nation and does so with unvarnished honesty.”\n\n\"He is not a threat to democracy. He is a threat to those who despise our republic, many of whom are bought and sold,” he added.\n\nEric Trump also took a swipe at Democrats, alleging that they “tried everything to keep him from you, everything to destroy his legacy, to destroy his family.”\n\n“They have failed and they will not win,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nProfessional wrestler Hulk Hogan has one message for you, brother: Make America Great Again. Hogan brought the theatrics of the World Wrestling Entertainment to the RNC on Thursday by rushing on stage with an American flag before he gave his full backing to Trump.\n\n“Well, let me tell you something brother,” Hogan said, referencing the wrestlers’ iconic phrase, before comparing the energy in the room as how it felt at a Madison Square Garden event. Hogan said he came out to support Trump after the attempted assassination of the former president.\n\n“As an entertainer, I'm trying to stay out of politics,” said Hogan, whose government name is Terry Bollea. “But after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years, and everything that happened last weekend. I can no longer say silent.”\n\nHogan, who is in the WWE Hall of Fame like Trump, said the greatest tag team of his lifetime wasn’t between him and Randy Savage, another top professional wrestler, but between Trump and the United States.\n\nDuring his speech, Hogan ripped off his blazer and a black t-shirt that said “Real Americans” to unveil a red tank top with Trump and Vance’s names on it.\n\n“Let Trumpamania make America great again,” Hogan said, a play on WWE’s top live event, Wrestlemania. Hogan, whose followers were called Hulkamaniacs, referenced Trump’s supporters as “Trumpamaniacs.”\n\nWhat are you going to do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?” Hogan said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nFranklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said God “spared” Trump over the weekend against an attempted assassination.\n\n“I cannot explain why God would save one life and allow another one to be taken. I don’t have the answer for that,” the reverend said, referring to firefighter Corey Comperatore who was killed in the attack at Trump's Pennsylvania rally on Saturday.\n\nMultiple speakers have made divine allusions to explain Trump's survival over the weekend. Some have mentioned Comperatore as well.\n\nGraham included the Comperatore family in his prayer at the conclusion of his address.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nDonald Trump reentered the convention floor surrounded by his children and grandchildren, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who had not attended prior RNC events.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nReal estate baron Steven Witkoff spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday to highlight former President Donald Trump's integrity and empathy that people don't see on TV.\n\nSteven was introduced by his son Zach Witkoff, who said his father shares the same \"hard work, unwavering loyalty and perseverance\" as the GOP presidential nominee.\n\n\"An American Trilogy\" by Elvis Presley played as Steven took the podium arguing that the song captures who Trump is as a person, emphasizing the lyrics \"his truth is marching on.\" The business owner opened up about how Trump was there for him after his son, Andrew, died after an opioid overdose.\n\n− JJ Hensley\n\nFormer Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson took the stage Thursday and addressed the attempted assassination against Donald Trump looming over this week’s convention.\n\n“Everything was different after that moment,” Carlson said. “Everything: this convention is different, the nation is different, the world is different, Donald Trump is different.”\n\nThe TV personality said Trump not being severely wounded in the stunning attack was “divine intervention” and claimed the attempt transformed Trump.\n\n“I think it changed him,” Carlson said, noting that he reached out to the former president in the wake of the shooting.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nAlina Habba, one of Trump’s lawyers, criticized the criminal indictments against him in her remarks to convention attendees, alleging that the charges have been politicized.\n\n“Every attack on President Trump only strengthens our movement,” she said.\n\nThere is no evidence that the officials pursuing or overseeing charges against Trump have targeted his reelection bid.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCountry music singer Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany Kerr, appeared next to Trump in the MAGA friends and family box on the final night of the convention.\n\nAldean defended Trump on social media earlier this year, after the former president was convicted on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial.\n\nAnd the Aldeans' ties to Trump go back years; the couple attended his Mar-a-Lago New Year’s Eve party in 2022.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nLorenzo Sewell, an “everyday American\" and pastor in Detroit, praised Trump for visiting a Detroit church to woo Black voters on his birthday in June.\n\n“Let me ask you a question, Grand Old Party. What would you do for your birthday if you were worth $6.7 billion? What would you do for your birthday? Would you come to Detroit? Would you come into the Hood Hood? He came to the hood because he cares about average everyday Americans.”\n\nSewell, whose speech earned applause and cheers, added that there was a “miracle by a millimeter” last Saturday, when Trump was injured in an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania.\n\n“You cannot deny that it was a millimeter miracle that was able to save this man's life. Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for such a time as this?” he said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMike Pompeo, former secretary of state, took the stage Thursday and argued the country was safer under Donald Trump's administration.\n\n“In short, we put America first every single day,” Pompeo told the crowd, adding, “42 months on, what has Joe Biden and Kamala Harris done?”\n\nPompeo slammed the current administration over Biden’s current handling of the Israel-Hamas War and retreat from Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\n“Ladies and gentleman, President Biden sold out our citizens and our security and our sovereignty, and we need to get it back and I am confident that we will get it back,” Pompeo said.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nDonald Trump has entered the convention floor before he formally accepts the Republican nomination. He was again wearing a bandage over his right ear after he was injured in an assassination attempt.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nOne glance at the speaker schedule for the Republican National Convention this week shows that former President Donald Trump is trying hard to court “everyday Americans.”\n\nEach night of the GOP convention has featured speeches from voters who say they’re fed up with the status-quo and plan to support Trump in the fall. They’re billed by the Trump campaign as “everyday Americans.” And their messages are meant to resonate with the handful of undecided American voters in key swing states who Trump believes are key to winning the election.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nMore: Who are the 'everyday Americans' speaking at the RNC? A billionaire, Trump golf pro and more\n\nThe band playing at the RNC is in the spotlight on Monday during the first day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nAnd when the teleprompter experienced a malfunction, the band got to show off more of its set.\n\nBut that was OK for many since people were loving the country music band, Sixwire.\n\nHere's what to know about the band at the RNC.\n\nRead more here:Who is the band playing at the 2024 RNC in Milwaukee?\n\n– Christopher Kuhagen\n\nProfessional wrestler Hulk Hogan on Thursday said he can no longer stay silent on politics following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\n\n“When they took a shot at my hero, Donald Trump, I realized that I couldn't be silent anymore,” Hogan said in an interview with Fox News. “I had to step up. I had to be a real American just like all these real Americans here and Donald Trump.”\n\nHogan, who wrestled with the WWE, said Trump is the man who “loves everybody in America.”\n\n“This feels like the way America should be,” Hogan said of the convention. “It shouldn't be like this where there's love, there's hope, there's happiness, and there's success. And that's exactly what this country will find with Donald Trump.”\n\nTrump is in the WWE Hall of Fame and his former Atlantic City casino and hotel, Trump Plaza, hosted back-to-back WrestleManias, the top live event for WWE, in 1988 and 1989. Hogan competed in both events.\n\nHogan predicted Trump “without a doubt” will be the next U.S. president.\n\n“If I was a betting man, I would not bet against the Republicans,\" Hogan said. “I would not bet against Donald Trump or these real Americans that are in this room.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nWhen the organizers went looking for what they called \"everyday Americans\" to speak during the last night of the 2024 Republican National Convention, they didn't have to look far. They just hit the links.\n\nTwo of the speakers Thursday night, the final night of the RNC in Milwaukee, work at Trump golf properties. John Nieporte is the head golf pro at Trump International in West Palm Beach, and Carrie Ruiz is the golf general manager at Trump National Doral in Miami. But who better to talk about him?\n\n– C. A. Bridges\n\nEric Trump will speak between 8 and 9 p.m. CT. He is expected to tout his father’s accomplishments and encourage convention attendees to choose Donald Trump in November.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nThey gathered for the Republican National Convention to make Donald Trump their presidential nominee under the banner of \"Make America Great Once Again\" — a riff on the nostalgic slogan the former president used in his winning 2016 campaign.\n\nBut as Republicans hope to deliver another Trump victory, they rallied behind an unofficial theme as they look towards their party's future: realignment.\n\nThe Republican National Convention's speaker lineup highlights the party's attempts at racial diversity, and at events throughout the week, GOP stalwarts celebrated what they see as the shifting demographics of their party's coalition.\n\n– Clara Hendrickson\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday and recounted her time working with former president Donald Trump. You can watch her address here.\n\n– James Powel\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live stream of the 2024 RNC.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nThursday's batch of speakers at the RNC are beginning at about 5:30 CT, or 6:30 ET.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPeter Navarro, the former Director of United States Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, took the podium at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Wednesday to attack the Department of Justice, the judiciary and the Jan. 6 Committee in a sharp rebuke of calls of unity during the first high profile political event since the assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\n\nIn March, Navarro became the first Trump aide to be imprisoned for efforts related to trying to steal the 2020 election. He was sentenced to four months in prison for Contempt of Congress for refusing to testify to the January 6 committee.\n\nThe RNC crowd chanted, \"welcome home\" and \"fight\" before Navarro began his speech. The speech was Navarro's first public appearance since leaving a federal prison Wednesday morning.\n\n– JJ Hensley and Margie Cullen\n\nDonald Trump's first public speech since the failed assassination attempt against him highlights the final night of the Republican National Convention, and we'll be watching to let you know if he and the night's other speakers stray from the truth.\n\nIn addition to the shooting, Trump’s address is expected to cover topics including the GOP’s platform, election integrity and Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nFollow along as the USA TODAY Fact Check Team separates fact from fiction and adds important context if the speakers lack it.\n\nFact-checking RNC Day 4: What Trump, other speakers get right and wrong\n\n– USA TODAY Fact Check Team\n\nVice President Kamala Harris at a rally in North Carolina Thursday said Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance’s speech Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention was a “compelling story” but “not the full story.”\n\n“Frankly, what is very telling is what he did not talk about on that stage. He did not talk about Project 2025,\" referencing the sweeping conservative agenda put together by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nHarris added later that if you claim to stand for unity, you “need to do more than just use the word.”\n\n“You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity and dignity,” she said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nThe families of service members killed in a suicide bombing at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan in 2021 gave emotional remarks about losing their loved ones on Wednesday. They also criticized Joe Biden's handling of the attack and complimented Donald Trump's response.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nFor the 2024 election, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are the swing states crucial for both campaigns.\n\nRepublicans are hoping that Ohio Sen. JD Vance as Donald Trump’s running mate can help the party’s chances in the rust belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nJD Vance will speak to his hometown in Ohio Monday as he launches his vice-presidential campaign.\n\nVance is scheduled to speak in Middletown, Ohio, one week after Donald Trump selected the 39-year-old senator to be his running mate. During his acceptance speech Wednesday, Vance shared his life story to millions of Americans and tied his upbringing to Trump’s policies.\n\nIn Middletown, Vance and his family wrestled with poverty, drug addiction and domestic abuse. His childhood was the subject of his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nVance kicked off his Senate campaign in Middletown in 2021.\n\n– Haley BeMiller\n\nDuring the third night of the Republican National Convention, Usha Vance took on a new, loftier task: Introducing her husband, and herself, to the country in a primetime speech.\n\n“That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country,” she said.\n\nThe Vances have been thrust into national prominence this week after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named Ohio's junior senator as his running mate. Her national coming out has prompted a largely supportive reception, even as some far-right personalities have circulated racist commentary denigrating her Indian heritage.\n\n– Haley BeMiller and Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nOrganizers for the Republican National Convention raised more than $85 million in donations from companies, organizations, and individuals, surpassing their initial goal of $70 million.\n\nHere's a snapshot of some of the convention's contributors.\n\n– Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nThe last night of the Republican convention is expected to include a rare sighting: Former first lady Melania Trump.\n\nMelania Trump, who has been mostly absent from the 2024 campaign trail, is scheduled to attend the convention and sit in the family box as the former president delivers his acceptance speech.\n\nAlso expected to be in attendance: Daughter Ivanka Trump, who has also stayed away from the campaign, but recently posted a tribute to her father.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he called the White House on Thursday morning to ask President Joe Biden to fire Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Johnson though did not get to speak with the president, he said in an interview at an event hosted by CNN and Politico.\n\nLawmakers will receive a classified briefing next week from Secret Service and the FBI about the shooting, but Johnson called on the administration to declassify classified information for the American public to know.\n\n“If you let questions hover over this, it’s a dangerous thing,” Johnson said, noting that conspiracy theories can “flourish.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDemocratic party officials are preparing for this year's Democratic National Convention, which will take place later this summer. The convention will start on Monday, Aug. 19, and run through Thursday, Aug. 22.\n\n– Raphael Romero Ruiz\n\nWill calls for increased political unity in the wake of Saturday's shooting trickle down to state politics?\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee, chair of the Republican Governors Association, said Thursday he thinks the tragic incident \"stirred within a lot of people the hope that we could move toward a more unified place.\"\n\nLee has long called for increased civility in politics, collaborating with Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, chair of the National Governors Association, earlier this year on Cox's initiative to encourage Americans to \"Disagree Better.\"\n\nCox has taken heat from the left and his GOP primary opponent for his effort to combat political polarization. The Utah governor has refused to vote for Trump, whose divisive rhetoric has often devolved into personal mockery.\n\nLee, a Trump supporter who took to the RNC stage earlier this week, said he's \"hopeful that there may be a turn going forward\" in the tenor of political rhetoric.\n\n\"Trump has signaled his desire for that,\" Lee said, noting President Biden has done the same. \"Let's tone it down and remind ourselves what really matters.\"\n\n— Melissa Brown\n\nRepublican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance is scheduled to visit Fort Wayne, Indiana, next week, just days after the close of the Republican National Convention.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Monday tapped Vance, the U.S. Senator from Ohio, as his running mate for his 2024 campaign. Trump’s previous running mate in 2016 and 2020 was former Vice President Mike Pence of Indiana.\n\nAllen County Republican Party Chair Steve Shine confirmed to IndyStar that Vance will visit Fort Wayne on Wednesday. Shine said specifics of the appearance are still being solidified.\n\n“We are very honored to have someone of such national prominence so soon out of the gate after the convention to come visit Fort Wayne in Allen County,” Shine told IndyStar on Thursday. “It substantiates the fact that Allen County is a Republican hotbed for the state of Indiana.”\n\n— Brittany Carloni\n\nThe primary target of badgering during many of the speeches at the Republican National Convention hasn't been President Joe Biden — it's been his second-in-command.\n\nBiden has been facing a wave of Democratic Party dissenters, but after news Wednesday night that he tested positive for COVID — just hours after saying a medical condition is the only thing that could pull him from the ticket — the attention increasingly has focused on Vice President Kamala Harris as his potential replacement.\n\nHarris repeatedly took hits during high-profile Republican speeches in Milwaukee during the convention as speculation over her potential takeover grows, and the GOP strategy for winning in November evolves.\n\nRead more on how Republicans are ramping up criticism of Harris.\n\n— Sam Woodward and Melissa Brown\n\nDonald Trump will take the RNC stage Thursday night, along with a cadre of celebrities, his former administration officials and everyday Americans. Here’s a look at the big names to watch out for:\n\nMike Pompeo, former Secretary of State under Trump\n\nEric Trump\n\nTucker Carlson, founder of Tucker Carlson Network\n\nHulk Hogan, professional entertainer and wrestler\n\nDana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship\n\nFranklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDay 4 lineup: Who is speaking at RNC Day 4? Donald Trump takes the stage with these celebrity guests\n\nBiden-Harris 2024 Deputy Campaign Manager Quentin Fulks said he had planned to lead off a Thursday morning news conference by talking about Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance’s Wednesday night speech. But he said it was so “boring,” there was not much to say.\n\n“He might not have inspired a single American to vote for him,” Fulks said. “But he did provide a picture-perfect contrast between himself. He is a spineless backbencher desperate for Trump's approval. And our own Vice President Kamala Harris is a powerful leader and a terrific partner to President Biden.”\n\nVance, a U.S. senator from Ohio, took the podium at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee Wednesday night to officially accept his place on the ballot.\n\n— Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nThe morning after news outlets reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told President Joe Biden that he cannot defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump and is dragging down the rest of the Democratic ticket, Biden-Harris 2024 Deputy Campaign Manager Quentin Fulks said the president is not wavering on whether to drop out of the race.\n\n“Our campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee,” he said.\n\nPressed further by reporters, Fulks reiterated that Biden’s decision to stay in the race is firm.\n\n“I talk to the president every day, like I said. He is not wavering on anything,” Fulks said. “The president has made his decision. I don't want to be rude, but I do not know how many more times we can answer that. Joe Biden has said he is running for President of the United States. Our campaign is moving forward with drawing a vision of contrast between that of Project 2025 and what we have seen for the past three days here in Milwaukee.”\n\n— Brianne Pfannentiel\n\nBiden-Harris 2024 Deputy Campaign Manager Quentin Fulks said during a news conference in Milwaukee Wednesday morning that President Joe Biden is “feeling fine” as he continues to self-isolate in Delaware after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\n“The President's feeling fine,” Fulks said. “He is self-isolating in Delaware. He's continuing to make calls and do work. He has some official meetings today, a lot of campaign calls that he's getting through, I think, some zoom calls that he's hopping on, potentially.”\n\nBiden tested positive Wednesday after an event in Las Vegas.\n\n“I know President Biden well,” said U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who is also serving on the Biden-Harris national advisory board. “He's not skipping to beat. He had to isolate a little bit because of COVID. And that shouldn't surprise anybody. ... COVID numbers are up. It's part of our new reality.”\n\n— Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nBrutal split screen: Biden holed up with COVID while Trump accepts nomination\n\nDonald Trump Jr. questioned who is really running the country during his RNC speech Wednesday, alluding to concerns about President Joe Biden’s age and mental acuity after his poor debate performance last month.\n\n“Is it Jill? Is it Hunter? Barack Obama?,” Trump Jr. asked. \"Maybe it’s the ghost of Cornpop,”\n\nWho is Cornpop? The reference refers to a story Biden tells about an encounter he had with a Delaware gang member named William Morris, whose nickname was Cornpop, while working as a swimming pool security guard one summer.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nMany Republican convention delegates like to salute the heritage of their party, but few of them these days talk about the next-to-last GOP president, George W. Bush.\n\nAnd that suits Bush just fine.\n\nFor while Bush still keeps up with politics - including the resurgence of Republican successor and fervent critic Donald Trump - he doesn't like to talk about it publicly.\n\nIn paid private speeches, the long-retired 43rd president has been known to joke that both Trump and President Joe Biden are too old for the demands of the office.\n\nRead more on the Bush political dynasty and the current Republican Party.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nWhat does Trump 2024 smell like?\n\nApples, vanilla, with a slight note of cinnamon.\n\nAt least that's what the Trump 2024: Make American Great candle would have you believe – for sale this week at a merchandise table at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe Republican Party faithful have snapped up snarky T-shirts, MAGA hats and elephant pins at the political event that has taken over downtown Milwaukee.\n\nWhile staid official merchandise in simple reds, whites and blues are for sale, many are flocking to the sideline booths to pick up lapel pins dripping with rhinestones and new T-shirts, hot off the presses, featuring a bloodied Donald Trump photographed after Saturday's assassination attempt.\n\nRead more on all the merchandise for sale at the RNC.\n\n— Melissa Brown\n\n'Actual poetic genius?' Donald Trump's social media posts sold as poetry at GOP convention\n\nLatino voters in the United States are crucial to cementing a conservative voting majority for the next generation, according to Latino Republican and conservative operatives at the Republican National Convention.\n\nWith the Nov. 5 general election more than 100 days away, they’re detailing plans for aggressive engagement efforts beyond traditional conservative circles such as South Florida, home to historically Republican-leaning Latino voters whose origins trace to socialist-led countries in Latin America.\n\nOperatives say they will focus their resources on 21 battleground counties around the U.S. with significant Latino voter populations.\n\nThose include two of the fastest growing areas in the country: Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metro area and is home to most of the state's voters, and Nevada’s Clark County, home to sprawling Las Vegas.\n\nRead more on the GOP's outreach efforts.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nThere's a mystery guest for Donald Trump's acceptance speech: Former first lady Melania Trump.\n\nThe low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities.\n\nShe has no public schedule.\n\nMelania Trump has rarely be seen in public during her husband's 2024 campaign; she did issue a lengthy written statement after Saturday's assassination attempt.\n\n“A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,” she wrote.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC guests: Melania Trump not seen at RNC through first three days, will she appear Thursday?\n\nJD Vance, introducing himself to the American people for the first time Wednesday night, wanted to make this much clear: He's not a pol.\n\nHe is the survivor of a childhood marked by violence and his mother's drug addiction. He is a Marine veteran, a husband and father, an entrepreneur, an author whose Hillbilly Elegy told the story of the decline of his grandparents' Appalachia with such pathos that it became a national bestseller and a Netflix movie.\n\nPol or not, though, James David Vance has scored one of the fastest rises in modern American politics of anyone not named Trump.\n\nRead more on how JD Vance used his speech to introduce himself to a national audience.\n\n— Susan Page\n\nWatch: JD Vance’s full speech at 2024 Republican National Convention\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will have that big bandage on his ear tonight as he delivers his speech formally accepting the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to daughter-in-law Lara Trump.\n\nLara Trump, who is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also told CBS News’ morning show that her father is not on medication.\n\nTrump’s ear bandage has become an icon at the Republican convention. Some delegates have bandaged their own ears in solidarity.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nConvicted but never imprisoned, Donald Trump and his reputation have nonetheless been locked in place in the minds of many Americans after eight fractious years of turmoil, impeachments, insurrection and criminal charges.\n\nThe attempt on his life may give him the best chance at breaking free, offering a kind of political parole from voters sympathetic to the bandage on his bullet-grazed ear, and possibly a second look from those who normally oppose him, all while elevating his reputation with true believers to near martyr status.\n\nFor three days here at the Republican National Convention, Trump's family, surrogates and supporters have said the shooting changed the 78-year-old former president, giving him a new outlook; that he tore up an aggressive speech aimed at dismantling his opponent's administration in favor of one aimed at national unity.\n\nTrump's remarks Thursday night will be the first time Americans will have a chance to hear if his change of tone has stuck.\n\nRead more on whether views of the former president are changing.\n\n— Zac Anderson and Sarah D.

Bailey\n\nGeorge Conway, a prominent anti-Trump Republican, launched a new political action committee called the Anti-Psychopath PAC on Thursday to portray Donald Trump as a danger to democracy and mentally unfit for a second term.\n\nThe PAC is running 10 billboards around the RNC in Milwaukee that read: “Thanks for nominating a CONVICTED FELON,” and a billboard truck that says “Thanks for nominating a PSYCHO.” Trump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial.\n\nConway, who also founded the Lincoln Project, told USA TODAY that he isn’t worried about being accused by the Trump campaign of targeting incendiary political rhetoric at the former president after the assassination attempt against him.\n\n“We expect Trump and his allies to accuse us of anything they can think of,” Conway said in a statement. “We condemn violence in all its forms. But we won't back away from calling out the danger that a second Trump term poses to America. Facts are facts.\"\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance, 39, is a first-term senator from Ohio, who skyrocketed to fame after publishing his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nVance was first elected to the Senate in 2022 with no prior political experience, but he had widespread name recognition in light of his bestselling book. “Hillbilly Elegy,” later turned into a Netflix feature film, detailed Vance’s journey from a childhood riddled with abuse to a Yale Law School degree that opened doors for him in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile Vance was previously critical of Trump, at one point comparing him to an opioid and saying he could be “America’s Hitler,” he changed his tune ahead of his 2022 Senate race. Since then, Vance has become a loyal ally to Trump. He is also close with one of Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n— Haley BeMiller and Riley Beggin\n\nVance and his faith: Will JD Vance's religious background sway Catholic voters? What experts say.\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump’s 17-year-old granddaughter, told convention attendees that she sees a side of her grandfather that most people don’t see.\n\n“He calls me during the middle of the school day to ask how my golf game is going and tells me all about his… even when he's going through all these court cases, he always asks me how I'm doing. He always encourages me to push myself to be the most successful person I can be. Obviously, he sets the bar pretty high but who knows, maybe one day I'll catch him.”\n\nShe said she was “shocked” when she heard the former president had been injured in a shooting on Saturday at his Pennsylvania rally.\n\n“I just wanted to know if he was okay,” she said. “It was heartbreaking that someone would do that to another person. A lot of people put my grandpa through hell, and he's still standing.\"\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi"
