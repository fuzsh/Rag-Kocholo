        "text": "Our History\n\nStarted In a Soup Pot, Now We’re Here\n\nWe’ve come a long way, friends. From humble basement beginnings all the way to national recognition, it has been a journey jam-packed with innovation and expansion. Here’s a sort-of succinct history of the universe, or at least the parts of it that relate to Bell’s.\n\n1985\n\nBell’s First Beer\n\n1976-1985\n\nFrom Homebrew Shop to Brewery\n\nBell’s Brewery is deeply rooted in homebrewing, our community, and sharing our craft with beer lovers old and new. Coming to Kalamazoo to attend Kalamazoo College, Larry Bell started homebrewing in the early 1980s and opened a homebrew supply shop in Downtown Kalamazoo in 1983. As more and more people were requesting samples of his beer, Larry began brewing commercially in a 15 gallon soup pot and opened Kalamazoo Brewing Co., which sold its first beer on Sept. 19, 1985.\n\n1990\n\nBig Milestone\n\n1995\n\nBeer Garden\n\n2000\n\nHey, Comstock!\n\n2005\n\nMore Growth\n\n2010\n\nMany Firsts\n\n2015\n\nBest & Brightest\n\n2020\n\nA New Chapter\n\n1985\n\nFirst Brewed: Amber Ale\n\nThe first Great Lakes Amber Ale (now known as Amber Ale) was brewed. For many local beer drinkers, this was the first craft beer they had and because of its early popularity, it’s still referred to as the “beer that built the brewery.”\n\n1986\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\nBeer production reached 135 barrels (1 barrel = 31 gallons). Originally self-distributed, Larry and a staff of nine others bottled and delivered everything for the next four years.\n\nFirst Brewed: Third Coast Beer\n\nAn homage to the Great Lakes coastline, Third Coast Beer was crafted before the craft beer market really took hold in the United States. People were afraid of beer called “ale.” Even though it was technically a Pale Ale, it was dubbed a “beer” to be more approachable. TCB went to Larry’s Library in 2017.\n\n1987\n\nFirst Brewed: Porter\n\nOur award-winning Porter bridges the gap between malty brown ales and heavily roasted stouts. Notes of chocolate, coffee and roasted barley are offset with just a slight hop bitterness. A perfect beer for all seasons!\n\n1988\n\nFirst Brewed: Kalamazoo Stout\n\nThe first Kalamazoo Stout, an American stout and one of our most classic recipes, was brewed.\n\n1988\n\nFirst Brewed: Best Brown Ale\n\nThe first Best Brown Ale was brewed. A deep malt body and American hop profile helps this beer bridge the gap between lighter-bodied beers and malty stouts.\n\n1988\n\nFirst Brewed: Cherry Stout\n\nThe first Cherry Stout was brewed, crafted with 100% Montmorency cherries grown in Michigan’s Traverse City region. Beers with adjuncts (non-malt sources of fermentable sugar) were uncommon at this point in time.\n\n1988\n\nFirst Brewed: Double Cream Stout\n\nThe first Special Double Cream Stout was brewed. Named after its smooth, creamy texture, this beer is brewed with ten different specialty grains and is completely dairy-free.\n\n1988\n\nFirst Brewed: Third Coast Ale\n\nThe first Third Coast Old Ale was brewed. An American barley wine, this beer is named after America’s “Third Coast” which surrounds the Great Lakes.\n\n1989\n\nFirst Distributor\n\nAt this time Bell’s was brewing so much (more than 500 barrels annually) that we needed a partner to help spread our products across Michigan. Rave Associates, based in Ann Arbor, became our first wholesaler and brought Bell’s to all corners of the state. In modern times, Bell’s has more than 200 distributors across the country.\n\nFirst Brewed: Expedition Stout\n\nOne of the earliest examples of Russian Imperial Stouts in the United States, our first Expedition Stout was brewed in 1989. It is now the longest-brewed Imperial Stout in the United States.\n\n1990\n\nFirst Pour: Indiana\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\nBrewing capacity increases with the installation of a 2-barrel brew system.\n\nFirst Pour: Wisconsin\n\n1991\n\nBell’s Gets Eccentric\n\nBell’s celebrated its first Eccentric Day. At first a private party for employees, it grew over the years to be one of the most epic parties in craft beer. Every year guests are encouraged to “come as you aren’t” and showcase your “too weird for work” alter ego (the side of you that would never show up at the office). It’s a day of food, beers, and music celebrating inspiration, individuality, and creativity.\n\nStaffing Up\n\nAt this time, Bell’s had five full-time employees.\n\nFirst Pour: Illinois\n\n1992\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\nA long way from the original soup kettle, a larger, 15-barrel brew system was installed. We still brew on this system to this day.\n\nFirst Brewed: Oberon\n\nFirst brewed as SolSun, Oberon Ale started a revolution in craft beer. It became one of the most iconic brands and introduced a whole generation of beer drinkers to craft. Oberon release day has become an annual celebration of friends, the approach of warmer weather, and the start of baseball season.\n\n1993\n\nJune 11\n\nEccentric Café Officially Opens\n\nBell’s became the first Michigan brewery to open an onsite pub, the Eccentric Café at 355 E. Kalamazoo Ave, after Larry worked with the Michigan Legislature to change state law regarding breweries selling beer in tap rooms.\n\n1994\n\nMichael Jackson Pays a Visit\n\nThe acclaimed beer and whiskey writer (not the other guy) visited what was then known solely as the Kalamazoo Brewing Company, which helped boost the reputation of the young brewery.\n\nFirst Brewed: Bell’s Pale Ale\n\nOne of the earliest Bell’s beers, Pale Ale was renamed Midwestern Pale Ale in 2012. That recipe used barley from the Bell’s Farm (no longer affiliated with the brewery) in Shepherd, Michigan and the original label featured a painting of the barn and silo by a local Kalamazoo artist.\n\n1996\n\nBeer Garden in Bloom\n\nThis outdoor space beside the Eccentric Café officially made its debut. It has grown by leaps and bounds ever since, hosting events and concerts by popular artists such as Bruce Hornsby, George Clinton, Billy Strings, Greensky Bluegrass, and Kurt Vile.\n\n1997\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\nA brand new 30-barrel system gets installed.\n\nFirst Brewed: Two Hearted\n\nThe first version of Two Hearted debuted in the late 1980s as a Pale Ale brewed with English malt and Wisconsin-grown hops (the two “hearts”). The Two Hearted we know and love today debuted in 1997 as a winter seasonal. In 2003, it became a year round offering and surpassed Oberon as Bell’s best-seller in 2013.\n\n2001\n\nComstock, Here We Come\n\nBell’s purchased five acres in Comstock Township, Michigan, seven miles east from Bell’s original downtown Kalamazoo brewery. This new land soon became the home of Bell’s main brewery. The Kalamazoo location continues to brew experimental and exclusive beers for the Eccentric Café and is open for tours.\n\nFirst Brewed: Java Stout\n\n2002\n\nDecember\n\nComstock Construction Complete\n\nEquipment was moved in at Bell’s new Comstock brewery and the first beer was brewed.\n\n2003\n\nFirst Brewed: Winter White Ale\n\nThe first Winter White Ale (now Bright White Ale) was brewed.\n\nComstock Brewery Open for Business\n\nBell’s Comstock brewery opened about seven miles east of Kalamazoo on a 32-acre site. The original footprint was just over 35,000 square feet. The construction brought John Mallett to Bell’s, who would oversee brewery operations for the coming decades.\n\nKeg Line Installed\n\nOur Comstock Brewery received an additional way to package Bell’s beer through keg line automation.\n\n2004\n\nFirst Brewed: Hopslam Ale\n\nThe first Hopslam Ale was brewed.\n\n2005\n\nNew Brewery, New Growth\n\nOur Comstock Brewery expanded for the first time, but not the last. Construction continued in stages from here on out.\n\n2006\n\nQuality Focus\n\nAn Anton Paar instrument for measuring alcohol, density, and estimating calories was installed in the Bell’s Quality Lab.\n\nFirst Brewed: Lager of the Lakes\n\nLager of the Lakes, our year-round bohemian-style pilsner, was first brewed.\n\nFirst Brewed: Octoberfest\n\nSpending a full six weeks fermenting, the first Octoberfest Beer was brewed as a flavorful session beer perfect for fest season.\n\nFirst Brewed: Consecrator Doppelbock\n\nThe first Consecrator Doppelbock, a traditional doppelbock and Bell’s General Store exclusive, was brewed.\n\n2007\n\nCellar Expansion\n\nThe first fermentation cellar expansion at the Comstock brewery was announced.\n\nFirst Brewed: Black Note Stout\n\nBlack Note, one of the most sought-after stouts in Bell’s history, was first brewed.\n\nFirst Brewed: Bourbon Barrel Aged Expedition Stout\n\nA 12-month barrel-aged version of our award-winning Expedition Stout, Bourbon Barrel Aged Expedition Stout was first brewed.\n\n2008\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\nMore than\n\n100,000\n\nbarrels shipped in one year.\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\n100,000+\n\nBARRELS\n\nFirst Brewed: Hopsoulution\n\nThe first Hopsoulution Ale was brewed.\n\nFirst Brewed: Christmas Ale\n\nOur holiday-themed Scotch ale was first brewed.\n\n2010\n\nFirst Brewed: Oarsman Ale\n\nOarsman Ale grew out of a desire to explore the tradition of session beers, trading intensity for finesse while still creating a flavorful experience. A groundbreaking beer when it was released, Oarsman was removed from our year-round lineup in 2019 and is currently retired.\n\nFirst Brewed: The Oracle\n\nThe Oracle was developed from a one-off batch brewed for the Craft Brewers Conference that was called “Big Head San Diego Style Ale”.\n\nLarry Bell wins Brewers Association Recognition Award\n\nLarry was honored at the 2010 Brewers Association Achievement Awards for Bell’s innovative brewing and dedication to the industry including acting as a driving force with then Denver mayor (now US senator) John Hickenlooper for the creation of American Beer Month (now American Craft Beer Week).\n\n2011\n\nThe Eccentric Cafe Reopens\n\nAfter $3 million in renovations, our Eccentric Café reopened, transformed into a state-of-the-art music venue with expanded restrooms, additional seating options, a transformed Beer Garden, a new patio, and a new main entryway.\n\n2012\n\nFirst Brewed: Smitten\n\nGolden Rye Ale (now known as Smitten) was originally part of a series of rye beers released in 2010, and it was part of our seasonal lineup (spring release) from 2013 through 2017. It returns on occasion as a draft option.\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\n200,000 barrels shipped in one year.\n\nNew Brewhouse\n\nThis expansion included a brand new American-made 200-barrel brewhouse, fourteen 400-barrel dry hop fermenters for Two Hearted, as well as grain storage and geothermal field installations.\n\n2013\n\nApr. 25\n\nIntroducing Upper Hand Brewery\n\nConstruction began on our first ever sister brewery, Upper Hand Brewery in Escanaba, located within Michigan’s upper peninsula.\n\nFirst Brewed: Sparkleberry\n\nThe first Sparkleberry, an American interpretation of a Belgian-style tripel brewed with raspberries, was released at Kalamazoo Pride in 2013 to celebrate our sponsorship of the event.\n\nFirst Pour: New York\n\nQuality Focus\n\nOur first full-time microbiologist is hired as part of the Bell’s quality team.\n\n2014\n\nCan Line Installed, Hop Yard Planted\n\nUpper Hand Begins Brewing\n\nUpper Hand Brewery, a division of Bell’s and an entirely separate sister brewery offering a completely different line of beers in Michigan’s upper peninsula, officially opened for business.\n\nBrewing Milestone\n\n300,000 barrels were shipped in one year.\n\nExpansion\n\nThe first of our 800-barrel fermenters was installed.\n\n2015\n\nFirst Pour: Louisiana\n\nQuality Focus\n\nConstruction in Comstock continued—the Cube (a.k.a. our waste water treatment facility) came online.
