Parent History

Oracle was co-founded by Larry Ellison with Bob Miner and Ed Oates in 1977. Originally the company was named as Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison taking an inspiration from the paper written by Edgar F Codd on Relational Database Management System RDBMS , Ellison wanted to make Oracle’s product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979 and finally to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983. Today with more than 136,000 employees oracle has presence across more than 155 countries serving more than 1400 customers.
