According to industry experts, a bachelor's degree in computer science, electrical engineering, business, accounting, or computer engineering is often preferred. Additionally, certifications such as the Oracle Certified Associate - Oracle9i Database Administrator, Oracle B2B Service 2021 Certified Implementation Specialist Certification, and Oracle Certified Professional - Oracle 9i Database Administrator can significantly enhance the prospects of a candidate. While a high school diploma or a certificate program can provide a basic understanding, an associate's or master's degree is more common in this field. Top schools known for producing successful oracle functional consultants include Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Harvard University, Duke University, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOracle functional consultants use a variety of skills on a day-to-day basis.

Other skills include configuring setups, creating custom enhancements, and direct end-user support for Oracle e-business suite applications.\n\nOracle functional consultants are responsible for gathering requirements, designing reports and forms, and defining users and assigning responsibilities.
