        "text": "Business rules are becoming unruly, as frequent changes in the marketplace and new regulations create more complexity. Some companies are turning to business rules management software, which organizes the process of implementing code changes and even lets business people make those changes, freeing up IT to work on more strategic initiatives.\n\nWhile that sounds like good news for hard-pressed IT departments, there are potential dangers to letting business managers and other nontechnical people tinker with the insides of key information systems.\n\nBusiness rules are the business logic built into systems. They describe core policies and operations and define what can and can’t be done for processes such as marketing, sales, distribution or billing. A company’s marketing strategy, pricing plan and administrative policies are examples of processes that include business rules.\n\nRules management software is changing the way companies handle revisions to the rules inside applications. Bob Parker, an analyst at AMR Research Inc., says enabling business people to make rules changes gives companies more flexibility. For example, he says, if an air-conditioner manufacturer wants to reconfigure its product design, pricing or service, the company doesn’t have to rely on IT to make the business rules changes, because a manufacturing or salesperson can do it. “You not only free up IT resources, you gain flexibility to respond to changes faster,” Parker says. “It’s been a big hurdle for companies to change rules in response to market conditions.”\n\nCitiStreet in Quincy, Mass., a global benefits services provider owned by Citigroup and State Street Corp., is using JRules from Ilog Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., to make rules changes in its benefits plan administration system. The proprietary application runs on Sun Solaris and HP-UX platforms.\n\nJRules manages thousands of business rules related to client policies, government regulations and customer preferences. Previously, business analysts wrote requirements, designers created documents based on the requirements, and IT developers did the coding. But now analysts use JRules to create or change rules, without help from developers, says Andy Marsh, CitiStreet’s CIO. “We’ve effectively eliminated the detail design function and 80% of the development function,” says Marsh. IT is involved in managing the systems and platforms, but it’s less involved in rules management, he says.\n\nThe software helps speed processes. For example, it used to take CitiStreet six months to set up benefit plan calculations for clients; it now takes three months, says Marsh.\n\nCitiStreet can also react more quickly to market changes and new regulations. It has used the software to accommodate changes in pension and 401(k) programs required by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. And when a client recently adopted a cash-balance plan in its benefits program, CitiStreet was able to more easily implement changes with JRules, says Marsh.\n\nMore Options for IT\n\nBut companies with IT departments that still handle rules coding are also benefiting from using business rules software. Alfa Insurance Group in Montgomery, Ala., uses Computer Associates International Inc.’s CleverPath Aion Business Rules Expert for an automobile insurance underwriting system. A rules process change that typically took five or six days now takes about 30 minutes, says David Seay, systems manager. Although the application is used by sales representatives to provide quotes and submit applications, most of the rules changes are done by programmers.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is using AppsRules from Logical Apps Inc. in Irvine, Calif., to change rules settings for Oracle applications. IT manager Vincent Tee says the MTA uses the software primarily to abide by procurement regulations set by the Federal Transit Administration, its largest funder. AppsRules has slashed the average time it takes to make rules changes from three hours to 10 minutes – and paid for itself within six months, Tee says.\n\n“A sophisticated [business user] who knows the system could make the changes,” Tee says, but IT usually does it because of “change-control” policies.\n\nIn fact, some experts suggest using caution in letting business users make systems changes. “You have to make sure the appropriate levels of authority are maintained,” says AMR’s Parker. “You don’t want Billy who’s just been hired out of college deciding that if it’s a pretty girl ordering a product, you give a 50% discount. An entitlement process has to be put in place as soon as you allow this to be decentralized.” Parker says IT should be responsible for deciding who can make changes.\n\n“It will be very interesting to see just how much of a free hand in setting business policy companies will ever be willing to give users,” says Ronald Ross, principal at Business Rule Solutions LLC, a Houston-based business rule services firm. “The appropriate roles and responsibilities need to be thought out carefully.”\n\nIT managers say the technology has potential downsides. Marsh says there could be greater risk of errors in programs with nontechnical people making the changes. “The way [for IT] to mitigate that is to have a test bed to run the rule set against to make sure you haven’t introduced unforeseen problems,” he says."
