        "text": "The week ended October 12 saw two software giants making the biggest splash in the acquisition scene, with Germany-based SAP AG revealing a $6.7 billion definitive agreement on Sunday to buy intelligence software maker Business Objects. SAP's rival Oracle Corp. on Friday disclosed an unsolicited offer worth almost the same amount for business-management software maker BEA Systems, Inc. While the former deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008, the latter might trigger off a bidding war, as BEA Systems has indicated that Oracle's offer is low.\n\nNewmont Mining Corp., which is trying to increase its reserves in the context of rising gold prices, on Tuesday revealed an agreement to buy Canadian gold company Miramar Mining Corp. for about C$1.5 billion. In another deal, NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric Co., agreed to purchase Oxygen Media to strengthen its position in the lucrative female demographic.\n\nAmong others, technology solutions provider Textron Inc., mobile phone service provider Vodafone Group plc and telecommunication services provider AT&T Inc. also revealed acquisition agreements.\n\nSAP to acquire Business Objects for $6.7 bln\n\nLate Sunday, German software company SAP AG (SAP) revealed an agreement to acquire French business intelligence software maker Business Objects (BOBJ) in a 4.8 billion euro or $6.7 billion deal. The acquisition will be made through an open tender offer that values each share of Business Objects at 42 euros.\n\nIt appeared in the columns of French newspaper Le Figaro on September 17 that Business Objects hired Goldman Sachs to find a buyer for the company, sending the stock up over 7%. SAP was quoted as one among the five interested in a deal. On Monday, SAP stock fell the most in eight months to close 4.78% lower at 39.87 euros in Frankfurt, while Business Objects surged 17.34% to 41.07 euros in Paris.\n\nThe offer price represents a 20% premium over Business Objects' closing price on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008. It will be accretive to SAP's earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis in 2009 and beyond.\n\nHowever, due to acquisition-related one-time effects in 2008, SAP, the world's largest maker of business-management software, expects the transaction to be dilutive by mid-single digits Euro cents to its earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis in fiscal year 2008.\n\nFor the 35-year-old company, the purchase is the biggest in its history. The acquisition is in line with SAP's strategy of doubling its market by 2010. Additionally, business intelligence is a fast growing market and Business Objects already has nearly 44000 corporate clients, including Walt Disney Co. and Unilever NV, for it business intelligence tools that help track the performance of companies.\n\nSAP has so far been concentrating on growth sans acquisitions. However, SAP's competitor Oracle Corp. (ORCL) recently acquired Hyperion, a peer of Business Objects, for $3.3 billion, which probably had an effect on SAP.\n\nOvum analysts David Bradshaw and Helena Schwenk reportedly said in a research note that SAP's move was in retaliation to Oracle buying Hyperion. Some analysts view SAP's offer as very attractive, whereas some others feel the acquisition might stretch SAP, as it has little experience in absorbing acquisitions.\n\nBloomberg quoted Papassavvas, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors in Frankfurt, that SAP is overpaying and that it's the U-turn strategy. Bloomberg added that Adam Wood, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, cut his rating on SAP to ``Neutral'' from ``Outperform'' because of the ``high price'' paid for Business Objects. He also lowered his recommendation on Business Objects to ``under-perform'' from ``neutral.''\n\nBusiness Objects also announced third quarter preliminary results on Sunday. The company said it expects U.S. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter in a range of $0.04-$0.06, while non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $0.36 and $0.39. On average, twenty-three analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expect the company to earn $0.46 per share for the quarter. The company anticipates revenue in a range of $366-$370 million. Analysts expect the company to report revenues of $385.16 million for the quarter.\n\nTextron To Buy United Industrial For About $1.1 Bln\n\nMonday morning, Textron Inc. (TXT), a technology solutions provider to the defense and aerospace communities, said it agreed to purchase United Industrial Corp. (UIC) for $81 per share or a total value of $1.1 billion in cash. The per share offer marks 7.1% premium to United Industrial's closing price on October 5. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\n\nTextron stock dropped $1.37 or 2.1% at $64.01 at the close of the regular trade on New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 37% this year. United Industrial shares surged $4.77 or 6.3% at $80.39. The stock has so far gained 58% this year.\n\nAs per the agreement, Textron will make a cash tender offer for all outstanding United Industrial shares at $81 per share. This will be followed by a second-step merger where any untendered United Industrial shares will be converted into the right to receive the same price per share as shareholders who tendered in the cash tender offer.\n\nUnited Industrial makes aerospace and defense systems, including unmanned aircraft, ground control stations and counter-sniper devices. Textron Systems manufacturers precision weapons, surveillance systems, complex intelligence and communications systems, aircraft control systems, specialty marine craft and armored vehicles for the defense, homeland security and aerospace markets.\n\nThe acquisition will benefit Textron in expanding its unmanned-aircraft products to secure more military contracts. According to Robert Stallard, a New York-based analyst with Bank of America, as quoted by Bloomberg, who has a ``Buy'' rating for Textron, the deal would add to Bell's nascent unmanned capabilities. Tyler Hojo, an analyst with Sidoti & Co. who rates United Industrial a ``Buy'' said UIC brings to the table exposure to unmanned aerial vehicles. He views it as a growing piece of projected budgets.\n\nVodafone to acquire Tele2 Italia SpA, Tele2 Telecommunication Services\n\nBritish mobile phone giant Vodafone Group plc (VOD, VOD.L, VODPF.PK) agreed to acquire Tele2 Italia SpA and Tele2 Telecommunication Services SLU from Tele2 AB for a cash consideration of 775 million euros or GBP 537 million, on a debt free basis, it was revealed on Monday. The deal is expected to close by the end of the calendar year.\n\nVodafone said the deal is expected to be broadly neutral to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year, which excludes the impact of acquired intangible asset amortization. Including this impact, the deal is expected to be about 1.5% dilutive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after purchase.\n\nThe combination will help Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone operator by revenue, benefit from the attractive, high growth broadband markets in Spain and Italy. The deal will also immediately deliver the infrastructure and broadband expertise necessary for a competitive broadband offering in these key European markets. At present, Vodafone does not have a broadband network in Spain or Italy.\n\nSweden's Tele2 offers fixed-line and Internet services to over 2.6 million clients in Italy, whereas in Spain, it provides broadband and fixed-line telephone services. Over the past year, the company has shifted its focus to selling mobile phone services. In order to achieve this, it has been divesting parts of its European fixed-line business.\n\nNewmont Mining to acquire Miramar Mining for C$1.5 bln\n\nNewmont Mining Corp. (NEM) on Tuesday said it agreed to buy all the outstanding common shares of Canadian gold company Miramar Mining Corp. (MNG, MAE.TO) for C$6.25 per share, which amounts to about C$1.5 billion. The offer price marks a 20% premium to Miramar's stock price as of October 8.\n\nMiramar stock soared C$1.09 or over 20% to C$6.28 in the midday trading at Toronto Stock Exchange. MNG closed Tuesday's regular trading session at $6.38, up from Monday's close of $5.15, on 326,000 shares. Newmont stock that began trading at $44.80, closed higher at $46.02, compared to the previous close of $44.83, on 5.50 million shares.\n\nThe acquisition is aimed at strengthening reserves and increasing production as gold prices have hit the highest since 1981. With global output dropping and investors more often going for gold against the declining dollar, bullion has gained for the past 6 straight years now.\n\nThrough the deal, Newmont will gain control over Miramar's 10.7 million-ounce Hope Bay gold resource in Canada's Nunavut region. Miramar had planned to start construction this year and have annual output of about 600,000 ounces of gold by 2012.\n\nBloomberg quoted Joe Foster, a fund manager at New York-based Van Eck Associates Corp., as stating that the deal is a great one for Newmont. Mark Smith, an analyst at Dundee Securities, reportedly said the offer price was just below his own price target for Miramar.\n\nNBC Universal To Buy Oxygen Media For $925 Mln\n\nNBC Universal, the media arm of diversified industrial corporation General Electric Co. (GE), on Tuesday agreed to purchase women-oriented cable television network Oxygen Media for $925 million.\n\nThe company's stock closed Tuesday's regular trade at $42.02, up $0.49 or 1.18%, on 19.55 million shares. In the extended trade, the stock added 8 cents and was at $42.10.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in November and is estimated to be earnings accretive after the first full year and create savings of about $35 million in the following year.\n\nThe acquisition will help NBC Universal in positioning itself better in the young, upscale, female demographic, a sought after segment by advertisers.\n\nAT&T to buy spectrum licenses from Aloha Partners\n\nTelecommunication services provider AT&T Inc. (T) said on Tuesday that it agreed to buy spectrum licenses, for delivering television to mobile phones, from Aloha Partners, L.P. for about $2.5 billion in cash. The company expects to complete the transaction within six to nine months.\n\nT, which opened the regular trade on Tuesday at $41.82, moved between $41.70 and $42.16, before closing at $41.98 on 14.30 million shares.\n\nAloha Partners LP holds licenses for UHF channels 54 and 59 covering 196 million people in 281 markets, which includes 72 of the top 100 U.S. markets in the 700-megahertz frequency band. The move will give the largest phone company in the U.S. 12 megahertz of spectrum in the 700 MHz range.\n\nAT&T can use the new licenses to expand wireless phone and data services or to add video content for mobile phones. Many of the new licenses are intended for third-generation network services.\n\nPatrick Comack, a Zachary Research Investment analyst, told the Associated Press that AT&T might buy as much of the spectrum as it can at good prices. Terming the deal with Aloha as \"a steal,\" he said it is an incredible purchase.\n\nAccording to Soleil Securities analyst Gregory Lundberg, reported The Wall Street Journal, AT&T acquired the Aloha spectrum to make one of the first moves on the spectrum chess board and to ensure acquisition at a price it viewed as attractive.\n\nSABMiller, Molson Coors To Merge U.S. Operations\n\nU.K.-based brewer SABMiller plc (SAB.L, SBMRY.PK) and Canada-based Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP) on Tuesday revealed that they agreed to combine the U.S. and Puerto Rico operations of their respective subsidiaries, Miller and Coors, in a joint venture. Structured as a merger of equals, the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2007.\n\nShares of Molson Coors went up 9% in morning trading at $55.62, while SABMiller rose 2.6% in midday London trading. TAP moved further ahead to close at $56.15, up from Monday's close of $50.83, on 6.71 million shares. SAB.L finished up Tuesday's regular session at 1,487 pence, up from Monday's close of 1,466 pence on 19.58 million shares.\n\nWhile SABMiller will hold 58% economic interest in the new MillerCoors company, Molson Coors will have 42%. The joint venture is expected to have annual revenues of about $6.6 billion. The companies expect to achieve synergies of $50 million in the first year, $350 million in the second year and another $100 million in the third year. Also, the teaming up will help both companies take on rival Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. (BUD), the biggest brewer.\n\nJPMorgan Chase-led group to buy Southern Water\n\nBeating off competition from rival bidders including one led by Goldman Sachs, a group of infrastructure funds led by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) called Greensands on Tuesday said it agreed to buy UK water company Southern Water from Royal Bank of Scotland for about $2.7 billion. Additionally, about $5.7 billion will be assumed in debt.\n\nJPM closed Tuesday's regular trade at $47.57, up from the previous close of $47.44, on 12.97 million shares. The stock, which opened at $47.59, moved between $46.99 and $47.70 during the course of trading.\n\nSouthern Water provides water to more than 2 million people in southern England. It is the seventh largest water and sewage company in England and Wales. After the deal, JPMorgan takes a 32% stake, while Sydney-based Challenger Infrastructure Fund will hold 27%. UBS AG will hold 18%, Hermes 4%, Paceweald Ltd. 1% and Australian funds 18%.\n\nAccording to Geraint Anderson, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said a report, the price marked a 30% premium to Southern's regulatory asset value. Anderson also believes that the deal might re-ignite bid speculation around Southern's competitors.\n\nSeveral analysts are of the opinion that the deal is a sign of the growing interest in utility companies, especially from pension funds and private equity firms, due to their steady cash flow. Southern becomes particularly coveted as it is expected to increase its regulated assets at an annual 13% in real terms by 2010, compared to a 5.5% sector average.\n\nMcAfee to buy SafeBoot for $350 mln\n\nMcAfee, Inc. (MFE) on Tuesday said it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately owned SafeBoot B.V. for $350 million in cash to become a key player in an under-penetrated multi-billion data protection market. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007.\n\nMFE added $0.43 to close at $39.62 at the close of regular trade on Tuesday. The stock has increased 40% this year.\n\nMcAfee expects the transaction to be dilutive to its earnings per share on a GAAP basis in 2008. However, it will be neutral to earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nMcAfee is the second-largest maker of security programs and SafeBoot has the third-highest share in the full-disk encryption market. SafeBoot protects corporate data as well as private information in cell phones. Its software prevents information from getting downloaded, printed or e-mailed. Through the acquisition, McAfee will gain 4,200 large corporate customers.\n\nOn Tuesday, analysts at Credit Suisse said they maintain their \"Outperform\" rating on MFE, while raising the target price to $45 from $41. The brokerage said in a research note that after the SafeBoot acquisition and the expected purchase of DLP technology, McAfee would be well positioned to gain market share from single-product vendors.\n\nKohlberg Kravis Roberts to buy U.N. Ro-Ro Isletmeleri\n\nIn the biggest private-equity acquisition of a Turkish company, New York-based buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. on Tuesday agreed to buy shipping company U.N. Ro-Ro Isletmeleri AS, the owner of nine ro- ro ships, for EUR 910 million or $1.3 billion.\n\nIn its first purchase in Turkey, KKR bought 97.6% of U.N. Ro-Ro, which transports over a third of the truck traffic from Turkey to Europe. Turkey has become an attractive destination for investors. The country's economy grew at an average of 7% in the last five and a half years. Also the government has created a situation conducive for investment by reducing the bureaucratic red tape and introducing huge corporate tax cuts.\n\nSteven Brooker, an analyst at Enskilda Securities in Copenhagen, said, reported Bloomberg, shipping companies are providing good opportunity for investors as traffic jams on land are prompting companies to move more goods by sea.\n\nElectronic Arts inks pact with Elevation Partners to buy two studios\n\nThe world's No.1 video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) on Thursday said it signed an agreement with private equity firm Elevation Partners to acquire two studios - BioWare Corp. and Pandemic Studio - for up to $825 million in cash and stock. The deal is expected to close in January.\n\nERTS closed Thursday's regular trade at $58.69, down $1.22 or 2.04% from the previous close, on 2.41 million shares. However, the shares added $0.81 in extended trading and were at $59.50.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Electronic Arts will pay up to $620 million in cash to the shareholders of VG Holding. The company will also issue about $155 million in equity to some of the employees of VG Holding on a time/performance-based vesting criterion. Additionally, the company will assume about $50 million in outstanding VG Holding options. It has also agreed to lend VG Holding up to $35 million until the acquisition is completed.\n\nThe studios, units of VG Holding Corp. that is owned by Elevation, are reputed for their action, adventure and role-playing games, areas where Electronic Arts often had only less than 10% share. The acquisition will strengthen Electronic Arts' position in these key fields. The two studios have 10 games under development and together employ 800 people.\n\nElectronic Arts expects the deal to reduce its earnings per share in 2008 by 30-40 cents per share on a GAAP basis. Excluding charges, the purchase will reduce the company's earnings by about 5 cents per share in the fourth quarter. The acquisition will reportedly break even in fiscal 2009 and add to earnings after that.\n\nAccording to Mike Hickey, an analyst with Janco Partners in Greenwood Village, Colorado, as reported by Bloomberg, the deal continues the company's strategy of growth through acquisitions. ``They're looking for growth and have a lot of cash and decided basically to acquire that growth,'' said Hickey.\n\nIndependent Bank to buy Slade's Ferry for about $105 mln\n\nIndependent Bank Corp. (INDB), parent of Rockland Trust Co., and Slade's Ferry Bancorp. (SFBC), parent of Slades Bank, on Thursday said they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Independent Bank to acquire Slade's Ferry in a deal worth about $105 million.\n\nINDB closed Thursday's regular trading session at $30.25, down 92 cents or 2.95%, on the Nasdaq. In after-hours trading, the stock rose 48 cents or 1.60% to $30.73. SFBC closed at $15.30, up 30 cents or 2%, also on the Nasdaq.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Independent Bank will buy 25% of Slade's outstanding shares for $25.50 per share. From the remaining 75%, each Slade's Ferry common share will be converted to 0.818 shares of Independent Bank.\n\nThe acquisition of Somerset-based Slade's Ferry will help Independent Bank expand wider in Massachusetts. Slade's Ferry has nine retail branches in southeast Massachusetts.\n\nIndependent Bank expects that the deal will be accretive to its earnings in 2008 before one-time acquisition transaction charges. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008.\n\nIndependent Bank also announced third quarter financial results on Thursday. The company posted marginal fall in earnings on lower interest income. Net income slipped to $8.3 million from $8.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. However, on a per share basis, earnings grew to $0.60 from $0.58 in the previous year period. Total interest income declined to $24.3 million from $25.8 million last year. Non-interest income grew 9.5% to $7.7 million from $7.0 million.\n\nOracle offers to buy BEA Systems for $6.7 bln\n\nEnterprise software company Oracle Corp. (ORCL) on Friday said it offered to acquire business-management software maker BEA Systems, Inc. (BEAS) for $17 per share or about $6.7 billion in cash.\n\nFollowing the buyout proposal announcement, BEAS stock jumped 33.33% in the pre-market activity on Nasdaq. The stock closed the regular trade over 38% higher at $18.82 on 217.81 million shares. ORCL closed the day's regular trade at $22.44, down $0.02 or 0.09%, on 39.71 million shares. In the extended trade, the shares added two more cents.\n\nThe offer is 25% more than BEA Systems' closing price on Thursday. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who owns 13.2% of BEA Systems, is exerting pressure on the company to consider strategic alternatives. However, late Friday, after reviewing the offer, BEA Systems said it believed that the offer was very much under-valued.\n\nBEA Systems' software solutions are engaged in supporting business activities like billing, supply-chain management and securities trading. The deal will increase Oracle's engineering resources and help it compete better with IBM in middleware software.\n\nAnalysts believe that the offer by Oracle could attract companies such as Business Machines Corp. (IBM) or SAP AG (SAP) into offering counter proposals, triggering a bidding war.\n\nRay Wang, a Forrester Research Inc. analyst in Foster City, California, said this is too much of a crown jewel to let go without a fight, reported Bloomberg. The analyst felt there are many more vendors that need BEA Systems more than Oracle does.\n\nBloomberg also said, quoting Chris Hickey, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London, that the offer from Oracle is surprisingly high. It shows they want to get this deal done and want to force BEA's hands, he said.\n\nAlso, it is perceived that if Oracle and BEA Systems combine, some customers of BEA Systems may shift to the new combination from Oracle's rival SAP. Foreseeing this, SAP might make a rival bid, feels Richard Williams at Summit Analytic Partners LLC, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nOn Tuesday, Oracle, the third-largest software company, said it entered into an agreement to purchase LogicalApps for undisclosed terms. LogicalApps provides automated Governance, Risk and Compliance & controls management solutions. The deal is expected to be finalized by November 2007.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com"
