        "text": "Oracle functional consultants need a strong set of technical skills. Gap analysis, ERP, and business process knowledge are crucial. They also need to be proficient in specific Oracle tools like Oracle EBS, Oracle ERP, and Oracle Cloud. Additionally, skills in creating custom reports, handling financial modules, and managing cash and payroll are vital.\n\nOn the soft skills front, Oracle functional consultants need to be effective communicators. They must be able to guide business users and stakeholders, and proactively resolve issues through cross-functional interactions. They also need to be able to manage multiple phases of testing, ensuring test plans and test cases are completed and business requirements are met.\n\nGap analysis is the process of identifying the difference between the current state of a business process or system and its desired future state. Oracle functional consultants use gap analysis to identify the gaps between a client's functional and technical requirements and standard Oracle functionality. They gather and document requirements, define and document setup and configuration, develop functional specifications, and facilitate fit/gap analysis. They also conduct sessions with key users to analyze business requirements and map user requirements.\n\nBusiness process is the series of actions that a company takes to achieve a specific goal. Oracle functional consultants use business process to understand how a company operates, translate requirements into designs, and configure modules to meet user needs. They also analyze and recommend improvements to these processes, which helps them centralize billing solutions and create business process maps.\n\nGeneral Ledger (GL) is a system that keeps track of a company's financial transactions. Oracle functional consultants use GL to manage these transactions. They prepare consolidation data in GL, design interfaces between payroll and GL, and create custom reports based on client requirements. They also configure security rules, perform month-end period close activities, and develop code for conversions to extract legacy journals and load them into GL Interface tables.\n\nSolution design is the process of defining and detailing the architecture for a system or product. Oracle functional consultants use solution design to meet client requirements. They develop and implement strategies, create custom solutions, and integrate them into existing business models. They also coordinate activities like requirements gathering, testing, and documentation. In addition, they participate in solution design sessions with module leads and IS teams, and provide inputs to the technical team for solution design.\n\nSLA, or Service Level Agreement, is a set of rules that defines the quality of a service. Oracle Functional Consultants use SLA in various ways. They set up SLA for specific accounting deviations, manage accounting across sub-ledger transactions, and ensure that production problems are resolved within the defined SLA. They also configure SLA modules, develop custom programs for SLA entries, and execute configurations to set up SLA modules.\n\nOracle EBS (Enterprise Business Suite) is a comprehensive set of business applications that automate operational processes. Oracle functional consultants use Oracle EBS in various ways, including implementing regulatory requirements, developing custom applications, and configuring the application for cloud service readiness. They also use it for data mapping, testing, and automating configurations. For example, they might implement Oracle EBS to achieve 100% compliance with regulatory requirements, or integrate third-party APIs into the system.\n\nOracle ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a suite of applications that automates business processes. Oracle Functional Consultants use Oracle ERP to adapt business processes to a dynamic environment, implement data fixes and setups, and migrate codes across different environments. They also use it to implement new systems, replace legacy systems, and even convert systems from one platform to another."
