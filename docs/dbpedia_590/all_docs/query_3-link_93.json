        "text": "Ethnic Cleansing in the Balkans\n\nThis book looks at the phenomenon of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans over the last two hundred years. It argues that the events of the last two centuries can be demystified, that the South East of Europe was not destined to become violent and that construction of the Balkans as endemically violent misses an important political point and historical point. Ethnic Cleansing in the Balkans argues that ethnic cleansing is a problem that is linked to nationalism rather than being a Balkan phenomenon per se. As nationalism spread from Central Europe to the Ottoman regions of Europe, national ideologies replaced the older religious and political affiliations. Muslims came to be regarded as potentially disloyal minorities in Bosnia and elsewhere. In addition, national divisions harking back to the Middle Ages divided the other ethnic groups, who became increasingly mutually antagonistic, eventually leading to minorities being persecuted and driven out, with many victims mistreated and murdered in a demonstrably cruel fashion. Although the acts were often carried out in ‘traditional’ ways (and have sometimes been described as archaic and primitive), the force behind these acts was a very modern one. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there are very few multiethnic regions left in South Eastern Europe and large diaspora communities of ethnically cleansed peoples. Carmichael provides an account of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans as a single historical phenomenon and brings together a vast array of primary and secondary sources to produce a concise and accessible argument. This book will be of interest to students and researchers of European studies, history and comparative politics. Cathie Carmichael teaches at the University of East Anglia, where she is Lecturer of European History. She studied International History at the London School of Economics, Ethnology at the University of Ljubljana and European Studies at the University of Bradford. For the spring semester of 2002, she was Mildred Miller Fort Visiting Scholar in European Studies at Columbus State University, Georgia. She has written a number of articles on popular culture in South Eastern Europe and is co-author of Slovenia and the Slovenes and co-editor of Language and Nationalism in Europe.\n\nRoutledge Advances in European Politics\n\n1.

I would also like to acknowledge the support of my colleagues in the School of Humanities and Cultural Studies for giving me research leave to write it. The administrative team at Middlesex has been consistently marvellous and helped the last two academic years go by a little more smoothly. I am grateful to all offered suggestions and/or encouragement along the way.

I exchanged ideas and books with my neighbour Mark Thompson. Without his help it would have been a lot harder to write this book. Florian Bieber read the text, offered incisive comments and allowed me to use some of his personal photographs of Bosnia, for which I am grateful. Boøidar Jezernik, Bojan Baskar, Rajko Muråiæ, Jonathan Schwartz, Marko Øivkoviæ, Dejan Djokić, Glenda Sluga, John Allcock and Mehmet Ali Dikerdem all read parts of the book and offered useful suggestions. Djordje Stefanović read much of the penultimate version of the text and offered poignant comments, for which I extend thanks. I would also like to thank the Csontvary Museum, Pecs, Hungary for permission to reproduce ‘View of Mostar’ and ‘Bridge at Mostar over the Neretva’ both by Csontvary Kosztka Tivadar. My biggest debt of gratitude is – as always – to my family, particularly David, Win and Christina. Una and John have given me every imaginable kind of support: educational, moral and domestic.

It soon entered the standard vocabulary of the English and other languages, but its usage often appears to be both euphemistic and imprecise. This book is an attempt to define what this term might actually mean and to place the events surrounding the practice of ethnic cleansing in a wider geographical and historical context. In attempting to define ethnic cleansing what is presented here is a study of the impact of nationalism,1 the formation of new states and the destruction of existing cultures and communities in the region of Europe2 often referred to as the Balkans.3 If we accept this term ‘Balkans’4 as being ‘tantamount to the Ottoman legacy’5 in Europe then this geographical term would cover the regions of contemporary Albania, Macedonia, Greece, the Krajina region of Croatia,6 Serbia, Bulgaria, European Turkey, Montenegro, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Kosovo (and some elements in the historical legacies of Austria, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia). Here we explore some of the reasons why these regions experienced such violent and destructive fratricidal struggles over the last two hundred years and question as to why people deemed to be alien within the new states have been murdered or expelled from the regions they have inhabited for centuries. Throughout the text, the Balkans has been defined as a single historical region and instances of ethnic cleansing as a series of related historical events. This is largely because I have interpreted the origins of the practice of ethnic cleansing as almost entirely ideological. It is not my intention to detract from studies that have focused on single regions or instances of ethnic cleansing or even theses that present these as unrelated phenomena. This study can only be a contribution to an important scholarly and ethical debate that may never be resolved with a single answer, because ultimately what we are dealing with here is the lives of many millions of people, whose own responses to circumstances may be qualitatively different. What the historian can legitimately try to do, however, is to discern if patterns of behaviour have developed over time, while still recognizing the role of the individual. Every\n\n2\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\ncase of ethnically inspired murder is unlike any other in important ways, but what interests me here primarily is how and why these events might be deemed to constitute a single phenomenon. During the last few hundred years, many parts of Europe (and indeed, regions of the globe other colonized by Europeans) have experienced ethnically inspired violence in the wake of state formation which has destroyed, unsettled or damaged older cultures. As a phenomenon it is certainly not restricted to the South East of Europe, nor indeed, as argued in the following chapters, did the ideas that triggered outbreaks of violence even originate there. The extermination of over 90 per cent of Poland’s Jews in the early 1940s; the Highland clearances in Scotland in the eighteenth century; the expulsion of ethnic Germans from postwar Czechoslovakia; the transportation of the Crimean Tartars in 1941; the slaughter of Izmir’s Greeks and Armenians in the early 1920s; and the exodus of Muslims from the Balkans after the mid-nineteenth century are only a few of the numerous instances of this kind of violence. Ethnic cleansing has become a broad term,7 which covers all forms of ethnically inspired violence from murder, rape and torture to forceful removal of populations. In 1993, a United Nations Commission of experts reported to the Security Council that ethnic cleansing involved ‘the planned deliberate removal from a specific territory, persons of a particular ethnic group, by force or intimidation, in order to render that area ethnically homogeneous’.8 As Norman Naimark has stated ‘ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide’, suggesting a continuum between the phenomena, and at the present time ethnic cleansing is taking on ‘a juridical meaning through the war crimes courts in the Hague, just as genocide was defined by Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of December 9, 1948’.9 As Ahmed Akbar has remarked, it has become a ‘metaphor for our time’10 and ‘ethnic cleansing’ or similar constructions such as the ‘cleansing of terrain’ was certainly used in the former Yugoslavia in the 1980s and 1990s, drawing on older similar terms by nationalist writers and ideologues. At the Hague Tribunal, Paul Garde described ethnic cleansing as a practice which means you act in such a way that, in a given territory, the members of a given ethnic group are eliminated, with the aim that the territory be ‘ethnically pure’, in other words that it would contain only members of the ethnic group that took the initiative of cleansing the territory.11 The perpetrators of such violence are usually clear about their objectives, characteristically constructing the nation in unambiguous terms and anxious to exclude ‘non-nationals’ and potentially disloyal ‘minorities’. The removal of existing populations has clear material benefits for some of those who carry it out: supporters of the regime in postwar Yugoslavia moved into comfortable Slavonian and Istrian homes of the Germans and Italians that they had driven out, creating a ‘web of complicity’12 between themselves and the Communists. This process of appropriation of property occurs continually throughout the period under consideration. Sometimes exchanges have been carried out with a kind of dreadful ‘symmetry’: in\n\nThe destruction of tradition 3 1995, displaced Croats from Banja Luka in Republika Srpska moved into newly vacated homes in Knin in Croatia previously inhabited by Serbs. Despite the material advantages to be had from seizing the property of others, the roots of the practice of ethnic cleansing, it is argued here, are more closely tied to ideology. If ethnic cleansing was primarily about greed or a kind of class hatred for those in the community that have better homes or more goods, it is unlikely that it would manifest itself as violence against an ethnic group per se. This kind of violence, directed against ethnic communities during times of crisis, has both religious and nationalist origins in European thought and political practice. Christian intolerance of other religions (and of Christians of other denominations in the world of Orthodox/Catholic schism) dates back to before the Middle Ages and was manifested in the Crusades, the persecution of Jews, of Muslims and of religious radicals and heretics, such as Cathars and Anabaptists.13 From the eighteenth century onwards, consciousness of biological ‘race’, notions of linguistic fraternity, state-orientated loyalties – the elements that combined to create the ideology generally referred to as nationalism – combined with older prejudices to create the conditions which led to an almost perpetual intolerance of cultural and ethnic diversity and polytaxis (multiple taxonomy or self-identification) in the minds of many Europeans. Ethnically inspired violence is certainly an integral element of European culture, yet at the same time Europe has also been a home to tolerant cultures, where ethnocentrism is confined to the very edges of society, even if it is not fully eliminated. The zest of ethnic mix in towns like Trieste, Vienna, London, Dublin, Salonika, Paris, Sarajevo or Amsterdam has produced great human achievements and demonstrated that diversity or polytaxis are plausible alternatives to ethnic monoliths. Roy Gutman believes that the old ‘Sarajevo with its skyline of minarets, church steeples and synagogues was a testimony to centuries of civilized multiethnic coexistence. It was a place of learning and of commerce: . . . a European jewel.’14 Although multiethnicity is frequently constructed as a source of structural weakness in the case of the Balkans, it is rarely seen as a weakness when examining contemporary Switzerland or Great Britain.\n\nThe interpretation of texts This book has been written as a form of histoire-problème, in the sense that the term was used by the French Annales school of historians.15 In effect, adopting this approach has meant examining ethnic cleansing in the Balkans as a single historical phenomenon or series of phenomena related first and foremost to the spread of nationalist ideas and the collapse of the hegemony of the Ottomans and then subsequently the Habsburgs in this region and the competitions of various state projects that competed to replace this hegemony in the region. As Lucien Febvre once said ‘to pose a problem is precisely the beginning and the end of all history. No problems, no history.’16 The ‘problem’ that we encounter here is that nationalism as an ideology effectively destroyed alternatives. In the following chapters, I explore some of the reasons why the adherence to the idea of the single nation as\n\n4\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nopposed to other forms of collectivity was so powerful and in intellectual terms so paradigmatic from the end of the eighteenth century. Its advocates eventually destroyed all the alternatives to nation states: the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy, Royalist Yugoslavia17 and then in the 1990s the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. While some of the contemporary Balkan states claim to be EthnoFederations, at the beginning of the twenty-first century they are certainly far less ethnically mixed than they would have been had population movement and ethnic cleansing not taken place. Initially, I assumed that the actions of individuals during times of war and ethnic cleansing could be interpreted hermeneutically and that by studying first hand accounts of ethnic cleansing and the atrocities that went with them a great deal about the phenomenon itself would be revealed. Thus, the closer18 that one could get to the original event, the nearer one would be to understanding what actually took place and why. This approach reveals not only the influence of the French historical school, but of the cultural anthropology of Clifford Geertz, which has proved very influential among historians attempting to decode and interpret past events. Geertz examined single ‘events’ or ‘texts’ (most famously cock fighting in Bali) in order to try and discover how certain actions, symbols and signs might convey meaning about the culture that he was describing.19 The approach of Geertz has been highly influential among historians of popular culture in Europe, including Robert Darnton and Natalie Zemon Davis particularly when examining and decoding pre-modern cultures. The historical sources pertaining to ethnic cleansing do present us with numerous events (often distressing and horrific) that might require ‘decoding’ in order to understand the process better. At a military court in Niå in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in November 2000, Nebojåa Dimitrijević a reservist in the Yugoslavian Army was asked why he had written in his diary entry in late March 1999: ‘two persons cleaned up’. What had happened is that two elderly and infirm Albanians, Rukije and Ferez Krasniqi, had refused to leave their homes in the village of Gornja Susica in Kosovo in 1999 and had been shot. The ‘cleaning up’ referred to the fact that the reservists had then burnt the bodies.20 In this case, it is almost as if those that have been constructed as disloyal to the Yugoslavian state, in this case the Albanians, were removed in a way that suggests a strong ritualistic element. Given that the Krasniqi were probably Albanianized Serbs (the original surname was probably Krasnić), their ‘betrayal’ is all the more poignant. Other events concerning the killing of individuals who have come to represent minorities have a strong symbolic content.21 A British cleric, Robert Walsh, witnessed attacks against Greeks in Istanbul in the 1820s: a young man was forced to his knees by two Turks pressing on his shoulders, and in that position a third came behind him with his kinshal . . . With a single horizontal stroke he severed his head from his neck; his body was thrown into a puddle in the middle of the street for passengers to trample on and his head was laid contemptuously between his thighs.22\n\nThe destruction of tradition 5 In this account it appears that the death of the victim (in this case a Greek in Istanbul, who had been identified and equated with the rebel Greeks in the Ottoman Empire) is not the sole point. The act of execution is also highly symbolic with the additional intention of humiliating the essence of the man even after death has actually occurred, on the grounds of his alterity. Decapitation is perhaps one of the most vivid and extreme forms of murder. The Croatian fascist Ustaåa persecuted Orthodox priests during the Second World War, especially in the Krajina region, sometimes decapitating their victims.23 More recently, in 1993 Serb soldiers in Bosnia found the heads of their comrades who had been decapitated by Muslim extremists.24 When these photographs were published in the Belgrade journal Vreme, this must have reminded the readers of the tower of skulls (Čele-kula) that was erected in Niå by the Turks to punish the rebel Serbs in 1809 and tapped into their conscious or unconscious fears of Islamic extremism in whatever form. Symbolic elements within traditional cultures may be stronger and more ‘consistent’ as Mary Douglas argued than the ‘fragmented’ symbolism of more modern societies.25 Certainly many of the events that are examined in the following pages show evidence of the profound importance of a unitary and consistent symbolism. Even events, which seem to transcend interpretation, such as the horrific torture and murder of the Croat Slavko Ećimović in Prijedor in Bosnia in June 1992, may possibly be examined as part of an analysis of what actually happened, although it would be hard to adequately describe the final moments of a man who must have suffered a great deal before he eventually died. Before he ‘disappeared’, Slavko’s mutilated face in which the eyes had been ripped from the sockets was displayed to the other prisoners. He had also been badly beaten. The sadism of the act was not completely ‘random’ as he had been an outspoken critic of the local Serb nationalists before his death.26 His punishment was a very individual and specific one somewhat similar to the treatment of traitors elsewhere.27 According to Vladimir Dedijer, writing in the Communist newspaper Borba in 1941, partisans selected for death by the Četnik Filip Ajdačić were killed in an almost identical fashion.28 In both cases, this appears to have been a punishment for ‘political crimes’ and was as brutal as could be imagined. Since Dedijer’s diaries were published in the early 1950s and widely available in the former Yugoslavia29 and other similar material was used by the Communist regime to discredit their former political opponents during the Second World War, it may even be the case that recitations of the events of the 1940s provided a grisly Urtext for the 1990s and Ajdačić a model for future ‘Četnik’ behaviour.30 When Croatian policemen were murdered in Borovo Selo in May 1991, their bodies were mutilated in the same way as Slavko Ećimović and the victims of Filip Ajdačić. The Croatian public were relayed the information graphically in the newspapers and the ‘Serb “enemy within” was now demonized beyond all reason’ and referred to openly as ‘Chetniks’.31 In Belgrade, the man who clearly wanted to be seen as the heir to the Četnici, Vojislav Åeåelj, boasted that it was his men who had carried out the killings.32 Later when he was interviewed on Serbian television, Åeåelj said that they would use ‘rusty shoehorns’ to remove the eyeballs of Croats, although he later admitted that this was ‘black humour’.33 But\n\n6\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nby this time the Croatian public were terrified and begun to pour into Zagreb from the rural regions. Dedijer and the other writers described the actions of their enemies during the war in the hope that these events would not be repeated and not to create a prototype for acts that would lead to the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, texts are powerful things and the circulation of rumours about atrocities served a clear purpose for both sides in the Serb-Croat war of 1991. An actress from Zagreb who performed on the stage in Belgrade was driven out of Croatia by the end of 1991 after receiving threats. ‘The people who called her on the phone did not “merely” threaten: they called her a “Chetnik whore”, they graphically described in detail how they would torture her to death, which parts of the body they would cut off.’34 Symbolic acts of cruelty seem to be a recurrent theme in the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans. In a sense, atrocities might be seen as a general human response to crisis and similar acts of mutilation occurred elsewhere in the last century.35 But the nature of the atrocity itself may be more culturally specific or at least mean something to the people it is intended to terrify. John Allcock recalled an interview with a Croatian politician who wanted to travel to Borovo Selo in 1991 ‘in order to acquaint himself directly with the nature of the mutilations alleged to have been inflicted on the Croat victims of the ambush there’,36 suggesting that what had occurred could be interpreted in some way by a non-participant in the event. Christian Giordano has juxtaposed the concepts of ‘honour’ and ‘dignity’ and sees these concepts as historically grounded, writing that ‘in these (Balkan) societies honour has slowly become less and less important so that it has become an “archaic moment” i.e. an island of tradition, albeit great and important, in a sea of modernity’.37 One of the primary reasons why these atrocities have been committed in particular ways is that these ‘islands of tradition’ are still relatively strong in the Balkan context, whereas in more Europeanized societies, they are more fragmented. This is not to say that the state and individuals in the latter countries have jettisoned force, violence and cruelty and banished them to the realms of the past, but it may mean that the importance of the symbolic and the preservation of honour is less and less important if we historicize this problem. In addition to a hermeneutic interpretation, which has been influenced by the anthropology of Clifford Geertz, the Marxist idea of the ‘truth’ of the revolutionary crisis, famously used by Leon Trotsky when describing the events of 1905 in the Russian Empire might also have some explanatory value in interpreting the occurrences in question here. Trotsky, an eyewitness, participant and later chronicler of the events surrounding the formation of the first soviets (as well as one of the most important sources on the Balkan Wars in his role as war correspondent), found that the chaos of the revolutionary situation revealed a great deal about the tensions of life before: (r)evolution raises the ‘normal’ insanity of social contradictions to the highest possible tension . . . And yet the entire modern development condenses, strains and accentuates the contradictions and makes them unbearable, consequently preparing the state of mind when the great majority ‘goes mad’.38\n\nThe destruction of tradition 7 Like revolution, war and crisis also appear to raise ‘the normal insanity of social contradictions’ and sometimes lead to almost Bakhtinian carnivalesque rites,39 which either parody the structures and routines of everyday life or are integrated into social events.40 Sometimes individuals have been killed or violated in an almost ‘festive’ manner by the perpetrators, who have mocked them and their suffering. A young woman from Liplje in Bosnia reported that she was raped in front of her father by Četnici, one of them shouted to him that he was going to marry her.41 In such cases, there must surely be some link between incidents of rape and notions of patrimony. In the inverted and terrible world of war and crisis, the father is mocked as his daughter is taken from him by force, but his importance and his presence in the ‘transaction’ are still acknowledged. In Bosnia in 1992 a dummy, reminiscent perhaps of a scarecrow, was set up at a checkpoint to look like a mutilated corpse.42 The message again is unambiguous, those manning the checkpoint indicating a willingness to perpetrate such mutilation and torture on the bodies of prisoners. Its display is clearly a deterrent, but is also a symbol of power and ruthlessness, and can be interpreted as an assertion of territorial control, the dummy serving as a warning to transgressors. When we examine and compare patterns of behaviour during war and crisis elsewhere, it appears that they do tell us a great deal, not only about the human psyche and popular culture, but also about tensions or antagonisms (in the Marxist sense of the word) that are suppressed during peacetime. Joanna Bourke has looked at military culture during the twentieth century in the English-speaking world. Patterns of behaviour among ordinary soldiers indicated that, during fighting, patterns of racial hatred and misogyny emerged – manifested both in their actions against their victims and their attitudes towards each other.43 These seem to follow clear and predetermined cultural patterns, which might allow us to try to construct a ‘method in madness’.44 In more modernized or Europeanized societies these cultures may be more marginal and fragmented, but nevertheless survive in some manner. Throughout the initial stages of writing the book, my point of departure was that if patterns of behaviour during the crises of war and ethnic cleansing were examined, they would reveal some ‘truths’ about societies and cultures in which they occurred. According to this methodological approach, every instance where a Muslim crucified a Christian or vice versa would thus reveal depths of loathing that had been suppressed during peacetime. Every example of theft of property would thus represent long-standing covetousness and every hate text would crystallize rather than simply codify established beliefs and every rape of one neighbour by another would represent unfulfilled fantasies of power over the other that had been sublimated. Such a view is supported by analysis of the pronouncements of those who foment and organize genocide and ethnic cleansing, even if it is not made explicit by its perpetrators. Philip Gourevitch describes how, in the midst of genocide in Rwanda, announcers on Radio Télévision de Mille Collines reminded genocidaires what awaited them in each Tutsi household they attacked: ‘. . . the radio, the couch, the goat, the opportunity to rape a young girl’.45 At the same time, the perpetrators, even after the event, often justified their actions in terms of ‘defending\n\n8\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nthe . . . [Hutu] tribe against the Tutsi’.46 Dubravka Ugreåić projects a similar picture of war in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s being promoted – in the short term at least – as ‘an attractive male adventure’ comprising ‘shooting and shagging, screwing and killing’.47 From reading many first-hand accounts of ethnic cleansing, a rather different perspective has emerged that has led me to question some earlier assumptions. If I began with an indexical or diagnostic approach where details spoke to an entire story, then later I found another set of stories that began to change this process of interpretation. Rather than revealing a society or more accurately a number of cultures and societies at their worst, many of these materials seem to indicate that war is experienced as unnatural by the perpetrators of violence as well as the victims. War has destroyed very complex cultures, replacing them with empty social shells. Attempting to inject symbolic value into their actions often reveals, not depths of hatred, but the very shallowness of that emotion. Artificial constructions of hate and alterity need to be continually repeated. If they are not, people will soon return to their old patterns of behaviour. It is often stated that many of the perpetrators of ethnic crimes in the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia were very ordinary people: it was the crisis that made them into murderers. Sakib Ahmić, a Muslim villager (from Bosnia) ‘testified that he had watched the Croat Kupreskić brothers “grow up into decent people” until the fighting began in their village. They broke into his home and murdered his son Naser and daughter-in-law Zehrudina, as well as their children . . .’.48 Little in their behaviour before the war had indicated that they had even as much as hated their Muslim neighbours, let alone feel so strongly about them that they would murder them. Duåko Tadić, a Bosnian Serb who was found guilty of killing his Muslim neighbours, including his former best friend, at the Hague Tribunal clearly had a nationalist worldview before the war started,49 but his sadism may only have been ignited by propaganda in the preceding months and years and the actions of very few individuals show prejudices before the crisis erupted. The Tribunal recorded the ‘violent and cruel way’ the murders had been committed and one of the judges remarked: ‘You committed these crimes with intention and sadistic brutality.’50 He was the first person to be convicted of war crimes in Europe since the Second World War, but prior to the Bosnian war, Tadić had been a very ordinary person who owned a bar and was noted for his enthusiasm for sport. The people he killed had frequently drunk in his bar and almost all considered themselves his friends. This crime was a series of murders that would not have happened without the manipulation of anti-Islamic feelings and the moment of crisis in 1992. Many others had not been prepared in any meaningful sense for their role in ethnic cleansing. A Croat from Kostajnica told the writer Slavenka Drakulić ‘the war made a murderer out of me, because there was nothing else to do but to fight back’. Drakulić added, ‘the last part of the sentence he (said) so softly I (could) hardly hear him’.51 One JNA soldier from Belgrade told a journalist in 1992 ‘Vukovar was more of a slaughter than a battle. Many women and children were killed . . . I deserted after that. (It) continues to haunt me. Every night I imagine that the war has reached my home and that my own children are being butchered.’52\n\nThe destruction of tradition 9 These differing interpretations of the available texts have not been fully reconciled in the book and could probably never be, as patterns of behaviour certainly vary enormously between individuals. It would be perilous to attempt to create a single grid for cultural responses to ethnic cleansing (although some clear patterns of behaviour do emerge), even though the ideological origins of crises may be very similar. By assuming a historical approach to the phenomenon of ethnic cleansing and seeing it as having a single ideological origin without actually arguing that it is a single cultural practice, I risk being accused of committing the error of relativism, of constructing an ‘artificial’53 or ‘false’54 symmetry between all national and ethnic groups. Having stated that nationalisms are similar at the level of ideology, it would be morally banal to level all the dramatis personae involved in the politics of the Balkans, as if they were all equally guilty for what has happened. In practice there is a qualitative difference between those who use violence and force and who create, manipulate and take advantage of crises as part of their political repertoire, and those who do not. And, while it is sometimes possible to ameliorate the situation of ethnic groups who are suffering from low levels of discrimination, it is not possible to ‘give people back’ their lives, to restore full health to the injured or to return complete mental health to those who have been violated. While we may argue about the various motives and methods of the organizers and perpetrators of ethnic cleansing, their victims are united in their misery and, in death, cease to enjoy whatever privileges – real or imagined – their ethnic background provided. ‘Serbs’, ‘Croats’ and ‘Muslims’ killed during the shelling of Sarajevo are all equally dead. A person may be killed on the grounds of their national identity but – despite the claims of nationalists – this ceases to have any function thereafter and their body cannot be reclaimed for the nation: it is gone forever. When presenting their cases to the outside world, many nationalists have attempted to portray their circumstances as unique. Dubravka Ugreåić was informed by her plumber Jura in Croatia in 1993: ‘We are an internationally recognised victim . . . And there is no way that any victim can ever be . . . normal.’55 In January 2001, 5 per cent of the population of Croatia demonstrated against the planned extradition of General Mirko Norac to the Hague Tribunal to face accusations for war crimes.56 After years of relentless propaganda that had presented the violent acts of Croats as patriotism and the behaviour of their Serb and Muslim neighbours as aggression, it is hardly surprising that so many ordinary citizens in Croatia see the behaviour of generals as acceptable within the rules of war. Given that convicted war criminal General Tihomir Blaskić was publicly honoured by Franjo Tudjman before he was delivered to the Hague as the HDZ’s sacrificial lamb, the nature of the Croatian response is understandable. In any crisis the balance of responsibility may rest with nationalists from one particular ethnic group – in 1991 in the Serb-dominated regions of Croatia – the impetus for the aggression clearly initially came from Serb nationalists who were encouraged by unscrupulous nationalists in Belgrade, who then utterly abandoned them to their fate in 1995. But in many senses they were provoked, not only by their own leaders, but also by a government in Croatia, which was determined to reincorporate\n\n10\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nthe fascist period of history into the mainstream of political life (for example, by renaming streets after Ustaåa ministers) and then to disingenuously deny that they were threatening Serb culture in the Krajina in any sense. Wherever the balance of responsibility does lie in any particular case in South Eastern Europe (and these should be examined individually), historically there has been no ethnic group that has been unaffected by ethnic cleansing. For the purposes of this book, the Ottoman world before 1800 and its legacy up to the present day is defined as ‘traditional’57 (although the term premodern might also be used problematically) and the rejection and destruction of that tradition as ‘nationalism’, although the two concepts are not always diametrically opposed, as a kind of ‘millet identity’ (in which religion is the primary definition of identity) and some of the collective mentalities of Balkan Muslims survived until the twentieth century and affected the way they were constructed by Christian nationalists.58 Here Maria Todorova seems to have made an extremely important point when she states: the Balkans [have become] . . . European by shedding the last residue of an imperial legacy, widely considered an anomaly at the time and by assuming and emulating the homogeneous European nation-state as the normative form of social organization. It may well be that what we are witnessing today, wrongly attributed to some Balkan essence, is the ultimate Europeanization of the Balkans.59 But we might also define the Ottoman Balkan world as ‘traditional’ because popular culture was relatively autonomous from or at least separated from literate culture and the state relatively distant from the lives of the people. In every society, as Robert Redfield noted, ‘great tradition and little tradition have long affected each other and continue to do so . . . [they are] . . . two currents of thought and action, distinguishable, yet ever flowing into and out of each other’.60 Balkan pastoralists and peasants were never ‘primitive isolates’. Even in Montenegro, an island of non-Ottoman government in the Balkans, the society was reliant on a supply of gunpowder from the outside world for its continued existence.61 Nevertheless, illiteracy rates throughout the Balkans before the twentieth century were much higher than in Western Europe, often as high as 95 per cent.62 In these circumstances, ‘little’ or popular tradition at a local level was much richer, less standardized63 and less well informed by literate or ‘great’ traditions, although it can be seen from the widespread survival of songs of the guslari or other folksingers that there was strong communication between regions. Rom orchestras, some travelling, some foreign adopted diverse styles in the performances of music for weddings and other ritual events. The arrival of Europeanized ideologies destroyed much of the tradition or changed it in some quite profound ways. In the nineteenth century, the songs of the guslari became the basis for the reconceptualization of the Kosovo story amongst Serbs.64 The deeds of ancient Greeks became the standard by which modern Greeks (and indeed other Christian peoples in the Balkans) constructed their\n\nThe destruction of tradition 11 identity as ‘civilized’ and non-Muslim, although the culture they were celebrating was pagan and putatively violent, at least if we are to judge any culture by its literary remains, such as the Odyssey.65 By the late eighteenth century, as a result of the variety of different cultures and practices, the Balkans, which had been preserved long after similar practices had died out in Western and Central Europe, became what Maria Todorova has referred to as the ‘Volksmuseum of Europe’.66 Writers from outside the region often took a great deal of vicarious interest in these societies. Part of the allure for travellers, journalists and other writers was perceived difference from their own milieus. Mary Edith Durham, an English writer and early anthropologist, spent a great deal of time recording tattoos and hairstyles of the northern Albanians.67 The French writer, Vialla de Sommières described Montenegro in almost purely Homeric terms in the early 1800s68 (although some have questioned whether he actually went there69). Frequently, Western writers became passionate advocates of one national group in the Balkans and championed its cause. George Gordon, Lord Byron died in the struggle for Greek Independence in 1824, although admittedly of illness and not in battle. Since the mental world he inhabited was populated by heroes from classical Greek mythology, it was perhaps a fitting end to an epic life. The distinguished Irish writer Joyce Cary fought in Montenegro during the Balkan wars as his own contribution to the final demise of the Ottomans.70 During the Balkan wars and the First World War, nurses and voluntary workers from across Europe came to the aid of their beleaguered neighbours in South-East Europe.71 Despite a fascination with variety and larger than life Homeric types and cultural variety, many of those who wrote about Balkans cultures had a desire to homogenize and simplify what they saw in order to ‘Europeanize’ the region. The historian Robert W. Seton-Watson described Macedonia as a problem of racial intermixture ‘defying all possible unraveling’72 as if it were wholly desirable to untie this apparent knot. Western writers wanted Balkan cultures to be codified in their own terms, so they ‘reduced’ ‘tamed’ and ‘familiarized’ these cultures for their often avid audiences creating a ‘learning of appropriation’.73 Commenting on Eastern Roumelia, Robert Hamilton Lang felt that ‘[w]ith the exception of an insignificant number of Mussulmans and Greeks, her population is Bulgarian in race, language and sympathy indeed so thoroughly Bulgarian that a stranger can scarcely perceive any difference between the two peoples’.74 Fanny Copeland, a passionate advocate of the ‘Yugoslav idea’ who was active at the Paris Peace Conference in 1918 announced that [f]rom the ordeal of war, pestilence, famine and persecution, the Yugo-Slavs [sic] have emerged again as one people, as homogenous as they were when they first descended from the Carpathians. Yugo-Slavs all, they cherish the old individual names, mementoes of past triumphs and tragedies.75 She saw these people as a single unit because it fitted with her own political taste and orientation. She and many another of a romanticist or nationalist bent then had to witness the outcome of this grand homogenizing idea. Very little of this\n\n12\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nWestern scholarship on the Balkans during the last two hundred years was genuinely ‘original’ or contributed to extending actual knowledge about the region. Leopold von Ranke’s celebrated History of Servia, was largely informed by listening to Vuk Karadøić.76 However, without doubt the actual collection of data by enthusiasts from Western Europe created an actual empirical basis for subsequent ethnology and preserved texts and recorded practices that might otherwise have been lost.\n\nEnter nationalism, exit tradition le moment est arrivé de soulever et vaincre.77\n\nNationalism and the creation of nation states was an ideological model that ran counter to complex traditions and daily realities for most Balkan peoples. Ethnic cleansing accompanied the spread of nationalism and state formation in the Balkans after the Ottoman Empire and its mentalities began to lose their grip in the eighteenth century. As Arnold Toynbee put it, ‘[t]he introduction of the Western formula (of the principle of nationalism) among these people has resulted in massacre . . . Such massacres are only the extreme form of a national struggle between mutually indispensable neighbours, instigated by this fatal Western idea.’78 If we were to compare the ethnic composition of the regions under consideration in this book in 1800 and in 2000, very great changes in population would be evident. In Greek Macedonia by 2000 the non-Greeks numbered only a few thousand. Turks, Slav Muslims, Christian Slavs and Jews once populated this region and in many places outnumbered the Greeks. In Western Anatolia, towns with majority populations of Greeks or Armenians such as Izmir had their populations driven out in 1922. The Krajina region of Croatia lost it majority Serb population in 1995, after four years of war that wiped out many Croatian villages and claimed the lives of thousands. In 1941, Krajina’s Serbs suffered at the hands of a fascist regime that killed many thousands of Serbs in this region and in Bosnia. In Vojvodina and Slavonia, Jews, Germans and more recently Croats and Serbs have been pushed out. Thousands died in Kosovo in 1944 and again in 1999 when vicious interethnic rivalry between Serbs and Albanians resulted in murder and mass exodus. In Sandøak in Serbia, in Macedonia and in Montenegro, Slav Muslims have been pressurized to assimilate or leave. Bosnia lost hundreds of thousands of its people to ethnic cleansing during the Second World War and the 1990s. These regions have not only lost ‘minorities’, they have had their overwhelming constituency changed. Although it may be somewhat problematic to equate ‘tradition’ with multiethnicity, polytaxis and diversity, there is barely a single region, which remains multiethnic in the Balkans or that has escaped the ravages of ethnic cleansing. Serbs and Hungarians still cohabit peacefully in Vojvodina. Macedonia may not become another Bosnia, but peaceful coexistence in that country looks increasingly unlikely after the interethnic fighting in 2001. The first nationalist ideas arrived in the Balkans from Western and Central Europe generally in the form of histories and ethnographies published by ‘native\n\nThe destruction of tradition 13 scholars’ of their own peoples. Herderian cultural nationalism, which emphasized the innate and by inference, political bonds between speakers of the same language was transmitted by a number of important intellectuals at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century. Through the work of the Habsburg imperial librarian Jernej Kopitar79 and the collector of folk poetry Vuk Karadøić, the reading public of Europe became familiar with epic poetry (for which there was also something of vogue). But the process of the codification of popular knowledge became intricately linked with the ‘invention’ or reforging of national identities for the people in the Balkans. Amongst Serbs, recognizably modern national ideas were produced in Novi Sad by intellectuals who created an entrepôt of central European-orientated culture, where histories and studies of Serb culture were sold (after publication in Vienna). In order to create a Serbian entity from the disparate groups of Orthodox peoples who spoke variants of Serbian, the unifying factor of the medieval Serbian state was stressed over the recent past and present.80 This vogue for the privileging of a ‘golden age’ of the ancient over the contemporary was shared by intellectuals of a Romantic bent from Scotland to Cyprus.81 It was enthusiastically transmitted through literature, travel accounts and what might be coyly described as ethnography without any ‘obligation towards the social and material reality’82 of the present. Greek self-identification was encouraged by Greeks of the diaspora and Philhellenes, whose main point of reference was the literary world of the classical Greeks.83 The Ottoman Greeks, many of whom had been highly influential in the running of the state, were even more diverse in their character than the Serbs and their communities were scattered across Asia Minor and the Aegean. In 1893 the state census indicated that of 3.1 million people living in Istanbul, only 1.4 million were actually Muslims, many of the remainder being Greeks.84 The creation of a modern Greek nation was a severe disruption of the history of this people and it led to the severance of the Greek presence in modern Turkey after 1923 and the Treaty of Lausanne.85 Other Balkan groups, such as the Bulgarians and Albanians discovered their medieval or other origins from the eighteenth century onwards and began to organize themselves primarily on national rather than regional or dynastic grounds, or in the case of Croatia in a juridical definition of a ‘1,000 year old state’ which introduces the constitution of 1991.86 Turning back to a ‘golden age’ in the past for the various ethnic groups of the Balkans had implications for neighbouring peoples. For both the Greeks and the Serbs, Macedonia was the object of their historical projections. To some extent the idea of a ‘Greater Greece’ (Megali Idea) rested on the restitution of the Byzantine Empire and the possessions of Alexander of Macedon. For the Serbs, Macedonian territory was part of the medieval legacy from the Empire of Tsar Duåan. Both these national groups undermined and militarily opposed the autonomy of Macedonia and together with Bulgaria parcelled up the Ottoman vilayet in 1913.87 In this region of Europe, the reception of nationalism was complicated by the fact that people who spoke the same language (in functional terms) and were therefore of the same ‘race’ (in the pseudo-biological terminology of nationalism), but had different religions. Croats, Bosnian Muslims, Serbs, Montenegrins all\n\n14\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nspoke a language which was once codified as Serbo-Croat, but in religious or national terms that did not necessarily make them a single entity. Pomaks and Bulgarian Christians were divided by religion and united by language. Slavonic rivalry and reciprocity is an important motif within Balkans nationalism and accounts for much of the intolerance between ethnic groups. Other national frontiers, although apparently easier to discern were also fluid or porous. Montenegrin and Albanian clans exchanged brides. Some Albanians in Kosovo were possibly Albanianized Serbs. One of the reasons why nationalism has been so successful, all but eclipsing other ideologies is that it mimics an essence.88 Quite clearly, there are very few boundaries between what Georg Elwert has referred to as ‘we-groups’89 (i.e. groups of individuals that see themselves as constituting a collectivity) that are not recent and culturally formed and which might therefore constitute an ‘essence’. Many individuals cannot easily be corralled into one ethnic group or another, even if they are the most passionate advocates of the ‘cause’ of that nation. Accusations that his family were in fact Catholic and Croat have dogged the career of the Serb nationalist Vojislav Åeåelj.90 In 1994, Mirjana Marković attacked claims that he was ‘not a son of the Serbian nation spiritually . . . he is an alien, a primitive and aggressive alien’.91 Given that religious boundaries were often quite fluid in some Balkan regions until recently, many individuals would find themselves in the same position as Åeåelj. In Croatia in the 1990s, some individuals even went as far as to change their names to make them seem more definitively ‘Croat’.92 Because it instrumentalizes the language of hearth, home, blood, brotherhood and soil as well as emphasizing the importance of heroism, justice for the ethnic community and sacrifice, modern nationalism successfully merges patriotic emotion and Heimatliebe with primordial (and often quite crude) ideas of difference. Politicians who use the rhetoric of nationalism often appear to gain popular support because they seem to be defending those pre-existing homely values.93 When Slobodan Miloåević visited Kosovo in April 1987 the speech he delivered to pacify the distressed Serbs was a combination of populism94 and a reworking of the Serbian Academy Memorandum about the ‘three tortured questions’ facing the Serb people.95 Two separate ideological skeins became entangled at this crucial point. Nationalism, particularly in its Central European version, with the notion that a single people or Volk/Narod should inhabit a state, affected the sections of the Balkan Christian populations as leaven effects dough,96 and it became thoroughly paradigmatic in Balkan terms of self-reference and self-construction, often eclipsing other older identities. Nationalism was translated into a doctrine of liberation from foreign oppression: initially this meant liberation from the Ottomans, but subsequently the Habsburgs after the 1870s and the Italians and Germans during the First and Second World Wars. The formation of individual states was also seen as part of the manifest destiny of a particular people and this implied that defence of the nation was a patriotic duty. At Gazimestan, near Kosovo Polje, at the site where the Serbs who perished on the field were buried on St Vitus’ day in June 1389, Slobodan Miloåević interpreted the significance of the anniversary of the\n\nThe destruction of tradition 15 medieval Battle of Kosovo polje with reference to the position of Serbs in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: ‘Six centuries later, today again we are at war and waiting for the battle to come.’97 Nationalism was also successful in becoming the ideology that replaced Ottoman culture, ultimately proving more durable than communism, fascism or the peasant politics of the interwar years. Often the actions of committed individuals or of pivotal organizations have proved crucial, and contemporary organizations and entities are keen to claim lineage from political precursors: one hundred years after the foundation of the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) in Salonika, Macedonia was admitted to the UN.98 This nationalism, whatever its aspirations for the future shape of states and whoever it included within the nation thoroughly negated the preceding centuries of Ottoman civilization. In the late eighteenth century, most of the Southeast of Europe was under the dominion of the Porte in Istanbul and had been so since the high Middle Ages. Although it was a cruel and despotic regime in many respects, the Ottoman Empire did far less to try to change the character of their subject peoples than Christian rulers might have. They allowed a form of religious self-government, known as the millet system for Jews and Christians and left much of the day-to-day running of the regions to local governors who were often corrupt, but rarely made much effort to reform society in a Prussian sense. Although until the eighteenth century the state stole away many young men from the Christian Balkans to train them as government officials or janissaries, it did not force populations to homogenize on a grand scale, to speak Arabic or Turkish or adopt Turkish manners (although many did so by dint of the advantages that this gave them). The Ottoman state did not usually force conversion to Islam, although there were a number of instances of jihad (struggle) to combat internal rebellion. Whatever the overall reality of daily existence for Balkan peoples in the Ottoman Empire was (and this is a controversial historical subject which has been somewhat prone to mystification on all sides), the past was vividly constructed as an aberration; a dark age of collective suffering, imprisonment and martyrdom imposed on Balkan Christians by the ‘Infidel’. Centuries of cohabitation and relative tolerance were generally ignored. In his notorious doctoral thesis Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić opined that ‘Bosnia was conquered by an Asian warrior people whose social institutions and customs negated all Christian culture and whose faith . . . interrupted the spiritual life of our country, twisted it and created out of that something totally different.’99 Because nothing good could be gleaned from the more recent past, nationalists frequently took recourse in arguing about ancient and medieval preOttoman polities,100 attempting to create appropriate models for the present from historical fantasies. As a result they frequently became involved and subsequently become involved in arguments about population and settlement in previous centuries or even millennia. For instance the presence of Orthodox people in Krajina was delegitimized by reference to the medieval kingdoms of Tomislav and Zvonimir.101 Even rivers such as the Sava and Drina had enormous power as emotional geographical reference points. This privileging of the past over the present was to have a catastrophic effect in many regions. In Krajina, the majority\n\n16\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nSerb population was constructed as alien by Croat nationalists and their removal the ‘solution to Croatia’s centuries-old problem’,102 just as the majority Albanian population in Kosovo were also seen as a historical ‘squatters’ by Serbian nationalists.103\n\nThe Balkans in international affairs Aside from anthropological, literary and other curiosity, the Balkans has also been the focus of concerted international interest at a diplomatic and political level over the past 200 years. In the nineteenth century the solution to the decline of the ‘sick man of Europe’, namely Turkey, was seen as imperative by almost all concerned, even if they did not agree what should replace it.104 This became the foundation for what was referred to as the ‘Eastern Question’. Antipathy to the Ottomans from the European public and the geopolitical designs of the British, French, Habsburgs and Romanovs in this region turned local revolutionary nationalists into expert practitioners of brinkmanship and the holders of the moral conscience of Europe. A letter sent from ‘Orschowa in Servia’ to the ‘August Council of Sovereigns’ at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 reminded the European diplomats of the groans of an unfortunate nation, whom the Turks are exterminating . . . not more than four days journey from Vienna . . . The ferocious Mussulmans massacre, impale them, violate their women and children, impel them to abjure the religion of their fathers and convert, with insatiable barbarity, all that flourishing country into one vast and gloomy tomb.105 The plight of the Balkan Christians became a familiar theme in European newspapers during the remains of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as political leaders sought recognition as their liberators. Tsar Alexander announced in 1877: ‘Christians of Bulgaria . . . you are passing through a memorable period. The hour of deliverance from Mussulman depotism has at length struck . . . gather closely under the safety of the Russian flag . . . therein lies your strength and your safety.’106 By 1878 and the Congress of Berlin the independence of Montenegro, Serbia and Bulgaria was recognized and the administration of Bosnia and Hercegovina increased the power and hegemony of the Habsburg monarchy in this region. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, which finally saw the end of the Turkish ‘yoke’ and heralded the disintegration of the vilayet of Macedonia, the Balkan states took on recognizably modern national forms. Albania was recognized as an independent state in 1912. At the Treaty of Versailles in 1918, a Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia) was created. In the interwar period, these new states became increasingly unstable, all succumbing to dictatorship by 1929. In the 1930s further fragmentation took place until all the ‘Wilsonian states’ (i.e. those created or recreated at Versailles under the influence of US President Woodrow Wilson) collapsed in 1941 or were kept alive by Axis alliances. During the period 1941–5, the Germans and Italians recreated the map of\n\nThe destruction of tradition 17 Southeastern Europe almost from scratch, indulging the whims of paramilitary groups in exile such as the Croatian fascist Ustaåa and relying on puppet regimes elsewhere. Gradually after 1943, Axis power collapsed and the Balkan countries found themselves divided between the ‘spheres of influence’ of the Soviets, British and Americans in 1945. Since the Soviet sphere was deemed to be almost the entire region except Greece, where there was a bitter Civil War until 1948, which had some ethnic dimensions, the Stalinist model of the ‘national question’ became the dominant paradigm for the postwar Communist regimes. Stalinist nationality policies (codified in the Yugoslavian Constitution in 1946 and in almost identical constitutions in the other communist states) brought a level of peace to the region, but this peace was derived from the barrel of a gun. However, it also ossified certain pressing questions such as the status of Kosovo,107 and failed to provide adequate solutions in areas with large minorities, such as Krajina. The end of communism brought with it an end to the totalitarian solution to the legacy of multiethnicity. The Communists themselves turned into fullyfledged nationalists. In Bulgaria, in the 1980s, in an attempt to bolster his flagging regime the Bulgarian Communist leader Todor Zhivkov tried to force ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian names and many left for Turkey, returning very slowly in the following years. In comparative terms, the period between 1945 and 1985 was one of the most peaceful in the region of the last two hundred years. The transition from communism to nationalism had a disastrous outcome in Yugoslavia as the former republics competed over the shape of borders and the status of ethnic minorities. Had Tito been able to find a viable successor then the preservation of a Yugoslavian identity might have been possible. It seems quite paradoxical in some respects that Yugoslavism did not eclipse the dominant nationalist paradigms among Serbs, Croats and even Slovenes. If we are to regard modern nations as ‘imagined communities’ as Benedict Anderson has argued,108 then it does indeed seem curious that this identity failed to survive the communist period. It may, of course, yet reappear as an Internet phantom or a device for expansionism from one of the existing states. No doubt there will be many intellectuals who having done their best to trash a united Yugoslavia and Yugoslavism in the 1980s will try to rekindle their lost youth with what is known in Croatia as ‘Yugo-nostalgia’. For whatever reason, Yugoslavism did not survive long enough to become the equivalent of a ‘British’ or ‘American’ identity to unite different peoples with a common historical experience. The 1990s brought a new dimension to the ‘Eastern Question’ with the war in Yugoslavia. In the years between 1991 and 1999, war and ethnic cleansing changed the human map in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Kosovo. The overarching cause of these wars was the discontent, which emanated from Serbian communities in all three regions about the implications of the disintegration of the Communist state and the loss of their ‘protection’ from Belgrade. These perhaps legitimate fears of Serb communities were utilized by Slobodan Miloåević, who ruthlessly exploited nationalist discontent, first to gain power by mobilizing agitated Serbs from Kosovo in 1987 and then using the wars and general lawlessness in Croatia and Bosnia from 1991–5 to create a police state in which paramilitaries and criminals lived like\n\n18\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nminor kings, exploiting revenues from smuggling tobacco, drugs, armaments or motor vehicles. Initially the international community appeared to actively support Miloåević, believing naively that he would restore strong government in Yugoslavia and apparently caring very little that this might mean abuses of human rights and a disregarding of the clear democratic wishes of the populations in Croatia and Slovenia for independence in 1991 and subsequently in Macedonia and Bosnia in 1992. United States Secretary of State James Baker visited Belgrade in May 1991 and gave Miloåević the green light to bring the rebel republics of Slovenia and Croatia into line. In the next year a strong impression was created that they and their allies would do little to actively support these new states (the governments of Britain, the United States and France in particular). As a result very little was done to stop the attacks on civilian populations by paramilitaries and remnants of the former Yugoslav People’s army (JNA) that began in Croatia in 1991 and then were carried through to Bosnia with such devastating effect until 1995. During the wars in Yugoslavia the international community was handicapped by its insistence on equating those who used force as part of their political repertoire and those who did not. Mark Wheeler described this attitude as ‘the albatross of bowing and scraping to warlords’109 and this attitude certainly prolonged the agony of the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s as did the attitude that suggested that all parties were equally responsible for the fighting. The embargo on armaments imposed by the United Nations in 1992 meant that the government of Bosnia-Hercegovina was unable to buy military hardware to protect itself from both internal and external aggression. Humanitarian intervention, in the form of the United Nations Protection Force in Croatia and Bosnia, helped to alert the public outside the region to the atrocities being committed and some valuable humanitarian aid was delivered by UN forces and by international agencies such as the Red Cross and numerous private individuals across the world. The role that the media played in highlighting the human tragedies of the wars was also undoubtedly important. Nevertheless, the extent of the problem and the extent to which representatives of the ‘warring factions’ would disingenuously lie during international negotiations and then carry on with their previous military strategies added to a general ‘lack of will’ on the part of the international community to identify in Churchillian terms ‘who was doing the most killing’, and this led to a series of policy blunders. In 1995, the United Nations virtually supervised the ethnic cleansing of its own nominated ‘safe havens’ in Eastern Bosnia in the summer of that year. The Dayton Peace Accords were signed by all the so-called ‘warring factions’ at the end of 1995 after the collapse . of the Bosnian Serb army at Bihac and the loss of Krajina. At Dayton, the issue of Kosovo, with its largely Albanian speaking population was left unresolved and became a major issue in international affairs when the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began to organize armed resistance to the regime of Miloåević in 1998. Failure to resolve this issue in a series of international meetings culminating in Rambouillet in France in 1999, led to air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in March of the same year. Having made an\n\nThe destruction of tradition 19 equation between all sides fighting in the war in Bosnia, the international community then clearly began to see President Miloåević as the chief villain of the piece in the former Yugoslavia. Miloåević sensed that he had been handed personal responsibility for the entire crisis, stating that ‘Rambouillet was not a negotiation . . . It was a Clinton administration diktat . . . it was a recipe for the independence of Kosovo, which clearly we could not accept.’110 In the early 1990s, the USA had seen the Serbian regime as a potential gendarme for the region and a necessary participant in the Dayton accords. By 1999, the Serbian President had been indicted as a war criminal. After the capitulation of the Belgrade government in June 1999, NATO and United Nations forces (KFOR and UNMIK respectively) moved into Kosovo to attempt to rebuild a community shattered by war and ethnic cleansing. In 2001 the United Nations and NATO were embroiled in a dispute between the Albanian community and the government in Macedonia, which flared up seriously in the spring of 2001. In February 1993, the International War Crimes Tribunal was approved by the United Nations Security Council and mandated to prosecute the accused on every side of the war in the former Yugoslavia for war crimes and crimes against humanity. By the beginning of 2001, the Hague Tribunal had indicted less than fifty Serbs out of possible hundreds who took part in atrocities in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. The number of prosecuted from other ethnic groups and nationals was even lower. Its costs had soared to many million dollars by 2001 and it is expected to be in existence for at least until 2004.111 The Hague Tribunal may only ever deal with a tiny percentage of the real criminals who were responsible for ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. Some have already died of natural causes, others are ordinary men or women who may hope to live out their lives as obscure citizens and escape prosecution. Others might live the life of unrepentant exiles in Argentina or elsewhere, like the Ustaåa escapee from the Second World War Dinko Sakić, who was eventually brought to trial and sentenced to a maximum of twenty years in jail in 1999 in a court in Zagreb after having been found personally responsible for the death of 2,000 individuals at the deathcamp of Jasenovac in 1941–5.112 Given the enormity of the crimes committed and the level of infrastructural damage in the region, it is likely that it will remain the focus of international affairs for some years to come. Catching the biggest fish of all for the Hague tribunal, namely Miloåević, in the early summer of 2001, may have tremendous symbolic and even cathartic value, but the prevention of such conflicts should ultimately be a far higher priority for the international community than the limited ‘justice’ that can be meted out after the event.\n\nThemes and motifs The following chapters examine the destruction of tradition and the phenomenon of ethnic cleansing from a number of different thematic angles, including the ideologies of instrumentalization (nationalism, anti-Islam, fascism and communism), the destruction of community and Heimat, symbolic violence, gender-associated\n\n20\n\nThe destruction of tradition\n\nviolence, the Balkan bandit tradition and the ‘use’ of ethno-psychology. The weight of the narrative leans towards Yugoslavia, the contemporary period and the wars in that country in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the themes have been selected because they represent some of the main cultural Leitmotive for interpreting the events of the past two hundred years. In abandoning a more conservative narrative account of serial events with a preference for a thematic approach, it is argued that a chronological narrative per se will not necessarily explain what has taken place in the Balkans. Annales historian Fernand Braudel was acutely aware of the problems associated with l’histoire evénémentielle (the history of events): though by its nature the most exciting and richest in human interest of histories, it is also the most elusive. We must beware of that history which still simmers with the passions of the contemporaries who felt it, described it, lived it, to the rhythm of their brief lives, lives as brief as our own. It has the dimensions of their anger, dreams, and their illusions.113 Indeed a recitation of chronological facts can only serve quantitative purposes and may even lead to gratuitous conclusions about the cyclical nature of violence in this region. It is highly likely that the South East of Europe will now be relatively peaceful for many years to come, with the probable exception of Macedonia. The concluding remarks in Chapter 8 reiterate the importance of countering destructive ideologies by suggesting that radical pluralism and multiethnic societies cannot expect to survive unless they are defended through education and other forms of active ideological support.\n\n2\n\nMountain wreaths Anti-Islam in Balkan Slavonic discourses\n\nThe end of the Ottoman Empire Physical destruction of the Islamic communities of the Balkans is a process that has taken place over the last two hundred years or so as the Ottoman Empire began to fragment. During the period from 1821 to 1922 alone, Justin McCarthy estimates that the ethnic cleansing of Ottoman Muslims led to the death of several million individuals and the expulsion of a similar number.1 Hundreds of thousands of Muslims were also killed, primarily on the grounds of ethnicity, during the Second World War and the Yugoslavian Wars of Dissolution. Ideological marginalization of Islamic communities accompanied the decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire, but as an ideology or a series of related ideas, it draws upon far older prejudices going back to the Middle Ages against the ‘Turk’ and the religion of Islam in panEuropean discourses, which have been used as a justification to persecute Muslims alongside Jews.2 As the Ottoman Empire weakened and rival European powers encouraged the development of nationalist ideologies among the subject peoples, the Muslims in the Balkans sometimes became viewed as a kind of ethnic ‘fifth column’,3 leftover from a previous era, who could never be integrated successfully into the planned future national states. The end of the Ottoman presence has parallels elsewhere with the ‘unmixing of peoples’ that accompanied the post-Imperial age and in itself was not unique to the Balkans (and nor either were hostile discourses towards such populations).4 Sometimes Muslims left the mainland Balkans without the actual use of force, but because they experienced such inconvenience staying in their homes.5 On other occasions, Muslims from the Balkans simply left because they did not want to ‘live as slave where the Turk was previously the master’.6 Individuals whose families had left the Balkans often grew up with this sense of loss. Șevket Aydemir, who was born in Edirne, former Adrianople, in 1897, remembered: ‘ours was a refugee neighbourhood. The flotsam of torrents of refugees torn by war and massacres from the Crimea, Dobruja and the banks of the Danube . . . the returning remnants of the conquering armies.’7 Jovan Cvijić stated Slav Muslims were traditionally seen by Orthodox Serbs as ‘neither Serbs, nor Turks, neither water nor wine, but odious renegades’.8 The struggle to rid themselves of the Ottomans became an important part of selfidentification for the Balkan Christians. It characterized both the culture of the\n\n22\n\nAnti-Islam\n\nliberation movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and older popular culture. In Senj the sixteenth-century heraldic images in the churches included a mace, a winged lion holding in its paws a sword and a severed Turk’s head.9 In Macedonia in the village church in Zlatari, which is dedicated to St Demetrius, ‘the warrior saint, mounted on horseback, is sparing a fallen heathen. The artist in the Zlatari fresco has made no mistake in representing the heathen’s identity. It is clearly a Turkish-looking soldier who is being stabbed by the saint’s spear.’10 In the Morea region of Greece in 1821, there was a popular revolutionary song with the chorus, ‘the Turk shall live no longer, neither in the Morea, nor in the whole earth’.11 Much of the hostility towards Muslims at the level of popular culture has been distilled and then used in the repertoires of extreme nationalists to create an artificially extreme distrust of the Muslims who continued to live in the Balkan region. As Ivan Čolović has argued, what starts out as taunts and literary constructions of hate, can end up as actual practices.12 Extreme nationalist ideas are especially pervasive because they are based on very crude notions of difference. Similar patterns of behavior in extremis and attitudes towards Muslims on the grounds of difference are discernable across the period under consideration. Anti-Islam in the Balkans was initially encouraged and reified by the Western European public who were generally very pro-Christian and represented the Greeks during the war of independence as heirs of the classical epoch in a literal sense. The ‘Bulgarian atrocities’ of the 1870s, as Vesna Goldsworthy points out, set off a very agitated public debate in Britain about the role of the Ottomans, which polarized the Liberal and Tory Parties under Gladstone and Disraeli respectively. The anger was fuelled as ‘reports of mutilation, rape, torture and murder covered the front pages of the British daily papers’.13 In 1876, Thomas Carlyle wrote to The Times calling for ‘the immediate and summary expulsion of the Turk from Europe’. He continued, . . . ‘the peaceful Mongol inhabitants would . . . be left in peace and treated with perfect equity . . . but the governing Turk with all his Pasha and Bashi Bazouks (from the Turkish bași-bözök), should be ordered to disappear from Europe and never to return’.14 Like the legendary appearance of Atatürk with his troops at Nif on the outskirts of Izmir in 1922, the uprisings of Balkan Christians against the Ottoman overlords were interpreted as a quintessential combat between cultures, as a ‘clash of civilizations’ to borrow Samuel Huntington’s contentious term.15\n\nAnti-Islam in Serbian and Montenegrin discourses Because the Serbs were the first people to take up the challenge of driving out the Ottomans and because also much of the literature analysing the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s has looked at the roots of anti-Islamic sentiments, it may be instructive here to look at the Serbian case in more detail. Early Serbian nationalism and the production of a national idea depended very largely on a small number of individuals in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries such the Vuk Karadøić and the ruler of Montenegro, the Vladika (Bishop) Petar II Petrović Njegoå. Many\n\nAnti-Islam\n\n23\n\nof the early Serb intellectuals received their training and developed their ideas under the aegis of the Habsburg Monarchy, so their ideas can be very directly linked to the growth of Romantic nationalism in Central Europe with its emphasis on the national spirit and the authenticity of the common people. However, although the Romantic notion of the srpski narod (the Serb nation) should have included all South Slavs speaking the language which was referred to as SerboCroat from 1850s until 1990s by many commentators and linguists,16 nationalist ideas which developed in the nineteenth century tended to exclude Muslims from the nation, because by adopting Islam they were perceived to have become de facto Ottomans (and were sometimes referred to indiscriminately as ‘Turks’).17 Like many of his contemporaries, Karadøić had historical, linguistic and racial views as to what constituted a nation18. He stated that there were five million people who spoke the same language (åtokavski), but they were divided by religious confession. He added, ‘only the three million Orthodox consider themselves as Serbs . . . [Muslims] think that they are true Turks and call themselves that, despite the fact less than one in a hundred of them knows Turkish.’19 His view of Serbdom combined notions of primordial ethnicity with Herderian linguistic consciousness. To his mind all five million were Serbs, whether they knew it or not, and what had happened in the medieval Empire of Duåan was as important as the intervening centuries, although he specifically did want to take out Turkish loan words from the Serbian language.20 He was, however, one of the first writers to use the word ‘cleanse’ (očistiti), with all its Christian overtones of the redemptive powers of baptism, to describe the killing of Muslims in Belgrade in 1806.21 Karadøić, who spent many years as a protégée of the Slovene linguist and Imperial librarian Jernej Kopitar in Vienna in the early nineteenth century, was one of the scholars responsible for codifying and thus elevating the scattered ballads of the guslars (players of a stringed instrument, the gusle) into a national literary canon.22 One of the most important themes of these epic poems was the struggle against Ottoman domination and many had ancient motives, which can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Interest in South Slav epic poetry, which was exceptionally well-preserved at the turn of the nineteenth century, was found all over Europe at the time.23 Walter Scott translated the ballad of Hasanaginica into English and Jacob Grimm read and favourably reviewed Karadøić’ work.24 The appeal of epic poetry was not just cultural. To some extent Serb anti-Ottoman sentiment and activity suited the geopolitical interests of both Habsburgs and the Romanovs at that time. As a cultural artefact it has left a long-lasting mark on Serb and Montenegrin national consciousness. An important text, and arguably the most important single text to encourage the idea of a historical betrayal by Slavs who had converted to Islam was the poem Gorski Vijenac (The Mountain Wreath) published in 1847 by Petar II Petrović Njegoå, who was the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro from 1830 until his early death in 1851. The main theme of the poem is the supposed dilemma faced by his predecessor Vladika Danilo (1700–35) about what to do with Montenegrins who had become Muslim. The poem contains many references to smiting Slav Muslims, including the threat of Vojvoda Batrić that: ‘we will burn down Turkish homes so\n\n24\n\nAnti-Islam\n\nthat no trace of the dwellings of our home-grown faithless devils could be known’.25 Vladeta Popović described Njegoå’ poem as revealing the ‘essence and substance of a race that has had to go through many tribulations and fight against many difficulties’26 thereby giving it the status of a genuine historical account rather than the poetic vision of an educated man who had read Ossian as well as Ivanhoe and the Greek classics.27 Gorski Vijenac was read by subsequent generations of Montenegrins and other South Slavs, achieving canonical status very rapidly. It has been called a ‘true breviary of interethnic hatred’.28 It is probably the chief textual link between the discourse about Islam and everyday life for the people themselves. For Milica Bakić Hayden, ‘[Njegoå’] depictions of the converts as traitors whose weakness and opportunism deprived them of the religious and cultural identity bequeathed to them by their forefathers in Kosovo are reflected in popular – if tacit – perception of Muslims among Serbs and Montenegrins’.29 For Nobel prize winning novelist Ivo Andrić, Njegoå was ‘the complete expression of our basic, deepest collective sentiment, for this motto (let be what cannot be!) deliberately or not, led all our struggles for freedom until modern times’.30 The youthful members of Mlada Bosna who competed for the privilege to assassinate Archduke France Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 had all memorized Gorski Vijenac31 and believed it was their manifest destiny as good Serbs to drive out foreign rulers, be they Turks or Habsburgs.32 Whether Njegoå’ work represents a kind of Urtext for popular sentiment or whether he was largely informed by popular culture is a moot point. Jovan Cvijić mentions an eighteenth-century case of a Montenegrin of the Ozrinić tribe who dreamt that he was to rid himself of his Muslim neighbours, which he then did and similar things may have occurred elsewhere in the form of a nocturnal culture in waiting.33 Therefore it is not completely fair to isolate a single text from the context in which it was written, that is Montenegrin, which was almost an island of non-Ottoman government in the Balkans. However it is probable that Montenegro’s identity, particularly its quintessentially non-Islamic character, was manipulated by its intellectuals and other nineteenth-century writers of pan-Serbian sympathies. Research by the anthropologist Zorka Milich, carried out in 1990, indicates that many stereotypes in Montenegro have part of their origin in the nineteenth century and thus form a direct link to the nationalism of Njegoå, rather than some older tribal culture. Milich herself is not entirely uncritical about Montenegrin culture as it has been traditionally constructed, stating ‘though the uninitiated might find many of the tribal practices of Montenegro primitive and distressing, it is essential that they be viewed in the context of a traditional warrior society – original and unpolluted’.34 Nevertheless, her research represents a tremendous repository of popular beliefs and reflections on custom. She questioned a number of centegenarian women in Montenegro and uncovered a wide range of beliefs about and prejudices against Muslims. Some of them exhibited mistrust and dislike of ‘Turks’, others only a mild awareness of difference. Jovana, aged 102, stated that ‘[t]he Turks were evil. When they saw a good Serb, they did everything in their power to kill him.’35 She remarked that the custom allowing a widow to marry her husband’s brother was ‘disgusting’ and the use of cosmetics by the women made\n\nAnti-Islam\n\n25\n\nthem ‘stink’. She also felt that the wearing of a veil was a ‘strange custom’, prefacing this remark with ‘who knows why?’.36 Another informant, Ljubica aged 112, when asked her opinion of poturice (Christian converts to Islam) replied: ‘[M]ost of the Turks round here are our people . . . They should be ashamed of themselves. Their religion is not better than ours.’37 An ambivalence towards Muslims, from Karadøić onwards is an important aspect of Serbian and Montenegrin national consciousness. Although some were clearly of an eliminationalist mindset (and here Njegoå is clearly of this orientation), others believed that Muslims were redeemable for the nation. This problematic remains central, even amongst the most extreme Æetnici. In Foča in Bosnia during the Second World War they were about to kill a Muslim who pleaded with them that he had been a patriotic Serb. They replied, ‘Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you are a Turk. And since you helped us, we shall not torture you.’ Instead the man was shot.38 Certainly anti-Islam was not confined to Serbs and Montenegrins: after the Second World War, it was also commonplace in the popular culture of the other republics of Yugoslavia and was not a problem that the Communists ever dealt with forcefully, despite a commitment to brotherhood and unity. Gorski Vijenac was read as a school textbook in Communist Yugoslavia in every republic and available in Slovene and Macedonian translations. That is not to say that every person who read these texts were ‘contaminated’ by their poetical content: Tim Judah discusses a conversation between Aleksa Djilas and his cousin. ‘How did the Muslims in your class react when they had to read The Mountain Wreath and learn parts of it by heart?’ His cousin was dumbstruck. ‘It had never crossed his mind to ask his Muslim classmates such a question – even though some were his close friends. Clearly he did not connect them with the Muslims against whom Njegoå wrote.’39 Most canons of national literature contain elements that are not in keeping with a contemporary emphasis on what Richard Rorty has called ‘sentimental education’.40 The plays of William Shakespeare could quite easily be used to construct contemporary Francophobe or anti-Semitic stereotypes. An acquaintance of mine claimed that a relative of his had insisted on using the term ‘blackamoor’ to refer to North Africans, a term she had ‘reinvented’ by reading Othello. Most adult speakers of the English language consciously and sub-consciously use Shakespearian phrases in everyday language.41 As Anthony Smith has pointed out John of Gaunt’s eulogy of England in Richard II still has considerably evocative power.42 During the Second World War a Montenegrin priest amongst the Partisans, who was reading Gorski Vijenac aloud was asked to remain silent by a hodøa: ‘Please don’t say that bit about the Turks. It won’t go down well with the Muslims.’43 After the war, despite the goodwill and/or naivety of certain individuals it is sometimes clear that the educational system of the Communists failed to tackle the problem of discrimination in literature. One Muslim from the Bosnian village of Dolina who was born in 1953 told Tone Bringa during some of the\n\n26\n\nAnti-Islam\n\nlessons he and his classmates had been portrayed as the losers throughout twentieth-century Yugoslav history. Furthermore, particularly Muslim cultural characteristics (such as modes of dress and speech) were branded old-fashioned. So the message inherent in the socialist progressive Yugoslav education system was that ‘“muslimness” belonged to the past’.44 In the 1980s in Bosnia, Muslim habits were frequently seen as rustic ‘old-fashioned’ and ‘village-like’.45 In that sense the elimination of Muslim communities, as envisaged by extremists, was a war on tradition and the past. This had already begun to happen in the nineteenth century with the destruction of intricate town planning and clumsy introduction of more Western styles in town planning.46 In Bulgaria in the mid-1980s, the Communist militia would ‘go from house to house and anything that resembled a Turkish garment they would seize, tear up and trample in the mud’.47 As Radoslav Radenkov remarked ‘[a]ncient folk costumes that had been passed down . . . were taken from old wooden chests and thrown onto heaps outside. To this pile would be added all books found in Turkish [including] . . . the Koran.’48 In the year 1989 when Bulgarian Turks were free to leave for Turkey, some 370,000 left, although 155,000 returned within a year.49 Mistrust of Muslims, both Slav Muslims and Kosovars, existed alongside tolerance at an unofficial level in Yugoslavia, but it needed to be awakened by nationalist intellectuals after 1974 to have a significant political impact. Moreover, the ineffective response of the Communist authorities to the national question, only belatedly allowing Muslims to define themselves ‘in the ethnic sense’ after 1971 and allowing them forms of ethnic individuation such as the wearing of traditional dress and the building of new mosques was too little too late to prevent the drift into rival extreme nationalisms. After the death of Tito, many lost their inhibitions about openly nationalist politics.50 During the mobilization of Serbian nationalism in the late 1980s by Slobodan Miloåević, his supporters (particularly in Montenegro) would turn up to rallies with placards with provocative anti-Islamic slogans: ‘Oh Muslims, you black crows,51 Tito is not around to protect you,’ or ‘I’ll be the first, who will be the second to drink some Turkish blood?’.52 The main themes of the rallies were traditional Serb nationalism, and relations with the Kosovo Albanians were more prominent than incipient threats towards Slav Muslims. Nevertheless, the forces that Miloåević unleashed cannot be regarded as insignificant when viewing the subsequent events of the 1990s.53 In invoking the influence of Gorski Vijenac or any folkloric text, it would be as well to be careful to avoid essentialization about the nature of Serb or Montenegrin culture and national consciousness. Folklore and the analysis of other texts from popular culture are very often used in the literature on the Balkans to make rather sweeping assertions about national character. Ivo Rendić-Miočević characterizes the Dinaric Serbs as suffering from ‘projection’, ‘narcissism’ and ‘paranoia’, which he dubs the ‘Prince Marko syndrome’54 with its obvious idea of the continuity of folk traditions from the epic songs of the guslari to the present day. Branimir Anzulović is also undeterred about making pronouncements about the link between popular culture and violence.\n\nAnti-Islam\n\n27\n\nIn Balkan highland culture, violence is often taken for granted, without any sense of guilt or sorrow for the victims . . . A high level of violence and the condoning of the most vicious cruelty as just punishment can be observed in the Serbian folk song ‘Grujo’s Wife’s Treachery’.55 If we were to try and create other personality types on this basis, we could state that the Americans had a morbid fascination with drowning because they sing ‘Clementine’ or that the English had a fixation with decapitation because they sing ‘Oranges and Lemons’. Recent critics of the political use of folklore in the 1990s have pointed to ways in which folklore has been misused by the Croatian and Serbian governments.56 A realization of the part that governments, nationalist ideologues and the media have played should deter scholars from making unguarded comments about popular culture. The many foreign writers who have visited the Balkans since the early nineteenth century also helped to circulate and replicate the singular notion57 of Ottoman oppression versus Serb or Montenegrin heroism and were often moved by the idea of the perpetual struggle against the Turks, (although many expressed their horror at brutal spectacles such as the dozens of severed and desiccated Turks’ heads surrounding the Vladika residence in Cetinje).58 In his poem ‘Montenegro’, Tennyson sought to encapsulate many of the contemporary European images of a perpetual and valorous struggle between Orthodox and Muslim communities: They kept their faith, their freedom, on the height. Chaste, frugal, savage, arm’ed by day and night Against the Turk; . . . O smallest among peoples! rough rock-throne Of Freedom! warriors beating back the swarm Of Turkish Islam for five hundred years, . . .59 For many of these foreign writers, the Ottomans, their culture and the lands that they ruled for centuries were constructed within a literary trope, which has been described by Edward Said as ‘Orientalism’,60 which was set up as opposite and inferior to the supposed values of Europe or the Occident. As part of a general rejection of the past, South Slav writers began to use the same tropes to describe the Ottomans as other European writers (although it is also fair to state that for many foreign writers Southeastern Europe still had many ‘oriental’ characteristics or more particularly Balkan features, which set them apart from Europe.61) Ryan Gingeras has studied anti-Ottoman sentiment press coverage in Britain during the Illinden Uprising in Macedonia, which depicted Islam as being essentially violent in its nature and the Turk as ‘savage’, ‘barbarian’ or ‘fanatical’. He quotes from the Manchester Guardian when it commented that ‘slaughter of children, outrage against women, devastation, mark the path of these Turkish savages in 1903, just as seven centuries ago they marked the path of Ghenghiz Khan’.62 Serb and Montenegrin rejection of their own Islamic heritage was part of a European-wide Zeitge"
