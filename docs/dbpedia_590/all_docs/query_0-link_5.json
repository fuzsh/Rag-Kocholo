Wundt (1832−1921) in several of his writings: in his book Contemporary philosophy I (Savremena filozofija I) Dvorniković places Wundt's philosophical thought between Kantian and extra-Kantian movements on one side, and on the other evolutionary philosophy as represented by its main proponent, Herbert Spencer. Wundt started as a physiologist and only later turned towards psychology. For Wundt psychology is a special, empirical science and he divides it in two parts: experimental psychology and psychology of nations. The psychology of nations presents a completion oft he experimental psychology. Psychology, having been founded in this way, is further a basis for the following philosophical disciplines: logic, epistemology, ethic and sociology.\n\nKeywords\n\nVladimir Dvorniković; Wilhelm Wundt; philosophy; psychology\n\nHrčak ID:\n\n78752\n\nURI\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/78752\n\nPublication date:\n\n30.1.2012.\n\nArticle data in other languages: croatian"
