        "text": "Reflecting on the complex relationship between the affective, the aural, and the political, this issue points out the limits of existing interpretative discourses of music and memory in post-Yugoslav spaces, which underplay the lived intensity of the sensory experiences, emotional investment, and the affective technologies of remembering the past. The authors here argue that the emphasis on the social and political production of affect embedded in the experience of music might be beneficial for shedding new light on memory politics in a post-Yugoslav context. Examining why and how music matters for post-Yugoslav memory practices, the articles in this issue strive to fashion new readings that go beyond the dichotomies commonly drawn between political/nostalgic, commercial/engaged, and escapist/emancipatory. The issue thus argues that the sensorial politics of music can serve as a conceptual framework that provides an important base for new theorizations of Yugoslav cultural memories, which is done by focusing on the politics of sentimentalism and the politics of joy. Accordingly, the goal of this issue is to raise productive questions that resonate with a multiplicity of interpretational and theoretical dilemmas and gaps by mobilizing the tools of affect theory primarily to open a space and spur further criticism and theory.\n\nThe tropes of East and West in the discursive formations centered on ethnic and folk music have taken various historical forms, with the ever-changing and complex relation of Orientalism and Occidentalism qua Balkans. The contemporary discourses on world music in Serbia and in the wider space of shared popular culture of former Yugoslavia often rely on a rich elaboration of ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ elements of musical style, tradition and history that serve as an important axiological and aesthetic point of reference. During the early phase of development of Serbian and regional world music/ethno scenes in the mid-nineties, the idea of ‘East’ vs. ‘West’ was frequently evoked in terms of musical sound, but also in the context of bringing out the histories and divergent strains of musical traditions in the process of redefining the ethnoscapes (Appadurai), with a resulting conceptual tapestry of intertwined ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ features that is by no means univocal. Certain strains of world music (loose) network of the Balkans exemplify how the binary East – West is being debated, negotiated or even deconstructed and, moreover, how a strategically non-essentialist, but at the same time ‘thick’ identification and sense of belonging is being created and offered as an alternative to more conservative or exclusive concepts of ethnic cultural identities in the region. This can be observed in the revival of musical traditions and genres that historically did rely on the blending of Eastern (Oriental) features and local musical styles. Revivals and newly formed fusion scenes like Bosnian nova sevdalinka (new sevdalinka song), Serbian vranjska pesma (the song of Vranje), or the cultural events like Belgrade’s Ethno Fusion fest with a proclaimed tendency to draw parallels between Balkan and South Mediterranean musical heritage, all share a common trait or at least an important structural homology: namely, a goal to differently inscribe common poles of triad Eastern – Western – local and to remove the whole debate from the essentialist discourses that often dominate the public sphere of former Yugoslavian nation-states. The very idea of the “bridge between East and West”, therefore, takes a different (political) form, where the musicians as social actors refuse to be caught in the imago of the Big Other, but instead propose a different, dislocated reading of a common cultural habitus, in favor of a possible, newly-imagined Balkans.\n\nThe publication explores practices of critical contemporary fine arts – practices of research, progressive and experimental actions by contemporary fine artists from the 1990s to the present, in four countries in the region – Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. These are practices which focus on issues such as identity aspects (national, cultural, religious, ethnic), workers’ rights, social integration of minorities, global market fluctuation trends and its impact in the local context, unscrupulousness of capital, the position of women, spatial devastation, art institution system issues, and many others. The publication maps out and theoretically reviews critical and research practices, and contemporary fine arts practices oriented towards the contemporary civilization moment, which have been active in the context of the independent cultural scene since the 1990s, but which have also been present in the institutional frame. The authors provide only drafts of the political, social, economic and cultural changes of the local contexts, through four segments, due to a lack of space. Each segment focuses on the practices and context of a given country, i.e. the capital as the primary focus, and in addition to the introductory word by the authors, it includes interviews (with authors, theorists, curators, organizers…) who contribute to the recording of these artistic practices based on their experience, work and knowledge. The segments deal with the Belgrade, Ljubljana, Skopje, and Zagreb scenes. All the authors devised their approaches in an effort to present the fruitful and creative production of these cities, to the greatest extent possible. The authors involved in the creation of this publication are Jasna Jakšić (in collaboration with Tihana Bertek, Maja Gujinović, Ana Kovačić, Srđan Latrezom, Petar Novak, Tino Novak, Tamara Sertić and Leda Sutlović) from Croatia, Nebojša Vilić from Macedonia, Vesna Tašić (in collaboration with Vesna Milosavljević and Miroljub Marjanović) from Serbia, and Miha Colner and Nika Grabar (Slovenia). http://talkingcriticarts.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/ltca-publication-%E2%80%93-from-consideration-to-commitment-art-in-critical-confrontation-to-society-belgrade-ljubljana-skopje-zagreb-1990-2010/"
