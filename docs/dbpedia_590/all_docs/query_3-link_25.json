He recalls when he was young, children played with bones more often. According to Vladimir, various games using ankle bones develop flexibility, agility, and muscle in childrenâs hands. Ankles bones are taken from the back legs of a cow or a sheep. It is possible to determine the age and health of animals by examining this particular bone. Arcadia\n\nVladimir Lenin on Oblomov\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\njaved akhtar\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This research paper tends to highlight Vladimir Leninâs views and attitude towards work and indolence. Therefore, he admires work, action and revolution, which are characteristics of the proletarians, and condemns lethargy, inertia, indolence, indecision and procrastination, which are peculiar to the surf-owning and land-owning feudal nobility. Â Vladimir Lenin condemns Ivan Goncharovâs most famous character Oblomov frequently in his speeches and writings, which represents the surf-owning and land-owning feudal nobility of the nineteenth-century Tsarist Russian social formation. In fact, Oblomov like other literary types have definite historical roots, which are closely related to the way of life of a particular class. In this manner, his class nature or Oblomovism typifies the sloth of the serf-owning and land-owning nobility. These traits of Oblomov have not become out-dated but the class they typify has become something of the past. Vladimir Lenin pays full attention to the lasting and broad-scale implications of Oblomovâs character, which crosses the limits of his social milieu and age, picking up the penetrating insight into the class nature of Oblomovâs character. Vladimir Lenin highlights the continuing relevance of Oblomovâs character in his own times, criticising Oblomov and Oblomovism and identifies his political rivals and enemies around him with Oblomov.\n\nVladimir Panov : obvinenija nado dokazÃµvat / Vladimir Panov ; interv.

Rap career is an illustration of this process. It was created in the late seventies and eighties of the twentieth century in New York ghettos and today it represents one of the most popular genres on the global scale. Rap is not only a symbol of revolution and the domination of Western capitalist business practices but also a cultural tool by which different groups, often marginalized or considering themselves as such, express their own identity. I am analyzing the indicated above phenomenon using two, extreme at first glance, examples. First, I present the story of the emergence and development of hip-hop culture in the United States. I try to show how rap music, which is an important element of this culture, allowed a marginalized part of American society for manifesting and communicating their views, beliefs and values, becoming a âtransmission channelâ for various ideologies, including the ideology of black nationalism. In the second part of the text, I am additionally analyzing the artwork and public appearances by Tadeusz âTadekâ Polkowski, a Polish rapper, whom I consider a representative of an expanding hip-hop society relating to or sympathizing with the national movement. The music he creates is designed not only to restore the Polesâ âmemoryâ, and therefore also the pride in their heroic and admirable past, but also to open their eyes to what is happening in their country that he believes is being colonized by the occupants. Â Rap jako muzyka toÅ¼samoÅciowa: od czarnego getta do polskiego pop-nacjonalizmu We wspÃ³Åczesnym Åwiecie wytwory kultury, technologie, informacje i ideologie coraz czÄÅciej przenikajÄ z jednego spoÅeczeÅstwa do drugiego, przekraczaj\n\nBishop Daniil's \"Epistle to Vladimir monomach\". About spiritual teachings\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRomoli, Francesca\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe article focuses on the Epistle to Vladimir Monomach (Poslanie k Vladimiru Monomachu) written by bishop Daniil (â 1121). The author offers an analysis based on the literary and pragmatic function of biblical quotations within the text. Through it, she establishes that the Epistle belongs to the literary form of spiritual teachings. She then considers the liturgical and historical circumstances surrounding the genesis of the text by comparing it with the Epistle to Vladimir Monomach on fast...\n\nVladimir Geenius Nabokov (1899-1977) / Toomas Raudam\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nRaudam, Toomas, 1947-\n\n2003-01-01\n\nArvustus: Nabokov, Vladimir.

His field of expertise primarily covered X-ray examinations, including dosimetry of X-rays. Glumac performed one of the first projects to implement protection against X-rays (Zagreb Hospital Sisters of Charity, in 1931). Glumac was also active in popularising science, including radiation science. As a true visionary, he predicted that new devices associated with atomic technology would in the future enable the treatment of diseases that had resisted medical treatments for centuries. By searching through the available archives and known literature, we attempted to shed more light on the life and work of this distinguished expert and obtain a more systematic insight into the previously unknown details important for the history and development of radiation science, radiation protection, and medical physics. The work and opus of Vladimir Glumac show that scientists and experts who worked in Croatia not only followed the most advanced scientific knowledge in these areas from the very beginning, but also actively contributed to them.

Considering the ample and multifaceted scientific feats, only some are touched in a very brief manner. However, it is necessary to highlight his contributions to neurology, with the description of structures, signs and syndromes, to physiology, including reflexology, which later underpinned behaviorism, to psychology, including objective psychology and suggestion. His accomplishments and legacy remained until the present days. Some comments about the scenery that involved his death are also presented.\n\nThe musical centers of the brain: Vladimir E. Larionov (1857-1929) and the functional neuroanatomy of auditory perception.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTriarhou, Lazaros C; Verina, Tatyana\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn 1899 a landmark paper entitled \"On the musical centers of the brain\" was published in PflÃ¼gers Archiv, based on work carried out in the Anatomo-Physiological Laboratory of the Neuropsychiatric Clinic of Vladimir M. Bekhterev (1857-1927) in St. Petersburg, Imperial Russia. The author of that paper was Vladimir E. Larionov (1857-1929), a military doctor and devoted brain scientist, who pursued the problem of the localization of function in the canine and human auditory cortex. His data detailed the existence of tonotopy in the temporal lobe and further demonstrated centrifugal auditory pathways emanating from the auditory cortex and directed to the opposite hemisphere and lower brain centers. Larionov's discoveries have been largely considered as findings of the Bekhterev school. Perhaps this is why there are limited resources on Larionov, especially keeping in mind his military medical career and the fact that after 1917 he just seems to have practiced otorhinolaryngology in Odessa. Larionov died two years after Bekhterev's mysterious death of 1927. The present study highlights the pioneering contributions of Larionov to auditory neuroscience, trusting that the life and work of Vladimir Efimovich will finally, and deservedly, emerge from the shadow of his celebrated master, Vladimir Mikhailovich.

G. Zirin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available By 2010, on the background of the steady increase in the incidence of malignant tumors in the Vladimir area, primary oncological care level worked inefficiently.Condition of material and technical base of the Vladimir Regional Clinical Oncological Dispensary was also unsatisfactory. All these problems required solution in the form of the National Oncology Program realization in the region. The National Oncological Program has begun to work in the Vladimir region since 2011.

They are: Increase of 5-year survival value of patients with malignant tumors after diagnosis date to 51.4%; Increase the number of malignant tumors early detection cases at the IâII stages up to 51%; Decrease the mortality rate of working age population to 99 per 100 000; Decrease of mortality within one year from the first time of cancer diagnosis to 27%. The following main objectives such as radically improved the material and technical base of oncology dispensary; modern methods of prevention, diagnosis and patients treatment improvement and introduction; the system providing population cancer care focused on the cancer early detection and the specialized combined antitumor treatment provision are realized in order to achieve these goals. The implementation of the tasks allowed to achieve positive dynamics of Vladimir region population cancer care indicators. All the main targets of the National Oncology Program for the Vladimir region were achieved successfully. Implementation of the National Oncology Program has had an extremely positive effect on the cancer services development of, as well as for the health of the entire population of the Vladimir region.\n\nVladimir I.

The thematic content establishes several marks of his activity trying to bring value to the musicianâs personality for getting to know him better.

The proposed analytical approach reveals the celebrated personâs thorough professional training, which coupled with the methodical qualities, developed in time, enabled him to attract the studentsâ interest in the study of music, combining the scientific rigour with harmony and consistency with composure in the educational process. Reviewing Vladimir Axionovâs professional performance, the author emphasizes both the depth of his scientific and pedagogical approach and his devotion to the art of music and the outstanding results achieved in this area.\n\nChristian Bergqvist, Vladimir Bastidas, Henrik Ballebye Okholm, Torben ThorÃ¸ Pedersen, Eirik Ãsterud: Where Do We Stand on Discounts? - A Nordic Perspective\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nFejÃ¸, Jens\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAnmeldelse af: Christian Bergqvist (red.), Vladimir Bastidas, Henrik Ballebye Okholm, Torben ThorÃ¸ Pedersen & Eirik Ãsterud: Where Do We Stand on Discounts? - A Nordic Perspective.

The research used qualitative approach by applying library research using psychological theory introduced by Sigmund Freud. The data source was Lolita, an English novel, written by Vladimir Nabokov. The analysis is divided into three parts; they are the identification of main character, characterization, and pedophilia. The findings were as follows. First, the main character was Humbert as his high intensity in all the events that build the whole story. Second, the characterization described that the main character was obsessive, possessive, and immoral. Third, the role of literary work revealed pedophilia phenomenon. Finally, it can be concluded that the literary work has played a very important role in revealing the social phenomenon.Â Â\n\nBalance of threat: The domestic insecurity of Vladimir Putin\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRobert Person\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available During the 17 years that Vladimir Putin has ruled Russia, the country has become increasingly authoritarian. However, I argue that this rollback of democracy has not been motivated by Putin's blind desire to maximize his political power, as many have assumed. Rather, his anti-democratic policies have responded to perceived specific threats to his control. In applying theories originally developed in the field of international relations to individual leaders, we can understand Putin as a âdefensive realistâ who balances against threats in order to maintain security rather than maximize power. This is an essential distinction that produces important conclusions about what motives lie behind the increasingly authoritarian character of the Russian state and gives insights into the possible future trajectory of the regime.\n\nThe Mystery of the Conversion of the Prince Vladimir and His Covenants to Russian People\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSekachev Vasilii\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The article is dedicated to the circumstances of Baptism of Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Prince Vladimir.

If the term of office of the head of state were not prolonged in 2008, then the seventh presidential election would take place today, and therefore, a critical question arises: âWhat has been done and what needs to be done?... What does the President have in store for the people?â\n\nVladimir Nabokov: A Case Study of Multilingualism and Translation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaulina Rothermel\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This article explores the relationship between translation and multilingualism through an examination of Vladimir Nabokovâs works and views on the topic. The main idea of the article is that translation is one of the implications of multi-competence, as defined by Vivian Cook in 1991, and as such is reliant on the translatorâs cultural grounding. In Nabokovâs case, multilingualism and multiculturalism resulted in some very specific approaches in his own translation, as well as in his setting of canons for other translators to follow. Advocacy of the literal style in transliteration which remains faithful to the original author constitutes evidence of the utmost appreciation for the broadening of mental horizons that such foreignization may bring. Some rendering of Nabokovâs works into Polish, and the following of his directives in those renditions, were also analyzed by the author of the article.\n\nAve sol contra excrementum : Kiri / Harri Tibar\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nTibar, Harri\n\n1996-01-01\n\nPeeter Sauteri novell 'KÃµhuvalu'.

Dissemination of anti-Communist ideals (often in liberal and literary guises was the mandate of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, whose funding and editorial initiatives included the publication of both pre-Revolution Russian literature and, more notoriously, the journal Encounter (1953-1990, where Nabokovâs fiery âReplyâ to Wilson appeared.

This article adopts a different stance, focusing on two Old Testament motifs ...\n\nThe Phenomenon of Superheat of Liquids: In Memory of Vladimir P.

He has received worldwide recognition for his monograph on metastable liquids published in 1972 (the English edition was published in 1974). We briefly discuss some studies deal with the phenomenon of attainable superheat of liquids and with measurements of thermophysical properties of liquids under conditions of a moderate degree of superheat. Main attention is paid to the studies performed by V.P. Skripov and his research group in the 1960s and 1970s. Experimental methods which provided break-throughs in research on both spontaneous boiling-up kinetics and substance properties (the specific volume, isobaric heat capacity, ultrasound speed, and viscosity) in super-heated states are presented.\n\nTHE ROLE PLAYED BY MUSICOLOGIST N.

This article proposes to examine the notions of distance and limit which shape the consciousness of a foreigner / outsiderâVladimir Nabokov. Nabokov lost his native land when he was 18, and was condemned to remain a stranger in a foreign land. In his fiction, many âestrangedâ characters are to be found, especially as main focalizers or first-person narrators. The present article thus demonstrates how the concept of frontier is crucial to interpreting such alien status: these characters are forever estranged, due to geographical borders, temporal distances or linguistic barriers. Nabokov, himself a trilingual writer, challenged the very idea of a foreign language. His English, which he claimed was merely âsecond rateâ, is indeed quite different from the style of American classics, yet it has a unique poetic flavor. Maybe because he âdid not think in any language, but in imagesâ, his condition as a foreigner was not felt as alienating. Contrary to most of his characters, hybridization seems to have been a powerful element inspiring his artistic impulse, as illustrated in his extraordinary linguistic virtuosity and his constant playing on words. Similarly, the repeated inclusion of other semiotic codes (painting, photography, advertisements,â¦ shows that by playing with limits and the interpenetration of familiar and strange(r elements, Nabokov found a creative alternative to the usually alienating condition of being a foreigner.\n\nState Civilisation : The Statist Core of Vladimir Putinâs Civilisational Discourse and Its Implications for Russian Foreign Policy\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLinde, Fabian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe essay examines Vladimir Putinâs civilisational discourse, which arose in earnest with the publication of his presidential campaign articles in 2012. It argues that what makes Putinâs rendering of Russiaâs civilisational identity distinctive is its strongly emphasized Statism, understood as a belief in the primacy of the state. This suggests that while his endorsement of a distinct civilisational identity represents an important conceptual turn as regards how national identity is articulat...\n\nLolita de Vladimir Nabokov: historia de una obsesiÃ³n (fÃ­lmica\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKatixa Agirre MiguÃ©lez\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available El presente artÃ­culo trata de demostrar la simbiosis existente entre la novela Lolita y el arte cinematogrÃ¡fico. No sÃ³lo por las dos adaptaciones de las que ha sido objeto la novela de Vladimir Nabokov, sino tambiÃ©n por las propias caracterÃ­sticas estilÃ­sticas y narrativas de la novela, plagada de referencias y recursos puramente cinematogrÃ¡ficos. Recurso clave durante toda la novela, la tÃ©cnicacinematogrÃ¡fica se convierte en el mejor aliado del narrador no fiable âHumbert Humbertâ en su lucha por dominar a Lolita y manipular al lector.

Barabanov\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The subject of the article is dedicated to the evolution of the visible accent on the role of history and historico-civilizational heritage in formulation of Russia's foreign policy strategy in conceptual speeches of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin in 2013-2015. His thesis on Russia as a country-civilization, proclaimed in Summer-Autumn 2013, became the basis for serious practical steps for activization of the foreign policy of Russia starting from 2014. It became clear mainly during the Ukrainian crisis, but also other key international events of the last two years. Another significant element of such a strategy was the thesis on the sacrality of history for Russia, exceeding far beyond a traditional focus on using the historical memory in current politics, that one can see in other states' examples. The consequence of that thesis is the feeling of specific historical responsibility in front of Russia for state politicians, also formulated by President Putin. All this could be considered as a new dimension of the moral basis of politics. One more focus of the article is on the role of new public political panels for proclaiming such a historically motivated politics, like the Valdai Discussion Club, etc.\n\nIntegrated and Inclusive Higher Education in Vladimir State University: Current State and Development Perspectives\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYegorov I.N.,\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper summarizes the many years of experience in methodological support and training at the Center of Professional Education for the Disabled and at the âInclusive Educationâ Research and Educational Center of the Vladimir State University.

Building upon insights by Alexander Gerschenkron about the economic development of âbackwardsâ states, it argues that both Nicholas and Putin have rhetorically used Western concepts such as nationalism and democracy to legitimize their rule but have modified them to give them more statist content. Under Nicholas, this was exemplified in the tripartite (Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality Official Nationality policy. Putin has emphasized patriotism, power, and statism to justify centralization of power and authoritarian policies. Putin's policies and rhetoric are strong analogs to those of Nicholas. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to explain state-inspired Russian nationalism and how it has been aligned with authoritarian politics, as well as specifying similarities between present and past in Russia.\n\nââI think that the small peptides are the best for healthy ageingâ¦ââ, an interview with Vladimir Khavinson\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nRattan, Suresh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSince its inception in 2000, Biogerontology has published interviews with some of the most renowned and intellectually influential biogerontologists, including Len Hayflick, Robin Holliday, Denham Harman,VincentCristofalo, Claudio Franceschi, Leslie Robert, Ken Kitani, Geroge Martin, Zhores Medve......

One can find it as well in Vladimir Makanin's âUndergroundâ as in two novels written by Viktor Pelevin, âGeneration âPââ and âChapaev and Emptinessâ. After the fall of Soviet power Pelevin's cynical hero from âGeneration âPââ changes from literature into advertising business, and in his novel âChapaev and Emptinessâ the legendary Soviet Civil War hero Chapaev transforms into a preacher of quasi-Buddhist nothingness. Makanin's hero, the writer Petrovich, renounces of his profession in order to work as a watchman in shelters for the homeless. His self-abasement is in accordance with the tradition of kenoticism (derived from the Greek word kenÃ³sÂ =Â empty which played an important part in the history of Russian religious and cultural life. Criticizing the hypermoralism of classical Russian literature Makanin outlines a new image of the writer which is opposed to the Russian literary myth but still propagates moral and religious values. Pelevin's novels which reflect the relativism of postmodern poetics focus on another issue â the blurring of the difference between reality and illusion. In âGeneration âPââ, mass media and advertising produce deceitful simulacra of reality and in âChapaev and Emptinessâ the deconstruction of Soviet mythology assumes the shape of a nightmare. Unsurprisingly, among the imagery of emptiness Malevich's famous âBlack Squareâ including its numerous equivalents as black holes or all sorts of empty spaces is rather frequent in the three novels. Emptiness may be considered to be a characteristic trait of the atmosphere of the 1990s when Russians felt to live in a cultural vacuum somewhere between state economy and unbridled capitalism, between Soviet order and âpost-slaveâ (Makanin chaos.\n\nDie Kindfrau Lolita im Wandel der Zeit : vergleichende Betrachtung des Romans von Vladimir Nabokov mit den Verfilmungen von Stanley Kubrick und Adrian Lyne\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFries, Stefanie\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIm Zentrum des folgenden Artikels stehen der Themenkomplex der Kindfrau sowie der damit verbundene Mythos.

Nabokov is not a unique case, but his situation and reactions are quite representative of the difficulties raised when changing oneâs language of composition.\n\nLâÃ©crivain dÃ©placÃ© dans Lolita et Pnin de Vladimir Nabokov Displaced Writers in Nabokovâs Fiction: Lolita and Pnin\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYannicke Chupin\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article focuses on the figure of displaced writers in Vladimir Nabokovâs fiction, and more specifically in Lolita and Pnin. Living the life of exiles affected by permanent instability,Â the two heroes, Humbert and Pnin, find personal outlets in the writing process. The eccentric language used by both characters displays a form of inventiveness which derives from linguistic disjunction. This article aims at showing in which ways displacement is what sustains the linguistic creativity of these two intellectual exiles.\n\nNorman Faircloughâs Textually Oriented Discourse Analysis in Vladimir Nabokovâs Lolita\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPegah Sheibeh\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The present study is an attempt to use âtextually oriented discourse analysisâ of Norman Fairclough, (1941, to offer a new reading of Vladimir Nabokovâs Lolita (1955. The researcher found it quite appropriate to read the chosen work through Faircloughâs stylistic and discursive features in order to represent the identities of the main characters. Nabokovâs works represent an important portrayal of discursive challenges in the post-war American society that is largely invested in Faircloughâs theory. One of the most apparent aspects in Nabokovâs works is that of social identity and subject formation. As discourse theory denotes, a subject 'misrepresents' the world in ideology because he wants to do so, because there is some reward or benefit to him in doing so. Similarly Humbert Humbert in Lolita is looking for an imaginary world by which he can hide his suppressed identity. He fakes a new identity for himself through fiction. Considering the style of narration in Lolita, some reader consider Humbert as an unreliable narrator, he sometimes makes up some events and in some parts of the story he seems insane and uncertain. In Lolita Nabokov tries to show that each individual creates his/her reality and do not reflect reality. Humbert narrates his personal story from his point of view which might be different from people around him. Reality in Nabokovâs perspective is subjective and mixture of memory and imagination.\n\nThe Challenge of Translating Childrenâs Literature: Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland Translated by Vladimir Nabokov\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNatalija Vid\n\n2008-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In the article the author focuses on Vladimir Nabokovâs translation of Lewis Carrollâs novel Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland, made in 1923. The main intention of the article is to analyze Nabokovâs translation strategies of domestication, realized in the text as substitution and localization, and to explain possible reasons for his decision in favour of almost complete Russification of the original. It is possible that Nabokov considered childrenâs attitude towards the final result as the most important part of the translation process. Thus, he used domesticated strategies to transfer for Russian children the humour, the originality and brightness of the paradoxical and attractive world of Lewis Carroll, his sense of the absurd and his amazing gift for games of logic and language, providing a recognizable and familiar atmosphere for the readers. Undoubtedly, his young Russian readers were able to identify themselves with the story and to comprehend the complex world created by Lewis Carroll. On the other hand, Nabokov refuses to oversimplify his translation or to patronize its young audience through simplistic translation solutions.\n\nDesiderio e scrittura in \"The Real Life of Sebastian Knight\" di Vladimir Nabokov\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nValeria Invernizzi\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis paper examines, from a psychoanalytic standpoint, the intersection between identity and writing in the novel The Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941 by Vladimir Nabokov. In particular, in the wake of Freud and Lacan, the following contribution will take the notions of desire, signifier, and the process of sublimation involved in artistic creation as interpretative devices. The main focus of the analysis will be the relationship between the two half-brothers of the novel, V (the narrator and Sebastian. First, I will show that Sebastian Knight holds the role of the object of desire for the characters who have established a close relationship with him and, in particular, for V. Secondly, the paper will be devoted to the analysis of the trauma experienced by the characters because of Sebastian's death, with a particular focus on the narrator's mourning through writing (the fictional biography we read in the novel; in the end, I will give evidence of the so-called signifierâs fallacy, crucial episodes in which the narrator can experience an insight into the truth of desire. Because of the not negligible question of the fictional paternity of The Real Life and the equally essential matter of Vâs âstylistic touchâ, metaliterary aspects of the novel will also be part of the following reading of the text.\n\nLoving More, Being Less: Reflections on Vladimir JankÃ©lÃ©vitchâs Le paradoxe de la morale\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJennifer Rosato\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In Le paradoxe de la morale, Vladimir JankÃ©lÃ©vitch proposes that the moral life is a matter of balancing the demands of love, which call us to give without limit, and our natural, egoistical attachment to self, which he terms 'being'. This balancing act is ultimately paradoxical since love must both depend on and overcome being. The vision of moral life as a paradoxical balancing act of love and being, however, is implicitly challenged by another, \"supernatural\" vision of ethics that JankÃ©lÃ©vitch proposes near the end of the text. In these passages, the egoism of being that marks human nature is not merely balanced but genuinely transformed by the passionate care for an other.

A. Meleschuk\n\n2016-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The meaning of the concept of societyâs organic unity has been investigated. This concept was an important part of Russian religious philosophy in the middle of the XIX century. It has been found that Schelling and Hegel idealistic philosophy and orthodox theology were the main sources of the concept of organic unity. The character and forms of the presentation of the organic unityâs concept in Vladimir Soloviev and the main representatives of early Slavophilismâs social philosophy and philosophy of history has been analyzed. By Solovyov, the subject of the historical development is mankind as holistic, organic phenomenon which tries to overcome the formal unity and to reach its spiritual level in the form of Â«God-manhoodÂ». Economic and legal unity is called the lowest form of unity by Solovyov, and the highest one, which reaches the organic and conscious level, is the spiritual unity. In the philosophy of Ivan Kireyevski, societyâs organic unity is opposed to the formal, rational unity. The formal unity was inherited by Europe from ancient Rome. Cultural traditions of Greece and Orthodoxy were inherited by Slavs and saved the spiritual unity of society. According to Alexey Khomyakov, there are two contrasting models of culture: Iranian and Cushitic ones. Iranian model is based on freedom and conscious action. Iranian model creates a spiritual unity without suppression of individuals in society. Cushitic model creates a formal unity, it coercions and suppress individuals. The formality of the state association and the spiritual unity of the community have been opposed by Konstantin Aksakov. In tsarist Russia, all power was given to the monarch to protect the community. Therefore, Russia maintained an organic, internal unity of the people unlike Europe. In Europe, the state became stronger then the communities and state there suppressed communities. Rights and economy became to be more important than morality.

The first-appointed professor of organic chemistry was Ivan Marek, formerly the professor at the School of Trade in Zagreb. The High Technical School with all its departments was soon (1926/27 incorporated into the University of Zagreb and became the nucleus of the Technical Faculty. The management of the faculty was fully aware of the necessity to engage the best scientists in the field as faculty professors. As far as organic chemistry was concerned, there was no better choice in the mid 1930's, than to invite young but already recognized organic chemist Dr. Vladimir Prelog to join the staff and to succeed professor Marek, who retired in 1935. Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept the invitation and was eager to continue his scientific work in an academic laboratory in Zagreb. At the time of the invitation, Dr. Prelog was engaged in a small laboratory synthesizing special samples of rare chemicals to be sold through the chemical store \"DÅiza\" in Prague. There he was provided the modest opportunity to carry on his own research, and together with Rudolf LukeÅ¡ and Emil VotoÄek, published a number of papers concerning organic synthesis and chemistry of natural products. Elected in Zagreb for the lectureship of the assistant professor in organic chemistry, Prelog started teaching as early as in the summer semester of 1934/35. The ingenious and bright lecturing of young professor Prelog inspired his students, and many of them were attracted to organic chemistry. On the other hand, the working conditions in the disposable laboratory of the Organic Chemistry Department were too modest to accept a number of students. The budget was so small that it only covered tuition, while there was no research fund at the faculty. Luckily, Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept an offer for scientific co\n\nFOOD PROBLEM AND STRATEGIES FOR ITS SOLUTION IN VLADIMIR REGION DURING THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÐ Ð¡ Ð¢ÑÑÑ Ð¾Ð²\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In the hierarchy of human needs, food takes ï¬ rst place. Therefore the relevance of this topic during the intransient shocks. The article discusses the complexity of the food problem during the Great Patriotic War (on materials of the Vladimir region. The author examines the strategies for solving the food problem, the inhabitants of which were used in the edge of the war years. The material for the study is based on documentary sources of local supplies and memoirs of contemporaries. The author has reviled that supply of urban population with food conducted by cards, and all the inhabitants were divided into categories with different supplies. The card system is not fully secure the large mass of the population needs in food, but because they had to look for different ways of obtaining additional products. Special attention is paid to the creation of individual farms residents and farms businesses that became essential for survival of the people of that time. The study of the problem historian draws attention to other ways to ensure yourself of food the population of the region. These include assistance for the inhabitants of the cities from rural relatives, exchange things for food and work in the collective farms, that is a tempo-rary move from the city to the countryside. It was a process of reverse trend to mobilize the So-viet authorities on youth enterprise in the city. Permanent deterioration of the food situation in the war years becoming a signiï¬ cant part of the population on the brink of survival. The author has come to the conclusion that the countryâs leadership could only provide a minimum level of survival for people with any serious deterioration of the situation at the front could lead to the most dramatic consequences in the rear.\n\nState Civilisation: The Statist Core of Vladimir Putinâs Civilisational Discourse and Its Implications for Russian Foreign Policy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLinde Fabian\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The essay examines Vladimir Putinâs civilisational discourse, which arose in earnest with the publication of his presidential campaign articles in 2012. It argues that what makes Putinâs rendering of Russiaâs civilisational identity distinctive is its strongly emphasized Statism, understood as a belief in the primacy of the state. This suggests that while his endorsement of a distinct civilisational identity represents an important conceptual turn as regards how national identity is articulated, there are also significant lines of continuity with previous presidential periods, given that state primacy has been at the heart of Putinâs political agenda since the very beginning of his presidential career. This detail also reveals a great deal about the political rationale behind Putinâs commitment to a Russian civilisational identity. It provides the government with a theoretical justification of an illiberal political course. There are important implications for foreign policy-making as well. In relation to the West, there is an attempt to limit its normative reach by depicting liberal values as less than universal. In regional affairs, Russia is attempting to legitimate its involvement in the near abroad on civilisational grounds. The loose definition of âco-patriotsâ as foreign nationals experiencing some affinity with Russia gives it plenty of leeway in this regard. Lastly, Russia has petitioned for Ukraineâs neutrality based on the argument that the country is straddling a civilisational fault line.\n\nNesseri kuri maailm / Peeter KÃ¼nstler\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKÃ¼nstler, Peeter, 1958-2009\n\n1996-01-01\n\nArvustus: Nesser, HÃµkan.

As a reaction and antithesis to this term, dystopia is defined as \"an imaginary place where people lead dehumanized and often fearful lives\" in Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Hence, Invitation to a Beheading authored by Nabokov recounts a protagonist named Cincinnatus C. sentenced to death for 'the farcical crime' (Morgan 2003: 281 of 'gnostic turpitude' which has a sarcastic and awaits for his punishment in an eccentric cell. On waiting, Cincinnatus not knowing his executioner and when the execution will be held is introduced by the manager trying to be a friend of the protagonist. In this context, when studied from the dystopian point of view, the novel has a great numbers of dystopian characteristics. In this study, the term of dystopia and the characteristics of this term in Invitation to a Beheading will be argued.\n\nDale Herspring, The Kremlin and the High Command.

Using RAPD markers identified with the help of six random primers (P-29, OPA-10, OPT-14, OPA-11, OPB-11, and OPH-20), it was possible to distinguish Karelian population from the group consisting of the populations from two adjacent regions (Moscow oblast and Vladimir oblast). Based on the combined matrix, containing 294 RAPD fragments, dendrogram of genetic differences was constructed, and the indices of genetic divergence and partition (P, H, and G(st)), as well as the gene flow indices N(m) between the nematode samples examined, were calculated. The dendrogram structure, genetic diversity indices, and variations of genetic distances between single individuals in each population from Karelia and Central Russia pointed to genetic isolation and higher genetic diversity of the nematodes from Karelia. Based on polymorphism of rDNA first intergenic spacer ITS1, attribution of all populations examined to the species G. rostochiensis was proved. Small variations of the ITS1 sequence in different geographic populations of nematodes from different regions of the species world range did not allow isolation of separate groups within the species. Possible factors (including interregional transportations of seed potato) affecting nematode population structure in Russia are discussed.\n\nThe Tower as a Metaphor and Concept\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPihl, Ole Verner\n\n2007-01-01\n\nÂ Abstract: The tower as an architectonic object is not only about scale, it is also about concept.
