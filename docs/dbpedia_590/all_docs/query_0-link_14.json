        "text": "One of the basic failures of West on the Balkans is the expectation that the formation of cultural identities is following the same path as it was in the West. There are two notions defining the term “identity”: Absolute sameness, and distinctiveness. Cultural identities are formed by the existence of cultural similarities on the one side, and existence of cultural differences on the other. The problematic issue in that sense is the question on how the “differences” are formed and cultural differentiation is shaped. The aim of this paper is to examine the formation of identity in the Balkans from a theoretical point of view, discussing the issues of concepts “other” and “cultural half”. The concept of the “other” may lead the transformation of the “other” into the “enemy other” which is very often after the establishment of i.e. nation states. Although the notion of “cultural half” stresses the differences between cultural identities, on the other side it implies the sense that the identities are “half”s for each other and can live together, and even this may be recognized as a natural process. Looking beyond a historical perspective, it can be argued that the practice of living together with other cultures in West is not so rich. During the Colonization era, the image of the “other” was constructed as barbaric, uncivilized, or savage. During the era of the construction of modern nation-states by transforming cultural identities into political identities, the cultural differences were constructed as “other” and this construction was clearly defined by drawing borders. Especially, in a region like the Balkans, where different cultures used to live side by side, the same process was implemented which resulted in bloody conflicts. The term “Balkanization” was regarded as a negative term to imply the negative aggressive, barbaric, uncivilized character of tribal cultural groups in the Balkans. However, this pejorative term disregards the effect of outer interventions as one of the reasons behind the conflicts occurred by inner dynamics. In that sense, a Eurocentric effort of construction of the “other” is usually ignored The bloody conflicts which occurred in the Middle East, Caucasus and the Balkans at the end of 20th century was examined within this perspective by defining those cultures as aggressive, backward, etc. instead of examining those conflicts by looking at the social, economical and political structure of those regions. The “peaceful” solution to those conflicts in the West has been to define and draw clearly determined borders, ignoring the experience of those ethnic/cultural groups of living together with high intercultural relation."
