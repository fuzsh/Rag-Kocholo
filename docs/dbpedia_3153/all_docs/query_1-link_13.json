        "text": "On 31 July 2003, exactly 17 years ago, the pay satellite TV revolution took place in our country: from the merger of Stream and Tele+ was born Sky Italy.\n\nAt the beginning, there were two shareholders: the Australian tycoon Rupert Murdoch, founder and dominus of the colossus News Corporation, which controlled 80,1% of the share capital, and Telecom Italia, which held the remaining 19,9% ​​in its portfolio. In 2006, the telecom group sold its entire stake to NewsCorp, which then became the sole shareholder of Sky, controlled through 21st Century Fox. After that, in 2018, Sky changed hands again, with Murdoch deciding to sell the entire capital to Comcast, the largest cable operator in the United States.\n\nSky's first successes lie between the golden age of analogue and the advent of online streaming, a sector in which Sky itself is making its way through the Sky Go and NowTv platforms, as well as with the recent launch of Sky Wifi, which marks the company's debut on the telephone market.\n\nBut before the web took over, television innovation was almost exclusively the prerogative of pay-TV. It was Sky, in 2005, that launched the first high-definition channels in Italy (HD): a technology that we now take for granted – in the meantime, it was superseded first by ultra-HD, then by 4K – but which at the time marked the clearest and most surprising change in the way we watch television.\n\nFrom a corporate point of view, the most important turning point was the one announced on March 30, 2018, i.e the agreement between Sky and the digital terrestrial pay-TV Mediaset Premium. Based on the agreement, the 5 cinema channels and 4 TV series available until then only on Mediaset Premium would also be visible on Sky, which in turn would grant the Alfa Romeo part of its sports offer.\n\nTo date, Sky – which offers about 180 thematic channels divided into packages, plus another 28 pay-per-view cinema, entertainment and sport channels – no longer has any rivals on the satellite TV market, but must beware of much fiercer competition from streaming giants: Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Apple Tv+ and, above all, his majesty Netflix."
