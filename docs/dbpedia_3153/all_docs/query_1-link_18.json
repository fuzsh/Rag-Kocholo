        "text": "Window of opportunity\n\nAs the World Cup gets underway, a Sky Italia drama focuses on a murkier side of the beautiful game in a story about football agents during one high-stakes summer transfer window. DQ speaks to the cast and creative team behind Il Grande Gioco (The Great Game).\n\nDevils is in the details\n\nAs Sky drama Devils returns for a second season, writer and executive producer Frank Spotnitz outlines the challenges in bringing the financial drama to the screen, including a pivotal scene set on the night of the UK’s Brexit referendum.\n\nKing maker\n\nItalian star Luca Zingaretti plays tough prison boss Bruno Testori in Sky Italia drama Il Re (The King). Director Giuseppe Gagliardi talks about filming the series inside real prisons and why he won’t judge his morally ambiguous protagonist.\n\nMiracle worker\n\nShowrunner Stefano Lodovichi and actors Edoardo Pesce and Silvia D’Amico speak to DQ about working together on Italian mystical thriller Christian, which centres on a gangster who gains mysterious powers.\n\nGoodbye Gomorrah\n\nAhead of the final season of Italian crime drama Gomorrah, DQ speaks to star Salvatore Esposito about landing his leading role and why he hasn’t been surprised by the show’s global success.\n\nLiving in Anna’s world\n\nStar Giulia Dragotto and writer and director Niccolò Ammaniti tell DQ about making Italian dystopian drama Anna, in which the title character survives in a world where people only live until the age of 14.\n\nWho’s who\n\nAcclaimed film director Luca Guadagnino discusses his first TV series, We Are Who We Are, a coming-of-age story about two American teenagers living on a US military base in Northern Italy.\n\nRisky Devils\n\nPatrick Dempsey and Alessandro Borghi open up about making stylish financial thriller Devils, about an ambitious banker whose rise to the top is put on ice when he is suspected of murder.\n\nKeeping it in the family\n\nHard-hitting Italian crime drama Gomorrah has been hailed as one of the best TV shows of the decade. Michael Pickard speaks to the series’ writer and co-creator Stefano Bises.\n\nKeeping busy in the off-season\n\nWhile the end of July tends to be a bit slow when it comes to new series orders, it seems plenty of firms didn’t read the script this year, with HBO, CBS and Syfy all giving drama fans cause for excitement with announcements over the past week."
