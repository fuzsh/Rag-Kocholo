        "text": "The battle to secure Serie A’s broadcasting rights from 2021 to 2024 has come down to two fierce contenders, Sky Italia and DAZN.\n\nThe assembly of Lega Serie A, the governing body of Italy’s top flight of soccer, meets today at 9:30 a.m. EST to approve or reject the offers presented by Sky Italia and DAZN.\n\nTo officially assign broadcasting rights for the next three Serie A seasons, the Lega Serie A assembly requires a minimum of 14 favorable votes from its 20 board members.\n\nSky Italia is a satellite television platform that is part of Sky Group Limited, the London-based media company serving as a subsidiary to American telecommunications conglomerate Comcast Corp CMCSA CMCSA .\n\nVideo streaming service DAZN is owned by British sports media company DAZN Group, which is in turn part of Access Industries, Inc., a large investment firm based in New York City. The founder of Access Industries, Leonard Blavatnik, is one of the wealthiest men in the world with a net worth of $31.5 billion.\n\nSky and DAZN have been the Serie A broadcasting rights holders for the three-year period from 2018 to 2021, with their term expiring at the end of the ongoing 2020/21 Serie A season.\n\nOf the combined €973 million that Sky and DAZN provide annually to Lega Serie A, Sky disburses €780 million to have its platform broadcast seven out of the 10 matches that are scheduled for each of the league’s 38 rounds.\n\nDAZN, in turn, allocates €193 million/year to Lega Serie A to stream the remaining three games every matchday.\n\nTo become the main provider of Italian soccer content during the next three years, DAZN has prepared a €840 million/year offer to Lega Serie A, according to Italy’s daily Repubblica.\n\nWith that bid, DAZN aims to host 70% of the Serie A games (seven out of 10 games scheduled for each Serie A matchday) exclusively on their streaming platform.\n\nSky’s offer to host 70% of the Serie A games is currently €90 million short of the one presented by DAZN, hitting €750 million precisely.\n\nRepubblica reports that Sky is also willing to allocate €70 million to contribute to the creation of an over-the-top media service that would host the remaining 30% of the Serie A matches and would be operated alongside Lega Serie A.\n\nThe total of Sky’s bids adds up to €820 million.\n\nWhile not reaching the ambitious €1.15 billion target it had set for bidders, Lega Serie A should collect the same proceeds in the 2021-24 period as it did from 2018-21.\n\nA combination of DAZN’s offer to stream 70% of the Serie A games (€840 million) and Sky’s contribution to setting up the OTT media service for the remaining 30% of the fixtures (€70 million) would bring Lega Serie A a total of €910 million.\n\nThe new amount is not far from the €973 million collected during 2018-21 considering that, as Repubblica specifies, this year Lega Serie A is saving €55 million from the advisor fee it used to pay to Swiss sports marketing company Infront Sports & Media.\n\nThere are other factors besides money that the Lega Serie A decision makers will have to take into account during today’s meeting, as Corriere della Sera points out.\n\nLega Serie A needs to think about the ways Serie A fans are used to consuming soccer content and whether it would be beneficial to bring most of Serie A fixtures to a streaming platform like DAZN.\n\nThey also need to consider whether moving away from Sky as the main provider of Italian soccer would guarantee the same level of Serie A experience to viewers, who have been engaging with Sky’s soccer shows for the past 18 years.\n\nWe should know more about the outcome of the negotiations between Lega Serie A and Sky and DAZN in the afternoon."
