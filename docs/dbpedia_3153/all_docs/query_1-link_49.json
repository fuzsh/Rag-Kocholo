        "text": "British pay TV companyTemplate:SHORTDESC:British pay TV company\n\nFor a wider corporate history and profile, see Sky (company).\n\nSky UK (formerly British Sky Broadcasting Limited, BSkyB and Sky) is a British telecommunications company which serves the United Kingdom owned by Comcast. Sky provides television and broadband Internet services, fixed line and mobile telephone services to consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom. It is the UK's largest pay-TV broadcaster with 12.5 million customers as of 2018. It was the UK's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by Freeview in April 2007. Its corporate headquarters are in Isleworth.\n\nFormed in March 1994 four years after the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting, Sky became the UK's largest digital subscription television company. Following Sky's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04% interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014, its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc. The UK subsidiary's name was changed from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited, and continues to trade as Sky as of November 2018.\n\nSky UK Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast-owned Sky, with its current company directors being Andrew Griffith and Christopher Taylor. Andrew Griffith has acted as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Managing Director for the commercial businesses division, however, it was announced in June 2019 that Kevin O’Toole of Comcast Business will take on the role of Managing Director of Sky Business Communications, reporting to Chris Stylianou.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Sky TV\n\nOrigins[edit]\n\nThe present service can trace its heritage back to 1989, when BSkyB's predecessors Sky Television plc and British Satellite Broadcasting encrypted their respective film channels – Sky Movies and The Movie Channel which required viewers to get decoding equipment and a subscription to watch the channels. After the two companies merged, subscribers could get access to both channels, and later the sports channel Sky Sports also became encrypted.\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky Sports\n\nIn the autumn of 1991, talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period, from the 1992 season. ITV were the current rights holders, and fought hard to retain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season. Murdoch described sport as a \"battering ram\" for pay-television, providing a strong customer base. A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal. A few days later neither action took effect, ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid, and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid.\n\nBSkyB retained the rights paying £670m 1997–2001 deal, but was challenged by On Digital for the rights from 2001–2004, thus were forced to £1.1 billion which gave them 66 live games a year.\n\nFollowing a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season. In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters. Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn. In February 2015, Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016. This represented an increase of 70% on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay. The move has been followed by staff cuts, increased subscription prices (including 9% in Sky's family package) and the dropping of the 3D channel.\n\nSky Multichannels[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky Multichannels\n\nIn September 1993, BSkyB launched Sky Multichannels which was the present digital platform's analogue predecessor. Sky Multichannels was a subscription package that gave access not only to Sky's own channels but also those of third party broadcasters.\n\nThe service started on 1 September 1993. It was based on an idea by then CEO Sam Chisholm and chairman Rupert Murdoch of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the expansion of the Sky Digital platform after its launch three years before. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994. Michael Grade criticised the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels.\n\nLaunch of Sky Digital[edit]\n\nBSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open.... now called Sky Active, BSkyB competed with the ONdigital (later ITV Digital) terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which help bolstered BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.\n\nIn addition to most channels from the Sky Multichannels package, Sky Digital launched with several new channels that were exclusive to the digital offer.\n\nThe switch-over from analogue to digital proceeded relatively quickly. In 1998, there were 6 million 'multichannel' TV homes in the UK (i.e. homes that watch television other than the traditional analogue terrestrial), and over half of these homes watched television using BSkyB's analogue service. BSkyB's digital service surpassed the analogue service in terms of subscribers in late 1999.\n\nBy June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave BSkyB 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected BSkyB's 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% from 1999).\n\nBSkyB's analogue service ended in October 2001, and the digital service would eventually be marketed as just 'Sky'.\n\nBy June 2005, the number of digital subscribers increase to 7.8m, while it produced 38,375 hours of sport in 2005\n\n2010s[edit]\n\nSky's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010, Europe's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone. Confirming it had reached its target, the broadcaster said its reach into 36% of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people. The target was first announced in August 2004, since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to Sky's direct-to-home service. Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government's benefits agency was checking claimants' \"Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone\" – as, it claimed, subscription to sports channels would betray a man's presence in the household. In December, the UK's parliament heard a claim that a subscription to Sky was ‘often damaging’, along with alcohol, tobacco and gambling. Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a \"Welfare Cash Card\", in the style of the American Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, that could be used to buy only \"essentials\".\n\nOn 1 March 2018, it was reported that Sky UK had concluded successful negotiations with Netflix to offer Sky subscribers with access to the international streaming service.\n\nComcast, the largest cable TV provider in the United States, outbid 21st Century Fox, on 22 September 2018 in an auction for control of Sky UK. On 4 October 2018, Fox sold their stake to Comcast, giving the latter a 76.8% controlling stake. On 12 October 2018, Comcast announced it will compulsorily acquire the rest of Sky after its bid gained acceptance from 95.3% of the broadcaster's shareholders. Afterwards, Comcast acquired the remaining 5% of the shares of Sky.\n\nServices[edit]\n\nDigital terrestrial television[edit]\n\nSky initially faced competition from the ONdigital digital terrestrial television service (later renamed ITV Digital). ITV Digital failed for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to numerous administrative and technical failures, nervous investors after a large down-turn in the advertising market and the dot com crash, and Sky's aggressive marketing and domination of premium sporting rights.\n\nWhile Sky had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, Sky was able to join ITV Digital's free-to-air replacement, Freeview, in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Arqiva. Prior to October 2005, three Sky channels were available on this platform: Sky News, Sky Three, and Sky Sports News. Initially, Sky provided Sky Travel to the service. However, this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005, which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV' in 2011.\n\nOn 8 February 2007, Sky announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels. It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the Sky portfolio including sport (including English Premier League Football), films, entertainment and news. The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform, and on the same day that NTL's services re-branded as Virgin Media. However, industry sources believe Sky will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels, due to possible lost advertising revenue.\n\nVideo on demand[edit]\n\nMain article: On Demand (Sky)\n\nSky initially faced increased competition from telecommunications providers to deliver pay television services over existing telephone lines using ADSL. Such providers are able to offer \"triple-play\" or \"quad-play\" packages combining landline telephone, broadband Internet, mobile telephone and pay television services.\n\nTo compete with these providers, in October 2005, Sky bought the broadband Internet service provider Easynet for £211 million. This acquisition allowed Sky to start offering a Sky-branded broadband service as well as a \"triple play\" package combining satellite television, land-line telephone and Broadband service. Sky also offers some streaming live TV channels to a computer using Microsoft's Silverlight.\n\nIn early 2012, Sky released an update to its Sky Anytime service. This update offers customers the chance to buy and rent films from the Sky Store.\n\nOn 26 September 2012, Sky relaunched its \"Anytime+\" on-demand-via-broadband service as \"On Demand\" as the BBC’s iPlayer joined the line-up of channels offering catch-up TV on the company's Sky+ HD box – linked to a router, the signal from which was recorded before viewing. The BBC was making the preceding week's programmes available alongside ITV, Channel 4’s All 4, Channel 5 and the partly BBC Worldwide-owned UKTV, as well as Sky's own channels.\n\nSky Go[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky Go\n\nOn 29 May 2009, it was confirmed that Sky Go would be made available on the Xbox 360. In November 2011 Sony Computer Entertainment struck a deal with Sky to bring some of its shows to the PlayStation Store Video Store. Users are able buy individual TV episodes in SD or HD. On 3 December 2014, Sky Go became available on the PlayStation 4, followed by the PlayStation 3 on 29 January 2015.\n\nSky Broadband[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky Broadband\n\nOn 1 March 2013, it was announced that Sky would buy O2's and Be's broadband services from Telefónica for £180 million up front plus another £20 million once customers have been transferred. Telefónica said the deal would allow it to concentrate on providing better mobile services, including rolling out 4G.\n\nSky offers superfast broadband, Sky Fibre, using ADSL2+ technology and fibre-optic, which are provided by BT Openreach.\n\nSky Mobile[edit]\n\nOn 21 October 2016, it was announced that public pre-registration for Sky's new mobile network, Sky Mobile, would take place from 31 October 2016. The network will operate as a Full MVNO, utilising the O2 radio access network infrastructure, and O2’s full network speeds and 4G+. On 5 January 2017 Sky Mobile went live to the public across the UK. Coining itself as the Smarter Network, with tariffs mainly focused on data rather than traditional calls & text, effectively saving consumers money in wasted unused minutes and texts. 1GB data costs £10.00 per month while 5GB costs £15.00 per month with 10GB data costing £20.00 per month. With all those data tariffs, the customer can choose from two different call & text packages with the 'Pay as you use' costing 10p per minute of calls and 10p per text message sent or £10.00 per month for Unlimited Calls & Texts. The Unlimited Calls & Texts package is free for new or existing Sky TV customers using the Sky Mobile network.\n\nAs of 30 March 2017, Sky Mobile is offering handset deals. Products are available from manufacturers such as Samsung, Sony, LG and Apple.\n\nProducts[edit]\n\nSky Digibox[edit]\n\nMain article: Digibox\n\nSky launched with a set top box known as the Sky Digibox, using the Slogans \"What do you want to watch?\", \"Entertainment your way\" and the current slogan \"Believe in Better\". This was followed by Sky+, a digital video recorder with an internal hard drive which allows viewers to 'pause live television' (by switching from a live feed to a paused real-time recording that can be restarted at any point) and schedule programs to record in the future.\n\nIn later years the Sky+ box and then the Sky+ HD box replaced the original Digibox. The first photos of a prototype Sky HD box began appearing in magazines in August 2005. Sky launched HDTV services in May 2006. All Sky+ HD boxes incorporate a version of Sky+ using a 300GB, 500GB, or 1TB hard drive (of which 160GB, 250GB or 500GB are available to the user) to accommodate the necessary extra data.\n\nSky+[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky+\n\nSky initially charged an additional subscription fee for using a Sky+ PVR with their service; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels. This changed as from 1 July 2007, and now customers that subscribe to any Sky package have Sky+ included at no extra charge. Customers that do not subscribe to Sky's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women. As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.\n\nIn January 2010 Sky discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+ HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 Sky discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality. In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women. As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.\n\nSky+ HD[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky+ HD\n\nSky launched its HDTV service, Sky+ HD, on 22 May 2006. Prior to its launch, Sky claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service. In the week before the launch, rumours started to surface that Sky was having supply issues with its set top box (STB) from manufacturer Thomson. On Thursday 18 May 2006, and continuing through the weekend before launch, people were reporting that Sky had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation. Finally, the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries. On 31 March 2012, Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+ HD was 4,222,000.\n\nIn early 2012, Sky released an update to its Sky Anytime service. This update offers customers the chance to buy and rent films from the Sky Store. In June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG for Sky+ HD boxes. The update included a new modernised look and improved functionality. As of 1 October 2012, Sky Anytime was rebranded as Sky On Demand which included ITV Player and Demand 5. BBC iPlayer followed in late Autumn with 4oD which changed to All 4 on 30 March 2015, launched in early 2013.\n\nSky 3D[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky 3D\n\nSky began to broadcast programmes in 3D in April 2010. This included new 3D channels, including a Sky Sports 3D and Sky Movies 3D. Sky previously experimented with 3D broadcasting by broadcasting an Arsenal vs Manchester United football game live in 3D in nine pubs situated throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nSky Q[edit]\n\nMain article: Sky Q\n\nOn 18 November 2015, Sky announced Sky Q, a range of products and services to be available in 2016. The Sky Q range consists of three set top boxes (Sky Q 1TB, Sky Q 2TB and Sky Q Mini), a broadband router (Sky Q Hub) and mobile applications.\n\nThe Sky Q set top boxes introduce a new user interface, Wi-Fi hotspot functionality, Power-line and Bluetooth connectivity and a new touch-sensitive remote control. The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to the Sky Q set top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds. This allows all set top boxes in a household to share recordings and other media.\n\nSky Q became available to order on 9 February 2016 and is currently the only range available to new customers. The Sky+ HD box was removed from sale on Sky's main website in October 2016. Sky Q has received highly positive reception.\n\n4K UHD[edit]\n\nThe Sky Q 2TB set top box is capable of receiving and displaying 4K UHD broadcasts. HDR will be added at a later date when HDR broadcast standards are agreed. UHD broadcasts started on 13 August 2016, with the first live Premier League football match of the 2016/17 season, Hull vs Leicester City. UHD broadcasts are available free of charge to Sky Q 2TB multiscreen customers with any other relevant subscriptions.\n\nTelevision channels[edit]\n\nEntertainment\n\nSky Showcase (+1 available)\n\nSky Max\n\nSky Atlantic (+1 available)\n\nSky Comedy\n\nSky Witness (+1 available)\n\nSky Replay\n\nSyfy\n\nComedy Central (+1 available) (joint venture with Paramount Global)\n\nComedy Central Extra (joint venture)\n\nPick (+1 available)\n\nChallenge\n\nLifestyle\n\nBlaze (part-time +1 available) [1] (joint venture - A+E Networks UK)\n\nFactual\n\nSky Arts\n\nSky Crime (+1 available)\n\nSky Documentaries\n\nSky History (+1 available) (joint venture - A+E Networks UK)\n\nSky History 2 (joint venture - A+E Networks UK)\n\nSky Nature\n\nCrime+Investigation (+1 available) (joint venture - A+E Networks UK)[1]\n\nNews\n\nSky News\n\nSky News Arabia (joint venture)\n\nSports\n\nSky Sports Main Event\n\nSky Sports Premier League\n\nSky Sports Football\n\nSky Sports Cricket\n\nSky Sports Golf\n\nSky Sports F1\n\nSky Sports Action\n\nSky Sports Arena\n\nSky Sports Mix\n\nSky Sports News\n\nSky Sports NFL\n\nSky Sports Racing\n\nMovies (Films)\n\nSky Cinema Premiere\n\nSky Cinema Select\n\nSky Cinema Hits\n\nSky Cinema Greats\n\nSky Cinema Animation\n\nSky Cinema Family\n\nSky Cinema Action\n\nSky Cinema Comedy\n\nSky Cinema Thriller\n\nSky Cinema Drama\n\nSky Cinema Sci-Fi & Horror\n\nKids\n\nNickelodeon (+1 available) (joint venture with Paramount Global)\n\nNick Jr. (+1 available) (joint venture with Paramount Global)\n\nNick Jr. Too (joint venture with Paramount Global)\n\nNicktoons (joint venture with Paramount Global)\n\nBabyTV (joint venture)\n\nOther - A+E Networks UK\n\nA+E Networks UK a joint-venture between Sky UK with American company A+E Networks and includes the noted channels above and the following Freeview channel:\n\nTCC (licence held under the name TCC Broadcasting Ltd)\n\nMarketing[edit]\n\nSky (formerly marketed as Sky Digital) is the brand name for Sky plc's United Kingdom digital satellite television and telecommunications services. Slogans that have been used for marketing include \"What do you want to watch?\", \"Entertainment your way\" and the current slogan \"Believe in Better\". Sky has also aired several advertisements featuring characters from Minions, Inside Out, Kung Fu Panda 3, The Secret Life of Pets, The Lego Batman Movie, Despicable Me 3 and Monster Family.\n\nBroadcasting[edit]\n\nCompetition[edit]\n\nOn 12 July 2011, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown claimed that Sky's largest shareholder – News Corporation – attempted to affect government policy with regards to the BBC in pursuit of its own commercial interests. He went further, in a speech in Parliament on 13 July 2011, stating:\n\n\"Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit not standards was what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and Sky agenda under his and Mrs Brooks’ leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from Sky and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom. I rejected those policies.\"\n\nOn 13 July 2011, MP Chris Bryant stated to the House of Commons, in the Parliamentary Debate on the Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for Sky that the company was anti-competitive:\n\n\"The company has lots of technological innovation that only a robust entrepreneur could to bring to British society, but it has also often been profoundly anti-competitive. I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase the profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface—the operating system—has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom.\"\n\nVirgin Media dispute[edit]\n\nDiscovery Networks dispute[edit]\n\nLitigation[edit]\n\nIn July 2013, the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft’s use of the term \"SkyDrive\" infringed on Sky’s right to the \"Sky\" trademark. On 31 July 2013, Sky and Microsoft announced their settlement, in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling, and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified \"reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand,\" plus \"financial and other terms, the details of which are confidential\". On 27 January 2014, Microsoft announced \"that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive\" and \"SkyDrive Pro\" becomes \"OneDrive for Business\".\n\nHello Games was in legal negotiations with Sky over the trademark on the word \"Sky\" used for the title of their video game No Man's Sky for three years. The issue was ultimately settled in June 2016, allowing Hello Games to continue to use the name.\n\nCriticism and controversies[edit]\n\nMain article: Criticisms of Sky UK\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\nYear Association Category Nominee(s) Result 2017 Diversity in Media Awards Broadcaster of the Year Sky Template:Aye\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n[edit]"
