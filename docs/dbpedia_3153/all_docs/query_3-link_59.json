        "text": "Astronomers have discovered a stone disc they believe might be one of the oldest maps of the night sky.\n\nIt was found in Italy and is believed to be around 3,000 years old.\n\nResearchers from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) used software to analyse 29 marks on the stone.\n\nThey believe most of the marks match famous constellations of the sky's brightest stars like Orion, Scorpius and Cassiopeia.\n\nThe stone was discovered in an old hill fort in north east Italy, near a second similar blank stone that researchers believe might have been a representation of the sun.\n\nA study of the marked disc found that 28 of the 29 marks on the stone appeared to match the position of 28 stars in the sky.\n\nBut there was no obvious connection for the 29th mark - and the researchers have said this might be a star that has turned into a supernova or a black hole and is no longer visible to us today.\n\n\"The unidentified mark challenges the whole picture,\" study authors Ferico Bernardini and Paolo Molaro wrote.\n\n\"The case of a failed supernova is really intriguing as one of the techniques to search for them is precisely to look for missing stars in the current sky, by using images taken at previous times.\"\n\nThe study suggests the stone was used to help track the seasons throughout the year."
