        "text": "Sky plc, the owner of Sky News, has agreed to a takeover by 21st Century Fox, the international film and television giant behind hit shows like The Simpsons and Modern Family, valuing it at £18.5bn.\n\nNews of the deal, which is expected to be completed before the end of 2017, comes six days after the two companies said they were in talks about a possible takeover.\n\nThe cash offer values Sky shares at £10.75 each and, in addition, Sky shareholders will receive any dividends paid by the company.\n\nThat represents a modest improvement on the terms announced last Friday.\n\n21st Century Fox, the world's fourth-largest media company after Comcast, Disney and Time Warner, currently owns 39.1% of Sky and it has long been speculated in the City that it would seek to buy full control.\n\nThe company, whose other media assets include 20th Century Fox, one of Hollywood's largest studios, has committed to keep Sky's headquarters in London and to complete a £1bn investment in the campus.\n\nIt said it would maintain Sky's \"standard of excellence\" in business and community initiatives and said it would continue to broadcast news \"under the Sky brand maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code.\"\n\nIn a stock exchange statement, announcing the deal, 21st Century Fox said: \"The strategic rationale for this combination is clear.\n\n\"It creates a global leader in content creation and distribution, enhances our sports and entertainment scale, and gives us unique and leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies.\n\n\"It adds the strength of the Sky brand to our portfolio, including the Fox, National Geographic and Star brands.\n\n\"Sky is a creative, commercial, and consumer powerhouse delivering its own content to customers across all platforms.\n\n\"Sky is the number one PayTV brand in all its key markets, with an exciting growth runway in each. The enhanced capabilities of the combined company will be underpinned by a more geographically diverse and stable revenue base.\n\n\"It will also create an improved balance between subscription, affiliate fee, advertising and content revenues. This combination creates an agile organisation that is equipped to better succeed in a global market.\"\n\nSky, which is Europe's biggest pay television broadcaster with 21 million subscribers in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, set up an independent committee of directors to negotiate with 21st Century Fox.\n\nJames Murdoch, Sky's chairman, is not on the committee because he is chief executive of 21st Century Fox.\n\nThe committee was headed by Martin Gilbert, the company's deputy chairman and included Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive of Sky and Andrew Griffith, Sky's chief operating officer and chief financial officer.\n\nOthers on the committee include Andrew Sukawaty, another non-executive director of Sky and previously chief executive of Inmarsat, the European satellite operator.\n\nMr Gilbert, the founder and chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management - one of Europe's biggest fund management firms - and a respected City grandee, said that, while the committee remained confident in Sky's long-term prospects, 21st Century Fox's offer would \"accelerate and de-risk the delivery of future value for all Sky shareholders.\"\n\nHe added: \"The independent committee...notes 21st Century Fox's track record in growing businesses and its ability to continue the development of Sky across Europe, in a world where entertainment and distribution are converging.\n\n\"21st Century Fox's ownership will support the delivery of Sky's strategy and long-term growth, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of Europe's creative industries.\"\n\nThe deal is likely to be met with criticism in some quarters.\n\nNews Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media giant, tabled an £8bn takeover bid in June 2010 for the shares in Sky - then called British Sky Broadcasting - that it did not already own.\n\nThat deal attracted a good deal of scrutiny because it would have brought together Sky News with News Corporation's UK media assets, including The Sun, Britain's biggest-selling daily newspaper, The Times, The Sunday Times and the News Of The World.\n\nThis attracted criticism from rivals of those newspapers about a concentration of media ownership and, in response to regulatory concerns, BSkyB agreed to hive off Sky News as a separate company.\n\nHowever, in July 2011, News Corporation abandoned its offer when it emerged that the News Of The World had hacked the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.\n\nNews Corporation subsequently demerged its film and television assets outside Australia into a new company, 21st Century Fox, leaving it as a business focused on newspaper titles from around the world - including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post - as well as the book publisher Harper Collins.\n\nBut Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, has called for the takeover to be delayed. Some minority shareholders in Sky, including Standard Life, have also said they think £10.75-a-share undervalues the company.\n\n21st Century Fox is seeking to complete the takeover by a so-called \"scheme of arrangement\", a type of takeover that can be completed more quickly than traditional takeover bids.\n\nUnder the scheme, a bidder only needs the support of 75% of a company's independent shareholders before minority shareholders opposed to the offer are compelled to accept it, compared with a traditional takeover - where a bidder must win the support of 90% of all shareholders.\n\nThe move is not without risk because 21st Century Fox would not be able to vote its own 39.1% holding under the scheme of arrangement.\n\nKaren Bradley, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, now has 10 days in which to refer the bid to Ofcom, the media industry regulator, for it to check whether the deal might harm plurality in the country's media.\n\n:: Government to be 'fair and impartial on Sky takeover\n\nOfcom would then have 40 days to investigate and, if it declares itself happy with the deal, Ms Bradley would then need to approve it.\n\nIf Ofcom has concerns, then 21st Century Fox would have to address them, after which, if Ms Bradley was still concerned about aspects of the takeover, she could refer it to the Competition and Markets Authority, which would have six months to carry out a full investigation.\n\nAfter that, Ms Bradley would have another 30 days to approve it, with or without conditions, or block it.\n\nThere are likely to be fewer concerns this time around about concentration in the news market due to the demerger of News Corp and the fact that newspapers have continued to lose market share to online competitors during the last six years.\n\nThen, as now, the dominant provider of news in the UK is the BBC. In 2010, at the time of the original News Corporation bid for BSkyB, the European Commission declared that there was no reason to block the deal on competition grounds.\n\nSky traces its origins to Sky Television - which was launched by Rupert Murdoch in February 1989.\n\nThe business merged with rival satellite broadcaster British Satellite Broadcasting in November 1990 and it floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1994 in a move that saw News Corporation's stake reduced to 40%.\n\nHowever, it retained close ties with News Corporation and 21st Century Fox that, two years ago, saw Sky buy the American company's interests in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to become a pan-European broadcaster.\n\nBecause 21st Century Fox already owns some 39.1% of Sky, buying full control of the company would cost it an estimated £11.25bn.\n\nSpeculation has mounted about a possible deal in recent months due to the fall in the pound against the US dollar - reducing the value of Sky, whose shares are quoted in sterling, in dollar terms.\n\nBefore the takeover, Sky shares had fallen by around 30% since the beginning of the year and some 40% in US dollar terms, making it easier for 21st Century Fox to act."
