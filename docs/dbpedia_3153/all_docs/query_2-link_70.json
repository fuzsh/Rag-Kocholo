        "text": "A bike tour from Olang to Lake Braies is a real highlight for nature lovers and cycling enthusiasts. The route leads through the picturesque landscape of the Dolomites and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.\n\nThe route is about 20 kilometres long and requires a medium level of fitness, as it also includes some ascents. There are numerous opportunities to take a break and enjoy nature along the way. The section beside the river is particularly attractive, where the babbling of the water provides a calming backdrop.\n\nLake Braies itself, often referred to as the ‘Pearl of the Dolomites’, is the crowning glory of the tour. This lake is famous for its intense turquoise-coloured water and the dramatic mountain backdrop reflected in the clear water. Once you reach your destination, you can relax on the lakeside, hike around the lake or stop off at one of the local restaurants to enjoy traditional South Tyrolean dishes.\n\nIn summer, we recommend starting early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds as much as possible.\n\nBrunico, a charming little city in the heart of the Puster Valley, offers visitors a fascinating mix of cultural diversity and local tradition, especially at its lively markets. Every market day transforms the town into a colourful hive of activity, where fresh, local products such as South Tyrolean speck, cheese and homemade bread fill the air with delicious smells.\n\nIn addition to the culinary delights, the market in Brunico also offers an excellent opportunity to experience the local culture up close. Here you can meet the locals and find out at first-hand what makes life in South Tyrol so unique.\n\nA visit to the markets in Brunico is not just a shopping experience, but a journey of discovery through the traditions and hospitality of South Tyrol that enchants every visitor and creates unforgettable memories. Don't miss out on this unique experience!\n\nThe Monte Specie on the Prato Piazza is a popular hiking destination in the Braies Dolomites. The summit is most easily reached from the Prato Piazza car park, which lies at around 2,000 metres above sea level. This high plateau is known for its stunning panoramas of the surrounding mountain ranges, including the famous Three Peaks.\n\nThis moderately difficult hike leads through alpine meadows and sparse forests, following a well-signposted route. The summit of the Monte Specie, which lies at an altitude of 2,307 metres, offers a spectacular view of the entire Braies Valley as well as the more distant peaks of South Tyrol.\n\nIn addition to the impressive mountain scenery, the area is also known for its flora and fauna. In spring and early summer, numerous alpine flowers bloom on the meadows of Prato Piazza. The fauna is also richly represented with a variety of bird species and typical alpine animals such as marmots.\n\nThe hike to the Monte Specie promises unforgettable impressions and spectacular views that you won't forget.\n\nImportant: In the summer months, an online booking is required to enter the Braies Valley by car.\n\nThe inspiration for the drink came last summer, driven by a preference for basil in cocktails and influenced by the excellent Gin Basil Smash created by Jörg Meyer at the Lion Bar de Paris in Hamburg in 2008. This cocktail sparked an interest in the combination of basil and cucumber, which led to the idea of combining these ingredients in a homemade syrup.\n\nIn order to give the mixture an additional visual and taste accent, consideration was given to how the green colour of the syrup could be intensified by an additional component. The decision was made to integrate a mango mousse, which is not only visually appealing, but also complements the herbal, botanical flavour of the syrup with a fruity note. When developing the recipe, the challenge was to balance the proportions of the ingredients to ensure that all components work harmoniously together. The result is a cocktail whose colouring is a reminder of the green of nature and the bright summer sun.\n\nNow in spring, not only the nature around the Hotel Hubertus will blossom, but also the hotel will present itself with fresh innovations from summer 2024 that will make your experience even more unforgettable. Look forward to a new spa area that takes relaxation and regeneration to a new level. 10 newly created treatment rooms open their doors to offer a refuge of peace and well-being. From aromatic massages that revitalise the senses to personalised facial and body treatments tailored to the individual needs of each guest - every visit promises profound relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\nIn addition, our gastronomic offer will be expanded with an additional dining area that invites you to enjoy culinary delights in a new ambience. The panoramic windows offer a view of the breathtaking landscape that surrounds the hotel, creating an atmosphere in which every dish becomes a unique experience.\n\nBe prepared to live unforgettable moments!\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the latest edition of our magazine \"Hubertus View\" is now available for you. With great care and attention to detail, we have put together content that not only reflects the beauty of our surroundings, but also the depth of experiences that our hotel has to offer.\n\nIn this edition, you can immerse yourself in a world full of enjoyment, adventure and memories. From culinary highlights and our signature cocktail \"Green Blossom\" to the exciting development of our hotel logo and breathtaking tobogganing adventures in Olang. Experience the warm-hearted stories of Grandma and Helga, who remind us of the importance of family and tradition. Find out how we emphasise sustainability, take on the \"Black Five Challenge\" at Kronplatz and discover the \"Play of Light in the Mountains\" on a sensual hike. The \"Hubertus View\" is your invitation to explore the many facets of life in our hotel and its surroundings.\n\nTake a moment to scroll through the pages of our magazine and be touched and inspired by the stories we have to share. \"Hubertus View\" is waiting to be discovered by you.\n\nSnowshoeing offers an unforgettable experience in the majestic winter landscape of the Dolomites. This activity is ideal for guests who want to enjoy the peace and beauty of nature far from the busy ski slopes. Along the way, hikers can enjoy the silence of nature, interrupted only by the crunch of snow beneath their feet.\n\nThe area around Plan de Corones/Kronplatz, known for its breathtaking panoramas and well-maintained hiking trails, is a paradise for snowshoe hikers. The enchanting winter landscape can be explored with snowshoes, which make it easy to get around on the deep snow. The routes vary in difficulty and length, making them attractive not only for beginners but also for experienced hikers.\n\nHere with us, guests can choose from a variety of indoor activities designed to keep body and mind active and relaxed while staying inside. The activities included are for example water gymnastics, aerobics and stretching, which take place under professional guidance and are suitable for all fitness levels.\n\nFitness enthusiasts will also get their money's worth in the modern fitness room. The hotel offers regular guided yoga and pilates classes that bring body and mind into harmony and ensure a balanced holiday as well.\n\nThese activities are perfect for days when guests would rather enjoy the beauty of the surroundings from the inside or when the weather leaves something to be desired.\n\nDiscover a harmonious balance between activity and relaxation, surrounded by the breathtaking scenery of the Dolomites.\n\nThis unique tour begins with an exciting snowcat ride through the glittering landscape of the Dolomites. Upon arrival at the Fanes High Plateau, a guided snowshoe hike awaits you. Equipped with snowshoes, you'll explore the enchanting winter landscape. The gentle sound of your steps in the snow and the peaceful atmosphere of nature offer an intense natural experience. Along the way, Werner will share interesting information about the flora and fauna of the Fanes-Sennes-Braies nature park.\n\nAfter a day full of adventures in the winter splendour of the Dolomites, the wellness area of the hotel provides the ideal opportunity to relax and regenerate.\n\nIt perfectly rounds off the comprehensive offer of adventure, leisure and gastronomy and ensures that your stay in the heart of the Dolomites will be unforgettable.\n\nThe series \"Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby\" is produced by the BBC and takes its viewers on a journey to some of the most extraordinary and luxurious accommodations in the world. In its latest episode, which had its premiere on 24 December, a special focus was placed on our Hotel Hubertus.\n\nThis episode of \"Amazing Hotels\" offers an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the hotel. Viewers learn more about the history and philosophy of the Hubertus, meet the passionate staff and discover the culinary highlights that are prepared with great care using local ingredients.\n\nIn addition, the programme highlights how our hotel harmonises seamlessly with its surrounding alpine environment, highlighting both the unique architecture and our sustainable practices.\n\nWe are extremely pleased and proud to be part of the prestigious series \"Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby\".\n\nDid you know that the Hotel Hubertus already exists since 1984? At that time, it was a small guesthouse with only a few rooms. In order to increase the occupancy rate, the Gasser family founded two travel agencies for bus tourism in 1992. Gradually, renovations and extensions were carried out. Already in 1994, the first investment in sustainability was made and a wood-chip heating system was built. An absolute highlight of the hotel is the Skypool, which was completed in 2016. However, this amazing construction was not the end of the expansion work. It was followed in 2022 by the construction of the free-floating wellness platform Heaven&Hell with its relaxation room. A unique architectural masterpiece.\n\nHave you become curious? Here you can find the detailed history of the hotel.\n\nBaking pizza like a professional? It's easy here at the Alpin Panorama Hotel Hubertus. Just come to the Hubertus oven and learn from pizzaiolo Paolo Monaco how to prepare traditional Italian pizzas. 🍕\n\nTo make sure that you can use the skills you've learned also at home, here's the recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n900 g flour \"00\"\n\n100 g wholemeal flour\n\n5 g fresh yeast\n\n30 g salt (fine)\n\n580 ml water\n\n30 ml extra virgin olive oil\n\nPreparation:\n\nDissolve the yeast in the water\n\nMix it with the flour\n\nAdd salt\n\nAdd olive oil\n\nLeave it to rest for 20 minutes at room temperature\n\nForm dough pieces (approx. 250g)\n\nLeave the dough to rest at room temperature for 5 hours\n\nRoll out the dough\n\nCover it\n\nPlace the dough into the oven (approx. 20 minutes at 200° - depending on the thickness of the dough)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nOh, I see, you're not so into cooking? 😏 Don't worry! You are also welcome to just stop by and enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. 😉\n\n\"Taking a bath in the atmosphere of the forest\". This is how the Japanese health trend Shinrin Yoku can be translated - or simply: forest bathing.\n\nWho doesn't know the revitalizing feeling that comes over you when you breathe in the fresh air during a short walk in the forest and immediately feel much more relaxed and balanced? The forest has an enormous healing potential, because in addition to relaxation, it provides stimulation without being too demanding. In a mindful interaction with the forest, one can rediscover one's natural balance.\n\nHere are three exercise suggestions for you:\n\n1 Feel your roots\n\nFind a comfortable place in the forest, where you can stand safely and steadily. You are also invited to take off your shoes. Close your eyes. Now consciously pay attention to your breath flow and feel how you absorb energy from the forest air with each inhalation and how you let the blockages and stress flow away with each exhalation.\n\n2 Sensory journey\n\nFor this exercise, too, first find a comfortable place. Breathe in and out deeply three times and then focus your attention on each sense in turn. What do you see? Look at the forest around you. Then close your eyes. What do you hear? Keep your eyes closed and then try to feel the forest atmosphere. What do you feel? Finally, take a few deep breaths. What do you smell?\n\n3 Mindful walking at a snail's pace\n\nChoose a path in the forest and move forward as mindfully as possible. Try to feel every movement - every step, every push and roll of the foot. Does the forest floor feel dry, damp, cold, warm, soft or uneven? What can you feel under your feet?"
