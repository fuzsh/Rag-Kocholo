        "text": "Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has taken full control of Sky Italia - more than a year after launching the satellite pay-TV platform.\n\nNews Corporation paid £60m for the 19.9% of Sky Italia it did not already own, taking it off Telecom Italia's hands.\n\nThe deal simplifies the ownership structure at Sky Italia, a platform with more than 2.7m subscribers in Italy.\n\nSky Italia was formed last year, when Mr Murdoch was allowed to buy pay-TV company Telepiu from Vivendi Universal and then merge it with his own service, Stream, which was co-owned by Telecom Italia.\n\nThe merged group, 80.1%-owned by News Corp, began broadcasting as Sky Italia in July 2003.\n\nSky Italia was launched soon after News Corp took over US pay-TV company DirecTV. Between them, the deals revived Mr Murdoch's ambitions of building a global satellite broadcasting network.\n\nNews Corp's other worldwide businesses include its 35.4% stake in BSkyB in the UK and Ireland, and Star TV in Asia.\n\nMaking pay-TV a success in Italy is complicated by the piracy that is widespread in the country, with more than 3m Italian homes able to access pay-TV services through illegally manufactured decoder cards.\n\n· Virgin dropped out of the internet business today when it announced it was selling its 51% stake in internet service provider Virgin Net to cable giant NTL for an undisclosed sum.\n\nNTL takes full ownership of the venture, which the two companies launched in 1996, and will keep the Virgin Net name."
