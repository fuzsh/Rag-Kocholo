        "text": "753\n\nSometimes we in Abruzzo can be immune to the wonders around us, the incredible mist, cloud and play of the light in the mountains, we almost take it for granted! Then some fresh eyes come along to pull us back and say wow, making us appreciate this magical region on the doorstep of Rome, in this case, it was the Landscape PhotographyVlogcast team that recently visited the region for the first time.\n\n“This trip had been in the making for over two years due to world events. Although Matt, Tom and I had been doing the Landscape Photography Vlogcast together for some time, we had not met in person up to this point. So, the idea was born; a trip over to Italy to visit Matt and at the same time scout for a future workshop. We managed to get a window in which we were all available to travel so off we went.\n\nArriving in Rome, Matt greeted us at the airport to take us to our first destination in Abruzzo, the castle, Rocca Calascio perched fifteen hundred metres up on a Gran Sasso mountainside (making it one of the highest castles in Europe). It was spectacular, and to top it off we stayed in an apartment at the ‘Rifugio‘ in the medieval village of Calascio below it (a ten-minute walk from our door to the castle).\n\nWe spent a magical two days at this location before moving on for a further two days in Intermesoli at the Ristoro del Venacquaro on the other side of the Gran Sasso range of mountains in the province of Teramo.\n\nIn this area (which had a different feel entirely from the first location), we were greeted by the Gran Sasso mountains which I have no other words for other than epic. Rising from the valley floors below and towering up above us, they were enormous and unlike anything I had experienced before, especially on a photography trip. This area is spectacular and relatively unvisited by international photographers (as local knowledge is a must here to find the locations). Having someone local, who not only speaks the language but knows the area intimately is essential. We were lucky to have not only Matt, who lives and works in Italy but also Luigi Nespeca, who is local to the area and climbs these mountains every week.\n\nI have to say that I am completely in love with this area, the people and the culture. Everything about it is amazing and the area has so much worth exploring, especially for photography. Moving on from this trip, we will be offering workshops in this area. Not only will it be somewhere new for international photographers to experience; but it will also be a huge benefit to this area of Italy. Stay tuned for announcements regarding these tours and planned dates on the Vlogcast!\n\nView more of Paul Thomson’s work on YouTube"
