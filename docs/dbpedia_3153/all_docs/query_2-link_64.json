        "text": "Related Story\n\nSky Italia has filed an appeal with a Milan court that seeks to \"block\" the awarding of the '21-24 Serie A TV rights to DAZN. Following the March 26 award, Sky Italia had anticipated being awarded rights to \"three weekly matches on a non-exclusive basis, but was refused.\" In its appeal, Sky Italia alleges the violation of the so-called \"Melandri Law\" that prohibits a single operator from \"acquiring all the rights\" to Serie A matches. Sky Italia has since announced plans to \"reduce staff by a quarter\" and its CEO, Maximo Ibarra, will leave the company in July. The court hearing is scheduled to \"take place on May 5\" (IL SOLE 24 ORE, 4/22)."
