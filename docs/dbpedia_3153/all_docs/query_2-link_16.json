        "text": "LONDON, UK – 10 November 2014\n\nSky Italia has selected Amobee as its data management platform (DMP) to deliver more personalised advertising experiences to customers and meet a range of digital marketing needs including real-time bidding.\n\nThe partnership with Amobee is part of a wider move towards programmatic advertising for Sky; 70 percent of the company’s brand advertising now runs programmatically through the Amobee platform. Amobee has developed 22 consumer audience profiles for the broadcaster, which can be leveraged to deliver personalized content and experiences. The partnership is facilitated by Simple Agency (AMNET), Sky Italia’s agency of record.\n\nThe Amobee platform allows Sky Italia to build its own architecture for targeting customer audience segments, enabling the broadcaster to serve different creative content to meet the individual needs and preferences of its broad customer base. Sky’s diverse audience means that delivering customised messaging is essential to keep customers engaged in the brand.\n\nSky Italia identified several features of Amobee as particularly relevant to its needs, including:\n\nThe ability to analyse and act upon big data in milliseconds: Marketing increasingly revolves around real-time interactions and reactions, so appearing at the right time with the right message for a particular audience is crucial.\n\nTargeting audiences anonymously based on activities, preferences and buying: By working with Amobee and its anonymised profile model, using only non-personally identifiable information, consumers receive relevant and targeted communication without giving away personal and unique details. Sky Italia leveraged the personalisation to optimise website content with creative experiences based on user interests and demographics.\n\nAldo Agostinelli, Sky Italia Digital Marketing and Sales Director said, “The plethora of data available to the broadcast industry has made digital marketing increasingly complex. Our customers are demanding personalised viewing experiences – and this extends to all of the ways we engage with them through marketing. We needed a way to match data with storytelling and creativity to deliver against the premier viewing experiences for which Sky is known. We’re already seeing great results from this approach; click-through-rates on ads have doubled, and bounce rates from our website have decreased by 40%.”\n\nAgostinelli continued: “There is a whole spectrum of technology for the marketer to engage with today, but our strategic partnership with Amobee offers us a toolkit to meet every current, as well as future, need for our audiences. With both the marketing and technology pieces in place, Sky Italia can truly thrive with an “audience first” approach based on real data insights to inform our strategy.”\n\nPierre Naggar, Managing Director EMEA at Amobee, said, “Amobee is providing Sky Italia with a data management platform tailored to their business needs. In the competitive media landscape, particularly when audiences consume content across numerous channels, it’s crucial that marketers surround themselves with technology partners that facilitate the analysis of big data across the business. Digital tools are the catalyst to deliver more personalised, relevant advertising experiences and, with the right strategy in place, every single byte of brand communications can be powerful.”\n\nAbout Amobee\n\nFounded in 2005, Amobee is an advertising platform that understands how people consume content. Our goal is to optimize outcomes for advertisers and media companies, while providing a better consumer experience. Through our platform, we help customers further their audience development, optimize their cross channel performance across all TV, connected TV, and digital media, and drive new customer growth through detailed analytics and reporting. Amobee is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singtel, one of the largest communications technology companies in the world."
