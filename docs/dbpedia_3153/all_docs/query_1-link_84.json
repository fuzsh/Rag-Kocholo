        "text": "Edra as the Official Partner of Casa Italia for paris 2024 olympics\n\nThe occasion of the XXXIII Olympic Games in Paris from 26 July to 11 August, 2024, reconfirms the partnership of Casa Italia and Edra which, once again, furnishes the spaces that welcome the Paris 2024 Olympic athletes and guests to Le Pré Catelan, the 19th century pavilion in Napoleon III-style, immersed in the atmospheric Bois de Boulogne. This historic venue, chosen by the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI), hosts the Team Italia athletes and their guests, transforming the site into an exhibition titled Ensemble. With Edra’s collections of chairs, sofas, tables, and armchairs, the hospitality concept marks the first time that Casa Italia has invited the public to explore a comprehensive display of art, architecture, and design, creating a total work of art that embodies the spirit of the Olympics.\n\nfor Paris 2024, Casa Italia transforms Le Pré Catelan into a scenic emotional journey with Edra as the furnishing partner | all images © Pietro Savorelli, courtesy of Edra\n\nENSEMBLE bridges modern cultural identity in france & italy\n\nEnsemble evokes harmony and unity, drawing inspiration from music and fashion—pillars of modern cultural identity in both France and Italy. The 2024 theme carries extra significance as the Olympics return to Europe after twelve years, paving the way for Italy’s upcoming role as host of the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. Developed by Lorenzo Pellicelli, Direction Marketing CONI, and Beatrice Bertini, with the architectural project by IT’s architectural firm, exhibition Ensemble focuses on connections between the new and existing, expressed through the concepts of weaving and environmental sustainability, with furnishings designed to last over time.\n\nEspecially for the Paris 2024 Olympics, Casa Italia, established by the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI), collaborated with Edra, a Tuscan sofa and furnishing company founded in 1987 by Valerio and Monica Mazzei. Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, Edra has been a key partner of Casa Italia, providing furniture that enhances the artistic and cultural themes of each project. Edra’s designs, known for their bold aesthetics and high functionality, contribute to the overall ambiance of the hospitality project, reflecting the excellence and creativity of Italian design. The collaboration between the two brands reflects the evolution of Casa Italia from a Hospitality House to a globally recognized brand that tells the story of Italian culture and excellence.\n\nthe Ensemble project features a variety of tree species and works by artists and authors that express Italian creativity, identity, and excellence\n\ncasa italia & edra exemplify italian design at Le Pré Catelan\n\nEdra, the Tuscan sofa and furnishing company, has been collaborating with Casa Italia since the 2016 Olympics\n\nEdra’s indoor and outdoor collections of sofas, chairs, tables, armchairs, and storage elements decorate spaces ranging from interview and conference rooms to restaurants, lounges, galleries, and gardens. Specifically, Francesco Binfaré’s On the Rocks sofa in the athletes’ restaurant creates an indoor landscape that is fluid and natural, reinforcing the aim to blur the lines between indoor and outdoor settings. The designer’s Standard sofa, in its outdoor version, adds comfort to the garden of Le Pré Catelan’s Michelin-starred restaurant. These products highlight Casa Italia’s focus on enhancing comfort, functionality, and visitor experience, ensuring that everyone feels at home.\n\n‘In sport we recognize the strong values that have inspired our company for more than thirty years. In the first place passion, but also the daily discipline of doing our work, and the ability to dare. That is why Edra and its collection will testify again this year to excellence that comes from a desire to always push ourselves forward, in healthy global competition,’ says Edra’s co-founder, Monica Mazzei.\n\n‘in sport we recognize the strong values that have inspired our company for more than thirty years,’ says Edra’s co-founder, Monica Mazzei.\n\nthe Standard sofa by Francesco Binfaré\n\nSherazade by Francesco Binfaré beneath the Tapetto Volante by the Stalker Group"
