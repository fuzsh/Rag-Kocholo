        "text": "Sky has acquired Diagonal View, the multi-channel network of British origin known for brands like Alltime10s and The Football Daily. According to the specialized magazine Daily Media, the financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, but the goal of the broadcaster is to increase its influence in sports, reach and engage a younger audience, and provide Sky Media investors with new opportunities in the digital world.\n\nDiagonal View boasts an audience of 15 million subscribers and hosts content ranging from quantum physics to sports and football through The Football Daily channel. As for the financial performance, the company does not generate profits yet. In 2016, as reported by Campaign, it recorded a red of around 550,000 pounds.\n\nThe management team of Diagonal View, including Heinman, will continue to lead the business within the Sky Group. Jamie West and David Gibbs will take care of the integration of the company within Sky.\n\n“Diagonal View knows how to produce content that entertains and engages the digital natives, so this is a win-win partnership for us and for Sky.” – said the founder of Diagonal View Matt Heiman."
