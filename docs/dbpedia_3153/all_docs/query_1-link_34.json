        "text": "Italy]: [Stabilimento di costruzioni aeronautiche] [circa 1920-1925]. First Edition. [1], 68 leaves. Oblong. 13 x 19 inches. Title leaf plus sixty eight sepia toned collotypes, each captioned in the lower center margin. Additionally each leaf marked \"Stabilimento di Costruzioni Aeronautiche\" lower right. No author or publication information noted (consistent with OCLC entries). New cloth binding and spine string ties incorporating (as a front panel inset) the front cover of the original pressboard covers. Title leaf trimmed at top edge with no loss of content, frayed at edges. Ex-library Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences, with embossed emblem on first and last leaf. Library of Congress surplus stamp on title leaf. Otherwise the plates are in excellent condition. Presentation inscription on front cover: \"To ??? with compliments and regards from Silvio Scaroni, Washington, October 24, 26\" Very Good. Cloth. [26858]\n\nThe Servizio Aeronautico (Aeronautical Service) was created by Italian law June 27, 1912 (nr. 698). One component of the service was \"Stabilimento di Costruzioni Aeronautiche sempre a Roma\" or the \"Aeronautical Construction Plant\" whose name is found on each plate lower right. Among the many aerial views of Italy, a large number are of Rome, including one of the \"Stadio Nazionale e Ippodromo Parioli\". Based on comparable images found online, we would date this particular image to around 1920. The first image, of Monte Adamello, is taken through the struts of the aeroplane. It is also marked in ink \"120\".\n\nLieutenant Silvio Scaroni was Italy's Air Attache to the United States where on November 13, 1926 he attended the Schneider Trophy air races outside of Washington DC. The Schneider Trophy air races were a significant international event, with the Americans and Italians vying for top honors in 1926 (the Italians won when Major de Bernardi broke at least four world speed records for seaplanes). 30,000 spectators viewed the event. While by this time Scaroni was a politician, he was in World War I an Italian fighter pilot and the second ranking Ace with 26 kills to his name. Scaroni was no doubt doubly pleased with this gift after Italy's triumph at the race. Mussolini during this period was making good on his promises to significantly strengthen the Italian air forces.\n\nPrevious owner the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences (IAS), founded in 1932 as the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences merged with the American Rocket Society in 1963, becoming the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).\n\nOnly three copies in OCLC/Worldcat as of this writing (Seattle Public, Univ Wisconsin Milw, and Natl Geographic Soc Library). Title loosely translates to: \"Italy View from the Sky\" by \"Aeronautical construction plant.\" OCLC/Worldcat adds the following attribution on one copy: \"Laboratorio fotografico\" or Photographic laboratory.\"\n\nSee Wikipedia for a basic biography of Scaroni and the 1927 Aircraft Year Book for a review of the Schneider races of 1926.\n\nPrice: $1,250.00"
