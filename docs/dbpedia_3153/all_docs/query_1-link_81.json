        "text": "Emanuela Podda Ankrom May 30th, 2019 - 11:23 PM\n\nSky Italia is producing Romulus, the new 10-episode original series set during the creation of Rome, in the eighth century B.C., according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sky is producing with Groenlandia and ITV Studio’s Cattleya. The show will be shot in archaic Latin. Director Matteo Rovere (Drifters, Italian Race) will be the showrunner. Rovere’s last film Romulus and Remus: The First King premiered this year in Italy portraying the mythology of the two rival brothers and the foundation of Rome. Michele Alhaique and Enrico Maria Ariale will also serve as directors.\n\n“Romulus is a story about feelings, war, brotherhood, courage, and fear. It is a great epic fresco, a highly realistic reconstruction of the events that led to the foundation of Rome,” Rovere stated. “But above all, it is an investigation into the origins and the profound meaning of power in the West: a journey into an archaic and frightening world, where everything is sacred and people feel the mysterious and hostile presence of the gods everywhere.”\n\nProduction on Romulus will begin in Rome and its surrounding areas in early June 2019. The series is written by Rovere together with Guido Luculano and Filippo Gravino. The other cast members include Silvia Calderoni, Giovanni Buselli, Demetra Avincola, Sergio Romano, Massimiliano Rossi, Vanessa Scalera, Ivana Lotito and Gabriel Montesi.\n\n“Romulus is an epic series in the true sense of the word, an international project featuring some of the youngest and outstanding Italian talents,” said Nicola Maccanico, Sky Italia executive vice president of programming. “[It’s] a project that has at its heart what is perhaps the most recognizable brand of our country, Rome, which is once again set to attract worldwide attention with a great story to tell—that of the founding of the Eternal City and its myth—raw, realistic, powerful. Our history, the most proudly local of all,” Maccanico added.\n\nThe series may be Sky’s most ambitious project to date, with two historical cities rebuilt in detail, recreated historical weapons, hundreds of stunt people, and thousands of extras. Sky’s successful shows include Gomorra and The Young Pope. Its upcoming projects include ZeroZeroZero and Devils."
