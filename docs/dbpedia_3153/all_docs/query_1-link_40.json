        "text": "Andrea Carmignani, Co-founder and CEO of Keyless, was recently featured in an insightful interview with Alberto Giuffrè of SkyTG24, where he discussed the strides Keyless has made in the realm of biometric authentication technology. During the interview, Andrea detailed how Keyless is pioneering a privacy-preserving approach to digital identity management—a timely innovation amid growing concerns over data privacy and security.\n\nAndrea explained how the Keyless system, which eschews traditional passwords in favor of biometric technology, generates cryptographic keys tied uniquely to a user's face and device. This method is the first to combine on-device biometrics and cloud storage, the two existing biometric authentication technologies, effectively protecting against identity theft, account takeovers, and fraud—particularly critical in applications such as home banking and payment platforms.\n\nThroughout the interview, Andrea emphasized the relevance of their technology in light of the 2023 Artificial Intelligence Act, which sets comprehensive, safe, and rights-respecting rules for AI use in Europe, including limitations on biometric identification. Andrea highlighted the distinction between public surveillance applications and Keyless’s user-centric approach. Unlike systems that merely unlock devices, Keyless encrypts biometric data before sending it to the cloud, transforming it in a way that it no longer qualifies as biometric data under legal definitions. This unique association ensures GDPR compliance while boosting privacy and security.\n\nThe Keyless CEO shared his vision for a future devoid of passwords, where digital interactions are both safer and more intuitive. He pointed out the archaic nature of password systems, which have remained largely unchanged for 60 years, and portrayed Keyless's biometric solution as a revolutionary step forward.\n\nThis interview not only shed light on the technical innovations at Keyless but also underscored the significant implications for privacy and security in the digital age. By adopting such advanced biometric recognition technologies, Keyless is redefining the standards of biometric authentication and digital identity, paving the way for a more secure and private world."
