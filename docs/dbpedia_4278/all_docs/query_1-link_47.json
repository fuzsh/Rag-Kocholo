While in school, he participated in a master class with Guido Agosti in 1981, and placed first in the Gardner-Webb College Concerto Competition one year later. Following graduation, Mr. Knight went on to pursue a career in software engineering, yet continued to take master classes and hone his musical hobby. He looks to the Amateur Competition as a means to test his aptitude: “It gives me not only a reason to learn new, challenging repertoire, but also an opportunity to perform it for people who truly understand and appreciate piano literature.” The motorcycle buff is a father of four and grandfather of three, and has been married 18 years to his wife, Cathy.\n\nProgram:\n\nLISZT Mephisto Waltz No. 1\n\nLISZT Paganini Etude No. 3 in G-sharp Minor (“La Campanella”)\n\nJorge Zamora – Cliburn Amateur 2016 Quarterfinal Round Recital\n\nJORGE ZAMORA, 43\n\nSales director\n\nMexico City, Mexico\n\nMexico\n\n2016 Cliburn International Amateur Piano Competition\n\nQuarterfinal Round – Wednesday, June 22, 2016\n\nVan Cliburn Recital Hall\n\nFort Worth, Texas, USA\n\nJorge Zamora studied piano privately for years before earning his bachelor’s degree in electronics and communications engineering at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies in Monterrey, Mexico.

Mr. Vann Griffith was a composition major at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and in ensuing years, has worked as a programmer, website developer, classical music announcer, and orchestral pianist.

When she was 14, she won the Van Cliburn scholarship to the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan, where she met Mr. Cliburn at a ceremony: “He complimented my playing and, memorably, kissed my hand.” But an accident—in which she slipped on ice and broke her left wrist—during her junior year at Northwestern University sidelined her budding career, and Ms. Marina decided to pursue a law degree at Cornell Law School. For 20 years, she worked as a trademark lawyer until she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which forced her to take a step back. In participating at the Amateur Competition, Ms. Marina hopes to achieve her personal best and to be a role model for her 9-year-old daughter, Sydney, showing her that one can accomplish dreams in the face of obstacles.\n\nProgram:\n\nBEETHOVEN, Sonata No. 3 in C Major, op. 2, no. 3: I.

After years away from the piano—and watching They Came to Play, the 2007 Cliburn Amateur Competition documentary—she realized she wanted to play again too.

Instead of furthering her musical pursuits, Ms. Knipe turned the scholarship down to forge a career in law. Now a deputy attorney general for the department of justice in California, she has returned to music after 35 years away, realizing “how central the piano is to my life.” A mother of two grown daughters, Ms. Knipe is a lover of the performing arts, movies, and books, as well as a fan of good food and wine.\n\nProgram:\n\nCHOPIN, Scherzo No. 2 in B-flat Minor, op. 31\n\nRAVEL, Jeau d’eau\n\nColleen Adent – Cliburn Amateur 2016 Quarterfinal Round Recital\n\n2016 Cliburn International Amateur Piano Competition\n\nQuarterfinal Round\n\nVan Cliburn Recital Hall\n\nFort Worth, Texas, USA\n\nTuesday, June 21, 2016\n\nColleen Adent, 54\n\nHomemaker\n\nVancouver, Washington\n\nUnited States\n\nA self-professed explorer, Colleen Adent enjoys “finding out how things were made, where they came from, and what I can learn that I didn’t know about before.” She received a bachelor’s degree in piano performance from Biola University (La Mirada, California) in 1983.

He received a bachelor’s degree in music from Oxford University in 1977, and a doctorate in musicology from Cambridge University in 1985. Highlights for Dr. Finlow during this time included performances of the Brahms B-flat Major Concerto and Rhapsody in Blue with orchestra. “Hard reality,” he says, forced him along another path towards a career in IT engineering and management, following his move to the United States in 1985. Two key events in 2013 changed the direction of Dr. Finlow’s life: He quit his high-stress job that was taking a serious toll on his health, and he attended the Fourteenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. After learning about the Amateur Competition, he was inspired to find a new piano teacher, to rebuild his repertoire, and to perform again. When he is not playing, Dr. Finlow enjoys running marathons, delving into theories of cosmology and quantum physics, playing Gran Turismo on PlayStation, and helping his wife maintain a delicate peace between their 14-year-old twins.\n\nProgram:\n\nCHOPIN, Fantaisie in F Minor, op. 49\n\nPROKOFIEV, Sonata No. 7 in B-flat Major, op. 83: III.
