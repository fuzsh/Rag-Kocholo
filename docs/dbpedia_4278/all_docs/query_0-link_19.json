        "text": "For a list of office holders Pre-Confederation, also known as the Chief Justiciar, see Chief Justiciar of Prussia.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Kingdom of Prussia is the elected head of government of the Kingdom of Prussia, who serves as the primary minister of the Crown. Officially, the Chancellor is appointed by the King's Lieutenant General, though the Chancellor is selected by his party having confidence of the House of Commons.\n\nSince the founding of the office in 1653, 65 people have held the office. The first elected leader, Diethelm Uslar, was elected in 1653 and served until 1662. The current Chancellor, Sir Alexander R. Friedmann, was elected in the 2113 General Election.\n\nEarly in the proceeding of the house, the King's Lieutenant, on advise of the Chancellor decided at what point they will dissolve the house for the next election, though each session of parliament lasted anywhere from four to six years. As well, anytime of year could be used as a start date for parliament. It wasn't until Chancellor Reimer Meeklenburg called for an election in December of 1675 that the start date of 04 January was first decided. Meeklenburg's successor, Chancellor Eginhard Aulock enacted the Act to Update the Elections Act of 1652, 1676, which helped to solidify more aspects of the country's election process. Term years still ranged from five to six years, but the parliament must always close session in Mid-November once the election actually takes place. The newly elected parliament will resume session on 04 January of the following year. This law was later dismantled and upgraded by Chancellor Waldemar Severloh in 1819 after the death of his predecessor, Egbert Kemnade. Chancellor Kemnade had held the office for 25 years, being reelected for 5 consecutive terms. Severloh wanted to have the number of terms a Chancellor could be elected to limited at 3. This was mostly successful throughout the following years. The current opening date of 15 November was enacted by Chancellor Gunnar Schaten in 1860, when his government enacted An Act to Modernize the Elections Act of 1676, 1860. The Chancellor was still limited to 3 consecutive terms, though the convention was 2. Each new session of parliament would open on the 15th of November, and generally close Mid-October 4 years later. The last Chancellor to be elected to three consecutive terms was Conservative Chancellor Walter Schulze (2021 - 2033). It was his successor, Herrmann Lange, who's government enacted the current version of the Elections Act through passing of the Act to Amend the Elections Act of 1860, 2033.\n\nList of Former Living Chancellors[]\n\nThis table lists former Chancellors of Prussia who are still alive as of December 2121.\n\nChancellor Date of Birth Age Term Chancellery Marcus Friedmann 18 May 2029 88 59 2073 - 2081 Reinhelde Dresner 03 May 2041 76 62 2093 - 2101 Malthe Schwab 22 September 2058 59 63 2101 - 2105 Wilhelm von Neudorf 27 February 2039 78 64 2105 - 2113 Alexander R Friedmann 13 January 2055 67 65 2113 - 2121\n\nChancellors of the Kingdom of Prussia[]"
