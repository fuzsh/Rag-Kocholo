        "text": "In summer 1866 the Austro-Prussian struggle for supremacy in Germany erupted into open conflict. King Georg V of Hanover sided with other governments loyal to the German Confederation against Prussia, but after initially defeating Prussian forces at Langensalza, he was forced to capitulate. Two days after the battle, on June 29, 1866, the widow of the Hanoverian general Sir Georg Julius von Hartmann told her daughter in no uncertain terms how she felt about the Prussian government and its allies. In her opinion they were nothing more than “robber states” that cloaked their disregard for the Ten Commandments in sanctimonious public displays of piety. “These Protestant Jesuits,” she continued, “offend me more than the Catholic ones. You know that I am German with all my heart and love my Germany, but I cannot consider them genuine Germans anymore because they only want to make Germany Prussian.”\n\n6 Blom, Ida, “Gender and Nation in International Comparison,” in Gendered Nations: Nationalisms and Gender Order in the Long Nineteenth Century, ed.

Smith points out in his review of Quataert's Staging Philanthrophy, “The separate, if sometime cooperating, worlds of Catholic and Jewish philanthropy suggest that the confessional, indeed Protestant, coding of the philanthropic work of the women's organizations was stronger than Quataert supposes.” The Jewish presence in Hanoverian nursing was negligible, but the present article suggests that even the Protestant “coding” was far from unambiguous.

There is some debate concerning periodization, but agreement exists that the religious revival was in full swing by the 1850s. Cf.

In 1869 he relinquished his position as chaplain at the Henriettenstift. Uhlhorn, Friedrich, Gerhard Uhlhorn, Abt zu Loccum.

In 1866 slightly less than half of the sisters were natural-born Hanoverians. The balance shifted somewhat in their favor later, adding up to an average ratio of six to four for the period 1852–1914.\n\n82 To be sure, Roger Chickering has shown persuasively that sometimes “women who styled themselves patriots attempted to broaden the purview of their public roles in a way which brought them in conflict with male patriots,” but the Patriotic Women's Association on the whole subscribed to thoroughly traditional gender roles—just like the Diakonie. Chickering, Roger, “‘Casting their Gaze More Broadly’: Women's Patriotic Activism in Imperial Germany,” Past and Present 118 (1988): 160, 163CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n122 A very revealing indication of Hanoverian charities' convergence of political views by 1918 is the fact that both the chroniclers of the Frederica Association and the Clementinenhaus referred to the end of the war as a “shock” (in German, Erschütterung and erschütternde Ereignisse, respectively).
