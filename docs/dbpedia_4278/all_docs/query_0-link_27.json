In the century that follows it becomes one of the primary modes of music-making. By the time German song comes to its presumed conclusion with Richard Strauss’s 1948 Vier letzte Lieder, this rich repertory has moved beyond the home and keyboard accompaniment to the symphony hall. This is the first introductory chronicle of this fascinating genre. In essays by eminent scholars, this Companion places the Lied in its full context – at once musical, literary, and cultural – with chapters devoted to focal composers as well as important issues, such as the way in which the Lied influenced other musical genres, its use as a musical commodity, and issues of performance. The volume is framed by a detailed chronology of German music and poetry from the late 1730s to the present and also contains a wide-ranging guide to suggested further reading.\n\nCambridge Companions to Music\n\nTopics\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Blues and Gospel Music\n\nEdited by Allan Moore\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Conducting\n\nEdited by José Antonio Bowen\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Grand Opera\n\nEdited by David Charlton\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Jazz\n\nEdited by Mervyn Cooke and David Horn\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Lied\n\nEdited by James Parsons\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Musical\n\nEdited by William Everett and Paul Laird\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Orchestra\n\nEdited by Colin Lawson\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock\n\nEdited by Simon Frith, Will Straw and John Street\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet\n\nEdited by Robin Stowell\n\nComposers\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Bach\n\nEdited by John Butt\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Bartók\n\nEdited by Amanda Bayley\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Beethoven\n\nEdited by Glenn Stanley\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Berg\n\nEdited by Anthony Pople\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Berlioz\n\nEdited by Peter Bloom\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Brahms\n\nEdited by Michael Musgrave\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Benjamin Britten\n\nEdited by Mervyn Cooke\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Bruckner\n\nEdited by John Williamson\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to John Cage\n\nEdited by David Nicholls\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Chopin\n\nEdited by Jim Samson\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Debussy\n\nEdited by Simon Trezise\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Handel\n\nEdited by Donald Burrows\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Mozart\n\nEdited by Simon P.

The Songmakers’ Almanac – Twenty Years of Song Recitals in London (Thames Publishing, 1996) tells the story of the ground-breaking series of concerts which established his reputation. His complete set of Schubert Lieder for Hyperion on thirty-seven discs includes contributors from (among many others) Elly Ameling, Janet Baker, Ian Bostridge, Brigitte Fassbaender, Matthias Goerne, Thomas Hampson, Felicity Lott, Ann Murray, Peter Schreier, and Christine Schäfer.

His publications include Mahler’s Fourth Symphony, in the series Studies in Musical Genesis and Structure published by Oxford University Press, as well as articles and reviews in the Journal of the American Musicological Society, Notes, and the Journal of Musicology. He is the editor of the two-volume critical edition of Mahler’s score for Weber’s opera Die drei Pintos, published recently in the series of Recent Researches in the Music of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries (A-R Editions, 2000) and given its first performance at Lincoln Center in 2002. Articles on Mahler and Strauss are forthcoming in several collections of essays devoted to those composers.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance and encouragement of many friends and colleagues during the planning and preparation of this volume. Above all, I am indebted to my contributors, none of whom grumbled even once (or at least not to me) when I allowed my attention to be diverted from this project by others. Working with all of the authors whose work appears in this book has been one of the highpoints of my professional career. From the start, Susan Youens was unstinting in her help, sagacious counsel, and formidable knowledge of the German art song. At Cambridge University Press, Victoria Cooper provided equal amounts of patience and unfailing good faith: every editor of a collection of essays should be so lucky. Nikki Burton, also at the press, cheerfully responded to an endless array of questions. Paul Watt, production editor, was a gracious guiding spirit once the volume went to press; I owe him much. I am grateful to Christopher Gibbs, Rufus Hallmark, Glenn Stanley, Susan Youens, and Neal Zaslaw for helping to identify potential contributors. For other kindnesses, I thank Tom Beghin, Mark Evan Bonds, Michael J. Budds, James S. Fritz, Denise Gallo, Duncan Large, and my dear friends in Springfield, Missouri, Michael Murray, and Joseph Schellhardt. If I have but one regret having to do with this volume, it is that Joe did not live to see it completed.\n\nMy own chapters benefited from discussions with and suggestions from Ruth Bingham, Deanna Bush, Denise Gallo, David Gramit, and my colleague at Southwest Missouri State University (in German studies) Carol Anne Costabile-Heming. I owe Michael Collins a special word of thanks as not only did he read numerous versions of my chapters, he also has been a source of support for more years than either of us would care to own up to: first as an inspiring teacher and, as of late, as a valued colleague, and always a friend. Research on my chapters was supported in part by a Study Visit Research Grant for Faculty from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (German Academic Exchange [DAAD]) and a Summer Faculty Fellowship from Southwest Missouri State University. This funding facilitated my first visit to Berlin and the Musikabteilung of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz and the Akademie der Künste zu Berlin; being able to work at both collections has been of enormous assistance. Friends made during my now three trips to Berlin likewise have been a source of support, above all Christiane Waskowiak and Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen. Also in Berlin, I am pleased to acknowledge the gracious help of Hermann Danuser, at Humboldt Universität, and Albrecht Riethmüller, at Freie Universität. Berlin is an exciting city right now; its extraordinary archives, amazing art museums, abundant music making, and always tempting restaurants provided a heady backdrop against which to formulate many of my thoughts on the Lied. I also thank the staffs of the Goethe and Schiller Archives and Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek, both in Weimar, where I was fortunate to engage in research during a lovely May visit in 2001.\n\nThanks also are due to Thomas Tietze at Bärenreiter-Verlag, who graciously granted permission to publish a modified version of Marie-Agnes Dittrich’s essay on Schubert, which first appeared in German in Schubert Handbuch, ed. Walther Dürr and Andreas Krause (Kassel and Stuttgart, 1997).\n\nLastly, I am grateful to my family – my mother, Patricia Parker; my brother and his wife, Randy and Brenda Parsons, their vivacious and adorable children, Sarah and Aaron; and my grandmother, Louise M. Vines – for a rare gift that has enriched my life as of late and, I can only hope, theirs too.\n\nThe Lied in context: a chronology\n\n1729 Johann Christoph Gottsched, Versuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor die Deutschen (dated 1730; 4th expanded edn. 1751), provides one of the earliest definitions of modern Lied: “nothing but an agreeable and clear reading of a verse, which consequently must match the nature and content of the words.” 1732 Joseph Haydn born. 1736 J.
