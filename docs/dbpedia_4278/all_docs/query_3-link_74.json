        "text": "Mother and daughter move to downtown Berlin near Potsdamer Platz in 1924. A childhood friend is the later composer and music director Heinz Struve (1925-2015), who wrote the autobiography Im Dschungel - zwischen Nazis und Stalinisten in 2013.\n\n1926 Beginning of lifelong friendship with Marie-Luise Krüger (née Bieder).\n\n___\n\nAfter Weimar democracy fended off attempts to overthrow it from the left and right, a period of relative political and economic stability followed in the years from 1924 to 1929. It is characterized by a variety of artistic, cultural and scientific achievements. However, the election of Paul von Hindenburg as Reich president in 1925 gives the anti-democratic forces the chance to implement a return to authoritarian conditions legally, with the aid of the presidential elements of the Reich constitution.\n\nThis period is characterized by a veritable explosion of art and culture, an ecstatic new attitude to life and new forms of mass culture. The starting point for the \"Roaring Twenties\" was the USA. Jazz music comes from there, and in 1927 the first sound film is made in the USA. Josephine Baker is the first African-American world star. On January 14, 1926, Baker performs in Berlin for the first time. Her dance performances, in which she mostly appears scantily clad, cause a great stir and result in bans on her appearances in Munich and Vienna, among other places.\n\nThe year 1929 marks the end of a period characterized by political stability and economic prosperity. As a result of \"Black Friday\" with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange, the Great Depression is triggered and increased foreign capital is withdrawn from Germany.\n\nOn September 14, 1930, the Reichstag elections are held. The NSDAP, which had played only a modest role for a long time, finally achieves considerable success in regional elections.\n\nThe year 1931 brings further successes for the NSDAP in all regional elections. The party now feels strong enough to seek an open exchange of blows with the traditional right.\n\nIn February 1932, the private efforts of the Austrian Adolf Hitler are successful. He is granted German citizenship. After the Reichstag elections, the NSDAP is the strongest faction for the first time. Changes of great magnitude are in the offing in Germany.\n\nOn January 30, 1933, Hitler became Reich Chancellor. As early as February 1, 1933, he dissolved the Reichstag and called new elections for March 5, the third Reichstag elections in seven months. Within a few months, his regime eliminates the separation of powers, pluralistic democracy, federalism and the rule of law with terror, emergency decrees, the Enabling Act, Gleichschaltung laws, bans on organizations and parties. Political opponents are imprisoned in concentration camps, tortured and murdered.\n\nIn 1934, Hitler had political opponents and potential rivals in his own ranks murdered in connection with the \"Röhm Putsch.\" He uses Hindenburg's death in August 1934 to have the office of Reich President combined with that of Reich Chancellor, and from then on he rules as Führer and Reich Chancellor.\n\nMovie\n\n1935 Moves to Berlin-Karlshorst. Student at the Karlshorst Lyceum (from 1938 Marie-von-Ebner-Eschenbach School). She graduates with the \"Einjährige\" (Mittlere Reife).\n\nIn 1936 during the Olympic Games in Berlin she had to perform gymnastic exercises on the Maifeld together with her fellow students. She was deeply impressed by the outstanding victories of the US athlete Jesse Owens.\n\n1939 Attended Emmy Stalmann's Private Art School of the West at Kantstrasse 154 A in Berlin-Charlottenburg (until 1941).\n\nHans Scholz (1911-1988) has been teaching at the art school since 1937, succeeding Gerhard Ulrich (1903-1988). She had a long friendship with him. In 1955 he published the successful novel Am grünen Strand der Spree (On the Green Beach of the Spree), the film version of which became a hit when it was broadcast on television in 1960 and alluded to Ruth Baumgarte's life, among other things.\n\nIn 1939, she moved with her mother to Rheingoldstraße 32 in Berlin-Karlshorst, where she also frequently met her aunt Anna-Marie Schubert and her adopted son Dieter.\n\n___\n\nSince 1935, jazz music is no longer allowed to be played on German radio. The so-called Führer Principle and the new German Municipal Code eliminate the last remnants of democracy at the municipal level as well. The Wehrmacht is built up and general conscription for the rearmament of the German armed forces becomes legal again.\n\nThe \"Nuremberg Laws\", which distinguish the German master race from all lower \"elements\", are the height of contempt for humanity.\n\nGermany goes down a path that is geared toward dictatorial power.\n\nFrom August 1 to 16, 1936, the XI Olympic Games are held in Berlin.\n\nThe civil war continues to rage in Spain in 1937. The German aircraft squadron \"Legion Condor\" destroys the Basque city of Guernica in an air raid.\n\nThe traveling exhibition \"Degenerate Art\" presents works by renowned painters to show the people how art should not be.\n\nThe state visit of the Italian dictator Mussolini to Germany becomes a propaganda event of enormous proportions. Hitler and Mussolini want to support their comrade-in-arms Franco in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn 1938, Austria is annexed by the German Reich. Some 65,000 German Wehrmacht soldiers march into the neighboring country. The heavily armed Nazi troops are greeted with jubilation. The people of the Sudetenland are also enthusiastic when the German Wehrmacht marches in in October. This invasion was legalized by the \"Munich Agreement\".\n\nThe horrible machinations of the Nazis in the German Reich find another climax in the Reich Pogrom Night. The destruction of stores, Jewish institutions and synagogues makes the night of November 9-10 the so-called \"Reichskristallnacht\".\n\nOn September 1, 1939, the invasion of Poland follows, marking the beginning of World War II.\n\nIn 1940, the Second World War dominates everyday life in Germany. The population is largely carried away by Adolf Hitler's plans for conquest. Reports of victory never cease, causing a questionable frenzy of joy, while new concentration camps are built in Germany.\n\nItalian dictator Mussolini and German leader Hitler agree on an alliance against Britain and France. Denmark and Norway are occupied by German troops and in the West the blitzkrieg against France begins. In May, the first German bombs have already destroyed Rotterdam in the Netherlands. German air raids open the war against Great Britain and in Warsaw all 400,000 Jews still alive were locked up in a ghetto.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., one of the most courageous film satires of the time premieres - \"The Great Dictator,\" starring Charlie Chaplin in the title role.\n\nShe meets her fellow student Annemarie Stübler (née Kranz), whom she portrays several times. Stübler lives in the GDR after the war. Both remain in close contact.\n\nShe spends the summer of 1943 with the Reich Labor Service near Lauenburg, Pomerania (today: Lębork/Poland), cutting peat. Later she will describe this time as \"decidedly enriching.\"\n\nShe marries fellow student Eduard Alfred Gustav Busse (1914-2003) from Bielefeld, who has to return to the front immediately after the marriage.\n\n___\n\nAfter ten days of deliberation, the Western Allies announce the official war aims to the press for the first time: \"Unconditional surrender of Germany, Italy and Japan\". They also decide to step up air raids on German cities.\n\nAt the end of January, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus surrenders with the German units trapped in the Southern Cauldron in the Battle of Stalingrad. German schoolchildren aged 15 and over are drafted into military service as flak helpers. In February, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels calls for \"total war\" in a speech at the Berlin Sports Palace.\n\nSophie and Hans Scholl as well as their friend Christoph Probst are sentenced to death by guillotine in February by the People's Court under the \"blood judge\" Roland Freisler as members of the resistance group White Rose for \"decomposition of military strength\", \"favoring the enemy\" and \"preparation for high treason\".\n\nOn the night of March 1 to 2, the first major air raid on Berlin takes place.\n\nIn April, the Warsaw Ghetto uprising begins.\n\nIn November, the air battle for Berlin begins.\n\nRuth Baumgarte discovered early on that portraiture was the ideal pictorial genre for gaining a differentiated image of herself and other people. From 1944-45 she created an impressive portrait cycle of young and old men who had been called up for the Volkssturm.\n\nAs a result of the evacuation of the Staatliche Hochschule in Berlin, she transfers for five months to study at the Staatliche Industrie- und Kunstgewerbeschule Sonneberg in Thuringia.\n\nShe applies for a place at the Dresden State Art College, Department of Painting and Sculpture. Because only war-disabled persons are admitted, she receives a rejection. She returns to Berlin.\n\n___\n\nAt the end of January, the Red Army liberates Leningrad, a city encircled by the Wehrmacht.\n\nOn June 6, the Allied forces of the anti-Hitler coalition land in Normandy on D-Day.\n\nOn July 20, the assassination attempt on Hitler by Stauffenberg and others fails.\n\nIn August, Joseph Goebbels decrees the \"total wartime deployment of cultural workers.\" When it comes into effect on September 1, this results in the closure of almost all German and Austrian theaters and cultural institutions. Artists who are not on the so-called Gottbegnadeten list are also called up for so-called \"war-important activities\".\n\nOn September 11, American units cross the German Reich border northwest of Trier. In October, the Red Army reaches the German border in East Prussia.\n\nOn February 3, it experienced the worst air raid on Berlin. On May 8, the surrender takes place. Berlin-Karlshorst becomes a restricted area by the Soviet army. She works briefly as a press artist for the Berliner Zeitung, published by the Soviet occupying forces. With a special permit, she is able to save part of her work from her apartment at Rheingoldstrasse 32 in just a few hours. She moves to Berlin-Lichtenrade.\n\nMeets the physician Dr. Fritz Kohs, whose type is recognizable again and again in several of her compositions. A long lasting friendship develops.\n\nIn Lichtenrade she takes over the management of a youth center founded by the Soviet occupation forces (later Lortzingclub) and from July works as a drawing teacher at the Ulrich-von-Hutten-Gymnasium in Lichtenrade. She produces her first watercolor drawings, including Boys' Portraits and Studio Corner (Evening).\n\n___\n\nThe liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp by the Red Army takes place on January 27.\n\nThe old city of Dresden is largely destroyed in air raids by the Royal Air Force and US Air Force from February 13-15, 1945, just a few months before the end of World War II. Some 25,000 people die.\n\nGermany surrenders at Reims and Karlshorst on May 8 and 9.\n\nBirth of son Thomas Christian Busse.\n\nStart of her career as an illustrator, graphic artist and freelance painter. She creates illustrations for newspapers and magazines such as the left-leaning Freie Presse (1949-1953) and Magazin der Hausfrau (1949-1954). She designs a number of children's and youth books, as well as fiction, such as works by Alfred Döblin and Oscar Wilde.\n\nConnection with the Bielefeld booksellers Erich Vogel (1906-1956) and Otto Fischer (1907-1995) as well as the lawyer Albert Daltrop (1886-1977), who returned from the concentration camp Theresienstadt.\n\nFirst public exhibition participation with ink drawings at the exhibition Deutsches Buchschaffen in Bielefeld. She joins the Landesberufsverband Bildender Künstler Nordrhein-Westfalen and participates in numerous group exhibitions until 1952.\n\n___\n\nIn the extremely cold hunger winter of 1946/47, which was accompanied by a cold spell, there was a shortage of food, heating material and much else.\n\nIn the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ), the development toward a transformation of society also continues. The communist-oriented SED is the dominant force in the country. In 1947, an important course is also set in the economic field; for example, the German Economic Commission is established, which centrally controls economic life in the SBZ from East Berlin. In the meantime, economic life in Germany's western zones was being rebuilt on a capitalist basis, making a unified economic policy for Germany increasingly impossible. Offers by the U.S. to use Marshall Plan aid to support Eastern European states and the SBZ are interpreted by the Soviet Union as Western propaganda.\n\nThe summer becomes extremely hot (summer of the century); there are crop failures. Many people die from malnutrition and contagious diseases.\n\nAnother very cold winter in 1947/48 further aggravates the situation of the people.\n\nIn the years 1947 to 1948 she is heavily involved in the cultural and theater scene. The actor Hans Wintrath (1905-1965) becomes her most important companion and later a close friend, godfather to her son Thomas and the Baumgarte family.\n\nShe met the Swedish entrepreneur Carl Erik Pihl (1914-1970) and traveled with him to Paris, among other places. The two became lifelong friends.\n\nShe has a brief relationship with the stage designer Johann Wenzel Minarik (1925-1999), who later works at the Munich State Opera, among other places.\n\nShe meets the entrepreneur Hans Baumgarte at his own exhibition of children's portraits and portrays his two sons from his first marriage.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1953 she travels to Lake Constance several times with Hans Baumgarte.\n\n___\n\nIn 1948, the announced Marshall Plan comes into effect in the western zones of Germany. The USA provides $550 million in the form of loans and raw materials.\n\nThe Soviet Union lays claim to the entire city of Berlin, in which it had hitherto administered only one occupation zone. When the currency reform is implemented by the Western Allies that year, which applies exclusively to the western zones and the western sectors of Berlin, a blockade is set up by the Soviet occupation forces to prevent the supply of West Berlin via highways and waterways.\n\nFrom then on, the Allies supply the city from the air. The Berlin blockade is an act of solidarity and at the same time a fierce power struggle in the Cold War. By the end of the year, 100,000 planes reach West Berlin.\n\nIn 1949, there is no longer any hope for a unified Germany. On May 23, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded, and on October 7, the GDR came into being. The West does not recognize the founding of the GDR as a state. Two states on German soil are not in the sense of the people and also not of the western politics. The founding of the Federal Republic is disapproved of by the Soviet Union because it violates existing treaties. The founding of the GDR, in turn, is a thorn in the side of the Western Allies.\n\nMany people move from East to West because they find better living conditions in the West. Apart from the political circumstances, the Germans on both sides are still busy trying to eliminate the consequences of the war, renew the infrastructure and hope for the relatives still in captivity.\n\nIn 1950, the two German states were increasingly drifting apart economically and politically. Konrad Adenauer had held the office of Chancellor since 1949. In West Germany, the economy was quickly able to report successes, including the abolition of the last ration cards. While an era of Heimatfilme dawned in West Germany, the Ministry for State Security was founded in the GDR.\n\nIn 1951, the first post-war Richard Wagner Festival was held in Bayreuth. In terms of culture, the country experiences a shock at the beginning of the year. Hildegard Knef, the protagonist in the film \"Die Sünderin\" (The Sinner) enrages the public and thus begins her international career.\n\nIn the course of time, the Federal Republic is able to detach itself more and more from the dependence of the Western Allies. Denazification is primarily carried out by the American side. The West German judiciary, on the other hand, gradually punishes the crimes of Nazi perpetrators by granting amnesties. Almost 800,000 people involved in the machinations of the Nazi regime thus escape their full punishment.\n\nMovie\n\nMarriage to the industrialist Hans Baumgarte (1917-1999). The marriage produced children Janine and later Alexander. The patchwork family also includes the children from the first marriages: Thomas, Ernst-August and Hans-Herrmann.\n\nTheir honeymoon takes them to the Olympic Games in Helsinki and throughout Scandinavia.\n\nA period of intensive travel begins, including trips throughout Europe, stays of several weeks in Spain and Italy. Numerous trips to many major international cities, again and again to Berlin.\n\nCreates travel paintings such as the watercolors Finnish Impression (1952), View of Mount Vesuvius (1955) and Istanbul (1960).\n\nCommissioned by Eisenwerke Baumgarte, she creates calendar illustrations (until 1969) that lead to the work cycle Fabrikwelten, which she realizes together with the graphic artist Werner Kuhnert, a friend from Bielefeld.\n\nIn 1952, she designs the cover for the opening program of the Apollo Theater in Düsseldorf, which is managed by her father for UFA.\n\nFurther commissions for the private sector, including for the Dr. Oetker company.\n\n___\n\nThe year is marked by the ongoing Korean War. In Europe, the Montan Union lays the foundation for what will later become the European Community, further integrating the Federal Republic into Western Europe.\n\nAt the end of May, the GDR begins to establish a five-kilometer-wide exclusion zone along the demarcation line to the Federal Republic of Germany. This marks the start of the forced resettlement of over 12,000 residents. Telephone lines between West Berlin and the GDR are cut. West Berliners are now only allowed to enter the GDR with permission.\n\nIn June, the Defiance Campaign against apartheid in the South African Union begins. Demonstrations have already taken place on April 6. Participants in the campaign deliberately violate apartheid laws, such as the ban on Whites using facilities and the requirement to carry passports. The idea is to get arrested for breaking the laws, so that prisons become overcrowded, crippling the justice system. The unexpectedly large number of nonviolent civil disobedience activities in the course of this campaign puts the South African government in a difficult position, both politically and tactically, since it is very difficult to take action against civilians with no potential for violence by police means. Although thousands of actors will be arrested in the coming months, the campaign will not abate.\n\nThe XV Summer Olympics are held in Helsinki, Finland, from July 19 to August 3. In November, U.S. nuclear physicists detonate the first hydrogen bomb on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor social reasons, her husband forbids her to do illustration work for the politically left-wing Freie Presse.\n\nIn the years 1954 to 1961 she creates numerous portraits, still lifes and theater illustrations.\n\nIn 1956 Kurt Rupli, Ruth's father, brings the opera Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin to the Apollo Theater in Düsseldorf during a world tour.\n\nFirst international exhibitions: Galeria Machico, Estoril / Portugal (1954), Galleries Dr. Khalili, Tehran / Iran (1957), Circolo Nautico, Alessio / Italy (1961).\n\nFrom the mid-fifties annual stays on Sylt. In 1956 she traveled for the first time to Iran, further trips took her to Italy, the Canary Islands and Turkey.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1959 first trip to Johannesburg / South Africa and Egypt.\n\n___\n\nIn 1953, with the death of Joseph Stalin, the process of de-Stalinization begins in the USSR. His successor, Khrushchev, opted for a course of détente in view of the nuclear stalemate and massive domestic political problems. Meanwhile, political and economic problems in the GDR erupted in the June 17, 1953 uprising.\n\nIn 1954, Otto John, the president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, causes a scandal in the Federal Republic by going underground in the GDR. In the USA, the McCarthy era reaches its climax with the Communist Control Act of 1954.\n\nIn 1955, the period of occupation ends in Austria, the GDR and the Federal Republic; at the same time, the two German states are firmly integrated into their blocs with the founding of the Warsaw Pact and admission to NATO, respectively. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, on his trip to Moscow, achieves the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the return home of the last German prisoners of war.\n\nIn Montgomery, Alabama, African American Rosa Parks is arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus for a white male passenger. The ensuing \"Montgomery Bus Boycott\" becomes the birth of the black civil rights movement in the USA.\n\nIn 1956, Nikita Khrushchev initiates de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union. The demonstrations in Tbilisi, the Poznan Uprising and the Hungarian Uprising are all bloodily put down as a result of Soviet control of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nThe three North African states of Morocco, Tunisia and Sudan gain their independence. The rearmament of the two German states begins with the establishment of the Bundeswehr and the NVA.\n\nThe Sputnik satellite marks the beginning of the space age in 1957. At the same time, it is also an expression of the system competition between the USA and the Soviet Union, which is also reflected in the Eisenhower Doctrine. Meanwhile, the most important cornerstone of European unification is laid with the Treaties of Rome.\n\nIn 1958, the world economy experiences its first post-war recession. The Federal Republic, in the midst of the economic miracle, is only slightly affected. 1958 (or 1957) is regarded as the year in which a long crisis in the coal and steel industry begins in West Germany. In the Ruhr region, Germany's largest agglomeration with more than 10 million inhabitants, these crises become particularly visible. Worldwide, the movement for nuclear disarmament strengthens. In Germany, the \"fight atomic death\" movement emerges in parallel.\n\nIn 1959, the revolutionaries under Fidel Castro take power in Cuba after the escape of the dictator Batista. The superpowers USA and USSR engage in talks to weaken the confrontational course of the Cold War.\n\nAround 1960, further trips to Iran, including to Tehran, Ishafan and the Caspian Sea.\n\n1960 her father Kurt Rupli dies.\n\n1965 Death of close friend and actor Hans Wintrath.\n\n1966/67 she gets in touch with the cultural scene in Prague because of the work cycle Fabrikwelten. She is offered a teaching position at the Prague Art Academy.\n\nThe Baumgarte couple intends to separate. Ruth Baumgarte considers moving to Munich.\n\n1969 After a trip to Ireland, her mother Margarethe Kellner-Conrady dies unexpectedly.\n\n1970 Surprising death of Carl Erik Pihl.\n\nFrom 1970, her works show for the first time the sensitivity for social and environmental issues, e.g. in the works Meditation (1975) and Später Winter (1975).\n\n___\n\nIn 1960, 18 African colonies gain independence from their colonial powers.\n\nIn the same year, John F. Kennedy is elected the 35th President of the USA.\n\n1961 The conflict between the great powers hardens when the GDR state government begins building the Berlin Wall. Powerless, the citizens and visitors of Berlin have to watch as the sector border becomes insurmountable. Yuri Gagarin is the first man in space.\n\nIn 1962, the Cold War reaches a new climax with the Cuban Missile Crisis. The world public becomes aware of the danger of a global nuclear war.\n\n1963 Assassination of John F.
