On the other hand, the essays should give the reader-whether student, music lover, history buff, musician, scholar, museum goer, or would-be tourist eager to visit or revisit Vienna-the kind of background leading to an enriched view of Schubert and his older contemporary Beethoven, and of the ciry in which they resided. In the summer of 1993 at the Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University (New Brunswick), the authors and about fifry other scholars and musicians gathered to study for three intensive weeks the Vienna that Schubert knew, that Vienna over which reigned, from 1792 to r8o6, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis 11-who, because of historical circumstances explained in Chapter r, also ruled as Francis I, Emperor of Austria, from r8o4 to 1835. The gathering was the eleventh interdisciplinary academy sponsored since 1978 by the Aston Magna Foundation for Music and the Humanities. Funding came principally from the Division ofEducation of the National Endowment for the Humanities, with additional support from the Austrian Cultural Institute in New York Ciry. The Aston Magna Academies have as their purpose the fostering of intellectual exchange among humanities scholars of different disciplines and the development of mu-\n\ntual understanding between scholars and performing artists. Unlike many worthy programs that set out to enhance further the competency of professionals in their specialties, the Academy program has sought to provide leading-edge interpretations of basic knowledge in many fields that the participants know they need but-especially because of the high level of specialization in higher education today- have not had the opportunity to acquire. Appropriately then, those chosen as Academy faculty not only must have studied and reflected deeply upon their respective areas of research, but also must be willing to share their expertise to an eager but sophisticated audience from largely outside their own discipline. This book, in a similar spirit, offers essays intended for a broad, nonspecialist public by some of these same experts.\n\nX\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThere are many debts that the editor is happy to acknowledge. The contributors have been extraordinarily cooperative in shaping their essays to be logical and necessary pieces of a coordinated whole. I have also consulted them on some aspects of the illustration captions, for which I am nonetheless to be held responsible. The belief of the collaborators in the value of the Academy program and their collegial generosity are further evidenced by the fact that all have agreed that any royalties from this publication will go to support the educational activities of the Aston Magna Foundation. I have also benefited from the constructive contributions of many others: the anonymous outside reader for Yale University Press; my Queens College colleagues Rolf Kieser and Hermann Haller, who reviewed my translations from the German of Chapter 7 and the Afterword, and Rufus Hallmark, who suggested some readings for Chapter 9; Professor Kristina Muxfeldt of Yale University, Professor Enno Kraehe of the University of Virginia, and Catherine Gasper Jessup, whose observations have improved the opening chapter;John M. Gingerich, who was kind enough to send me a copy of his insightful 1996 Yale dissertation on Schubert; Rita Stehlin in Vienna, who generously shared with me unpublished information concerning a recently discovered Schubert archive; and Professor Paula Fichtner of Brooklyn College, to whom I have often turned, over many years, for precise information and thoughtful perspectives on various aspects ofHabsburg history and culture. Last, but hardly least, is the debt I owe to my wife, Carole DeSaram, who has sacrificed not a little so that this book might appear in the Schubert anniversary year. To reach its audience and accomplish its purpose, a book like this one requires generous visual documentation. Helping to underwrite the cost of the illustrations were Christopher H. Murray and Edwin McAmis, present and past members of the Aston Magna Foundation Board. Michael Spudic, a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of the City University ofNew York, assisted me early on with the picture research. The necessary burden of contacting and negotiating with more than twenty institutions or independent departments therein for visual materials was substantially lightened by the unfailingly helpful cooperation of the staffs of these institutions. In the first instances I must cite Claudia Oesterreicher, Adelbert Sussler, and Helmut Selzer of the Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien, the source of more than half of our\n\nillustrations, and Gerbert Frodl of the Osterreichische Galerie, who provided most of the color negatives and gave advice on a number of important matters. But I also wish to acknowledge specifically the following for their personal assistance (all in Vienna, except where noted): Eckart Vancsa (Bundesdenkmalamt), Otto Biba (Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde), Renata Antoniou (Graphische Samrnlung Albertina), Gottfried Mraz and Christiana Thomas (Hof-, Haus-, und Staatsarchiv), Robert Rill (Osterreichisches Staatsarchiv), Sandra Mikulczik (Kunsthistorisches Museum), Christian Witt-Dorring and Gabriele Fabiankowitsch (Museum der angewandten Ki.inste), Mary Doherty, Laurence Libin, and Stuart Pollens (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Charles Eubanks (New York Public Library), Franz Albrecht Graf Metternich-Sandor (SchloB Grafenegg), Elisabeth Wagner (Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Musiksamrnlung), Reinhard Strohm and Humaira Ahmed (Department of Music, Oxford University), Gwyneth Campling (Royal Collection Enterprises, Windsor Castle), Petra Schneider (Stiftung Weimarer Klassik, Weimar), and Otto Brusatti and Johann Ziegler (Wiener Stadt-und Landesbibliothek). I am also indebted to Director Wolfgang Waldner, Thomas Stelzer, Peter Mikl, and Friederike Zeitlhofer of the Austrian Cultural Institute in New York for their various contributions that have furthered this enterprise; moreover, the former deputy director of the Institute, Ernst Aichinger, now based in Vienna at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, arranged for the Institute's cosponsorship of the 1993 Aston Magna Academy and has actively supported this book project. Finally, I owe a debt of continuous gratitude to Aston Magna Executive Director Ronnie Boriskin and her assistant Florence Lynch for handling and facilitating various financial and legal transactions associated with this publication. Much of my writing, editing, and research associated with this book was facilitated by the resources and helpful staffs of several libraries near to home. In particular I would like to acknowledge the Rosenthal Library and Music Library at Queens College; the New York Public Library's Center for the Humanities (Fifth Avenue at 42d Street) and the Research Divisions of the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center; and the Thomas]. Watson Library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. During working vacations, I have always found myself welcome at the Old Forge (N.Y.) Library, nestled in the beauties of the Adirondack Mountains. It was my pleasure to work with Harry Haskell, music editor of Yale University Press, on a previous, unrelated book. It was he who made a compelling case that Yale University Press should publish this volume as the first of an anticipated series deriving from the Aston Magna Academies; his diplomatically expressed yet candid opinions and editorial judgment, not to say patience, have had no little influence on the overall shape of the present publication. Furthermore, I have enjoyed jousting verbally with the manuscript editor, Dan Heaton, whose sharp eye, mind, and wit have earned my deep respect and have even persuaded me to yield on some points of contention. In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary quality of the many program officers of the National Endowment for the Humanities with whom I have been\n\nxi Acknowledgments\n\nprivileged to work since 1976 on matters relating to the twelve Aston Magna Academies to date (a thirteenth has been funded for 1997). It was the early encouragement by Adrienne Gyongi to pursue what was then an unusual educational concept that led to the first Academy proposal in 1977. After that, Peter Patrikis, Charles Meyers and, for the last several Academies, Barbara Ashbrook, have overseen the projects from Washington, with Jean Hughes assuming this responsibility for 1997. In addition to reaching hundreds of college teachers and musicians throughout the nation and involving scholars and artists from abroad as well, the Academy program has also been able to reach out to the general public, thanks to funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities' Division of Public Programs, by means of over thirty multidisciplinary weekend programs presented all over the United States at museums and libraries; Malcolm Richardson and Wilsonia Cherry, both of whom have gone on to xii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nimportant positions elsewhere, served as NEH program officers for these undertakings. The nation owes all of these professionals, as well as their unnamed colleagues, a profound debt of gratitude for their understanding of how the study of the humanities enriches our culture and informs our citizenry. The Aston Magna Academy program has explicitly sought from the beginning to build bridges between diverse areas of learning, with a view to expanding knowledge and understanding of those roots of American culture found in Europe. It has also sought to foster an appreciation of how the arts and humanities generally, but differently, serve society by providing a conduit between the present and the past. This book is but one way in which the aspirations of that enterprise can be shared with the American public as well as with the larger English-reading citizenry of music and Vienna lovers the world over.\n\n•INTRODUCTION •\n\nOf all of Europe's major cities, Vienna has the image of being the most comfortable and among the most enchanting. Sachertorte, coffee with globs of whipped cream, a central historic district that can be easily traversed on foot, a New Year's celebration that is televised the world over-and above all, music, music, music. That is the image projected by the travel posters and other advertisements, and it is all true. It is not the whole truth, of course. There are also dark times to be reckoned with in Vienna's history, and it may come as a surprise to today's casual tourist or music lover to know that these include the periods in which Joseph Haydn (1732-1809), Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827), and Franz Schubert (1797-1828) lived there. This was an era of war and deprivation, of bombardment and occupation of the city by Napoleon's army, of the dissolution after a thousand years of the Holy Roman Empire, of political oppressiveness sufficiently great that it would lead to revolution in 1848. What is remarkable is the artistic and cultural vitality that can still be discovered under such circumstances. It was at this time that Vienna became Musikstadt WienEurope's great center of music, the many facets of which are delineated in Chapter 5 by Alice M. Hanson. Perhaps, as Waltraud Heindl suggests in Chapter 2, music was not as dangerous for the artist as painting or writing-even though public concert programs\n\nhad to pass the censor. Perhaps another contributing factor was that music provided family entertainment in a patriarchal and family-centered society. Whatever the reasons, it is almost as though music was seized upon not only for the sake of its own pleasures but as a means of escape in what was in fact a repressive (although not violent) police state ruled over, with good intentions, by Emperor Francis (r. 1792-r835), who was not a little influenced by his minister Clemens Metternich. The Moravian-born former Habsburg subject Charles Sealsfield (born Karl Postl), a liberal-thinking emigre to America who returned to gather information for a polemical book about Austria's authoritarian state, related in his Austria As It Is (London, r828) that music held a predominant position in Vienna-in the church (where it overpowered worship), in public concerts, and at home, especially on Sunday, when, Sealsfield wrote, \"from three o'clock till eleven the city is literally in a musical and senxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nsual uproar. Wherever you go, the sound of musical instruments will reach your ears.\" And yet the most important aspect of music is the legacy of two great composers, Beethoven and Schubert-the former the dominant musical personality of the age, and indeed the century, and the latter, unlike Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, a true Viennese. The last thirty years of Beethoven's life overlap with virtually the whole of Schubert's, yet they likely met but once and lived in different social spheres. A book about Beethoven's Vienna, therefore, would be somewhat different from this one. Schubert's Vienna was less the Vienna of imperial and high aristocratic activity than that of the so-called Biedermeier milieu of the middle class, which in this book is described in social terms by Waltraud Heindl and in visual terms by Gerbert Frodl (Chapter 8). Schubert, who adopted a modest, more or less bohemian lifestyle, did not demand as much of Vienna as Beethoven did, so he did not receive as much. During his lifetime there was only one major concert devoted solely to his music, none of his symphonies were publicly performed or published, and his many operas went mostly unperformed. Still, as Ernst Hilmar points out in the Afterword, Schubert was hardly unknown in Vienna, nor as poor as the popular literature would like to paint him. Moreover, while it is fruitless to speculate how Schubert's career might have developed had he lived longer, the evidence suggests that he was on the verge of a major leap forward into public consciousness and that, in any case, the output of his thirty-one years is in many ways more impressive than that of the first three decades or so of Beethoven's life. Whereas the (mostly eighteenth-century) palaces of the great were frequented by Beethoven, the most characteristic new architecture of Schubert's Vienna, as explained by Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann in Chapter 7, was embodied in utilitarian and functional buildings aimed at the general welfare-apartment complexes, institutions of research and higher learning, parks with their coffeehouses. This represented the resumption of the imperial public works policy of the reform-minded Joseph II (r. 1780-90) by Joseph's nephew Francis, whose reign covers the whole of Beethoven's Vienna period and Schubert's entire life.\n\nSchubert had, of course, a few noble friends and patrons who lived in grand palaces, but his circle consisted mainly of artists, writers, and bureaucrats. Thus a volume like this must treat the various arts of the time and Schubert's relation to them. The composer's attitude toward poetry, painting, theater, and the dance is of more importance to understanding Schubert the man and artist than it is for the antisocial and iconoclastic Beethoven, who came to embody Kant's description of a genius as someone who gives rules to art, hence someone operating almost independent of society. Whereas Beethoven provided the romantic model of the artist seemingly existing in an empyreal realm, Schubert, dying as he did at age thirty-one-an age at which Beethoven was still in his \"early\" period-had no chance to be seen in that light. In fact, his contemporaries saw him as existing on the margins of human society, not above it or in control of it-and this is not so different from Mozart, who was also fated to die young. Thus Franz Grillparzer, arguably Austria's greatest dramatist, could write an epitaph for Schubert decrying the loss of talent unfulfilled. That said, we must also recognize that Schubert lived a life that put him in touch with a remarkable number of important cultural currents, events, places, and personalities of his time, as the illustrations in this volume help to document. He had the advantage, as an imperial choirboy, of a first-class education and the connections that came with it. He loved the theater, which, as Simon Williams shows us in Chapter ro, was experiencing a golden age, and he knew many important people in the Viennese theater world besides Grillparzer. Moreover, his many operas, also freshly assessed by Williams, are distinctly Viennese in their style and content. Some of his close artist friends (Leopold Kupelwieser, Moritz von Schwind), as well as some only peripherally associated with him (Joseph Danhauser,Johann Nepomuk Hoechle,Joseph Kriehuber, and Ferdinand Waldmuller), turned out to be among the more important Austrian painters of the nineteenth century. His huge volume of danceable dance music (not to mention his frequent improvising of same) is evidence that it was not only during the Congress of Vienna -whose importance not only for Schubert's Vienna but for all Europe is conveyed by Enno Kraehe in Chapter 3 -that the city waltzed, although, as Elizabeth Aldrich explains in Chapter 6, the Viennese waltz at this time is not quite what we think of today. But there are other, less tangible factors in Schubert's world to be considered, such as the intellectual and aesthetic currents that coursed through Europe in the later eighteenth century-the results of such diverse factors as the discovery oflava-encrusted Pompeii and Herculaneum, the writings of Rousseau, the French Revolution (and its attempt to emulate republican Rome), and a growing fascination with the Middle Ages-not to mention the singularly powerful impact, especially in the Germanspeaking world, ofJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (Schubert's favorite poet, as we learn from Jane K. Brown in Chapter 9). Measuring the direct and indirect impact of these and other forces on Schubert and on the arts of his time provides useful means of assessing them in both their Viennese and European contexts.\n\nXV\n\nIntroduction\n\nXVI\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt follows, therefore, that several chapters in this book consider the meaning(s) of terms like classicism, neoclassicism, romanticism, sensibility, and Biedermeier. Some of these were used at the time in very specific contexts (classical and romantic, for example, in a series of important lectures on literature delivered in Vienna in r8o8 by August Wilhelm Schlegel, brother of the politically active Friedrich Schlegel). Others, like neoclassicism and Biedermeier, have been applied retroactively to a particular style or milieu. All these terms are common parlance, yet a reading of the essays by Jane K. Brown, Gerbert Frodl, Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, and Leon Plantinga will reveal something important: that the arts do not necessarily move in concert, that the same term can have quite different connotations when applied to different arts, and therefore that different arts often cannot even be profitably compared with one another. By treating the arts in their own terms and not attempting to find facile comparisons among them, however, these essays clarify for us both the origins of style-critical terms and the limits of their use. Thus, we see that classicism, which was understood to imply emulation of antiquity, can be reasonably applied to architecture and the fine arts and even to poetry and literature, because there are antique models to be imitated, but that it is hard to justify the term when speaking of music. Likewise, romantic, understood in an aesthetic sense, was common from the early years of the nineteenth century, yet was used differently for music and literature and has never really caught on as a meaningful style designation for architecture. Moreover, although music appreciation students typically learn that the \"classic\" period of Haydn, Mozart, and at least some of Beethoven was succeeded by the \"romantic\" nineteenth century, Plantinga argues in Chapter 4 instead for a single classicromantic period (c. 1750-I900) that has coexisting \"classic\" and \"romantic\" style traits; this position enables us to recognize and accept both of these tendencies in the music of Schubert (and other composers, too).\n\nSchubert's Vienna is thus to be seen as a time and place conditioned by concrete historical events and ethereal, artistic sensibilities. To convey some of these and their relationship to Schubert the man and artist is the purpose of this book.\n\n• SOURCES\n\nBDA GNM\n\nGdMf GSA\n\nHHSa HM\n\nKHM\n\nMAK\n\nMMA\n\nMS\n\nOF\n\nILLUSTRATIONS•\n\nBundesdenkmalamt, Vienna Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg Archive, Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna Haus-, Hof-, und Staatsarchiv, Vienna Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien, Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna Museum der angewandten Kiinste, Vienna Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Franz Albrecht Metternich-\n\nNYPL:\n\nAvery\n\nNYPL:\n\nDance\n\nNYPL:\n\nMusic\n\nSandor, SchloB Grafenegg, Haitzendorf S.

The Schubert family home at Saulengasse ro sported a banner hailing \"The Best of Emperors.\" I The Viennese had enthusiastically welcomed him home before-even in r809, following the disastrous defeat that resulted in the Treaty ofPressburg. But this time he was the victor, the victor over that once-seemingly invincible colossus that had been on everyone's mind and lips for almost twenty years: Napoleon Bonaparte. Francis l's arrival was, in fact, but one of several grand monarchical entrees that were to entertain the Viennese in r8I4, when the leaders of all Europe gathered in Vienna at a great Congress to decide just what to do with Europe in the post-Napoleonic era (see chapter 3). The Congress ofVienna, lasting from September r8I4 to June r8I5, provides a convenient dividing point within Francis's reign. From his accession as head of the Habsburg dynasty and election as Holy Roman Emperor in I792 until I8I5, his capital and empire were threatened by the ideas and ideals of the French Revolution and the military might of Napoleon's armies. But after r8r5 until his death in 1835, Francis's reign was blessed by the absence of major European wars, due in great part to the diplomatic\n\nachievements ofPrince Clemens Metternich, the preeminent minister at the emperor's side (see fig. 3.4). It was during this latter period also that virtually the whole of Franz Schubert's musical legacy was created (see plate 2). Francis was born in February I768 in Florence, the oldest son of Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Benign and enlightened, the father was fated to reign as Emperor Leopold II for only two years. He had succeeded his childless brother Joseph II, a brilliant man, whose ten-year reign from 1780 to r7oo had attempted too many Enlightenment reforms too fast for the population to digest. Leopold also inherited from Joseph a war with the Turks and the revolution in France, the latter threatening their sister, Queen Marie Antoinette. Leopold thus had his hands full-too full. It is likely that his death in I792 was at least partly due to overwork while trying to solve these and other serious problems. 4 Erickson\n\nBut suddenly, on March I, I792, all the unsolved problems fell to the twenty-fouryear-old Francis, who, conscious of his youth, felt overwhelmed and inadequate. The future looked terribly grim and threatening to young Francis, yet he had the benefit of the education and training arranged by his father and then by his uncle in Vienna. As a boy in Florence, Francis had learned intimately the geography of the widely scattered Habsburg possessions and became fascinated by history and the lessons derived from it. He had acquired fluency in what his father termed \"essential languages\": Italian, French, German, and Latin, and later he would master Viennese dialect, to the delight of the denizens of the capital city. In fact, despite the international use of French at courts and in diplomacy, and even among the noble and polite society in Vienna, Francis as emperor preferred German, the language his father had termed \"the most difficult.\" Among other subjects Francis had studied were philosophy, physics, astronomy, chemistry, botany, and anatomy. Perhaps more important to Leopold, however, was that Francis be inculcated with an Enlightenment view of the responsibility of a monarch: \"The princes must, above all, be convinced of the equality of man .... They should be made to realize ... that their entire existence must ever be subordinate to their duties. They must regard it as their highest duty to listen and to comfort .... They must understand that one may never receive individuals in a bored, disdainful, distracted, ill-humored, or choleric manner; that one must give one's full attention to such persons, whatever their station.\"2 That Francis the monarch absorbed at least some of these principles is evident by his behavior at the later Friday public audiences he held (fig. r.r). Two hundred to three hundred petitioners, gathered in the designated anteroom in the imperial residence, the Hofburg, had come the preceding Monday to obtain a number guaranteeing a place on line that Friday, the numbers being issued in order of application, regardless of station. One chronicler described the crowd as 'all kinds of people, in rags and in riches, as the case happened to be. Mingling with the refined odors of perfumed elegance were the rarnlike stench ofbefurred shepherds and the peculiar poverty smell\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\nr.r Schubert's entire life (1797-1828) was played out within the reign of Francis I (r.

[HMJ\n\nof the needy.\" 3 Entering in groups of twenty-five or so and spaced around the room to preclude eavesdropping, the petitioners were approached in turn by their simply dressed monarch, accompanied by a secretary. Francis politely listened to each plea and answered in the petitioner's own language; each petition was duly noted, and many were granted. But any extravagant gestures of obeisance, such as falling to the knees, angered the emperor, who in known to have shouted, \"Kneel before God! I am but a man!\" That this abhorrence of obsequiousness was widely known is reflected in a popular play of the day; there, a Francis-like king responds in kind to a groveling subject: \"lch bitt recht sehr, stehen Sie auf, ist alles zu viel!\" (\"I beg you, stand up! This is unnecessary!\"). 4 In 1784,]oseph II had ordered Archduke Francis and his tutors to Vienna so that there might be regular contact between the sovereign-in-training and the various peoples of the Habsburg hereditary lands (fig. 1.2). Francis began to acquire military experience (working his way up from the lowest commissioned officer rank). He also started a personal library (which became part of the Austrian National Library after World War I) and a portrait collection- both of which grew to enormous size. As he undertook various travels or military commissions, he maintained detailed notebooks;\n\n6\n\nErickson\n\nhe kept track of everything just as later his government would keep track of everybody. Finally on January 6, 1788, the archduke married the first of his four wives, but she died in 1790 after giving birth to one daughter. This blow to the loving and apparently faithful husband was doubled when his beloved if difficult uncle Joseph II died the very next day. Now began an intensive and unexpectedly short final phase of Francis's training, as his father, now Emperor Leopold II, assigned him real responsibilities in the government. He got involved in a number of public welfare projects. More ominous, however, was his developing interest in the police and censorship, the political use of which was, of course, nothing new. But Francis was aware that antimonarchical ideas were finding their way into the Habsburg lands-ideas that, in his view, had to be suppressed. Francis's period of apprenticeship abruptly ended when Leopold II died. Francis was now the head of the House of Austria, which controlled an area of about the size of Texas and 27-29 million people. This area included-roughly speaking-today's Austria and Czech Republic (the latter then comprising Bohemia and Moravia), Hungary, Croatia, and Slavonia. In addition to these essentially contiguous areas there were bits ofPoland, the Austrian Netherlands (today's Belgium and Luxembourg), and scattered Austrian possessions in Italy, including the cities of Milan and Mantua. Francis's title as ruler varied among these territories. He was a king several times over, for he was \"by the grace of God, King of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria. and Jerusalem.\" Next in rank was his Austrian title, \"Archduke of Austria,\" and then such titles as Duke of Milan and Mantua. Francis's grandest title was that of Kaiser (emperor) of the Holy Roman Empire, a venerable institution founded in 962 (fig. 1.3). 5 The Empire had once incorporated almost all of central Europe, but by Francis's time it was mostly limited to Germanspeaking Europe-and not all of that. About half of the Habsburg lands were included in the Empire, excluding Hungary and most of the Slavic territories to the east. The imperial title was not hereditary but elective by a college of the seven or eight most powerful princes of Germany, including three archbishops of the Catholic Church. Successive generations of Habsburg sons had had to bargain for the title, each surrendering a bit more of the imperial prerogatives to assure election. And thus Francis was accepted as hereditary ruler of lower Austria on April 25, 1792, was crowned King of Hungary on June 6, was elected Holy Roman Emperor on July 7, was crowned Emperor Francis II in Frankfurt am Main a week later, was crowned King of Bohemia on August 7, and so on. Characteristically, he authorized minimal state expenditure and made generous contributions to the poor in connection with these affairs. However, Francis had little opportunity to savor all these coronation honors, for, in the midst of them, France declared war on him.\n\nI .2 The influence of Emperor Joseph II (r. 1789-90; see plate 4) on his nephew the Archduke Francis as well as the reverence that the future emperor had for his uncle are suggested by this painting, possibly by Joseph Hickel, of 1785, the year the Florence-born archduke was called to Vienna by his imperial uncle. [KHM]\n\n8\n\nErickson\n\n1.3 In 1792,Archduke Francis succeeded his father Leopold II (r. 1790-92) as Holy Roman Emperor Francis II and became, as it turned out, the last to attain the title. In 1806 circumstances forced him to abdicate, bringing an official end to the Holy Roman Empire, but he maintained his imperial dignity, having assumed the title of Francis I, Emperor of Austria, in 1804. [HM)\n\nAUSTRIA, THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, AND NAPOLEON\n\nThe French Revolutionary Wars Leopold II had not originally wanted to meddle in France's internal affairs. Nonetheless, after the French royal couple were caught trying to flee France in June 1791 and were forcibly brought back to Paris as prisoners, Leopold had taken action, issuing with the King of Prussia the Declaration of Pillnitz, whereby all European royalty were exhorted to use appropriate and necessary means to protect Louis XVI. The French government, growing ever more radical, took the Declaration of Pillnitz as a serious threat. Thus, stirred partly by fear of invasion and partly by a proselytizing fervor to export revolutionary ideas, France declared war on Austria a few weeks after Leopold's death. This inaugurated more than two decades of almost constant war spread over several continents and involving all the major European powers-and even the newly born United States of America. These wars were the single most present fact oflife for Francis and Vienna-and thus also for Beethoven (b. 1770 and a Viennese resident since 1792) and the young Schubert (b. 1797) . At the outset, in 1792, a lengthy military engagement with France seemed unlikely. With France in political, economic, and social upheaval, European leaders expected a relatively easy victory against the revolutionary upstart. Thus it was a shock when the allied forces turned heel at Valmy, France, in September. Stunning both sides, this retreat, strategically correct though it was, nonetheless saved the Revolution, doomed\n\nLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and gave French troops the heart to push the Prussian and Austrian forces back across the Rhine and to invade the Austrian Netherlands. In 1793 the deposed king and queen were executed. France issued further declarations of war but also suffered military reverses. The year might have ended with French defeat but for the situation in Poland, where Austria and Prussia were compelled to keep the bulk of their armies against Russia. Also important was a brilliant idea of the French war minister Carnot: a levee en masse-universal compulsory male military service. Within a year, France had an army of 70o,ooo, and the nation was gearing up for total war of the kind never seen before in Europe. Stirred to action by the regicide and France's military aggressiveness, Austria, Prussia, Spain, the United Provinces (Holland), and Britain formed the First Coalition; before the end of 1795, however, the French would settle to their advantage with all but Britain and Austria. In 1796 the tone changed. Historians refer to the \"French Revolutionary wars\" of 1792-95 but to the wars from 1796 to 1815 as \"Napoleonic.\"\n\n9\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\nAustria and the Napoleonic Wars Born on the French-controlled island of Corsica in 1769, the year after Francis's birth, Napoleon was educated in France and graduated in the bottom fifth of his class at the Ecole militaire in Paris. In 1791 he was a prorevolutionary Jacobin, becoming increasingly radical with time and moving up in rank: by 1793 he was a brigadier general. The political instability in France was precisely what gave the ambitious Napoleon his chance. In May 1795 he put down a royalist revolt in Paris, saving both the National Convention and the Republic, and was rewarded with command of the Army of the Interior; then, under the Directory, the next government, he was made commander in chief of the French Army of Italy. Now began the real struggle between France and Austria, one-sided though it was. In 1796, Napoleon swept across northern Italy, which was largely Austrian territory, while another French army headed for Vienna. Frightened, the authorities in Vienna sought ways to whip up public courage and patriotism. What better way, thought Franz Josef, Count of Saurau, than through song? Beethoven had already provided his \"Abschiedsgesang an Wiens Burger\" (Farewell-Song to the Citizens of Vienna) in honor of the volunteer corps in 1796 and was to compose a \"Kriegslied der Osterreicher\" (War-Song of the Austrians) the next year. But the most powerful symbol to rally around was the popular emperor himself, so a song in praise of Francis II was needed. Entrusted to write the text was a Francophobe who had, as had so many other Austrian intellectuals and bureaucrats, originally been an enthusiastic supporter of the ideals of the French Enlightenment; now, disillusioned with the French Revolution, he was churning out such hate songs as \"Verwiinschungen der Franzosen\" (Curses on the French!) and \"Blutrache tiber die Franzosen\" (Bloody Revenge on the French!). His paean of praise to Francis, who was out of sympathy with the French philosophes' point of view, was in turn given over to Vienna's leading musical citizen, who then\n\nf}\n\n!0\n\nErickson\n\n1.4 This autograph of Haydn's four-part setting of his patriotic melody \"Kaiserhymne\" (hymn for the emperor), with text by Lorenz Leopold Haschka (1796) symbolizes how music, along with the other arts, was conscripted into service during the Austrian wars against Napoleon. The melody was later used as a series of variations in Haydn's \"Emperor\" Quartet and is still today the tune of the German national anthem. (ONb:Mus]\n\nproduced the most famous melody he ever wrote, although he modestly entitled it a Volkslied-folk song. The result of this collaboration was, of course, the famous Kaiserhymne \"Gott erhalte\" (God preserve [the Emperor]!), its text by Lorenz Leopold Haschka and music (still the melody of the German national anthem) by Josef Haydn (fig . r .4) . First sung on February 12, 1797, on the emperor's birthday in theaters all over the Habsburg lands, it soon acquired the status of a standard. Poets and musicians were not the only ones who contributed to the war effort . There is a stirring account ofhow the students of the Academy of Fine Arts responded to the call to arms in 1797. They assembled in the hall of antiquities to hear (according to one student) the \"splendid, stately Fiiger, reading the call to arms with deep pathos in his sonorous voice. Hundreds of voices cheered him, we joined hands in an oath for life and for fatherland and emperor\"-this while tears ran down the faces of the professors.6 These things happened the year Franz Schubert was born in Vienna. Considering the military situation, it was not a good year to arrive on the scene. Although the\n\nFrench decided not to attack Vienna on this occasion, Napoleon did extract from Austria, in the Treaty of Campo Formio, the first and least humiliating of four agreements to be cited here, the Austrian Netherlands in exchange for Venice, !stria, and Dalmatia on the Adriatic. In 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt. But other French armies continued southward, capturing the Papal States and Naples. The Second Coalition-consisting ofEngland, Russia, the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), Naples, and Portugal-began to form, but it foundered because of internal divisions. Austria joined the coalition in March 1799, when the French armies invaded Tuscany, where Francis had been born. During this year the allies did have some success in overthrowing some of the French puppet states, but then, in October, who should show up in Paris (having abandoned his defeated army in the Middle East) but Bonaparte, and just in time to co engineer a coup d'etat. He was named first consul, effectively the ruler of France, in December 1799. France, having revolted against absolutism, now embraced it anew. It did not take Napoleon long to finish off the Second Coalition, and Austria in particular. In a spectacular move, he crossed the Alps via the Great St. Bernard Pass, catching the Austrians by surprise and defeating them at Marengo. When this was followed by other French victories over Austrian armies in Germany, Austria had to endure the Peace of Luneville in 18or. Austria ceded all territory west of the Rhine to France, fortifications on the Rhine's eastern bank were razed, leaving western and central Germany essentially defenseless. Hitting Austria even harder was the sharp reduction of its territory and influence in Italy, which Austria had worked harder to protect than it had the German-speaking area. Moreover, because the Habsburg Duke of Modena and the Grand Duke of Tuscany were now without territory, Austria was forced to agree to giving pieces of the Reich to the Habsburg dukes displaced from Italy. This, of course, undermined the Reich. No wonder that the Austrian foreign minister Thugut, who had acquired the unflattering nickname Thunichtgut-\"do no good\"- had to resign.\n\nThe Creation of the Austrian Empire and the Dissolution\n\nof the Holy Roman Empire\n\nA general peace in Europe was temporarily achieved in 1802. In tribute and gratitude for his accomplishments, France bestowed life tenure on its first consul Napoleon and gave him the right to name his successor. In the same month, the Reichsdeputation, a committee of the German imperial legislature or Reichstag, met at Regensburg under the shadow of Napoleon's fist and in consequence of the Treaty of Luneville. Its purpose: to reorganize the Holy Roman Empire, of which Francis was nominal head. This was effected through the so-called Reichsdeputationshauptschll1f3 or Imperial Recess of 1803. Reflecting Napoleon's anticlericalism, this constitutional resolution wiped out virtually all of the states of the Reich headed by ecclesiastics-including Salzburg, ruled by a prince archbishop, as Mozart had known it-and reapportioned the territories to secular states. Similarly, almost all of the fifty-one imperial cities lost\n\nII\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\nAm HofC2-B2 Apollosaal C I Burgtor C2 Das Glacis C2, B2, C3 Donaukanal C4 -A2\n\nFreyung B2-C2 Graben C2 Hohe Markt C2-C3 Josefsplatz C2 JosefStadt C1\n\nKaffeehauser B4 Karnthner Tor C2 Kettenbriicke B 3 K.

Both measures facilitated Napoleon's control over the territories and princes of the Reich. But worst of all for Austria was the modification of the college of electors that chose the emperor; now Protestants were in the majority, and chances that the next emperor would be a Habsburg were almost nil. When Francis realized that the imperial title was almost certain to be lost-and that his successor would be a mere archduke within the Reich-and when Napoleon was proclaimed emperor in May 1804, he knew that he would have to take action. First, he tried to have the Holy Roman Empire converted into a hereditary entity under the Habsburgs. Not surprisingly, this failed, so, in a stroke of Realpolitik, Francis took the additional title Francis I, Emperor of Austria, on August 14, 1804. Although the legal basis for this was not unimpeachable, the title was not challenged; for the first time, the head of the House of Habsburg had a single title that covered all of the various Habsburg territories. In 1805 England, Russia, Austria, Sweden, and Naples formed the Third Coalition against France. Again, it was mostly in Italy that Austria got involved, prompted by Napoleon's having crowned himself King of Italy in Milan and by France's having swallowed parts of Italy. This time Napoleon was determined to reach the Habsburg capital; he did so on November 13, 1805, finding the city deserted by everyone who could afford to leave (fig. 1.5). This explains why the sparse audience at the premiere of Beethoven's opera Fidelia on November 20 consisted mainly of French soldiers. A rout of allied forces at Austerlitz followed in early December, and Austria was subjected to the crushing Peace ofPressburg. By this treaty, Austria was completely shut out ofltaly and further weakened in Germany. Wrote Metternich, then ambassador to Paris, to Friedrich Gentz about the treaty of Press burg: \"The world is lost. Europe is burning out and only out of its ashes will a new order of things arise.\"7 Metternich had, in fact, suffered personal indignity as a result of the French victory: while at Austerlitz, Napoleon had used Metternich's new house, the Schloss Kaunitz, as his headquarters. The Pressburg agreement also contained an ominous mention of Bavaria and Wiirttemberg, to which Napoleon doled out some surrendered Austrian territory, as members of\"the Confederation Germanique.\" What, then, was this? It did not take long to find out. In July 1806 the Rheinbund or Confederation of the Rhine was created, with Napoleon as \"protector.\" Following close upon this, sixteen German princes announced they were seceding from the Reich. The legality of this move is highly doubtful, but de facto if not de jure, this was the end of the Holy Roman Empire established in the tenth century. On August 6, 1806, Francis, as Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, abdicated, giving up all pretense to stature and influence in western and southern Germany, now under Napoleon's thumb. As Francis I of the Austrian Empire, though, he was determined to rule with more real power than he had had before.\n\n15\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\n1.5 Twice during the Napoleonic wars, in r805 and r809, Vienna suffered the indignity and hardship of occupation by French troops. This etching by Pierre Adrien LeBeau after Thomas Charles Naudet depicts the entry of the French army into Vienna on November 13, r8o5. At the time, Schubert was eight years old. [HM]\n\nShortly thereafter Napoleon crushed Prussia. He had reached the apogee of his power, now controlling all of Italy, most of the German-speaking world, and most of Europe west of the Rhine. He had imposed social and political change in most of his conquered territories, eliminating feudalism and church control and modernizing and consolidating political units. Furthermore, by means of his so-called \"Continental system,\" he was trying to eliminate all European commerce with England, which had beaten him at sea. Meanwhile, in Vienna, the Treaty ofPressburg had led to a major reorganization of the government and to thoughts of revenge. Over the next three years, inspired and pushed on by the new foreign minister Johann Philipp Stadion (like Metterilich, a German-speaking non-Austrian), Austria prepared for renewed war with France. The military was reformed by the Emperor's brother Karl, and a military reserve army or Landwehr was formed in r8o8-the Austrian version of the French levee en masse. Moreover, there was a concerted campaign, especially as war approached, in which the arts were enlisted, to whip up not just Austrian but pan-German patriotism. Here another imperial brother, Archduke Johann, played an especially important role. He believed that the moment was approaching when Providence would give to Austria the means of rescuing distressed humanity, by which he meant especially the Germans in\n\n!6\n\nErickson\n\nthe French-controlled Confederation of the Rhine. He encouraged artists to choose national themes for their paintings and had anti-Napoleonic literature translated and published. The foreign minister Stadion, recognizing the power of the press to instill national feeling, persuaded the emperor-who in 1792 had complained that too many people were reading newspapers-to loosen the manacles on the press and on the educational system. The goal was not freedom of expression, of course, but rather the education of the people about their culture, history, geography, heroes, customs, arts, and literature. The results ranged from the founding of new newspapers to encyclopedic enterprises such as that undertaken by the Archduke Johann's friend Joseph Hormayr, who devoted himself over many years to publishing popular works on virtually every topic of German culture. In the same nationalistic spirit was the commission and installation of the equestrian statue ofJoseph II in the Josefsplatz of the Hofburg, a work of the important Austrian sculptor Franz Anton Zauner (see Chapter 7). That artists were considered useful for the state's purposes is also evident from Francis's 1809 decree that freed artists from military service-which may explain in part the flood of students entering the Academy of Fine Arts after the Treaty ofPressburg. A flood of pamphlets also appeared, many written by professional propagandists in state service, such as Friedrich Gentz and the German nationalist writer Friedrich Schlegel. The latter, with his brother August Wilhelm, had come to Vienna, along with a string of other German romantics from the north, around 1808; in the same year Schubert, who was later to set some of Friedrich Schlegel's poetry to music, entered the Stadtkonvikt, the select and strict school for nonnoble boys closely connected to the court; his acceptance indicates that Schubert was recognized from the start as having special potential. All the military reforms and propaganda efforts were intended to help realize a plan to push the French out of central Germany in the hope of restoring the Empire and of punishing those German lords who had given in so easily to Napoleon. This time Austria would be the aggressor. As Metternich concluded in a communication to Stadion on April 27, 1808: \"Peace with Napoleon is not peace.\" 8 That all Austria was geared up for war was recognized by the French charge d'affaires in Vienna, who wrote to the foreign minister: \"In 1805, war was wanted by the government, but not the army nor the people; in 1809, it is wanted by the government, by the army, and by the people.\" 9 Even the emperor's third wife, Maria Ludovica, driven from northern Italy with her parents by Napoleon in 1796, contributed by encouraging the cultivation of national customs and traditional costume. The Viennese came to call her Unsere Iiebe Landesmutter-the dear mother of our country. And so on April 10, 1809, inspired by an emotional declaration penned by Friedrich Schlegel, the Austrians attacked. However, all the preparations had been for naught. Napoleon pushed the Habsburg forces back and reentered Vienna on May 13, this\n\n!7 Vienna in Its\n\nEuropean Context\n\nr.6 This image captures the fierceness of the bombardment ofVienna on May II-!2, r8o9, which preceded the second occupation of the city by Napoleon's troops.

[HM]\n\ntime after an artillery bombardment that destroyed lives and property and undoubtedly hastened the demise of the aged Haydn only two weeks later (fig. r.6). A week after the occupation Napoleon took a hard blow from the Austrian army at Essling-Aspern, but on July 5, less than two months after the Austrian attack, he defeated the same army at Wagram, leading to the Treaty of Schonbrunn three months later. This time Napoleon demanded no less than Francis's abdication as ruler of Austria, desiring to replace him with one of Francis's more malleable brothers. The other alternative was that Austria accept terms comparable to the Treaty ofPressburg. Francis would not abdicate, so on October 14 at the Habsburg palace at Schonbrunn-now Napoleon's headquarters- Austria lost about 3. 5 million more subjects in German lands to the Rheinbund, as well as part of Poland and territories on and around the Adriatic, eliminating Austria's last direct access to the sea. Furthermore, Francis was forced to pay a heavy cash indemnity, reduce his army, and-a humiliating provision-cashier and even expel many of the non-Austrian aristocratic refugees fleeing French-controlled territory. As a further taunt, Napoleon had imperial art and other treasures carted off to Paris. Austria was at the nadir of its fortunes.\n\nAUSTRIA, THE RISE OF METTERNICH, AND THE FALL OF NAPOLEON\n\nNonetheless, something had occurred about a week before the Treaty of Schonbrunn was signed that would lift Austria out of its ignominy: on October 8, I809, Count Clemens Metternich replaced Stadion as foreign minister; he was to control Austrian foreign policy for almost the next forty years. At this point, in fact, Austria might be said to have entered the Age of Metternich, for the new foreign minister quickly made his presence felt: only five months later Austria had outnegotiated Russia (Napoleon's initial favorite) in the contest to provide a wife for Napoleon. This was part of Metternich's strategy to protect Austria by tem-\n\n!8\n\nErickson\n\nporary cooperation and alliance with France, even if it meant sacrificing an archduchess. The designated bride was Marie-Louise, Francis's daughter; she could not only provide Napoleon with an heir, but coursing through her veins was Habsburg blood, than which there was no nobler in Europe (fig. 1.7). The couple were married by proxy-and amid mixed public opinion-in Vienna on March II, I8Io, after which the hapless bride went to Paris to meet her husband for the first time and have a splendiferous state wedding. The upstart Corsican could now qualify for any social register. The efficacy of Metternich's diplomacy in this matter was confirmed the next year, when a son was born to the French imperial couple. His name is revealingNapoleon Franz Karl Joseph-all names of emperors-and he was immediately made King of Rome. If I8II brought joy to Napoleon and Marie-Louise, it was not so for Austria. Contrary to Metternich's hopes, Napoleon did not lighten Austria's obligations under the Treaty of Schonbrunn, and the state went bankrupt, reducing the value of its currency by So percent. Life in Vienna was hard. The Difeat cif Napoleon\n\nThe next year, however, Napoleon made his fateful decision to extend his empire north and east. Assembling an army of 6oo,ooo, he headed toward Moscow in June I8I2, arriving there in mid-September. Forced to double back, the army came under the attack of the Russian winter. With temperatures plummeting to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit, the once-proud French army was reduced to about 30,000. Napoleon, getting wind of potential problems at home, acted as he had with his defeated Egyptian army-he left the troops to get home on their own. But his star was falling. Wellington's victory at Vittoria on June 2 I, I 8I2, in northern Spain, dealt the seemingly invincible Bonaparte a devastating blow, leading to an invasion of France and the Battle of Leipzig on October I6-I9, by which time Austria had abandoned its alliance with France (figs. r.8, 1.9). All these events were celebrated in music, of course.

Franz Schubert celebrated the victory at Leipzig with a song for voice and strings, \"Auf den Sieg der Deutschen\" (On the Victory of the Germans), D.81 ; he may even have written the rather artless text himself.lO Finally, in March 1814, the allies-Prussia, Russia, Austria, and Great Britainjoined forces effectively. Heading for Paris, Emperor Francis and his cohorts forced Napoleon's abdication on April 6 and triumphantly entered the city on April 15, the news of which caused Schubert to write a song for bass, \"Die Befreier Europas in Paris\" (The Liberators ofEurope in Paris), D.104. Napoleon was sent off to Elba in exile. In a matter of weeks, at Tsar Alexander's suggestion and in recognition of Austria's sacrifices over the previous two decades and Metternich's shrewd diplomacy, representatives of the various nations involved in the wars, as well as various interest groups, assembled in Vienna to redraw the map of Europe. This work-and the play for which the Congress was equally famous-was interrupted with the terrifYing news that on March 1, Napoleon had returned to fight again. And so yet another alliance-the seventh since 1792-was formed to crush \"the enemy and disturber of the peace of the world.\"\n\n20\n\nErickson\n\nr.8 Title page of Ludwig van Beethoven's piano arrangement of his sensational success, \"Wellington's Victory or the Battle ofVittoria,\" which commemorated in music the decisive defeat of Napoleon on July 21, 1813.

Beethoven's popularity was so enhanced by this piece that it helped bring about in 1814 a revival of his previously unsuccessful opera Leonore in a revised (now standard) version entitled Fidelia, which Schubert heard. (WSLb]\n\nIn June ISIS, after the famous \"hundred days ,\" it was finally over. Napoleon's last battle was at Waterloo, where he was defeated by English, Dutch, and Prussian forces.

Ruhe und Ordung- Tranquility and Order-was to become the motto of the second half of Francis's reign. It was necessary, felt Metternich, that revolution never show its demonic head again, and this required, first of all, a division of postNapoleonic Europe that would keep all of the major powers in check. Austria gained some land, of course-it got more than its share ofltaly back, for example-but Met-\n\n21\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\n1.9 The Battle of Leipzig, which was waged October r6-r9, r8r3, was one of the major events of the\n\nNapoleonic wars.

Artaria also published some of Schubert's compositions during the later part of the composer's life. [HM]\n\nternich felt that a balance of power in Europe would benefit Austria more than any temporary territorial gain. For this reason also the partitioning of the map took little account oflocal feelings but considered rather only what was acceptable to the rulers. It has been said that the resulting division of Europe was reasonable, but not necessarily just or moral. Second, Metternich strove to persuade all parties to suppress revolution immediately so as to preserve the new status quo permanently. Although all governments of the time were repressive to some degree, Austria became known especially for the ubiquity and omnipresence of its police surveillance and its swift and hard suppression of an uprising that occurred in northern Italy. Thus was Ruhe und Ordung achieved in the Habsburg territories, at least until 1848. The Austrian Police State It may come as a surprise to many readers that the aged Haydn as well as Beethoven\n\nand Schubert lived in a Vienna cloaked in an atmosphere of political repression and suspicion, so a few words of explanation are in order. The simplified account of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars that I\n\nhave offered really is but one side of the coin. Parallel with a war against the French armies was a war against ideas, many but not all of which were associated with France. For Francis, that war seems to have been the more important; he gave away his daughter to the enemy general, but he never tolerated free expression of opinion, at least on political matters. His course had been set early, by the restoration of the notorious Count Pergen to a position of power in the police ministry; Pergen had previously worked for Joseph II but had fallen out of favor with the more open-minded Leopold (fig. I.ro). Writing to the provincial governors in 1793, he had declared war against dangerous ideas: \"In the present conditions when the cult of liberty has gained so much ground and all monarchical governments face great unrest, the ordinary arrangements for peace and security are inadequate. Every government must secretly set all forces in motion for the good of the state, in order to convert those in error and 22\n\nErickson\n\nto wipe out through effective countermeasures all dangerous impressions that might have been instilled in any class of subjects by sneaking agitators.\"ll In 1794 a two-year resident of Vienna reported: \"Several important persons have been arrested here. It is said that a revolution was to break out-but I believe that as long as the Austrian has some dark beer and little sausages he will not revolt. Briefly, the gates to the suburbs must be closed at ten in the evening. The soldiers have loaded muskets. One doesn't dare raise his voice here, otherwise the police find lodging for you.\" 12 The writer was Beethoven, and he was probably referring to the arrests, in July 1794, of members of the prorevolution political clubs. Determined to stop the spread of such groups, Francis restored the death penalty (abolished for civilians by Joseph II), and, after a public trial, the so-called Jacobins were executed, thereby sending the intended message to the populace. But the police were not limiting their surveillance to genuine revolutionaries. From this point throughout the reign of Francis-he died in 1835-the police were everywhere in search of the slightest hint of unorthodox ideas among the citizenry. The state's suspicion of intellectuals was such that many citizens who desired careers in government avoided higher education in the belief that it would work against their obtaining a position. The emperor was finally informed in March r 8 ro that the heavy censorship was actually working against the welfare of the state. Francis, paternalistically devoted to his subjects yet ever wary of free thought and speech, ordered a loosening of the censorship, as long as nai:ve hearts and heads were protected \"from the poisonous aspirations of self-seeking seducers, and from the dangerous illusions of crazed heads.\"13 Of course, the conditions to be met for this-spelled out in detaileffectively kept the censorship in force. In the Vienna of Francis I, then, it was dangerous to speak and write freely. Although the police did not employ systematic brutality and terror in enforcing the censorship or suppressing ideas, the possibility of arrest, the loss of one's job, and other deterrents made that unnecessary. Franz Schubert was himself arrested in 1820 with one of his former schoolmates, the poet Johann Senn. Senn, the principal target of the po-\n\n1. 10 Johann Anton Graf Pergen, pictured in this engraving by Johann Ernst Mansfeld as a Knight of the Order of St. Stephen, symbolized the omnipresence of the Austrian police before and during the reign of Francis I as well as the unrelenting search for evidence of republican tendencies among the Viennese population. [ONb:Ba]\n\nlice in this instance, was suspected of being a member of a student organization like those recently outlawed as part of a general crackdown throughout Germany on universities and student freedoms as a result of the assassination of the reactionary poet and dramatist August Kotzebue. He was also accused-along with Schubert and some others present-of insulting the police. Senn was imprisoned and exiled; Schubert seems not to have been further punished, but apparently he was traumatized by this unpleasant contact with the dark forces of the new Austrian chief of police, Sedlnitzky, who was extremely concerned about \"political fanaticism\" (fig. r.n). It has even been proposed that this incident may explain a significant change in his handwriting at this time.14 In any event, Schubert never saw his friend again. Less traumatic perhaps but nonetheless sobering was the fate of a rather funny organization called the Ludlamshohle, the name of an inn near the Stefansplatz that took its name from a play performed in Vienna in r817. Its one hundred or so members, led by Ignaz Castelli, were all connected to the arts and included some luminaries, imperial court composer Antonio Salieri for one. Fully one fourth of the membership was connected with Schubert in some way. The Ludlarnites banned talk of politics or business, took parodistic nicknames, published witty and sarcastic newspapers, made fun of those junior members unable to pass the test to senior status, sang songs, and held their meetings openly. (Moreover, the rules stipulated that the society's head had to be the stupidest member of all.) Perhaps only in Vienna could such an organization flourish , but flourish it did from 1818 to 1826. From Schubert's friend Eduard von Bauernfeld, a member, we know that the composer wanted to join. But before this happened someone reported that secret and dangerous things were going on -something having to do with political and religious connections to India-so one foggy night the\n\n23 Vienna in Its European Context\n\n24 Erickson\n\nr. II Joseph Graf Sedlnitzky was Johann Anton Pergen's successor as head of the Austrian police. It was in 1820, during his term of office, that Schubert was arrested with his student activist friend Johann Senn, who was confmed and then exiled. [Onb:Ba]\n\npolice descended upon the club's meeting place and confiscated all the papers, music, smoking pipes, and the like. This was followed by searches of the houses of members who were writers, notably Franz Grillparzer, a dramatist and an official of the Treasury Archives, who was interrogated, had his papers taken, and was confined to his house for a day (see fig. 10.14). When the police investigation turned up nothing, the organization was permitted to continue (as long as a representative of the police was present), but that was the end of the Ludlamshohle.1s Schubert may not have made it into the Ludlamshohle, but in 1817-18 he had been a member of a younger group of Viennese and German intellectuals who created something similar: the Unsinns- Gesellschaft (Gesellschaft: society; Unsinn: folly or absurdity). The activities of this long-unknown group, recently discovered by Rita Stehlin, included the staging of original plays and publication of members-only newsletters that spoofed contemporary politics as well as scientific discoveries, drama, and literature.1 6 Like the Ludlamshohle, members had code names; Schubert's was Don Giovanni of the Keyboard. The membership included not only some persons long known to have been Schubert's friends (such as the Kupelwieser brothers) but also some not heretofore associated with him, like the artist Johann Nepomuk Hoechle. Schubert's involvement in the secret Unsinns-Gesellschaft is the newest piece of evidence pointing to his dissatisfaction with the political system under which he lived. That the Unsinns-Gesellschaft could have existed at all may prove that the clamp on free expression was not as tight as it would be after the assassination of Kotzebue. However, Schubert's later friend Eduard Bauernfeld was to write in Aus Alt-und NeuWien (1872) that in these same years some of his favorite teachers were being persecuted for their unduly liberal political or religious views and that ultimately the oppression of the Austrian system caused him to flee into the ideal world of poetry.\n\nBIEDERMEIER CULTURE\n\nBiedermeier Pleasures Generally speaking, then, Viennese society was forced to turn inward, to home and family, to innocent and nonpolitical activities. The result was a quiet, bourgeois culture that later was looked back on ironically as the good old days (die gute alte Zeit) and was denominated by the term Biedermeier, which at first carried negative connotations.1 7 The middle-class ideals of this culture manifested themselves in everything from furniture to social dance. The family, perhaps in imitation of the truly exemplary first family of Austria, became even more central and, if possible, more patriarchal than before, and this was represented and idealized in the paintings and plays of the period (fig. 1.12; see Chapter 8). Although recently there have been challenges to the traditional notion that noble patronage was sharply declining, it is clear that Hausmusik (music for/in the home), for example, was clearly in the ascendance. The Vaterliindische Blatter, a publication founded to stir up patriotic pride before Austria attacked Napoleon, reported that \"here on any given evening there is hardly a family that does not derive entertainment\n\nThis painting by Leopold Fertbauer not only shows how Francis I projected himself as the head of the imperial family in Austria's patriarchal society but also suggests how the ideals of domestic happiness and simple comforts associated with the Biedermeier lifestyle came to influence even the highest levels ofHabsburg society. All these values are reflected also in plates II and I2 . [HM]\n\nI. I2\n\n25\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\nfrom a string quartet or a piano sonata.\"18 This applied as well to the imperial family, for Francis continued the family tradition of amateur music making. Gatherings of family and friends probably represented the most common venue for music making during Francis's reign. Higher on the social scale were private salonsformerly often political but now more simply cultural, in the broad sense of the term. Traditionally, salons had been hosted by women, and this continued after the Congress. From the perspective of brain power, undoubtedly the premiere Viennese salon was that of Caroline Pichler, who surrounded herself with the leading poets, playwrights, and thinkers of the day (see fig. 2.8). From r8o8 on,for example, the likes of Friedrich and Dorothea Schlegel, Clemens Brentano, Heinrich Josef and Matthaus von Collin, Grillparzer, Theodor Korner, and Joseph Hormayr were found there; previously Mozart and Haydn had visited, and Schubert also made Pichler's acquaintance. 26 Erickson\n\nIf one wished to leave the house, there were public concerts (see Chapter 5) and especially the theater (see Chapter ro), which was experiencing one of its greatest moments in European history. In late r8ro, the two privileged imperial theaters, the Burgtheater (then located just opposite the imperial palace or Hofburg) and the Karntnertortheater became more specialized: the Burgtheater became the official venue for German spoken drama, the Karntnertortheater the principle place for opera and ballet. That is why Schubert intended his operas for the latter. The Theater an der Wien, a private theater just outside of the inner city, offered everything-spoken theater, opera, ballet, magic plays; during the Congress of Vienna Mozart's Die Zauberfiote (The Magic Flute) had its 340th performance there. Then, for sheer fun, there were two suburban theaters that specialized in homegrown Viennese popular comedies. In connection with the Theater in der Leopoldstadt, especially, the actor and playwright Ferdinand Raimund must be mentioned, although he got his start at the other theater, in the Josefstadt. Schubert~\n\nFriends and the Schubertiade\n\nFranz Schubert's adult life mirrors this early Biedermeier culture. Among the great composers of the so-called first Viennese School-of which Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven are considered the primary members-Schubert was the only true Viennese.19 Moreover, Schubert lived among the middle classes, without the kind of regular intercourse with the highest echelons of Viennese nobility that Beethoven enjoyed. It may justly be said that the two composers, who met only once, lived at the same time in different Viennas. If Beethoven could have his Eroica symphony first performed in a grand palace of the Lobkowitz family, Schubert in the main offered songs as well as piano and chamber music to a somewhat less distinguished but perhaps more appreciative audience in the intimate company of the Schubertiade, a term used to describe informal musical gatherings centered around the composer (fig. r. 13). On these occasions his friends and admirers (and strangers, too) came to hear his music, dance to his improvised accompaniments, and otherwise entertain themselves with those innocuous pleasures permitted in Biedermeier Vienna (see also fig. II.6).\n\n27\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\n1.13 Ferdinand Georg Waldmiiller's pencil drawing of 1827, show· ing Schubert at the piano with his singing friends Josephine Frohlich and Johann Michael Vogl, documents the kind of informal music making that was characteristic not only of Schubert's circle but of Viennese Biedermeier society in general. (For Waldmiiller, see C hapter 8 and plates 12 and 18.) [GSA]\n\nIt is worthwhile to reflect briefly on Schubert's companions, for there is sometimes a tendency to regard them as a group of bright but flighty bourgeoisie oflittle consequence. We tend to forget that most of them were just starting their careers, too. But if we consider a bit just who these people were, we learn something about Schubert the person and his position in the Viennese cultural scene-which, because of the awesome, overshadowing presence of Beethoven, has tended to be underestimated. There were many literary figures around Schubert during his short maturity. Johann Mayrhofer, ten years older, was the oldest; Schubert set to music more of his poems (forty-seven) than anyone else except Goethe and Schiller, and they collaborated on\n\ntwo operas (see fig. 9-4). Another poet was the libertine Franz von Schober, librettist of Schubert's opera Alfonso and Estrella (see fig. 10.17) .20 Although Schober failed as a dramatist, he went on to lead a very interesting life, among other things serving as Franz Liszt's secretary in 1841-47· A third literary figure was Eduard von Bauernfeld (see fig. 10. 16) . Born in 1802 and living until 1890, this physicist's son was in his mid-twenties when a member of the Schubert circle. Thereafter he went on to become an important playwright of the Viennese theater, so important that he was made a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in 1848, an honorary citizen ofVienna, and a doctor honoris causa of the University of Vienna. Finally, we should mention Schubert's school chum Johann Senn, who tangled with the secret police, and Theodor Korner, poet of the War of Liberation and a member of the Pichler salon circle, who 28\n\nErickson\n\nprovided poetry for some early songs; both were individuals of real talent. There were painters, too. The most important was Moritz von Schwind, a brilliant draughtsman, whose later, idealized depictions of Schubert's social life have come down to us (fig. 1. 14) . Schwind went on to become an important late romantic painter, whose\n\n( 1.14 Moritz von Schwind, younger than Schubert by seven years and a close and true friend from 1823, sketched dancing (presumably by the Schubertians) outside the manor house in Atzenbrugg.\n\nThe estate was owned by the great monastery ofK!osterneuberg but was in the charge of relatives of Schubert's friend Franz von Schober, whose magnetic (but not always benign) character pulled both Schubert and Schwind into his circle. Many years later Schwind used the sketch as the basis for a finished picture. [GSA)\n\n29 Vienna in Its\n\nEuropean Context Excursions into the countryside were popular among the Viennese. Leopold Kupelwieser's watercolor of an outing of the Schubertians from Atzenbrugg to Aumiihl in 1820 shows Schubert and Kupelwieser walking behind the wagon, Josef von Spaun's hat being crushed by the wagon wheel, and Franz von Schober, whose relatives had invited the group to Atzenbrugg, standing on the rear running board to the right. (HM] I. IS\n\nwork has been characterized as having a certain unaffected, happy, fairy-tale quality. His eminence was sufficient to win him the contract for the murals at the Vienna Opera House in the r86os, and it was in this period that he did his famous Schubert Evening at Spaun's, which combines the audiences of different Schubertiades into one. Another important painter, and a friend from r8r5, was Leopold Kupelwieser (figs. r.rs, r. r6) . He is one of those who recorded the fun-filled excursions of one Schubert circle to Atzenbrugg. Later he was especially noted for his religious paintings and his portraits. When he went to Rome in r823, he kept up a lively correspondence with Schubert and Schwind. He later decorated the University Church of Vienna, and in r836 he was named Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. There were no composers among Schubert's close friends, but there were professional musicians, notably the eminent singer Johann Michael Vogl, who had been a member of the Viennese court opera for about twenty years when he met Schubert; despite the age difference, the two became fast friends, often performing and traveling together. The most important figure in contact with the Schubert circle, however, was Franz Grillparzer, considered the greatest of all Austrian dramatists (fig. I. 17). It is he who wrote the much discussed epitaph on Schubert's tomb: The art of music here entombed a rich possession but even fairer hopes.\n\n30\n\nErickson\n\nLeopold Kupelwieser portrayed here in 1821 the Schubertians at Atzenbrugg in a game of charades depicting the \"fall\" of\"Rheinfall\" by reference to the sin of Adam and Eve. In the center, between \"Adam\" and \"Eve,\" is Schober (\"the Serpent\"), clinging to Kupelwieser (\"the Tree of Knowledge\"). Among those trying to decipher the scene are Schubert (at the piano) and Schubert's oldest and most loyal friend, joseph von Spaun (seated second from right). [HM] 1.16\n\nIt probably reflects Grillparzer's sincere belief that Schubert had not yet achieved the full greatness as a composer of which he was capable. The popular literature, perhaps unduly influenced by the extant pictorial evidence, often describes the activities of the Schubert circle as lighthearted and sociable. To be sure, they included reading evenings, occasions for listening to Schubert's compositions and for dancing to his improvisations, party games, and outings into the countryside. But there was also a more serious side to things, especially in the early 182os, when Schubert and Schober, together with Schwind, Kupelwieser, Bauernfeld, and the laterestranged Franz von Bruchmann shared a common nonconformist attitude toward life and art similar to, and somewhat inspired by, German romantics of a generation earlier.21 They felt alienated by what they considered the hypocritical norms of the world in which they lived, and they looked to art as the salvation of society. In reaction to the rigorously hierarchical, controlled environment imposed by Metternich's \"Austrian system,\" the\n\nSchube~tians\n\ntherefore practiced and celebrated egalitarianism and intel-\n\nlectual honesty among themselves, tolerated sexual behavior of their comrades that was condemned or at least discouraged by society, and committed themselves genuinely to the free creation of art that was frankly critiqued within the circle. 22 Their nonconformity did not take outwardly brazen forms of political or religious opposition, but perhaps Schubert gave vent to that which could not be expressed explicitly by deleting the phrase \"[I believe] in one, holy, catholic church\" from the Credo of all six of his masses; by his friendship with the singer Katherine von Laszny, who, according to Schwind, flaunted her promiscuity in the face of societal conventions; and by his intensive work setting Bauernfeld's opera libretto Der Graf von Gleichen to music, even though a performance was precluded because the story, involving a bigamous marriage, could not get by the censor. More positively, his likely belief in a deistic or pantheistic God (also shared by early romantics) found expression in his song \"Die Allmacht,\" wherein Schubert pours out a paean of praise from the depths of his souJ.2 3 Along with the police and censorship, another essential element of the state influenced Viennese life during the reign of Francis 1: the bureaucracy. Bureaucrats had a status quite different from that of U.S. government employees today; in Schubert's Vienna, a title and a uniform to go with it guaranteed the owner at least some respect, not to mention a regular paycheck. Many of Schubert's friends , in fact, were part of this byzantine system, with its infinite gradations and complex protocol. Josef von Spaun, Schubert's most faithful friend, who introduced him to Mayrhofer, Schober, Kupelwieser, and Korner, among others, worked in the Vienna lottery office. Mayrhofer was high in the censor's office and apparently, despite his liberal leanings,\n\n1.17 Thugut Heinrich 's 1826 chalk drawing of Schubert's acquaintance Franz Grillparzer shows the dramatist after his reputation had become established but before his full artistic maturity. In the next two years he provided the text for a substantial piece programmed on Schubert's one beneftt concert, composed the eulogy delivered at Beethoven's funeral by Schubert's actor friend Heinrich Anschutz (see fig. ro. 13), and wrote the epitaph that graces Schubert's tombstone. [HM]\n\n31\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\ntook his work very seriously; this may have set up a conflict of values that contributed to his suicide. Grillparzer, too, chafing at the bit in his desire for real political freedom, nonetheless had a respectable position as head of the Imperial Treasury Archives. Kupelwieser, as professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, was a kind of bureaucrat, too, for Metternich himself was the true head of the Academy. Although bureaucrats had to be extremely careful to avoid political activity, their work may not always have been demanding. Grillparzer writes in his diary: \"Came to the office about noon ... found nothing to do ... so I read Thucydides.\" But when he becomes director of the Treasury Archives things get rougher: \"This work will put me under the ground, especially because it robs me of the valuable morning hours.\" 24\n\n32\n\nErickson\n\nAs we have seen, Viennese culture in the Age of Francis I was at first buffeted by war, then repressed in some but by no means all of its parts. The inhabitants of the Habsburg lands had little or no say in the policies of their government, yet they loved their dedicated if humorless \"Franzl\" (an affectionate nickname for Francis) and feared Metternich. It was in this environment, shaped not a little by the Napoleonic wars of his youth, that Franz Schubert created a musical legacy of exceptional beauty in his tragically short life. We can be grateful, moreover, that, as was true of Mozart, Schubert's fecundity was extraordinary. In 1814, with Napoleon down but not yet out, the seventeen-year-old Schubert began 'an outburst of composition without parallel in the history of music,\" turning out his first completed opera and mass and the masterful \"Gretchen am Spinnrade.\"25 The next year nearly two hundred works flowed from his pen, including four operas and thirty songs on Goethe, among them \"Erlkonig.\" When it was all over only twelve years later, there were a thousand works for Otto Erich Deutsch to catalog. Schubert's achievement in thirty-one years can be best appreciated when compared with Beethoven at age thirty-one: both had completed a dozen or so major sonatas, but Schubert had eight symphonies to Beethoven's one, eight operas to none for Beethoven, six hundred songs to Beethoven's three dozen. And although the inner feeling of Schubert's music is different from Beethoven's, the quality is just as extraordinary. It makes one reflect, with Grillparzer, on what might have been.\n\nNOTES\n\nr.

In his I872 memoir Aus Alt- und Neu- Wien, in Gesammelte Schriften von Bauernfeld I2 (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumiiller, 1873), vol. 4, Schubert's close friend Eduard von Bauernfeld speaks sarcastically of the \"so-called good old days,\" dominated by the \"so-called Austrian system of Metternich.\" See also the section \"Die gute alte Zeit\" in Rupert Feuchtmiiller and Wilhelm Mrazek, Biedermeier in Osterreich (Vienna: Forum Verlag, I963), 67-70. [Like many style terms used by historians and critics of the arts (among them medieval and baroque), Biedermeier was used initially in a pejorative fashion and was applied to a cultural mileau that was already over. For a native speaker of German, in fact, Biedermeier has inherently comical implications, being a compound of bieder (honest, upright, but also ordinary) and Meier (a family name so common as to lend itself to deprecation and jokes). The introduction of the word bears this out. A collection of poems, riddles, games, and the like for all occasions written by a village schoolmaster came into the hands of the country physician AdolfKussmaul, who found in the materials a potential for hilarious parody. From r855 to I875,\n\n33\n\nVienna in Its European Context\n\nKussmaul, using the pseudonym Gottlieb Biedermaier, published in Munich's Fliegende Blatter his own comical reworkings of the serious efforts of the schoolmaster. Kussmaul was inspired by earlier publication in the same organ of poetry with titles like \"Biedermanns Abendgemiitlichkeit\" (\"Everyman's Evening Pleasures\") and \"Bummelmaiers Klage\" (Bummel implies laziness, sloth, carelessness; Klage means complaint or lament). In 1869 yet another collection of such poetry appeared under the title Biedermaiers Liedenkunst (roughly translatable as The Common Mans Art of\n\nSong). From such precedents Biedermeier took on implications oflack of sophistication, of provincialism, of simple if well-meaning thinking, of pleasure taken in ordinary creature comforts. Only in the twentieth century did the term lose most of its pejorative connotations as a style-critical concept in the arts, being used to denote the culture, in all its facets, of German-speaking Europe (especially southern Germany and Austria) between the close of the Congress of Vienna (1815) and 34\n\nErickson\n\nthe Revolution of 1848.

Schober was a dissolute womanizer and Schubert, although his death was hastened by syphilis, may have engaged in homosexual activity. Schubert's sexuality has been at the center of a stormy musicological controversy for some years, beginning with Maynard Solomon's \"Franz\n\nSchubert and the Peacocks of Benvenuto Cellini,\" Nineteenth-Century Music 12 (1989), 193-206. The first issue of volume 17 (1993) of the same journal was devoted to various opinions on the matter. Gingerich, \"Schubert's Beethoven Project,\" 51-60, finds credible the hypothesis that Schubert was homosexual but does not see this as determining the character and outlook of Schubert's circle. 23.

The journal of the International Franz Schubert-Institut in Vienna, Schubert durch die Brille, has a wide range of information on Schubert research and current events concerning the composer. A short account of Schubert's life within the Viennese context, written for the general reader, is Charles Osborne, Schubert and His Vienna (New York: Knopf, 1985).
