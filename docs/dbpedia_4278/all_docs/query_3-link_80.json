        "text": "Fascism in Germany. Robin Blick 1975\n\nChapter XXIII: The Eighteenth Brumaire of Franz von Papen\n\nWe must admit that even among the revolutionary workers sentiments were expressed to the effect that perhaps after all the Braun – Severing government was a lesser evil than a Hitler – Goebbels government in Prussia. To say the least, this revealed inadequate class consciousness, and for this... we must take responsibility... (Ernst Thälmann, Communist International, Volume 8, no 21, 15 December 1931, p 717)\n\nI have come to know the Reich President as a man in whose word one can trust, a man of pure intentions... (Otto Braun. Prime Minister of Prussia, 10 March 1932)\n\nIt is necessary for us to conquer Prussia. The Prussian State must become once again the bulwark of the national idea, the guardian of the Eastern frontier, threatened by death. (Alfred Hugenberg, 22 March 1932)\n\nThe 10 months that elapsed between the Harzburg rally of October 1931 and Hitler’s abortive bid for the Chancellorship in August 1932 were a period of deepening economic and political crisis for the bourgeoisie, uninterrupted growth for the Nazi Party and continued headlong retreat on the part of the Stalinist and reformist leaders of the working class. This chapter will attempt to analyse each of these three interrelated processes in turn, and to show how they culminated in the 20 July coup of von Papen against the Social Democratic government of Prussia (the same government that the KPD, together with the Nazis, had attempted to bring down the previous summer in the ‘Red Referendum’), and the high-tide of Nazi strength in the Reichstag elections of 31 July, when the NSDAP received 13.7 million votes – 400 000 more than were given to the two workers’ parties.\n\nThroughout the entire capitalist system, industrial production since 1929 had steadily fallen, trade declined and capital investment dwindled to a trickle. From a 1929 peak of 33 024 million dollars, world exports had plunged by more than half to 12 885 million dollars three years later. Over the same period industrial production in Europe had slumped by 30 per cent, while in the USA, where the crisis had originated, the decline was nearer 40 per cent. And in Britain, to take but one example, new capital issues declined by more than 50 per cent between 1930 and 1932. But nowhere was the economic crisis more severe, and its political consequences more cataclysmic, than in Germany. Industrial production had fallen by 40 per cent overall (well above the average for the capitalist world as a whole), but in certain key sectors of the economy, the slump was worse again. Pig iron output fell from 1.1 million metric tons per month in 1929 to 0.33 in 1932, while steel showed a similar drop – 1.35 million to 0.48 million. Machine production, even with the bonus of its Soviet contracts, fell to a mere 38 per cent of its 1929 level. However, we should also note that there were sectors of German industry not so severely hit by the crisis, namely those concerned not with the extraction and processing of raw materials, but with finished goods for the domestic consumer market, where demand, while obviously reduced by the sharp reduction in spending power of the masses, still retained a certain buoyancy. Textile production, for example, had only dropped by around 10 per cent – far less than the average for the German economy as a whole. Neither were the electrical goods industries, food, etc, so severely affected. The light and medium industries were least hit by the world crisis because they produced almost exclusively for the domestic market, while a considerable portion of Ruhr output before the slump was destined for European and overseas markets. Thus the catastrophic shrinkage of world trade that set in from 1929 discriminated more against heavy than light and medium industry. Overall German exports fell from 124.8 (on a base year of 1927) in 1929 to 53.1 in 1932 – once again, a decline of more than half. So as German capitalism moved into its peak crisis year of 1932, the leaders of the economy confronted a series of problems of a magnitude that could only be resolved by the most drastic and brutal of measures. How was production to be stimulated? Where were the capital reserves to be found to initiate a new upturn in the economic cycle? How could production be expanded when everywhere rival imperialist powers were adopting protectionist policies? How could a domestic market be created without permitting labour power a yet larger proportion of the total product? Would not a revival in production so stimulate the demand for labour power that the trade unions would once again step up their demands for higher wages and the restoration of all the social service cuts undertaken by the Brüning administration? And finally, there were political questions whose solution was imperative before any of the preceding economic issues could be resolved. Could the Weimar system (even in the castrated form that it assumed under Brüning) provide the necessary guarantees that the desired economic upturn would not impart a modicum of resistance even to the reformist leaders of the SPD and ADGB, who, during the period of rising unemployment and the growth of National Socialism, had been intimidated into ‘tolerating’ Brüning’s programme of economic and social retrenchment? Could the Social Democrats, so loyal in past crises, be trusted any longer to endorse and implement the counter-revolutionary programme of big business? Or were the proposed ‘reforms’ of such a severe and thoroughgoing nature that not even the most craven of trade union bureaucrats could be expected to acquiesce in their execution? [1] The nature and extent of the attack on working-class living standards envisaged by the monopolies and banks (and one privately endorsed by their Nazi accomplices) was enunciated with cold brutality by the Berliner Börsen Zeitung on 7 June 1932, at a time when millions of German workers, peasants and urban petit-bourgeois had been reduced to pauperism:\n\nCertainly extreme want exists in some places... Nevertheless, in 1931, the standard of food, clothing and housing of the German people taken as a whole was greater than in 1913; but this is incompatible with their very greatly reduced income... This increasingly low level of existence is the only possibility for a revival of production and thereby for the lessening of unemployment. More work and simpler life – this is the unavoidable fate for Germany. [Emphasis added]\n\nUntil 1914, German Social Democracy had been nourished on the sap of a steadily expanding and flourishing capitalism. The outbreak of war found its leaders tying the fate of the movement to the success of the Kaiser’s armies on the battlefields of Europe. There then set in, between 1918 and 1923, a period of social and political turmoil in which the reformist bureaucracy, while always rallying to defend the status quo, had not been obliged to sanction wholesale reductions in the living standards of its millions of supporters in the working class. Indeed, after 1924, a steady rise in wages and an expansion of the welfare budget had enabled the reformists to regain some of the ground lost to the KPD in the previous period of crisis. But now the big bourgeoisie were demanding ‘sacrifices’ far larger than any surrendered by the reformists in the early postwar years. The great historical dilemma confronting the German bourgeoisie, one resolved in spectacular fashion in August 1914 by intimate class-collaboration – with or against the reformist bureaucracy – had been at the heart of every major political controversy since the formation of the Müller government in June 1928. In 1932, the first serious attempts would be made to resolve it in the opposite direction to that of 1914.\n\nThe Bourgeoisie Divided\n\nWe have said, ‘against the reformists’. But in making that momentous decision, the ruling class was not simply dispensing with the service of its loyal servants in the workers’ movement. An end to ‘toleration’ of the Social Democratic bureaucracy, and with it the organisations upon which it rested and drew its privileges, at once posed the question: upon what social bases would the new regime entrusted with implementing the policies of monopoly capitalism rest? Should the banks, agrarians and trusts revert to the bureaucratic-monarchist type of regime that served them so well under Bismarck and Wilhelm II, a government that while exploiting the leverage that a powerful Nazi movement provided against the workers’ parties and the bourgeois liberals, anchored its rule not on the fascist plebeians, but on their own kith and kin of the Reichswehr? Could Brüning’s half-hearted, tentative Bonapartism be transformed into a permanent system of government, which, once it dispensed with parliamentary reliance on the Social Democrats and the toleration of the trade union bureaucracy, would by-pass the Reichstag entirely? Presidential rule, monarchy without a monarch, was seen as the solution by the majority of business leaders right up to the very eve of Hitler’s accession to power. Very much in a minority (albeit a highly influential and vocal one) were those industrialists and bankers such as Thyssen and Schacht who canvassed for the formation of a Hitler cabinet, and even here they still envisaged the real political power remaining in the hands of the Nazis’ bourgeois coalition partners.\n\nThese differences could be masked to a certain extent by the common struggle against the reformists, whose removal from all positions of political and economic influence united the entire National Opposition, and even those in the Centre Party who on other issues were prepared to side with Brüning. But when it came to the point of actually implementing the policies and principles jointly agreed on at Bad Harzburg, the factional struggle between the advocates of a Bonapartist or ‘Presidential’ solution and the supporters of a governmental bloc with the Nazis flared out into the open. The immediate issue which provoked the conflict was the choice of a new President, elections for which were due in the spring of 1932. Around this question there crystallised not two groupings in the bourgeoisie, but three: the Nazis, who at the last moment put forward Hitler as their candidate; the monarchists, represented by Duesterberg; and the bourgeois supporters of Brüning, who came out for a renewed term of office for Hindenburg (the question of the SPD’s endorsement of Hindenburg’s candidature is discussed further on in this chapter).\n\nInitially, Hitler had not intended to run as a candidate in the Presidential elections. Towards the end of 1931, he proposed a deal whereby in return for Nazi acquiescence in another term for the octogenarian marshal, Hindenburg was to effect the dismissal of Chancellor Brüning, whose continued reliance on the Social Democrats blocked the road to the formation of a ‘national’ government, the last step but one before the final triumph of the Nazis. That Hindenburg himself would have favoured the first stage of this development is clear from his letter of 15 February 1932, to his close friend Friedrich von Berg, explaining the reasons for the failure of the right-wing parties and leaders to unite behind a single candidate. Much embarrassed by the support given to him by the Social Democrats, Hindenburg protested:\n\n... the allegation that I am opposed to a rightist government is entirely false. I did not put any obstacle in the path of such a development, nor did Chancellor Brüning. It was the disunity of the right, its inability to agree even on the main points. It is most regrettable that the right – torn as it is – is being led into insignificance and self-destruction by leaders one-sidedly concerned with their party political ambitions. Whether and when this state of affairs will change none can tell... Despite all these setbacks, I shall not give up all my efforts to further a healthy development toward the right. I hope that it will be possible after the Prussian elections [scheduled for 24 April, a month after the Presidential elections]... to resume the negotiations about the formation of a National government of concentration. [Emphasis added]\n\nBy ‘leaders one-sidedly concerned with their party political ambitions’ Hindenburg had in mind first of all Hitler, who, at meetings with Schleicher and Brüning on 6 and 7 January respectively, had turned down their compromise solution to the crisis over the Presidential elections. They had proposed to Hitler that the Reichstag extend Hindenburg’s term, thus avoiding the damaging splits and controversies concerning his re-election. In return, Brüning promised to stand down from the Chancellorship to make way for a government of the type favoured by Hindenburg – a cabinet of ‘national concentration’ which dispensed with the support of the Social Democrats and even the sanction of the Reichstag. Hitler would have none of this plan, since its Bonapartist purpose was not only to exclude the SPD, but to deny any direct governmental influence to the Nazis. Instead he demanded new elections to the Reichstag in return, not for an extension of Hindenburg’s term, but Presidential elections in which the entire right-wing bloc would campaign and vote for Hindenburg.\n\nNeither Brüning nor his critics in the Hugenberg wing of the National Opposition had any desire to match their waning mass support against the Nazis in an election contest. The inevitable Nazi landslide would enormously enhance Hitler’s bargaining power in any future negotiations over the formation of a ‘national’ cabinet, and expose the old bourgeois parties as officers without armies. Schleicher’s turn towards collaboration with the Nazis was not intended to draw them into the government – certainly not at this stage – but to exploit their mass appeal among the nationalist petit-bourgeoisie as a counterweight to the reformists and the working class as a whole. As he confided to Brüning’s defence Minister Gröner on 23 March 1932, shortly before the latter’s dismissal, ‘if there were no Nazis, it would be necessary to invent them’. But Hitler’s was a movement in its own right, and was not so easily subordinated to Schleicher’s political ploys as the General would have liked. Following the deadlock with Brüning and Schleicher, Hitler now sought – and gained – an audience with the President himself. What he proposed both astounded and outraged the ageing aristocrat. Hitler would indeed endorse Hindenburg’s Presidential candidature if, in return, Hindenburg would dismiss Brüning and appoint Hitler as the Chancellor of a ‘national’ cabinet. On 12 January, Hitler received official word from the President that his deal had been rejected, that for all his leniency towards the Social Democrats, Brüning was to stay – at least for the duration of the Presidential election campaign and pending the outcome of the crucial election in Prussia. Now Hitler faced the most important political decision of his career. Should he accept the humiliation inflicted on him and his movement, and either tacitly or openly endorse Hindenburg’s candidature; or should he maintain the offensive by running himself for the Presidency, risking defeat and consequent internal strife? Either course was fraught with dangers, since to acquiesce in the election of a President who enjoyed not only liberal bourgeois but Social Democratic backing exposed his leadership to fresh attacks from the Nazi ‘radicals’ and other volkisch dissidents, while to engage in an open fight against the man whom almost the entire bourgeoisie and agrarians regarded as the symbol of ‘national’ Germany would, temporarily at the very least, alienate all but the most fanatical of his supporters and financiers in the business world, and at the precise time when he needed their political and economic assistance more than ever before. The dilemma that faced Hitler at the beginning of 1932 was, in essence, that which had plagued all his attempts to build a mass-based movement of counter-revolution – how simultaneously to protect and strengthen his links with the ruling class while extending the base of his movement amongst the plebeians. Small wonder that the decision whether to run for the Presidency was not taken for a full month.\n\nHitler’s indecision is reflected faithfully in the diary entries of his propaganda chief Goebbels. On 19 January, he is discussing ‘the question of the presidency with the Führer’ and recording that ‘no decision has yet been reached’, while at the end of the month Hitler’s candidacy is seen as depending on ‘what the Social Democrats do’. [2] Even as late as 9 February with the elections now only a month away, Goebbels notes that after a ‘new debate [with Hitler] on the Presidential elections, everything is still in the air’. The announcement that Hindenburg is to stand again for the Presidency draws from Goebbels the cautious response that ‘now we have a free hand’, [3] but to do what? Three days later the Hugenberg monarchists announce their candidate Duesterberg – but even now, with two rivals in the field, Hitler baulks at joining them. Only on 22 February, after weeks of soul-searching, is Goebbels finally given permission to announce Hitler’s candidacy, to a mass Nazi rally at the Berlin Sportspalast.\n\nSo there were now no fewer than three candidates representing various sectors of the ruling class. Around Hindenburg were grouped not merely the wretched reformist bureaucrats, who depicted the unrepentant monarchist as a bulwark of republican legality, but some of the biggest names in German industry and banking. While the Ruhr interests in the main opted either for Hugenberg’s stooge Duesterberg, or in rarer cases Hitler, we find such firms traditionally associated with a more liberal policy such as von Siemens and IG Farben still clinging to the shadow of the Weimar ‘grand coalition’, now ironically personified by the man dedicated to its destruction. Hindenburg was only too aware of his own contradictory position, and on several occasions attempted to pacify his bemused and discountenanced allies in the national camp by explaining that his acceptance of Social Democratic and liberal support was a lesser evil when compared with the disasters that might ensue from a direct confrontation between candidates representing the polarised forces of revolution and counter-revolution. He was, he claimed in a radio address on 10 March, the candidate of national unity and class harmony:\n\nI cannot believe that Germany is to be plunged into domestic feuds and civil war. I recall to you the spirit of 1914 and the front-line attitude which was concerned with the man and not with his social status or his party... I will not give up the hope that Germany will come together again in the new unity.\n\nThe next day, Hindenburg issued a statement repudiating charges that he was in any sense a candidate of the left, an accusation that must have outraged this relic of Hohenzollern Germany:\n\nHad I declined, the danger would have arisen that at the second ballot either the candidate of the extreme right or of the extreme left would have been elected. It was false that I have accepted my candidature from the hands of the left or from a black-red [Centre-SPD] coalition. All classes of the population have combined to offer it to me. I would have refused to be the candidate of a party or group of parties.\n\nUnease about the unpredictable alignments occasioned by the Presidential elections extended beyond the highly heterogeneous Hindenburg bloc. Hitler realised that his chosen strategy of assuming power legally required, at some stage in the future, a deal with Hindenburg and the political advisers grouped around him. Under the Weimar Constitution, it was the President that appointed the Chancellor. So long as Hitler sought power by this route, he was obliged to observe its conventions. So Hitler also found himself compelled to justify his candidature – not to his millions of plebeian followers, who were delighted to see their Führer cock a snook at the ‘united front’ of superannuated monarchists, plutocrats and ‘Jewish Bolsheviks’ – but to his present or potential supporters in the business world, who must have found his tactics divisive and exasperating in the extreme. This he did in an open letter addressed to Hindenburg, expressing profound regret that he could not agree to Brüning’s proposal to avoid the contest by extending the President’s term of office: ‘Old man, we honour you too much to suffer that those whom we want to destroy should use you as a front. We are sorry, but you must step aside, for they want to fight, and so do we.’\n\nAt the first ballot, with the SPD machine working in top gear on his behalf, Hindenburg failed by a mere 0.4 per cent to secure the required majority. Full returns were: (in millions) Hindenburg: 18.6; Hitler: 11.3; Thälmann: 5.0; Duesterberg: 2.6. Quite apart from the continued upwards surge of the Nazis – from 6.7 million votes in September 1931 to 11.3 million 18 months later – there is the incredible fact that the open candidates of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat received between them only 20 per cent of the total poll. The bulk of the workers had been dragged by their leaders – in most cases against their better class instincts – behind the ‘non-class’ and ‘national’ camp of Hindenburg, leaving the Stalinists with a mere five million proletarian votes, while Duesterberg, the candidate of the Ruhr and the East Prussian agrarians, could barely secure half of this sum. The nationalist masses had deserted the National Opposition monarchists for Hitler, attracted by the latter’s counter-revolutionary dynamism and social demagogy. This contradiction was partly resolved on the second ballot, when the Hugenberg faction withdrew Duesterberg and instructed their supporter’s to vote for Hitler, suggesting that the Harzburg Front still maintained a modicum of inner unity when confronted by the common enemy. [4] As the ultra-nationalist Deutsche Zeitung put it: ‘... the present issue is whether the internationalist traitors and pacifist swine, with the approval of Hindenburg, are to bring about the final ruin of Germany.’ And the paper was referring not to the supporters of Thälmann, but the Social Democrats, bourgeois democrats and Catholics behind Hindenburg!\n\nAs expected, in the second ballot held on 10 April, Hindenburg emerged the clear victor, even though the bulk of the Duesterberg vote – and a far smaller slice of that of Thälmann, who stood once again – went to Hitler. The final returns were: Hindenburg: 19.4 million (53 per cent); Hitler: 13.4 million (36.8 per cent) and Thälmann: 3.7 million (10.2 per cent). So in his first serious trial of strength with the Weimar bloc, Hitler had received a serious setback. Moreover, electoral defeat involved Hitler and the Nazi high command in fresh internal disputes over the question of tactics and strategy. On the eve of the first poll, anticipating victory, Röhm had deployed several hundred thousand SA men around Berlin, a move which not only alarmed the legal rulers of Germany, but Hitler, since he had no intention of repeating on a national scale the error and disaster of the 1923 Munich Putsch. The SA remained at full battle stations up to the day of the run-off ballot, indicating that the SA leadership had refused to acquiesce in Hitler’s ‘constitutional’ path towards power. Goebbels, the ex-'radical’, understood well the forces that were activating the SA ranks, but, as one of Hitler’s closest confidants, knew that the time had not come to harness them for the task of dismembering the workers’ movement. First, the Nazis had to gain a foothold in the government, and a premature ‘putsch’ would ruin the prospects of such a development. As he noted on 2 April:\n\nThe SA getting impatient. It is understandable enough that the soldiers begin to lose morale through these long, drawn-out political contests. It has to be stopped, though, at all costs. A premature push, or worse still, an overt gesture of compulsion would nullify the whole of our future. [5]\n\nBearing in mind that the Hitler strategy for power visualised as the intermediate stage between Brüning and a Nazi regime the formation of a ‘national’ government, with National Socialist support, we can understand Goebbels’ alarm at the prospect of an SA revolt. At all costs, the movement’s links with the ‘national’ opposition to Brüning and Weimar had to be preserved, especially at a time when relations between the party and the army, after years of mutual hostility, had on a joint initiative of Schleicher and Röhm begun to improve. Yet Hitler could not afford to move too openly or harshly against his SA ‘radicals’ for the day was not far off when he would summon them for the final battle against the organised proletariat.\n\nHitler was saved from the embarrassment of once again calling his plebeians to order by the action of the Brüning government, which, in the wake of Hindenburg’s election victory, moved quickly to impose a ban on all paramilitary formations of the NSDAP. Although opposed by Schleicher (who, as has been noted, valued the Nazis as a counterweight to the reformists and the organised working-class movement), Brüning and his Defence Minister Gröner succeeded in persuading Hindenburg to sign the decree outlawing the SA, which became law on 14 April.\n\nBrüning’s stroke against the SA initially stunned the Nazi leadership, and superficially appeared to strengthen his own position. But in a matter of weeks, even days, it became evident that it had accelerated his own political demise.\n\nThe Fall of Brüning\n\nBonapartism as a species of state power can present an outward face of strength and stability. It embodies the extreme centralisation of state authority, the usurpation of the legislature and the party-political system, and, more often than not, involves the direct intervention of the armed forces and the police in the formulation of government policy. Hence the appearance of stability, of independence from the turmoil associated with a parliamentary regime in crisis, and from the sectional interests which those parties seek to represent. But herein also lies the organic instability of Bonapartism. Arising on the basis of a temporary social and political equilibrium between the classes and within the various contending factions of the ruling class, and in attempting to maintain this equilibrium ‘administratively’, by regulating social conflicts and political divisions, it necessarily inherits, in an ever more acute fashion, all the contradictions which have undermined the more normal forms of bourgeois rule, and prepared the ground for the rise of Bonapartism. Resting on this temporary and precarious social equilibrium, and consequently also deriving its partial political independence from the ruling class from this mutual counter-balancing, the Bonapartist regime will immediately be threatened by any shift, however slight, in the relative strength of the contending forces at the base. Brüning’s was a regime which from the autumn of 1930, when it placed its continued survival in the hands of the SPD, leaned to the left on the reformist bureaucracy, and, through this stratum, on the millions of workers who remained tied to it – largely as a result of the criminally adventurist policies of the KPD Stalinists. But although inclining to the left, where it found a degree of mass support mediated through the reformists that Brüning himself lacked, his regime also sought to extend its base to the right, beyond the bourgeois liberals, the Centre politicians and the German hierarchy, through the defectors from the Hugenberg nationalists even as far as attempting to effect a working compromise with the Nazis. Such a deal, even assuming that Hitler would honour his side of the bargain by not striving for a monopoly of power, was however impossible so long as Brüning continued to lean on the reformists. Brüning needed their ‘toleration’; Hitler their annihilation. Brüning used the Nazi threat to club the trade union and SPD bureaucrats into submission, but also saw in it his own political death. Thus we find Brüning throughout his two years of office pursuing a political course which, while oscillating in both directions, back-tracked consistently towards the left and the reformists who held in their hands the fate of his regime.\n\nIt is of the very nature of Bonapartist governments that they attempt to ‘freeze’ social and political relations, that they attempt to preserve the equilibrium of social forces that first brought them to power. But the world economic crisis did not ‘freeze’ at its March 1930 level, and, consequently, neither did its most acute manifestations in Germany. The deepening of these economic and social tensions arising from the world crisis found its expression on the political-parliamentary plane in the far too slow growth of the KPD at the expense of the SPD to Brüning’s left, and the continued explosive upsurge of National Socialism to his right. In September 1930, 6.7 million voters opted for the Nazis. By April 1932, this number doubled, while the combined strength of the workers’ parties over the same period had slightly declined. These profound dislocations of the political equilibrium that produced Brüning’s semi-Bonapartist government, with its reliance on Social Democratic support in the Reichstag on the one hand, and Hindenburg’s endorsement of his decrees on the other, were already subjecting the Chancellor to unendurable pressures and tensions. Hence the ban on the SA. But what finally brought Brüning down was the shift at the top, in the bourgeoisie itself, in the army leadership and amongst the agrarians, away from Brüning’s policy of maintaining the semblance of the old Weimar bloc, based on the compromise enacted in the wake of the November Revolution between the Centre, the SPD and the now-defunct bourgeois democrats.\n\nWriting in January 1932, Trotsky characterised the Brüning regime as one which danced:\n\n... on a tightrope between two irreconcilable camps, balancing itself with the emergency decrees instead of a pole. But such a condition of the state and the administration is temporary in character. It signalises the transition period, during which the Social Democracy is on the verge of exhausting its mission, while in that same period, neither Communism nor fascism is ready as yet to seize power. [6]\n\nBut Brüning’s fragile semi-Bonapartism was not the final transitional regime before the establishment of fascism or the seizure of power by the proletariat. Using the analogy of the Russia of 1917, the transition to each of these conclusions would be opened by a ‘Kerensky’ government, either of the left, or of the right. Such was the intended function of the von Papen regime, installed with Nazi support, and ‘tolerated’ by Hitler as long as Papen performed his allotted role of beating back the organised proletariat and hounding the reformist bureaucrats from their last redoubts in the state and government apparatus of Prussia. The first blows against Brüning had of course been struck as far back as October 1931, when a highly influential group of bankers and industrialists repudiated his policy of piecemeal economic and social ‘reforms’ and opted for the more radical programme advocated by Schacht and Thyssen. The result was their participation in the Harzburg rally of the National Opposition. Brüning then sought to adapt to this pressure from the right, by restructuring his cabinet and introducing yet more cuts in wages and welfare payments. But there were limits to the attacks Brüning could unleash on the working class without risking an open split with the reformist bureaucracy which supported his regime from the left, and the most reactionary sections of big business were aware of them. Resistance to further attacks on the living conditions of the working class came even from within Brüning’s own party, which, as we have noted, comprised a potentially unstable bloc of clerical, bourgeois and Catholic trade union elements. Minister of Labour Stegerwald, a prominent Catholic trade union official, issued a public warning to profit-hungry employers that their greed might provoke the proletariat into open rebellion unless they agreed to curb it. On 27 November 1931, with new deflationary measures by the cabinet due to be enacted on 8 December, he declared:\n\nThe withdrawal of the protection of wages, which has been demanded by the employers, would be very tactless under the present circumstances and would cause political disturbances on a large scale. A certain protection of wages in Germany will be an absolute necessity for the next few years.\n\nThe effect of Brüning’s decree was to reduce all wage rates to the level of 1927, while the budget showed a reduction of 25 per cent on the previous financial year as a result of the Chancellor’s cuts in social services. Yet still the monopolies and banks were not satisfied, even when the same Stegerwald boasted to a meeting of the Centre Party in Munster on 8 December that ‘an attack has been made by the Reich’s government not only on wages but also on prices to an extent unknown in the history of any other modern state’, even claiming that Brüning ‘has in many respects gone farther than Mussolini did in Italy years ago’.\n\nWhile this statement spoke volumes for the real class nature and intent of ‘social catholicism’, it cut precious little ice with the leaders of heavy industry, who were now passing over to the side of the National Opposition. They correctly saw in Mussolini’s fascist corporate state not only a regime which served capital by cutting wages and reducing social services (the National Government of Ramsey Macdonald was implementing the same programme in Britain), but which went further than any other reactionary bourgeois government by physically destroying the organisations which the proletariat had built to defend itself against such attacks. This was the appeal of fascism to the big bourgeoisie, and Brüning, for all his decrees and emergency measures, and despite all Stalinist claims to the contrary, could not institute such a system. Hence the gravitation of big business away from Brüning, through the monarchists and eventually, after a period of experimentation with the Bonapartist regimes of von Papen and Schleicher, into a bloc with the Nazis.\n\nAlthough serious negotiations between Hitler and leaders of big business date from the early crisis months of 1930, the final decision to endorse the formation of a Nazi-led cabinet of ‘National Concentration’ was not made by the main representatives of industry and finance until the early days of 1933. A turning point in this process of the coming together of the monopolies and fascism was reached in January 1932, when Hitler delivered his speech to the assembled Ruhr tycoons of the Düsseldorf Industry Club. [7]\n\nThyssen says of this speech, made in the Park Hotel on 27 January 1932, and lasting some two-and-a-half hours, that it ‘made a deep impression on the assembled industrialists and in consequence of this a number of large contributions flowed from the resources of heavy industry into the treasuries of the National Socialist Party’, [8] a claim supported from within the Nazi movement by Otto Dietrich, who writes:\n\nThe twenty-seventh of January 1932 will always remain a memorable day in the history of the NSDAP. On this day, our leader succeeded in piercing the armour of the West German industrial magnates. On this evening, Hitler achieved decisive success in the Industrial Club in Düsseldorf. [9]\n\nThe Nazi press chief sets the scene for what was to be one of Hitler’s most decisive political speeches:\n\nWe came from Godesberg, and drove up to the Park Hotel, amidst the hooting of the Marxists. The room was overcrowded. Huddled together sat the chief West German magnates. There were familiar and unfamiliar faces. Men in the public eye, and those quiet, but no less influential powers, who moving behind the scenes, control the fate of the economy by the soft sounds issuing from their private offices. Joyful expectation brightened the faces of those already converted. But the vast majority bore an air of superiority and cold reserve – probably flattered that Hitler had approached them. Mere curiosity, and general interest, lured them to the meeting. They wanted to hear Hitler speak. They had no intention of being converted; they came to criticise, seeking confirmation of their own infallible opinion. [10]\n\nHitler’s speech dealt at some length with a number of familiar Nazi themes – the incompatibility of parliamentary democracy and an organised and independent workers’ movement with the continued existence of German monopoly capitalism; the need for imperialist ‘living space’ in the Soviet east; the impossibility of rebuilding Germany’s military and economic strength until Marxism and the last vestiges of internationalism had been ripped out of the proletariat, and finally the unavoidable necessity of the ‘plebeian’ solution to the political and economic problems of the bourgeoisie, however distasteful this might be to exponents of more genteel forms of political struggle:\n\nPrivate property can be morally and ethically justified only if I admit that men’s achievements are different. Only on that basis can I assert: since men’s achievements are different, the results of those achievements are also different. But if the results of those achievements are different, then it is reasonable to leave to men the administration of those results to a corresponding degree... Thus it must be admitted that in the economic sphere, from the start, in all branches men are not of equal value or of equal importance. And once this is admitted it is madness to say: in the economic sphere there are undoubtedly differences in value, but that is not true in the political sphere. It is absurd to build up economic life on the conceptions of achievement, of the value of personality, while in the political sphere you deny this authority, and thrust in its place the law of the greatest number – democracy. In that case there must slowly arise a cleavage between the economic life on the conceptions of achievement, of the value of personality, while in the political sphere you deny this authority, an attempt will be made to assimilate the former into the latter – indeed, the attempt has been made, for this cleavage has not remained bare pale theory. The conception of the quality of values has already, not only in politics but in economics also, been raised to a system... This economic system is alive in gigantic organisations [that is, those of the German working class – RB] and it has already today inspired a state which rules over immense areas [the USSR].\n\nBut I cannot regard as possible that the life of a people should in the long run be based on two fundamental conceptions... It is absurd to allow this principle to hold good only in one sphere – the sphere of economic life and leadership – and to refuse to acknowledge its vitality in the sphere of politics... In the economic sphere Communism is analogous to democracy in the political sphere. We find ourselves today in a period in which these two fundamental principles are at grips in all spheres which come into contact with each other; already they are invading economics... This struggle will continue until a nation is finally engulfed in internationalism and democracy and thereby falls into complete disintegration, or else creates for itself once more a new logical form for its internal life [that is, a fascist dictatorship – RB] ... For 50 years you may amass wealth, and then in three years of mistaken political decisions you can destroy all the results of the work of those 50 years ['very true’ from the audience]... We see that since the world war there was no further important extension of export markets: on the contrary, we see the numbers of those export markets contracted, that the number of exporting nations gradually increased, and that a great number of former export markets became themselves industrialised, while finally a new wholesale exporter, the American Union, can reckon on advantages which we in Europe assuredly do not and cannot possess. And as the last momentous feature we regard the fact that, parallel with the gradual growth of confusion in Europe, a world outlook has seized on a part of Europe and a great part of Asia which threatens to tear this continent out of the framework of international economic relations altogether... Cannot people see that in our midst already a cleavage has been opened up... which is not merely a fancy born in the heads of a few persons but whose spiritual exponents form today the foundations of one of the greatest world powers? Can they not see that Bolshevism today is not merely a mob storming about in some of our streets in Germany, but is a conception of the world which is in the act of subjecting to itself the entire Asiatic continent? ... Bolshevism, if its advance is not interrupted, will transform the world as completely as in time past did Christianity... it is not as if this gigantic phenomenon could simply be thought away from the modern world... Do you believe that when seven or eight million men have found themselves for 10 or 20 years excluded from the national process of production that for these masses Bolshevism could appear as anything else than the logical theoretical complement of their practical, economic situation? ...\n\nThere has arisen such an increase in productive capacity that the present possible consumption market stands in no relation to this increased capacity. But if Bolshevism as a world idea tears the Asiatic continent out of the human economic community, then the conditions for the employment of these industries which have developed on so gigantic a scale will no longer be even approximately realised... it was not German business that conquered the world, followed by the development of power, but the power-state which created for the business world the general conditions for its subsequent prosperity ['very true’ from the audience]. There is only one solution – the realisation that there can be no flourishing economic life which has not before it and behind it a flourishing, powerful state as its protection... There can be no economic life unless behind this economic life there stands the determined political will of the nation ready to strike – and strike hard... The essential thing is the formation of the political will of the nation, that is the starting point for political action...\n\nWhat use is it for a government to publish a decree with the aim of saving the people’s economic life, when the nation... has two completely different attitudes towards economics? One section says: the precondition for economics is private property; the other section maintains that private property is theft... You may raise the objection that these views represent pure theory: no! Was a view only theory when as its consequence the revolution broke out in 1918 and ruined Germany? ... I believe that such views, unless we give a clear understanding of them, must lead to the disruption of the body politic... the government says, the state must be saved, but another 50 per cent of the people wish only to smash the state in pieces and feel themselves to be the vanguard not only of an alien attitude towards the state... but of a will which is hostile to the state... It is no good appealing for national unity when only 50 per cent of the people are ready to fight for the national colours, while 50 per cent have hoisted another flag which stands for a state which is to be found only outside the bounds of their own state... How is a people still to count for anything abroad when in the last resort 50 per cent are inclined to Bolshevism and 50 per cent are nationalists or anti-Bolshevists? It is quite inconceivable to turn Germany into a Bolshevist state... It is also quite conceivable to build up Germany as a national state. But it is conceivable that one should create a strong and sound Germany if 50 per cent of the citizens are Bolshevists and 50 per cent nationally minded ['very true!’ from the audience]. From the solution of this problem we cannot escape [loud applause]...\n\nFor even though today there are many in Germany who believe that we National Socialists would not be capable of constructive work, they deceive themselves! If we were not, already today there would be no more bourgeoisie alive in Germany, the question of Bolshevism or not Bolshevism would have long ago been decided. Take the weight of our organisations, by far the greatest organisation of the new Germany – out of scale of nationalist fortunes and you will see that without us, Bolshevism would already tip the balance – a fact of which the best proof is the attitude adopted towards us by Bolshevism. Personally I regard it as a great honour when Mr Trotsky calls upon German Communists at any price to act together with the Social Democrats, since National Socialism must be regarded as the one real danger for Bolshevism...\n\nHere [in the NSDAP] is an organisation which is filled with an indomitable, aggressive spirit, an organisation which when a political opponent says ‘Your behaviour we regard as a provocation’ does not see fit immediately to retire from the scene, but brutally enforces its own will and hurls against the opponent the retort: ‘We fight today! We fight tomorrow! And if you regard our meeting today as a provocation we shall hold another next week – until you have learned that it is no provocation when Germany also proves its belief...’ And when people cast in our teeth our intolerance, we proudly acknowledge it – yes, we have formed the inexorable decision to destroy Marxism in Germany down to its very last root. The bourgeois parties had 70 years to work in; where, I ask you, where is the organisation which could be compared with ours? Where is the organisations which can boast, as ours can, that at need it can summon 400 000 men into the street, men who are schooled to blind obedience and are ready to execute any order...?\n\nI know quite well, gentlemen, that when National Socialists march through the streets and suddenly in the evening there arises a great tumult and commotion, then the bourgeois draws back the window curtain, looks out and says: Once more my night’s rest disturbed... Why must the Nazis always be so provocative and run about the place at night? Gentlemen, if everyone thought like that, then one’s sleep would not be disturbed, it is true. But then the bourgeois today could not venture into the streets... [emphasis added]\n\nDietrich records the changing reactions of the audience to this remarkable speech:\n\nThe general impression upon this group of most impassive listeners was astounding. After an hour, their chilly reserve gave way to intense interest. They began to flush, fixed their gaze upon our leader and it seemed as if their hearts were moved. He spoke to their very souls. Faint, then thundering applause greet Hitler at the conclusion of his speech; he had won a battle. [11]\n\nHitler’s place at the speaker’s rostrum (which throughout his address was flanked by a guard of SA men) was then taken by Thyssen, ‘for long an ardent National Socialist’ who ‘sounded Brüning’s death knell as he stated our creed of Liberation: Only National Socialism and its Leader’s spirit could save Germany from her doom.’ [12]\n\nEven if the National Opposition found itself divided in the approaching Presidential elections, a considerable degree of agreement was evident in business circles over the dire need to remove the ‘Marxist'-tolerated Brüning government. Here Hitler’s pledge to destroy the German workers’ movement ‘down to its very last root’ placed him in an advantageous tactical position for the political battles to come. As Dietrich (not only Hitler’s press chief, but an important liaison man between the party and heavy industry) observed, ‘the effect [of the speech] upon the economists... was great, and evident during the next hard months of struggle’. [13] And in fact the very day after his Düsseldorf triumph, Hitler:\n\n... addressed with equal success the Crefeld silk magnates in Godesberg, [and] later the National Club in Hamburg. Everywhere the scene was the same. Our leader’s power of conviction and his indefatigable pioneer work successfully pierced the armour of economy. His plan succeeded... The seed of National Socialism had found fertile soil in the important and influential circles of the old system. The clouds began to gather around Brüning. [14]\n\nAlso on the day following the Düsseldorf meeting there was held at Thyssen’s castle at Landsberg a conference between Thyssen, Ernst Pönsgen and Albert Vögler of the Steel Trust, and on behalf of the NSDAP, Hitler, Goering and Röhm. According to a later account of the meeting given by Pönsgen, Goering asked the three steel barons whether they would support the appointment, as Hitler’s Minister of Labour, of Ludwig Grauert, Chairman of the Employers’ Federation and a recent convert to the Nazi cause. The outcome of these negotiations proved abortive (the Stahlhelm leader Franz Seldte, and not Grauert, became Labour Minister in the Nazi – Nationalist coalition of January 1933), but they did reveal on the part of a powerful section of the monopoly bourgeoisie a growing awareness that at some time in the near future, the question of bringing the Nazis into the government would have to be faced up to, before the movement lost its forward impetus and its effectiveness as a counter-weight to the workers’ parties and the trade unions. Thyssen (by this time a party member) made no attempt to conceal his political sympathies for the NSDAP in the forthcoming Presidential elections. ‘I am voting for Adolf Hitler’, he announced, ‘because I know him well and am firmly convinced that he is the only man who can and will rescue Germany from ruin and disintegration.’\n\nThe prospects of ruin and disintegration, though on a company and not national scale, were also instrumental in propelling towards the Nazis another illustrious name in the German steel industry – Friedrich Flick. Early in 1932, Vögler, Chairman of Flick’s United Steel Works, secretly informed the German civil service that the concern would shortly collapse unless it was provided with considerable credits. The effect on the German economy would of course have been disastrous since the United Steel Works accounted, in 1932, for 38 per cent of all German steel output. [15] The immediate cause of the crisis in the Flick combine was, of course, the world economic situation, with its attendant slump in demand for the products of basic and heavy industries. But Flick’s own methods of trust-building also contributed to the near-bankruptcy that faced him in early 1932. His system of securing control over nominally independent companies by acquiring in them a minority but controlling interest, had seriously depleted his own liquidity reserves, a policy whose dangerous implications were masked, but not overcome, by the period of industrial expansion between 1924 and 1928.\n\nThe plight of the Steel Trust was accurately reflected in the last quotation for its shares on the Berlin Bourse at the end of 1931. On their flotation, Steel Trust shares stood at 125 per cent of their nominal value. Now they barely fetched 15 per cent. The Brüning government therefore had no alternative but to pump fresh reserves into the foundering concern; buying up roughly half of its stock (worth nominally 125 million marks) not at the market price, but for 100 million marks – 90 per cent of their face value, and more than five times the price they could command on the Berlin Bourse. Flick and his associates acquired the liquid funds necessary to avert bankruptcy, and the state became a temporary part-owner of Germany’s largest concern. The question which remained to be settled was – to whom would the ownership of the state’s shares revert, and at what price, when the time came for private industry to claim its own? In common with not only his fellow directors of the United Steel Works, but large sectors of heavy industry, Flick had, by the beginning of 1932 at the latest, come to regard the participation of the Nazis in a future ‘national’ government almost inevitable. The NSDAP leadership would, therefore, have their own views on how the affairs of the Steel Trust should be resolved, and in whose favour. Accordingly, through the good offices of Walter Funk, Flick met Hitler in February 1932 to discuss this and other, broader problems concerned with future political developments in Germany. Though this meeting was Flick’s first encounter with the Nazis, his private secretary Otto Steinbrinck had been in touch with the NSDAP since 1930. And at the Nuremberg Trials he explained why, in a remarkable lucid and class-conscious manner:\n\nA concern of the importance of Flick’s group cannot stay out of politics in the long run, although until about 1930, we took no notice of politics [Flick himself was a not very active supporter of the DVP – RB], particularly in view of the fact that we had close connections with the United Steel Works and through the leading members of the United Steel Works had a series of contacts with parliament and the press. When the crisis of 1931-32 began, this picture changed. In connection with the problem of unemployment the difficulties among the parties of the Left, that is the Communists and the Socialists, increased and correspondingly the movement of the groups of the Right were increased too. One has to consider that our plants were situated in the most radical territories of the Reich; that is Saxony... This district has always been one of the reddest parts of Germany, and the plants Brandenburg and Hennigsdorf, very close to Berlin, were almost on the same level as this Red Saxony. That’s why our plant managements in these plants... were rather worried because the same troubles which we had experienced eight years previously might revive again... Consequently we observed the formation of radical groups, as well as of independent groups and also the formation of opposed groups. Those were the Stahlhelm, later the SA and the SS, and also the more central groups, the Iron Front [the SPD-dominated Republican Defence organisation, formed in the spring of 1932 – RB]. All of these movements we watched with great interest from Berlin and from the plants. That was one reason for our first contact with politics. Up to that time, wherever interesting political questions turned up we had always been able to rely on the support of Baron von Richthofen in the parties of the centre, and in the parties of the right on Vögler, Hugenberg and Dr Reichart. [16]\n\nThe affairs of the Flick concern had become such a public scandal by 1931 that the company had become a target for demagogic attacks by the Nazi press, and it was in order to silence Flick’s fascist critics that Steinbrinck made his first serious approach to the NSDAP, though he had met Ley, Funk and Keppler during the course of the previous year. Steinbrinck met the aristocratic Berlin SA chief Count Heldorf in order to secure a better press for the ailing Steel Trust. In return, Steinbrinck agreed to take part ‘in an open rally as listener on the benches of the NSDAP’, [17] and later, to provide cash for the party treasury (much depleted by the two Presidential election campaigns of March and April 1932). Steinbrinck’s other channel of communication to the Nazi leadership went through Funk’s business news service: ‘In this way we first made contact with Robert Ley and Count Reischach, who were the press representatives for the party.’ [18] Funk he had known well since 1928, and it was Hitler’s future Economics Minister who arranged the meeting between Hitler and Flick in February 1932. Of these initial contacts with the Nazis, Steinbrinck stated that they had the full approval of Flick himself. There was no question of their being broken off, ‘because in 1932, in the big economic crisis, there was still the very grave danger of a Communist revolution, which... could only be stopped by the right-wing parties, Stahlhelm, SA’. [19]\n\nSteinbrinck says little of the meeting between Flick and Hitler, merely that his chief ‘had a long private chat’ with the Nazi leader. Some agreement does seem to have been reached, however, on the policy a future Nazi government would adopt towards the Steel Trust. For in a later series of discussions with Goering, Flick secured Hitler’s approval of the sale of the trust’s shares to the Brüning Government, as was established some eight years later in a letter from Odilo Burkart, a Nazi industrialist, to Mining Director Dr Gillitzer. Dated 17 September 1940, the letter stated:\n\nWith respect to the sale of the Stahlverein majority shares Herr Flick has asked me to inform you officially as follows: ‘The sale of the majority shares in the Stahlverein had been personally examined and sanctioned at the time – in the year 1932 by the present Reich Marshal [Goering] in conference, at the Belle Vue Strasse which lasted several days. The Reich Marshal has further personally reported the transaction relating to the majority shares of the Stahlverein to the Führer with the result that the Führer has also recognised this transaction as necessary and has explicitly approved it.’ [20]\n\nAlthough occasioned by exceptional circumstances, and being something in the nature of an insurance policy, Flick’s cautious move towards the Nazis was part of a general rightwards shift against Brüning under way in the winter and spring months of 1932. Keppler was in the early stages of forming his ‘circle’ at this time, having been told in December 1931 by Hitler ‘to get a few economic leaders – they need not be party members – who will be at our disposal when we come to power’. [21] Fellow Nazi manufacturer Fritz Kranefuss assisted him in this work, ‘winning for my idea men whom I had not previously known personally’, [22] to such good effect that by May the circle was large and sympathetic enough to hold its first meeting. Keppler related that:\n\n... the Führer received the gentlemen in the small hall of the Kaiserhof [the Berlin headquarters of the NSDAP] on 18 May 1932... The Führer made a short speech and in it disclosed among other things, as points of his programme, abolition of the trade unions and the abolition of parties other than the NSDAP. No one raised any objection. These points of the Führer’s programme met with the fullest approval of the members of the Circle of Friends, but they expressed their apprehension that we would not be able to carry out these excellent ideas. [23]\n\nSo the leaders of German industry and finance knew exactly who and what they were supporting when they entered into political relations with the Nazis. Destruction of the parliamentary system, destruction of the trade unions – these were the twin planks in Hitler’s platform that, from the spring of 1932 on, attracted ever greater numbers of businessmen into and around the NSDAP. [24]\n\nThyssen summed up the mood of German business leaders at this time when he later told Rauschning:\n\nWe thought [at first] Brüning was our man. But we couldn’t make out what he was up to... what will be the end of it when they start confiscating? If private property is only tolerated so to speak, there won’t be much left after the next chap has come along and taken his whack. Brüning was obstinate enough to let half the business concerns go bankrupt, and that’s what he called putting industry on a sound footing. Breaking the revolution by timely reforms, he called it. And who backed him up? Not even his own party. [25]\n\nGrowing dissatisfaction with Brüning in business circles (reflected in the activities of the Keppler Circle) merged with the revolt against the Chancellor by army and agrarian leaders. Brüning’s decree banning the SA outraged even moderate ‘national’ opinion, since it was not balanced by a similar outlawing of the Reichsbanner, the SPD defence formation. Brüning still needed his allies on the left in the reformist bureaucracy, and now not only industry but the Reichswehr deemed this course intolerable. And what was even more telling against Brüning and his Defence and Interior Minister Gröner, these forces had the backing of President Hindenburg. The news that Brüning’s decree had aroused deep hostility in these august circles quickly percolated back to the Nazi leadership, for on 14 April, Goebbels remarked: ‘Gröner has launched his bolt. But perhaps it will prove his undoing. We are informed that Schleicher does not agree with his action.’ [26] And it is easy to see why, in view of his letter of 25 March to Gröner, which after making derogatory remarks about the Prussian Social Democrats for their placing curbs on the activities of the SA during the Presidential election campaign, made the classic Bonapartist observation:\n\nAfter the events of the last few days, I am really quite happy that we have a counterbalance in the form of the Nazis, even though they are ill-behaved and to be used only with greatest care. Indeed, if the Nazis did not exist, we should have had to invent them.\n\nDeath sentence on Gröner, the ‘strong man’ of the Brüning cabinet, was passed by the President in a letter to the Defence and Interior Minister, which demanded the repression of the SPD defence formation, a concession which Gröner was not prepared to grant. That Hindenburg’s communication found its way into the national press was taken as confirmation of the President’s determination to oust not only Gröner, but Brüning, the same Brüning who had, only a matter of days before, secured Hindenburg’s re-election to the Presidency. Gröner also saw things in this light, confiding to a close friend on 25 April that his ruin was ‘being readied with all available means. Hindenburg has bared his old conservative heart and desires a government oriented even further to the Right than that of Brüning.’ The Chancellor attempted to stave off his own removal by offering Gröner’s head on a platter to his enemies after a bitter debate in the Reichstag on 10 May over the ban on the Nazi fighting organisations. A broken man, Gröner resigned three days later, full of remorse for his decision of 29 January, which lifted his ban on Nazi membership of the Reichswehr.\n\nBy this time, Brüning’s end was in sight too, for the elections to the Prussian Diet, held on 24 April, had administered a crushing blow to his Reichstag allies, the SPD. As in the other state elections held on the same day in Bavaria and Württemberg, the Nazis made enormous gains at the expense of the old bourgeois parties with the exception of the Centre, while on the left, the KPD was able to make only marginal inroads into the voting strength of the Social Democrats, as the table below illustrates:\n\nElections to the Prussian Diet, April 1932 PartyVotes (millions)SeatsSeats in previous Diet NSDAP8.01629 SPD5.793137 KPD2.85748 Centre3.46771 DNVP1.53171 DVP0.3740 DDP (State)0.3222 Economist0.2016 Christian Socialist0.324 Hanoverians0.110\n\nIn the old Prussian Diet, the SPD – Centre coalition, though two seats short of an absolute majority, could rely on the support of the DDP and even the DVP while the two parties shared office in the Müller cabinet. The mass defection of the former liberal middle class to the Nazis had reduced the Diet fractions of the DDP (now the State Party) and the DVP to mere rumps. And what was even worse for the reformists, the results of the elections showed that while a small proportion of their proletarian supporters had deserted to the KPD, their middle-class following had passed over en masse to the Nazis, rendering the combined vote of the two workers’ parties in the Diet 35 seats less than in the old house. Now the parties of the National Opposition – the NSDAP, DNVP and DVP – were the dominant bloc with 200 seats as against 150 for the KPD and the SPD. In which direction would the Centre, without whose support a new cabinet could not be formed, turn? This was the question that preoccupied the German press and party leaders in the days and weeks that followed the elections. No party or class could remain indifferent to the outcome of the struggle for power in Prussia, since involved here was not simply a scramble for cabinet posts, but the destiny of Germany’s largest and historically and strategically most decisive state. Even before the elections, the Nazis had begun to make fresh overtures to the Centre. On 6 April, Goebbels addressed a meeting of the Centre Party at Aachen, and commented afterwards that ‘things are better than I thought’. [27] On the morrow of the Prussian election, we find Goebbels taking a similar line: ‘The Centre is playing the silent wiseacre. Nevertheless some of their pronouncements are worthy of attention.’ [28] and on 4 May saying that ‘the Centre is seeking to get in touch with the Leader, but he is making himself particularly elusive’. [29] For what the Nazis desired was not simply a change of regime in Prussia, important though that would be, but the removal of Brüning himself, a step his own party, even for the sake of a common front against the ‘Godless Bolsheviks’, would hesitate to take. [30] As Goebbels himself noted on 26 April, after the Berlin SA leader Count Helldorf had met Schleicher to discuss measures ‘to alter the political course’, ‘a change in Prussia... is only possible if it takes place in the Reich at the same time’. [31]\n\nApart from these confidential exchanges, the possibility of a Nazi – Catholic bloc was aired publicly. Kube, the NSDAP Prussian Diet fraction leader, declared on 25 April that his party was:\n\n... prepared to take over the government of Prussia and to work together with those who desire a national, ennobled Prussia filled with a socialist sense of justice. We will reject nobody who is prepared to work together with us in building up the state.\n\nTo which the Centre replied that it was ready:\n\n... to work together with all parties which are resolved, on the bases of the Constitution, to serve the well-being of the whole people... the party stands for a policy of securing the German people’s inner and outer freedom... and a place among the nations of the world.\n\nA basis had been found for discussion between the two parties, and a few days later the Centre Party leader, Monsignor Kaas (who stood to the right of Brüning), met Hitler for an exchange of views on the future course of developments both in Prussia and in the central government. Already undermined by the near total loss of confidence in his cabinet on the part of big business, the ‘national’ parties, the Reichswehr and the President himself, all that Brüning needed to ensure his demise was the enmity of the big agrarians, and this he duly provoked by the presentation to Hindenburg of his plan to ease the chronic strain on the welfare budget by resettling some 600 000 unemployed urban workers in that sacred preserve of Junkerdom, East Prussia. Each settler was to be given approximately 60 acres, which meant that, in all, around 36 million acres would be allocated to people whom the east Elbian landowners regarded as proletarian riff-raff. When first presented to the Reichstag on 9 May 1932, the plan was denounced by the DNVP deputies, and especially by their mentor Hindenburg, as ‘agrarian Bolshevism’. The President viewed the settlement programme as a covert attempt to socialise German agriculture, and when on 29 May he summoned Brüning to an interview in order to make plain his opposition to the Chancellor’s proposals, the President declared:\n\nWe cannot continue in this fashion under any circumstances. We cannot engage in Bolshevik wage laws [under Brüning, wages had been cut by some 15 per cent – RB] and Bolshevik colonisation schemes. The two trade union leaders must get out of the cabinet. I mean you and Stegerwald... I must turn right at long last. The newspapers and the whole nation demand it. But you always refused to do so.\n\nBy ‘the newspapers’ and ‘the whole nation’ Hindenburg meant of course those of ‘national’, for him the only, Germany. Business, army, agrarian, clerical leaders were with a united voice daily demanding Brüning’s scalp. The pressure was irresistible. Hindenburg presented the Chancellor with an ultimatum which both knew could not be accepted. Future government policy had to veer sharply and permanently to the right, collaboration with the reformist SPD and trade union leaders had to end, and the East Prussian resettlement programme scrapped.\n\nBrüning resigned the next day, leaving the way clear for the formation of the cabinet that even more than Brüning’s would make possible the triumph of Hitler and the destruction of the German workers’ movement.\n\nVon Papen Strikes in Prussia\n\nBrüning resigned on 30 May 1932. At least three weeks before this date, however, plans were far advanced not only to secure his removal, but for the installation of a cabinet that avowedly severed all links with the party system, and dispensed with all but the trappings of parliamentary rule. It was to be, in short, a ‘Presidential Cabinet’, a fully-developed Bonapartism which, unlike Brüning’s, leaned firmly to the far right, while basing itself full square on the permanent organs of the state apparatus – the bureaucracy, judiciary and, above all, the army. There was to be no place in such a system for even the most craven of reformists, as the dramatic events in Prussia of 20 July were to demonstrate. Von Papen claims in his Memoirs that the first intimation of his impending appointment as successor to Brüning came on 28 May, when Schleicher informed him ‘that it was the President’s wish to form a Cabinet of experts independent of the political parties’. [32] Facts suggest otherwise. Papen’s name was being mentioned by Goebbels as early as 4 May as the probable successor to the doomed Brüning. And in fact the Nazi leadership were privy to all the major moves and decisions which secured his appointment three weeks later. On 4 May, Goebbels remarks jubilantly that ‘some of Hitler’s mines are beginning to explode’, and that ‘the first to blow up must be Gröner, and after him, Brüning’. [33] On 8 May, the propaganda chief’s diary entry reflects the growing optimism in the Nazi camp that not only are Brüning’s days numbered, but that his successor will lift the irksome ban on the SA and SS:\n\nThe leader has an important interview with Schleicher in the presence of a few gentlemen of the President’s circle. All goes well. The leader had spoken decisively. Brüning’s fall is expected shortly. The President of the Reich will withdraw his confidence in him, the plan is to constitute a Presidential Cabinet. The Reichstag will be dissolved. Repressive enactments are to be cancelled. We shall be free to go ahead as we like. [34]\n\nBy 19 May, with Gröner already out of the way, Goebbels records another important development – the selection of the new cabinet to replace Brüning’s – eight days before Papen claims he first learned of the Hindenburg-Schleicher plan to appoint him Chancellor. What is not in dispute is that Papen’s cabinet took office on the basis of a deal concluded with Hitler whereby the Nazis would ‘tolerate’ Papen in return for a lifting of the ban on the SA and SS. [35]\n\nQuite apart from Papen’s policy statements, which were the most reactionary uttered by a German Chancellor since the fall of the Hohenzollerns, the new Cabinet’s political sympathies were easily discernible from its social composition. Apart from von Papen himself, who represented a fusion of Saar industry and Westphalian nobility, the Cabinet contained no fewer than four barons. The only one of its eight ministers who could be described in any way as a common burgher was the Minister of Justice, Dr Gürtner, who, in this same capacity in the Bavarian government, had acted as benefactor and protector to the NSDAP. The other members of this ‘Cabinet of Barons’ were Baron von Gayl (Interior), General von Schleicher (Defence), Professor Warmbold – the sole survivor from Brüning’s cabinet – (Labour and Economics), Baron von Braun (Food and Commissioner for Eastern Agrarian Relief), Baron von Rubenach (Post and Communications), Baron von Neurath (Foreign), Lutz Earl Schewerein von Krogsik (Finance). Neurath, Papen and Krogsik also served the Third Reich as Hitler’s cabinet ministers, Papen being Vice-Chancellor until his resignation after the purge of 30 June 1934. So this Cabinet served as a stepping-stone to the Nazi seizure of power in more senses than one.\n\nPapen makes no bones in his Memoirs about his motives for accepting the Chancellorship. He intended nothing less than to undo all the social, political and economic reforms brought about by the November Revolution; austerity, the progressive weakening of bourgeois parliamentary democracy and the undermining of the power of organised labour – these were his goals:\n\nThe condition of the country required the collaboration and effort of every patriotic member of the community [which by definition excluded the 13 million ‘anti-national’ Social Democratic and Communist workers – RB], whatever their political inclinations. The financial framework of the federal, State and local government was broken, plans for the basic reform of public life had never got beyond vague proposals. Unemployment [running at roughly six million] was threatening the corporate life of the community and social security funds were exhausted. The postwar governments had embarked on welfare schemes and a system of state socialism which were beyond the country’s means and had turned it into a sort of charity institution. [This was of course the argument of Schacht and the leaders of heavy industry – RB] The moral strength of the nation had been weakened. Public life, if it was to combat Marxist and atheist teachings, would have to be rebuilt on the basis of Christian principles. [36]\n\nThis differs only in small details from Papen’s government declaration of 5 June, which in addition to warning of impending bankruptcy and the need to make an end with the ‘state socialism’ charity, spoke of a ‘cultural Bolshevism poisoning the moral fibre of the German people’, and criticised the ‘Christian forces of the state’ for being lax in compromising with the ‘atheistic Marxist element invading the cultural centres of the country’. Press reactions to Papen’s policy statement of course varied. The Catholic Kölnische Volkszeitung, reflecting the Centre Party’s disgust for the renegade who knifed Brüning, said with some justice that ‘it might be a leading Nazi article’, [37] while Papen’s former journal Germania (with which he had severed all connections on assuming the Chancellorship) thought it was surprising to find ‘the reactionary aims of the new regime expressed with such candour’. The stolidly Protestant and right-wing Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung on the other hand found the Catholic Chancellor’s pronouncement praiseworthy for its ‘honesty and lack of illusions’.\n\nThe Nazi press naturally had to be more discreet. The blatantly aristocratic composition of Papen’s cabinet, not to speak of its obviously pro-monarchist political orientation, made it impossible for the Nazi leaders to come out openly as the champions of the regime they had helped to install. Goebbels’ Angriff, the most popular of the party dailies among the SA plebeians, had already pressed Nazi claims to enter the government in its issue of 30 May, when with the fall of Brüning it proclaimed:\n\nNow or never the moment has come when the Reich President is meeting an historical hour. The right of the NSDAP to the leadership of the state is confirmed doubly and afresh. Will the Reichs President simply evade this inevitable development? That is impossible. [38]\n\nThe editors of Angriff knew full well that Hindenburg had no intention of appointing Hitler Chancellor and that in fact Papen had already been selected for the post. But time was running out for the Nazi leaders. Their restless plebeian following had been kept in a state of suspended and frenzied anticipation for longer than was advisable in a movement based on social demagogy, and incorporating such contradictory strata as declassed proletarians, pauperised peasants, industrial magnates and East Prussia landowners. Only the immediate prospect of power and a share in the rewards of office staved off the inevitable day when the movement would cease to grow and stagnation be followed by decomposition and then rapid disintegration. Closer to the party ‘plebeians’ than almost any other Nazi leader, Goebbels sensed the dangers of openly aligning the party with the ultra-reactionary von Papen government at a time when the SA men were demanding – and arming for – the overthrow of the Weimar system. As early as 9 May, he commented in his diary: ‘It is high time we came to power. The “Reds” are tampering with our rank and file.’ [39]\n\nThe von Papen cabinet formally took office on 1 June. Four days later, Goebbels addressed an SA rally at Schoneberg, where he obviously encountered unrest with the party’s policy of ‘tolerating’ the new government. For in his diary he remarked that after the meeting he had ‘a long conversation with a few partisans on the tactics of the coming revolution. We must dissociate ourselves at the earliest possible moment from the temporary bourgeois cabinet.’ [40]\n\nThat moment, however, had not yet arrived. As far as the Nazis were concerned, the Papen Cabinet had been entrusted with three main tasks to perform – the dissolution of the Reichstag (thus making possible new elections in which the Nazis could expect to double their vote of September 1930), the rescinding of the ban on the SA and SS, and finally the forcible removal of the ‘caretaker’ Social Democratic government in Prussia. When Goebbels made his worried diary entry on the need to make a tactical ‘left turn’, only the first and simplest of those measures had been carried out. No open breach with Papen could be contemplated until the Nazi combat units were free to resume their street war on the forces of organised labour, and the last remnant of Social Democratic influence in affairs of state uprooted in Prussia. Concern that the Papen cabinet was hesitating to act on these two fronts was reflected in Goebbels’ entry for 14 June (the ban on the SA and SS was lifted two days later) when we find him once more recording unrest amongst the Nazi ‘plebeians’ at the slow tempo of events:\n\nHave a long conference with General Schleicher. I call him to task for all resentment and discontent that has grown up in our ranks. This government is irresolute and slow. If we make ourselves responsible for their doings, we shall lose all our chances. The ‘Reds’ are growing arrogant in the face of the fact that the government lets things slide. [41]\n\nBy 22 June, with the SA-SS ban already lifted, the decision to strike against the Social Democrats in Prussia has been taken, and, what is more, the Nazi leadership is fully informed of it. Goebbels notes that ‘the Prussian question is settled at last’, though as a tactical ploy the party would not be taking responsibility for Papen’s overturn of a legally-elected government. Goebbels’ comments at this time betray a grave fear that the Nazi tide was ebbing, and that the workers’ movement, despite its deep internal divisions (accentuated by the ultra-leftist line of the KPD), was at last beginning to regain the initiative that had been lost with the defeat of the Berlin metal-workers’ strike of October 1930 and the Ruhr miners’ strike of January 1931:\n\n13 June: After the first rebuff the Socialists and the Communists are in spirits again. The provinces are preparing for an attack. If it were not for us it would be only a matter of a very short time when the Bolshevik revolution would break out...\n\n22 June: The Bolshevist reign of blood is assuming unbearable proportions. The government remains completely inactive against it...\n\n23 June: ... the Communists have erected barricades at Moabit [a Berlin working-class suburb]... The ‘Red Front’ is returning the right answer to [Interior Minister] von Gayl. If this sort of man was in office for a year Germany would be ripe for a Bolshevist revolution. [42]\n\nIn the Ruhr especially, the organised proletariat seethed with hatred for the Nazis, the spearhead of the coal and steel barons’ onslaught against German labour. Goebbels experienced this loathing at first hand in the course of his propaganda campaign for the Reichstag elections, fixed for 31 July:\n\n12 July: We force our way through the howling mob in Düsseldorf and Elberfeld. [The town Goebbels in his radical days had dubbed the bastion of National Socialism! – RB] A wild trip. We had no idea that things would go so seriously. In all our innocence we drive into Hagen in an open car and wearing our uniforms. The streets are black with people. All of them mob and Communist rabble. They close off the road, so that we can go neither forward nor back... We cut our way through the middle of the pack. Each of us has a pistol in his hand and is determined, if the worst comes to the worst, to sell his life as dearly as possible... The meeting is on a hill, framed by a forest of beeches... The Communists have ingeniously set fire to this forest so that it is impossible to carry on the meeting... On our departure we are followed by a bombardment of stones. We manage to leave the city by detours.\n\n13 July: The experience in Hagen has made us more circumspect. Now we travel in disguise. Constantly we pass lurking groups of Communists. We can hardly get into Dortmund. We have to take a side-street to keep from falling into the hands of the Communists who have occupied all other entrances.\n\n14 July: A trip to the Ruhr involves mortal peril. We take a strange car, because our own with its Berlin number is known... In Elberfeld the Red press has called the mob into the streets. The approaches to the stadium are blocked off completely. It is only because they take us for a harmless passenger car that we get through... After a speech we change into a new car. Again the mob has occupied the streets...\n\n15 July: I must leave my own native city [Elberfeld] like a criminal, pursued by curses, abuse, vilification, stoned, and spat upon. [43]\n\nThe reception was no more friendly in Hamburg and Altona, both centres of proletarian militancy and armed resistance to the Nazi terror. So violent was the reaction to Goebbels’ appearance in the two neighbouring harbour towns that he expressed private doubts as to whether the party would ever break down these workers’ loyalty to Marxism and the organisations which they had built over the previous half-century and more. [44]\n\nEvery day that the Prussian Social Democratic government was allowed to remain in office made it more difficult for both Papen and his allies on the extreme right to hit back at this resurgent proletariat. Two-thirds of Germany came within the ambit of the Prussian state government, including not only welfare services, education and other branches of social policy, but the police. Up till now, the energies of the Prussian police had been expended almost exclusively on combating the revolutionary workers. But with the Weimar system breaking up and the central government no longer in the hands of its party representatives (Papen’s was an explicitly non-party regime), there was a distinct possibility that the Social Democrats would, even if purely in order to save their own cowardly hides, sanction police action against the combat units of the Nazi movement. The Nazis were fully alert to such an eventuality, unlike the Stalinists, who even at this late stage were stridently accusing the Prussian Social Democrats of being direct accomplices of the fascists. On 26 June, the NSDAP issued a statement on the Prussian crisis which demanded ‘the immediate proclamation of martial law throughout the Reich and the ruthless carrying out of an order suppressing the KPD and the cleaning up of the police force, particularly in Prussia’.\n\nPressure on Papen to act against the Prussian Social Democrats was being applied not only from the Nazis and the Reichswehr (which in the person of Defence Minister von Schleicher had, for the first time, a direct representative in the cabinet) but also from the leaders of industry. At a cabinet meeting on 16 July, it was announced that no less a magnate than Gustav Krupp himself had demanded that Papen proclaim a state of siege in the strife-torn Brandenburg district of Prussia, a call endorsed by, among other industrialists, Brandes of Stuttgart. The business world was alarmed at the sudden growth in street-fighting since the lifting of the ban on the SA and SS on 16 June. Groups of workers in areas invaded by the brown-shirted army organised their own proletarian defence, frequently in defiance of commands by their reformist and Stalinist leaders; and to such good effect that the Nazis for the first time began to suffer serious casualties in their own ranks. In the four weeks since the lifting of the bans (applied one-sidedly, since the KPD defence guard, the Red Front Fighters League, remained outlawed under the 1929 ban of the Müller government) in Prussia alone there had been 99 deaths and many hundreds more seriously wounded. In the more keenly contested districts of Berlin and Hamburg, the pitched battles between Nazis and workers threatened to assume civil war proportions. The climax and day of decision for Papen came on 17 July, when the SA high command attempted to take by storm the working-class stronghold of Altona, the harbour city which more than any other proletarian centre had remained immune to infection from the Nazi virus.\n\nThe workers of Altona hit back at their fascist enemies to such good effect that by the end of the day (it was a Sunday), the Nazis were put to flight, leaving behind them several dead and many more wounded (total casualties were 19 killed and 285 wounded). [45] Goebbels was thunderstruck at the rout:\n\nTerrible news from Altona. The Communist assault our SA on the march in an organised attack. Fifteen dead and 50 seriously injured. That is open civil war. When will the government intervene? [46]\n\nAnd that was a question also being asked with some insistence in the bourgeois press. The right-wing Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ranted the next day:\n\nIt is certain that the KPD organises shootings, systematically and in accordance with orders, especially the shooting of National Socialists. There exists no doubt that these groups possess weapons and make use of them also against the police. Here it is necessary to take action – ruthless and immediate. The state of affairs which at present prevails in Germany cannot in fact be tolerated another 24 hours. [47]\n\nThe specific measures proposed by the paper were draconian in the extreme – suspension of the Constitution, the ‘setting up of courts martial and summary courts’ empowered to pronounce sentence after a ‘very simplified procedure’. Sentences of death were to be imposed on those guilty of ‘unlawful possession of weapons’. The paper had demanded action within 24 hours. Papen concurred. That same day, he invited Prussian Prime Minister Otto Braun and Interior Minister Carl Severing to a conference on the Prussian crisis, a meeting which took place on the 20th (Braun was unable to attend through illness, and Severing was joined by two fellow ministers, Klepper and Hirtsiefer). Meanwhile the machinery had been set in motion to topple the Braun administration. Here too the Nazis were kept fully informed of Papen’s intentions, since on 19 July, Goebbels commented in his diary: ‘There is no other way out than to appoint a State Commissioner in Prussia... Dr Bracht of Essen is designated.'[48]\n\nBracht, the Centre Party Lord Mayor of Essen, is described by Papen as a ‘moderate and intelligent politician and administrator’, [49] but the mere fact that not only Papen’s Cabinet but the Nazis approved of his appointment as overlord of Prussia gives the lie to this claim. When Severing and his two fellow Ministers arrived at the Chancellery on the morning of 20 June, they were confronted with a fait accompli. Papen informed them that Prime Minister Braun and Interior Minister Severing were dismissed, their functions to be usurped by Bracht. Severing replied that Papen’s decree was unconstitutional, and that he would only yield to force. Papen had already taken the necessary precautions to deal with such a show of resistance:\n\nAnother decree of the same date had been signed by the President and counter-signed by Gayl..., Schleicher and myself. This decree, declaring a state of emergency to exist in Greater Berlin and the Province of Brandenburg, was now promulgated [precisely as demanded two days before by the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung – RB], and Lieutenant General von Rundstedt... was entrusted with the military measures necessary to put it into effect. [50]\n\nThese ‘military measures’ were not exactly of the scale needed to overturn a government enjoying the support of some six million workers and the nominal control of the state’s security apparatus and bureaucracy, for reasons that will be discussed below. Estimates of the number of police officers required to effect Severing’s eviction from his Ministry office vary from three to five, while Papen himself says that a ‘lieutenant and 12 soldiers’ carried out the arrest of the Prussian Police Commissioner, Albert Grzesinski, who was unceremoniously hustled off to one of his own cells, together with his deputy and the head of the uniformed Prussian police force, Colonel Heimannsberg.\n\nThe Nazis were jubilant at the ignominious capitulation of the Prussian government. What they, together with the monarchists – and the Stalinists – had not been able to accomplish a year previously in the referendum, Papen had achieved almost at the stroke of the Presidential pen. Goebbels wrote:\n\n20 July: Everything goes off according to plan. Bracht is appointed commissioner of the Reich. Severing declares that he will only yield to force. We only have to press the button. That would be to declare an exceptional situation in Berlin, Brandenburg... In the capital all remains quiet, the socialists and trade unions do not stir a finger.\n\n21 July: Everything goes off smoothly. The Reds are done away with. Their organisations offer no resistance... The Reds have let slip their opportunity. It will never occur again... The Reds are quite tame. [51]\n\nGoebbels’ judgement on the decisiveness of Papen’s coup was shared in retrospect by Lüdecke, who considered that ‘on 20 July, Marxism sustained a body blow, for on that day the remains of the unconstitutional Red Power in Prussia were wiped out’. [52] And also like his then Nazi colleague Goebbels, he noted gleefully that:\n\n... the coup d'état met with no resistance, no general strike – nothing but protest. The Marxian giant made a cowardly retreat; it was a miserable exit of a miserable regime. Marxism had been routed in its stronghold. [53]\n\nThese assessments were exaggerated, for although the reaction had scored a tactical victory in Prussia, the organisations of the working class – the KPD, SPD and the trade unions – had not been broken, had not lost their independence or the support of their members and followers, despite their leaders’ joint capitulation to Papen on 20 July. Nevertheless, the purge of officials that followed the coup enabled Papen – and after him Schleicher and Hitler – to press ahead with his attack on the working class unhindered by the resistance of bureaucrats still loyal to the party that appointed them; and free from the worry that Severing’s ministry might disclose evidence of a compromising nature concerning relations between Papen’s Cabinet, the Reichswehr, big business and the Nazis. Bracht himself became the new Interior Minister, and Hans Lammers (subsequently Hitler’s State Secretary), Minister of Education. In a matter of days, a clean sweep had been made of all real or suspected ‘red’ officials, ranging from Police Presidents of large cities such as Cologne and Altona to quite minor administrators in the municipalities. The new Prussia so fervently desired by Hugenberg was now taking shape. On 26 July, Prussian civil servants were informed they could now join the NSDAP, a move that betrayed Bracht’s true political sympathies. ‘Now it is necessary’, declared the Reich Commissioner, ‘again to write large the word State, and to set up service to state and nation as the sole objective of all our work.’\n\nThese measures followed hard on the heels of Papen’s first economic and social measures, and were part and parcel of his overall attack on the democratic rights and living standards of the proletariat. On 14 June, Papen enacted by Presidential decree drastic cuts in unemployment benefit and war disabled pensions, while imposing new tax burdens on wage earners. The dole was reduced by 23 per cent, and recipients required after seven weeks of benefit to produce new evidence of need before payments could continue. This measure cut government dole expenditure by 14 per cent. The remainder of the deficit – some 11 per cent – was to be met by lowering the bottom end of the income tax scale to include all but the worst paid of workers. Unemployment, pauperism, semi-starvation, the usurpation of elementary democratic liberties – this was the meaning of Papen’s ‘Social Catholicism’, of the programme which pledged his Cabinet of Nazi-supported Barons to ‘reconstruct Germany on a basis of immutable Christian philosophy’. No wonder that Goebbels privately noted that the Westphalian aristocrat and ‘gentleman rider’ had stolen ‘all our ideas’. But it was a complaint that could not be made in public, for with the vital Reichstag elections of 31 July drawing near, and unrest mounting daily in the ranks of the SA (now nearly half a million strong), the Nazi leaders had to steer a political course well to the ‘left’ of the most reactionary government in the history of the Republic.\n\nHitler Stalemated\n\nThe need to project a radical image was acutely felt by the Nazi leaders in the summer months of 1932. Papen’s regime lacked even the semblance of popular support, and even in the Reichstag could count only on the help (grudgingly given) of its 41 DNVP deputies. The horrendous prospect of mass desertion by the party’s plebeian followers to the KPD was never far from the thoughts of Hitler and the remainder of the Nazi high command while Papen held office, and this helps to account for the prominent role taken by former ‘radical’ Gregor Strasser in promulgating NSDAP policy in the Reichstag election campaign. It was Strasser who, following Papen’s policy statement of 5 June, declared on behalf of the party that it ‘decidedly refused to have its name coupled with this government’ and that the party was ‘resolved after the Reichstag elections to take over the helm of state’. Nine days later, Strasser broadcast an election address in which he was at pains to distinguish Nazi nationalism from that of the Papen variety. He also emphasised the ‘socialist’ aspects of Nazi policy, much as he had done in his days as theoretician of the north German ‘lefts’ of 1925-26. At the same time, while turning his face leftwards to the impatient Nazi plebeians, Strasser included in his speech references to the traditionalist nature of Nazi ‘German socialism’ and his party’s hostility to a ‘systemless’ that is, proletarian, revolution. In all it was a tour de force of demagogic tight-rope walking, made necessary on the one hand by the stubborn refusal of Papen and a still-decisive section of the ruling class to hand over the government to Hitler; and on the other, by exasperation in Nazi ranks with their leaders’ reluctance to seize power by force:\n\nWe understand by socialism measures carried out by the state for the protection of the individual, or a larger body, against exploitation. The nationalisation of the railways, the municipalisation of the tramways, the electric light and gas works, Baron von Stein’s liberation of the peasants, the Prussian officers’ principles of achievement, the incorruptible German professional official, the walls of the town hall, the cathedral, the hospital of a free imperial city – all that is the expression of German socialism as we conceive and demand it. The synthesis of nationalism and socialism in National Socialism means the internal and external freedom of Germany and the freedom of his place of labour to the poorest compatriot. The Nazis do not want reaction, but healing, not a systemless revolution, but an organic new order. They are revolutionary because they want to overthrow the decaying immoral ideas of the French Revolution. They want protection for honourable labour against abuse by capitalism, they want to root out that speculation which bankrupted the people. They do not want to persecute the Jews, but they want German leadership, without the Jewish spirit, without the Jews pulling the strings, and without Jewish capital.\n\nNow more than ever before, Hitler needed an electoral triumph. Party morale, and negotiations with the current rulers of Germany and the holders of industry’s purse strings, demanded that the Nazis prove themselves to be still on the ascendant. But as Trotsky pointed out at the time, the social reserves of fascism had been drained. The nation now stood polarised between a Nazified petit-bourgeoisie and a proletariat which, despite the treachery of its leaders, remained rock-firm in defence of its organisations and social conquests. The deadlock could not be broken by sheer weight and volume of propaganda, as the election results of 31 July confirmed. Despite more than a month of ceaseless campaigning on a scale and with an intensity matched not even during the Presidential elections of the previous spring, the Nazis succeeded in pushing up their share of the popular vote by less than one per cent compared with the run-off ballot for the Presidency on 11 April.\n\nPresidential Elections, 1930 and 1932 PartyVotes (million)%Deputies 193219301932193019321930 SPD8.08.621.624.5133143 KPD5.34.614.613.18977 DDP (State)0.41.31.03.8420 DVP0.41.61.24.5730 DNVP2.22.55.97.03741 Christian Socialist0.41.61.12.53>14 Landbund0.10.20.20.523 Hanoverian0.00.10.10.403 Economist0.11.4>0.43.0223 Other Agrarian0.21.40.54.0325 NSDAP13.76.437.418.3230107 Centre4.64.112.511.87568 BVP1.21.13.23.02219\n\nTaking into account the special case of the two Catholic parties (Centre and BVP) we see that the Nazi gains on September 1930 came almost entirely from the old bourgeois and agrarian parties, while no votes at all were lost by the two workers’ parties, as the table below illustrates:\n\nBloc1932 %1930 %% loss or gain Fascist37.418.3+ 19.1 Bourgeois + Agrarian10.426.6-16.2 Proletarian36.237.6- 1.0 Catholic15.714.8+ 0.9\n\n(The one per cent drop in the vote for the workers’ parties was on a larger total poll. The combined KPD – SPD vote actually increased in gross terms by some 80 000.)\n\nDeadlocked on the electoral plane, Hitler also found his path to power barred by the old élites that his plebeians sought to displace (or, more accurately, join). On 1 August, von Papen declared, much to the chagrin of the Nazi leaders:\n\nThe election... proves that there is no clear majority in the Reichstag and that no party can secure a majority. The government must therefore return to its original ta"
