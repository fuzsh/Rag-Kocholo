Lehner, the wife of Mathias Lehner and the mother of the Mathias and George Lehner (who also appear in the photos). A daughter Rosina Lehner is buried at Hillside Cemetery, Chilton. Her stone reads: Rosina Lehner 1857-1863. She doesn't show on either the 1870 or 1880 census because she died before they were taken. Mathias Lehner died on Aug. 11, 1880 at Chilton. Also, the maiden name for Rosina Lehner (the mother) is Burger. The family entered the US via New York in 1857. The burial place of Mathias and Rosina have yet to be found. They had 10 children. ******* At her home in Brant on Thursday, July 13th, Mrs. Rosina Lehner, one of the pioneer women of this section, passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, her children who lived at a distance being unable to reach her bedside before death came. Mrs. Lehner had been in poor health for the past year but no immediate danger was anticipated. About a year ago while riding home from church the horse which she was driving shied and she was thrown from the buggy and while her injuries were not serious she had not been in robust health since. The recent extreme heat, in her delicate condition, seemed to use up all her vitality and without the least warning she succumbed to it. Rosina Burger was born Feb. 16, 1837, in Illingen, Wurtenberg, Germany, and counted among her ancestry some of the nobility of that country. She came to America in 1853 locating at Marion, Ohio, where she was married to Mathias Lehner in 1855 and shortly after came to Calumet county and located on the farm now owned by John Juckem near this city. They remained there until 1867 when they located on the farm in Chilton town on which she lived until her death. During the civil war the care of her family devolved upon her, her husband having gone to join the ranks of those who made the fight for the preservation of the union. This care and hardship necessitated by the war brought out and developed her many good traits of character. Her husband died August 11, 1880, and again the care of the family and homestead rested on her shoulders. She was a woman of remarkable executive ability, a good manager and made the farm home one of the prominent ones in the neighborhood, rearing her children in plenty and taking the place of both father and mother. She was respected in the neighborhood in which she lived so many years and appreciated by her children, all of whom except her son, Frank, who remained on the homestead, have left the roof tree and are now established in homes of their own. She was a Christian woman in the true acceptation of the word, giving to charity, benevolent and kind in her intercourse with her neighbors, true in her friendships and honorable in all her dealings. The funeral, which was one of the largest ever held in Brant took place at eh Brant M. E. Church, Rev. A. O. Nuss of Stockbridge officiating, with interment in the family lot in the Portland cemetery. The deceased is survived by six sons, John of Crivitz, George of Escondido, Calif., August of Fairbanks, Minn., Frank of Brant, Alfred of Duluth, Minn., Oscar of SanDiego, Calif., and two daughters, Mrs. A. J. Planz of Oshkosh and Mrs. G. O. Pingel of Stockbridge, also twenty-three grandchildren. All the children were at the funeral except the sons in California who were unable to get here.

Mathias Lehner, who died at St. Luke s hospital in Duluth, Minn., on Saturday, April 21. The young man was born July 24, 1863, in the town of Chilton and was the third son of Mathias and Rosina Lehner. He spent his boyhood days on the old homestead and in 1891 left for the north, where he engaged in lumbering. A few years ago he located a homestead near Duluth, and his prospects for the future looked bright. Some six months ago he contracted a severe cold, which gradually grew worse. He visited his old home and remained here a short time, improving so much in health that he was able to return to Duluth to look after his property. Four months ago he was taken with pneumonia and went to St. Luke s hospital, where the best medical aid was procured, but he found no relief and the disease caused his death. His mother was with him during his illness. The remains were brought to the home of his mother, on Monday, and laid in state until Tuesday, when the funeral took place from the M. E. Church in Brant. He was a promising young man of industrious and steady habits and has a faculty for making and retaining friends. His death is deeply deplored by those who knew him.
