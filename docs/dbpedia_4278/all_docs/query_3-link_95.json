        "text": "ONE swallow may not make a summer, but how about three? Three being the number of powerful recording artists who have recently dusted off songs by Carl Loewe, who made his most lasting mark in ballads, that now unfashionable genre of songs that tell stories of romance, adventure and the uncanny.\n\nBorn in 1796, two months before Schubert, whom he outlived by 40 years, Loewe (pronounced LUH-veh) wrote some 400 songs over the course of his long life, as against Schubert’s 600-plus, and in many cases they used the same texts. Unlike Schubert, who scarcely left Vienna, Loewe got around. A very capable tenor, he performed his songs widely, to his own virtuoso piano accompaniment. The crowned heads of Europe received him warmly. The king of Prussia was a fan, as were the British royals. When Loewe played for them, Prince Albert turned the pages.\n\nThe Canadian bass-baritone Gerald Finley, on his recent Hyperion recording “The Ballad Singer,” locates Loewe squarely within the relevant tradition. Frankly retro, heavily encrusted with deliberate rhetorical artifice, this album traces balladry from Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann and Wolf to the ripe Victorian kitsch of Arthur Sullivan (“The Lost Chord”) and a saucy parody of Cole Porter (“The Tale of the Oyster”).\n\nThe first Loewe selection, fittingly enough, is “Edward,” Loewe’s Opus 1, No. 1: a grisly colloquy between a blood-soaked son and the mother who has driven him to what turns out to have been his father’s murder. Assisted by Julius Drake, Mr. Finley offers a shadowy, repressed reading, drawn out at an unusually slow tempo. Comic relief follows in the form of “Die Wandelnde Glocke,” about a lad who refuses to go to church until the bell comes to fetch him.\n\nThe Austrian baritone Florian Boesch and the pianist Roger Vignoles offer a gnarlier, angrier “Edward” and a jauntier “Wandelnde Glocke” on “Loewe: Songs and Ballads,” another Hyperion disc. These artists have also made room for purely lyrical numbers. Unlike some of his peers Mr. Boesch makes no fetish of honeyed tone, and a hint of gruffness bespeaks a lion’s heart even where the mood is gentlest, as in the limpid meditation of a star gazer from the second part of Goethe’s “Faust.”\n\nThe third of Loewe’s current champions is the Dutch baritone Henk Neven, with Hans Eijsackers at the keyboard. Their CD “Auf Einer Burg,” (“At a Castle”), from Onyx, couples Schumann’s nostalgic “Liederkreis” (Op. 39) with nine assorted Loewe pieces, seven of them also on Mr. Boesch’s program. A highlight for both baritones is “Tom der Reimer,” the sunny tale of a minstrel’s encounter with a coquette who is not, as he first supposes, the queen of heaven. No, she tells him, she is the fairy queen. One kiss, and he must serve her for seven years. He does so with pleasure, and off they ride to the tinkle of bells braided into the mane of her steed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
