He wrote masses, oratorios and cantatas, sonatas, and concertos but was known chiefly for over 60 operas, written in a thoroughly Italianized style.

It was here in 1697 that he invented, and with the assistance of the pastor produced, a dulcimer-like instrument with double strings of metal and gut. This instrument played its part in the early development of the fortepiano, as acknowledged by C.G Schröter, the instrument maker. Indeed a courtier travelling through the village was so impressed with the possibilities of the instrument and Hebenstreit's performance on it that he arranged for a demonstration at the Dresden court. Hebenstreit returned to Leipzig where he was apparently able to repay his debts and Johann Kuhnau reported in Mattheson's Critica Musica that Hebenstreit acted as a maitre de danse. Kuhnau emphasized the technical difficulty and skill of Hebenstreit's performances. In 1698 he was appointed dancing master by Duke Johann Georg of Weissenfels. In 1705 Hebenstreit visited Paris and created a sensation: Louis XIV was so impressed he ordered the instrument to be called the \"pantaleon\". Hebenstreit was the impetus for Abbe de Chateauneuf's Dialogue sur la musique des anciens a Monsieur. In 1706 Hebenstreit entered the service of Duke Johann Wilhelm of Eisenach as dancing master to his children. G.P.Telemann who was engaged as director in 1708 praised Hebenstreit's work, mastery of the French style and his virtuosity on the pantaleon and violin. On 11th May 1714 he entered the service of Augustus the Strong as chamber musician and pantaleonist and received, for a musician, an unusually high salary of 1200 thalers. Additionally he received 200 thalers for the upkeep of his instrument. In 1727 he took out a royal writ against Gottfried Silbermann for building a large number of pantaleons not commissioned by the inventor. By 1729 he was placed in charge of music for the Protestant court church: the musical provision for which was minimal, including cantor, vice cantor, organist and six choir boys. In 1733, due to his failing eyesight, he retired from pantaleon performance. By 1734 he was made director of Protestant church music and in 1740 was appointed a privy counsellor. Both these positions were sinecures for an elderly, long serving musician.

Since L'Héritier was mainly a composer of sacred music, and worked in Rome, leaving numerous compositions in the Vatican archive, he may have been one of the most influential northern musicians on the development of the later Palestrina style. In addition, since his work appears in numerous manuscripts of the 16th centuryat least 66, as well as 45 printed collectionsand in areas as far apart as Spain, Austria, Bohemia, and Poland, in addition to France and Italyhis influence seems to have been considerable Herman, Jerry\n\nmore...

He went on to become a composer and conductor in New York and emerged as a well-known champion of contemporary music. He became the conductor of the CBS Radio Orchestra, holding a similar position to Arturo Toscanini at NBC. In addition, Herrmann also scored hundreds (perhaps thousands) of CBS radio shows, where his music went into the library and was used repeatedly, even decades later on television. Through his radio work, Herrmann became involved with Orson Welles, and when Welles moved to Hollywood to begin work on his first feature, he took Herrmann as part of his troupe, beginning Herrmann's career as a film composer. Some of Herrmann's best-known work is his earliest. Citizen Kane (RKO, 1941) was released the same year as All That Money Can Buy (RKO, 1941), which won him his only Academy Award and beat out the established Hollywood crowd of Alfred Newman, Miklos Rozsa, Max Steiner and Franz Waxman. Kane was followed up by The Magnificent Ambersons (RKO, 1942). Ambersons was eventually re-edited by the studio, which cut his music significantly and completely replaced some of it.

Herrmann's last scores for Hitchcock were The Birds (Universal, 1963) (although not really a musical score, Herrmann is credited with overseeing the sound design, which is based on electronic bird sounds), Marnie (Universal, 1964), and finally Torn Curtain (Universal, 1966) Herrmann, Hugo\n\nmore...

He composed a work for the opening of the Royal Albert Hall, his Nala and Damayanti was performed at Birmingham, and he gave a series of piano recitals of his own compositions at the Hanover Square Rooms in 1871. He had a perfect mastery over technique and form in musical composition, but his works are generally dry. He was a sound pianist and teacher, and occasionally a brilliant writer on musical matters. His compositions, numbering about two hundred, include six operas, two oratorios, six or seven cantatas, much chamber music and a once-popular piano concerto Hiller, Johann Adam\n\nmore...

He studied conducting, composition and violin under Arnold Mendelssohn and Bernhard Sekles, supporting himself by playing in dance bands and musical-comedy outfits. He led the Frankfurt Opera orchestra from 1915 to 1923 and played in the Rebner string quartet in 1921 in which he played second violin, and later the viola. In 1929 he founded the Amar Quartet, playing viola, and extensively touring Europe. In 1922, some of his pieces were heard in the International Society for Contemporary Music festival at Salzburg, which first brought him to the attention of an international audience. The following year, he began to work as an organiser of the Donaueschingen Festival, where he programmed works by several avant garde composers, including Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg. From 1927 he taught composition at Berlin and in the 1930s he made several visits to Ankara where he led the task of reorganising Turkish music education. Towards the end of the 1930s, he made several tours of America as a viola and viola d'amore soloist. Despite protests from the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, his music was condemned as \"degenerate\" by the Nazis, and in 1940 he emigrated to the USA, where he taught music at Yale University (Professor of Music at Yale from 1940 to 1953) and Harvard, and influenced younger American composers such as Harold Shapero. He became an American citizen in 1946, but returned to Europe in 1953, living in Zürich and teaching at the University there. Towards the end of his life he began to conduct more.

Hough, Stephen\n\nmore... Houghton, Phillip\n\nmore... Houtkamp, Luc\n\nmore...4 Dec. 1953\n\nThe Netherlands Luc Houtkamp is a virtuoso saxophonist and composer who has developed an array of extended saxophone techniques. He feels that one aspect that particularly typifies his playing is a strong understanding of form and structure that give the impression that his music is a completely composed one. Since 1985 he has also become active as a composer of electronic and computer music. In his electronic work, the use of self developed interactive computer programmes play an important role.\n\nIn Houtkamp's computer based work, a computer programme assumes the role of an improvising listener and co-musician. The computer analyses sound input from the live performer and controls MIDI gear, either synthesizers or sound processing devices modifying the live player's sound. The software allow the computer to \"listen\" and respond to a live instrumental improviser.\n\nHoutkamp often chooses idiosyncratic voices for his computer music. His digital partners are player pianos and harmonizers, rather than synthesizers. Thus the human musician is accompanied by a real acoustic piano (one that appears to be played by an invisible player) or the musician's own instrument transposed and transformed into fresh melody lines. This results in music that deflects the technology of its production and ends up sounding new but familiar at the same time.\n\nThrough this software, a real synthesis between improvisation and composition is achieved. The computer provides a rigid framework within which the acoustic musician is fully free to develop his improvisations. In turn, the musician can direct the computer through his musical instructions. Since 2000 Houtkamp mainly performs his music with his own computer chamber group: The POW Ensemble.\n\nThe main links to his music are:\n\nhttp://www.xs4all.nl/~xorluc/\n\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/users/luchout/\n\nhttp://www.shef.ac.uk/misc/rec/ps/efi/mhoutk.html\n\nHoutman, Ad\n\nmore...

Howells was also associated with the University of London. He was appointed King Edward VII Professor, a somewhat anomalous position, since the University did not have a music faculty. Like Vaughan Williams, Howells' musical taste was for the English folk idiom, and for music of the sixteenth century, which in Howells' case led to a contrapuntal approach to music. Howells and Vaughan Williams were colleagues at the Royal College of Music; Vaughan Williams taught composition there from 1919 and Howells joined him the following year. Howells seems to have lacked the self-promotional skills necessary for success as a composer, and few of his works were widely performed. But a handful of his works have become classics. For those familiar with the church repertoire, he is one of the major English composers of the century. He wrote the only substantial and successful body of music this century for the clavichord with the collections Lambert's Clavichord and Howells' Clavichord.

The chamber opera Twilight (1925) faithfully renders old patrician Dubrovnik, and the ballet Legend of Ohrid (1947) owed its popularity to Serbian and Macedonian folklore, to its remarkable melodies, to its unusual rhythms and sophisticated orchestration.

Hurum, Helge1936\n\nNorwaya composer who draws his inspiration from Norwegian nature and folk tunes, Hurum's music is accessible, lyrical and often elegiac. For this reason his music is popular with school and community bands. Among his works meriting closer attention are Eventus (10'30), Adagio for Winds (4'45), Concita for Band (5'15) and Capriccio & Canzone (11'30). Band works with soloists are Contrasts for trumpet (6'), Sketches for Oboe and Band, and Ballade for Alto Sax and Band, for which he received 1st prize in the European Broadcasting Union's Band Music Competition in 1987. Hurum has also written several works for band and choir: Folklore (7'30) and Vind Fer Vide (15'20). Pulsare (10') is a 2-movement work and was commissioned by the Norwegian Band Federation as a test piece for the 2000 Norwegian Championships 1st division Hus, Walter\n\nmore...
