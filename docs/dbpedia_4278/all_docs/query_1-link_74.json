        "text": "Personal Statement\n\nQing Li was one of the first piano students I taught while an assistant lecturer during graduate school. He was a graduate physics student, and had zero physical and musical aptitude for piano playing. I was thankful to get him through one semester of lessons, where he tried very hard to do what I asked, but still ended up sounding like he was chopping wood rather than making music.\n\nHe then signed up for a second semester. I was dismayed at the prospect of having to put my ears through more wood chopping.\n\nYet something remarkable happened at the beginning of thatÂ second semester. At the second lesson, Qing Li had a breakthrough! He began playing expressively, in a manner where his physical movements supported and facilitated the musical intent of the piece â and continued to do so during the rest of his studies.\n\nThis happened over 25 years ago and was my first real insight into the great rewards of teaching, regardless of the level of the student. Qing Li was an intermediate pianist, but that didnât lessen his accomplishment, or the sense of pride I had in it.\n\nIâve since taught many advanced and highly talented students, some of whom were very successful in competitions and had âthe right stuffâ to be a professional musician. But Iâve never forgotten Qing Li, and the impact his success had on me.\n\nIt is wonderful to be feted as a performer following a concert. Nonetheless, the gratification one gets from helping people become better musicians â where they can express themselves at the instrument in a more technically capable and musically artistic manner – is definitely more meaningful and long-lasting.\n\nI certainly didnât think Iâd ever be a piano teacher. When asked during my undergrad years by a classmate, âSo, what are you going to do after finishing school â teach?â, I replied with great assurance, âMe? No, Iâll NEVER teach!â\n\nIt all started with a toy xylophone when I was about nine or ten. I would bash around on that thing relentlessly, undeterred by the fact that I only had two mallets and a range of about one octave. I seemed to have a fascination for resonance created by striking objects: bells and chiming clocks were among my favorites, and hearing those sounds would pretty much send me into orbit. I was, in a nutshell, a sweet but somewhat weird kid.\n\nEventually I began to feel frustrated by the limitations of my percussive buddy. It was at this point that I asked my parents for piano lessons â a request they turned down, due to lack of money and piano at home.\n\nWe were living in Germany at the time; when my German grandmother â whom we called âOmiâ – got wind of the situation, she marched down to a piano store in downtown Munich and secured a rental piano and piano teacher in one fell swoop. Had Omi been born 50 years later, I have no doubt that she wouldâve been leading corporate takeovers. I was glad she was on my side.\n\nSince these humble beginnings, I have had a variety of wonderful teachers â and a few that were not so hot, as well. In retrospect, I learned a lot from all of them. I seriously thought my first teacher walked on water and was the best thing since sliced bread; however, once I got to my second teacher, Ylda Novik, I realized, much to my chagrin, that Herr V. hadnât taught me doodly-squat (one of my dadâs expressions).\n\nSuddenly, I was thrust into a world of nuance, detail, and requirement that left my head spinning. I had stomach aches the first couple months of lessons â but I was thrilled by the challenge. I also loved the camaraderie that she created among her students; I am still friends with some of these people 40 years later. It was an incredibly stimulating and rich musical/social environment, and I credit Mama Ylda (ourÂ family moniker for her) with giving me the keys to the kingdom of being a professional musician. The one who unlocked the kingdomâs door, however, was my next teacher: Nelita True. Mama Ylda tragically died of cancer at age 54 during my junior year of high school. I â along with the rest of her brood â was devastated, and could not imagine myself going to another teacher.\n\nBut after about six months of grieving, I did. It was one of the best things that ever happened to me.\n\nI have always been someone who feels things intensely – especially music. Unfortunately, this can translate into debilitating physical tension – which, in turn, can pretty much wreck oneâs musical expression, while also hurting like hell. Whereas Mrs. Novik made me aware of my tension and was able to lessen it to some degree, it still caused lots of problems: I often received only honorable mention in competitions because of my harsh sound â thus, I became her âHonorable Tommyâ. Though somewhat amusing, this title was definitely a thorn in my side.\n\nNelita changed all that within one â yes, ONE! â lesson. I played Prokofiev Sonata No. 3 for her and beat the living crap out of the piece; she later confessed that I demonstrated one of the the most God-awful piano sounds sheâd ever heard. With her trademark grace, humor, and patience she showed me how to remedy this by releasing my weight into the keys. It was a revelation for me! I thought piano playing just had to hurt as a matter of course, and couldnât imagine that it could actually be easy and effortless. Gone was my egregious sound, and I proceeded to win prizes in every competition I entered that year.\n\nI ended up attending the University of Maryland at College Park in order to study with Nelita. I adored her and having lessons with her, as I received such a thorough grounding in the nuts and bolts of both the musical and technical elements of piano playing. I am eternally grateful for that wonderful time, and strive to convey this pedagogical clarity â and humor – in my teaching, as well.\n\nIn the middle of my undergrad studies, my father was transferred to Germany. My mother was not keen on the idea of me staying behind in the States, and thus I ended up completing my junior year at the Hochschule fÃ¼r Musik in Munich, where I worked with Ludwig Hoffmann, a renowned German pianist and teacher.\n\nWorking with Hoffmann was quite the eye-opener. The essence of his pedagogy can be found in this assessment he made of one of his studentâs performances: âI love how Hermann plays the Symphonic Etudes. He plays so few wrong notes!â\n\nAnd thus my year was one of trying to play as cleanly and evenly as possible; lessons consisted of devising fingerings and redistributions towards this end, with minimal attention to interpretive issues. There was also much discussion of pedal, most notably in finding passages to use the sostenuto (middle) pedal. It was anything but inspiring work â though it was a valuable lesson in seeing that different teachers value and emphasize different things, some of which can be diametrically opposed to oneâs own values and training. I do still, however, have an openness towards redistributing difficult technical passages that my other teachers did not share – so I got something out of that tedious year back in the heimat (homeland).\n\nAfter a wonderful senior year back in the States with Nelita, I ended up in my home state of California for graduate work.Â This was at the University of Southern California (or the University of Spoiled Children, as it was referred to by some) with artist teacher John Perry.\n\nJP was â and still is â a formidable personality: brimming with vitality, a razor-sharp wit, and one of the most nuanced set of ears on the planet. Hearing him work in studio/masterclass was often highly entertaining and revelatory, as it was here that he truly shone, transforming students on the spot with his unflinching dedication to meaningful, personal musicianship grounded in stylistic awareness. His understanding and connection to Schubert is peerless, in my opinion â in fact, his understanding and teaching of Classical style in general is something quite special, so I made sure to study a lot of this repertoire with him â especially Beethoven, to whom we both feel very connected. But we also had great lessons on Bach, Debussy/Ravel, AlbÃ©niz, Barber sonata, Chopin, Rachmaninoff â we covered a lot of ground in my time at USC. I also was privileged to work as his teaching assistant, giving me the opportunity to teach his studio during my final two years at USC. What a joy to teach top talent and repertoire!\n\nMy pianistic pedigree, as it were, is varied and colorful. My teaching reflects this mix in a way that is uniquely mine: passionate, playful, dedicated, and always challenging. I welcome the opportunity to work with anyone who loves playing the piano and is serious about becoming the best pianist he/she can be.\n\nIn Person and Online Services\n\nPrivate Lesson / Consultation\n\nA one-on-one lesson, usually one hour in length, though it can be longer or shorter, depending on individual needs. It is also possible to schedule an âopenâ lesson, which will usually be somewhere between 1-2 hours, depending on how much time is needed to work the repertoire in question. One or multiple pieces can be presented. âTune-upâ sessions are also available, to spot-check certain passages in relation to previously-discussed musical and/or technical issues. These are generally 20-40 minutes in length.\n\nMasterclass / Group Lesson\n\nInstruction with multiple participants, usually with an audience. The repertoire performed in the class can be unrelated, or it could be grouped around a stylistic period (Classical, Romantic, etc.), a specific composer, or a genre (concerto). Length is usually 2-3 hours for one class, with 4-6 students performing.\n\nIn Person\n\nIn-person lessons are taught at my home studio, or at another teacherâs studio. I do travel throughout the west coast and the US, and can arrange to work as a consultant with teachers on-site at their respective studios. Masterclasses are held at locations away from my home studio: teacher studios, music teacher meetings/conventions, universities, and other institutions.\n\nOnline\n\nOnline private lessons are taught via Zoom. Masterclasses can be taught online, as well.\n\nInjury Rehab / Prevention\n\nI have had extensive experience in this area, both with my own injury and other students. Â Please see the injury page for more information.\n\nBest Candidates for My Studio\n\nI work best with students who are highly motivated and practice consistently; this usually means several hours a day. I have had excellent success with precollege and college students: many have won prizes in competitions throughout the country, and have received financial offers at top music institutions. I also enjoy working with intermediate-advanced adult students for whom piano study is avocational, but who are serious, focused students committed to reaching their highest level of pianistic development. I am happy to work with someone just once, occasionally, or on a regular basis.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nIf interested in working with me, please email me: thomas@otten.studio. Please include information about your background and current repertoire, as well as current/future goals. We can then set up a time to talk by phone to discuss these items, thus determining whether we might be a good match.\n\nTeacher Consultations\n\nPrivate teachers interested in consultation lessons/masterclasses for their studios are most welcome to contact me, as well! I have done this work for teachers around the country â both in person and online – and enjoy it greatly. In your initial email, please let me know how many students youâd like me to work with, their repertoire, pertinent information as to their strengths/weaknesses, and what our goals are for the coachings."
