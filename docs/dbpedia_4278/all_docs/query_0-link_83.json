        "text": "It’s been a slow day, and suddenly, as it nears its end, I ‘ve had this idea of “Classical Music” being a topic for a new thread in “Fun Stuff”. Well, as I said: slow day.\n\nNow, I don’t expect this topic to set Woody’s on fire (although one never knows here.) But one discussion earlier on gives me a glimmer of hope this shan’t be a totally wasted effort. That conversation I just mentioned was completely off topic, but maintained enthusiastically by several of us, until KP blew her whistle and the concurrence adjourned sine die and in a hurry (although Wavy made up for that, to some extent, by starting a thread on PDQ Bach, also in “Fun Stuff”.)\n\nTo open up proceedings, besides choosing a hard-hitting title I hope will provoke some people to react at all, here are two links to an equal number of not very long performances by good musicians, posted on YouTube. They are among my favorites, and the many ecstatic comments and their two million-plus views each might give some support to that. If you dare go in there, then make sure the Ad Blocker is fully on, so you can enjoy all the beautiful notes, chords and melodies without having to consider toilet cleaning products as well.\n\nThis first one is 24 minutes’ long and remarkable for the beautiful and sensitive playing, but more than that, also for the fact that, unlike what is common practice when playing chamber music, the two performers not only do not have the score in front of them, to help stay in sync, but the cellist keeps his eyes shut pretty much throughout, so it is up to the pianist to watch him, now and then, to keep both going together. And without doing a lot of watching, at that:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNcQuY1isEI\n\nThis second example is 17 minutes’ long and is from the breakout album that brought its then sixteen-year old performer to world attention and marked the start of her brilliant international career, one she is still at with continuing success. For more reference, she is a Virginian and hails from that state’s Appalachian Piedmont, in the USA.\n\nI have recordings of this particular piece by some of the greatest performers of the XX Century, some still alive and playing today, some, sadly, no longer so on one, or even both counts. And of transcriptions for several different instruments, some scored by the likes of Brahms and some played by artists with names like Andrés Segovia on guitar, for example. However, this is my own favorite recording, because her playing is so simple, so clear and, well, so right. The way perhaps, as the old saying goes, “Angels play Bach to God (and Mozart to each other)”:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqA3qQMKueA\n\nOK, the deed is done, now let’s wait and see if anything more ever happens here. I still might be pleasantly surprised, who knows.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Intego AV\n\nFred asked me to post this:\n\nmemories\n\nOscarCP\n\nWhen you graduated, I was in high school, a little younger. Willem Mengelberg was punished shortly after the war by the puritan Dutch community for his views on society during the Nazi period 1933-45. (Was he the only one who thought so? In the 1920-30s it was modern to think so; also the royal family and notables in society did). He became a very bitter man and withdrew from the Netherlands, and then lived his life in his house in Switzerland. His much younger beloved (the only lady?, misstress?) Miss Van Eeghen was with him for a long period and was very often in Switzerland, and of course this was a social scandal in the Netherlands and was kept silent by historiography.\n\nThe last years of her life, in the early 1980s, she was looked after by her younger nephew Jan van Eeghen in the Van Eeghenstaat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At this time Jan van Eeghen (a technical engineer) was a retired sports friend of mine –and a co-director of the Amsterdam Jeu de Boules Bond (the Pétanque competition sport)-. After the death of Jan’s favorite aunt in about 1986 I inherited a few things, including her large collection of classical music records under the condition that they should never be allowed to be sold. This collection also contained many old and original signed recordings (78rpm) of the Concertgebouw Orkest and Willem Mengelberg from before the 2ndWorldWar. That is the time that I started to appreciate this music from him so much.\n\nA few years after the death of his aunt, Jan finally moved to France to continue living among friends in a better and Mediterranean climate (in terms of weather, culture and lifestyle). Unfortunately I lost contact with him, and I became an unknown but “very important” I.T.-security&privacy- specialist, hahaha. I very much regret this loss of contact and friendship, but now it’s too late. It always is.\n\nIn the new CD era I passed on the inherited record music collection to someone who was really crazy about these older music recordings; but my heart is still there. I also passed on my other music records, lack of space and time, and analog recordings was out. Oh dear, new is always better, is it not?\n\nIn contradiction to my non-keeping of the old analog music I have always been very critical of this newer digital future, hence my previous professionalized interest in security and privacy in the computing industry.\n\nOld versus new, oh boy, what will the future bring? “Franz Kafka” in civil administration has started to become normal (again). “George Orwell’s 1984” is all around, freedom and civilization are being minimized or killed. The west of the Netherlands will drown for shure, just like many other parts of human civilization.

These five pieces, in the opinion of musical scholars, well-informed critics, people who like to give opinions on anything and, of course, my totally unfounded but very own one, are some of the most extraordinary ever composed in the whole of the Western classical repertoire. And for a big heap of good reasons:\n\nWhen he wrote them, Beethoven was completely deaf, could not hear anything at all. He was also in great despair, not the least because the world he lived in was going backwards politically and the new, great, fraternal society of free and equal citizens promised by the French Revolution clearly was never going to happen. He was also sick, mostly alone, and his own death was not far off. But the music he composed even so, had not only, and understandably, passages full of a deep melancholy, but also passages of transcendental serenity and others evoking a kind of profoundly serene joy. But for all that, they were intensely disliked in his time by many musicians and critics (*), because they were a radical departure from what people expected to be played in a concert of chamber music. It took another fifty years for the then musical innovators, the avant-garde of that day, to realize that they had been scooped by someone long dead, half a century before.\n\nHere is maybe the greatest and best loved — although any difference in quality between them is a matter of personal preference: they are all very great works of art. Here in two different, but, in my opinion, both excellent interpretations, one quite recent, one much older.\n\nThe new one, by (I believe) students or recent graduates of the New England School of Music (or maybe of the NE Conservatory of Music) Shame the notes provided when it was posted in YT say nothing about this group:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyDs0wb3FAE\n\nAnd the older one, by the great Quartetto Italiano:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bfOc9z8b5E\n\n(*) But not by all: “Upon listening to a performance of the Op. 131 quartet, Schubert remarked, “After this, what is left for us to write?”:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_string_quartets_(Beethoven)\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Not because it is boring music, not that at all, but because it is relaxing.\n\nNow, this is a set of sonatas and partitas for the lute, a stringed instrument with lots of strings, played like a guitar, but with the extra strings acting as resonators to create interesting chords and reinforce the sound of those actually played.\n\nIn modern times, up to twelve-string concert acoustic guitars have been built to have something of this effect, and played by some of the top guitar players of the last one hundred years: Narciso Yepes, most famously. But the two hours and change of pinging sounds to be found in here are interesting also as an illustration of the way in which people like J.S. Bach or W.A. Mozart, amongst the most prolific classical composers ever, managed to actually have time for other things. In the case of J.S.B., for example, to have all those children and, I suppose, to keep counting them to make sure not to loose some when the family went out shopping together, or to see a show, or something like that.\n\nTheir secret? They copied themselves with abandonment; they plagiarized themselves a lot. So, if when listening at what is in this video you say to yourself: “hmmm that sounds almost like…”, have no doubt, that sounds exactly like some piece by the same composer for some other solo instrument you’ve heard before. For example, at around one hour and 17 minutes, if you happened to find the melody familiar, well yes, it better be: it is Bach’s monumental “Chaconne” for solo violin, that you already have heard in the second YT video with the other “picture” link allowed here (see PKCano’s tutorial on how to post a brown link just above this posting), in the top comment at the very beginning of this thread, played there by my favorite violinist of the last two decades.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBooio3h9U\n\nSo click on this link, take a deep breath, or two, or three, and prepare to relax.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Intego AV\n\nHere is my other favorite relaxing, listen-just-to-listen YT video, as well as one that can be listen paying full attention to the music:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZbcIVTuHKQ\n\nThere is in there a complete recording of all of Bocherini’s concerts for the cello; they are not very long concerts, because Boccherini lived and worked at a time, in the artistic period known as the Late Baroque, when, usually, they were still not very long. He was a cello-player himself, and the works in the video are a delight to listen to, probably because their composer new what it takes to play a particular series of notes in a certain way on a cello and had that in mind when selecting the notes to make sure they was something human cellists could play well if they were any good.\n\nOne interesting thing about the YT video is its accompanying picture: the partial portrait of a well-dressed and fine-looking young lady sitting down in a pensive attitude and surrounded by different string instruments while holding a lute herself.\n\nThe lady was Ann Ford, who was equally highly-regarded as a player of string instruments, as an actress and as a singer. The portrait is by one of the top English painters of her day, Thomas Gainsborough and, judging by this fact and by what she is wearing, it is clear that she was doing pretty well for herself. There is, as I have discovered, because I was curious about this painting, something of an artistic controversy about her portrait that had people saying things like; ‘nice painting, but I would never let one of my daughters be painted like that”\n\nSo what was wrong? Well, and this to people of our times might sound pretty strange, it was the fact that she has her legs crossed. These days, that is considered ladylike, in Ms. Ford time, it seems, it was quite the opposite. Go figure. Her dress was fashionable for her time, but also conventionally modest. And is not that her legs, or anything from much below her neck down is visible of her that is not wrapped in some opaque material. But Gansborough thought — and obviously she agreed — that painting her in this “provocative” posture would express best her rebellious, unconventional views and life-style.\n\nL-P Hartley wrote in “The Go-between”, in the very first sentence: “The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.” I won’t argue with that.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

In its surrealistic musical program composition, one that tells a story with music: the Artist goes through a series of surreal and mostly not good experiences, ending with his untimely demise by way of being dragged to a place of execution, there to hang by the neck (or, in France, probably to have it neck scientifically cut off with a guillotine) until dead. As Leonard Bernstein put it: “Berlioz tells it like it is. You take a trip, you wind up screaming at your own funeral.“\n\nThis item is remarkable both for the large scale of the work being performed, the way it is performed and, last but no least, by how the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, here in full-force, with a large and appropriately loud brass section, is conducted by Mr. Stephane Denev.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the video: the remarkable quality of the sound and how remarkably well filmed it is, showing in detail how the various instruments are being played, something that always has interested me to see.\n\nAnd above all, the super-remarkable fact that the conductor, Mr. Denev, is actually seen to be doing the job he is supposed to do: of giving entrance to the instruments, signalling the players when to play soft, when to increase the volume and when to go with all stops pulled out, so to speak. And to see the members of the orchestra following, for once, their conductor’s instructions, or at least bothering to look at him, now and then, and definitely managing to follow his hand movements one half-beat behind, as it should be.\n\nSo here is the video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1AvexPDTnw\n\n(Sorry, MVPs, but I have done all I can to get a brown YT link and just keep getting this “picture” link instead.

The links are to three performances of works by American composers, meaning not those of any particular country, but those of the continental mass known as ‘America’, that nearly reaches from pole to pole.\n\nFirst, from North America, a truly great performance, with equally great audio engineers recording it, of the “Grand Canyon Suite” of Ferde Grofé. This is a late fifties, monoaural recording made by the extraordinary combination of Eugene Ormandy (one of the maybe five conductors of last century that I can honestly call “Great”) and the Philadelphia Orchestra he directed for many years.

Here is another example where I definitely have no problem with a “crossover”, in this case the blending of traditional Catholic religious music with folkloric music. I am making an exception because the “Misa Criolla” (“Creole Mass”, ‘Creole’ here meaning ‘of the sons of the land’) by the Argentinian folklorist and distinguished musician Ariel Ramirez, is truly exceptional.\n\nWhen back in the 60’s, the Vatican Council II agreed and Pope John XXIII promulgated a wide-ranging series of reforms to the traditions and practices of their millenary institution, the reforms included the permission to celebrate the Mass in the language of the people, in every nation. This brought about a tremendous flourishing of religious music in the vernacular and, in Argentina, Ariel Ramirez took part of it by producing the remarkable work I am providing a YT link here to a performance by a choral group and musicians of the University of California Los Angeles. The result is both impressive sounding, while keeping faithfully to the idea of Ramirez of it being very moving, but also faithful to the forms and spirit of Argentinian folk music\n\nArgentina covers a very large portion of South America, made to look smaller in most maps by the same distortion that makes Greenland look almost as large as Africa. But in reality, because of its size, it contains many different regions with quite different landscapes, climates and diverse mixes of Native American and European cultures. From all of which fairly diverse musical styles arouse and are represented here in the various parts of the mass, each of which belongs to a different traditional form typical of a different part of Argentina. Some of it shows mainly an European influence, others that of the native people, particularly in the northwest of the country, that once was part of the Incas’ Empire and, before that, of other powerful nations that had preceded the Incas. So music from there is mostly built on the pentatonic scale. This region is also part of a continuous of culture and traditions that extends from central Chile and NW Argentina, through the uplands of Bolivia and the mountains, deserts and jungles of Peru, all the way north to Ecuador.\n\nNow, here, performed by the UCLA University Chorus, Chamber Singers & Guitar Ensemble, conducted by Rebecca Lord, is Ariel Rodriguez’s “Misa Criolla”:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com\n\nThe mass is sang in Spanish and is divided in the five canonical parts, each sang to music in a different traditional Argentinian style: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus and Agnus Dei\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

So what the “fusionists” mostly do? Here is the recipe:\n\n(1) Take a few measures of, probably, something by J.S. Bach.\n\n(2) Add a dash of jazzy improvisation, and riff it wonderfully well.\n\n(3) Chill and serve with a dash of whisky (or vodka) and a corkscrew of lemon peel.\n\nIn other words, take some Bach, play it a straight for a few bars easily recognizable by many, then improvise, very loosely, on that foundation borrowed from J.S.B.\n\nBut how about going the opposite way: Create a completely original structure of sound and rhythm and color it with the right mix of instruments, then infuse it with something else from what then becomes the other half of the ‘fusion’? Why not do that as well? Well, truth be told, that it is much, much harder, because it takes not just a top instrumentalist with a knack for riffing on any giving theme, but it requires a higher level of skill both as a composer as well as a performer.\n\nNow, let me be very clear: Brubeck, Muddy Waters, and other greats were truly great. But there is always a higher level to be aspired, and when it is reached, then we have something else altogether.\n\nSo, how about the fusion of Tango and Jazz? What happens when one innovator in one musical form joins up with one in quite another?\n\nWell, this is what happened when Astor Piazzolla (Tango) and Greg Mulligan (Jazz) joined forces to make this recording:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLiJwjc6F1A\n\nOr when Piazzolla put together his own orchestra (one of several) and ‘fused’ Tango and Jazz acting both as original composer creating the musical foundation, not by borrowing it from J.S.B, for example, but entirely “from scratch” and then perform it along with the brilliant colleagues he had chosen to form his orchestra? Well this is what happened:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urou6jIXbJ8\n\nOr when Yo Yo Ma decided to put together a number of compositions from Piazzolla, and made this recording of the result:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI_aQvy1i8I\n\nSo who was Astor Piazzolla again?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Piazzolla\n\nAnd, say, who was Greg Mulligan?\n\nOh, really?\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Bach consists of a series of different types of counterpunctual music, from canon to sonata, composed by J.S.B. at the strong suggestion from King Frederick II (called “The Great”) of Prussia, who was also a respectable musician: flute player and composer whose works are still played at concerts. The king, at Bach’s request, then played a rather long theme of, presumably, his own invention, on his flute, and Bach promised to make something of it. The result is the topic of this comment.\n\nOne of the most famous parts of the “Offering”, and of the whole Bach repertoire, is the “Ricercar a 6” a composition for six voices that play both with and against each other in a most fantastic cascade of sound. Bach also wrote a version adapted for keyboard instruments, because human piano, organ, or harpsichord players only have four extremities (and only organ players can really use all four).\n\nHere is an interesting looking animation of the Ricercar a 6:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYouXtuk0T8\n\nAnd here is an episode from a German/Hungarian TV program (in German, with English subtitles) chronicling Bach’s life, with a reenactment of the meeting between the king and Bach where he got his invitation to compose a little something based on the what right away became known as the “Thema Regium” or “King’s Theme”.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdmcabpiGYU\n\nAnd here is the actual thing, all of it — to me one of the most delightful stimulant and beautiful things I have ever heard and I often listen to. (And listening to it also does make people cleverer, take it from me — although, full disclosure, I started being clever, or so my mother and some of my better girlfriends have informed me, which always helps.) The music begins with the king’s theme without any ornamentation or harmonization, just the same plain sequence of notes Frederick played in his flute, and then Bach takes it from there…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooqdCeswX9k\n\nFinally, from “Gödel, Escher Bach: an Eternal Golden Thread” by Duglas R. Hoftstadter (the book many bought because Martin Gardener so much recommended it, but never got past page 20) is this excerpt, where the actual meeting between Frederick and Bach is recounted as told by Bach’s biographers, near the beginning of Chapter 1:\n\n“One May evening in 1747, an unexpected guest showed up. Johann Nikolaus Forkel, one of Bach’s earliest biographers, tells the story as follows:\n\n‘One evening, just as he [Frederick] was getting his flute ready, and his musicians were assembled, an officer brought him a list of the strangers who had arrived. With his flute in his hand he ran over the list, but immediately turned to the assembled musicians, and said, with a kind of agitation, “Gentlemen, old Bach is come.” The flute was now laid aside, and old Bach, who had alighted at his son’s lodgings [the son was emplyed as a King’s musician], was immediately summoned to the Palace. Wilhelm Friedemann [Bach’s son], who accompanied his father, told me this story, and I must say that 1 still think with pleasure on the manner in which he related it. At that time it was the fashion to make rather prolix compliments. The first appearance of J. S. Bach before se great a King, who did not even give him time to change his traveling dress for a black chanter’s gown, must necessarily be attended with many apologies. I will not here dwell en these apologies, but merely observe, that in Wilhelm Friedemann’s mouth they made a formal Dialogue between the King and the Apologist.\n\nBut what is mere important than this is that the King gave up his Concert for this evening, and invited Bach, then already called the Old Bach, to try his fortepianos, made by Silbermann, which he kept in several rooms of the palace. [Forkel here inserts this footnote: “The pianofortes manufactured by Silbermann, of Frevberg, pleased the King se much, that he resolved to buy them all up. He collected fifteen. I hear that they all now stand unfit for use in various corners of the Royal Palace.’ ”\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

And (mostly) a fugue. But that is like saying that the Mona Lisa is “someone’s portrait.” In fact, this is one of the greatest Western classical compositions, part of Beethoven’s extraordinary late output, along with the last four quartets and the 9th Symphony. In that earlier comment, I posted a link to a YouTube video of a performance of this work by the highly regarded Alan Berg quartet.\n\nWritten at a time when the composer was completely deaf and suffering from a combination of illnesses that would eventually kill him some two years later, at the age of 56, this was a revolutionary work in its day, and therefore underappreciated, because it was so different from what audiences were used to in the first half of the 19t Century. And more than 100 years later was still a matter of serious controversy. But, with the coming of modern 20th century music and the works of Schoenberg, Stravinsky and others gaining due acceptance, this piece finally came to be appreciated properly.\n\nToday I have found another performance, this one by one of the great quartets of last century, the Borodin quartet, that recorded a good deal of Beethoven’s chamber music. I think this one is so good that I am now posting here this link to its YouTube video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aD1fFz7zEY\n\nThere is also a very good review article on this composition in Wikipedia, to be found under “Grosse Fuge.”\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

From an early age, he was the equivalent of a modern rock star, Nineteenth Century style. With all the drama and contradictions and excesses and eccentricities that go along with that.\n\nAmong all great works of classical musical, his last quartets are some of the most profound ever created. In particular, the penultimate one, number 15 is, as described in this article, a truly transcendental work of art:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200720-beethoven-250-the-ultimate-song-of-health-after-illness\n\nBeethoven composed it during his convalescence for a serious health problem (that will recur two years later and end his life). Its extraordinary third movement is known as the “Heiliger Dankgesang” or “Holy Song of Thanks.” The following excerpt gives an idea of its effect on the listener and also of the general tone of the article:\n\n“Start listening to the Heiliger Dankgesang and reality seems to hold its breath and wait. For about three heartrending minutes, the notes come glacially – so glacially, says Michiko Theurer, a violinist who has played and studied the piece, that it almost feels like a meditation exercise. This is exactly the point. Beethoven wrote this first section of the Heiliger Dankgesang in the ‘F Lydian’ mode, a scale without sharps or flats. Combined with the molto adagio pacing, the music feels stuck in an unending desert or an infinite sea – similar, Kapilow has described, to the feeling you get trapped in hospital for days without end.

The occasion and the orchestra and chorus are not mentioned in the Notes, but this could be a live recording in Washington’s Cathedral, in 1973, with members of the National Orchestra chorus and musicians, one of the many events staged in those days in opposition to the Vietnam War:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rBhzHfItg\n\nThis particular composition has been interpreted by some as expressing, if not an outright anti-war sentiment, a certain lack of enthusiasm for the business of war. After a gloomy first and middle parts, the bright end, with the cathedral bells peeling in full flight, follows the closing words of the “Agnus”: “give as peace.”\n\nAs to Owen’s: “Wilfred Owen, who wrote some of the best British poetry on World War I, composed nearly all of his poems in slightly over a year, from August 1917 to September 1918. In November 1918 he was killed in action at the age of 25, one week before the Armistice.” (Wikipedia.)\n\nAnd the poem I mentioned above, uncompromisingly written by someone who was there (warning, this is not exactly sweet and lyrical; it was not meant to be):\n\n“Dulce et Decorum Est”\n\nBy Wilfred Owen\n\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks,\n\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,\n\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs,\n\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge.\n\nMen marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,\n\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;\n\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\n\nOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.\n\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling\n\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,\n\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling\n\nAnd flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—\n\nDim through the misty panes and thick green light,\n\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\nIn all my dreams before my helpless sight,\n\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\nIf in some smothering dreams, you too could pace\n\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\n\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\n\nHis hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;\n\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\n\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\n\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\n\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—\n\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\n\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\n\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\n\nPro patria mori.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Death is, at times, blunt and harsh in his demand of the maiden’s surrender, as time consoling and kind. The maiden is, at times, terrified and, at times, resigned. It is based on a song by the same name by Schubert that was, in turn, derived from this poem by Matthias Claudius (English translation):\n\n<i>The Maiden</i>:\n\nPass me by! Oh, pass me by!\n\nGo, fierce man of bones!\n\nI am still young! Go, dear,\n\nAnd do not touch me.\n\nAnd do not touch me.\n\n<i>Death</i>:\n\nGive me your hand, you beautiful and tender form!\n\nI am a friend, and come not to punish.\n\nBe of good cheer! I am not fierce,\n\nSoftly shall you sleep in my arms!\n\nThis is a performance by the Amadeus Quartet, one ensemble that I particularly like, but there are several worthy interpretations available from YouTube by other famous ensembles. It is transferred directly from a vinyl long-play, so it comes with the occasional pop and scratch, but not enough to really matter:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmPos393bRo\n\nThe second work is Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade” with a symphonic-poem type interpretation of famous episodes of the Arab “One Thousand and One Nights” collection of ancient Middle East, Persian and Indian stories, memorably performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy, during what, I believe, was the Golden Age of this orchestra:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87VQMzN004k\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Finally discovered by the husband, he murdered both, causing a tremendous scandal, because of the shocking manner of their deaths and because both spouses’ families were very prominent in the Italian city of Rimini. The protagonists were contemporaries of the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, so he was familiar with their story.\n\nIn his theological epic, the “Comedia”, later changed to “Divina Commedia” in more modern Italian, Dante, writing for the very first time ever in the language of the people of Fourteenth Century Tuscany and not, as was then customary, in Latin, tells he story of how he followed his guide, the spirit of the Roman poet Virgil, through the three destinations of souls in the Roman Catholic afterlife: Hell (Inferno), Purgatory and Paradise, in that order, searching for his dead love Beatrice. (Purgatory was finally eliminated by the Church from this list last century.)\n\nIt is in the first section of the poem, called “Inferno”, at the beginning of the journey, that he and Virgil find themselves in the second of nine concentric “circles”: ring-shaped ledges, progressively deeper and separated by steep circular cliffs, so the whole would have looked like a bull’s eye when seen directly from above. The lower the circle, the worse the sins and punishments of those being kept in eternal torment there. At the very bottom of it all, the center of the Earth (Dante, as all his learned contemporaries, already knew our world was shaped as a sphere) stood Satan, the Fallen Angel, with three heads for ever devouring the three worst traitors: Judas Iscariot, along with Cassius and Brutus, conspirators, betrayers and killers of Julius Cesar.\n\nIn this second circle were the souls of those who broke some sexual taboo of the day, and their torment was to gyrate inside a sort of tornado or furious wind vortex that dragged, battered and hurt them for all eternity. There they saw, among others, Queen Semiramis, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy and, holding themselves in close embrace, Francesca and Paulo. He asked for them to approach so he could hear their story. Listening to them, he is overcome with such great pity that finally faints. The two lovers, who by getting close were momentarily outside the worst of the wind, so their voices could be heard, are swept, once more, into the fury of the eternal vortex. This is one of the most famous episodes in the poem (Canto V), although it is only some seventy lines long out of the total of around ten thousand.\n\nThere have been many versions of this story inspired by Dante’s, and the one that concerns us now is musical: Peter Tchaikovsky’s symphonic poem “Francesca da Rimini”, interpreted here by the Berlin Symphonic Orchestra, Vladimir Ashkenazi conducting:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIW4myGhEd8\n\nThe music begins with an ominous melody played by the orchestra’s counter-bass and winds sections that, gradually as other instruments join in, turns into a harsh, whirling evocation of the wind vortex; then the music quiets down during the dialog between Francesca and Dante, finally coming back to the initial “vortex” theme and gradually gaining in strength to culminate in a tragic sounding full orchestral tutti in the last bars of the composition.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

As a child I was very impressed by a photograph of the “Burghers of Calais”, now erected in front of the Calais Town Hall. In Paris there is a copy in the garden of the Musée Rodin, so you might have seen it there, another copy can be admired in Washington DC, in the Smithsonian Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden, near the Mall. There are several others in different countries.\n\nAs to the “Gates of Hell” by Rodin: as you know, having been also there, Florence is another place where one can see some of the noblest and most beautiful creations ever made in painting and sculpture. And there one finds the amazing “Gates of Paradise” at the entrance of the famous Baptistery of the cathedral. Here is a video that shows them in detail and gives a very good explanation of what they represent and how they came to be in the first place:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkewBPMKEk\n\nOne thing you might have seen, if you visited the “Museo dell’ Opera del Duomo”, Florence Cathedral’s museum, is the “Penitent Mary Magdalena”, a wood sculpture by Donatello. After Jesus’ death, the story goes, she left Jerusalem and went to live as a hermit in a desert and stayed there for many years making penance for her sins. When she came back into civilized life, she showed all the signs of her very hard life in the desert and that is how Donatello imagined the returning Magdalena. What he created is dramatic, shocking and amazing and I’ll never ever forget my first encounter: I was passing by, turned my head and, there, suddenly, stood in front of me a piece of wood turned into the shape of a small, wizened woman dressed in rags, with a deeply haunted look in her face; a very moving image that was also almost painfully hard to watch; a work of genius:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penitent_Magdalene_(Donatello)\n\nThere is more to see in that museum; Florence, during the Renaissance, was home to many of the greatest artists of those days.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

It does not help that this shared girlfriend (ex, for now) is now in her new job, as an (allegedly) Virgin Priestess consecrated to the god of the local temple and cannot have boyfriends. Pretty much the same problem as in “Norma” (e.g. the aria “Casta Diva” #2173326 that, along with the whole opera, is linked in this thread’s earlier comments, both with Maria Callas in the title role.)\n\nSo the bad friend, recollecting how bad he is being to his best friend (again) begins a short dramatic recitative that precedes the aria, then looks at it on the bright side and reminisces on his just concluded night of love. He does so by singing the aria this comment is all about. (For more about this opera, Wikipedia has a complete summary of the libretto, among other things.)\n\nWell, in my own life this particular bit of “The Pearl Fishers” has played a memorable role. Memorable because the first time I heard the aria “Je Crois Entendre Encoire” (“I believe I still hear”) this got a great hold on my brain and has not let go of it since. And that was many years ago. The melody and the song are not just supremely beautiful but also spellbinding — literally in my case: as in casting a binding spell. Because I believe I still hear it.\n\nHere is this aria sang by the great tenor Nicolai Gedda accompanied by a Russian orchestral group, the B. Andreeva’s Russian Folk Orchestra, circa 1980:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzIsP4HDcRc&list=PL80B59668FEC28555\n\nAnd here is the letter of that song, translated from French to English:\n\nI think I still hear,\n\nhidden under palm trees,\n\nher voice soft and sweet\n\nlike a song of wood doves.\n\nOh, night of enchantment,\n\ndivine bliss,\n\noh, sweet memory,\n\ninsane intoxication, sweet dream!\n\nIn the clear starlight,\n\nI think I still see her,\n\nRemoving her long veil\n\nin the soft night breeze.\n\nOh, night of enchantment,\n\ndivine bliss,\n\noh, sweet memory,\n\ninsane intoxication, sweet dream!\n\nsweet memory\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

That applies to discussions like this one we are having right now, where one comment has a reply and then that comment has a reply and one needs to follow the series of comments to make sense of them. But there have been very few discussions like the one we are having now in this thread, which is understandable as this is a place to comment on personal likings, but not really to discuss if what someone likes is good or bad.\n\nOn the other hand, there is plenty for anyone to browse here, as in an old fashioned bookstore full of books, for example, and maybe find things that might interest the browsing visitor. Splitting it into sections might be a convenient way to arrange this, but I have no idea of how to do it in a way that either I, or someone else, may have the time or interest in managing and keeping it organized. I am therefore for letting things just happen, as has been so far the case, and hope that a visitor will find something to enjoy here, if prepared to take the time to browse through some of the accumulated material. This is not a technical thread where people pose questions they would like to have answered quickly and to the point. More like a “chill out, man” sort of place. Or I would like to think it is.\n\nWhat would be helpful, I think, is if someone with a particular interest in Jazz, for example, started a thread dedicated to the topic. Or whatever else they might be particularly keen on, as long as there is no obstacle put in the way to those who still want to make their Jazz postings here, something that I somewhat doubt will happen if there is already a thread specialized in Jazz. That way I hope things will find their proper level and develop naturally in a way we all can find useful.\n\nIn last analysis, people can do what I do: pres control+F or Command plus F, enter the name of a composer or a title and hit return.\n\nOther voices that would like to join this conversation, please come in.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Now, the plot (based on an ancient Persian tale) is nonsense, but this is Grand Opera, so that’s par for the course. However, looking around I found today two renditions, one with some of the greatest voices ever to resonate inside an opera house. The other one, with very good if less illustrious singers, but what a setting!!! Atop the impressive royal stairs, in front of the entrance to a grand pavilion in the Forbidden City! (I think it is the Hall of Supreme Harmony.)\n\nGiaccomo Puccini died when already close to finishing the opera, at a point just after where Liù kills herself rather than to reveal the Prince’s name, and the work was concluded by a pianist and composer of considerable merit, Franco Alfano, under the strict supervision from Arturo Toscanini and Puccini’s publisher Tito Ricordi, who wanted to make sure that the added part (based on sketches made by Puccini) blended seamlessly with the rest of the opera.\n\nThe first performance was conducted by Toscanini. When they got to the funeral cortège of Liù, Toscanini put down the baton, ending the performance with the statement: “Here ends the opera, because at this point the Maestro died.” A full performance, including Alfano’s ending, took place the next evening, but with someone else as conductor.\n\nSo here is the first recording, with no live video, only static portraits of singers and scenes of the opera. Joan Sutherland in the title role as the cruel and icy cold princess Turandot, Luciano Pavarotti as the Prince of Tartary that defies death to solve her three puzzles and gain her heart and hand, Monsterrat Caballé as the faithful unto death slave Liù and Nicolai Ghiaurov as Timur, the prince’s father and deposed King of Tartary.

Bach’s very last work, many years in writing and still incomplete at the time of his death. Although there is disagreement on whether its creation was terminated by his death, or by Bach’s intention to have others continue it by writing their own contributions, so the whole thing might have been meant to be something for people to learn, practice playing and write contrapuntal music.\n\nThe music was written in “open score”, meaning that every voice in the 12 fugues and 2 cannons was written with the voices in separate, or “open” staves, as if every voice corresponded to a different instrument, although several could be played simultaneously on the same instrument, in particular one with a keyboard.\n\nThe very last fugue, for four voices, ends abruptly in the middle of a measure with the series of four notes (in German notation) BACH.\n\nWhenever, precisely did Bach stop writing this work, whether deliberately, or because of dying, he actually did die in 1750, and the next year the whole work was tidied up by other musicians, because it had been left in obvious need of cleaning up and editing. And that is how it has come to us.\n\nThere are, as allowed by the open staves notation, many different interpretations, some for solo harpsichord, organ, or piano, and others for different kinds of musical ensembles.\n\nThis one is by the Academy Of St Martin In The Fields, with Sir Neville Marriner conducting:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5FPC3nSn1E\n\nOn world history and listening to the “The Art of the Fugue”:\n\nI remember, back in ’91, listening in the audience to an interpretation of this work by a small orchestra in the Matthias Church in the Buda side of Budapest, in Hungary. Towards the very end, the instruments went silent, one by one, and only the oboe continued, eerily alone and then stopped suddenly on the last note of that BACH sequence.\n\nIt was a time of heightened worries, of potential great danger, and also of great hope: it was a time when it was impossible not to be very emotional. And, perhaps because of this, that ending left many of us dabbing tears from our eyes. A moment in time, at a time of tremendous changes in the world around us with some of them very uncomfortably near us.\n\nI had gone to visit Budapest in 1991 by ferry, along the Danube, after attending a large meeting on my specialty in Vienna, during the early days of Hungary’s newly gained independence from the Soviet Union and, while being there, occurred the coup by hard-line Cold-War throwback politicians and military officers that deposed the liberalizing “General Secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR”, Mikhail Gorbachev, carting away him and his wife Raisa to be imprisoned somewhere, it was rumored that in a dacha on the shores of the Black Sea.\n\nI could follow the events happening in Moscow on the TV in my hotel room, because there was CNN there and in Hungary! And there was a McDonald’s in the very center of the city! And the former “Bookshop of the Friendship of the Marxist-Leninist Peoples” (this name written in German), also in the center of town, now had in its display no longer books on Dialectic Materialism, Social Revolution, or the Contradictions of Capitalism, but books on computers, on how to start your own business, on how to invest on stock and bonds and make money. So, while life was, on the surface, seemingly as it had been for a long time there, change was becoming obvious everywhere one looked. But also, deep down, there was a shared sinking feeling that any time now Soviet tanks might come, rumbling along the beautiful signature boulevards of the city, as they did in 1957, in early November, to squash flat the patriotic Hungarian Revolution that had started in June of that distant year.\n\nAnd one day, when my stay was coming to its end in that beautiful city now so haunted by the tragic past, also at my hotel and on CNN, I saw the moment when the coup began to fail, followed no long after by the return of a haggard-looking Gorbachev with a shaken-looking Raisa by his side, he to be reinstated to his former position and, not much later, finding himself, again (but this time peacefully) out of power, be able to contemplate the final unraveling of the Soviet Union. This was the moment I witness thanks to CNN, as it happened: Boris Yeltsin, then the Major of Moscow, climbing on top of a tank that had been stopped by a civilian crowd when on its way to attack the Duma, the national Parliament, and so I saw Boris telling its crew and so letting it be known by the Soviet armed forces, the coup leaders now illegally commanding them, and the world at large, that the coup was doomed, it was all over, because the people were dead against it.\n\nWhat he told the crew was: “Are you going to shoot at us? Or maybe you’d rather come over to our side and start defending the parliament?” And so they did and so it was. And the rest is history. So you probably already know what happened after that.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

One reason for this could be that they are easy to carry around and another, that good ones tend to be less expensive than high quality violins, for example. And having frets in the neck is definitely a plus.\n\nNow days there is a new group of highly talented virtuoso performers, some of whom might rise to equal or even surpass those great masters of fifty and more years ago. They also bring a different, 21st century sensitivity to their playing.\n\nHere, two of these first-line guitar players of today (and good looking ones too) can be seen and heard in classical compositions, of course, but also in a Bossa Nova piece, in a Paraguayan Polka-Galopa, and an Argentinian tango, the latter in its “progressive” style created by its composer, who was classically trained (*), and that is, in its own genre, comparable to the jazz of a John Coltrane or a Thelonius Monk:\n\nAna Vidovic\n\nClassical guitar recital, Baden-Baden, Germany, 2019:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IEezGQwgZk\n\n00:00​ Cello Suite No 1 BWV 1007 by Johann Sebastian Bach\n\n0:11​ Prelude\n\n2:57​ Allemande\n\n7:04​ Courante\n\n09:35​ Sarabande\n\n12:26​ Menuet I / II\n\n15:04​ Gigue\n\n16:47​ Grande Ouverture Op. 61 by Mauro Giuliani\n\n25:16​ Sonata in A major K 322 by Domenico Scarlatti\n\n28:22​ Sonata in E major K 380 by Domenico Scarlatti\n\n33:49​ Recuerdos de la Alhambra by Francisco Tárrega\n\n38:00​ Coughing by an anonymous fan in the public\n\n38:11​ La Catedral by Agustín Barrios Mangoré\n\n45:39​ Una Limosna Por el Amor de Dios by Agustin Barrios Mangoré\n\n49:35​ Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart Op 9 by Fernando Sor\n\n58:09​ Asturias by Isaac Albéniz\n\nNadia Kossinskaya\n\nHere at the Concert Hall De Vereeniging in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, the 27th of September 2014:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thikvNox65g\n\n(*) Ástor Piazzolla “Oblivion” (played by Kossinskaya.)\n\nThis is a composition written originally for Piazzolla’s favorite instrument, a form of evolved concertina known as “bandoneon” (having been invented by a German whose last name was ‘Ban’) and a piece that has been transcribed to a hard-to-believe number of different instruments and combinations of instruments, for example one recorded by Yo-Yo Ma on the cello.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

(Who I believe, at the time, was also already her husband.) And this is the one where she breaks a string at mid-performance and goes out and comes back, all in a matter of a few short minutes, with the cello in proper order and showing throughout an absolute self-control, acting as if this was nothing worth noticing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_yxtaeFuEQ\n\nThe delight comes from listening to this beautiful work performed by a great orchestra with a talented conductor and with the soloist part played by possibly the most gifted and greatest cellist of the 20th Century, or perhaps of all times, full stop.\n\nThe point of interest is that, without taking anything away from its excellent performance, the orchestra is made completely of men, and only Eurasian men at that. The soloist was the only woman on the Albert Hall stage on that now far away day, back in the 70’s. Looking at recent videos of orchestral music, such as any of the many linked in this thread, with great contemporary orchestras giving equally excellent performances, the contrast cannot be more remarkable, in my opinion. And this is always the case when comparing orchestras of forty or fifty years ago with present day ones. And it always this strikes me with the feeling that I am listening to an old recording from some parallel universe. Even when I was around and listening to some of these orchestras, back in the day, and then, to me, there seemed to be nothing remarkable about their composition.

Intego AV\n\nToday I was listening on National Public Radio to a recorded 2017 performance of Antonin Dvořák’s opera “Rusalka” at the New York’s Metropolitan Opera (*) (normally it would have been today’s performance, but the current misery upon us has the great concert halls and opera houses, along with so much more, still closed “sine die .” And while listening I realized that there is little Dvořák in this thread and certainly none of his operas. These were less famous than they deserved, because of the language barrier, but this has changed over time and now days “Rusalka”, “Vanda”, etc. are staples of the international repertoire.\n\nThe story in “Rusalka” is based on a fairy tale and is similar in general terms to Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid”, only that ends in reverse.\n\nA rusalka is a water nymph, or sprite, in Czech mythology.\n\nSame as the little mermaid of the Dane’s tale, she falls in love with a prince he sees one day passing by and desperately wants to be able to become his lover. To do that she first must become human. But if the prince does not love her in return, and here is the reversal, she will become a death demon and her kiss will be his death.\n\nWell, as a human, things work rather well, but not well enough, between her and the prince, so she becomes the demon and the opera ends soon after she kisses the prince, who is not deterred by the fact that her kiss must kill him, because he finds no point in living on without her.\n\n(I am not like that; I have never been happy to break up with someone, even if she was a demon; very sad, very painful indeed. But there are more fish in the water, you know? Lighten up! I say.)\n\nOf the whole opera, perhaps the most famous part and a truly beautiful passage, is when Rusalka (a ‘rusalka’, a water-spirit, but here also called like that as if it was her given name) sings the “Song of the Moon”, where she pleads with a powerful witch to turn her into a human.\n\nDvorak Rusalka Song of the Moon: Three performances by three great singers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzgQPjbDTMM\n\n(*) Kristine Opolais sings the title character’s “Song to the Moon” from Act I of “Rusalka” at the final dress rehearsal, March of 2017, Metropolitan Opera; Conductor: Sir Mark Elder; Production: Mary Zimmerman. — This is one has an English translation in subtitles.\n\nFrederika von Stade ; Seiji Ozawa Conductor Orchestra ? :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwVYFpY3VL4\n\nLeontine Price:\n\nWith no mention of conductor or orchestra, an extraordinary rendition of this moving song of painful longing, with, in the background of the video, a series of portraits of the most famous, and some less so, singers of the past century:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdgKA_gfz7Y\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

It could be done for some sounds, but is never more than in a few, occasional bars. There are exceptions, such as in Rimsky-Korsakov’s “The Flight of the Bumblebee”, but even there the real sound has been reinterpreted by the artist and made into much more than a faithful imitation of how bumblebees sound when they fly.\n\nWhen it comes to examples of Romantic idea of The Sublime expressed in music, I am hard press to find one that particularly stands out as an example, but I might have found it here; you will be the judge of how close to the mark my choice is. You are also encouraged to include in your own comments other examples you think may be even better:\n\nBeethoven 6th Symphony: The West-East Divan Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim, the BBC Proms 2010.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW-7CqxhnAQ\n\n(*) The late Sir Isaiah Berlin’s writings on this subject are probably the closest to the definite work on European Romanticism and its more significant effects through time, both good and bad; for example, how it resonated among the university students and the more liberal thinkers that were their intellectual leading lights, in the 1960’s and early to mid 70’s.\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berlin/\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

Also a very fine voice and impressive coordination of the words with the music. I think that whatever she does for a living now, if she ever wanted to make a change, there can be a bright future for her as voice artist in animated movies and in foreign-movies dubbing, where spoken words have to be coordinated very well with the movement of a character’s lips. But I would prefer that she keeps singing. Also there are very few European languages where something like what she does is possible, because only in these the pronunciation of the vowels is crisp and distinct enough: Spanish: Greek, German, Italian, and if I missing another one, do let me know.\n\nAnd not to be tedious, but I still would like to hear about what people might like better as examples of The Sublime in Romantic music (see my previous comment just above fjpb’s).\n\nAs an encouragement, here is another possible candidate for a good example of this central idea of Romanticism, that owed a great deal to some of Jean Jacques Rousseau’s ideas that he started developing around 1760, of a return to nature and to a more humane and natural form of life. (Rousseau had fights with just about everybody that knew him and was into just about everything, from writing philosophical and political books of great consequence to political developments in the century and a half to follow and even in recent times, to composing and playing music with distinction, to proposing a better way to educate children, to making important contributions to the writing of the French Encyclopedia, to inventing a novel system of musical notation.)\n\nMy new example of the feeling of The Sublime expressed in music is the late Romantic composer Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C major that just happens to be played, in this video, by another Spanish lady — or Catalán lady, depending on whom you ask:\n\nThe amazing Alicia de La Rocha, piano, with the Great Symphonic Orchestra of the Radio and Television of the URSS, Conductor: Vladimir Fedoseyev, live recording at the 1983 Festival of Santander, Spain.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hWyApq77_g\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

So it is all about the Romantic idea, already fully developed at the time, of being face to face with The Sublime in Nature.\n\nAs to what else in the Romantic repertoire could fit explicitly with this idea?\n\nMaybe this one?\n\nDetroit Symphony Orchestra, Fabien Gabel conducting “La Mer” by Claude Debussy:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-kZN97ir_4\n\nOr maybe Mendelssohn’s “Las Hebrides”, the Overture in particular (already linked to an excellent performance in this thread: search for “Mendelssohn.”)\n\nGarth suggestion:\n\n“Wagenlied” or “Lullaby” is a song of great power and beauty, and Richard Strauss was one of the finest writers of both gentle and very deeply moving songs. And great operas.\n\nFor those who would like to listen to another example, search in this page with your browser for “Last Four Songs.”\n\nMy own favorite is the last of the four, “Im Abendrot” or “At Evening’s Twilight.” A beautiful and soothing song about approaching one’s death with a resigned calm and even with relief.

Or the vowels are just left there for people, whether native English speakers or not, to guess how they are supposed to sound when spoken in, to them, unfamiliar words. Also English is a language usually spoken more slowly than those others, with the exception of German.\n\nBut English patter singing, hard as it might be, is not quite impossible, at least as long as the singer’s diction is that of “Proper” or “the King’s/Queen’s English”, or “Standard English” speech, as spoken, until not so long ago at least, in the UK.\n\nThere are examples of this, most notably “The Pirates of Penzance’s” patter song “I am the very model of a modern Major-General”, also known as “The Major-General’s Song”.\n\nA very skilled performer could do it, achieving a truly amazing speed in the full recap at the end of the song.\n\nThis is a video of this very song as sang during a filmed performance produced in 1983, the year after the company finally closed down after 112 years of staging Gilbert and Sullivan’s creations:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVFiRXch7Pk\n\nFrom the Y.T. Notes: “Wiki says: I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General (often referred to as the Major-General’s Song or Modern Major-General’s Song) is a patter song from Gilbert and Sullivan’s 1879 comic opera The Pirates of Penzance. It is perhaps the most famous song in all of Gilbert and Sullivan’s operas. It is sang by Major-General Stanley at his first entrance, towards the end of Act I. The song satirizes the idea of the “modern” educated British Army officer of the latter 19th century. It is one of the most difficult patter songs to perform, due to the fast pace and tongue-twisting nature of the lyrics. “\n\nThe D’Oyly Carte Company and the Gilbert and Sullivan Comic Operas:\n\nD’Oyly Carte was a British comic opera company. Extremely successful on account of the popularity of the Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic operas, that it was formed in 1875 by the theatrical entrepreneur Richard D’Oyly to produce them, it eventually became a famous international touring company. London-based, it had the Savoy Theatre built there for the production of the G&S repertoire. Eventually it performed to great success, mainly in the UK, Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand, where there were also many local professional and amateur productions of these works staged until at least the late 80’s.\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

There are three parts to this piece: a slow, sad, regretful beginning from the point of view of someone’s present lived without a hope of further happiness; it slowly brightens as the mind of the melancholic is taken over by a remembrance of happier times; but then the mood darkens again to deep sadness, because of the realization that that brief joy just felt, still tainted with regret, is nothing more than an evocation of ghosts of a past, and now irretrievable lost, happy and hopeful life.\n\nKarajan’s version is a very good one, although it does not emphasize the “happier memories” part as much as I am used to hear it.\n\nAs to the Karelia suit: this Sargent version is the best I have heard posted in YouTube. A real treat, with the right Sibelian feeling for the natural world, the landscape and, in particular, the forests, of his native land.\n\nNow here is one more from Sibelius, also a short one, based on one the many Finn legends that inspired him, this one not a really happy one, about a dead hero and his mother’s obsession with bringing him back to life by the shores of the River of Death, where he must live again to kill a swan that circles there round a fateful island, whose passing gliding by is evoked by the darker and haunting notes of a melody played on the English horn over muted strings:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY_PE4TgRkM\n\nAnd the 2nd Symphony, in a rousing performance by a German orchestra conducted by a definitely Finn lady, and one that I think might please Garth:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXU8EXL7a_4\n\nPlus some reading material on the Finn legend that inspired the first composition above:\n\nhttps://ferrebeekeeper.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/the-swan-of-tuonela/\n\nEx-Windows user (Win. 98, XP, 7); since mid-2017 using also macOS.

In the hands of an accomplished violinist, to be sure, but it is obvious that while getting such a sound is in part a matter of skill, it is also in part a matter of the quality of the instrument itself. A quality that makes it possible to hear it always clearly, because its sound can be produced at the right volume whether in a soft and intimate passage, or in a virtuoso bravura one played while the whole orchestra is playing “fortissimo.”\n\nSo I got curious about this remarkable instrument and did a little research on it. And this is what came out:\n\nHahn has two Vuillaume violins: one made in 1864, a copy of a Guarneri “Cannone” (“Cannon”, because of the strong sound that could be produced with this mode"
