It may be perceived as a Hall of Fame listing, as well a device that can popularize the bass history. It may also be used to help us define important anniversaries for the years to come.\n\nThe calendar offers the following categories of entries: the birthday listing of all bassist who have made a lasting contribution, the birthday listing of important composers of bass music, the birthday listing of other great composers who have left a mark on bass heritage, the premieres of important solo pieces, the premieres of chamber music with bass and the important orchestra, oratorio, opera and ballet premieres. Included are also jazz bassists, electric bass players and even present-day pop music icons who have been associated with bass instrument.\n\nShould you be aware of any other important bass personality, or a date of an important bass event that is not listed here, please send us a memo and we will be happy to include it here.\n\n–\n\nJanuary\n\nFebruary\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nDecember\n\nPage Development Assistance\n\n–\n\nJanuary\n\n–\n\nJanuary 1\n\n1862 – born: Max Dauthage\n\nJanuary 2\n\n1912 – born: André Ameller in Arnaville, Meurthe et Moselle, France\n\nJanuary 4\n\n1910 – born: Parks Grant in Cleveland, OH, US\n\n1938 – born: Olli Kosonen in Helsinki, Finland\n\nJanuary 7\n\n1936 – born: Eldee Young in Chicago, IL, US\n\nJanuary 9\n\n1819 – born: František Gregora in Netolice, Bohemia\n\nJanuary 11\n\n1875 – born: Reinhold Glière in Kiev, Ukraine\n\nJanuary 19\n\n1787 – premiere: Symphony no. 38 “Prague” by Mozart in Prague\n\n1919 – born: Israel Crosby in Chicago, US\n\n1936 – born: Elliott Schwartz (composer) in New York, NY, US\n\nJanuary 22\n\n1924 – born: Alfred Planyavsky in Vienna, Austria\n\nJanuary 23\n\n1861 – born: František Černý in Pardubice, Bohemia\n\nJanuary 24\n\n1782 – born: Friedrich Hofmeister (publisher) in Strehla, Germany\n\nJanuary 25\n\n1891 – born: Wellman Braud in St. James Parish, Louisiana, US\n\n1928 – born: Andrzej Cwojdziński in Jaworznie, Poland\n\nJanuary 26\n\n1748 – born: Emanuel Förster in Niederstaina, Saxony, Germany\n\n1911 – premiere: “Der Rosenkavalier” by R.
