        "text": "ISL Championships: 2015, 2017\n\nNew England Championships (Class B): 2009, 2016, 2017, 2022\n\nWith a team culture based on family and selflessness, Governor’s field hockey has achieved a history of success – not just in the many ISL and NEPSAC banners lining Alumni Gym, but in the team’s tradition of players competing for something that is greater than themselves and understanding that everyone has a role on the roster. The excitement of the season comes from exploring, discovering, and defining that role, and building on it from year to year.\n\nA 100 x 120-yard all-weather turf, the William L. Alfond Class of ’67 Field provides an outstanding venue for both games and practices. The team’s newly renovated locker room offers ample space for pre-game preparation, film review, and team meetings. Athletes also utilize the Alfond Fitness Center & Weight Room and Pescosolido Field House for lifting, speed training, and out-of-season stick skills practice. Staffed by two full-time athletic trainers, the sports medicine facility provides personalized attention and rehabilitation for those who need attention to injuries.\n\nPlayers prepare for the fall with summer captains’ practices and a focused training plan. Many returning varsity team members also compete in the US Field Hockey Nexus program or play for local club teams such as Northeast Elite, East Coast Wizards, and Seacoast United. Prospective varsity contributors arrive on campus for a four-day preseason that includes drills, small-sided play, and evening scrimmages. In-season practices are designed to balance fitness, skills, and concepts with a commitment to bringing complete effort and focus day in and day out. Coaches value team-building off the field, prioritizing team dinners, beach trips, and alumni connections, and believe that the only way to find success is through an entire team effort.\n\nCompeting in the ISL provides a challenge in every match-up. All twelve ISL teams are regularly strong contenders for the New England Championships, so showing up to every game with determination and focus is paramount. Out-of-league games include an end-of-season showdown against Westminster, a perennial powerhouse in Connecticut to prepare the team for postseason play. Phillips Andover, Pingree, Austin Prep, and Dexter Southfield add some local schools to the schedule as well. In 2022, Govs earned the top seed in the New England Class B Tournament. The team defeated Suffield Academy, Brooks School, and Middlesex School to win the tournament, bringing the fourth New England field hockey banner to Byfield.\n\nThe coaching staff is prepared and motivated to support athletes eager to take their game to the next level. Many recent field hockey alumni have continued their careers at top NCAA Division I, II, and III programs including Boston College, Boston University, Bowdoin College, Colgate University, Lehigh University, Princeton University, University of New Hampshire, Trinity College, and Wake Forest University.\n\nFor more information, please reach out to Coach Katie White"
