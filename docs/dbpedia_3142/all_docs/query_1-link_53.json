        "text": "The Governing Body is made up of:\n\nEleven Foundation Governors\n\nThe majority of members of the Governing Body are appointed by the diocese of Westminster. These are active members of the local Catholic community.\n\nCurrent Foundation governors are:\n\nMr Gianluca Marcato (Chairman), Professor of Finance and Real Estate, Henley Business School (University of Reading)\n\nMrs Maude Plantenga Wehry (Vice Chair), Freelancer in Project Management\n\nMs Margaret O’ Riordan, Executive Coach and Drama Teacher (20+ years in Banking)\n\nMr John Lee, School Building Fund Administrator, Diocese of Westminster\n\nMs Maud Millar, CEO, Get Adapt Ltd; COO, The Millar Agency; Team Leader, AQA\n\nMs Elaine Pinkster, Marketing, strategy, and communications professional\n\nMs Sophie Leech, Teacher\n\nMr Leo Keay, Parliamentary Researcher\n\nCo-opted Governor\n\nMrs Jane Carrington, Headteacher of Primary School in Westminster\n\nParent Governor\n\nThis member is elected by the parents of, or those with parental responsibility for, full-time students of the College.\n\nStaff Governors\n\nThese members are elected by the staff. Both teaching and support staff are eligible for election.\n\nCurrent Staff governors are:\n\nMs Lena Abbas, A-level Art Teacher and Head of BTEC Art & Design at St Charles\n\nStudent Governors\n\nZara Farooqi and Ali Mohammadipour\n\nThe Principal\n\nThe Principal is ex officio a member of the Governing Body. Current Principal is Mr Martin Twist.\n\nAttending a meeting as a member of the public\n\nPermission to attend is at the Chair’s discretion. If you wish to attend a meeting, please contact the Clerk to the Governors by email – s.jacobs@stcharles.ac.uk\n\nPlease state your name and the meeting(s) you wish to attend and your contact details.\n\nThe relevant Chair will then be in touch with you.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nAll correspondence for members of the Governing Body should be addressed to\n\nMrs Susan Jacobs\n\nClerk to the Governing Body,\n\nc/o St Charles Catholic Sixth Form College,\n\nSt Charles Square,\n\nLondon W10 6EY or by email - s.jacobs@stcharles.ac.uk\n\nSt. Charles College welcomes students of all religious backgrounds who wish to pursue their studies in an explicitly Christian context.\n\nOn the application form all students, including those from outside the Catholic tradition, will be asked to make clear their reasons for wanting to study at a Catholic College. This statement is not used to determine the offer of places, but represents an opportunity for applicants to acknowledge the religious nature of the College and how they could be supportive of it.\n\nIn the event of over-subscription the Governors have established the following criteria\n\nAs the College has been designed with the needs of students with disabilities in mind, the governors will give priority of consideration to applications from such students, who have an open choice of course at enrolment, assuming they meet the required entry criteria for their preferred courses.\n\nStudents from the partner Catholic secondary schools who do not have their own sixth form provision have an open choice of course at enrolment, assuming they meet the required entry criteria for their preferred courses. These schools ar eSt. Thomas More in Sloane Square and All Saints College on St Charles Square.\n\nCatholic students from other secondary schools.\n\nStudents from outside the Catholic tradition in other secondary schools.\n\nStudents in categories 3 and 4 will negotiate a course programme prior to enrolment, and will be offered a place on this basis. We will guarantee this programme should the student reach the necessary entry criteria. Otherwise, such a student can still take up their place at the College, but their choice, of course, may be limited by their GCSE grades and the availability of course places. The entry criteria for programme levels and individual courses are published in the prospectus and the course descriptions are available at the College and on our web-site. These criteria are the same for students from the partner schools as they are for those outside this group.\n\nStudents can be refused the offer of a place at the\n\nCollege if\n\nTheir reference makes it clear that they are not supported by their current teachers for further progression in full-time education.\n\nThey have course or career preferences which simply cannot be accommodated within the College's current course offer.\n\nTheir application is received after the end of April and the College is likely to have reached its target offer total. These students will be offered places on the waiting list."
