        "text": "Throughout the generations powers have vied for more power and consolidated against a common enemy. John's vision sows us powers consolidating against the Lamb, but it is a doomed effort in Revelation 17: \"These are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast; they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.\" The message to the church in John's day is the message to all of God's people of every generation: Jesus, not Caesar, is Lord. Jesus is King. Those with him are chosen and faithful. Don't worry. ------------------------------- Historical note: The title King of Kings, possibly originating in Persia and other counties of the region, was a designation bestowed upon or adopted by ancient despots and rulers. Thus Rome is often encoded as Babylon in the book of Revelation and generally refers to mood and methods of empire that rise and fall through history, warring with the righteous. But Jesus is set forth as the King of Kings in every age and the Age to come. ------------------------------- https://lnkd.in/gShp2Uw2\n\nSince the early 2000s, wars on political doctrines and correctness had winded down; hence, democracy - the freedom for people to choose their elected officials- has won, taking quite substantial shapes across the globe. However, on the other hand, the world economy has come to mean that we have gotten to do whatever it takes to reduce poverty in every corner of the world.Monarchs in large parts of Europe have shown their mights and the need to exist since the end of World War II. Yes, they have less focused on politics, and rather given as much focus on the global economy; as it happens,they have won quite enormously on the world stage. As Europe has less asserted political controls, we happen to see more of an ideological shift, with political control or manipulations. In terms of Monarchy, we are talking about heredity, where political power is subjected to family ties. The United Kingdom has served as the epicenter for monarchs ' rules. As it happens to be the case, the United Kingdom has transformed quite enormously as that of North America and others of Asia as well. Hence, Europe has clearly sold itself to the world of its expanded agendas. The bottomline has been that everything has to return quite perfectly in terms of politics and the economy."
