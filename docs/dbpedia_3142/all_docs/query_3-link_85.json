        "text": "Jeffco Public Schools takes pride in providing a world-class education that prepares all Jeffco students for bright and successful futures.\n\nThis year, 10 schools from the Green Mountain and Jefferson articulation areas will pilot Khanmigo, a dedicated Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool for students, families and staff to use during the school day and at home. During this pilot year, we will see if and how Khanmigo helps students in grades 5, 6, 8 and 9 navigate the core subjects (math, literacy, science and social studies).\n\nKhanmigo was launched by Khan Academy in 2023 and is one of their first dedicated AI tools for schools. Khan Academy is a well-established non-profit online education company that provides supplemental resources for students and families. Jeffco’s digital vendors, including Khanmigo, follow state and federal rules and district policies regarding student privacy.\n\nJeffco is thrilled to be one of the few districts in Colorado and among 60 or so across the country to partner with Khan Academy on Khanmigo. Truly, an AI tool like Khanmigo could become as common to our children’s educational experience as their computer or a Google search. This pilot will allow Jeffco students, staff and family to test drive the product and see what we find.\n\nImportantly, Khanmigo and Khan Academy’s curricula are not replacements for the work we do in school or our curricula. Khanmigo is only a tool – like a computer or Google search – that families and teachers may be able to use to help drive student learning.\n\nWe are excited about the opportunities the Khanmigo pilot presents to enhance our students' learning experiences and support our educators in delivering high-quality education.\n\nAdditional Resources"
