        "text": "The year 2022-23 was an exciting one for Cargilfield as we approached our 150th anniversary in 2023. In addition to the normal day-to-day and strategic challenges facing most independent schools, there has, therefore, been the excitement of creating an events programme that would bring different constituents of the School community together to celebrate this anniversary: reminding us all that Cargilfield was Scotland’s first preparatory school.\n\nThis year has seen us reach out to former pupils, parents, staff and governors and entertain them at the New Club in Edinburgh and at the House of Lords in the Palace of Westminster. We have held a musical concert and art exhibition for former pupils. We also filled the Queen’s Hall in Edinburgh to watch a 150 theatrical performance. We were delighted to welcome an audience of over 600 to watch children from Primary 1 to Form 8 perform in this show which told the story of the last 150 years of school, nation and world.\n\nAs the year came to a close, the Headmaster, Rob Taylor, and much of the senior management team were joined by children, staff, parents and governors – past and present - as they walked over 150km of the Western Front Way in Northern France and Belgium. This route was inspired by a former Cargilfield Head Boy, 2nd Lt Alexander Gillespie, whose body was never recovered at the Battle of Loos in 2015. Individual wreaths were laid at the graves or memorials of 65 old boys who died during the First World War. The Headmaster was joined by Emilie Murdoch of Form 4 and Jonathan Dunlop (the Head Boy at Cargilfield when we celebrated our centenary in 1973) in laying a wreath at the Last Post Ceremony at the Menin Gate on 5th August.\n\nThe 150th anniversary celebrations continued by including a school beach day, the first Foundation Day, a special 150th service to mark the 100th anniversary of our memorial Chapel and an afternoon of former pupil hockey matches. The celebrations will close with an anniversary ball in the school grounds in June 2024.\n\nThis year also saw Cargilfield face two major inspections. The first was an unannounced inspection of its boarding provision by the Care Inspectorate in September 2022. This asked the question how the School supported the children’s rights and well-being and how children feel safe, well loved and get the most out of life. For both categories, the Care Inspectorate evaluated our performance as ‘5 - Very Good’, in a scale of 1-6.\n\nIn March 2023, we received three weeks’ notice of a full School Inspection from Education Scotland. This was a five day inspection involving three full-time members of the inspection team and supported by a visiting independent school headteacher and another lay inspector. An extremely rigorous process examined Cargilfield under the following categories:\n\nLeadership of Change Learning, Teaching and Assessment Well-being, Equality and Inclusion Raising Attainment and Achievement\n\nAgain, we were pleased to be judged as ‘Very Good’ for the first three categories and absolutely delighted to receive ‘Excellent’ for raising attainment and achievement. This highest category is one that is used sparingly by Education Scotland and marks the School as genuinely sector leading. Our Lead Inspector described this performance as being something that would be worth travelling across the country to observe.\n\nWhile external inspections are not the only means by which we evaluate our performance, there is no question that that this sort of rigorous and objective benchmarking offers reassurance to all members of the School community.\n\nThe School Nursery was not included in the Education Scotland review and is expecting its own inspection very soon. This was last inspected by the Care Inspectorate in March 2017, and was awarded ‘Very Good’ in both of the categories examined: quality of care and support; and quality of management and leadership. To conclude, the report stated that ‘The staff had high expectations for all children, resulting in confident, motivated, successful learners.’ Beach and Forest Nursery programmes as well as other aspects of outdoor learning remain especially popular.\n\nWe are delighted that both inspection reports reflected the strengths that Cargilfield exhibits within the teaching and learning and pastoral care offered within the School. This reflects the excellent work done by the teams of Curriculum and Pastoral Leaders. These are interested professionals who help to set strategy and review policies for curriculum and pastoral care. The pastoral team is new to Cargilfield this year and has been working hard to make better use of the School’s management information system and to start a review of behaviour and anti-bullying policies.\n\nWith an average of 14-15 pupils per class across the School, class sizes remained appropriate to the Cargilfield approach. In Form 8, 42 children sat 13+ Scholarship or Common Entrance, with all those leaving this year gaining entry into their chosen senior schools. A remarkable 31 scholarships were won by the leaving cohort - and these included 9 academic awards with the top awards at Harrow and Fettes within this group. We are proud of the School’s ongoing record for scholarship awards and the reputation we have built amongst some of Edinburgh’s top schools and the most selective boarding schools across the U.K.\n\nThe destination schools remain as diverse as the talents of the pupils themselves, and this year included, in Edinburgh, George Heriot’s School, Edinburgh Academy and Fettes College. Further afield in Scotland these included Glenalmond College, Kilgraston School and Strathallan School. Further south, Cargilfield pupils have been admitted to Harrow School, Marlborough College, Oundle School, Radley College, Sedbergh School, Shrewsbury School, Stowe School, Uppingham School, Westminster School and Wycombe Abbey. At Cargilfield our children make a strong community with lifelong friends, but are happy and confident to go forth to whatever senior school suits them the best, as an individual. For some that will be local day schools, for others boarding at some of Britain’s finest schools – near or far. The Headmaster and the whole school team are here to support children and their families understand and make these next-step decisions.\n\nThis year has seen a group of Form 8 children entering the UK Rocketry competition for the first time. As the only junior school in Scotland to have entered this competition, the team earned a special commendation.\n\nOther academic highlights for the year included our sixth Book Festival (our best yet) and ongoing success in academic competitions such the Townsend Warner History competition, the Shrewsbury Science Competition and the UK Mathematics Challenge – at both junior and senior levels. We have enjoyed a series of science and technology workshops offered by Oundle School, Imperial College and the Institute of Engineering and Technology. We have also actively sought a wide range of speakers for the children.\n\nThis was another successful year for debating: one of the most prominent activities at Cargilfield. All senior children meet fortnightly to consider a range of topical and philosophical concepts and our senior team retained the Scottish Prep Schools’ Title.\n\nThe School continues to promote an all-round education in every way for each child. The music, art, design and technology departments provide an excellent outlet for the nurturing of specific talents, as well as offering cross-curricular opportunities into the main academic syllabus.\n\nThe School continues to promote an all-round education in every way for each child. The music, art, design and technology departments provide an excellent outlet for the nurturing of specific talents, as well as offering cross-curricular opportunities into the main academic syllabus.\n\nArt continues to be a strength at Cargilfield and a popular activity that runs throughout the day with break-time and extra clubs. The Art Scholars’ group remains a goal for talented and enthusiastic artists at the top of the School. Their weekend trip to Hospitalfield House and regular day trips to Edinburgh galleries allow us to make best use of local and regional facilities.\n\nMusic is a significant part of school life. Recorded weekly concerts which can be easily shared with more distant family and friends are a throwback to COVID but now supplement the regular pattern of live performance in many different formats. Indeed, 90% of children aged 8 and above are learning musical instruments (over a third of the Upper School learn more than one) and there were 14 different groups or ensembles playing in the Summer term with a total of 147 participants. Of the 97 music exams taken last year, 28% were passed with a distinction and 51% were passed with a merit. Seven children in the school have now achieved Grade 5 in music theory.\n\nTheatre and drama continue to be an important at Cargilfield. In addition to the year-group plays across the School, the 150th anniversary gave is a special focus for a whole-school performance. We are grateful to a former Cargilfield family who supported us in taking over a professional theatre for our performance in the last week of the year. As with art and music, those children who wish to focus on performance are able to be part of a group of drama scholars. The weekly evening club also worked towards a lovely informal performance in the school library in March.\n\nA key feature of Cargilfield life is a daily programme of games for all children in the Upper School and the range of sporting fixtures available to children of different ages and abilities is impressive. Once again, we had three teams represent Scotland in the IAPS Hockey Finals. The first rugby and netball teams were both the strongest on our circuit but, more importantly, we have now established touring opportunities for boys and girls at under 11 and under 13 age groups. These are offered to all those keen to participate and not just those selected for the first team.\n\n2023 saw further development of girls’ cricket with regular fixtures at different age groups alongside those for the boys. Our athletes enjoyed their most successful performance in many years at a rather damp Scottish Prep Schools Finals. The provision of Outdoor Pursuits, for those children wanting an alternative to team sports, continues to grow.\n\nIn summary, I am extremely grateful to the staff, parents, my fellow Governors of Cargilfield School and, most importantly, the pupils whose efforts allowed for such a successful and memorable year. This continues to re-inforce the idea of Cargilfield as one of the premier preparatory schools in the U.K.\n\nCHARITABLE FUNDRAISING\n\nGiven our location in Scotland, we are proud of our involvement in activities that make the most of our wonderful environment and surroundings. The whole school turned out for our annual ‘Pentland Round’: a 20km ridge walk raising money for our school charities. A bothy weekend and monroe bagging trips have also proved popular. Senior children now regularly work towards the national navigation awards.\n\nThe annual Pentland Round and the School Summer fair were enthusiastically supported by pupils and parents alike and both events were blessed with fine weather. The School selected three charities to support this year, with one charity selected by each of the Pre-prep and Upper School children and one selected by Friends of Cargilfield. These charities were The Love Oliver, St Columba’s Hospice and Canine Partners.\n\nIn addition to the fundraising for the School’s three nominated charities, other specific fundraising activities, including our Pre-prep ceilidh, Harvest Festival and Valentine’s disco, during the year allowed the School to support the Poppy Appeal, Comic Relief, St Columba’s Hospice, Pakistan Flood 2022 appeal and Fresh Start.\n\nBURSARY AWARDS\n\nThere is a continued emphasis from the School and the Board of Governors to use bursaries to enable access to pupils from a wide range of backgrounds and to maintain the social mix and diversity of the School. Bursary support is available from Form 4 and includes 100% awards. This has enabled some children to attend the School who would not otherwise have been able to do so and is accompanied by appropriate guidance when such pupils are looking at senior school places. Recent years have seen the beneficiaries of the bursary scheme move on to fully assisted places at major public schools in both Scotland and England.\n\nGirl 1 Was a successful leader at Cargilfield and won a music scholarship to a major Scottish boarding school.\n\nBoy 1 Won an academic scholarship to a major Scottish boarding school.\n\nGirl 2 Won a scholarship to a major English boarding school.\n\nBoy 2 Was a prolific sportsman and won a scholarship to a major English boarding school.\n\nGirl 3 Won a music award and was given a subsequent bursary to a major Scottish boarding school.\n\nBoy 3 Was appointed a prefect and won a sports scholarship to a major Scottish boarding school.\n\nFUTURE PLANS\n\nOur future plans reflect our ongoing commitment to an all–round education for our children within a flexible boarding and day environment. This will be delivered by a professional, well-trained and highly motivated staff. We were pleased to see this confirmed in the recent inspection reports but we recognise that Cargilfield must continue to develop its practice if it is to remain one of the best preparatory schools in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the light of existing extra costs imposed upon Scottish independent schools (and those in the offing), it is more important than ever that strong governance and effective management focus on delivering the best education in a cost-effective manner.\n\nThis will include making sure that a Cargilfield education meets the needs of our families. We intend to repeat the parental survey conducted last year as well as regular staff welfare surveys. These will help us to make sure Cargilfield remains the school of choice for children and staff. This information will help to inform the strategy set by governors.\n\nIn addition, we plan to develop further the quality of pastoral care, publishing new anti-bullying and behaviour policies. These will work to include the children as mentors and make better use of their voice as gathered through the likes of School and Boarders’ Councils, and the Food and Library Committees. We plan to support staff further with responsive training and the chance to reflect with the Anchor Practice on the pastoral support that they offer the children.\n\nCargilfield celebrates academic success through small classes and effective teaching towards ambitious outcomes. While this rigour includes the best of a traditional curriculum, technology plays an increasing part in school life. In helping our children to make the best use of recent developments in artificial intelligence and apply creativity and teamwork in problem-solving, we will surely prepare them for the world that they will face as adults.\n\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n\nCargilfield is proud of its position in the community.\n\nThe Cargilfield buildings and grounds are available to hire for a wide range of activities and events and has over the years has fostered many ties with its local community. The Pipe Band has played regularly in the local area; various musical groups have established a performance routine at a local nursing home, and Cargilfield continues to maintain its very close links with Cramond Kirk and Holy Cross, Davidsons Mains. The Sports Hall has been used regularly by Royal High Corstorphine Cricket Club and various other groups in the Edinburgh area for badminton, cricket, fencing, netball, football and hockey. Cramond Primary School uses the facilities at the School, including holding its annual sports day at Cargilfield.\n\nThe Cargilfield Activity Week during the summer is open not only to Cargilfield children, but also to others in the Edinburgh area. Similar holiday coaching camps for football, fencing, outdoor adventures, tennis, netball and hockey are also hosted. A weekly theatre group also meet on Saturday afternoons at Cargilfield. The annual Christmas Fair returned on site in 2022.\n\nWe look very favourably on all applications from outside Cargilfield to use Cargilfield grounds and facilities. Some of the groups which use Cargilfield do so free of charge. In other cases, there is a very low hourly-rate.\n\nBreadth of Experience\n\nThe School will continue to seek partnership opportunities that allow its facilities to be used during the School holidays and at weekends. This can bring in valuable additional revenue for the School but more importantly helps to foster better links with local schools, sports clubs and community groups and provides a range of sporting, drama and other activities for Cargilfield pupils and others to enjoy.\n\nWelfare\n\nThe pastoral care of our children is essential to Cargilfield’s values and its success. This exists within the framework of a family-run environment which is both a school and a second home to many children. We have continued a programme of training staff in managing the welfare and mental health issues facing children today. This process is underpinned by staff who are trained specifically in mental health first aid, our School Nurse and external professionals, who is available to support both children and their families.\n\nA significant feature underpinning the care this year has been the development of a regular relationship with the Anchor Practice in Edinburgh to make sure that we are offering the very best mental health support for our children as well as the best training and advice for staff and parents. Paul Bell, the practice’s clinical director has visited us once a week and given advice and training to staff as well as meeting individual children and helping us to review our policies.\n\nWe have developed the internal safeguarding team to make for more effective weekly meetings and review of pastoral concerns. This has included more detailed review of attendance data and producing an updated safeguarding policy. Personal, Social and Health Education has been re-branded as Health and Well-Being and has included more team teaching to involve form teachers alongside expert teaching.\n\nCommunication and Recruitment\n\nThe last twelve months have also seen some significant changes in the management and governance of the School. Lord Sinclair, a former pupil and parent of the School stepped up to chair the Board just before the start of the year and this marked his first full year in charge. The announcement of John Collins’ retirement as Bursar at the end of the year launched a recruitment process and we were delighted to recruit Kirsty Lukas from April 2023, allowing for a period of time for handover and completing outstanding projects. At the same time, the School opted to re-organise its senior management team to be ready for future challenges.\n\n2022-23 also saw the appointment of new houseparents to manage the boarding at Cargilfield. The dynamic approach of Lindsay and Lizzie Kerr has helped us to grow numbers of flexi and weekly boarders and to strengthen the boarding team. They have been developing plans for upgrading the boarding hub, replacing the former surgery.\n\nOn the appointment of Jan Harber to a management position in the junior school at Dollar Academy, we were delighted Tiffany Murdoch as our new Head of Nursery from Easter.\n\nDevelopments in Teaching and Learning have included the development of reading at Cargilfield. The appointment of Mrs Bruce as a school librarian has helped children in selecting reading material as well as making better use of the main library facility. Lunchtime reading sessions for children from the Nursery through to Form 8 have been especially enjoyed. The development of Star Reading tests have supported children in targeting the best books for individual readers and Accelerated Reader has provided enjoyable competition in reviewing their reading and scoring points in a divisional competition.\n\nIn challenging times for independent schools across the United Kingdom, Cargilfield is working hard to consolidate its position within the Edinburgh, Scottish and British markets. Pupil recruitment remains strong and record numbers in the Nursery are supported by full classes in Primary 1. We are meeting as many prospective families as we can remember from pre-COVID times. Indeed, we expect to be operating waiting lists at the bottom of the School next year. The appointment of Tina Liversidge as a new Head of Marketing will help us in that process of recruitment.\n\nFacilities and Environment\n\nWithin this future, we will need to be mindful of our environment and we are starting to assess our journey towards carbon neutrality.\n\nSee the school accounts at the bottom of this page."
