        "text": "The Governors of Truro School are delighted to announce the appointment of Andrew Johnson as Head of Truro School from September 2020.\n\nAndrew, known as Andy, joins Truro School from St Dunstan’s College, an inclusive and forward-thinking co-educational 3-18 school in south east London that has just been shortlisted for the national Co-Educational Independent School of the Year Award for 2020.\n\nHe has been Deputy Head (Academic) there since 2015. Prior to that he was the founding Deputy Head of the London Academy of Excellence, an ambitious and successful Sixth Form Free School in Newham, east London. He joined LAE from Westminster School, where he had worked for eleven years, including as a Housemaster. His teaching career began in Hertfordshire, in Berkhamsted. His knowledge and experience of co-educational through schooling, sixth form excellence in independent and state sectors, and pastoral and academic leadership in boarding and day school contexts, will be of value and benefit to the children, staff, families and friends of Truro School. He is committed to Truro’s inclusive Christian ethos, and to building on its great strengths and heritage over the next phase of its exciting, happy, and successful history.\n\nAndy and his family have strong links to Cornwall and relish the opportunity to move here to live, work, and contribute. Childhood holidays here were routine and since being married, Andy, Pamela, and their two young children, Audrey and Alec, have been annual visitors to Cornwall, and usually St Mawes. They are thrilled to be starting a new chapter in their lives in Truro, with access to all the beauty and culture of the city and the county that surrounds it.\n\nAndy was born in Pontypool and grew up in London. He was educated at Westminster School, and took a degree in History at Downing College, Cambridge University, before completing his PGCE in Leeds. History (and the teaching of it) remain a passion, alongside art, music, sport, charitable engagement, travel, and the outdoors. He has run the London marathon twice, which has proved just about enough physical training to cope with the energy and demands of Audrey and Alec. Of becoming the next Head of Truro School, Andy says:\n\n“It is a delight and a privilege to have the opportunity to join and lead this successful and happy community and to build on Andrew’s fantastic legacy. The warmth already shown to me and my family has been inspiring, and the potential of our School and the individuals within it is tremendously exciting. The more I learn about the children, staff and wider community, the more I look forward to serving them as Head.”\n\nKim Conchie, Truro School’s Chair of Governors commented:\n\n“On behalf of the governing body I am really pleased that Andy has agreed to join the school as the new Head. The school has consistently had strong, focussed leaders and Andy will certainly fit those criteria. Throughout the interview process Andy has come across as one ready to take on the mantle of Truro School Head, and his experience through Westminster School, the establishment of the London Academy of Excellence for sixth formers and currently at St Dunstan’s School gives him the ideal platform to lead Truro School.”\n\n“I welcome Andy and his family to Cornwall for the new school year in September 2020 and am sure that he will impress all our stakeholders in the same way that he has impressed us.”\n\nFor press and media enquiries please contact;"
