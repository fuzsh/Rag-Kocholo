        "text": "After studying an MA in Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge and an MSc. at Imperial College, I worked for a charity aiming to support MPs and Peers in their engagement in scientific issues. Whilst working in parliament, I found my passion was explaining scientific ideas and I moved on to study a PGCE in Secondary Science at the Institute of Education.\n\nAfter a spell teaching Physics and Chemistry at Highgate School I moved to Westminster School as a Physics teacher. Over time I moved into senior management, ending up as Director of Teaching and Learning and then Deputy Head (Academic), overseeing the whole academic programme of one of the most successful schools in the United Kingdom. There I gained an insight in supporting students into the most competitive universities in the UK and overseas, as well as the potential of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2021 I left school leadership to focus on my twin passions of supporting schools to continuously improve and achieve the best outcomes for their students, and supporting the most able and ambitious physics students to successfully take the next step in their education. I am a reporting inspector for the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) and support schools as a consultant with all aspects of their provision. I also run INSET sessions for teachers in schools and online, focusing on improving pedagogy to focus on impact for all pupils.\n\nI am passionate about the impact high quality governance can have on education. I work as a governance consultant for the National Governance Association, helping schools and trusts review and improve their governance practice. I am chair of governors at Christâ€™s School, Richmond and a trustee and chair of standards committee at the Ascend Learning Trust.\n\nI enjoy philosophy and outdoor education. I have partially completed a degree in Philosophy at Birkbeck and continue to read widely in epistemology, metaphysics and the theory of time. I work in the summer as a DofE leader and assessor, using my Mountain Leader qualification to support young people in the mountains.\n\nI live off-grid on the Kennet & Avon canal."
