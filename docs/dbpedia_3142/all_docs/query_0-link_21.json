        "text": "The Sixth Form is academically selective and looks for pupils who will benefit from the opportunity to spend two years with others of a similar ability and potential to learn, so all pupils must meet the academic threshold based on examinations and interview. However, HWSF’s Executive Principal is “determined that all young people should have the scholastic opportunities that are enjoyed by the most privileged”, therefore preference is given to pupils who have been in receipt of Free School Meals during their secondary schooling.\n\nThe HWSF curriculum is based on Westminster’s and places emphasis on the value of learning far beyond that of examinations. Almost ten years on, the two schools continue to enjoy a close and mutually beneficial collaboration. Each year an average of 15 pupils from HWSF, along with pupils from the local Greycoat Hospital School, come to us to take A Level courses that are not available at their schools; these include Latin, Greek, Art History, German, Russian, Music and Theatre Studies. Teachers from Westminster also teach classes at HWSF. In addition, pupils are also invited to attend specialised talks with expert speakers, to help supplement their studies.\n\nHWSF is located only a short walk away from Westminster School on Tothill St, which enables staff and pupils from both schools to interact with each other on a frequent basis. Westminster Governor Mr John Colenutt is the Chair of HWSF’s Governing Body, and Head Master Dr Gary Savage and Governor Professor Maggie Dallman are also members."
