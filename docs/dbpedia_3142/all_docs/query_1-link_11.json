        "text": "Westminster College, Cambridge, is overseen by its Board of Governors. Owing to its identity as a Resource Centre for Learning, most of the Board’s members are appointed by the General Assembly of the United Reformed Church. Some are appointed to represent particular bodies, such the Cheshunt Foundation, the Cambridge Theological Federation, or the Universities with which we are connected. The College’s teaching staff and students are represented on the Board as well. Since 2014, the Convener of the Board of Governors is Revd Nigel Uden, minister of Downing Place and Fulbourn United Reformed Churches in Cambridge. Previously, he served as Moderator of the United Reformed Church’s Southern Synod and then its General Assembly."
