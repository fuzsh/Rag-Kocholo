        "text": "Governance\n\nWe are part of and were instrumental in forming the Saint John Southworth Catholic Academy Trust (SJSCAT), a multi-academy trust in the Diocese of Westminster.\n\nA Board of Directors governs the Trust and is legally responsible for our school and other schools in the Trust. The Board is the key decision-making body and has three core governance functions: ensuring clarity of Catholic vision, ethos and strategic direction; holding executive leaders to account for educational performance and ensuring money is well spent.\n\nThe Board has appointed a Local Governing Body to conduct core governance functions in our school. Local governors, appointed or elected from different parts of our school community, serve on our local governing body. The Chair of the Local Governing Body is Kate Griffin. To get in touch with the Chair, email lgbchair@cvms.co.uk or write to Kate Griffin at Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, 89 Addison Road, London W14 8BZ.\n\nThe local governing body meets twice a term to conduct business. Some aspects of its work are carried out by sub-committees or by link governors who visit our schools to focus on particular areas.\n\nRemit and Exercise of Functions\n\nThe powers, constitution and proceedings for the local governing body are set out formally in a Scheme of Delegation and Delegation Matrix. The terms of reference for local governing body sub-committees and link governor roles show which responsibilities have been delegated by the local governing body and the names of those appointed to key positions.\n\nGovernance Documents\n\nThe Governance documents for the Saint John Southworth Catholic Academy Trust can be accessed from its website.\n\nThe terms upon which the school is funded are set out in a funding agreement with the Secretary of State for Education.\n\nRegister of Interests and Meeting Attendance\n\nRegister of Interests for the local governing body\n\nRecord of Meeting Attendance for local governors\n\nFinancial Reports\n\nThe Trust maintains accounting records and prepares an annual report and accounts in line with the Charity Commission's Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) and Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) Accounts Direction. Our reports and accounts will be published on the trustâ€™s website by 31 January each year. Reports for previous years are shown in The Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School Academy Trust tab.\n\nMeetings of the Local Governing Body\n\nOnce agreed, minutes of of local governing body meetings will appear here.\n\nCVMS LGB Minutes 17 1 24 Final\n\nCVMS LGB Minutes 17 11 23 Final\n\nCVMS LGB Minutes 20 9 23 Final\n\n230614 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n230426 CVMS LGB Signed Minutes\n\n230301 CVMS LGB Signed Minutes\n\n230118 CVMS LGB Minutes\n\n221116 CVMS LGB Signed Minutes\n\n220928 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n220615 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n220427 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n220303 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n220119 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n211118 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\n210922 CVMS LGB Agreed Minutes\n\nServing as a Local Governor\n\nSchool governors are volunteers who make a significant contribution to education. It is a challenging and rewarding role which offers the opportunity to make a real difference to young people, to give something back and to use and develop skills in a new environment.\n\nOur local governors are appointed or elected from different parts of our school community.\n\nThe next election for a parent local governor will be held in April 2024. The next election for a staff local governor will be held in January 2028. The clerk will write to parents and staff with information about the process.\n\nFoundation local governors are appointed by the Bishop. If you would like to serve as a foundation local governor, contact clerk@cvms.co.uk or to find out more use this link Diocese of Westminster.\n\nCardinal Vaughan Memorial School Academy Trust\n\nWe joined the Saint John Southworth Catholic Academy Trust on 1st September 2021. Before then, the school was a single academy trust.
