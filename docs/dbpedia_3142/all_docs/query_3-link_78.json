        "text": "Chair of Governors, Iain Barbour has issued a statement to confirm that Dr Gary Savage will leave Alleyn's in August 2020 to take up the position of Head Master at Westminster School.\n\nMr Barbour said: \"Gary has preserved and promoted the School's unique ethos that offers your children a holistic education encompassing not only the opportunity to achieve academic excellence; but also to experience a rich and varied co-curriculum within a culture of strong pastoral care.\"\n\nRead the full statement here.\n\nDr Savage said: \"My wife, Natalie, and I have both been incredibly happy at Alleyn’s, and in Dulwich, and it is a real wrench to move on after what will be ten wonderful and rewarding years. Alleyn’s is a really amazing school, with lovely, positive and engaged students who are supported, cherished and inspired by a passionately committed and talented teaching and support staff.\"\n\n\"I shall miss them all, very much, as I move on with pride and joy, but inevitably some poignancy, to Westminster. I do so safe in the knowledge that the brilliant team at Alleyn’s – and its deep-rooted culture and ethos – will ensure a continuity of care as the new Head is found and appointed. I have no doubt that Alleyn’s will attract a superb field of talented people to the role: as we all know, it’s a great school to join and a tough place to leave!\""
