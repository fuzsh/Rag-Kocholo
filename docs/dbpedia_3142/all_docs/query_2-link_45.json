        "text": "John Betts Governing Body\n\nChair’s Introduction\n\nThe governors work with the Head and staff to pursue the school’s core values which have persisted since its foundation by Dr John Betts: happy children, equality of opportunity, educational excellence, and service to others.\n\nWe focus on three strategic functions and are responsible for the school’s vision and ethos and its strategic direction; for overseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent; and for holding the Headteacher to account for the school’s educational performance. This is done through four committees:\n\nAdmissions\n\nCurriculum and Children\n\nPay and Performance\n\nResources\n\nThe minutes of governing body meetings, once ratified, are available upon request.\n\nIn addition, as a non-denominational voluntary-aided school, we ensure that the school’s founding ethos is maintained; we employ the staff and we are responsible, working together with the Trust, for maintaining and utilising the school’s buildings.\n\nWe want every child here to be happy and successful and enjoy school. We are always pleased to hear comments and suggestions from parents, and you can contact the governing body via the school office.\n\nSophy Doyle\n\nChair of Governors\n\nchair@johnbetts.lbhf.sch.uk\n\nGovernor Portraits\n\nGovernors at John Betts come from various backgrounds.
