        "text": "Governors\n\nAbbotsbury Primary School Governors\n\nThe governors’ work affects most aspects of the school’s work.\n\nThey establish, with the Headteacher, aims for the school and approve policies – for the curriculum, behaviour and discipline, for example; and are responsible for the school’s budget and the use and maintenance of the premises. More generally, they are expected to be in touch with the local community and to help guide the school to meet the community’s educational needs. They are also expected to help the school explain to the community what the school is trying to achieve for their children.\n\nThe governors, together as a body, have a range of legal responsibilities, so being a governor is an important commitment and new governors should be willing to attend training to help them learn what is entailed. If you feel you would like to be a governor at Abbotsbury Primary School please drop into the school office in the first instance and we will put you in touch with our Chair of Governors to enable you to discuss in more detail what is involved in being a governor.\n\nAbbotsbury Primary School - Governors Information and Register of Interests\n\nName Governor Type Committee(s) Festus Adeyemo Parents of Abbotsbury Primary School Finance Jan Angel Staff of Abbotsbury Primary School Curriculum Henry Basing The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Finance, Pay & HT Performance Management David Beach The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Business, Personnel Katrina Hulley The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Curriculum & Premises Rowena Maybury Head Teacher Finance, Personnel & Curriculum Sarah Pfutzner The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Personnel, Finance Khaula Gilani The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Ted Lougher The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Esther Taiwo The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Nasira Begum The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Curriculum Joti Bhalla The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Vice Chair, GDPR Governor Samantha Clarke The Governing Body of Abbotsbury Primary School Finance, Curriculum\n\nClick here for Abbotsbury Governor Information & Committees\n\nGovernor Bios\n\nFestus Adeyemo\n\nFestus Adeyemo is director of Seekers International Ministries, where he encourages pastors, local churches, families and communities through mentoring and preaching.
