        "text": "What is a Foundation Governor?\n\nFoundation Governors are appointed in the name of the Archbishop and form the majority of the governing body of a Catholic school. They have a legal duty to preserve and develop the Catholic character of the school and to ensure that the school is conducted in accordance with its trust deed.\n\nGoverning boards have three core functions:\n\nEnsuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction;\n\nHolding executive leaders to account for the educational performance of the organisation and its pupils, and the performance management of staff; and\n\nOverseeing the financial performance of the organisation and making sure its money is well spent.\n\nThe ministry of Foundation Governor is an important one, because the Catholic character of our schools depends on committed Catholics being willing to undertake this service. The Archbishop is therefore very appreciative of all those who offer to assist him in this vital task.\n\nResponsibilities and Time Commitments\n\nThe average Foundation Governor role will take up about 10-12 hours per month. However, this can vary depending on the school calendar or by events, such as an Ofsted inspection.\n\nThis commitment includes the minimum requirement of attending three full governor meetings per year and serving on at least one committee.\n\nThe committees will focus on areas such as finance, curriculum, pupil progress and site management.\n\nYou will also be encouraged to attend training sessions.\n\nDo I fit the criteria?\n\nBecause of our baptism, all Christians are all called to serve the Church’s mission. So lack of experience is no bar to appointment, because all that is required is a wish to serve the mission of the Church in this particular way. Induction and training will be provided for Foundation Governors.General CriteriaExpand\n\nGeneral Criteria\n\nTo become or remain a foundation governor, a person must be and remain:\n\na practising Catholic;\n\nproviding education for his or her own children, if of school age, in a Catholic school or college (unless exceptional circumstances apply);\n\nable to give priority of attendance at meetings of the governing body to ensure representation of the Archbishop;\n\nin possession of a valid DBS disclosure certificate.\n\nTo become or remain a foundation governor, a person must not be disqualified from becoming or remaining a governor in accordance with:\n\nthe current School Government Regulations (or the college’s Instrument of Government);\n\nthe Charities Acts; and\n\nthe Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.\n\nSpecific Criteria\n\n4. In respect of the school or college for which a person is or is to be a foundation governor, he or she must not at any time be:\n\nrelated to any member of the school or college staff, teaching or non-teaching;\n\nrelated to any governor whether elected, appointed or ex-officio, of the school or college;\n\nemployed (whether as a teacher or otherwise) at the school.\n\n5. A person (other than the parish priest) will not normally be re-appointed as a foundation governor of a particular school or college if he or she has just completed three consecutive terms on that particular governing body.\n\nTermination of Office\n\nIf criterion 2 ceases to apply during the term of office of a governor, the term of office comes to an end automatically by operation of law. Should criteria 1 or 4 cease to apply to a foundation governor during his or her tenure of office, the governor would be expected to offer his or her resignation to the Ordinary."
