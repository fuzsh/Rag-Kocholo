        "text": "Summary of what governors do\n\nTheir role is to:\n\nset the school’s strategic direction\n\nhold the head teacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils\n\nensure that the school’s budget is properly managed and money is well spent.\n\nSchool governors usually serve a four-year term of office, but can resign at any time. If you become a school governor, you will be expected to:\n\nattend around three meetings of the governing boards every year, plus meetings for any committees you’re on\n\nvisit the school once a term\n\ncommit to complete ongoing training to continuously update your knowledge.\n\nWhy we need diverse and inclusive governing boards\n\nGovernors and trustees make decisions that impact significantly on the lives of the pupils and staff. It is important that governing boards reflect their communities so that their decisions take into account the needs and lived experiences of those communities.\n\nA diverse governing board offers positive role models to pupils and staff, and ensures local communities have confidence in the school.\n\nGoverning boards also need to operate in an inclusive way that challenges inequality, whatever the diversity on the board.\n\nIn 2021, Islington Council carried out a Governors’ Diversity Survey and Action Plan to establish baseline indicators of the diversity on governing boards in Islington.\n\nThe findings indicated that Black communities and people with disabilities appeared in particular to be under-represented on governing boards.\n\nOther under-represented groups were males and younger people.\n\nThe council carried out a governor recruitment push in spring 2022. People from Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities in particular were invited to get involved. We held on-line Governance Information Sessions and a Prospective Governors Event at which potential governors heard from schools with vacancies. In partnership with Governors for Schools, we have matched a number of people to their preferred schools.\n\nGlobal Majority Governors Network (GMGN)\n\nThe summer term meeting of the network due to take place on Thursday 6 June 2024, 6 to 8pm, at St Luke’s Community Centre, unfortunately had to be cancelled. We are liaising with members of the network about the programme and dates for academic year. The provisional date for the next meeting, to be held, at Camden’s Education Offices, 5 Pancras Square, N1C 5LG, is Wednesday 23 October, 6-8pm. More details to follow.\n\nThe Islington and Camden GMGN has been meeting termly since October 2022. It aims to give a safe space for governors from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities to discuss the issues they want to raise in relation to their role as governors and in the light of their lived experiences. The meetings, usually 6 to 8pm and face-to-face, alternate between Camden and Islington sites and there are light refreshments. Governors and trustees in the network take turns to co-chair the meetings which are facilitated by Islington and Camden Governor Services.\n\nAt the first meeting in October 2022 at Camden Education Offices, Pancras Square, there was great energy in the room as the governors in the network came together to share their experiences, successes and challenges.\n\nSince then, themes of the meetings have included outcomes for children from the Global Majority, the Arts, decolonising the curriculum and how schools support parents and carers of children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.\n\nFor more information, please contact Governor Services.\n\nMore on what governors do\n\nGovernors are occasionally asked to sit on small panels to consider Complaints, Exclusions and Human Resources (HR).\n\nGovernors work with the head teacher and senior leadership team to improve standards of achievements and ensure public money is being spent properly and openly, while having a duty of care for the pupils and the staff.\n\nTheir role is strategic, providing insight and accountability, support and challenge.\n\nGovernors do not get involved in the day-to-day/operational management of the school and they are there in the interests of all pupils at the school.\n\nLegally, governing boards are corporate boards, so responsibility and the power to take action and make decisions lies with the board as a whole, not its individual members. Governors work as a team and make collective decisions.\n\nThere are training sessions and briefings to support governors in Islington with their development.\n\nSince the pandemic, some committee meetings are still being held remotely or face to face but allowing some access remotely (hybrid), while most full governing board meetings have returned to face to face.\n\nWhat you need to be a governor\n\nCommitment and a passion for education\n\nThe necessary skills and/or experience to be able to support and challenge the headteacher and contribute to discussions and decision-making\n\nA willingness to learn\n\nGood interpersonal skills\n\nTime\n\nAn appropriate level of literacy and sufficient numeracy to understand basic data\n\nKnowledge of the locality and communities in which the school operates can be very helpful.\n\nBenefits of being a governor\n\nPeople benefit in a range of ways, such as feeling they are ‘giving back’, sharing and developing their skills and knowledge, meeting people and working with a team, learning more about the education system and progressing their careers.\n\nGovernors responding to the Islington Governors Diversity Survey 2021 told us what they had got out of being a governor:\n\n\"Feeling like I'm making a difference.\"\n\n\"Helping to support the school make difficult decisions in these increasingly pressurised times.\"\n\n\"Better understanding of school system. Being able to contribute to my children’s school.\"\n\n\"Encouraging the school to take a deeper look at equality and diversity.\"\n\n\"Feeling part of the exciting, innovative journey that the school is taking. I chair the Children, Families and Community committee, so I have enjoyed the opportunities for consultation with children and families and hearing their voices represented.\"\n\n\"Witnessing the light bulb moments experienced by children.\"\n\nThere is also feedback from governors across the country that has been gathered by the two national organisations that match potential governors to governor vacancies:\n\nNational governor stories (from Governors for Schools)\n\nVolunteer blogs (from Inspiring Governance)\n\nTypes of governor, associate member and trustee\n\nThere are five types of school governor at schools maintained by the council – community schools, foundation schools and voluntary-aided (church) schools:\n\nParent governors: elected by other parents.\n\nCo-opted governors: appointed by the governing board and often have specific skills\n\nStaff governors: work in the school and are elected by staff at the school.\n\nFoundation governors: appointed by the organisation that supports the school such as the local diocese but can be a charitable trust.\n\nLocal Authority governors: appointed by the governing boards following a nomination from the local council.\n\nHeadteachers are also governors because of their job (ex-officio), unless they choose not to be a governor.\n\nIn addition, governing boards may appoint associate members, usually to join a committee due to their specialist knowledge. They are not school governors, but they can attend although not vote at full governing board meetings. Being an associate member can be a good way for someone to assess if they might want to commit to being a full governor.\n\nAcademy schools do things differently. You’ll find details in their Articles of Association, which you can get from the school.\n\nHow to become a governor or trustee\n\nWe recommend attending one of the governance information sessions and the prospective governor event set out above.\n\nOtherwise you can contact:\n\nyour local school/s to see if they have any vacancies.\n\nthe national organisations that match potential governors, trustees and associate members to schools that have registered their vacancies with them.\n\nThese are:\n\nInspiring Governance\n\nGovernors for Schools\n\nIf you are a parent or staff member, keep an eye out for upcoming elections.\n\nIf you are interested in being a Foundation governor in a local church school, you could also contact the local Diocesan authorities.\n\nCatholic schools – Diocese of Westminster\n\nChurch of England – London Diocesan Board of Schools\n\nPlease note, on appointment as a governor or trustee, the school will need to carry out checks to ensure you are suitable to be a governor, including a DBS check and a self-declaration form that you complete to confirm you are not disqualified.\n\nSupport for governors and potential governors\n\nSome schools arrange for potential governors to shadow existing governors and have a buddy or mentoring scheme for new governors and an induction pack which includes information about the school. The clerk to governors may also provide you with invaluable information and support.\n\nThe council provides some advice and training to all governing boards free of charge. More services are available for schools to buy into.\n\nThe Diocesan authorities provide advice and training.\n\nCatholic schools: Diocese of Westminster\n\nChurch of England: London Diocesan Board of Schools\n\nNational organisations, including National Governance Association, National Black Governors’ Network (NBGN), Modern Governor, The Key for School Governors, that provide support and training, either free or on a subscription basis. Your school may already be buying their services so that you would not need to pay yourself.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email jane.wright@islington.gov.uk.\n\nRegister on MyLearning"
