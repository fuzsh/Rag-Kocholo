        "text": "The School is owned by Westminster Abbey, which is absolutely committed to maintaining a specialist choir school and subsidising its running costs very considerably. The management, control and direction of the School is the responsibility of a Governing Body which includes several members, independent of the Abbey, who bring specialist experience and advice.\n\nGovernors meet in full once a term. The two sub-committees (Education & Policy and Finance & General Purposes) also meet at least termly and report to the Board.\n\nJust as important as the formal meetings are opportunities for governors to visit the school regularly to see, at first hand, all that goes on. Governors have very genuine responsibilities to oversee the well-being of the school and its professional operation, including its compliance with all relevant legislation and educational best practice; they take great pride in this responsibility.\n\nThe Governing Body\n\nThe Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle KCVO MBE (Chairman)\n\nDean of Westminster\n\nThe Reverend David Stanton\n\nSub-Dean and Canon Treasurer\n\nThe Right Reverend Anthony Ball\n\nCanon Rector\n\nThe Reverend Dr James Hawkey\n\nCanon Theologian and Almoner\n\nMr Paul Baumann CBE\n\nChapter Clerk and Receiver General\n\nMr Robert Gullifer\n\nIndependent Governor\n\nDame Jane Glover\n\nIndependent Governor\n\nMrs Lucy Shaw\n\nIndependent Governor (former parent)\n\nMrs Angela Henderson\n\nIndependent Governor (former parent)\n\nMrs Josephine Ziwa\n\nParent Governor\n\nIn attendance:\n\nThe Headteacher - Dr Emma Margrett\n\nThe Organist and Master of the Choristers - Mr Andrew Nethsingha\n\nMinor Canon and Precentor - The Reverend Mark Birch\n\nClerk:\n\nSchool Business Manager - Ms Vanessa Adair"
