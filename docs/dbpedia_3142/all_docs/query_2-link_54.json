        "text": "The Function and the Structure of the Governing Body\n\nGovernors are the strategic leaders of the school and have a vital role to play in making sure every child gets the best possible education. In short, their purpose is to conduct the school with a view to promoting high standards of educational achievement.\n\nIn Catholic education governors have a special role which is to ensure that Pope Paul is first, and foremost, conducted as a Catholic School, in accordance with the Trust Deed of the Diocese of Westminster. A Catholic school is not one which merely follows the secular National Curriculum with Catholic religious education and liturgical worship bolted on, but rather an institution where Gospel values and the Catholic faith are at the heart of everything and permeate every facet of its work.\n\nBeyond this, the role of the Governing Body is to:\n\nset the strategic direction, vision and ethos of the school;\n\nmonitor and challenge the progress of the school in achieving its priorities;\n\nrecruit and performance manage the headteacher;\n\nexercise employer responsibility;\n\nensure the school meets its statutory responsibilities;\n\nensure financial probity;\n\nensure the premises are well managed;\n\nreport to the school’s stakeholders; and\n\nset the long term future of the school\n\nThe Headteacher is responsible for the educational performance of the school and the internal organisation, management and control of the school.\n\nGovernors work with and in support of the headteacher but are also required to hold the headteacher to account. They are not, however, responsible for the day to day management and leadership of the school, which is firmly the responsibility of the headteacher.\n\nThe composition of our Governing Body is as follows:\n\nHeadteacher Governor\n\nSeven Foundation Governors (appointed by the Archbishop of Westminster)\n\nOne Local Authority (LA) Governor (appointed by the LA – Hertfordshire)\n\nOne Staff Governor (elected by the staff)\n\nTwo Parent Governors (elected by the parents of children attending the school)\n\nOne Co-Opted (Associate) Governor (appointed by the Governing Body)\n\nGovernors generally hold their office for a period of four years at a time. During this time they have the opportunity to attend training courses and workshops on a comprehensive range of topics provided by the Local Authority and the Archdiocese, and receive updates on salient issues from a variety of sources.\n\nMeetings of the full Governing Body are usually held twice a term throughout the school year. Topics covered in meetings may include planning the school’s long-term vision through the School Improvement Plan, target setting and monitoring, and the school budget. Much of the work, however, is devolved to a series of committees to ensure the workload is dealt with effectively. At Pope Paul there are four major committees.\n\nSchool Improvement Committee\n\nSchool Resources Committee\n\nAdmissions Panel\n\nPay Committee\n\nGovernors make collective decisions and the Governing Body is answerable to parents and the community."
