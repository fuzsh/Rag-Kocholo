        "text": "Supporting pupils with dyslexia in secondary schools through expertise sharing across perspectives and settings.\n\nThe family of an alumni student with dyslexia from Westminster school provided funding for development work on dyslexia. The Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) from Westminster School approached the UCL Centre for Inclusive Education to discuss a collaborative project.\n\nSix mainstream secondary schools and six Independent secondary schools joined together for a knowledge exchange event attended by a classroom practitioner and the SENCO from each school.\n\nSession 1 (one day)\n\nWhat is dyslexia? Theory and research evidence informing practice. Identifying able pupils with dyslexia. One pupil’s experience of being dyslexic. Case study discussion groups. Action planning – each school identifying 2 or 3 manageable goals.\n\nSession 2 (evening)\n\nMixed group discussions looking at progress so far as well as barriers and possible solutions. Consideration of steps needed to move forward and how impact might be measured.\n\nSession 3 (evening)\n\nMixed group discussions: What has been achieved? What still needs to be done? Next steps?\n\nChallenge\n\nThe main challenge was to support pupils with dyslexia in secondary schools through sharing expertise across a wide range of perspectives and settings.\n\nThe focus was on young people with high levels of competencies struggling with dyslexia. The independent schools were generally more able to focus on this specific group whereas the state schools were faced with the context and challenges of a much more diverse population.\n\nIt was difficult for all participants to find sufficient time back at school to complete the tasks they had set themselves. Initiating systems to determine the impact of changes was also a challenge.\n\nSolution\n\nBelow is a summary of some of the solutions developed as a result of the programme:\n\nTried out strategies recommended by colleagues to improve dyslexia friendly teaching e.g. ‘scaffolding’ using images, visualisation and metacognition, and encouraging students to reflect on their learning and barriers.\n\nCommunication improved between SEN department and the classroom – each Department now has a representative for SEN as an ambassador for teachers.\n\nEnsured IEPs/Pupil Profiles are easily available to all teachers.\n\nMade available information about types of learning differences and suggested strategies to staff.\n\nDepartmental audits to ascertain needs of children with dyslexia.\n\nLunchtime INSET for staff to increase understanding and develop better communication with departmental reps. Staff then took this information back to their colleagues.\n\nDevelopmental work to ensure that the pupil and parent voices were always heard.\n\nDyslexia focus as a recurring item on the departmental team agendas.\n\nUsed ‘Departmental Prefects’ (student advocates) to improve attitudes and culture of a dyslexia friendly school.\n\nSimplified referral forms.\n\nBetter understanding of teacher responsibilities.\n\nTeaching observations used as a means to monitor the effectiveness of SEN policy.\n\nObserving classes through pupil experiences.\n\nSenior teacher ‘walk about’ with different themes – identifying good practice and practice that can be improved.\n\nConstant re-evaluation of approaches and collection of evidence.\n\nKey information included on notice boards in staff room and weekly bulletins on SEN.\n\nImpact and results\n\nQuestionnaire results reported improved confidence of teachers dealing with dyslexia-related issues. There was positive feedback from staff and governors who attended the INSET sessions.\n\nOverall, staff were very keen and engaged in all aspects of the programme, asked questions, completed all of the tasks at each station and reflected on their classes and students.\n\nFollowing the Westminster sessions, most participants said that they had gained a better understanding of dyslexia. Classroom observations and demonstrated strategies were being used by teachers and increased knowledge of individual pupils was widely reported by participants. Participants felt they had made progress within their own schools and were moving towards developing a more dyslexia friendly environment.\n\nThere will be ongoing consideration for schools into the effectiveness of particular dyslexia-friendly approaches, sharing good practice, incorporating pupil and parent voices and future meetings to share good practice.\n\n(facebook button)"
