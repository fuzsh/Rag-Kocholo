        "text": "Board of Governors\n\nSt Michael's Catholic High School is an Academy and founder member of the Diocese of Westminster Academy Trust, a private company limited by guarantee: registered number 7944160.\n\nThe Trust provides a framework through which Catholic schools in the Diocese can work together in the interests of giving children the chance to aim high and achieve their potential in life, within a safe and inspirational environment. We continue to work in partnership with schools in Hertfordshire with whom we have excellent links.\n\nGovernors Mission Statement\n\nWe will dedicate ourselves to supporting the school to deliver the aims of the Governing Board within a framework of trust, respect and shared values.\n\nWe will support and contribute to the school to secure its mission and sustain its ethos as a Catholic School.\n\nWe will commit ourselves to ensuring that every child is valued and educated within a safe and inspirational environment.\n\nThe Purpose of the Governing Board\n\nThe Board of Governors is the non-executive body of the school responsible for the conduct of the school, driving high standards and for delivering continuous improvement in all aspects of the school’s performance. Our aim is to ensure that students are attending a successful school which provides them with an excellent education and supports their wellbeing.\n\nOver the last decade the responsibilities of Governing Boards have grown which has meant schools are now accountable for student’s health and wellbeing in the community and for a wide range of extended service provision out of school hours.\n\nIn addition we are aware of the Government’s ambition: “that every school has a high performing Board of Governors that understands its responsibilities and focuses on its core strategic functions; one that is made up of people with relevant skills and experience; and one which operates efficiently and effectively through appropriate structures and procedures”.\n\nThe Board of Governors is mindful of the important role we play in driving up school and student performance and we all embrace the responsibility and accountability that attaches to the role of school governor.\n\nGovernors fulfil their responsibilities by focusing on three core strategic functions:\n\nEnsuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction.\n\nHolding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its students and the performance management of staff.\n\nOverseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent.\n\nThe governors are dedicated to supporting and contributing to the school to secure its mission and sustain its ethos as a Catholic school. We will work to enhance the religious character of the school and will contribute to Catholic education across the Diocese.\n\nAt St Michael's we have a committed and very active Board of Governors made up of dedicated people from all walks of life who give their time freely and voluntarily.\n\nGovernors support the school to deliver the aims of the Board of Governors within a framework of trust, respect and shared values. We are an aspirational and cohesive non-executive team, committed to ensuring we have the complementary skills and knowledge base to equip us to discharge the responsibilities of a modern day Board of Governors.\n\nWe are committed to achieving the highest standards in all public examinations and our students and teachers reflect this aspiration by their outstanding achievements.\n\nWe will always be mindful of how well our school is supported by the parents and carers who choose to send their children to St Michael's and of our responsibility to develop effective and meaningful relationships with parents and the community.\n\nThe Board of Governors at St Michael's will always have the wellbeing of the students and the reputation of the school at heart and as governors we will do all we can to be ambassadors for the school, publicly supporting its aims, values and ethos.\n\nIf you wish to contact the Governing Board, please contact Viki Baker, Clerk to the Governors for St Michael's Catholic High School by: Post: The Chair of Governors, c/o St. Michael's Catholic High School, High Elms Lane, Garston, WD25 0SS or by E-mail: baker.v@Stmichaelscatholichighschool.co.uk\n\nChairperson: Mr M Holt\n\nVice-Chairperson: Mrs L Walsh\n\nResponsible Officer: Mr A Tsobgny\n\nFoundation\n\nMs L Bevan\n\nMrs G Erdil\n\nMrs A Hanbury\n\nMr M Holt\n\nSister D O’Brien\n\nMrs T. Oliver\n\nMr A Tsobgny\n\nMrs L Walsh\n\nParent\n\nMrs K Byrne\n\nMrs S Hughes\n\nStaff\n\nMrs C Bilir\n\nMs R Peachey\n\nEx-officio as Headteacher\n\nMr E Conway\n\nSchool Business Manager\n\nMrs J Arthur-Tinworth\n\nClerk to Governors"
