        "text": "The Governing Board\n\nOur Lady and St John's Catholic Primary School is a voluntary aided school and its Governing Board consists of both appointed and elected governors.\n\nFoundation Governors\n\nFoundation governors at the school represent the interests of the Diocese of Westminster who are trustees of the school. The role of the foundation governor is to ensure that the school is clearly recognisable as Christian in its ethos and that its role is seen in the provision for Catholic children of the Diocese.\n\nParent Governors\n\nParents of pupils registered at the school are eligible to stand for election as a parent governor. They are elected by other parents at the school. The school has two elected parent governors.\n\nStaff Governors\n\nThe Headteacher is automatically eligible to be a full member of the Governing Board by virtue of the office. Headteachers have the choice of being a governor. Both teaching and support staff who are paid to work at the school are eligible to stand as staff governors. They are elected by other members of the staff at the school. The school has one staff governor.\n\nLocal Authority Governors\n\nLocal Authority governors are appointed by the Local Authority of Hounslow. There is one Local Authority governor at Our Lady and St John's.\n\nGovernors generally hold their office for a period of four years at a time. During this time they have the opportunity to attend training courses and workshops on a comprehensive range of topics provided by the Local Authority and the Archdiocese, and receive updates on salient issues from a variety of sources.\n\nGovernors provide guidance and support. The role of a governor is that of a 'critical friend', who is there to give direction and focus to the school leadership. The management of the school is the responsibility of the headteacher.\n\nMeetings of the full Governing Board are usually held twice a term throughout the school year. Topics covered in meetings may include planning the school's long term vision through the School Improvement Plan, target setting and monitoring, and the school budget.\n\nThe Governing Board is answerable to parents and the wider community.\n\nCorrespondence for the Governors may be addressed to the Clerk to the Governing Board at the school.\n\nThe members of the Governing Board are as follows:\n\nFoundation Governors\n\nMrs Tiffany Bolton\n\nCo-Chair of Governors\n\nTerm: 1st September 2022 – 31st August 2026\n\nRegister of interests: None declared\n\nMrs Carol Gaughan\n\nVice-Chair of Governors\n\nTerm: 1st September 2022 – 31st August 2026\n\nRegister of interests: None declared\n\nFr.
