        "text": "Clare Countess of Euston The Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk\n\nPatron\n\nAfter appointment as Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant of Suffolk in December 2014 she graciously accepted an offer to become Patron of Framlingham College, continuing a long tradition of Lord-Lieutenants that have been involved with the College.\n\nAfter growing up in the Scottish Borders she achieved an MA in Modern History from London University, and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of East Anglia. Having worked all her life within the voluntary sector, she was Vice-Chairman of Mental Health Foundation, and Chairman of the Foundation for People with Learning Difficulties. She was a Trustee of the Henry Smith Charity for twenty-five years and is a past Chairman of St. Nicholas Hospice Care in Bury St Edmunds, as well as a past Vice-Chairman of the Suffolk Community Foundation.\n\nFrom 2004-2005, she was High Sheriff of Suffolk. From 2005 to 2010 she was independent chair of the Suffolk Strategic Partnership.\n\nMarrying James, Earl of Euston in 1972 they have five children and nine grand- children. She lives at Euston in Suffolk, where she is a partner in the farm business, and takes a particular interest in breeding Red Poll Cattle and Suffolk\n\nPunch Horses.\n\nConservation of the Suffolk countryside for the benefit of future generations, is at the heart of everything on the Euston Estate.\n\nCharles Packshaw\n\nChair of Governors (2020-); Vice Chair of Governors (2017-2020); Governor (2014-)\n\nEducated at Westminster School, Bristol University and London Business School, Charles has lived near Framlingham for over thirty years.\n\nCharles had a career in the City spanning over thirty years, initially with Lazard and then HSBC, where he was Head of UK Advisory. Since retiring in 2017, he has held non-executive and charity roles, including as Senior Independent Director of Diploma PLC, Chair at Prostate Cancer UK, Chair at BMT Group and Audit Chair at Fram Farmers.

Peter was Deputy Chair of the National Youth Orchestra, chairing the Development Board and Finance Committee, and was a trustee of the AstraZeneca Primary Science Teaching Trust.\n\nPeter is now enjoying mentoring and coaching a growing number of undergraduates and graduates around career choices and preparation (including alumni from Framlingham College and his own old school, Nottingham High). As a keen amateur musician, Peter is an active participant in and supporter of music in East Anglia – including singing regularly in concerts at the College!\n\nPhilippa Cartmell\n\nGovernor (2024-)\n\nPhilippa was one of the first girls to be educated at Framlingham and is also a former Prep School and Senior School parent who now lives locally.\n\nAfter reading French and English at University she joined Willis Faber and Dumas as a graduate within their Aerospace Division, travelled extensively and undertook various overseas roles but has remained within what is now called WTW and is currently a Director in their GB division with responsibilities across their UK geographies and industry practices.\n\nHer current role gives her a working knowledge of risk across a number of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 multinational and domestic client bases as well as internal team and balance sheet management. She sits as a mentor and coach for colleagues both within WTW as well as other connected businesses as well as oversight for graduate and apprentice recruitment across the UK company.\n\nShe is a passionate exponent of diversity and inclusion within the broader financial services sector.\n\nShe has employed a network of Old Framlinghamians within her company and advises and promotes OF’s wherever she can.\n\nPhilippa is married with three children and lives just outside Framlingham.\n\nLeanne Chadwick\n\nGOVERNOR (2023-)\n\nLeanne Chadwick (née Newton) was educated at Framlingham College as an Academic Scholar before completing her degree in History at the University of Nottingham.\n\nIn 2010 Leanne was successful in securing a place on the HR graduate scheme at Barclays Bank, where she grew her career as a HR business partner. She moved to Standard Chartered Bank in 2019 where she is now Global Head of Early Careers. This role requires her team to hire, develop and manage the careers of a large number of young people across the world.\n\nLeanne is married to Nicholas, a tech entrepreneur and they live in Essex with their young daughter Bella. She is a keen netballer and has continued her love of sport that grew at the college.\n\nMartin Collier\n\nGovernor (2024-)\n\nMartin is currently the Master of Haileybury having been appointed in 2017. He graduated with an MA in Modern History from Oxford University. He was previously Headmaster of St John’s School Leatherhead and before that was Second Master at Oundle.\n\nMartin currently serves as Chair of the HMC Academic Policy Sub-Committee and has played an important role in effecting positive change in the national examinations system and curriculum. He is an author and editor of numerous history textbooks. Martin is also a Governor at international, state and independent schools.\n\nHe lives near Framlingham and is married with three children.\n\nNigel Helliwell\n\nGovernor (2021-)\n\nIn his governing role, Nigel is Chair of the Safeguarding and Welfare Committee and a member of the Education Committee.\n\nNigel was a Head for 21 years including leading St Faith’s, Cambridge (TES UK Prep School of the Year 2019) from 2011 to 2021.

He is also a Lead Inspector and an ILM Level 7 Coach, coaching and mentoring Heads in state and independent schools.\n\nJoe Lipman\n\nGOVERNOR (2023-)\n\nJoe left the College four years ago. The Framlingham College experience was a truly life changing one for him. He came to the Prep School aged 11, with basically no English, and progressed to become Head Boy in his final year as well as securing a place at Edinburgh University.\n\nSince then, Joe has started his own business, with tremendous support from people that surround the College, and has now taken what may have seemed initially a somewhat crazy idea into a fully functioning app focused on sustainability on the App Store (Name: Watch, Earn, Shop). The business is currently gaining increasing traction amongst UK university students.\n\nSince leaving, Joe has given talks at the College that always result in incredibly open discussion, about his time at the College, his gap year, internships, university, start-ups etc. He has always been passionate about guiding those that are slightly younger than himself in what can be an incredibly confusing time in their lives. Joe says that the most beneficial thing for him when he was at the College was the advice he received from older pupils. For him, a school must offer a pupil the tools to not only learn new skills and pass exams, but to be able to become self-motivated, resilient and confident in who they are, and what they can achieve. Framlingham did this for him and having spoken to current pupils and recent leavers, Joe says the College is very much driving this ethos. He is honoured to have the opportunity to play his part in that drive.\n\nNick Whitehead\n\nGovernor (2023-)\n\nNick grew up in Bury St Edmunds and joined Framlingham College as a pupil in 2006. Following school, he joined a local accountancy firm in Suffolk as an apprentice.\n\nNick moved to London and qualified as a chartered accountant with ZEDRA, a specialist firm focusing on US inward investment. He moved to Denver, in the US, for a year to work with a large regional firm on secondment where met his wife, Audrey.
