        "text": "The Court of Governors is the University’s governing body, and it approves the University’s long-term objectives and strategies as well as provides overall financial and organisational control. The Court comprises twelve independent non-executive governors, three colleague governors, two student governors and two ex-official governors including the Vice-Chancellor and President, and the senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor. Governors are also directors of the University in its status as a company and trustees of the University in its status as a charity.\n\nOne of the newly appointed governors is Henryetta Simpson, Senior Lecturer in the Business Information Management and Operations Department, where she leads three modules: Analysing and Managing Information, Analysing and Managing Information for HR and Project Management. She is also Westminster Business School’s Senior Faculty Tutor responsible for personal tutoring arrangements at both postgraduate and undergraduate levels.\n\nOn her appointment Simpson said: \"It is very exciting and a great honour to be joining the Court of Governors. I firmly believe that education is the most valuable and transformational thing we can give to anyone. I look forward to working with colleagues and the Court to deliver the best possible university experience for everyone.\"\n\nSimpson will be joined by Steve Ford, Campus Services Manager at the University of Westminster. Ford has developed an extensive range of experience over the years, particularly around facilities management and property project management. He co-founded and developed Alpha Contract Solutions Ltd, a human resources company that specialises in the recruitment and delivery of labour, and worked as Facilities Manager at Hertfordshire County Council between 2012-2017.\n\nAbout his appointment Ford said: “I’m delighted to be provided with the opportunity to represent my colleagues in Professional Services at the Court of Governors, which I will do to the best of my abilities. I’m also looking forward to contributing to the continued improvements our University is making to ensure it is a special place to be for students and colleagues alike.”\n\nAnother appointment to the Court of Governors is Chidambar Yogesh Dhapatkar, Entrepreneurship, Enterprise Development and Innovation MSc student and Vice President of Postgraduate Education. Before he started his studies at the University of Westminster in 2023, he achieved a Bachelor of Commerce from the Maharashtra Institute of Technology, India.\n\nHe said: \"Education has always been my cornerstone, shaping me into a resilient and capable individual. I am deeply passionate about the University’s mission to empower students and colleagues from all backgrounds to reach their full potential. It's imperative that everyone has equitable access to education, and I am committed to working with the Court of Governors to foster a positive, inclusive culture and exceptional teaching environment. Our goal is to equip students with the confidence, knowledge and skills necessary not just for academic success, but for their personal and professional journeys beyond university, building strong and impactful individuals.\"\n\nThe final appointment is Divanshu Airan, the former Vice President of Welfare and the newly appointed UWSU President for the 2024-25 academic year. Before coming to the University of Westminster to study Corporate Finance Law LLB he earned a Law degree from Kurukshetra University in India and has worked as a Lawyer in a variety of roles.\n\nAbout his appointment he said: ”I am a dedicated and passionate individual committed to making a significant impact in higher education. Throughout my academic journey at the University, I have actively participated in various roles, including serving as the Vice President of Welfare at UWSU. In this role, I implemented numerous initiatives to support student well-being, demonstrating my unwavering commitment to enhancing the student experience. As an advocate with experience practicing criminal law in India, I bring a unique perspective to this new role. Now, as the incoming President of the Students' Union and an appointed Governor, I am poised to continue my advocacy for student welfare and contribute significantly to the University community. My dedication, vision and diverse experience make me an invaluable asset to the institution.”\n\nChair of the Court of Governors, Professor Lynne Berry, said: \"I’m delighted to welcome Divanshu Airan, Chidambar Yogesh Dhapatkar, Steve Ford and Henryetta Simpson to the Court of Governors. Each brings valuable experiences from their different backgrounds and they all bring a commitment to our common purpose of ensuring the University is well governed and focused on achieving our strategic priorities."
