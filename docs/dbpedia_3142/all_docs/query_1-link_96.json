        "text": "Co-opted Committee Members\n\nEducation Committee\n\nVanessa Audas (EYFS) After studying for a BED Hons at Christ Church Canterbury I knew that my career path was going to be with the Early Years. My passion for the education of young children still burns brightly today. I worked as a Reception teacher before becoming the Director of EYFS in a primary school then moving on to become Deputy Head of an Outstanding village infant school. From there I became Head of EYFS and Key Stage One at Brentwood School, a role which I held for ten years. During that time I led the Prep children, families and staff through an ambitious expansion and new build resulting in a successful three form entry point to Brentwood.\n\nI retired from this role in July 2023 and with my husband relocated to Suffolk. We are both enjoying exploring this new county, having time for new hobbies and opportunities. We have one daughter who also work in Early Years education and lives in Essex.\n\nPeter Jones I trained at Carnegie College of Physical Education, Leeds before starting my teaching career in Essex in the early eighties. As Head of PE and Games at Holmwood House, I also took on various regional roles including PE Subject Secretary for the East Anglian Area Training Board and I ran various large sports events for the local primary school circuit. During those early years, I became a trustee at my local sports club and created a highly successful activity holiday schedule which I later trained a number of schools to develop.\n\nI spent eight years as Deputy Head of Holmwood House before being appointed Headmaster of Littlegarth School in September 2003. Working with the team to strengthen key areas of the School, I helped to raise the reputation of Littlegarth across the region and ensure increasingly strong numbers, thus enabling the School to develop outstanding teaching facilities. I also took on various responsibilities as a member of IAPS and retired as Head of Littlegarth in September 2021 after 40 years in the teaching profession.\n\nFinance, Audit and Resources Committee\n\nStephen Doe I am a Financial Planner and Managing Director of Big Skies Wealth Management. My career as an IFA followed 20 years in equity research in London, Hong Kong, Jakarta and New York for firms including Morgan Stanley and UBS. In my spare time I am Treasurer of the Ipswich Town FC Supporters Club, a trustee and Assistant Treasurer of the Disability Advice Service East Suffolk and am a keen traveller.\n\nDavid Scrivener I live with my family just outside Woodbridge and my two daughters attend the school – one in the Prep and one in the Senior School. It is fair to say that they both love it! In my business life, I am a partner at Ensors Accountants LLP and a fellow of the ICAEW. I work with organisations that are looking to make a step change – usually through acquisition, divestment or raising finance. In my career, I have worked with several charitable organisations to assist them with business cases for large projects and critically evaluating their financial strategy. My firm is one of only a few in the country who are accredited to act as interim managers by the Charity Commission. I have held school governor roles in two local primary schools dealing with issues such as potential academisation. Outside of work, I enjoy running and playing golf as well as spending time with my young family.\n\nCare Committee\n\nDr Alison Townsley I am a GP partner at Framfield House Surgery and Medical Officer for the boarders at Woodbridge School. I grew up in Sydney Australia and moved to the UK where I went to school in Surrey. I studied medicine at The University of Nottingham and then moved to London where I completed my GP training at Ealing and Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals. I moved to Suffolk in 2011 and took up my current position at Framfield House Surgery. I am very involved in training and teach medical students from the UEA and am a postgraduate trainer of future GPs.\n\nFather Nigel Prior I am Rector of Woodbridge St Mary and Great Bealings, and joined these communities ‘virtually’ in the summer of 2020. I am also a Governor of St Mary’s CE Primary School. I come with nearly 40 years of priestly ministry – from inner city Manchester and more recently, Mayfield in East Sussex. I spent 20 years there with particular responsibility for creating a new cottage hospice within the Parish and close links with the chaplaincy at Mayfield School. I have theology degrees from Bristol and Chichester Universities and was privileged to have Rowan Williams as my tutor at theological college in Cambridge. My other interests include a passion for ‘green issues’, modern art, music, literature and drama – as well as enjoying regular dog-walking locally to escape the ‘traffic’ of too many e-mails!\n\nPeter Knights My journey through my working life has been varied with careers ranging from Corporate Banking and Finance through to senior leadership roles within the health sector, including being a Business Partner for a large Primary Care provider, to sitting on various health care boards including Practice Based Commissioning Groups and more recently the Governing Body of West Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group. I am delighted to have the opportunity to serve as a voluntary committee member for the Seckford Foundation, and hope that my knowledge and experience, both strategic and hands on, in both finance and care service provisioning, will assist in helping to steer the Foundation successfully towards its chosen goals. I live just outside Woodbridge with my wife and Cocker Spaniel, and have two grown up children who have flown the nest and are pursuing careers in medicine and local government.\n\nAlma Sinclair I grew up in the west of Scotland and studied psychology at the University of Glasgow. After graduating I spent a year as a research assistant at the university and worked in residential settings with children and adolescents in Hertfordshire and London. I then completed a postgraduate social work course at Queen’s College Glasgow. After qualifying as a social worker, I worked in the London Borough of Islington for eleven years, at first working with children and adults and later specialising in work with adults. I moved to Suffolk with my husband and two small children twenty seven years ago and have lived in the centre of Woodbridge since then. I began working for Suffolk County Council as a social worker in 1998 and retired in 2022 after 24 years working for Adult Services. My posts included a role giving professional guidance to other social workers and being a practice educator. My most recent role was in a specialist team contributing to assessments for continuing healthcare.\n\nI enjoy walking, travelling, and reading. I am a member of the Deben Canoe Club and enjoy kayaking on the Deben. I act as a volunteer guide for the Sutton Hoo Ship’s Company. In joining the Care Committee I hope to use my professional experience to support the excellent work of Seckford Care.\n\nCompliance and Risk Committee\n\nKay Maddox-Daines I am a consultant and educator in leadership and people management. I have worked in a range of education and HR leadership roles in both the public and private sector. I am a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, a Visiting Fellow at the University of Suffolk and a UK Registered Career Development Professional. Author of ‘Managing People in the Hybrid Workplace’ and ‘How to Pass your CIPD Qualifications, both published by Routledge and ‘How to get ahead in HR’, published by London Publishing Partnership, I am a keen researcher and writer in the field of work and organisations.\n\nSarah Ralph I am the Risk and Compliance Director at Birketts LLP Solicitors, based in Ipswich. I became involved with the School when my two children came to the senior school. Although they have since moved on to the next part of their lives, I still enjoy supporting the School. I enjoy walking my two dogs round the Suffolk countryside and making trips to see my children at University.\n\nPresident\n\nBaron Neuberger of Abbotsbury has been the President of the Seckford Foundation since 2011. Lord Neuberger was called to the Bar in 1974, took silk in 1987 and was appointed a High Court Judge in 1996. He became a Lord of Appeal in 2007 and in 2009 was appointed Master of the Rolls.
