I became a parent governor in2010 as I always wanted to contribute towards the development of my local community as well as being a part of shaping the future of our next generations. My two children both Jabir (8years old) and Jannah (5years old) go to GVPS- and I am really proud to be a part of their learning & development journey.\n\nI have always been a great admirer of ‘education’. Previously, I served as a local authority governor at another school in Sandwell over the past years. Currently, I am a Governor of Sandwell College too.\n\nProfessionally, I work as a manager at Community Connect Foundation (CCF) that provides a range of services including providing education and skills development training opportunities for young people and adults. I am also a Chartered Marketer and a member of Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM).\n\nI strongly believe, these are really exciting times to be at GVPS. We, ‘the school community’ are determined not only to be outstanding in all we do, but also to develop and sustain a unique learning culture that makes being part of the school an engaging and challenging experience for all our pupils.\n\nAt GVPS, we are on a mission to create something really special – an inclusive and cooperative school with exceptional standards that is rooted in its local community.\n\nMrs. S.

We have a fabulous team of staff who work tirelessly to secure the very best for our children. It warms my heart to hear visitors comment on the friendly and warm welcome they receive when they visit our school. Our families are wonderful to work with as they are supportive and caring, wanting their children to face any challenges with resilience in order to become independent learners of the future.\n\nGalton Valley Primary School also sits within a great community who offer support and are proud of their local school. We are lucky to have a steady governing body where individuals with various, relevant experience provide their support and challenge in their own free time. As a school, we are grateful for this support and challenge which is allowing us to move forward and strengthen further as a school.\n\nMrs. K.
