        "text": "Westminster School is making tentative steps towards admitting girls to all year groups for the first time, The Telegraph reports.\n\nFor the past 50 years girls have been allowed to join the sixth form at the London school, which was founded in the early 14th century.\n\nBut the Telegraph reports that Westminster wants to allow girls to attend in all year groups to fully reflect the diversity of 21st century London and in response to demand.\n\nIt is understood that the school plans to become fully co-educational by 2030. The change will apply to the “under school”, which takes boys from the age of seven, as well as the senior school, where pupils join from the age of 13.\n\n“Although no dates are yet confirmed, we look forward to reaching the point at which we can make this significant change to our school, enabling any child who would flourish here to be able to come, irrespective of gender,” said a spokesman.\n\nThe decision comes after a review last year recommended that girls be allowed to attend from a younger age.\n\nIt followed allegations from former and existing pupils of sexual harassment and sexual violence posted on the Everyone’s Invited website."
