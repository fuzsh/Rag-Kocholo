        "text": "Welcome to our Governors’ section.\n\nThis page is currently being updated since we have now officially federated with Queen's Park Early Years Federation. We will update you with the details of our newly formed Governing Body shortly.\n\nGovernors have a vital role to play in making sure every child gets the best possible education and opportunities from our school. The governors have to:\n\nMake sure that there is a clear idea of where the school aims to be in the next 5 years (the vision for the school), what kind of school we want it to be (its ‘ethos’) and how we are going to get there (its ‘strategic direction’).\n\nHold the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils.\n\nLook at the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent.\n\nTherefore governors aren’t responsible for the day-to-day running of the school – that’s the job of the headteacher.\n\nA governor is elected or appointed for four years. Governors have the right and responsibility to express their view in discussions at the governing body and vote accordingly. However, once a decision has been taken all governors have a collective responsibility to support the decisions of the governing body and act together.\n\nOrganisation of the governing body\n\nThe full governing body meets at least 6 times a year. At different points during the year the meetings will have different focuses.\n\nMeetings relating to school finances, the curriculum, the school grounds, staffing and community projects are held with the common purpose of ensuring that the children at Queen's Park Primary School receive the best possible education and make fantastic progress."
