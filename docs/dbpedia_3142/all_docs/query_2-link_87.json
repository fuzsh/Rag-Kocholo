The role of the governing board is absolutely key to the effectiveness of a school. Time and time again Ofsted (the national inspection body for schools) has noted that the most effective schools demonstrate effective leadership and management – including by the governing board.\n\nStrategic leadership\n\nSchool governors provide strategic leadership and accountability in schools. They appoint the headteacher and deputy headteacher. Governors hold the main responsibility for finance in schools, and it is governors who work with the headteacher to make the tough decisions about balancing resources.\n\nEach individual governor is a member of a governing board, which is established in law as a corporate body. Individual governors may not act independently of the rest of the governing board and decisions are the joint responsibility of the governing board.\n\nThe role of the governing board is a strategic one with three key functions:\n\nOverseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent.\n\nHolding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils\n\nEnsuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction\n\nSchool governors have a number of responsibilities:\n\nGovernors set the aims and objectives for the school or group of schools.\n\nThey set the policies and targets for achieving those aims and objectives.\n\nThey monitor and evaluate the progress the school is making and act as a source of challenge and support to the headteacher (a critical friend).\n\nThe headteacher is responsible for the internal organisation, management and control of the school and the implementation of the strategic framework established by the governing board."
