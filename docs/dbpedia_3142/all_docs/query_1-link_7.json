        "text": "We wish Mr David Summerscale the very best on his retirement as Chair of Governors of Kensington Wade.\n\nMr Summerscale has been our Chair of Governors since the launch of the school in 2017 and will be sorely missed. He was instrumental in setting up our governors’ committee and, with his wealth of educational experience, has been a font of knowledge and advice.\n\nMr Summerscale was thanked for his service last week and presented with a gift of framed calligraphy by Yong Heng, a poem by Cui Hu崔护 called ‘Written in a Village South of the Capital題都城南莊’. A plaque at the bottom of the frame read ‘Presented to David Summerscale with profound thanks by his grateful colleagues at Kensington Wade School, 26th June 2023’.\n\nGovernor, Mr Rodney Harris, former Headmaster of Chengdu Westminster School, will take over from Mr Summerscale in September."
