        "text": "Gill Abbott – Chair of Governors\n\n“I was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire and moved to London in 1987. I have two grown up children who attended St Agnes school and with this solid foundation that they have both achieved greater things today. I have been a school Governor at St Agnes for 20 years. I feel greatly privileged to serve as a Governor for our ‘Outstanding’ school and support the amazing staff and headteacher.\n\nSharon Noden – Foundation Governor\n\nI have served as a Governor since 2012, first as a Parent Governor and now as a Foundation Governor.”\n\nLisa Pate – Foundation Governor\n\n“I have been a Governor at St Agnes for 10 years and all my children have attended this school. I have a background in science and have worked with children with Special Educational Needs. I am passionate about education and really value the exceptional efforts that everyone at St Agnes’ go to to ensure our children succeed. I am also proud to be part of an inclusive and welcoming Catholic Community”.\n\nFr John Buckley – Foundation Governor\n\n“I trained to be a Priest in Ireland for the Diocese of Westminster and I have now been in the Diocese for 42 years. I have served in a number of Parishes, more recently been Parish Priest in Tottenham for 18 years after being Parish Priest for 10 years at Harrow Road.\n\nI have been St Agnes’ Parish Priest for 4 years.\n\nMy interests relate to Church matters, current affairs, history and sport. I’m very keen on establishing and maintaining links between Parish and the School. Academic education and education in faith are two sides of the coin to me and serve as the ultimate purpose of our endeavours as the Community of Faith here in Cricklewood.”\n\nSusan O’Reilly – Head Teacher & Foundation Governor\n\n“I have worked in Catholic Schools with the Westminster Diocese since graduating from St Mary’s University in Strawberry Hill in 1993 – in the London Boroughs of Camden, Harrow & Barnet.\n\nI have been both Deputy Head of two schools and Acting Head and am currently in the very privileged position of being the Head Teacher of St Agnes’ Catholic Primary School since April 2014. Working as part of a genuine community – where Governors, parents and staff all work together to ensure that our children have access to an outstanding Catholic education is key to our success.\n\nSt Agnes School is an inclusive and flourishing school, of which I am very proud to be a part of as we journey together into the next phase of our history and expansion of our school.”\n\nSophie Gale – Staff Governor\n\n“I have worked at St Agnes since 2004. During that time, I have been lucky enough to teach in various classes – 3/4, 3, 1/2 and 6 – where I am currently one of the class teachers. I have previously led ICT and English across the school. Over my tenure as staff governor I have seen many changes. It has been very exciting and a privilege to be a part of it all. St Agnes’ is my second family and I truly believe that the staff and governors hold the children’s best interests at the heart of each decision. I look forward to continuing in being a part of the future of our outstanding school as we continue to grow in many exciting ways.”\n\nMaureen Brookbanks – Elected Parent Governor\n\nMy relationship with the St Agnes’ community is now almost four-decades long. I was baptised in St Agnes’ Church and attended St Agnes’ School along with my two sisters. I loved school and, today, feel privileged to be sending my daughter, Grace, to such a warm, caring and clearly thriving institution – one that has been at the heart of my family for so long.\n\nI’m currently an editor and journalist at a national newspaper, a role I have had for over 15 years. I hope to bring my professional expertise to bear in my role as Governor, and help negotiate what is a challenging time for schools and families. From assisting with fundraising and communication, to improving academic standards and instilling a passion for learning in all children, I aim to do my best for the whole school community in my role as Parent Governor, and help children from normal backgrounds just like mine accede to their full potential.\n\nJack Cohen – Local Authority Governor\n\n“I was the local Councillor for Childs Hill from 1986 to 2018. I have served as a Governor at St Agnes’ since 1986. Until my retirement, I worked as a Probation Officer. I was Mayor of Barnet in 2000”.\n\nMarie Molloy\n\nI have the privilege of working as Parish Secretary at St Agnes’ Church. My son attended St Agnes’ School and thoroughly enjoyed his time there. He received excellent teaching, nurturing, pastoral care and outstanding co-curricular opportunities. I hope to foster the already strong links between the Church and the School.\n\nFiona Garnett\n\nI have lived in the local area for over 16 years and know of the school’s brilliant reputation and was delighted when my eldest daughter Zoe secured a place in reception 6 years ago and is now in her final year and has grown so much academically and personally in this time, as well as the schools values are also with my two younger children, Emilie and Isabelle who are also thriving. I have been working in banking with the same Bank all my adult life and have been a Bank Manager for over 20 years and I am currently the Bank Manager of a branch only 3 miles from the school. I hope to bring my knowledge and experiences to the governor role and support the school to provide the excellent care and standards that my children receive to all the children who attend now and in the future.\n\nCaireen O’Hagan\n\nI am a practicing Architect specialising in designing places for human experience. I am fascinated by the relationships between people and places. As well as practising, I’ve also taught architecture and interior design at UCL, the University of Greenwich, Falmouth University and the Boston Architecture Centre.\n\nOriginally from Scotland, I have lived in Barnet for over 10 years. I am married to an American with whom we have a 13-year old son who attends Finchley Catholic Hight School.\n\nAs part of the St. Agnes Governing team I am delighted to have the opportunity to offer my perspective as a local Catholic parent and my professional expertise on matters particularly relating to the school environment.\n\nEwelina Magnaye\n\nI was born in Poland and relocated to the UK in my early twenties. I am married and have three wonderful children Matylda, Zachary and Philip. I’ve been a proud member of St Agnes’ community for 6 years now with my boys attending the school. I can see them thrive, which makes me realise how the academic knowledge and values that Primary school teaches can affect a child’s whole life and help and shape their future.\n\nI have studied Sociology and hold an MA in Global Governance and Sustainable Development. I would hope to bring my knowledge of building an inclusive and equal environment to the Governing Body and help all pupils achieve their very best. I am very happy to serve the community in the role of Parent Governor and hope to contribute to the great future of the school."
