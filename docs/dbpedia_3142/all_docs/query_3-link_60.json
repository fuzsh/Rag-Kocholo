This consolidated governance of all public education in Rhode Island is an innovative integration of policymaking and planning for elementary, secondary and higher public education in our state.\n\nMeet the Board of Education\n\nSeventeen volunteer citizens answered the call of our RI Governor to review, revise, and establish programs; structures and policies that will prepare all Rhode Island students for college, careers, and life."
