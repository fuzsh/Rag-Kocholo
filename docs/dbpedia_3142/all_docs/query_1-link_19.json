        "text": "David Dangoor CBE\n\nThe Exilarchâ€™s Foundation\n\nWe are very proud to have sponsored Westminster Academy since it opened in 2006. This has been a period of steady development with significant improvements in each of these years.\n\nIt has been very gratifying being alongside a hard working and dedicated team of teachers and staff, and its remarkable leadership. Our aim has been to support their inspiring teaching of the students, who are drawn from so many diverse backgrounds.\n\nWestminster Academy has the benefit of a resourceful and effective group of Trustees, with an exceptional Chair, which has maintained an ambitious strategy for excellence.\n\nWe are committed to continue to build links with outstanding outside organisations that add enriching dimensions to the student experience at the Academy.\n\nWe know that we need to improve continuously, to ensure that every student feels the benefit of their years of effort at this Academy for the whole of their adult life.\n\nMike Karp OBE\n\nChair of Board of Trustees\n\nThe aim of Westminster Academy has always been to make this a centre of educational excellence and an amenity open to all of the community. We are proud to be located in one of the most diverse communities in Central London and it remains the express intent of the Dangoor Family, our sponsors, to meet the needs of local students, parents and residents.\n\nTo fulfil our aims, we have various initiatives and facilities, including Academy Sport and Academy Community, which provide opportunities to all the community to use the Academy building and facilities. We hope that if you are a resident in Westminster and in particular in the Westbourne area that you will share our pride and feel that the Academy is there for you.\n\nMay I welcome the community to engage with the school, its Principal and teachers; for our part the Board of Trustees will continue to build upon the reputation and the community outreach plans of the Academy."
