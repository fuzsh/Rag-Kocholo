The Governors of The Yehudi Menuhin School are delighted to announce the appointment of Kate Clanchy as Head with effect from January 2018. Kate is currently Senior Master at Westminster School, responsible for all extra-curricular activities, including music, and for the day-to-day smooth running of the School. She was previously Deputy Head and Director of Studies at St Paul's Girls' School.

Kate is married to James, a solicitor and commercial arbitrator. They have a son at university and a daughter in her final year at school.

Chairman of Governors Richard Morris writes: 'My fellow Governors and I greatly look forward to welcoming Kate Clanchy in January 2018 as the next Head of our unique school to build upon the many achievements of our current Head, Richard Hillier. As a distinguished and caring teacher and a modern linguist, with deep musical interests and business experience, Kate is exceptionally well-qualified for this post.'

Kate comments: 'I am thrilled to have been chosen to lead this wonderful school which continues to live up to Yehudi Menuhin's musical, educational and internationalist ideals.

I am looking forward to joining a very special community and getting to know all the pupils, staff, parents, and supporters of the school.'
