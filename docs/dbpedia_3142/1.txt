The School is owned by Westminster Abbey, which is absolutely committed to maintaining a specialist choir school and subsidising its running costs very considerably. The management, control and direction of the School is the responsibility of a Governing Body which includes several members, independent of the Abbey, who bring specialist experience and advice.

Governors meet in full once a term. The two sub-committees (Education & Policy and Finance & General Purposes) also meet at least termly and report to the Board.

Just as important as the formal meetings are opportunities for governors to visit the school regularly to see, at first hand, all that goes on. Governors have very genuine responsibilities to oversee the well-being of the school and its professional operation, including its compliance with all relevant legislation and educational best practice; they take great pride in this responsibility.
