Chairman of Governors

Alex has lived in Fulham for almost 20 years. He is married, with three sons, and is one of the schoolâ€™s original Founders.

Alex has almost 24 years experience in banking and financial services, working for both National Westminster Bank and HSBC, where he spent 17 years. He is one of the most experienced London advisers in the international wealth management market and is particularly interested in the Middle East and understands the unique issues which are relevant there. In 2013, he became Founding Partner in Knightsbridge Wealth Ltd, advising clients from all over the world who choose London as their financial centre of choice.

He has a keen interest in travel, food and wine and enjoys watching most sport.

He believes his education transformed his life and created opportunities that he and his family could never have dreamt of. He always believed such opportunities could be available through publicly-funded education and leapt at the chance to help establish a Free School with an ambitious vision and built on the Christian faith.

Alex is the Chairman of Governors.
