from Ruth Baker's obituary in the Portland Press Herald, on Feb. 26, 2006:

"Ruth S. Baker, loving mother, grandmother and friend, passed away peacefully at home on Feb. 22, 2006 after a courageous battle with cancer.

Ruth was born Feb. 5, 1932, the only child of Charlotte Fineberg and attended Portland schools.

She was the long time owner and manager of Recordland, a well-known local record store exclusively to records and music operating from 1957-1991. Ruthie, as she was affectionately known, was a celebrity in her own right in Portland's music world. Her store was known locally as THE place to find any song a customer may need or want. She personally helped bring famous musicians to Portland, her favorite being Stan Kenton, who became her friend. Her customers loved her as a person, looked up to her as a mentor, admired her amazing musical knowledge and remained her special friends over the years. She loved them and that love was given back ten-fold especially during her illness.

When Ruthie retired and closed Recordland, she was recognized with a proclamation by the Portland City Council for her nearly 40 years of dedicated service to her customers and the business community. Ruthie was a successful businesswoman at a time when few women owned and operated their own business."
