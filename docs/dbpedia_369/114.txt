A story about a record shop --> Record land in Calgary needs no introduction and if you’ve never stepped inside this iconic store in Inglewood, stop reading this and go NOW, as the photos can’t justify the experience. Many know Armand Cohen the man who started Recordland, however, Armand is now residing stateside and the familiar face you regularly see amongst the narrow corridors is Armand’s son, Al. Before the actual brick and mortar Recordland, Al’s father started selling records out of his home and in farmers markets for a mere $0.50 back in 1978. As Al tells me "I remember listening to all types of music as a young child. My father played everything and anything. When I was 8, I loved heavy metal and my favourite artists never came from top 40 charts, it was always the stuff you never heard about or couldn’t find in your own city or country. Now, for me, it’s all about Reggae”. If you’re looking to kill some time or update your vinyl collection, I encourage you to get lost amongst the hundreds of thousands of albums in one of Calgary’s most famous stores and communities. If you don’t have a turntable, go get your dads old stereo out and listen to some music because they even have CD’s and tapes.
