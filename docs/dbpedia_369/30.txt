Recordland

Everyone knows that music is best heard on vinyl, simple enough. The record player has been making a comeback over the years, so we had to ask where the best place to buy music was in the city. With overwhelming angst, Calgary voted Recordland for the third year in a row!

With records stacked wall-to-wall, Recordland is teeming with old and new music just waiting to be bought and enjoyed. From the Beatles and Led Zeppelin to the XX and Mumford and Sons, the variety of music and selection at this location is outstanding. Plus, they have been known to have a solid sale from time to time, so make sure keep an eye on their Facebook page for the next big blowout. Records look cool and sound phenomenal; need we have any other argument?
