        "text": "A generation ago, you’d find piles of CDs in every home: living rooms dotted with skyward-sprouting tower racks of elegantly-angled CDs; car storage compartments jammed full of CDs, spilling out onto the floor; thick plastic water-resistant binders of CDs slung over shoulders. A time before that, it was LPs. Virtually every family had a record collection, a household feature so commonplace it was completely unremarkable. For decades, built-in demand ensured that even a small town was likely to have an HMV at the mall. Today the opposite is true; where records and CDs were once a ubiquitous household item, they’re now a specialty product for collectors, DJs and audio enthusiasts. For all the talk of a vinyl resurgence in recent years, its retail sphere has contracted to a niche market. While this means that there are less consumers, they also tend to be a lot more serious, either in terms of their knowledge of the product, or the amount of money they’re willing to spend.\n\nThere are far fewer record stores across Canada now, but so many of them are great, with helpful staff and one-of-a-kind collections. Some of these stores are beloved local institutions that have successfully adapted to the new retail horizons, and are bringing in new customers and new energy. Here’s a roundup of a handful of Canada’s record stores to check out from coast to coast, and a bit about what makes each so special.\n\nCosmos Records (Toronto, Ontario)\n\nThere is no place in the country that will make your jaw drop like Cosmos Records. To head into the store and flip through the new arrivals bin is to feel your heart leap into your throat every couple of seconds, as you come across LPs you never thought you’d actually find digging.\n\nCosmos is known by collectors the world over, and its bins (and prices) immediately show you why. Aki Abe founded the store in the late 90s, after getting his start shipping North American records to Japanese retailers. In just a few short years, Abe had amassed a reputation for scoring unbelievable rarities, sometimes in the form of huge collections. Soon enough, he had to open a second location, the larger Cosmos West, just a couple of blocks farther down Queen Street.\n\nThe store trades internationally in its utterly unique collection and Abe’s unparalleled track record for unearthing lost classics. You think you’ve found a holy grail jam that nobody knows about? Take a trip to Cosmos; it’s probably already up on the wall, with a $100 price tag on it.\n\nAtom Heart (Montréal, Québec)\n\nAtom Heart is celebrated by both locals and travelers to Montréal for its exquisitely maintained selection of both local and new music that’s making waves among the city’s audiophiles. If any store on this list is worthy of the term “curation,” it’s probably Atom Heart — every record on display and in the bins feels as though it was carefully vetted before being placed there.\n\nWhat is perhaps underappreciated about Atom Heart, but goes a long way toward explaining the shop’s longevity, is the way the store is set up to provide bridges to new discovery for intermediate listeners from all backgrounds. Atom Heart goes deep on all genres, allowing for cross-pollination opportunities for curious listeners. You might go there looking for an Alice Coltrane reissue and, by the time you’ve walked out, you’re carrying a Voivod reissue as well. And if they don’t have a title in stock, they’re almost always able to find it out in the world. Among some customers, they’re legends just for their special ordering service alone.\n\nInto the Music (Winnipeg, Manitoba)\n\nOpening in 1987, Into the Music arrived just in time to ride the CD wave, and found its legs within its first few years. During the 90s, when many independent labels and local scenes (including Winnipeg’s) were thriving, Into the Music found itself embedded within the music scene, with local musicians and enthusiasts serving as both the staff and a good chunk of the customer base. Owner Greg Tonn has always emphasized the importance of respecting both his staff and customers, and has received a lot of loyalty in return.\n\nIn 2003, around the time the physical media-bound market began to dive-bomb, Into the Music moved from its longtime home in Osborne Village to Winnipeg’s Exchange District. This space became a vital performance hub in Winnipeg for bands travelling across Canada, playing host to tons of memorable underground rock shows during the late aughts. The energy at these shows helped to showcase what was so special about the store and the community that had come together around it.\n\nEarlier this year, they returned to Osborne Street in an encouraging fashion. When their former neighbours and fellow retailers Music Trader closed down in 2017, Into the Music purchased the store and the leftover stock, and offered to re-hire the staff back to their old jobs. Now with two locations, Into the Music is an institution that’s stronger than ever within Winnipeg’s music scene. A lot of that has to do with Tonn’s deep understanding of how it’s a dialogue between the retailer and their community, and the shifting forces that undergird both.\n\nLe Knock-Out (Québec City, Québec)\n\nLe Knock-Out blazes with the fun-loving and self-assured attitude of its owner Rox Arcand, who has always defied the “boys club” vibes that have dogged punk scenes and music retail since the beginning. Since opening the store in 2012, she’s poured much of her time and resources into the store being a one-of-kind repository for new and used records from DIY genres, as well as a performance space for both bands and DJs. Punk and noise aficionados from the world over come to Le Knock-Out for its selection of obscure Québecois and Canadian LPs and 7”s, and locals show up in droves for in-store events.\n\nAlthough it functions as a monument-in-progress to the city’s perpetually vital punk history, the store also brings in stock from all genres, a practice that works to push hardcore customers toward new horizons, while also bringing curious collectors and musicians deeper in touch with adjacent DIY scenes.\n\nInvisible City Records (Toronto, Ontario)\n\nIt’s hard to think of a record store that’s doing a better job of navigating the modern retail landscape than Invisible City. A combo record store, label office and performance spot, Invisible City is a tidy, welcoming space that attracts a lot of foot traffic in its neighbourhood of art studios, antique shops and microbreweries. But it attracts even more web traffic with its consistently amazing in-store turntable sessions, featuring weekly sets by favourite Toronto DJs and a who’s who of touring musicians. Stopping by Invisible City on a Saturday afternoon is almost always a chance to get a sneak preview of whatever party might be happening in town that night, and a chance to watch the DJ who will be spinning at said party do their thing about two feet away from you. And the store’s selection is great — their used bins are full of amazing $5 deals and a selection of Caribbean genres that’s unparalleled.\n\nRecordland (Calgary, Alberta)\n\nThis one’s a no-brainer: Recordland endures because it’s the biggest collection for sale anywhere in Canada. There are about a million records filling the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall shelves across the rather unassuming 2 story-building that houses the store.\n\nRecordland thrived throughout the late 70s and 80s, going from an ad hoc retail operation in Armand Cohen’s living room to the country’s largest record store, a labyrinth of winding shelves featuring used records from every corner of the music universe, as well as a carefully selected array of new releases to boot.\n\nWhen Cohen retired from running the store a couple of years ago, the new owners tried to place emphasis on bringing in more customers, and refreshing the selection of new records to reflect more dynamic emerging music. Business is brisk in recent times, and locals whose visits had dropped off over the years have become regulars again. It also doesn’t hurt that there is never-ending traffic from collectors on pilgrimages from all over, and the churning turnover from all the crate-digging means that the used bins are constantly awash with incoming freshness.\n\nTaz Records (Halifax, Nova Scotia)\n\n5000 km away from Calgary, the East Coast enjoys a similarly bottomless well of holy grail LP finds in Taz Records, another store defined by its owner’s cantankerous ways. Every day, customers would queue up to ask Bob Switzer whether he had this or that rare record, only to endure a lecture from him about their awful taste in music, at the end of which he would miraculously produce the record they’d been asking about.\n\nAfter Switzer’s passing, friends helped sort through the piles of overstock and get the store’s books in order. While hanging onto their loyal long-term customers, Taz began to branch out, offering sound systems and accessories, in addition to a wider variety of genres. Soon enough, the once-languishing store began to thrive in the middle of the most challenging years of music retail. The staff, spanning several generations in terms of age, brought a lot of new ideas with them, and the store’s inventory exploded in every direction, with loads more offerings from other genres appearing on the shelves.\n\nA whole generation of collectors, musicians and enthusiasts know and love the store in its more recent, super-sized incarnation, just as an older generation of Haligonians was forever transformed by Switzer’s seemingly endless network of distro connections. Beneath all Switzer’s bluster was an inexhaustible enthusiasm for selling records that never let up, matched only by his relentless contempt for the Beatles.\n\nZulu Records (Vancouver, British Columbia)\n\nZulu Records is indelibly woven into Canadian punk history, a place that’s always transcended its status as a record store and serves as more of a community center. It was opened by Grant McDonagh in 1981, when Vancouver’s Kitsilano neighbourhood was still very much a hippie/weirdo enclave. Intense waves of gentrification have transformed the neighbourhood into a high-end shopping district, which has made Zulu’s place along the strip feel more anomalous, but also has further entrenched the sense that they are a neighbourhood institution.\n\nJust like Rough Trade in London, Zulu ran its own label, putting out records by Sook-Yin Lee, Slow and NoMeansNo, among others. The store itself has long been a crucial live venue, with a long list of legendary in-store performances over the years, many of which are archived for viewing online.\n\nSkyrocketing property values in the area have meant that Zulu has moved around the block a little, and resized its retail space a few times to adapt to the changing foot traffic. In 2011, they merged with next door neighbours Videomatica, effectively branching out into VHS, DVD and Blu-ray territory. With both businesses operating under the same roof, Zulu has been re-energized as one of West Vancouver’s finest culture-foraging spots.\n\nCheap Thrills (Montréal, Québec)\n\nFounded in 1971, Cheap Thrills was Montréal’s first used record store, and now it reigns as the city’s oldest record store, full stop. It’s been operating out of its tiny downtown second floor location for about 35 years, the sloping stairway a testament to how the piles and piles of records have permanently warped the whole building.\n\nCheap Thrills’ secret weapon is its used book selection. It’s a first rate repository for books related to music; and for everything else, it’s a goldmine that’s overlooked by many of the city’s collectors of second-hand anglo literature. As with the LPs — the store specializes in very small labels and limited pressings, among other things — the selection seems to show deep knowledge of the store’s customers and their interests.\n\nLike a few other stores mentioned above, Cheap Thrills is just one side of owner Gary Worsley’s musical ambitions: he also runs the label Alien8 Recordings, known for putting out releases by Acid Mothers Temple, Merzbow, Tim Hecker, The Unicorns, Lesbians on Ecstasy and more. Unsurprisingly, the store’s inventory is especially strong in these areas, and adjacent avant garde genres. But it’s also got a well-rounded inventory and a constantly cycling selection of used records, the result of copious foot traffic from the nearby university campuses and hotel district.\n\nJune Records (Toronto, Ontario)\n\nIt’s hard to single out any one thing about June Records that makes it such a great store to visit, and it’s because it thrives by offering the total package: amazing staff; great selection; fantastic location; modern, well-lit environment; and unbridled support to its surrounding community and the Toronto music scene. Since establishing itself in 2012, June has steadily built a reputation for attracting the more eccentric and adventurous collectors and scenesters, and the staff has a knack both for spotting emerging trends and setting them loose in the local community. This reputation is bolstered by the range of events held in-store: minimalist dance parties, avant garde jams, electroacoustic performances, and other shows that don’t fit great in a typical club-type venue, but feel transcendent in the store’s welcoming environment.\n\nIn some ways, June’s success is predicated on the same model as Atom Heart in Montréal: a small but impeccably curated selection of records that goes deep in every genre, and is set up to lead curious listeners to new musical horizons. The store’s omnidirectional musical interests keep the shelves packed with amazing new releases from all over, and it’s clear they’re making an effort to bring in inventory from beyond Canada’s lamentably rockist distribution networks. Whether it’s with a bag full of amazingly great dollar bin finds or a super-rare holy grail that owner/founder Ian Cheung managed to find in the ether, everybody scores at June. And maybe the part that seals the whole deal is that, with its location deep in Little Italy, you can choose from about a dozen nearby coffee and gelato spots to sit and bask in the glow of your new records.\n\nThe potential for discovery is what lies at the heart of the record store experience. We go to record stores because we’re hoping for unexpected wonder, browsing the vivid cover art on the walls, hunting for holy grails in the used bins, looking for more recommendations from the clerk who “gets” us, or just quietly seeking inspiration, refining taste and making friends."
