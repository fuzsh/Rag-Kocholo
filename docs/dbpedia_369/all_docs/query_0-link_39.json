        "text": "It's the series that just won't quit!!!\n\nWe're STILL receiving FIRST 45's Stories ... so we've added yet another page to our website!\n\nSend us YOUR FIRST 45's Memories ... and then check back to see yours posted with hundreds and hundreds of others.Â (I guess we never really forget our first, do we?!?!?)Â Enjoy!\n\nEVEN MORE OF YOUR FIRST 45's MEMORIES ARE NOW POSTED ON THE FORGOTTEN HITS WEB PAGE!!!Â Enjoy!\n\nWhen Sheryl Crow recorded the old Jackson Five Hit \"I Want You Back\" for her new \"100 Miles From Memphis\" CD, she told reporters that this was the very first 45 she ever bought.Â How cool is it that she first rose to fame as one of Michael Jackson's background singers!!!\n\nÂ\n\nThe first recordÂ Bobby Abrams ever bought was a 45 of \"Hey Baby They're Playin' Our Song\" by The Buckinghams.Â His mother thought they were \"nice clean cut young men\", not wild like those other bands.Â Many years later, Bob Abrams would join The Buckinghams ... and play lead guitar for the band for 24 years!\n\nThe first 45 I bought wasÂ Pleasant Valley Sunday by The Monkees !!!Â I still have the picture cover, and of course the record is mostly white now from playing it many, manyÂ times. I grew up on a farm and got 25 cents a week for an allowance. So, I had to save for awhile. Thanks for doing this article, it's been fun.\n\nSusan Cox\n\nDo you remember your first vinyl music? Of course I had a few Beatles' 45's and LPs in the 60's that I would love to own now.Â Some of the first records I purchased go back to the late 50's including Laurie London's \"He's Got The Whole World In His Hands,\" Johnny Horton's \"Battle of New Orleans\" and \"Sink the Bismark,\" and Connie Francis' \"Lipstick On Your Collar.\"\n\nJust thought this list would be interested.\n\nChris Jones\n\nIt was 1956, I was listening to pop and rock 'n' roll music AMAP and I was determined to get that record \"Singing The Blues\" by Guy Mitchell (Columbia).Â I was so proud that my selection topped the charts for so many weeks. I played it many times, but was concerned about wearing it out.Â After that there were many more records I wanted, but alas, I had no money, so my record collecting had to wait for years until I had a job and had bought my first car.\n\nIn 1964 my serious record collecting began, still constrained by available funds, but launching years of research and hunting for old treasures. But even though I found out that Marty Robbins had recorded \"Singing The Blues\" first, I still always favored Guy Mitchell's recording much more.\n\nIn recent years the records have given way to CDs and mp3s, and XM Radio has uncovered hundreds more to add to my lists.\n\nThanks, everyone who has contributed to the preservation of the oldies!\n\nTom VK\n\nI was living in Crailsheim, Germany. It was Christmas, 1965, when I got my first record player and my first 45s. They were \"It Ain't Me Babe\" by the Turtles on the orginal blue White Whale label. I remembered the original \"B'\" side was the fine rocker \"Almost There\". Also \"Sunshine, Lollipops & Rainbows\" by Lesley Gore, short and sweet at 1:37. I remembered the flip was a dramatic ballad \"You've Come Back\" written by Van McCoy. Another one was \"A Taste Of Honey\" by Herb Alpert. I remembered the record would skip at certain points. I remembered the flip side was a sprightly version of Anton Karas' \"The Third Man Theme\". I liked the Tijunana Brass so much that I bought the follow-up \"Zorba The Greek\" that wasÂ edited to 2:48 from a 4:26 version. In addition to the edits, there was some extra crowd noise, an overdubbed trombone towards the end, and adddtional reverb.\n\nMMarvin\n\nI remember the day of my first record buying experience very well.Â Â As a child, I lived on Staten Island, NY. Every Friday, my sister and I would take the ferry to NYC where we would go to my mother's office and my father would join us there. We'd then go to a greasy spoon for a Friday night dinner of grilled cheese sandwiches, heavy on the butter, and then travel to see my grandmother in Queens. One day, dad told us to come up early and he brought my sister and me to a Sam Goody store in lower Manhattan as a treat.Â I was 11 and I was allowed to choose a 45 to play on our new phonograph. What a decision! I loved Rock and Roll and 1958 was a great year for it! I finally chose âAll I Have to Do Is Dreamâ by The Everly Brothers. They became one of my favorites and I eventually owned all of their 45s ... until I came home from work one day and found my niece had destroyed many of them by using them as frisbees while her indulgent grandfather looked on. Now that I have grandchildren of my own, I understand ... but I sure didn't then!\n\nLiz Nilsen\n\nAs a young man of 11 years old, my very first 45 rpm purchased was The Marcels, \"BLUE MOON\".Â I loved the record.Â The booming bass voice of Freddy Johnson.Â Having that record was the bug that bit me.Â I had to have more.Â And more.Â When the Beatles arrived, the album bug bit me as well.Â I was on my way to cluttering my house with vinyl.Â What a sweet virus that is.Â And 18 years ago, the biggest bug bit me.Â CAMEO PARKWAY records.Â I boast of my collection of 45s and LPs.Â www.vinylphilly.squarepins.org\n\nI was did get to see the Marcels perform in East Rutherford but with no originals.Â But in 2001, at the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in Sharon PA, outside of Pittsburgh, I met Freddy Johnson, the Marcels bass singer.Â Oh man, I was in heaven.Â Blue Moon, my first 45.\n\nVinyl Philly Dave\n\nHi Kent !\n\nThis is a strange story, but true!\n\nI was reading stuff from My First 45's on your websiteÂ and was thinking of mine at the time, Hey Little Cobra, and for the life of me, I couldn't remember the group.\n\nThen all of a sudden, I saw at the end of the letter, that I'm reading a letter by Mitch Schecter. From the Rip Chords. I was blown away ! Thought you might like to know. Keep up the good work.\n\nMark\n\nThe first 45 I received was the Elvis - Too Much, but the first one I bought was at Hested's (like Woolworth) in Aurora, Colorado. It was Little Girl by Ritchie Valens. It was on the Del-Fi label, but it was an all gold label with Valens Memorial Series scrolled across the top. I still have it, but it doesn't play too well. I've since got it on mp3 ... a great copy, too!\n\njoe\n\nÂ\n\nkent ...\n\ni was seven, maybe eight years old when my mom took me to about seven record stores before we finally got \"bo diddley\" by the man himself, elias mcdaniel ... i had no idea - i'm not sure any white people did - what bo meant when he sang \"mother asked mojo where you been ... up to your house and i'm goin' again ...Â i must have played that\n\nwax 10,000 times ...\n\ni still get chills every time i hear the track ...Â\n\nby the way, i suggest that all your disciples log on to youtube and type in chuck berry and bo diddley ... it shows the two titans together on stage at an oldies show in madison square garden back in 1972 ... bo appears far more comfortable than chuck.\n\nchet coppock\n\nwls radio\n\nchetcoppock.com\n\nKent,\n\nThe first 45 I bought was \"My True Story\" by the Jive Five, in 1961. It's still one of my favorite records. My dad made a deal with me - \"You don't play that record again tonight and I won't fashion your teeth into flying Chicklets!\" I must've played it a hundred times in a row. The sound of those voices mesmerized me. Now, my sister was two years older so I was proficient at wearing out HER Elvis, Buddy Holly and Doo wop 45's but that was the first one I forked over MY spondulicks for! Still a bargain at any price!Â\n\nTo the best of my recollection, the second and third singles were \"Barbara Ann\" and \"Runaround\" by the Regents on Gee Records. After that, the floodgates opened and every penny I got in allowance went for new 45's and scratched up ones from garage sales. I still have most if not all of them! Though it was an LP, the record I remember playing more than any other in my youth was \"Elvis' Greatest Hits, Volume One.\" It's still my favorite, although \"The Sun Sessions\" pulls ahead from time to time!Â Â\n\nHenry Gross\n\nUsed to be a place (ah, how many people have used that phrase) in Portland, Oregon called Al's records.Â The entire center of the relatively small store contained the 45's racks - what he didn't have, he'd order for you, but he usually had the top hits; this was before a formal Top Forty.Â I toddled in at the tender age of seven, laid down my quarter and bought Robert Mitchum's Ballad of Thunder Road.Â Shortly thereafter, I did the same thing and bought Elvis Presley's Rock-A-Hula Baby.Â I still have them, some 51 years later.\n\nCheers,\n\nIain McLennon\n\nPortland, OR\n\nI have several 45's myself. My very first 45's were bought for me by my boyfriend ( who later became my husband ) when we were going out:Â The Diary by Neil Sedaka and You Are My Destiny by Paul Anka.Â Â We living in Chicago at the time and the music was jumping!Â\n\nClaire Rivas of Janesville, Wi.\n\nI remember when I was 11 or 12 years old and receivedÂ ten cents a weekÂ for allowance and tried saving every penny I could to buy a 45.Â My first 45 was a Beatles record, Twist And Shout, which I played over and over till it could not play anymore.Â My girlfriends would come over to our house and we would make guitars from cardboard with a ruler and play these 45's.Â It was awesome.Â We would then make a little theater with chairs and have parents and family come and watch us perform as the Beatles.\n\nThen the Herman's Hermits came out andÂ at that time I was finding odd jobs to try and make more money to buy more 45's.Â My family did not have a lot of money but trying to find odd jobs and makingÂ ten cents a week for allowance made me appreciate more whatÂ I had bought.Â After the Beatles, I started to buy Herman's Hermits 45's records ... Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter, I'm Henry the Eighth, I AmÂ and I'm Leaning on the Lampost, which was my favorite at the time.Â I still have those 45's hanging on the wall with all my other Herman's Hermits things and thingsÂ I have collected from the 60'sÂ on my walls, which is so cool . WhenÂ I go into the room it sure brings back good memories.\n\nThanks for letting us share the good days.\n\nTerry Williams\n\nMy first 45 was Green Onions by Booker T. and the MG's.Â I did not buy it.Â It was a test record used by a local radio and tv repair shop.Â My father began working at the repair shop back in 1963.Â Every time they would repair a record player they would use the Booker T 45 to test and make sure everything sounded right.Â One day I was at the shop and Mr Pinkney, the owner, got sick of hearing it and tossed it in the trash can.Â I told him I liked itÂ and wanted that 45.Â He replied, \"You can have it, but keep it out of thisÂ %$##@Â shop.\"Â I brought it home and it hangs on the wall of my record room to this day.Â The first 45 I bought was Surf City by Jan and Dean.Â It was from the local soda fountian.Â They sold 45s they pulled off the jukebox for 25 cents.Â I was hooked.Â Every week or so I would check the box and something good would be there.Â Early 45sÂ I bought from \"the box\" were Suspicion by Terry Stafford, Do You Love Me by Dave Clark Five, Please Please Me by the BeatlesÂ It's All Over Now by the Rolling StonesÂ and She's the One by the Chartbusters.Â That's been well over 40 years now, and 70, 000 records later, I still collect 45s.Â\n\nPhilÂ Shoemaker\n\nHello,\n\nMy very first 45 record purchase was 16 Candles by the Crests. (Lead singer Johnny Maestro passed away this year, 2010).Â It was 1959 and my girlfriend in Chattanooga was turning 16, and for her birthday I bought her the record 16 Candles by the Crests.Â I remember how mature I felt going into a record store for the first timeÂ to makeÂ that purchase.Â Shortly after her birthday, I moved from Chattanooga to Indianapolis and we lost touch. But in 2003 we found each other online. Realizing that we will be life long friends, we continue to correspond, andÂ my wife and I have visited with her and her husband. And of course, for her 61st birthday I bought her a 45 record of 16 Candles by the Crests. As a side note, I'm a big fan of music harmony that is often referred to as doo wop, and suppose that even as a 16 year old kid back in 1959, I enjoyed R & B / doo wopÂ harmony.\n\nJames Lewis\n\nMy first love lived out of state. He mailed me a dollar bill with a note asking me to go to the \"record store\" and purchase \"Baby I Love You\" by Andy Kim. I had never heard it, but he wanted it to be \"our song\". I begged my sister to drive me since I wasn't old enough! When we got home I played it for hours! To this day when I hear it on the radio all those wonderful feelings come rushing back!\n\nPATTI PAVIS\n\nMy very first 45 was Come Softly by the Fleetwoods, I actually bought it for my sister'sÂ birthday. My nextÂ 45 was Alley Oop by the Hollywood Argyles.Â Â Then I bought a 45 for the song Nutcracker it was most all piano but can not remember the group ... I think it was Paul Revere and the Raiders. Then Palasades Park Freddy \"BOOM BOOM\" Cannon.\n\nFrank De Priest\n\nLong before anyone ever heard of Gurnee, Illinois, outside Lake County ...Â long before anyone thought of Great America or Gurnee Mills ...Â my sister worked for the \"famous\" Big Gurnee Discount Store. One day my mom was picking sis up from workÂ and she told me I could buy a record with my hard earned lawn mowing money.Â Â I pored through the recordsÂ and found \"The Letter.\"\n\nI got it home and put it on ...Â and I was really shocked to hear Joe Cocker!\n\nI was probably 9 - how did I know I anyone other than The Box Tops did that song? But, in the end, I got to love Cocker's cover version. I still smile when I hear it and think of how dumb I was.\n\nKeith Johnson\n\nThe first record thatÂ I ever bought was Maybelline by Chuck Berry on 78 rpm. I probably heard it on Porky Chedwick's show on WAMO, as few otherÂ disc jockeys were playing Black music in Pittsburgh in 1955.Â My parents only had a 78 player andÂ rock and roll and rhythm and bluesÂ became increasingly hard to find on 78s. Whenever I said that we needed a 45 player, my Dad would say \"buy it on a 78\". Finally, I had to take my Dad with me to a record store so that he could see that they were no longerÂ releasing many songsÂ on 78, so that he would agree toÂ buy our familyÂ a 45/33 rpmÂ player. However, as a result of his procrastination, today I have an extensive collection of early rock and roll on 78 rpm.\n\nEd Salamon\n\nMy first 45 that I purchased with my own money was \"Hurts So Good\" by John Cougar.Â I bought it at Target in New Albany, IN, for 99 cents and still have the picture sleeve with the price tag on it.Â That's recent for some people but sure makes me feel old.Â I was 11 at the time.Â Since then I've amassed over 3,000 45's from 1951 through 2003.Â\n\nI continued to buy new music that I liked on 45 whenever I could but it is nigh on impossible now to find much on 45 although some of the new \"underground\" artists still release 45's which I think is cool since my jukebox holds 100 45's and I like to rotate them every month or so.\n\nNothing sounds as good as vinyl and nothing ever will for me.\n\nChad from New Albany, IN.\n\nMy first record was Tom Dooley by the Kingston Trio. I was only about 7 at the time and originally had the 78.Â I remember it clearly though because I put it on the chair one day and my dad sat on it and broke it. Â I cried so much that to shut me up, my mum made him go out to buy another copy and he came home with the 45.\n\nThe B side was Ruby Red, another great song which I finally found on CD about two years ago. The first record I actually bought myself was Let's Jump The Broomstick by Brenda Lee. I was lucky enough to meet Brenda on my first visit to the States in 2006 and was surprised to learn that although the song was a big hit in England, it did nothing in the U.S. Most of the 45s I bought later are long gone, but I still have these two and whenever I hear them they remind me of the days when music actually meant something\n\nCheers\n\nNick Gordon\n\nKent;\n\nJune 1963, grade 8 graduation dance.Â I'd never been at any dance prior toÂ this night,\n\nbut always wanted to.Â\n\nOn a dance floo\n\nr, two gals could fast dance together, but NOT TWO GUYS.Â There was roller skating at the area, butÂ I didnt know that yet. I had to be content with ice skating to the pop stuff, Oct throughÂ April or May.\n\nHARD to ice skate and \"DANCE\" at same time.Â WAITED for Elvis and RETURN TO SENDER.\n\nGrade 8 graduation,Â turns out the chaperone, well, I think everyone knew her, butÂ I knew her a tad better because I'd hang out with her younger brother occassionally.Â She brought a stack of 45s.\n\nThe SOUND(???) SYSTEM ...Â Put a small record player at edge of theÂ stage and a mic in front of it.\n\nWent through her 45s and saidÂ \"You don't have any ELVIS stuff. \"\n\nOur house was a five minute walk from the high school soÂ I went over and gotÂ the ONLY 45 I had ...\n\nGood Luck Charm.Â For gaduating grade 8 was given $4 or $5.Â First LP???Â Elvis Golden Records. Wasnt listed as Vol 1 because RCA had noooo idea as to where he'd go after 1959.\n\nSoooo anyway, after a few songs, the gal put on Good Luck Charm.\n\nCanNOT recall how the situation took place, butÂ she came down on the floor levelÂ andÂ the FIRST gal I ever danced with (we did the twist) was the chaperon!\n\nRobert BlackÂ of Willowdale CANADA\n\nI was in fourth grade - there was a school carnival - and I think I won a prize by throwing a basketball into a hoopÂ or something like that. Â Anyway, the prize was a promotional copy (mono on one side and stereo on the other) of \"Lay Lady Lay\". Being the oldest and in fourth grade, I really wasn't sure about what the song was about, but I played it anyway.\n\nkip wahlers\n\nIâm only 43 now, born in â68, but have been an oldies music buff since I was about 15.Â However, the first 45 I bought was in 1981 and was a BIG pop #1 song.\n\nI still have it and itâs in pristine condition: CENTERFOLD by J. Giles Band b/w RAGE IN THE CAGE.Â I bought it at Speedyâs Record Shop on 6th and Hamilton Sts in downtown Allentown, PA.Â What a great place to get music (they moved about 20 years ago, but closed about 5 years ago). I was given $5 bucks a week allowance then and I would go into town every Saturday and buyÂ one 45, see a movie and get a Frosty from Wendyâs and still have a little change.Â Life was good then.Â The Centerfold 45 was interesting to me because it was on a pink and black label with a handprint logo at top, disturbed by EMI America. Â Being new to record collecting I was eager to see what other labels did.Â The following week I bought PRIVATE EYES by Hall and Oates, which has Nipper on the front.Â My dad told me about âHis Masterâs Voiceâ tagging which by then had been stopped.Â From then on I was hooked.Â I would have listening parties at my house because no one else would spend their money on records.Â\n\nI collected for about 25 years and stopped a couple of years ago at about 6K 45âs.Â Now Iâve switched to collecting a more expensive hobby: game worn baseball jerseys.Â Let me tell you, you canât get a game worn jersey for a buck-forty-nine!\n\nItâs ok to look back to the past â¦ but donât try to live in it!\n\nDave Z\n\nAlburtis, PAÂ Â\n\nIn 1957 I was 12 years old and starting to pay attention to the songs on the radio. My favorite was Black Slacks by Joe Bennett & The Sparkletones. One Saturday I went with my grandmother to the A&P to help her grocery shop. I saw a display of 45s in one corner and had to look at them. I found Black Slacks and bought it.\n\nKris\n\nIn 1959, I bought my first 45, Guitar Boogie Shuffle, by the Virtues, on the Hunt label. Curiously it was my grandmother who turned me on to the song. We used to sit in her kitchen in the early morning and listen to the radio. Grandma always listened to KQV, AM 1410, in Pittsburgh. When they played that record she always said she liked it. So I returned every empty soda bottle I could find for the deposit -- I scoured the neighborhood -- scraped together the money and bought the record from the record department of the Pittsburgh Merchantile department store. I think I paid 49 cents for it -- approximately 25 returned bottles! That very record is still in my collection. It also was the start of a long relationship with the 45, which continues to this day. As a followup, in later years I had the good furtune to meet and become friends with jazz guitarist, Jimmy Bruno, who's father, Jimmy, was the lead guitarist for the Virtues and played the lead on that record.\n\n-- Joe Nez, Pittsburgh, PA\n\nMy first record was Paul McCartney and Wings' \"Live And Let Die\".Â\n\nI bought the 45 with my babysitting money for 99-cents.Â\n\nI remember that Paul and Linda were both rocking these really cool shag haircuts on the cover.Â I finally had long hair myself in college, but then I quickly grew this bald spot and it ruined my dream!\n\nRyan Murphy (\"Glee\")\n\nÂ\n\nMy first 45 was Robot Man by Jamie Horton, in about 1958 or â59.Â She had another record âMy Little Marineâ after that.\n\nMy second 45 is one that Iâve been trying to figure out for years now.Â I can remember a light-blue label, and the song had something to do with a soldier sitting under a tree reading a letter.Â Or maybe it was a girl sitting under a tree reading a letter from her soldier boyfriend.Â Not sure, but Iâd love to know what it was.\n\nLike many others on your site, I gotÂ a 25-cent allowance back then ...Â and 45s were 50 cents ...Â so I had to save up for two weeks and then buy a record I just âhad to haveâ.Â Never a week went buy that I didnât have a favorite song that played on WCFL or WLS.Â âItsy Bitsy ...â was one of those, as was Del Shannonâs âRunawayâ.Â I still have most of those 45s although I canât vouch for what shape theyâre in.\n\nKathy Reilly\n\nRediscover Music\n\nÂ\n\nI lived in the suburbs of Philly from the early 50s through the present.\n\nÂ\n\nSince Bill Haley was then going from country and western to sort of a rockabilly - rock ân roll sound and lived in Chester, PA, I had some early recordings of him on the Essex label such as âDim Dim The Lightsâ and âThe Saints Rock and Roll.âÂ By the time he signed with Decca, a âBâ side of a single received play in the movie âBlackboard Jungleâ and it all broke loose with that tune, âRock Around The Clock.â\n\nLater that year (â55) I bought âThe Great Pretenderâ by the Platters and away I went. My first summer job was at a small town swimming pool and amusement park / roller skating / bowling alley combination facility.Â The first weekâs pay bought me a â45â record player and every check thereafter sent me to the local record store for some more of that good time rnr.Â I played a little drums and guitar for a local rock and roll band in the late 50sÂ / early 60s.Â For a while I taught a course, âRock and Roll Up To The Beatlesâ at a local high school evening course.\n\nÂ\n\nI now have 14,000 songs in my iTunes collection and love to make CDs for friends / acquaintances, high school reunions, etc. â for free.Â Every year or so I try to find a Philly area musician who recorded back in the dayÂ and I take him / her out to lunch and I take notes of our conversation.\n\nÂ\n\nTom Moore\n\nÂ\n\nMy first record when I was 5 yrs old was He's So Fine by the Chiffons. My parents bought me a record player and I used to watch the red and white 45 go round and round and then play it again.\n\nAlthough the song isn't really ever forgotten I just haven't heard it in many years. Appreciate you playing it again.\n\nDaniel Viscarde\n\nÂ\n\nHi -\n\nFirst 45 IÂ bought was \"Space Race\" by Billy Preston ...Â purchased it at an Alco Store in Concordia, Kansas, for 75 cents back in 1973.\n\nThe second and third 45's were purchased for the same price at the same location later in the year 1973,Â on the same day:Â\n\nJust You 'N' Me by Chicago and Helen Wheels by Paul McCartney.Â It was a blast to look through the new 45's, and there were usually a few of each ... and you would make sure you picked out the prime ones.\n\nDouglas Rhine - 2011\n\nÂ\n\nThe first 45 I bought was Stevie WonderâsÂ \"Hey Loveâ.Â (Wonder later would write âTell Me Something Good,âÂ our first hitÂ for the band Rufus.)Â Then the first album I ever bought was Led Zeppelinâs first album in high school. Iâm a big rock ânâ roller. If you look at early Rufus, thatâs what we were doing.\n\nChaka Khan\n\nÂ\n\nI started buying all the records by Alvin and the Chipmunks in the earlyÂ 1960's, along with \"Hello Muddah,Hello Faddah\" by Allen Sherman. Then the Beatles hit when I was 14, and I had to buy all their singles (starting with \"She Loves You\"), then all the Dave Clark 5 singles.\n\nFinally I had to stop buying baseball cards and comic books so I could buy more records. Starting in January 1965, I would go downtown every Saturday and buy three or four 45's, starting with This Diamond Ring, You've Lost That Lovin Feelin, Keep Searchin and Tell Her No.Â I didnt stop until I had over 7,000 45's and they stopped making them.\n\nFred\n\nThe very first record I ever bought was a 78rpm of Freddy's \"Way Down Yonder In New Orleans\" in early 1960.Â I told Freddy that when I interviewed him years ago, and he was amazed.Â He didn't know it had been released on 78.Â Canada was a few years behind the U.S. then.Â It was on the Quality label here in Canada and unfortunately, it's been lost over time.Â I had an Aunt and Uncle living in Easton, Pennsylvania at the time and that summer, my family travelled down to visit them.Â My dad took me to a local record store (possibly it was in Philadelphia) where I bought my 2nd record ever - a Cameo Records 45 of Bobby Rydells' \"Volare\" in a red picture sleeve with a head shot of Bobby on the cover (that one I still have).Â\n\nDoug Thompson\n\nCanada\n\nYou've got to understand, my first record was \"Martian Hop\", I loved the Four Seasons and, in 1964, I became a Beatle fanatic. Elvis Presley was for old farts, even when he came back.\n\nBob Lefsetz\n\nFirst 45 was Good Luck Charm and First LPÂ Elvis Gold Records. (1958)\n\nRobert Black\n\nÂ\n\nIn 6th grade, in 1962, I had a crush on a girl name Donna. Â For \"share and tell day\", she brought in a 45 of Dion's The Wanderer. Â I loved the song, wanted that record. Â Donna and the song were a potent combo. Â But, I had to wait for the 45, since it was on back order at the only store selling 45s in our small town. Â So, the first 45 I took home was \"My Boomerang Won't Come Back\" by Charlie Drake. (the chorus swings ala Louis Prima).\n\nIn 1996 I bought a jukebox, and ordered more 45s to add to my collection ... including a copy of \"Boomerang.\" Â (I had traded my copy away in '65),Â When I received the new copy, Â I realized that there were two versions of Boomerang, as the original was deemed too controversial for radio. Â The edited radio version was politically correct with certain word changes.\n\nI've always loved Dion, he still sounds great! Â Donna is long gone, and she was never a prima-donna!\n\nBilly F.\n\nÂ\n\nKent:\n\nThe first 45 rpm that I ever owned was Johnny Ray singing \"The Little White Cloud That Cried\".\n\nThen my mom bought for herself (which I eventually got)Â Eddie Fisher ... and lots of them.\n\nDJ Stu Weiss\n\nÂ\n\nThe first 45 RPM record I ever owned was one I had stolen at Big Apple Supermarket in Atlanta, GA. It was called âI Ran All The Way Homeâ by the Impalas.Â This was fall of 1959.Â The first legit 45 I ever owned was given to me for a birthday gift âBlue Velvetâ by Bobby Vinton.\n\nBob Jones\n\nÂ\n\nMy first 45 was Dizzy by Tommy Roe. I remember seeing him on American Bandstand performing it (the lip sync version), and I used to play it non-stop.\n\nI recall some others from that era. My cousin's first was a song\n\ncalled Israelites by Desmond Dekker. A refugee from eastern Europe who was living with us bought Spill the wine by Eric Burden and War and In the Year 2525 by Zaeger and Evans. I see Dennis Zaeger sells custom guitars these days. Nice stuff. He used to play them non-stop along with When I'm 64 by the Beatles.\n\nStephen Apple\n\nÂ\n\nMy first record player was a 78 r.p.m. kiddy model with an old-fashioned diaphragm attached to the tone arm, which acted as a speaker.Â The thing was virtually indestructible and could have easily doubled as a murder weapon.Â It had steel needles that looked like carpenter's nails and always seemed to need replacing after every fifth spin.Â\n\nMy record collection was an odd assortment of \"Little Golden Records\" for kids interspersed with the pop hits of the day I heard on the radio.Â I had collected everything from Sammy Kaye to Yosemite Sam.Â My poor folks were forced to listen to an endless loop of \"Mona Lisa\", \"Mule Train\" and \"The Three Billy Goats Gruff.\"\n\n-- Tommy James\n\nÂ\n\nWow ... what a great website!\n\nMy first 45 was \"Mack the Knife\" by Bobby Darin, bought in early 1959. I was in 5th grade at Washington Elementary School in Whittier, Calif. My teacher (Mr. Bradford) was teaching the class the Swing step. WOW ... we (guys) actually danced with girls!!! I really enjoyed the class. He played the Bobby Darin record every time we had dance-class (twice weekly) so, I really got to like the song. When I brought home the record my dad said \"Oh, that's a gory song\". I didn't understand what he meant then because I really didn't listen to the words ... just the beat.\n\nThanks Kent for the memories : )\n\nTom Creed\n\nÂ\n\nI remember buying that FIRST 45 with my own money like it was yesterday.\n\nI got my very first job delivering papers on my bike every day after school. When it was time to get paid, I rode that bicycle down to the \"Record Land\" store on the main street of our city. The song I had heard a number of times on my transistor as I delivered those papers. It was \"Sherry\" by the Four Seasons. After that I was at the record store every week buying all the latest songs I heard on the radio. It was the beginning of a life-long love affair with 1960's rock & roll.\n\nRick McCaffrey - Poughkeepsie, NY\n\nFast Forward about forty years or maybe a few more. I'm sitting in Winnipeg with Freddy Cannon and he's telling me right at our table about how he \"almost\" went out for dinner with Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran (they were all touring Europe together) the night of the accident that took Eddie and basically crippled Gene. Remarkable. Freddy Cannon ... one of the most humble, real, rock and roll legends I've ever met.Â\n\n-- Burton Cummings\n\nI was born in Chicago.Â Â My rock 'n' roll world opened when I was 10 and a half.Â My family was not an Ed Sullivan family, we watched Steve Allen, and I'm a better person for it. Allen was sidesplitting, spontaneously, intelligently funny (and from Chicago!). But this night, January 7th, 1957, we had Sullivan on for some reason, and there was Elvis Presley. It was the turning point of my life. When people say he is a deity, you don't hear any laughter from me. The sudden appearance of this creature was like what other people get from LSD: it opened another universe.Â\n\nMy habits changed immediately. I had been buying stamps, a dollar a week's worth, from a hobby shop which, ironically, had begun carrying records (78s) to supplement the meager stamp business. The second Friday in January, I pointed back to records instead of staring down at stamps. \"I'll take that,\" I said, meaning Elvis' \"Too Much,\" which he'd sung on Sullivan. I detected disapproval from the philatelist: I was joining the enemy. When he first started stocking records, my dad asked him what kind of people bought them and he rolled his eyes. Of course, I liked that too: it was my first step on becoming a juvenile delinquent. I say first step, but I never got any further, though I carried a knife.Â\n\n\"Too Much\" was a disappointment: I liked it better when he sang it on TV. But I persevered. The next record that caught my attention was one I heard riding north on Lake Shore Drive in my parents' car. I was hooked by the guitar, then mesmerized by the drum and cowbell. It was James Burton's lead on Dale Hawkins' \"Suzie Q.\"Â\n\nMy first album was a disappointment-Â RickyÂ on Imperial. It was softened rockabilly, not sharp-edged like Dale Hawkins. The version of \"Be-Bop Baby,\" which I already had on a single, was even lame - they had used an alternative, weak take! My parents, who had paid $4 for it, were upset by my reaction, saying I should be careful what I asked forâ¦ as if I could know what the hell was on an album! But we were lower middle-class: dad worked at a printing place, mom in an office, so there were few dollars to throw around.Â By June 1957, I was ready to go to a rock 'n' roll show. My mom took me. It was the Howard Miller extravaganza at the Chicago Opera House. For my first live music, I saw Chuck Berry, Little Brenda Lee, Tab Hunter, Charlie Grace, the Everly Brothers and several more, including the ultra-square Dan Belloc Orchestra, and the always-trying Nick Noble, a balladeer (he was one of the preceding generation). Chuck duckwalked, the girls screamed for Tab (mistakenly, as time would tell), the Everlys did two songs, and I had a ball.\n\nArt Fein\n\nMy first purchased 45âs was in Coffeyville, Kansas, over Christmas vacation of 1960.\n\nI had two bucks to my name and walked downtown to âThe Music Boxâ to buy two recordsÂ for my new Christmas gift record player. After listening to several âTop-40â records in the record booth (remember the record listening booths ?), I bought âFools Rush Inâ by Brook Benton andÂ âRubber Ballâ by Bobby Vee. That began my life long record collection that has grown to over 3000 today.\n\nThereâs something magic about listening to records, that you just donât get with cassettes, dvdâs or I-tunes. Itâs a nostalgia I canât explain.\n\nThanxÂ Â Â Â Â Â\n\nLarry Teshï»¿ï»¿\n\nI have to tell you that your website brought tears to my eyes last week.Â I came across your First 45's feature for the very first time ... and memories came rushing back to me about my Mom ... who used to tell us whenever \"Happy Together\" by The Turtles came on the radio that this was the very first record she ever bought.Â She would make all of us kids listen to it and sing along ... and a look of absolute joy would show on her face.Â Mom's been gone for a while now ... and I haven't revisited that memory in a long, long time ... but last week you brought it all back.Â (I couldn't have been more than 6 or 7 at the time.)Â And then when I saw that you were going to see The Turtles in concert over the weekend it made me smile and wish that my mom could have seen it, too.Â Thank you for making me remember something that otherwise may have stayed long forgotten.Â It's what we would call \"a good cry\". (Maureen)\n\nÂ\n\nMy first memory of a 45 was the Crystals Then He Kissed Me.Â I was walking through one of the department stores in Victoria as a young girl and they were playing this live TV show American Bandstand and the Crystals were performing.Â I fell in love with the song and went and bought the 45 the same day.Â Had to borrow the money from my Mom to do it to.Â\n\nI still have a number of old 45âs and 33âs and just gave away a bunch at a garage sale.Â Shame but at least the guy really wanted them.\n\nLennie McDonald\n\nI'd received several as gifts, but the first I bought was \"Shapes of Things\" by the Yardbirds, featuring Jeff Beck. Each Christmas, in mid 60s, I received the newest Beatles' LP ...Â BEATLES '65, RUBBER SOUL. After that my biggest expansion into record collecting occurred in the Fall of '67 when I joined the Columbia Record Club; the come-on was GREAT; 13 LPS for a penny, then purchase 12 for $3.99 per album (to the best of my recollection). I was beside myself ... some of my favorite 60s records came from that CRC selection. Thank you for the memories!!!!\n\nFrank Carmack\n\nI just discovered your site.\n\nMy first two 45's were A SUMMER PLACE and EBB TIDE.\n\nBarbara Mandelï»¿ï»¿\n\nï»¿\n\nThe first 45 I bought was an instrumental called \"Scratchy\" by Travis Wammack.Â I first heard it on a jukebox in a little hamburger place in Charlotte around 1964.Â I wore that record out!Â The first LP I bought was Telstar by the Ventures in 1965.Â I earned the money to buy that album by painting the outside of our house.Â Since those days, I now have more than 10,000 albums, more than 2000 45's, and I don't know how many collectable 8-tracks (many sealed), cassettes, and even CDs.Â I have many 78's and also some Edison 1/4\" thick discs.Â Just for kicks and giggles, I just had to have an Edison cylinder (with cardboard tube) and a 16\" V disc.Â I think I have all formats and I have came to the conclusion that ( to me ), the BEST sound comes from a 45 that is in good condition!Â\n\nHooked on vinyl!Â\n\nDoug VentersÂ\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBeing an Oldie myself (67), I have amassed an original 45 collection of over 600 from between 1955 and 1962. Unfortunately, I canât remember the 1st one I bought as a kid.\n\nI do remember the first LP albums that I bought, though. The Everly Brothers' Best, and Have Twangy Guitar, Will Travel, by Duane Eddy. Proud to say I still have them both.\n\nOur generation is fading and it is up to us to preserve this truly unique period of American musical history. Long may it live!!Â\n\n-Larry, aka Oldies Nut\n\nGrowing up during the late 50's and 60's as I did, all of my memories are encapsulated within the music of the time. The best music ever! Our family never sat down to dinner without the console stereo playing music in the background. All kinds of music ...Â folk, instrumental, rock and roll, big band, and male and female singers of the day. There was never a holiday or birthday on which we did not give or were given music in some glorious form. I can remember receiving \"Meet The Beatles\" and the joy that I felt holding that album in my hands. Â\n\nMy first 45 was Eydie Gorme singing \"Blame It On The Bossa Nova. I had gotten a particularly good report card and the gift of the 45 was slipped under my bedroom door by our older sister. I will never forget that day!\n\nAugust Moon\n\nï»¿\n\nMy first 45 was \"Stand\" by Sly & The Family Stone.Â I bought it at K-Mart with my mother andÂ six of my brothers and sisters when we went school clothes shopping.Â I still remember that it cost 79 cents.Â I bought it to play on my new Close 'n' Play (remember those?) that I had gotten for my 7th birthday.Â My little brother and sister and I would stand every time they sang \"Stand!\".Â LOLÂ Â That was my great choreography.Â We were so dorky.Â\n\nDanny Seib\n\nSyracuse, NY\n\nI am reminded of the first four records I ever bought as a kid. Really can't remember which was first, second, third, or fourth,Â ï»¿but Joe Bennett and the Sparkletones' BLACK SLACKS was one of them. I drove my parents crazy playing that record over and over on my record player in my bedroom. The other three were MOONLIGHT GAMBLER by Frankie Laine, WHITE SILVER SANDS by Don Rondo AND I DREAMED by Betty Johnson. One of Joe Bennett's followups was a song called COTTEN PICKIN' ROCKER (FROM WAY BACK). As a kid, I always referred to that song as the \"hiccup song\". For those of your readers who might be familiar with it, they will know what I'm talking about. Â\n\nLarry Neal\n\nIt was âThe Real Elvis,â an RCA Victor EP (extended play) with four songs â¦\n\nâDonât Be Cruel,â âHound Dog,â âI Want You I Need You I Love Youâ and\n\nâMy Baby Left Me.âÂ Â It was 1957 and I bought it in Inglewood, CA.Â Played it over and over.Â\n\nDavid Kleinbart\n\nNorthridge, CA\n\nI can't remember the first 45s I bought. I was still in grade school in the early 60s, and thanks to the influence of my older sister I loved to listen to the radio. Back then, off the charts hit records could be bought for next to nothing. They were sold 3/$1 at many stores, and I amassed a huge collection of records which I recently donated. I wanted to be a DJ like the ones I heard on the radio. Music always has been a very important element in my life. Now in my 60s, I still listen to oldies on the radio or streaming on Pandora.\n\nThanks for the memories!\n\nAndy the wannabe DJ who never came to he.\n\n(\\__/)\n\n(='.'=)\n\n(\")_(\")ï»¿ï»¿\n\nThe first 45 I remember buying as a kid was The Unicorn by the Irish Rovers. I 'lost' the 45 years ago but have the song thanks to itunes.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe Cantello\n\nRoswell, Ga\n\nThe first 45s I ever owned were \"Reet Petite\" by Jackie Wilson and \"At The Hop\" by Danny and the Juniors.\n\n-- Elton John\n\nHi, Kent.\n\nWith all my thousands of 45's in my basement, I admit it was hard to pick the first one.Â But then I noted 'With my own money' and it came to me.\n\nI discovered that the ACME Market, two blocks from my house, sold 45's for 69 cents!\n\nMy early love of John Sebastian and the Lovin' Spoonful resulted in my first purchase, \"Do You Believe in Magic\", and the paint splashed label only helped in my adoration.Â (Hey, just like the spinning paint pictures I used to love making on the boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ.)\n\nAs years passed, I bought every single and every cover and every album the Spoonful produced.Â This included all of John Sebastian's solo records, also.\n\nI started a fan club and used all the letters in the words 'Lovin' Spoonful' to make a heartfelt saying to go along with the club mailings.\n\nI finally got to see Sebastian at Bucknell University in the '70's from about 10 feet away.Â Oh, Lord, was that thrilling!\n\nStill love their music!\n\nJust ask my cd player.\n\nOwen Mahon\n\nLewisburg, PA\n\nIn April, 1955, I bought my first record ... a single by Perez Prado called \"Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White.\"Â When I played it, I was transported for a fwe minutes to glamorous movie sets inhabited by femmes fatales and white dinner-jacketed could- be-villains.\n\nAndrew Loog Oldham\n\nThe first record I ever bought was Gene Vincentâs âBe-Bop-A-Lulaâ on the Capitol label.\n\nPaul McCartney"
