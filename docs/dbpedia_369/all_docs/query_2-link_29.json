        "text": "Jerry G., Hi, and welcome, to this Site !!!!! Don Boyd, is The Founder, The Curator, The President, And The Absolute Last Word, on This--, His Site, But I, as A Regular Contributor, on This Site, I Welcome you, To our Dicussions, about Old Hialeah Memories, and That Said, Down To Business !!!! It Sounds, as if you Lived; Off S. E. 6th Avenue, and just south of Hialeah Drive. I Lived at ; 1000 East 6th Lane, up north from you, Right next to Hialeah Lanes Bowling Alley. I used to Go to The Essex Theatre, also, for a Quarter, for all Day, and Remember The Machines, in The Lobby, for Hard Candy coated Peanuts, & Ice Cream Bars ? We used to Get a Handful of those Peanuts Candies out of the Machine, and throw them at the screen. Those were The Days !!!! I'll Bet you went Skating at Rustic Roller Rink, Like I Did !!!!! I Loved that Place, and went there, a Lot. And You Probably, went to My Elementary School,- Hialeah Elementary, By The Burger King, and The Candy Store. They werte Both, Right off of E. 6th Ave, and 9th Street. I Am 57 years old Now, Born in 1951. I Lived there, from 1951 To 1964, and then we moved, to North west Hialeah, near Miami Lakes. I went to Miami Springs JR. High, 1/2 of the 7th Grade, and then we Moved, to our New Neighborhood, and I Transferred into Palm Springs JR. High. I Remember ; DR. Bowles, That Fat, Waddling Sarcastic, Arrogant S. O. B. In My Book, He was A Major A. Hole. I Hated That Man !!!! I Know He was A Great Teacher, and one of the Highest Paid, at the Time, But Regardless, I Couldn't Stand That Fatso !!!!!! He would, and Did, Give you an F, or a o, for a Little Of Nothing, He was Ridiculously Strict, and Heartless, and Called us My Little Chums, all the Time. The Best Thing about Him, for Me, was to see Him Drive up to the School, in His Chevy Impala, Sitting in The Back Seat, With The Steering Wheel on an Extended Pole Column, and Watching Him Waddle Like A Fat Pregnant Penquin, Down The Hallways !!!! I Got to Laugh at Him, as Revenge, For His Telling MR. Moffitt, to Give Me An F. , That Fat Miserable B------D. My Favorite Teachers there, were; Coach Mike Harrison, MR. Jarlenski, Miss Dotson, Miss Little, and MR. Tupler. Do you Remember, The Judo School, and Pan Pacifico Cuban Bakery, that were By Block Beef, on Hialeah Drive ???? I went to Both Places, Back in; From 1959 To 1963. Gotta Go !!!!! Later !!!! Robbin.Hello Don Boyd, I was reading your comment on the three section Home News 20th anniversary issue I have the same issue I beleive that they gave them to everyone for free because when we got ours we had no subscription and it came on a Thursday night to our house and all the neighbors got one also. I remember going to 7-11 on Hialeah Dr. and 6th ave. every Thursday at 9:00 P.m. thats when they delivered them to the store. Like you said the photos are great and also the advertising and all the political people are like time capsules. I went to get mine out I keep it in plastic and stored safely away, thats when my wife said it was already taken to the climate controlled storage we rented along with all my books and dye cast cars etc. We are moving to Ashville N.C. In a couple of months have been going there for 29 years now most of the family is there or is going. I like the way that the Home News anniversary issue was divided into sections of new ( for 1964 ) to the old and how it had all those great aerial photos and the shopping centers and banks etc. I have another comment about the pin-up queen Betty Page who died last night at 85 I kept forgetting to mention that she used to live in Hialeah from 1967 to 1972 she lived on west 17th st. between 1st and 2nd ave. I have the exact address in one of the three books I have about her but it is also in storage. There is a photo of her being arrested and mug shot by the Hialeah police in 1971 for domestic violence she hit her then husband with something over the head. In another book there are five pages of photos taken at funland park in the early 50s real interesting to see the old rides ,one is in front of the ticket booth I can't believe the old prices, all those pictures were taken by the famous pin-up photographer Bunny Yeager who was also a model she is on the cover of another book I have called Miami Beach memories. A couple of weeks back I mentioned a book given to me for fathers day called Curtiss Bright cities, it has quite a few pictures that I have never seen before. Gotta Go now and thanks CareyManocarz, you're right - this is now by far the busiest comments section on the site and I thank everyone for mentioning names of stores, restaurants, funeral homes, you name it, that I have forgotten about.\n\nAnd your comment about Robbin making people hungry is spot on - I get hungry every time he writes about some restaurant and how delicious whatever was. I remember Jon's Steak House at W. 9th and Red Road - it was a great place that my dad loved to take us to in the early/mid 70's. I mentioned it in my Hialeah commentary too because they had a delicious Key Lime bisque dessert that reminded me of Tyler's Restaurants Key Lime bisque - just superb and I've never found any other restaurants with Key Lime anything that good and we have eaten in many restaurants over many years. Good luck to you on your upcoming medical procedures - we're pulling for ya, you know that.\n\nSomebody refresh my memory: where exactly was Saunders Hobby Shop? I know that I bought models there in the late 50's but can't remember exactly where it was to save my soul. I bought most of my models at Schell's in the Catalina Shopping Center on Palm and 54th which was closer to my home than Saunders.\n\nSofia: I seem to remember a Three Sisters in the PS Shopping Center but can't remember if it was east or west of G. C. Murphy's.\n\nSneak preview: a gent named Fred Swick, who lived in my old neighborhood, mailed me three old Home News editions and one is their three-section 20th Anniversary issue in 1964 with scads of old Hialeah and Miami Springs photos in it. It is incredible and it will take me a while to scan everything due to other things going on right now but you won't believe it when I get them up on this site.\n\nDonWhere do I start everyone.........Except to say........its' about time this board became active,......and....the memories are great!!!!!!! Cary-Gigi: My first of what eventually became un-told hundreds of model kits was a 1962 Buick Electra model from Saunders. How I wish I still had it today...but I do have a photo of it. I have many Franklin Mint's put away, still have a few hundred model kits stored in my closet (more carz than clothes - everything being in proper prospective) and a couple hundred of the '50's and '60's Matchbox cars - many in original boxes. I also have a shelf over the computer with a couple of dozen toy carz from childhood on display. I have a couple of \"Budgie\" toy cars like the ones I use to buy at McCrory's that everyone is talking about. Thanks for taking me down the old toy carz memory lane. ROBBIN: You're making us all hungry...and I might get fat reading all of this. I would like to go to the old Ranch House on East 4th tonight! I haven't seen anyone mention the little strip plaza across from the FPL building on E. 4th Ave and about 14th St. There was a little slip Pizza place in there where an old man who I don't think spoke English made absolutely great pizza! I cannot remember the name. And did anyone ever go to Jon's Steak House at 9th/Okeechobee and Red Road? Also Robbin: About ambulances - I think Slade must have had a territory, or was somehow able to beat everyone else to the scene - not sure. I would see Randal-Eastern ambulances whenever we strayed far enough away from Slade's. Hellman's was the official ambulance of Miami Beach in the 1950's, but they advertized that they would go anywhere. I never saw a Bess ambulance, but their old ads mention that they had them and that they will go anywhere. Bess's funeral cars were Beige in the 1960's. They may have had ambulances of a different color. I never saw one. I did see a Reed-Gautier Funeral Home ambulance one night at the new theatre in Palm Springs. I was the light blue that you mentioned, but it was a Cadillac. Anyway....I'm worn out for now....and hungry! More later when there is more energy. Thanks again.Manocarz, Remember, Randle Eastern ????? I Know they were Based, on N. W. 27th Avenue, Near Flagler Street, and Miami High School, But we saw them a Lot, around My old neighborhood, when I was A Kid. Not as Much as Slade's Ambulances, but we did see them. And I saw, as a Little Kid, another Ambulance, once in a while, in East Hialeah; A White Cadillac Ambulance, which Said; Hellman's. I Don't Know where that one came from ???? Remember; Bess Memorial Chapel, in Allapattah, on 36th Street, near Orange Blossom Hobby Shop, and Miami Jackson High School ???? They Had these Big Light Blue 2 Tone Oversized Pontiacs, Very Square, in Design, and they Looked sorta Like Airport Limos !!!! I Remember someone Bought one of them, that worked at Babcock Park, I Think it was MR. Joel Tierce's Son. And Manocarz, Do you Remember The Faith Lutheran Church, on Hialeah Drive ???? I Went to Kindergarten there, when I was 5 years old, in 1956, and I used to Go to The Hialeah Church Of The Nazarene, in The 50's, which was across the street, from your South Hialeah Elementary School. Did you By any chance , Know Stanley Freeman, at South Hialeah ???? He and I Didn't Get Along too well, and we almost Fought, a few times, But never Did. I saw him at Flamingo Plaza, and in My Area, and At Miami Springs JR. High, in 7th Grade, and He and I Just Didn't Like each other's Looks, or Something. He used to Make Remarks, Passing By Me, ect., and I Still Can't Believe, That we never Had A Fist Fight, Because There was Bad Blood, Between us, always !!!!! And Do you Remember A Real Pretty Girl, at South Hialeah, named ; Celeste ??? She was Beautiful, and I always saw Her at Babcock Park, and People told Me Her 1st name, and that she went to South Hialeah Elementary. I went to Hialeah Elementary and I was always, at Babcock Park. Also, Did you Know; Darlene Mckinney, or Mckenna ???? She was Beautiful too, and I Think she went to South Hialeah, as well !!!!! She Lived up By East 15th Street, and around Just west of Palm Avenue, Maybe West 1st avenue. She was the Girlfriend, of a Friend of mine, Robert Placa, in Elementary school, and I was with him, one time, when he went to see Her. Take Care, My Friend !!!!!!! Later !!! Robbin.Eastsider, Yes, you are Correct, about Carole's, and Carole's Father, Being; Pickle Herring Charlie. I Remember the Barber Shops, and The Bowling Pro Shop, now that you mentioned them, But I Had forgotten them. My Dad always took My Younger Brother, and I, To a Barber Shop, on Palm Avenue, across the street, from Hialeah- Springs Auto Parts, and our Barber, was Leo, a nice Latin Man. I Think that Bowling Pro Shop, was owned By; Don Provenzano, if I Remember Correctly. And I Don't think the Pony Rides, were there Before the Bowling Alley, But Later on, after Hialeah Lanes opened, The Pony Rides, were there also. Believe Me, Eastsider, I ate My Share Of 29 Cent Whoppers, at That East 9th Street Burger King !!!!!! I used to Order a Whopper, French Fries, and A Chocolate Milkshake, and I would eat there, and I Felt Like The King. Remember, The Brownies, and Big Cupcakes, on The Counter, and seeing The Burger Patties, Being Flame Broiled, and Coming down The Conveyer ???? And The Mom and Pop Candy Store, across The Street ?? Those were The Days, My Friend !!!!!!! I Still Like Burger King, But The Burgers, were Much Better, There, and Then !!!!! Remember, How they Had Onions, and Pickles, ect, in a Stainless Steel Box, in The Dining Room, and Sueeze Bottles Of Ketchup, And Mustard, and Salt And Pepper Shakers , also on The Tables, and on The counter, with Round Stool Seats, in Front of the Window, facing 9th Street. And Remember, The Little Round Nash Rambler Metropolitan Company Cars, with The Burger King Home Of The Whopper Logo on the Doors ???? I Ate There, all The Time, and at Royal Castle On 9th Street, and East 10th Avenue By The Commissary, and Flamingo Plaza. Remember, also, The Huge Displays Of Model Cars, in The Front Plate Glass Windows, at Woolworth's, when They Had Model Car Contests ????? Some Of My Cars, Won Trophies, and Ribbons There !!!!!! And Remember, There at Woolworth's, in The Front, By The Plate Glass Windos, and The Registers, They Had An Ice Cream Freezer Box, That Had These Wonderful 3 Flavor Ice Cream Sandwiches, with Waffles, as The outsides of the Sandwich ????? Those were Real Good !!!!!! Best Regards, To you Sir !!!!!! Later !!!!! Robbin.Eastsider, I Remember The Pony Rides, very well, I should, I not only Lived Real Close to them, But also, I Rode The Ponies, Many, Many times !!!! The Ponies were cute, and nice !!!!! The Pony Rides, were; East of Burger King, , and just west of where Karland, the Go Kart Track was. And The Bowling Alley, was there, at the same time, as The Pony Rides. The Bowling Alley was there, when I was 4 0r 5 years old, -- 1955-56. As for The Restaurants, I Did Forget that Carole's was one of My all Time Favorites, They Had Great, Chef Cooked Meals, and a Huge Menu. My Grandma, used to take me to Carole's , to Eat, a Lot, and we always had a Great Meal. Pickle Herring Charlie's, which was there Before Carole's, I never ate there, only, I would walk By Their Separate Deli, on the side, in a storefront, and I would wave Hi, to the Counterman, and He would Smile, and wave Back, and Sometimes, if I Had Money, I would go in, and Make a Purchase, of A Pickle, from the Pickle Barrel, and a Tall Bottle, of Schweppe's Ginger Ale. Great Memories !!!!! Oh, and Do you Remember, The High Billboard Sign, That was around where The Pony Rides were ????? My friends, and I , used to Climb up inside it, For a Thrill, and it was Like a tree house, But you Had to watch your step, and walk on the Girders, or you would Take a Nasty Fall, and surely, Break some Bones. Thank God, We Never Fell !!!!!!! Oh, and Burger King, Moved, a Good many years ago, to in front of where Hialeah Lanes was, But across the street, in The Hialeah Lanes Parking Lot, and there's a Taco Bell, next To B. K. And Hialeah Lanes, is Sadly Gone. In it's Place are Walgreen's and BlockBuster Video. And on The Corner where Carole's was , there's a CVS Pharmacy. DR. Link's Clinic, The Building, that is, is still there, and it was a Law Office, But I Believe, it's Back to a Clinic, or closed, and vacated, not sure, ???? I Ride By The Old Neighborhood, all the time, just For The Memories, and Believe you me, They come Rushing at Me, Like A Freight Train , and I'm Glad they Do !!!!!!! We are Both; Visitors To Memory Lane, isn't it Wonderful ????? I think so !!!!! Take Care, My Friend, and it was My Pleasure, and we will talk again soon !!!!!!!!! Robbin.Carey-gigi, I'm Doing Great, How Are You ???? The Van Orsdel Funeral Chapel, was on East 4th Avenue, at 21st Street, and Patsy's Italian Restaurant, was On About 18th Street, on East 4th Avenue, also. I Don't Remember any other Restaurant, Right around there, that Met your Description, But that Doesn't mean that it wasn't there, maybe, I forgot about it. We Loved Patsy's, They Had a Nice Place, and Good Food, Especially Their Pizza, I Loved their Pizza, it was Delicious !!!!!!! You Mentioned Publix, I Love Publix !!!!! They're The Cream Of The Crop !!!!! My Wife works for Publix. She's Been with Publix, for Almost 32 years now. Years ago, She worked at The Old Hialeah Drive Publix, For A Few years, and then, She Transferred, to the Old Miami Lakes Publix, in 1982, and she's Been there, in Miami Lakes, since then. But Miami Lakes, Like Hialeah Drive, Has A New Store Now. I've Been Shopping, many times, at The New Hialeah Drive Publix, and I Like it, it's not the Biggest Publix, But it's Real Nice !!!!! My Wife's New Miami Lakes Store, is Much Bigger, and Much nicer, and more modern, than Her old store, which was Built in 1972. I Delivered to Publix, For years, Driving For Swift & Company, Delivering all of their Meats, Store To Store, and That's How I Met My Wife, at Publix !!!!! I Drove Swift's Premium Straight Trucks, and Tractor Trailers, Delivering Quarters Of Beef, Lamb, Pork Loins, Spareribs, Ect. For 15 Years, I Did That !!!!!! Remember , Block's Beef, on Hialeah Drive ???? I Delivered there, and Everywhere !!!!! I always Thought Deer Park, was Neat, and Still Do !!!!! Carey, You Know What, I Miss Linda Jenkins, and wish I Could See Her Again, maybe Because I Mentioned Her So Often. I Lost Track Of Her, She Did Live in Broward County, and at one Time, She worked at Shorty's BBQ, in Davie, on University Drive, But She Hasn't Been there for a few years now . Didn't Fred and Emma, Move To Sebring, or Lake Placid????? I Know they were talking about it !!!!! Carey, Do you Remember; Dorrine Price ???? I LovedHer, at one time, in Elementary School. She Lived Right Off Lejeune Road, at East 13th Street. Well, Gonna Go To Bed Now, and Try and Cut Some Z's. Talk To You Later, My Friend !!!!! Robbin.Eastsider Hello I'm not sure about Deer park being the first subdivision or not, I know that is where James Bright the father of the city had his house it is still there restored back to new it's a real unique looking house with roads on three sides . When I was young we used to call it the haunted house because it was abandoned for a while but at that time I had no idea about it's history. I have a picture of it in an old Home News from 1964 showing an aerial photo from about 1926 and it's the only house there. The open area where the road goes around and is now Mattingly park used to have a fence around it and there were actual deer in it. In the same Home News there is a picture of a little girl petting a deer her name was Leah she was named after the city she was the first child born in Hialeah her father was the first postmaster don't know the last name. I remember the circus but anything before Jan. 1960 I can't put into a chronological order thats when we lived on east 19th st. and 10th ave. so I can't say when it was there but I remember seeing the whole circus go by our house on 10th ave. Again with Flamingo Plaza I was there on the first day, but 1957 sounds good to me I also thought they buried a time capsule some where over there. Those sundecks have mostly turned into two story mini mansions. Some of those houses went from the original 900 sq. ft. to around 4 or 5 thousand. Take Care Talk Later CareyCarey-gigi, Good to Hear From You, My Friend !!!!! I Remember Norman Knight, and Lynn Knight, and Butch Pille, But not the others. Did You Know, or Remember; Stanley Freeman ???? He and I Had Some Bad Chemistry Between Us, and We Never Had A Fight, But Almost, A Few Times. We Laughed, at Each other, But There was Rivalry, or some sort of Bad Blood, Between Us. We never Became Friends, Just We Knew one another. I Went to Hialeah Elementary, and Stanley Freeman, went to South Hialeah Elementary, But I Ran into Him, around the area, at Flamingo Plaza, and other places near my House, and School, and then, Later, We met up again, at Miami Springs JR. High, in 7th Grade. Just Curious, if you Knew Him, or Remembered Him. ??? Did you Know, or Remember; Gail, and Susan McKay, Dorrine Price, Marsha Price, Donna Woods, Alana Temple, Martha Federonis, Susan Duke, And Priscilla Bell.???? Or ; Regina Piccolo ???? I Remember all of these Girls, and I Chased Some Of them !!!!!!! They were all Real Good Looking Girls !!!!!!!! Oh, I almost Forgot, to Mention; Yesterday,- Saturday, in the afternoon, I went To Slumber Plus, in Medley, to Get A New Mattress and Box Spring, as it was Time, Due to My Weight, near 300 Pounds, and a good many years of use, To Replace the old set. Anyway, while there, I saw The Medley Police Racing Team Cars, and Some Of the Racing Team's Personnel, and that was neat, and Made Me think of You, and Pokey, and Eastsider, and Palmetto Speedway, which was only a Few Blocks West of Where I Was. The Old Memories Flashed Before Me, and I not Only Got a Nice New Bed, But I Had A Neat Time There, in Medley, on A Saturday Afternoon. I Made A New Memory, while Recalling Old ones , How about That !!!! The Police, and Medley Police Racing Team Guys Told Me; That They Race At Moroso , and Countyline Raceway, and they Race For A Children's Charity Events, Ect. I Saw A Real Neat Souped Up Camaro, like a 1970 Model, I Believe, and I Heard It Start Up, and They Ran it up into A Trailer, and It Sounded Real Fast, and Loud, and Ferocious, Just Like The 32 Ford Super Modifieds, We Remember, At Hialeah Speedway, and at Palmetto Speedway, in Medley, in the 50's. Do Take Care, Carey, My Hialeah Brother !!!!!! Later !!!!!! Robbin.Pokey, I Read your Post, and I Like you, Love The Old Indy Cars--, Which were Midgets,--- Full Midgets, Much Better, than The Present Indy Cars, The Present ones Look Like Grand Prix Cars. When I was small, in Elementary School, I Loved The 1/2 Midgets, and The Jim Rathman Type Indy Cars, and I Still Do. But as For Go Karts, I Still Like The Vintage Karts, Like Yours, and Like My Exterminator, But I Like The 2006 Types, Like The Comet Kart, and Margay, with the side pieces, and the More comfortable Fiberglass molded seat, much Better than Our Vintage Karts. I Do not, However Like The Looks, Of Some Of The New Karts, which are Completely Covered, with A Fiberglass Body, as to me, they Look too much Like The Kiddie Cars, which a kid Sits in and Drives, and it Has Batteries, Like A Real Car. And also, I Don't Like The Look, of The Present Day 1/2 Midgets, Which Look Like The 2 Seater Dune Buggy , with Their Cage Type Roll Bar around The Sides, and Top. I Like The Old Vintage 1960 Moss Midget Type 1/2 Midget, With it's Round nose Cone Front, and Pointed Rear End. They were My Cup Of Tea !!!!!! But I Realize, that it's all A Matter Of Taste, and it can, and Does Vary, From Person to Person. Like We Stated, before, We Both Like Chainsaw Engines, And I Always Loved West Bend, and McCullogh Engines. And For That Reason, I always Have Loved Chain Saws, Homelite, Mccullough, Poulan, were, and still are, my Favorites. There's only 2 Things I Don't Like About Chain Saws, and That Being; KickBack, and Charles Manson, Who Liked, and Used Chainsaws, Otherwise, I Love Them, especially the Sound. My Father, Had Cousins, in North Carolina, Down Near Camp Lejeune, who in The 50's, and 60's, Were Loggers, and They Cut Down Tall Pine Trees, all Day Long, With Chain Saws. I Remember Seeing them usig Poulan Chain Saws. My Father would Go To See them, and My Little Brother, and I Loved That, and we would watch them, from a Safe Distance. The only Bad thing there, for us, was :There were these Terrible Mosquitos, called Yellow Flies, and when they Bit you, they left a welt, on your skin, and you itched for Days. Oh, and there were Ticks too,and you could get them, very easy. Those Poor Guys, worked Like Dogs, all Day Long, out in The Woods, and in the Summer Heat. Take Care, Pokey, and We'll Talk, again Soon, I'm Sure !!!!!! Robbin. Pokey And Carey-gigi, We Know about The Stock Car Races, on Saturday Nights, and Go Kart Races, Sometimes, on weekends, in the Daytime, But Do you Guys Remember; The 1/2 Midget Races, that they Had At Hialeah Speedway, sometimes, on Sundays, Back in The 60's ????? I used to Go and Watch Them. And Carey, I think you Remember; Dale Little, who was a 1/2 Midget Racer, who Raced there. He Had a Beautiful Candy Apple Red Moss Midget, with A Mc 10 Chainsaw Engine, a Big Round Roll Bar, Behind His Seat, and A Circle Round Nose cone. I Loved the Midgets, like Dale Little Had. I Had A Good Year Track Rabbit, which We Bought at Good year By Northside , on N. W. 27th Avenue, at 88th Street, in about 1960, and it Had A Heavy Tubular Frame, and a Round Fibreglass Body, over that, and it Had A Big Tecumseh- Lawson Generator Type Upright Engine. The Tires, were Big, and pretty Wide, But with Little Grooves-- Tread, not Slicks, Like For Racing. The only thing I Hated about it, was; it Had A Little Hand Throttle, on the Body, to the Left of The Steering Wheel, and that was Dangerous, and a nuisance. I Drove it , For Fun, mostly, at Flamingo Plaza, way over, by 10th avenue. My Dad, had a Station Wagon then, and He'd take me, and My Track Rabbit there to Ride a while. When we got it, It Had A Governor, and was sorta slow, But we took it off, and then, it was pretty Fast. I Had a Lot of Fun, Riding My Orange Track Rabbit. And Back then, Around 1960-61, it only Cost New; $400.00. I wish I Had Pictures of it, But I can't Find any. I Checked on the Internet, to see, if they Had any Pictures, or Mention, of it, But when I type in ; Track Rabbit, all They Give me, is about an Amusement Park Ride, with the same name. I guess My Memories, will Have to Do !!!!!!! Also, Do you Guys Remember; The Sunday 1/2 Midget Races, next to The George T. Baker Aviation School, on Lejeune Road, Back in The Late 50's, and say 1960??? Maybe , Eastsider, would also Remember these Races. As A little Kid, in My Parents Car, we would go on Sundays, To Coral Gables, and South Miami, and we would pass there, and I'd see, and Hear the Races, and I was Happy. I Loved That, and I always Loved Those 1/4, and 1/2 Midgets.. What A Memory !!!!!! Best Regards , Guys !!!!! Later !!!! Robbin.wow... talk about memories... names of some of the people are too familar. I was born in March of 1963 and adopted by George and Betty Andreolas and raised in Hialeah until I moved to NC in 1991. My parents lived in the same house for 30+ years. I have some more pics I could sent you to add. My parents house was the last house and my dad used to go dove hunting across the streat. The next closed road to the west was Okechobee road. I attended DuPuis Elementary from the late 60s and 70's, my favorite teaches Miss MIller and Mrs Powell, some of my least favorites were Mr Biance and Miss Moran. Still remember those days well. I lived in the unincorporated area of Hialeah, the corner of 63 and 113 or in Hialeah terms the corner of 9th and 58 approx. Don, I know of some of your neighbors. Who could forget MIke Sheffield, the cute white blonde haired boy. I know John Ferguson, but was more friends with him later with mutual friends involved in racing. He also had a good friend from Hialeah I would love to know wha happened to, Donnie Lowe. John still lives n South Florida and married Lisa Ketteman from Hialeah and I believe married close to 20 years or more, you think I would know I was in the wedding, but it was a long time ago. Sharon Barimo was my best friend in my first year of going to Palm Springs middle school. I found out she is a Dr now in Tenn, she was ahead of her class always.. very smart girl. I was one of the lucky ones who only attended the early shift during my middle schools years and remember the great talent show that featured Mike and Scott Migone. Scott still playing today!! Some teachers I dont forget in PS middle were Mr. Francis the worse and meanest math teacher ever, he fit the perfect nerd persona. But Dr Metz the biology teacher was the coolest and Mr Carver for math, he was cool. I remember the school being partially burnt down by one of our classmates. I graduated from HML in 1981 and still long for the good ole days. No one seems to have mentioned the other skaing rinks that we spent most of our teenage years at, Tropical Skating rink, the only skaing rink that had concrete floors.. and ouch, did they hurt. Who remembers the Water Boogen place, the first water park . Then when Tropical skating rink closed, Westland skating opened. Still lots of memories... I ended up marrying a skating rink crush years later after running into him at Hialeah Speedway, which was my home for many years. I still remember clearly Barnabys pizza, Figaros, Black Angus, Lums and especially Ferrells.. that the was one of the best!! Diane earlier mentions the Carpenters.. she is still my best friend since 4th grade. I still which Mr Donut and the bowling alley were still there... those were some great memories, oh and Arbetter Hotdogs!! There are a few in my old neighborhood I would love to find, Zayne Durant, Jimmy and Betsy Ross, Steve Diziki (his mom was Rose and was my girl scout leader) from the skaing rink days, Miguel Mesa (or MIggy) and Lenny Ogle (Edge) was his nickname. Thanks for the memories!! Hi Carey - gigi, Yeh, it's Depressing alright, about Hialeah Speedway !!!! Like I Said Before; I Like Lowe's, and Target, and I Go to Both, and Both Fit in there, Look Real Nice, and serve our Purpose, But Like you said; When I'm there, All the old Memories, of Hialeah Speedway, Reappear, and I think; Why couldn't Hialeah Speedway still be Here, and Lowe's And Target, Down The Street, somewhere Else ?????? Oh well, At Least, we Have our Memories, of The Speedway, Better than nothing, I Suppose !!!!!! I Remember Bill Flingos, He was A Legend, at Hialeah Speedway, so sorry, to hear about His Passing, and your Uncle Tommy, as well. When I was a little Kid, in the 50's, I went to The Races, at Hialeah Speedway, a Lot, and A Lot Of Those Times, with Linda Jenkins, and Her Mom and Dad, Fred And Emma, and Those Wonderful memories, are Embedded Pleasantly, in My Mind !!!!!!! Linda's Uncle, Marvin Jenkins , had a Beautiful Gold Custom Super Modified Car, back then, and He Was The Driver. I Remember Some of the names, of the Drivers Back then; Bill Flingos, Marvin Jenkins, Marion Edwards, Bobby Allison, Donnie Allison, Mal Marshal, and there were many others, but that's all my memory, will give me now !!!! I Loved The Races there, especially Going there, with The Jenkins', and My Squeeze,-- Linda Jenkins !!!!! I Loved The Cars back then; The 32 Ford Super Modified's, and there was one of them, in particular, that stands out, in my mind,- A 32 Ford, with Checkered Sides, and they called it The Tennessee Pea Picker !!!!!! That Car, And Marvin Jenkins' Gold Crossley Custom Bodied Car, and Mal Marshal's Blue Crossley Bodied Custom Car. They were all 3 of them, Super Modified Cars !!! Just Like you, I Could Hear The Cars Running, and The Races, on Saturday Nites, at my House, and I Really Miss That !!!!!! I used to Always Get Pizza Slices, at the Speedway, Back in the 50's, and 60's, it was Great, and a Friend of our Family, Marge Bernero, Ran ThePizza Concession, and She was The Manager, of The School Cafeteria, at Immaculate Conception School, for years and years, and she Played a Big Part, in Activities, at Immaculate !!!!! She Passed Away, A Few years ago. She was My Mom and Dad's Good friend, as was Her Family,-- Gus, Butch, and Patty, all of my Life !!!!!!!Great People !!!!!!!! Oh, and Remember, The Destruction , Or Demolition Derby's , at Hialeah Speedway, I Loved Those !!!!!!! So Sorry, you Have to Work, all Weekend, But I Do Understand, That We All Need The Money, And We Have To Work, when We Can !!!!!! As Usual, It was a Pleasure, to Talk with You !!!!!!!! Take Care Carey, My Friend, And We'll Talk Again Soon !!!!!!! So Long, For Now !!!!!!! Robbin.Carey-gigi, Yes, We Enjoyed our Thanksgiving Dinner Immencely !!!!!! I Hope you, and your family, enjoyed yours !!!! Your Poor Wife Works Hard, Like You, it sounds Like, And I'll Bet She's Tired Out Tonight, after all of that Cooking !!!! Carey, The ShowTime Rotisserie Oven, is the one that They Advertise, and Demonstrate, on T. V., a Lot, with the Inventor, of The Oven, and A Lot of other Things,-- Ron Popeil. We've Cooked Roast Beef in it Twice, and A Ham today, and Let me tell you;, in one Hour, it Cooks The Beef Roast, or Smoked Ham, To Perfection. We used to watch the Commercials, on The ShowTime Oven, and we said; Maybe Sometime, we'll get one, well we recently got one, and we Love it. About Ranch House, We Eat There, inside, once in a while, But we Get Take Out, all the Time, From There. I Remember the one on 36th Street, and I Ate there, once in a while, Myself, years ago. The One we go to, on West 84th Street, is The Only Ranch House Restaurant Left. The Corporation Folded, years ago, and Ponos, The Present owner,was a Big Suervisor, For The Ranch House Chain, and when They Went out Of Business, Ponos Kept The West 84thStreet Location Open, and We're Glad He Did !!!!!! The Big Char Broiled Hamburger, you Got at 36th Street, is Exactly the same. That's what I usually Order, Or Jumbo Fried Shrimp. And always Sweet Iced Tea, and Theirs is Real Good !!!!! I Know where the TownHouses are on West 16th Avenue, and I Pass by there, all the time. That's not too far, from my House. Well, Back To The Salt Mines Tomorrow, Yuck !!!!!!! One good thing for me, at Least; After tomorrow, I'm Off Saturday, and Sunday , Good !!!!! As Always, It was A Pleasure, Talking To You, Carey !!!!!!! Take Care, and We'll Talk again Soon !!!!!!!! Robbin.Yes, my dad knew CB Anglin very well. Everyone called my dad Gus. My dad preferred to ride his bike on errands so you may have seen him around. His last bike was a blue schwinn. He would ride to Farm Store on 43(?) street and E.4th avenue. The grocery store on 41st and e.8th ave and to sims. I would too for that matter. Does anyone remember \"clackers\"? To hard plastic balls connect with a string that you knock together? We all got ours at woodys . Almost directly across the street from Farm Store were the Seitz house, they went to St. Luke church on 41st street. The land for the station on 43 st and lejeune was sold to the by my godparents (Warren and Iris Sutton), Their house is next to the fire station. There is a vacant lot there that belongs to them. Warren owned an HVAC company. On 41(?)st on the south side of N. hialeah elementary school was John & Mary Perkins our TV repairman (yes they used to repair TVs!) . Back on our street (47th), to our right side was Oddie Sharpe (the mother of Shelly and KC sunshine fame), to our left the Nalli's still live there. Maybe you remember the Nalli boys Rich, Joe and Bobby ? They also had a daughter Marie. Milander was a great mayor and well liked in Hialeah, but not so much in the county. He was a separatist, I guess he wanted to keep the taxes low for the working class people of hialeah. I heard he wanted to make Hialeah a separate county and is the reason why Hialeah has different street numbering than the rest of Dade county. Perhaps the resentment continues today is is part of why there is lack of funding for Hialeah race track renovation ? He grew up in Miami Springs and was the homecoming king at that school. My oldest sister Julie (64 grad) lived on that same street as farm store and married Wayne (buddy) Barber. I remember riding my bicycle over to her house she was like a second mother to me. Buddy used to have an air boat and would take me out for rides in the glades. Another name that comes to mind is Eric Ritchey, my senior english teacher at HHS. On fourth of July we could sit out in our front yard and see the fireworks at Milander stadium. At Westland Mall there was a place called Ferrell's a SUPER ice cream place. On your birthday the would come around and bring you a huge ice cream platter called the ZOO an sing happy birthday. Next to the farm store there was a pet store. Does anyone remember Lou's Gun shop on Palm avenue? I think it's still there but someone else owns it. The new owner's wife opened a flower store next to it. I thought it would be cool to combine them and call it \"Guns and Roses\" Ha Ha.Yes, my dad knew CB Anglin very well. Everyone called my dad Gus.

I'm still here...have been looking in when able in between doctors etc. I appreciate your concern Robbin. I'll be checking in over the next several months, but not able to say much. Big surgery coming up with a lengthy recovery. Looking forward to getting it over with. All the prep and test, etc. probably worse. Anyway, thanks again, please keep posting the memories. My wife will be reading them to me when we can get to it. MRS. STABLE: I was excited to see that you have discovered this site. As you are able, please fill us in on how some of the surviving teachers from the '60's are. You may have read how I stayed in touch with my first grade teacher, Jane Bauer. It helped that her and her husband moved to Stuart the same time our family did the same thing. I use to take my kids by to see her and her husband at their house one block off the St. Lucie River. They were great! Both have died. CAREY-GIGI: I went to school with your twin sisters! My twin died a few days before second grade started and I have always had a special place in my heart for twins. My brother and I are 'identical twins.' Kenneth Benton and I had a few e-mail exchanges a few years ago and he mentioned your twins. He stayed in touch with them into adulthood. I lost touch with most Hialeah kids by moving away during Jr. High. (Glad to get out of Filer). Anyway, hope all is well with your sisters. They probably wouldn't remember me, but I remember them. Hope to see some great memories posted by all.JohnHHs1982, Hi, I enjoyed your Story, and Recognized Many Things, and Places, you Mentioned. And I Have to Agree, with You, That Around The 80's, or Before, Hialeah, was on The Way Down !!!!!! And it's Still on The way Down, By The Day !!!!! I always thought the Hialeah Park Tunnels, were neat, also. I used to walk thru them, all the time, Back in The Day !!!!!! I Remember, very well, The Time Carl Brown, went Berserk, and Killed those People, it was a Real Tragedy, and A Horrible Day !!! When I attended Hialeah High, in 1967-68, I went To Julius Caesar's, all the Time, They Had Great Food, and I wish it was still there now, and I could Go there, still !!!! I Still go to The Carvel, on The Corner there, all the time, Their Ice Cream, is Great. I Live in West Hialeah now, near Miami Lakes, But from Birth, in 1951, to 1964, I Grew up in SunTan Village, in East Hialeah, By Hialeah Lanes, Bowling Alley, around East 9th Street, and Lejeune Road. I was Born in The City Of Miami, in Morningside, But My Mom, was from Kentucky, And My Dad, was From Pittsburgh, PA., and they Moved To Hialeah, in 1948, and My Brother and I, Were Born Here Later on. I went To Hialeah Elementary, Miami Springs JR. High, Palm Springs JR. High, and Hialeah High. Oh, and I ate at that Ranch House, By K- Mart, Many, Many Times. I Go to Ranch House, on West 84th Street, and 15th Avenue, all the Time, to Eat, it's just like the one you worked at, and I think it's the only one Left. The Owner,- Ponos, used to Be A Big Supervisor, For Ranch House Inc., and He Kept this one open, By Buying it !!! Same Great Hamburgers, Breakfast, Fried Jumbo Shrimp, Ect. Isn't this Site Great ????? I Love it, and I Read, and Write Here, all the Time !!!!! Best Regards, John !!! Robbin P. Learned.I grew up at 761 E 47th street. Went to North Hialeah Elementary, Hialeah Jr. High and HHS. I never went to any of the races but would ride my bike through the tunnels at Hialeah race track. It do remember that it was still open. I remember Sims drugs, Muellers animal hospital, Medfords, Woodys 5 &10, The Schwinn bike shop on E 41st and E 4th ave. There was a Food Fair next to it. My church was St. Luke Lutheran Church on 41st which my dad helped build. Before my parents moved to hialeah 1947, they lived in Allapatah where my mom grew up. She moved to Miami in 1925 with her family from Louisiana. My grandfather worked as a carpenter on several of the downtown buildings including the Miami Courthouse. My father met mom in Miami while he was stationed at a place called Bell Haven in 79th street (miami) during WWII. They bought one of the \"GI houses\" in hialeah and that is where they lived for nearly sixty years. My oldest sister who is now deceased graduated from HHS in 1964, the year I was born. I graduated in 1982. In Junior high 77 - 79 I had a Social Studies teacher Carl Brown who was a bit eccentric drinking sour milk from cartons he left in his desk. Anyway, maybe two years later I heard that he had gone into a lawnmower repair shop disgruntled about his service and shot gunned the place killing five people. He was run down when he tried to get away on his bicycle. You know by the eighties Hialeah was on its way down. I shudder to think that he used to be a school teacher. Worked at Julius Caesar's restaurant catycorner from HHS. Across from Dr. Dossick and Carvels ice cream. ( I heard that carvels was the busyest one in florida). We had a great time working at Julius Caesars. Peter Castro and his family owned it at the time. We made great steaks and great broasted chicken. They had broasted way before KFC was around. Worked at Ranch house on 49 th street too. We used to drive way up to Ft. Lauderdale beach which was the in place in the eighties after JC's closed for the evening. My next door neighbor Shelly Sharpe dated the drummer from KC and the sunshine band.I am posting this message, sent to me in an e-mail, here where it will be seen by more folks instead of just me:\n\nDon\n\n15-Nov-2008 22:07\n\njohnhhs1982 (johnhhs1982) 15-Nov-2008 22:07\n\nWow! what a trip back! To Sofia and Karen, I remember Mr. Hoyt too. He was my fifth grade teacher around 1974 at North Hialeah Elementary. I remember GUIDANCE after morning announcements. Mr Hoyt rode his bicycle to NHE too. There were two brothers and a sister in class, one brother Bobby Young was in Mr Hoyt's class he had red hair and the amazing ability to tell you which day of the week given any date in history. There was a very hyper active girl named Beatrice Blanco who would always get up from her seat and talk out much to the aggravation of Mr. Hoyt. I remember him using a SEAT BELT and fastening her to her chair. No kidding. He had a rubber play sword that he would threaten to slap her with if she misbehaved. I felt good about guidance. Very inthused, focused after he gave his lesson. He would challenge us to come up with a subject that he could not tie into his guidance lesson. Mr Hoyt could outrun any student when he would occasionally take us out to the play field. Only one student who he could not out run or out hit (softball) was Douglas Almaguer (sp?). I remember a Karen, is that you? Do you remember Carey Mills ?? She had long straight black hair and I had a CRUSH on her wow! she was cute. Part Cherokee indian from Norfolk VA. I never said much to her because she sat on the other side of the room. She would always smile at me and I think she new I liked her which is surprising because I often work a blue and white checkered shirt with matching blue and white checkerd pants, a real chick magnet. I always wondered what happened to her. Some of the other teachers at NHS at that time were Mr. Greene the music teacher who came to the room with his cart. He also had a childrens music show on public TV. There was Mr. Woolard, Mrs. Smith (1st grade). The pricipal was Dr. Popalardo. I was a student crossing guard you know the one with the orange belts? Anyway, if anybody remembers those times send me an email at jag217@gmail.com .\n\nOther classmates were: Jon Andrews who died in a car crash later in high school down in the Keys, John Millovan, Donald Hicks, Marcie Hicks, Yvette Colinas, William (Willy) Avila ( He later drove a 1971 plymouth Road Runner in High School another source of great stories !) I lived on 761 E. 47th Street. 47th street is Thoroughbred drive west of E. 4th avenue. those were the days. Karen, Sofia send me an email.Carey-Gigi, Haven't heard from you for a while, and it's nice, as always, to hear from you !!!!! I'm Quite Sure, you've Been Busy, it seems as though, you always are. Thanks, for The Compliment, about my suggestion, about everyone Flying their Flag, that was nice, and very Patriotic, of you. And I Liked Hearing about your High Flag Pole, and Showing your neighbor, the Right Thing, to Do. Here in Hialeah, I Can Imagine, What Flag, Your Neighbor Had Up. A Real Shame, and A Disgrace !!!!! I Salute You, Sir, For Your Patriotism, it's very Refreshing !!!!! I Had a nice Veterans Day, and I Hope you Did Too. I'm sure you Had to work though, and I was Off, to Relax, Reflect, Recover, and ReGroup. And Tomorrow, it's Back to the Salt Mines again !!!!! At Least, though, I'm not in Iraq, That would certainly, Be Much Worse !!!!!! That was very interesting, about Col. Tibbets, and Family, I've Heard the name Before, But I admit that I Didn't know much about The Tibbits Family . I Love Baby Ruth Bars, one of my Favorites !!!!! You Know, Amelia Earhart, Took Off From Hialeah, over By UPS, and Hialeah Police HeadQuarters, on Her One way Trip Around The World, and Glenn Curtiss, was a Local Pioneer Aviator, and some of The Famous WW2 Tuskeegee Airmen Army Air Corps Pilots, Live in Dade, and Broward, and I Know one of them, personally; Col. Leo Gray, and He's The President Of The Tuskeegee Airmen, and A Very Nice Man !!!!!!!! And Did you know; That MIA, was at one time called Pan American Field ?????? During World War ll, Dade and Broward, were Full of Military Landing Strips, Ect., Such as Masters Field, Opa Locka Naval Air Base, Perry Field, Cherry Grove, Richmond Heights Naval Air Base, and Many Military Troops, Trained on The Beach Sands, at Miami Beach. This Area was A Real Military Place, During WWll. Lots of Military History Here. Take Care, Carey, and Try not To Work Too Hard. Best Regards, as Always !!!!!!! Robbin.Guest, I Remember The Guards on the Palm Avenue Gate, Where we went in, and The Barn where I worked, was to the Left of The Guards, Down a ways. The Track Kitchen, as you Probably Remember, Had Real Good Breakfast, I was Lucky enough, to Eat There, Most Every Day, and I Enjoyed that. You're Right, The Barns, in the Stable Area, are all Gone now, and It is a Real Sad Sight, and thought, to see that Beautiful, and Historic Place, Sitting there, Decaying, and it's Fate, a Mystery. I've Lived Here in Hialeah, all of my Life,- 57 1/2 years now, and I went to Hialeah Park, many times, and my Mom And Dad, and Grandma, Loved Hialeah Park, and went Every Racing Day, Betting, and Enjoying, the Races, and it's A Crying Shame, about that Wonderful Track, and Grounds. I Hope MR. Donn, can save The Place, and not Have to sell it to Developers, But I would Say, that in my opinion, that may Happen. I was always told; That Hialeah Park, was on The National Register Of Historic Places, and Could Not Be Torn Down, But it seems that that is just a piece of paper, any more, and doesn't carry any weight. Look at ; Miami Stadium, The Orange Bowl, Robert E. Lee JR. High School, all of them were Torn Down, and History, and Memories, Didn't Mean A Thing. It's Heartless, and all about Money, and Human Greed !!!!!!!! Oh, and I Forgot; Hialeah Speedway, another Great Place, and A Part of Hialeah's Unique Character. I used to Go there, sometimes, and When I was a young Kid, growing up in SouthEast Hialeah, near Hialeah Lanes, I used to Go to Hialeah Speedway. Hialeah, now Has No Bowling Alleys, No Putt Putt Golf, No Skating Rinks, No Speedway, No Horse Races, All of them are Gone. Very Pathetic, I Think !!!! Hialeah , Used To Be Better, in My Opinion, It's Really Gone Down, in a Lot Of Ways. Now, all we Have, is; Too Much Traffic, Stores, Stores, Stores, And Businesses. It's All About Money, Unfortunately. That's How I See It. Best Regards !!!!!!! Robbin P. Learned.\n\nI am posting this for Bruce York:\n\n\"I found this site just surfing around, and what a pleasant surprise. Thanks Don, for an excellent website, which has brought back so many memories...of a simpler and more laid back life which I remember well, even though I was only a kid when I lived in Hialeah. I was born in Miami Beach in 1951, and my family (parents and an older sister) moved from the Beach to a new development, Palm Springs, in the summer of 1956 (when I was barely five years old). This was our first home, having rented apartments prior to that. We lived at 5411 West 6th Ave. I went to first grade at Twin Lakes Elementary, and entered the brand-new DuPuis Elementary for second grade. (Yes, I remember those nice multi-colored doors!)\n\nIt was really nice being part of a new development. Everyones house was new; a new life for most of us, and enjoying life in suburbia like so much of the country. Having a three-bedroom house with porch and carport, and my own bedroom was a thrill for me. We lived in Hialeah for only six years. I went to DuPuis from 2nd through 5th grade. In 1962, for different reasons, we moved back to Miami Beach, where I lived till leaving home in the early 1970s. I graduated from Beach High in 1969.....my sister Carole, in 1965. There were reasons why I was happy to be back on the Beach.....I had grandparents there, and roots as well. My parents moved from New Jersey to Miami Beach in 1948.\n\nI never gave too much thought to my years in Hialeah. However, in hindsight they were formative and important years....that is where I went to school for five years, hence most of my childhood was spent there. This site has stirred up so many feelings and memories...things I havent thought of for a long time. However, I tend to think about the past a lot....I dont dwell in it, but we were better off in so many different aspects. I miss it! So, sites like this one, and reading other peoples recollections puts a smile on my face! With all the time that I spend online, it wasnt until a few weeks ago that I did some searching on Old Hialeah, and sure enough....here it is! Having moved there in 56, that was before the shopping center opened and hence the start of Palm Springs Mile. I remember when we had to go to Kwik Chek (was that it?) on East 4 Ave. Anyone remember Stevens and Fredericks supermarkets? Not in Hialeah, but huge supermarkets, with good prices, I assume.\n\nSo much of my time was spent at the stores at the shopping center on 49th St. At Red Road. Also, this was before the movie theater opened. For movies, we went to the Essex Theater and the Circle Theater in Miami Springs. Also, I have great memories of the 22nd Ave. and 27th Ave. Drive-Ins. Apparently, my parents enjoyed movies very much, as they took us kids there often.\n\nWhen the shopping center opened, we shopped at Grand Union of course. GC Murphys five and ten was where I spent a lot of time. Remember Neisners? Grables Bakery? I remember when the first Burger King opened on the Mile (1961 or 62 I believe). Thats when a Whopper was really a whopper!! Ive had a weakness for them ever since. But todays Whopper cant compare. I remember the first Intl. House of Pancakes (first one in Hialeah that is). And the bowling alley....great! Wasnt there a place with miniature golf and trampolines as well?\n\nIn the early years, I remember hearing the cows in the distance.....toward the present-day Palmetto Expwy.....and possibly closer than that. There was pastures and wide-open spaces at the edge of town. I went to the swimming pool at Municipal Auditorium....took swimming lessons there as well. I was talking with my sister about this website, and her being four years older than me, fondly remembers part of her teen years in Hialeah. She used to rave about the dances at Municipal Auditorium. And that was when the greatest music ever (IMHO), oldies was the music of the day. It was Top 40 at the time....but what incredible music, and to be able to go to dances. I wish there was something like that today....but a different world indeed!\n\nI noticed a post on this forum by Peter Sandler. I was floored to see his name. That was one of my best friends....and if you read this Peter, I would love to get in touch. It has been 44 years since we last saw each other.....damn, that makes us sound old....but its all in the attitude! Peter mentioned names of people (classmates) that I clearly remember. And I have recognized other names that people mentioned in the forum.....classmates, folks who are my sisters age, names from the neighborhood etc. Every so often I think of memories from Hialeah....but this site has really got my brain going.\n\nAnother good friend was June Doerson, who lived around the corner. Also her older sister Carol Doerson was best friends with my sister. In the years since my Hialeah childhood, I lived back in Miami Beach, moved to San Francisco, and on a visit to my parents one year, went down to Key West for a visit....and eventually moved here. I have been in Key West 21 years (a freshwater Conch.....to be a Conch, you had to have been born in KW). But, I WAS born in Miami Beach! My parents are 88 and 89 and have been living in Broward since 1985....although my mom is in an assisted-living facility needing a lot of care. Dad is in a facility too, great physical shape, but the memory is going. He DOES remember things way in the past pretty well....and always had regrets about selling the house in Hialeah. Anyway, I will share more as it comes to me, and as I read everyones posts. I enjoy it immensely!\"\n\nBruce YorkRobbin\n\nMy friend Mike later traded his 160 in for a 305 Yamaha, and then later got a 350 Yamaha, I remember his brother Frank took it out on 95 with me following on my 305, and he blew my doors off. We use to race (unofficially) up at masters field, behind the Miami Dade Jr (north) Campus, they held drag races there in the early/middle 60's. We would ride out to Andy Town, on 27, alot and spent alot of time running Krome Ave from Rt 27 to Tamiami Trail for top end speed. We also would go to the ranger station on Tamaimi Trail for hog roasts. There was an open area in north hialeah off of 103 st just (north) over the railroad tracks, that had a rock pit (lake) and a few dirt hills that we spent alot of time riding out there. I have alot of old movies of us on the bikes. There were a couple of guys that didn't live in the park that rode with us, one had an Aerial Square 4, one rode a 750 Enfield, and the other had a Vicent Black Shadow.\n\nI remember the man with Black Shadow real good. We use to hang out at my trailer alot in the evenings and saturdays deciding where to go. One sat the elderly man that drove the propane truck in the park stoped to talk to us, he ask if we knew what a Vincent Black Shadow was. We were 14 - 16 years old and had only ever read about them, never saw one, he said be here next week . He pull up on an original Black Shadow and said lets go to master field. there were about 6 of us and we all headed to master field with him. I was riding my 305 next to him when we crossed 103 st on 32 ave, doing about 40, and he said sift down an take off, I did, and he left me like I had reverse on that bike. He sure made believers out of a bunch of kids that day.Robbin----I was reading your recent post and I realized that I was only one grade ahead of you, I guess turning 7 in first grade and repeating 7th grade did that , my younger brother caught up with me in 7th grade. When I was talking about Dr. Bowles earlier I was being kind but you really said the truth about that mean ,miserable man I once got an F because he thought my hair wasn't combed. Oh how I hated him,oh well my favorite teacher in jr. high was Mr. Jarlenski I still remember everything he ever taught me ,had him for the second tri-mester in 7th grade taught us how to print letters and numbers correctly ,basic photography and silkscreening. I took his class for my elective in 8th grade ,I was in his class after lunch time when the P.A. came on and announced that JFK had been shot it was around 1:40 e.s.t. couldn't quite figure out what they were talking about for a minute or two, Iremember going to english class at 2:15 upstairs and around 2:45 they announced he died' we didn't know he was already dead for 45 minutes or so they let us go home about 15 or 20 minutes early. What I admired about Mr. Jarlenski was that he respected the students and trusted us, and that is all he wanted in return, besides everyone in the 8th grade class I was in loved being in that class I still use his teachings everyday in my work. ( thank you Mr. Jarlenski). I remember Mr. Harrisons corvette thought what a lucky guy those cars came standard with a blonde hair blue eyed girl from the factory. My brother who worked for the school board told me Mr Harrison later opened a few big car washes did pretty good too. you mentioned John Knuck he didn't look that big to me ,maybe because Iwas a year older than him said directly behind him in 7th grade homeroom and english. I remember he had a cushman eagle for a while and his older brother Frank had a Yamaha 250 catalina their father was a circuit court judge they lived in deer park section used to see him at Burger Castle and around, once we were at the clay pits in Miami Springs they were still building the senior high and there was no fence around it we were riding bikes up and down the slope and Frank Knuck took his motorcycle up there and it fell in the wet clay, real messy. I remember the football game between the faculty and students did you ever remember hearing give me two laps around the pine trees. I didn't care too much for phys. ed. my older sister used to write me excuses saying my asthma was bothering me the night before. once I didn't dress out for two months. -------------Talk later CareyCarey- Gigi, We Had a lot of Scooters, around our area, back then, in the 50's, and up until my family moved to northwest Hialeah, in 1964. I Remember several; Cushman Eagles, and Vespas, But only, a couple Mustangs, andFla. Power And Light, used to Come to our neighborhood, to Read the meters, on an orange Mustang Pony, with solid Gray Disc Wheels. I Liked them all, But the Mustang, was my Favorite. I Think Myles Milander, Had a White Mustang, at Miami Springs JR. High, when I went there. When we went to Shell's City, and Grandway, we would Go By A- Cycle Shop, and I would see the Mustangs, in the Front window, and I Always, got a thrill, outa that !!!!!!!! In my 1/2 of the 7th Grade, at Miami Springs JR. High, I Had Coach Harrison, for Phys. Ed. Remember, His Red and White Route 66 Corvette Convertible ???? He used to Go to Hialeah Lanes, all the time, To Bowl, and to play Billiards, and I would see Him, and say Hi. I Loved Miss Dotson, my English Grammar teacher, I thought she was so Pretty, and so was Miss Little. As for DR. Bowles, I Never Liked that man, He was a Miserable Grouchy Fat, Fat, Fat Man. I heard back then, that He was a very well thought of teacher, and one of the most Highly Paid Teachers, in the Dade County School System, But I Thought He was a S. O. B., and an A. H. He used to Be so Mean, and Sarcastic, and if He saw you writing, with an Ink Pen, or Talking, He would Tell one of His Monitors, to Dock your Grade, or To Give you an F, or a Zero, for the Day. His Class Monitors, were; MR. Moffitt, Miss Little, and MRS. Mc Cormick. And Remember; DR. Bowles, used to call us; Little Chums ??? He Had His Monitors Give me an F, or zero, many Times, The Fat A. H. I Think He Had A Gland Problem, or else He ate way too Much !!!!!! You Know, Coach Bill Nobles, Later Became The Principal, of HML, near my House, But I think He Died Later, if I'm not Mistaken. ??? Do You Remember; Regina Piccolo, at Miami Springs JR. High, ??? I Do, She was Beautiful !!!!!!! Remember, John Knuck, The Real Big Guy, on The Varsity Patrol, and He Rode Some Kind of Motorcycle, to School, I Think he was a Bully, pushing Little 7th Graders, like me around. Oh, and Carey, Do you Remember, The Football Game They Had, Between The Faculty, and The 9th Grade Varsity Team ???? And For The Cheerleaders, They Had; Miss Dotson, Miss Little, and MRS. Sorrels. And They Looked Like College Cheerleaders, Probably, Because they were young, and Nearly; Fresh out Of College. I Enjoyed watching that Game, when I was there. I was in one oF my 7th Grade Classes, When The P. A. came on, and Announcd, that President Kennedy, Had Been Shot !!!!! What A Shock !!! And Do you Remember, when one Day, They Tried an Experiment, to Put Top Hit Songs, over the P. A., instead of Bells, when it was time to Change Classes ????? I Remember That, and I Remember one of My Favorite Songs Playing,; He's So Fine, By The Chiffons. I Still Love that Song !!!!! Well, I Enjoyed , My Stroll Down Memory Lane, But now, I Gotta Get Ready for Work, 3 To 11 Shift, so I'll Talk to you Later, My Friend !!!!!! Best Regards !!!!! Robbin.Carey- Gigi, Your work, is a Great Trade, to Know, But I can only Imagine, What Hard work, it is !!!!!!!! You Must Get Tired !!!!!! Yes, I Do remember, The Shot Put Accident, Very Well, The Poor Guy's name was; Woody Duncan, and He accidently, Got Hit in the Head, with an 8 Pound Iron Ball Shot Put, and He Had to Have Surgery, and A Steel Plate, was necessary, and was Surgicly, Put in His Head, to Support His Skull, or Replace it. That Poor Guy, Must HaveGone Thru Pure Hell. It was a Real Shame, What Happened, To Him. Oh, Carey, Did you Remember; Paul Scurto ?????? He Lived on Lejeune Road, at about 17th Street. And there was a Good Looking Blonde, that Lived on Lejeune Road, at around; 14th street, in the middle, of the Block, can't remember her Last name, but I think her 1st name, was Karen, and she was a Good Friend of Barbara Howell, Diane's older Sister. Remember, Hialeah Lanes,???? They Had the Booths for Eating, facing the Bowling Alley's, and A number, at Each Booth, and a Large Numbered Board, in the Middle of the place, up High, and when someone sat Down, and needed Service, they would Push the tab at the Booth, and that number would Light Up, on the Board. Us Kids, would go there, and push the Tabs of the Booths, and watch the Waitresses Scramble, to the Booths, only To Find No one there, and Us Stupid Kids, were Having Fun !!!!!!!! And we would take a little piece of paper Straw, and jam it Down in the Hole, of the water Fountain, so that when someone Went to take a Drink, they would Get A Shower, and Of Course,,,,,, We Were Watching, and Laughing So Hard, we Had to Run out, of the Bowling Alley !!!! Stupid Kids !!!!!! And We Did Get Kicked out, a Few times, By the Managers !!!!!!! And also, we would Go on our 20 Inch Bikes, to Doctor's Offices, and Knock on the Back Door, and Kick the Trash Can Over, and when they opened the Door, they'd See us, Hauling A. Away !!!!!! I Know they Said; Those Stupid Kids !!!!!!!!! Oh, and Carey, Remember, The Ice Cold Water Fountain, Hooked onto the Coke Machine, at the Suntan Village Shell Gas Station. I used to Go there, for a Cold sip of water, all the Time !!!!!!!!!!! The Good Old Days !!!!!! Do you Remember, ???????? Dorine Price, and Her 2 Sisters, who lived on East 13th Street, and Lejeune Road, on the west side of Lejeune,, They were all 3 Beautiful !!!!!! I used to Go to their House, to See Dorine. Had a Big Crush, on Her !!!!!!! Gotta Go . We will Continue Later !!!!! Take Care !!!! Robbin.Pokey, I Forgot, to mention; I Had a Daisy Air Rifle, and a Daisy Lever Action BB Gun, and The Air Rifle was O.K., MyBB Gun, and My Slingshots, and My Eagle Eyes, Got Me in Big Trouble, with my Father, and Led to Confiscation, of Said Items !!!!!! Ha Ha !!!!!! Major HeartBreak, For Me !!!!!!! I Had a Ball with them, Till Daddy Took them away !!!!! Pokey, The new Miami Central High, is Next Door, to the west, of your old school, and it's all 3 story, and Some of it is on 95th Street, and some of it, is on the side , far west of 17th Avenue. I can Take the Pictures, no Problem, I Like Doing that, But Getting them to you, is a Bit of a Problem, as I Have no Printer, or any way, to Post the pictures. I would need a P. O. Box, or some where to Mail the Pictures, which would Be My treat , and My Pleasure. I will Snap the Pictures, this weekend, But will Have to wait a few Days, for Developing, and then I will Send them, where you Say to !!!!!!! Oh, and North Miami SR. High, and North Miami JR. High-- Middle School, are Getting Torn Down also, and will Have New Schools. About Your Miami Central Gym, I'm Not Sure, ????? The last time I went by there, a while back, your old Gym was there, but I Don't know about now, I will Check !!!!! Your Old Gym, was Neat, I Liked it, when you were inside, it was Like an Arena, for Hockey, ect !!!!!! My old High School, Hialeah High, has Been Remodeled some, and has a new Addition, with a parking Garage Below, but it still, basicly, looks the same. Our old Gym was falling Down, don't know, if they fixed it up or not !!!! So Much For Progress, I Resent it !!!!! Progress is not always Good, it Hates History !!!!!! Later !!!! Robbin.Pokey, I never was in A BB Gun war, But in the Field , I mentioned, we Had Rock wars, where we all Picked up Rocks, and Ambushed each other, and we did get hit. I remember Bumps on My Forehead, and Bleeding there, Like we said; STUPID KIDS !!!!!!! But we Did Have Fun, Didn't We ?????? Wow, I Forgot About that, you Guys, were in Trailers, During The Hurricanes, Scary !!!!! Now that's A Test, To see if God Loves you, or not !!!!! Jesse Causey, was a Real Nice Guy, and a Terrific Athlete. I Do Remember, now, that He was a Star Reciever, For Miami Central's Football Team, when I was at Hialeah High. And He was a Big Ladies Man, the women went after Him , Lucky Dog !!!!!!! I remember your Miami Central Gym, the way it Looked sorta Like Hialeah Roller Rink, or Home Lumber. I went there to see Basketball Games Before. You Know Pokey, that old saying; You Can Never Go Home, anymore, Well, you can Go Home again, But Don't Expect anything, or everything, to Be the same, Because Things Change, and so Do You !!!!!! Life, People, and Everything, are Strange, and I Admit;,I Haven't Figured any oF them out Yet, and Sometimes, I Feel Like I'm Clark Kent, as A Baby, and I Just Landed Here, and I Have No Idea, What's Going on !!!!!!!! Maybe, It's Only Me, who Feels that way !!!!!! You Probably Remember The Red Barn, Carey- Gigi said He Did !!!! Remember, The Lindsley Lumber, on 79th Street, near Where The McDonald's was, and near Bell Haven???? And Remember Earl's Market, and The Kwik Chek, on East 25th Street, Hialeah, Which Later became City Gas ??? Remember, Broadmoor Pharmacy, on 32nd, and 87th????? The new Miami Central High, Looks Nice, and Modern, But it's A Shame, That your Old School, is Gone now, and only Your Memory, and Pictures, will Remember The Old School . Now, The Orange Bowl is Gone, Miami Stadium, is Gone, Robert E. Lee JR. High, is Gone, ect., and History was Lost, and Hopefully, Hialeah Park Horse Track, will not Be Next, it's Fate, is up in the Air, John Brunetti, May sell it, and if He does, There it Goes, to the wrecking Ball, and Here comes; Condos, and Shopping Center strip Malls. It's a shame, that Everything is Money, But it is ,these Days !!!!!!!! I Like History, and Nostalgia, and I Get Angry, by all of this Disregard for Respect For History, But What can We Do, Money Talks, and B. S. Walks, so we Lose !!!!!!! Talk Later, My Friend !!!!! Robbin.Robbin\n\nYa, I knew who Jesse was, I didn't know him personally, but we went to Madison Jr High and also Miami Central High. I remember he was a pretty good football player, and got a scholarship to a college to play ball, but had an accident ( I heard) while in college and ended his playing days ( I was told ). I was told he fell out of a Dorm window some how and was hurt, don't know if that is true or not.\n\nYou talk about the hurricanes, I went through all of them from 53 till 69 in a 8 x 27 foot tralier. My dad worked for the park for a while and I remember riding around with him in the WWII truck, that the park had, checking for down power lines and trees.\n\nThanks for the info on Central High. in 2003 I took my son to MIami on his spring break, he wanted to see where I grew up. I took him by Broadmoor, Madison, and Miami Central. It was a shock to see the condition they were in. He ask if they had that chain link fence with barb wire on it when I went there. I told him no, it really was a nice school. I took him around Hialeah and the Springs, 71st beach, South Beach and he swam at Halover, went by the stock car track, and saw how it was built up there, I went by where the tralier park was and just saw an empty field, as if nothing was ever there, that was sad to look at, then went to Key West. It was nice to go back after 25 years, but it was also nice to get out of there too.Carey-Gigi, Nice to hear from you, again !!!! Yes, I Do remember; Hurricane Donna, all too well !!!!! There were some Power Lines Down, around our Neighborhood, and a lot of Flooded Side Streets. Our Windows, were not Boarded Up, But we were Fine, and you Know How Strong, our Houses Were, around there, Solid Concrete, and Steel. I used to Go to that Hialeah Drive Dairy Queen, all the time, and I was in that Glass Phone Booth, Many times. Also, Remember, the tall Office Building, across the street, that was; Southern Bell ??? We Kids, used to Go up in their Elevator, enjoy the Ride, and Look at Pretty Girls, and Pretty Ladies there, just for Fun !!!!! The Bowling Alley's Parking Lot, and the Field, were Our Neighborhood Kids' Playground !!!!!! We Dug Holes, Tunnels, ect., and we Made a Tree House in a Big Tree in the Field, and We Played; Run The Man Down, on Bikes, in The Parking Lot. 2 or 3 Kids, would walk, and Run, from one Light Pole Island, to another, and a Bunch of Other Kids on Bikes, would try to Run them Over. It was Crazy, and Dangerous, and you could get Hurt, But We Had Fun !!!!!!! Also, We would Get a Shopping Buggy, from Food Fair, and a Kid would Get in it, and we would push it out on East 9th Street, and watch, and Listen, to the Cars Locking up the Brakes, and Squealing their tires, to stop, and not Hit the Kid in the Shopping Buggy. We Would Run, and Laugh, and the Cars Driver, would Be Cussing Us Out, But Fortunately, We Never Got in Trouble, and none of us got Hit. It was Stupid, and Crazy, But Fun !!!!!!! Oh, and Myself, My Little Brother, and all the neighborhood Kids, used to Camp Out in that Field, or on Chase Lounge Chairs, and in Tents, in our Back yards, and about 3 A. M., A Street Sweeper, would Sweep the Food Fair, and Bowling Alley Parking Lots, and we would Throw Oranges, ect., at the Sweeper, and Run and Laugh, and watch the Driver Stop the Machine, and Look around. We Had Fun !!!!!!!!! The Good Old Days !!!!!!!!! Great Memories !!!!! I'm Laughing, as I'm Writing this !!!!!!!! Talk Soon !!!!!!! Robbin.Pokey, It sounds Like to Me, that you Live in Paradise. I know there's Better places I could Live, and that Hialeah, and all of South Florida, is A Major Rat Race, But I'm settled, and in My Little Comfort Zone, so I Remain Here. Maybe, One Day, I'll Get A Belly Full of this place , and Leave. I've Been to Indianapolis, a couple of times, But probably, not to your Town. When I went To Indianapolis, I Didn't Go any Farther North. Would you Believe???, I Have never Been to Chicago , I can't Believe it myself !!!!! I've Been in 32 States, But Never in Chicago. One Day, I will Go to Chicago, though. I Must See it for Myself. I Dream Of Living in a Small Town, it Must Be Nice !!!!!!! I Love I- Hop, Dunkin Donuts, and White Castle, What could Be Better ????? I Go To Dunkin Donuts, all the time. Their Coffee, is Great, and my favorite Donut there, is; The Dunkin Donut, and The Plain Old Fashioned Donut. I Have Lost 20 Pounds Lately, not Even trying, But I should Lose some more weight, and I probably will, But I Like to Eat, and I'm not Doing Without Dunkin Donuts, Ect., That is Out Of The Question !!!!!!! When You said your Town is in themiddle of Corn Fields, it reminded me of the Great Movie-, Field Of Dreams, I Loved that Movie. I Liked Visiting Indianapolis, But I Know, like all Major Cities, They Have a Lot O Traffic, Wrecks, Crime, and It's way too Cold, for me, in the winter. And I also can Figure out; It's Best to Live on the Outskirts, or at least 30 miles out of Big Major Cities. I am tall,-- 6' 4\", But my Heaviest weight, I ever was, was a few years ago, I was 357 Pounds, But now, I'm down to 270 Pounds, and My Ideal weight, would Be; 240 Pounds, so I am close, no Problem !!!!!!! Got To Go. Talk Later. Nice To Hear From you. Robbin.Carey- Gigi, and Manocarz, I'm Doing Great, How are You Gentleman Doing ??????? Yes ,I remember the Bike Shop, on East 8th Street, just East of Palm Avenue, that was my Bike shop, where I went for Repairs, ect., and I got a Columbia 26 Inch Bike there, one year for Christmas, from my parents. I remember that place well. And the old city Hall, Remember it also, very well, The Police Station, in the Back, and upstairs, and the Fire Station, on the North End. Went there, may, many times, with my Dad, and passed there on my Bikes, all the Time. I Knew Joey Matracia, and Even had a fight, with him, shortly, before he got killed on his bike by ST. John's. He Had 2 Beautiful Sisters, and His Dad, was a Hialeah Cop, and a Real Good one. And you are correct, that's where they lived. I remember the Hialeah Police Running the Car Inspections, at Behind City Hall, and at Milander Park, out Near Palm Avenue. The Inspectors, Had Hialeah Police Uniforms on and Everything. And I Do Remember the Bike Inspections, and Decal, and I went to the Bike Shop, on East 8th Street, for mine. When we moved to where I Live now, in Northwest Hialeah, near Miami Lakes, I was 13, and my Brother, was 10, and my Grandma, Bought us Both new Schwinn Bikes, at Hialeah Schwinn Cycle Shop, at East 4th Avenue, and 41st Street. Mine was a Schwinn Jaguar, 26 Inch Custom Gold and Chrome Bike, and my Brother's was a Beautiful 20 Inch Blue Stingray. Both had white Banana Seats, and Lots of Chrome, and High Rise Handlebars. And My Bike, had the Shock Absorber on the Front for Bumps, and Dropping off Sidewalk Curbs. Don't remember, what Happened to those Bikes, I guess my parents got rid of them, whe we grew up some. I wish I had pictures of them now , but I don't. I Don't remember, the other Bicycle Death, But I remember Too Well, The Tragic Accident, of Joey Matracia, as My Grandma and I Had walked up to Eat at Royal Castle, By Flamingo Plaza, and we were walking home, ready to cross Lejeune Road, when A Hialeah Police Car Came Speeding, southbound on Lejeune, maybe 90 MPH, and it was Joe Matracia SR., enroute to His Son's Accident. I will never Forget that Day. Joey, Was in a coma, and Died, About 2 Days Later, as I Recall. Well, Gentlemen, I've Got to get ready for work, I work the 3 To 11 Shift, and it's 1: 36 now, so I must Go. We will continue, another Time. Take Care, and Best Regards, as Always. Sincerely , Robbin P. Learned.Carey- Gigi, Raymond Oliver, was a Good Friend Of Mine, in Elementary School, and in 7th Grade, at Miami Springs JR. High, also, and He Came to my House, and I went to His, on East 13th Street, the 2nd House East Of Lejeune Road. I Knew His Mom, and His Younger Brother Alex, and I Met His Dad, one Time, when He came For a visit, from San Juan, PR., where He Lived, and He Drove Us to School, at Miami Springs JR. High. Raymond was a Nice Guy, and He was My Friend, But He was a Little Crazy, and Could Be a Wild Man, sometimes. My Mom used to Go to their House, and Raymond's Mom would Cut, and Style My Mom's Hair, as Raymond's Mom was a Hair Stylist, By Trade. When we went to Miami Springs JR. High, in 1963, Raymond Beat up Ted Rivers, and Ted Rivers Brought A 38 Revolver, to school Loaded, to Get Raymond, but The word Got out, and ThePrincipals Cornered Ted Rivers, and Got The Gun. Raymond was Very Tough, and a Good Fighter, and most Kids around, were no match for Him. Raymond used to get me in Trouble, in Classes, at Hialeah Elementary, By Making Me Laugh, and I couldn't stop Laughing, and the teachers would throw me out of the class, send Me To MR. Brewer, Our Principal, and He'd Call My Father. Raymond would Make Funny Faces, or pass me a note, with a Funny Face, or something He Drew, ect. I Was Shocked, When I Heard about Raymond, when it Happened, But the 1st Thought I Had, was; Raymond Beat up some Co-Worker, and the Guy Came with a Shotgun, and Blew Him Away, for Revenge. I Remember The Diefendorf's, There was atLeast 2 Brothers; Tommy, and Eddie, and They were Real Tough Guys, Too, Weightlifters, and Boxers, I Think. A Friend of Mine, one time, was after this Girl at Hialeah Lanes, and one Day, Tommy Diefendrf, Punched Him out, as a warning to Leave The Girl Alone, I guess she was His, or He was after Her Too. My Friend was Pretty Tough too, But Tommy Diefendorf, easily Punched Him Out, Lickity Split, I Saw it, I was there. I Think I saw one time in the Paper, years ago, That Tommy Diefendorf, was in The Marine Corps, and He was a Parris Island Drill Instructor, and I Can Believe that. Ernie Cash, was a Nice Guy, I Remember Him Well. One night, He and I went Courting, at The Price Residence, on East 13th Street, 2 Houses west of Lejeune. Ernie was after Marcia Price, and I was after Dorine Price. They were Both Beautiful Girls, and That Night, We Had their Attention, under the Stars, in Front of their House. Oh, What A Night, That was !!!!!! Did you Know The Link Girls ???? DR. Link's Daughters,-- Nancy, and Linda, They were Real Pretty. What about Barbara Howell, Diane's Older Sister ???? The owners Of Village Custom and Body Shop, were The Kuznik's, when I went there, in the 50's, until 1963, and then the people Guest Said Must Have Bought it, So We were Both Correct. See Ya Later !!!! Robbin.Carey- Gigi, Hi, I Remember The Paint And Boby Shop, you Mentioned, I Should, as I Was a Little Dennis The Menace Type Nuisance, to the Owners of that place. I Only Lived A Couple of Blocks from there, and I Hung around there, all the Time. The Name of the Place, was; Village Custom And Body Shop, and the Owner was; Fred Kusnick, the old Man, and His Son Roger, who Everyone called Roc, was His Lead Man, and the 2 of them, and 1 or 2 others, did all of the work. They Did Metalflake And CandyApple Paint Jobs, And Turned Out A Lot Of Car SHow Custom Car Trophy Winners. I Personally, saw them Doing the work, and they painted my 20 inch Bike, MetalFlake Kelly Green, and it was Beautiful. And Many times, when I Got on their nerves, or they were too Busy, to Go on a Break, or Both, They would Give Me The Money, and send me to Get them Coffee, or Lunch, from The Rexall Luncheonette, across the Street, and as a Tip, They would Tell Me to Keep the Change, or To Buy Myself A Burger, and A Milkshake, and I Did . The Shop, was Next Door to The Shell Gas Station, Owned By MR. Lee Renderer, Who Looked Like Tennessee Ernie Ford. As For the Rod And Reel Place, I Remember vaguely that place, and I think the Owners names Was; Tinsler, Or Tindle, not Sure. I Remember Johnny Walker, Red Hair, and He Lived On Lejeune Road, on the East Side, at about 17th Street, and He was Sort of Tall and Slim, and their House, always Had A Bunch of Old Beat up Cars in Front. And I Remember The Big Wooden Grandstand Bleechers, at Babcock Park, on East 6th Avenue, and I used to Crawl Under those Bleachers, all the time. and Some Guys used to Take their Girlfriends For a Tour, under there, also !!!! I Remember, well, Those tall Pine Trees, Behind My Elementary School, and that Asphalt Drive way, that went from East 6th Avenue, To East 4th Avenue. A Lot of People Rode Go Karts there, on Weekends, and in the Summer. Great Memories !!!!! We Can Continue, At Another Time, Carey. Take Care !! Robbin.Pokey, I Remember Going By The Bell Haven Park, Many Times, and it Looked Pretty Big, But I Never Knew too much about it. I went to Funland Park, Many, Many times, and Rode The Wild Mouse, and My Favorite; The Bump Bump Cars Lots, and Lots of times, But It's Funny, But I Don't Remember Frank And Bun, at all !!!!! I've Heard Of it, Many times, But I Don't Remember it. I Do Remember though, The Plantation Pit BBQ, you Mentioned, and it was next Door, To the Dairy Queen, just a stone Throw north of N. W. 87th Street, on 27th Avenue, and I ate there many times, and their BBQ. was Real Good. And I Had Forgotten about The Northside Howard Johnson's, We ate there also, and I Loved Howard Johnson's 28 Flavors of Ice Cream. We also used to Buy Howard Jonson's Ice Cream. in Pint Cartons at Steven's Market, at 27th Avenue, and 62nd Street. And The Candy Counter, at Sears Northside, was Heaven, The Speckled Bags that they would put your Candy in, and the candies, Yum Yum !!!!! I Liked all of their Candy, But My Personal Favorites, were; The Chocolate Non Parels, The Chocolate Malted Balls, The White Chocolate, and the Chocolate Covered Raisins. My Dad, and I, Always Headed to The Candy Counter 1st, For Candy !!!! I used to Buy Records, upstairs, also, and My Friend, and I Used to Go To The Guitars, and Play them, and they were on the 2nd Floor also, near the Records. I also Have Record Albums, I Got there. It was neat, to Ride the Escalators, at Sears, to the 2nd Floor. Our Family, Bought Lots of things, at Sears Northside, and We All Loved that Store !!!!! My Brother, and I Had MatchBox Cars, But I Don't Have any Idea, what Happened To Them. They were Neat !!! You, and Manocarz, are the Smart ones, you saved your MatchBox Cars. I Didn't Save Anything, from my Very young Days, and I Regret that !!!!! Oh, and Pokey, I Remember, The BBQ Place, Down the Street, from Burdines Whse. It was Alabama Bill's BBQ, and My Mom took me there, Before. It was Good. It was next to Campbell's Grocery, on about 67th Street, and 32nd Avenue. Oh, and They Built a New Free Standing Walgreen's, at Northside, and in the Northside Parking Lot, on 27th Avenue, You Now Have; McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Other Fast Foods. Talk Later !!!! Robbin.Robbin\n\nYa I remember alot of the places that you mentioned, but I left the area in 1969 when the military called, and never really went back after that. I do remember the Cowboy center, The Flamingo and Morrison Cafeterias, my mother and I ate alot of time there. The Miami Heights Hotel was just up the road from our trailer park, I bougth many matchbox cars at Toby Toy store, matter a fact, I still have two of them. There was a Plantation Pit BBQ place around 95 th street and nw 27 th ave, that was the last place I ate with my girl Terri, before leaving for the military, there was another BBQ place on 32 ave and just south of the Burdines Whse, that I ate at alot. I used to go to the Carvelle Ice Cream shop on 7th ave and around 125th st.\n\nGrowing up in Bell Haven Trailer Park, we had most everything small kids could want, we had probably the largest pool in South Fla, we had a large Recreation Hall, for dances and get togethers, and plenty of room for football and baseball at the same time. We had our own barber ( Pat Oliver) , beauty shop, and store for candy, all in the park. I did however spend a lot of time at the Frank & Bun at 27th ave and 79th st with my friend Tom Worth, he had a 53 Cadillac, and I was to young to drive then, Another Friend (Little Joe Cantwell) had a nice custom 53-55 Olds, and Rickey Bird drove a candy apple red 40 Ford, this was in the late 50's. I spent aot of time at funland park too. When I started to drive, my friend Ron and I would take our girls to a new park in Ft Lauderdale called Pirates World, do you remember that.I bought most of my records at Sears in Northside Shopping Center, I remember the record section was just off the escalator on the second floor. I still have most of them and still play them, drives my kids up a wall, I still play alot of old 8-tracks too, and drive a vehile with vaccum wipers. ha ha\n\nI can remember in the early 60's when the Chevy show would come to the Northside Shopping center, then one year they had a replica of the Bonanza TV Shows Ranch house there. Ate alot of Ice Cream at the Howard Johnson resturant in the north end of the parking lot of Northside, where my friend Ron worked for a while. Then when I started driving, most of my Fri & Sat nights were spent at the 27th ave or Turnpike drive inn with my girl. Hey, Carey, Nice to Hear From You again. I just saw what you wrote about Pee Wee Fruit Drinks, in the Tiny Bottle, This very afternoon, on that Don Boyd Site, and I Left a note about Pee Wee Drinks, also. About the Red Barn, I Remember Mostly; My 3rd Grade Hialeah Elementary School Class, went on A Field Trip there, and we sat on the Grass there, and Had Little Cups of Velda Farms Vanilla Ice Cream, and Ate it with those Little flat wooden Spoons. That sounded Like a Combination, Both Exciting, and Scary, The Escape of The Gorilla. I also Remember The Circus, under a Big Tent, on 62nd Street, and 37th Avenue, where The Jefferson's Dept. Store was Later on. My Father used to Take Me , to The Circus, and Yes, I would Agree, it was around 1957, or 1958. Ah, The Good Old Carefree Days, only Go To School, and Go out and Play. Cary, Did you Go to Hialeah Elementary School ??? You Mentioned The Ice Cream Man, In our Neighborhood, in the Daytime, we Had the Small Good Humor Pickup Truck come around, and we Had a Guy on a 3 wheel Bicycle, with a Big Freezer Box, on the front, and We Had another Guy, with a 3 wheel Bicycle, selling Frehly Made Snow cones, and at Night, sometimes Late, Like 11:00 P. M., The Big Bread Truck Size Truck,---- Mister Softee, came around, and Myself, and all of our Neighborhood Kids Ran to Meet all of them, to Get Ice Cream, or Sno Cones. And Carey, Did You By any chance, Know; Alana Temple ??? She was A Beautiful Brunette, who Lived up past your House. She Lived Off East 7th Avenue, and on I Think 23rd Street. She was a little older than me, But I went to Her House To See Her, Anyway, when I wasin 6th Grade, and I think she was in 7th Grade, at Filer. We Got along Good, and She was nice to Me, But My Going there after School, Didn't Last very Long, IGuess I Woke Up !!! And Did you Know; The Price Sisters, on East 13th Street, just off Lejeune Road, on the west side of Lejeune ????? They were all 3 Beauty Queens, and They were; Dorine, Marcia, and Linda. I used to Go to their House To See Dorine, who was my age, and in my classes, at HialeahElementary School. We'll Talk again another time Carey !!! Take Care. Robbin.John Kindley, I Got your note, and it's nice to Hear from you also !!! Yes, it Has Been a Long Time, Where Does Time Go ???? I Sure Remember You, and Rudy Watson, and Rick Calvert, Dennis Skalski, John, and Tommy Haskins, and the way you Guys were such Good Friends. I Know Dan Keeps in touch, with you, and Rudy Watson, and that's Good. You Knew about Rick Calvert, and Tommy Haskins, Didn't you ??? Both are Deceased. Yes, John, I Love ********************* Go Karts, all Kinds, with Lawnmower 4 cycle 4 Stroke engines, and Fast Racing Karts, with Chainsaw, or Motorcycle 2 Cycle 2 Stroke Engines. And, I Also Love Motorcycles, and I Rode Motorcycles, and Had 2 Yamahas, Back in 1969. Back then, Dan, Had A Kawasaki 80, and I First Had A 305 CC Yamaha, similar to a 250 Big Bear, and then I Traded it in on a 350CC Yamaha. Both were Real Fast, and Fun to Ride. If, and When, I Win The Fla. Lotto, I Am Buying Myself; an RV, A Harley Fat Boy, or SoftTail Deluxe, A Big Kawasaki Ninja Type 2 Stroke, And An Italian Racing Kart, that will Hit 100 Plus MPH, and A Mercedes Benz Ml 350, or Ml 450. That's The Ticket !!!!! Nice that you Liked My Dad, so Much. He was a Great Dad, to Dan, and I, always was there for us, and He was a Great Man, always Coaching, and Having a Positive Impact on Others. My Father was a very well Liked Man, By Most Everyone, and Yes, He Had a Million Stories, to Tell, and they were Good ones. I Miss Harry Learned, Every Waking Day, and What He Said To Me, Echoes in My Head, and sometimes, when I'm Depressed, and Down in the Dumps, and Ready to Give Up, I Think oF My Father, and See His Face, and I Immediately, Say to Myself; Hey, You're Harry Learned's Son, From Good Stock, and You Can Do It, and I Feel Better, and Take Off Like A Rocket, to Carry On !!!!!!!! Dan, and I Were Very Lucky, To Have Such a Great Father . My Dad Was Tough, and Believed in Discipline, and Respect, But He Was Fair. If We Did Good, He Would Reward Us, But if we Did Bad, He Would Beat The Hell, out Of Us . Take Care John, and We'll Talk Later. Robbin.Pokey, Nice to Hear From you. You Know , I'll Bet we saw each other, many times, at all of those Wonderful Places, we went, Back in the Day. I used to go Skating.on Saturdays, at Rustic Roller Rink, after My Mom and I Went to Steven's Market, By Gladeview Elementary, and then my Mom, woul drop me off, at Rustic RR, around 11 A. M., and I'd Skate, all afternoon, there. Do you Remember, a Beautiful Blonde, who went skating there, also on Saturdays, named Josie Ritter ??? I was in Love with Her, But she was like 4 years older than me, and I admired her, from a Distance, but never even Talked to Her, But I Have never, to this Day, Forgotten Her. Back then, around 1960, I was in 4th Grade, and 9 years old, and I'm sure Josie was maybe 13, and People there told me, that she went to Robert E. Lee JR. High. And there was another older Woman, who Caught my Eye there; Priscilla Bell, from Miami Springs. Maybe you Remember Her ??? I started skating, on the sidewalk, with those Miserable, Clamp on your shoes, Steel Wheels Skates. Then I went To Rustic, and Went indoors , on the Wooden Floor, and Sharpened my Skills, and then Later, I was on the Outdoor Cement Floor, with the Big Kids, But I Sometimes went Back and forth. I Loved Rustic RR, it was a neat place to go. Later on, when we lived in our New neighborhood, near Miami Lakes, and I was in JR. High, at Palm Springs, in the Summer, The Bus from Hialeah Roller Rink, would Pick up kids, at Sparks Park, Palm Springs JR. High, Madison JR. High, and Broadmoor Elem., and take us to The Rink, to skate all afternoon, and I Loved that also. I Had lots of Fun, at Hialeah Roller Rink, too !!!!! My Brother, and I , used to Have Slot Cars also, and we went to Hobby Mart, on West 49th Street, just west of Red Road, Back in around 1967. Slot cars, Were A Lot Of Fun !!!!! Remember, Northside Shopping Center ???? It was The Greatest, in it's Day. Sears, Music Makers, Kressge's, Harvest House Cafeteria, Streeter's Bakery, The Hobby Shop there, Walgreen's , Grand Union, and The Stinky Indoor Sears Garden Shop. We used to Go To Northside, all the Time, and when I was Small, in the 50's, My Dad would take all of the Neighborhood kids, on our Street, To Funland Park, on Wenesday Nights, - Nickel night. I Do Remember Burdines Whse., My Mom worked across the Street, at Food Fair-- Pantry Pride Miami Offices, and Whse., for 35 years, and I Delivered there, and to Burdine's Cafeteria, where you worked. I was A Foodservice Truck Driver, for; Swift & Company, of Chicago, at the Time, you probably Remember our Red Swift's Premium Trucks. I Delivered to Everwhere, in Dade and Broward County, for 15 years, and it was a Hard Job, BackBreaking, with Heavy Quarters of Beef, ect. to Deliver to Publix, and All Food Places. I Delivered Fuddrucker's on US1 and S. W. 104th Street, their Beef, and the one on Federal Highway, in Ft. Laud. I Later worked for Brink's, and Wells Fargo, on the Armored Trucks. I Now work in A Security Office, in Miramar, Fla. Hopefully, I can Retire, in 8 1/2 years. In 1970, I Enlisted in The ARMY, with My Father's 45 ACP, at my Head, and spent 3 years, serving Uncle Sam, 12 Bravo MOS, Combat Engineer, BCT,- FT. Jackson, Engineer School,- FT. Leonard Wood, TDY,- Avn, South East Asia, 11 Months, Mostly near the Ventuey Air Strip, and along Highway 1. And I Still Live in Hell's 1/2 Acre,--- Hialeah, my Hometown. Se Habla Espanol. Talk To You More Later Pokey. Robbin.Pokey, Nice to Hear from You again so soon, and Thanks for the Info, about the Kart Sites, I Have Checked out a lot of them, about Vintage Karts, and Recent races, Nationally, ect. I Remember Your Clinton Engine. I Had a Kart, with a Fiberglass Body, on it, called a Track Rabbit. We Got it at Goodyear, on 27th Avenue, Just north of Northside Shopping Center, and it cost $ 300.00, in about 1958, and it had a 4 cycle.- 4 stroke Tecumseh Lawson Engine, and it was pretty fast, and Neat looking, and nice to Drive, But one thing It Had, that I Hated, was; A Hand lever Throttle, the size of one of our fingers, and it was mounted on the body, on the left side. I used to Drive it at Flamingo Plaza, over by the curb, on 10th Avenue. Oh, and it Looked Like the Vintage Walbourg 1/4, or 1/2 Midget. I Had the Track Rabbit, Before The Exterminator. My Dad Let a kid who lived on 10th Avenue, Take it for a Spin, and it Got away from Him, and He Wrecked it on the 10th Avenue Curb, and My Dad Took it to Tom Dio, The owner and Mechanic at the Lawnmower Shop, on East 4th Avenue, and about 12th Street, for Repair. Tom Had to straighten the frame, and chassis, with Heat,-Torch, and Welding. And soon after that, My Dad Sold it. Then Later, Maybe 2 years later, I talked My Grandma into buying the Exterminator, for me. I Saw it , while My Parents were Driving up on 27th Avenue, in the window, of Jim Rathman's Place. My first cart, came from Children's World, when they were In Suntan Plaza. They Had it in the window, on Display, and I Begged my Grandma, to Get it for me, and she Did. It was a Skinny Red Pipes Rail Job, Type Kart, with a Red Horizontal 2 cycle,- 2 stroke engine, To be Honest, I Don't know who made the Kart, or what the Engine Brand was, but it sounded neat, like a West Bend, or out board motor, But Boy was it slow, maybe it had a Governor, But I was Like 8 years old, and it was fun to Drive, anyway, But you could Run faster, than it went. I always Liked the West Bend , and Mac 10 Engines Best, But I Guess they are Obselete Now. Hey Pokey, I Am Enjoying our Talks. See You Later, My Friend !!!! Robbin.To: Pokey, I Had My Exterminator Kart, When I Was 11 Years Old, My Grandma, Who Always Lived with us, Spoiled My Brother, and I, and she Bought The Exterminator, for Me, at Jim Rathman's Kart Shop, On Northwest 27th Avenue, near Plager Brothers Brake Repair Place, I Think it was around N. W. 27th Street. The Kart cost a lot, even Back then, I think it was $1,000. But now, I Hear the Racing Karts Run anywhere from $ 5,000, to around $10,000. I Live Paycheck to Paycheck, Can't Afford One now, unless, I win The Florida Lotto, and I Play it, Every Wednesday, And Saturday. As For My Racing, I Did Very Little, only Tried it, a Few Times, on My Own, JR. Class, and I Signed A Waiver, and Did not Join Any Karting Club, Ect. To Be Perfectly Honest, I am not Much of a Competitor, never was. I Am not aggressive enough, fo Racing, Sports, or Much of anything. Most of the Time, I prefer, to follow, Rather than Lead. Most of my Go Kart Driving, was Done in Parking Lots, Such as; Flamingo Plaza, over By 10th Avenue, TheGreat Southern Piggyback Parking Lot, on N. W. 62nd Street, just East Of Flamingo Plaza, and Hialeah Park Race Track Parking Lots, on 21st Street, and 32nd Street. My Dad and I Both Liked just Riding the Kart, Better than Sanctioned Racing. And Our Kart Mechanic, was Tom Dio, at the Lawnmower shop, on East 4th Avenue, and about 12th Street. My Dad let His Good friend Ride My Kart, one Day at Flamingo Plaza, and He Got Going Too Fast, and Crashed into the Curb, By 10th Avenue, and the Kart Was Really Messed Up, and My Dad Got Rid Of It, and I Wanted to Cry, But My Dad Said That's That, Well That Was That, unless you wanted a Good Beating, for Questioning His Authority. Such is Life !!!!!! I Was Not A Kart Racer, Only A Kart Owner/ Driver, For Fun, But Not A Competitive Racer, Like You, And Pete Michel. I Know Pete Michel, Was A Great Kart Racer, He Was Good !!!!!! Nice To Trade Stories with You Pokey, and I will Be Thinking About the Old Neighborhood, and some More Familiar Places, and People, ect. Later !!!! RobbinJust West of Hialeah Lanes, Like 1 Block, At one time you had Karland, a Go Kart Ride Track, Owned, and Run By The Michel Family,- Pete Michel SR., Pete Michel JR., and Andy Michel. The Michels, Were Go Kart Experts, Both Mechanically, and Driving, And Most Of All,--- Go Kart Racing. The Go Kart Rides were I Think I Remember 7 Laps, for $ 1.50, and it was fun, and their Karts Were Nice, and reasonably fast, for Rental Karts. I Lived Near there, like 1 Block away, and my Brother, and I, and our Friends went there, all the time. They Did Of course Have Rules, and One of them, was no Bumping, and wrecking the Karts, And The Other one was; When your Laps were up, they would wave you in, and if you Didn't Go in, they would throw water on you, from Big 3 Gallon Buckets, full of water, that they Kept in the infield, Just For That. I Admit, I Got Soaked there, More than once. They Didn't Charge you Extra, after you Got Soaked, But I Always Pitted,---[ Went In], after the Soaking. We Thought it was Funny, at the Time. The Michels, were Real Nice People. And at one time , they also Had a Kart Shop On East 9th Street, just West of 6th Avenue. And once in a while, they Had Big Weekend Races, there, all Day Saturday, and Sunday. I Loved that, and was there Every Minute. The Kart Ride Rental Karts, all Had 4 Stroke Engines, Like Pump, or V"
