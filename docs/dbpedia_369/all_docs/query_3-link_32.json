In the past (primarily between 1910 and 1960) these were sometimes used to restrict the sale, lease, or transfer of property to specific groups based on race, religion, ethnicity, sex, disability and other groups.\n\nThese restrictive covenants against protected classes are illegal and no longer enforceable after various court rulings and legislation, beginning in 1948. Statute now allows for property owners to file a discharge disavowing past inclusion of discriminatory covenants in their property’s history (Minnesota Statute 507.18, subd. 5).\n\nThe County Board passed a resolution disavowing the use of restrictive covenants for this purpose. Read the resolution (PDF).\n\nHow to check for restrictive covenants\n\nMapping Prejudice – this is not a definitive list of properties, but it is the most comprehensive.\n\nRecent recording history search – per the County Board resolution, notice has been provided in the Abstract tract against all (both Abstract and Torrens) land potentially containing restrictive covenants in a property’s history based on Mapping Prejudice research.\n\nJust Deeds – property owners or the public can get free legal and title services, including finding and disavowing restrictive covenants.\n\nConsult a licensed abstract professional or a title company who is familiar with researching real property records.\n\nWhat to do if you find these restrictive covenants\n\nBecause restrictive covenants affecting protected classes are no longer enforceable, you can choose to do nothing, or you can act based on whether your property’s land type is abstract or Torrens.\n\nTorrens – most of these restrictive covenants have already been removed or will automatically be removed upon the next transfer of title. For information on how to remove one, see how to request an examiner's directive.\n\nAbstract – you can disavow it by contacting Just Deeds or take the following steps.\n\n1. Obtain the following information from the document containing the restrictive covenant affecting protected classes:\n\nDocument number\n\nDate of recording\n\nNames of owners\n\nLegal description\n\n2. Complete the Discharge of Restrictive Covenant Affecting Protected Classes form.\n\n3. Have the form notarized.\n\n4. Record the document with Hennepin County (See Conventional and eRecording information section). There is no fee for this type of recording.\n\nMy lender just sent me a document stating my mortgage has been satisfied (paid off) and told me I should record it, what should I do?\n\nThe document should be recorded in our office. Please look at the Recording fees section of this page to determine cost. Once the document is recorded, the original will be returned to you.\n\nI owned property with someone as a joint tenant who has died. How do I remove that person from being an owner?\n\nYou must record an Affidavit of Survivorship with a certified copy of the decedent's death certificate to have the records updated.\n\nCan I view recorded documents such as deeds, mortgages, and liens online?\n\nWe offer two online options.\n\nWhat does \"Torrens\" mean?\n\nTorrens describes land which has been registered by order of either District Court or the Examiner of Titles.\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Title?\n\nThis certificate is issued when land is registered. It contains the name of the owner, a description of the land and all encumbrances, liens and interests in which the estate of the owner is subject.\n\nHow do I get a copy of a Torrens Certificate of Title?\n\nIf you are the owner of the property you may obtain a copy for free by calling 612-348-5139. If you are not the owner of the property, a Torrens Certificate is available for fee. See the Document copy fees on this page to determine cost.\n\nCan I obtain a copy of a DD214 military separation?\n\nIf the military release is yours and it was recorded in Hennepin County after your discharge, you may obtain a copy. Federal regulations and data privacy rules require that military separations be available only to the veteran or those with a tangible interest (spouse, family member, etc.).\n\nAdditional information\n\nEmployees can ONLY review a document to make sure it contains the required elements in order to be recordable per Minnesota Statute.\n\nIf there is a well on the premises, the deed must be accompanied by a well disclosure certificate unless the face of the deed contains a statement to the effect that the number and status of the well(s) have not changed since the last recorded well disclosure certificate.\n\nEmployees of the Registrar of Titles/County Recorder cannot supply legal forms, help a submitter fill out documents, or provide legal advice. Consult your legal adviser.\n\nDownload legal forms, known as uniform conveyancing forms.\n\nOpen all"
