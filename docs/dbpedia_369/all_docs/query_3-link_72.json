They are searchable by name in these databases:\n\nLand Petitions of Lower Canada, 1764-1841\n\nLand Petitions of Upper Canada, 1763-1865 This database also includes references to land petitions found in the Upper Canada Sundries series (RG5-A1).\n\nUpper Canada Land Books\n\nAfter a petition was submitted for a grant of Crown land, the Executive Council of Upper Canada decided whether or not to grant it. The record of those decisions are in the council minutes, commonly known as the Upper Canada Land Books (RG1-L1).\n\nA list of the volumes and links to the digitized microfilm can be found on our partner website Héritage under Reference Guide: Upper Canada Land Books, 1787-1841.\n\nThe Ontario Genealogical Society indexed the records by name. A copy of that Index to the Upper Canada land books is available in the genealogy room at LAC. There is also an electronic version on one of the public computers in the room.\n\nThe actual land grants are held at the Archives of Ontario.\n\nHeir and Devisee Commission - Upper Canada\n\nThe Heir and Devisee Commission was established in 1797 to clarify the titles to lands. Records include affidavits, location certificates, powers of attorney, orders-in-council, copies of wills, deeds, testimonial letters, etc.\n\nWe hold most of the records of the first Heir and Devisee Commission, 1797 to 1804, and some of the records of the second Commission,1805 to 1854 (RG1-L5).\n\nThe records are on microfilm, arranged by district, then by type of document\n\nThere is no index by name\n\nA list of the volumes and links to the digitized microfilm are found on our partner website Héritage under Reference Guide: The Heir and Devisee Commission, 1777-1854. A detailed description of the content of each volume can be found at the start of each microfilm.\n\nOther Heir and Devisee records, 1797 to 1911, are held at the Archives of Ontario.\n\nGaspé Land Commission\n\nThese records relate to land claims in the Gaspé region of Quebec (RG1-L7). They are searchable in our Gaspé Land Commission — names of claimants, 1819-1825 database.\n\nLand documents, Registrar General\n\nThis series in RG68 consists of 213 volumes of originals and copies of leases, deeds, grants, surrenders, sales, letters patent and other documents relating to:\n\nCrown and Clergy Reserve lands\n\nIndian and Ordnance lands\n\nDominion lands\n\nThe documents relate to Quebec and Ontario, mostly in the late 1700s to the late 1800s. The microfilm is digitized on Héritage.\n\nThe RG68 volumes of Dominion lands sales in Manitoba in the 1870s are searchable by name in our Land Grants of Western Canada, 1870-1930 database.\n\nLand grants\n\nLand grants usually consist of a one-page document with the following details:\n\nthe name of the grantee\n\ndescription of the land\n\ndate granted\n\nQuebec\n\nStarting in 1763, new lands were granted according to the township system. In 1891, a list was published of Crown land grants and sales in each township. We have a microfiche copy of that List of lands granted by the crown in the Province of Quebec from 1763 to 31st December, 1890.\n\nThat publication is also digitized on our partner website Canadiana. There are two parts. The section by county and township starts on image 28. The alphabetical index of names starts on image 1159.\n\nThe list provides details that identify a document, for example:\n\nBook Z Grants, page 175\n\nBook AG Sales, page 79\n\nWe also have a copy of an alphabetical index created by the Quebec Family History Society. That index is available on a public computer in the genealogy room and through our computer access to Ancestry.\n\nThe actual land grants were given to the grantees. Copies of the grants were recorded in registers called Entrybooks, which are held at Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ).\n\nLAC has microfilm copies of those BAnQ Entrybooks for the years 1788 to 1867 (MG8-A26). In the fonds description, there is a link to the Finding aid. Use the lists in the finding aid to find the microfilm number that corresponds to the land book you are interested in.\n\nWestern Canada\n\nLands granted in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the railway belt of British Columbia are searchable in our Land Grants of Western Canada, 1870-1930 database. It includes references to land grants (patents) found in these series:\n\nRegistrar General (RG68)\n\nLand Patents Branch (RG15)\n\nScrip records\n\nScrip was a document, warrant or certificate that entitled the holder to a certain allotment of crown lands. These certificates allowed the Department of the Interior to grant land without specifying the actual piece of land involved.\n\nMost of these records relate to Métis Nation people in western Canada. Information about the records and how to search them is found in Métis scrip records.\n\nOther scrip was granted to members of the North West Mounted Police and military veterans.\n\nLand patents, Indian and Inuit Affairs Program\n\nThese are copies of land patents issued mostly to non-Indigenous people for former Indian reserve lands, 1886-1951 (RG10). In the series description, there is information about the records and the finding aids.\n\nMaps\n\nMaps can help you find land locations, such as lot and concession numbers in Quebec and Ontaro. Here are two examples:\n\nMap of the Township of Nepean in the District of Bathurst and Province of Upper Canada, 1830\n\nRistigouche, comté de Bonaventure, 1910\n\nHere is a map showing the townships, ranges and meridians in the western provinces.
