As the two types of stores in the two maps below demonstrate.\n\nHave a taste for new and used records, CDs and tapes? Calgary music stores include a wide variety of music CD places ready to meet your needs.\n\nCheck out The Inner Sleeve or Sloth Records for instance. Both of these stores carry the best in hip-hop, rock and punk.\n\nFor a more classic sound, go to Classics Plus, which features a terrific assortment of jazz, opera, ballet and classical music on CD and DVD.\n\nSimilarly, if you're looking for a place to exchange or sell your CDs and maybe add a few rare records to your collection, head to Urban Sound Exchange or Tramps. Tramps Music Books and Games will try to take care of all your entertainment needs as well, so make sure you have a few hours to spare when you go in.\n\nHere is a complete listing of Calgary music stores shown on the CD and record store map below.\n\n1 Stop CD DVD Duplication Replication\n\n403-266-6336\n\n100-111 5 Ave SE\n\nSloth Records\n\n403-265-6585\n\n1508 4 Street SW\n\nPhonics Sounds\n\n403-229-2836\n\n329A 17 Avenue SW\n\nWarner Music Canada\n\n403-259-3000\n\n608-108 15 Avenue SE\n\nHot Wax Records\n\n403-283-0055\n\n114 10 Street NW\n\nNew Age Books & Crystals\n\n403-270-7272\n\n142 10 Street NW\n\nClassics Plus\n\n403-290-1182\n\n1134 8 Avenue SW\n\nMegatunes\n\n403-229-3022\n\n932 17 Avenue SW\n\nTramps Music Books & Games\n\n403-270-2030\n\n117-1805 14 Street SW\n\nRecordland Ltd\n\n403-262-3839\n\n1208 9 Avenue SE\n\nCanada Disc\n\n403-277-9292\n\n7-215 36 Avenue NE\n\nRevolution Games & Music Inc\n\n403-282-5200\n\n100-3400 14 Street NW\n\nThe Inner Sleeve\n\n403-242-9899\n\n111-3411 20 Street SW\n\nThe Tape House Media Supply\n\n403-219-3211\n\n1155 44 Avenue SE\n\nMelodiya Records\n\n403-246-8916\n\n2523A 17 Avenue SW\n\nSelf Connection Books Inc\n\n403-284-1486\n\n4004 19 Street NW\n\nThe Screen Shop\n\n403-243-3662\n\n1382 Hastings Crescent SE\n\nCD Trader Ltd\n\n403-220-9470\n\n306-3630 Brentwood Road NW\n\nCash Converters\n\n403-252-2897\n\n180 94 Avenue SE\n\nTramps Music Books & Games\n\n403-255-5652\n\n290-9737 MacLeod Trail SW\n\nA & B Sound\n\n403-293-5000\n\n3320 20 Avenue NE\n\nEquant Canada Inc\n\n403-640-4700\n\n1130-10655 Southport Road SW\n\nPlay Entertainment\n\n403-202-1774\n\nMarket Mall\n\nCash Converters\n\n403-207-0101\n\n4002 17 Avenue SE\n\nUrban Sound Exchange\n\n403-547-3822\n\n53 Crowfoot Terrace NW\n\nCD Plus Partnership\n\n403-948-4874\n\n105A-505 Main Street South , Airdrie\n\nPlease Note: We also have several chain retailers not mentioned above.

They're located together in Calgary.\n\nWith Long and McQuade you can get a standard of quality no matter where you are.
