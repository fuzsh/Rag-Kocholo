        "text": "the version of \"treetop flyer\" on \"just roll tape\" is a dobro if i'm not mistaken. that is what causes the high tinny sound.\n\nrenny\n\nThe use of dobro points to a 1975 or 1976 era demo because I don't think Stills messed around with the dobro much after the mid-70s. His voice is rough, but that may not mean anything. In general, his studio vocals in 76 and 77 were pretty smooth (for him). A couple rough nights could result in that voice though. He seems to slur a couple words, but he's done that ever since the beginning. I don't think the recording is Stills Alone era.\n\nYou know I've been thinking about this for days now Chief, and I was absolutely convinced you were wrong - there were only 3 channels of TV in the UK in the 70's and the BBC were just 2 of them. I simply couldn't see them putting aside 3 hours of TV for a CSNY concert in the staid 70's...\n\nFinally I found this BBC Programme Catalogue website, and serching it for David Crosby (to catch all the things he has been in - a better search than 'CSNY' for instance) gives this: David Crosby (musician).\n\nSo, I'm still convinced it comes from Nash personal collection as Wikipedia (that ever reliable source!!!) says:\n\n'For certain fans, Nash's unreleased film of the Wembley Stadium concert of September 14 attests to the excellence of this material, even though none of it ever appeared in a definitive CSN or CSNY studio format.'\n\nHere's an all purpose question for the all purpose CSN thread:\n\nI've always thought that towards the end of S:JBE Stills' sings: Lacy lilting lady, losing love lamenting...\n\nAnd that is what I have seen posted on lyric & tab websites on the net too...\n\n(though bizarelly one site had it as: Lacy, lilting, leery, losing love, lamenting !)*\n\nAnyway, I've just listened to the CSN boxSet version (with drums) and he most definitely sings: Lacy lilting lyric, losing love lamenting...\n\nAnd then I went back and listened to the Couch album version and I'll be damned if it isn't 'lyric' on that too!\n\nHow come it's taken me 14 years to notice that?\n\n*mind you, if you look at it with the commas in, that actually makes lyrical sense - well kind of\n\nGood interview, maybe it clears a few things up:\n\nOn Wooden Ships:\n\nOn Treetop Flyer:\n\nWell, there is only 100 minutes or so, not the entire show. The quality is pretty shoddy. I still think it was filmed by the BBC, if not simulcast. That could be faulty memory on my part. I'll try to find my source on this. It's just that in all the years of following these guys, I never heard of this (or anything) leaking from Nash's collection.\n\nI think Stills considered \"Treetop Flyer\" to be one of his \"special songs\", the ones he reserved for either CSN or CSNY. It was pulled out for Stills-Young, and the aborted CSNY reunion. Then it was tried out during the CSN sessions as well as the sessions in 1978 for the CSN album that didn't happen. After 1978 I can imagine that the song never found a home because it just didn't sound like anything else Stills was doing between 78-90. However, it was again rehearsed for After The Storm.\n\nI can't imagine that Crosby and Nash have ever considered this tune as a CSN song, it appears in fact in the CSN DVD \"Daylight Again\" but is performed by Stills solo playing acoustic guitar. A band version was featured in the CSN concerts from 96 (appears on a b**t called Hartford) but C&N didn't play nor sing on it. Keyboard player Michael Finnigan sang some harmonies on it, and the CSN band played on it but no C&Nl. I'd like to hear how this CSN version, rehearsed for After The Storm sounded like.\n\nThanks! Just E-mailed a seller about the used CD. Asked him which version he was selling. Hoping Barry Diament's credits are inside the booklet as they are in most if not all other Atlantic CDs that he mastered.\n\nOnce again, WHO mastered the original Deja Vu CD? Thank you.\n\nCan't say I noticed his eyes being closed that much. I couldn't get past how bad his voice was! I haven't heard a performer from that period sound so bad since I caught a recent Van Morrison spot on TV a while back. Maybe their friends should tell them. Anyway, \"Helplessly Hoping\" just doesn't sound right without the vocal harmony. My $.02."
