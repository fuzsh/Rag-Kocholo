        "text": "Summary of the invention\n\nIn view of the above-mentioned problems, the object of the present invention is to provide a kind of method of promoting the decipher disk location, to solve the problem that its land pre-pit of each disc is produced when not of uniform size.The present invention is the mode that utilize to see through appropriate change pre-pit cleavage standard (pre-pit slicing level), with in response to its land pre-pit of each disc situation not of uniform size, reaches and cuts to correct land pre-pit.Also therefore be able to decipher to correct pre-pit information, avoid making the mistake message and burning failure.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a kind of device of promoting the decipher disk location, time and cost waste during with solution burning discs.The present invention need not change under the prerequisite of hardware design, and the position that sees through appropriate change pre-pit cutter (pre-pit slicer) is accurate, arrives correct pre-pit information, avoid making the mistake message and burning failure with decipher.\n\nAccording to above-described purpose, the present invention discloses a kind of method of promoting the decipher disk location, comprising provides a main frame to seek the rail order in order to carry out an interface, seeking the rail order by interface starts one and servoly seeks rail action, adjust one first pre-pit cleavage standard and make and servoly seek rail action decipher to an absolute position, start from the absolute position one servo follow the rail action and adjust one second pre-pit cleavage standard make and servoly follow rail action decipher to a target location.\n\nA kind of method of promoting the decipher disk location comprises:\n\nOne main frame is provided, and wherein this main frame is sought the rail order in order to carry out an interface;\n\nStart one and servoly seek rail (seek) action, wherein should servoly seek rail and move and seek the rail order by this interface and controlled;\n\nAdjusting one first pre-pit cleavage standard makes this servo rail of seeking move decipher to an absolute position;\n\nStarting a servo rail (follow) that follows from this absolute position moves; And\n\nAdjusting one second pre-pit cleavage standard makes this servo rail that follows move decipher to a target location.\n\nThe method of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard comprises:\n\nWhen this is servo when seeking rail action decipher less than this absolute position;\n\nAdjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard moves to restart this servo rail of seeking; And confirm servoly to seek rail and move whether this absolute position is arrived in decipher.\n\nThe method of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard repeats repeatedly to move decipher to this absolute position up to this servo rail of seeking.\n\nThe method of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this second pre-pit cleavage standard comprises:\n\nWhen this is servo when following rail action decipher less than this target location;\n\nAdjust this second pre-pit cleavage standard and seek the rail order to re-execute this interface;\n\nStart this and servoly seek rail action, wherein should servoly seek rail and move and seek the rail order by this interface and controlled;\n\nAdjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard makes this servo rail of seeking move decipher to this absolute position;\n\nStart this servo rail that follows moves from this absolute position; And\n\nConfirm that this servo rail that follows moves whether decipher to this target location.\n\nThe method of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this second pre-pit cleavage standard can repeat repeatedly to move decipher to this target location up to this servo rail that follows.\n\nA kind of device of promoting the decipher disk location comprises:\n\nOne main frame is sought the rail order in order to carry out an interface;\n\nOne servo-drive system device is servoly sought rail action and and is servoly followed the rail action in order to start one, wherein should servoly seek the servo rail that follows of rail action and this and move and seek the rail order by this interface and controlled;\n\nOne recording medium is controlled by this servo-drive system device;\n\nOne optically read burning device is controlled by this servo-drive system device;\n\nOne pre-pit pick-up unit, in order to adjust one first pre-pit cleavage standard make this servo seek rail action decipher on this recording medium an absolute position and adjust one second pre-pit cleavage standard and make this servo target location of rail action decipher on this recording medium of following.\n\nThe device of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard comprises:\n\nWhen this is servo when seeking rail action decipher less than this absolute position;\n\nAdjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard moves to restart this servo rail of seeking; And\n\nConfirm that this servo rail of seeking moves whether decipher to this absolute position.\n\nThe device of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard can repeat repeatedly servoly to seek the rail action and separate this absolute position up to this.\n\nThe device of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this second pre-pit cleavage standard comprises:\n\nWhen this is servo when following rail action decipher less than this target location;\n\nAdjust this second pre-pit cleavage standard and seek the rail order to re-execute this interface;\n\nStart this and servoly seek rail action, wherein should servoly seek rail and move and seek the rail order by this interface and controlled;\n\nAdjusting this first pre-pit cleavage standard makes this servo rail of seeking move decipher to this absolute position;\n\nStart this servo rail that follows moves from this absolute position; And\n\nConfirm that this servo rail that follows moves whether decipher to this target location.\n\nThe device of described enhancement decipher disk location, the step of wherein adjusting this second pre-pit cleavage standard can repeat repeatedly to move decipher to this target location up to this servo rail that follows.\n\nThe device of described enhancement decipher disk location, wherein this pre-pit pick-up unit comprises a pre-pit cutter."
