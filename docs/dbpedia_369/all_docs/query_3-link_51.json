        "text": "Appointments are strongly suggested.\n\nAlthough many COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, we still limit the number of customers in our office. For that reason, it is best to schedule an appointment for service. We will accept walk-in customers if there are open time slots. You won't be able to wait on the floor until a slot becomes available.\n\nThe first appointments of the day are at 8:30 AM and the last appointments are at 4:00 PM. To schedule an appointment, select the Schedule Appointmentbutton. You will be directed to the appointment calendar. Select the specific service you need (record, search, or kiosk) and enter the required information. Please note that the 30 minute appointment slots are strictly for high volume customers recording five to 25 documents during the appointment. Other customers can record up to five documents during a 15 minute appointment. Only one person per appointment may enter the office. If you need assistance scheduling the appointment, call 313-224-5860.\n\nCustomers who plan to record a document should read the information under the Document Recording tab before scheduling an appointment. Your document must comply with the recording requirements and you must pay the correct fees and taxes. If not, we won't be able to record the document. Also, unless an exemption applies, deeds, land contracts and plats must be \"tax-certified\" by the Wayne County Treasurer before they can be recorded.\n\nBernard J. Youngblood, Wayne County Register of Deeds"
