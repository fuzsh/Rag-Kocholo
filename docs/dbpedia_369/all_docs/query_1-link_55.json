        "text": "Neil Young / The Visitor (vinyl LP)\n\nNeil Young‘s 39th studio album, The Visitor, recorded with The Promise of The Real is released on vinyl this week.\n\nDavid Bowie / Beauty and the Beast\n\nYou can’t say no to this Beauty and the Beast seven-inch picture disc, especially if you’ve been collecting all these 40th anniversary David Bowie singles from the start!\n\nThom Yorke / Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes\n\nArtists like Radiohead and Thom Yorke often try to make some kind of statement by releasing their music unconventionally but they always end up on the oh-so-unfashionable CD in the end! This 2014 solo album was originally issued by “paid-for BitTorrent bundle”. A vinyl reissue came out in December last year and here’s the compact disc…\n\nArcade Fire / The Suburbs (vinyl LP)\n\nVinyl reissue of the Arcade Fire‘s third album, originally issued in 2010.\n\nLeonard Cohen / Ten New Songs (vinyl LP)\n\nLeonard Cohen‘s tenth studio album was issued in 2001. There was a gap of nine years between this and its predecessor The Future (songs from which had featured in Oliver Stone’s film Natural Born Killers). The length between albums was partly explained by a five years of seclusion at the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles, where Cohen was ordained as a Zen Buddhist monk. This is a vinyl reissue of Ten New Songs.\n\nJed Kurzel / The Babadook original film score (vinyl LP)\n\nWaxwork Records issue Jed Kurzel’s score to Jennifer Kent’s 2014 psychological horror film, The Babadook. Would highly recommend the film [independent, filmed on a budget], which I think is on Netflix. Don’t watch it on your own!\n\nNico Muhly / Howards End original series soundtrack (CD)\n\nMore soundtracks. This time Milan release Nico Muhly’s music to the recent (and rather good) BBC adaptation of E.M. Forster’s Howards End.\n\nSign Up For the SDE newsletter"
