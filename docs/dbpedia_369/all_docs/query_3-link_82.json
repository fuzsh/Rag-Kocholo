ROD.\n\nMany property documents, plus Property Alert and Veterans services, are accessible by our new mobile app.\n\nFrom property owners to mortgage and title companies to Veterans, those served by the Davidson County Register of Deeds Office now have a mobile app to access many of the office’s services. Available on the app are the Property Alert for guarding against fraud and the Thank a Veteran program.\n\nYou can sign up on the app for our Property Alert service, which notifies you by email if any document is filed in our office under your name. Our Veterans already record their DD214 honorable discharge papers with us in person.\n\nThe app gives veterans access to a list of local restaurants, stores, and other businesses that give Veterans a discount. And businesses that want to be included on the discount list can register on the app.\n\nAdditionally, the app offers access to online Voter Registration, a fee calculator for Register of Deeds services, and buttons for instantly contacting the Register’s staff by phone or email.\n\nThe Davidson County Register of Deeds office is the custodian of all documents relating to the property – warranty deeds, deeds of trust, releases, powers of attorney, liens, property plats, and other records designated by state law. The app now makes a number of these documents available on mobile devices.\n\nThe app is not designed to replace our experienced staff. We are still available in person for one-on-one assistance, and by phone and email to answer questions and assist with any part of recording or accessing your property documents.\n\nAbout Register Karen Johnson\n\nKaren Johnson is the third Davidson County Register of Deeds of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.
