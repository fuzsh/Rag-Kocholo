        "text": "Hey Friend,\n\nAs promised, All Corn and Soy Free (CSF) chicken inventory is loaded, Shop today for orders pick up this Saturday at the farm or the farmers market.\n\nA couple of notes on this first batch of birds:\n\nGrowth was exceptional, but some of the birds are bigger than we like which means the boneless, skinless breasts may be bigger than you like. A great meal prep batch however.\n\nWhole birds - Same very large. Great roasting birds to squirrel away.\n\nFewer CSF birds, which means that inventory will exhaust first.\n\nNext harvest is Late July.\n\nRead a June Update on Cathy's Battle here in the LBF BLOG.\n\nEat Better, Live Longer. Make sure you are logged into the fullfillment choice you want. The website will keep you logged into the your last order's fullfillment choice.\n\nYou can change your fullfillment choice in the olive drab banner above the landing page picture of me and Cathy.\n\nWe will be at the Knoxville Market every Saturday. This is an orders pick up location too.\n\nOrders pick up on the farm every Saturday.\n\nNext Home delivery window is 27 June."
