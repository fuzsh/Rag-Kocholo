        "text": "Extended hanging out with out-of-town relatives, a Myrtle Beach vacation, and last-minute prep before leaving for college were consuming my days forty-two years ago. Songs from some of the albums listed below filled my head at the time, too—let’s check ’em out.\n\nArticle\n\nThis was a “Speaker Special” issue, with a couple of pieces on the latest and finest to increase your listening pleasure. Rather than say any more about that, though, I’ll point out that Popular Music Briefs (a section I overlook far too often in these writeups) highlights recent appearances in NYC by Tommy Tutone and Linda & Richard Thompson, and also makes note of a couple of actresses getting into the record biz (Pia Zadora’s new release and Sissy Spacek’s new contract).\n\nThis month’s reviewers are Chris Albertson, Noel Coppage, Phyl Garland, Paul Kresh, Mark Peel, Peter Reilly, Steve Simels, and Joel Vance.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n—Fathers and Sons (CA) Ellis Marsalis plays with Wynton and Branford on side one, while Von Freeman gets together with Chico on side two. “This new album is, of course, based on a kind of gimmick, but the result happens to justify the means, and both groups generate sounds that rise about the occasion.”\n\n–Dolly Parton, Heartbreak Express (NC) “…so full of Dolly Parton that it suggests she has made some sort of accommodation to her voice or is resigned to getting the most out of her discomfort. But the best things about it, compared with other recent albums, is that Dolly sounds like she means it.”\n\nRecordings of Special Merit\n\n–Bobby Bare, Ain’t Got Nothin’ to Lose (NC) “(Bare) has a big, natural-sounding baritone and uses phrasing that seems nonchalant but is actually teeming with nuance…obviously in his prime.”\n\n—Cat People soundtrack (PK) “…the initial tension is sustained right up through the final strange, sensuous note. If the movie is half as good as the score, it must really be something.”\n\n–Tim Hardin, Unforgiven (NC) Hardin died of a heroin overdose in late December 1980, leaving this unfinished work. “All the songs have both depth and a light touch, plus the grace dancers shoot for. This album is a great relief from Top 40 tedium—and, of course, a must if you identify with beautiful losers.”\n\n–Ray Parker, Jr., The Other Woman (PG) “But Parker can also be coolly sophisticated; the slower numbers here give him ample space to come across like the matinee idol his good looks might qualify him to be.”\n\n–Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels, Live 1973 (NC) “The record is an honest piece of work that seems to value simplicity the way Einstein did when he said to keep things as simple as possible—and not one bit simpler.”\n\n–Third World, You’ve Got the Power (MP) “Third World isn’t any less authentic for being accessible or less worth hearing for wanting to be widely heard…proves that reggae can be ‘palatable’ and powerful.”\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\n–Five new doo-wop releases by acts from the past on a new label, Ambient Sound: The Capris, the Harptones, the Jive Five, the Mystics, and Randy and the Rainbows (JV) “…together, they make a convincing case for the enduring value of ‘traditional rock and roll.’”\n\n–Peabo Bryson, I Am Love (PG) “There are lyrical passages more than a little reminiscent of the early Johnny Mathis, phrasing drawn directly from black gospel music, and overall a stylishness of presentation comparable to that of the finest popular singers of any era, from Sinatra and Bennett to Streisand and Flack.”\n\n–Haircut One Hundred, Pelican West (MP) “Half of (this album) would sound just right blaring through the doors of a Greenwich Village record shop specializing in New Wave; the other half might be heard at a salsa shop in the Times Square subway station. Yet the feel of each part spills into the other.”\n\n—Stars of the Streets, two volumes of NYC street music (MP) “Between them, they capture the music of seventy sidewalk stars—and the freedom, the merriment, the uncompromised and unselfconscious communication of music made in the streets.”\n\n–Art Tatum, Pieces of Eight (CA) “And if you already have some Tatum on your shelf, even if you have an abundance, you ought to make room for this album.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Asia, S/T (MP) “Here are guitar riffs that grip you by the primitive brain stem and jerk your head and feet around, blistering solos sure to give rise to an epidemic of contorted facial expressions and involuntary spasms, and the kind of pure, almost angelic electronically assisted vocal harmonies that can turn a listening experience into a religious experience.”\n\n–Laura Branigan, Branigan (PR) “…brings a lot more sincerity and a lot more vocal talent than most disco singers do, and she often achieves real communication with the listener. Considering the material she’s been given to work with…that’s no small achievement.”\n\n–Ornette Coleman, Of Human Feelings (CA) “…Coleman plunges his alto saxophone into a sea of often robotic funk. The effect can be quite mesmerizing, but the music also begins to lose definition after a while, and the repetitious rhythm makes me wish someone would give the throttle a good yank.”\n\n–John Cougar, American Fool (JV) “(His) trite material tells tales of bleeding hearts, flaming crotches, and lives of loud desperation…It’s all supposed to be dramatic, like the pretentious album title, but what it amounts to is cheeseburger.”\n\n–Godley & Creme, Snack Attack (JV) “…their primary task is to translate their visual sense of texture and bitter humor into sound. The ambition—the gall—of their ideas is what makes their work continually interesting.”\n\n–The Human League, Dare (SS) “Unlike their more melancholic colleagues—Joy Division, say, or the unspeakably tedious Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark—the Human League deals in catchy pop fluff (though it’s mechanical to a fault) with generally intelligent lyrics. Overall they suggest a punk version of ABBA.”\n\n—The Kids from Fame (PR) “The pitch is that these kids are just loaded with talent and waiting to be recognized. Don’t you believe it.”\n\n–Greg Kihn Band, Kihntinued (JV) “He and his group remind me somewhat of NRBQ; they’re not nearly as rowdy but have a comfortable self-assurance, as though they’re not looking for a hit but simply playing the music they like best.” I began typing this up last Thursday, hours before the news of Kihn’s death broke. RIP to a guy who gave us some fun tunes.\n\n–Melissa Manchester, Hey Ricky (PR) “Someone has apparently decided that it is time for Melissa Manchester to get with it. Well, someone ought to have his head examined. I was never a big Manchester fan, but to hear her talents used so wastefully disturbs even me.”\n\n–Rick Springfield, Success Hasn’t Spoiled Me Yet (JV) “I suspect that between road tours with his band and taping his appearances as Dr. Noah Drake on the soap opera General Hospital, Springfield just doesn’t have time to write better material.”\n\n–Utopia, Swing to the Right (JV) Rundgren’s continuing misfortune—for he is a talented artist—is that the focus of his work is blurred by his urge to flamboyance, overacting, and overreliance on technical gimmicks. (This album) is typically ambitious, ambiguous, and unresolved.”\n\nThis past weekend I listened to the 7/9/83 AT40, a fine, fine collection of tunes. While that was not the inspiration for choosing this issue for revisiting, I do notice that four albums below had hits on that show (and four others had already produced Top 40 hits or soon would). We start, though, by looking at something that wouldn’t be on my radar for at least a couple of years.\n\nArticles\n\nSR Tests 11 Digital Compact Disk Players, by Julian Hirsch\n\nA nascent technology begins to make its presence felt, for about $1000. “…some of these CD players are like many current cassette decks in which the manifold capabilities of the microprocessor are being exploited without much regard to utility or even desirability…my experience with these players has convinced me that the CD system is the greatest advance in home sound reproduction since the switch from the acoustic to the electrically amplified phonograph.”\n\nHow to Buy a CD Player, by David Ranada\n\nNot wholly unlike tips we encountered for portable cassette players in the March ’86 issue from earlier this year, our author suggests testing objects of desire in-store with shocks (tapping on the player while it’s operating) and defective disks (fingerprints or mimicking scratches with Scotch tape).\n\nOur reviewers this month are the usual lot: Chris Albertson, Phyl Garland, Alanna Nash, Mark Peel, Peter Reilly, Steve Simels, and Joel Vance.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Lou Reed, Legendary Hearts (SS) “…another shot of the hard stuff, rock-and-roll so passionately felt and stripped down that it makes most of what’s on the radio these days seem like so much aural flatulence.”\n\n–Simon & Bard Group, Tear It Up (MP) “…full of inventive themes, counter-themes, and abrupt tempo changes that make (the songs) as interesting to hear the twentieth time around as the first.”\n\n–Mel Tillis, After All This Time (AN) “…shows he’s back to normal now,…back to performing his own special brand of uptown honky-tonk…a smart blend of styles ranging from pre-World War II country swing to modern country-pop.”\n\nRecordings of Special Merit\n\n–Ellen Foley, Another Breath (JV) “Of all the rock chantoosies, Ellen Foley has the best voice, takes more risks with different types of material, and tries harder to get better with each album.”\n\n–Greg Kihn Band, Kihnspiracy (MP) “Just about everything on (this album) has the familiar feel of a spin across the FM dial. But before passing sentence, consider that Kihn’s piracy is also great rock-‘n’-roll.”\n\n–Nick Lowe, The Abominable Showman (SS) “That’s not to say that this is a soul record; it’s as patently insincere as anything Lowe has done in the past…But the song models (he) is gently trashing this time come more from Motown and Stax than the usual Brit Invasion sources.”\n\n–Marian McPartland, Personal Choice (PR) “For the last decade or so, (she) has recorded a series of albums that in singleness of vision, adherence to a self-developed style, and austerity of musical impulse can only be compared to those of the late classical pianist Glenn Gould.”\n\n–Pete Townshend, Scoop (SS) “(His) disappointing Eighties output aside, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that he’s the most important figure to have emerged from the whole British rock explosion…”\n\n—Porter Wagoner, Viva (AN) “…it just goes to show that Porter, once considered the last of the hillbillies, has made the Hollywood transition with his integrity—and sincerity—intact.”\n\n–Muddy Waters, Rolling Stone (JV) “…a sampling of his twenty-year association with the great Chess label of Chicago, for which he made most of his best recordings…a moonshine-and-champagne collection for fans and connoisseurs alike.”\n\n–Weather Report, Procession (MP) “There is no new ground broken here…(b)ut considering how much ground-breaking work the group has done over the years, I’d say that’s enough to recommend any album.”\n\n–Jackie Wilson, The Jackie Wilson Story (JV) “(His) pure tone, bravura all-stops-out vocal tricks, and great timing gave him a distinctive style. Some of the cuts here are hopelessly, even ludicrously, dated by their period arrangements, but Wilson’s performances transcend the decades.”\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\n–David Bowie, Let’s Dance (MP) “The surprise is that what’s new here is emotion—not the tortured identity crisis of some exile from Mars or the world-weariness of a gigolo but a simple, almost old-fashioned hunger for real love in the real world.”\n\n–Champaign, Modern Heart (PG) “…far more eclectic in approach, offering a diversity of styles and genres…(t)hrough all the variety, the quality of songwriting and performance is consistently first-rate.”\n\n–Bireli LaGrene, 15 (CA) “…plays more guitar on each track that you’ll hear in all of punk and a good deal of rock…(h)is dexterous manipulation of the strings is dazzling, and when you combine that with a fertile, thoroughly musical imagination…you have a feast for any pair of ears.”\n\n–Sly and the Family Stone, Ain’t But the One Way (JV) “Everything we valued in his old work is restored: the long, teasing horn lines, the syncopated organ playing, the orchestrated ensemble vocals, and the pixieish humor.”\n\n–Gene Watson with the Farewell Party Band, Sometimes I Get Lucky (AN) “His songs are tough, wiry little numbers with something specific to say. An uncommonly smooth vocalist, Watson approaches each tune the way an actor approaches a role, with individual attention and passion.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Bryan Adams, Cuts Like a Knife (MP) “Besides grinding out the same minimal melodic ideas and stale guitar riffs over and over, Adams is positively relentless on the subject of romance: he’s giving women ultimatums and waking up to his own mistakes all over the place.”\n\n–The Bangles, S/T (MP) “It could pass as an artifact of the garage-band era, hook-happy Mersey-beat tunes and cracking adolescent harmonies, cheerily incompetent blues harp and maracas…and the usual tinny production.” Somehow, I have never investigated this pre-Michael Steele EP. That has got to change, and soon.\n\n–Berlin, Pleasure Victim (MP) “The album’s lyrics and rife with touching and feeling—including a bit smashing cutting, and hurting—and with those long, wordless goodbyes that were the only aspect of relationships besides sex that disco ever seemed to notice.”\n\n–Martin Briley, One Night with a Stranger (JV) “He’s not strong on melody, but he knows how to craft a tune for greatest effect. Vocally he sounds like Gerry Rafferty with fangs. Most of his songs deal with faithless lovers and the stupidity of investing faith in lovers, all of whom are selfish and sleazy.”\n\n–Eric Clapton, Money and Cigarettes (JV) “(He) continues to sing in a bluesy voice that’s more acquired than felt, but the shared guitar romps with (Ry) Cooder make this a very enjoyable album.”\n\n–Nona Hendryx, Nona (MP) “The only problem is that amid all the irresistible rhythm and spine-tingling electronics, Hendryx becomes something of a nonentity…(s)he could be replaced with any capable back-up singer and we’d never miss her.”\n\n–Men At Work, Cargo (MP) “…it’s got the same basic strengths as its predecessor: accomplished melody writing and clean, bracing arrangements. The length to which (they) will go to graft a good, hummable tune on an otherwise trivial bit of fluff…shows real dedication.”\n\n–Night Ranger, Dawn Patrol (MP) “Though wholly conventional, (this album) delivers plenty of revved-up thrills: clean yet ferocious, white-knuckled solos running roughshod over a thundering groundswell of fuzztone rhythm and bass, dueling leading guitars, and vocals that sound as if they’re being sung by a star…”\n\n–Kenny Rogers, We’ve Got Tonight (AN) “The problem is, the arrangements are so vacuum-packed and lifeless as to smother whatever fires Rogers tries to start…the result is an album of sophisticated, easy-listening, zombie music.”\n\n–Soft Cell, The Art of Falling Apart (MP) “Ball’s ‘arrangements’ are either dull or jumbled messes of stodgy percussion and droopy layers of synthesizer sound that are as apt to collide as to cohere. Almond’s vocals are even worse: flat, affected, and utterly without a sense of rhythm.”\n\n–The Temptations, Surface Thrills (CA) “Some forty albums and countless in-person appearances later, the group is still on top…a thoroughly fine album that shows the Temps in excellent form and contains enough good material to make listening from beginning to end a worthwhile experience.”\n\nStill catching up from a busy end o’ the semester on things I wanted to publish earlier…\n\nI was steaming toward the three-quarter pole of my undergraduate college life; by the end of the month, I’d be taking a course in Environmental Philosophy for May Term. I probably saw The Breakfast Club that month and it wouldn’t surprise me if Stop Making Sense was the midnight movie at the Kentucky Theater one Saturday night, too. As for the latest issue of SR that had arrived in Dad’s mailbox, awaiting my next visit home? Let’s check it out.\n\nArticle\n\nRock Gender Benders, by Steve Simels\n\nExcerpts from his then-upcoming book Gender Chameleons: Androgyny in Rock ‘n’ Roll that veer from Bolan to Bowie to Reed, from Alice Cooper to the New York Dolls to Patti Smith.\n\nOur reviewers this month are Chris Albertson, Phyl Garland, Louis Meredith, Alanna Nash, Mark Peel, Peter Reilly, and Steve Simels.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Welcome to the Pleasuredome (MP) “…an invitation to chuck the conventions and morality and inhibitions of a bankrupt civilization in favor of the pursuit of pleasure…Under the brilliant hand of producer Trevor Horn, Frankie’s music is richly layered and compellingly rhythmic, a frenzy of sweaty rhythm chords, pounding percussion, and raw vocals that are colored with elaborate sound and special effects.”\n\n–Los Lobos, How Will the Wolf Survive? (SS) “It’s as rooted a pop record as I’ve heard in ages, a nearly flawless mix of styles you’d have thought were rendered hopelessly old hat by the current wave of overproduced synth-pop ironists. Yet here it all manages to sound fresh, heartfelt, and up to date.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Big Country, Steeltown (SS) “Yes, the imitation-bagpipe effects remain impressive, and yes, the overall sound—an evocative mixture of Celtic roots and heavy-metal—is still likable. Mostly, though, what we get here is a lot of pointless riffing, aimless non-tunes, and gargantuan overproduction.”\n\n–Captain Sensible, A Day in the Life of…Captain Sensible (SS) “You hear echoes of Ian Dury’s Cockney r-&-b, unrepentantly straight disco, Beatlesesque whimsey and psychedelia, and even Rodgers and Hammerstein…Unfortunately, you also hear Sensible himself, and his affectedly flat working-class twang is nowhere near as charming as it intends to be.”\n\n–Judy Collins, Home Again (AN) “…she has lost me of late. I don’t hear much emotional involvement from her any more, nor anything of much musical interest either.”\n\n–Gail Davies, Where Is a Woman to Go (AN) “Davies is producing with sharp, bold strokes, bringing in only the instruments she wants, and only when she wants them…There are only a handful of country artists who want to see their music grow instead of just branch out, and Gail Davies is one of them. Give her a listen.”\n\n–Bob Dylan, Real Live (SS) “The recording, despite the efforts of genius producer Glyn Johns, sounds as if it had been phoned in via a bad satellite connection, and the star himself sounds alternately uninvolved or desperately overtired.”\n\n–Barry Gibb, Now Voyager (PR) “…he radiates the oily assurance of a guy convinced he has the Formula. He doesn’t.”\n\n–Steve Goodman, Santa Ana Winds (AN) “…a generous reminder of his splendid gift for spotting society strolling along with its slip hanging out.”\n\n—The Gospel at Colonus (AN) “…a remarkable tapestry woven out of ultra-cool pop, funk, blues, and gospel that shimmers with hallelujah frenzy…Punctuated by swaying soul and dynamic doo-wop, at least six of the numbers are guaranteed to get even the most acrid, dried-up curmudgeon on his feet seeking salvation.”\n\n–John Hartford, Gum Tree Canoe (AN) “Hartford and legendary gonzo producer Jack Clement have created a multicolored sampler of the American musical heritage that spans more than a century and evokes as many moods and tempos and styles as you are ever likely to find on one album.”\n\n–Rebbie Jackson, Centipede (PR) “…sounds like five or six other well-known singers at various times but never enough like an identifiable self to generate more than the mildest interest.”\n\n–Cleo Laine, Cleo at Carnegie—The 10th Anniversary Concert (PG) “Evergreens like ‘Any Place I Hang My Hat,’ ‘Georgia on My Mind,’ and ‘Stardust’ are pruned into fascinating new shapes by (husband John) Dankworth’s arrangements…There is a special excitement in the way the two of them engage in musical exchanges, trading increasingly demanding solos note for venturesome note.”\n\n–Madonna, Like a Virgin (MP) “Whether you like (this album) has nothing to do with the music and everything to do with whether you perceive Madonna as a tough, terrifically sexy graduate of the streets or as successful entertainment packaging.”\n\n–Barry Manilow, 2:00 AM Paradise Café (PR) “…with this new release he has become a genuine pop-music star of the first rank…He’s taken the set-‘em-up-Joe style of delivery and placed it securely in an Eighties idiom.”\n\n–Reba McEntire, My Kind of Country (AN) “If she keeps coming up with performances—and song material—as strong as this, she’ll be one of the Big Ones soon.”\n\n–Jean-Luc Ponty, Open Mind (CA) “…immerses his considerable talent in a swamp of synthesizers, letting it rise occasionally only to dissipate, as if in an ever-shifting wind.”\n\n–Elvis Presley, A Golden Celebration (AN) “There are a couple of ways to react to the package. One is to laud RCA for excavating some truly revelatory material and for bringing much of Presley’s historic, seminal work together. The other, however, is to admonish the company for using the anniversary to pick over the bones of what is already a pretty stripped-clean skeleton and for labeling every unreleased scrap of tape a ‘treasure.’”\n\n–Ramones, Too Tough to Die (SS) “Still, most of the album is the same listless, going-through-the-motions guitar thrash these guys have been dishing out since they got upstaged by the New Wave.”\n\n—Revenge of the Killer B’s (SS) “Here’s yet another collection of oddities and B sides rescued from the Warner Brothers vaults…for my money the less experimental things come off better than the more self-consciously modernist entries.”\n\nVideo Reviews\n\n–Bryan Adams, Reckless (LM) “Not only have you seen it all before, but you’ll wish you hadn’t.”\n\n–Kim Carnes, S/T (CA) “Video producers too often ignore the lyrics and dish out silly visual accompaniments, but that is not the case here.”\n\n–Phil Collins, Live at Perkins Palace (CA) “Collins is not a great singer, but he has a certain magnetism that comes through on this set.”\n\n–Hall and Oates: The Daryl Hall and John Oates Video Collection—7 Big Ones (LM) “Given that Hall and Oates are, as the liner notes maintain, the most popular duo in rock history, you’d think their videos would be slightly less banal than the rest of the canned brain damage you get on MTV. And on the basis of this particular collection, it seems that they are—slightly.”\n\n–Styx, Caught in the Act (CA) “If you aren’t totally gaga about this group (I mean, to the point where fan loyalty has impaired your senses), I suspect you will be embarrassed by the dreadful bit of drama that has Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw fighting against a Big Brother type who has banned rock-and-roll.”\n\nWith this edition of SRIR, we’ve taken a look at 25% of the issues from each of the years 1977-1988 (with a couple others outside that range). A fourth cycle through will start next time.\n\nThis issue takes me back to the halcyon days of my senior year of college. Some albums covered were producing Top 40 hits in that moment; others would come to my attention within a couple of years.\n\nArticles\n\nPocket Stereo, by Fred Petras\n\nAn overview of the current state of the market for portable radio and cassette players, the top end represented by a tricked-out, $350 Walkman (pictured). Shopping advice is included: “To insure that a set will function well while you’re jogging, hold it at your side as you briefly run in place on the sales floor. If the sound fades in and out or ‘wobbles’ in any way, don’t buy.”\n\nAlanna Nash Interviews Joni Mitchell\n\nMitchell’s hitting the promo circuit for her recent album Dog Eat Dog, and Nash gives a semi-review of it, too. Mitchell: “A strong emotion—either a misunderstanding or a need to comprehend yourself—drives you to sit up all night to plumb the depth of your being. It’s only rewarding when the muse coughs up something that has the right sound, as well as confirmation and content.” Nash: “Some of the shiny, austere sounds on the album…have been criticized as ‘aural flash.’ But there is an appropriate uneasiness to this music, the effects lending the lyrics a power they would not have on their own.”\n\nOur reviewers this month are Chris Albertson, Phyl Garland, Alanna Nash, Mark Peel, and Steve Simels. Peter Reilly is on the masthead but nowhere to be found within.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Johnny Cash, Rainbow (AN) “…presents Cash as an artist who’s above categorization in popular music and, surprisingly, as a singer who has improved so much…that you could chart his growth on paper…(w)hile we never doubt for a moment that Cash understands, or even knows, the characters in the songs, he hovers slightly above them, like the narrator in Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, so as not to block our own connections with them.”\n\n–Bob Dylan, Biograph (SS) “…despite the memorial air that hangs over the project, it’s a nearly flawless tribute to an artist who deserves no less…there isn’t a cut here that is less than interesting, either as a window into Dylan’s compositional method or simply as music.” I ripped a bunch of songs from the Urbana public library CD copy of Biograph to cassette, calling the result “Selected Bob Dylan”–the song below is the one I remember best from that effort.\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Asia, Astra (MP) “From the lyric sheet, it seems that half the songs on this deeply mediocre record are about nuclear Armageddon, and half are about love. I challenge anyone to listen to the album blindfolded and tell me which are which.”\n\n–Big Daddy, Meanwhile…Back in the States (SS) “…continues the charming conceit of (their) first album—that the band is an authentic bunch of Fifties rockers, imprisoned for twenty-four years by Communist rebels, who now play contemporary songs in the only style they know. It may be a one-joke act, but it has a surprising resonance.”\n\n–Angela Bofill, Tell Me Tomorrow (PG) “The best songs are usually the ones she writes herself; the only trouble with this album is that there aren’t enough Bofill originals.”\n\n–Bronski Beat, Hundreds and Thousands (MP) “Fully representative of (their) strengths and weaknesses, the music has remarkable rhythmic verve and displays an imaginative shuffling of styles, from Jazz Age swing to machine-age Giorgio Moroder dance music to African frum music.”\n\n–Jimmy Buffett, Last Mango in Paris (AN) “While the image of Buffett the witty, whimsical tunesmith has lingered through the years…his new album shows him capable of a full range of emotions…”\n\n–Elton John, Ice on Fire (MP) “…filled with everything but surprises…(f)ortunately, the tunes Elton zings off are inappropriately cheerful and energetic now and then.”\n\n—Miami Vice (PG) “…it’s probably the best compilation of its type since the soundtrack from Saturday Night Fever helped to breathe new life into the record industry a few years ago.”\n\n–Ray Parker Jr., Sex and the Single Man (PG) “Parker is careful to change the pace occasionally…but on the whole, this album will appeal mostly to the perpetual-motion crowd.”\n\n–Sade, Promise (MP) “…doesn’t have the quite the edge of Diamond Life had, but it’s likely to win new devotees nonetheless, chiefly because it’s very much like that debut—a collection of cushiony, soft-focus soul, jazz, and Latin settings for Sade Adu’s translucent, experessive, fragile vocals.”\n\n–Simple Minds, Once Upon a Time (MP) “..so strongly suggests both U2 and (Billy) Idol that it comes as a bit of a revelation…(t)he difference is that Simple Minds makes technically polished, gut-wrenching power rock without striking a pose—political, pornographic, or otherwise.” This cassette was a frequent companion in the car on trips between Illinois and Kentucky in the early grad school days.\n\n–Spandau Ballet, The Singles Collection (MP) “…a pretty good sampler of songs by a group that has kept getting better, even if its New Romantic sound is on the outs.”\n\n—Swing Reunion (CA) A Book-of-the Month Club multi-disk set of a concert by “seven musicians whose names are synonymous with jazz of the unlabored, fiercely swinging kind”—Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Red Norvo, Remo Palmier, Freddie Green, George Duvivier, and Louis Bellson.\n\n–10,000 Maniacs, The Wishing Chair (SS) “…difficult to pigeonhole stylistically, veering among New Wave eccentricity, the neo-Byrdsian stylings of R.E.M., and a Celtic folk sound that recalls Fairport Convention. Their songs are personal, thoughtful, and uncommon…(y)et none of it seems at all precious.” Probably my biggest concert-related regret was failing to see Merchant and company open for R.E.M. on their Fables of the Reconstruction tour in the fall of ’85.\n\n–Jane Weidlin, S/T (SS) “Whereas her Go-Go’s work was adorably rough-edged…these new songs have a case of terminal glamour.”\n\n–Hank Williams, On the Air (AN) “…gives us a relaxed and close-up portrait of Williams, who comes across as an easygoing, folksy hillbilly boy instead of a stiff and distanced legend.”\n\n–Bobby Womack, So Many Rivers (PG) “While so many veteran singers have buried their talents under a barrage of electronic effects and faddish noise, Womack has remained true to his art, emphasizing sweet melody and deep expressiveness.”\n\nThis was my second winter in Champaign-Urbana, the one spent in the apartment on Elm St., just a stone’s throw from downtown Urbana and the Lincoln Square Mall. Sinéad O’Connor’s The Lion and the Cobra was the album I was spinning more often than any other in the moment. By this time, I wasn’t driving over to the public library in Champaign to leaf through the pages of SR anymore; what did I miss as 1988 dawned?\n\nArticles\n\n—Hit List, by Ian G. Masters\n\nIn which the author comes to grips with how to use a Mac to catalog the pop/rock songs in his collection (which come from 78s, 45s, LPs, and CDs). Masters goes into excruciating detail about the process; it sounds as if he used a word processing program (as opposed to using a spreadsheet or database) to attack the problem.\n\n—Alanna Nash Interviews Holly Near\n\nKnown to this point for her activist work and protest music, Near changes gears to record and release Don’t Look Back, “a sparkling, upbeat set of original love songs with a bold musical framework” that Nash calls “Near’s most cohesive and consistently satisfying record to date.”\n\nThis month’s reviewers are the skeleton crew of Chris Albertson, Phyl Garland, Alanna Nash, Mark Peel, and Steve Simels, along with a future staffer adding a few free-lance pieces.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Bruce Springsteen, Tunnel of Love (SS) “…may not be the stuff that arena rock shows are made of, but it cuts a lot closer to the bone than anything the man has done before…”\n\n–Sting, …Nothing Like the Sun (MP) “Sting has shed the mantle of the artiste. He has turned over much of the album to his band, and the players respond with intensity and expressiveness…(i)f it is less monumental than we expected, it is also less controlled and calculated.” Among the first couple dozen or so CDs I purchased, straight from Columbia House.\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n—Atlantic Jazz (CA) Twelve compilation disks (a few are double-LPs) taken from the label’s archives, thematically grouped: New Orleans, Kansas City, Bebop, West Coast, Mainstream, Post Bop, Singers, Piano, Soul, The Avant-Garde, Introspection, and Fusion.\n\n–Beat Farmers, The Pursuit of Happiness (SS) “Neither the presence of legendary keyboardist Nicky Hopkins nor the one good song, Tom Waits’s ‘Rosie,’ can alleviate the aura of uninspired competence that is the album’s principal distinguishing characteristic.”\n\n–Bee Gees, ESP (MP) “The important thing is that the group chose to forge ahead in the record business, and they made a pretty good pop album in the process.”\n\n—Carousel (Roy Hemming) “…may not displace the original-Broadway-cast or movie-soundtrack albums, but it does offer more of Carousel’s great score than any earlier version, plus clearly superior sonics…”\n\n–Terence Trent D’Arby, Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby (MP) “But as this debut album demonstrates, he isn’t content to work the soul fields; he is determined to wed that voice to music that is tough and uncompromising. Trouble is, he misses about as often as he hits.”\n\n–Rosie Flores, S/T (AN) “…isn’t the heralding debut that, say, Emmylou Harris’s was a decade ago. But Flores brings enough of the right elements together, and somewhere down the line she just may prove herself a contender.”\n\n–Jennifer Holliday, Get Close to My Love (PG) “Her treatment (of ‘Givin’ Up’) is rooted in the Aretha Franklin tradition, with a gospel-style piano for support, but the awesome intensity of the interpretation is entirely her own. This cut, at least, is Holliday at her best.”\n\n–Lynyrd Skynyrd, Legend (MP) “But even second-class Lynyrd Skynyrd will sound good to that big Southern contingent that’s badly underrepresented on the rock charts these days.”\n\n–John Cougar Mellencamp, The Lonesome Jubilee (SS) “…the overall sense of quiet desperation sometimes verges on affectation. But strictly as music, this is an impressive piece of work, especially from a guy who used to bill himself, with commendable candor, as an American Fool.”\n\n–Liza Minnelli, At Carnegie Hall (Roy Hemming) “At times Minnelli strives too hard to fulfill her audience’s expectations…(b)ut these momentary lapses can easily be forgiven when the music making is as sizzlingly exciting as it is here.”\n\n—My Fair Lady (Roy Hemming) “Though none of the new cast surpasses Andrews, Harrison, Holloway, and the rest of the original company, this is a loverly version of a great show.”\n\n–New Grass Revival, Hold to a Dream (AN) “Whether the band can fully conform to the constraints of commercial radio and still meet its standards of excellence and invention remains to be seen. Meanwhile (this album)…strikes a beautiful balance between innovation and tradition.”\n\n–Diane Schuur, And the Count Basie Orchestra (CA) “I hope Schuur eventually finds the way from her current overheated delivery to a more personal style…(b)ut the band sounds good, and there is much to like on this album.”\n\n–The Smiths, Strangeways, Here We Come (MP) “I imagine Marr spinning out these wonderful guitar arpeggios and twisting, odd chord progressions—and all the time nervously watching Morrissey out of the corner of his eye, hoping that the Smiths’ tormented singer doesn’t come at him with an axe.”\n\n–10000 Maniacs, In My Tribe (SS) “Although lead singer Natalie Merchant makes haunting vocal noises, and the band’s playing retains the right kind of rough edges, you keep waiting for something concrete to connect with.” Well, we’ll just agree to disagree on this one, which is easily one of my five favorite albums of 1987.\n\n–Tom Verlaine, Flash Light (SS) “This latest has all the requisite virtues and vices: superbly sympathetic back-up playing, maddening oblique lyrics, totally unpredictable song structures, and gorgeous layered guitar work by the star.”\n\n–Jesse Colin Young, The Highway Is for Heroes (AN) “Mainly, however, this is a predictable progression from Young as California hippie to Young as displaced, disillusioned dreamer, Eighties style—a man desperate to make a connection in his life and in his music, and pathetically unsure of how he got so far astray.”\n\nBy mid-fall of 1984, my friend Mark H and I were falling hard for the game of bridge, self-teaching through hours of dealing, bidding, and playing, never minding that it was often just the two of us trying to learn a four-person game. Often, but not always. That fall and winter we occasionally did battle with Michelle and Jim over at Jim’s house on a Friday or Saturday evening. Michelle, Mark, and I had met Jim over the summer, working at the computing camp for grades 7-12 that Transy ran (he was an alum from a few years earlier who would be attending grad school in CS in the fall and was serving as the head counselor). It wouldn’t surprise me in the least if the four of us had gotten together on the last weekend of that October.\n\nAs for what was in Stereo Review at the time? Let’s take a look.\n\nArticle\n\nAlanna Nash Interviews Exile\n\nNash catches up with the band as they’re recording Kentucky Hearts, their second LP after transitioning from soft rock to country (the album would soon reach #1 on the Country chart and spawn three #1 Country singles). Between “Kiss You All Over” and this moment of ascension, they’d served as a bowling alley bar band in Lexington (having originated in the mid-60s in Richmond, about 25 miles south of Lex). Leader/co-vocalist J.P. Pennington: “I think if we’re helping country music at all, we’re helping to bring it a little more toward the middle.”\n\nThis month’s reviewers are Chris Albertson, Louis Meredith, Alanna Nash, Mark Peel, Peter Reilly, and Steve Simels.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Prince, Purple Rain (MP) “Although Prince may plead, seduce, chide, and promise all over the record, this really is a party album, an orgy of searing electric guitar and calliope-cranking synthesizers, played with the frenzy of a band trying to raise this month’s rent.”\n\n–Hank Williams, Jr., Major Moves (AN) “He is still singing about the same old things, but he is presenting them in a fresh, new, creative way, experimenting not only in terms of approach, but in style…(this album) signifies that Hank Jr. has finally come of age.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Bangles, All Over the Place (MP) “It’s not until you listen to the lyrics that it really sinks in: how different a woman’s perspective can make otherwise familiar rock-and-roll sound…The Bangles aren’t a great girl band or a great garage band. They’re just a great band.” I regularly claim that All Over the Place is one of my ten favorite albums of all-time.\n\n–Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Goodbye Cruel World (SS) “The emotions are built in, rather than felt, and his phrasing is on automatic pilot, with the passion obviously programmed.”\n\n–Josie Cotton, From the Hip (PR) “On the remainder of the album, she whizzes through…with all the noisy hauteur of a Tex-Mex waitress explaining the menu to a party of Eskimos. I’m not that hungry.”\n\n–Echo & the Bunnymen, Ocean Rain (MP) “The temptation is to think ‘major work,’ so unusual and original is this music, but it’s also repetitive, excessively dramatic, and unintentionally hilarious…not nearly as important as it sounds.”\n\n–Eddy Grant, Going for Broke (MP) “…frankly, it’s a pleasant change to find reggae this well recorded. But if you’re looking for something beyond entertainment, you won’t find it here.”\n\n–The Jacksons, Victory (MP) “…sounds disappointingly like a dry run for the Jacksons’ tour, a chance for each brother to take a turn in the spotlight and for each to cash a royalty check.”\n\n–Waylon Jennings, Never Could Toe the Mark (AN) “Like Hank Williams, Jr., Waylon almost runs that no-strings-attached, ramblin’ man stuff into the ground, but he gets away with it by doing it so convincingly.” I saw Waylon in concert with high school friends Tony and Bill in the summer of ’84; I have no recollection as to what if anything he might have played from this album.\n\n–Elton John, Breaking Hearts (MP) “…an unadventurous but dauntingly professional outing, the kind only big leaguers like the Stones and Rod Stewart can pull off.”\n\n–David Knopfler, Release (MP) “…may find himself in the company of Dave Davies, Tom Fogerty, Bob Crosby, and Wilhelm Friedrich Bach as the brother no one remembers, but (this) can stand on its own as accomplished and often very affecting rock.”\n\n—Repo Man soundtrack (SS) “…features various obnoxious noises provided by a cross-section of hard-core California punk bands, and much of it is both amusing and kinetically exciting.” James bought this album sometime during that ’84-’85 junior year and I know he played it in the dorm room (particularly the song featured below) from time to time.\n\n–Sheila E., In the Glamorous Life (PR) “As a singer she has a sassy, flamboyant approach that beautifully zings…and as an instrumentalist she has a rhythm and a beat that could induce a cast-iron statue to begin tapping its foot.”\n\n–Style Council, My Ever Changing Moods (SS) “(Paul) Weller and his colleague Mick Talbot aren’t so much interested in aping old Stax/Volt or Jimmy Smith records as they seem to be with mating easily recognizable genre riffs with lyrics reflecting their current personal politics, which are understatedly humanist and a big improvement over the Jam’s haranguing.”\n\n–Tina Turner, Private Dancer (CA) “(Her) talent is not just undiminished, but in greater abundance than before. The proof lies in the grooves of (this album), and this is one good Turner than deserves another, and another.”\n\nVideo Reviews\n\n–Eurthymics, Sweet Dreams (LM) “But all in all, Lennox and Stewart’s vaguely ominous brand of synth-pop Jacques Brel doesn’t seem to translate in a live concert.”\n\n–Barry Manilow, In Concert at the Greek Theatre (CA) A 1978 show now released on LaserDisc. “I must confess that I am not a fan, but Manilow knows how to entertain, and when he applies that talent to a varied program of likable songs, his vocal weaknesses seem to matter little.”\n\n–Diana Ross, In Concert (LM) A 1979 Vegas show now released on LaserDisc. “…all of this is as slick and glitzy as humanly and financially possible. As spectacle, it can’t be faulted. Emotionally, however, it’s as numbing and showbiz-phony as the comparable show you might get from Wayne Newton or Jerry Vale.”\n\n—\n\nFor a while Jim and I were good friends. That changed over time; we weren’t much in touch after my first couple of years of grad school. When I moved back to Lexington in 1992, we talked on the phone once or twice, but I neglected to follow up. In the interim he had gone to dentistry school and eventually moved out of state to practice. A little over a week ago I learned through Mark’s wife Lana on Facebook that Jim had passed away, having been ill for a couple of years.\n\n(In the blank book that James’s then-gf Stacey gave me for Christmas 1984, one of the few entries I penned was about 10 people who “played a significant role in my life” for the year just ending. Two were Transy faculty—one each in political science and English—and the other eight friends/peers. I’ve learned in writing this up that the English prof passed away early last month; Jim’s death makes three of the eight contemporaries that are now gone.)\n\nI’m very sorry about Jim’s passing from this world. I do have feelings of regret over not ever reaching back out, over now having lost the opportunity ever to do so, but I recognize there’s no one to blame but myself. I am sad for Jim’s loved ones and friends, wishing them peace as they grieve, and hoping that Jim found great joy and fulfillment over the years.\n\nLast time out in this series, the number of albums written up in July 1987 was fairly small and I blurbed almost all of them. The late 70s/early 80s issues were stuffed much fuller with goodies; as many as I’m covering here today, plenty are being left out.\n\nThe early fall of ’81, like so many seasons from my relative youth, carries its own distinctive aura in my head. It was the start of my senior year in HS and an AOR moment, packed with the likes of the Moodies’ Long Distance Voyager and the Sherbs’ The Skill. There’s a certain production style in rock music, one I’d call sterile for lack of a better word, that I now pick up on music from the period, particularly if I’ve not heard it before—for instance, efforts by Great Buildings and L.A. that appear in the issue but not below. (Side note: if you click on the links, the vids feature the respective album covers—can’t possibly know if I saw either of these on the racks in Recordland at Florence Mall, but they sure look the part for the times. Oh, and the L.A. track is the better one.)\n\nAnyway. As mentioned, this issue is in many ways an embarrassment of riches, both in music featured and fun quotes—let’s get it started.\n\nArticle\n\nThere’s an extended report on new products on the way that were on display at June’s Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, but I’d rather hit a highlight by Steve Simels in the Popular Music Briefs section, an extended note on REO Speedwagon’s excellent year. “The question, of course, is why? It should be emphasized that Hi Infidelity, given the limitations of the genre (metal with pop overtones) is a very pleasant record; in fact, as Top-40 fodder goes, it’s much better than it needs to be. But any claims that it is more substantial than MOR are ridiculous.” He goes on to report on an interview with Kevin Cronin and Gary Richrath. Cronin: “I don’t think, five years ago, I could’ve written ‘Keep on Loving You.’ Plus, we’ve gotten better as producers.”\n\nThis month’s reviewers are Chris Albertson, Irv Cohn, Noel Coppage, Phyl Garland, Paul Kresh, Peter Reilly, Steve Simels, and Joel Vance.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Kitty and the Haywoods, Excuse Me, I’ve Got a Life to Catch (PG) “…from the very first listening, the album made a snug home for itself in that cushiony part of my psyche that responds to sweet, old-fashioned soul singing…”\n\n—Woman of the Year (PK) “(Fred) Ebb has outdone himself—in such numbers as ‘I Wrote the Book’ and the title song—in supplying words of witty topicality for (Lauren) Bacall to put over in her inimitable chalumeau register.”\n\nRecordings of Special Merit\n\n–Karen Akers, Introducing Karen Akers (PR) “…sounds like a born cabaret singer in the tradition of Felicia Sanders and all those other ladies of the late Fifties who used to enliven the Manhattan night scene…”\n\n–Ernestine Anderson, Never Make Your Move Too Soon (CA) “…handles a song as if Sarah Vaughan had just tossed it her way with instructions to be gentle.”\n\n–Cameo, Knights of the Sound Table (IC) “Their music is far more organized than the funky extravaganzas of, say, Parliament. But it’s far freer—more progressive—than the laundered productions of groups like Chic.”\n\n–Guy Clark, The South Coast of Texas (NC) “The production of this album, by Rodney Crowell, is stripped clean to the bone, as Hemingway said language should be, and not only will you want to listen to every sound that remains in it…you’ll be able to hear it with no interference whatsoever.”\n\n–Bruce Cockburn, Résumé (NC) “The music is airy and bright and mostly acoustic; the attitude behind the running commentary on the passing scene seems coy sometimes, but the lyric style is both inventive and polished.”\n\n–Spider, Between the Lines (JV) “Where most bands would be monotonous, Spider riffs the way old jazz bands did—they put meat on the bone.”\n\n–Sylvester, Too Hot to Sleep (IC) “…the album as a whole reinforces my respect for him as an arranger/producer.

But the shock of seeing something this good and this smart produced for the home video market is rather disarming…Certainly no one working in the rock-and-roll ballpark has come up with anything remotely as entertaining, and comparisons with what’s available on commercial television are simply pointless.”\n\n—The Secret Policemen’s Ball—The Music (SS) The soundtrack to the 1979 event raising money for Amnesty International. “…an artistic triumph for all concerned, and you couldn’t contribute to a more deserving cause regardless of your politics.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Billy and the Beaters, S/T (NC) “Four saxophones in one group is too damned many saxophones…I think a smaller combo could have done the same thing better, but inflation never sleeps.”\n\n–Teresa Brewer, A Sophisticated Lady (CA) “…not the year’s greatest tribute to Ellington, but it is a worthy one.”\n\n–Kim Carnes, Mistaken Identity (NC) “…has the vocal equivalent of bedroom eyes, possibly owing to the same kind of throat damage that Rod Stewart has suffered, but the songs—both hers and other people’s—deal only with the surface of things.”\n\n–The Chipmunks, Urban Chipmunk (SS) “In fact, now that I think of it, this may be turn out to be a two-joke act, the second joke being that since these songs are not at all defaced by the ridiculous gimmick of the Chipmunks’ electronically speeded-up singing, we may have come to the grim realization that mainstream country is as bland, plastic, and soulless as any other musical genre that gets played on the radio a lot.”\n\n–Randy Crawford, Secret Combination (PG) “…this sort of merely pleasant fare is hardly challenging to a young woman who could grow into a major singer if she ever got the chance.”\n\n–Peter Frampton, Breaking All the Rules (SS) “…not at all unpleasant, or even particularly forced sounding, merely unmemorable…I say the guy should hire himself out as a sideman and be done with it.”\n\n–Robert Gordon, Are You Gonna Be the One (NC) “Technically, Gordon is fairly well equipped, but, since parody doesn’t seem to be his intent, he needs to work on projecting a presence that isn’t quite so arch.”\n\n–Tom Johnston, Still Feels Good (NC) “I’d never go so far as to say Doobies should be smoked and not heard—but I’d defend your right to say it.”\n\n–Kraftwerk, Computer-World (IC) “…filled with attractive sounds as well as provocative ideas, and how many records can you say that about these days?”\n\n–David Lindley, El Rayo-X (NC) “But it’s a likable little record. The songs are carefree, lazy, and whimsical. Lindley sings about as well as Joe Walsh and in a similar sort of controlled nasal whine.”\n\n–Chuck Mangione, Tarantella (PR) “Mangione provides some solid entertainment…but much of the rest is more of a reflection of a dominant personality and bottomless energy than rof real music making.”\n\n–The Psychedelic Furs, Talk Talk Talk (SS) “In short, this is another instant bargain-bin classic from the Brave New World of post-punk modernism, but I must confess that I rather enjoy the Furs’ trashiness. Potential hit single: ‘Pretty in Pink.’ ”\n\n–Lee Ritenour, Rit (JV) “I suspect that Ritenour is looking for an ingratiating sound that will ease him into the big time à la George Benson, but right now he sounds like a fancy lounge act on the Los Angeles steakhouse circuit.”\n\n–G.E. Smith, In the World (JV) “This is an album to file, but not to forget. Who knows what he may do next?”\n\n–Squeeze, East Side Story (JV) “Their character studies of fools and losers are dreary rather than satirical, the vocals and arrangements are as sparse as the sentiments, and the lyrics, though quite literate and detailed, read like the report of a psychologist who has given up on his patients.”\n\n–Jim Steinman, Bad for Good (JV) “Steinman attempts to be sensual, mystical, and violent, but his songs are little more than collections of clichés and his singing is ludicrously melodramatic.”\n\n–Bram Tchaikovsky, Funland (NC) “The thing reminds me of an adult cereal packaged for kids—say, Product 19 behind Frankenberry graphics.”\n\n–Sarah Vaughan, Songs of the Beatles (PK) “Sarah Vaughan is so much Sarah Vaughan that I expected her to Vaughanise the Beatles the same as she has the music of most other popular composers. I had not reckoned with strong personalities of the songs themselves…”\n\nSo many potential cuts to share…I’m limiting myself here more than I want.\n\nThere are fewer reviews on offer in this issue than sometimes; you’re getting snippets from a very high percentage of them.

(Mitchell) Froom took (Neil) Finn’s bright, slightly eccentric pop sound, which some call New Zealand’s answer to the Beatles, mixed in a little chaos…and turned the band from nice, Rubber Soul pop to edgy, White Album hysterics.”\n\n–Fleetwood Mac, Tango in the Night (SS) “…the lion’s share of the credit must go to Lindsey Buckingham, who wrote most of the album’s best material and co-produced all of it. Buckingham is that rarest of rare birds in rock, an accessible eccentric, and while his work on Tango does not come near his almost dangerously off-the-wall solo albums, he remains as unpredictable as ever.”\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\n–The Breakfast Club, S/T (MP) “…blends two musical strains: Stephen Bray’s Detroit funk and Dan Gilroy’s New York art-school rock…Although Art is not what the Breakfast Club is about, Gilroy’s art-rock background makes for lyrics that are considerably smarter than your average dance music’s.”\n\n–Courtney Pine, Journey to the Urge Within (CA) “The annotator of Pine’s latest album… refers to the ‘Wynton Marsalis Factor.’ The truth is that Wynton Marsalis has quite a way to go before he will become the jazz player Courtney Pine already is.”\n\n–Dwight Yoakam, Hillbilly Deluxe (AN) “…should manage to thrill his following and calm the nerves of those who liked what they originally heard but feared Yoakam was just a trendy Rhinestone Cowboy—more concerned with flash and faux Nudie suits than substance.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Gregory Abbott, Shake You Down (PG) “This is his set all the way, since he wrote all the songs and arrangements, served as producer, and played keyboard while doing the lead vocals. It’s a very impressive achievement, indicating depth as well as polish.”\n\n–Lou Ann Barton, Forbidden Tones (SS) “…she’s come up with a first-rate, slightly bluesier version of Marti Jones’s recent, similarly excellent Match Game. Barton sings the pants off a nicely chosen set of top-drawer pop and soul tunes, including one of the better Beatles covers in memory (‘Every Little Thing’)…”\n\n–Benny Goodman, The RCA Victor Years (CA) Sixteen disks, 252 tunes, “containing everything the famous bandleader recorded for the company between 1935 and 1939…(t)he music, as one might expect from a collection of this scope, is of mixed quality, ranging from slightly-above-average pop fare of the Thirties to certified jazz masterpieces.”\n\n–The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Live at Winterland (SS) “A forgotten 1968 concert that had been moldering in the vaults, the set features the Experience just before boredom, personality clashes, and drug abuse snuffed out the collective fire. The music really sounds like they meant it.”\n\n–Chris Isaak, S/T (SS) “A collection of edgy love songs that suggest the emotional universe encountered on old Roy Orbison records, it’s a beautifully crafted re-creation of the emotional paranoia underlying a lot of genuine rockabilly.”\n\n–Grace Jones, Inside Story (PG) “Indeed, there is something odd about most of these melodies, but they are beautifully arranged and meticulously delivered. I’m still not certain what Inside Story is about, but with Grace Jones it’s often better not to question what’s happening.”\n\n–Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, Trio (AN) “…not the masterpiece we expected. It is, however, a gorgeous sampler of female harmony singing and thrilling instrumental solos…as well as a monument to perseverance and a celebration of enduring friendship.”\n\n–Patty Smyth, Never Enough (SS) “Not a note rings true, not an emotion is expressed that isn’t thoroughly canned, not a cliché overlooked. And several good songs are thoroughly mangled…”\n\nI was wrapping up my first year of college as this issue came out; one assumes I leafed through it soon after moving home for the summer, even if there’s nothing here that feels familiar. As ever, I welcome the opportunity to dig in to learn about some artists and tunes.\n\nArticles\n\nEven though compact disks are looming on the horizon, there are pieces on Choosing a Turntable (Alan Lofft), Turntables: How to Evaluate the Specs (Julian D. Hirsch), and How to Judge a Record Without Playing It (David Ranada).\n\nThis month’s reviewers are Phyl Garland, Alanna Nash, Mark Peel, Peter Reilly, Steve Simels, and Joel Vance.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Love Over and Over (AN) “…a startling pastiche of styles, from folk to classical, from spiritual to secular, from Old World to New, from Tin Pan Alley to the Brill Building. They even come close sometimes to getting all of that into one song through their choices in lyrics, vocal line, and instrumentation…”\n\n–John McLaughlin, Music Spoken Here (MP) “McLaughlin’s work with his present group is developing long a path strikingly similar to Weather Report’s in its electronic tonal landscapes, in its powerful rhythmic drive and structural complexity, and in its concept of musical space and how to fill it.”\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\n–Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson, Poncho & Lefty (AN) “This may be the most laid-back album I’ve ever heard…The arrangements are light but not airy, the old veteran pickers know exactly when to play—and more importantly, when not to play, and the instrumentation is lean, clean, and tasteful.”\n\n–Philip Lynott, The Philip Lynott Album (MP) “…a mad collision of styles—romantic ballads, high-stepping barrelhouse rockers, New Wave, dub, Eurodisco, parody, you name it. And it works.”\n\nRecordings of Special Merit\n\n–ABBA, The Singles—The First Ten Years (SS) “The most representative kitsch of our recent past? A revealing slice of life from the belly of the Welfare State?…No matter. I love every note here, and I’m not embarrassed to say so in print.”\n\n–Garland Jeffreys, Guts for Love (MP) “…Jeffreys is in complete control. He seems finally to have learned how to channel his anger into serious music making.”\n\n–Todd Rundgren, The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect (JV) “Fortunately, Rundgren’s wit, which runs from the subtle to the berserk, dominates this new solo album, on which he plays all the instruments and sings all the vocals.”\n\n–Rosalie Sorrels, Miscellaneous Abstract Record No. 1 (AN) “But Sorrels has omitted the work of one of my favorite songwriters and poets, Rosalie herself, and a Rosalie Sorrels album with her own material is almost not a Rosalie Sorrels album at all!”\n\n–Donna Washington, Just for You (PG) “Her uptempo numbers here are sharp and sassy, and on the more intimate items she drives the lyrics home with intensity and finesse.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Dr. Demento, Demento’s Mementos (JV) “Some of them are genuinely funny, nearly all of them are splendidly vulgar, and only a few of them are merely juvenile.”\n\n–Sammy Hagar, Three Lock Box (MP) “Like a lot of other hard rockers, Hagar feels he has to write clever words to entertain us. He needn’t bother…There are also songs about sex and forgotten war veterans, but at this volume, who can think about sex?”\n\n–The Members, Uprhythm, Downbeat (MP) “…rock/reggae stripped of any optimism or idealism by a tough, cynical, pragmatic intelligence.”\n\n–Missing Persons, Spring Session M (MP) “It all goes to show that while great art (which this definitely isn’t) doesn’t spring from the law of supply and demand, good L.A. rock sometimes does.”\n\n–Ric Ocasek, Beatitude (MP) “His smart, economical lyrics and catchy melodies are everywhere in evidence, so Cars fans will surely not be disappointed by this album. They may just wonder where the rest of the band fits in.”\n\n–Yoko Ono, It’s Alright (SS) “All right, all right, I feel sorry for the poor woman—but I feel sorry for Jackie Onassis too, and if she made records I wouldn’t take them seriously either.”\n\n–Thompson Twins, Side Kicks (MP) “…it may be that the Thompson Twins can’t decide whether they want to be serious or silly. In the end, this is music at war with itself.”\n\n–Grover Washington, Jr., The Best Is Yet to Come (PG) “Easy listening, yes, but enormously appealing.”\n\n–Margaret Whiting, Come a Little Closer (PR) “(She)’s been around since the late Forties, but you’d never know it from the astonishing fresh sound of her voice. She still displays the same wonderful intonation and diction that always made her singing—of anything—somewhat special.”\n\n–Neil Young, Trans (SS) “…it’s Young’s latest alienate-your audience effort, which is okay by me. Better to burn out than to fade away, I suppose.”\n\nIn the summer of 1987 I converted to Rolling Stone for album reviews—I was living out of state, Dad probably stopped his Stereo Review subscription around then as a result, etc. Soon after he and I had become roommates, John suggested we go in on a subscription to RS, which I probably kept for most of the rest of the time I was in Illinois. It’s interesting (to me, anyway) to look at a Stereo Review issue from the period when I was all about RS and note that SR was highlighting some of the same records (both Best of the Month selections and two others given featured treatment below have long been in my collection).\n\nArticle\n\nThe New Jazz by Chris Albertson\n\nAlbertson takes us on a whirlwind history of the twists and turns jazz had undergone over the previous thirty years, from free jazz through fusion to new age (failing to write approvingly of much of it). He sees hope, though in a new wave (so to speak) of practitioners, including Branford and Wynton Marsalis, Harry Connick, Jr., Terence Blanchard, and Donald Harrison.\n\nThis month’s reviewers are Chris Albertson, Phyl Garland, Ron Givens, Roy Hemming, Alanna Nash, Parke Puterbaugh, and Steve Simels. Mark Peel, a stalwart for much of the decade, had departed the scene; Puterbaugh had come over recently from, wouldn’t you know, Rolling Stone.\n\nBest of the Month\n\n–Michelle Shocked, Short Sharp Shocked (AN) “…a writer and performer of sizzling personality and power…(t)he instrumental framework shimmers with ingenuity and intrigue, mirroring the lyrics, and Shocked’s somewhat subversive view of life, in superb little unexpected turns and trills…” It’s indeed a fabulous and fascinating record—I’m just sorry there aren’t any clips available on YouTube to share.\n\n–Lucinda Williams, S/T (SS) “She has the kind of voice that suggests the rise and fall of empires as witnessed through the bottom of a shot glass. It’s an instrument worthy of the Bonnie Raitt comparisons it most often draws, but there’s an edge to Williams’s singing, a raw, wounded, and utterly soulful quality, that also suggests a male honky-tonker like Gram Parsons.”\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\n–Anita Baker, Giving You the Best That I Got (PG) “Anita Baker’s much anticipated new album…has everything—superbly lustrous and passionate singing, polished arrangements that include occasional flashes of fine jazz piano, and a high-quality production—everything, that is, except songs that immediately knock you off your feet.”\n\n–Gary Burton, Times Like These (RG) “Gary Burton is a smart man, and he’s made a smart record, but he can burn a little, too, when he wants to.”\n\n–Fairground Attraction, The First of a Million Kisses (RG) “An utterly contemporary throwback, the quartet plays a glorious fusion of swing jazz and heartthrob pop. Their new album sounds as fresh today as it would have thirty years ago.” I adore this record and it’s now become next in the queue for the Forgotten Albums series.\n\n–They Might Be Giants, Lincoln (SS) “…repeated listening…reveals a clever, quirky, often brilliantly arranged and produced piece of postmodern art (yes, art) that just might be the Pet Sounds of the Eighties.”\n\nOther Disks Reviewed\n\n–Steve Earle, Copperhead Road (AN) “But as ambitious as this project is, the album comes off more like a country singer’s Led Zeppelin fantasy than a legitimate rock effort.”\n\n–Sheena Easton, The Lover in Me (RG) “The treatment may have achieved the desired result, dance hits, but (this album) has all the individuality and flavor of processed cheese.”\n\n–Nanci Griffith, One Fair Summer Evening (AN) “While Griffith here presents much of her best-loved material, she diminishes its beauty and impact by rushing through most of the performances in a manner surprisingly devoid of feeling.”\n\n–The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Radio One (SS) “These are performances (they) did for British radio in 1967, fairly early in the band’s career, when they were still young and hungry and relatively unscathed by drug abuse…(w)onderful stuff, and not just for Hendrix completists, either.”\n\n–Etta James, Seven Year Itch (PG) “(This album) offers anyone too young to have been around…when Etta James was one of the ruling queens of rhythm-and-blues, a new opportunity to savor the gritty reality, strutting spirit, and downright infectiousness of her music.”\n\n–James P. Johnson, Carolina Shout (CA) “…Johnson was the first black artist to cut piano rolls of his own compositions. Starting in 1916, before the first jazz phonograph recording was made (he) cut one or two rolls a month…some of which have been assembled by the Biograph label for (this disc)…”\n\n–Cleo Laine, Cleo Sings Sondheim (RH) “And if there’s anything that will destroy a Sondheim song, it’s not sticking to his lyrics and his music as written. But this time Laine sings all sixteen songs as straight as she’s ever sung anything, but with passion, bite, compelling dramatic insights, and (where appropriate) a wonderful sense of fun.”\n\n–Pet Shop Boys, Introspective (PP) “(They) make danceable pop that is not without charm, but between the lines their real gift is for intimating the void in the life of the modern urban ‘party animal.’”\n\n–Pink Floyd, Delicate Sound of Thunder (PP) “Why would anyone who has the superior studio versions need this?”\n\n–Pretty Poison, Catch Me I’m Falling (RG) “Dancers may like what they hear, but more stationary folks needn’t bother.”\n\n–Lee Ritenour, Festival (PG) “He hasn’t done a Brazilian album in ten years, so perhaps that’s why he sounds so fresh here…(t)his is a musical travelogue bound to lift late-winter spirits.”\n\n–Luther Vandross, Any Love (PG) “The songs seem catchier and more imaginatively shaped than earlier efforts…(s)weet, soulful singing doesn’t get any better than this.”"
