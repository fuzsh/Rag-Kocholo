        "text": "Amoeba? Yeah! Jackpot in Portland was also great! My first trip to Grimey's in 2010 was pretty good, but the other two trips there in later years severely disappointed. But that's probably down to the overall trends in retailing music that put me at odds with where the industry is headed. No CDs. Pricey new LPs of wildly variable quality but consistently high prices, rather than 35-45 year old records and singles with music I actually want! I honestly will not bother with any further trips to Grimey's. The time last I was in NashVegas, I got a lot more mileage out of the much more modest but wonderful store, The Groove.\n\nYes! I remember that! Different record racks had totally different price tags on things until I figured out what was going on. So if you didn't find something in one place, you still had a shot in others.\n\nI mentioned Zia Records in the Phoenix area earlier but the three very best deals I found were at Bookman's with a couple of locations in Phoenix and one in Tucson. In all honesty these were all titles/versions I already had and I bought them in this case to flip them not to put the money in my pocket but to buy more music. All three were purchased for $5.00 and sold for $95.00.\n\nDoors – L.A.

Some have a half-table, some have more than one table, it's modeled like an antique mall dedicated to music. There are (at least) 50,000 LPs, maybe that many 45s, thousands of CDs, hundreds of cassettes, even 8-tracks, reels and used stereo gear. There's also quadraphonic gear and an entire table of quadraphonic records, a surround sound system that usually plays in stereo, but on occasion gets used for a \"Surround Sunday\". An LP audiophile section, SACDs, DVD-A, etc, music posters. I know I forgot something.\n\nNothing like some faux-\"authoritative\" list of well-traveled record stores in nothing but the hip locations, to show how out of touch the blogger who posted it is.\n\nSaddest of all, the OP apparently is from Golden CO...and no mention of the stores in the Boulder area...?\n\nTo be fair, I have been to Grimeys, and Easy Street (may have been to Jackpot, really don't recall). Love that Princeton comes up first in the \"you forgot about___\" posts.\n\nRecordland is wonderful. I would also highly recommend Record Collector's Paradise in Edmonton.\n\nOthers that come to mind:\n\nEverybody's Records and 2nd Avenue Records in Portland, OR. (Millennium Music for CDs)\n\nJosey Records in Dallas\n\nElectric Fetus in Minneapolis\n\nDowntown Music in NYC\n\nAntone's Records in Austin, TX\n\nCD Trader in Tarzana, CA\n\n(Going out of USA here because . . . why not?)\n\nSound Station in Copenhagen\n\nBlue Desert in Malmo, Sweden\n\nPet Sounds in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nBoth 12 Tonar and Reykjavik Records in Reykjavik, Iceland\n\nRokk & Ralls in Oslo, Norway\n\nBig Dipper in Oslo Norway\n\nNeseblod in Oslo, Norway\n\nConcerto Records in Amsterdam\n\nFlashback Music in London\n\nGibert Joseph in Paris\n\nDisk Union in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan\n\nBig Papa Records in São Paulo, Brasil\n\nRadiation Music in Barcelona\n\nLast visit to Nashville, I found some really good stuff (and CDs) in The Great Escape. Worth checking out.\n\nYes, it confused me, too, the first time. But then I figured it out and did find some pretty cool things. I loved the Audiophile section.\n\nI used to find used lps that were more interesting in and around the 2010-2015 time. After that, I'd sometimes find good new stuff but rarely used things that interested me. Had to go up in the the valley (Freak Beat? CD Trader?) to find better stuff.\n\nAlbums On the Hill in Boulder is very much worth a visit. Loved that place.\n\nAlso, and quite a surprise, there's a little 2nd hand shop at the southern entry to Ouray, Colorado where I found a number of interesting things. It's called Red Mountain Trading Post.\n\nThe Denver shops weren't bad either.\n\nReally enjoy a good record store. Live in my locals. Love hearing about others local. Really cool the value placed now on a good record store. RSD discussions are fun because of this. I’d love to hit up all on the list. I know two well. Will hit up one tomorrow.\n\nYeah, I've spent many a Saturday up and down the Wax Trax block when I lived there, followed by my regular Mile Hi Comics visit.\n\nMoving to Harrisburg PA was such a culture shock - the only decent resource was a monthly record show 30 miles out of town from this state capital...or, go all the way to Ephrata.\n\nYeah, the ONLY time I ever found Amoeba suitable for actual crate digging was when they first opened their original Berkeley store in the late '80s. At that time, they did have an appreciable amount of cheap ($1) vinyl below the browser racks, and there were some gems to be found in those bins.\n\nBy that time they opened the San Francisco store, their vinyl section was pretty anemic and while there was a bit of bargain vinyl near the floor, it was stale and pretty worthless.\n\nThe Amoeba in LA has never been particularly good for that, either.\n\nOh yeah! I found a ton of stuff in Crossroads! Their antique mall business plan maximizes churn and flow like nothing else! With multiple dealers the likelihood that I fall prey to the curation bias of the store owner/manager is completely blown away. I only went to Portland once, but if I lived there, I'd be making a weekly thing of it."
