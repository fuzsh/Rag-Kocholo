        "text": "The Recording Division of the County Clerk's office\n\nThe purpose of the Recording Division is to make and preserve public records dealing with real property transactions. Ownership of property can be traced back to the early 1850s in the records maintained by the Recording Division. The Recording Division also issues marriage licenses and the County Clerk performs weddings. The Recording Division has marriage records dating back to the 1840s.\n\nThe County Clerk and Recording Division does not support the courts. In 1983, The State of Oregon took over the District, Circuit, and Probate Courts from the county clerks. The court clerk can be reached at 503-655-8447 or Clackamas County Circuit Court.\n\nThe Clackamas County Clerk will record all documents authorized by Oregon State or Federal law, rule or regulation affecting title to, or an interest in, real property. Documents must be properly executed and acknowledged, correctly identify the property, and meet all other form, titling and fee requirements to be recorded. All our records are preserved either on microfilm or computer image. We maintain a public viewing area for research and copying of records.\n\nRecording Hours:\n\nMonday - Friday8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.\n\n(These hours are different from our office hours. These hours are when we are available to record property records.)\n\nIn accordance with state laws, the Recording Division must record and store public recorded instruments in a fair and open manner. Recordation of a document makes it a public record, putting the public on notice. Since the public and courts may use recorded instruments to establish validity of certain claims, all pages must be readable. Oregon statutes, the County Clerk and Clackamas County Counsel support the need for legible text within recorded documents.\n\nIf the legibility of an instrument or notary seal is questionable and a deadline may be compromised should the Recording Division reject the document; you may want to prepare a new, legible original instrument prior to submission. Client demands may not always make this possible, but the client should be made aware if legibility problems exist, and informed that there may be delays if documents are rejected.\n\nImportant Notice: HB2029 - Minimum font size changes to 10-point\n\nEffective Monday, Jan. 1, 2024 HB2029 amends Oregon Revised Statute 205.232, changed minimum font size to 10-point type for recorded documents. Customers are urged to make sure the font size is at least 10-point.\n\nManagerâ€™s Index Notice\n\nAll documents recorded on April 1, 2023 and forward are currently indexed within two business days. These priority documents listed below are all currently indexed:\n\nAll Liens\n\nAll Clerk-Liens\n\nDeath Certificates\n\nDeeds\n\nTax Deferred Property Types\n\nUCC Mortgage Fixture Types\n\nDeed-Development Agreements\n\nDeed-Municipal Documents\n\nSingle Title Reconveyances\n\nMortgage Stratifications"
