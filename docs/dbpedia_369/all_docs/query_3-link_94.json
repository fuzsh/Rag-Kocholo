Act 2019-340. Under the new law, persons wishing to become married are no longer required to file an application for a marriage license with the county probate court, and the courts will no longer issue marriage licenses. Furthermore, all Alabama probate courts will now be required to record marriage certificates. The Alabama Marriage Certificate form represents a contractual agreement between the parties to the marriage, completed by both parties and delivered to the probate court for recording. Once properly completed and recorded, the marriage is valid. A wedding ceremony may be performed for the parties, but solemnization is no longer required for a recognized marriage in Alabama.\n\nView the signed bill here: Ala.Act 2019-340\n\nView the AG Opinion Request here: AG Request Doc\n\nView the AG Opinion here: AG Opinion\n\nAlabama Marriage Certificate FAQ & Other Resources\n\nThe fee to record the Marriage Certificate form is $73.00 (additional certified copies are available for $3.00 each) in Mobile County. The fee must be paid by cash, money order, or credit card. No checks will be accepted to record Marriage Certificate forms. Please note that Mobile County Probate Court staff are not permitted to notarize documents for the public.\n\nFor additional information and answers to commonly asked questions of the Court, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) page.\n\nAlabama Marriage Certificate Forms\n\nFor ease of reference, links to the forms & instructions are listed below:\n\nFor Adults - Alabama Marriage Certificate Form for Adults\n\nMarriage Certificate Instructions for Adults\n\nFor Minors - Alabama Marriage Certificate Form for Minors [16-17 years of age]\n\nMarriage Certificate Instructions for Minors\n\nPlease note: The form should be printed on 8.5 x 11inch white or light paper, front side only, as actual size, not “fit to page” or another modified size.\n\nAccess to Land & Marriage Records Online\n\nTo access Land & Marriage Records, please follow the link to Landmark WEB below.\n\nYou must create a new account or log-in with your existing credentials to access records online."
