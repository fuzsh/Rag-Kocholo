Well I tried And does it disappoint you to hear “I’m gonna be alright” I was not equipped for your sharpened wit Because you cut me like a knife There were nights I waited for your call I had to cut you out of my life On, I’m moving on I feel myself drawn to the ocean On, I’m moving on A lifetime of this constant motion Did you forget to tell me, or just chose to lie? And as the days turned into months Time just goes by And my heart grew cold at the lies you told Cause you know it wasn’t right And I won’t forget, when I needed you most But you were busy with another guy On, I’m moving on I feel myself drawn to the ocean On, I‘m moving on A lifetime of this constant motion On, I’m moving on A million thoughts in my head endlessly You should have chose your words less hurtfully On, I’m moving on I feel myself drawn to the ocean On, I’m moving on A lifetime of this constant motion On, I’m moving on A million thought in my head endlessly You should have chose your words less hurtfully I wish you chose your words less hurtfully\n\n8.\n\nLockdown 00:37\n\nAhhh Lockdown Ahhh Lockdown Low brow boy, he came to party But no one fucks with Marty Little shit couldn’t take a trick So he come back with a stick Ahhh Lockdown Ahhh Lockdown When Marty activates She sealed that fuckers fate Here comes the boys in blue You don’t fuck with an A02 Ahhh Lockdown Ahhh Lockdown\n\n9.\n\nLand Speed Record 01:29\n\nGo! I hold the land speed record in punk rock history I saw the Minnesota Tripletes sometime ‘round ‘93 Land speed record Land speed record I hold the land speed record; I see the rise and fall I saw the Dead Kennedys play at Festival Hall Land speed record Land speed record We hear your snipy comments, how you don’t like our band You don’t think we’ve paid our dues, given a golden hand We’ve been here since it started, for over forty years So go fuck your envy and go wipe your tears Land Speed Record\n\n10.\n\nStraight To Hell 01:49\n\nI think I just met Jackie Chan Or it maybe it’s the amphetamines Late night parties, rock and roll So, I better up the Mersyndol I‘ve got a self-destructive nature I don’t handle too well So, I’ve bought a first class ticket Straight…..straight to hell I’m going straight, straight to hell Woke up on the floor again I need to see my special friend I saw his bag and reached inside And at that time, I lost my mind I‘ve got a self-destructive nature I don’t handle too well So, I’ve bought a first class ticket Straight…..straight to hell I’m going straight, straight to hell\n\n11.\n\nFortitude Valley 01:49\n\nDrinking beer again, I’m talking shit with Ken It’s another Saturday night, my future’s looking bright Walking through The Valley, it’s Saturday night I’m drinking with my friends, I’m feeling alright One more bar, one more drink One more drink, let’s not think Where the hell will we end up tonight? One more bar, one more drink One more drink, let’s not think Where the hell will we end up tonight? Drinking vodka when, we see that band again Punk rock is the way, it gets us through the day I’m walking through The Valley, it’s Saturday night I’m drinking with my friends, I’m feeling alright One more bar, one more drink One more drink, let’s not think Where the hell will we end up tonight? One more bar, one more drink One more drink, let’s not think Where the hell will we end up tonight? Whisky shots again, waiting for my friend Stranded on Winn St, who we gonna meet? Walking through The Valley it’s Saturday night I’m drinking with my friends, I’m feeling alright One more bar, one more drink One more drink, lets not think Where the hell will we end up tonight? One more Bar, one more drink One more drink, lets not think Where the hell will we end up tonight\n\n12.\n\nThe cycle of life Cuts us down to size As I watch you fight this fucking pain inside I have no more words Is that what you deserve? But the fuck you give is my last lesson learned It’s okay to go You told me all I need to know To be the best I can And all through my life I’ve always had you by my side in everything I’ve done You made me be someone We all say goodbye Throughout our lives And I understand it’s now your time to go You’re memory, it will stay with me And those that leave us they are closer than you know It’s okay to go You told me all I need to know To be the best I can And all through my life I’ve always had you by my side in everything I’ve done You made me be someone You made me be someone It’s okay to go You told me all I need to know To be the best I can And all through my life I’ve always had you by my side in everything I’ve done You made me be someone You made me be someone\n\n13.\n\nTony was a friend of mine, and he looked after me He used to live in the western ‘burbs in the late 1980’s Tony wanted to be known, he wanted to be seen We grew up strong, he grew up hard When times were tough and lean Tony was a friend of mine, he did favours for free He ruled the streets with an iron fist, he showed no mercy One night he got taken out, he lost his liberties He never did what he was told, you gotta know your enemies Me and tony had not much, but we were young you see In western Brisbane times were hard, you got nothing for free Tony was a daunting man, 6 foot 3 I still remember telling him, you’ve got to know your enemies Tony was a friend of mine, and he looked after me He ruled the streets with an iron fist, he showed no mercy One night he got taken out, he lost his liberties He never did what he was told, you gotta know your enemies\n\n14.\n\nIn My Eye 01:28\n\nStand up all you fucking liars We’ll light you up like a funeral pyre You’re an afterthought, you’re a bitter taste An ugly scar I wear on my face I for one don’t value you You’re a shitty town I once drove through Something borrowed, something new I’m so better off without you It’s in my eye, it’s in my eye An everlasting memory It helps me never forget, it gives me clarity It’s in my eye, it’s in my eye A painful reminder You’ve gone away, and I’m left behind ya Sad songs they trigger me I don’t care if you’re not lonely Disappear, without a trace Hope I never see your face Finally, it’s come to me I kind of had an epiphany Why waste time on someone who Never gave the time for you It’s in my eye, it’s in my eye An everlasting memory It helps me never forget, it gave me clarity It’s in my eye, it’s in my eye A painful reminder When you went away, and I’m here behind ya\n\n15.\n\nI'm Moving On 01:12\n\nWhat am I gonna do? When I can’t see you Where am I gonna go? How am I gonna know? What am I gonna do? When I’m without you I’ll carry On I’m moving on Here I am again Hanging with my friends Watching bands play Music is the way Out every night I’m drinking till its light I’ll carry On I’m moving on Life’s pretty good And I think you should Make the most of it Don’t take any shit Life’s what you make it Use both hands and take it I’ll carry On I’m moving on I’ll carry On I’m moving on\n\n16.\n\nI don’t know what I want I don’t know what I need This constant state of restlessness It’s like a fucking disease I just want to be alone, excuse me Away from those I’ve know, that use me I won’t apologise, cause you know that I was right So here I say “farewell, good riddance and goodnight” Farewell Good riddance And goodnight\n\n17.\n\nYippy-Yi-Ya Motherfucker 01:08"
