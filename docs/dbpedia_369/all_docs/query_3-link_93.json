        "text": "Documentary Transfer Tax is due on all taxable conveyances in excess of $100 at a rate of $.55 per $500 or fractional portion of real property value, excluding any liens or encumbrances already of record. Property located within the city of Riverside is taxable at a rate of $1.10 per $500 or fractional portion of real property value, excluding any liens or encumbrances already of record (R&T Code 11911). Transfer tax is collected at the time of recording. A Documentary Transfer Tax Declaration must be completed for all conveyances. If no Documentary Transfer Tax is due, so indicate by entering \"0\" on the tax line, and provide a valid reason for exemption.\n\nA Documentary Transfer Tax (DTT) Affidavit will be required to be completed and submitted with each document when Documentary Transfer Tax is being paid or when an exemption is being claimed from paying the tax. If a governmental agency is a party to the document, the form will not be required. Documentary Transfer Tax Affidavits are also available at all Assessor-County Clerk-Recorder branch offices, or will be mailed to you upon request by calling (951) 486-7000.\n\nNote: If you do not have to pay Documentary Transfer Tax, you may have to pay a new state fee of up to $225 starting Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nEach instrument, paper, or notice that is rerecorded shall be executed and acknowledged or verified as a new document, in addition to any previous execution and acknowledgment or verification, unless any of the following apply:\n\nFor purposes of item 3, “minor correction” includes any of the following:\n\nThe instrument, paper, or notice is otherwise exempted by Section 27287 or any other law.\n\nThe instrument, paper, or notice is presented solely to correct a recording sequence. The intent of the parties with regard to the priority of recorded documents shall be controlling regardless of the sequence of recording by a county recorder or the sequence of recording specified in instructions given by a submitter to a county recorder. This subparagraph is declaratory of existing law, and any rerecording of documents to change the sequential numbers assigned to a document by the recorder shall not require the document to be executed and acknowledged or verified as a new document.\n\nThe instrument, paper, or notice is presented solely to make a minor correction with an Affidavit for Minor Correction. The corrective affidavit shall satisfy all of the following:\n\nBe attached to the original recorded instrument, paper, or notice.\n\nSet out the information corrected.\n\nBe certified by the party submitting the affidavit under penalty of perjury.\n\nBe acknowledged pursuant to Section 27287.\n\nAn incorrect or missing address of the party to which the instrument, paper, or notice is to be returned following recording pursuant to Section 27361.6.\n\nA clarification of illegible text pursuant to Section 27361.7.\n\nAn incorrect or missing printed or typed name of an individual or entity near the signature pursuant to Section 27280.5.\n\nAn incorrect or missing documentary transfer tax amount due pursuant to Section 11932 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\n\nEach rerecorded instrument, paper, or notice shall include a cover sheet that complies with Section 27361.6 and shall state the reason for rerecording on the cover sheet."
