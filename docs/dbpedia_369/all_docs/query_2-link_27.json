        "text": "Today's Top Stories\n\nTuesday, March 31, 2009\n\nLiam Gallagher Hooked For Fishy Business\n\nSeoul: The air intelligence unit at Seoul Incheon airport customs seized 8lbs of fresh Nova Scotia Salmon from a passenger who arrived from Tokyo Japan by an All Nippon Airlines flight last night.\n\nOfficials engaged in passenger profiling at the airport found the moves of Liam Gallagher (36), a resident of the United Kingdom and singer in popular Brit Rock band Oasis, suspicious and questioned him while he was coming out through the \"nothing to declare\" gate .\n\n“When we questioned him, he did not admit to carrying anything. So we examined his clothing and found the fresh fish (Salmon) valued at US$147.00 (195,800 South-Korean Won) in his inside coat pockets . He had no valid document for the import of seafood or meat from the South Korean agricultural department,” a customs commissioner said.\n\nOn questioning, Mr. Gallagher told the officials a fan had given him the salmon as a gift at Tokyo airport , and that he was not aware of the import laws.\n\nThe import of fishes , dead or alive, requires a license from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade and clearance from the animal quarantine department.\n\nCustoms officials let Mr Gallagher proceed to his waiting limousine after the band's manager handed them tickets to Oasis' concert at Seoul's Olympic Gym #1 scheduled for Wednesday. (Sum Thin Wong)\n\nvia L4e / Korea News International\n\nEDIT: Well I don't know about you guys but I had a lot of fun with this made up story and my photo-shopped picture of Liam coming out of a night club. I hope our \"Salmon King\" laughed along with us. April Fools Day :)\n\nwebmaster\n\nShare Post [+] 8 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nKasabian Makes Free Download Available\n\nKasabian who later this year will be supporting Oasis on the their UK Stadium tour, will be releasing their new track 'Vlad The Impaler' as a free download from Kasabian.co.uk for a limited period of 4 days only.\n\nThe download will be available from 7.30pm (UK) tonight (March 31st) until Midnight April 3rd only from Kasabian.co.uk.\n\nThe clip is from the documentary 'Gold & Silver & Sunshine' - the making of Dig Out Your Soul, which can be found in the deluxe version of Dig Out Your Soul.\n\nThe single is taken from their forthcoming album 'The West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum', out June 8th and the first physical single release will be 'Fire', out June 1st.\n\nvia L4e / youtube\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nMonday, March 30, 2009\n\nOasis Live in Tokyo\n\nOasis, Whatever, Tokyo 03-29-9\n\nOasis, The Masterplan, Tokyo 03-28-09\n\nLast Night's Set List from the Makuhri Messe\n\nRock 'N' Roll Star\n\nLyla\n\nThe Shock Of The Lightning\n\nCigarettes & Alcohol\n\nThe Meaning Of Soul\n\nTo Be Where There's Life\n\nWaiting For The Rapture\n\nThe Masterplan\n\nSongbird\n\nSlide Away\n\nMorning Glory\n\nAin't Got Nothin'\n\nWhatever\n\nThe Importance Of Being Idle\n\nI'm Outta Time\n\nWonderwall\n\nSupersonic\n\nDon't Look Back In Anger\n\nFalling Down\n\nChampagne Supernova\n\nI Am The Walrus\n\nBootlegs from the current Dig Out Your Soul Tour by Oasis are available on the L4e Forum's Sound and Vision board here\n\nvia L4e / youtube\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nSunday, March 29, 2009\n\nBook 'The North Will Rise Again' Charts 30 Years of Music in Manchester\n\nOasis, The Stone Roses, Joy Division and The Smiths all feature in a new book charting the last thirty years of Manchester music.\n\n'The North Will Rise Again: Manchester Music City 1978-2008', penned by journalist and Goldblade frontman John Robb, is published tomorrow (March 30).\n\nThe book details Manchester's punk, Madchester and present day scenes and tells the stories of a number of the city's most famous musicians.\n\nMorrissey, Ian Brown, Noel and Liam Gallagher and The Fall frontman Mark E Smith are among the contributors to the book, alongside Johnny Marr, Happy Mondays man Shaun Ryder and the late Factory Records boss Tony Wilson.\n\n\"I've spoken to just about everybody. In fact, the biggest problem has been keeping it all down to a manageable size. The book is around 155,000 words long as it is and it could have been double that. Ian Brown gave me 30,000 words to work with!,\" Robb told the Manchester Evening News.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe Buzzcocks. Joy Division. The Fall. The Smiths. The Stone Roses. The Happy Mondays. Oasis. Manchester has proved to be an endlessly rich seam of pop-music talent over the last 30 years. Highly opinionated and usually controversial, stars such as Mark E. Smith, Morrissey, Ian Brown and the Gallagher brothers have always had plenty to say for themselves. Here, in John Robb's new compilation, Manchester's gobbiest musicians tell the story of the city's thriving music scene in their own words. When the Buzzcocks put on the Sex Pistols at Lester Free Hall in 1976, they kickstarted a musical revolution and a fervent punk scene exploded. In 1979 the legendary Tony Wilson founded Factory Records, the home of Joy Division/New Order and later the Happy Mondays. The Hacienda, the Factory nightclub, became notorious in the late 1980s as a centre of the influential Madchester scene, led by the Mondays and the Stone Roses, with a unique style and sound of its own. Then, from the ashes of Madchester rose uber-lads Oasis, the kings of Britpop and the biggest UK band of the 1990s. Full of great characters, fierce conflicts, untold stories and seething controversies, Manchester In Its Own Words is indispensable reading for any music fan. John Robb is a leading music journalist and the author of the bestselling biography of the Stone Roses. His other books include Punk: An Oral History, The Charlatans ...We Are Rock and The Nineties: What the F**k Was That All About?\n\nThe North Will Rise Again: Manchester Music City 1978-2008 is written by John Robb and will be published by Aurum Press on March 31. John Robb will be signing copies of the book at the Deansgate branch of Waterstone’s at 7pm on Tuesday, April 21. Tickets £3, are redeemable against one purchase of the promoted book on the night.

Have actually managed to get some much needed kip. 17 hours over 2 nights! It wasn't un-aided, nor un-interupted. 17 hours it was, nonetheless. I feel like my old self. Or a new man. Whatever.\n\nDone some crazy TV show last night called...I can't remember! Big deal though, apparently. Went on for 3 hours! Watching the camera work by the cameramen (and women, y'know, whatever) was amazing. They had it all choreographed like a dance routine. Really brilliant.\n\nDidn't see \"The Sign\" yesterday. Mr al-Fayed's shoes were hanging around though. They truly are incredible.\n\nNot much else to tell really. No..that's it, I'm afraid.

He’s refusing to shake anyone’s hand until you turn up.’\n\nWhen I walked in, Liam yelled: ‘Here’s my man, Stuey. Stuey, come here.’\n\nHe hugged me and we sat down at the back of the room where it got even more bizarre.\n\nHe had heard that my marriage was on the rocks and turned into my own private agony aunt.\n\nSince his own marriage had also broken up earlier that year, I assumed he now thought he was an expert on the subject of divorce.\n\nNot sure about that, though, given that the advice he gave me was: ‘The first year is the hardest. After that it’s a piece of cake, a walk in the park. Let’s have a beer.’\n\nThat was Liam’s version of marriage counselling, but I bet there’s not many people who can boast they’ve had that.”\n\nRead the rest of the article by clicking here.\n\nvia L4e / walesonline.co.uk\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nOasis head to the Fuji Rock Festival\n\nOasis have announced that they will be playing this year’s Fuji Rock Festival at the Naeba Ski Resort on Friday 24th July 2009.\n\nTickets are available from\n\nFujiRockFestival\n\nFujiRockFestival (English)\n\nOther acts include Weezer and Basement Jaxx.\n\nVia L4e: source: oasisinet.com\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nSaturday, March 28, 2009\n\nThe Oasis Video Vault : Noel Gallagher on A&E\n\nFor those of you who missed Noel Gallagher's special solo performance and sit down interview with Arts and Entertainment Channel's Breakfast and the Arts show back in 07 here's your chance to catch up!\n\nNoel Gallagher on A&E Breakfast& The Arts, Part 1\n\nNoel Gallagher on A&E Breakfast & The Arts, Part 2\n\nvia L4e /\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nRush For Argentina Oasis Tickets Starts Today\n\nTickets for the Oasis concert at the River Plate Stadium date go on General Sale from today (28th March).\n\nAll tickets are available through Ticketek or +(54-11) 5-237-7200\n\nOasis recently announced they will be performing at the River Plate Stadium, Argentina's national football stadium and venue for the 1978 World Cup final on Sunday the 3rd of May.\n\nAlso known as 'El Monumental de Nuñez', the iconic stadium is the biggest stadium in Argentina for concerts.Oasis return to Argentina for the first time since playing a sold out show to 40,000 fans at the Buenos Aires Polo Fields in March of 2006.\n\nThe date is part of their South American tour.\n\nvia L4e / oasisinet\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nLiam Gallagher Denies Being Snapped By Google\n\nLONDON, England (CNN) -- Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher on Saturday denied that he is the man shown pointing at the Google Street View camera as it drove past his local pub in London last summer.\n\nLiam Gallagher says the figure captured on Google Earth outside a pub in London is not him.\n\n\"Just saw google earth apparently that's meant to be me, who ... wears legwarmers with reeboks??

He points at the camera, obviously having seen the Google car and its Street View camera drive by.\n\nThe service blurs people's faces so it is hard to confirm whether it is Gallagher.\n\nThough the man isn't wearing legwarmers, Gallagher is apparently talking about the man's ankle-high shoes and thick black socks.\n\nvia L4e / CNN\n\nShare Post [+] 3 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nFriday, March 27, 2009\n\nOasis Interviewed on Japanese TV Show Music Station\n\nOasis get interviewed by show hosts on Japan's popular TV show Music Station 03-27-09\n\nOn a side note it's truly become a rare sight to see the Gallagher brothers sitting side by side during an interview.\n\nvia L4e / youtube\n\nShare Post [+] 2 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nLiam Gallagher, How Important Is a Good Haircut ?\n\nAsk Liam Gallagher your question here\n\nvia L4e / prettygreen.com\n\nShare Post [+] 1 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nNoel Gallagher's Guitar Getting Tired and Old\n\nFrom Noel Gallagher's official tour diary on oasisinet.\n\nThis is probably gonna be a load of rambling nonsense. It's 5am. I've been awake since 3.30am, I only went to bed at midnight!! Feel like that dude in that song by Faithless. I can't get no sleep. It's killing me, man.\n\nNot a great deal going on either. The gigs in Osaka were quite run-of-the-mill. Unenjoyably-run-of-the-mill.\n\n\"The Sign\" (I shall now refer to it from now on as \"The Sign\") was there. Down the front. Bright as a button. NOEL OR DIE.\n\nWent to Tower Records yesterday. They still have amazing record shops out here. It was quite early so it was virtually empty. I'm in there 2 mins and on comes 'Stop The Clocks - The Best of Oasis' really fuckin' loud over the in-store PA.\n\n\"Ah..just what I wanted to hear\".\n\nI'm trying to ignore it and one of the little-uns comes up and asks for \"my sign, please!\", while pointing to the ceiling, very pleased with himself. \"Thanks for that\".\n\nBought 5 albums. All shit. I won't name names. I was just taking a punt, so to speak.\n\nI'm fuckin' starving. I'm gonna order breakfast... Done, be here in 30 mins.\n\nBought a guitar yesterday. A Gibson SG. It's a new one. A re-issue of the George model. Not the ACTUAL model, but near enough. Looks good. Plays good.\n\nTalking of guitars, I'm getting a bit concerned about my main one. The big red one. It's suddenly started to sound a bit old and tired. And it will NOT stay in tune. It is nearly 50 years old though. Might have to stop using it for a while. Bit worried, to be honest. I'm quite literally fucked without it.\n\nWe're traveling back to Tokyo today (but we've just come from there, surely?). 4 more nights there and that'll be it. Mind you, always a pleasure on that bullet train.\n\nIncidentally, I was watching summat on BBC World the other day about them bullet trains and apparently since they went into service in the 60s, the average delay time..in almost 50 years..is 6 seconds. SIX SECONDS over 50 years!!?? And they've only had one derailment and that was during an earthquake!! Staggering, eh? No? Well, it is at 5am!!\n\nBreakfast will be here in 11 seconds.

Well, mostly ...\n\nBy his own admission, Brit-pop superstar Liam Gallagher is a reformed character.\n\nWhen Oasis visit Hong Kong for a gig next month, gone will be the wild man who was banned from flying with Cathay Pacific for an airborne punch-up on a flight to Perth after their first show in the city in 1997 and in his place will be a calmer, more mature Gallagher who prefers a night indoors to one out on the town.\n\n\"I've done my partying,\" the former hellraiser says. \"I like to be with the missus and our kid. We just go round people's houses or they come round to ours.\"It's a far cry from the young upstart from Manchester who rose to fame in the mid-1990s with a band that blazed bright at the vanguard of a newfound British rock euphoria, the banner-wavers of the Brit-pop sound.\n\nAlthough there was little new about Oasis' musical style, theirs was the first British pop in a long time that swaggered. Songs such as Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Supersonic, although lyrically meaningless, had an ambition about them that ideally suited the times.\n\nAdding to the myth was Liam and his songwriting brother Noel's penchant for fighting and partying. Rarely did a week pass when they weren't splashed over the tabloids for coming to blows in public, making outrageous statements or rumours of rampant drug ta!\n\nMost prominent was their public rivalry with fellow Brit-! poppers Blur, which came to a head in 1995 when both bands released comeback tracks from new albums on the same day in what was billed as the \"Brit-pop wars\". Oasis lost that battle - Blur's Country House beat the Mancunians' Roll With It to the top spot - but with more than 10 million albums sold, they eventually won the war.\n\nThese days, it's Noel who tends to grab the headlines with his carousing. \"Noel is out on the piss all the time,\" Liam says by telephone a day after a gig in Milan, part-way through the band's world tour promoting new album Dig Out Your Soul.\n\n\"Him and his missus like hanging out with all the comics and things like that.\"The suggestion that the younger Gallagher may have gone soft raises a few bristles and sees him regain his cockiness for a moment: \"Listen, mate, I'm not teetotal. I have calmed down a little bit without a doubt. But not too much, I hope.\" And regarding that airline incident, he is resolute: \"I don't regret anything,\" he says. \"We did a show and went on the piss, you know what I mean? No one got hurt.\n\n\"The Gallaghers' relationship remains one of the oddest in rock. They fight in public, more than once resulting in Noel walking out on the band. Their credibility in the US was wrecked twice when the band cancelled tours after rows, one of which ended with Noel stomping out and a second that saw Liam refusing to leave Britain and instead go flat-hunting in London.\n\nToday, Liam admits the two rarely fraternise outside of the band.\"We don't go for walks in the park. We don't go for brunches or lunches or whatever,\" he deadpans in his Mancunian drawl.\n\n\"That's the way it is - he's a different person from me, I'm a different person from him. We both live in London and, yeah, I could just go round his house, but I don't want to. I don't feel the need to go round and see my brother's head. And I'm sure it's the same for him.\"\n\nGuitarist Gem Archer has also noticed a difference in the once-warring Gallaghers.\"There's a definite maturity that's becoming more apparent,\" says Gem, who! joined the band 10 years ago. \"We've all got kids and we're all in it for the right reasons. It's about the music, not the money or the fame.\n\n\"It's not just the Gallaghers who've changed - the band is a whole different proposition from the snarly youngsters who burst on to the scene in the 90s. When they play the AsiaWorld-Arena on April 7, they'll be promoting Dig Out Your Soul, which has won critical acclaim for moving the band away from the so-called Oasis sound of Beatles-influenced melodies with an indie feel.\n\nArcher attributes this to the band's new drummer, Chris Sharrock, who took the stool from Ringo Starr's son, Zak Starkey, and to the recording process for Soul.\"This album was a really easy process - from top to bottom in seven weeks,\" he says. \"We didn't demo it, and it takes time to be able to do that. There's a certain amount of telepathy you need to do that.\"They have even changed their tune regarding old rivals Blur, who have reformed eight years after guitarist Graham Coxon walked out, leaving singer Damon Albarn to front the band.\n\n\"I'm happy that they're back together, 'cos then they can hopefully get rid of the Kaiser Chiefs,\" he says. \"Now that I've grown up a little bit and got wiser, I'm happy for them, to be quite honest.\" He doesn't plan to be at their comeback gigs, though: \"I don't think I'll be welcome. Me and Damon are all right, but I just don't want any of their fans getting heavy with me.\n\n\"The present tour, as planned, presented Oasis with a few more milestones. One not likely to be achieved, though, will be their first gigs on the mainland. The four-piece had been due to play in Shanghai and Beijing before performing in Hong Kong, but those shows were cancelled. The band say it's because Noel performed at a Tibetan freedom concert several years ago, a charge Beijing denies.\n\nOne thing they will achieve, however, is their first all-stadium trek around Britain, playing football grounds such as Wembley. It's a big deal even for! a band that filled Knebworth - a huge venue - for two nights !in 1996, playing to an estimated 500,000 people.\n\n\"Initially when we put out the dates, I thought 'I hope someone knows what they're doing here',\" says Archer. \"And when they all sold by 3pm, it was pretty breathtaking. Playing stadiums is the ultimate buzz. It was a dream when I was in London, busking.\"Liam is less philosophical: \"I play small gigs, I play big gigs, I play really big gigs. It's all the same to me.\"But one gig he won't be playing is Glastonbury.\n\nAlthough the band was welcomed at the British festival with open arms early in their career, their last appearance, in 2005, was a shambolic affair marred by a lacklustre performance and jeers from the audience.\"No, I'm never playing that place again,\" Liam says. \"It's s***. I don't like it, it's full of idiots and paparazzi taking pictures of you when you're out of your head, know what I mean? That's no good. I don't like the sound either, the f***ing sound system is s***.\"\n\nOasis Live in Hong Kong, Apr 7, 8pm, AsiaWorld-Arena,!\n\nHK International Airport, Lantau, HK$380-HK$780, HK Ticketing.

It's snowing. SNOWING! Thought we'd left the winter behind in Europe. Apparently not. Seems like we're being haunted by the cold on this tour.\n\nGig was good. Uneventful, but good. I say gig, they're more like concert performances over here. You can hear a pin drop between songs.\n\nPlayed that song \"Whatever\" for the first time in.. what.. 12 years? Bizarrely enough it's our most famous song in Japan. The kids are always mithering for it. Dunno why I decided to play it last night. Guess it means I'll have to play it every night now.\n\nWent out to watch the Liverpool-Aston Villa match after the concert last night. At an IRISH BAR!! They're everywhere. I bet there's one in Kabul. Liverpool won 5-0, as I remember. Every time they scored, the DJ in the bar played \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by Gerry and the bloody Pacemakers. 5 times he played it!! 5 TIMES!! Good times though.\n\nWe're flying to Osaka today. Now, in fact.\n\nBefore I get off, tell me what you think of this.. There's been a fan following me around since I got here carrying a sign that says, in fluorescent lettering, NOEL OR DIE!

All fair-trade clobber, but they don't seem to sell stack-heeled shoes. No profit line on the horizon for those?\n\nMatt Sorum\n\nThe Guns N' Roses / Velvet Revolver drummer's music might not be suave, but his Sorum Noce suits are pretty sharp. And he saves money by hiring bandmates Duff McKagan and Slash as models.\n\nGen Simmons\n\nKiss's tail-tongued mastermind has his own clobber company, called Moneybag. \"This Italian Calfskin wallet should always, always, always, be full of cash. And Gene agrees,\" says his website. Hmm, we might take a hat.\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nTimberlake's wares succeeded in \"capturing the soul of authentic Southern heritage and married it with the edge of contemporary Hollywood\". So, he wants you to dress like The Eagles?\n\nScott Weiland\n\nNow he's left Velvet Revolver, Weiland can spend more time on his English Laundry clothing line with designer Christopher Wicks. MusicRadar presumes the needle work is exemplary.\n\nZacky Vengeance\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's rhythm guitarist has his own brand of t-shirts, hoodies and accessories called Vengeance University. Most bear the tag: \"Est. 6661\". Which means he's quoting the 'number of the beast', or this clothing doesn't actually exist for another 4653 years?\n\nBenji and Joel Madden\n\nThe Good Charlotte brothers once sang negatively about Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous. But since 2005 their DCMA clothing line has been a hit with the rich and famous, including Benji's sometime-girlfriend Paris Hilton. Rich, famous, whatever…\n\nKanye West\n\nThe world's most self-assured man sells his own shoes, glasses and accessories lines. But if you buy Kanye's sneakers by Louis Vuitton, just make sure you live like him. \"I hire someone specially to take care of my shoes,\" says West. \"They clean them, box them and take a picture of them so it's easier to find them.\" Kanye clearly has a tough life.\n\nJay-Z\n\nShawn Carter is a true entrepreneur, and sold his Rocawear business in 2007 for a tidy $204million.\n\nP Diddy\n\nSean Combs' Sean John clothing and fragrance line is hugely popular now and worth multi-millions. But MusicRadar does question the name of his recent fragrance.\n\nQ: \"Mmm, what are you wearing honey?\"\n\nA: \"It's Unforgiveable\".\n\nResult?: Lady makes quick exit.\n\nGallagher is none too impressed by the sort of clothes worn by younger rock stars.\n\nSays Liam: \"The reason I'm doing it is I like clothes. We're going to do clothes I like, if people like it cool. If they don't, they don't.\"\n\nvia L4e / musicradar.com\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nOasis in Japan , Then and Now\n\n15 Years later Britrock legends Oasis are still going strong.

But some six months down the road, when we mentioned that to him, he thought we were mad.\n\nIn fact, don’t even suggest that there’s anything else he’d rather do than be in Oasis (even if you’re right and you’ve got the tape recording to prove it).\n\n“Not interested in anything that’s not Oasis,” he said over the phone from London. “Oasis is my thing. I was born to be in Oasis. I was born to make Oasis the best. That’s what my goal is.”\n\nPart of that goal is touring for their current hit album, Dig Out Your Soul. They have a scheduled stop in Singapore on April 5 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nThe album — one of the best albums of last year, declared Britain’s NME magazine — has sold over 1.6 million copies worldwide since its release last October, and is the latest feather in the cap for a band that’s sold more than 50 million records and has had eight Number One singles in Britain.\n\n“Them songs are amazing (sic),” said Gallagher, adding that he couldn’t wait to show off the new album to the audience here.\n\n“I love the music. I love playing it. I love going around the world, seeing the fans and stuff. I can’t wait to get back there.”\n\nYou guys played Singapore about three years ago. Can you remember what that show was like?\n\nYou know what? I can never remember that far back. I imagine that it was a good show. At least I thought it was good. Er, was it any good?\n\nI thought so. How’s the tour going so far?\n\nIt’s been going really good, we’re playing really well, I’m singing really well. I think we’re rockin’. If we’re all well and I haven’t got a sore throat or anything, then it’s all good as far as I’m concerned.\n\nHave there been any Spinal Tap moments?\n\nI mean, being in a band with your brother is Spinal Tap, full stop. It’s always Spinal Tap.\n\nWhat can we expect this time?\n\nWell, you’re going to see the best rock n’ roll band in the world, as far as I’m concerned. I mean, we’re not daft, we don’t jump around and get our socks off. We’re not like Guns N’ Roses. We know what we’re doing. (But) you want people to join in, don’t you, and feel good. That’s the kind of band we are.\n\nWe’re not a band of miserable arty-farty outfit. We want people to get in and have a lot of fun. It’s all good, mate.\n\nDo you get bored singing the early stuff?\n\nI like everything to do with Oasis. Otherwise I wouldn’t do it, know what I mean? No, I don’t get bored at all. I mean there’re days when you get bored — full stop. It’s got nothing to do with music. It’s to do with life in general.\n\nSo no more sex, drugs and rock n’ roll?\n\nI dunno. What do you reckon? I’m definitely into the sex, and I’m definitely into the rock n’ roll, but the drugs, well ... I can do without.\n\nDo you miss your kids while on the road?\n\nWell, they do their thing and I do my thing, but I’ve found that after three weeks, I start getting a bit mental and I want to go home. When you get older, you start appreciating your family more. But this is what I do, this is my job. I’ve got to pay the bills.\n\nYou consider being in Oasis a job?\n\nOf course, it is a job, but it’s the best job in the world.\n\nWhat’s your philosophy?\n\nJust don’t think about it.\n\nDescribe Oasis in less than 10 words.\n\nThe best band in the world.\n\nAs a performer...\n\n(Interrupting) I don’t see myself as a performer. I’m not. Robbie Williams, Mick Jagger — they’re performers. I’m just a rock n’ roll singer. I sing songs and that’s the end of it.\n\nWhat’ll you do when the music’s over?\n\nIt’s never going to be over. But who knows, mate? Hopefully, we’ll all be well. And keep producing great music. I’m never going to split this band up. I love it. I’m having such a good time.\n\nDo you want to continue playing forever, like The Rolling Stones?\n\nI don’t want to be like anyone. I want to be like Oasis. If we’re fit and keep writing good music, then that’s what I’m going to do till I die. Forget the Stones, who gives a s**t about the Stones?\n\nVia L4E source: channelnewsasia.com\n\nShare Post [+] 1 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nThursday, March 19, 2009\n\nWhich Beatle Dressed the Coolest, Liam ?\n\nLiam Gallagher answers another fan's question via video clip.

In addition to the guerilla effort, the launch included a digital push that distributed a documentary about the New York event through MySpace.\n\n\"It's become very clear that new thinking in new media has replaced traditional 'advertising' executions,\" said Mark Waites, creative director, founding partner of Mother in London and chairman of this year's jury. \"Clients and their agencies are becoming adept at embracing unusual approaches, concepts and [media] to transport their creative vision into work that makes viewers take notice and respond.\"\n\nDroga5, New York, was the only multiple U.S. gold winner, taking home two gold statues for the Sara Silverman-starring viral video for the Jewish Council for Education and Research called \"The Great Schlep.\" The other U.S. gold winners were Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, San Francisco, for the Comcast spot \"Rabbit,\" Crispin Porter + Boguksy, Miami, for the Burger King \"Whopper sacrifice\" digital campaign and Wieden + Kennedy, Portland, Ore., for the Coca-Cola commercial \"It's Mine.\"\n\nDroga5 also took home two additional prizes, the Richard T.

We’re going to do clothes I like. If people like it, cool. If they don’t, they don’t.”\n\nThe limited menswear range will feature everything a Jack the lad could want.\n\nIt will include classic designs across footwear, denim, knitwear, jackets, trench coats, parkas, T-shirts, hats, scarves and accessories.\n\nBlunders\n\nAnd the frontman is taking a hands-on approach to his new range.\n\nHe added: “If you’re going to do it, you’ve got to get involved. I’m looking forward to it. I think it’s going to be good.”\n\nThe collection is due to hit select shops in June.\n\nLiam and Noel inspired an army of teenage lads over the last 14 years to have the same barnet, sideburns and clobber.\n\nBut not all of Liam’s threads have caught on.\n\nThe John MotsonO-style sheepskin coat he wore to the Brits in ’96 was a sweaty reminder of the band’s over-indulgence at the time.\n\nAnd the leopardskin slip-on shoes he’s showing off at the moment went down a treat with my gran.\n\nI doubt you’ll see many lads at The City Of Manchester Stadium wearing them this season though.\n\nVia L4e / thesun.co.uk\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nAsk Liam Gallagher\n\nAs Live4ever reported yesterday fans now have a chance of getting their questions chosen and answered via Video clip by non other than Liam Gallagher!\n\nAsk Liam, Join the Pretty Green community to ask Liam Gallager anything you want!\n\nPretty Green is an up-front, straight talking, classic clothing range owned, founded and designed by Liam Gallagher.

But the Mancunian swaggered across the ring, almost thrusting the belt in the opponent's face, and shouted \"Whatcha think about that!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind,\" quipped Hatton. \"But Paulie is a New York Italian, and half of the Sopranos were at ringside.\"\n\nFerocity\n\nThe Gallaghers took ringside seats for the fight, and were astounded at the ferocity of the contest, even though Hatton's 11-round stoppage win was not one of his hardest fights.\n\n\"Liam pulled me over after the fight and asked me how many more I was planning to have,\" said Hatton. \"I told him three or four, and he replied `You must be off your head'. He was pleading with me to pack it in.\"\n\nHatton also revealed his biggest hate figure - United star Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nAsked who he would choose if he could knock out anyone in the world, Hatton only hesitated for a moment before answering: \"I don't dislike too many people, but it would probably be Ronaldo.\n\n\"He is the best footballer in the world, but he is on his backside more times than his feet.\n\n\"United were on the telly the other night when I was Hoovering, and when the Hoover bumped into the telly Ronaldo fell over.\"\n\nHatton was also asked who he would like to play him if a film was made of his life story. He replied: \"They would have to have two people playing me. Johnny Vegas when I'm out of training, Brad Pitt when I'm in it.\"\n\nHatton, meanwhile, believes his little brother Matthew is ready to grab some of the limelight.\n\nThe 27-year-old headlines the first local show put on by Ricky's own promotions company on March 28, taking on former European champion Ted Bami in an IBO title eliminator in Altrincham.\n\nAnd his elder sibling is predicting the time is ripe for \"Magic\" Matthew to blossom into a top-class fighter.\n\nHaving split with long-time trainer Billy Graham following defeat by Failsworth's Craig Watson, a superb victory over Ben Tackie in November made a few people sit up and take notice.\n\nAnd with a new training regime under Lee Beard, and occasionally Ricky's new mentor Floyd Mayweather Senior, Ricky says his kid brother is about to shine.\n\n\"His career has stuttered and stalled, but now you are going to see the best of him,\" said Ricky.\n\n\"He is coming into his own. In his fight with Watson he didn't do himself justice.\n\n\"In his last few fights under Billy his heart wasn't really in it. Training was becoming very much hard work for Billy due to his injuries, and it was taking all his effort to get his work done with me.\n\n\"Consequently Matthew was suffering a little bit and it showed in his performances.\n\n\"He is in a new camp now, working on different things. It's the same as it is with me - when you are given new training methods and new and exciting things to work on you get a bit of hunger and buzz back.\"\n\nvia L4e / manchestereveningnews.co.uk\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nMonday, March 16, 2009\n\nWin Tickets To Soldout Oasis Show at Vfest\n\nHere's your chance to win two tickets to this year's V Festival.\n\nOasis and The Killers are set to headline the August event, with Fatboy Slim, The Specials, Elbow and Lily Allen also set to get crowds rocking.\n\nAll of the tickets have been snapped up for the Chelmsford leg of the festival, but Road To V is giving one lucky winner the chance to get their mitts on a pair of weekend camping passes.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

The fans were crazy,\" Noel said of his band's show three years ago in the nation's capital. In an e-mail interview with The Korea Herald, the critically acclaimed band and the crotchety half of the Gallagher brothers, tip-toed around standard inquiries with classic curmudgeon-like approach.\n\nHaving enjoyed a career which has spanned 17 years, critics and fans alike have showered their latest and 7th studio release \"Dig Your Soul,\" with universal praise.\n\nSo what does get them going?\n\n\"Everyone and everything,\" Noel said.\n\n\"Smoking and drinking and watching TV during my spare time gives me inspiration.\"\n\nNever ones to kowtow to the media, Liam and Noel have often been publicly visible through their diva-like tantrums and feuds. Whether their apathetic views have been theatrics or not, Oasis is one of the few remaining bands that still represent the archetypal rock 'n' roll image.\n\n\"Asian media seems to be more polite and philosophical. U.K. media is very cynical,\" he said.\n\n\"They're not interested in music. They're only interested in gossip.\"\n\nOasis has been described as everything from arrogant Beatles-wannabes to innovators of Britpop and rock. And when it was revealed the band would deviate from their trademark sound to a harder, grittier sound, there were concerns whether this would alienate the band's core group of fans who had been there since the beginning.\n\nIronically, the reception from the U.K. media has been especially positive since the album's release late last year. When the Manchester-based band's first single, \"The Shock of the Lightning,\" was given its initial round of rotation on-air, music journalists hailed the band as returning to form. England's most respected and representative music magazine \"Q,\" even dedicated 50 pages of their publication to the band and the album.\n\nFor information on tickets, contact Yellow 9 Entertainment (02) 3444-9969 or Interpark (02) 1544-1555.\n\nvia L4e / koreaherald.co.kr / photo: Paul Bachmann\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nNoel Gallagher Charity Album Now Available For Download\n\nFor all of you who missed out on the special CD included in the Sunday Times you now have the ability to download the album from the official Oasis store!\n\n‘The Dreams We Have As Children (Live for Teenage Cancer Trust)’ is available to download from today Monday 16th March:\n\n01.

Absurdly talented, outrageously outspoken and often shockingly badly behaved, they shoot from the verbal and physical hip, don't care what people think of them and make fantastic records.\n\nAlthough I've met Noel a few times - including one memorable occasion at Tony Blair's 'Cool Britannia' party at Number 10 in 1997, when I caught him about to pen a Hitler moustache on Margaret Thatcher's portrait - I've never properly met Liam. Until tonight, that is. And let's just say, he didn't disappoint.\n\nAn old friend of mine, Stephen Purdew - who owns various top health clubs, including Champneys - had his wedding at Claridge's hotel, and as I sipped champagne at the reception, I was led over to meet Liam.\n\n'Hey, man - 'ow are you?' he said. 'Like that chat show of yours; it's sound.'\n\n'Thanks - I'd love to have you on as a guest.'\n\n'No, no, I don't do f****** interviews. I leave it to our kid to sound off. He likes doing that.'\n\nWe then spent 20 minutes having the most hilarious conversation I've had with anyone for a long time. Liam speaks like a machine gun, firing out brilliantly provocative one-liners.\n\n'How's your brother?' He grimaced.\n\n'Have you got brothers?' he asked.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Well, he's like that.'\n\n'Often quite annoying, then?'\n\n'Right.'\n\n'I didn't expect to see you at a party like this.'\n\n'Nor did I. I don't go out a lot, to be honest, but I like Stephen, and I've just finished a tour two days ago, and when that happens I always feel a big comedown when I get home. I miss the buzz of being on stage and just mope around the house if I'm at home. So it's nice to come out.'\n\n'You seem a lot calmer these days.'\n\n'I am, I am. I prefer going on the school run, or to my local supermarket, to getting wrecked every night. I've grown up.'\n\n'Hang on - you go to your local supermarket?' 'Yeah, man - Waitrose, all the time. It's sound. I like the fish counter - it's a real laugh round there.'\n\nAt which point I spotted his shoes: a pair of leopard-skin loafers.\n\n'Interesting footwear, Liam...'\n\n'I f****** love these, man. LOVE them. I've got two pairs, and wear them all the time.'\n\n'We used to rely on you when I was a newspaper editor. On a quiet day, we'd hope you'd turn up at some awards show and start hitting and abusing everyone.'\n\n'Yeah, well, that's because I never won anything, and I'd be on loads of drugs. Now they give me all the f****** awards, and I don't take drugs, so I don't get so wound up!'\n\n'So you'll be on best behaviour tonight, then?' Liam smiled, and leant towards me. 'Listen, man, I could still drink anyone in this room under the f****** table. Don't worry about that. Any one of 'em.'\n\nvia L4e/ dailymail.co.uk\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nGet Your Free Gallagher CD in Today's Sunday Times\n\nThe Sunday Times will today be giving away an 11 track CD with the newspaper which, alongside the downloads already given away this week, gives readers the full tracklisting for ‘The Dreams We Have As Children (Live for Teenage Cancer Trust)’.\n\nA donation has been made to Teenage Cancer Trust in respect of the use of these recordings.

He was still working for the gas board back then.\n\n\"When our singer left in 1988, we asked him to come for an audition but we were after something really specific, so to break it gently to him we asked him to come and be our roadie, but he became more or less the sixth member of the band. But then he joined up with his brother and formed Oasis.\"\n\nThe tour will launch on June 6 ahead of the band's huge Heaton Park gigs, but is available for private bookings before then.\n\nThe tour includes perhaps the most famous fan landmark - Sifters Record Shop in Didsbury - where the lads used to buy singles, and credited in Oasis's 1994 song Shakermaker with: \"Mister Sifter sold me songs, When I was just 16.\"\n\nvia L4e / telegraph.co.uk\n\nShare Post [+] 0 comments\n\nFor Breaking News visit our flagship site Live4ever Media\n\nMake sure to join the world's largest Oasis Community\n\nPretty Green - mens clothing from Liam Gallagher\n\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nDon't Expect a Jay-Z Gallagher Collaboration Any Time Soon\n\nNoel Gallagher has told Radio 1 he turned down a collaboration with Jay-Z.\n\nSpeaking to Jo Whiley on Friday morning, the Oasis guitarist explained that he told the hip-hop star, \"I'm afraid I'm busy\".\n\nHowever, Gallagher, well known for his humour, didn't clarify whether he was telling the truth about Jay-Z's offer of a collaboration.\n\nThe guitarist was an outspoken critic of the rapper headlining Glastonbury last year.\n\nJay-Z then mimed to Oasis' Wonderwall and played a montage of clips of Gallagher's comments at the start of his festival set.\n\nDuring the interview, Gallagher also revealed that he and his girlfriend Sarah MacDonald are devoted fans of Coronation Street.\n\n\"Me and Sarah watch Coronation Street religiously,\" he said. \"It's such an institution, that programme - why they've never asked me to be in it is really one of the scandals of our age.\n\n\"I could just have a walk-on part, a tiny little bit in Coronation Street would be brilliant.\"\n\nGallagher also said he'd be keen to live in Los Angeles, but wouldn't want his children to pick up the accent.\n\n\"LA, I've kind of grown to love it, and I never thought I'd say that,\" he explained. \"I'd probably love to get a house in between Madonna and Robbie Williams, it'd be brilliant.\n\n\"I'm not sure I could ever actually live out there, I don't think it'd be fair on the kids.
