Some were contemporary...some delved into the past. Some shamelessly self-promoted - and who is going to be the Grinch who is going to deny them that privilege?\n\nOthers were altruistic and the rest simply chose favourites that they simply think others will enjoy.\n\nAn editor's note: some comments were edited for brevity - and when it comes to TV show suggestions, remember that they're available either as a DVD/Blu-ray set, or, if they're on a streaming service, as a subscription.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHawskley Workman - indie rock artist\n\nMusic:\n\nAny Art Tatum vinyl.\n\nBook:\n\nShogun - James Clavell - \"The last time I read it, I was preparing to go to Japan for the first time. Japan is the most fascinating place I've ever been - and that was 13 years ago. I thought I'd be back six times since, but I haven't, so I'm re-reading it to feel that Japan energy again, you know?\"\n\nKevin Breit - guitarist extraordinaire, Sisters Euclid\n\nMusic:\n\nCome Go With Me - The Staple Singers\n\nAnything by Sister Rosetta Tharpe\n\nBooks:\n\nJust Kids - Patti Smith\n\nCaste - The Origins Of Our Discontents - Isabel Wilkerson\n\nMadison Olds x Nearly York - Canadian pop artists\n\nMusic:\n\n100 Bad Days - AJR\n\nBook:\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nTV Show:\n\nSelling Sunsets\n\nHaley K Turner - Indie pop folkie\n\nMusic:\n\nThe next Jill Barber record.\n\nJust When the Light - David Beckingham\n\nBooks:\n\nIf I Knew Then - Jann Arden, \"A wonderfully encouraging and therapeutic guide to showing up in the world as yourself.\"\n\nThe Ashes - Jesse Thistle\n\nFilm:\n\nI’m Dreaming Of A Jewish Christmas - Larry Weinstein\n\nadvertisement\n\nGift:\n\nSoy Candle - Canvas Candle Company.\n\nLéonie Gray - Montreal singer and songwriter\n\nMusic:\n\nSkin - Joy Crookes\n\nBook:\n\nSmall Great Things - Jodi Picoult\n\nFilm:\n\nCadillac Records\n\nTV Show:\n\nEntre Deux Draps\n\nPaige Williams, Soft Sound Press\n\nBook:\n\nFangirls: Scenes from Modern Music Culture - Hannah Ewens\n\nMichael Raine, Canadian Musician Magazine & Podcast\n\nGift:\n\nA T-shirt or hoodie from SupportCanadianMusic.com - \"50% of the sale goes to a Canadian music charity, which you choose from their list of partners.

Even as a lifelong concertgoer who's seen dozens of performances there, the book deepened my awareness of the venue's position and place in Toronto, Canada, and the world, and re-awakened my enduring love for its intimacy, acoustics, and sightlines.\"\n\nStuart Derdeyn, Entertainment Reporter, Postmedia\n\nadvertisement\n\nApp:\n\nThe Animoog Z app - \"It's endless fun.\"\n\nSiobamm- Synthy alt-rock artist from Toronto\n\nMusic:\n\nOdyssey Vol. 1 - Crown Lands\n\nBook:\n\nSellout - Dan Ozzi. \"A deep dive into the major label debuts of 11 punk bands, including Green Day, Blink-182, My Chemical Romance, and The Distillers. I love the way it explores the relationship between art and commerce post Nirvana.\"\n\nFilm:\n\nDune - director, Denis Villeneuve - “I was a fan of the Lynch one, which is a very strange version. The new Dune is more cinematic. The visuals and Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack work together beautifully. And I’m excited it’s split into two parts, because the book is like 900 pages.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nTV Show:\n\nSuccession - \" The writing is incredible (especially the insults), and it’s a poignant look at how the wealthiest people in America are very messed up.\"\n\nMyles Goodwyn- founder and lead singer, songwriter, April Wine\n\nMusic:\n\nRaising The Roof - Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. - \"Great songs, inspired vocals and a stellar production by T-Bone Burnett.\"\n\nBook:\n\nRockbound - Frank Parker Day (1928). \"I love the book.

As musicians and songwriters in a band, this series was so relatable in terms of the creative process, the banter, the issues, the fun and the magic that comes from being in a band.\"\n\nPaula Danylevich, Hype Music, publicist\n\nMerch:\n\nElton John keychain\n\nRobbie Williams Official 2022 Calendar.\n\nBook:\n\nLet That Sh*t Go - A Journal for Leaving Your Bulls*t Behind and Creating A Happy Life For Yourself - Monica Sweeney\n\nLaurent Bourque - Toronto dance pop act\n\nMusic:\n\nLa Gabacha - BAJA\n\nBook:\n\nDune - Frank Herbert\n\nFilm Gift:\n\nadvertisement\n\nA Revue Cinema membership (Toronto.)\n\nTV Show:\n\nGilmore Girls.\n\nBex - Indigenous singer-songwriter\n\nMusic:\n\nRed (Taylor's version) - Taylor Swift\n\nStartrails - Bex\n\nBook:\n\nStillness Speaks - Eckhart Tolle\n\nThe Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle\n\nFilms:\n\nGhostbusters (Afterlife)\n\nFree Guy\n\nTV shows:\n\nCarnival Row\n\nThe Boys\n\nSammi Morelli - Vancouver-based pop artist\n\nMusic Gift:\n\nChristmas!

This compilation is full of good, old-time country feeling and rippin' pedal steel. I ordered it on vinyl, and they sent MP3s to tide me over until Santa can deliver it.\"\n\nEamon McGrath, Edmonton-born, Toronto-based singer and songwriter\n\nMusic:\n\nCure for Pain - Morphine - “The second title on Light in The Attic's new Modern Classics imprint is an album as moody, atmospheric, brooding and evocative as the band's history is tragic and emotional. Bandleader Mark Sandman heartbreakingly died onstage in Italy with Morphine in 1999, and he is survived by the immortal music of Boston's most exciting three-piece band, featuring his unorthodox bass playing (often with as few as two strings), his melancholic baritone vocals, Billy Conway's lyrical and spacious drumming, and of course the trademark saxophone howl of Dana Colley. Cure for Pain bridges a gap between punk rock, blues, indie, free jazz, shoegaze and slowcore.\"\n\nBook:\n\nStranger Than Kindness - Nick Cave. \"It's an addicting and extensive look into the finest details of one of music's most powerful and enduring songwriters. Decades of relics, news clippings, show posters, lyric sheets, setlists, and artifacts fill page after page in this immaculately put together and curated archive of Nick Cave's career.\"\n\nSally Shaar, singer and songwriter, Toronto-based MonoWhales.\n\nMusic:\n\nTell Me How You Really Feel - Courtney Barnett\n\nAssume Form - James Blake\n\nButterfly 3000 - King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard\n\nBook:\n\nWendy - Walter Scott (Graphic Novel)\n\nFilm:\n\nKing Richard\n\nTV show:\n\nFantastic Fungi\n\nSean McCann, solo artist, ex-Great Big Sea\n\nMusic:\n\nShantyman - Sean McCann. \"Features inspired performances from my good friends Hawksley Workman, Gordie (Big Sugar) Johnson, Jeremy Fisher, @ J.P. Cormier. It is a bracing breath of salty sea air and perhaps the best Great Big Sea record you've never heard.\"\n\nBook:\n\nOne Good Reason - Sean McCann and Andrea Aragon. \"Written with my \"higher power\" (and beautiful wife) Andrea Aragon, this is our own story of Recovery + Music + Love. \"\n\nFilm:\n\nGet Back - \"Alan (Doyle) and I were certainly no \"Paul and John\" but having lived through the bitter end of a successful band, I just couldn't look away from the inevitable train wreck that was The Beatles' Get Back. While I miss the songs, I can still learn from their lyrics and remain reassured in the belief that Money Can't Buy Me Love.\"\n\nTV Show:\n\nThe Walking Dead - \"The pandemic left me with time to start watching The Walking Dead. Hard to beat a fictional zombie apocalypse while living through your own ... Merry Christmas everyone!\"\n\nKaren Bliss, Billboard, founder, Samaritan Magazine\n\nBook:\n\nRenegades: Born in The U.S.A. - Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen\n\nMerch:\n\nFisher-Price Little People Collector figures: The Rolling Stones\n\nMiranda Mulholland, Roaring Girl Records\n\nMusic:\n\nNovo Amor - Novo Amor: \"I just discovered this talented Welsh artist.

These books have it all in spades. \"\n\nFilm:\n\nMy Darling Vivian - \"A revealing and moving documentary about Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian Liberto. It's fascinating how we as humans feel the need to erase some people's narratives in order to mythologize the stories of others.\"\n\nTV show:\n\nThe Hookup Plan - \"It's a romantic comedy TV series set in Paris which makes for some good eye candy and delightfully awkward scenarios.\"\n\nEric Alper - yeah, that one.... publicist\n\nMusic:\n\nChaise Longue - Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers\n\nWet Leg - Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers\n\nBook:\n\nMusic is History - Questlove - \"Focuses on the years 1971 to the present, not only the country's most complex and rewarding half-century when it comes to the ways that pop culture and culturally diverse history intersect and interact, but also the years that overlap with Questlove's own life.\"\n\nFilm:\n\nGet Back - \"Watching the greatest band in history create their songs, right in front of us, was a lesson in creativity, and they should have just been allowed to take a break from it all.\"\n\nTV show:\n\nSuccession\n\nRaine Hamilton - Prairie Songstress\n\nMusic:\n\nRaffi's Christmas Album - Raffi - \"This one is a timeless classic.\"\n\nBook:\n\nThe Biggest, Most Beautiful Christmas Tree - “Nina and Nutley are two squirrel siblings living in a vast and verdant wonderland.

Johnson (Fruit Bats) and Josh Kauffman (The National), their eponymous first record is lush and beautiful.\"\n\nBook:\n\nHail Mary - Andy Weir (Audiobook). - \"The narration is brilliant and funny.\"\n\nFilm:\n\nMy Neighbour Totoro - Miyazaki (animated)\n\nTV Show:\n\nTed Lasso. - \"it’s perfect for the holidays.
