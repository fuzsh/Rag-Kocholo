        "text": "So is the consensus that the Disque Americ and Cinram Help! and Rubber Soul were flat transfers and the brightness is on the masters, or was there some less-than-judicious EQ added?\n\nAlso, if EMI maintained absolute control of the glass masters used worldwide in the CD replication plants--not allowing the CD plants to creat glass masters themselves--just how did this happen?\n\nWe know that Mike Jarratt prepared digital masters for Help and Rubber Soul that George Martin rejected, in order to \"improve\" the SQ by remixing. Maybe glass masters for these two albums were prepared by EMI and filed away, and unwittingly sent to Disque Americ and Cinram in the 90's for CD replication? And why Disque Americ AND Cinram? I find it highly unlikely that both DA and Cinram would have pulled an incorrect tape (say, a cassette dupe master) and both independently created glass masters from that duplication tape. Therefore, it seems to me the mistake was at EMI. After all this time discussing this, have any answers arisen?\n\nHere's an attempt at summarizing the key points from the original thread, hopefully leaving out anything speculative. I read the entire thread through when I discovered it a few days ago (I'm a new member) but I couldn't bear to do it all over again -- I only skimmed through it quickly to prep this post.\n\nNote that I personally can't speak for the Cinram discs, but I do have the DA discs.\n\n(1) Some or all of the Beatles' Help! and Rubber Soul compact discs manufactured by \"Disque Americ\" in Canada (as marked on inner ring of disc) between 1989-1994 seem to contain the original UK stereo mixes of these albums, not the 1987 George Martin remixes appearing on their non-DA counterparts.\n\n(2) Indicators of the UK mix are the \"dry\" Lennon vocal on \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\", the hard-right lead vocal on \"Drive My Car\", and the \"pop\" at around 1:07 (give or take a second) on \"Run For Your Life\". Other specific indicators have been noted but these three seem among the easiest to identify.\n\n(3) The DA Help's total running time is 34:31 (34:26 by some reports), not 34:15. The DA Rubber Soul's total running time is 36:00, not 35:48.\n\n(4) The DA discs have different catalog numbers than the non-DA discs:\n\nC2 46439 (Help!)\n\nC2 46440 (Rubber Soul)\n\n-----------------------------\n\nNote that there are other Disque Americ Beatles discs with C2 catalog numbers but none are yet known to be any different sonically from their non-DA counterparts. The following are known to exist:\n\nC2 46435 (Please Please Me)\n\nC2 46437 (A Hard Day's Night)\n\nC2 46438 (Beatles For Sale)\n\nC2 46441 (Revolver)\n\nC2 46443 (The Beatles)\n\nC2 46445 (Yellow Submarine)\n\nC2 46446 (Abbey Road)\n\nC2 46447 (Let It Be)\n\nC2 48062 (Magical Mystery Tour)\n\nLet me know if there are inaccuracies in any of the above, or if I omitted any points that have been definitely verified (as opposed to speculation). Images and individual track timings appear in the original thread.\n\nThis has already been covered in thread #1 by the end:\n\n1) Cinram and DA (Canadian arm of MPO France) were THE pressers for EMI Canada, until EMI opened its own plant in Canada. All, not just Beatles discs, were pressed by these two companies, unless imported. The other major labels also used both in Canada too.\n\n2) EMI did not send out glass masters until the early 90s, when they stopped using contract plants (Sonopress Germany, PDO WG, Sony DADC USA, Toshiba-EMI Japan) and made their own discs in their own plants. They sent tapes. EMI sent glass masters when they had their own plants or different contracts later. Usually identified with the same matrix and sourced from EMI UK Swindon.\n\n3) The catalog numbers are not special to DA or Cinram. EMI's standard cat nos for CDs in USA and Europe were CDP 7 4xxxx-2 for popular/jazz music. 2=CD format. Canada simply used C2-4xxxx as a modified catalog number.\n\nThe unique part about these CDs is that they have different source tapes than any other Beatles CDs. Not sure why.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"glass masters\", as unless I'm mistaken, the glass masters would have all of the matrix information as well. So obviously the glass masters were cut (independently) at Cinram and DA.\n\nOr do you mean the digital master tape used to create the glass masters?\n\nLuke, that's the question of the hour. Were glass masters sent or were digital tapes sent?\n\nI see what you mean about the matrix info. However, that is contained in the aluminum or metal layer of the CD, and not in the pitted polycarbonate data substrate. You have to remember that CD's are a sandwich and, IIRC, only the data substrate is prepared from the glass master. For example, a CD-R may have matrix info--and that info is contained on a different layer than the dye substrate.\n\nWell, IIRC Steve has stated in the past that EMI controlled the glass masters, not the individual pressing plants. Ordinarily, the pressing plants will create the glass master from the tapes sent to them, but that doesn't appear to have been EMI's policy for the Beatles. I could be remembering this incorrectly, but I seem to remember Steve stating this during discussions about variations in the White Album CD's.\n\nThe questions we are presented with are:\n\n1) Were DA and Cinram sent non-remix glass masters from EMI? OR\n\n2) Were DA and Cinram sent non-remix digital tapes from EMI?\n\nObviously, DA and Cinram did not independently make the same mistake, at the same time (ie, they did not pull the wrong tape)--plus, both of them doing it twice, for Rubber Soul and Help? It's just too much of a coincidence. That leads me to believe that EMI sent *something*--be it glass masters or digital tapes--to both Cinram and DA which contained the non-remix versions of Help and Rubber Soul.\n\nand also:\n\n3) Were DA and Cinram sent the same digital tape and/or glass masters from EMI?\n\nHas anybody compared the Cinram and DA pressings by ear, and also digitally, to determine whether they used the same source tape? THAT is an interesting question.\n\nSeems likely to me that EMI sent out (identical) digital tapes to its various worldwide subsidiaries to cut their own glass masters and manufactor their own discs. And in this particular instance they simply sent the wrong (non-remixed) tape to one of the two Canadian plants, who made their glass master and forwarded the tape to the other plant. I can't imagine they would have sent out two incorrect tapes, and that both incorrect tapes just happened to end up at the two Canadian plants. I also seriously doubt that both Canadian plants would have pulled a couple of their own safety tapes and used those. It makes more sense that they were accidentally sent the digital tapes that were already made up of the non-remixed versions prior to Martin's decision to remix. Heck, they might have been shipped to Canada before Martin made that decision, and they just weren't recalled in time (or someone forgot they'd already been sent).\n\nMy guess is, the two Canadian pressings are most likely digitally identical, although presumably not from the same glass masters.\n\nWell, I just got a copy of the Rubber Soul disc, thanks to a fellow forum member. I already had the Help! disc, but I just wasn't prepared for the vast difference between the original and remix of this album. (I \"grew up\" with the remix version, I'll admit - I bought it when it first came out in 1987, at the ripe old age of 15, and that's the only version of the album I've ever owned, save for the Capitol box version.) The original mix is just so dry and wide!\n\nHaving said that, the sonics aren't perfect - sounds kinda boosted in the upper-midrange. Then again, as I said, I don't really have much to compare it to, so...\n\nBut I'm definitely happy to have it. Even if EMI announces tomorrow that they're putting out high-rez discs with flat transfers of all the original mono and stereo mixes, I'm still glad I've got this one little piece of Beatle history.\n\nBear in mind that the first batch of Beatle CDs we got in Canada were pressed in West Germany or the U.S. Therefore, CDs for the Canadian market weren't pressed in Canada until after the other countries had got their masters. A one-off (or two-off, if you will) request some time after the fact could have been the opportunity for a mistake to be made.\n\nActually it would only be Help & Rubber Soul that are different because they were digitally remixed in stereo. The first four cd's are mono so it would be pretty much impossibly for them to be any different, unless they boosted the eq on them or something.\n\nI also heard that Magical Mystery Tour is digitally remixed....now wouldnt that be interesting if the Disque Americ pressings were the original stereo mixes, similar to the US & German stereo MMT\n\nThe US stereo MMT had some unique mixes on songs like \"Strawberry Fields\" where the panning was different from the current cd version. Not to mention those cruddy \"fake stereo mixes side two"
