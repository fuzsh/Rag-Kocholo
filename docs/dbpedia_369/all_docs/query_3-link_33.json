The Clerk records instruments presented for recording, upon payment of the service charges, as prescribed by law. All instruments recorded in the Official Records are open to the public, under the supervision of the Clerk, for the purpose of inspection and copying.\n\nThe Recording Department is located at the Volusia County Courthouse, Room A121, DeLand. Documents can be dropped off at the Steven C. Henderson Judicial Center's Civil Department, Room 100, Daytona with cash or check sent to DeLand via next-day courier service.\n\nOfficial records may be accessed using the Clerk of Court's Online Records Search or the public access terminals located in the Recording Division. Records are searchable by name using an alphabetical index, or by Clerk file number, or by book and page numbers. The Public Research area offers access to Volusia County's Official Records dating back to 1887 in various forms of media including books, microfilm and digital images. The types of records which may be researched include, but are not limited to, deeds, marriage records, military discharges and plats.\n\nEmployees for the Clerk of the Court are not authorized by Florida law to perform title searches, nor are they permitted to perform lien searches. However, an employee will assist you in using the equipment and the sources of information available. Depending on the complexity of your search, you may wish to seek the assistance of a title company or attorney.\n\nSubdivision Plat\n\nPlatted subdivisions are recorded as a part of the Official Records. The entire plat library and monthly updates are available for download from the Clerk's FTP site via an annual subscription agreement.\n\neRecording\n\nDo you want to save time, the cost of check-writing, envelopes, postage, shipping/courier, delays, and photocopying? eRecording is easier, faster and less expensive. All you need is a computer, scanner and internet connection.\n\nWhat is e-Recording - e-Recording is the process of submitting, receiving, and processing documents via the Internet, through a third-party vendor. Documents that have traditionally been delivered or mailed to the Clerk of the Circuit Court by runner, express mail, or courier services can now be processed with e-Recording, simplifying and accelerating all aspects of the recording process. The most commonly e-Recorded documents are Deeds, Mortgages, Assignment of Mortgages, Satisfaction of Mortgages and Notice of Commencements. With e-Recording, the submitter scans the document and uses a vendor application to upload the document and associated data. No special equipment is required, just a computer with high speed internet access and a scanner. Original documents never leave the submitter's possession since they are scanned for submission.\n\nE-Recording documents can be tracked through the entire process. Documents are recorded within one to three business days, if submitted during regular business hours. Once the document is accepted, you can immediately retrieve an image that includes the recorder's stamp.\n\nBenefits of eRecording\n\nYou may submit documents at your convenience, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nExpedites the speed in which your documents are recorded\n\nIncreases efficiencies, streamlines work flow\n\nStop writing checks and eliminate payment errors\n\nImproves document security – you retain original documents\n\nSaves time and money for postage and/or courier fees or runner costs\n\nWho should use eRecording? - Customers who should utilize eRecording are attorneys, closing agents, title companies, financial institutions, county/state agencies and contractors.\n\nFunds- Funds are transferred using Automated Clearing House (ACH) for transfer taxes, recording fees, copies, and a nominal fee paid to the vendor.\n\nHow do I get started? - If you are a recording customer, and would like to begin sending your documents to the Recorder's office electronically, select a vendor from the e-Recording Vendors list below to review, research, and determine your personal and professional needs.\n\nSimplifile – www.simplifile.com or Phone 800-460-5657.\n\nCorporate Service Company (CSC) - www.erecording.com or Phone 866-652-0111.\n\neRecording Partners Network (ePN) – www.GOePN.com/ or Phone 888-325-3365.\n\nProperty Fraud Alert\n\nProperty Fraud Alert - Be Informed…Be Alert…Be Notified SIGN UP NOW!\n\nThe Clerk of the Circuit Court is pleased to offer a free service to alert property homeowners to potential fraud.
