Do you have records that you don't play any more?\n\nCALL OR EMAIL US!\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nWHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?\n\nWe are interested in PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING!*\n\nSoul, Funk, Blues, Gospel, Rock, Disco, Rap, Heavy Metal, Jazz, New Wave, Punk, Folk, International, Oddball and Weird and all sorts of other things, especially Memphis-related.\n\nMemphis labels - SUN, STAX, ERWIN, HI, METEOR, COVER, SATELLITE, and MORE!\n\nWe do buy 78s if they are Blues or early Rock n Roll.\n\n*We generally do not buy Easy Listening, Big Band Jazz, or Classical. But we will look at whatever you have.\n\nWe can buy huge collections, or small batches. Or one record!\n\nWere you or your relatives in the music business?\n\nDid you or your family own a record store or distributor? Get in touch!\n\nDo you buy storage units or clean out houses? GET IN TOUCH!\n\nWe also buy turntables and vintage amplifiers in working condition.\n\nSorry, no console stereos.\n\nAlso will look at Music-related magazines, press photos, and posters.\n\nCLEAN UP! MAKE SPACE!\n\nGet these things out of your house and make $$$ doing it!\n\nCash paid daily!\n\nCALL US! 901-722-0095\n\n2152 Young Avenue Memphis TN 38104\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nHOW DO YOU BUY THE RECORDS?\n\nWe have to judge visually if the record and cover are in good condition.\n\nCondition matters! We are buying to resell, and our customers are very picky. So we have to be picky as well. We are looking for records in as close to new condition as possible. Yes, we are aware that these things are 50 years old. But our customers are looking to play them, and we need copies free from scratches, dirt, and blemishes. Some rarities we buy despite poor condition, but in general we need very very very clean records. We will, of course, look at whatever you have. Bring 'em in!\n\nWHAT ABOUT EBAY? THIS RECORD IS FOR SALE FOR LOTS OF MONEY ONLINE!\n\nEbay auctions are sometimes a good place to get deals on records- most of the time, however, the records you see are posted online are listed at very optimistic prices and the seller will not actually make a sale at that price.\n\nEven if the record does sell, the seller has to stay on top of communication with the buyer, package the records correctly, ship the records out, and pray the post office doesn't destroy or lose the package. For most people, it's much easier and cost-effective to sell Goner records rather than try to sell them themselves."
