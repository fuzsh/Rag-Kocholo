        "text": "So, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek had his panties up in a bun when Taylor Swift first declined to put her latest album on Spotify, and spoke out about the value of art.\n\nEk's whole rebuttal was essentially that now, thanks to Spotify, artists are at least able to make a little money off of their music rather than having it illegally downloaded. And rather than having anything negative to say about piracy, or showing any sympathy for the artists who's hard work has been raped of it's monetary value, he touted on about how 'now listeners have access to more music than ever before!' (Revealing his belief that people are entitled to whatever music there is to be had.) And as much as I despise to admit it, I suppose this is a valid point. But I don't like the fact that this enormous, wealthy enterprise is fully dependent on piracy for its business model. Why is it that musicians have simply had to cope with people stealing their work, while the cinema and software industries have apparently been able to fight it? Movies are raking in millions but when a big artist drops an album they get $.006 per play. No one gets to name their price anymore, if you want your work to even be heard, you have to succumb. Is it corruption that everyone is in on? Or is there a legitimate reason for this? Please, someone shed some light on this."
