        "text": "It’s quite a different take on this work than Kubelik (probably my favorite), but I like it. The tempo is faster giving it a very different feel. I like listening to different interpretations of favorite works to keep them from getting “stale” to me. Not everyone does, though.\n\nToscanini just does that for you, with him you don't have to be afraid of things getting stale The From the New World Symphony is a prime candidate for getting stale...\n\nTalking of European labels, I recently took a chance on a copy of Dvorak 7 with Sir Colin Davis. Originally on Philips, the one I bought was licenced to Orbis. Sound quality was dreadful, I won't be purchasing any more Orbis releases in a hurry!\n\nNewton Classics is the one to look out for. I bought a good number of Philips recordings that have been \"cut out\" of the Philips catalog (though it is unclear if they will ever reappear under the UM label) but now released under Newton Classics. At any rate, the SQ is uniformly excellent and Newton Classics is a Dutch label IIRC. Don't know about Orbis as this is the first time I hear of the name ...\n\nNewton Classics is a bit better than BC, which always gives me the impression it does limited runs on a CD box and when the inventory runs out, that is it. Newton Classics does price its CD's a bit higher though they are always discounted.\n\nDutch label Newton Classics has reissued Philips, DG and Decca recordings and is distributed by Naxos. It was founded in 2009.\n\nAccording to Discogs Orbis was the record label for classical music of the German record club Ring Der Musikfreunde.\n\nI found a Gustav Leonhardt 'Brandenburg' box set that had three labels on it for Philips, Seon and Orbis! Why on earth do they do that - no way of working out whether it has the original Philips sound quality or not ...\n\nIt was recorded for Seon, released on Philips through Seon's distribution deal with Phonogram at the time, and licensed to Orbis for their club members. The wondrous world of record labels...\n\nSpeaking of record club, I was a BMG Music record club member for a short time back in the late 80's. I found the SQ of the CD's released by the record club quite decent ...\n\nI guess those clubs just got licensing deals with the record labels and didn't remaster the recordings. Reissue labels like Mosaic, Mobile Fidelity, Analogue Productions and Audio Fidelity are a different matter, of course.\n\nGustav Leonhardt made a few Brandenburg Concertos recordings. He was the harpsichordist with Collegium Aureum, a CD twofer. He also recorded with Kuijken and van Asperen, etc, another twofer. The first twofer is released on DHM and the second on Sony according to my computer. But then both are Sony record labels. I also have two of his big boxes, which may have duplicates from these sets. I have not checked who the harpsichordist was in the Harnoncourt's Brandenburg.\n\nBut the BMG Music record club in the US also offered DG, London and Philips titles. In other words, it did not focus solely on RCA, which I believe was already owned by BMG at the time ...\n\nYep, they also got licensing deals with non-BMG labels. I did get a few used BMG Record Club discs with recordings from different labels - not sure I still have them.\n\nStill curious as to why Orbis offers substandard CD's ...\n\nColumbia used to have its own record club before the Sony takeover.\n\nIf I remember correctly Harnoncourt recorded the Brandenburgs more than once. I have his 1981-1983 recordings on Teldec with Concentus Musicus Wien. It doesn't say who the harpsichordist was.\n\nBTW, the music and singing do sound very Russian even if it was not the Red Army Choir or the Leningrad Cowboys singing ...\n\nOMG. I got very lucky today again. Grabbed 50 CAD worth of great LPs,most were 3 CAD each, some 5 CAD and just a couple were $ 8 CAD. 5 were sealed, never played, many Philips, CBS Masterworks promotional copies, CBS Great Performances promo copies as well. I don't know where the owner of this other store (not Recordland) got this stash of vinyl....but they are ALL just waiting there for me!\n\nI have to take photos next weekend and upload them to my Facebook album so I can share them here.\n\nAnyway....on the TT while admiring my loot!\n\nI watched a special on TV in commemoration of the 300th birthday of JS Bach in 1985 when the Concentus Musicus performed the Brandenburg Concertos. The venue was some courtyard in Cöthen, the home base for JS during a period when he was most productive in his music compositions. I would have thought a DVD should have been released in connection with this occasion. IIRC, I also made a home VHS recording of that special. I also have a DVD by the Concentus Musicus but that might be entirely separate from the audio recording you just mentioned ...\n\nPerhaps Harnoncourt might have recorded the Brandenburg Concertos three times but only once for audio.\n\nNo wonder you were hardly on the forum earlier ..."
