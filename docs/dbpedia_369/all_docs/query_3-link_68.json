        "text": "There's nothing like listening to some music on vinyl — if you're a record collector, this is likely your mantra. Phoenix has no shortage of audiophiles. Whether you're looking for some B-sides, exported rarities, classic albums, or just some new releases for the needle to hit, you can find everything you need and more at Phoenix's locally owned record stores. Check out some of our picks for the best record stores in Phoenix. (Please make sure to verify store hours before visiting.)\n\nAnd if you're looking for some great local music, check out our roundup of musicians from Greater Phoenix!\n\nStinkweeds\n\nEven if you don't collect vinyl records, going to Stinkweeds is a rite of passage in Phoenix. The uptown Phoenix record store opened in 1987, and throughout the years it has been a tried-and-true stop for touring bands to perform or local acts to play a pop-up show. Here, you can find all genres of music on vinyl, CD and cassette, with 80 listening stations to check out your picks, and an incredibly knowledgeable and dedicated staff. After you're done picking up some new tunes, stop by Frances next door for all kinds of items full of local love.\n\n12 W. Camelback Road, Phoenix\n\n602-248-9461\n\nstinkweeds.com\n\nZia Records\n\nZia Records first came on the scene in 1980, and over the years it has grown into a mini-empire of Southwest record stores, with five locations in Greater Phoenix, one in Tucson, and two in Las Vegas. You'll find a solid vinyl collection at any location, as well as a number of other goodies you're looking for, including CDs, videos, tapes, posters, comics and more. Zia has always been a big advocate of the local music scene as well, so keep your eye out for special compilations and performances (in the future).\n\nMultiple Locations\n\nziarecords.com\n\nGrand Avenue Records\n\nWhen you have an area as funky as Historic Grand Avenue near downtown Phoenix, you need some funky grooves to go along with it. Grand Avenue Records is a newcomer compared with many other legacy record stores in Greater Phoenix, but it has become a staple of the hip, artsy area. You'll be able to find a swath of white label records here, as well as a collection of other music gifts.\n\n1504 Grand Ave., Phoenix\n\n602-730-2991\n\ngrandaverecords.com\n\nTracks in Wax\n\nSince its opening in 1982, Tracks in Wax has increasingly become the go-to spot for the hardcore vinyl junkies, and for good reason. If you're looking for some rare, hard-to-find releases and limited editions, this is the place to go. Tracks in Wax is especially well known for its collection of Pink Floyd albums — owner Timmy Stamper has a \"world-class collection\" of records, imports and variations. While you're in the area, head up the street for some great dining and shopping at Uptown Plaza.\n\n4741 N. Central Ave., Phoenix\n\n602-274-2660\n\ntracksinwax.net\n\nGrace Records\n\nThis Gilbert record store is one of the newest on the scene, opening in 2017, but don't let its youth fool you. Owner Darren Skarecky opened Grace Records using his father's collection of tens of thousands of records. The real appeal of this spot is that collection of used records, which makes up more than 80% of the store's inventory, is priced at only $3 a piece. Find all your classic rock needs, as well as a solid roundup of hip-hop and R&B artists here.\n\n2200 E. Williams Field Road #112, Gilbert\n\n480-534-0681\n\ngracerecord.com\n\nAsylum Records\n\nIf you didn't get the hint from the name, Asylum Records is your go-to shop for rock and metal vinyl. The record store boasts an impressive collection of metal artists, both old and new, though you can still find other genres if need be. Asylum Records also has a massive collection of cassette tapes and Funko pops, so if your collecting sensibilities expand beyond just vinyl, you'll have a good time here. While you're shopping, make sure to give the resident cat a few pets as well."
