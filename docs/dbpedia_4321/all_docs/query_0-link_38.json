        "text": "Dr Emily McIntosh is a passionate advocate of early intervention and transitional support, peer learning, learning development, and academic advising (personal tutoring) as key components of student success. These are evidenced in the six pillars of Emily’s Early Intervention and Transitional Support (EI) Model which forms the basis of her National Teaching Fellowship claim and is reflected in her peer-reviewed publications.\n\nEmily’s career has been devoted to, and inspired by, her passion for the student journey, championing vulnerable and under-represented students in Higher Education. Emily’s practice has had a huge impact on academic advising and transforming student learning, both nationally and internationally.\n\nEmily’s impact has been recognised through Principal Fellowship (PFHEA, 2017) and the National Language In Learning Across the Curriculum (LILAC) Digital Literacy Award (2018). Emily is Director of Learning, Teaching and Student Experience at Middlesex University, London. She taught undergraduates at Keele and Liverpool (2004-08), joining the University of Manchester in 2008 to work with postgraduates and in undergraduate student support. Emily moved to Bolton where she was Associate Director of Student Life (2015-2017) and Director of Student Life (2017-2019). Emily’s role at Middlesex involves cross-institutional leadership for learning and teaching including student transition, technology enhanced learning (TEL), academic practice, equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI), academic advising and student engagement. Emily’s international profile in academic advising is visible in her role as Vice-Chair (Research) and Trustee of UK Advising and Tutoring (UKAT), Academic Board Member of the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA) Centre for Research at Kansas State University, USA, and her recent work with the Regional Universities Network (RUN), implementing the hallmarks of her EI Model in Australia.\n\nEmily’s claim charts her professional journey, the development of her EI Model and her contribution, beyond her substantive posts, to international sector-wide work and research on early intervention and to establish advising (personal tutoring) as core pedagogical practice. Emily has worked with various Higher Education charitable organisations, mission groups, networks and fora. Her current work continues to establish the EI Model as a key vehicle within which to connect and curate the student learning experience, facilitate transition, and champion EDI in the curriculum."
