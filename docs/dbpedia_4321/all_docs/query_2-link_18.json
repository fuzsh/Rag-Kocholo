        "text": "is a 5 song EP based on the poems of Emily Dickinson. The lyrics of each song correspond word-for-word with one of Dickinson's poems, with the exception of \"XXXI\" which is an instrumental track.\n\nI wrote the music and recorded the instruments myself, while my friend Aida Riddle contributed the vocals. Aida currently fronts Signal, a New York-based punk band.\n\nInspiration: This project, which began in early 2014 and was completed in March 2018, was inspired by Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), to whom my father's family is related. Dickinson, while one of America's most celebrated poets, is known to have been an extremely reclusive person. Her nearly complete avoidance of the outside world meant her creative genius went largely undiscovered during her lifetime, but her desire to describe her world through poetry never waned. As someone who struggles with social anxiety myself, Emily's tendency to retreat from social interaction and spend her time creating in solitude is something I've always identified with."
