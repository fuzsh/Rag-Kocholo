        "text": "Thought-provoking and entertaining, Hickory Community Theatre presents THE LIFESPAN OF A FACT, November 11th-19th in the Firemen's Kitchen.\n\nMaking her Hickory Community Theatre debut as Emily Penrose, a magazine editor caught between dueling egos and journalistic ethics, is Joan Schmid.\n\nA former resident of La Palma, California—named \"Dairyland\" when it was first incorporated in 1955—Schmid and her husband recently relocated to Hickory to start their next chapter as retirees.\n\nSchmid studied Theatre Arts at Fullerton College and the University of California Los Angeles, where she appeared in such productions as THE TAMING OF THE SHREW, THE CRUCIBLE, and CAROUSEL. Schmid's love of entertainment then took her to the \"show biz\" side of things, where she worked in casting, talent representation, and entertainment law.\n\nIt was when Schmid read the description of THE LIFESPAN OF A FACT and character Emily Penrose—\"strong and direct\" as Schmid describes it—that she decided to take the acting plunge again and audition for the show. Now back on stage , Schmid is enjoying the opportunity to perform in what, for her, typifies Hickory Community Theatre's commitment to diverse programming. \"There is something for everyone.\"\n\nPerformances of THE LIFESPAN OF A FACT are Fridays and Saturdays, November 11th through 19th at 7:30 PM; Sunday, November 13th at 2:30 PM; and, Thursday, November 17th at 7:30 PM. Tickets are $16 for adults, $10 for youth and students.\n\nTickets are available online at hickorytheatre.org, or by phone at 828-328-2283. The theatre box office is open from 12-5 PM Wednesday through Friday, or one half-hour before a performance.\n\nDue to the continued risk of COVID-19 in Catawba County, and in accordance with the latest guidance from the CDC, the Hickory Community Theatre encourages patrons to wear a mask or other face covering while inside the building.\n\nTHE LIFESPAN OF A FACT is rated R for adult language.\n\nTHE LIFESPAN OF A FACT is produced in association with Hickory Allergy, Asthma & Sinus. The Hickory Community Theatre’s 74th season is sponsored by Paramount Automotive, SunBelt Xpress and Frye Regional Medical Center. HCT is a funded affiliate of the United Arts Council of Catawba County."
