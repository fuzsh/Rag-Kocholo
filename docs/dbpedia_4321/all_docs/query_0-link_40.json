        "text": "Pennsylvania Hospital is founded\n\nPennsylvania Hospital, Eighth and Pine streets. William Birch print, c. 1800. Founded in 1751 as the first hospital in the Colonies, it also became the first place to provide clinical instruction to the first medical students in what would become the United States. As of 1767, requirements for a Penn medical degree included one year attending the practice of the hospital. Students purchased tickets for hospital privileges, which included use of the library. In 1997, Penn’s long-standing relationship with Pennsylvania Hospital was formalized with the latter’s merger into the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Courtesy Pennsylvania Hospital Historic Collections, Philadelphia\n\nWilliam Shippen Jr.'s Anatomical Drawings\n\nFor his anatomy lectures, William Shippen Jr. used anatomical drawings and casts made by the famous Dutch painter, Jan Van Rymsdyk. Before Penn established a medical school, Shippen conducted lectures in anatomy, surgery, bandaging, and midwifery in the Anatomical Theatre, located on his father’s property, today’s 12-14 North Fourth Street. This facility continued to serve as the anatomy laboratory and lecture hall for the new medical school. In the mid-1780s, Shippen built a house on another of his father’s properties at the southwest corner of Fourth and Locust streets. His Anatomical Theatre operated here until the University erected a new building for anatomy and chemistry on Fifth Street in 1791. Courtesy Pennsylvania Hospital Historic Collections, Philadelphia.

John Morgan, the newly appointed professor of medicine, taught this first course of lectures on materia medica and physic at his house. He handwrote the ticket on the back of an ordinary playing card, a common alternative before printed cards became the norm.\n\nJohn Morgan, College of Philadelphia\n\nIn 1757, John Morgan graduated in the first class of undergraduates from the College of Philadelphia. While an undergraduate, he studied medicine under John Redman and worked at Pennsylvania Hospital as resident apothecary. At the time, this was enough medical training for him to serve as a surgeon during the French and Indian War. He subsequently earned a medical degree at Edinburgh in 1763 and began to formulate his ideas for starting a medical school in Philadelphia. Upon his return in 1765, Morgan presented his proposal to the Trustees of the College of Philadelphia, one of whom was his mentor. The College embraced his concept for a university-based medical school and made him the first professor of medicine in America. Morgan took leave from teaching during the American Revolution to serve as director-general of the Army’s hospital, located in Boston. From 1775 to 1777 he struggled to establish a medical service that was hampered by supply shortages, logistics, an outbreak of smallpox, and a lack of understanding of health issues by Congress and the military. Morgan bore the brunt of blame for the problems. Shippen replaced him, not without controversy. Morgan never returned to teaching, although he resumed his position on the medical staff at Pennsylvania Hospital.\n\nJonathan Elmer's diploma\n\nJonathan Elmer’s diploma for a medical degree, 1771. Elmer had been part of the first class of 10 medical students, who in 1768 received their bachelor of medicine degrees. He and three classmates subsequently completed the requisite three years of professional experience and Latin thesis to earn their M.D. diplomas, the first such degrees Penn’s medical school ever awarded. Elmer’s is the only known original of these documents to survive. His great-grandson, Walter Gray Elmer (M 1897), donated it to the University in 1957.\n\nAnatomical Theatre\n\nAnatomical Theatre, Fifth Street, home of the Medical Department’s anatomy and chemistry departments, 1791-1807. The building was also known as Anatomical Hall, The Laboratory, and from William Birch’s 1799 print, Surgeons’ Hall. It became Penn’s and the nation’s first building used exclusively for medical teaching. Two teachers, more than 100 students, and likely several cadavers were crowded into a room no larger than 27 x 35 feet.\n\nObservations Upon the Origin of the Malignant Bilious\n\nObservations Upon the Origin of the Malignant Bilious, or Yellow Fever in Philadelphia (1799). Rush became known for his aggressive and controversial approaches to combatting yellow fever with bleeding and purging.

Prior to the famous expedition to the West, in 1803 President Thomas Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis to Philadelphia to meet with Penn medical faculty. Benjamin Rush taught Lewis about frontier illnesses and the procedure for bloodletting; he also provided the Corps of Discovery with a medical kit. Benjamin Smith Barton, professor of natural history, provided expertise on botany and paleontology.\n\nDissection Kit\n\nAnatomist Caspar Wistar’s dissection kit, c. 1808.

Horner describes Tensor Tarsi muscle\n\nTensor tarsi muscle (Horner’s muscle), first described by William E. Horner (M 1814) in 1824. Horner was a preeminent anatomist, surgeon, dedicated teacher, and, as dean for an unprecedented three decades, a leader who left his mark on Penn’s medical school.\n\nArchitectural scroll\n\nArchitectural scroll, an artifact from the faculty room of the 1829 building, carved by Mordecai K. Van Horn.\n\nNinth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania\n\nNinth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Medical Hall (left) and College Hall (right), home of the University, 1829-1872, and its Medical Department, 1829-1873. Medical Hall contained the Anatomical Museum, dissecting laboratories, and three lecture rooms through which students rotated every two hours. Its construction added debt to the medical faculty, stepping up the need for high attendance numbers at their lectures. William Strickland designed the Federal-style buildings. 1830 watercolor by J.G. Caldelaugh\n\nChemical laboratory and lecture room of Robert Hare\n\nChemical laboratory and lecture room of Robert Hare, 1831. When the University hired architect William Strickland to design the twin buildings for the Ninth Street campus in 1829, Hare worked with Strickland to create a space that best suited his needs for teaching, research, and demonstrations while providing proper ventilation, heat, and light. Courtesy National Library of Medicine.\n\nAnatomy Museum\n\nAnatomy Museum. Founded in the first quarter of the 19th century, the museum consisted of Caspar Wistar’s collection, specimens donated by Pennsylvania Hospital, and a substantial addition of specimens provided by William Horner. It was available to medical students two mornings a week and, according to an 1844 catalogue of the Medical Department, was “abundantly furnished with preparations of every kind calculated to give the fullest illustration of a course of Anatomical lectures.”\n\nRoper’s Gymnasium\n\nRoper’s Gymnasium, 274 Market Street, 1831. In 1831, the Trustees entered into an agreement with Roper to admit students one hour each day, under his personal supervision to help avoid accidents, for the discounted annual rate of $10 rather than $20 for gym membership. In return, the Trustees appointed Roper the University’s Teacher of Gymnastics. Courtesy Library Company of Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia Hospital\n\nPhiladelphia Hospital (later Philadelphia General Hospital), part of the Philadelphia “Blockley” Almshouse, relocated to West Philadelphia in 1832. David J. Kennedy watercolor, 1889. Because students attended lectures all day for two years, it became harder for the faculty to enforce the apprenticeship system for clinical training. Pennsylvania Hospital and Philadelphia Hospital would continue to fill that gap until the University moved to West Philadelphia in the 1870s and opened a hospital of its own. In the interim, medical students rode the omnibuses to Philadelphia Hospital. Courtesy Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nHenry H Smith's Anatomical Atlas\n\nHenry H. Smith’s Anatomical Atlas, Illustrative of the Structure of the Human Body, 1845. The illustration on this title page depicts an anatomical lecture in Medical Hall.\n\nJoseph Leidy\n\nJoseph Leidy (M 1844) brought a different perspective to the professorship of anatomy when he succeeded the late William Horner to the position in 1853. Unlike his surgeon-anatomist predecessors, Leidy took the lectern as a naturalist, one with a formidable reputation at an early age. He had already founded the field of vertebrate palæontology in America and made important discoveries in botany, comparative anatomy, geology, and mineralogy. His work with microscopy advanced the field of public health. Leidy identified the Trichina spiralis in pigs that causes trichinosis and the link between hookworms and pernicious anæmia. In 1853, six years before Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species, Leidy wrote his views on evolution and natural selection; he subsequently recommended Darwin for election to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Leidy chaired anatomy at Penn’s medical school for nearly four decades while founding and heading the University’s Department of Biology. He served as medical dean from 1877 to 1888. The Laboratory of Biology, built on Hamilton Walk in 1910, bears his name.\n\nPlate from Dermatological Illustration Collection\n\nPlate from Dermatological Illustration Collection donated by Louis A.

Kelley\n\nWilliam N. Kelley, executive vice president of the University, dean of the School of Medicine, and chief executive officer of the Medical Center and later the Health System. Kelley came to Penn as a world leader in the study of purine metabolism, a pioneer in the field of clinical genetics, and a proven builder of programs, facilities, and faculty from his tenure as the University of Michigan’s chair of Internal Medicine. At Penn, he created the prototype of an academic, integrated delivery system, a network of physician practices, hospitals, and other clinical settings that provided continuous training settings for medical students and residents. Kelley brought Presbyterian Hospital, and Pennsylvania Hospital, and multispecialty facilities under the University of Pennsylvania Health System umbrella. Research programs exploded at Penn with Kelley’s ability to attract talented investigators and funding and to build laboratory facilities. He led the medical school to new heights in research income and overall rankings and oversaw the development of a new curriculum for the 21st century.\n\n21st Century Endowed Scholars Program\n\nIn 1992, Walter Gamble (M 1957) and his wife, Anne, established the 21st Century Endowed Scholars Program so that Penn Medicine students could have the freedom to pursue the medical careers of their choice without being constrained by financial concerns. It was only in 1996 that the identities of these visionary donors were revealed. Since its beginnings, as the debt borne by medical students has continued to rise, the program has covered the full four-year tuition of more than 220 students. The Gambles are shown surrounded by many of the medical students they have supported over the years.\n\nAbramson Cancer Center\n\nMadlyn and Leonard Abramson. In 1997, the Abramsons gave a $100-million gift that kick-started Penn’s present-day cancer research powerhouse, known as the Abramson Cancer Center.
