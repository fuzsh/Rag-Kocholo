        "text": "Hailed by The Hollywood Reporter as “truly scintillating” and The New York Times as “terrifically engaging,” this fast-moving, provocative play is next up. A critically acclaimed 2018 Broadway play, The Lifespan of a Fact is a fast-paced story exploding in blistering comedy and timely relevance. The play is written by Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell and is based on the book by John D’Agata and Jim Fingal.\n\nFacts become blurry when they’re twisted for effect in the high-stakes world of publishing. Emily Penrose, the demanding editor-in-chief of a high-end magazine, hires a determined millennial fact-checker named Jim Fingal to work on a groundbreaking essay written by the famous author John D’Agata. The deadline is tight, the essay is dense, and everyone must make a good-faith effort to tell the story honestly. But, the overly eager Jim takes his fact-checking way too far. The seasoned essayist John has written what he sees as the truth of a boy’s life. Emily must negotiate between them and decide whether to publish or not… the ultimate showdown of fact versus truth.\n\nThe cast includes Elisabeth Henry, Jett Hernandez, and Rick Meyer. Sydnie Grosberg Ronga directs the show and was recently one of our directors for the highly successful Short Play Festival, Love is Love, The LGBTQ+ Plays. Sydnie is also the co-director of Round The Bend Theatre Company in Saugerties.\n\nAfter the performances Sydnie will lead a lively discussion on the themes and impressions of the play.\n\nPlease note that the play contains strong language, and the storyline references an essay about a young man’s suicide."
