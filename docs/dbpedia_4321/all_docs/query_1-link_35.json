Jim Fingal, a fact checker for a struggling New York magazine, realizes the essay written by the famous John D'Agata has the potential to revive or destroy the magazine. However, as he dives deeper into the piece, the tension between truth and fiction evolves, as does the growing comedic and intense clash between him and D'Agata. Meanwhile, Emily Penrose, editor-in-chief, finds herself caught amid the men's argument as she attempts to save the magazine. Based on a true story, The Lifespan of a Fact contemplates truth and falsity, the line between truth and fiction, and how creative non-fiction conveys a story.
