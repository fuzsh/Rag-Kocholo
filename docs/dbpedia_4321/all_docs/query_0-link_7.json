The following document serves as a visual companion to that event.\n\nThe evening will feature Jane Robinson, an Honorary Associate of Somerville and the noted author of such crackling social histories as Bluestockings and Ladies Can’t Climb Ladders, in conversation with Maya Szaniecki, the Somerville JCR Women’s Officer. Their conversation will be shaped by looking through some of the key archival material created to mark the anniversary by the Somerville College Library, including the wonderful tome that is the Somerville College Log Book.\n\nIn these pages, alongside a few other artefacts from the period, Maya and Jane will trace the history of the conferral of degrees upon women from the historic resistance to the idea expressed by eminent Victorians such as Dean Burgon to the increasingly vocal and occasionally sardonic demands from women students that they should be admitted to degrees.\n\nFor reference, each picture will have a short description below it and our speakers will aim to refer to each item they are considering so you can have two browsers open during the event, one with their live feed and one with the images.\n\nImage 1: Somerville Diploma, 1907\n\nImages 2-3: The Going-Down Play 1916\n\nImage 4: Women Gain the Right to Study Medicine\n\nImage 5: The Impact of the Sexual Disqualification (Removal) Act\n\nImages 6 and 7: Cultural Responses to ‘The Undergraduette’\n\nOther Highlights From The Exhibition"
