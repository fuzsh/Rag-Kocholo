        "text": "\"The robust criticism of contemporaries is most salutary, and we, undoubtedly, had the sense to profit from it.\" \"The lecturer expoundeth what we think we think, And why we think we think we do.\" Not Old, Madam, Vintage Charis Ursula Barnett Frankenburg, 1975: 63, 61 …companions in this airy hermitage… Gaudy Night Dorothy L. Sayers, 1935: Ch. 11 The women students at Oxford University, prior to 1920, found themselves in somewhat of a curious situation. They were allowed to attend university, take classes and exams, prove their academic value, but they were not allowed to receive degrees. In point of fact, women attending Oxford University prior to October 7, 1920 1 were not given the rights of matriculation, that is, of full student status. They were there 'on probation,' a situation of which these women students were very well aware. 2 However, acceptance to the university was certainly an honor and sought, in fact coveted, by young learned women at the time. Within the Oxford world, Somerville College was noted to be the 'school for women' rather than the 'school for ladies.' From its early days, this college encouraged a strong spirit of individualism among its students. 3 Somerville's proudly held reputation was certainly attractive to the young independent woman scholar of the day. The principal of Somerville at the time was Emily Penrose, a strict but forward thinking administrator who made the raising of academic standards one of her chief objectives. She believed that women should take the full degree course even if the degree itself was denied them. Emily Penrose's insistence upon fulfillment of the degree requirements by Somerville students facilitated the later validation, in 1920, of their right to an official Oxford degree. 4\n\nDorothy L. Sayers is most famous for her detective fiction, particularly the mystery novels involving Lord Peter Wimsey. Her greatest gift to history, however, is the application of a faithful concept of vocation to her art. Based on a speech delivered to the Archbishop of York’s conference in Malvern, 1941, it appears Sayers had something like a transformationalist view according to Niebuhr’s model. She saw withdrawing from the culture and becoming one with the culture as a pair of matched dangers. The first effectively privatizes Christianity and the second denatures it. Accordingly, Sayers believed the Church must do the impossible: without becoming identified with cultural institutions, it must redeem those institutions. The church must influence morality, but not get tied to the moralistic aspects of cultural institutions. This essay presents the case that Sayers was a cautious transformationalist. She believed that Christianity could permeate and redeem every form of art and every institution to improve it and make it more consistent with God’s creational design. In a period of growing cultural marginalization, Sayers’ example presents a way for Christians to point people toward a robust understanding of human flourishing.\n\nDrawing on new archival research into book history, letters and periodical literature, this chapter explores the critical narratives around what it meant to be a woman writer between 1830 and 1880 via a focus on case studies of two Irish woman writers: Maria Edgeworth (1768–1849) and Mrs S. C. Hall (1800–1881). This focused approach allows a comprehensive placing of Irish women writers within the developing literary marketplace of their time and consideration of the extent to which the contemporary critical reception of their work has shaped subsequent scholarship. In doing so, the chapter uncovers a narrative of peaks and troughs, epitomised by periods of great esteem and critical disdain, and highlights the fluctuating patterns of visibility and invisibility of literary productions in the nineteenth century and beyond."
