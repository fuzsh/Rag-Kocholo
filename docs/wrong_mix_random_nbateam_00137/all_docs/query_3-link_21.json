The team generated around 291 million U.S. dollars in revenue during the 2021/22 season and their operating income for that season amounted to approximately 81 U.S. dollars. As of 2022, the franchise value for the Portland Trail Blazers amounted to an estimated 2.1 billion U.S. dollars and the team has been owned by Microsoft’s co-founder, Paul Allen, since 1988.\n\nThe team has advanced to the NBA finals three times - in 1977, 1990, and 1992 - and won its only NBA championship during its first appearance in the finals in 1977. The Blazers have a combined total of approximately four million fans and followers on Facebook and Twitter."
