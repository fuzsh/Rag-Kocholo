        "text": "Someone should probably check the rims after that one. The summer Sixers just came up short 97-95 to the Portland Trail Blazers Monday night. Jared McCann McCain had another poor shooting line after starting strong, finishing with 11 points shooting 3-of-16 from the field.\n\nRicky Council IV continued to find creative ways to get to the free throw line, finishing with 18 points on 14 attempts from the line, while Adem Bona pushed the limits of Summer League rules, finishing with eight points, four boards, three blocks and seven fouls.\n\nHere are some thoughts at the buzzer.\n\nEven for the standards of July, it wasn’t a great start for Philly as they turned the ball over 15 times in the first half. While most of the offense looked rough early, McCain did not. He continued to emphasize not just getting up threes, but getting them up at unique and difficult angles. He was able to knock down some impressive ones early.\n\nHe looked like he ran out of gas in the second half, missing all eight of his field goal attempts, including a healthy three to win it. He also took the five-second violation that turned them over with seven seconds remaining.\n\nHe was not the only Sixers rookie to struggle. The downside of Bona’s motor and aggression showed when he racked up seven fouls in 18 minutes of action. He did recover in the second half somewhat, having a fun exchange with the seventh overall pick Donovan Clingan as they exchanged dunks. Bona kicked it off by rotating over and swatting one of his shots away.\n\nJeff Dowtin Jr. and Judah Mintz both had some nice buckets they created for themselves in this game. Council hit his quota for reverse dunks and hit a logo three with the shot clock winding down, but they did not quite have enough as a unit to pull out a win tonight."
