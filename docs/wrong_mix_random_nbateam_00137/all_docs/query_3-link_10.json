That’s why NBA teams seek the most talented physicians on the planet to diagnose and treat their players, because there is so much at stake. The Portland Trail Blazers choose to partner with Rebound Orthopedics & Neurosurgery for their elite athletes’ care.\n\nRebound doctors have been the team physicians for the Blazers since 1994. Dr. James Chesnutt, Dr. Evan Ellis, Dr. Karl Kaluza, and Dr. Donald Roberts are sports medicine specialists who dedicate their time to serving as team physicians for the Blazers.\n\nBut, you don’t have to be an athlete to be seen by the region’s most preferred orthopedic practice. Call 1-800-Rebound or request an appointment online to be seen by one of the same doctors who treat elite NBA athletes.\n\nTeam Physicians for the Portland Trail Blazers"
