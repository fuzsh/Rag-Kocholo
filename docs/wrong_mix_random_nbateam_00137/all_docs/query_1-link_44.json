At his position he had access to a top secret computer network which connected the defense intelligence agencies of Canada, the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTaiwan announced that a former air force officer, YUAN Hsiao-feng, has been given 12 life sentences for spying for China. Coming only a few years after the high-profile arrest of the Army Major General who commanded the communications and electronics department, Lo Hsien-Che, and the current unraveling of the Chang Chih-hsin Spy Network in the Navy, this case further highlights a thorough penetration of the Taiwanese military by Chinese intelligence.\n\nThe aggressiveness of Chinese espionage efforts is also evident in major cybersecurity incidents reported in the United States this week implicating China. In the past few days, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post have all announced they were the victims of a broad campaign to infiltrate their computer systems and monitor U.S. media coverage of China. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy has admitted that it was the victim of a major cyber hacking in mid-January, which resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of hundreds of employee and contractor Personally Identifiable Information. MAJOR CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS: 2010 - Present\n\nIn counterterrorism news, Bulgaria has officially tied Hezbollah to the July 2012 suicide bombing attack against Israeli tourists at Burgas International Airport. The U.S. has called on Europe to do more disrupt Hezbollah's terrorist operations in Europe, and Iran has rejected accusations of its involvement.\n\nif you are not a subscriber to the CiCentre's SPYPEDIA, you are missing a lot of the latest documents and news on espionage and counterterrorism.

A jihadist website posted a new threat by al Qaeda this week that promises to conduct \"shocking\" attacks on the United States and the West.\n\nThe posting appeared on the Ansar al Mujahidin network Sunday and carried the headline, \"Map of al Qaeda and its future strikes.\"\n\nThe message, in Arabic, asks: \"Where will the next strike by al Qaeda be?\"\n\n\"The answer for it, in short: The coming strikes by al Qaeda, with God's Might, will be in the heart of the land of nonbelief, America, and in France, Denmark, other countries in Europe, in the countries that helped and are helping France, and in other places that shall be named by al Qaeda at other times,\" the threat states.\n\nThe attacks will be \"strong, serious, alarming, earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying.\"\n\nUnder a section of the post on the method of the attacks, the unidentified writer said the strikes would be \"group and lone-wolf operations, in addition to the use of booby-trapped vehicles.\" [Read more: Gertz/WashingtonTimes/30January2013]\n\nSpotlight on DoD Special Access Programs. The procedures for establishing, managing and overseeing special access programs [SAPs] in the Department of Defense are spelled out in an updated DoD Instruction that was issued yesterday. See \"Management, Administration, and Oversight of DoD Special Access Programs,\" DoD Instruction 5205.11, February 6, 2013.\n\nA special access program is a classified program that employs security measures above and beyond those that would normally be used to protect ordinary (or \"collateral\") classified information. Such measures may include special eligibility reviews, polygraph testing, cover, and other controls on information. Within DoD, SAPs fall into three broad topical categories: intelligence, acquisition, and operations and support.\n\nDoD SAPs have been a focus of controversy in the past, because their intensive secrecy seemed to foster mismanagement. There were massive, multi-billion dollar failures [e.g., the aborted A-12 naval aircraft program] as well as the occasional eccentricity [e.g., the Timber Wind nuclear powered rocket for anti-ballistic missile missions], both of which triggered Inspector General audits.\n\nBecause of those kinds of missteps, \"The special access classification system\" is now adversely affecting the national security it is intended to support,\" the House Armed Services Committee concluded in 1991 [H.Rept. 102-60, p. 101].\n\nBut such concerns are expressed less frequently today. [Read more: Aftergood/SecrecyNews/7February2013]\n\nVision Takes Shape For Bethesda Intelligence Community Campus. Thursday evening, officials with the Army Corps of Engineers are set to detail design elements and a construction timeline for the Intelligence Community Campus being developed on Bethesda's Sangamore Road.\n\nThe federal facility is the former site of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. NGIA employees were transferred in to Virginia in 2011 as a part of the federally mandated Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] process.\n\nAbout 3,000 intelligence workers - about the same number of employees that worked at NGIA - are expected to work at the campus, which is being developed by the Army Corps and the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nAccording to the Army Corps of Engineers project website:\n\n\"The redevelopment is necessary because: 1] there is a shortage of secured administrative building space in the Washington National Capital area; 2] a shared intelligence community campus supports congressional desires for a collaborative community environment and the consolidation of an intelligence community facility strategy; and 3] it supports the reuse of existing government facilities.\n\nThe re-development plan calls for removing one of the site's four buildings and combining the remaining three buildings into one facility, according to the site.

A court jailed Italy's former military intelligence chief for 10 years on Tuesday for the kidnapping of an Egyptian Muslim cleric in an operation organised by the United States.\n\nAn American former CIA station chief was earlier this month given a seven-year jail sentence after imam Abu Omar was snatched from a Milan street in 2003 and flown to Egypt for interrogation during the U.S. \"war on terror\".\n\nMilan appeals court judges sentenced Niccolo Pollari, former head of the Sismi military intelligence agency, to 10 years and jailed his former deputy Marco Mancini for nine years.\n\nFormer Rome CIA station chief Jeffrey Castelli and two other American officials were convicted in their absence and are unlikely to serve their sentences. [WorldBulletin/12February2013]\n\nRetired Intelligence Officer Gets 13 Years for Coup Plot. A Moscow court has sentenced a 64-year-old retired colonel of military intelligence to 13 years in prison for plotting an armed rebellion in central Russia's Vladimir Region in 2010.\n\nVladimir Kvachkov pleaded not guilty to the charges, but admitted he had been organizing guerilla groups \"to fight foreign intervention.\" However, the prosecutors insisted that Kvachkov had plotted a coup because he was extremely unhappy with the country's current political system. Their evidence included books, articles and other propaganda seized from the retired officer's apartment.\n\nKvachkov's earlier speech in court was so openly anti-Semitic that the Judge had to interrupt it.\n\nProsecutors also noted that Kvachkov and his accomplice, 62-year-old Aleksandr Kiselyov, managed to form a troop of about 10 pensioners who were equally unhappy with authorities on the federal and local level. The group planned to start an uprising in the town of Kovrov, in Vladimir Region and then proceed with a march to Moscow, which is 266km to the west. The rebellion was scheduled to begin on July 24, 2010, but the organizers were detained much earlier.\n\nThe judges ruled against stripping Kvachkov and Kiselyov of their officer ranks.\n\nKvachkov became famous in 2005 when he was arrested and charged with an attempt on the life of Anatoly Chubais - the mastermind of President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms, who at that time headed the national power grid RAO UES. [Read more: Stenin/RIANovosti/8February2013]\n\nJeffrey Paul Delisle, Canadian Navy Officer, Convicted Of Spying For Russia. A Canadian navy intelligence officer who pleaded guilty to selling military secrets to Russia was sentenced Friday to 20 years in prison.\n\nSub-Lt. Jeffrey Paul Delisle will serve 18 years and five months behind bars because of time he has already served, Provincial court Judge Patrick Curran said. Curran also ordered Delisle to pay a fine of nearly CA$111,817 [$111,700].\n\nDelisle, 41, pleaded guilty in October to espionage for selling secrets to the Russians. He worked at a naval intelligence center and had access to information shared by Canada, the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The prosecution said he would search for Russian references on his work computer, transfer it to a USB key, then take it home and paste it into an email program that he shared with his Russian handler.\n\nIn an agreed statement of facts, Delisle admitted that his treachery began when he walked into the Russian embassy in Ottawa in July 2007 and offered his services for money.\n\nJudge Curran said Friday that Delisle \"coldly and rationally\" offered his services to Russia.\n\nDelisle was arrested in January 2012 - the first person to be charged under Canada's Security of Information Act, which was passed after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. [Read more: AP/8February2013]\n\nS. Korea Spy Agency Says More Nuclear Tests Possible. South Korea's spy agency warned that North Korea might conduct another nuclear test after Pyongyang detonated what it said was a miniaturised atomic device on Tuesday.\n\nThe warning came during a briefing to lawmakers by the head of the National Intelligence Service, Won Hei-Soon, Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nThe briefing raised \"the possibility for another nuclear test by the North\" or a ballistic missile test once the UN Security Council begins discussions on imposing new sanctions on Pyongyang, Yonhap said.\n\n\"The North may stage other provocations to distract international efforts to impose more sanctions on the North or to push China to eventually side with Pyongyang,\" Won was quoted as saying.\n\nDespite the North's claim that Tuesday's test was of a \"miniaturised and lighter atomic bomb\", Won said his agency did not believe Pyongyang had yet succeeded in \"weaponising its nuclear bombs\". [Read more: AFP/12February2013]\n\nSection II - CONTEXT & PRECEDENCE\n\nEx-Spy Reveals Shadowy World of CIA. As a scientific intelligence officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, Gene Poteat specialized in radar technology.\n\nHe could make fake aircraft appear on Soviet radar screens.\n\nIn 1964, he analyzed radar images from the Gulf of Tonkin and tried unsuccessfully to dissuade the White House from escalating the war in Vietnam.\n\nNow 83, Poteat is retired from the agency. But he still plays a role in the shadow world of intelligence as president of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers - current and former spies who educate the public on the importance of things that happen in secret.\n\nDuring a visit to Tampa on Monday to speak to the organization's second-largest chapter, Poteat said what he sees on his radar screen now is both encouraging and worrisome.\n\nThe intelligence community, said Poteat, \"is in better shape than it's ever been. It's more robust than ever.\"\n\nIts capabilities have been enhanced, he said, by working closely with U.S. Special Operations Command. [Read more: Altman/TampaTribune/6February2013]\n\nThe Army's Special Branch: How Bizarre Fake Spy Trees Appeared in No-Man's Land during WWI. Built using steel and wrought iron, these are no normal trees.\n\nThey are camouflaged weapons of war used to devastating effect during World War I on the Western Front.\n\nThe bizarre fake tree observation posts were built to spy on the enemy after switching them under cover of darkness with real battle-scarred stumps left in no-man's land.\n\nWith a perfect elevated position overlooking the enemy and the element of surprise, historians say the outposts were surprisingly successful.\n\nBoth sides used real trees for observation, building ladders up them and sometimes viewing platforms. But O.P Trees - or 'Baumbeobachter' as the Germans called them - were special.\n\nOn the British side, artists in the Royal Engineers were tasked with meticulously selecting a real tree on the battlefield by measuring and photographing it extensively.\n\nThe ideal tree was dead and often it was bomb blasted. The photographs and sketches were then sent to a workshop where artists constructed an artificial tree of hollow steel cylinders.\n\nIt contained an internal scaffolding for reinforcement, to allow a sniper or observer to ascend within the structure.\n\nThen, under the cover of night, the team cut down the authentic tree and dug a hole in the place of its roots, in which they placed the O.P. Tree. [Read more: Watson/DailyMail/6February2013]\n\nWhat and How Do U-2 Spy Plane Pilots Eat During Their 12 Hour Missions? Here's a fascinating look at what and how the USAF's finest pilots eat while flying America's favorite spy plane: the A-12. Second only to the A-12 Oxcart and its brother, the SR-71 BlackBird, being a A-12 pilot is an extremely physically demanding job, often requiring 12 hours of flying.\n\nWatch Ssgt. Suzzett Stalesky - an airspace physiologist and U-2 launch and recovery technician - explain how they eat their tube food, another American aerospace classic on itself. The video also includes some great sequences of the U-2 itself.\n\nAccording to Stalesky, most pilots eat about one tube per hour. They really have to watch out their food intake because they are not allowed to defecate in the suit. Their favorite tubed food: caffeinated chocolate pudding, which gives them a little kick while they are in the aircraft, and chicken a la king.\n\nOther foods include peaches, hash browns with bacon, cinnamon applesauce, and key lime pie. [Read more: Diaz/Gizmodo/7February2013]\n\nThe Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden... Is Screwed. The man who shot and killed Osama bin Laden sat in a wicker chair in my backyard, wondering how he was going to feed his wife and kids or pay for their medical care.\n\nIt was a mild spring day, April 2012, and our small group, including a few of his friends and family, was shielded from the sun by the patchwork shadows of maple trees. But the Shooter was sweating as he talked about his uncertain future, his plans to leave the Navy and SEAL Team 6.\n\nHe stood up several times with an apologetic gripe about the heat, leaving a perspiration stain on the seat-back cushion. He paced. I didn't know him well enough then to tell whether a glass of his favorite single malt, Lagavulin, was making him less or more edgy.\n\nWe would end up intimately familiar with each other's lives. We'd have dinners, lots of Scotch. He's played with my kids and my dogs and been a hilarious, engaging gentleman around my wife.\n\nIn my yard, the Shooter told his story about joining the Navy at nineteen, after a girl broke his heart. To escape, he almost by accident found himself in a Navy recruiter's office. \"He asked me what I was going to do with my life. I told him I wanted to be a sniper.\n\n\"He said, 'Hey, we have snipers.'\n\n\"I said, 'Seriously, dude. You do not have snipers in the Navy.' But he brought me into his office and it was a pretty sweet deal. I signed up on a whim.\"\n\n\"That's the reason Al Qaeda has been decimated,\" he joked, \"because she broke my fucking heart.\"\n\nI would come to know about the Shooter's hundreds of combat missions, his twelve long-term SEAL-team deployments, his thirty-plus kills of enemy combatants, often eyeball to eyeball. And we would talk for hours about the mission to get bin Laden and about how, over the celebrated corpse in front of them on a tarp in a hangar in Jalalabad, he had given the magazine from his rifle with all but three lethally spent bullets left in it to the female CIA analyst whose dogged intel work and intuition led the fighters into that night. [Read more: Bronstein/Esquire/11February2013]\n\nCIA Operatives, Barrels of Whiskey, and a Biker Named Thor. Grenades and women, yes. A briefcase stuffed with $54,000: definitely that. But under no circumstances had there been more than two ounces of cocaine.\n\nOn January 14 in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, he hunched his six-foot, four-inch wiry frame over the defendant's table and frowned so hard it looked painful. His thin lips and handlebar mustache pressed against the microphone. The ponytailed 68-year-old yelled, pounded the table, and yelled some more. It was 9:15 a.m. The judge rolled his eyes. And the blond stenographer couldn't keep pace with Thor's raving.\n\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Thor said, relinquishing his mouth's hold on the microphone. \"I guess I've just spent too many years in the recording business.\"\n\nThor - a Norwegian country singer, a former Outlaws motorcycle chieftain, and an \"ambassador at large\" to a rebel Haitian government - chuckled.\n\nThen he was at it again, machine-gunning fresh manifestos. No one could be trusted, he said. Liars and conspirators stalked the proceedings. And this pretrial court hearing - which concerned a lingering bond-jumping charge against him from 1981 - was about much more. \"We are at the tail end of a 30-year CIA conspiracy plot,\" Thor said.\n\nThor paused. Thor let this information sink in. [Read more: McCoy/MiamiNewTimes/14February2013]\n\nDeath of a Master Terrorist: How the 'Iranian Jackal' was Killed. On the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Imad Mughniyah, a.k.a. \"The Iranian Jackal,\" much new information about the hunt for the terrorist most wanted by Mossad and the FBI has emerged. It's a story of high-tech surveillance and old-fashioned espionage, and it's just starting to be truly told now.\n\nImad Mughniyah was 20 years old when he made his debut on the international terrorist scene in 1983, with a series of spectacular and deadly bombings aimed at Western forces in Lebanon. The 1983 Beirut suicide bombings included those on April 18 at the U.S. Embassy [63 killed]; on Oct. 23 at the U.S. Marine barracks [241 killed]; and on Oct. 23 at the French paratrooper barracks [58 killed]. A litany of bombings, hijackings, kidnappings and assassinations followed, with an ever-increasing body count. A list of the attacks he is believed to have been involved in, directly or in a leadership capacity, reads like an index of late-20th-century terrorism: Car bombings of the Israeli embassy and the Jewish cultural center in Argentina [124 killed] in the early 1990s; the World Trade Center bombing of 1993 [6 killed]; the Khobar Towers suicide bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996 [19 killed]; the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 [223 killed]; the 2000 suicide attack on the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen [17 killed].\n\nAnd perhaps even the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. The 9/11 Commission Report references \"a senior Hezbollah operative\" shepherding the future hijackers in and out of Iran. Some terrorism experts believe this was almost certainly Mughniyah. Indeed, according to Peter Lance's book Triple Cross, Osama bin Laden spoke admiringly of Mughniyah's lethal handiwork and in 1993 met with him in Khartoum, Sudan, to form a working alliance. That historic meeting, according to Lance, was brokered by Ali Mohamed, bin Laden's master spy and double agent inside the FBI. Kenneth R. Timmerman, in Countdown to Crisis, quotes Major General Amos Malka, a senior Israeli military intelligence official, saying that before Sept. 11, the Israelis had picked up on numerous signs that bin Laden and Mughniyah were planning new operations against Israel and the U.S. \"within the next few weeks.\"\n\nEven after the Sept. 11 attacks, Western intelligence agencies continued to track Mughniyah with interest.

For example, after Ron Paul tweeted some controversial words about ex-Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, Rand issued his own statement calling Kyle a \"hero.\"\n\nIn other ways, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\n\nFor example, in just a one-month span, Sen. Paul has - not once, but twice - advanced a conspiracy theory that says that during the Reagan era, the U.S. funded Osama bin Laden.\n\nDuring John Kerry's secretary of state confirmation hearing, Paul said \"We funded bin Laden\" - a statement that prompted Foreign Policy magazine's managing editor, Blake Hounshell, to fire off a tweet saying: \"Rand Paul tells a complete falsehood: 'We funded Bin Laden.' This man is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\"\n\nBut that didn't discourage Paul. During a much anticipated foreign policy speech at the Heritage Foundation today, Paul doubled down, saying: \"In the 1980's the war caucus in Congress armed bin Laden and the mujaheddin in their fight with the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe only problem is that this is, at best, highly speculative - and, at worst, the perpetuation of an outright myth.

The unauthorized disclosure last week of a Justice Department White Paper on the legality of targeted killing of senior al Qaida operatives who are Americans had the collateral effect of strengthening congressional oversight of intelligence.\n\nThe leak not only fulfilled a stalemated congressional effort to provide information to the public, but it also catalyzed the long-sought disclosure of classified documents to the intelligence committees themselves.\n\nAlthough the intelligence committees received the White Paper in June 2012, they proved powerless on their own to gain its broader public release, or to acquire their own copies of the underlying legal memoranda.\n\n\"I have been calling for the public release of the administrationï¿½s legal analysis on the use of lethal force - particularly against U.S. citizens - for more than a year,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee in a February 5 statement. \"That analysis is now public...\"\n\nIn other words, what the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee was unable to accomplish for over a year was achieved by a resourceful reporter [Michael Isikoff of NBC] along with a cooperative source. That is a peculiar fact that ought to prompt some soul-searching on the part of the Committee, which has been relentlessly critical of intelligence-related leaks.\n\nBut the disclosure did more than just make the White Paper available to the public and launch a substantial public debate on its contents. It also enhanced the ability of the intelligence committees themselves to gain access to additional classified records on which oversight depends.

You know that top secret drone base in Saudi Arabia everyone's been crowing about lately? If Wired's sources are correct, that's a picture of it above. Runways, hangar, sand - it's all there. It's not very secret, either.\n\nThe base is hard to find, sure. But there it is hiding in plain sight waiting for some well informed blogger to find on Bing. Noah Shachtman, who runs Wired's Danger Room blog, was that blogger, and on Thursday night, he described the finding. It's very difficult to confirm whether this is or it isn't America's secret Saudi drone base, first of all. \"But the base's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other American drone outposts,\" Shachtman explains. \"And its remote location - dozens of miles from the nearest highway, and farther still to the nearest town - suggests that this may be more than the average civilian airstrip.\"\n\nBeyond that, Shachtman earned tacit confirmation from two former American intelligence officers. \"I believe it's the facility that the U.S. uses to fly drones into Yemen,\" one of them told Shachtman. \"It's out in eastern Saudi Arabia, near Yemen and where the bad guys are supposed to hang out. It has those clamshell hangars, which we've seen before associated with U.S. drones.\" The other officer described the location as \"way, way out in the Rub al Khali, otherwise known as Hell.\" We did some exploring on Bing Maps, and sure enough, it's almost comically unfriendly to human life. Ripples of sand dunes stretch for hundreds of miles, and it's dozens if not hundreds of miles to the nearest sign of civilization. In other words, it's the perfect spot to hide a secret drone base.\n\nSomething seems wrong here, doesn't it? If America was so protective of its secret Saudi drone base - enough so that it managed to keep The New York Times and The Washington Post from publishing details about its location - wouldn't they double check the publicly available satellite imagery? They could at least blur it out a little bit, right?\n\nNope.

Hood, a retired senior officer in the Central Intelligence Agency and a writer, died at home in Amagansett early on the morning of Jan. 28. He would have turned 93 on April 19.\n\nDuring World War II, having just transferred from the Army into military intelligence, Mr. Hood volunteered for the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the C.I.A. He worked for a time on Ultra, a top-secret exploitation of coded German messages that the British and Americans had cracked and that the Germans thought was invulnerable, Enigma.\n\n\"Bill Hood was one of the heroes of O.S.S. and C.I.A., a major figure and leader in the clandestine services over three decades, a member of Allen Dulles's wartime team, and a successful and inspiring leader of operations in Central Europe and at headquarters,\" wrote Tom Polgar, a former colleague.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Hood remained in Europe, working for the agency in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, often as chief of station. He was one of three deputies of James Jesus Angleton, the head of counterintelligence at the agency. Before retiring in 1975 he was chief of operations for Latin America and had also worked in New York under cover at the United Nations.\n\nDescribed by Kennett Love in a review of one of his spy novels as a \"looming, powerfully built, agreeably sinister-looking veteran spook,\" Mr. Hood became an Amagansett fixture after marrying a former O.S.S. colleague, Mary Carr Thomas, in 1976, and could often be seen in shorts sitting on Main Street benches taking the sun.\n\nMr. Hood was married first to another O.S.S. colleague, Cordelia Dodson, but the marriage ended in divorce.\n\nAfter he retired, while he and his second wife were dividing their time among Portland, Me., New York, and Amagansett, Mr. Hood wrote \"Mole,\" a nonfiction story of a Soviet Army colonel who became a double agent.\n\nHe went on to write three spy novels, \"Spy Wednesday,\" \"The Sunday Spy,\" and \"Cry Spy,\" all of which were well received. His last book was \"A Look Over My Shoulder,\" a biography of Richard Helms, whom he had worked for when Helms was the director of the agency.\n\n\"William was an urbane and sharply intelligent observer with a wry, New England sense of humor,\" said Sheridan Sansegundo, a friend. \"He was a man of few words, but you could depend on those words being astute, perceptive, and dead on the money.\" [Read more: Carmichael/EastHamptonPatch/9February2013]\n\nResearch Requests:\n\n[IMPORTANT: AFIO does not \"vet\" or endorse these research inquiries or job offers.

The titles for some of these are in detail below and online.\n\nWednesdays, 6 - 27 February 2013 10 am - Washington, DC - \"Spy Seminar Series: Exfiltrations, Captures, or Kills: Famous High Stakes Intelligence Operations\" at the International Spy Museum\n\nIntelligence operations that hold human life in the balance are some of the most difficult missions any intelligence service will ever undertake. Exfiltrations are supremely delicate. This is the process of extracting a person or people from a targeted site with absolute urgency due to a sudden change which makes the site hostile. This could happen when a spy's cover is blown or a change in leadership puts people in danger. Captures are just that: snaring an enemy. And lastly kills. Wet jobs. Assassinations. When the enemy is bad enough that termination is the only answer. In this series, a distinguished group of experts and former intelligence personnel will introduce you to some of the greatest of these intense operations.\n\nFebruary 13 - How the Mossad Captured Eichmann\n\nFor 15 years the hunt for Eichmann, architect of the mass murder of Europe's Jews, stretched from war-ravaged Europe to the shores of Argentina. In researching his book, Hunting Eichmann, best-selling author Neal Bascomb gathered groundbreaking new information and interviews, and newly declassified documents to fully tell the story of how the notorious Nazi was brought to justice. He will reveal how the young Israeli spy agency, the Mossad, organized this colossal operation—dispatching operatives like Isser Harel and Zvi Aharoni on their harrowing mission to Argentina to capture and deliver Eichmann.\n\nFebruary 20 - Saving Ryszard Kuklinski\n\nIn 1972, Polish Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski volunteered to spy for the United States. His self-appointed mission: to undermine his country's Soviet-dominated leadership to save Poland from nuclear destruction. Over the next nine years of high-risk, clandestine exchanges, he copied tens of thousands of secret documents and covertly passed them to the CIA—including plans to crush the Solidarity movement. Learn the inside story of this extraordinary case and of Kuklinski's last-minute, daring escape from International Spy Museum Executive Director, Peter Earnest, a former CIA officer who did unprecedented research into Agency records for Benjamin Wesier's A Secret Life: The Polish Officer, His Covert Mission, and the Price He Paid to Save His Country. Former CIA officer, Sue Burggraf, who worked with Kuklinski in Warsaw will also comment on the heroic Pole.\n\nFebruary 27 - Canadian Caper\n\nInternational Spy Museum board member and former CIA chief of disguise Tony Mendez led the famous rescue of six Americans who were trapped in Iran after they had escaped from the US Embassy during the Iranian Hostage Crisis in 1979. Mendez came up with an ingenuous plan to get the Americans out by creating a fake movie called ARGO, setting up a cover film studio, and disguising them as a location scouting team from Canada. Mendez will take you behind the scenes of the operation, recently immortalized in the real film ARGO, from Canada's incredible support of the rescue to what kind of props he brought to make the Americans look more like film industry types.\n\nWHERE: International Spy Museum: 800 F Street, NW Washington, DC Gallery Place/Chinatown Metrorail Station\n\nTICKETS: Tickets: $120 (must be purchased through the Smithsonian)\n\nTo register: (via phone) 202.633.3030; (online) www.SmithsonianAssociates.org.

Peterson\" at the International Spy Museum\n\nUndercover at the US Embassy in Moscow in 1977, CIA officer Martha D. Peterson was one of the first female CIA case officers to serve there. Peterson discovered that she could move freely around Moscow without a trace of surveillance coverage, unlike her male CIA colleagues who were smothered by KGB surveillance teams. She became almost solely responsible for retrieving messages from a key spy in the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, code named TRIGON. She communicated for nearly 21 months with TRIGON through dead drops disguised as logs, dirty gloves, crushed milk cartons, and crumbly pieces of concrete. On the evening of July 15, shortly after Peterson placed a concrete concealment device filled with spy equipment in a tower on a railroad bridge, she suddenly found herself in the clutches of KGB agents. She was arrested and harshly interrogated. She refused to cooperate, held her ground, and ultimately was declared persona non grata and sent back to the US. Three KGB officers drove out to the airport to salute her plane in recognition of her composure during interrogation. Spend an evening with this heroic woman and learn what it was like to be caught and keep your cool! You will be one of only 14 guests at Adour for a four-course dinner and wine-pairing where you'll talk with her about her remarkable career and her thoughts on today's intelligence issues.\n\nPeterson is the author of The Widow Spy which is recommended for pre-event reading.\n\nLocation: Adour, 923 16th St NW, Washington, DC 20006\n\nTickets: $250.

Captain Milton 'Mary' Miles journeyed to China to set up weather stations and monitor the Chinese coastline—and to spy on the Japanese. After a handshake agreement with Chiang Kai-shek's spymaster, General Dai Li, the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO) was born. SACO consisted of nearly 3,000 American servicemen, 97,000 organized Chinese guerrillas, and 20,000 \"individualists,\" including pirates and lone-wolf saboteurs. This top-secret network worked hand in hand with the Nationalist Chinese to fight the Japanese invasion of China while erecting crucial weather stations, providing critical information to the US military, intercepting Japanese communications, blowing up enemy supply depots, laying mines, destroying bridges, and training Chinese peasants in guerrilla warfare. Join author Linda Kush as she reveals the story of one of the most successful—and little known— covert operation efforts of World War II.\n\nJoin the author for an informal chat and book signing.\n\nTickets: Free!

Many were inspired by real world figures or by the actions of real people who were really evil. What makes people move down a dark path? These experts can tell you exactly how Bond villains demonstrate classic criminal or otherwise aberrant psychological behavior based on their experiences with real offenders: Dr. David L. Charney,who was the psychiatrist for notorious spy Robert Hanssen and interviewed him extensively in prison; and Dr. Stanton Samenow, a noted forensic scientist and author of The Criminal Personality and Inside the Criminal Mind. Dr. Samenow was the prosecution's mental health witness regarding the younger DC sniper, Lee Boyd Malvo. Why would someone betray their country like Robert Hanssen or GoldenEye's Alec Trevelyan? How realistic is the Stockholm syndrome suffered by Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough? What makes people consider crime as a way of life? In this extraordinary conversation, you'll learn exactly how maudlin sentimentality—Blofeld's love for his cat—can coexist with chilling brutality.\n\nTickets: $20.

He comes from Beit Sahour, Palestine, a small city not far from Bethlehem. After exposure to the American view of events in Palestine, gathered largely from press reports, Amer sensed the need to present another view and to correct misconceptions. His presentation includes selected pictures and videos, and will touch on the culture and lifestyle of the people, history of Palestine, the political situation, and what he calls \"the wall of discrimination\" from his perspective.\n\nThe meeting, open to the public, will be held at the Brick Store Museum Progam Center, 2 Dane Street, Kennebunk. For information call 207-967-4298\n\n16 March 2013, 5 – 7 p.m. - Mission Viejo, CA - AFIO Orange County hosts Dick Holm, former CIA COS\n\nRichard L. Holm, author of \"The American Agent\" will address the chapter.\n\nBorn in the Midwest, Dick Holm joined the CIA in the early 1960s and rose rapidly in the ranks to become Chief of several stations, eventually receiving the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA's highest award.\n\nMr. Holm had an eventful and action packed career that spanned thirty five years. He was first assigned to Laos where he worked with the Hmong tribesman and led operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail during the early stages of the Vietnam War. He was then sent to the Congo where he suffered near fatal injuries in a plane crash in the far northeastern region of that country.
