The fifty-year-old Marshal had barely entered the beautiful, historic Tientsin Buddhist Temple when neatly dressed Sze Shee arose from her position of prayer to shoot the surprised War Lord. She then *Y1|I calmly surrendered herself to the police. Eye-witnesses I 1 1 believed that she could have escaped after the shoot- ing had she wanted to, for nearly everyone near the scene was running away in all directions, and the po- lice did not arrive until several minutes after the shooting. Sze Shee is the daughter of the late General Sze Chung-pin, said to have been executed a few years ago by order of the dead Marshal. General Sze Chung-pin was one of several northern generals who opposed the non-parliamentary tactics of the Marshal. Marshal Sun was once a powerful factor in the internal strife of China nearly a decade ago. A former Governor of Chekiang, he became Military Governor of Fukien and finally, War Lord of nearly all of the southern half of China. The only group that opposed him in the southern region at that time was the Kwangtung Government. These Cantonese rivals had no respect for a northern dictator and resisted all his overtures for consolidation. In 1926 he started a gigantic con- certed attack on Kwangtung, but this invasion came to an inglorious end when his subordinates deserted him. Retired from active military life, he is said to have amassed a huge fortune in the form of foreign stacks and bonds and gold certificates. Reports are current that he is very friendly to the Japanese and that they are depending on him to lead in an \"independent\" movement in northern China this coming Spring. Reports also stated that the real motive of the shooting was because of his pro-Japanese attitude, and that Sze Shee was chosen to do the shooting in order to prevent any Japanese complication. Friends of the Marshal denied these reports, stating that the Marshal had led a simple life of comparative poverty since retirement. By TSU PAN The City of Shanghai is again in a state of turmoil as Japanese troops rush into Chapei, native Chinese quarters, to seek revenge for an alleged murder of a Japanese marine by Chinese. The Mayor of Shanghai, General Wu Teh-chen, was warned that unless thorough investigation of the case yields satisfactory results, the Japanese authorities will take \"free action\". In answer to the protest, Gen- eral Tsai Chin Chun, Chief of the Bureau of Public Safety in Shanghai, assured the Japanese of his fullest cooperation in tracking down the assailant. The Japanese alleged that the killing was premedi- tated, based upon a report that large numbers of plain- clothed Chinese soldiers are concentrating in the Shanghai demilitarized zone lately. Neutral observers, however, tend to doubt the truth of such a statement. There has been no motive attributed to the Chinese government which would cause their murdering an ordinary Japanese marine. Furthermore, empty cart- ridges discovered near the scene of the murder proved to be of Japanese make. It is therefore believed by many that the murder was committed by a fellow coun- tryman of the dead man, and not by a Chinese. The incident resembles very much that of the Kuramoto case in 1934. Kuramoto was the vice consul of the Japanese consulate general in Nanking. His sudden' disappearance led the Japanese authorities to believe that he was killed by Chinese soldiers. Severe protests were lodged against the Nanking government, and guns from Japanese battleships on the Yangtze River were trained on the Chinese capital. When the exchange of diplomatic verbiage was brought to a close, Kuramoto was found alive in a stone cave in the Purple Mountain near Nanking. Domestic troubles had so de- ranged this Japanese diplomat's mentality that he had elected to seclude himself from world affairs by going into the mountains, perhaps to starve to death. Kindly Chinese farmers had cared for him meanwhile. The recent attempted assassination of Premier Wang Ching-wei and the announcement of a new mone- tary policy by the Nanking government have created (Continued on Page 2) Page 2 CHINESE DIGEST November 15, 1935 Japan CHAO-CHIN HUANG Chinese Consul General November 13, 1935. Mr. Thomas Chinn, The Chinese Digest, 868 Washington Street, San Francisco, California. Dear Mr. Chinn: I hasten to congratulate you upon the birth of your publication, the CHINESE DIGEST. It has long been felt that a publication in the English language by Chinese residents here will serve many use- ful purposes. It brings a better understanding among the Chinese and American people and it also serves as a means to fortify the knowledge of the Chinese younger generation with information about their mother country. Your pub- lication appears in good time, and I do not hesitate to endorse your pursuit. With best wishes, Very truly yours, C. C HUANG, CHAO-CHIN HUANG, Consul-General of China. CCH:L He who knows others is clever, but he who knows himself is enlightened. — Lao-Tzu. All indications are that Japan is being groomed to support another army inva- sion into China in the near future. The press is suppressed until the time is ripe. The Japanese are formula-minded and their method of procedure in the imper- ialism game seems to follow along this line: 1. Selection of a suitable time for in- vading China, when Europe and America are busy with other im- portant matters. 2. Charging China with mis- rule or insincerity, thereby stirring up anti-Japanese feeling in China. 3. Arranging a suitable pretext, such as the shooting or disappearance of a Japanese soldier in civilian garb. 4. Imposition of drastic demands on China, and the invasion of China whether or not these demands are fulfilled. 5. Creation of a neutral zone, follow- ed by independent movement and the setting up of puppet rule. International observers are of the opin- ion that Japan has progressed to the third step and is awaiting for the inevit- able invasion. The only two alternatives would be Chinas advanced kowtow or concerted action on the part of the rest of the world. Macao Base for China Clipper The China Clipper will not land in China proper exactly, but in one of China's former beauty spots, notorious Macao. This is not because the Chinese do not desire to have the Clipper land in Canton, but because hints from Japan are that if the Clipper is permitted to land in Canton, Japanese butterflies will hereafter have the right to land in any part of China they desire. • • CHINESE ALUMNI MEETS An informal luncheon was held last Friday at the Far East Cafe by a number of workers to hear Dr. Robert Sibley pro- pose the organizing of a Chinese Chapter for the California Alumni Association. Such a chapter will be of immense value to the Chinese students, said Mr. Sibley. A third of the membership fee will be re- turned to the chapter to aid in improv- ing the Chinese students' club house, or for other local needs. MAYOR ANGELO J. ROSSI San Francisco, California November, 14, 1935 Thomas Chinn, Editor, The CHINESE DIGEST, 868 Washington St., San Francisco, Calif. My Dear Mr. Chinn: Permit me to extend felicita- tions on the occasion of the issuance of the first number of the CHI- NESE DIGEST and wish for both it and you a long, prosperous and successful career. Sincerely, Angelo J. Rossi. NEW SHANGHAI CRISIS (Continued from Page 1 ) useasiness in Japanese political circles. While the world's attention is centered on African affairs, Japan has evidenriy thought it an opportune time to oring new pressure on China. A report from Tokyo stated that Vice-Admiral Hvnku- taka had ordered the gunboat At.ilc.i to proceed immediately to Shanghai to re- inforce the Japanese land forces already there. In the meantime, Chinese in large numbers have deserted the Chapei secton and rushed to the bordering Inter- national Settlement for safety. Good-will subdues its opposite, water fire. — Mencius. November 15, 1935 CHINESE DIGEST Page 3 FAR EAST Newshawk Attempts Life of Chinese Premier An attempt on the life of Wang Ching Wei, Premier of China, was un- successful as the would-be assassin fired three bullets into his body on Nov. 1. Three other government officials were wounded. A group of newshawks and camera- men were gathered in front of the Kuo- mintang Headquarters, Nanking, appar- ently waiting for news from the prelim- inary meeting of the Central Executive Committee which was then in session. Wang, unaware of his fate, emerged with many other important government officials from the front door of the headquarters after the session where Sun Feng Ming, a reporter for a local paper, Chen Kwong Pao, produced a pistol from his camera box and shot them. Three bullets took effect, on Wang, one in the cheek, one in the waist and one in the back. Tseng Chung Ming, vice-minister of railways, Kan Nai Kwong, vice-min- ister of the interior, and Chang Chi, vice president of the Judicial Yuan were standing close to Wang and were also wounded. Chang Hsueh Liang a Hero Chang Hsueh Liang, governor of the three eastern provinces at the time of the Japanese invasion, played a heroic part on that day. It was due to his alertness the would-be assassin was disarmed; he kicked the gun from his hand. Another conspirator approached Chang with a dagger but was knocked out by Chang's guard. The assassin and eleven suspects were arrested. Martial law was immediately declared in the metropolitan area. It was learned that the motive behind the plot was due to dissension against Wang's yielding attitude toward Japan. The bullets were removed from Wang's body in the Central Hospital in Nanking and it is reported that Wang's life is not in danger. • • SILVER TO GOVERNMENT Acting Premier and Finance Minister Dr. H. H. Kung demanded of all Chi- nese to turn in their silver to the gov- i ernment bank for paper money, thereby j controlling the white metal. This is necessitated by the Roosevelt administra- tion jacking up the price of silver in the belief that it will enable China to buy more from the United States. Not only did it have the opposite effect, but it re- sulted in greater hardship on the part of the Chinese. China Off Silver Standard By Tsu Pan A drastic monetary reform was insti- tuted by the National Government of China on November 3. A decree was issued whereby all silver in China is to be nationalized and the holders are required to change the metal for legal tender notes. The program includes the follow- ing four points: (1) nationalization of silver, (2) restriction of bank note issues to three government owned banks, (3) stabilizing the Chinese dollar at the present rate of exchange, and (4) legalizing payment of debts in terms of silver by bank notes. The three government owned banks mentioned are the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. During the last few months, the Central Bank of China has gradually bought out the bank note issues of several smaller banks intending to consolidate reserves, thus paving the way for monetary control. Stabilize Dollar For the purpose of stabilizing the Chinese dollar, the Chinese government banks have accumulated large sums of money in foreign financial centers and will buy and sell foreign exchanges in unlimited quantities. The nationalization of silver signifies the abandonment of the silver standard. The sudden announcement of the policy has commanded world-wide attention, both politically and financially. Well informed quarters explained the Chinese move as being precipitated by the American silver buying policy. Ever since the passage of the silver purchase act in the United States Senate in June, 1934, large quantities of silver flowed from China into the United States. As the drain of metal put a deflationary effect n China, the Chinese govern- ment sought prevention on October, 1934 by putting an embargo on the export of silver coin and bullion. Make Big Loan Of late, negotiations were started be- tween Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, repre- senting the British government and Dr. H. H. Kung, Chinese Minister of Finance, for the purpose of arranging a loan of 10,000,000, sterling, from Great Britain to China for political rehabilitation. While no official a- nnouncement was made regarding the result of negotiations, the Chinese government adopted the new monetary measure. In Japan, militarists and statesmen APPREHENSION OVER PRO-JAPANESE ATTITUDE The shooting of Premier Wang Ching- wei, China's handsome and radical minded politician, revealed deep seated apprehension over the pro-Japanese at- titude of the Kuomintang on the part of a large section of China. This group, somewhat voiceless, is of the opinion that the Shanghai industrialists and Pekin- Tientsin bankers, as well as Kuomintang officials, are desirous of having peace with Japan at all price, and that conces- sion after concession is being made to Japan's ever increasing thirst for slices of China. • • viewed the Chinese move with appre- hension. It was believed that China had borrowed funds from Great Britain, thus depriving Japan of a prior offer to render the Chinese government financial assistance. A meeting was held in the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where delegates from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Yokohama Specie Bank gathered to discuss the Chinese monetary sit- uation. It is reported that Japan may seek to intervene against possible new developments for \"the purpose of main- taining peace in the Far East\". In Washington, both the Treasury and the State Departments professed to be ignorant of Chinese plans and to have no information other than press reports. Whether New Dealers will again boost the price of silver is not known. Wheeler Quoted Senator Wheeler of Montana, accom- panying Vice-President Garner on the trip to the Philippines, was quoted as saying in Hongkong that there is no conflict between the U. S. silver buying policy and Chinese nationalization of silver. He fears, however, that the Chi- nese government may not be able to stabilize foreign exchange as planned, on account of the heavy fluctuations in the gold price of silver. T. V. Soong, \"wizard of finance\" from Harvard and Governor of the Central Bank of China, however, pre- dicted that the new monetary policy would be helpful. The four-point decree, he said, will increase public confidence, help business, stimulate the inflow of foreign capital and increase domestic prices. China's silver reserve, he added, provides more than 100 per cent cover- age of bank note issues, and the govern- ment banks are strong enough to sta- bilize exchange by open market oper- ations.

San Francisco will be within telephon- ic reach of any major city in China in the early part of next summer, according to an exclusive dispatch received by the Chinese Digest. The ministry of communications in China has obtained satisfactory results in experiments made with European and American radio stations by using a phone-transmitter through its Interna- tional Radio Station at Shanghai. Mr. Zee Loo, business manager of the International Radio Station at Shang- hai, has completed arrangements in the purchasing of necessary equipment from a London firm, and as soon as the in- stallation work is completed in the early part of next summer, the China-Ameri- can service will be open to the public. Messages from American cities are to be radioed to the main station in Shang- hai and then relayed to various cities in China by the trunk and local telephone lines. • • Wah Ying Club, 844 Clay Street, held a special meeting last month, and form- ally adopted a constitution.

The bazaar will be held for three evenings beginning November 14 and concluding on Saturday, Novem- ber 16. The Rev. George W. P. Johnson, C. S. P., director of the Center, has an- nounced that this forthcoming bazaar will be more picturesque in atmosphere and more ambitious in its scope than the one held last year. Last year, he said, only the auditorium was used, but this year the two spacious boys' and girls' clubrooms will be commandered into service in ad- dition to the auditorium. A place for dancing has also been arranged on the third floor, which houses the classrooms. The dance room will open into an open- air court and the entire space will be sumptuously decorated to give it a true Chinese setting, the director explained. Chinese Booths The booths will be located in the audi- torium and the clubrooms and in these all manner of fancy goods, rare objects, Chinese curios, novelties, food, tobacco, and sweets will be offered. \"There will be special booths for men, women, and children\", Father Johnson continued, \"and there will be games for young and old\". The booths will be fashioned in the manner of Chinese pagodas and artistical- ly decorated. The surroundings will also reflect the Chinese settings of the booths by the use of Chinese draperies, pictures, and other decorations. A Chinese Hope Chest, filled with hand-made lace work, linen, a silk com- forter and a blanket is being offered as a prize. The proceeds of the bazaar will be used to refurnish the clubrooms and for needed repairs in the Center. itilirH <-n he 1~M id the would \"-poll the name Hee Sam. SOCIAL NEEDS \"One of the greatest immediate social needs of Chinatown is a day nursery ade- quately equipped and staffed to take care of the community's pre-school children while their mothers are at work. A large proportion of these children are with their mothers in factories while they work, which is detrimental to their health, and a number of them are kept at homes and looked after by their older brothers or sisters. Facing such a situation a large day nursery is a necessity\". Dr. Johnson Speaks The discussion of this social need was voiced by the Rev. George Johnson, di- rector of the Catholic Chinese Social Center, familiarly known as the Chinese Mission, when he spoke before the entire Chinese staff of the State Relief Adminis- tration on November 4. Mrs. Genevieve Nichols, supervisor of District Six, where the Chinese relief staff has its offices, was also present. The occasion was the weekly meeting of the Chinese staff and the Rev. Father Johnson was invited to tell some- thing of the social welfare work of the Catholic Chinese Center. \"Chinatown's low percentage of crime is remarkable\", Father Johnson said, \"when considering the fact that normal family life and home environment among the young is still so scarce. Housing con- ditions are bad in the community — as most Chinese know — and this fact is re- sponsible for much juvenile delinquency. Good housing could be brought about through education and gradual change\" Father Johnson expressed his knowl- edge of the social needs of the commun- ity at the conclusion of the talk in which he described the religious, educational and social welfare functions and activities of the Center of which he has been di- rector since 1932. Although he has worked among the Chinese here for three years he showed thorough and under- standing knowledge of the Chinese and of the social set-up and the needs of the community. Schools Active In the course of his talk the director revealed that 425 pupils attend the Eng- lish school and 350 pupils go to the Ch-'nese classes which arc conducted in connection with the Center. A Social Service Bureau which made 15,000 oils last yeir and gave aid to Chinese totaling 45.000 esses was disclosed. A dental clinic and a cafctcrii where hot noon-dav lunches arc served consti- tute other imOOftant works.

Led by Dr. F. Y. Lee, the organization has grown to such a large extent that in less than two months, eighty-five charter members have been enrolled. The purpose of the Center is concen- trated on presenting an educational and social program for every member of the Chinese community of 4000. Another aim of the Center is toward the unsolved problems of the youth of the community. The Center hopes to equip the younger generation to face the problems of today.

Taam, former active church worker of San Francisco and recent graduate of the Pacific School of Re- ligion, was ordained on Sunday, Nov. 10, at the Chinese Congregational Church of Los Angeles at 734 E. Ninth Place. Rev. and Mrs. Taam, (the former Martha Leong, daughter of Rev. and Mrs. B. Y. Leong of the Congregational Church of San Francisco) with their young son, Martin, moved from Oak- land to Los Angeles, last August. • • FOR CHINESE AIR FORCE Harry H. Woo, graduate of a San Diego aviation school, sailed for China aboard the Dollar liner Coolidge, on November 1st. His final destination is Canton, where he hopes to serve with the government air forces. Headwork The fast thinking and quick action of a Chinese cook saved four lives when a fire broke out one early morning last week in his employer's residence at 2640 Baker St., San Francisco. Henry Wong, the Chinese cook, em- ployed in the home of Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Osborne, was aroused from his sleep by the smell of smoke. Trying to wake up his employers he found his path blocked by flames. He rushed back to his room, found some giant firecrackers, and set them off. The exploding fire- crackers woke up Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, who fled out of the house with their two children, James, 14, and Elizabeth, 16. The fire swept through another build- ing adjacent to the Osborne's home and routed three other families. Two fire- men were injured, and fire damage was estimated at #30,000. TREASURE HUNT Seventy boys were found combing the Salada Beach last Saturday with picks and shovels. They were not gold diggers. They were after \"tags\", and the one who recovered the most tags from the beach received as a prize, a practice telegraph set. The boys were members of Boy Scout Troop Three. They motored down the peninsula under the guidance of Silas Chinn, assisted by John Kan, Albert Young, and a score of older boys from Division C. It was one of their monthly outings. Every fourth meeting must be held out of doors, rain or shine. Last month, these same boys went to China Shrimp Camp for their outing, arriving just in time to help put out a dangerous gasoline fire in one of the launches. • • CHINESE GOLFER Thomas T.

He smiled and issued no denial when questioned if he intended to marry in China. CHINATOWN PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION ORGANIZED With an initial enrollment of one hundred members of the hoard of direct- ors of the Chinatown Progressive Asso- ciation met to devise plans for enlarging their membership. According to the presi- dent of the association, H. W. Key, prominent business leader, the aim of the association is to improve the economic foundation of the younger Chinese in America. This, in turn, has its begin- ning in improvement in local housing, sanitation, public education, and cultiva- tion of proper outlook. • • RACE IN THREE HEATS Canada may have its quintuplets, but China has its great heat. In a recent article in the newspapers, mention was made of a 43-year-old mother bearing triplets in Peiping. She was probably sore put for names. With typical Chinese ingenuity she named them for the three hottest periods of the year, Ta Fu (Great Heat;) Erh Fu (Second Heat); and San Fu (Thrd Heat).

The exhibition, sponsored by the Latham Foundation for the Promotion of Humane Education, was presented in the girls' clubroom of the Catholic Chinese Social Center, 902 Stockton Street. Periodically the Latham Foundation conducts a poster contest among school pupils as a means of educating young people to be kind to animals. Not long ago such a contest was conducted among the students of the Hangchow art school, located not far from Shanghai. The result evoked much admiration from adults who have viewed the posters. Most of the pictures represented a man, feeding, caressing, or aiding their dumb friends. A greater proportion of the posters were executed in western fashion but those that showed real talent were done with the ancient Chi- nese brush and were typically Chinese. Recently the Latham Foundation sponsored a poster contest in this city to encourage art talent as well as the pro- motion of humane education. Two students of St. Mary's Chinese School won honorable mention in the contest. Many Americans as well as Chinese viewed the posters during the exhibition, which lasted four days. • • WANTED Men who are willing to build a future for themselves. Apply to the Chinese Digest.

Chinatown is a bit of Old Cathay in a foreign setting. _ To some, Chinatown holds all the glamour, the mysticism, the exotic lure of the Far East. They who come will want to re- member Chinatown. They will want to BUY . . . Souvenirs, Art goods. Some reminder of CHINA- TOWN. Very few American tourists can read Chinese. Very few American tourists can't read English. The CHINESE DIGEST is printed in English. THEREFORE— You have something to sell to someone. Someone wants to buy that something you have to sell. The CHINESE DIGEST will be read by that somebody. LET THE CHINESE DIGEST SELL THAT SOMETHING TO THAT SOMEONE FOR YOU. THE CHINESE DIGEST.

Chan, who works for the Gumling Importers and Exporters, is a former athlete and was an outstanding football player of Commerce High a few years ago, playing end. • • DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS \"Young Chinatown\" buys over 90 percent of its clothes and over 85 percent of its furniture outside of Chinatown, in downtown San Francisco. \"Young Chinatown\" shops dis- criminatingly among the better ad- vertised stores. \"Young Chinatown\" is style- conscious. \"Young Chinatown\" is quality- conscious. \"Young Chinatown\" is price- conscious. \"Young Chinatown\" is ADVER- TISEMENT-CONSCIOUS. Although a bilingual people, the younger Chinese have a decided preference for the English lan- guage. They think in English. Their conversation for the great- er part is conducted in English. They may be reached only through an English - language paper. The Chinese Digest is an Eng- lish-language paper. The Chinese Digest is the only English - language paper in Am- erica. It is, in addition, a Chinese paper in that its contents are of interest mainly to the Chinese. It has the sponsorship of every Chinese club and every progressive Chinese organization. The Chinese Digest is designed to affect contact between the Chi- nese consumer who is interested in what the downtown stores have to sell, and the downtown stores which are interested in selling to the Chinese consumer. THE CHINESE DIGEST IS DESIGNED FOR YOU. . . . THE CHINESE DIGEST. CHAO-C H I N HUANG CHINESE CONSUL GENERAL AT SAN FRANCISCO A Biographical Sketch Cha Chin Huang Chao-Chin Huang was born in 1899 in Nan An District, Fukien Province, China. He received his college educa- tion at the Waseda University, Tokio, graduating in Political Economy in 1923. He then pursued post-graduate study at the University of Illinois, where he re- ceived his M.A. degree in Political Science in 1926. In January, 1928, Mr. Huan was ap- pointed a Section, Member of Overseas ConV6n€u in Nanking the communists in that province. He as- sumed office as the Chinese Consul-Gen- eral at San Francisco, California, on May 28, 1935. Mr. Huang is the author of several publications on \"Overseas Chinese De- velopment\", \"Formosa Under Japan's Control\", and \"Japan's Economic Crisis\". • • Central Executive Committee Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In June of the same year, Mr. Huang was appointed by the overseas bureau at Amoy as its representative while concurrently serving as secretary to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs in that city. In October, 1928, he was promoted to the post of Chief of Investigation Sec- tion in the overseas bureau of the Min- istry of Foreign Affairs. In 1929 Mr. Huang was appointed chief of the Planning Section of the Overseas Ccxmmission of the National Government, and was specially delegated to tour the Federated Malay States, Dutch East Indies, Indo-China, and Philippine Islands for the Welfare As- sociation for Chinese abroad. In 1930 Mr. Hunag was appointed to the Division for Asiatic Affairs for the Foreign Ministry. In 1931 he was made Acting Secretary of Ministry. In Jan- uary, 1932, Mr. Huang was chief of First Section of the Department for Asiatic Affairs. In April of the same year, Mr. Huang attended the National Emergency Conference at Loyang on be- half of His Excellency, Lo Wen-kan, minister of foreign affairs. Mr. Huang was chief of fourth section in the Department of Intelligence and Publicity at the time of his appointment to the post of Consul-General to San Francisco, California, on March 30, 1935. A few months before his depar- ture for San Francisco, Mr. Huang, as official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, personally conducted the International Journalists Group on an extensive tour of Kiangsi Province to make thorough observation and investi- gation of the destruction left behind by the Chinese communists, and the recon- struction set afoot by the Chinese Gov- ernment after its successful drive against The belated meeting of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of Kuomin- tang was convened in Nanking on November 1. Among the notables at the capital were General Feng Yu-hsiang, the \"Christian General\" and one time Commander of the Northwestern Revo- lutionary Army, General Yen Hsi-Shan, formerly Governor of Shansi Province, General Chiang Kai-Shek, the pillar of Kuomintang Party and other important members of the Central Executive Committee, for the purpose of mapping out national policies of both domestic and diplomatic affairs. General Tso Pin Reports General Chiang Tso-pin, China's Ambassador to Japan, had rushed to Nanking from Tokio to report on the recent political and diplomatic trends in Japan. Also, the Nanking Govern- ment had sent Tai Chi-tao, President of the Examination Yuan and Ma Chao- chun, mayor of Nanking, to exchange opinions with leaders of the South- eastern Provinces whose ideas regarding national affairs had hereto differed from that of Nanking. It is believed that any difficulties between Nanking and Canton will soon be straightened out. According to the constitution of the Kuomintang, the members of the Cen- tral Executive Committee are elected by the national congress of Kuomintang to conduct the business of the party. When the committee is not in plenary session, a standing committee is elected by mem- bers to handle the administrative affairs and to carry out the policies outlined by the session. The session of the Cen- tral Executive Committee was a most important meeting, one that determined grave matters in Chinese national policies.

CHINN, Editor Per year, ?2.00; Per copy 5c Not responsible for contributions unaccompanied by return postage STAFF CHING WAH LEE Associate Editor WILLIAM HOY Associate Editor FRED GEORGE WOO Sports CLARA CHAN Fashions ETHEL LUM Sociology ROBERT G. POON Circulation GEORGE CHOW Advertising Manager Why the Digest? \"•• The Chinese Digest is not just a hobby or a busi- ness— it is all that with a full-sized battle thrown in. We are fighting on five fronts. KILLING A CELESTIAL: There are no people in America more misunderstood than the Chinese. From the time of \"Sand-lot Kearny\" to the present, the Chinese is pictured as a sleepy Celestial enveloped in mists of opium fumes or a halo of Oriental phil- osophy, but never as a human being. The pulp maga- zines and Hollywood have served to keep this illusion alive. The \"Chinese Digest\" is fighting to kill this Celestial bogey and substitute a normal being who drives automobiles, shops for the latest gadgets, and speaks good English. THE TRUTH IS OUR BATTLE CRY: During the invasion of Manchuria, \"Made in Japan\" wires were filling the American dailies about \"bandits\", \"mis- rule\", and \"Asiatic Monroe Doctrine\". The Chinese here know better. They KNOW that the \"news\" is the result of skilful tampering by such paid propa- gandists as \"Ratty Rea\". Young China wanted to help and contributed its earnings freely. But alas, almost all the \"publicity\" at that time was printed in Chinese! Furious speeches were made — but almost all in China- town! The \"Chinese Digest\" is prepared to give the truth on the Far East, fearlessly and directly. We be- lieve that the truth is all that China needs — and the world wants. BRIDGING THE PACIFIC. Without Chinese heritage, Young China here is nothing. With it he is a representative of the oldest civilization on earth. Young China here wants to know more about Chinese a*-t and literature, history and philosophy. They believe they can best enrichen American life by contributing these cultural factors here. The old provincial idea about forgetting the best is gone. Enlightened Ameri- canism demands that we keep alive the culture of the old world. \"The Chinese Digest\" is determined to present the best in the way of classic Chinese art and culture. More than that, the \"Chinese Digest\" aims to stir up an intense interest in the Chinese language =»«d literature. We believe, with the late B. Laufer, that the lea*-\"'*^ of Chip-se language is easier than the '-amine of French or German. We enlist your aid ro ioin in the fleht to brine scientific teaching methods into the Chinese evening schools. Firetraps Must Co! There are about a dozen firetraps which should be removed from Chinatown forever. Sore spots to visitors, they are also danger spots to health-loving San Franciscans. Some of the larger of these firetraps house as many as five hundred beings, yet these same structures have but two exits. A few of these buildings have hallways about two feet in width. In case of fire, pity all but the few who are first to reach the hallways. There are buildings where the floors sag until they are no longer level. Needless to say, these are not Class A steel and concrete affairs, but \"rush jobs,\" com- pleted shortly after the fire of 1906. These buildings are a menace to health and happi- ness. Some of the rooms are without windows, others are without means of ventilation. Practically all of them are inadequately lighted. Some of the hallways are so dark a visitor cannot possibly find his way without lighting a match. Nearly all the rooms are small, and some are made still smaller by means of flimsy wooden partitions. These buildings, put up by outside landlords for the benefit of outsiders, are in the way. They occupy valuable spots in Chinatown, which can be better utilized for modern sunshine structures. Firetraps must go. INTER-TRENCH COMMUNICATION. Chinese in Boston or Portland have natural ties and common interests. Adverse legislation in one is adverse to all. Most of the smaller Chinatowns hardly number more than a hundred souls, and these kinsmen of ours live •n isolation and loneliness. They are anxious to know what is going on elsewhere Conventions of Chinese students or merchants have great sociological conse- quence, depending on the attendance, often resulting in changes of address or business, or even resulting in marriages. As fast as wire and telephone will permit us we are' establishing contacts all over America to serve our readers and make news available to all. THE WAR ON NEGLECT: Young China Needs Jobs. The progress of anv group of people depends primarily on its economic foundation. Give a racially sound people like the Chinese a fair sociological en- vironment and that is all that is needed to get along. At present Chinatowns everywhere are filled to the bursting point with well trained young men and women eager to find a chance to make their way in the world. These young people certainly deserve a chance for they are descendants of pioneers who reached Cali- fornia before ninety percent of the present population of California crossed the plains. They and their fore- fathers have contributed much to the buildine of the West. The \"Chinese Digest\" aims to give publicity to corporations and firms which employ Chinese. By intelligent shopping on the part of our readers we hope to create more openings for our young men and women. Yes, the \"Chinese Digest\" is fighting on five fronts. Clubs, lodges, and associations are joining us in the fray. We want to enlist you. November 15, 1935 CHINESE DIGEST Page 9 CULTURE -By CHING WAH LEE- Chinese Bronze Most historians are aware that the Chinese are a race of antique collectors and that they have been ardent connois- seurs since the beginning of ancient his- tory. Few are aware, however, that evi- dences are accumulating which show that they were collectors even in dim, neolithic times. Long before the end of the New Stone Age they were already preserving battle axes, daggers, and tools of flint, jade, and stone, as well as of pottery of a yet older period. The Stone Age was followed by the Bronze Age, and superior tools and wepons of bronze were soon replacing the stone implements. But these stone tools were not discarded. They were recently collected and raised to the position of ceremonial objects — which is to say that they were no longer treasured for their original functional value, but as objects of arts and antiques. Bronze at that time was the metal, and probably alongside with cowery shells, has the same value that gold has with us today. We see sur- vival of bronze as units of value in the pennies of the Republic. Bronze Not Discarded The coming of iron in turn replaced bronze with the hardier metal. But again the bronzes used by the earlier people were not discarded, but were raised to the position of ceremonial objects. Indeed, they were held in such high esteem that on one celebrated occasion the name of a whole province was changed with the dis- covery of a tri-pot in that region. De- feated states were made to yield their sacred bronzes to the victorious states as indemnities. We see a parallel to this in recent times when China, through the Versaille Treaty, asked of Germany to restore to her the bonze astronomical in- stuments stolen from the Peking Imperial Observatory during the Boxer Rebellion. Bronzes Classified Bronzes are classified by the Chinese as ancient, intermediate, and modern. Those of the San Tai Period (Hsia, Shang, and Chou Dynasty; 2205 B. C- 256 B.C.) or earlier, and those of the Chin Han Period (256 B.C-220 A.D.) are considered pure antiques. Those of the T'ang Dynasty (069 A.W.-906 A.D.) and those of the Sung Dynasty (906 A.D. •1205 A.D.) are considered as late repro- ductions, while those of the Ming Dynas- ty (1368 A.D. 1643 A.D.) and Ch'ing Dynasty (1644 A.D. 1796 A.D.) are mod- erns.\" Forgeries are known to have been made before the Christian Era, though they would pass muster by the most criti- cal connoisseurs today. In Japan they are producing clever imitations by shellack- ing finely ground patina to new metal. This may be detected by boiling or scraping. As may be expected the old bronzes are hoary with age. Those which have been handled with loving care by caress- ing hands for centuries after centuries have acquired a highly polished lustre which is beautiful beyond description. Those which were exhumed more recent- ly are rugged and often highly pitted. Both types display a pleasing patina ranging from an unearthly turquoise blue to malachite green (which the Chi- nese call kuo p'i lu, or melon rind green) with passages of apple brown or mottling of powdery emerald blue. These colora- tions depend to a great extent on the tex- ture, age, and composition of the bronze as well as on the condition of burial and subsequent handling. A few have inlays of black pigment or of silver and gold, but besides its form and surface decora- tion the chief attractions may be said to be its \"tarnishes\". Erroneously Termed iBronzes are collectively termed \"ting lu\" (tri-pots and vessels), \"chung ting\" (bells and tri-pots) or \"chien shih\" (metal and stones), the latter term being applied chiefly to bronzes and stones hav- ing archaic inscriptions. Sometimes they are erroneously called Hsuan Lu (vessels of the Hsuan Te Period because superior wares were made during the reign of the Emperor Hsuan Te, but as this worthy reigned during the Ming Dynasty, be- tween 1426 A.D. and 1435 A.D., this term had best be reserved for Ming Dynasty reproductions and incense urns. Many objects were fashioned of bronze during the early periods, from stoves to yoke bells, and from basins to daggers. But there are scores of ceremonial ob- jects which are regarded as classics. Like the loving cups of today they vary in size from those a few inches tall to monsters weighing nearly a thousand pounds. A list of these objects would include the following: Bronze Classics Listed 1. The Ting is a sturdily built cauld- ron having three legs and two handles for removing the cooker from the fire. 2. The Li is similar to the Ting ex- cept that the three legs are hollow and communicate with the body of the vessel. 3. The Hsien is a \"double boiler\" com- posed of a li surmounded by a tight fit- ting or hinged pot, the bottom of which may be perforated, although sometime the two are made in one piece. 4. The Tu is a covered bucket with swinging or chained bale, and having a cover and a bulbous elliptical body. 5. The Lei is the same as the above ex- cept that it has no handle and is round and squat. 6. The Hu is a round-bellied jar gen- erally with a cover. 7. The tsun is a cylinder-like beaker with concave side, and spreading mouth and bell shaped foot. 8. The ku is a taller and more slender form of tsun. 9. The Yi is a wide mouthed cup with from two to four handles, and has a hol- low base. 10. The tui is similar to the Yi, but is larger and more elaborate, and was used for serving of fruit rather than a cup. The tui of the Huai egion has three legs and a cover, often surrounded by three birds or animals in the round. 11. The Yi is a \"gravy boat\" shaped cup with an animal form for body and having four short legs. 12. The chiao is a three-legged cup with a band circulating the body, and having a small side handle issuing from the head of an ox or a t'ao T'ieh, and having two top knots. 13. The chio or chueh is a chiao hav- ing thinner walls and a prolonged curl- ing lip, balanced on the opposite side with a prolonged protuberance. 14. The fu is an oblong trough with four legs to hold sacramental cereals. 15. The tou is a round \"egg cup,\" hav- ing a domed lid, and with high spreading base. 16. The Ho is a pot with spout, han- dle, and a lid, which is generally chained to the body, generally with three legs. 17. The tun is similar to the tou, but is larger, squatter, and has a short base. Bronzes Still Found Bronzes are still being uncovered in China, a magnificent set of eleven pieces being exhumed as late as 1901. Marvel- lous Shang bronzes were recovered last year. Bronzes are making their way to Japan, Europe, and America, gracing the museums and homes of millionaires. Whether in the East or in the West they command fabulous prices, some of the better pieces having an evaluation of from $500,000 to $100,000 each. Originally these classic vessels were used for the storage, preparation and serving of food or wine, but during the San Tai period they were already raised to the position of ceremonial objects- (Continued to Page 15) L Page 10 CHINESE DICEST November 15, 1935 TEA AN D LANTERNS CATHAY INITIATION A parade through the streets of Chinatown followed by a dinner for its members marked the initiation cere- monies of the Cathay Club on Oct.31. Among those initiated were Goodman Choy, Edmund Jann, Winston Wong, Thomas Horn, Frank Chung, Henry Wong, George Gum, Robert W. Jung and Fred Lee. The entertainment committee arrang- ing the affair consisted of Andrew Sue, Wah Yee, William Lo and Norman Chinn. The parade started at the club rooms, 837 Stockton Street, and ended at the Far East Cafe where dinner was served. • • On Oct. 26, the Congregational Young Peoples Group, with Mrs. Thomas Chinn as president and Thomas Leong, secretary-treasurer, held its mon- thly social gathering at the new home of Mrs. and Mrs. Ira C. Lee. A most delectable roast pork enchilada was served by Miss Alice P. Fong. • • Y. W. C A.

Approximately 175 persons attended. Dr. F. Y. Lee spoke on the necessity of close cooperation in the Chinese communities, and stressed the impor- tance of the moral support of women and the formation in the near future of a women's auxiliary of the Chinese Center. Dr. J. J. Lee gave a resume of the his- tory of the Oakland Chinese Center, while Dr. C. G. Lee thanked all present for their support. The outstanding laugh of the evening was provided by Henry Lum. With his rendition of Chinese songs, the youthful Mr. Lum \"rolled them in the aisles\". Mrs. Pardee Lowe, wife of the former track star, rendered several piano solos and gave her interpretation of Chinese folk songs. Harry Dong also sang two musical selections. Rounding out the evening in fine style, motion pictures were shown, bridge and Mah Jong were played, and refreshments served. • • ARTISTS GIVE BANQUET A banquet was held by the officers of the Chinese Art Association last Wed- nesday to greet their American artist friends and advisors, as well as to plan for a coming exhibit in one of the large museums of San Francisco. This exhibit will display oil paintings, pen and ink sketches, etchings, sculptures, and carv- ings. The exhibit will be supplemented by a large collection of historic Chinese art objects and antiques. • • HALLOWE'EN SOCIAL A Hallowe'en social was given by the Juniors of the Court Our Lady of China (Chinese branch of the Catholic Daugh- ters of America) on fhe evening of Nov. 1, and was attended by more than twenty of the members. The social was held in the girls' clubroom at the Catholic Chi- nese Center. Games were played under the direction of Mrs. Wm. Stafford, a senior member of the Court, which pro- voked much fun and hilarity. Over twenty members of the various boys' clubs in the Center wrre guests at this social. Refreshments were served. Hallowe'en Social In preparation for the Business and Industrial Girls' Mid-winter Conference to be held in Sacramento early next year, the Nine Six Five Club entertained at a benefit Hallowe'en Card Party at the Chinese Y. W. C. A. on Tuesday even- ing, October 29. The Hallowe'en motif was carried out in decorations and refreshments. In charge of arrangements were Miss Delma Mark, the president of the club, Mrs. Ella Chan, and Miss May Louie. • • PENTHOUSE PARTY A Penthouse Party was given by the Chinese Tennis Association last Sunday, November 10, at the Hotel Cecil Pent- house, 545 Post Street. The party lasted from 12 noon to 6 P. M. ,wth 65 mem- bers of the \"Chitena\" attending. Miss Josephine Chang acted as host- ess, and did so admirably, as the success of it proved. Mah Jong, whist, tin gow and bridge games were played. Dancing was also enjoyed by all present. The bridge tournament was won by Hayne Hall and Martin Lau, and were awarded prizes donated by the Jing Loy Co. and Hall's Sport Shop. The raffle was won by Willie Gee. Tea and refreshments were served. Afterward many members continued the party at the Far East Cafe at dinner. • • BARN DANCE Delta Phi Sigma, Chinese fraternity at the University of California,, has a barn dance scheduled for Thanksgiving Eve, November 27, at the Native Sons' Audi- torium. The dance will be given in rustic setting of the conventional har- vest time.

I refer to International Night, Oct- ober 15, when a Chinese Fashion Show was produced on the temporary stage in Portsmouth Square. The famous old Square was the setting for a four night's gala reproduction of scenes and enter- tainment reminiscent of early days in the Bay City, at which tens of thousands from all Northern California gathered. The streets about the Square were jammed with humanity. All traffic was detoured and street cars were held up or re-routed, so dense was the crowd of spectators.

Chinese Mannequins To the music of a modern dance band playing in the cadence of the Orient the Chinese mannequins made their appear- ance, each attired in the lovely colors and combinations of colors that have, since the beginning of time, distin- guished Chinese women's apparel as dignified, modest, and beautiful. There were gowns from many periods, from the dynastic down to the smart, fetching creations of today. Like a figure from the old dynastic period, Mrs. Earl Louie modelled a ceremonial robe for the bride of old Cathay. Her white satin blouse, reaching almost to her knee, was worn over an accordian pleated skirt of blue brocade. The skirt, like the blouse, was straight and full in cut, so typical of clothes worn in China a century back. An interesting feature of this skirt is the hand tucked pleats, each pleat tacked in place by hid- den stitches. Extended from the sleeves were deep bands of multi-color em- broidery to cover the hands of the modest bride. A pompomed headdress, resembling an elaborate tiara, demurely covered the forehead. Bridal Costume Another bridal costume in subdued hues of red and green, was worn by Miss Virginia Wong. To add to the his- toric picture of her ensemble, Miss Wong wore a pair of Chinese wedding slippers. These slippers are made much like embroidered slippers we see in the shops of Chinatown, but for the ex- ception of a block of wood placed at the very center of each sole. The wearer bal- ancng precariously upon each step she took, offered not a clumsy, but a quaint and charming picture. Chinese fashions, unlike Occidental fashions, change slowly. In the first years of the new Republic, the change was de- finitely towards simplicity. Lines became more fitted, sleeves shorter, and heavy embroidered trimmings were used less. Trousers took place of skirts, and became popular among the young and soph- isticated. Mrs. Thomas Chinn's ensemble of trousers and fitted short blouse, was of Chinese red satin. The blouse, made like a vest, had white satin sleeves of elbow length and quite wide. The begin- ning of the popular demand for sequins was indicated in this ensemble which had a gold sequin band of two inches in width as trimming.

To Screen Good Earth The sensational story of Wang Lung emeiging from his status of a starving farmer to that of an affluent Mandarin will be screened by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer Studio, according to a dispatch from Hollywood. The prize novel by Pearl Buck has been scenarioed into a Thalberg pro- duction and is expected to be released in March, 1936. The cast will include Paul Muni, the sensation of \"Scar Face\" as Wang Lung, and Louise Rainier, a new star hailed from Vienna, as his mate. The director is Victor Flemming. It is learned that the M.-G.-M. Studio has previously spent over a million doll- ars in China in photographing the actual scenes in China. Due to the objections from the public- ity department of the Central Kuomin- tang headquarters in Nanking, the pro- duction of the picture has been delayed. At present the publicity department has appointed General T. H. Tu to go to Hollywood to supervise the making of the picture so that nothing derogatory to China will appear in the picture. EDUCATIONAL FILMS The Chinese Y. M. C. A. has been con- ducting an Educational Motion Picture Program continuously since the latter part of 1933. To start with, the pictures were shown only once a week, but the at- tendance became so large that it was nec- essary to have two classes, one for adults and one for children. Later, even this became inadequate to serve the large num- bers: therefore two evenings were set aside, Thursday and Friday, from 8 to 9 p. m. for children, 9 to 10 for adults. The average attendance is 1200 per week. For special pictures or programs, or for sound pictures, the attendance reaches 2000 for the four performances. Science, travel, health, disease preven- tion, industrial progress, current events, comedies and special pictures for China (news, war, drama) are the subjects shown. Last week pictures of the leading football teams of this year were shown. This program meets a definite educa- tional and recreational need, and serves the Chinese people in a useful way. The continued attendance is an indication of the widespread interest. At first the men who attended were mostly unemployed old men, but now business men, men of all ages, girls, and women are interested. You Haven't Seen CHINATOWN Unless You've Been to THE MANDARIN THEATRE The Only CHINESE OPERA IN AMERICA TEN - TWENTY - ONE GRANT AVENUE San Francisco \"HERE WE ARE, MAE\" We read where Mae West has been unable to secure the services of Chinese musicians who play real Chinese instru- ments, for her new picture, \"Klondike Lou\", and was forced to hire twelve unique Chinese who were able to do some- thing with the \"pay-pa\" and \"yut-kum\". Perhaps she does not know that there is a Nam Chung Musical Society in San Francisco. These men were recently in San Diego for California Day and they may be termed genuine Chinese music- ians. They also played for the Century of Commerce fete. • • WHEELER HALL (Berkeley) \"Night Over Taos.\" A play about the early invasion of New Mexico by Americans. Something you will re- member. PINE STREET PLAYERS \"Monkey House.\" Dealing with artists along the east fringe of China- town. This will be amusing to those Chinese who \"go slumming\" there occasionally. SCREEN REVIEW WARFIELD \"In Old Kentucky,\" starring Will Rogers. The story of a humorous philosophic horse trainer of the Old South; worth seeing, bring children. PARAMOUNT \"O'Shaugnessy's Boy,\" with Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper. Lots of fun, but leave the adults at some night club before going. UNITED ARTIST \"Red Salute,\" with Barbara Stan- wyck and Robert Young. Dashing love along the Mexican border. No chance to yawn in this crazy story. GOLDEN GATE \"It's In The Air,\" with Jack Benny and Una Merkel. A screen presenta- tion of a musical comedy. ST. FRANCIS \"Dr. Socrates,\" starring Paul Muni. Medical students will like this heroic fight. ORPHEUM \"Remember Last Night,\" with Edward Arnold. If you like murder, go by all means. FOX \"Ship Cafe\" and \"Wanderer of the Wasteland.\" Idea for those who read 10 cent magazines. GEARY \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" Max Reinhardt's version of Shake- speare's musical comedy; novel treat- ment and judicious alteration. Very entertaining. • • STAGE REVIEW CURRAN \"Bitter Sweet.\" One of a few good operetas that crossed the plains. Worth hearing. COLUMBIA \"Common Flesh.\" Rather common, but the meat is well done. Ideal for the tired business executives. PRESIDENT \"The Gossipy Sex.\" For the sippy and the gossipy, this play will prove amusing. OPERA HOUSE \"Operatunities.\" You mingle with the stars after the show, or at least you drink ' a cup of tea. November 15, 1935 CHINESE DIGEST Page 13 SPORTS Cage Tossers By Fred George Woo Endeavoring to revive enthusiasm for bas- ketball among the young Chinese, Wah Ying Club is sponsoring its first annual Bay Re- gion Chinese Basketball Championship Tournament to commence in December, on a round-robin basis. Formerly a most popular sport, basketball has been on the wane during recent years, due partly to the depression. \"A major tournament, fairly conducted, will restore intense interest in this branch of sport,\" declared James Jung, chairman of the Wah Ying Athletic Committee. Invitations have been sent out by Daniel Yee, general chairman, to various local, Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, San Mateo, Palo Alto, and other Bay Region Chinese clubs to participate. Competition will be stiff, accord- ing to Andrew Sue, president of Wah Ying. Several other officials ventured an opinion that this tournament will be an outstanding sport event of the Chinese. Silver Trophy The sponsor is donating a large silver three-year perpetual trophy for the winning team, as well as gold medals to its players. Silver medals will be awarded to members of the runner-up team. At the close of league play, all-star teams will be selected, with those named receiving ribbons in recogni- tion of their outstanding play. All league contests will be played at the ! French Court, 625 Pine Street, San Fran- cisco. The opening game is slated for Sunday afternoon, December 15. Entries will close November 15.

WAKU REORGANIZING Reports from across the bay have it that the Waku Club is reorganizing a basketball team this year to enter the Wah Ying Cage League. We hear that it will be a powerful team, to consist of several veteran performers and a few up-and-coming youngsters. CHINESE GIRL TENNIS STAR One of the tennis sensations on the English courts this year was Gem Hoaking, a fifteen-year old Chinese girl. £uled too young to compete for the Junior Wimbledon championships re- :ently in London, she was given an impire's post in the title matches as a :onsolation. ROUGH HOUSE TACTICS Chi-Fornian Club's basketball team has, so far this season, engaged in two games. In their opener, they invaded the lair of the San Francisco Boy Club hoopsters. With four minutes to play in the last quarter, the tilt was declared \"no con- test\" by the referee, when the home team, according to the official, resorted to foot- ball and wrestling tactics. Half-time score favored the Chinese, 17-8. Last week the Chi-Fornians lost to the Evening High School of Commerce un- limiteds by a tally of 60-47, at the Com- merce gym. However, the Chi-Fornian players hope to improve their team and defensive work by the time the Chinese League comes along. Following is a list of the players on the squad: Herbert Louie, Athletic manager; Victor Wong, Richard Wong, Jack Lee, Ted Lee, James Hall, Fred Woo, Jack Look, and Francis Mark. Sport Shorts Frank Chin, a Chinese boy who resides in Salinas and attends the Union High School there, is a good football player. It is unfortunate, for Frank at least, that Salinas turns out championship teams year after year. Frank would have been a shining star on most any other prep team. • • Speaking of Salinas, do you know that Edward \"Lefty\" Chan lives there? Ed, a few years ago, was one of the best Chinese pitchers in baseball and who played on the Francisco and Poly nines. • • We hear that the Chinese All-High Basketball League may start their season sometime late in November. Teams from Poly, Commerce, Lowell, Mission, and Galileo will comprise the league. It is rumored that S. F. J. C and S. F. State desire to join in the prep league also. • • Earl Wong, who plavs on the Chinese Scout Varsity Basketball Team, also plays on the Univerrity of California freshman five. Earl is a forward. • • Jack Look, who starred for the San Rafael High basketball and tennis varsit- ies a few years ago, has a swell nickname. For some unknown reason, friends call him \"Runt\". Arthur Hee's Shangtai basketball team will again have for its players this coming season Charlie Hing, of All-City fame from Polytechnic High School, and Gerald Leong, former Commerce Varsity forward. Joe Chew, an ex- Sequoia High star, will be manager. • • There is an unconfirmed story that Albert Quong Lee, former gridiron stal- wart and man-about-town these days, stood at a street corner on a chilly night for two hours, waiting for his lady fair to show up. P. S. She did not. • • One of the most promising basket- ball players among the youngsters is Henry Kan, who plays forward on the Troop Three Scout team, coached by Don Lee, former Commerce star. Hank is following in the footsteps of his brother, Bill, who was an outstanding point-getter a few years ago. • • Most people do not know that a Chi- nese boy plays on the San Francisco State football eleven. Scan the roster and you will come across the name of Ed Yee, alternate regular end. Although not an Ail-American candidate by any means, he is, nevertheless, a valuable man on the squad. Ed hails from an East Bay high school. Rumors have been afloat for some time that an attempt is being made to organ- ize a Chinese football team this year. So far, nothing definite has been reported. • • A \"touch tackle\" football league, with several games already played, was organized by the Chinese Playground, according to Oliver Chang, director. Games are played on Sundays, under the supervision of Fred Mar. • • REFEREES SELECTED Two popular referees have been se- lected to officiate at all contests of the Wah Ying Bay Region Chinese Basket- ball Championship Tournament. They are Leland Stanford and Al Deasy, according to an announcement by Gen- eral Manager Daniel Yee. A statement was also issued that special official basketball programs will be printed and distributed free through- out the season as souvenirs. The spon- sors w'sh to call all clubs' attention to the fact that entries for the league close on Friday, November 15. m i rt Page 14 CHINESE DIGEST November 15, 1935 BOOKS By William Hoy My Country and My People by Lin Yutang. 382 p. illus. New York, Reynal & Hitchcock. A John Day Book. Price: #3.00. Self-criticism is a virtue which few racial groups in this hectic race-conscious world ever practice. In a country with an immemorable and glorious civiliza- tion and culture such as China self- criticism is doubly difficult, and the rea- son is not far to seek. China's civiliza- tion is old and it has taken her many centuries to reach her present state of unhappy senility; but she still lives, and in that very fact is to be discovered the reason for her stubborn pride and in- ability for self -criticism.— to acknow- ledge not only her past greatness but, what is most important for her continued existence as a nation, to know and face her present weaknesses, faults, and rea- sons for her backwardness. China Alone Survives In the course of her long civilization China has witnessed the rise and dissolu- tions of nations within her hearing dis- tance. She alone has survived, and be- cause she is still living she has assumed that she has discovered the right rules of living and conduct, for how else could she have existed so long? Ergo, there is nothing wrong with her and self-criti- cism was needless. Apply this same mea- suring stick to individuals, Chinese or otherwise, and the result would be the same. For obvious reasons the ability to grasp and to interpret the virtues and the faults of one's people, not using psychological, analytical methods, but the simple formula of \"human values\", is also difficult to achieve. When one has combined this quality with the ability to \"search inwardly and examine one's wisdom\", in the words of Mencius, one has achieved a feat not without signifi- cance to posterity. Pearl Buck's Opinion Such an intellectual quality is present in Dr. Lin Yu-tang, whose book Pearl S. Buck describes in her Foreward as„_. \"truthful and not ashamed of the truth: it is written proudly and humorously and wirh beauty, seriously and with gaiety, appreciative and understanding of both old and new. It is, I think, the most profound, the most complete, the most important book yet written about China\". Any one who has read the Rev. Arthur Smith's \"Chinese Characteristics\", writ- ten at the end of the last century, will, after perusal of Dr. Lin's work, appre- ciate the true quality of the latter's book. In the former, an American missionary attempted to analyse in the light of Christian ethics and what little psychol- ogical formula which was then in exist- ence, the moral, intellectual, physical and political genius of the Chinese. The result was a greatly exaggerated work of character exposition. Moreover, the book's literary quality was conspicouous for its dryness and on the whole showed the writer's appalling ignorance of Chi- nese culture. H. L. Mencken of China In Dr. Lin's work, however, we have the product of a man whose scholarship and intellectual progressiveness, both in foreign countries as well as in his native land, is unquestioned. He is known as one of the country's two ablest critics _ an H. L. Mencken of China. He is liter- ary, humorous, philosophical, at times cynical, but always interesting. When he choses to write in English he is a thoro- going journalist. \"My Country and My People\" con- sists of nine chapters, a Prologue and an Epilogue, and is divided into two parts. Chapter I describes the people as a race and its cultural solidity. He defines the differences existing between the southern and northern peoples in their physique, temperament and habits; the inter-mix- ture of the various tribes; the cultural and ethnological significance of the cycles of peace and wars stretching over a period of two thousand years. Whereas the active physical qualities of the race were prevented from degenerating by the periodic infusion of new blood from the North, China's cultural stability was primarily the outcome of the absence of established classes. Chinese Character Discussed Chapter II discusses the Chinese character, and here Dr. Lin's philo- sophical humor and cynicism comes into play. He lists fifteen Chinese character- istics and proceeds to examine their vir- tues and their faults. Among the people's good characteristics he put down sanity, simplicity, love of nature, fecundity, industry, frugality, love of family life, humor, conservatism, and sensuality. Among the other characteristics which he considered more as vices than virtues are patience, indifference, old roguery, pacifism, and contentment. All these traits of character he grouped into one word: mellowness, which is a quality of mind possible only to an old nation and which means \"the supremecy of the mind over emotions, and an overwhelming assurance that the human mind, through jo pue jjas s^auo .jo SurpuEjsjapun sji one's fellowmen, is able to adjust itself to the most unfavorable circumstances and triumph over them\". The Chinese Mind The next chapter deals with the Chi- nese mind and here the author defends the Chinese people's lack of science and their curious system of logic, or rather lack of it. Most writers on China, whether native or foreign, never cease to throw brick-bats at the Chinese people's lack of an analytical mind. Dr. Lin says, however, that \"the Chinese mind de- lights only in moral platitudes\", and that \"the scientific method, besides being analytical, always involves an amount of stupid drudgery, while the Chinese be- lieve in flashes of common sense and insight. No Chinese could possibly be stupid enough to write a dissertation on ice-cream, and after a series of careful observations, announce the staggering conclusion that the prrimary functions of sugar in the manufacture of ice-cream is to sweeten it; or that, in \"A study of the bacterial content of cotton under- shirts, the number of bacteria tends to increase with the length of time gar- ments are worn.\" China's Womanhood The chapter following discusses Ideals of Lifeand embraced Chinese humanism, Confucius' Doctrine of the Golden Mean, Taoism, and Buddhism. Here again the author's flashes of humor enliven an otherwise serious topic-humor which is part and parcel of the writer's philosophy and not just an attempt to be facetious. Part two is given over to the examin- ation of China's womanhood, its social and political life, its literature and its artistic life and, finally, the Chinese way of living. The longest chapter of part two is devoted deservedly to literature. In this and the following chapter on the artistic life the author shows his pro- found understanding, and not merely an accumulated knowledge, of Chinese cul- ture. This portion of the book is all too short. It is in the chapters on China's social and political life and in the epilogue that Dr. Lin applies the searchlight of self-criticism in an effort to understand the country's present state of chaos by examining the country's past history and culture, searching for a possible cause. The cause of China's present chaos he found to be a Female Triad called Face, Fate, and Favor. China has alwavs been governed by a system of morals, but thil 1 (Continued to Page 15) November 15, 1935 CHINESE DICEST Page 15 SAMPAN AND CARAVAN Fashions (Continued from Page 11) Trend Toward Long Dress The long dress was first adopted by fashion leaders in Shanghai, the Paris of China. The change in the beginning was restrained and simple in cut. Several beautiful creations of this period re- ceived the hearty plaudits of the crowd. Miss Elaine Chinn's gown of deep blue satin embroidered with fine silver cord in large Chrysanthemum patterns, was worn with a pair of pink satin trousers embroidered in gold cord in the same floral pattern. Miss Helen Jow's stunning white satin trimmed with silver sequins and Miss Mae Chinn's blue gown studded with large, loose red sequins, were two out- standing models of the early \"long gown\" period. From the high collar to the ankle-tipped hem, these dresses were unbroken in line, hence the appropiate term \"long gown\". Semi-fitted, with modest slits on the sides, and with sleeves in width of five to six inches, elbow length, this style of long dresses re- mained popular for many years. Cut More Daring Today, the leading dress makers in Shanghai and HongKong have retained the long gown mode. The cut, however, has become more daring, and the silhou- ette with a Western caption - \"stream- line\". High slits reach to the knee, in some, above the knee. Extremely form fitting, these gowns are most becoming to the slenderness of the Chinese women. Collars, traditional in Chinese dresses of all ages, are three or four inches in height. Sleeves, undergoing an astound- ing change, have given way from the wide flowing type to the very short nar- row ones. Also, the ingenious treatment of old embroidery on new fabrics, and the use of sequins of the loose type are to be noted. Miss Constance King featured a gown of the modern period in red satin with daring high slits. Miss Helen Fong's crepe gown, lovely with its embroidered yoke and collar, was of the new Renaissance green. The em- broidery of the old Mandarin work was was repeated as trimming on the hem and the two side slits. Miss Lorraine Chinn's white satin wrap with large gold sequin leaves loosely studded, proved an intertsing ver- sion of the American evening wraps. It retained the high collar, but cut knee length, opened in front instead of the usual side fastening of Chinese clothes. Casual in line, long sleeves, brilliant with Chinese Silk Trade Booms Chinese export of silk showed a marked increase during recent months as a result of the Italy-Ethiopia imbroglio. The fear of a blockade of the Mediter- ranean sea route has diverted buyers of silk materials toward the Far East. Italian silk and rayon have been formi- dable competitors with Chinese silk, and now war time economy and transport- ation difficulties have curtailed Italian supply and helped to increase Chinese export. According to statistics compiled by the ministry of finance in China, silk at the present occupies only an unimport- ant place among the commodities of export from China. It was formerly the most important item in the export list but has long been relegated to an insignificant place on account of foreign competition. With the African situation at its height, Chinese silk export is ex- pected to boom for a while. loose sequins, the wrap is adaptabe for both American and Chinese fashion. Chinese Stage Beauty Miss Li Ta Ming, popular singer at the Club Cairo, wore the only stage crea- tion. Although her gown was modern, of white crepe with large rose pattern em- broidery, her short wrap was of the Chinese stage. Intricate in cut and de- sign, with a profusion of silver as well as silk thread and even fur embroidery, the dramatic effect was heightened by arti- ficial Chinese flowers worn in the air. To the strains of \"Chinese Lullaby\" and \"Chinatown,\" sung by the golden voiced Miss Li, the splendid display of dazzling gowns ended all too soon. Chinese Bronze (Continued from Page 9) libation and offering of sacramental food. Newer bronzes were made at that time and these have acquired functions: celebration of victories, expression of penitence and prayer, awards for merito- rious service, confirmation of appoint- ment, birthday memorials, insignia of kingly authority, etc. Have Few Equals As to artistry and technique, Herrlee Glessner Creel claimed that they have had few equals and no superior, in all the world before or since their own days. \"The casting of these bronzes, in the Books (Continued from Page 14) system can no longer accomplish its pur- poses; in fact, it never did. \"The plain, inexorable political and historical truth is that when you treat officials like gentlemen, as we have been doing in China, one-tenth of them will be gentle- men and nine-tenths of them will be crooks. What China needs is neither benevolence, nor righteousness, nor honor, but simple justice, or the courage to shoot those officials who are neither benevolent, righteous, nor honorable\". A harsh attitude, to be sure, and the words were possibly written when the author was in a pessimistic and cynical mood, but, nevertheless, there is pro- found truth in this dictum. Envisions a Savior And the author closes his book with a sense of frustration but yet not of hope- lessness. He envisions a Savior, a Great Executioner who, brandishing the sword of Justice, will do away with the govern- ment by morals and substitutes a gov- ernment by justice. From whence will come that Savior he does not profess to know. Lin Yutang is editor of the Analects Fortnightly (Chinese) of Shanghai and contributing editor to the China Critic (English) of the same city. He is a grad- uate of Harvard and Leipzig universities. Two of the chapters in his book appeared not long ago in the pages of Harper's and Asia. With several excep- tions the rest of the book were re-written from articles which appeared several years ago in the China Critic. • • most difficult and intricate forms, causes connoisseurs to gasp; for the most ex- pert craftsmen living today cannot bet- ter it with all the resources of modern science at their command\", Mr. Creel has said. In comparison with the much vaunted work of the Renaissance craftsmen another expert said, \"These Shang tings make the casting of Benvenuto Cellini look like child's play\". Many books were written by the Chi- nese on this subject, some dating back to ancient times. \"Hsi Ch'ing Ku Chien\" (Mirror of Imperial Antiques) in 42 volumes in Chien Lung's time is very scholarly, as is also \"T'ao Chai Chi Chin Lu\" (Records of T'ao Chai Bronzes) b\" Viceroy Tuan Fang whose pen name is T'ao Chai. Western writers are repre- sented by John C. Ferguson, \"Outlines of Chinese Art\" and Dagney Carter, \"China Magnificent\".

No. 2 NOVEMBER 22, 1935 Cents flJM NORTH CHINA IN DANGER! By Tsu Pan Japan is sharpening her knife to slice off another portion of territory from China this week. Information from Japanese sources reveal that between November 20 and 23, a new government will be set up in North China based on the principle of Sino-Japanese co-oper- ation and independent of the Nanking government. The new government will include the provinces of Hopei, Shantung, Shansi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, with a population of approximately 95,000,000, and a territory as large as one-third of the size of the United States. The state is to be called \"Huapeh Lianshen Tzuchih Chengchuan\" or \"The North China United Provinces Autonomous Regime.\" Chinese Generals Involved General Sung Chehyuan, commander of garrisons of the Tientsin-Pieping area is to be made the chair- man of the autonomous council. Japanese advisors are to be appointed to every political post, as in the puppet state \"Manchukuo.\" Other Chinese military leaders involved in the plan are said to include General Shan Chen, governor of Hopei; General Han Fu Chu, gov- ernor of Shantung; General Hsiao Chenying, governor of Chahar; Ching Teshuen, mayor of Peiping; Chen Ke, mayor of Tientsin, and Ying Yuken, commissioner of political affairs in the North China demilitarized zone. Japan Planned Early The Japanese authorities admitted that the plan was approved by Japanese military leaders in a con- ference held in Tokio immediately after the autumn military maneuvers on the Island of Kyushu. In case China should offer any resistance to this movement, the Japanese Kwangtung Army and troops from \"Man- chukuo\" will take drastic action, it is reported. Five divisions of troops will be sent in to Hopei and six divisions into Shantung. North China will then, the Japanese threatened, be formally annexed to Man- chukuo\" and the puppet emperor will be planted on the ancient throne in Peiping. Eight trains of Japanese troops have already arrived at Shanhaikuan, strategic gateway of the Great Wall, and more are pouring down from Manchuria. Means of communication along the Peiping-Liaoning railway were carefully guarded by Japanese soldiers. Military tanks, armored cars, trench mortars, and am- munition piled up at Shanhaikuan railway station. Ten thousand Japanese were concentrated at Chinchow as reserves. A Japanese cruiser also appeared at Taku Bar. General Chiang-Kai-shek Busy In Nanking, General Chiang Kai-shek is equally occupied in the movement of his troops, according to a Tokio report. He had mobilized 300,000 soldiers in Shantung and Honan to watch the activities of Gen- eral Han Fu Chu. Another group of his crack troops were said to be concentrating at Hsuchow. Reports indicate that General Chiang had also moved his troops from Kiangsi, Hupeh, Hunan and Kweichow to North China. Twenty divisions were stationed near the Yellow River regions. It is generally believed that a show- down will occur in the next few days. Attempt to Force China's Hand It is not difficult to see that the Japanese scheme had long been planned. Shortly after the military leaders conferred in Tokio regarding the China situa- tion, a member of the Japanese Chief of Staff and a member of the Japanese foreign office were sent to China to convene Japanese military and diplomatic officers at Dairen, Tientsin and Shanghai. At the Dairen conference, which many of the important Jap- anese officers of the Kwangtung Army attended, it was decided that China should be pressed to set up North China as a special area for Sino-Japanese co- operation, that China would be called on to suppress all anti-Japanese activities, and that if China should fail to do so, an independent North China state would be established. Nanking was accused of using a \"double-faced\" policy toward Japan. It professed, the Japanese charged, to co-operate with Japan and at the same time anti-Japanese activities were allowed to be carried on among the people. Chinese Generals Deny Ying Yuken is the first one who openly voiced the \"independent movement.\" In a recent circular tele- gram to the military leaders in North China, Ying pleaded the establishment of the new regime. Cham- bers of commerce and bankers' associations in North China were also reported to be in support of the plan. (Continued to Page 2) t^ Page 2 CHINESE DIGEST November 22, 1935 Foils Assassin WANG CHING WEI Wang Ching Wei, premier of China whose life was attempted Nov. 1 in front of the Kuomintang headquarters in Nanking, is improving, according to late dispatches from China. A native of Chekiang, Wang Ching Wei was born in Canton, Kwangtung, in 1885. At the early age of 16, he became in- terested in political science and sociology. Leaving his native land for Japan he entered the Tokyo Law College and graduated. While in Tokyo he joined Tung Ming Hui. His ability as a leader resulted in his being elected chairman of the executive council. At the same time he was editor of Ming Pao, Tung Ming Hui's organ, which was advocating \"a Republic for China\". He participated in several uprisings of the revolutionary forces in Kwangtung and Kwangsi. He attempted to assisi- nate the Prince Regent, father of Em- peror Hsuan Tung. Failing in this at- tempt, Wang was arrested and condemned to life imprisonment, but the outbreak of the 1911 Revolution brought about his release. After the establishment of the Repub- lic he went to France for further studies. At various times he was southern dele- gate to the internal peace conference at Shanghai, 1911; president of the Kwang- tung Provincial Educational Association, 1920; member of southern government No Inflation in China By Tsu Pan China is not going on a paper stan- dard nor is she planning to inflate her currency, according to a late dispatch released by the local Chinese Consulate General by order of the Ministry of For- eign Affairs, Nanking, China. The chief purpose of the recent mone- tary decree is to prevent the flight of capital and to consolidate silver reserves in China, the dispatch continued. Begin- ning November 4, the bank notes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be the only legal tender used. Other bank note issues will be redeemed in a short time. All debts contracted in terms of silver dollars shall be paid accordingly with legal tender notes. Holders of silver coins and bullion must voluntarily hand them to the government in exchange for currency. A severe penalty will be in- flicted for illegal hoarding. To Safeguard Silver Information from other sources re- veals that a Bureau of Reserves has been established in Tientsin, Peiping, Han- kow and Canton for the purpose of col- lecting and safeguarding silver stocks. A responsible spokesman from the Na- tional Government is quoted as saying that there is no foundation in a recent rumor that financial groups in North China objected to the government plan. He also denied that China had con- tracted a loan from the British Govern- ment. • • DAVIS CUP STAR ENTERS TULANE Guy Cheng, a member of China's 1935 tennis team, registered recently at Tulane University as a special student in arts and sciences. at Canton, 1921; and high advisor to Dr. Sun Yat Sen in 1924. After staying in Europe for a year, Wang returned to China in 1927 to as- sume the chairmanship of the Central Executive Council of the Kuomintang, of which committee he had been a mem- ber since 1924. At the present time he is president of the executive yuan, premier of the cab- inet, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. An exceedingly handsome man and of an occasional radical frame of mind, he readily attracted the youth of Chna in the political merry-go-round. NORTH CHINA IN DANGER (Continued from Page 1) While General Han Fu Chu was in daily conference with General Tada, commander of the Japanese array in North China, he denied knowledge of the movement. He further issued orders to suppress such rumors in his province. General Sung Chehyuan also reported ignorance of the whole affair to the Nanking officials. To many local observ- ers, it sounds incredible that Sung could be involved in the scheme, as he was at one time the most outstanding anti-Jap- anese militarist in North China. His famous \"big sword\" army fought many frivolous battles with the Japanese, and he was only lately ousted from his post as the governor of Chahar because of his anti-Japanese attitude. The proposed Japanese invasion of North China caused considerable concern in Washington. It meant the rapidly closing up of the open door in China, which the United States government has endeavored to keep open since the end of the last century. In case open hos- tilities should start, the Japanese actions would once again violate the stipulations of the Nine Powers Treaty of 1922, and the Kellogg-Briand anti-war pact. As both of these treaties were initiated by the United States, she would be incumbent to find means to justify her position as the sponsor of the treaties, and as a de- fender of world peace, experts point out. Furthermore, the recent enactment of the neutrality law has made it manda- tory that the president should embargo trade with warring nations. Should this be carried out, the United States would lose a tremendous amount of business in the Orient. At Geneva, statesmen faced a similar dilemma. Just as delegates of 52 nations began to bear down on Italy for the Ethopian invasion the Sino-Japanese con- flict appeared on the horizon. In case of war, China is bound to invoke the League covenants and world opinion, it is believed, will force the League to take action. The League has already been blamed for its stand in the Japanese invasion in Manchuria four years ago. Would the League impose a stronger sanc- tion against Japan? If so, can it pre- vent Japan from carrying out its alleged long premeditated plans to take North China? These are questions which the world will ask in the near future. • • A son was born on November 6 to the wife of Mr. James C. Hoang, 750 Grant Avenue, Sin Francisco, Calif November 22, 1935 CHINESE DIGEST Page 3 FAR EAST What Price Freedom For the Philippines? A political event took place in the Far East last week the importance of which was overshadowed and almost totally ob- scured by more important events in Ethiopia and North China. The event was the induction into office, on November 15, of Manuel Quezon as first president of the Philippines, signal- izing the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth. The United States flag still flies over the 7,083 islands which comprise the domain of the Filipinos, but for the first time in its history a native Filipino president will occupy the seat of government in the Spanish-built Malac- anan Palace, from wheh place 14,000,000 subjects will be governed. This partial fulfilment of Philippine independence is the life-long ambition of the tenacious and energetic 57-year-old soldier, lawyer, and politician, Manuel Quezon, who, for more than 20 years, waged a life and death fight in his native land and in Washington for the freedom of his people. His ambition for com- plete independence for the Philippines will be realized when on July 4, 1946, the islands will become a full fledged autonomous state. Effect Remains to Be Seen How the Far Eastern political scene will be affected by this new Philippine regime remains to be seen. Some astute politi- cal observers, impressed by Japan's pres- ent course of empire building, feared that eventually the Philippines will go the way of China's Manchuria, when United States political and military support is withdrawn ten years hence. Although Japan, through her official spokesman, has time and again within the last ten years stated that she has no designs on her southern neighbor, these same ob- servers point to the fact that Japan made similar promises to respect the territorial integrity of China, and yet at this very moment she is preparing an \"independ- ent\" North China state which will, in all likelihood decimate five more provinces from China. It is also pointed out that in recent years Japanese immigration to the Philip- pines has been on the increase, that they have been colonizing on the various islands, have built rubber plantations, constructed factories, established trade centers, and that Japanese made goods have flooded the Philippine market, to hte detriment of American trade. Whatever the real intention of imper- ialistic Japan, Quezon has already made appropriate military precautions, for he does not intend that the islands will be- come an Asiatic Balkans in 1946. On his last trip to Washington President Quezon negotiated for the services of the then U. S. Army Chief of Staff* General Douglas MacArthur, and offered him the job of evolving a formidable defense system for the islands. Last September, General MacArthur left for Manila as the Commonwealth's Military Adviser. What Will Status Be? For China the new regime in the Phil- ippines brought forth these questions: What will be the status and treatment ac- corded the 45,000 Chinese in the islands under Quezon? Will they be given the same freedom they now enjoy, or will their activities, chiefly economic, be sev- erely restricted? In the past, under Spanish rule, periodic persecutions and massacre of Chinese traders were conducted both as a matter of political necessity as well as attempting to stop them from carrying so much wealth of the islands into their own country. Both the Spaniards and the natives hated and feared the Chinese because of their commercial astuteness. Yet they were conscious of the fact that without Chinese trade and industry the Philippines could not exist. In 1571 Spaniards and Chinese met for the first time, but the Chinese had traded with the Philippines a thous"
