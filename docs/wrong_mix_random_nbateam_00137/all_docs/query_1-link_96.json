        "text": "There was a time in Yakima, specifically in the '90s, when it seemed like Goo Goo Cluster was just as local as Snickers or Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. They always had them in the candy aisle and always had them on that impulse 'are you sure you don't need some extra sugar for the road' racks at the check stand, themselves. They even had Goo Goo Cluster ice cream in the ice cream section which was wonderful as it had those delectable ribbons of caramel and nougat and all that made Goo Goo Clusters amazing.\n\nThen, at some time for some reason, it vanished.\n\nLike, I didn't even notice they were gone until I was thinking about them several years ago and realized I hadn't seen them on the shelves as much as I used to. And, after looking, I realized I didn't see them at all. Not even the ice cream that used to be a favorite. Weird. maybe they lost the partnership or something, I'm not sure, but Safeway was all about it and then it wasn't without fanfare or Internet petitions or anything.\n\nThat's when I found myself at a store called World Market in Spokane.\n\nWorld Market is a wonderful store that has several items from around the world. There's an Italian aisle that has pasta and goods from Italy, a UK aisle that has treats and canned goods and more from the United Kingdom, you get the idea. Well, I'm standing at the check stand and notice the familiar logo from across the way. Upon closer inspection, sure enough, there they were. As if I willed them back into existence just for me. I bought a few.\n\nThey're not exactly as I remember as these seemed a little more full (the ones I remember from Safeway were a little flatter) but they're still fantastic and if you missed these as much as I did you'll at least find them at World Market in Spokane. They have a World Market store in the Seattle area, too, but I've never been to that one.\n\nThese treats are a product from Nashville, TN so if you find yourself in the south you may see them more often but would be nice to see them back in the Northwest more often.\n\nMORE TO READ:\n\nHow to Pronounce These Commonly Mispronounced WA OR CA City Names\n\nLicense Tabs in Oregon Cost Too Much\n\nMORE: See 30 toys that every '90s kid wanted\n\nKEEP READING: Check out these totally awesome '80s toys\n\nLOOK: 25 fascinating vintage photos of the first Winter Olympic Games\n\nThe first-ever Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, showcasing a variety of sports and athletes.
