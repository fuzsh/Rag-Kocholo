        "text": "CPL. PERR DESIGNS\n\nPOST-WAR AUTO\n\nAIR SERVICE COMMAND BASE, INDIA - Why Cpl. Sherman Perr was missing from the after-duty social scene for so long finally came to light. He appeared one sundown from his tent, cradling as gently as a basket of eggs in his arms something to startle the G.I. world more than the \"Bill of Rights.\"\n\nPerr had designed the post-war car to suit not only G.I. ideals, but also their dreams.\n\nThe miniature model, carved of white brass, was resting on a highly-polished panel of hard fir and the gleam in the corporal's eye was not the reflection from the glistening metal.\n\n\"This is it, my fine feathered friends,\" said Perr as the boys gathered around and began to pump him with questions.\n\nSlip-streamed all the way, one of the boys looked at it and said, \"At what speed does it take off?\" Its nose projected beyond the radiator and resembled a feathered prop. The rear tapered off in corrugated effect, simulating the appearance of a high-speed bird crouched for the take-off.\n\nPerr paled into a serious mood. A student of industrial designing who had studied at Pratt Institute and was now serving as a draftsman for the ASC Air Engineer, his interest in the welfare of the soldier's post-war life was not to be taken lightly.\n\n\"It is my contention, \" said he, \"that a car should be designed as practicable as an airplane. This car would have retractable running boards, fog and headlamps in one sealed dust-free unit, shock struts instead of a coil spring, semi-domed body top with folding steel roof...\"\n\nThe corporal was raving by now, like a father talking of a new-born son. His spiel was set to outlast a 39-inch record, but there was a bit of a ho-hum beginning to register in his audience.\n\nHe tried a few more details, \"... it will have a speed up to 120 miles an hour, travel 35 miles on a gallon...\"\n\nBut his audience began to dissolve like an aspirin in water. One remarked, \"Perr, do you take it in the arm or inhale it?\"\n\nAnd fading off in the conversation of his departing pals, the corporal caught the unkindest cut of all, \"Well, the guy can dream, can't he?\""
