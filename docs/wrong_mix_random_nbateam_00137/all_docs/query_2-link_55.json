        "text": "‘Peacing Out’ in Negril\n\nDuring my February 2024 trip to Negril I was reminded of an old acquaintance and a long afternoon conversation I hadn’t thought about for many years …\n\nAs far as I can determine the last remaining American Vietnam War Veteran living in Negril has finally died. My source** couldn’t remember exactly how or when but assured me that his passing had been duly noted. Roger -aka – ‘The Birdman’ was a beloved, by the few that knew him, local fixture who lived in his own little isolated world in a small, personalized shed-like structure in the back-yard of a nondescript house on a quiet street across from the Negril Yacht Club. He shared his basic accommodations with several parrots who had also arrived unheralded in Jamaica from other lands. He may have smoked an inordinate amount of ganja and drank an unhealthy amount of lower priced, lower quality local rum but his unobtrusive lifestyle caused no one any problems or inconvenience. His backyard was pecking ground for a scrawny flock of chickens and a couple of local dogs. Roger was a well-read, well-educated gentleman who quietly chose not to discuss politics of any genre or period which probably helps to explain how and why he lasted/survived in Jamaica for the many decades that he did.\n\nI had the good fortune to have met Roger because he was a friend of Jeff Kaiser my longtime Canadian travel partner who I had shared Jamaican experiences with for almost twenty years. Roger and Jeff had become close friends because of their shared patronage of the somewhat rowdy but always entertaining and hospitable bar at the Negril Yacht Club. The NYC, built originally in 1971 was owned for many years by Chuck B. another multipurposed American Vietnam War Veteran who truly knew how to run a boisterous ‘expat’ bar which also attracted a motley collection of interesting locals of equally questionable background and purpose. The curiously named edifice did not have the feel or look or cliental of the typical Caribbean yacht club – it did not cater to the upscale yachting set or even the come and go turnover tourist trade … it didn’t have anything resembling a wharf, pier or dock? … I never once saw any type of watercraft anywhere near the place – not even a local fishing boat. This was a locals’ bar where everyone seemed to know who everyone else in the place was or were not at all shy about finding out who the new face belonged to. There was an extensive patio area fronting the ocean but the prevailing winds from the north were not conducive to outdoor gatherings .. the waves broke hard and heavy along, and frequently over, the seawall confining virtually all activities to the large inside bar. I got to know Chuck well enough that he would let me buy him a beer while he was providing me with tasty bits of the local gossip. His sudden unexpected departure from Jamaica resulted from a poorly timed trip he made to Miami to pick up items for his thriving Negril based business ventures … a disgruntled former wife notified American officials, who wanted to discuss some tax evasion problems and several court issued arrest warrants for non-payment of alimony and child support, of his pending arrival. Chuck never returned to Jamaica – he was otherwise detained.\n\nThe remaining American Vietnam War veterans would now range from the age of slightly over sixty to slightly under one hundred. I am approaching the midway point of that spectrum and if I had not been a Canadian I would have been a perfect candidate, willing or otherwise, to have been sent to serve in one of America’s messiest misadventures. Living less than one hundred miles from the USA border my generation was very conscious of that debacle as it ran its unfortunate course and I have known many American Vietnam Veterans and draft-dodgers whose lives were indelibly affected. A Canadian born neighbour who I went to public and high school with enthusiastically volunteered for the USA Marine Corp and did two front line tours of duty in the swamps and jungle of far away Asia and was never the same person again … upon his return home he had, understandably, very little in common with us frivolous non-participants after what he had seen and done. But it wasn’t from contacts I had in Canada or the United States where I garnered the most insight from conversations with Vietnam Vets … it was at the bar at Alfred’s Ocean Palace in Negril, Jamaica.\n\nOn any afternoon in February or March the long wooden bar and surrounding tables in Alfred’s would be overflowing with American, Canadian and Jamaican fun seekers and sunseekers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the average age of the gathered would be somewhere between 30-50 … a boisterous healthy crowd in the prime of life. It was on such an afternoon that I met Barry Landon of Tifton Georgia who would forever be my most memorable source of firsthand information about how miserable the situation was for the hundred’s of thousands of young American males who spent time at the front during the peak 1965 to 1971 period. (there were 536,000 Americans deployed to Vietnam at its peak in 1968).\n\nAs was my habit when making ‘Jamaica Today’ advertising sales calls in Negril during the late 80s and early 90s I would take along both my Negril area sales manager Joan Danvers and my main Montego Bay sales lady Pauline Scott. That way we could call on our thirty plus Negril area clients for renewals and collections as well as pick up new clients all in about two days … it was great for business and fun for everyone involved including our clients and their guests and patrons. Pauline and Joan attracted a lot of positive attention wherever they went from both men and women of all colours, sizes and ages. And so it was that during an end of the day stop in at Alfred’s Pauline and Joan attracted the attention of a tall good looking forty-year-old well tanned white American lawyer from Georgia. By the time I joined the conversation the three of them had already decided that dinner and a few drinks was how that late afternoon should be moved along into evening. Although Barry may well have hoped for a more intimate conclusion to the evening he was excellent company and took his gentle rebuff with good humour and grace. Joan and Pauline were always interesting, entertaining and engaging but neither needed nor wanted any short term dalliances. As we parted later that evening Pauline headed back to Montego Bay, Joan back home to Green Island, Barry to his condo somewhere across the street while I managed to make my way down the beach to my unit at Fire Fly where I was staying. It had been another productive and pleasurable day doing business in Jamaica.\n\nThe following day was a Saturday and I was planning on a long slow walk on the beach, perhaps a swim, a little lunch and then a leisurely drive into Kingston where I had appointments starting bright and early Monday morning. When lunch time arrived I decided that since Alfred’s was close by I would grab something there before packing up and hitting the road. I had just started to eat when Barry Landon arrived at my table and asked if he could join me. He looked a little rough but that certainly didn’t stop me from welcoming him to pull up a chair. He almost immediately started into asking about what it would take for him to get started in some sort/any sort of business in Jamaica … he had seen what I was doing and how much fun it appeared to be so he wanted to find out what was involved. I had been approached on many occasions by both American and Canadian men and women who had assumed that doing business on Jamaica’s northcoast was fun and easy and possibly something that they would love to get involved with … first impressions can be so deceiving!! I would routinely go through the specific set of unlikely circumstances that led to my present situation that accentuated luck and fortuitous timing as opposed to careful planning and business acumen. My story was similar to so many of the other American and Canadian business owners/operators that I had encountered in Jamaica. We all had arrived somewhat accidently and knew, based on observation, that long-term success was the exception rather than the norm … the real challenge was knowing when and how to get out without giving back everything that had been gained. I also cautioned that of the few longtime success stories I was aware of most of them involved women and that many of the men had barely survived financially before departing and several , including in Negril, had not survived at all … first impressions can be so deceiving!!\n\nIt was when I asked him why a lawyer from Atlanta Georgia would want to go into business in Jamaica that his story started to unfold: In 1968 there were 568,000 American troops in Vietnam and a nineteen-year-old Barry Landon was one of them. Despite a supposed advantage in troop numbers and a definite advantage in military equipment the American troops fighting in the swamps and jungles were already starting to realize that they could never defeat an enemy that had such a home field advantage. The politics of that war are still much debated but the young men watching their friends and comrades dying or being permanently maimed thousands of miles from home were doomed forever – it was an indescribable horror that could not be forgotten or explained. The returning survivors were broken … according to Veterans Administration report a total of 94,497 committed suicide between 1974 and 2014. There have been countless movies, books and documentaries graphically detailing the sordid events … but they don’t come close to describing the lingering impact that having the story told to you by the human remains of someone who was there and watched as those around him were being killed one by one and who had then moved into a slow downward death spiral that had been dragging on for almost twenty years.\n\nTurned out that Barry and I were born in the same month of the same year but after that our commonalities ended very quickly … for the next five hours as he continued to drink he talked, a rambling monotone spoken more to himself than to me … I had nothing to say so I listened respectfully as this tormented creature disappeared into his deep dark abyss of unremitting grief and sorrow. It was a captivating story about the honourable patriotic inclinations of a youthful southern boy followed by the stark reality of the actual futile struggle being staged thousands of miles from home … his gut-wrenching tale of 300 helpless soldiers trapped in a valley for days on end at the nightly mercy of the roving, rampaging enemy until 32 manage to be rescued leaving the bodies of their fallen brothers behind – never to be retrieved. About being returned home to months in a Veterans Hospital before being discharged into another endless battle in a strange newly hostile land that once was home? Assisted by a government which did not desert their damaged sons he returned to school and became an aggressive defense lawyer working to protect the bad guys in the sleezy underworld in and around Atlanta. Making money was never the problem … it was the sleepless nights … the sudden flashbacks of dark creatures in a moonless jungle looking for you as you lay completely still hoping, praying, that they wouldn’t find you this time but knowing there would always be another next time … and then another next time. There were the daily/nightly phone calls to the other 31 … then the 30 … then the 29 … and now there were only 17. There were the several failed marriages and the drugs that never quite worked as well or lasted as long as they should … and then there were the income tax and money laundering problems and being disbarred by the Georgia state legal society. And then the realization that there had to be a better, safer place to live … somewhere with a new beginning, a new purpose … a place where the memories and effects of Vietnam were not the only constant focus and unyielding consideration.\n\nJamaica as a former British colony without the overbearing omnipresent influence of American newspapers, radio and television was virtually oblivious to the goings on in Vietnam during the years of war and the lingering aftermath. Jamaicans knew and cared very little about the history of the conflict and its divisive social disruption on American society so they weren’t concerned when a growing number of Vietnam veterans started moving into their country. I had associated daily with American veterans working as consultants in Kingston during my own consulting period there in the early 80s … they were a macho group of hardworking-hard playing guys about my age who frequented the hotels and bars in New Kingston nightly and were a positive contributing element to Jamaica as the American government aggressively funded the development of a new anti-socialist pro-American business and political system throughout the Caribbean to offset Cuba’s Fidel Castro’s communistic influence (money speaks louder than words). Many of the original advertisers in my tourist magazine were American business owners in Jamaica’s tourism sector. Several of that group were American Vietnam Vets who had consciously decided that America was a part of their past best put behind them as they tried to move forward with their lives. Port Antonio, Ocho Rios and Negril all benefitted tremendously as these Americans provided financial investment and business experience/leadership to the local tourism infrastructure. Ironically many of these early participants were short term contributors as the tendency has always been that many non-Jamaicans in the tourism sector will arrive, set up successful businesses and then within a few years either lose interest, become disgruntled and leave of their own volition or are forced out because what they are doing doesn’t fit in with acceptable local business practises or their personal habits/lifestyles are locally intolerable.\n\nBut there was another group of American Vietnam Veterans who looked at Jamaica for different reasons. As Barry explained it: for them, from the damaged goods section of the survivors pile, Jamaica was an escape … perhaps a solution to their long list of problems. There were mental health, physical well being and financial reasons for heading south to an English-speaking tropical island where being a Vietnam Veteran didn’t automatically attract negative, or at least suspicious, attention. You looked and talked like a tourist … you had enough money each month for food and lodging … so as long as you weren’t causing problems you could pretty much come and go as you pleased. If you wanted to rent a hut in the hills, or a room in town, and spend your time quietly smoking and drinking and minding your own business you could stay in Jamaica indefinitely. The constantly warm sunny weather and improved air quality, fresher and cleaner, was so much more appealing than what was available in the hostile American cities. The monthly American Veterans pension would go so much farther in Jamaica and the people and country were wonderfully laid-back – completely nonintrusive or threatening … it seemed to equate to an easier, less stressful lifestyle. After our emotionally draining all-day session I never saw Barry Landon again. I hoped that Jamaica would provide him with the sanctuary he was looking for but as I was listening to his story I was overwhelmed by a sense of hopelessness. Everything he was saying and feeling about Jamaica based on having been there for a month was true but … first impressions can be so deceiving.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Vietnam Veterans moved to Jamaica in the 80s and 90s and for many like Roger it worked out. They received 100% of their allotted retired veterans military pensions/benefits monthly and got on with their new lives as they jumped into the melting pot that Jamaica has always been … the country’s motto: ‘out of many one people’ is well deserved. For others Jamaica wasn’t what they needed …\n\nAlfred later told me what happened to Barry Landon and several other Vets who had tried unsuccessfully to reestablish themselves in the Negril area. Barry became an unwanted daily regular at Alfred’s Bar. Initially he came and went without incident but gradually he started getting into arguments with other American guests of about his same age several of which led to physical altercations. He would contritely return the following day, ask forgiveness and promise that he would be better going forward. Alfred, who as a younger man had had a history of substance abuse issues, (successfully rehabilitated) was more than patient and understanding and would invariably allow Barry to return. Eventually the growing ‘anger management’ problem took care of itself when several other American Vets living quietly in the area did an ‘Intervention’ … they physically escorted Barry to the Montego Bay Airport where he was met by two American VFW officials who then escorted him back to a military hospital in Georgia. I don’t know what became of Barry Landon but my memories of him and his tormented existence remind me of how fortunate I have been.\n\nOf the 2,709,918 Americans who served in Vietnam less than 850,000 were still alive 50-years after the last American soldier left on March 29, 1973 … the youngest would now be just over 70.\n\n** My source is of updated local info is Owen … more commonly referred to as ‘O’ who is a Canadian (Cambridge ON) snowbird fixture in Negril … ‘O’ does four or five months each winter and can be found each afternoon, after his morning walk along the beach, at the ‘Sunny Side Bar’ … when he arrives the meeting is ‘Called to Order’ – when he departs the session is ‘Adjoured’\n\nAdventures Along the Seaweed Trail … Negril 2024\n\nWe arrived in Negril late in the afternoon after a leisurely four-hour trip along the main northcoast road from the airport. Of course Rod and I had our first two (or three) Red Stripes with Ms. Shawn at Patsy’s Sunset bar on Gloucester Avenue across from the Belvedere Beach in Montego Bay. It’s a fifteen-year tradition and not something that is ever taken for granted … it is our much anticipated taking off spot for our return trips to Jamaica!\n\nA particularly violent ocean storm front is moving through Montego Bay as we are arriving and the waves are literally crashing onto Gloucester Avenue which is a spectacular and extremely mesmerizing occurrence. By the time we arrive in Negril the storm, coming hard from the west, has already deposited a thick gooey covering of seaweed along the beach from the island off Hedonism II at the northend all the way along to the Negril River at the southend … at least a foot deep, and up to three-feet in places, extending up to sixty-feet inland from the ocean edge. Rod and I, oblivious of this natural phenomenon, headed off down the beach in the dark (no moonlight, no starlight, nothing – absolutely black!) along the unmarked Seaweed Trail, determined to reach Alfred’s Ocean Palace for a much-needed dinner to top off our first day. Although an ocean purging seaweed deposit along the beach happens several times each year it isn’t until the following morning in the bright daylight that we realize the unprecendented magnitude of Mother Nature’s most recent dump … if we had fallen into the gloop on our injudicious trek we may have never been found! The mountains of seaweed became the main topic of discussion up and down the beach and serve as a perfect example of the never ending battle between mother nature and human resolve … it took almost a week for the small army of shovel wielding overmatched humans with a fleet of John Deere backhoes to remove the mounds of seaweed that a passing twelve-hour storm left behind.\n\nThe Negril TreeHouse, our accommodation of choice and tradition had sent a truly excellent driver to fetch and deliver us, in due course, to the beachfront resort. Williams turned out to be an insightful and obliging tour guide who suggested two additional local spots along the way where we were able to spend exceptionally quality time with the bar owners and patrons who provided us with updates as to what was happening economically, politically and socially to main street Jamaicans. Rod and I quickly and easily moved back into our Jamaica mode … there is a lot of talking, laughing, handshaking and arm waving … we were back in our comfort zone!\n\nMany of the guests frequenting the TreeHouse bar are familiar faces. I’m not great with names but I have an uncanny ability to remember where people are from? (“so how are things in Minnesota?” replaces “hey Tom how have you been?”) More than a few of the faces have been repeat visitors to the resort since long before Rod and I first arrived … and this year many of the returnees have brought along friends and family to join the party. This group is here to drink and talk pretty much uninterrupted starting about noon right up until closing time … they might slip away for a nap, or whatever, sometime during the day, but the bar area is where they spend the majority of their upright time … there may be a little covert smoking going on but nary a cellphone in sight. It is very much an ‘In the Now Place’ !! We instantly became contributing participants to the collective vibrancy.\n\nAs will invariably happen in the dynamic tourism industry time and externally motivated change is working against the TreeHouse and the other independently owned/operated hotels along the Seven-Mile Beach. I can attest to this tourism related phenomenon from firsthand personal experience: Many of my original ‘Jamaica Today’ advertisers of almost forty years ago came from an endangered group of aging Montego Bay area hotels collectively being marketed as the ‘Inns of Jamaica’. The Jamaica Tourist Board was spending considerable time and money promoting these privately owned historic relics dating from the initial golden age of Jamaican tourism. The aging owners were wonderfully considerate and well-intentioned Jamaicans whose fifteen-twenty room hotels were scattered along the streets and in the hills of the downtown area of Montego Bay. What their properties lacked was beachfront, adequate air conditioning, reliable North American standard electrical and water service and the prepackaged image of fun and activity (energy) that the North American travel wholesalers were marketing to a new generation (early boomers) of travellers. Quiet, quaint and inconveniently quirky was no longer working and no amount of advertising and government support was enough to keep them from fading into oblivion. The replacement wave of briefly popular larger, poorly constructed/designed budget quality 150-200 room hotels survived along Gloucester Avenue and Kent Streets for less than a decade before they too were deserted by the international travel wholesalers. A brief resurgence as ‘spaghetti dinner – lukewarm draft beer’ all-inclusive resorts confirmed that the all-inclusive concept was the future of Jamaica tourism but not in these tired leftover low-budget properties. There still is a motley collection of empty/closed hotel structures within two or three miles of the Montego Bay airport for which no new purpose has yet been envisioned.\n\nThe room rates at the TreeHouse are the same as they were in 2020, the gardenlike grounds are immaculately maintained, the rooms are invaribly clean and bright, the pool, bar, beach and restaurant areas are obsessively well maintained and the staff is unfailingly friendly, energetic and engaging but the warm winds of change cannot be ignored or held back. There was a time when the Negril TreeHouse was rated as a 4.5 to 5-star property and wholesalers lined up to have booking access … the 2024 ratings have slipped to 4 to 4.5 stars and there are an increased number of (petty?) negative comments creeping into the reviews such as; lack of amenities, too many second level rooms with stairs and shared balconies and locals on the beach selling unwanted services and products. Nothing physically has changed at the TreeHouse but there are newer more modern options becoming available at the north end of town which have attracted the attention of the wholesalers and, by extension, the interest of the more demanding late Boomer and Generation X visitors to Jamaica. As the TreeHouse gently ages so do its’ cliental … there certainly is no lack of ‘Energy’ with the returning guests but as they inevitably/gradually fade away they aren’t being replaced … if the average age of the guests thirty years ago was 35– it’s now 65. This seems to have become a recurring theme along the Seven-Mile Beach.\n\nGail Jackson, the TreeHouse owner, is still very much the driving force and main source of brainpower and ‘energy’ that has kept her dynamic operation as the preeminent non-all-inclusive destination in all of Negril. I don’t suspect for one moment that as a young girl growing up in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania she envisoned ending up as the most influential promoter in the United States of Negril as a tourist destination … she organized the ‘ Negril fam trips’ in the 80s and 90s that resulted in the initial waves of visitors from the New York, Minnesota and Chicago areas. Forty years later if you ask visitors in Negril where they are from invariably the answer will be – Minnesota, the New York area or from the midwest arriving from Chicago. There are only three people I know whose lives/accomplishments deserve a book and she is at the top of that short list …\n\nOne evening while enthusiastically partaking in the social activities at the TreeHouse bar I noticed a new guest who for a brief moment reminded me of Eric Wadsworth my original partner in our tourist magazine ‘Jamaica Today’. It brought back some painful Jamaican memories. Eric and I had made our first sales call together at the TreeHouse almost forty years previously and without his generous financial support at that time I would not have been able to pursue my Jamaican ambitions. In hindsight I owe Eric an apology because being much younger, driven and egocentric at that stage of my life I hadn’t realized why he had gotten involved in such a crazy idea. Now, all these years later, being a part of a group of people in our sixties and seventies trying to stay young and relevant I now understand what he was going through. Mentally and physically burdened with significant health issues he was doing everything he could to stay involved, find a sense of purpose and continue to do the things he loved to do. Eric loved people, loved hearing and telling stories of the good times gone by, loved music, loved a good cigar and could drink from noon to midnight – or longer if the opportunity presented itself. Because he had serious life-shortening intestinal issues he didn’t expect to make it to seventy – and he didn’t. The reason why he had enthusiastically financed a tourist magazine in Jamaica wasn’t because he wanted to be in the publishing business or had any illusions about it being a financial success … it was so that he had the freedom to go and play in a tropical paradise for weeks at a time away from the constant nagging of his family and doctors. It wasn’t until that exact moment that night at the TreeHouse bar decades later that Eric’s motives finally became clear to me.\n\nOn a brighter note … Without doubt the most pleasant surprise of our trip was that Jack (Giacomo) Duva, our all-time favourite mob lawyer from New York City (Colts Neck, NJ) by way of Miami, was in the house … and in excellent form! Because he had not been at the TreeHouse the last time we were there, and no one had any updates, Rod and I had incorrectly assumed that his bad habits and/or his dangerous acquaintances had finally finished him off. Not true … he was a touch greyer around the edges and walked a step or two slower but he was still the main attraction at the bar – best stories, best jokes and the phenomenal ability to make anyone he was talking to feel somehow smarter and more important. Some more discerning folks might consider him gruff, vulgar and indiscrete but to us, the TreeHouse and the people there, are much better when Jack is holding court. (Eric Wadsworth would have enjoyed him immensely! … they would have been a dangerously entertaining pair!)\n\nOne of the more engaging groups at the TreeHouse this trip was an eightsome from the New York City area who were delightfully quirky – perhaps obstreperously perverse? Three men and five women who were members of the same social circle … none presently married but all very much into complicated relationships and dalliances had taken up joint occupancy of one of the large beachfront suites. Two of the men may have also been by-sexual but the full details of their stories/backgrounds will never be known and what they did reveal to us may well have been fascinating/titillating/scandalous but not even close to the truth? Their ages ranged from the early sixties to the mid seventies, but they carried on like horny twenty-year olds. Two of the ladies took an instant liking to Rod and I … we represented potential new/fresh opportunities? Although it was flattering to be aggressively pursued by hot-blooded American women for the first time in about fifty years we maintained the international policy of Canadian non-participation in physical involvement. Being hit upon by feisty senior American women looking for a little excitement was a recurring phenomenon on the trip which was truly amazing and amusing … it just goes to show that if you last long enough and have decent posture and most of your teeth you’ll probably look good to someone. Poor Jack, a self-professed womanizer of legendary status, despite his willingness to participate, was shutout of the action … one disinterested lady offered dismissively that he looked and sounded too much like Danny Devito for her liking.\n\nAs Rod is inclined to do he struck up an entertaining new friendship while we are away. The two young German males he became semi-attached to shall be referred to as German #1 and German #2 because if I ever knew their names they have escaped me. (perhaps they referred to us as Old Canadian Guy #1 and Old Canadian Guy # 2?). By the time we met these two at the TreeHouse bar they had already been touring Jamaica for almost six weeks … Negril was their last stop before heading home. Their insight into what was happening in Kingston, Port Antonio, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay was particularly captivating to me because although I had absolutely no intention of visiting those other hubs of Jamaican tourism I was extremely interested in their appraisal/opinion of what was happening at the four other locations. Over a two- or three-day period I was able to extract enough information to come to a superficial understanding of the direction of Jamaican tourism based on the Germans’ observations. I have always held Germans in high regard based on their history and my exposure to them. They are a comparatively serious people, well organized and excellent communicators … their observations and interpretation of what they had experienced on their cross-Jamaica expedition was extremely engrossing.\n\nTheir summary: Kingston is a large urban sprawl focused on serving the needs of the million or so Jamaicans living there along with being the government, economic and cultural centre of the country … any visitors/tourists spending time in Kingston will find that they are basically ignored unless they are there for business or government related purposes. There are a couple of interesting historical sites to visit but not much in the way of tourist focused activities or attractions.\n\nPort Antonio, which was a thriving tourist destination in the 80s and early 90s, has reverted back to simply being Jamaica’s largest northcoast harbour and the secluded hideaway for wealthy Jamaicans and visitors who quietly luxuriate in their beautiful villas and condos tucked into the tropical rainforest along the coastline. German #1 reported that there really wasn’t anything for tourists to do in and around Port Antonio but that the local girls were the most attractive in Jamaica but, unfortunately, not much interested in meeting or fraternizing with visiting Germans.\n\nOcho Rios was the most disappointing Jamaican stop for our two new friends. The area is obviously popular with the foreign visitors sequestered behind the walls and fences of high-end all-inclusive resorts which leads to a chronic shortage of quality public beaches and restaurants. The downtown area basically shutdowns when the craft market closes for the day. German #2 reported that it was frustratingly difficult to find a decent place to eat. They agreed that it was a quiet boring place of little interest.\n\nTheir stay in Montego Bay was a much better experience … there was lots to see and do. The locals were at least engaging but somewhat aggressive. When I mentioned that back in the 80s, when German factories routinely closed down for six-weeks in the summer, the healthy/horny German workers would flock to Montego Bay for weeks at a time and ardently wear out the local hookers. German #2 immediately suggested that German #1’s father and uncles were definitely part of that crowd. German #1 responded that he distinctly remembered German #2’s mother and grandmother (die Oma) both visiting Jamaica each summer for the exact same reason. They both seemed quite proud to think that members of their families had previously been repeat visitors to Jamaica.\n\nAnd they saved the best for last. The Germans’ last afternoon and early evening in Negril was spent out at Rick’s Café. The place was packed with about a thousand beautiful people from around the world who were in a party mood. The energetic, enthusiastic and wonderfully efficient Jamaica DJ had the crowd in a frenzy while the pretty young Jamaican servers were doing a particularly good job of overserving the more than accepting patrons ice-cold Red Stripes, a large array of perfectly prepared rum drinks and supersized Marguerita’s. Rod was in exceptionally fine form regaling the boys with tales of earlier visits and life in general … a good time was had by all!! The highlight of the boisterous interactive entertainment was the ‘sexy dance contest’ in which a collection of bouncy young women of varying shapes and sizes, who have been at least moderately overserved, are encouraged by the DJ and the appreciative crowd to ‘shake their booties’. England, Canada, the United States and Mexico were represented in the dance-off but it was the noticeably overweight, tattooed young honeymooner from Nebraska who stole the show – encouraged by her equally rotund and tattooed husband. To add to their though-provoking appeal the newly married couple looked so much alike that they could have easily passed for brother and sister? It is all in good fun and both German #1 and German #2, obviously fully engaged and enjoying themselves immensely declare, almost in unison, “this is the best place in Jamaica!” And to top off their visit to Negril’s most famous and popular tourist attraction mother nature delivers, in Rod’s experienced opinion, the best sunset ever seen in Jamaica!\n\nUnfortunately, but not unexpectantly, the Grand Pineapple, Foote Prints and the Beachcomber, all beach front resorts, are closed while we are in Negril without any scheduled/planned re-opening dates. The Grand Pineapple had spent its final seasons as a low budget – last minute destination for thrifty Canadians but didn’t survive Covid … it had been going downhill structurally for at least ten-years prior to that and was poorly managed and notorious for having uninterested/rude staff. The Beachcomber, owned by the McGann family who have generations of Jamaican hotel experience, is also a large operation. The beachfront property still looks good but reopening a hotel of that size when there is a shortage of experienced local staff is going to be challenging. Foote Prints has always been a quiet family owned & operated hotel … their ‘Closed for Renovations’ sign can be a good thing or a very bad thing? Running a tourist hotel anywhere without a steady flow of enthusiastic repeat guests is extremely difficult but when trying to do so along the beach in Negril faced with constantly improved competition it is a terminal condition.\n\nSo at the end it still comes down to the ‘energy’ that makes a place work or not … the smaller independent hotels, restaurants and bars along the beach, and out on the Westend Road, will continue to survive and succeed as long as they can continue to provide and generate that mysterious but critical intangible. The TreeHouse has incredible ‘energy’ … the guests and staff ooze a palatable and permeating ‘energy’ that results in an intoxicating experience that makes you want to come back for more.\n\nLive music has long been a major Jamaican attraction and Negril has a well-earned reputation as the place to see it at its best. The ‘Boat Bar’, ‘Drifters’, ‘Chances’ and the ‘Charela Inn’ are our regular venues of choice and during our ten-day stay we were more than delighted with the quality and variety of the performances. Old regulars such as Frank Aird and Otis Gale seem to be getting better each year as they continue to regale their loyal fans while newer younger Jamaican musicians gradually come to the fore … the Sunday afternoon jazz session at Chances may have been the preeminent production of the week delivered by an obviously younger grouping of talented local players. Many of these musicians are regularly employed as the nightly entertainment at the upscale all-inclusive properties springing up at the northend of town … but, more importantly to us long timers, the live, unrehearsed, impromptu daytime sessions along the beach are their opportunity to experiment with new ideas and jam with their buddies to the immense delight of all involved. Unfortunately we did not cross paths with Tony Cauch, a popular Canadian entertainer extraordinaire, during our stay and were saddened to be informed that Joe Issacs a beloved Jamaican drummer/promotor was stuck in Canada due to medical inconveniences.\n\nRod and I made a daytrip out to the Westend starting at the still vibrant Xtabi Hotel which has always been on our must check-out list … the underwater caves are endlessly fascinating and draw a steady flow of curious first timers and repeat visitors. Our lunch at LTU pub and follow-up visit to Rick’s Café next door were prerequisites of the trip … both places looked great, were busy and surprisingly the beer prices at Rick’s had not changed from four years ago. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of activity we observed along the Westend Road – the little shops and restaurants seemed to be doing a steady business. However the most impressive fact to be reported about Negril’s Westend is that there were absolutely no homeless people and no garbage anywhere to be seen … very few North American cities can make a similar claim. An increasing number of the properties dating from the 70s and 80s have already been or are in various stages of renovation. It was an intriguing walk from Rick’s Café back to the town centre roundabout which left us with positive feelings about the future of that part of town. As Jamaica’s middleclass continues to grow and prosper Negril’s Westend has become an increasingly popular local tourist destination – replacing Montego Bay as the preferred safe, easy to get to and good value holiday fun spot and weekend hideaway for wandering Kingstonians.\n\nGym and Linda, our much beloved friends from Minnesota, had already arrived in Negril for their three-month stay and they instantly became an integral part of our daily routine. Our fifteen-year relationship has consisted of many quality hours of beer drinking at the numerous little bars along Negril’s white sand beach … and we picked up from where we last left off. As it is with our generation much of the conversation dealt with medical problems and family matters … more time is spent talking about what we used to do as opposed to what we are going to do? We didn’t drink nearly as much beer or anywhere near as quickly as in previous years but we did our best to act as young as we could and for a few fleeting hours we turned back the clock to cherished times long gone but fondly remembered. At our last parting we didn’t say “ Goodbye” we said “See you next year – same time, same place” … I don’t know if any of us really believed it?\n\nBest Friends … Best Place …. Best Time!! (Linda, Rod & Gym at Sunny Side)\n\nIt has been several weeks since Rod and I returned to Canada from Jamaica. We had agreed prior to, during and immediately after that this was going to be our last visit … the end!! Within 48-hours of arriving home I jumped into a car and drove to California for a month-long stay. So now I am writing about a trip to Negril while enjoying the more sedate Palm Springs lifestyle. If I never return to Negril there will be so many things about the place I will miss starting with the hours of walking the beach followed by the daily live music sessions followed by the hours of easy socializing … the beauty of the country and the good hearts of the people. So despite our agreement it will be much easier for me going forward to leave the return door slightly open … (and I do have about half a million words of documented memories)\n\nNumquam dic numquam …\n\nReturn to Negril … 2024\n\nI am going back to Negril next week … it seems only fitting that I should write/post something before I go and then do a follow up after I return …. so I shall\n\nRambling Reminiscences …\n\nEarly in January 1984 would have been my first exposure to Negril … Jeff Kaiser and I were running our little hat manufacturing operation in Kingston and would spend our weekends discovering the beaches and bars of Jamaica. I had previously spent several weekends in Ocho Rios and had been to Port Antonio and Montego Bay a couple of times before we finally made our way over to Negril. We were expecting to find leftover hippies from North America and European backpackers engaging in their own unique lifestyle/culture and we certainly weren’t disappointed. Ocho Rios, Port Antonio and Montego Bay were already enjoying a steady flow of visiting tourists who looked and acted pretty much like Jeff and I, but Negril was a completely different world. We had virtually nothing in common with the strikingly beautiful boys and girls of all ages who made up the bulk of Negril’s earlier visitors. They were content to sleep in sleeping bags under the stars or in small one- or two-man tents along the beach or in basic wooden cabins and cottages out on the West End. The pungent aroma of ganja seemed to hang over the whole town like an invisible cloud. We spent a considerable amount of our time sunning ourselves on the beach at Cosmos’ restaurant and campground at the northend of the beach and took in our first genuine live reggae concert in a vacant lot that stretched from the main road (Norman Manley Drive) down to the beach which soon thereafter became the home of the beloved ‘Da Bus’ food stand and entertainment yard. As more and more new era tourists, with much more money to spend, gradually found their way to Negril in the mid-eighties the gracefully aging hippies and backpackers from an earlier time moved onto less commercialized hideaways on the shores of south Asia. Negril’s new wave of tourists looked and acted like me. I consider myself as extremely fortunate that I had a brief glimpse of what Negril was really about before it became the thriving commercialized tourist destination that it has now been for the last 40-years.\n\nGreat spot for music and food in the mid 1980s\n\nJeff and I had the opportunity to personally experience the early 80’s version of Negril’s West End which at that time was the more popular final destination for the visiting hippies and backpackers along with an aging group of eccentric artists, poets, dreamers and freethinkers who had originally discovered and developed this unique little corner of the world many years before and spent their winters along the rocky seacoast in quiet seclusion. They too were being replaced by the new wave of boisterous ‘in and out tourists’ who arrived one Saturday and left the next. The 1984 version of Rick’s Café was a simple bar serving cold Red Stripe from a cooler full of ice and warm patties from a food cart – with primitive public washrooms. The cliffs are the same but otherwise everything about the place has been changed numerous times in the past forty-years – sometimes due to generational hurricanes but more often in a never-ending attempt to upgrade while increasing the capacity. Jeff and I bought a few beers and snorkeled but most of the folks at Rick’s on our first few visits were content to simply sunbath quietly on the rocks while indulging in the local ganja. Come to think about it – I haven’t seen any of those spectacular topless German girls anywhere in Negril for about twenty-five years. On several occasions we spent the night out on the West End at the Xtabi Hotel which had been open for about twenty-years at that point. In later years when Jeff was doing his magazine in Negril he would stay there for weeks at a time. It is still one of the most popular hotels on the West End and the caves underneath attract a steady flow of visitors everyday. In an earlier posting: Fifty Years in Negril – Royal in Hiding’ ( from June 2019) I shared the insightful memories of a truly remarkable ‘Lady Sarah’ who had been a part of Negril since the early 60s …\n\nJeff Kaiser …. Negril 1984\n\nI can divide my Jamaican experience into several distinct time periods … Early 1983- to 1985 was my ‘Kingston Hat Making’ adventure (with Gerry Dean and Jeff Kaiser) followed by my 1985- to late 1986 ‘Wandering in the Wilderness’ days ( with Jeff Kaiser) which led to my ‘Jamaica Today Magazine’ (with Eric Wadsworth) during the 1986-1992 period. The 1993-2008 years are somewhat of a blurr? … I set up an incredibly popular/frustrating Bar Coaster business for a frenetic couple of years, spent about a year setting up Travel Insurance Sales outlets around the island, spent one very expensive/disastrous year trying to organize ‘The Belvedere Bed & Breakfast’ in Montego Bay … there may have been a couple of other business adventures along the way that are best forgotten! Finally I saw the light and accepted that I was never going to find the ‘Get Rich Quik’ idea that I had been pursuing for almost half my life … persistence is an expensive trait! In 2009 Rod Platt and I entered into our Jamaica as a holiday destination days – the final iteration.\n\nEric Wadsworth – co-founder of ‘Jamaica Today’ … on a sales call 1987\n\nAfter Jeff Kaiser and I had put our Kingston experience behind us we spent two years touring Jamaica in search of our next business opportunity. One of my worst ideas that never came to fruition was to rent a small shop out on the West End and to sell newspapers from around the world, offer international phone calling services, do currency exchange, sell coffee and donuts and be a hangout place for tired backpackers. I wanted to name my little shop ‘The Nixon Agnew Republican Restaurant’ … fortunately I couldn’t find any investors for that idea. We also considered buying a vacant one-acre beachfront property about one-thousand yards north of Alfred’s Ocean Palace. It was selling for fifty thousand American dollars at the time … we made a big mistake by not moving forward with that opportunity.\n\nWhen I returned to Negril in the late summer of 1986, after finally escaping from the wilderness, my first stop was at the Negril TreeHouse. I hadn’t preplanned this as my first call as the Sales Manager of my new publishing project, but it was as good a place to park and start as anywhere else along the beach. I had Eric Wadsworth, my business partner and primary investor, with me and it was showtime day one. It was during my Jamaica Today days that Negril gradually became my preferred Jamaican destination. I loved doing business in Port Antonio, was successful and comfortable in Montego Bay, enjoyed spending productive/profitable time in Ocho Rios and was always happy to visit old friends and business contacts in Kingston but it was Negril that I ultimately fell in love with. There on that perfect sunny day on the prettiest beach in the world I became a different person … I discovered abilities that I never dreamed that I possessed ..(desperation is a powerful motivator). Within an hour of our arrival the TreeHouse became the back cover advertiser on the first edition of Jamaica Today Fall 1986 Edition. Jimmy Jackson, the hotel owner, was my first Negril contact and readily agreed to have his property prominently displayed on the back cover of a publication that existed only in my imagination. What did he have to lose? … absolutely nothing. I needed credibility more than money at that point so his back cover position was completely complimentary. It was amazing how many paying customers signed up on that first sales tour of Negril when they heard that Jimmy Jackson was already on board with this exciting new promotional venture and was going to take the back cover. It was an incredibly effective sales ploy that mysteriously came upon me spontaneously on that life-changing afternoon. After adding Rick’s Café as the inside back cover the remaining seven pages in the Negril section of my fledgling magazine were quickly bought up by enthusiastic paying advertisers who did not want to be left out. My partner Eric was dumbfounded by my effective, energetic and extremely entertaining selling style … as was I.\n\nOne of my first ‘Jamaica Today’ advertisers … Sabrina – owner of ‘SamSara’ – 1986\n\nDuring my ‘Jamaica Today’ period my favourite Negril stopping spot was Alfred’s Ocean Palace. It was, by far, the most popular bar, restaurant and entertainment venue on the seven-mile beach. From late morning under the bright sun until early the next morning under a million twinkling stars people from around the world came to play. They came early to play in or watch the never-ending volleyball matches, stayed for drinks at sunset, stayed for dinner and more drinks and stayed late into the night for the best live reggae entertainment anywhere on the northcoast. It was a spectacular place to people watch and make new lifelong friends. Alfred Arthur a many generational local, and Cindy, his very personable Minnesotan wife, lived on the property and added their own engaging personalities into the multilayered mix of rich & poor, young & old, first-time visitor from afar & longtime local regular. Alfred’s was an unpretentious open concept wooden structure with strategic Christmas lighting in the 1980s and still is …\n\nAlfred and Cindy … 1988\n\nThere was a time when Alfred knew who I was and always made a point of joining me for a drink or two … Alfred’s was a regular advertiser and I always spent as many hours as possible entertaining myself and others at his bar when I was in town. During the peak of my ‘Jamaica Today’ adventure the beach volleyball being played at Alfred’s had reached a serious competitive level … so much so that it became a gathering place for top quality players from the United States and Canada. There were regularly scheduled tournaments with decent prize money up for grabs. As it turned out I had met two young American guys from ESPN one night in Marguerite’s in Montego Bay. They were business associates of Bob Griffin who was also one of my advertisers and occasional golf partner. Bob’s family owned a TV station in South Florida and he had invited these guys to come to Jamaica and spend a few days playing with him on his 60-foot catamaran. ESPN was a cable channel in its early days and was always on the look out for inexpensive sporting events that they could film and then use to fill their broadcasting schedule. This is an example of fortuitous timing … I mentioned to them that Alfred’s had regularly scheduled beach volleyball tournaments featuring hours and hours of beautiful, healthy, scantily dressed men and women … perhaps it was something that they might be interested in? Within a couple of days of this conversation I had occasion to spend some time with Alfred and told him of my conversation with my contacts at ESPN … I’m sure that I embellished the details of my relationship and conversation with the ESPN guys but that was totalling in character with my ‘Jamaica Today’ persona. Three or four days later Bob Griffin’s catamaran dropped anchor just off the beach at Alfred’s and the three American TV executives made their way up to the bar and asked to see Alfred. ESPN ended up filming one or two of Alfred’s tournaments which turned out to be excellent filler on the sports only cable network. For many years thereafter, well after I had closed down my magazine and was into my next Jamaica phase, whenever Alfred saw me he would treat me like a long-lost friend, and we’d spend some time talking and laughing about the ESPN beach volleyball days … he gave me far more credit for the ESPN exposure than I ever deserved but I was more than happy to let him … it was good for my soul!\n\nBy the time Rod Platt and I started our annual visits to Negril each February Alfred’s Ocean Palace’s personality had changed … no more volleyball, no more crowded bar, no more Alfred and Cindy hovering about, and, unfortunately, the quality of the infrequent reggae shows had gone from invariably great to sometimes good/sometimes not. But there were still some extraordinary evenings …\n\n(Self plagiarized from ‘Negril Memories’ – posted September 2020) On the Wednesday night we wander about a hundred-fifty metres down the beach for some live entertainment. The house band at Alfred’s Ocean Palace has been warming up for the better part of an hour. Gradually the place is filling up with locals, tourists and a noticeable number of musicians. There is palpable anticipation in the air. Something special must be going on here tonight? The band finally starts their first set around ten. The place is packed. They go through a couple of numbers without incident or memorable execution. The full moon is a bright orange and the million-plus stars twinkle magically above. About twenty minutes into the performance there is a slight disturbance of some sort happening backstage. The audience and the band’s attention are drawn to a tall thin creature as it moves onto the stage. He’s a casually dressed Rasta man. Holding an old beat-up trumpet in his left hand he slowly takes a position slightly to the right of the lead guitarist. The band members continue playing but it is obvious that they are waiting and watching for some signal from this mysterious creature. The crowd has also sensed that something extraordinary is about to happen. The smiling Rasta man coughs quietly and brings his horn up to his lips. As he begins to play, a collective awe falls over the locals, the tourists and the assembled musicians who have gathered to hear ‘The Trumpet Playing Man’. There doesn’t appear to be even a hint of resistance or reluctance by the band members to allow this horn blower to wander in and out of songs whenever he is so inclined– in support, or to take off into another spectacular solo, which invariably inspires the crowd to jump to their feet and break into thunderous applause. Not only are the tourists mesmerized by what is happening live, in front of their very eyes up on stage, but the unusually large group of slightly older, well dressed, locals in attendance are equally enthralled. But the most amazing reaction to this stunning performance comes from the gathered spectating musicians who are absolutely howling and moaning with pleasure. The musicians and locals came to this regularly scheduled Tuesday night show expecting that something spectacular was going to happen and were ecstatic. The tourists, accidently in attendance, witnessed an event, a performance, that was beyond their comprehension. The ten-minute rendition of ‘Take Five’ would have made Dave Brubeck envious – his group never made it sound better!. There were a lot of blank faces – they knew they had just been part of something wondrous but couldn’t explain. It was a ‘you had to be there’ experience. During one of the breaks Rod catches the trumpet man’s attention and he joins us. He hits Dee up for a cigarette to smoke now and one for later … I buy him a drink …. Rod lends him a twenty (never to be returned) and Roxanne buys one of the cassettes he is selling … our personal audience lasts about three minutes. Shortly thereafter he returns to the stage to start the next set … does a couple of memorable solos and then quietly disappears into the night\n\nCanada’s own YT (Young Tony) and Frank Aird (The Trumpet Playing Man) performing at the Boat Bar\n\nBy the mid- 2010s the beach music scene had made several significant adjustments in recognition of the changing times. At the top of the list was the starting time (sixty-year-olds have to go to bed earlier than thirty-year-olds) … afternoon performances several times a week at the ‘Boat Bar’ had quickly become an extremely popular mainstay as were sessions at ‘Drifters Bar & Entertainment Venue’. ‘Chances’ was also into the afternoon game – quite often providing a welcomed dose of Jazz … Jamaican musicians were internationally renown as top-class Jazz performers, and many had returned home to retire so there was no shortage of available players who would come and go during a three- or four-hour jam session. The ‘Charela Inn’ was doing dinner and dancing twice a week which was generally sold-out days in advance … the musicians would double up – doing afternoon gigs at the ‘Boat Bar’, ‘Drifters’ or ‘ Chances’ then dress up a little and do a 7:00pm – 10:00 show at ‘Charela’. Alfred’s hadn’t quit having popular unfailingly entertaining shows but I, along with many others of my generation, have become afternoon/early evening lovers of music … anything starting after 10:00pm just doesn’t fit my age-related required sleep cycle.\n\nOn stage with Charlene Davis at Kaiser’s on the West End …. 1990\n\nI saw Alfred one afternoon in the winter of 2009-or 2010. He looked shorter, thinner and had aged considerably since the last time I’d seen him maybe ten years before. I walked up to him stuck out my hand and said “Hello Alfred. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen you”. He shook my hand, looked at me perhaps expecting or hoping to recognize me … but obviously did not. I continued “I’m Peter Watson and we did some business together back in the 80s and 90s”. He responded slowly. “Oh yes of course. How have you been?” … I could tell by his body language and his glassy eyes that he had no idea who I was or any desire to find out. We mumbled a few more words, smiled, nodded and then headed off in our separate directions. I wasn’t the least bit surprised and only a little disappointed that from among the literally thousands and thousands of non-Jamaicans he had met over the past thirty-five years he didn’t remember me. Our little visit reminded me of two things that I already suspected: 1. Somethings are best left as fond memories 2. I was never as clever or as important as I wanted to be.\n\nXtabi will be one of the first spots Rod and I revisit during our upcoming tour. It was the first hotel I stayed at in Negril back in 1984 with Jeff Kaiser. I also stayed there numerous times during my magazine days and then again during my ‘blurr’ years and continue to visit the unique property each time I am in town … David Pebbles, the owner, who I’ve only spoken to a handful of times in forty years and also wouldn’t remember me, probably should be considered as my most reliable client in all of Jamaica. He paid for his advertising space in each and every one of the thirteen editions of ‘Jamaica Today’ and then paid a healthy upfront deposit for bar coasters during my ill-fated ‘Coaster King’ debacle. He also was one of the few bar coaster clients who ultimately received the goods they paid for … most received refunds of their deposits and mumbled apologies but I produced and delivered Xtabi’s promised coasters. I won’t be trying to reconnect with David – I have very positive memories of him that I will leave undisturbed.\n\nAnother truly excellent client who was willing and able to pay for anything I was selling was Cosmos Brown whose beach restaurant’ aptly named ‘Cosmos’’, founded 1976, was and remained to the end as a truly genuine example of what Negril was before it was discovered by the masses. Vince Janes, my displaced Mafia bagman friend from Montego Bay introduced me to Cosmos in 1984. Vince had given Cosmos, at absolutely no charge, the tables and chairs and several of the kitchen cookers, fryers and refrigeration units when Cosmos was just getting started. Vince had them leftover from a restaurant he had refurbished in Montego Bay. As far as Cosmos was concerned any friend of Vince’s was a friend of his … we never failed to talk about good old Vince whenever we got together. Cosmos was another client who received his full bar coaster order … any friend of Vince’s was a friend of mine! Vince Janes is featured in ‘Yes There Were Guns’ … originally posted April 2020\n\nVince Janes … leftover American Mafioso retiring/hiding in Jamaica 1960-1992\n\nThe infamous Hedonism II was also an early client of mine starting in 1986 … I would routinely drop into the front office to pick up my cheque. Even at that time it struck me that the flat top two story buildings looked more like the thousands of ubiquitous roadside motels you’d find along American highways than an internationally renowned upscale tropical resort catering to the young and beautiful who were looking for communal consensual sexual frolicking. By 2009, when Rod and I stayed at the neighbouring Point Village complex for a week, not only did the Hedonism buildings look like something left over from the 1970s (when they were originally built) but the people staying at there also looked like they possibly had been at their best in the 1970s (if they ever had a best) … it was a very strange looking place! This year we will probably walk by Hedonism II several times on our morning strolls just to get an update … there may be canes and walkers involved? Hedonism II has always been an outlier because appealing to sexual proclivities isn’t what Jamaican tourism is about and never has been. Unfortunately, in the opinion of many returning male visitors, the number of topless tourist ladies along the seven-mile beach has continued to diminish – they are now a rare sighting … I have never seen a topless Jamaican lady out in public because that is simply not an accepted part of the more conservative Jamaican culture.\n\nRod Platt and Jamaican artist ‘Joe James’ on our 1989 trip\n\nDuring our visits of 2010 and 2011 – Rod and I stayed at Rooms Negril which was, and still is, a boisterous, bustling beach front resort. I have a long history with the property dating from my magazine days. In 1986 Brian and Lisa Young arrived in Jamaica from Toronto to open the newly built Negril Inn which became the first all-inclusive property on the seven-mile beach. The family-owned property had been carefully developed by their father and was one of a healthy collection of locally owned hotels that were popping up in Negril during the late 1980s and early 1990s. When I finally met Brian he told me how excited he and his sister were about their\n\nBrian Young at his ‘Negril Inn’ 1988\n\nfantastic opportunity and was adamant about becoming a paying advertiser in my magazine. He was familiar with my publication because he had seen copies at both the Jamaica Tourist Board office in Toronto and being distributed at a large annual Travel Show being held at a convention hotel on the airport strip in Toronto. We agreed to have his professionally designed advertising piece grace the back cover for the next four editions. I moved the complimentary TreeHouse placement to the inside cover … Gail Jackson, the visionary owner operator, had become a valued contact by that time and the TreeHouse deserved to be a permanent fixture in Jamaica Today. About the same time young Ingrid Foote was moving into the role of General Manager at Foote Prints another new build located further north along the beach … her family had owned that piece of property for several generations. Foote Prints also became a happy new client. It was boomtime along the beach road with the addition of a dozen or so new, or newly refurbished, restaurants, hotels and retail facilities.\n\nIngrid Foote …. ‘Foote Prints’ 1987\n\nUnfortunately the all-inclusive concept did not fit with the size and location of the Negril Inn and the property was ultimately refitted and renamed. ‘Rooms Negril’ immediately became a booming success and remains as one of the most popular destinations along the beach. Rod and I met our favourite American friends, Gym (his preferred spelling) and Linda from Minnesota while we were all staying at Rooms. This amiable, engaging couple have a long and interesting history as annual winter fixtures in Negril which I should work into a blog in the near future …. They are representative of the generation of American Midwesterners who made up a large and extremely important part of Negril’s success during the peak Beach years. (The West End peak years were from the 1950’s through the mid 1980’s followed by the peak Beach years – mid 1980’s thru the early 2020’s … Negril’s future seems to be moving north up beyond the little airport to recently developed super properties and manually enhanced beaches?)\n\nMarie … serving up good times at her Sunny Side bar on the beach near Rooms Negril 2019\n\nA major contributing factor in my magazine’s ongoing success in Negril was the efforts of my local salesperson – Joan Danvers – who had been recommended to me by Gail at the TreeHouse. Joan was an instant success … on our first sales call together she deftly closed a deal, including receiving a 50% deposit, with the LTU Pub out on the West End Road beside Rick’s Café. It was the beginning of a mutually rewarding three-year relationship before she emigrated to the United States. LTU remained a client until I shut the magazine down … and then a decade later placed an order for bar coasters – which I ultimately was unable to deliver. There isn’t a better place to enjoy the spectacular view and mesmerizing sound of the waves breaking on the rocky cliffs out on the West End than at LTU … Rod and I will definitely be spending at least one afternoon and sunset enjoying a few beers and lunch at this special spot.\n\nJoan Danvers making her first sale at LTU Pub – 1987 … Lucy the blond co-owner eventually left Jamaica under tragic circumstances\n\nNext door to LTU is Rick’s Café … same rocky cliffs, same sunset but a completely different ambiance … it is always worth a visit. I have many wonderful memories of Negril’s most hyped attraction …\n\nFrom “Why There Are No Bar Coasters in Jamaica” first posted March 02, 2019\n\n2.15 PM – Rick’s Café\n\nAnyone who has taken even a passing notice of Negril in the travel press or talked to anyone who has ever been there will be familiar with Rick’s Café. This internationally renowned sunset watching Mecca has been surprising visitors since 1974. Surprising yes … by the fact that this simple wooden and cement deck set on an undistinguished piece of rock has become such an icon? Daily the tourist buses and taxis navigate the narrow pothole-filled Westend Road out to Rick’s so that several hundred people can cram into a small viewing area to catch the sun’s daily disappearance into the Caribbean. Having been there may be more impressive than being there? Yes, it is fun to jump off the cliffs into the clear blue green salty water and if you want to see what the wealthy tourists are wearing this season you probably couldn’t find a better place in all of Jamaica. Rick’s also has the dubious distinction of usually having the highest beer prices on the island (in early December 2005 Red Stripes at the bar were going quickly for slightly over $4.00 US while most places along the beach were charging less than $2.00) and on a busy day the beer at Rick’s is apt to be somewhat less than cold. But alas no trip to Negril, especially as part of a bus tour from Montego Bay or Ocho Rios, is complete without a visit to Rick’s Café. The place really is an enigma … I’ve been there at least a hundred times.\n\nArmed with my very popular presentation binder I march into Rick’s full of confidence that some management type will quickly decline my offer of providing the establishment with customized beer mats. This place has always been a tough sell – even at the peak of my magazine’s popularity I never could get a paid print ad order from any of the previous owners. There have been many owners and the place has been built and re-built numerous times (Hurricane Gilbert 1988 and Hurricane Ivan 2004 obliterated earlier iterations).\n\nThe top-ranking management person available is a pleasant Jamaican gentleman who agrees to see me immediately. We exchange introductions and smiles. I make him laugh with a couple of brief anecdotes about people and things that I had witnessed during previous visits to Rick’s. He reciprocates by performing several humorous remembrances of his own. I casually move on to the main point of my call. He is instantly captivated by the wonder of what I have in my binder. He immediately falls in love with my collection of brightly coloured bar coasters from around the world. I resist his offer to buy my collection for his own personal pleasure. But I’m not talking to the right man – he can’t sign an order and provide the necessary deposit. He does promise to enthusiastically support the concept when he presents it to the new owner who is returning from somewhere abroad and pleads with me to return the following Tuesday to meet the boss so that we can put a deal in place for January delivery. I promise to return and he buys me a beer. As we talk he obsessively studies/admires the pages of colourful circular and rectangular shaped bar coasters. We part as friends … I have something he wants!!\n\nA view of a normal afternoon at Rick’s Cafe taken from a catamaran anchored off shore\n\nAnd no visit to Negril would be complete without checking on what is happening at the quirky ‘Firefly Cottages’. Ken Vinen my eccentric gay hotelier friend from Stratford Ontario should have bought this place back in the 1990’s … he would have been the perfect owner! (As detailed in my ‘Buying A Hotel In Paradise’ blog – originally posted March 2019/ reposted January 2023) Ken spent almost a year trying to decide which of several resort properties to buy in Jamaica before giving up in frustration and buying an historic old cottage on the main street of Aylmer Ontario. Firefly’s odd collection of colourfully decorated cabins and cottages featuring outdoor showers and a clothes optional beach area was the beloved project of David and Audrey a gently aging couple originally from Kingston. Ken, Jeff Kaiser, Steve Murphy (aka – Fat Red Belly Man) and I spent several weeks at there one winter to get the feel of the place while Ken tried to assimilate himself into the local business community and put a deal together. It was not to be … the old German couples who frequented the clothing optional beach, and the basic concept of even having a clothing optional beach were not to Ken’s liking which was a major hurdle for David who was refusing to sell the property to anyone who was intending to discontinue offering the option. Several years after Ken reluctantly retreated from the scene David and Audrey did sell the property to new owners who immediately posted signs clearly stating that the beach was no longer ‘clothes optional’. The slightly larger than life-sized statue of Audrey in her prime and nothing else was quietly removed from the front garden … it was a very sad day for Negril as another unique facet of Negril’s early spirit and vivacity disappeared forever. Part of the original clothes optional beach area is now an attractive bar and restaurant which serves as a handy refueling spot during a warm afternoon stroll.\n\nThe airline tickets have been bought, a backgarden room at the Negril TreeHouse has been booked, I have an envelope full of American five-dollar bills for the ever-accommodating bartenders in the little bars scattered along the beach … It is with unsettling ambivalence that, after a three-year absence, I am returning to Jamaica … more specifically: returning to Negril!\n\nA very poor picture of Gail Jackson at the Treehouse … whose promotional efforts were so important to Negril\n\nThere has always been so much to do along Negril’s World famous ‘Seven-Mile Beach’ and I’m sure that Rod and I will attempt to pick up from where we last left off in 2020. A daily morning stroll north from the centrally located TreeHouse out to Points Village just beyond the notorious Hedonism II is a spectacular way to start any day …. or of equal interest and fitness benefit is a spritely trek along the southern stretch down to where the beach ends at the Negril River just past the craft market. I am sure that the white sand beach and the warm azure waters of the Caribbean will be as they have always been but what about the hotels, restaurants and bars? … and most importantly what about the people? Are the locals still the laid back, happy gentle folks who are genuinely at peace with the world and happy to share that feeling. And are the visitors who have arrived from countries scattered across the globe still finding and sharing that special ‘IRIE’ feeling that has been such an integral part of Negril?\n\nOur back garden room at the Negril TreeHouse\n\nFollow-up report to follow!\n\nThe most common question I am asked about my Jamaican experience and memories is “What is it that made Jamaica so appealing to you and why do you continue to think, talk, dream and write about it?”\n\nOne of my most read and commented on ‘Memories of Jamaica’ stories was ‘How Success Ruined My Business’ … below is a brief introduction which should provide a little background to that story and perhaps shed a little light on the question above followed by a reprint of ‘How Success Ruined My Business’\n\nIntroduction: ‘Jamaica No Problem’ … ‘Jamaica No Planning’\n\nTo most people the popular Jamaican motto ‘Jamaica No Problem’ is understood to be a lifestyle reference. Although that was certainly true at the time I arrived on the scene it meant much more to me – I knew it was also the unspoken but prevailing national business strategy. There was also another directly related unspoken lifestyle and business strategy very much in play in the country: ‘Jamaica No Planning’. I had no problem accepting both concepts and went about my business pursuits fully in synch with those two easy to work with standards.\n\nWhen Canadian entrepreneur Gerry Dean decided, during his first visit to Jamaica that since there were no baseball hats to be found as souvenirs anywhere in the country he should set up a baseball hat manufacturing operation on the island, all he had going for him was that he knew someone who had a history of setting up small baseball hat manufacturing operations in Canada. He was also well aware that the individual he had in mind to set up and run the operation was more than willing to leave a tenuous financial situation behind and get out of a financially depressed and personally depressing Canada as quickly as possible. Based on a whimsically vague concept and virtually no planning I agreed to escape to Jamaica to make baseball hats.\n\nAfter struggling unsuccessfully through a painful recession in Canada that ultimately led to the demise of what was left of the rapidly shrinking Canadian garment industry I was pleasantly surprised to be magically transported to a simpler time and place which was nothing like the horrendous abyss I was suffocating in. I was being delivered into a land where there were no local experts, nobody wanting to make final decisions, no one who wanted to be responsible for planning and no one who wanted to be held accountable for anything that might go wrong. Everyone seemed to be wanting to happily get along, agreeably go along and peacefully belong to anything that happened to be working out ok at the time … Jamaica No Problem! It was heavenly and I was a perfect fit … it had become painfully obvious to me, and the bankers in Canada, that although I had plenty of creative ideas, and could get the ball rolling on new ventures, I wasn’t very good at long-term planning … I was also more than ready and willing to join the ‘No Problem’ approach to doing business.\n\nA Shared Misconception\n\nWhen Britain, under crippling financial pressure at home, was forced to divest itself of its’ dependant colonies it was Jamaica’s turn to be cut free (deserted) in the early 1960s. Presented sheepishly to the world by the English as ‘earned independence’ the pathetic transfer of responsibility from a financially broken motherland to a totally unprepared island of benevolent office clerks and sugarcane workers was a strangely melancholy affair … neither side emotionally wanted the break-up but both tried to convince themselves that they were doing the best thing for themselves and their former partner and that everything would work out and be better for all involved. It was the start of Jamaica’s slow but inevitable slide deeper into Third World status. The early generation of Jamaica parliamentarians were judged on their ability to politely ask for and graciously accept handouts from other more financial secure countries and international aid programs.\n\nFumbling along an unpaved path to nowhere in particular based on nothing more than reactionary expediency Jamaica, by the mid 1970s, found itself very much under the philosophic influence of its quasi-communist Cuban neighbours. It hadn’t been planned that way because Jamaica was far too busy simply trying to make it to the end of the next month – there was no time or ability for any long-term planning when it was a daily struggle to keep the lights on, the water running through the pipes and finding enough gas to keep the country moving. Cuba’s brief period as spiritual leader was abruptly brought to an end by Jamaica’s next benefactor – the United States of America – whose hubris demanded that they defend democracy and capitalism throughout the world and most certainly on a misguided American-speaking tropical island less than two hours away by direct flight. They made an offer that could not and would not be refused – they would provide much-needed financial salvation. And thus the stage was set for my entrance and completely unscripted performance … improvisational theatre at its finest.\n\nDuring the mating dance with our prospective Jamaican suitors Gerry and I attended an American Government funded ‘Joint Venture’ conference at a luxury resort on the northcoast of the island. We made it our business to be noticed and were irrevocably successful – for years afterwards I would be approached by complete strangers in the Jamaican government buildings in Kingston and at random locations across the country who would start up a conversation with “Didn’t we meet at the Joint Venture conference at Rosehall?” But of more importance to my later ventures I did meet and make a point of remembering the members of the official Jamaican representatives at the conference … I surmised correctly that they might be of value to me at some point in the future. Perhaps the most significant relationship I initiated at the conference was with Dr. Paul Roberston who was about my age, had graduated from the University of Michigan, had been Prime Minister Michael Manley’s secretary and was the Secretary General of Jamaica’s Peoples’ National Party (PNP). We initially talked about Detroit sports teams which was a treat for him because very few, if any, Jamaicans have any interest or knowledge about the Red Wings, Tigers and Lions.\n\nSeveral months later, after I had agreed to set up a hat factory in the dusty urban slums of West Kingston for the Desulme family, Dr. Roberston unexpectantly re-entered my life. It was early December, and the Kingston Christmas social season was in full swing. I was the new Canadian consultant in town and my employer, Yvon Desulme, was delighted to show me off to his friends and business acquaintances … I was presented as an expert from afar, the owner of numerous Canadian garment manufacturing entities, who, as part of the ‘JNIP Joint Venture Project’ was coming to Jamaica to help provide the United States funded/promised financial salvation. My new role was that of the successful business savvy industrialist coming to share and spread knowledge, experience and direction … I would make decisions, I would take responsibility, I would accept accountability – whatever it took was alright with me, I was also looking for financial salvation.\n\nMy introductory social event, held in the lavish ballroom of the upscale Pegasus Hotel in New Kingston, was the PNP’s official Christmas gathering – by invitation only. Yvon Desulme was a major party donor and known and respected by all in attendance … during that period he was helping to keep the almost always financially underfunded party alive which earned him more than a little respect during those difficult times when the party was out of power and languishing in Opposition in the Jamaican Parliament. There was a reception line at the entrance which included such party stalwarts as Michael Manley, a former and future Jamaican Prime Minister, PJ Patterson another future PNP Prime Minister (served for 14-years) and Ms. Portia Simpson who would eventually succeed Paterson as Prime Minister and serve for 5-years. After being spotted and captured by Dr. Robertson he personally introduced me to the row of dignitaries as his find/friend from Canada – with emphasis on the ‘from Canada part’. I danced with the wives, drank with the husbands and was as entertaining as any very important consultant could possibly be without acting like an American. It was early in the American salvation project, but they had already worn out their welcome – it had quickly become a relationship of mutual tolerance.\n\nFor the first three weeks of that glorious December I was a much sought after party guest. The Jamaicans I met at these gatherings of the top political and business leaders were wonderful happy people who had their priorities firmly in ‘No Problem’ mode which apparently included the ‘No Planning’ aspect. They were more than content to leave the planning, decision making, worrying , and most importantly, the bill paying to the English, the Cubans, the Americans or whoever else might want to get involved. I felt very much at home with this group and was secretly envious of their lifestyle … I also wanted someone to pay my bills. My heavy social schedule turned out to be my training camp for dealing with Jamaicans. I learned that it is a small country and everybody knows or knows of most of the business and government type people, important and/or interesting, across the island so name dropping and heaping praise on other Jamaicans I had met along the way or was doing business with was an easy way to become a welcomed new acquaintance. It was great for business and a very pleasant/easy going existence … I really enjoyed being treated as someone who was important and/or interesting.\n\nMy little hat factory in West Kingston did not have more than an infinitesimal, fleeting effect on the financial salvation of Jamaica. At that time the country’s garment industry lacked any sense of preventative maintenance, had a chronic shortage of spare parts and a paralyzing shortage of tools and equipment ( where there was a hammer there was no nails and where there were screws there was, invariably, the wrong screwdriver). Incredibly there was not a supplier of sewing machine needles or thread in Jamaica and no foreign supplier would ship to the country until they were paid fully in advance in American dollars? The available sewing equipment was not up to minimum standards to be competitively productive on the international level and although Jamaican sewers truly believed that they were hardworking, dedicated workers, they weren’t. What eventually saved the Jamaican garment industry was the next wave of international opportunists – in this case the South Koreans who were looking for a backdoor method of exporting finished textile goods into the United States. Turned out that by joint venturing with the Jamaican companies who were joint venturing with American and Canadian companies the Koreans could get around the American quota system as it applied to Korean goods going into the United States.\n\nIt wasn’t until a steady flow of experienced well funded visionary external operators arrived in Jamaica and developed the lucrative international Tourism Industry (more ‘Joint Ventures’) that the country finally gained a semblance of financial stability which was being supported internally by the next generation of clever, aggressive young Jamaicans who were educated abroad and returned home prepared to make decisions, become the managers, take responsibility, accept accountability, offer new ideas and direction and, most importantly, at least try to pay some of the bills.\n\nHow Success Ruined my Business\n\nHaving too much cash, an over productive sales staff and too many clients would seem to be enviable problems for most business operators. How could too much cash ever be a problem? An over-achieving sales team is the envy of every sales and marketing company. And surely no company can ever have too many clients? Problems like that should be a pleasure to deal with. Well not really, especially if the cash is the wrong kind, the sales staff is too efficient and the clients are impossible to satisfy. Let me try to explain.\n\nWhen I started up my magazine business in Jamaica I didn’t have any clients, no salespeople and like any other new business hadn’t yet started to generate a cash flow. It took almost five years for my problem to reach the point where I was forced to abandon my business and drop completely out of sight. It came on gradually at first, picked up momentum through years two and three and then spiraled out of control in year four. I could feel it slowly developing and then picking up more and more momentum. As I did more and more business, took in more and more money, and had more and more people calling me for my time and attention I could feel myself slowly slipping into a completely uncontrollable situation. I was becoming someone and something that I didn’t feel right about. I had reached the point where it was getting very difficult to differentiate between who and what I was in Jamaica and who I really was back home in Canada. One night at a Jamaican Tourist Board reception in Ocho Rios as I was talking to the Minister of Tourism and a former Prime Minister, I suddenly realized that I couldn’t remember when I had most recently arrived or when I was next scheduled to leave.\n\nTo get my magazine started I had personally called on mainly small tourist related businesses in the four main tourist areas of Jamaica; Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, Port Antonio and Negril. My very simple goal was to sell enough advertising space in my quarterly publication, ‘Jamaica Today’ to cover all the related expenses and ultimately generate a little profit. I truly believed in the value of what I was trying to do for my clients. My enthusiasm was genuine, and it must have been infectious, because they responded positively. In many instances my satisfied clients provided valuable referrals. The first three or four editions lost money although in decreasing amounts. Editions five through nine broke about even and with edition ten we started to turn a small profit. However, by edition ten the amount of money being generated by advertising sales in the magazine was becoming a problem … I had far too much Jamaican cash ??\n\nBy that point I had acquired four local salesgirls who were doing an incredibly good job. They had figured out how to effectively sell advertising space. The more they sold the more cash they generated for themselves and for me. As the magazine continued to grow in the number of pages so did the related costs. The clients asked for better paper quality – so they got it at a price. The clients asked for better colour quality – so they got it at a price. The better the magazine looked the more demanding the clients became. The advertisers in Negril wanted their advertising at the front of the magazine and more supporting editorial. The advertisers in Montego Bay wanted their advertising at the front of the magazine and more supporting editorial. The advertisers in Ocho Rios wanted… The advertisers in Port Antonio wanted… and the salesgirls needed better cameras and better cell phones and better picture quality for their ads and… and…and …and. Each girl also wanted her area to be at the front of the magazine and more importantly each wanted/needed more advertising space to sell. I had limited the number of pages each girl could sell to keep the magazine’s editorial-advertising ratio in balance and to keep the size and weight of the magazine from becoming prohibitively expensive to produce and ship. Then in the fall of 1990 the sales staff collectively informed me that they had decided that ‘Jamaica Today’ should evolve into four separate regional magazines. The advertisers and the Jamaican Tourist Board agreed with the salesgirls. And I knew full well that these very aggressive sales ladies (no longer girls) could each easily sell enough advertising to fill their respective regional editions. Based on these developments most business types would have certainly concluded that my original magazine concept had been a success and that four successful regional editions would be even more successful – and everyone involved would be even happier! At that point I had more than enough clients, and potential clients, to fill four separate magazines.\n\nHaving a well-connected Jamaican business partner afforded me some tremendous advantages over most new start up businesses. He was able to take care of all the banking, legal and government requirements and get all the paperwork and licenses in place. From the start I was able to legally collect my money, put it in my company bank account, write cheques on the account and draw cash out at any Royal Bank branch in Jamaica. While that might seem pretty routine to anyone living and doing business in Canada the USA or England it wasn’t quite that easy for most foreign business owners in Jamaica at that time and things were quickly and dramatically changing. When I first arrived in Jamaica in the official exchange rate of the Jamaica dollar was – one USA dollar could be exchanged for three Jamaica dollars. Five years later the exchange rate had fallen to where one USA dollar could be exchanged for almost thirty Jamaican dollars. Any Jamaican who came across USA dollars was reluctant to part with them – including the Bank of Jamaica. Another cruel little local restriction was added to the game – it became illegal for Jamaicans to have USA dollars (they were required by law to exchange any USA dollars they received at the Bank of Jamaica). Visitors to Jamaica were required to exchange their money for Jamaican dollars at the airport or at an official government exchange location. All transactions in Jamaica were required to be done in J$s. More importantly to me was the law that made it illegal to take Jamaican money out of Jamaica. According to the new Jamaican regulations I couldn’t collect payment for my advertising space in USA dollars and I couldn’t take J$s out of the country. By the spring of year three I would routinely have well over six hundred and fifty thousand dollars in my Jamaican bank account. The dull constant pain in my stomach got steadily worse as the exchange rate continued to rise. Are you starting to understand my problem?\n\nAs my sales ladies and clients waited for me to officially announce that’ Jamaica Today’ would begin publishing four regional editions starting with the Fall year four edition I was facing a serious cash flow problem back in Canada. My London, Ontario based printer had been extremely patient about when I paid him as was my colour separation guy. Both knew that my magazine was growing rapidly and could easily expand but neither understood my growing cash flow problem. As a result of Jamaica’s bizarre currency exchange regulations I was being forced into smuggling money out of the country – some in illegally converted USA and Canadian currency but most of it in the very pretty but pretty much valueless Jamaica flavor. By the time I exchanged the Jamaican cash into Canadian dollars at the Royal Bank exchange office at the Toronto airport I was getting barely one dollar Canadian for sixty dollars Jamaican. It wasn’t as if I had a choice of banks to deal with – the Royal Bank money exchange kiosk in the departures area of the Toronto airport was the one and only place in Canada where I could exchange Jamaican money (they liked to have a little on hand for departing Canadians travelling to Jamaica). My six hundred and fifty thousand Jamaican dollars at a twenty-to-one exchange rate was worth over thirty-two thousand Canadian dollars but at thirty -to-one it dropped to twenty-one thousand Canadian. The Toronto Airport RBC rate reduced to down to less than eleven thousand. I was a client of the Royal Bank in both Canada and Jamaica but they still couldn’t give me a reasonable rate. As bad as the exchange debacle was it wasn’t the most troubling aspect of my money handling problem.\n\nBy far the worst part of my torture was having to physically smuggle the money out of Jamaica and then into Canada. I was flying back and forth to Jamaica about every three to four weeks. My regular cycle included selling trips, delivery of the new edition trips and collection of money trips. There was an overlap of the three functions on most trips depending on the time of year. It was easy enough to collect and deposit my clients’ cheques anywhere on the island but to make a large withdrawal I had to go to the main Royal Bank branch in New Kingston. The largest denomination of the Jamaica currency at the time was a twenty-dollar bill. At the twenty-to-one exchange rate to take out the equivalent of ten thousand dollars Canadian meant receiving ten thousand Jamaican twenty-dollar bills. At the thirty-to-one rate I had to pick up and smuggle fifteen thousand Jamaican twenty-dollar bills. Just counting it took about half an hour. That was literally a (big) bag full of money.\n\nOne of the government monetary regulations unequivocally stated that Jamaican money couldn’t be taken out of the country so foreign visitors were allowed/required to exchange their leftover Jamaican dollars prior to their departure. There were money exchange counters in the departures area of both the Montego Bay and Kingston airports which I frequented much too often. Part of that exchange procedure involved turning in the original exchange slip you received when you had arrived and exchanged Canadian or American dollars into the pretty Jamaican flavor.\n\nLet me try to explain how my money exchange operation worked. To exchange money at the official Bank of Jamaica money exchange counter in the departure areas of the two international airports in Montego Bay and Kingston there were three things that you required. One: an airline ticket showing that you were in fact departing the country. Two: a stamped Bank of Jamaica exchange slip proving that you had previously exchanged a specific amount of foreign currency into Jamaica dollars. These exchange slips would show where, when and how much money and at what rate of exchange your transactions had involved. These transactions would have taken place at a hotel, restaurant, exchange kiosk or bank somewhere in Jamaica Three: the amount of Jamaican currency being exchanged could not be greater than the total amount shown on your exchange slips. After providing these required components to the smiling Jamaica exchange teller you would receive your Canadian or American cash at the rate of exchange indicated on the slips. For me having the money was the easiest part, having an airline ticket was also no problem but having the required stamped exchange slip(s) presented my greatest ongoing challenge. Initially I would routinely exchange money at various locations around the country and then make minor changes to the amounts shown on the exchange slips but as the amount I wanted to exchange increased I had to become more creative. For a pair of size twelve Adidas running shoes I was able to procure my own exchange book and government issued stamp which solved that nasty little piece of the puzzle. (I think I officially became a criminal at that point). Then to get my paperwork in order for my next exchange I would fill in the amount on the exchange slip to show that I had exchanged around forty-five hundred USA dollars. I would carefully date the slip to show that the transaction had taken place within the previous week to ten days. On the day of my flight I would dress like a typical departing tourist go to the Montego Bay airport and do my best to become just another faceless departing visitor. When I heard my flight being announced and the first boarding call I would casually walk over to the exchange counter and place my carefully stamped and dated exchange slip on the counter along with my airline ticket and the exact amount of Jamaican cash. Invariably the young woman, or man, would ask me for my ID and ask me why I had so much Jamaican money. I would tell them a story about how I was the treasurer for a group of Canadian travelers who had come to Jamaica to go deep sea fishing and how the boat we were supposed to be going out on hadn’t been available so as it turned out we didn’t get to go fishing after all. The Jamaican clerk would then scramble around to get me my Canadian cash. I always flew Air Canada because the flight back to Toronto would also make a short stop in Kingston to pick up additional passengers. Once on board I would tell the head stewardess that I needed to run into the departures area of the Kingston airport because I had forgotten to exchange my Jamaican money or that I had arrived too late to do it in Montego Bay or that they had run out of Canadian cash. Invariably they wouldn’t have any problem with me doing so as long as I promised to make it quick and not go anywhere other than the departures area. Upon landing in Kingston I would then run breathlessly, for effect, into the departure area, go up to the exchange counter, repeat my fish story and exchange another forty-five hundred dollars worth. Each time I did my exchange routine I expected to be caught and hauled off to a jail in east Kingston. I started to suspect that the clerks at the exchange counters would remember me from my last trip or that someone would look a little too closely at my exchange slip and notice that the numbers were from an earlier period. On one very uncomfortable occasion in Montego Bay a young clerk obviously suspecting something was amiss had tried to phone the hotel named on the exchange slip to verify that I had actually exchanged that amount of money at that hotel – fortunately, but not surprisingly, he couldn’t get through to the hotel because the phone number was out of order. Warm sticky sweat was running down the inside of my legs and my "
