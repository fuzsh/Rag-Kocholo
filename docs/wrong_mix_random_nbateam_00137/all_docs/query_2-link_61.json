He wrote these memoirs in secret in the spring of 1982, and his family discovered the manuscript after his death in 2014. They are published here as they were found, without amendment or correction. Some discrepancies or inconsistencies have been acknowledged through notes to the text. Interspersed among the chapters of the memoir are analytical chapters written by Thomas J. Christensen, a professor at Columbia University, an expert in Sino-American relations, and a former senior state department oﬃcial responsible for policy toward China. These chapters trace global politics and diplomacy during the Cold War, and they explore just how Jack Downey came to be the longest-held prisoner of war in American history. The book closes with an afterword from Jack Downey’s son, Jack Lee Downey.\n\nLOST IN THE COLD WAR\n\n1 A PERFECT AMBUSH\n\nW\n\nE H A D a bomber’s moon, and the landscape below was bathed in a ﬂood of light that made it featureless. The great, conical bulk of the Forever White Mountain (Changbai Shan) loomed out of this ether as our plane, an unmarked, ﬁxed-wing propeller-driven Douglas C-47, reached the northern ﬁnger of North Korea that points toward the Soviet seaport of Vladivostok. The snow-covered volcano seemed to be larger than the sky. We turned ninety degrees to the left heading west. Our crossing of the border into the territory of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) went undetected and we headed for the predesignated drop zone. A few minutes after midnight we spotted our Chinese agents’ signal, three ﬁres in single ﬁle. For the ﬁrst time since we had taken oﬀ from Seoul, South Korea, I began to feel tense. Our pilots, Bob Snoddy and Norman Schwartz, turned the plane straight at the ﬁres. Dick Fecteau and I grabbed the supply bundle and manhandled it past the winch, which was bolted to the cargo door. We watched the supply parachute open and drift toward the ﬁres. We swung north to make a wide circle while the agents retrieved the bundle and assembled the pickup poles and ropes. Our loop carried us near the Manchurian city of Forever Spring (Chang Chun). We saw its lights in the distance and, as we drew closer, whole swathes of its brightness\n\n2\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\nabruptly blinked out. Apparently, we had been detected now. Within a minute or two, the entire city had hidden itself in darkness, afraid of our tiny presence. At one o’clock we reapproached the drop zone. As planned, I took a length of rope attached to my parachute harness and tied the loose end to a metal brace inside the cargo area. The rope was to be my lifeline in case I should slip from the door opening while thrusting the hook pole into its sleeve outside the fuselage. Because of the rope, I wore only a reserve parachute on my chest. I reminded myself the reserve chute ripcord did not pull automatically. I felt for the ripcord ring to memorize its position, just in case I would have to bail out. We made one pass over the drop zone, straining to see any activity on the ground. We saw nothing but the signal ﬁres telling us all was in order. We circled one last time and descended for the pickup. Snoddy and Schwartz straightened their course and the C-47 swayed from side to side as they ﬂattened its path for the retrieval, Fecteau crouched at the winch. We had worried that the engine might not start after four hours exposed to the frigid air, but it coughed then caught. I stood over Fecteau, pole in hand. The cold wind raced past the cargo door. We were thirty feet above the ground, and we could see that it was covered with light snow. An electric bell, the pilot’s ready signal, rang insistently. I leaned out into the wind and slammed the pole into position and locked it into the sleeve with a twist. I looked for the colonel and thought I saw him, hunched between the tether poles. We hit the rope and lurched upward. At the same instant, the darkness was broken by ﬂashes of gunﬁre. There was no mistaking it, even though the roar of wind and engine drowned out the reports of riﬂes and machine guns.1 I knew we were being ﬁred on because tracer bullets punctured the fuselage and ﬂew by my face like tiny comets. I stood mesmerized as they came through the ﬂoor, through the door, and through the sides of the plane. I didn’t think to move. It ﬂashed through my mind that I hadn’t been to confession and I was conscious that my groin felt terribly exposed. Suddenly, I sensed the C-47 had ceased climbing. It hung in midair and shuddered, a clumsy bird stricken at its moment of greatest striving. I felt the nose dipping then leveling. I fell toward into the sleeping bags and blankets behind the pilot’s cabin. Stumbling, I called\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\n3\n\nout for Bob and Norm, there was no response, only the sounds of the plane crashing through the woods. I couldn’t tell when the plane hit the ground or why it didn’t cartwheel. I only knew the battering and noise stopped and that we were no longer moving. A sheet of ﬂame quivered like an orange, red and blue waterfall in front of me. I must have stood and moved, for the next moment I was outside the plane. I tried to move away and was brought up short. Fecteau appeared at my side and helped me slip out of my harness. Together we stumbled toward a stand of young trees, where we tried to get our bearings. The nose of the plane rested against the base of a small hill. Snoddy and Schwartz were nowhere to be found. I knew the gunﬁre had been concentrated on the cockpit, and there seemed little chance they could still be alive. I wondered whether our crash landing was luck, or if one of them had died a hero, bringing the plane in level and switching oﬀ the engine to prevent an explosion. Through the trees, I saw a stream. “What do we do?” “I dunno—follow the stream down to the Yalu?” At that moment we saw a single Chinese soldier emerge from the woods near the burning C-47. He carried a riﬂe and aimed at us as he approached and shouted a single, harsh syllable. I reached for my revolver as Fecteau and I edged out of the trees and into the clearing. As the soldier moved toward us, others began to appear from all directions at once. I knew immediately that resistance was useless. I dropped the revolver and raised my hands over my head. We were led into the ﬂickering light cast by the burning C-47. Without warning, an oﬃcer stepped forward and struck Fecteau across the face. It seemed to have no impact. It was only a sound swallowed by the night. We were searched, and our hands were tied behind our backs. I wondered whether they would shoot us then and there but assured myself it was more likely that they would take us somewhere for interrogation. Soon the order was given to move out. We left the plane burning and walked away in single ﬁle. I had come to the Far East for adventure, but now I had more than I bargained for. Later, when I remembered the crash, one frightening thought stood out among the rest. It wasn’t the tracer bullets or the\n\n4\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\nride through the treetops or the ﬁre. It was the lifeline. What if the plane had gained more altitude after being hit and I had tried to bail out? I would have jumped and fallen only the length of my lifeline. Then I would have dangled, watching the ground rush toward me and waiting for the plane to crash on top of me. Two years of merciless interrogations, leg irons, solitary conﬁnement in a 5ʹ by 8ʹ empty cell, and three thousand pages of written confession later, I ﬁnd myself standing in line with the other defendants in a military courtroom. “Be still,” I commanded myself. “Don’t let them see the trembling. They will take it as a sign of fear.” Perhaps it was fear. But I told myself I was shaking from pain. For weeks I had an infected toe and the Peking2 prison treatment of antiseptic applied with soiled cotton had done nothing to cure the inﬂammation, which now was raging so badly it hurt to stand. I tried to hide my shaking inside my baggy prison uniform, and when the court called me forward to identify myself, the conﬁdent tone I intended emerged as a near shout. “John Downey, New Britain, Connecticut, United States of America,” I declared. The tribunal of judges in military uniforms stared sternly down from their high rostrum. Along the opposite wall, a hundred Communist Party oﬃcials were grinning, evidently pleased to be the privileged witnesses to the sentencing of a pair of American CIA agents and their Chinese collaborators. We stood in a long row before the judges. The nine Chinese defendants, all former army oﬃcers whom we had recruited after they ﬂed the Communist revolution, had parachuted into the Manchurian mountains in the summer of 1952. The Korean War was stalemated and we hoped our guerrillas would ﬁnd support for a counter-revolution, though we had been able to ﬁnd little evidence such support existed. Dick Fecteau and I had been ambushed on a nighttime rendezvous with the guerrillas. The C-47 we were ﬂying in was brought down by two anti-aircraft 50’s and small arms ﬁre. The two pilots had been killed in the crash landing and Fecteau and I were captured. That was at midnight of November 29, 1952. Now it was two years later, the war had ended, but we did not know it, and neither our families nor our government knew we were still alive. For two years the Communists had held us in isolation, each in solitary conﬁnement so strict\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\n5\n\nthat for months we were allowed to stand only to be fed or to go to the toilet or to be questioned. The interrogation lasted eighteen months, and its conclusion with coerced confessions of “crimes against the people of China,” had led to a trial and now this sentencing. As I stood before the judges, I tried to prepare myself for the worst. I knew the Chinese regarded us as spies, not prisoners of war, yet I was convinced they had to consider the diplomatic consequences of our imprisonment. On the basis of nothing but my own conjecture, I assumed that our release could be negotiated. But even another year in prison was unpleasant to contemplate. Five years would be an ordeal I hoped I could ﬁnd the strength to endure. I was only twentyfour years old, a middle-class college kid who had been willing to risk death in a war against Communist aggressors, but not to watch his life slip away day by day in a prison cell whose sole furnishings were a nine-inch high plank bed and a chamber pot, where boiled vegetables were the main diet, where the only visitors were lice and maggots, where there was nothing to read except propaganda tracts, and where there was no one to talk to except interpreters who used their broken English relentlessly to reform my errant imperialist mind. Ten years under such conditions would be impossible. It would be the same as death. Beyond ten years, I could not think. While I played this dire numbers game and tried to cope with my throbbing toe, I listened to the solemn drone of the court proceedings. Only statements deemed pertinent to Fecteau and me were translated into English. Occasionally our names bobbed up in the stream of Chinese. My name was pronounced Tahn-nye and Fecteau’s was Fe-ke-toe. Suddenly, I realized the preliminary speeches were over. The center judge of the tribunal ﬁxed his eyes on the Chinese agent at the farthest end of our row. He pronounced the sentence and it was repeated in English. “Life.” I had no time to conjure the implication of the sentence before the judge turned to the next agent in line. He also got life. I felt as though I had been clubbed from behind. I retained enough of my wits to hear the third agent, who was a radio operator, receive twenty years. The severity began to sink in. A few minutes before, a ten-year sentence seemed inconceivable. Now ten years seemed a slap on the wrist. The judge addressed another agent. He got life. And the next? Death. Inwardly, I staggered again. I heard\n\n6\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\nanother death sentence, perhaps two more deaths, when I realized the judge had arrived at Fecteau. During our trial, defense attorneys for the Chinese agents had argued that they were the dupes of the “American Imperialists,” that I was the real criminal and that Dick was my chief accomplice. The judge pronounced the sentence, Fecteau got twenty years. Immediately, I knew my sentence would be more severe. I would either be condemned to life in prison or death. The judge was now looking in my direction. I concentrated on holding myself steady; I was too ﬂooded with sensation to feel normal fright. Every nerve in my body blazed with electric ﬁre. I looked at life and death, and I braced myself. The interpreter listened to the Judge speak. I held my breath. “Life.” Life imprisonment was the punishment ordered by the court. I exhaled, and my body drained with relief. I became aware again of my throbbing toe. The command was given to leave the courtroom. We pivoted to the right and marched out. I did not have the chance to see the reaction on any of the Chinese agents’ faces. Once we were outside the courtroom, Fecteau and I were led into a small antechamber where we were told to sit on the ﬂoor. Fecteau was black with bitterness. “Well, it looks like my wife will die childless,” he said. “I don’t believe it,” I answered, my voice surprisingly high. “New Year’s amnesty.” I was grasping for straws of hope, trying to retrieve a future. “There’s no way I’m spending twenty years here,” said Fecteau, as if anger could alter his sentence. We knew talking was forbidden, but when a guard gestured for silence, Dick swore at him viciously. He had nothing left to lose. The guard jabbed his hand at a wall clock. My overheated imagination leaped to a conclusion. “It’s bugged!” I hissed at Fecteau. He looked at me oddly. Moments later, we were separated for the return trip. Back in my cell that evening, the jagged emotions I had felt at the sentencing ﬂattened to the lowest despair ever. I felt as if a granite slab had been laid across my heart. I was not thankful for having been spared a death sentence. All I could think was that my life would never be my own. I imagined a stooped, white-haired American,\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\n7\n\nshuﬄing about the prison corridors, doing menial chores and speaking a pidgin tongue to guards one-third his age, all the way into the next century. They would regard him as a curious relic from a time they learned about in history class. He would be too inﬁrm in body or in spirit to pose any escape threat. The image was so vivid. The old man seemed to be standing there in my cell. I prayed I would not become that old man, but even if I didn’t and my sentence were commuted, it seemed likely I would be locked up for years. My youth would be taken from me and I could not imagine what good the rest of my life would be. I must have looked as bad as I felt, because a guard was posted at the window to my cell and he stayed there all night. My jailers may have worried that I would try to kill myself. The thought did cross my mind. But I had been raised to believe suicide was the ultimate sin. Even in that deepest despair I could not consider suicide seriously. The guard’s passive face was the last thing I saw before I fell asleep. The clanging prison bell woke me the next morning and before long the sun was shining and some of my optimism returned. I began to think less of the hopelessness of a “life sentence,” and more of what hope remained to me. My release still might be negotiated, if not soon, then in a year or two. A few years seemed nothing now. Perhaps there would be an amnesty or a change in the Chinese government. I was occupied with such musings when the interpreter came to my cell. I noticed he was thin and pale, obviously a member of the upper class, who, before the revolution, had been sent abroad to be cured of tuberculosis. Despite his lost privilege, he embraced Communism zealously and his inbred arrogance was now overlaid with political piety, an unattractive combination. He was gloating as he spoke to me. “What did you think of your sentence?” he asked. I told him I thought it was severe, much tougher than I expected. I didn’t expect any sympathy from him and I didn’t get any. “You could have been sentenced to death,” he said, suggesting he personally thought the court had been merciful. Then he went on, “Of course, you understand there is no hope for any reduction in your sentence, or any chance of appeal. But there are ways you can help yourself. Your conditions can change.”\n\n8\n\nA P ERF EC T A MBUSH\n\nHe was still gloating, but he had told me more than he had intended, and I was elated. After two years of interrogation, I had become experienced at fencing with interpreters, and I knew most of their psychological feints and thrusts. If this fellow threatened that there was no hope for an early release, it could only mean that there was. As for what he said about better conditions, I took that to mean that if I behaved myself and answered whatever questions the Chinese might have left to ask me, I could get better food or other minor prison amenities. But at that moment I was immune to such pompous wheedling. “Look, if you’ve got questions, I’ll answer them,” I told the interpreter. “But not because I want any favors from you. The only thing I want is to be left alone.” If I was going to spend one more year, or ﬁfty, in their prison, I’d be damned if I would give the Chinese the opportunity to pretend they were humanitarian captors. I’d shut myself away from them. My own prison would be far tighter than any they could ever provide.\n\n2 AN AMERICAN HERO ON A FOOL’S MISSION Thomas J. Christensen\n\nJ\n\nOHN T. DOW NE Y was an American hero. He was brave and daring, steadfast and loyal. In November 1952, as a CIA oﬃcer during the Korean War, he willingly, almost eagerly, put himself in extreme danger. Along with three American colleagues, he entered enemy airspace in Northeast China. Their mission was to recover a Chinese agent who had been inserted there earlier to gain intelligence, sow political discord, and weaken the Chinese war eﬀort. Downey had volunteered the year before while still an undergraduate at Yale, committing himself to become a paramilitary oﬃcer for the CIA, a new branch that was just four years old at the time. Although he was technically not a soldier, he trained like one with elite forces in Fort Benning, Georgia. And though he was not a soldier, most soldiers do not face the sort of danger that Downey and his three colleagues rather cheerfully accepted on that fateful November day. Downey’s faith in his nation endured across his twenty-one years of incarceration in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The CIAauthorized history of his ordeal appropriately called his dedication “extraordinary ﬁdelity.”1 It was only the historic trips to China by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon in 1971 and 1972 that would change the geostrategic calculus of\n\n10\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nU.S.-China relations suﬃciently to secure the release of Downey and his colleague Richard Fecteau, the only survivors of that 1952 mission. From the Nixon breakthrough until the end of the Cold War, the United States and the PRC entered into a loose partnership to counter their common Soviet enemy. In that new environment, Fecteau was released in 1971 and Downey in 1973. Not only was Downey’s spirit unbroken, but upon his release he rather quickly put his harrowing experience behind him, enrolled in Harvard Law School, started a family, and eventually became a judge in his home state of Connecticut. His dedication after his release is all the more remarkable because he had every reason to be bitter at his own government. The mission that stranded him in Manchuria was quixotic in the extreme. The four of them—Downey, Fecteau, and two American pilots—had been sent to scoop up an anticommunist Chinese agent using a recovery system by which a passing plane would catch a line tied to the agent and yank him skyward. To label Downey and Fecteau’s involvement in the mission a mistake would be an insult to mistakes. Neither had any useful language training nor any relevant education on the politics, history, or geography of mainland China. Neither was Chinese, so they would stick out like a sore thumb if their plane were to crash, which it did. And if they were captured, they both knew far too much as CIA case oﬃcers to maintain the plausible deniability of ignorance under coercion. They were indeed shot down. The pilots were killed in the crash, and Downey and Fecteau were ambushed at the pickup point by Chinese forces. Two technicians were initially assigned the mission of exﬁltrating the Chinese operative, which made sense. They would have been better trained with the equipment than Downey and Fecteau, and they would not have known the details of CIA training missions in China; therefore, their capture would have carried fewer national security risks. They might also have had a better chance of being released along with U.S. prisoners of war from the conﬂict in Korea. Downey writes that he had ﬂown into China once before in October for a less dangerous resupply mission. He had maneuvered himself as a volunteer on that mission out of a simple desire for adventure. He also suggested that this action was a violation of the rules for CIA case oﬃcers\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n11\n\nA Douglas-C-47 Skytrain with a hook for snatch pickups.\n\nﬂying over China. He and his commanding oﬃcer were concerned that his participation might be discovered. In Downey’s recollection, two Chinese nationals were considered for the task but ultimately rejected. But the former CIA historian Nicholas Dujmovic writes that it was actually the two American technicians who were initially assigned to the ﬂight but their security clearances were deemed insuﬃcient. Downey and Fecteau, with the highest level of clearance—which carried with it much more valuable operational knowledge for the Chinese government to extract and a very clear designation as spies—were ordered on the ﬂight in their stead. In a sense, then, the technicians knew too little to be sent into harm’s way, but Downey and Fecteau, in retrospect, knew far too much.2 Supporting this account of a last-minute change, one history\n\n12\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nof the airlifts into China said that they were trained “hurriedly” in how to operate the recovery system, which had recently been used to rescue downed pilots in North Korea.3 Is it too harsh to judge the decisions that led to their capture as foolish? Even the CIA seems to think they were. Since that 1952 operation, no American oﬃcers were again sent into the airspace over communist China on paramilitary intelligence operations,4 even though the CIA continued to involve itself in paramilitary operations in China for years through foreign proxies, mostly ethnic Chinese and Tibetan insurgents battling China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Therefore, it was not indiﬀerence regarding the target or abandonment of paramilitary methods altogether that led to the change. Rather, it seems that the CIA well understood its blunder and would not repeat it during the next two decades in which China remained a hostile Cold War enemy. Instead of bitterness, Jack Downey expressed sorrow for his immediate boss, whom he was sure carried a terrible burden for having ordered the mission.5 ✴ ✴ ✴\n\nThe paramilitary and intelligence operations of the early Korean War were plagued by problems: poorly trained personnel, weak intelligence about mainland China, the manipulation of the U.S. government by anticommunist Chinese citizens who were collaborating with American oﬃcials in Asia, and the pressing need to take some action, however risky, during the costly war. During the war, the United States ran a rather large and secretive program to train Chinese nationals for paramilitary and intelligence missions against the communist regime in mainland China. American oﬃcials were stationed in Taiwan, Hong Kong, occupied Japan, Okinawa, and Saipan, a territory seized from Japan at the close of World War II. Several years after an armistice was reached in the Korean War in 1953, the United States would also train and work with Tibetan insurgents ﬁghting PLA forces in the Himalayas from bases in India, Nepal, and Colorado.6 These programs, none of which were successful, were rooted in the experiences of World War II. In 1947, the CIA was founded through\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n13\n\nan act of Congress to partner with the new Department of Defense (which itself was formed from a merger of the Department of War and the Department of the Navy), the new National Security Council (NSC), and the preexisting State Department.7 The CIA’s predecessor was the highly secretive Oﬃce of Strategic Services (OSS), which successfully inserted paramilitary and intelligence oﬃcers behind enemy lines in Axis territories and wrought damage to the war eﬀorts of Nazi Germany, militarist Japan, and fascist Italy. In 1948, the National Security Council would create the Oﬃce of Political Coordination (OPC), a new branch of the CIA that controlled clandestine services and paramilitary intelligence operations against the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1949, as the tide of the Chinese Civil War was turning in favor of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the OPC turned its attention to hampering or delaying CCP control of Chinese territory.8 Downey and Fecteau, college freshmen in the spring of 1948, would join the OPC soon after their graduation in 1951. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong declared victory for the CCP in the war against Chiang Kai-shek’s Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) on the mainland. Mao’s speech marked the founding of the PRC, which would be controlled by the CCP. In late 1949, Chiang and many of his fellow nationalists would escape to the island of Taiwan and nearby oﬀshore islands, where they refused to surrender. Instead, they declared that Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, was the seat of the government of the Republic of China, the sole legitimate government of all China. The KMT and the CCP labeled each other rogue governments and claimed the other was illegally occupying a part of “one China.” But, according to both parties’ deﬁnitions, this rightfully included both the mainland and Taiwan.9 For its part, the United States would continue to recognize the government in Taipei as the sole legitimate Chinese government until 1979, when diplomatic recognition was formally transferred to the PRC and stripped from Taiwan. Chiang had been an ally in World War II against Japan, and his Republic of China was one of the “Big Four” Allied powers in the war: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. Like the Americans, Chiang was a staunch anticommunist. Though his popularity in the American press would wane in the years after World War II,\n\n14\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nhe and his Wellesley-educated wife, Soong Mei-ling, were named Time magazine’s “Man and Woman of the Year” for 1937.10 Chiang, an anticommunist Christian, was far more appealing to Americans than were the communist atheists in Moscow and Beijing. After July 1949, when Mao Zedong announced that he would “lean to one side” (the Soviet side) in the Cold War and then formed a formal alliance with the USSR in February 1950, there seemed little hope, at least in the near term, of encouraging the PRC to become an independent or anti-Soviet communist force in the vein of Josip Broz Tito’s Yugoslavia, which broke with the Soviets in 1948.11 Despite their shared aversion to communism, the Truman administration deeply mistrusted and was often annoyed by Chiang and the KMT. As far back as 1946, the administration had urged Chiang to reform his government in ways that might make it more popular and stable, thereby more capable of preventing an outright communist victory in the civil war. Truman even sent over perhaps the greatest statesman of his generation, the WWII military leader and future secretary of state and secretary of defense George C. Marshall, for an entire year to encourage KMT reform and attempt to forge a peace accord between the KMT and the CCP. But at the end of that year Marshall left in frustration. Chiang accepted generous amounts of military and economic assistance from the United States in the late 1940s but very rarely accepted advice on how to govern or how to deal with the CCP. Truman once famously complained about corruption in the KMT and that too much U.S. aid given to Chiang’s government ended up in real estate back in the United States.12 “They’re thieves,” he said later, “every damn one of them.” The ﬂow of aid to Chiang was guaranteed by his supporters in Congress—the so-called “China lobby”—and because the Truman administration needed to rally suﬃcient domestic support around a theme of anticommunism for Cold War eﬀorts. When Congress was asked to provide unprecedented peacetime aid to Europe for programs like the Marshall Plan, such aid could not pass without earmarks for Chiang. The administration could not justify big expenses to ﬁght communism elsewhere without also supporting its staunchly anticommunist Chinese former ally, who himself faced a dire threat of communist overthrow. Still, Truman, Marshall, and Dean Acheson,\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n15\n\nwho succeeded Marshall as secretary of state, trusted Chiang less and less. Frank Wisner, the director of the OPC, apparently shared that sentiment.13 Before the Korean War broke out in June 1950, even though they, like the vast majority of Americans, were sincere in their desire to staunch the spread of communism, they also wanted to extract the United States from the Chinese Civil War, concentrate their eﬀorts in the parts of the world deemed more important to U.S. national security, and perhaps foster an eventual split between the Soviet and Chinese communists.14 But that strategy was complicated by the simple fact that Chiang’s government not only endured after its defeat on the mainland, but also, since it was ensconced on an island, stayed relatively safe from the Chinese communists’ heavily land-based military one hundred nautical miles across the Taiwan Strait. The KMT’s personnel were a ready and willing tool with which the Americans could harass the Chinese communists on the mainland. This was true even if, at the same time, few viewed Chiang’s goal of recovering the mainland by military force as realistic. It took the CCP a couple of years to consolidate control of the entire mainland, especially in the portions that bordered the Southeast Asian mainland and in Tibet. Just south of the Chinese border in northern Laos and Burma, Chiang’s KMT military had a fairly strong presence under General Li Mi. This meant that it would have been diﬃcult and costly for the Truman administration to simply reject the KMT’s oﬀers to send agents into mainland China to agitate disgruntled elements of the population and reconnect with former KMT comrades in the civil war. Although they consistently acquiesced both publicly and privately to requests for cooperation from Taiwan to oppose the Chinese communists, the U.S. government still saw Chiang as fatally unpopular on the mainland. Moreover, U.S. oﬃcials believed Chiang wanted nothing more than to drag the United States into World War III with China and its Soviet ally so that Chiang could recover mainland China at America’s expense.15 The Truman administration hoped that a “third force” could congeal in Chinese politics, one that was staunchly anticommunist but not associated with Chiang’s failed government. Chiang had sometimes used brutal coercion and payoﬀs to consolidate his own power on the island, so there was really no viable anticommunist alternative\n\n16\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nto his leadership. Another option was to collaborate with Chiang’s former military oﬃcers with whom he had fallen out of favor when the KMT lost the war on the mainland. Such ﬁgures met U.S. intelligence agents frequently in Hong Kong, which was neutral ground since it was still a British colony. They argued that only they, not Chiang, could mobilize support on the mainland to reverse the communist victories there. Among these oﬃcers, Cai Wenzhi was the most appealing to the Americans. A relatively charismatic general and Chiang’s former deputy chief of staﬀ of the army. he claimed to have contacts and agents on the mainland with whom his oﬃcers could link up and mobilize potentially hundreds of thousands of disgruntled citizens against the CCP regime. What appealed most to the Americans about the third force leaders was that they had their best connections in southern China, which was near Hong Kong and which the communists only conquered very late in the war. This lent some degree of credibility to their claims.16 Of course, Chiang was extremely suspicious of the third force and the U.S. government for supporting it.17 His biographer, Jay Taylor, writes, “Chiang perceived most Taiwan-related activities by the Truman government as part of a conspiratorial plot to unseat him from power.”18 Chiang’s son and security chief, Chiang Ching-kuo, even reportedly ordered assassination attempts on Cai by KMT agents in Hong Kong.19 The administration worried that Chiang would complain about U.S. cooperation with his anticommunist rivals to his supporters on Capitol Hill and in the American public. One way to undercut that possibility, of course, was to maintain or increase U.S. support for Chiang’s own clandestine paramilitary and intelligencegathering operations on the mainland. So, in essence, the OPC ended up funding and training two rival clandestine Chinese operations against the PRC. Both groups needed to make themselves appear as valuable as possible. Therefore, perhaps predictably, the United States heard exaggerated claims from both the third force oﬃcers and Chiang’s deputies about the untapped potential of popular resistance to the ascendant CCP and each group’s own special connections on the mainland, which they could mobilize into a ﬁghting force and intelligence apparatus against the CCP.20 What these entreaties from\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n17\n\nChiang and the third force consciously or unconsciously left out was that the CCP was a skilled Leninist organization, which meant that it was more adept at consolidating control over conquered territory than it was being portrayed. While the new and often brutal revolutionary CCP regime was almost certainly unpopular in segments of Chinese society, this did not mean that it would be easy or even possible to mobilize and arm large-scale resistance groups to oppose it. For Chiang in particular, the maintenance of American support and the marketing of his government as a useful tool in the Cold War was a matter of long-term survival. Mao’s CCP had vowed to “liberate” Taiwan from the KMT and thereby unify China. Moreover, Chiang’s stated goal of recovering the mainland from the CCP was essential to the legitimacy of his government on Taiwan itself. That government was full of mainland Chinese, like Chiang himself, with few local connections to this island a hundred miles oﬀ the coast. Taiwan had been separated from China as a Japanese colony from 1895 until the end of World War II in 1945. After the KMT killed thousands of local political elites in a mass terror event launched in February 1947, Chiang’s main argument for political legitimacy on the island was the notion that Taiwan was part of China and his KMT-led Republic of China was China’s sole legitimate government. His expansive dreams of recovering all of China were, therefore, considered essential to the preservation of his much smaller goal of staying safely in power on Taiwan.21 After the PRC was formed in 1949, the United States had very weak intelligence about the mainland. It relied heavily on Chiang’s intelligence services for assessments of domestic political conditions on the mainland, since Chiang claimed he had active agents planted there.22 Though the KMT claimed that as many as two million armed rebels existed across the mainland, the CIA downgraded that estimate to about seven hundred thousand as of early 1951.23 Third force generals, of course, also argued that there were several hundred thousand anticommunist armed holdouts that could weaken if not outright overthrow the CCP, but they also argued that those groups had no loyalties to Chiang’s KMT.24 In the January 1951 National Intelligence Estimate on China, the CIA rejected the notion that there was\n\n18\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nany purely internal force that could overthrow the communist Chinese. But with the advent of the Korean War, the United States began to lower its standards for paramilitary operations; almost any political trouble that might distract or weaken the Chinese communist war eﬀort became worth it in the OPC’s eyes. Much of American behavior during the early Cold War was dictated by a major national security document drafted in the spring of 1950 called NSC 68. According to NSC 68, the Cold War was an existential struggle of ideas between communist tyranny on one side and freedom on the other. It called for the containment of communism globally rather than just in select geostrategically important locations. Before its drafting, the Truman administration had tried to focus on protecting only those “strongpoints” as deﬁned by Director of Policy Planning George F. Kennan and otherwise avoid getting bogged down in expensive anticommunist struggles in less vital sections of the world. But in 1950, Kennan’s successor, Paul Nitze, drafted NSC 68, a more expansive—and much more expensive—plan for ﬁghting the Cold War. It called not only for global containment of communism but, where possible, a “roll-back” of previous communist advances by undermining and overthrowing communist regimes in the Soviet-led bloc. This new plan was driven in part from the anxious fact that the United States had lost its nuclear monopoly the year before. The Americans could no longer blithely rely on nuclear deterrence to contain the USSR, given the risk of Soviet nuclear retaliation; it would need much more robust and much more expensive conventional military and political options to counter communist expansionism.25 Though there was widespread consensus on NSC 68 among international security policy makers within the administration, Truman shelved the plan in April and ordered most copies destroyed. The implied cost of the strategy was deemed too high in the years directly following World War II, a time in which most Americans were not eager to take on such sacriﬁces for expensive national security policies again, let alone ﬁght in some far-ﬂung corner of the world. And the strategy envisioned in NSC 68 was indeed very expensive. Truman probably worried that any leak of the document to the USSR would\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n19\n\nbe dangerous. It would suggest that the United States’ leadership believed it needed massive increases in the defense budget to protect U.S. national interests but could not secure those increases from a wary public and legislature.26 NSC 68, while top secret, was unusual for a classiﬁed document. In stark and simplistic language, it articulated a struggle of ideas that was designed to prepare the U.S. government for a sweeping and global opposition to communism. The document was not a typical analytical report. It was actually a primer of sorts for public speeches oﬃcials could give to explain why the United States was ﬁghting the Cold War and the great sacriﬁces that would be required to win it. Dean Acheson famously said of the document’s unusually moralistic and pedantic language that it was “clearer than truth.”27 Just two months earlier, in February 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy had launched his notorious campaign against communist inﬁltration of American institutions; the more moralistic and proactively anticommunist tone of NSC 68 created a useful baseline for oﬃcials to defend their preferred policies and evade being targeted by his campaign. For a complex set of bureaucratic reasons that seem hard to imagine today—the OPC, though nominally a CIA entity, received its strategic guidance from Nitze’s Oﬃce of Policy Planning at the State Department. Unlike the military buildups necessary to fulﬁll NSC 68’s vision, OPC outreach to both Chiang’s government and the third force volunteers for the purpose of harassing and destabilizing the new PRC was relatively cheap. Washington was also hungry for intelligence about the CCP regime, as the American oﬃcials had been driven entirely out of the mainland in late 1949 and early 1950 as Mao pledged, in good Leninist style, to “clean the house before inviting guests.”28 Before the outbreak of war in Korea, the OPC operations in the Far East were not only smaller but also much more expertly run. The oﬃcers in Taiwan and Hong Kong were highly experienced and linguistically capable. The Hong Kong operation was considered the most important because it involved the so-called third force personnel.29 But one major problem for the covert operations against China was that a close ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, had\n\n20\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\noutlawed any paramilitary activities in Hong Kong aimed at the PRC government out of fear that it would provoke a PRC attack on the territory, ending British rule there.30 Moreover, the U.S. government feared that Hong Kong was penetrated by PRC spies who could compromise the operations. So even though many of the third force operations were aimed at nearby southern China, it was diﬃcult and somewhat risky to train and launch any operations from Hong Kong. In 1950, the United States began moving many of its OPC facilities for Chinese operations to military bases in Japan (which was occupied after its defeat in World War II until 1951), Okinawa, and Saipan, a U.S. territory in the Mariana Islands seized from Japan by the U.S. Marine Corps after a brutal campaign in the summer of 1944.31 Then, on June 25, 1950, Kim Il-sung’s North Korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded South Korea in a massive armored assault that was clearly supported by the Soviet Union. Even though the Truman administration had excluded South Korea from the Asian “defense perimeter” six months earlier as part of Kennan’s strongpoint approach, Truman ordered U.S. forces into Korea two days later. Those forces operated as part of a multinational United Nations mission to save the imperiled South Korean regime, which was led by its pro-American and Princeton-educated president Syngman Rhee. Elements of the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet were deployed in the Taiwan Strait, thus reversing the president’s pledge from earlier that year to remove the United States from the Chinese Civil War. But Truman still did not trust Chiang and insisted the navy was there to prevent an attack from either side of the Taiwan Strait.32 The outbreak of the Korean War and Mao’s fateful decision a few months later to secretly send hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops into the Korean peninsula to attack advancing American, UN, and South Korean forces ﬁnally gave Truman the opportunity to mobilize his nation around the active Cold War strategy envisioned in NSC 68. The U.S. defense budget would soon triple from its levels before the Korean War. Most of those resources would not be spent in the Korean theater, which was still not considered as important as Japan, the Middle East, and especially Western Europe, where the NATO alliance had been formed the previous year.\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n21\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War and its escalation into a U.S.PRC proxy war would lead to an even more dramatic expansion of the OPC, especially its activities in Asia. By the fall of 1951, the OPC accounted for 50 percent of the CIA budget and 20 percent of its personnel. The OPC grew from 300 oﬃcers in 1949 to more than 2,200 in 1952.33 The budget grew seventeenfold.34 Downey and Fecteau entered into this context in 1951. Their mission was to train former KMT soldiers associated with the third force and prepare them before they were ﬂown into Northeast China to foment rebellion and gather intelligence about the CCP regime and its military wing, the People’s Liberation Army. Neither Downey nor Fecteau knew much about Chinese history, politics, or language. They were both recent college graduates, too young to have had experience in paramilitary operations with the OSS in World War II. Even before they were ordered on the ﬂight that would see them captured, there was something excessively optimistic and strategically shallow about the entire mission. For his part, Downey recognized the incongruity of training battle-hardened soldiers from China in paramilitary operations in their own home country, which he had never even visited. In a 2009 interview with Nicholas Dujmovic, Downey reported in typically humble fashion: “I was in charge of this group of a dozen Chinese. . . . I was one of the teachers, which is appalling since I had no experience of my own and was just feeding them what someone had fed me. . . . These guys all had much more experience in military aﬀairs than I had.”35 Elsewhere, Dujmovic writes that this was hardly an unusual condition for the early years of CIA paramilitary operations, which were characterized by disarray and “learning by doing.”36 Some young recruits to the expanded Korean War OPC program had more experience in China than Downey and Fecteau. One was Downey’s classmate at Yale, James Lilley, who would go on to a legendary career at the CIA, later becoming a senior oﬃcial at the State Department and the Defense Department, and eventually the only person to head U.S. diplomatic missions on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Lilley had spent a good part of his childhood in China as the son of an American oil industry executive. But even Lilley was far removed from the China of 1952 when he dutifully started\n\n22\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nhis undercover work in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He had attended prep school in the United States and majored in Russian at Yale. His bosses assumed he would be ﬂuent in Chinese. In his memoir, Lilley writes, “My superiors decided to move me to Taiwan to take advantage of my limited Chinese-language ability. ‘But you were born and raised in China,’ they protested. Yes, I was, but that just meant that I could speak Chinese like a four-year-old. I had mastered the vocabulary to count, eat, swear, and defecate.”37 In the fall of 1952, CIA Director Walter Beddell Smith said that the diﬃculties in OPC “stemmed, by and large, from the use of improperly trained personnel.”38 An internal CIA inspection report of the Far East Branch similarly described its operations as “poorly staﬀed, poorly planned, and poorly executed.”39 Like the national security establishment in general, the CIA and OPC were largely staﬀed by white members of European descent, like Downey, Fecteau, and Lilley. The successes of the OSS in Europe in World War II were facilitated by the ready availability of ﬁrst-generation European Americans who looked like the locals and often had native or near native ﬂuency in French, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Ukrainian, or Serbo-Croatian. They could understand local conditions and operate eﬀectively and safely behind enemy lines. Since they were generally inﬁltrating countries occupied by the German Nazi regime, they could often link up with resistance ﬁghters who spoke English and wanted nothing more than to rid their countries of foreign invaders. While the original leadership of the smaller pre– Korean War OPC in Asia had tremendous experience in China from before the revolution, younger oﬃcers put in places of authority in the OPC after the Korean War surge, like Downey and Fecteau, did not. These nonetheless intelligent and dedicated OPC oﬃcers had neither the knowledge nor skills to be as eﬀective as their World War II predecessors in Europe. But that was not the only glaring diﬀerence that explains the relative success of the OSS in World War II and the almost unadulterated failure of Cold War OPC paramilitary operations in Europe and Asia, not just communist China. Communist countries had no organized, sympathetic resistance forces on the ground, and there was only weak potential to create them. An internal CIA history of the OPC\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n23\n\nlamented that “the communist countries know a great deal about how to deal with their internal security; consequently little resistance by the local population could be found.”40 The communist parties allied with the Soviet Union shared Moscow’s Leninist penchant for social control and surveillance, and the CCP was no exception. Moreover, unlike Poland, France, or Ukraine in 1942, PRC China in 1952 was not occupied by a hostile foreign power, even if it might be considered infected with the European ideology of Marxism-Leninism. This meant the potential was much lower for active patriotic resistance that could link up with inﬁltrating OPC-trained agents than it was for OSS agents operating in Nazi-controlled territories in World War II. The problems of CIA paramilitary operations in China continued into the next decade. Highly inexperienced U.S. trainers inserted Tibetan freedom ﬁghters into western China, even though those trainers had never been to Tibet and did not know its physical or political geography.41 At least in that case the Tibetan ﬁghters were entering an environment in which they could more easily blend in with the locals, many of whom viewed the Chinese troops as foreign invaders. Still, no populations were liberated by these operations, and many hundreds of U.S.-trained Tibetans were killed or captured.42 During the Korean War, the United States often relied on intelligence about the mainland from captured Chinese soldiers on the peninsula, many of whom were former KMT soldiers ﬁghting with the “Chinese People’s Volunteers.” They were ordered by the PRC government to support North Korea but had few loyalties to the CCP. They often wanted to defect to Taiwan or at least were persuaded to do so by psychological pressure campaigns in the POW camps. Their relatively high defection rate itself and the general dissatisfaction they expressed with the new government in China must have given the CIA some unfounded hope about the prospect of locating resistance and fomenting turmoil on the mainland. Without enough trained soldiers and civilians ﬂuent in Mandarin Chinese (most Chinese Americans at the time spoke Cantonese or other non-Mandarin dialects), the United States had to rely on KMT interpreters to interrogate Chinese prisoners. The U.S. Air Force tried to ﬁx the shortage of\n\n24\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\nlanguage-capable military personnel by launching a wartime Mandarin Chinese program at Yale, but such training simply took too long to ramp up eﬀectively for a hot war.43 KMT agents were also hired to teach “political education” classes to the prisoners. For those prisoners who did not jump at the ﬁrst opportunity to defect to the enemy during the war but were simply captured, this amounted to anticommunist brainwashing that closely mimicked KMT propaganda about recovering the mainland. Even though the OPC was more interested in creating an anticommunist third force separate from the KMT than simply supporting the KMT’s eﬀorts, these education classes at least instilled anticommunism.44 By the summer of 1951, some twenty-one thousand Chinese POWs were in UN Command’s custody, so U.S. forces in Korea had little choice but to rely on Chiang’s personnel, which revealed the CIA’s connection to all these POW activities. Chinese operatives were often ﬂown behind enemy lines in wartime Korea and China on ostensibly privately owned aircraft belonging to Civil Air Transport (CAT), an airline owned and operated in part by Claire Chennault, the legendary commander of the Flying Tigers, the American volunteer aviators who defended China against Japanese invaders even before Pearl Harbor.45 Downey and Fecteau were onboard a CAT aircraft when they were shot down and captured in Manchuria. Chennault’s CAT airline logged ﬁfteen thousand ﬂights between Taiwan and Korea during the course of the war.46 This reliance on nationalist interpreters and “teachers” created danger for the Americans. The nationalist agents spun their intelligence about the mainland to make it more plausible that Chiang could indeed return to the mainland and overthrow the communist regime there. This could thereby shore up the fading prospects that an anticommunist rebellion could be catalyzed by agents in areas of alleged resistance by OPC operations. Since nationalist government agents teaching political education classes lured defectors and other prisoners away from the mainland and to Taiwan to bolster Chiang’s own legitimacy there as the true leader of Chinese anticommunism, this arrangement was inconsistent with OPC’s goal of creating a credible third force that was neither communist nor nationalist.47 In late 1951, the CIA assessed that no large organized guerilla movement\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n25\n\nlikely existed in mainland China for either the nationalists or the third force to exploit. Given the press of wartime necessity, however, OPC operations on the mainland continued.48 The covert missions involving noncommunist Chinese were almost all unadulterated failures. The only real exception was on the Korean peninsula itself. Koreans were ﬁghting on both sides in the war, as were many foreigners, including hundreds of thousands of Chinese in support of North Korea and a multinational force ﬁghting under a UN ﬂag alongside the South Koreans. Although we do not have some of the ﬁne-grained detail, it seems clear from available open-source histories that CIA operations on the peninsula itself during the Korean War were more successful than any of the operations in which Downey, Fecteau, and Lilley were engaged with third force or KMT operatives in mainland China. In Korea, the clandestine operations may have weakened the North Korean and Chinese war eﬀorts by providing useful intelligence about their troop strengths and movements (commonly referred to as the “order of battle”). Therefore, in Korea, the intelligence gathering operations seemed to perform better than the OPC paramilitary or intelligence-gathering operations on the mainland itself.49 According to the historian David Cheng Chang, it appears that even these operations had an enormous toll. One group, called “Unit 8240,” comprised two or three hundred former Chinese POWs who had been soldiers in the Chinese People’s Volunteers. These prisoners were initially mobilized for—or coerced into—missions in which they were inserted into North Korea and then walked back to the 38th parallel, gathering intelligence on enemy troop dispositions along the way. The vast majority were apparently killed or captured in these operations.50 But unlike in OPC operations on the mainland during the Korean War, from which apparently no agents returned, at least several dozen of the men of Unit 8240 survived multiple missions and were eventually sent to Taiwan. Still, given the low survival rate it is fair to say that these Korea-focused missions shared one grim quality of the OPC missions on the mainland: a rather callous indiﬀerence to the lives of the Chinese collaborators. But even in wartime, communist China was not the same as battleﬁeld Korea. Political subterfuge is more complicated than simply\n\n26\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\ngathering intelligence on troop dispositions, and even the latter is harder in a stable political environment than in a more ﬂuid war situation. Both the nationalists in Taiwan with whom Lilley cooperated and the third force agents with whom Downey and Fecteau worked simply did not have well-placed or well-organized opposition contacts in China, disgruntled citizens with whom they could collaborate in paramilitary operations or from whom they could gather actionable intelligence about the Chinese war eﬀort in Korea. Downey and Fecteau’s third force Chinese team were dropped into Manchuria in July 1952, apparently failed to link up with any alleged local anticommunist warlords, and were captured and turned by the Chinese security forces in the following months. This enabled the November ambush that killed the two American pilots and captured the two CIA oﬃcers. For his part, Lilley dispatched his ﬁrst Taiwan-based team into Manchuria in October 1952 with similarly disappointing results. He wrote, “My team successfully parachuted into Manchuria in October 1952. . . . We hoped that they would be able to give us helpful information on Chinese troop movements on the Chinese-Korean border. They came up once on the radio and then we never heard from them again. We guess that they assimilated into Chinese society or had been caught.”51 Lilley summarized the problem for the OPC like this: “Contrary to CIA predictions, our missions were unable to locate or exploit the kind of discontent among the Chinese population that could be used to establish intelligence bases in China. The Chinese were not willing to side with outside forces.”52 He continued: “One explanation for our lack of success was that security was so tight in Communist China.” Moreover, “our intelligence partners in Taiwan were a defeated and demoralized group. . . . If they once did have good intelligence contacts on the mainland, those sources had eventually dried up.”53 While frustrated with his charges in Taiwan, Lilley had particular disdain for Downey’s third force collaborators, whom he accused of having “swindled” the CIA by inﬂating their inﬂuence and connections and then concocting fabricated intelligence reports based on publicly available newspaper accounts of events on the mainland rather than from clandestine activity.54 On the occasion of Downey and Fecteau’s trial in November 1954, the Chinese government issued\n\nA N A MERIC A N HER O ON A FO OL’S MI S SION\n\n27\n\nstatistics on CIA clandestine operations in China from 1951 to 1953. In all, just over two hundred agents had been inserted into the PRC in those two years. About half of them had been killed and the other half captured. According to an American expert chronicling U.S. clandestine activities, these Chinese statistics were not questioned as propagandistic but accepted as factual in internal U.S. government reports.55 And the more straightforward incursions from Burma by remnant nationalist troops under General Li Mi, themselves backed by the OPC, fared no better. The PLA consistently repelled the invaders in China’s southwest without ever greatly hampering China’s pursuit of a bloody but limited war on the Korean peninsula.56 It is hard to imagine a more pure record of failure than this.\n\n3 WHO I AM, WHERE I CAME FROM\n\nO\n\nNE OF the ﬁrst rules in prison is to submerge one’s self in whatever routine is imposed. Let the trivia work as a sponge to absorb each day of conﬁnement. Forget the taste of ice cream, a girl’s laughter, drinks with friends, Christmas with family. These are the memories to be repressed. But the forgetting must be selective, for the humiliations of prison can be withstood only if one keeps his essential identity. And in prison, I never forgot who I was and where I came from. I had told the Chinese court that my home was in New Britain because that compact, rugged industrial city was where my mother lived and where I had spent part of my adolescence. But New Britain was just one of the places I thought of as home. The others were Wallingford, Connecticut, the town where the Downey family lived, where I was born, where I spent my most innocent childhood. Then Choate School and Yale University, the campuses where I made the passage to manhood, were the other places I call home. Wallingford, where my deepest roots are, was the ﬁrst stop on the rail line running north from New Haven. It was a classic New England combination of factory and farm. The plants belonged to the International Silver Company, the Wallace Silverware Company, and the Backus “Star Brand” Fireworks Company. Even in the Depression,\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\n29\n\nwhen my younger brother Bill, my sister Joan, and I were growing up, the factories were busy and they gave jobs to many of the town’s eleven thousand people. For us kids, our domain was outside of town, the countryside where we could swim in any pond or creek, and there was no water that scared us. In little Wallingford, we had a sense of unbounded space, and we roamed its back roads and woods and pastures for miles on foot and on bicycle. Here was where I started my sense of adventure in life. The Downeys were farmers who came to Wallingford from Ireland before the American Civil War. My grandfather, Jack F. Downey, left the new family homestead when he was fourteen years old to work in a manufacturing shop in town. Eventually he saved enough money to buy a tavern across the tracks from the railroad station. Although it happened to be the poor side of the tracks, that did not deter him in his political ambitions. In this country which treated him so well, my grandfather became a devout Democrat. He served one term in the state legislature and many years as chairman of the town Democratic party. He saw his sons’ successes exceed his own. For a time, the intersection of South Cherry Street and Quinnipiac Street, where his tavern stood, amounted to a Downey enclave. Diagonally opposite the tavern was a grocery store owned by my Uncle Tommy, and on another corner was the main ﬁrehouse, where my Uncle Jim was the chief. A few blocks up Center Street was the brick-paved main street of Wallingford, where my grandfather’s ﬁrst son, Jack E. Downey, my father, maintained two oﬃces. My father was the pride and joy of the entire family. He graduated from Catholic University in Washington, DC, in 1920 then graduated from Yale Law School in 1923. My father had one oﬃce for his private law practice above a bank; the other was his oﬃce for serving as probate judge in the Town Hall. The municipal building stood at the top of the Center Street hill. When I drove with my father down the hill to visit my grandfather, the tires of his big car made a loud humming noise rushing over the brick pavement. I was on top of the world. My family’s prosperity was measured by the houses where we lived. Our ﬁrst house, the one where I was born, was small and rented. The second house was larger, at a better address on North Main Street, but still rented. From here I was able to enroll in the Putnam School.\n\n30\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\nThis nursery was run by the reﬁned Miss Morgan, who insisted on the beneﬁt one could get from knowing French. I was more enchanted by the nature walks to the nearby Harrison Park looking for stones or digging for worms. After four subsequent years in public schools, I transferred to parochial school, named for the Holy Trinity. By this time my father had saved enough money to buy a lot on the street in the town’s best new neighborhood, as noted in the local newspaper. The new house, built by my parents with a circular staircase and seven spacious rooms, was my new castle. It stood on a hill across from the local country club, whose greens and fairways were almost an extension of our front lawn. The absolute security we had known as beloved children of a prominent Irish family in a small town ended on an autumn day of my eighth year. I was playing with friends a few houses down from my home when my aunt came through the backyards to call me inside and tell me my father was in the hospital. I found out later, reading the local news, that he had an auto accident driving back from seeing a client. His Ford station wagon had run oﬀ a quiet country road and hit a tree. No one knew how the accident happened, whether he had been speeding or had swerved to avoid a dog, a deer, or another car. He died at the hospital, never having regained consciousness. I only knew that he was my father and that I loved him, that my future was now going to be diﬀerent. This loss was so big, I never got over it. I tried to do well in school, always looking for the father ﬁgure I had lost. In later years, when I become involved in sports, my coaches became my father ﬁgures. Our outward lives did not change immediately; my mother made sure of that. We stayed in the same big house for awhile, as my mother quietly looked for a job. But the months passed, and money was mentioned more and more often. As the oldest son, I tried to assume some manly responsibilities. Since the golf course clubhouse was directly across the road and I was big and tall for my age, I had no trouble getting a job as a caddie. I kept a careful record of the number of rounds I worked and my earnings, separating tips from fees. As my shortsightedness got worse, I missed ﬁnding the balls. One day after I missed two balls, I got no pay, even though I had sweated all day in the tall grass.\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\n31\n\nWe left Wallingford in 1941 when I was eleven. My mother had inherited half ownership in a three-family house in New Britain, where her family had settled and where she still had three living sisters. Since she had taught in this city for twelve years before she married my father, she had no problem ﬁnding a teaching job again. With her salary and the sale of the Wallingford house, we had a secure, although a much more modest life. As soon as I settled in New Britain, I found a job as a newspaper boy with a neighbor named Tom Meskill,1 who was two years my senior. He ﬁrst hired me then sold me the route for ﬁve dollars. I got up early and raced to get my job done. My mother allowed me to keep part of my earnings, and I bought my ﬁrst volume of an encyclopedia. Once I ﬁnished my job, I would climb onto my bed and read my encyclopedia. I had barely begun to feel at home after three years in New Britain when I was back in Wallingford again, this time as a scholarship student at the preparatory Choate School for boys. Every summer our family spent our vacation along the Connecticut shore. This year I had become friends with a Choate boy, whose mother heard that I was a good student and I had been elected class president at Saint Joseph School. She urged my mother to let me apply to Choate School. At ﬁrst that was not my mother’s plan; as a widow with three children she could not aﬀord to send me to a prep school. But the other mother suggested that I apply for a scholarship from Choate. I had dreamed of going back home to Wallingford since the day I left. I arrived on the Choate campus with a townie’s chip on my shoulder, but I soon sloughed it oﬀ. I felt more than accepted at Choate; I was part of it. I began spending summers there as a counselor for New York City youths who attended a camp run by the school. I may have been surprised to ﬁnd myself at Choate, but by the time I graduated I was not surprised to ﬁnd myself headed for Yale University. Again I was a scholarship student, and though I lacked the J. Press wardrobes of my richer classmates, I was even happier at Yale than at Choate. By senior year, I was on the varsity football team. There were ﬁve of us who played both oﬀense and defense, and we got oﬀ only at half time—we considered ourselves the iron men. I also was the captain of Yale’s varsity wrestling team. While typical Yalies dressed in ties and blazers, I made a virtue of cultivating a jock\n\n32\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\nimage by wearing ragged sweaters and baggy khaki trousers everywhere I could. My dress did not keep me from being elected class representative from Timothy Dwight, my undergraduate college at Yale, or being rushed at Saint Anthony Hall, a two-year fraternity, in my junior year. Even in my Yale years, I did not miss any opportunity for adventure. I rode the bus to Ivy League colleges to play football and wrestled up and down the Northeast. I also rode with my St. A’s brother John Kittredge to Smith College for mixers. And I was a blind date for girls who pined for my dashing roommate, Putney Westerﬁeld. The summer after sophomore year, my poor mother reluctantly agreed to let me join classmate Bayard Fox to tour Europe. We covered France, Spain, England, and Scotland. We found the best way to see the country was by hitchhiking; not only did we get to see more of the countryside, we also got to meet the people, and eat at local eateries. Several times we slept in the park or on a ﬁeld of a farm. Bayard and I could not have been from more diﬀerent backgrounds; he was from an upper-class family in the city of Philadelphia, and I was from an Irish family with a widowed teacher mother. But as we had lived and died together in wrestling for Yale University, we felt as close as brothers. Bayard and I also shared the same sense of adventure. The last summer in college, my Yale buddies Bob Longman, Henry Ott-Hansen, and Bayard Fox and I wanted to make the most of it. We decided to venture to Alaska. Two underclassmen, one of whom had a car, got wind of our plan and joined us. In mid-May 1950, some of us started out of New Haven for our adventure west. Along the way we picked up our group one by one until all six of us were in the old station wagon. The trip to Alaska covered almost ﬁve thousand miles of highway. It took us at least eight days of continuous driving. All the way, we followed a simple scheme: three guys sat in the front, three slept in the back, and we made a counter-clockwise rotation every two hours. To break the monotony of driving, we stopped every once in a while at a diner to have a good meal, or we would get washed up and go to a local dance. There were long stretches of driving on ﬂat ground where we saw nothing but cornﬁelds, so we sang to amuse ourselves. A lot of the roads were not paved, and at times the riding could be rough. We certainly learned how wide and open the country\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\n33\n\nwas. It all worked out well most of the way, except that the old car broke down once somewhere on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada. We had to wait fourteen long hours for a spare part. Our last stop was to be Anchorage, Alaska. Once we got there, we were surprised to ﬁnd that there were hundreds of young guys just like us milling around in town looking for summer jobs. But we were lucky that we accidentally drove into Valdez, which had a thriving shipping business. The cargo ship needed longshoremen, and eventually all six of us were hired. They paid us $2.17 per regular hour, $3.25 per overtime hour. That was good money. But the work load was grueling, and sometimes the overtime went over twenty-four hours straight. The days were long. We had to sleep in daylight. Once the ship was unloaded, we had to wait for the next ship to come ashore. These were the times we ventured to the small downtown of Valdez. The ﬁrst time I heard the word “Korea,” we were on Main Street in Valdez, the one-block-long, only paved street in town. Some guy ran down the street yelling, “The war broke out in Korea! The war broke out in Korea!” The six of us stopped in our tracks. We looked at each other and asked, “Where the hell is Korea?” None of us knew. And we thought it had nothing to do with us, and soon forgot about it. We went into a bar and had some beer, and we drove around aimlessly. When Bayard went inland for ﬂy ﬁshing, the rest of us went to the beach and dared each other to jump into the icy cold water. While war was going on in Korea, our lives in America were carefree and exuberant, and we knew nothing but happiness. A couple of months later, Bayard Fox and I were the ﬁrst ones to leave. We ﬂew to Portland, Oregon, and then decided to hitchhike southward toward San Francisco. This trip down the West Coast of the U.S. was just the extension of our trip in Europe. We stuck out our thumbs by the roadside and got picked up by some nice folks. We talked and laughed while looking out of the windows of a truck. San Francisco was a dreamland for me; the Golden Gate Bridge, Chinatown, the trolley cars gliding down steep hills all seemed so exotic. We attended a few parties arranged by a cousin of Bayard. Then we continued our hitchhiking trip out of San Francisco all the way to Yellowstone Park. Once we got to Wyoming, Bayard went on another ﬂy ﬁshing trip somewhere, and I took a bus back to Connecticut.\n\n34\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\nAs I was the only one on the bus when we were in Connecticut, the bus driver went out of his way to get me closer to my home. My football training started two weeks before the other students returned to the Yale campus. I was very aware that this was my last year at the University. I needed to make a good showing in my football games; the game depended highly on the ﬁve tough guys, we needed to be in top shape. My senior fall season went quickly. We lived on the highs and lows of our football battles. All in all, our football team did well; we had a 6–3 record. The best part of our football results was that we won “The Game” against Harvard on their home turf. That day’s weather was terrible, and Cambridge caught the tail of a late November hurricane. It was windy, rainy, and some hail was beating down on us, but we battled to the end and won, 14–6. We were aware this would be a Yale vs. Harvard football record for generations to come. When the spring term came along, all the seniors had become somebody. Friends of mine would be known as a member of the Whiﬀenpoofs, a prestigious singing group; a varsity golfer; a varsity wrestler; and a varsity hockey player. Others would be known as members of a certain secret society; an editor of Yale Daily News; and a radio broadcaster. I recounted my accomplishments at Yale. By the spring of 1951, I had a sense that my job at Yale was done, and now I was wondering what I would do after graduation. Although we were preoccupied with our senior lives at Yale and on other campuses, we were aware of the changing world outside. The threat of Communism’s expansion was in the news almost every day. We heard President Truman’s forceful speech against Communism, and we saw short ﬁlms of Russian Communist army tanks rolling into China. We knew the whole of mainland China had been taken over by Communism, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had evacuated with his Kuomintang army to Taiwan. My fraternity brothers would sit around in groups and discuss our future in the new world. We speculated who was going to do what after college. We knew who planned to be married, who would travel abroad, who would go to law school and so on. I had always dreamed of being a lawyer just like my father, and running for political oﬃce later. But ﬁrst I had to earn and save some money.\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\n35\n\nOne day in early spring in the basement bar of Saint Anthony Hall, a brother a year ahead of our class was present. He gave us the story of the newly established Central Intelligence Agency organization (CIA). He told us the CIA was the successor of the Oﬃce of Strategic Services (OSS). We all had heard of the glamorous stories of the OSS during World War II. The upperclassman emphasized that now we had our own war in Korea, and our new agency, the CIA. He promised that the CIA would be doing things as exciting as the old OSS. Besides, he added, the CIA was less stuﬀy than the State Department. Like all seniors at the time, we admired the other seniors in our class who were veterans of World War II. Now it was our turn to contribute. North Korea was obviously the aggressor. It had the backing of Communist China and Russia. South Korea had the backing of the United Nations and the United States. We wanted to stop Communism the way some of our veteran classmates had stopped Nazism. One night a St. A’s, a brother named Reg ran into the basement bar. He announced with excitement that the CIA had sent a recruiter to the Yale campus. The next evening there was going to be a gathering at the residence of Professor Arnold Wolfers from the Political Science department. At least two dozen seniors were at that meeting. An undistinguished CIA representative spoke ﬂuently of the new organization and its mission. There were plans to organize the resistance ﬁghters and to parachute behind enemy lines. It all sounded irresistibly adventurous to young men like us. At the end of the talk, I was among those who submitted our names and credentials. In those days, the students at Yale knew of another political science professor named Sherman Kent who went down to Washington, DC, almost every weekend. There surely were more campus recruiting meetings going on, as I later learned.2 That evening I was told to come back the next day for a one-onone initial interview. When I went back the next day, the recruiter noticed that my major was English, my foreign language was Spanish, and I played several sports. A few weeks later, I received an application form from Washington in a disguised envelope. I ﬁlled out the form and took it with me when I went to Washington by train for the oﬃcial interview. To my disappointment, the interview was held at an area known as Foggy Bottom, a dismal name. The oﬃces were\n\n36\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\nin a two-story barracks-style temporary building. At the end of the interview, the oﬃcer told me that, if I were to be accepted, I would be notiﬁed by telephone. I went home and had my twenty-ﬁrst birthday while anxiously waiting to hear from the CIA. When the phone call ﬁnally came, it also went individually to everyone who had been accepted. The calls were made the same evening through the same main Yale switchboard. The names of those selected were quickly common knowledge on campus. So much for the high-level clandestine operations! We were told to be in Washington the next day for proceedings. The short notice seemed rather arbitrary. The only way to make it on time was to ﬂy from New York City to Washington. It was outlandish but rather exciting as well. Much to my delight, among my twenty-one St. A’s brothers of the class of ʼ51, seven had made it. Among our four roommates at Timothy Dwight College at Yale, two made it.3 Suddenly, my life had a purpose. I was to join the movement to stop the evil advance of Communism. I no longer wondered what I was going to do after graduation. Also the CIA payment was good; it was about three times the teacher salary of my mother. I could save it all for law school. Besides, I could travel to Asia. I had been fascinated by Asia since I was a young boy. I remember during the Second World War, as kids, we collected pennies to save the starving children in China. During my second year at Yale, I thought I was going to China to teach English through the Yale-in-China program. Communism ended that dream for me. Now the new Communist China had become our new enemy in the Korean War. But I was sure we were the good guys, and we were to save the world from the oppression of Communism. In the meantime, there were a lot of senior parties to attend, both at Yale and at Smith College. I continued to hitch a ride with John Kittredge to go up to Smith College to meet with our gals. The question of what I was going to do after college kept coming up with my mother and my friends. I had to make evasive answers, not characteristic of me. The more I tried to avoid the question, the more suspicious I seemed. Once Nancy said jokingly, “I hope you are not going to be an international spy or something.” I almost fell out of my chair. She had no idea how close she had gotten.\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\n37\n\nThe weekend before our Yale graduation, my fraternity brother John Kittredge got married to his longtime sweetheart from Smith College. It was an idealistic wedding of established New England families. The reception was in a beautiful family garden. The handsome young couple was surrounded by well-dressed handsome Yale guys and beautiful young ladies from Smith College. The hilltop garden seemed to be humming with harmonious songs of peace and prosperity. The newlyweds were to ﬂy to Bermuda for their honeymoon. In the back of my mind, I knew this would be my last hurrah before I left these dear people and peaceful places behind. I would soon march into the front line of a war. I might never be back again. I was intoxicated by my imagined scene in Casablanca, so “Play it again, Sam!” I got roaring drunk. I don’t remember how I got home that night. I do remember that I missed my graduation ceremony the next morning, much to my mother’s disappointment. But since I was going to war, the graduation ceremony seemed meaningless. The CIA training classes were held in Washington, D.C. I found in my class of thirty-ﬁve, that there were two of my fraternity brothers, and ﬁve classmates from Yale, Bayard Fox among them. There were also four from Harvard, and seven from Princeton. Ben McAlpin was one from Princeton, who was also from Connecticut. To be sure there were men from other colleges, but the tone of those 1951 classes was distinctively Ivied. Many of my rivals from other colleges soon became my closest friends. As the training classes in Clandestine Operations began, it seemed an extension of my college days. By July, we were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia to start three months of military training. Here it was more like a college summer camp. At Fort Benning, our class was joined by young oﬃcers from all three armed services, which brought our total number in the class up to seventy-ﬁve. Now the atmosphere was really getting serious. We continued our training in ﬁeld craft and the use of weapons and explosives. We slogged through the swamps and pine woods of southern Georgia. We college students had never gotten as down and dirty as this. But we gritted our teeth and put on brave faces to tough it out. We did not lose our high spirit at all. On free weekends, we piled into cars and drove for hours to visit exotic Southern cities, one after another. In Phoenix City, Alabama, a tawdry town famous for its vice,\n\n38\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\nwe hung around bars and reveled in our carefully nurtured sophistication. When the time came for parachute jump school, we were more than ready to prove how robust we were; we jogged everywhere we went. We made sure that none of our guys balked on any jump, whether it was from a 150-foot high practice tower or from any of the ﬁve real jumps we made from airplanes. I was a heavyweight; when I jumped, I went down fast and landed like a ton of bricks, while the lighter guys came down like a feather and landed on their feet. In mid-October, we returned to the Washington area again for a ﬁnal six weeks of clandestine methods instruction. We studied at a safe house situated in a non-descript place in Maryland. It was here we received our ﬁrst real assignments. Members of our class who had prized academic specialties tended to draw missions in Europe. Bayard Fox, who spoke French, was assigned to Europe. The rest of us were assigned to Asia and the war zone in Korea. After the Korean war had raged back and forth in the Korean peninsula for more than a year, the ﬁghting stabilized at the 38th parallel. Most of us in our training class wanted to get to the war zone before the ﬁghting was over. Before I left Washington, I wrote to my mother and my girlfriend and paid a last visit to the Lincoln Memorial. Under the giant statue, I was spellbound; there was so much good one person could do if he had the courage to stand up. I squared my shoulders and walked away telling myself it was time for me to take on my share of duty for my country. The three of us, Ben McAlpin, Joe E. from Georgetown, and I were ﬂying out of Washington together. Our ﬁrst stop was San Francisco. We stayed overnight in a hotel on a hilltop overlooking the glistening San Francisco Bay with the suspended Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel had a pool of water and a live mermaid, and we could not take our eyes oﬀ of her. The next day, we boarded a commercial airline for our next stop in Hawaii. In the ʼ50s, Northwest Orient aircraft had two levels; the lower level had seats that could turn into bunk beds, and the upper level was a bar with a lounge. For whatever reason, I had fallen into a sound sleep, and my comrades were unable to wake me up. Eventually the two guys literally picked me up, lifted me out of the bunk, and carried me up to the lounge. There was a boisterous party going on with the other soldiers who were heading to the front line.\n\nW HO I A M, W HERE I C A ME F R OM\n\n39\n\nWe landed in Honolulu at the crack of dawn. We decided to check into the luxurious Moana Hotel for the day, and we quickly changed into swimming trunks and headed for Waikiki Beach. The sounds and sights were mesmerizing. We lingered on the beach almost the whole day. As evening came, we suited up and took the plane for the last leg of our trip to Japan. The plane stopped on Midway Island in the North Paciﬁc Ocean to refuel and continued onward. We three arrived at Atsugi Naval Air Station the next morning. Immediately Ben and Joe were assigned to go to the front line in South Korea, and I was assigned a desk job at the base. I protested that I should be going to South Korea with my buddies. It was no consolation to me to be told that the reason for my special assignment was due to my peers in my class rating me higher in the class in leadership abilities. Deepening my irritation was the fact that I had packed few civilian clothes, expecting to wear military issues at the front line. I saw Ben and Joe oﬀ, ashamed to have let them down. For the ﬁrst time, I realized that my fate was no longer in my hands. I must obey orders from my superiors.\n\n4 THE KOREAN WATERSHED The Cold War Begins for Downey and America Thomas J. Christensen\n\nI\n\nN M AY 1950, Jack Downey was a carefree rising senior at Yale, seemingly destined to follow his late father’s career in law and then public service. His future was bright. Even at an elite institution like Yale, he was a leader among leaders, captain of his wrestling team, and a key oﬀensive and defensive player on the varsity football team. Although he was an Irish Catholic from a single-parent home—hardly the norm for Yale at the time—he had attended the Choate School on scholarship. In classrooms and university clubs, he mingled with America’s aristocracy, like his good friend Bayard Fox from Philadelphia. The United States was also on top of the world. Five years earlier, America and its allies had defeated fascism, demanding and receiving unconditional surrender from Germany, Japan, and Italy. But unlike its allies, the United States had not been crippled by the war. The industrial wartime economy that developed had pulled the United States out of the Great Depression and built a foundation for decades of uncontested American leadership. Downey was riding the immediate, large, and rather happy wave of his immediate elders, later dubbed the Greatest Generation, who had fought in the war; some of them then returned to attend college at places like Yale.\n\nT HE KORE A N WAT ER SHED\n\n41\n\nDowney’s own college life would become, in a sense, a metaphor for the nation. On June 25, 1950, events in a country of which Downey claims he had never heard would change the direction of his own life and the course of American foreign policy. North Korean military forces crossed an international boundary between North and South Korea that had been drawn by the young United Nations. Kim Ilsung’s government threatened to unify the peninsula under communist rule. The United States correctly saw the conﬂict as not just a civil war but as communist expansionism backed by the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). President Truman had seen in the late 1930s how future U.S. allies in Europe naively attempted and failed to appease Hitler’s Germany. With that bitter lesson in mind, he ordered U.S. forces to enter the conﬂict under the ﬂag of the United Nations. Their goal was to save the South Korean regime of Syngman Rhee and in so doing halt the growth of communism.1 Downey heard about the outbreak of war while traveling to Alaska during summer break with his college roommates. After returning for his senior year at Yale, a hotbed of recruitment for the young CIA, Downey and other Yalies—among them James Lilley, also from the Class of ʼ51—were brought to the front line of the increasingly hot Cold War.2 The Korean War was the ﬁrst major conﬂict of the Cold War for the United States. But it was much more than that. The ﬁghting on the Korean peninsula, particularly after it escalated into a Sino-American conﬂict there in late 1950, mobilized the United States for the decades-long struggle with the Soviet Union and its allies. From 1950 to 1951, the defense budget tripled. Most of the resources absorbed by the federal government for national security purposes during the Korean War would not be devoted to Korea but to places like Western Europe, the Middle East, and Japan. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was not quite a year old when the Korean War broke out, and though it may be diﬃcult to imagine today, the United States had not yet stationed many troops in allied Europe. The ﬁrst six months of the Korean War changed all that. In a nutshell, the Korean War moved America to ﬁght the Cold War in earnest.3 As mentioned in chapter 2, the escalation of the Korean War in the second half of 1950 allowed the Truman administration to pull NSC 68\n\n42\n\nT HE KORE A N WAT ER SHED\n\noﬀ the shelf and fund the expensive national security strategy it envisioned. This massive mobilization included a 200-percent increase in the defense budget by early 1951 and the incredible expansion of the CIA and its clandestine service, the Oﬃce of Policy Coordination (OPC), in which Downey would eventually serve.4 In Downey’s own telling, he ﬂags the drafting of NSC 68 in April 1950, about which he could not have known in real time, and the outbreak of the Korean War a few months later as the pivotal moments of that year.5 The Cold War had begun before the North Korean invasion. But despite some notable and bold exceptions—the launching of the Marshall Plan for reconstructing Europe in 1948 and the formation of NATO in 1949—the United States was not yet fully committed to countering the spread of international communism in Europe and Asia. This was mostly because of domestic politics. After victory over the Axis powers in 1945, Americans were eager to bring their soldiers home and return to normal life and were reluctant to support foreign entanglements that might yield another world war. Although public opinion was not as isolationist as it was during the Great Depression, Americans resisted the high costs of national security objectives in what was ostensibly peacetime, and huge budget deﬁcits had not yet become normal. Congress was inundated with mail that included the baby shoes of children who had never met their fathers, attached to notes that said “Bring Daddy Home.”6 In early 1947, with some help from Winston Churchill’s famous 1946 Iron Curtain speech, the Truman administration began to draw public attention to the threats posed by the Soviets. A crisis in Greece and Turkey threatened the stability of those anticommunist governments. These two countries straddle the straits connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, and the survival of friendly governments there limited the Soviet navy’s movements, protecting the democracies of Western Europe. In February, in a speech dubbed the Truman Doctrine, President Truman convinced Congress to pass an unprecedented peacetime aid package for those countries and then, the next year, to provide funds for the much larger Marshall Plan assistance program for the future NATO allies. Truman did so by using crusading rhetoric: “The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty\n\nT HE KORE A N WAT ER SHED\n\n43\n\nand strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive.” His speech called for the United States to defend “free peoples” everywhere from the scourge of communism. He knew he was being hyperbolic, but the Republican senator Arthur Vandenberg had advised him to “scare hell out of the American people.”7 By historic standards, Truman was relatively successful. He secured a large peacetime national security budget that included about 5 percent of GNP for defense and about 2 percent of GNP for foreign economic and military aid from 1948 to 1950. Such expenditures for national security had no peacetime precedent in American history.8 By comparison, today such security expenditures constitute about half that percentage of GNP, and the U.S. economy is much larger, so the marginal cost to the average citizen is much lower than it was in the spring of 1950. Foreign policy experts knew, however, that even this was not enough to match Truman’s speeches’ universalistic approach to anticommunism. So, contra the public globalist rhetoric, from 1947 to 1950, the Truman administration focused national security resources on bolstering the economies and security portfolios of a select group of friendly states. They looked especially toward states with industrial potential, like Europe and Japan, states with natural resources, like those in the Middle East, and states in important geopolitical locations, like Greece and Turkey. In the thinking of Truman’s inﬂuential director of policy planning, George Kennan, preventing communist advances in these “strongpoints” was far more important than doing so in places like mainland China, Taiwan, and the Korean peninsula"
