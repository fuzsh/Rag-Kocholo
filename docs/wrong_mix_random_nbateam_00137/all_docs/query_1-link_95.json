        "text": "Grocery Outlet has a Unique Cereal to the Pacific Northwest\n\nI love walking down the aisles of our local Grocery Outlet stores. I never have any intended reason to buy anything, but I'll just stroll through and see what falls in the cart. So many times I'll find items that I can't find at any other store in Yakima. Me, I'm a huge fan of breakfast cereal and seeing this made me smile out loud.\n\nYou might walk by this and think it's a generic-type of cereal. Not from the major companies like Kellogg's or General Mills but this particular cereal is even more unique as it's not commonly found in the pacific northwest. This company that sometimes supplies grocery stores on the east coast found its way over to Yakima of all places and I'm so happy it did as it's not a knock-off of any other popular cereal on the market.\n\nPB & J cereal is just that. Peanut butter puffs (think Peanut Butter Crunch) along with other puffs flavored like strawberry. It's a unique combination but super good and so happy I found it at Grocery Outlet. This photo was taken at the location on Summitview but the other locations may or may not have it. If you're in for a treat, might swing by and grab a box or two.\n\nLOOK: 40 Discontinued & Special Edition Kellogg's Cereals\n\nLOOK: 15 Discontinued McDonald's Menu Items\n\n15 Iconic Retail Stores That Don't Exist Anymore (But We Totally Miss Shopping At)\n\nLOOK: See the iconic cars that debuted the year you were born\n\n50 Famous Brands That No Longer Exist\n\nCHECK IT OUT: 100 sports records and the stories behind them\n\nCHECK THEM OUT: 100 years of Christmas toys, gifts and fads\n\nLOOK: 100 years of American military history\n\nTOP 10: The best holiday TV specials of all time, ranked\n\n10 Old Fisher Price Toys That Are a Blast From The Past\n\nCHECK IT OUT: These words were born in the '80s\n\nHere are the top 25 hits of the â€˜80s based on their overall popularity.\n\nCHECK IT OUT: The Best Movie Character Names of the 1980s\n\nCHECK IT OUT: Here Are the 77 Most '70s Things About 1977\n\nKEEP LOOKING: See what 50 company logos looked like then and now\n\nKEEP READING: See notable new words that were coined the year you were born\n\nKEEP READING: What were the most popular baby names from the past 100 years?\n\nKEEP READING: Here are 50 of the most famous sports goofs\n\nKEEP READING: 10 classic board games that will take you way back\n\nKEEP READING: Scroll to see what the big headlines were the year you were born\n\nLOOK: See how much gasoline cost the year you started driving\n\nTo find out more about how has the price of gas changed throughout the years, Stacker ran the numbers on the cost of a gallon of gasoline for each of the last 84 years.
