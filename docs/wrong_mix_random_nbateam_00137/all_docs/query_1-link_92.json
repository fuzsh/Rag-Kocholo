        "text": "Video arcades seem to be more of a thing of yester-year. We had a few growing up in Yakima like Jolly Joker at the Yakima Mall, we had a place called Mean Machine, there was an arcade at Valley Mall and, of course, growing up in that time they had a video game or two or pinball at just about every mini-mart, restaurant, gas station, laundry mat -- just about everywhere. Because of it's convenient location to me growing up you'd often find me at the little arcade in the back of the old Red Robin.\n\nThough we have places now like Meadowbrook and Seattle has chain arcades like Dave and Busters or Round One, they sometimes play into nostalgia more for the older demographic who grew up with them.\n\nThey still have plenty of arcades around the US, many time doubling as an arcade and bar so you can enjoy food and drink while playing some classic games.\n\nJust about half an hour outside of Portland, Oregon, you'll find Next Level Pinball Shop and Museum.\n\nIt's totally worth checking out if you're in the area.\n\nThis place features 615+ pinball and arcade games, as old as Pong all the way to Mario Kart DX and whatever else is recent, all on free-play with purchase of a wristband which grants you access for an all-day adventure.\n\nAlong with all the games you can play, the entire walls are adorn with classic memorabilia as well. Lunch boxes, toys, classic cereal, and usually themed depending on where you are. The Batman games, for instance, will have lot of Batman toys to look at as well.\n\nThis place is definitely an all-day event.\n\nThey don't serve food but they do have food trucks outside for your convenience. That's very handy.\n\nAlong with the 615+ freeplay games, they also have about 50 games that may cost a dollar that are like crane games or games of chance for your chance to win cool prizes. Those are completely optional.\n\nAs of this past weekend, my all-day wristband was $22. Totally worth it. I explored many games of my childhood, my kids mostly just played the sitdown driving games like Mario Kart, my wife got her money's worth from pinball. I already can't wait to go back.\n\n\"[carbongallery id=\"\"6502391023abb67cc307371f\"\"]\n\n\"\n\n'90s Toys That Spark Instant Childhood Memories\n\nThis '90s nostalgia is sure to make you feel like a kid again.\n\nGallery Credit: Danielle Kootman\n\nLOOK: How Many of These Discontinued Millennial Munchies Do You Remember?\n\nYou'll have better luck paying off your student loans than finding these discontinued snacks in stores.\n\nGallery Credit: Meg Dowdy\n\nLOOK: 35 Vintage Cereals That Perfectly Captured Pop Culture Moments\n\nMovies and TV shows have always found ways to partner with cereal companies as part of their promotion strategy.
