NO DOCUMENTS RELATING TO CONSILIUM ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. 1 8 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER Q: WHY ARE THE TWO COMPANIES PROPOSING TO MERGE? HOW WILL I BENEFIT? A: The Board of Directors of Applied Materials believes, among other things, that: - Consilium is established as a leader in providing semiconductor and electronics manufacturers a way to optimize manufacturing performance; and - the merger will further Applied Materials' continued commitment to customers to improve overall equipment effectiveness and total productivity and will serve Applied Materials' primary business objective of providing Total Solutions(TM) to Applied Materials' customers. The Board of Directors of Consilium believes, among other things, that: - the merger will provide an opportunity for Consilium, as part of the combined company, to compete more effectively in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing industry; - the consideration you will receive in the merger is fair to you and in your best interests, especially in light of the fact that, at the time the parties signed the merger agreement, the market value of Applied Materials common stock to be issued in exchange for Consilium common stock represented a significant premium over the recent price range of Consilium common stock; and - the Applied Materials common stock you will receive in the merger has significantly greater liquidity than Consilium common stock. Q: WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? A: If the merger is completed, you will receive between 0.182 and 0.165 of a share of Applied Materials common stock for each share of Consilium common stock that you own. The actual fraction of a share of Applied Materials common stock that will be issued to you for each share of Consilium common stock you own will be determined by dividing $5.50 by the average of the closing sale price of a share of Applied Materials common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty trading days up to and including the second trading day before the Consilium special meeting. The table below shows, for a range of potential average Applied Materials common stock prices, the fraction of a share of Applied Materials common stock you will receive for each share of Consilium common stock and the implied value of one share of Consilium common stock at those prices:\n\nAVERAGE PRICE IMPLIED PER SHARE OF APPROXIMATE APPLIED VALUE PER SHARE MATERIALS OF CONSILIUM COMMON STOCK EXCHANGE RATIO COMMON STOCK - ------------- -------------- --------------- $23.00 0.182 $4.19 25.00 0.182 4.55 27.00 0.182 4.91 29.00 0.182 5.28 30.25 0.182 5.51 31.84 0.173 5.51 33.43 0.165 5.52 35.00 0.165 5.78 37.00 0.165 6.11 39.00 0.165 6.44\n\nIf the average price of Applied Materials common stock drops below $30.25, you will still receive no more than 0.182 of a share of Applied Materials common stock for each share of Consilium common stock you own; similarly, if the average price of Applied Materials common stock exceeds $33.43, you will receive no less than 0.165 of a share of Applied Materials common stock for each share of Consilium common stock you own, except as provided below. The fact that the maximum exchange ratio is 0.182 regardless of the market price of Applied Materials common stock at closing means that there is no guarantee as to the value of the consideration to be received by Consilium stockholders in the merger. It is possible that, if Consilium issues shares of its stock or grants stock options before the effective time of the merger such that the \"fully-diluted capitalization\" of Consilium (i.e., the sum of the number of shares of Consilium common stock outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger) is greater than 12,798,447, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to take such new shares into 2 9 account. In that case, the exchange ratio could be lower than 0.165. As of October 22, 1998, the \"fully-diluted capitalization\" of Consilium was 12,434,894. Applied Materials will not issue fractions of its shares to you in the merger. Instead, you will receive cash for any fractional Applied Materials shares owed to you upon the merger based on the market value of such shares on a date close to the date of the Consilium special meeting. Example using October 12, 1998 as the Consilium special meeting date and assuming the merger closed on that day: - the average closing price of Applied Materials common stock for the twenty trading days up to and including the second trading day before October 12, 1998 was $24.575. - the exchange ratio would have been 0.182 and would have implied a value of one share of Consilium common stock on that day of approximately $4.47. - if you owned 100 shares of Consilium common stock on that day, then after the merger you would have been entitled to receive 18 shares of Applied Materials common stock and cash in the amount of approximately $4.92. Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document, indicate on your proxy card how you want to vote, and sign and mail the proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at the Consilium special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy card and do not indicate how you want to vote, we will count your proxy card as a vote in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. If you do not vote or you abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the merger agreement and the merger. The Consilium special meeting will take place on , 199 . You may attend the meeting and vote your shares in person, rather than by signing and mailing your proxy card. In addition, you may revoke your proxy card up to and including the day of your stockholders' meeting and vote in person. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CONSILIUM UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER. Q: HOW CAN I DETERMINE THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATIO PRIOR TO VOTING? A: You may call MacKenzie Partners at 1-800-322-2885 for an estimate of the exchange ratio as of a certain date prior to voting. Q: HOW CAN I VOTE OR CHANGE MY PRIOR VOTE AFTER THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATIO IS DETERMINED? A: You may transmit your initial vote or your request to change your vote by facsimile to MacKenzie Partners at (212) 929-0308. Q: IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN \"STREET NAME,\" WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME? A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares according to the directions your broker provides. Without instructions, your broker will not vote your shares. Q: SHOULD I SEND MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW? A: No. After the merger is completed, Applied Materials will send you written instructions for exchanging your share certificates. Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER? A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. In addition to stockholder approvals, we must also obtain regulatory approval. If all necessary approvals are obtained in a timely manner, we hope to complete the merger by the end of calendar year 1998. Q: WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME? A: In most cases, the exchange of shares by you should be tax-free to you for federal income tax purposes. However, you will have to report a taxable gain or loss if you receive cash for fractional shares. To review the tax consequences to you and to Consilium in more detail, see pages 37 through 39. 3 10 WHO CAN HELP ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS If you have additional questions about the merger, you should contact: CONSILIUM, INC. 485 Clyde Avenue Mountain View, California 94043 Attention: Office of Investor Relations Phone Number: (650) 691-6100 APPLIED MATERIALS, INC. 3050 Bowers Avenue Santa Clara, California 95054 Attention: Investor Relations Phone Number: (408) 727-5555 If you have additional questions about Consilium's solicitation of your proxy, you should contact: MACKENZIE PARTNERS, INC. 156 5th Avenue New York, New York 10010 Phone Number: (800) 322-2885 or call collect at (212) 929-5500 4 11 SUMMARY This summary highlights selected information from this document and does not contain all of the information that is important to you.

Applied Materials' customers include semiconductor wafer manufacturers and semiconductor integrated circuit, or \"chip,\" manufacturers. Consilium, Inc. (See page 59) 485 Clyde Avenue Mountain View, CA 94043 (650) 691-6100 Consilium is a leading independent supplier of enterprise-wide, integrated manufacturing execution systems (\"MES\") software and services. Consilium develops, markets and sells a software product line called WorkStream DFS (Distributed Factory System), targeted to help manufacturers, particularly those in the semiconductor and electronics industries, manage production operations on the plant floor. THE CONSILIUM SPECIAL MEETING (SEE PAGE 20) Consilium will hold a special stockholders meeting at its principal executive offices located at 485 Clyde Avenue, Mountain View, California 94043, at 10:00 A.M. on , 199 . At the special meeting, the Consilium Board of Directors will ask Consilium's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. The Consilium Board of Directors believes that the merger is fair to you and in your best interests and unanimously recommends that you vote \"for\" the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger. RECORD DATE; VOTING POWER; VOTE REQUIRED (SEE PAGE 21) Consilium stockholders owning shares as of the close of business on October 12, 1998, the record date, may vote at the Consilium special meeting. On the record date, there were 8,749,973 shares of Consilium common stock allowed to vote at the special meeting. Consilium stockholders will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of Consilium common stock they owned on the record date. A majority of the shares of Consilium common stock outstanding on the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 36) The officers and directors and a significant stockholder of Consilium (who in the aggregate 5 12 held approximately 40.97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Consilium common stock on the record date) have agreed to vote for the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 22) We attach the merger agreement as Appendix A to this document. We encourage you to read the merger agreement. It is the legal document governing the merger. WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 42) Upon closing of the merger, you will have the right to receive between 0.182 and 0.165 of a share of Applied Materials common stock in exchange for each share of Consilium common stock you own. The actual fraction of a share of Applied Materials common stock that will be issued to you for each share of Consilium stock you own will be determined by dividing $5.50 by the average of the closing sale price of a share of Applied Materials common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty trading days up to and including the second trading day before the Consilium special meeting. If the average price is $30.25 or less, then the fraction will be 0.182 and if the average price is $33.43 or more, then the fraction will be 0.165, except as provided below. See \"Risk Factors -- Risks Associated with Exchange Ratio.\" It is possible that, if Consilium issues shares of its stock or grants stock options before the effective time of the merger such that the \"fully-diluted capitalization\" of Consilium (i.e., the sum of the number of shares of Consilium common stock outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger) is greater than 12,798,447, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to take such new shares into account. In that case, the exchange ratio could be lower than 0.165. As of October 22, 1998, the \"fully-diluted capitalization\" of Consilium was 12,434,894. OWNERSHIP OF APPLIED MATERIALS FOLLOWING THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 45) Following the merger, existing Consilium stockholders will own less than one percent of the Applied Materials common stock outstanding (based upon the number of shares of Applied Materials common stock outstanding on October 12, 1998). TREATMENT OF CONSILIUM STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS (SEE PAGE 43 AND 44) At the effective time of the merger, Applied Materials will assume all outstanding Consilium stock options and certain warrants. Each option will be exercisable for Applied Materials common stock on the same terms as the original option, and certain warrants will be exercisable for Applied Materials common stock on the same terms as the original warrants. Certain other warrants will be exercised in accordance with their terms prior to the merger. MARKETS AND MARKET PRICES (SEE PAGE 12) Applied Materials' common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol \"AMAT.\" On October 12, 1998, the last trading day before the announcement that Applied Materials and Consilium entered into the merger agreement, the closing sale price of Applied Materials common stock was reported at $26.813 per share. Following the merger, Applied Materials common stock will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq National market under the symbol \"AMAT.\" On October 27, 1998, the closing sale price of Applied Materials common stock was reported at $31.875. Consilium common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol \"CSIM.\" On October 12, 1998, the closing sale price of Consilium common stock was reported at $1.813 per share. Following the merger, Consilium common stock will no longer be traded on the Nasdaq National Market or on any other exchange. On October 27, 1998, the closing sale price of Consilium common stock was reported at $4.50. The stock prices of both Applied Materials and Consilium can fluctuate broadly even over short periods of time. It is impossible to predict the actual price of Applied Materials or Consilium common stock prior to the effective time of the merger or at any other time. RISK FACTORS (SEE PAGE 14) The merger and an investment in securities of Applied Materials involve certain risks and uncertainties, including risks relating to the integration of Applied Materials and Consilium, risks relating to 6 13 the ability to achieve beneficial synergies, risks associated with the exchange ratio, risks relating to the respective businesses of Applied Materials and Consilium and other risks and uncertainties discussed under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and in the documents incorporated herein by reference. In addition, Applied Materials recently announced the completion of a restructuring plan and other matters that will result in significant one-time charges in its fourth fiscal quarter of 1998. See \"Risk Factors,\" beginning on page 14. MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS (SEE PAGE 37) Consilium and Applied Materials must each receive an opinion from their outside legal counsel that the merger will be a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and that, as a general matter, Consilium stockholders should not be subject to federal income tax as a result of the exchange of Consilium stock in the merger, except if they receive cash for fractional shares. TAX MATTERS ARE COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISORS FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU. The Board of Directors of Consilium believes, among other things, that: - the merger will provide the opportunity for Consilium, as part of the combined company, to compete more effectively in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing industry; - the consideration that you will receive in the merger is fair to you and in your best interest, especially in light of the fact that, at the time the parties signed the merger agreement, the market value of Applied Materials common stock to be issued in exchange for Consilium common stock represented a significant premium over the recent price range of Consilium common stock; and - the Applied Materials common stock that you will receive in the merger has significantly greater liquidity than Consilium common stock. REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 25) The Board of Directors of Applied Materials believes, among other things, that: - Consilium is established as a leader in providing semiconductor and electronics manufacturers a way to optimize manufacturing performance; and - the merger will further Applied Materials' continued commitment to customers to improve overall equipment effectiveness and total productivity and will serve Applied Materials' primary business objective of providing Total Solutions(TM) to Applied Materials' customers. These and other reasons for approving and recommending the merger, as well as negative factors in considering the merger, are explained in greater detail on pages 25 through 28 of this document. FAIRNESS OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE 29) In deciding to approve the merger, the Consilium Board of Directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor, Broadview International LLC, as to the fairness of the exchange ratio to Consilium's stockholders from a financial point of view. Broadview International LLC performed several analyses in connection with delivering its opinion. These analyses included comparing the valuation of publicly traded companies considered comparable to Consilium, comparing premiums paid in comparable public seller transactions, calculating the present value of the potential future price of Consilium Common Stock and an exchange ratio analysis. Consilium has attached the opinion of Broadview International LLC as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. YOU SHOULD READ BROADVIEW INTERNATIONAL LLC'S ENTIRE OPINION CAREFULLY. INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 33) A number of directors and executive officers of Consilium have interests in the merger as employees and/or directors that are different from, or in addition to, your interests. If we complete the merger, Applied Materials will arrange for the continuation of certain indemnification arrangements for directors and officers of Consilium. In addition, certain directors and officers of Consilium will re- 7 14 ceive certain benefits upon completion of the merger, including accelerated vesting of certain stock options pursuant to existing contractual arrangements. Some directors and officers will have the right to receive severance benefits if terminated under certain circumstances within one year after the completion of the merger. Jonathan Golovin plans to enter into a separate agreement with Applied Materials relating to the terms of his employment following the merger. See \"Approval of the Merger and Related Transactions -- Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger,\" page 33. CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 53) We will complete the merger only if a number of conditions, including the following, are satisfied or waived: - continued accuracy of each party's representations and warranties and fulfillment of each party's promises contained in the merger agreement; - adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by Consilium stockholders holding at least a majority of Consilium shares allowed to vote at the special meeting; - delivery by each Party's independent accountants of letters addressing the appropriateness of \"pooling of interests\" accounting treatment; - delivery by each Party's attorneys of opinions addressing certain federal income tax consequences of the merger; - no material adverse change having occurred to Consilium; and - expiration of the period within which the government should notify Consilium and Applied Materials of any antitrust issues concerning the merger. TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 57) Consilium and Applied Materials can agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time without completing the merger. Additionally, Consilium or Applied Materials may terminate the merger agreement under various circumstances, including if: - the merger is not completed by March 31, 1999; - a court permanently prohibits the merger; or - the Consilium stockholders do not approve the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting. Further, Consilium may terminate the merger agreement if Applied Materials' representations and warranties were at the time the merger agreement was signed, or become before the closing, inaccurate and cannot be corrected, and the result is that a condition to Consilium's closing the merger cannot be satisfied. Applied Materials may terminate the merger agreement if Consilium's representations and warranties were at the time the merger agreement was signed, or become before the closing, inaccurate and cannot be corrected, and the result is that a condition to Applied Materials' closing the merger cannot be satisfied. Applied Materials may also terminate the merger agreement if Consilium's board of directors takes certain actions (such as withdrawing its recommendation of the merger), or fails to take certain actions (such as failing to reject another offer), in connection with the merger. TERMINATION FEES (SEE PAGE 58) Under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving the announcement by a third party (other than Applied Materials) of its desire to acquire Consilium, the merger agreement may require Consilium to pay to Applied Materials a termination fee of $1,000,000. If Consilium enters into an acquisition or certain other business transactions with a third party (other than Applied Materials) within 360 days after payment of the $1,000,000 termination fee referred to above, the merger agreement may require Consilium to pay to Applied Materials an additional $1,000,000. REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE 40) U.S. and German antitrust laws prohibit us from completing the merger until we have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the German anticompetition authority and a required waiting period has expired. Applied Materials and Consilium have each filed the required notification and report forms with the Federal Trade Commission and, the Antitrust Division, and are preparing to file with the German anticompetition authority by early November. Even if the required waiting periods expire, the Antitrust Division, Federal Trade Com- 8 15 mission and German anticompetition authority continue to have the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before or after we complete the merger. We cannot predict whether we will obtain all required regulatory approvals for the merger, or whether any approvals will include conditions that would be detrimental to Applied Materials or Consilium. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 39) We expect the merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests, which means that we will treat our companies as if they had always been combined for accounting and financial reporting purposes. 9 16 APPLIED MATERIALS SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n\nNINE MONTHS ENDED YEAR ENDED(1) ----------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- JULY 27, JULY 26, 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1997 1998 ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA: Net sales............................ $1,080,047 $1,659,807 $3,061,881 $4,144,817 $4,074,275 $2,793,879 $3,368,492 Gross margin......................... $ 475,684 $ 768,295 $1,409,848 $1,949,739 $1,900,925 $1,284,569 $1,578,119 (% of net sales)................... 44.0 46.3 46.0 47.0 46.7 46.0 46.8 Research, development and engineering........................ $ 140,161 $ 189,126 $ 329,676 $ 481,394 $ 567,612 $ 392,345 $ 518,310 (% of net sales)................... 13.0 11.4 10.8 11.6 13.9 14.0 15.4 Marketing, selling and administrative..................... $ 174,529 $ 239,932 $ 386,240 $ 539,694 $ 566,595 $ 402,221 $ 463,154 (% of net sales)................... 16.2 14.4 12.6 13.0 13.9 14.4 13.7 Income from consolidated companies before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change(2)............ $ 153,558 $ 334,497 $ 698,543 $ 922,436 $ 798,921 $ 521,792 $ 632,774 (% of net sales)................... 14.2 20.2 22.8 22.3 19.6 18.7 18.8 Effective tax rate (%)(3)............ 33.0 35.0 35.0 35.0 37.6 39.0 34.0 Net income........................... $ 99,695 $ 220,696 $ 454,053 $ 559,585 $ 498,474 $ 318,339 $ 417,631 Earnings per diluted share........... $ 0.30 $ 0.65 $ 1.28 $ 1.63 $ 1.32 $ 0.85 $ 1.10 Weighted average number of diluted shares (in thousands).............. 329,176 340,084 354,696 367,214 377,838 375,540 378,808 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND OTHER DATA: Order backlog........................ $ 365,800 $ 715,200 $1,508,800 $1,422,800 $1,721,711 $1,648,443 $1,000,356 Working capital...................... $ 395,388 $ 734,104 $1,449,882 $1,757,842 $2,368,269 $1,814,156 $2,525,833 Current ratio........................ 2.0 2.5 2.7 2.9 2.7 2.5 3.4 Long-term debt....................... $ 121,076 $ 209,114 $ 279,807 $ 275,485 $ 623,090 $ 228,905 $ 611,812 Stockholders' equity................. $ 598,762 $ 966,264 $1,783,503 $2,370,425 $2,942,171 $2,673,599 $3,260,203 Book value per share................. $ 1.86 $ 2.87 $ 4.97 $ 6.58 $ 8.01 $ 7.33 $ 8.87 Total assets......................... $1,120,152 $1,702,665 $2,965,379 $3,637,987 $5,070,766 $4,249,419 $5,039,756 Capital expenditures, net............ $ 95,351 $ 180,440 $ 265,557 $ 452,535 $ 339,364 Regular full-time employees.......... 4,739 6,497 10,537 11,403 13,924\n\n- --------------- (1) Applied Materials' fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each year. The fiscal year ends for the periods presented are: October 31, 1993, October 30, 1994, October 29, 1995, October 27, 1996 and October 26, 1997. (2) Fiscal 1996 includes a restructuring charge of $25,100. Fiscal 1997 includes bad debt expense of $16,318, acquired in-process research and development expense of $59,500 and pre-tax income from litigation settlements of $69,000. The nine months ended July 27, 1997 includes bad debt expense of $16,318, acquired in-process research and development expense of $59,500, and income from a litigation settlement of $80,000. The nine months ended July 26, 1998 includes a restructuring charge of $35,000, acquired in-process research and development expense of $32,227, and income from a litigation settlement of $80,000. (3) The tax rate for fiscal 1997 and the nine months ended July 27, 1997 was higher than the expected rate of 35 percent due to the non-deductible nature of acquired in-process research and development expense of $59,500. The tax rate for the nine months ended July 26, 1998 is 34% due to several factors, including a shift in geographic composition of pre-tax income to entities operating in countries with lower tax rates and the enactment of favorable tax legislation in certain jurisdictions in which Applied Materials has significant operations. 10 17 CONSILIUM SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n\nNINE MONTHS YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31 ENDED JULY 31, ----------------------------------------------- ----------------- 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1997 1998 ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA: Total revenues................................... $28,475 $27,944 $33,125 $38,147 $40,635 $30,574 $24,204 Income (loss) before taxes....................... $(4,973) $(5,523) $ 664 $(2,485) $(8,463) $(5,981) $ (362) Provision for income taxes....................... $ 310 $ 725 $ 523 $ 974 $ 301 $ 262 $ 175 Net income (loss)................................ $(5,283) $(6,248) $ 141 $(3,459) $(8,764) $(6,243) $ (537) Net income (loss) attributable to common stock... $(5,283) $(6,248) $ 141 $(3,459) $(9,069) $(6,243) $(1,375) Net income (loss) per common share Basic.......................................... $ (0.75) $ (0.85) $ 0.02 $ (0.44) $ (1.13) $ (0.78) $ (0.16) Diluted........................................ $ (0.75) $ (0.85) $ 0.02 $ (0.44) $ (1.13) $ (0.78) $ (0.16) Shares used in per share calculations Basic.......................................... 7,025 7,362 7,567 7,804 8,045 7,974 8,503 Diluted........................................ 7,025 7,362 7,912 7,804 8,045 7,974 8,503\n\n- ---------------\n\nAS OF OCTOBER 31 AS OF JULY 31, ----------------------------------------------- ----------------- 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1997 1998 ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DATA: Working capital (deficit)........................ $12,571 $ 7,345 $ 9,012 $ 3,691 $(2,067) $(1,566) $ 3,689 Total assets..................................... $31,643 $26,998 $28,668 $28,993 $29,967 $29,659 $23,673 Long-term debt, less current portion............. $ 313 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ 1,833 Stockholders' equity............................. $18,836 $13,646 $15,383 $13,337 $ 8,431 $ 7,103 $ 8,333\n\n11 18 MARKET PRICE DATA AND DIVIDEND POLICY Applied Materials common stock began trading on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol \"AMAT\" on October 5, 1972.

Applied Materials has never paid cash dividends on its Common Stock. The policy of Applied Materials is to retain earnings for use in its business. On October 12, 1998 (the record date), there were approximately 5,817 record holders of Applied Materials common stock and approximately 212 record holders of Consilium common stock. Consilium has never paid cash dividend on its common stock. The policy of Consilium is to retain earnings for use in its business. The following table sets forth the closing sale price per share of Applied Materials common stock on the Nasdaq National Market and the estimated equivalent per share price (as explained below) of Consilium common stock on October 12, 1998, the last trading day before the public announcement of the proposed merger, and on October 27, 1998:\n\nAPPLIED MATERIALS ESTIMATED EQUIVALENT CONSILIUM COMMON STOCK PER SHARE PRICE ----------------- ------------------------------ October 12, 1998................................. $26.813 $4.880 October 27, 1998................................. $31.875 $5.800\n\nThe estimated equivalent per share price of a share of Consilium common stock represents 0.182 of the price of a share of Applied Materials common stock. 0.182 is the fraction of a share of Applied Materials common stock that you would have had the right to receive if the Consilium special meeting had taken place on October 12, 1998, when the average closing price of Applied Materials common stock for the twenty trading days up to and including the second trading day before October 12, 1998, was $24.575. The actual fraction of Applied Materials common stock that you will have the right to receive if the merger closes may be different than this fraction because the average closing price on the Nasdaq National Market for Applied Materials common stock fluctuates continuously. 12 19 YOU SHOULD GET A CURRENT MARKET QUOTATION FOR APPLIED MATERIALS COMMON STOCK AND COMPARE IT TO THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR APPLIED MATERIALS COMMON STOCK USED IN THIS TABLE AND IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 12. COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA The following table sets forth certain historical per share data of Applied Materials and Consilium and certain equivalent Consilium per share data. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

These statements relate to future events or the future financial performance of Applied Materials and Consilium. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" or \"continue\" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements only reflect management's expectations and estimates and estimates. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks outlined below. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. We are not undertaking any obligations to update any forward-looking statements contained in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus to reflect any future events or developments. The following factors should be considered carefully by the Consilium stockholders in evaluating whether to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. These factors should be considered in conjunction with any additional risk factors in documents incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any other information included on incorporated by reference herein, including in conjunction with forward-looking statements made herein. See \"Where You Can Find More Information\" on page 1. RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO INTEGRATION After the merger, Applied Materials and Consilium, each of which previously operated independently, will have to integrate their operations. The integration will require significant efforts from each company, including the coordination of their research and development and sales and marketing efforts. Applied Materials may find it difficult to integrate the operations of Consilium. Consilium personnel may leave Consilium because of the merger. Consilium customers, distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements with Consilium, or demand amended terms to these arrangements. Applied Materials management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate the two companies. Such diversion of management's attention or difficulties in the transition process could have an adverse impact on Applied Materials. If Applied Materials is not able to successfully integrate the operations of Consilium, Applied Materials' expectations for its future results of operations may not be met. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE BENEFICIAL SYNERGIES The managements of Applied Materials and Consilium have entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in beneficial synergies. Achieving these anticipated synergies and the potential benefits underlying the two companies' reasons for the merger will depend on a number of factors, some of which include: - Consilium's ability to timely develop new products and to ensure that the products it offers to its customers, as well as software, systems and products received from suppliers and used internally, are Year 2000 compliant; - The risk that Consilium's customers may defer purchasing decisions following the announcement of the merger; - The risk that it may be more difficult to retain Consilium's key management, marketing and technical personnel after the merger; - Potential severance payment liabilities and acceleration of stock options following certain officers' termination of employment with Consilium; - Potential contingent liabilities, including unasserted contingent liabilities arising from the divestiture of Consilium's FlowStream line of products; 14 21 - The ability of the combined company to increase sales of Consilium products, especially in Asia; and - The ability of the combined company to increase sales of Applied Materials' products. Even if the two companies are able to integrate operations, there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies will be achieved. The failure to achieve such synergies could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCHANGE RATIO As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of Consilium common stock will be converted into the right to receive between 0.182 and 0.165 of a share of Applied Materials common stock. The exact fraction of a share of Applied Materials common stock that will be issued to you for each share of Consilium stock you own will be determined by dividing $5.50 by the average of the closing sale price of a share of Applied Materials common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty trading days up to and including the second trading day before the Consilium special meeting. We cannot assure that the market price of Applied Materials common stock upon and after the consummation of the merger will not be lower or higher than the average closing price of such stock for the twenty trading days up to and including the second trading day before the Consilium special meeting. If the average price of Applied Materials common stock drops below $30.25, you will still receive no more than 0.182 of a share of Applied Materials common stock for each share of Consilium common stock you own; similarly, if the average price of Applied Materials common stock exceeds $33.43, you will receive no less than 0.165 of a share of Applied Materials common stock for each share of Consilium common stock you own. It is possible that, if Consilium issues shares of its common stock or options before the effective time of the merger such that the \"fully-diluted capitalization\" of Consilium (i.e., the sum of the number of shares outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger) is greater than 12,798,447, the exchange ratio may be lower than 0.165. As of October 22, 1998, the \"fully- diluted capitalization\" of Consilium was 12,434,894. Because Consilium and Applied Materials have agreed to the exchange ratio described above, the value received by Consilium stockholders for each share of Consilium common stock will depend on the average closing price of Applied Materials common stock at the time immediately before completion of the merger. The following table shows certain average prices for Applied Materials common stock and the implied value paid by Applied Materials for each share of Consilium common stock upon completion of the merger.\n\nAVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE IMPLIED APPROXIMATE VALUE PER OF APPLIED MATERIALS SHARE OF CONSILIUM COMMON STOCK EXCHANGE RATIO COMMON STOCK - ----------------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- $23.00 0.182 $4.19 25.00 0.182 4.55 27.00 0.182 4.91 29.00 0.182 5.28 30.25 0.182 5.51 31.84 0.173 5.51 33.43 0.165 5.52 35.00 0.165 5.78 37.00 0.165 6.11 39.00 0.165 6.44\n\nIn recent years, and particularly in recent months, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of Applied Materials common stock. The value of Applied Materials common stock at the time of the special meeting, the date of completion of the merger, the date that Consilium stockholders receive shares of Applied Materials common stock, the date that stockholders eventually sell Applied Materials shares or at any other time, may 15 22 be significantly different than the price of Applied Materials common stock today. The fact that the maximum exchange ratio is 0.182 regardless of the market price of Applied Materials common stock at closing means that there is no guarantee as to the value of the consideration to be received by Consilium stockholders in the merger. See \"Market Price Data and Dividends Policy\" on page 12 for a table showing the recent volatility of the market price of Applied Materials common stock. Consilium stockholders should obtain recent market quotations for Applied Materials common stock and Consilium common stock and understand the exchange ratio being offered in the merger. RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF CONSILIUM COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER Following the merger, holders of Consilium common stock outstanding on the date of the merger's completion will become holders of Applied Materials common stock. Certain differences exist between the rights of Consilium stockholders under Consilium's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Consilium's bylaws and the rights of Applied Materials stockholders under Applied Materials' Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Applied Materials' bylaws. See \"Comparison of Rights of Holders of Applied Materials Common Stock and Holders of Consilium Common Stock.\" RISKS RELATING TO APPLIED MATERIALS' BUSINESS INDUSTRY VOLATILITY The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and subject to sudden and sharp changes in supply and demand. The timing, length and severity of these cycles are difficult to predict. During periods of reduced and declining demand, Applied Materials must be able to quickly and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of rapid growth, Applied Materials must be able to acquire and/or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and hire and assimilate an adequate number of qualified people. We cannot assure you that Applied Materials can align its costs structure quickly, motivate or retain its key employees, acquire or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity or assimilate enough qualified people. In response to the current industry downturn, Applied Materials has taken a number of actions intended to align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions. Most recently, on October 23, 1998, Applied Materials announced the completion of a restructuring plan and certain non-recurring charges. Applied Materials: - eliminated approximately 2,000 positions, or 15 percent of the company's global workforce in August 1998; - expects to incur charges of approximately $50 million for employee severance and benefits and an additional $50 million for consolidation of facilities and related fixed assets; - will record a $65 million reserve regarding a doubtful receivable obtained in connection with the settlement of patent litigation with ASM International N.V.; - will record, in its fourth fiscal quarter of 1998, an after-tax charge of approximately $50 million associated with the discontinuance of operations of its 50-50 joint venture, Applied Komatsu Technology, Inc. (\"AKT\"); and - will record a $70 million pre-tax write-down of intangible assets that are deemed to be impaired. As a result of non-recurring charges of $285 million associated with the restructuring plan and other events, Applied Materials expects to incur a net loss for its fourth fiscal quarter ending October 25, 1998. Also, during the third fiscal quarter of 1998, Applied Materials completed a voluntary separation plan and developed plans to consolidate certain facilities, which resulted in a restructuring charge of $35 million for the third fiscal quarter of 1998. Applied Materials has also significantly restricted new hiring and utilized mandatory shutdown days in an effort to reduce costs. There can be no assurance that Applied Materials will achieve the objectives of these cost reduction programs. 16 23 INDUSTRY OVERCAPACITY AND DEMAND SHIFTS IN THE PC INDUSTRY The semiconductor industry is currently characterized by excess production capacity for the majority of device types, which has caused semiconductor manufacturers to further decrease their capital spending. In the personal computer market, a shift in demand from more expensive, high performance products to lower-priced products (sub-$1,000 personal computers) has resulted in reduced profitability for semiconductor manufacturers. As a result, customers have delayed or decreased their purchases of Applied Materials' products. Continued overcapacity and strengthening demand for sub-$1,000 personal computers could cause further delays or decreased demand for Applied Materials' products. ASIAN ECONOMIES Asian countries, particularly Japan and Korea, continue to experience banking, currency and other difficulties that are contributing to economic slowdowns or recessions in those countries. The region does not appear to be responding quickly to significant efforts to stimulate its economies. If Asian economies remain stagnant or continue to deteriorate, capital investment by Asian customers could decrease from current levels. With the onset of these negative economic and industry conditions, customers in Japan and Korea have canceled or delayed a significant amount of orders for Applied Materials' products in fiscal 1998 and may cancel or delay additional orders in the future. New orders and net sales to customers located in Asian countries for the third fiscal quarter of 1998 were 44 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of Applied Materials' totals. GLOBAL BUSINESS Applied Materials sells systems and provides services to customers located throughout the world. Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with cultural diversities and organizational alignment. Moreover, each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Although international markets provide Applied Materials with significant growth opportunities, periodic economic downturns, trade balance issues, political instability and fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates are all risks that could affect global product and service demand. APPLIED KOMATSU TECHNOLOGY, INC. JOINT VENTURE Applied Materials currently has a 50 percent ownership interest in AKT, a joint venture corporation that develops thin film transistor manufacturing systems for Active-Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (\"AMLCD\"s). Applied Materials announced that it will record, in its fourth fiscal quarter of 1998, an approximate $50 million after-tax charge associated with the discontinuance of operations of AKT. This charge will consist primarily of severance and benefit costs related to job eliminations, facilities and asset write-offs and other charges. However, Applied Materials cannot assure you that the actual costs of discontinuing AKT's operations will not exceed $50 million. BACKLOG Applied Materials' backlog was $1.0 billion as of July 26, 1998, compared to $1.4 billion as of April 26, 1998 and $1.6 billion as of January 25, 1998. Applied Materials schedules production of its systems based upon order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog includes only orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedule and cancellation of orders, Applied Materials' backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. A reduction of backlog during any 17 24 particular period could have a material and adverse effect on Applied Materials' business, financial condition and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO \"YEAR 2000\" COMPLIANCE Applied Materials has an initiative in place to address certain Year 2000 issues. Applied Materials has a formal Year 2000 Program Office focusing on four key readiness areas: (1) Internal Infrastructure Readiness, addressing internal hardware and software and non-information technology systems; (2) Supplier Readiness, addressing the preparedness of those suppliers providing material incorporated into Applied Materials' products; (3) Product Readiness, addressing product functionality; and (4) Customer Readiness, addressing customer support and transactional activity. For each readiness area, Applied Materials is systematically performing a global risk assessment, conducting testing and remediation (renovation and implementation), developing contingency plans to mitigate unknown risk, and communicating with employees, suppliers, customers and other third party business partners to raise awareness of the Year 2000 problem. - Internal Infrastructure Readiness Program. Applied Materials, assisted by a third party, has completed an inventory of internal applications and computer hardware and has commenced work on remediation strategies and testing. Some software applications have been made Year 2000 compliant, and resources have been assigned to address other applications based on their criticality and the time required to make them Year 2000 compliant. All software remediation is scheduled to be completed no later than July 1999. The Year 2000 compliance evaluation of hardware, including hubs, routers, telecommunication equipment, workstations and other items, is nearing completion. In addition to applications and information technology hardware, Applied Materials is testing and developing remediation plans for embedded systems, facilities and other operations, such as financial and banking systems. - Supplier Readiness Program. This program focuses on minimizing the risks associated with suppliers in two areas: (a) a supplier's business capability to continue providing products and services; and (b) a supplier's product integrity. Applied Materials has identified and contacted key suppliers based on their relative risks in these two areas. To date, Applied Materials has received responses from the majority of its key suppliers, most of which indicate that the suppliers are in the process of developing remediation plans. Based on Applied Materials' assessment of each supplier's progress to adequately address the Year 2000 issue, Applied Materials will develop a supplier action list and contingency plans. Supplier readiness issues that potentially affect Applied Materials' product retrofit program discussed below are targeted to be addressed by December 1998. - Product Readiness Program. This program focuses on identifying and resolving Year 2000 issues existing in Applied Materials' products. The program encompasses a number of activities including testing, evaluation, engineering, and manufacturing implementation. Applied Materials has adopted the Sematech Year 2000 Readiness Testing Scenarios as the baseline for product testing. Customers are being notified of known risk areas and proposed remediation plans. Applied Materials plans to make Year 2000 retrofits available to customers during the first calendar quarter of 1999, and to have retrofits installed in the field by June 1999. A contingency team will be available after June 1999 to assist customers experiencing difficulties with Applied Materials' products. - Customer Readiness Program. This program focuses on customer support, including the coordination of retrofit activity, testing existing customer electronic transaction capability, and developing contingency plans where appropriate. Applied Materials is in the process of developing this program. Applied Materials estimates that total Year 2000 costs will range from $30 million to $50 million, the majority of which will be incurred during the next five fiscal quarters. Applied Materials is continuing its assessments and developing alternatives that will necessitate refinement of this estimate over time. There can be no assurance, however, that there will not be a delay in, or increased costs associated with, the programs described in this section. 18 25 Since the programs described in this section are ongoing, Applied Materials has not yet identified all potential Year 2000 complications nor completed all remediation actions. Therefore, Applied Materials cannot determine the potential impact of these complications and contingencies on Applied Materials' financial condition and results of operations at this time. If computer systems used by Applied Materials or its suppliers, or the software applications used in systems manufactured and sold by Applied Materials (including applications used in Consilium's products), fail or experience significant difficulties related to the Year 2000, the failure or difficulties could materially and adversely affect Applied Materials' results of operations and financial condition. FOREIGN CURRENCY Significant operations of Applied Materials are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily Japanese yen. Applied Materials actively manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, but there can be no assurance that future changes in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a material and adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition. EURO CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between each of their existing sovereign currencies and the Single European Currency (euro). The participating countries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date. Applied Materials is currently evaluating issues raised by the introduction of the euro as scheduled. Applied Materials expects that its relevant internal systems will be euro capable by January 1, 1999, and does not expect the costs of system modifications to be material. Applied Materials also expects that the introduction and use of the euro will not materially and adversely affect Applied Materials' results of operations. Applied Materials will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction. However, there can be no assurance that Applied Materials' systems will be euro capable by January 1, 1999, or that costs to comply will not be material. HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE Applied Materials operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes. Applied Materials' competitive advantage and future success depend on its ability to develop new products and: - develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services. - introduce new products to the marketplace on a timely basis; - qualify new products with its customers; and - commence production to meet customer demands. New products include those for production of 300mm technology and 0.25 micron and below devices. The introduction of new technology and products grows increasingly complex over time. If Applied Materials does not develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 1998, Applied Materials announced that it will record a $70 million pre-tax write-down of intangible assets related to certain purchased technology. This write-off is due to reduced demand resulting from significant changes in business conditions and rapid changes in technology, which in combination have decreased the realizable value of this technology. 19 26 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION Applied Materials and certain of its subsidiaries are currently involved in litigation regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust and other matters and could become involved in additional litigation in the future. Applied Materials from time to time receives and makes inquiries with regard to possible patent infringement, and is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future litigation or patent infringement inquiries. RISKS RELATING TO CONSILIUM'S BUSINESS Consilium's business is subject to numerous risks, including risks related to: - Consilium's past operating losses; - Consilium's dependence on the semiconductor industry and that industry's current downturn and volatility; - Consilium's dependence on its single \"WorkStream\" line of products; - Consilium's dependence on key vendors for the development of its systems integration services business and management of systems integration projects; - Consilium's dependence on international sales; - Consilium's history of financial covenant breaches with respect to its bank credit facilities; - the rapid technological changes characteristic of the industry and the need for new product development on a timely basis; - product defects associated with any new products; - Consilium's dependence on its key personnel; - failure to integrate or reap the benefits of its acquisitions; - competition in the industry; - concentration of Consilium's product revenues in a small number of customers; - the high average selling price of Consilium's products and the lengthy sales cycle; - quarterly fluctuations in operating results; - challenges to Consilium's proprietary rights; and A full discussion of these risks and other risks associated with Consilium's business may be found in Consilium's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-44743), Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 1997 and Consilium's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended January 31, 1998, April 30, 1998 and July 31, 1998. THE CONSILIUM SPECIAL MEETING DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING This Proxy Statement/Prospectus is being furnished to stockholders of Consilium as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Consilium Board of Directors for use at a special meeting of stockholders to be held on , 199 at 10:00 AM, local time, at the principal executive offices of Consilium located at 485 Clyde Avenue, Mountain View, California, or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. This Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first being mailed to Consilium stockholders on or about , 199 . 20 27 PURPOSE OF THE CONSILIUM SPECIAL MEETING The purpose of the Consilium special meeting is to vote upon a proposal to adopt and approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of October 12, 1998 among Consilium, Applied Materials and a wholly owned subsidiary of Applied Material (\"Merger Sub\"), and to approve the merger of Merger Sub with and into Consilium. RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES The close of business on October 12, 1998 has been fixed by the Consilium Board of Directors as the record date (the \"Record Date\") for determination of the stockholders of Consilium entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Consilium special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Consilium special meeting. Holders of record of the Consilium common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Consilium special meeting. As of the Record Date, there were approximately 212 stockholders of record holding an aggregate of approximately 8,749,973 shares of Consilium common stock. See \"Consilium Principal Stockholders.\" Except for the stockholders identified herein under \"Consilium Principal Stockholders,\" as of the Record Date, to the knowledge of Consilium, no other person beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding Consilium common stock. This Proxy Statement/Prospectus was mailed to all Consilium stockholders of record as of the Record Date and constitutes notice of the Consilium special meeting in conformity with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"). VOTING OF PROXIES All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the Consilium special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained therein. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy without indicating any voting instructions, the shares of Consilium common stock that the proxy represents will be voted FOR the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and FOR approval of the merger under the recommendation of the Consilium Board of Directors or FOR adjournment or postponement of the Consilium special meeting if an adjournment or postponement, in the discretion of the proxy holders, is determined to be necessary or desirable. A stockholder who has executed and returned a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted at the Consilium special meeting by (i) executing and returning a proxy bearing a later date, (ii) filing written notice of such revocation with the Corporate Secretary of Consilium stating that the proxy is being revoked, or (iii) attending the Consilium special meeting and voting in person. All written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to revocation of Consilium proxies should be sent to: Consilium, Inc., 485 Clyde Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94043, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Attendance at the Consilium special meeting, in and of itself, will not constitute a revocation of a proxy. See \"Questions and Answers About the Merger -- How Can I Vote or Change My Prior Vote After the Actual Exchange Ratio is Determined\". VOTE REQUIRED Adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger require the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Consilium common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. Each stockholder of record of Consilium common stock on the Record Date is entitled to cast one vote per share, exercisable in person or by properly executed proxy, on each matter properly submitted for the vote of the stockholders of Consilium at the Consilium special meeting. Centennial Associates, L.P. and all of Consilium's directors and executive officers, who own in the aggregate issued and outstanding shares of Consilium common stock representing approximately 40.97% of the shares of Consilium common stock issued and outstanding as of the Record Date, have entered into certain voting agreements dated October 12, 1998 with Applied Materials (the \"Voting Agreements\"), pursuant to which they have agreed that, prior to the earlier of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, they will vote their shares of Consilium common stock in favor of the merger, the adoption and approval of the terms of the merger agreement, and each of the other actions 21 28 contemplated by the merger agreement. See \"Approval of the Merger and Related Transactions -- Voting Agreements.\" QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Consilium common stock entitled to vote at the Consilium special meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum, but will have the effect of a vote against approval of the matters being voted upon. If a broker holding shares in street name returns an executed proxy that indicates that the broker does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares to vote on one or more matters, such shares will be considered represented at the Consilium special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but have the effect of a vote against approval of the matters being voted upon. SOLICITATION OF PROXIES; EXPENSES Regardless of whether Applied Materials and Consilium consummate the merger, each of Consilium and Applied Materials will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except that Consilium and Applied Materials will share equally fees and expenses (other than attorneys' and accounting fees) incurred in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the filing of the premerger notification and report forms relating to the merger under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the rules promulgated thereunder (the \"HSR Act\"). Subject to the foregoing, Consilium will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies and all related costs. In addition, Consilium may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Certain directors, officers or other employees of Consilium may supplement original solicitation of proxies by mail with telephone, facsimile or personal solicitation, without payment of additional compensation. APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the merger are the result of arm's length negotiations between representatives of Applied Materials and representatives of Consilium. Set forth below is a summary of the background of these negotiations. Applied Materials believes that MES shows significant growth potential, as well as strategic synergy with Applied Materials' goal of providing technology that improves customers' productivity and operations. The Board of Directors of Applied Materials believes that Consilium, as a leading independent supplier of MES software and services, provides comprehensive automated factory control solutions for today's integrated circuit and electronics manufacturing organizations and is developing new products for fabs of the future, including 300mm fabs. Applied Materials' Board of Directors expects that Applied Materials with its global infrastructure, especially in Asia, could help Consilium further penetrate its available markets. On July 21, 1998, Kalman Kaufman, Vice President of Applied Materials' Strategic Development and Planning Group, called James Macek, Consilium's then Executive Vice President, to invite Mr. Macek to Applied Materials' offices to discuss generally the possibility of a business relationship between Applied Materials and Consilium. On July 23, 1998, after conferring with Jonathan Golovin, Chairman of the Board and Chief Technical Officer of Consilium, Mr. Macek met with Applied Materials' representatives, i.e. Mr. Kaufman, James C. Morgan, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Maydan, President, Sasson Somekh, Senior Vice President and Ash Munshi, then Vice President, Factory Automation, at the offices of Applied Materials. At the meeting, the possibility of a business relationship between the two companies was discussed. 22 29 After the July 23, 1998 meeting, Mr. Kaufman, invited Laurence Hootnick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Consilium and Michael J. Field, Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Corporate Secretary of Consilium, to breakfast on July 27, 1998. At breakfast on July 27, 1998, with Messrs. Kaufman and Alexander Meyer, Applied Materials Senior Director of New Business Development, Mr. Hootnick raised the possibility of a minority equity investment by Applied Materials in Consilium. Mr. Hootnick also suggested a discussion about an option for Applied Materials to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Consilium. Consequently, at the breakfast meeting, the parties decided that Applied Materials and Consilium should enter into a nondisclosure agreement. That afternoon, the companies entered into a nondisclosure agreement and agreed that more detailed discussions and a more detailed level of exploration of Consilium's business by Applied Materials could commence. On the evening of July 27, 1998, Messrs. Kaufman, Meyer, Hootnick and Field met for dinner. They were joined at dinner by Dr. Somekh. At dinner the parties discussed their respective businesses and the semiconductor industry generally. Mr. Hootnick again raised the issue of a minority investment by Applied Materials in Consilium, as well as the possibility of Applied Materials receiving an option to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Consilium. In addition, the parties discussed the possibility of Applied Materials acquiring all of the outstanding capital stock of Consilium. The parties began for the first time to discuss a possible price for such a transaction, and whether any purchase price would be paid in cash or in Applied Materials common stock. Mr. Hootnick noted to the representatives of Applied Materials that Consilium would be more interested in a stock for stock transaction that would be tax-free to Consilium stockholders. On July 29, 1998, Messrs. Meyer and Kaufman met with Messrs. Hootnick and Field at the offices of Applied Materials for the purpose of discussing the possibility that Applied Materials would acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Consilium. At the meeting, Mr. Kaufman proposed that Applied Materials purchase each outstanding share of Consilium capital stock for a price of between $3.50 and $4.00 per share, to be paid in shares of Applied Materials common stock. Messrs. Hootnick and Field objected to this proposal, noting that Consilium's stock price was undervalued in the marketplace, and advised that they would not recommend the proposal to the Consilium Board of Directors. On August 3, 1998, Mr. Kaufman called Mr. Hootnick to suggest a further meeting. On August 4, 1998, certain executives of both companies met and continued a discussion about price and the expected development of Consilium's business. After extensive discussions, the parties concluded that an acquisition of Consilium by Applied Materials might be possible at a higher price. At this time, Applied Materials asked its outside legal counsel, Cooley Godward LLP, to prepare a due diligence request list. On August 6, 1998, as part of a special meeting of the Consilium Board of Directors, Mr. Hootnick briefed the Board on the discussions between management representatives of Applied Materials and Consilium. Outside counsel reviewed the Board's fiduciary duties in considering a strategic business combination. Consilium management discussed possible risks and benefits from a proposed business combination between Consilium and Applied Materials and reviewed questions and comments from the Board concerning such a combination. Management also outlined Consilium's strategy and direction as an independent company, and the Board discussed other alternatives. After consideration of these discussions, the Consilium Board of Directors authorized management to continue discussions with Applied Materials. For the remainder of August, Applied Materials and Consilium continued to discuss both price and non-price terms of a possible acquisition of Consilium by Applied Materials and Applied Materials continued its investigation of Consilium's business, primarily through review of, publicly available information and discussions with senior management of Consilium. On August 24, 1998, as part of a special meeting of the Consilium Board of Directors, Mr. Hootnick briefed the Board on further discussions between Consilium and Applied Materials management regarding price and other terms of the proposed business combination, and management reviewed with the Board possible benefits and risks of such a combination. After considering these discussions, the Consilium Board of Directors concluded that management should pursue the discussions with Applied Materials. In late August 1998, Consilium requested that Applied Materials sign a 23 30 more comprehensive nondisclosure agreement than the nondisclosure agreement previously signed on July 27, 1998 as a condition to conducting more extensive due diligence, and directed its outside legal counsel, Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP, to prepare such an agreement. On September 2, 1998, Mr. Kaufman made a presentation on the possible acquisition to the Acquisition Subcommittee of the Applied Materials Board of Directors. On September 3, 1998, at a special meeting of the Consilium Board of Directors, Consilium management and outside legal counsel briefed the Consilium Board of Directors on the terms of the proposed standstill and \"no-shop\" agreements. Management and outside legal counsel reviewed with the Board the negotiations on price and non-price terms, and responded to questions and comments from the Board. The Board discussed the possible risks and benefits of the proposed business combination in light of other alternatives available to Consilium, concluded that discussions with Applied Materials should continue and authorized Consilium management to enter into the \"no-shop\" agreement and standstill agreement, subject to satisfactory conclusion of pending negotiations. On September 4, 1998, Dr. Somekh and Mr. Kaufman made a presentation on the possible acquisition to the full Board of Directors, discussing, among other things, Consilium's market leadership position in the field of MES software, the strategic rationale and preliminary terms contemplated for the proposed transaction and potential benefits and risks of an acquisition. Following the presentation, the Board directed the Acquisition Subcommittee to track the progress of the ongoing negotiations and make sure the due diligence was completed. During early September 1998, Applied Materials and Consilium negotiated the terms of a Mutual Nondisclosure and Standstill Agreement and a \"no-shop\" agreement. The \"no-shop\" agreement provided, among other things, that for a period of fourteen days beginning on the date of the first \"all hands\" due diligence meeting involving representatives of Applied Materials and Consilium, Consilium would not solicit, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide information to, a third party (other than Applied Materials) regarding a possible acquisition of Consilium. On September 11, 1998, at a special meeting of the Consilium Board of Directors, management reported to the Consilium Board on negotiations between the parties concerning the terms of the transactio"
