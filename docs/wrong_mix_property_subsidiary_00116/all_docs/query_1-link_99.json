On June 20, Fleming announced new policy deliberately based on Finance Minister Donald rose rose monetary and unem¬ investment, in the appended list of equities, which have and fiscal are 174% but the industry's hourly employment or nearly twice as much. I use 1940 as a starting point rather than 1947 because during the war-affected years of 1940 through 1944, steel wages rose substantially as did the level of wholesale prices; but steel prices increased not at all. Any comparison of these trends which starts with postwar 1947 as a base, there¬ fore, obsctires rather than reveals the realities which the steel companies have had to face throughout this entire period of inflation. \"In dollars and cents, wage-earner employment costs per hour worked increased from 901/2 cents in 1940 to $3.82 in 1960 and far exceeded any productivity gains that could be achieved even though some $15,000,000,000 was invested in new and more efficient plant and equip¬ prices of its current The year 1961 will be remembered as one of considerable turbulence in the monetary profits.

Three Problems The problems that evoked this policy were threefold. First, there was the growing dis¬ quietude about the massive inflow of alien capital. Second, there was concern about the decline of exports and the high volume of productivity) improved by less than 40%, in contrast to the 322% rise in employment cost. Prices at higher competitive levels were the inevitable result. \"Your letter speaks of the uncertainty in the amount of the employment cost increases which will occur at the end of this month, and which (Continued on page 37) imports. And finally, there was an urgent need to provide more jobs at home by stimu¬ lating the economy. Unemployment in the first quarter of 1961 had reached the dis¬ turbing level of 11%. Accordingly the program of Finance Min¬ ister Fleming spelled out: (1) reduction of foreign investors seeking high yields, and encourage internal borrowers; (2) stimulation to industry by cutting the excise tax on automobiles, in¬ creasing depreciation allowances by 50% and providing other tax incentives; (3) driv¬ ing down the price of Canadian currency to increase exports, attract tourists, and pro¬ vide jobs for the unemployed. Further, the Finance Minister predicted a $650 million deficit for the fiscal year that began April 1, 1960. This is roughly equivalent to an Amer¬ ican deficit of around $12 billion. These In were indeed bold measures and in quarters they were far from popular. many particular, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. James E. Coyne, an outspoken of advocate a national austerity program, and of high interest rates to reward savers, found the whole new program most distaste¬ ful; and a great stir was created when gov¬ ernment pressure became so intense as to impel his replacement. So there it is—a Canadian program cated deficit on spending, a predi¬ drifting dollar; determination to have Canadian investors a providing expansion and a dedicated ef¬ employment and enlarge a stronger part in funds for the economy; play fort increase to productivity.
