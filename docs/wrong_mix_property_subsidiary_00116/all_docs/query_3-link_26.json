        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey, Twitter”s co-founder and interim CEO, became the social media company”s permanent leader Monday, ending a tumultuous three-month search.\n\nThe promotion gives Dorsey, ousted from the same job in 2008, a second chance to run a tech firm that has struggled to attract more users and impress Wall Street.\n\nHe also remains the chief executive of Square, a mobile payment company that”s reportedly preparing to go public and is located a block away from Twitter”s San Francisco headquarters.\n\nDorsey started as interim CEO in July shortly after Dick Costolo — facing criticism from investors about the site”s slow user growth and pace of change — stepped down from the position.\n\nBut the company”s board of directors also said it wanted a “full-time commitment” from the new chief executive, apparently signaling that it wouldn”t name Dorsey as CEO if he kept his job at Square.\n\nAt the same time, pressure to fill the position mounted, high-level executives departed and support for Dorsey grew. Twitter”s stock also took a beating, especially in August when it fell below $26 per share, its initial public offering price.\n\nDorsey wasn”t the only candidate the company”s board considered for the job, according to media reports.\n\nTwitter”s revenue chief Adam Bain was also a front runner, but refused to take the position if Dorsey wanted it, according to tech blog Recode, citing anonymous sources. Twitter”s search firm Spencer Stuart also reached out to former Cisco Systems Inc. executive Padmasree Warrior and CBS Interactive Inc.”s Jim Lanzone for the job, Bloomberg reported in August, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAs of June, Twitter had 316 million monthly active users, which is lower than other social media sites including Facebook-owned Instagram. About 4,100 employees worldwide work for Twitter.\n\nThe company raked in $502 million in sales from April to June, beating Wall Street”s expectations, but also reported a net loss of $137 million. Dorsey said in July during the second-quarter earnings call that he”s focused on making the site easier to use, having a more disciplined execution of the rollout of new products and better communicating why people should use Twitter.\n\nStarted in 2006, the microblogging website allows people to “tweet” posts fewer than 140 characters, web links, photos and videos, giving users a glimpse of what”s happening around the world by following people”s accounts.\n\nDorsey helped create the website that year, sending out its first tweet: “just setting up my twttr.”"
