Case Facts: Introduction • Pete Solvik, Cisco Systems ClO, considered the last remaining line item of his ERP implementation budget. • Cisco had a history of rewarding performance with cash bonuses. • The amount allocated for rewarding the ERP team, over $200,000, was unprecedented. • To be sure, they had delivered a lot in a time frame that no one had believed possible It had not been easy either. 7/20/2009 DASMR-Biztel: Cisco-ERP 2\n\n3. Case Facts: Cisco History • Cisco Systems, Inc.: – Founded by two Stanford computer scientists in 1984 – Became publicly traded in 1990. • By 1997, its first year on the Fortune 500, Cisco ranked among the top five companies in return on revenues and return on assets. • On July 17, 1998, Cisco’s market capitalization passed the S100 billion mark (15 times, 1997 sales). • In 1988, Valentine (One of major shareholder) hired John Morgridge as CEO. • Morgridge believed that many Silicon Valley firms decentralized too quickly Loosing Control 7/20/2009 DASMR-Biztel: Cisco-ERP 3\n\n4.

Case Facts: Cisco IT History • Pete Solvik joined Cisco in January 1993 as the company’s new CIO. • At the time, Cisco was a $500 million company running a UNIX-based S/W.

Problems: • Just run over the legacy systems had in place Constantly band-aid existing band- systems. • The systems replacement perpetuated the deterioration of Cisco’s legacy environment. • January of 1994, Cisco’s legacy environment failed so dramatically the company’s systems were on the brink of total failure. 7/20/2009 DASMR-Biztel: Cisco-ERP 6\n\n7. Recommendation: Selecting an ERP Product • Cisco’s realized that implementing ERP would require heavy involvement This could not be an IT-only IT- initiative. • Consistent with the need for a strong Cisco team, the company would also need strong partners KPMG • With KPMG on board, the team turned to the software market with a multi-pronged approach for identifying multi- the best software packages. • The team spent 10 days writing a request for proposals (RFPs) to send to the vendors Oracle win. • Selection of Oracle was based on three of the major decision points: – First, this project was being driven pretty strongly by manufacturing and Oracle had a better manufacturing capability than the other vendor. – Second, they made a number of promises regarding the long-term development of functionality in the long- package. – The other part of it was the flexibility offered by Oracle’s being close by. 7/20/2009 DASMR-Biztel: Cisco-ERP 7"
