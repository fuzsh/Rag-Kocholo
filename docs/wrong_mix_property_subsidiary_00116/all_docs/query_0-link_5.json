Integrating an ...Joachim Neubert\n\nWikidata has been created in order to support all of the roughly 300 Wikipedia projects. Besides interlinking all Wikipedia pages about a specific item – e.g., a person - in different languages, it also connects to more than 1900 different sources of authority information. We will present lessons learned from using Wikidata as a linking hub for two personal name authorities in economics (GND and RePEc author identifiers) and demonstrate the benefits of moving a mapping from a closed environment to Wikidata as a public and community-curated linking hub. We will further ask to what extent these experiences can be transferred to knowledge organization systems and how the limitation to simple 1:1 relationships (as for authorities) can be overcome. Using STW Thesaurus for Economics as an example, we will investigate how we can make use of existing cross-concordances to \"seed\" Wik-idata with external identifiers, and how transitive mappings to yet un-mapped vocabularies can be earned.\n\nBitRot (The silent corruption of data on disk ) detection in GlusterFS (Glust...\n\nBitRot (The silent corruption of data on disk ) detection in GlusterFS (Glust...Gaurav Kumar Garg\n\nBitRot or Data Rot is when file or object sits un-disturb on the disk or unaccess from day by day or month by month or year by year and when you go to your pen drive, hard disk or take out your DVD and you see that you can't access that data because bit have flipped called as BitRot or DataRot. BitRot detection is a technique used to identify certain “insidious” type of disk errors where data is silently corrupted with no indication from the disk to the storage software layer that an error has occurred. With GlusterFS 3.7, its possible to detect corruption caused due to bitrot and take steps to rectify them. When bitrot detection is enabled on a Gluster volume, files are signed after they have been written. A periodic filesystem scrubber verifies the integrity of signed files are flags (or marks) files which have mismatching signature. Corrupted files are typically denied access to clients unless it's a replicated volume where it's still possible to access the \"good\" copy and repair the corrupted file.\n\nSemantic MediaWiki as Knowledge Graph Interface\n\nSemantic MediaWiki as Knowledge Graph InterfaceBernhard Krabina\n\nKnowledge Graph Conference 2021 Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), which was introduced as early as in 2006, has since gone on to establish a vital community and is currently one of the few semantic wiki solutions still in existence. SMW is an extension of MediaWiki, the software used for Wikipedia and many other projects, resulting in a largely sustainable codebase and ecosystem. There are many reasons why SMW should not be overlooked by the knowledge graph community: SMW is capable of directly connecting to several triple stores (Blazegraph, Virtuoso, Jena), which is why it can be considered an interface for entering data into knowledge graphs. SMW can use its internal relational database (or ElasticSearch), enabling users to build simple knowledge graphs without in-depth knowledge about triple stores. SMW has the built-in capability of exporting to RDF including building complete RDF data dumps that can be imported into existing knowledge graphs. SMW has the capability to reuse existing ontologies by importing vocabularies and providing unique identifiers. The explicit semantic content of Semantic MediaWiki is formally interpreted in the OWL DL ontology language and is made available in XML/RDF format. A simple internal query language is available to query the internal knowledge graph from within SMW, without the requirement of having a SPARQL endpoint. However, extensions for implementing SPARQL in SMW are available as well. SMW has the capability to enable data curation for experienced users responsible for the ontology as well as simple form-based input for regular users that can easily populate the KG with data. There are several approaches to visualizing data in SMW, thus making the knowledge graph visible and interactive. Implementing custom ontologies in SMW is quite easy, everything is built-in wiki pages (e.g. definition of properties and datatypes, forms and templates). SMW has low barriers to implementation as it is a clean extension to MediaWiki, which is PHP software running on regular web hosts. In the talk, I will give an overview of the mentioned aspects and highlight some main differences to Wikibase – which is an alternative approach for managing structured data in MediaWiki – as well as the current limitations of SMW.\n\nXWiki: A web dev runtime for writing web apps @ FOSDEM 2014\n\nXWiki: A web dev runtime for writing web apps @ FOSDEM 2014Vincent Massol\n\nWhen developing a web application, the traditional way is to develop the application from scratch using a general purpose language such as PHP, Grails, Play, Java/JSP, etc. This presentation will show that a next generation wiki (examples based on XWiki: http://xwiki.org) can be used as a web development platform to develop applications on top of it, providing a strong infrastructure scaffolding to building web applications. The advantages are similar to those of using an application sever. However whereas an application server offers technical services only, a wiki platform offers higher level services such as content management, rendering, storage, WYSIWYGeditor, user management, and a lot more. Not only are these services offered, you can develop using them in your traditional IDE or in the runtime, directly in wiki pages. This allows developing web applications extremely quickly, collaboratively and with a fast turnaround time, which is perfect for adhoc web application development.\n\nPHIDIAS - Boosting the use of cloud services for marine data management, serv...\n\nPHIDIAS - Boosting the use of cloud services for marine data management, serv...Phidias\n\nDescription and scope of the Project Phidias HPC is aimed at developing a consolidated and shared HPC and Data service by building on pre-existing and emerging infrastructure in order to create a federation of \"user to infrastructure\" services. To achieve its purpose and to gain a comprehensive picture of the European infrastructure landscape, three data area tests will develop and provide new services to discover, manage and process spatial and environmental data produced by research communities tackling scientific challenges such as atmospheric, marine and earth observation issues. Webinar: How to improve the cloud services for marine data Observing the ocean is challenging: missions at sea are costly, different scales of processes interact, and the conditions are constantly changing, which is why scientists say that \"a measurement not made today is lost forever\". For these reasons, it is fundamental to properly store both the data and metadata, so that their access can be guaranteed for the widest community, in line with the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Inter-operable and Reusable. PHIDIAS HPC has organised a webinar entitled \"PHIDIAS: Boosting the use of cloud services for marine management, services and processing\" to be held on 4th June 2020 at 11 AM CEST. The webinar aims to introduce the Phidias HPC initiative, in collaboration with the Blue-Cloud project, to the European HPC and Research community, specifically in the Blue economy, to improve the use of (1) cloud services for marine data management, (2) data services to the user in a FAIR perspective, and (3) data processing on demand. These objectives will be pursued in coherence with the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS).\n\nWeb 3.0 & IoT (English)\n\nWeb 3.0 & IoT (English)Peter Waher\n\nThis talk introduces the concepts of web 3.0 technology and how they relate to related technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Grid Computing and the Semantic Web: • A short history of web technologies: o Web 1.0: Publishing static information with links for human consumption. o Web 2.0: Publishing dynamic information created by users, for human consumption. o Web 3.0: Publishing all kinds of information with links between data items, for machine consumption. • Standardization of protocols for description of any type of data (RDF, N3, Turtle). • Standardization of protocols for the consumption of data in “the grid” (SPARQL). • Standardization of protocols for rules (RIF). • Comparison with the evolution of technologies related to data bases. • Comparison of IoT solutions based on web 2.0 and web 3.0 technologies. • Distributed solutions vs centralized solutions.. • Security • Extensions of Peer-to-peer protocols (XMPP). • Advantages of solutions based on web 3.0 and standards (IETF, XSF). Duration of talk: 1-2 hours with questions.\n\nOld Tools, New Tricks: Unleashing the Power of Time-Tested Testing Tools\n\nOld Tools, New Tricks: Unleashing the Power of Time-Tested Testing ToolsBenjamin Bischoff\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of software development and testing, it is tempting to chase the latest tools and technologies. However, some of the most effective solutions have been in existence for decades. In this talk, we’ll delve into the enduring value of these timeless testing tools. We’ll explore how established tools like Selenium, GNU Make, Maven, and Bash remain vital in today’s software development and testing toolkit even though they have been around for a long time (some were even invented before I was born). I’ll share examples of how these tools have addressed our testing and automation challenges, showcasing their adaptability, versatility, and reliability in various scenarios. I aim to demonstrate that sometimes, the “old” ways can indeed be the best ways.\n\nSAP implementation steps PDF - Zyple Software\n\nSAP implementation steps PDF - Zyple SoftwareZyple Software\n\nUnlock the full potential of your SAP system with our comprehensive SAP Implementation Steps PDF guide!
