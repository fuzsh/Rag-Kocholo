        "text": "Mission Statement\n\nRecognizing the cultural significance of Westfield’s rich historic and architectural heritage, the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC) was established by municipal ordinance in December 1984. The HPC is charged with preserving historical sites and structures while fostering an appreciation for these landmarks as an essential element of the town’s unique character.\n\nThe Commission considers potential sites for historic designation, reviews proposed work on designated historic properties, advises homeowners in planning and designing their construction projects, and submits recommendations to the Planning Board. Additionally, the Harry Devlin Awards program recognizes homeowners for commendable preservation efforts. By preserving Westfield’s legacy, the Historic Preservation Commission strives to protect Westfield's original neighborhoods and provides a valuable link for generations to come.\n\nHPC Overview\n\nTo designate and regulate historic sites and historic districts within the Town consistent with and pursuant to authority granted under the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.\n\nHighly Valued Qualities\n\nWestfield is a compact suburban town with many highly valued qualities - a vibrant pedestrian-oriented downtown, a centrally located train station, tree-lined neighborhoods with handsome houses spaced close enough to be neighborly yet far enough part to provide private yards, dynamic cultural institutions, and public parks and playgrounds. These qualities make Westfield a desirable place to live. It is perhaps less widely understood that many of these valuable features are also historic resources - the product of three centuries of creating home and community in Westfield.\n\nThe Town of Westfield has recognized that there is a public interest in preserving the town's historic resources. The Westfield Historic Preservation Commission is established by municipal ordinance, and have designated a number of historic sites and districts.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nDesign guidelines were written and adopted to assist the Historic Preservation Commission in its review of proposed work on designated history properties and to guide property owners in planning and designing their construction projects. The guidelines are intended to help protect the community's historic buildings and places, to expedite and ensure consistency in local decision-making, and to benefit property owners by clarifying community expectations.\n\nDesignated history sites and districts in Westfield comprise only a small portion of the town's historic buildings and environments. Owners of these residential and commercial properties in Westfield are encouraged to apply these guidelines, as appropriate, when planning repairs, additions, or new construction.\n\n\"Westfield: Then & Now\" Photography Exhibit\n\nIn celebration of National Preservation Month, Westfield’s Historic Preservation Commission and Public Arts Commission have teamed up to host a special photography exhibit at the Center for Creativity at the Rialto, 250 E. Broad Street, throughout May. Titled “Westfield: Then & Now,” the exhibit features vintage photos sourced from the archives of the Westfield Historical Society alongside present-day views of the same scene. The resulting images are a vivid portrait of Westfield’s timeless architectural heritage and enduring community spirit.\n\nAmong the many municipal, commercial and residential sites featured are Arcanum Hall, Elm Street, Mindowaskin Park, and historic neighborhoods including Boulevard, Stoneleigh Park, and Kimball Avenue. In some cases, the image was faithfully recreated using the site’s current occupants. In conjunction with the exhibition, the public is invited to submit their own “Then & Now” photographs for an online display by emailing them to hpc@westfieldnj.gov.\n\nHistoric Preservation Element of the Master Plan\n\nAfter input received during public forums held on October 19 and December 14, 2023, field surveys, research, and collaboration with a steering committee comprised of members of the Historic Preservation Commission and Town Staff, the Historic Preservation Element of the Town Master Plan has been prepared by the consulting team of H2M Associates, Inc. and Easton Architects and is available for review. Funded by a grant from the New Jersey Historic Trust, the the project will result in the update of the 2002 Historic Preservation Element of the Town Master Plan.\n\nAdditional input has come from the Planning Board who reviewed a draft at their February 5, 2024 meeting and provided comments to the consulting team. The Historic Preservation Commission also reviewed thedraft at their February 26, 2024 meeting and provided comments.\n\nThe final draft was then prepared after receiving these comments from the Planning Board, Historic Preservation Commission, and also members of the public. A public hearing was held at the April 1, 2024 meeting of the Planning Board, at which time the the Historic Preservation Element's was adopted.\n\nA copy of the final draft of the Historic Preservation Element of the Town Master Plan may be found here.\n\n.\n\nMeetings\n\n7:30 pm\n\nFourth Monday of every month\n\nMunicipal Building\n\n425 E Broad Street\n\nCouncil Chambers\n\nWestfield, NJ 07090\n\nAgendas & Minutes\n\nAgendas are available prior to the meetings.
