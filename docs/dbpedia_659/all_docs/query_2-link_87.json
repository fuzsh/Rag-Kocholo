        "text": "Fact Sheet\n\nWe're Proud of What We've Accomplished Since 1969\n\n1. The Museum and Archives - Located on the second floor of the Town Hall we have established the Town's only repository of Westfield lore.

Instilling a sense of local heritage and roots to Westfield residents and school children is a major focus of our education initiative. We assist the schools in preparing a prospectus and textbook on local history for third graders, provide speakers to school classes, conduct historic tours, host visits to the museum and archives, and produce programs for the public to highlight local history in an accurate, yet entertaining, manner.\n\n6. Support for important historic activities. One of the earliest accomplishments of the Society was to assist the Miller-Cory Volunteers with its purchase of the historic Miller-Cory House at 614 Mountain Avenue. The circa-1740 house is operated as a living museum. The Westfield Historical Society has also made contributions to the rehabilitation of the Revolutionary Cemetery, the restoration of the Town Clock, the structural restoration of the Presbyterian Church steeple, and the replacement of the Boulevard areas historic mosaic street signs. We also oversee the storage and maintenance of the Town Bell which the Society arranges to display at all important Town functions and parades. Additionally, the Society played a key role in the Town's gala Bicentennial Celebration throughout 1994 and assisted the group which provided a memorial plaque for those from Westfield who lost their lives fighting in World War II. Our role in that effort will continue as we maintain the records in our archives.\n\n7. The Society has supported the Town's historic preservation movement, lobbying both to get an ordinance passed in 1982 and later strengthened. Members of the Society serve on Westfield's Historic Preservation Commission.\n\n8. The Society has been responsible for a variety of publications related to the history of the Town (books, historical maps, aerial sketches and a series of postcards of old Westfield) all of which are available for purchase at various places around town.\n\n· Guide to the Colonial Cemetery of the Presbyterian Church in Westfield, New Jersey by Herbert A. Halsey, 1987.\n\n· \"The Olde Town, 1740-1800,\" a map showing locations and original owners of Westfield's 18th century houses.\n\n· \"Aerial sketch of Westfield circa 1882,\" drawn by T.M. Fowler.\n\n· \"Aerial sketch of Westfield, N.J. in 1903,\" drawn by T.J. Hughes.\n\n· \"Aerial sketch of Westfield, N.J. in 1929,\" drawn by Hughes and Cinquin.\n\n· \"Map of Westfield circa 1906,\" by Jacob Bauer, Union County engineer.\n\n· Set of six postcards - photographs of old Westfield\n\n9. We are particularly proud of the birthday gift we presented to the Town when we sponsored Westfield Heritage Day for the Town of Westfield to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the founding of the Westfield Historical Society. Activities included demonstrations of tinsmithing and colonial cooking at the Miller-Cory House Museum, walking tours of Stoneleigh Park, antique cars on view, a series of walking tours (1. Presbyterian Green and Revolutionary Cemetery, 2. Elm Street, and 3. Broad Street), two Civil War Military units that provided drilling and musket firing demonstrations, continuous musical entertainment, and horse drawn carriage rides.\n\nWe Look Forward to An Exciting and Productive Future\n\nAlthough we do not know exactly what future items we will produce or what activities we will be supporting, we do know that the challenges of encouraging community interest, collecting and preserving artifacts and information, perpetuating the memory of prior Westfielders and instilling pride will lead us to add to the foregoing accomplishments.\n\nPermanent Home - One of the most exciting possibilities for us to contemplate is that at some future date we have been promised that the Reeve House (at the entrance to Mindowaskin Park on Mountain Avenue) will become the permanent home of the Historical Society. When that happens our ability to serve the Town of Westfield will increase dramatically."
