This tour will take you to 8 museums Manistee County. The tour will take approximately 4+ hours (when driving) depending on visitation time.\n\nMany of the Museums can be explored while enjoying one of the self-guided tours in the book. The Museums in the City of Manistee may both be explored when enjoying the Downtown Sites, East Homes or West Homes tour. The Destination sites have the Museums highlighted on these routes as well.\n\nMost of our Museums contain information about the entire county, however, the community that the Museum is located within has a concentration of artifacts from that community. We welcome you to explore each of our Museums as part of other tours, or explore individually on their own."
