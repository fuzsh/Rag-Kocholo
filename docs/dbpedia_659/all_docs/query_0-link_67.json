        "text": "Luther is a British psychological crime thriller television series starring Idris Elba as DCI John Luther and Ruth Wilson as Alice Morgan,[1] written by Neil Cross. The detective Luther must make cases against criminals while the murderer Morgan has a complicated relationship with him. The first series is composed of six episodes which ran in May and June 2010. A second series of four episodes aired on BBC One in June and July 2011, and a third was commissioned in 2012 composed of four episodes which aired in July 2013.[2] A two-episode fourth series was broadcast in December 2015, and a fifth series of four episodes premiered on 1 January 2019.[3] BBC Studios handled distribution for the TV series.[4]\n\nLutherGenreCreated byNeil CrossWritten byNeil CrossStarringOpening theme\"Paradise Circus\" by Massive AttackComposerPaul EnglishbyCountry of originUnited KingdomOriginal languageEnglishNo. of series5No. of episodes20 (list of episodes)ProductionProducerKatie SwindenRunning time51–63 minutesProduction companyBBC Studios Drama ProductionsOriginal releaseNetworkBBC OneRelease4 May 2010 ( ) –\n\n4 January 2019 (2019-01-04)RelatedLuther: The Fallen Sun\n\nA feature film continuation, Luther: The Fallen Sun, was released in select cinemas on 24 February 2023, before its streaming release on 10 March 2023, by Netflix. Starring Elba, Andy Serkis and Cynthia Erivo, the film was written by Cross.\n\nElba has been awarded a Critics' Choice Television Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance as John Luther.[5][6] The series has also received eleven Primetime Emmy Award nominations in various categories, including four nominations of Elba for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie.\n\nPlot\n\nedit\n\nJohn Luther is a Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) working for the Serious Crime Unit in series one, and the new \"Serious and Serial\" unit from series two.[7] A dedicated police officer, Luther is obsessive, possessed, and sometimes violent. However, Luther has paid a heavy price for his dedication; he has never been able to prevent himself from being consumed by the darkness of the crimes with which he deals.\n\nFor Luther, the job always comes first. His dedication is a curse and a blessing, both for him and those close to him. In the first episode of the series, he investigates brilliant psychopath and murderer Alice Morgan. Ultimately, he is unable to arrest her due to lack of evidence, but as the series progresses, she becomes both his nemesis and unlikely companion. As she pursues her infatuation with him, he gradually relents as he is able to glean insight from her about some of the cunning criminals he pursues. After Alice helps Luther avenge the death of his estranged wife Zoe, Luther aids her escape from a secure facility and she flees the country. In Alice's absence, Luther's life is dominated by his police work once again, culminating in the murder of his partner and protégé Justin Ripley in the third series. Alice reappears following Ripley's death, and finally convinces Luther to leave London with her.\n\nWhen the fourth series begins, Luther is living a reclusive life on the English coast. After learning of Alice's apparent death in mysterious circumstances, he is persuaded to return to London and resume his role as a DCI. It ultimately transpires that Alice faked her own death after her life with Luther did not match their expectations. Two years later she returns to extort money from organised crime boss George Cornelius, who sabotaged her previous diamond exchange. Embroiled in her schemes again, Luther's relationship with Alice heads towards its destructive climax.\n\nCast and characters\n\nedit\n\nMain article: List of Luther characters\n\nCharacter Portrayed by Series Film 1 2 3 4 5 DCI John Luther Idris Elba Main Alice Morgan Ruth Wilson Main Featured Does not appear Main Does not appear DCI Ian Reed Steven Mackintosh Main Does not appear Zoe Luther Indira Varma Main Does not appear Mark North Paul McGann Main Does not appear Recurring Does not appear DSU Rose Teller Saskia Reeves Main Does not appear DS Justin Ripley Warren Brown Main Featured Does not appear DCI/DSU Martin Schenk Dermot Crowley Main DS/DCI Erin Gray Nikki Amuka-Bird Does not appear Main Does not appear Jenny Jones Aimee-Ffion Edwards Does not appear Main Does not appear Baba Pam Ferris Does not appear Main Does not appear Toby Kent David Dawson Does not appear Main Does not appear Mary Day Sienna Guillory Does not appear Main Does not appear DSU George Stark David O'Hara Does not appear Main Does not appear DS Benny Silver Michael Smiley Recurring Main Does not appear DCI Theo Bloom Darren Boyd Does not appear Featured Does not appear DS Emma Lane Rose Leslie Does not appear Main Does not appear Megan Cantor Laura Haddock Does not appear Main Does not appear George Cornelius Patrick Malahide Does not appear Main Does not appear DS Catherine Halliday Wunmi Mosaku Does not appear Main Does not appear Jeremy Lake Enzo Cilenti Does not appear Main Does not appear Vivien Lake Hermione Norris Does not appear Main Does not appear DCI Odette Raine Cynthia Erivo Does not appear Main David Robey Andy Serkis Does not appear Main\n\nEpisodes\n\nedit\n\nMain article: List of Luther episodes\n\nSeriesEpisodesOriginally airedAvg.

Andy Serkis and Cynthia Erivo also joined the cast.[27] The film, Luther: The Fallen Sun, was released in select cinemas on 24 February 2023, before its streaming release on 10 March 2023, by Netflix.[29][30]\n\nProduction\n\nedit\n\nCreator Neil Cross conceived the series under the working title of The Calling, which was later used as the title of the novel prequel.[31] Cross has said that Luther is influenced by both Sherlock Holmes and Columbo; the nature of Luther's intellect and its application to solving crimes is comparable to Holmes's, whereas the show's use of the inverted detective format was inspired by Columbo.[32]\n\nThe first series was filmed in and around London, England, and produced by BBC Drama Productions. Brian Kirk, Sam Miller and Stefan Schwartz each directed two episodes and show creator Neil Cross wrote all six of the episodes. Leila Kirkpatrick was the line producer for the entire program and Katie Swinden was the producer for a number of episodes. Tim Fleming provided cinematography for two episodes. Katie Weiland and Victoria Boydell were involved in film editing, with Weiland editing two episodes. Andy Morgan was responsible for all casting, Paul Cross provided production design and Adam A.

The site's consensus reads: \"Gritty and ambiguous, Luther is a captivating drama bolstered by a powerhouse performance from Idris Elba in the title role.\"[33] It holds a Metacritic score of 82 out of 100, based on 11 collected reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[34] However, The Guardian's Stuart Heritage was initially critical of the show,[35] and compared it to the American series FlashForward, in that both series arrived with a large amount of hype but delivered an anticlimactic end product. However, by the fifth episode, Heritage had changed his views and called it Idris Elba's best work since The Wire.[36]\n\nThe show's second series was met with equally positive reviews and holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 13 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Luther delves into darker territory in its second series, and Idris Elba's outstanding performance makes this a police procedural of uncommon weight and heft.\"[37] It holds a Metacritic score of 78 out of 100, based on 9 collected reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".[38] Variety and The Hollywood Reporter admiringly highlighted the darker tone, Elba's performance, and the production.[39] In the third quarter of 2011, the top-rated shows on BBC America were Doctor Who, Top Gear, and Luther, which together gained the network its highest quarterly ratings ever.[40]\n\nSeries three was again met with positive reviews and holds an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Idris Elba shines in the title role of Luther despite familiar circumstances that benefit from the shortened season.\"[41] It holds a Metacritic score of 76 out of 100, based on 19 collected reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".[42]\n\nSeries four received positive reviews, with a 79% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Idris Elba remains the best thing about Luther in an all-too-brief season which packs a lot of plot into a short time frame.\"[43] It holds a Metacritic score of 68 out of 100, based on 11 reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".[44]\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus, the Series five broadcast in 2019 met with positive reviews, garnering an 85% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Luther returns in fine form from its extended exodus with a grisly mystery and the welcome reappearance of Ruth Wilson's psychotic villain, Alice Morgan.\"[45]\n\nBroadcast outside of the United Kingdom\n\nedit\n\nThe first series of the show premiered in Australia on ABC1 on 15 October 2010 and in the United States on BBC America two days later. The second series debuted in the United States on BBC America on 29 September 2011 and Australia on ABC1 on 24 February 2012.
