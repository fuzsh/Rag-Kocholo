        "text": "Origins and expansion\n\nedit\n\nIn 1964, Superdrug was incorporated under the name Leading Supermarkets Limited by the Goldstein brothers in London, both of whom had experience working in the groceries retail industry. Later that year the business adopted the present name. The first Superdrug shop opened in Putney, London on 26 April 1966.\n\nBy 1968, there were three shops trading in Putney, Croydon and Streatham. In the same year Superdrug acquired its first distribution centre, in Wimbledon. The chain grew rapidly, and expanded to a chain of forty shops by the beginning of the 1970s. In 1971, The Rite Aid Corporation, an American chemist chain, acquired 49% of the business.\n\nBy 1981, there were three hundred Superdrug shops in the United Kingdom, and they opened their 11,148 m2 (120,000 ft2) distribution centre and office complex at Beddington Lane near Croydon, Superdrug's head office is still based in Croydon having recently moved to a more central location. This centre closed in July 2007, and the southern distribution operation moved to Dunstable, with the head office moving to new offices in central Croydon in 2017. The northern distribution operates from South Elmsall, Pontefract, West Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1983, the business was floated on London's Unlisted Securities Market.[5]\n\nIn March 1987, Superdrug was sold to Woolworth Holdings (now known as Kingfisher plc) for £57 million.[5] The sale allowed accelerated growth of the brand through utilisation of Kingfisher's surplus high street property portfolio and substantial financial assets.\n\nIn January 1988, Superdrug acquired Tip-Top, a discount chemist chain which had a large presence in the north of England and Scotland, and Share Drug Stores plc, a southern-based chain. These acquisitions and an aggressive expansion programme saw the chain grow to six hundred outlets throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nSuperdrug continued to grow over the next eight years, increasing profitability and market share. The Goldstein brothers would retire from the company by 1990, shortly after its 25th anniversary In 1989, with Alan Smith heading up day-to-day operations shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1995, the company began a rebranding programme, which saw it leave behind its discount heritage and move upmarket, with a new corporate identity (including the introduction of a new star symbol as its logo) – under the banner \"the real beauty is the price\" – and new larger shops in prime retail locations.\n\nSuperdrug decided to relocate their head office in 2017, having spent more than 40 years at Beddington Lane. The company relocated to a more central location in Croydon having declared their love for the town, securing their future in the town, with a bigger and more modern head office to develop the future of the business.[6]\n\nAcquisition\n\nedit\n\nFacing increasing pressure from supermarkets and new discount chains, and following Kingfisher's failed merger attempt with Asda (which resulted in Walmart acquiring the latter chain), in July 2001, Superdrug was sold to Kruidvat, a chemist operator from continental Europe, to allow Kingfisher to focus on its DIY and electrical chains. It was restructured as a public limited company on 24 July, becoming Superdrug Stores plc,[7] and Kruidvat was subsequently sold to A.S. Watson, the retail and manufacturing business of the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, formally Hutchison Whampoa, in November 2002.\n\nA.S. Watson is also the parent company of Savers, the United Kingdom's number three chemist chain.[citation needed] Subsequently, several of Superdrug's smaller shops were converted into Savers, and approximately three hundred Savers shops were converted into branches of Superdrug. In 2004, during the company's 40th anniversary, the current logo was introduced, retaining the star motif from the previous logo, but modernising it with the addition of a new cursive wordmark. Signage was also changed with the introduction of the new logo, with stores being branded as \"Superdrug HealthBeauty\", and the website gaining the tagline \"Health & Beauty from A.S. Watson\", to signify its new ownership.\n\nIn April 2006, Superdrug entered the Republic of Ireland, and in Britain began rolling out its \"next generation\" shops, the first of which opened in Uxbridge. These focused on cosmetics and fragrance above all else and used plasma screens throughout the shop. Superdrug announced their intention to create 150 more next generation shops in 2008.[8] Since arriving in Ireland, the brand is now also represented in Douglas on the Isle of Man and St Helier on Jersey.\n\nSince 2010\n\nedit\n\nIn February 2010, Superdrug became a BUAV approved retailer,[9] joining several other high street chains in pledging its own brand products will be free from animal testing. All Superdrug own label products carry the leaping bunny cruelty free logo. This does not, however, cover products made by other brands that are sold in the shop.\n\nDuring 2010, Superdrug went into partnership with sister company The Perfume Shop by trialling shop-in-shop concessions. The partnership was tried in eleven shops of Superdrug, including; Aylesbury, Milton Keynes, Bury, Glasgow, Westfield London and Kensington High Street.[10] In January 2018, Superdrug were recognised by the Institute of Customer Service, placing fourth in the United Kingdom for Customer Satisfaction (UKCSI), with Yorkshire Bank in third, First Direct second, and Amazon first.\n\nIn September 2015, Superdrug announced the launch of a new app for customers to track their Superdrug Loyalty Points.[11] This app eventually became the Superdrug Shopping App, which allows customers to order retail items from Superdrug branches online.[12][13]\n\nOn 22 March 2018, Superdrug opened their first vegan only pop-up shop at Shoreditch’s Boxpark. Superdrug said it was in response to increased demand for plant based and cruelty free beauty products. The shop showcases Superdrug's own brand beauty and cosmetic products, and also exclusive branded products that are friendly to vegans.[14]\n\nIn August 2018, Superdrug was the subject of a blackmail attempt using data obtained from its website via credential stuffing.[15]\n\nSuperdrug lost a court case in December 2019 resulting from words in an email issued by the company's buyer, \"Please go ahead with the below\", referring to supplier Athena Brand's proposals to supply a minimum quantity of Nature's Alchemist products. The words were interpreted as creating a contract between the two parties, and by inference appeared to mean that the buyer had authority to enter into such a contract.[16]\n\nIn April 2020, it was announced that Superdrug was rolling out a new Pharmacy app to its stores across the UK, in partnership with Healthera.[17] The app allows Superdrug patients to order prescriptions and book services online.[18][19]"
