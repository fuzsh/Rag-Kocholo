        "text": "Shopping mall\n\nEmporium Centre San Francisco is a shopping mall located in San Francisco, California, United States. It is anchored by Bloomingdale's. It connects directly to the Powell Street station via an underground entrance on the concourse floor.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally developed by Sheldon Gordon (co-developer of The Forum Shops at Caesars and Beverly Center), the nine-story mall opened in October 1988 as San Francisco Shopping Centre with approximately 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) of space, the then-largest Nordstrom store (350,000 square feet (33,000 m2)) on the top several floors, the first spiral escalator in the United States, and a connector to the adjoining Emporium-Capwell flagship store.[3]\n\nAfter a slow start, it soon became one of the top-performing shopping centers in the country. In 1996, the adjoining Emporium (it had dropped the Capwell name by then) was shuttered in the wake of Federated Department Stores' buyout of its parent, Broadway Stores. The vacated store was temporarily used as a Macy's furniture store while it renovated its Union Square flagship in 1997.\n\nIn May 1997, Urban Shopping Centers, Inc., a real estate investment trust, acquired a half-interest and management of the center. This was followed by Urban's own buyout by Rodamco North America N.V. (a European property firm primarily invested in the United States) in October 2000 and Rodamco's subsequent sale to a consortium including the Westfield Group in January 2002. Westfield acquired its initial 50% stake in the center at this time and soon bought the rest.\n\nExpansion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2003, Forest City, which had acquired redevelopment rights to the long-vacant Emporium store from Federated, reached an agreement with Westfield to jointly redevelop the two properties.[4]\n\nThe newly expanded mixed-use Westfield San Francisco Centre opened on September 28, 2006.[5] Designed by the Kohn Pedersen Fox architectural firm, with Kevin Kennon as the Design Principal, the mall included Bloomingdale's West Coast flagship store, a nine-screen Century Theatres multiplex theater featuring 2 XD screens, a 30,000 square feet (2,800 m2) Bristol Farms gourmet supermarket, and the Downtown Campus for San Francisco State University in its 1.5 million+ ft² of space.\n\nThe redevelopment cost $440 million. Only the front façade and landmark dome of the original structure were preserved; the rest of the structure was completely gutted and replaced.[6] Upon completion of the project, Forest City became an equity partner and along with Westfield assumed responsibility for day-to-day management.[7] In March 2009, it was announced that Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping center was named as one of nine finalists vying for the title of “World’s Best Shopping Center” as part of the International Council of Shopping Centers Inc.’s inaugural “Best-of-the-Best” awards. Westfield San Francisco Centre ended up winning the \"Best-of-the-Best\" award for design and development; it was one of only four shopping centers in the world to win.[8]\n\nIn 2011, the San Francisco Police Department considered putting a substation in the mall to prevent rampant shoplifting.[9]\n\nThe Bristol Farms store closed on January 27, 2017.[10] In the summer of 2021, a Shake Shack opened in the former Bristol Farms space.[11][12]\n\nDecline\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2023, Westfield and Brookfield announced that, due to plunging post-pandemic sales, occupancy and foot traffic at the mall, they would stop making loan payments and cede the property to their lenders.[13][14] The Century Theatres multiplex closed on June 15, 2023.[15] In July 2023, the Westfield branding was removed from the mall, which was renamed San Francisco Centre.[16] Nordstrom closed on August 27, 2023,[17] leaving Bloomingdale's as the only anchor store, at which point the mall's occupancy level had fallen to 55%.[18][19] Mayor London Breed suggested that the mall could be redeveloped for another use, such as a soccer stadium,[20] while others suggested it be used as food halls, pickleball courts, and animal shelters.[21]\n\nIn September 2023, the owners of the American Eagle store filed a lawsuit claiming mall management had failed to \"maintain the Common Areas at the mall which has poisoned public opinion\" about safety.[22]\n\nIn October 2023, Gregg Williams, the principal receiver of Trident Pacific[23] (a receivership firm), was appointed by a judge to take possession, custody, and control of the mall.[24]\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the LEGO Store closed permanently.[25] The 2-story Adidas store closed permanently on January 13, 2024.[26] The Hollister store closed permanently on January 8, 2024.[27] Aldo closed permanently on January 21, 2024.[28] Madewell and sister chain J. Crew both closed permanently on January 22, 2024.[29] The mall's Lucky Brand store closed on January 29, 2024. By that point, the mall's occupancy level was only 25%,[30] and its valuation had plunged 75% from its 2016 level of $1.2 billion to only $290 million.[31]\n\nOn February 29, 2024, San Francisco Centre was renamed Emporium Centre San Francisco.[32]\n\nIn March 2024, it was announced that L'Occitane had closed and that Sephora would close too, as a result of decline.[33]\n\nIn May 2024, American Eagle[34] and Ted Baker[35] announced that they would also be closing their stores.[36]\n\nLayout\n\n[edit]\n\nThe shopping center is nine stories tall and is integrated into nearby buildings anchored by Bloomingdale's, with one vacant anchor previously occupied by Nordstrom, which closed in late August 2023.[37] The basement level is directly connected to two entrances for Powell Street station, which is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Muni Metro trains. The mall's owners paid $750,000 annually to BART to maintain access to the station.[38]\n\nAnchors and major tenants\n\n[edit]\n\nBloomingdale's (338,000 ft²; opened 2006)\n\nFormer anchors and major tenants\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Francisco State University Downtown Campus[39] (107,000 ft²; opened 2006, closed 2021)[40]\n\nNordstrom (350,000 ft²; opened 1988, closed August 27, 2023)\n\nCentury Theatres & XD 9-screen multiplex (53,000 ft², closed June 15, 2023)\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\n845 Market Street, anchored by Bloomingdale's\n\nThe entrance to 845 Market Street\n\nThe entrance to 865 Market Street\n\n865 Market Street, anchored by the former Nordstrom\n\nMall interior three weeks after redevelopment and reopening, 2006\n\nThe dome within the shopping center\n\nInterior atrium of Nordstrom store with curved escalators, 2011\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area portal\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nWestfield San Francisco Centre Opening Fact Sheet\n\nWestfield San Francisco Centre Press Release\n\nInternational Council of Shopping Centers"
