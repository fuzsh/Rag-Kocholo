        "text": "Once or twice in every hundred years there is a draftsman who can do just about anything with graphite, watercolor, gouache and stump. One such was Adolph Menzel (1815-1905), the long-lived Berliner whose drawings are having their first-ever major exhibition in the United States at the Frick Collection through Nov. 18.\n\nMenzel bloomed early. At 12, he got a chalk drawing after Rubens into a perfectly reputable exhibition for grown-up artists. At 17, he made illustrations for Goethe that were singled out by Gottfried Schadow, the head of the Academy of Arts in Berlin.\n\nHe also bloomed late. At 88, he was advising the young Max Reinhardt, later to become one of the great theater directors of our century, on the sets and costumes for his directorial debut in Berlin.\n\nMenzel's was a prodigious career. In 1830, he was a fatherless jobbing lithographer who would take on any job, no matter how trivial, to support his widowed mother and his brother and sister. With time, untaught and unaided, he became the Mr. Art of imperial Germany. On his 80th birthday the Kaiser gave him a costume party in Potsdam, during which one of his best-loved paintings, the ''Flute Concert of Frederick the Great,'' was acted out in a high-born charade.\n\nAt his death in 1905, he had the title of Acting Privy Counselor with the rank of ''excellency.'' On his chest, on great occasions, he could wear that same Order of the Black Eagle that was worn over and over again by the princes, generals and statesmen whom he had painted. The Kaiser came to his funeral. The finest string quartet in Germany, with Joseph Joachim as its leader, played at his memorial concert, and in due time the state bought up every last scrap that he had left in his studio.\n\nWith a record of that sort, Menzel might have been a bombastic hack who had toadied his way higher and higher in official favor. But it was a point of honor with him that he never in all his long life asked anyone for anything. As his friend the novelist Theodor Fontane once said, Menzel knew ''how to pursue a career in art without being a careerist.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
