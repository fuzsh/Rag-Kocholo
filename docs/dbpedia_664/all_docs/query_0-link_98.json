        "text": "Adolf Von Menzel was a German painter born on 8 December 1815 in Wroclaw, Poland. Adolf’s father was a lithographer who encouraged his son’s taste in art. After his father died in 1832, young Adolf had to continue running the lithography business left behind. Asides from a brief period of studying at the Berlin Academy of Art, Menzel was self-taught.\n\nMenzel won acclaim and recognition in his country as the pioneer of his illustration style through illustrations of the life of the Prussian king. Between 1839 and 1849, Menzel created over 400 drawings and 200 plate illustrations on the same subject. In 1840, Adolf began studying painting and eventually adopted the medium.\n\nThough the artist suffered estrangement from other artists of his era due to his seclusion, history books speak highly of Menzel’s impact. His highly decorated and illustrious career boasts honors such as the Order of the Black Eagle, Academie des Beaux-Arts, and Royal Academy memberships. Menzel died on 9 February 1905 in Berlin, Germany.\n\nWhat was Adolf Von Menzel Known For?\n\nAdolf Von Menzel was known for making lithographic illustrations and paintings of the life of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. Menzel was fascinated with the personality of Frederick II, aiming to show the king as a man of the people. Menzel’s oil paintings and lithographs were historically accurate and showed plenty of details.\n\nWho was Adolf Von Menzel Influenced By?\n\nAdolf Von Menzel was influenced by Louis Frederich Sachse. In 1833, shortly after Adolf took over his father’s lithography business, Sachse produced ink drawings on stone, illustrating Kunstlers Erdenwallen. Menzel subsequently adopted the style in his artworks.\n\nWhat Art Movement was Adolf Von Menzel Associated With?\n\nAdolf Von Menzel was associated with Impressionism and Realism art movements.\n\nAdolf Von Menzel Artwork\n\nBelow are some of the artworks of Adolf Von Menzel\n\nAfternoon in the Garden\n\nBall Scene\n\nBallsouper the ball detail\n\nChinese Comfort Gouache\n\nClara Schmidt von Knobelsdorff ready to go out\n\nCoronation of King William I\n\nDeparture of King Wilhelm I to the army on July 31\n\nEmile Von Menzel\n\nFlute Concert\n\nIn a beer garden\n\nIn The Luxembourg Gardens\n\nIn the White Hall\n\nLiving Room of Justice Von Maercker\n\nMasked Ball\n\nMenzel’s Sister Emilie Sleeping\n\nOn a journey to Beautiful Countryside\n\nPortrait of Karoline Arnold\n\nPortrait of Menzel’s Brother Richard\n\nRound Table\n\nSitting Woman\n\nThe Ball\n\nThe Rightful and the Just\n\nTravel Plans"
