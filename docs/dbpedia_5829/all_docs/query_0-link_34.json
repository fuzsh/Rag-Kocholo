Perfect for fans of Greg van Eekhout and Geoff Rodkey.\n\nAfter the adventure and havoc of escaping the evil General Smag, Trouble is happy to finally be settling in to their new home with their best friend, Electra, and the misfit crew of the Hindsight. Maybe danger is finally behind them. But Trouble has a situation to deal with: training the rescued baby shapeshifter and helping it figure out who--and what--they are. But trying to be a good big sibling to a proto-being isn't the only challenge facing Trouble.\n\nTrouble's best friend, Electra, was taken from her home as a baby and was raised at a military academy, where she was trained to become a loyal StarLeague cadet. Now Electra is determined to rescue the other cadets so they can have normal childhoods instead of becoming lethal weapons, like her. Her plan? To infiltrate the academy as a senior student and then engineer an escape by the entire student body.\n\nTrouble knows they must help Electra carry out her plan. But when Electra goes missing, Trouble, determined to rescue the rescuer, goes undercover at the academy, even if it's not as easy as you'd think for a shapeshifter to pretend to be a military cadet. Especially when Trouble finds that the baby shapeshifter has come along.\n\nNow Trouble must do whatever it takes to save Electra and the other cadets--and figure out a strange mystery coming from the deep dark edges of space. Because something's coming...\n\nGenre: Children's Fiction\n\nVisitors also looked at these books\n\nUsed availability for Sarah Prineas's Asking For Trouble\n\nSearch for\n\nAbout Fantastic Fiction Information for Authors"
