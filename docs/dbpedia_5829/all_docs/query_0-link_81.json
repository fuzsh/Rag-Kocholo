Then update the Apple TV app for Windows in the Microsoft Store.\n\nIf you're using a compatible smart TV, streaming device, or gaming console that's connected to the internet, the Apple TV app should update automatically. If you need help, you can contact the manufacturer or learn how to get the Apple TV app on your device.\n\nIf the movie or TV show won't start playing\n\nAfter each step, try to stream or download the movie or TV show again.\n\nCheck the System Status page for service interruptions or check a third-party provider's website for any interruptions.

If it doesn't work, contact your internet service provider to see if there's an issue with your network.\n\nIf other people are using Apple TV+ or Apple TV channels, make sure it doesn't exceed the limits for streaming on multiple devices.\n\n* Make sure that your Wi-Fi router is 802.11a/g/n/ac compatible. Streaming HD content requires 8 Mbit/s or faster. Slower tiers of Wi-Fi connections might not be fast enough to stream HD video content.\n\nIf the video quality is bad or it stops playing\n\nIf multiple people on your network are using the internet, your connection speed might slow down. Ask them to temporarily pause their internet activities.\n\nIf you're using a smart TV or streaming device, turn it off and back on again. If you're using an Apple device or PC, restart it.\n\nTap or click the download button to try downloading the movie or TV show instead.*\n\n* You can't download movies or TV shows to Apple TV, smart TVs, or streaming devices. You can download HDR content only to certain iPhone and iPad models.
