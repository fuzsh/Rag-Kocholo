        "text": "Robinne Lee Thank you for your lovely note, Lori.\n\nAt this point, I have no plans to write a second book for Hayes and Solène. I'm finishing up another unrelated novel now, and will begin working on another once this book is done. It too is unrelated. I may at some point return to Solène's story, but no time soon, I'm afraid. There are other stories that need to be told.\n\nThank you so much for reading. It's greatly appreciated.\n\nAll best,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Leann,\n\nYou might be disappointed to hear this, but I don't typically read steamy books, so I'm not certain that I have any books to recommend that fall under that specific category. Although some enjoyable recent reads include, \"Daisy Jones and the Six\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, \"The Perfect Find,\" by Tia Williams, and \"My Oxford Year\" by Julia Whelan. I always appreciate a good love story, and those three definitely offer that.\n\nI would not say that any books in particular inspired \"The Idea Of You,\" but for research purposes I did revisit D.H. Lawrence's \"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\" Erica Jong's \"Fear of Flying,\" and \"The Lover\" by Marguerite Duras. Mostly to compare and contrast literary reads in the past that involved some level of sexuality.\n\nThank you for your kinds words regarding The Idea Of You.\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Hi Suzy,\n\nSo glad you enjoyed The Idea Of You! Yes, the book is being made into a movie!! We announced at the end of last year that we'd sold the rights to Cathy Schulman and Welle Entertainment. We are all very excited! For more information on all things TIOY, you can visit The Idea of You Club site, or join our private FB group. Links are below.\n\nThank you again for reading!\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nhttp://theideaofyouclub.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/TheId...\n\nRobinne Lee Kat,\n\nThank you for reading. Glad to hear you were affected by Hayes and Solène's story. I would never ask a fan to not write her own interpretation of the story, or its aftermath. I feel like once it's out there in the public, there is always the possibility that will happen. And you are always welcome to share it with the private FB group, here:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/TheId...\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Luiza,\n\nHayes is very different from Harry Styles. I think people who are aware of Harry and/or want to picture Harry will. And that's completely fair, as the most successful British boy band of the last ten years is One Direction. And if you're going to create a twenty-something popstar, you may want to start with a good head of hair and dimples, because why not? But so much of who I wanted Hayes to be -- his persona, his lineage, his upbringing, his education, his experiences, his cadence, his speech, his sense of self -- is very specific, and not at all like Harry.\n\nHayes is a posh British boy who was born into a certain kind of family, grew up in the \"right\" neighborhood and went to all the \"right\" schools, and who has suddenly found himself in an extraordinary profession. And if he hadn't been that person, I don't think it's likely he would have attracted someone like Solène. The British pay far too much attention to class for me to have simply overlooked that in the drawing of these characters.\n\nIf you're still uncertain after that, listen to the audiobook, and you will see just how unlike Harry he is.\n\nThank you for reading, and for reaching out.\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Thank you so much for reading! There is a chance I will write more about Hayes' and Solène's story, but I have other things I want to write before then and I'm not likely to begin until I'm convinced I have an original story idea. And at this point, I can't say what the focus of that story will be. But I thank you for your interest!\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Hi Judy,\n\nThank you so much for the kind words!! By now, we've discussed this in detail on Facebook -- I'm assuming this is the same Judy Franks-- so you're aware I'm thinking about a sequel. Although, still very much in the earliest of stages. And yes, there is certainly more to explore. But my intention was to always give Solène a glimpse into Hayes' and the other band members' lives, and to deliberately leave some of her questions unanswered. So often we only know what a person is willing to share with us. Especially in the case of celebrities. We don't really know them, just the idea of them. And I wanted the reader to experience Hayes and his world as she did. Hope this helps some.\n\nThank you, again!!\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Hi Jeanette,\n\nThank you so much for reading The Idea of You. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I had not planned to write a sequel to this story, as I had very specific reasons for ending it the way that I did. That said, readers seem to have connected to these characters much more strongly than I envisioned. And I've received enough requests that I've begun thinking about ways to revisit them. I just can't make any promises about how soon. It took me roughly a year and a half to write this book. It was a terribly emotional journey for me, and I imagine if I endeavor to write a sequel it will be the same.\n\nI thank you again for reading, and for sharing with your friends!\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n-Robinne\n\nRobinne Lee No time soon, unfortunately. I'd only ever intended this book to be a stand alone. So, while I have in the last couple of months started thinking about where I could possibly take this story, I will only revisit it if I can make the next book equally or more compelling. Which means it's going to take awhile.\n\nIn the meantime, feel free to join the Facebook private group where others are discussing their sequel ideas.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/19113...\n\nThank you for reading!!\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne\n\nRobinne Lee Hi Maria!!\n\nSo glad you liked it!! And especially the parts on South America! It was very important to me to represent each location as honestly and beautifully as I could. I've never been to Argentina, but I have been to Brazil and loved it. Looking forward to revisiting that part of the world!\n\nAs for a sequel, I'm still in the very, very early stages.\n\nThank you for reading!!\n\nCheers,\n\nRobinne"
