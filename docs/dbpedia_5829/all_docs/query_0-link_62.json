        "text": "And what do readers ask for? For Tessa Bailey to live up to the other three amazing novels (and one follow-up novella) in this incredible series, and ‚Äì being Tessa Bailey ‚Äì she delivers in spades!\n\nWhile you certainly do not need to have read the other books in the series to enjoy this one, it does lend a certain depth of understanding since the other characters make appearances.\n\nFormer pool hustler Ruby and her detective boyfriend Troy from His Risk to Take, socialize with my favorite couple (and it‚Äôs a tough choice, let me tell you) Story and the oh-so-debauched explosives expert and reformed ladies man, Daniel (from Officer Off Limits). Readers of that book remember Story‚Äôs best friend and socialite Hayden Winstead, not just because she let Story borrow her youth size Mets jersey for a very scandalous picture, but because Hayden was so clearly unhappy with the pressures of her life. We also saw that Hayden had quite an antagonistic relationship with Daniel‚Äôs best friend and fellow explosives expert, Brent Mason, who regularly traded barbs with Hayden, needling her about her rich lifestyle.\n\nAt the start of Asking for Trouble, Hayden and Brent are suffering one another‚Äôs presence at their regular bar where they hang out with Story and Daniel as well as plenty of other cops (future heroes perhaps?). Hayden is irritated that Brent loves to focus on her money, only seeing her as a vapid socialite and Brent seems content to let Hayden believe he is just a knuckle-dragging Neanderthal full of nothing but bad jokes and sexual innuendo. When he pushes her a little too far with his usual sexual humor, she decides to call him on his bluff and tantalize him. Neither of them back down and before they know it, Brent is back at Hayden‚Äôs townhouse in a rather compromising position.\n\nAnd so it begins. The two of them recognize an incredible chemistry exists between them and pray that a few full body hits will get it out of their system, but the best laid plans, etc. Brent goes to a snooty dinner to help piss off Hayden‚Äôs mother and ends up charming her father and all the guests (well, all but the one who wants Hayden). In one of the most tender scenes I‚Äôve ever read, Brent rushes to help Hayden when she tells him the bus she‚Äôs on broke down on the highway, only to discover her in shorts and a t-shirt escorting a bunch of Hayden-adoring kids on a Fresh Air Fund outing. Brent doesn‚Äôt just help fix the bus, he walks Hayden through fixing it (boosting her with his legs so he can subtly ogle her butt, naturally) and makes her look like a hero to the kids she‚Äôs helping. I‚Äôm going to admit that I choked up.\n\nAmidst all this growing understanding ‚Äì Brent beginning to realize that there is a fiery, sexually insatiable, tender-hearted woman behind that cool exterior and Hayden waking up to the idea that behind Brent‚Äôs shield of humor lies a knight who works multiple jobs to help the family he adores ‚Äì there is hot, Tessa Bailey sex, i.e., the best kind. Need a sample?\n\n‚ÄúI have a few more bad words for you. Would you like to hear them?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The whispered word broke free before she could suppress it. Brent rewarded her by slowly grinding his hips into her, growling against her neck as she panted.\n\nHe brushed her hair aside with one hand and scraped his teeth down the side of her neck. ‚ÄúYou made this fucking sound, Hayden. The first time you spread your legs to take my cock. I hear it everywhere I go. This goddamn‚Ä¶ moan? Sob? I don‚Äôt know. All I know is if I don‚Äôt fuck that sound out of you again soon, I‚Äôm going to completely lose my mind.‚Äù\n\nBailey, Tessa (2013-11-25). Asking for Trouble (A Line of Duty Novel) (Entangled Brazen) (Kindle Locations 1560-1565). Entangled Publishing, LLC. Kindle Edition.\n\nAwesome, right? Thank God it‚Äôs 20 degrees outside so I can crack the window to cool off. As delightful was the realization to both Hayden and Brent that the biting sarcasm they‚Äôd traded all these months actually hid a very similar sense of humor ‚Äì the playful, pun-laden kind ‚Äì and they weren‚Äôt above using it when they were naked. I loved how Brent got his nickname of Florence (not telling, you‚Äôll have to read the book) and certainly the ongoing Beaches movie references were hilarious. Case in point:\n\n‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Beaches, huh?‚Äù Brent cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWhat is that, some kind of chick flick?‚Äù Of course, he‚Äôd seen Beaches. Bette Midler was a national treasure. He‚Äôd keep that to himself though, in the interest of her not questioning his masculinity.\n\nBailey, Tessa (2013-11-25). Asking for Trouble (A Line of Duty Novel) (Entangled Brazen) (Kindle Locations 1920-1922). Entangled Publishing, LLC. Kindle Edition.\n\nIn other words, Tessa Bailey‚Äôs Asking for Trouble has exactly what die-hard fans have come to expect. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still so overtaken by a faint sense of astonishment whenever I read her books. I know she‚Äôs going to give me hot sex, strong emotions and heroes and heroines I would spend the holidays with, yet I think deep down I worry she‚Äôs too good to be true, and I‚Äôm going to read a book that has me finally gesturing at some paragraph saying, ‚ÄúAh, ha! You see, Tessa Bailey is clearly human! Look at how she mixed metaphors.‚Äù or some similar writing gaffe‚Ä¶but she never does. I‚Äôll just have to live with her perfection and enjoy reading (and re-reading) her books. It‚Äôs hard to be me. üòâ\n\nHappy reading!"
