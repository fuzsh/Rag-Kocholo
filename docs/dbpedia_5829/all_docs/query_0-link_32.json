        "text": "Mark Hanlon's ''Buddy Boy'' begins with some grimy black-and-white images of a plaster Christ suspended on a cross and then introduces its no less tortured protagonist. Francis (Aidan Gillen) is a shy stutterer and compulsive self-abuser who lives in a filth-encrusted apartment in a nameless big city. His one human connection is Sal (Susan Tyrrell), a one-legged alcoholic with an unconvincing wig who may or may not be Francis's mother.\n\nFrancis devotes his unhappy life to caring for Sal, lugging her unconscious body back to the La-Z-Boy when she's had too much to drink, and preparing her daily meals from the dozens of cans of processed meat that fill the kitchen cabinets.\n\nBut an angel has moved in across the street in the form of an attractive Frenchwoman, Gloria (Emmanuelle Seigner), who loves to linger in front of her picture window in various degrees of undress. Francis studies her intently through a hole he has cut in his wall -- an image that seems meant to evoke Anthony Perkins's watching Janet Leigh in the room next door in ''Psycho.''\n\nAs in Hitchcock's film, sexual tension leads to violence, though ''Buddy Boy'' takes a more meandering, metaphorical route. Holding out the prospect of grace and redemption, Gloria falls improbably in love with Francis and takes him to bed. But this development only seems to increase Francis's twitchy desperation, and soon he has added hallucinations to his collection of hysterical symptoms. He imagines seeing Gloria, an avowed vegetarian, feeding on a secret cache of raw, red beef.\n\nMr. Hanlon, who both wrote and directed ''Buddy Boy,'' is working the curious vein of the sentimental grotesque. As unattractive as Francis may be, he has been designed as a repository for all of the viewer's feelings of self-consciousness and self-pity; we are meant to identify with his status as God's all-purpose, undeserving victim, and to shed a tear for Francis and ourselves.\n\nYet his victimhood is couched in such absurdly extreme, cartoonish terms that identification is impossible. Ms. Tyrrell, a camp icon since her boozy turn in John Huston's 1972 ''Fat City,'' plays Sal in a spray of sloppy laughter and angry outbursts; her character has no more of a reality component than does her apartment, a symphony in brown and beige littered with cigarette butts, empty bottles and half-eaten meals. Even the walls seem to be sweating something viscous and unpleasant.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
