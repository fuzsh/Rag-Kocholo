        "text": "Last week, President Donald Trump responded to the horrific shootings in Parkland, Florida, by wondering whether there should perhaps be some sort of “ratings system” in place to evaluate simulated violence in video games and films. Luckily, the Motion Picture Association of America (or M.P.A.A.) already exists—though even if you knew that, you could be forgiven for wondering how, exactly, this mysterious, cloistered organization works. Its membership is secretive; its methodology is opaque; its ratings are justified by confusing, nonspecific descriptors like “disturbing violence/images” (which is somehow different from “bloody images”) and “thematic elements.”\n\nThat second designation “probably doesn’t mean anything,” says M.P.A.A. historian Jon Lewis, author of Hollywood v. Hard Core: How the Struggle Over Censorship Created the Modern Film Industry. He’s an expert on the M.P.A.A. after 1968, the year longtime M.P.A.A. president Jack Valenti created the first version of the organization’s current ratings system.\n\nInstead, these ratings “are, by design, subjective,” Lewis says, which allows the group “to anticipate what other parents might think. They’re also not banning anything, with the exception of an NC-17, which isn’t really a ban. If a movie is getting a PG-13 or R rating, the M.P.A.A.’s argument is: they’re not preventing its release.”\n\nWait: “other parents”? It’s true: though not much is publicly known about who belongs to the M.P.A.A.’s Classification and Ratings Administration (or C.A.R.A.), the Daily Herald did outline some basic criteria for M.P.A.A. membership in 1986. We know, according to the paper, that C.A.R.A. members “must live in California and must be parents. Their identities are kept secret to avoid threats or bribes. They serve two-year terms.”\n\nOn that last point, Lewis is skeptical. “The M.P.A.A. are more secretive than the C.I.A., so the idea that they could be bribed is ridiculous. That guideline is just a matter of public relations. It‘s utter nonsense . . . which is, in a way, ingenious: if you can‘t argue with public figures, and there is no [quantifiable] policy, how can you argue with a rating?”\n\nThe M.P.A.A., formed in 1922 and originally known as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, first began regulating film content in 1930. But the interpretation of these rules—commonly referred to as the “Hays Code,” for M.P.P.D.A. founding president William H. Hays—varied wildly, since these guidelines were enforced by individual state-censor boards. So in 1968, Jack Valenti, Hays’s most influential successor, instituted a ratings system based on four central ratings: G (“general audiences”), M (“suggested for mature audiences,” a rating eventually replaced by PG), R (“restricted”), and X (“persons under 16 not admitted”). Though the designations have undergone some small changes—including the addition of PG-13 in 1984—it’s largely the system that’s still in place today.\n\nWhat isn’t clear, however, is what the M.P.A.A.’s ratings’ descriptors actually mean. If it were up to Valenti, these descriptors—first introduced in 1990, and displayed more prominently alongside ratings as of 2013—wouldn’t have been introduced in the first place; in 1988, he told the Chicago Sun Times that he had considered and summarily rejected the idea of affixing sub-ratings to films, like “S” for “Sex” and “V” for “Violence,” a system similar to the flimsy “content labels” that the F.C.C. currently uses to rate television shows solely on the presence of nudity and/or adult language.\n\nBut while both the F.C.C. and C.A.R.A.’s ratings’ descriptors are fairly basic, the rulings of the former are subject to public scrutiny, while the M.P.A.A.’s aren’t—simply because nobody knows how exactly their decisions are reached. As filmmaker Kirby Dick argued in his 2006 documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated, the M.P.A.A. and C.A.R.A. are far more squeamish about sex than violence. (Incredibly enough, Donald Trump also made this point before musing about the need for a rating system: “You see these movies, they’re so violent and yet a kid is able to see a movie if sex isn’t involved, but killing is involved,” he said February 22.)\n\nUniversal Studios proved Dick’s point by pre-emptively toning down the most explicit sex scenes in the recently concluded Fifty Shades of Grey franchise, in order to avoid being slapped with an NC-17 rating, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The trade indicates that the M.P.A.A. especially frowns upon full-frontal nudity (male or female), prolonged hip-thrusting, and sex between two people who either aren’t already married, or about to be married.\n\nIt’s probably not a coincidence that Fifty Shades Freed, the final movie in the trilogy, satisfies all three of these informal restrictions; in the film, Dakota Johnson’s mild-mannered Anastasia Steele finally marries Jamie Dornan’s sadomasochistic dominator Christian Grey. A steamy shower scene ends just before Dornan’s package is shown; in an earlier sex scene, Grey teases Steele with a vibrator, but never penetrates his partner. “The whole thing makes no sense,” Lewis says. “There’s no way that [the M.P.A.A.] could stop Fifty Shades of Grey from coming out . . . but you also can’t make that movie if it’s not rated R.”\n\nLewis notes that the talking heads in Dick’s documentary also argue that the M.P.A.A. is generally harder on films featuring gay sex or characters than it is on movies featuring straight sex. Further evidence for that claim can perhaps be seen in the PG-13 ratings the M.P.A.A. gave to recent films, including last year’s awards-nominated sports-comedy Battle of the Sexes—would the movie have been rated PG if its understated love scenes had involved a man and a woman, rather than two women?—and this year’s teen dramedy Love, Simon. That film also follows a gay protagonist, and is rated PG-13 for “thematic elements, sexual references, language, and teen partying.” Is homosexuality the theme in question?\n\nAccording to Lewis, the M.P.A.A.’s logic is simple: “They are the average Americans—that’s their argument. ‘Most parents think that.’ They’re not saying that gay sex is good or bad—they’re saying that parents would have an issue with their kids seeing that.”\n\nThe M.P.A.A. itself echoed this when asked to comment on this story: “For almost 50 years, the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) has provided parents with advance information about the level of content within movies to help them determine what is appropriate for their children,” a spokesperson said. “The rating system does not make any judgment about the content, including sexuality, depicted in movies. Rather, raters ask the question any parent would ask: What would I want to know about this film before I decide to let my child see it? The rating descriptors that accompany each film inform parents what elements are present at the assigned rating level. As stated in its Rules, it is not C.A.R.A.'s purpose to prescribe social policy, ‘but instead to reflect the current values of the majority of American parents.’ Elements such as violence, language, drug use, and sexuality are continually re-evaluated through surveys and focus groups to better assist parents in making family viewing choices.”"
