        "text": "From the towering limestone karsts of Ao Phang Nga to the summit of Doi Inthanon, each of the best national parks in Thailand holds a distinct allure. These are the ones not to be missed on your next trip…\n\nThe Land of Smiles is jam-packed with beautiful landscapes. And nowhere is this more clear than in the country’s 147 national parks. While you might not be able to fit the entire roster of parks into your trip, we urge you to explore as many as possible.\n\nFrom the lush rainforests of the north to the pristine islands adorning the southern seas, Thailand’s national parks are as varied as they are beautiful. Get ready to dive into the heart of Khao Yai’s dense forests, traverse the scenic trails of Kaeng Krachan, and uncover the ancient rock art of Pha Taem.\n\nNot sure which ones you need to visit? We’ve rounded up our favourites to help you decide.\n\nTop Thai National Parks\n\nKhao Sok National Park\n\nIf you only have time to visit one Thai national park, make it Khao Sok. We totally fell in love on a previous visit to Thailand and are already planning our next trip.\n\nThere’s plenty to do for those in search of adventure. Embark on jungle treks through the park’s diverse landscape, or head into one of the many caves that dot the park.\n\nWhile you’re there, spend some time on Cheow Lan Lake – the most popular activities are river tubing and canoe tours. If you head there on a guided tour (and you definitely should), your guide will be able to take you to a local cave, too.\n\nWe recommend staying on the lake in a floating bungalow. We booked our stay through Our Jungle Camp Eco Resort and spent an incredible couple of days exploring the best of the park.\n\nRead Next: An Essential Guide to Khao Sok National Park\n\nMu Ko Ang Thong National Park\n\nOne destination not to be missed is Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park, part of an archipelago near Koh Samui.\n\nMu Ko Ang Thong actually boasts a whopping 42 islands, each of which are known for their beautiful limestone cliffs and thriving marine system.\n\nIsland hopping, snorkelling, and kayaking are some of the most popular activities here, with one of the main features of this stunning national park being Emerald Lake.\n\nDoi Inthanon National Park\n\nTravelling to Chiang Mai? You need to check out Doi Inthanon National Park.\n\nIf you’re up for a challenge, this park is home to the highest peak in Thailand. It takes around two hours to reach the summit via the Kew Mae Pan Trail, but the incredible views are more than worth it.\n\nRich in biodiversity, the park features a range of ecosystems, from temperate forests at higher altitudes to tropical forests at lower elevations. Plus, the park is home to two impressive pagodas, Naphamethinidon and Naphaphonphumisiri, dedicated to the King and Queen of Thailand.\n\nKhao Yai National Park\n\nIf you’re visiting the Thai capital, Khao Yai is home to the most convenient national park to visit.\n\nLocated in the Nakhon Ratchasima, Saraburi, and Prachinburi provinces, Khao Yai is known for its abundant wildlife, including elephants, gibbons, and a variety of bird species.\n\nThe park features the majestic Haew Narok Waterfall, one of the tallest waterfalls in Thailand. Numerous hiking trails cater to different fitness levels, offering opportunities to explore the park’s dense forests and scenic landscapes.\n\nKaeng Krachan National Park\n\nEarning its title as the largest national park in Thailand, Kaeng Krachan is as diverse as it gets. The park boasts dense forests, cascading waterfalls, and undulating mountainous terrain.\n\nAmong its standout features is the majestic Pala-U Waterfall, a multi-tiered cascade enveloped by leafy vegetation. The park is also filled with wildlife, including elephants, elusive leopards, and an array of bird species.\n\nThe park is less than three hours drive from Bangkok, making it an unmissable addition to a trip to the Thai capital. We recommend taking a bus from Bangkok Mochit Bus Terminal, then hopping into a taxi to get to the park.\n\nErawan National Park\n\nCraving an escape in Thailand that combines nature’s beauty with outdoor adventure? Look no further than Erawan National Park in the Kanchanaburi Province.\n\nThis park is all about the majestic Erawan Waterfall, a cascading behemoth with seven tiers, each forming a turquoise pool – think real-life fairy pools you can actually swim in! Named after the mythical three-headed elephant, Erawan, the falls exude grandeur amidst lush greenery.\n\nBut Erawan isn’t just about waterfalls. Hike through a variety of terrain, from dense forests alive with monkeys and exotic birds to dramatic limestone hills offering panoramic vistas. Explore hidden caves like Phartat, adorned with sparkling stalactites, or cool off in the crystal-clear pools beneath cascading waters.\n\nPha Taem National Park\n\nIf you’re after a truly unique experience, visit Pha Taem National Park. At its heart lies the iconic Pha Taem Cliff, decorated in ancient rock art.\n\nAs you make your way through the park, you’re treated to breathtaking panoramic views of the Mekong River, a glimpse into the neighbouring country of Laos.\n\nAdding to the park’s geological allure are the fascinating Sao Chaliang formations — mushroom-shaped rocks that are otherworldly.\n\nKhao Luang National Park\n\nLocated in the southern reaches of Thailand, Khao Luang National Park invites you on an exhilarating journey through diverse landscapes.\n\nAt its centre stands Khao Luang Mountain, the highest peak in southern Thailand, shrouded in lush forests and boasting ecosystems teeming with life. Thrillseekers can lace up their boots for an adventurous trek to the summit, where panoramic vistas await as a reward for conquering this natural giant.\n\nRead Next: Picking an Ethical Elephant Sanctuary in Thailand\n\nKhao Sam Roi Yot National Park\n\nKhao Sam Roi Yot National Park, which translates to “Mountain with Three Hundred Peaks,” takes its name from the dramatic formations that define its skyline.\n\nFor those seeking an adrenaline rush, Khao Sam Roi Yot offers plenty of panoramic viewpoints. Don your hiking boots and head to the Khao Daeng Viewpoint for awe-inspiring vistas of the park.\n\nHead towards the coastline for boat trips that promise dolphins and access to hidden coves – the Phraya Nakhon Cave is one of the top attractions in this Thailand national park.\n\nKui Buri National Park\n\nSituated on the border of Myanmar in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, this hidden gem invites you to the heart of wildlife conservation at its finest. As a Wildlife Sanctuary, this park aims to preserve the habitats of elephants, gaurs, and banteng, among others.\n\nPicture-perfect viewpoints scattered across the park provide an immersive experience, allowing wildlife enthusiasts to spot elusive creatures.\n\nWe love that this park also offers wildlife safaris, immersing yourself in the rhythms of the grasslands and engaging in bird-watching escapades.\n\nDoi Suthep-Pui National Park\n\nJust a stone’s throw from the cultural hub of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand lies a haven of natural wonders — the Doi Suthep-Pui National Park.\n\nNamed after the prominent Doi Suthep Mountain, this sanctuary is home to the revered Wat Phra That Doi Suthep temple near its summit, adding a spiritual touch to its lush landscapes.\n\nAs you traverse the park’s trails, you’ll discover hidden gems like the refreshing Monthathan and Huay Kaew waterfalls. Both of which invite weary travellers to cool off in their pristine pools.\n\nCap off your exploration with a visit to the iconic Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, a cultural cornerstone that crowns this natural paradise.\n\nRead Next: Chiang Mai vs Pai: Which Should You Visit?\n\nSimilan Islands National Park\n\nNestled in the Andaman Sea, just off the coast of Phang Nga Province, lie the Similan Islands. It’s a diver’s paradise beckoning adventurers from around the globe.\n\nRenowned for their unparalleled diving and snorkelling experiences, these islands boast vibrant coral reefs teeming with an array of marine life. Beneath the surface, crystal-clear waters unveil a world of wonder, offering unparalleled visibility for underwater exploration.\n\nPrepare to be mesmerised by the rich marine biodiversity that calls these waters home. Snorkel alongside schools of tropical fish, or embark on island hopping escapades to uncover the hidden treasures of this pristine marine environment.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned diver or a first-time snorkeler, the Similan Islands promise an unforgettable adventure.\n\nRead Next: 16 of The World’s Best Snorkelling Spots\n\nTarutao National Park\n\nTarutao National Park is, without a doubt, one of the most underrated in Thailand. This sprawling archipelago, comprising 51 islands, offers a mosaic of landscapes ranging from lush forests to mangrove-lined shores.\n\nOnce a penal colony and pirate hideout, Tarutao holds secrets waiting to be uncovered amid its hidden alcoves. As you traverse the island paradise, encounter playful langurs and macaques – not to mention the array of bird species soaring overhead.\n\nWe think there’s something for everyone in this national park. Relax on sun-kissed beaches fringed by turquoise waters or embark on explorations of historical sites that bear witness to Tarutao’s colourful past.\n\nMu Ko Surin National Park\n\nMu Ko Surin is another of the best national parks in Thailand. It’s located in the Andaman Sea, off the west coast of Thailand, near the border with Myanmar.\n\nIf you’re looking for underwater fun, this is the place for you. You can snorkel alongside colourful coral reefs or take a deeper dive to find the hidden treasures of the Andaman Sea. If you’re lucky you might even spot ancient shipwrecks.\n\nOr, back on land, lace up your hiking boots and traverse the island trails, which wind through lush forests. Keep your eyes peeled for elusive wildlife, from playful monkeys swinging through the trees to majestic sea eagles soaring overhead.\n\nPhu Kradueng National Park\n\nPhu Kradueng National Park has slowly made a little bit of a name for itself amongst outdoor enthusiasts (ourselves included.) The park boasts a network of hiking trails, including the renowned Si Than trail. This path winds its way to the Phru Kradueng summit, promising both challenge and reward to intrepid trekkers.\n\nWith hiking being the primary activity, Phu Kradueng National Park caters to adventurers of all levels, offering trails suited to various fitness levels. Amidst the verdant forests and rugged terrain, hidden gems await. These come in the form of cascading waterfalls, like Tat Hin Yao and Tat Ya.\n\nFor those seeking the ultimate wilderness experience, camping facilities are available. Though, we think spending a day on the park’s trails before heading to nearby Chiang Mai is enough.\n\nSri Phang-Nga National Park\n\nIf you’re visiting Khao Sok, we also recommend swinging by the nearby Sri Phang-Nga National Park.\n\nAs you step into this park, you’re greeted by towering limestone hills. The park’s crown jewel, though, is the Tam Nang Waterfall. Taking a tour of the park is the best way to explore its hidden gems (and you can kayak along its waterways!)\n\nBeyond its visual splendours, Sri Phang-Nga National Park is also known for its winding cave systems, where ancient geological formations and hidden chambers await.\n\nAo Phang Nga National Park\n\nHidden away between Phuket and the Malay Peninsula, Ao Phang Nga National Park is a true gem. The park is renowned for its dramatic limestone karst formations that soar vertically from the emerald-green waters.\n\nThe park gained fame through James Bond movies, featuring the iconic limestone rock known as James Bond Island. There’s plenty to see and do here, including exploring sea caves and hidden lagoons, and sea kayaking.\n\nMap – The Best Thailand National Parks"
