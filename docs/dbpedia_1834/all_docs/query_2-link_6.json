        "text": "Thailand, renowned for its golden-sand beaches and ornately decorated temples, also reveals breathtaking natural treasures in its national parks. Whether you're a nature lover, an outdoor enthusiast, or simply looking for a change of scenery, these ten national parks in Thailand deserve a top spot on your list of destinations.\n\nEach site offers a unique and unforgettable experience. Get ready to immerse yourself in the natural splendor of these exceptional places and marvel at the beauty of nature at every corner.\n\nMai Vu, a young, dynamic, and passionate blogger, was born and raised in a coastal region imbued with the fusion of Asian cultures. Fluent in both English and French, she possesses in-depth expertise on Vietnam and other countries in the Mekong sub-region such as Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. She enthusiastically shares her unique knowledge and experiences through her blog articles. Explore the fascinating world of the Mekong sub-region through her stories, and feel free to ask questions by leaving a comment under her articles.\n\n1. Ang Thong National Marine Park\n\nOne of Koh Samui's best-kept treasures is an archipelago known collectively as Ang Thong National Marine Park. Made up of 42 islands, it's nestled in the Gulf of Thailand, near Surat Thani, and offers just about every natural wonder one can imagine. From hidden beaches to lush jungles, this park promises true immersion in nature for all types of adventurers.\n\nFor diving enthusiasts, Ang Thong is a must-see destination. The archipelago is home to exceptional marine biodiversity with various coral reefs and marine species. Each island group has unique surprises in store, giving you a unique diving experience at each stop.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of Ang Thong is the diversity of its forest formations. You'll find evergreen forests on the larger islands, while rainforests line the beaches near the high-water mark. On some islands, you'll discover limestone forests that are home to a variety of vegetation, including morinda and euphorbia. In addition, in the sheltered areas of the archipelago, you can explore the mysterious mangrove forests by kayak, especially on the island of Mae Koh, east of Phaluai.\n\nThe star attraction of the archipelago, located on the island of Koh Mae Ko, is the Emerald Lagoon. It is said that it was once a limestone cavern several hundred feet high, which eroded into a seawater lagoon, surrounded by limestone cliffs and connected to the sea by an underground tunnel. This site is simply stunning.\n\n2. Khao Sok National Park\n\nLocated in Thailand's Surat Thani province, Khao Sok National Park was once part of a much larger area, and research has shown that this area is even older than the Amazon. It's a mix of tropical rainforests and evergreen forests, where flora thrives thanks to the devotion of a team of rangers, conservationists, and determined local residents.\n\nThis region is famous for being the rainiest in all of Thailand, favoring a wide variety of vegetation and animals, totaling more than 350 species. The rivers, caves, and man-made lake of Cheow Lan offer a wealth of activities, such as boat trips on the lake and exploring fascinating caves.\n\nIn addition, the park is home to one of the largest flowers in the world, the rare Rafflesia kerrii, which is only found in Thailand, specifically in the Khao Sok area. It is recommended to fully experience this wonder of nature during the dry season, which runs from June to October, as between April and June, the rainy season can lead to flooding and make the trails slippery.\n\n3. Khao Yai National Park\n\nFor visitors staying in Thailand's capital city of Bangkok, Khao Yai National Park offers a peaceful getaway away from the noise and hustle and bustle. Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is a protected nature reserve and one of the largest in Thailand. Its biodiversity is staggering, home to elephants, black bears, gibbons, and a variety of birds, with a rare chance of spotting a tiger.\n\nAn ideal choice for trekking enthusiasts, Khao Yai National Park offers many hiking trails of varying levels of difficulty. Many of the shorter trails can be ridden independently, with clear markings and maps available at the Information Centre. However, if you are planning a longer hike in the heart of the jungle, it is recommended that you be accompanied by a professional guide who knows the area, both for your safety and to preserve the natural environment.\n\nWhile many hiking trails pass through dense forests, offering thick foliage all around you, several walkable viewpoints offer panoramic views of the park. The park is also dotted with waterfalls, the largest of which is Haew Narok, a three-tiered waterfall that pours its waters 150 meters, creating an impressive waterfall and forming numerous pools below.\n\nTo get to Khao Yai National Park, you can take a car or bus ride of about three hours from Bangkok.
