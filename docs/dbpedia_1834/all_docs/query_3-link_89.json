        "text": "Described as the Roof of Thailand, the National Park of Doi Inthanon is a breathtaking destination just a 90-minute drive outside Chiang Mai. Standing proudly at 2565m, the majestic mountain of Doi Inthanon is the highest peak in the country. Visiting this stunning part of Northern Thailand offers an unforgettable experience for nature enthusiasts and cultural explorers alike.\n\nWith its lush greenery, enchanting waterfalls, and mystical fog-covered forests, Doi Inthanon is a sanctuary of natural beauty. Beyond its awe-inspiring landscapes, this national park boasts a rich cultural heritage, including beautiful pagodas and vibrant hill tribe communities. It's a must-visit attraction in Chiang Mai - many tourists skip Doi Inthanon and miss out on experiencing its beauty, a big mistake. Visiting this National Park provides the perfect escape from the city's hustle and bustle and immerses visitors in tranquility and serenity.\n\nIf you still need convincing – Let us take you on a journey to find out why you should visit Doi Inthanon during your time in Chiang Mai.\n\nHiking\n\nDoi Inthanon is the end point of the Himalayan mountain range, making it one of Thailand's best hiking spots.\n\nThe National Park covers a distance of around 482 km², and there's no shortage of hiking trails to explore within its grounds. With various popular routes, there's a trail to suit everyone - regardless of experience and fitness level.\n\nThe Ang Ka Luang Nature Trail is one of Doi Inthanon's most popular routes, taking trekkers through a mossy forest, where you can spot unique plant species and enjoy panoramic views. If you're up for a challenge, the Kew Mae Pan Trail offers a rewarding trek with breathtaking vistas of the surrounding mountains. The nickname 'Heaven Trail' doesn't disappoint here.\n\nAnother popular trail within Doi Inthanon is The Pha Dok Siew Nature Trail, which showcases beautiful waterfalls, coffee plantations, and vibrant birdlife.\n\nYou are guaranteed incredible views, diverse flora, and fauna on whichever trail you hike.\n\nClick here to read more about the best trekking in Doi Inthanon National Park.\n\nWildlife\n\nThe Doi Inthanon National Park is a sanctuary of abundant wildlife containing captivating biodiversity. As you venture into its lush forests during your visit, you might be lucky enough to spot some of its inhabitants. Up in the trees, vibrant bird species like the rare green-tailed sunbird and the resplendent sibia watch your every move. Rare Gibbons also swing along branches in the trees, and you might hear their call echoing through the forest. Watch for the playful macaques swinging through the trees and the serpentine slither of the colorful green pit vipers. Wild boar and some species of deer also live in the forests of Doi Inthanon, and although they're hard to spot - you never know what you might see.\n\nUnfortunately, wild elephants and tigers are not roaming the jungles of Doi Inthanon anymore for a few decades now, but if you are interested in combining your visit to Doi Inthanon with a respectable elephant conservation project, you can do so at Living Green Elephant Sanctuary and Foundation formerly known as Maeklang Elephant Conservation.\n\nOf course, like everywhere in the world - seeing wildlife is never guaranteed. But you never know what you might be lucky enough to stumble across! Visiting Doi Inthanon with a guide is the best way to increase your chances of spotting wildlife, as they know the park inside out and have a keen eye for wildlife spotting.\n\nWaterfalls\n\nThe National Park is also home to some incredible waterfalls. Wachirathan, Siriphum, and Mae Ya are among the best ones to visit. Wachirathan Waterfall plunges down in a thunderous display, creating a colorful rainbow in the mist, surrounded by lush greenery. At the same time, Siriphum Waterfall boasts a multi-tiered cascade that sparkles in the sunlight. With its impressive height and crystal-clear waters, Mae Ya Waterfall is another great waterfall to visit, and witnessing it from below is a mesmerizing spectacle.\n\nVisiting the waterfalls in Doi Inthanon is a truly unbeatable experience. As you approach each waterfall, you'll hear the waterfall before you see it - the fierce roar of the rushing water greets you. You'll feel the misty spray that envelopes the surroundings. The waterfalls in Doi Inthanon are some of the most beautiful sites in Chiang Mai.

Explore the fascinating Karen and Hmong hill tribe villages, where you can immerse yourself in their rich traditions and witness their unique way of life. While interacting with members of the tribe, you'll gain insights into their craftsmanship, traditional clothing, and agricultural practices. Watching firsthand how people survive in such a remote location is a fascinating experience, and Doi Inthanon is one of the best places in Chiang Mai to do it.\n\nVisitors can also explore the Hmong market, with colorful stalls selling handicrafts, textiles, fruit, and delicious local treats. Engaging with the Hmong community, you'll discover their vibrant culture and have the opportunity to bring home beautiful souvenirs.\n\nThese cultural experiences add depth and diversity to your time spent in Doi Inthanon, leaving you with a greater appreciation for the region's vibrant heritage.\n\nSunrise/Sunset\n\nDoi Inthanon is a beautiful place to visit at any time of day, but sunrise and sunset offer an entirely next-level experience.\n\nAs the sun ascends or descends, the landscape undergoes a mesmerizing transformation. The golden hues of the sky blend with mist-shrouded peaks, casting an ethereal glow upon the verdant valleys below. The air is crisp, and the atmosphere brims with tranquility. At sunrise, the first light rays illuminate the summit, casting long shadows that gradually retreat as the day awakens. Sunsets paint the horizon with a fiery palette, igniting the clouds in orange, pink, and purple shades.\n\nVisiting at dusk or dawn also offers the chance to witness wildlife activity's awakening or winding down. Birds flutter and sing their morning melodies or bid farewell to the day in a symphony of chirps. By visiting the park in the morning or evening, you have a much higher chance of spotting some of Doi Inthanon's incredible wildlife, as it is less crowded, so the animals are less elusive.\n\nBe aware that the national park will be incredibly busy with locals visiting Doi Inthanon to experience the cold weather during the winter holidays. We recommend avoiding the national park from Christmas until after New Year's.\n\nThe Royal Project\n\nThe climate of Doi Inthanon and its surrounding areas means the soil is fantastic for agriculture. Coffee, fruit, vegetables, flowers, and herbs all thrive when grown here. Local tribal farmers used to grow opium in this area. Still, when King Bhumibol Adulyadej visited in 1969, he noticed that the farmers were impoverished. He decided to start an initiative to change this and eradicate Thailand's opium problem - the Royal Project. Opium poppies were swapped for crops that generate more income for farmers, roads were improved for fast distribution, dams were built to improve the number of crops per season, and the project (which is one of many in Thailand) has been highly successful in taking farmers in Northern Thailand out of poverty. Tourists can visit the project to learn more about how it has enriched local communities and admire the beautifully manicured gardens.\n\nIf you've decided to visit Doi Inthanon, a must-do activity in Chiang Mai, you've come to the right place. We offer two different Doi Inthanon tours to cater to everyone's taste, and booking one is the best way to make the most of your time in this incredible place.
