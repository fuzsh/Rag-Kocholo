For food lovers, white pork sausage, Thai sweet sausage, and northeastern-style fermented sausage are the must try.\n\nLocated on the banks of the Mun River, Ubon Ratchathani is a large, provincial capital city whose History dates back around two centuries, officially in 1780 when King Taksin the Great appointed the region’s first ruler and awarded the city its name. The city was governed by four semi-autonomous rulers until 1882 when it was appointed a governor as part of the Kingdom Siam.\n\nLocated in the lower region of Northeastern Thailand, 629 kilometers from Bangkok, Ubon Ratchathani province features plateaus and mountain ranges with the Mun River running through the middle. Sandstone cliffs along the Mekong River serve as a natural border between Thailand and Laos. This region, where Ubon Ratchathani borders both Cambodia and Laos and the Mekong flows into Cambodia has been coined “the Emerald Triangle” in recognition of its magnificent green landscapes. Adding to Ubon Ratchathani’s natural appeal, Phu Chong Nayoi and Pha Taem national parks are two of Isan’s most unspoiled and unvisited natural preserves.\n\nUbon Ratchathani province features plateaus and mountain ranges with the Mun River running through the middle.

Ubon Ratchathani, the north-east’s largest city, is also a wonderful place to witness the annual candle festival, a charming Buddhist celebration.\n\nBy: Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)\n\ncomments"
