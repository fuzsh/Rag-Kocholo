        "text": "Everything you need to know to visit Phu Chi Fa Forest Park in Northern Thailand.\n\nIncluding how to get there from Bangkok, what to see and photograph and where to stay!\n\nIf you love nature and the outdoors and seek stunning views and beautiful places to photograph as you travel Thailand, you must add Phu Chi Fa to your itinerary.\n\nIt’s a hidden gem that no one seems to have heard of.\n\nYou will escape the crowds in the South of Thailand and the busy city of Chiang Mai.\n\nPhu Chi Fa Forest Park also offers the most breathtaking views we encountered during our 3 months of travelling Thailand!\n\nWith stunning landscape views over Thailand and Laos, the surrounding mountain ranges and the Mekong River below, it is a hikers and photographers’ paradise!\n\nBut is it difficult to get to? And can you visit it in one day?\n\nPhu Chi Fa is not difficult to get to and we found the journey very straightforward.\n\nAnd yes you can visit in one day, but we recommend spending at least 1-2 nights here to experience everything the area has to offer.\n\nWe spent three nights at Phu Chi Fa Forest Park to maximise our time at sunrise and sunset for photography.\n\nWe visited both Phu Chi Fa Peak and Doi Pha Tang Peak, (more than once) and explored the area taking in the stunning views and nature.\n\nIf you are wondering if visiting Phu Chi Fa is worth it and whether you can fit it into your already busy itinerary, then this guide will tell you everything you need to know to plan your trip.\n\nWhether you choose to visit for just a day or a few nights.\n\nWhat is Phu Chi Fa?\n\nPhu Chi Fa (also known as Phu Chee Fah and Phu Chi Fah) is a mountainous area and National Forest Park in Northern Thailand.\n\nThe word “Phu” means mountain, usually, those mountains found in the Northeast of Thailand and the word “Fah” translates to sky.\n\nA little research from various sources seems to conclude that the loose translation is “mountain that points to the sky”!\n\nPhu Chi Fa Forest Park and Mountain are part of the Doi Pha Mon mountain range and offer spectacular 360-degree views of the surrounding area including views of Thailand and Laos!\n\nOther notable mountains close by are Doi Pha Tang, Phu Chi Dao and Phu Chi Duean, all of which we will share information on!\n\nPhu Chi Fa is found in the very North of Thailand, right on the border of Thailand and Laos in Chiang Rai Province.\n\nIt is roughly 85-90km from the closest large city of Chiang Rai and takes around 90 minutes to get there via car or motorbike.\n\nIf you are coordinating your travel plans from Chiang Mai then you will be pleased to know that visiting Phu Chi Fa is still doable and takes 4-5 hours by car and covers 262km.\n\nThe camera emoji is where you can find Phu Chi Fa!\n\nIt is off the beaten path of the usual tourist track and this is largely due to how far it is from the other more well-known things to do such as Doi Inthanon National Park in Chiang Mai or the temples in Chiang Rai.\n\nBut this means that the area feels like a true hidden gem!\n\nIt is popular with local Thai people, but when we visited we were the only backpackers around and it was far from “too busy”.\n\nAll of this is to say it is worth the effort to get there, especially if you are a keen photographer or have a love of beautiful views!\n\nHow long to spend in the Phu Chi Fa area?\n\nPhu Chi Fa Forest Park is breathtaking and is made up of four peaks that you can visit and photograph.\n\nBut it’s not a huge area and other than visiting the viewpoints you won’t find much more to do in the immediate vicinity.\n\nWe stayed for 3 nights which gave us plenty of downtime and ample opportunities at sunrise and sunset to get good weather conditions and recoup after those early starts!\n\nIf you are planning to visit on a day trip, the drive from Chiang Rai will take 90 minutes and you will need to leave around 3 am (depending on sunrise!).\n\nThis will ensure you reach Phu Chi Fa in time for the golden hour and witness the misty sea of clouds beneath the mountains which is pure magic!\n\nWhen is the best time to visit Phu Chi Fa?\n\nThe best time of year to visit Phu Chi Fa Forest Park in Northern Thailand is November – February.\n\nIt’s during these winter months that you have the best chance of witnessing the cloud inversions and the majestic sea of foggy clouds beneath you.\n\nThe best time of day to visit Phu Chi Fa (especially if you are visiting for photography) is sunrise, as by the afternoon any low-lying clouds have disappeared. This makes it the best time to capture the most beautiful images.\n\nPhu Chi Fa Mountain Peak\n\nPhu Chi Fa is the main attraction in the area and for good reason!\n\nThe mountain peak is 1442 metres high and offers 360-degree views across both Laos and Thailand.\n\nAt sunrise between November – February, you are likely to witness the breathtaking sea of fog beneath you as the sun rises!\n\nAnd as both photographers and travellers, it’s one of the most stunning landscapes we have ever seen!\n\nHow to get to Phu Chi Fa Peak?\n\nPhu Chi Fa has a decently sized free car park which opens (according to Google) at 4.30 am and closes at 6.30 pm.\n\nSo it opens in plenty of time to watch the sunrise.\n\nIf you do not have your transport then we would recommend either camping at the official campsite or staying at a lodge nearby and up.\n\nHow long is the hike to the top of Phu Chi Fa?\n\nThe “hike” to the first viewpoint from the car park takes around 15 minutes and is a distance of 700m. It’s not particularly steep but can be muddy so ensure you wear good shoes!\n\nThe hike to the very top viewpoint is a further 5-10 minutes but if you keep stopping to take photographs (as we did) then it can, and will, take much longer!\n\nIf you are camping or staying at a local lodge and you do not have a car, then you will walk an additional 30 minutes up a fairly steep but paved path to the starting point in the car park.\n\nHow long to spend at Phu Chi Fa Peak?\n\nThe viewpoints and area at the top are not particularly large and you can easily see each viewpoint and walk around in an hour.\n\nHowever, if you are there for photography then we would recommend allocating 2-3 hours as the scene will continue to change throughout golden hour.\n\nThe view with the blanket of fog beneath you will look dramatically different once the clouds between the mountains have cleared and you can see the full landscape and stunning scenery.\n\nBest Viewpoints for Photography\n\nView Point One\n\nThe first viewpoint you will reach is a plateau that you won’t miss as you make your way up the pathway. It is a flat patch of grass with the most stunning view over the sea of clouds beneath you.\n\nWe found this a great location to fly the drone since the crowds had continued up to the top of the mountain peak.\n\nView Point Two\n\nA short 5-minute walk will take you to the next spot which is a rocky outcrop on the right-hand side.\n\nFrom here you can capture the side of the cliff, the long grass and the clouds and mountains in the distance.\n\nIt’s a really beautiful viewpoint!\n\nView Point Three (The top of the mountain!)\n\nThere are so many stunning views of the mountain range from here that you will be spoilt for choice.\n\nIt’s a very unique and beautiful spot for photographing mountains.\n\nThe 360-degree views stretch over both Thailand and Laos and the scene continues to change as the clouds melt away.\n\nThere are also lots of brightly coloured wildflowers dotted around which are really pretty.\n\nPhotography Tips for Phu Chi Fa\n\nEnsure you visit at sunrise. Sunset will still offer gorgeous views but to capture the sea of clouds beneath you, you will need to plan your visit between November – February and be there early morning as the clouds clear by the afternoon.\n\nIt’s best to try and capture some of the mountains and the fog, rather than just the fog itself. Look for mountain peaks or trees in the fog to create points of interest within the photograph.\n\nAlong the edge of the mountains, you can use the yellow and pink wildflowers as a foreground to add colour to the image and show the season, which helps build a story around the photos.\n\nYou’ll need an ND filter because the sun will rise in front of you, meaning the clouds will be a very bright white. Using an ND filter will stop the image from being overexposed (too white).\n\nIf you do not have an ND filter or want some alternate perspectives, you can capture some scenes to the right and left down the mountain range to avoid harsh light. Because if you are taking photographs straight ahead you will be shooting straight into the sun which will result in blown-out images.\n\nAn hour after sunrise the light became too harsh and bright to see the detail in the landscape. It was a small window of time for photography so be sure to move quickly or pick your viewpoint carefully. Or even better, visit twice!\n\nThere were no signs prohibiting the use of drones, which there often are in Thailand if that’s the case. So we think as long as you have the correct registration in Thailand then it’s authorised to fly them. But be mindful of other drones as two others were flying when we had ours in the sky!\n\nVisiting Tips for Phu Chi Fa Peak\n\nThe car park is free and there are plenty of spaces.\n\nEntry to Phu Chi Fa Peak is free.\n\nThere are lots of small stalls in the car park selling tea, coffee, snacks, clothes and souvenirs.\n\nThere are free squat toilets you can use in the car park but ensure you bring your toilet paper.\n\nThe walk up and down to the peak was covered in mud and extremely slippery when we visited. So be sure to wear shoes with good grip and even better take a stick or walking pole to help you back down again.\n\nWhile Phu Chi Fa is off the main tourist track, it remains very popular with locals, so you can expect it to be busy with visitors. While they were not the excessive crowds we see on social media at the more well-known places in Thailand, you certainly won’t have this place to yourself at sunrise.\n\nDoi Pha Tang\n\nDoi Pha Tang is around 20km and a 40-minute drive from Phu Chi Fa Peak.\n\nThe mountain peak is 1900 metres high and has gorgeous views of neighbouring Laos and the surrounding mountain range, including Phu Chi Fa!\n\nIt’s also much less visited than Phu Chi Fa and we felt like we had the whole area to ourselves!\n\nHow to get there to Doi Pha Tang?\n\nDoi Pha Tang has a well-sized free car park and is around a 35-minute drive north of Phu Chi Fa (25km) on well-paved roads.\n\nIf you would rather use the area of Pha Tang as a base as we did, then Doi Pha Tang of course will be much closer. For us, it was just a 10-minute drive.\n\nIf you are using public transport to get from Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fa then Doi Pha Tang will be a little more difficult to get to.\n\nHowever, we would recommend speaking with your guest house owners as they may be able to arrange transport for you to and from Doi Pha Tang.\n\nHow long is the hike to the top?\n\nDoi Pha Tang has a longer hiking path and a more interesting route in our opinion than Phu Chi Fa.\n\nWe walked roughly 1-1.5km past lots of amazing viewpoints overlooking the Mekong River and Laos to the top and furthest viewpoint.\n\nThere are also lots of little side paths up and down the hills you can explore on the way to the top.\n\nHow long it takes you will depend on how many times you stop along the way.\n\nThe pathway is a mix of mud and dirt and some well-paved steps but it can be steep in places so be sure to wear good footwear!\n\nHow long to spend at Doi Pha Tang?\n\nWe visited Doi Pha Tang twice and spent 1-2 hours there each time.\n\nUnlike Phu Chi Fa which was a straight route up and down, Doi Pha Tang has lots of little corners and viewpoints to discover.\n\nYou will also find a beautiful pavilion dedicated to Chinese history and more specifically a General, who led people out of communist China and was granted an audience with the King for assisting and defending Northern Thailand.\n\nBest Viewpoints for Photography\n\nView Point One\n\nWalking up the steps from the car park you will find the first viewpoint on the right-hand side.\n\nThis is where you will also find the beautiful pavilion.\n\nFrom here you can observe views of the Doi Pha Mon mountain range and the Mekong River.\n\nView Point Two\n\nFurther along the pathway, you will come to a particularly scenic area with beautiful yellow Mexican sunflowers and large cliff rocks.\n\nIf you walk through these two towering cliff faces you will reach a breathtaking panoramic view over Laos and the Mekong River.\n\nDespite how stunning the view is, there are no foreground subjects available due to the steel railing.\n\nBut it does offer a different perspective of a very wide scene.\n\nView Point Three\n\nThis is the highest point of Doi Pha Tang and has views on one side over Laos and Thailand on the other side.\n\nYou can see the mountain ranges on both sides and beautiful views down into the valleys.\n\nWe had a cloud inversion over Laos but Thailand was clear offering contrasting views.\n\nThere are also some large gong bells which of course we rang and took the vibrating sounds as a sign to pause with our cameras and soak it all in!\n\nView Point Four\n\nThe view from the car park where you see the cartoon statues has incredible views of the surrounding mountain range and down into the valley.\n\nThere are also lots of Mexican sunflowers and other wildflowers dotted around which can be used as a nice foreground.\n\nPhotography Tips for Doi Pha Tang\n\nUnlike Phu Chi Fa Peak we found that sunset seemed to be the best option in December for photography. We found it to be very misty early morning which obscured a lot of the view but by the late afternoon, the cloudy weather seemed to have dissipated. However, if there are clear skies both sunrise and sunset would offer incredible views of the neighbouring mountains and Phu Chi Fa itself!\n\nIn between photographing the rolling clouds over the mountaintops, look for moments of light which will create an atmosphere in the scene\n\nDuring the winter months Mexican Sunflowers are in full bloom and make a great foreground subject to add colour. Use focus stacking to ensure the flowers and the mountains in the background are all in focus.\n\nTake a wide-angle lens to capture as much of the panoramic views as possible. This will also be useful for photographing foreground subjects like the Mexican sunflowers while including the mountains behind them.\n\nIf you are visiting at sunrise or sunset due to the low light conditions it’s best to use a tripod. If you are shooting in auto mode using a tripod will ensure your photos won’t be blurry due to camera shake. If you are shooting manually, a tripod will allow you to reduce the shutter speed below 1/30 to help achieve low ISO values.\n\nUse an ND filter for atmospheric photographs. An ND Filter will reduce the light coming into your camera sensor which will allow you to use long shutter speeds (around 1 second). Using longer shutter speeds will create swirling effects in the clouds as they move over the mountain.\n\nIf you do choose to visit Doi Pha Tang at sunrise and you have a drone, due to the altitude of the mountain, you can fly high enough over the clouds to capture the cloud inversions over Laos. Which makes for a very dramatic scene!\n\nThe area of Doi Pha Tang is home to Chinese Haw, Hmong and Yao villages so you may encounter stall vendors and villagers wearing their beautiful traditional dress. With their permission, you could get some nice portrait photographs of the ladies in the traditional dress and skirts.\n\nVisiting Tips for Doi Pha Tang\n\nThere is a huge car park that’s free and has toilets as well, both squat and western toilets. But as always when travelling in Asia, pack toilet tissue. If you forget to bring some you can buy some for 5 baht (11p/ 0.14usd).\n\nEntrance to Doi Pha Tang is free.\n\nThere is a wider range of stalls and shops at this car park than we found at Phu Chi Fa selling lots of food options, drinks and souvenirs. We sadly were unable to locate any vegetarian food but that was to be expected in this part of Thailand.\n\nDoi Pha Tang draws much fewer people than its neighbouring Phu Chi Fa so you may even get the area to yourself on a weekday.\n\nPhu Chi Dao and Phu Chi Duean\n\nAlongside Phu Chi Fa and Doi Pha Tang, there are two other peaks you can visit.\n\nWe did not have time to visit them but if you do find yourself with more time, and are seeking an alternate perspective, then Phu Chi Dao and Phu Chi Duean might be a good option.\n\nThey are, however, not as easily accessible and both require a 4X4 to reach the top. This can be hired locally at a cost of around 500 baht (13USD) according to the Thailand Tourist Board website.\n\nHow to get to Phu Chi Fa Forest Park Area\n\nThe easiest way to get to Phu Chi Fa is to have your transport, whether that be a car or a motorbike.\n\nWhile it’s not too far from the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, it is through mountainous areas and there are not many public transport options in the area.\n\nWe chose to hire a car as we travel with far too much luggage and we enjoy the independence of having our transport.\n\nThis is a relatively affordable option in Asia and as long as you have your international driver’s licence, a simple option.\n\nThat said, you CAN do it via public transport so it is still possible to visit Phu Chi Fa even if you do not have a driver’s licence.\n\nStep One – Bangkok to Chiang Mai\n\nIf you are coming to Thailand then the chances are you will have planned to initially come to bustling Bangkok to discover the incredible street food and unique temples!\n\nOnce you are ready to move on, the best (and most fun!) way to get to the North of Thailand and the city of Chiang Mai is by riding the overnight sleeper train!\n\nDespite any horror stories you may have heard about sleeper trains, we can assure you that this one will change your mind.\n\nIt’s clean, affordable and a very unique experience!\n\nYou can learn everything you need to know about taking the overnight sleeper train in our complete guide!\n\nIf you prefer to take a day train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai then there are ticket options for that too.\n\nStep Two – Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai\n\nOnce you are in Chiang Mai you have just a 3-hour drive to the city of Chiang Rai which is the closest big city to Phu Chi Fa.\n\nSelf-Drive (Hiring a Car or Bike)\n\nWe hired a car from Chiang Mai through booking.com and paid £18 / 23USD a day and this included full damage waiver insurance so that we would not have to pay an excess if we had an accident. If you are happy to pay an excess, then car rental can cost as little as $13 a day with insurance.\n\nThe journey was beautiful with lots of gorgeous coffee and snack shops on the way. But the roads are very windy with lots of hills and we made the mistake of taking a “shorter route” which we thought would be more scenic!\n\nResulting in us coming head to head with a steep incline with warning signs advising us to turn back.\n\nOur advice is to stick to the main roads on Google Maps – it’s still beautiful without the anxiety!\n\nPublic Transport\n\nThere are daily buses from Chiang Mai bus station to Chiang Rai Bus terminal that take around 3 hours 30 minutes and run every hour.\n\nYou can book your tickets online through 12go.asia and the cost is around £8 / 10 USD.\n\nWe use 12go.asia to book all of our bus and train journeys and we have used them over 10 times in the last 18 months with no issues or complications.\n\nTheir customer service is really good, often taking less than an hour or so to respond to queries and they resolve any queries very quickly. We highly recommend them when booking any transport during your Asia travels.\n\nStep Three – Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fa\n\nSelf Drive\n\nFrom Chiang Rai, your drive is just another 90 minutes to Phu Chi Fa Forest Park.\n\nIt’s a relatively easy drive in terms of navigation but involves many steep inclines and winding roads.\n\nIf you plan on visiting Phu Chi Fa for just one day only (although we recommend more!) then you will want to arrive before sunrise which will mean an early start and an overnight stop in the city of Chiang Rai.\n\nSunrise at Phu Chi Fa is our recommended option over sunset, (especially for photography!) as the stunning sea of fog below the mountains is at its best and has often dispersed by afternoon!\n\nPublic Transport\n\nIf you are using public transport and want to arrive at Phu Chi Fa for sunrise then you will need to travel there the day before by bus.\n\nThere is no direct connection from Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fa Forest Park but you can take the bus to Chiang Khong and then take a taxi to Phu Chi Fa Forest Park.\n\nTickets need to be secured in person at the Chiang Rai Bus terminal.\n\nWhere to stay in Phu Chi Fa Forest Park?\n\nIf you are considering staying in the area for longer than a day (which we wholeheartedly recommend that you do!) then you will be pleased to know that there are lots of accommodation options.\n\nThey are, however, pretty basic.\n\nYou will not find 5* hotels in the area, but instead lots of camping sites, little wooden huts white igloos and guesthouses.\n\nWe chose to stay in the area of Pha Tang which is 20km from Phu Chi Fa but it meant that we were very close to Doi Pha Tang (Just a 10-minute drive) and the accommodation had the best view we have EVER had during all of our travels.\n\nWe got so many amazing photographs and drone shots just from our little room!\n\nWe stayed at Ban Chomdoi Resort Pha Tang, which had both camping options and also little huts.\n\nWe opted for a hut as we had a lot of equipment to charge and we were staying for three nights and preferred to have an actual room rather than a tent to relax in.\n\nWhile the rooms do not have air conditioning, there is a ceiling fan and it was perfectly cool enough in December.\n\nThe main draw to Ban Chomdoi Resort Pha Tang is the breathtaking views!\n\nEach morning the valley beneath us was full of low-laying clouds and the cloud inversions remained for hours until well after midday.\n\nWe spent hours drinking Chinese tea and soaking in the stunning views beneath us!\n\nIt also meant for photography, that we were in the perfect location and we just stayed at the resort on occasion to capture the views from here.\n\nThe other factor which we loved was the food!\n\nGiven you are off the main tourist track you will not be surrounded by a huge choice of restaurants and cafes and for those you do find, there may not be any vegetarian options at all.\n\nBut the family-run Ban Chomdoi Resort catered for vegetarian food and dished up delicious meals which were always varied.\n\nWhen researching, we discovered that most of the accommodation options in the area of Phu Chi Fa are a little more expensive than Bangkok or Chiang Mai but you are paying for the beautiful location.\n\nThe Baan Chomdoi Resort was £27 / 34USD a night for a room including breakfast. And the additional meals were very reasonably priced at around £2.50 / 3 USD each.\n\nThe owners were also extremely friendly and we loved our stay here!\n\nWhere to eat at Phu Chi Fa\n\nPhu Chi Forest Park area and Pha Tang are off the beaten path and fairly remote locations.\n\nThere are restaurants and cafes but they are generally reached by car and a 5-10 minute distance from one another.\n\nIf you are vegetarian, then you will likely find it difficult to find the varied meals you may have had available in Bangkok or Chiang Mai.\n\nWe did eat at a restaurant in the area of Pha Tang for lunch one day as they had 1-2 veggie options.\n\nBut it was twice the cost of food at the Baan Chomdoi Resort, so we chose to eat the rest of our meals at our accommodation along with the friendly dog and cat!\n\nHow much money do I need to visit Phu Chi Fa?\n\nWe found Phu Chi Fa to be more expensive than the cities of Chiang Mai and Bangkok and it was likely due to the fact there were not that many food or accommodation options in comparison to those bigger cities.\n\nIt was also a stunning area!\n\nBeautiful National Parks in the UK always cost more than busy cities so why would Thailand be any different?\n\nYou are, after all, paying for those amazing views and the peacefulness of the area!\n\nAccommodation can be found for as little as £10-15 a night if you are happy to camp or if you want something a little more “luxurious” (but still basic!) then we highly recommend the Baan Chomdoi Resort for its views and food!\n\nPhu Chi Fa and Doi Pha Tang do not have an entrance fee but you will need fuel if you hire a car but this is very affordable in Thailand.\n\nWe spent around £20 / on fuel for the full three days including getting there and back from Chiang Rai.\n\nA bottle of water from a local shop was double the cost we paid in Chiang Mai and the same with a local restaurant.\n\nJust another reason we loved our guesthouse so much was because the food and drinks were very reasonably priced and of great quality.\n\nSo our recommendation would be to book somewhere with a restaurant on site.\n\nWhat to pack for a visit to Phu Chi Fa?\n\nWarm clothes! If you are visiting in the winter months between November – February then you will need layers. We visited at the start of November and we were wearing trousers and hoodies in the early hours and evening as it dropped to around 15c which was quite wonderful after sweating for days in Bangkok!\n\nGood walking shoes! The walks up to the peaks of both Phu Chi Fa and Doi Pha Tang are not particularly long but there are steep areas and it can get muddy. So ensure you have some trainers or walking boots with you.\n\nA flashlight or headlamp for those early starts or late evenings as there is no artificial lighting on the paths on both peaks.\n\nInsect repellant. You are surrounded by nature in Phu Chi Fa and that means a lot of mosquitos so bring repellant and a burning citronella coil if you plan to sit outside in the evenings.\n\nBring snacks and drinks from Chiang Rai. There are local shops in the area but you will have to go looking for them rather than having one just next door. They are also less expensive from Chiang Rai so be sure to bring anything you want with you.\n\nEnsure you withdraw enough cash for your stay as there are no ATMs or credit card facilities in the area.\n\nWhere to go after Phu Chi Fa?\n\nNorthern Thailand has so much more to discover than just Chiang Mai and Pai.\n\nThe dramatic mountains, landscapes and unique temples do not bring the usual mass tourism that other parts of Thailand see, so we highly recommend you allocate some time to exploring this beautiful part of the country.\n\nSo where next?\n\nDoi Mae Salong – Epic green mountain views, a rich Chinese history and sweeping tea plantations\n\nLampang – A breathtaking temple perched on top of a mountain\n\nDoi Inthanon National Park – Epic waterfalls, nature walks and mountain views and just 40 minutes from the city of Chiang Mai\n\nFAQs about Phu Chi Fa\n\nIs it possible to visit Phu Chi Fa on a day trip?\n\nYes, it’s possible to visit Phu Chi Fa on a day trip.\n\nHowever, if you do not want to stay overnight, but you would still like to arrive in time for sunrise, then you will need to arrange a private driver from Chiang Rai which is 1hr 45 minutes away.\n\nThis can be arranged through your guesthouse or online through Get Your Guide.\n\nIs the drive to Phu Chi Fa difficult?\n\nIf you are planning on driving yourself then you may be wondering if the drive is difficult.\n\nThe answer is no, the drive to Phu Chi Fa is very straightforward on well-maintained roads.\n\nThere are steep sections and some of the roads do wind through the mountains. But they did not feel dangerous.\n\nWe hired a car with a 1.6l engine and it made it up the mountains and around the area just fine.\n\nHowever, if we returned, we would either book a manual or a car with a slightly larger engine to make the journey easier.\n\nIs Phu Chi Fa worth it?\n\nVisiting Phu Chi Fa is 100% worth it.\n\nSure, it is off the main tourist track so may need some prior planning.\n\nBut that is exactly why it’s worth it!\n\nPhu Chi Fa is the most stunning area we have discovered in Thailand and is very peaceful in comparison to the busier South.\n\nIf you love nature, photography and beautiful views then Phu Chi Fa is a must-see when visiting Northern Thailand.\n\nWhat does Phu Chi Fa mean?\n\nThe rough translation seems to be “Mountain that points to the sky”!\n\nFinal Thought on Visiting the area of Phu Chi Fa\n\nIf you are looking for a true hidden gem in Thailand and you love breathtaking views then Phu Chi Fa is somewhere you should add to your itinerary.\n\nIt is not far from Chiang Rai and while it is a little remote this is exactly why we loved it.\n\nAs photographers, we are always looking for places that are lesser known and still retain the culture and authenticity of the place. Phu Chi Fa is all of those things.\n\nStunning views, friendly people, a rich history and countless photography opportunities!\n\nMore Asia Inspiration\n\nHow to Travel from Chiang Mai to Bangkok by Day Train in 2024\n\nHow to Visit Thailand’s Sky Temple in Lampang in 2024\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Wat Sam Phran Dragon Temple in 2024\n\nThe Overnight Sleeper Train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai\n\nMunduk In Bali – 11 incredible things to do\n\nTop Five Things to Do on Beautiful Nusa Penida\n\n11 Unique Things to Add to Your Ubud Bucket List\n\nEssential Information when visiting Bali\n\nHow to Spend 3 Nights in Kuala Lumpur\n\nPhotography Tips to Elevate Your Photos\n\nWhen is the best time to take pictures outside?\n\nPractical Tips to Elevate Your Photography on a Cloudy Day"
