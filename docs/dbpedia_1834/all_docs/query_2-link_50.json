The first fossils—discovered in 1976 by a uranium survey team on the hill Pratu Ti Ma—were a long neck and tail of a 15-meter-long dinosaur. The plant-eating dinosaur was named Phuwiangosaurus Sirindhornae to honour H.R.H Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. At this site, the teeth of a meat-eating Tyranosaur have also been found. It was named Siamosaurus Suteethorni after the discoverer, Mr. Warawuth Suteethorn. Visitors to the park can visit all three of the main fossil sites. The fossils themselves are now displayed in the museum of the Department of Mineral Resources. The oldest, the fossils of Siamotyrannus Isanensis, are 120 to 130 million years old. This indicates that tyrannosaurus originated in Asia. At Site No. 8 are 68 footprints of dinosaurs, dating back 140 million years ago. Most of them belong to the world's smallest species of meat-eating dinosaur, which walked on two legs. Among such footprints, there is one bigger footprint, assumed to belong to Carnosaurus. These sites are 19 kilometers from the headquarters. It takes an hour to get there by car and a four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended.

The Ban Chiang site, located in this area, features burial grounds that have produced beautiful painted pottery, and bronze object dated, using several methods, to 4000 B.C., almost 1,500 years before bronze was developed anywhere else in the world. Some of these objects are in the fine Udon Thani bronze age museum along with skeleton, tools and pottery.\n\nModern Udon Thani itself is a busy transportation hub. The city expanded greatly in the Vietnam War era when U.S. used air bases there. From 1965 to 1976, the Royal Thai Air Force Base in Udon housed a large contingent of U.S. Air Force personnel. The base was heavily used in the Vietnam War. Planes that ran bombing missions over Laos, Cambodia and Hanoi sometimes took off from here. Some GIs still live in the area. Outside of town a $200 million Voice of American transmitter was built in the 1990s. There isn’t a lot interest to the tourists. Udon Thani is a major transportation hub for Northeastern Thailand. Geographically, the province is located on a plateau which is approximately 187 meters above sea level. Most of the area is covered with rice fields, forests, and hills; the Phu Pan mountain range and the Songkhram River are the provinces two primary natural attractions. The inhabitants of Udon Thani are mainly engaged in agricultural activities, and the capital city is a major agricultural market center for its neighboring provinces. Udon Thani is also known for its forest temples, Khit-style textiles and as a gateway to Laos.\n\nTourist Office and Website: Tourism Authority of Thailand , Udon Thani Office, 16/5 Mu kilometers ontri Road , Tambon Makkheng, Amphoe Mueang, Udon Thani 41000, Tel. +66 4232 5406-7, Fax. +66 4232 5408, E-mail Address: tatudon@tat.or.th, Accommodation: Although not a major center for tourism, there are variety of accommodation options for visitors to choose from because Udon Thani is a major regional hub for transport and commerce. Website: tourismthailand.org/udonthani;\n\nPoo Pra Bat Historical National Park (70 kilometers from Udon Thani) features some interesting rock formations and caves with perhistoric paintings of animals, humans and mysterious symbols. Covering an area of of 5.488 square kilometers and is situated on Poo Pan Mountain, it is believed that Poo Pra Bat was a sacred place to perhistoric people, who regarded it as the entrance to the underworld. The most outstanding tourist attraction here is Nang Usa tower—a sandstone rock pillar—which it appears in many local myths. This tower occurs as a result from natural erosion. The upper part contains a chamber assumed to be used for religious ceremonies. There are also boundary markers around this tower that are still in good condition. Getting There: The park is situated in the Poo Pan foothills. Visitors can travel from Udonthani by taking Highway 2 (Udonthani-Nongkai) then turn on to highway 2021 at milestone 13. Then follow the road to Amphur Baan Pue for around 42 kilometers and turn right and go straight down highway 2348 for around 12 kilometers.\n\nGetting to Udon Thani\n\nAs a major transportation center, Udon Thani can be reached a number of ways directly from cities around northeastern and central Thailand, including via private car, bus, train, or airplane.

Songtaews are the most common form of transportation in Udon Thani and follow different routes, designated by their number and color. There are no fixed “bus stops” per se; passengers simply hail them as they pass. Be sure to tell them where you are headed so as to get on the right songtaew. Fares should be fixed at around 6 baht for trips within and along the city ring-road and 10 baht for longer journeys. The price goes up to 15 baht after 7.00pm and songtaews are generally off duty by 8pm. Motorized samlors (a type of tuk tuk) charge a negotiated fare based on the distance, while pedal powered samlors cost less and are more pleasurable, if slower modes of transport; always agree on a price before boarding. Samlors are the only way to get around after dark, as buses and songtaews stop shortly after sunset. There are two city buses: white and yellow. Trips around town cost between 5 and 15 baht depending on distance.\n\nBan Chiang and the World’s First Bronze\n\nBan Chiang (50 kilometers east of Udon Thani) contains the excavations of the world’s oldest Bronze Age culture. The small but excellent Ban Chiang National Museum embraces part of the original Ban Chiang excavation and displays prehistoric artifacts found in the area, including a lot of painted pottery, beads, bronze artifacts, and 3,000-year-old human skeletons. Bronze artifacts have been discovered in northern Thailand, around the village of Ban Chiang, that were dated to 3600 to 4000 B.C., more than a thousand years before the Bronze Age was thought to have begun in the Middle East. The discovery of these tools resulted in a major revision of theories regarding the development of civilization in Asia.\n\nThe first discoveries of early Bronze Age culture in Southeast Asia were made by Dr. G. Solheim II, a professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii. In the early 1970s, he found a socketed bronze ax, dated to 2,800 B.C., at a site in northern Thailand called Non Nok Tha. The ax was about 500 years older than the oldest non-Southeast-Asia bronze implements discovered in present-day Turkey and Iran, where it is believed the Bronze Age began. [Source: Wilhelm G. Solheim II, Ph.D., National Geographic, March 1971]\n\nNon Nok Tha also yielded a copper tool dating back to 3,500 B.C.. and some double molds used in the casting of bronze, dating back to 2300 B.C, significantly older than similar samples found in India and China where it is believed bronze metal working began. Before Solheim it was thought that the knowledge of bronze working was introduced to Southeast Asia from China during the Chou dynasty (1122-771 B.C.). Solheim is sometimes called \"Mr. Southeast Asia.\"\n\nBan Chiang site is located on he Khorat Plateau in northeastern Thailand. Among the discoveries made at a 124-acre mound site there were bracelets and bronze pellets (used for hunting with splits-string bows), and lovely painted ceramics dated to 3500 B.C. Most of the bronze made Ban Chiang is ten percent tin and 90 percent copper. This it turns out is ideal proportion. Any less tin, the metal fails to reach maximum hardness. Any more, the metal becomes too brittle and there is more of a chance it will break during forging. The Ban Chiang culture also developed bronze jewelry with a silvery sheen by adding 25 percent tin to the surface layers of the bronze at a heat of 1000°F and plunging it quickly into water. See ANCIENT HISTORY OF THAILAND, ORIGIN OF THE THAIS AND THE THAI NAME AND WORLD'S FIRST BRONZE AGE CULTURE factsanddetails.com\n\nBan Chiang Archaeological Site: UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nBan Chiang Archaeological Site was designated a a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992. According to UNESCO: Ban Chiang is considered the most important prehistoric settlement so far discovered in South-East Asia. It marks an important stage in human cultural, social and technological evolution. The site presents the earliest evidence of farming in the region and of the manufacture and use of metals. [Source: UNESCO]\n\n“Ban Chiang was the centre of a remarkable phenomenon of human cultural, social, and technological evolution in the 5th millennium BC, which occurred independently in this area of south-east Asia and spread widely over the whole region. It is without question the most important prehistoric settlement so far discovered in south-east Asia. It presents the earliest evidence for true farming in the region and for the manufacture and use of metals: its long cultural sequence, size and economic status has no parallel in any other contemporary site in the region.\n\n“Recent archaeological work at Nok Nok Tha and, later, Ban Chiang on the Khorat plateau of north-east Thailand has demonstrated that in south-east Asia prehistory was culturally backward. This area of modern Thailand has been shown by excavation and field survey to have been the centre of a cultural development in the 4th millennium BC that was an independent from China to the north and India to the west over much of south-east Asia and beyond into the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n“Settlement of the Khorat plateau began around 3600 BC. The settlers came from the neighbouring lowlands, bringing with them a hunter-gatherer economy that was beginning to develop sedentary farming, with domesticated cattle, pigs, and chickens and an elementary form of dry-rice cultivation. The settled village life of this Early Period at Ban Chiang lasted until around 1000 BC. Agricultural methods were refined and improved, along with other skills such as house construction and pottery manufacture. The equipment of burials reflects an increasing social complexity.\n\n“The Middle Period (1000-500/300 BC) was notable for the introduction of wet-rice farming, as evidenced by the presence of water buffalo bones, and technological developments in ceramic and metal production. It was a time of considerable prosperity, as shown by the grave-goods, and one which saw the introduction of iron into common use. Although occupation appears to have ended at Ban Chiang in the 3rd century AD, while continuing at other sites in the region, Ban Chiang is considered to have been the principal settlement in this area of the Khorat plateau and has given its name to a distinctive archaeological culture. The prehistoric settlement, a low oval mound established by Laotian refugees in the late 8th century, lies beneath the modern village of Ban Chiang. Only very limited excavation has been possible in the settlement site, but this has established the existence of deep stratification and long cultural continuity.\n\n“The main excavations have taken place on the perimeter of the modern village, where a large number of burials from all three periods, with rich ceramic and metal grave-goods, have been revealed and recorded. One of the excavations has been preserved for public viewing, with a permanent cover building: there is an excellent site museum in another part of the village.”\n\nHistory of Ban Chiang Archaeological Site\n\nAccording to UNESCO: Until the 1960s. south-east Asia was considered to have been a culturally backward area in prehistory. The generally accepted view was that its cultural development resulted from external influences, principally from China to the north and India to the west. Recent archaeological work at Nok Nok Tha and, later, Ban Chiang on the Khorat plateau of north-east Thailand has demonstrated this view to be incorrect: this area of modem Thailand has been shown by excavation and field survey to have been the centre of an independent, and vigorous, cultural development in the 4th millennium BC which shaped contemporary social and cultural evolution over much of southeast Asia and beyond. into the Indonesian archipelago.

Of especial importance was the growing use of bronze, for weapons and personal ornament in the earlier phase but spreading to more utilitarian applications in the later phases.\n\n“The Middle Period (lOOO-500/300 BC) was notable for the introduction of wet-rice farming, as evidenced by the presence of waterbuffalo bones, and technological developments in ceramic and metal production, It was a period of considerable prosperity, as shown by the grave-goods, and one which saw the introduction of iron into common use. In the Late Period (500/300 BC-AD 200/300) there was further social and technological development. especially in ceramic design and production. Although occupation appears to have ended at Ban Chiang in the 3rd century AD, at other sites in the region, such as Non Maung and Ban Prasat, settlement was continuous into the 16th century and later.\n\n“Ban Chiang is considered to have been the principal settlement in this area of the Khorat plateau and has given its name to a distinctive archaeological culture. Scores of contemporary sites have been discovered in the region, at several of which excavations have been carried out. The prehistoric settlement lies beneath the modern village of Ban Chiang (established by Laotian refugees in the late 18th century). It is a low oval mound some 500m by 1.3km. Only very limited excavation has been possible in the settlement site, but this has established the existence of deep stratification and long cultural continuity.”\n\nPhuphrabat Historical Park\n\nPhuphrabat Historical Park (30 kilometers southwest of Vientiane, Laos and 70 kilometers northwest of Udon Thani) was nominated to be a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004 According to a reported submitted to UNESCO: “The site is the landscape of a wooded sandstone hill adorned with patches of huge bare rocks in spectacular overhanging positions, some balanced on pedestals of oddity. This scenic and awesome beauty of nature has had, over the millennia since prehistoric times, a compelling spiritual effect on humans in the neighbourhood to associate the site with sanctity, as evidenced by the presence of visual arts of different cultural periods. The scenic Phuphrabat associative cultural landscape is unique in that this single site contains authentic cultural treasures that represent major cultures of different periods of the region, effectively epitomizing the continuum of the whole cultural history of mainland Southeast Asia.

The iconic representations comprise sculptures in low and high relief as well in the round, representing the earliest Buddhist Dhvaravadi civilisation as well as the successive Hindu Khmer and Buddhist Lanchang cultures. It is significant that both Dhvaravadi and Khmer images carried the unmistakable native characteristics typical of the Laotian trait, which finally developed and established itself as what is known as the Lanchang Buddhist culture paralleling the art style of Ayuthaya in central Thailand.\n\nSignificantly, among the religious representations on Phuphrabat hill, there are also two symbolic footprints of Lord Buddha of carved stone at ground level in the Lanchang art style. It is for this reason that the hill is known as \"Phuphrabat\", which means the Hill of Buddha's Footprints. There exists up to this day a small, unobtrusive monastery, which houses one of the Buddha's Footprints in a small, proportionate stupa. All this added to the uniqueness of Phuphrabat and harmonised with its overall cultural landscape and its significance as a sacred and ceremonial place. Phuphrabat hill is a disconnected ridge on the eastern edge of Phu Phan Range.\n\nThe hill is about 352 metres above mean sea level, 9 km long from North to South, and 2 km wide. Surrounded by greenery, Phuphrabat is bordered to the west by an escarpment sloping down towards the east. The forest area on the hill and in the adjacent lowland surroundings is a mix of dry evergreen forest, dry dipterocarp forest and dry mixed deciduous forest all in undisturbed state. The historical park proper, which includes the wooded area on the hill, as gazetted in April 1981, covers an area of 3430 rais (548.8 hectares), accommodating 81 cultural locations, all associated with the exposed patches of bare rocks on the hill. In addition to this associative physical connection between nature and culture, an age-old Laotian legend had also added another cultural dimension to the cultural context of the Phuphrabat hill and the associated groups of wondrous formations of the exposed bare rocks. Their individual imagination-inspiring identities had been ascribed to and named after the mythical figures of the Usa-Baros dramatic legend of ancient Vientiane's origin It should be noted that no evidence or trace has been found to suggest that people at any time had ever lived on Phuphrabat hill; they went up there only to conduct religious or other solemn ceremonies as evidenced by the presence of religious images and representations. The whole landscape of Phuphrabat hill, including the forest park and the historical park, will be nominated for inscription on the World Heritage List.\n\nImage Sources:\n\nText Sources: Tourist Authority of Thailand, Thailand Foreign Office, The Government Public Relations Department, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Times of London, Lonely Planet Guides, Library of Congress, Compton’s Encyclopedia, The Guardian, National Geographic, Smithsonian magazine, The New Yorker, Time, Newsweek, Reuters, AP, AFP, Policy, Wikipedia, BBC, CNN, and various books and other publications.\n\nLast updated August 2020"
