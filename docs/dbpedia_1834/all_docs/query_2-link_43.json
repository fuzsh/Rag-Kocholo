        "text": "Basically, a rainy season of the upper part of the country (northern, northeastern, western, eastern and central) is between June to mid October. However, it is different pattern in the south and more complicated, because it is not the same across the southern peninsula. The west coast has a rainy season from April to October, while the east coast sees their rainy season from September through December. Thereby, a good birding period of the west coast of the south is quite similar to the upper part of the country from November to April. But when migratory species left Thailand, a precious time in the south starts, the breeding season of resident species (rare, uncommon and elusive birds will be very active and easier to see). It shifts slightly later than the other regions, which is between May to October. Even though this period we will only connect with resident species, but almost of them are completely different from the other regions. From May to July, Sri Phang-nga NP, Khao Nor Chu Chi, Cheow Lan Lake, Krung Ching Waterfall and Thale Ban NP are recommended.\n\nThere is a really special place at the southernmost of the country right on the border of Thailand and Malaysia, Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary, it holds a longer breeding season starts from June to September. At least 3 days in Hala-Bala will be very productive for many rare and uncommon residents. But a one-week trip can be arranged by also visiting few more reserved forests and national parks nearby.\n\nA longer trip such as 14 days would be a great idea by starting from Sri Phang-nga NP, Krung Ching Waterfall, down to Thale Ban NP and finish up at Hala-Bala.\n\nIn conclusion, Thailand is excellent for birding all year round depends on where you have planned to go. Your birding adventure in Thailand can happen at any time of the year. Discuss with us if you keen to explore the south of Thailand. You can also incorporate Kaeng Krachan National Park in the southern parks itinerary (Sri Pang-nga NP, Cheow Lan Lake, and Krung Ching Waterfall). These high seasons of birding at different parts of the country can exactly applied to a bird photography tour too."
