        "text": "Firstly we’d like to point out that as far as we’re concerned all travel should be as ‘responsible tourism’ and ‘sustainable’ as possible, (it can never be 100% so), and that should go without saying. We don’t like making a song and dance about it and object to the use of terms such as eco, green, sustainable or responsible tourism as simple slogans or marketing tools. That said, we will outline a few of our thoughts, policies and specific projects in the area of responsible tourism.\n\nGroup Sizes\n\nOne simple method to reduce impact and improve responsible tourism credentials is to reduce group sizes and, with our scheduled tours limited to either 10 or 12 persons maximum, we’d say All Points East’s group sizes are genuinely small. Again ‘small group tours’ has become something of an advertising slogan – even if the group concerned sometimes comprises up to 20 persons or more. Experience has shown that small group tours offer major benefits in various areas and therefore are integral to our concept of responsible tourism.\n\nFurthermore, service is inevitably improved with a higher ratio of guides and tour leaders to guests and we are able to offer a more personalized service. Information and directions are passed on more easily and a high level of flexibility can be maintained, which isn’t possible with larger groups.\n\nIn terms of transport, small groups allow for smaller vehicles as well, on occasions, the use of public transport where appropriate. This has practical as well as ecological benefits. With regards to restaurants and accommodation, we can also use smaller, locally run restaurants and accommodation that larger groups wouldn’t be able to do. Again, another essential element of our tours.\n\nAnother significant advantage is when visiting local people, villages, tribal groups and so on. A smaller group obviously has far less impact, is far less intimidating and there’s a much greater chance of a warm welcome and opportunities for genuine interaction. (No villager is going to invite 18 people in for a cup of tea!)\n\nSimilar benefits arise with respect to any nature-based activities: hiking, snorkelling, bird watching etc. Not only do smaller groups have a less negative impact on the natural environment but, as above, it is easier for a guide to transmit instructions and knowledge. There is also far more chance of spotting birds and wildlife with lower numbers.\n\nLast but not least – on an enjoyment level, small numbers create a much more cohesive group with far less chance of cliques or ‘groups within groups’. It’s often been described by those who travel with us – and we’ll allow ourselves a pat on the back at this point – as, “…more like a group of friends and not like a tour group at all”.\n\nOff-the beaten-track Destinations\n\nAnother core feature of our responsible tourism thinking is including outside-of-the-box destinations; not going to the same destinations every time – spreading the tourist dollar around a bit and so on! Taking in the famous sites is, of course, essential but providing a balance between these ‘must-sees’ and the off-the-beaten-track, ‘best-kept secrets’ is, in our opinion, key. It’s the rarely visited sites, not usually included in tour itineraries, which we believe frequently provide a more authentic insight into the destinations visited as well as improving responsible tourism credentials.\n\nNot only does this mean you will visit remoter sites which most people don’t get to see, but also that the people living in these less frequented areas benefit from the tourist dollar. The vast majority of tourism in Southeast Asian countries only touches a few key sites: e.g. in Cambodia only a very small percentage of visitors get to see anything other than the temples of Angkor, or at a push Phnom Penh. In the case of Thailand, the vast majority of the country’s tourism revenue is spent in Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui and Chiang Mai.\n\nPeople from Eastern Thailand hoping to benefit financially from tourism would more than likely end up having to go hundreds of miles to work in Bangkok or Pattaya and anyone wishing to do the same in Western Cambodia would converge on Siem Reap. This leads to social problems and depopulation in these rural areas and creates a serious imbalance in wealth between such regions.\n\nResponsible Tourism – Meals\n\nLocal food and meals are an essential part of any culture therefore, in our opinion, an essential part of understanding new cultures is discovering their traditional food and eating styles. That’s why on all our tours, meals are, as much as possible, based on authentic regional food eaten in local restaurants, and whenever possible, we avoid eating in hotels and fancy tourist establishments. A Thai green curry eaten in a Western chain hotel is probably going to be altered for the Western palate and identical to those found in many high street restaurants back home, whereas one eaten in a bustling night market is going to be the real McCoy!\n\nThis means better and more authentic food and also means our custom is going directly to small cafés and market vendors rather than big businesses plus it often provides more opportunities for interaction with local people. (The elderly couple running the village coffee shop near Battambang get so excited every time they see a group of foreigners turning up!)\n\nBy eating in this manner we are encouraging local people to offer local alternatives to visitors and indeed to increase pride in their traditional cuisines. It’s a sad state of affairs – and perhaps a reflection on many tourists – that in many areas, local people are of the impression that all foreigners want to eat pizzas or spagbol! It’s nice to show the locals otherwise.\n\nNever fear, we won’t force anyone to eat fried bugs, (though please feel free to try them), and hygiene considerations are always high on our priorities – as are traveller’s chilli tolerance levels! Note also that most Asian cuisine can easily accommodate vegetarian and vegan diets, and again with smaller groups, individual tastes can be far more easily catered for.\n\nNational Parks and Protected Areas\n\nIf governments see that creating and maintaining National Parks can create revenue, then it is an incentive for them to preserve such areas, and create new ones, instead of just going for short-term gain from logging and endless plantations.\n\nFurthermore, if local communities can see that national parks, forest reserves, wildlife sanctuaries etc bring in revenue for local communities, as well as employment for local people, then it is a big incentive for them to respect such protected areas and participate in responsible tourism schemes.\n\nWe, therefore, feel it is essential to incorporate as many such protected areas into our itineraries as possible – not only to show the scenery and exotic flora and fauna to visitors – but also to encourage authorities and local people to establish and take care of such areas.\n\nBelow is a list of just a few of the national parks and protected areas included on All Points East tours.\n\nCambodia National Parks\n\nPhnom Kulen National Park – spectacular scenery, unique flora and great historic interest\n\nTonle Sap, UNESCO Biosphere Reserve – wetlands, bird-life, traditional lifestyles.\n\nKep National Park – coastal scenery\n\nIndonesia National Parks\n\nGunung Leuser National Park – World Heritage Site in Sumatra\n\nAlas Purwo – Rarely-visited park in southeastern Java.\n\nLaos National Parks\n\nXe Pian National Protected Area – wetlands, extensive lowland forest, flora and fauna.\n\nNam Ha National Biodiversity Area – forest, mountains, flora and fauna\n\nMalaysia National Parks\n\nBelum Forest, Royal State Park – scenery, extensive primary forest, mountains, abundant flora and fauna\n\nPerhentian Islands National Marine Park – coastal scenery and well preserved aquatic flora and fauna\n\nMount Kinabalu National Park – mountain scenery, rainforest, Mt Kinabalu\n\nSepilok Orangutan Sanctuary – forest and orangutan rehabilitation centre\n\nKinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary – lowland rainforest and riverine flora and fauna, abundant birdlife and primates.\n\nSri Lanka National Parks\n\nWilpattu National Park – wildlife including large mammals.\n\nMinneriya National Park – including the world-famous ‘elephant gathering’\n\nHorton Plains National Park – wildlife and spectacular scenery\n\nThailand National Parks\n\nKhao Yai National Park – Natural World Heritage Site\n\nKhao Sok National Park – Spectacular limestone formations and bountiful wildlife.\n\nKhao Luang National Park – The highest mountain in South Thailand – Tropical montane scenery, waterfalls.\n\nPha Taem National Park – Prehistoric cliff paintings and unusual rock formations.\n\nVietnam National Parks\n\nPhu Luong National Park – spectacular mountain scenery and minority villages.\n\nPhong Nha – Ke Bang – home to some of the World’s largest cave systems\n\nSome community projects We’ve been involved in\n\nBan Khone School – A completed project\n\nOne of the successful, earlier projects that All Points East and our travellers were involved in was raising financing for the construction of a new village primary school in Don Khone Nua Village on Don Khone Island, Laos; a village that we’ve visited for a number of years on our South Lao tours.\n\nThe existing ‘schoolhouse’ for this large village was, to say the least, pitiful (and roofless) and a project was organized by Peter Cochrane, (former All Points East tour leader), to organise donations in order to provide funds for the construction of a new building, as well as some basic items for the finished school.\n\nHere are the results — not exactly beautiful but at least functional with solid walls, roof and toilet facilities for the kids and certainly much appreciated by all concerned. Thanks again to all those involved for making a difference for the families and kids of a remote Lao village.\n\nBan Phayaprai Children’s Centre – An Ongoing Project\n\nOur current project, organised by our Thailand manager Wipaporn (Wi), is providing support to a kindergarten in a village in far northern Chiang Rai Province on the Thai-Burmese border. Most of the area’s inhabitants are impoverished hill-tribe families (mainly Akha and Lisu) as well as Shan refugees from over the border. The centre then provides daycare and basic education for kids allowing both parents to go out and work. A great initiative but funding is a constant problem so our scheme helps out with both financing and material assistance. In recent times funding has helped construct new classrooms while we’ve also provided the centre with bedding and mosquito nets as well as educational materials."
