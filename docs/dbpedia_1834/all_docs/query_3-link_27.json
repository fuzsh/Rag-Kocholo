Including the parks that are not yet published in the Government Gazette, the total area of national parks reaches more than 71,000 square kilometers (around 17 million acres) which are around 14% of the total area of the country. The biggest national park is Kaeng Krachan National Park, with a territory of over 2,900 square kilometers. The smallest national park is Mae Puem National Park covering an area of only 35 square kilometers.

Most of them charge entrance fees which range from approximately 100 baht (~ 2,74 €) to 500 baht (~ 13,70 €). However, it is impossible to determine a single price as the entrance fees differ from park to park. In addition, most of them charge less for children. Also, keep in mind that some parks have a limited number of visitors per day and a lot of the parks are not open year-round due to the rainy season, pollution or other factors.\n\nMap of national parks in Thailand\n\nNational parks in Thailand FAQs"
