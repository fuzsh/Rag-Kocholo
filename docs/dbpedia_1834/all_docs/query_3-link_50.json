Ubon Ratchathani has been a well established community for hundreds of years. Relatively unknown to the most tourists, the province boasts a number of natural wonders, cultural and historical attractions, national parks, silk producing shops, etc.\n\nThe province is renowned for its strong Buddhist tradition, particularly the practice of forest-dwelling monks and the ancient Buddhist temples, which can still be seen throughout the province today.\n\nThere are many tourist attractions which are very interesting that should know.\n\nMain attractions"
