        "text": "Not far from the border of Laos, you will find Ubon Ratchathani. It means Royal Lotus City and is often called Ubon for short. It’s probably the best-hidden gem that Thailand has to offer because here you will find extraordinary national parks and a canyon.\n\nPha Taem National Park\n\nIf you’re into prehistoric history, you will love this national park in Ubon Ratchathani. “mushroom-shaped rocks” were produced by years of erosion, but the park is also known for numerous prehistoric cave paintings that date back 3000 – 4000 years ago. I was impressed by the well-kept hand prints and drawings these people made so many years ago. The drawings feature people, animals, and their use of Buk fishing. The whole area is rather special and when you walk beside the cliff, it’s pretty amazing to imagine how this area must have looked so many years ago. The entrance is 400 bath for adults and 200 bath for kids. There is a small café where you can get amazing ice-coffees and juices, and you’re probably going to need it!\n\nIs it a mushroom? (yes, that’s me in the middle)\n\nSam Phan Bok\n\nThe Grand Canyon of Thailand and a place you cannot miss while visiting this part of the country! The area consists of thousands of holes (San Phan Bok translates to 3000 holes), some filled with rainwater. I couldn’t believe this was also in Thailand! Get your camera ready, because it’s one of the most photogenic area’s you will see. Walk around to find a Mickey Mouse shaped hole. Tip: Bring an umbrella to protect you from the sun, otherwise you will burn alive! Luckily there are many foods stands at the arrival point where you can buy fresh coconuts, ice cream, and water.\n\nHeatwave! Bring an umbrella (photo by Piet Fischer)\n\nAlien-like Sam Phan Bok, a true sight.\n\nSirindhorn Wararam Phu Prao Temple\n\nRight across the border of Laos, this beautiful temple changes completely when the sun sets and it gets dark. Come here around 5.30 pm and wait for the magical moment. If you are a professional photographer, you may want to bring your tripod. Say hello to the pigs that walk around at the temple and love to be cuddled.\n\nWhen the sun goes down, the tree and the floor light up\n\nWhere to stay in Ubon Ratchathani\n\nWith no question, stay at the Thohsang Khongjiam Resort. This hotel feels like you’re on holiday. After a day full of exploring, this place is the perfect stopover for a few days. There are villas available if you are with a family, but the other rooms are also good. The hotel is located so close to Laos, that you can almost touch it. There is a wonderful swimming pool and the massages here are amazing. (yes, I need a massage every day).\n\nAs can be seen above, Ubon Ratchathani is very different from most places in Thailand. Ubon is adventurous and it’s unique.\n\nLove,\n\nElke"
