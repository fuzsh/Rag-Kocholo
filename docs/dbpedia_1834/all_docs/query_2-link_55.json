        "text": "> Tour operator's response\n\nDear Bj√∂rn,\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\nGlad to hear our guide did his very best to make the trip successful. We've heard you had some cool sightings including Gaur, Sunbear, and Gibbons.\n\nWe're sorry for the trouble you encountered due to the driver that last-minute ended up only to be available from late afternoon the first day.\n\nStill, we also believe our guide is professional and skilled enough that he would have been able to make the first part of the trip worth it by driving by himself.\n\nIn e.g. Khao Yai where we offer similar tours this is rather common practice (that the guide drives the vehicle) and it doesn't seem to make a major difference on the success of those trips. The advantage of self-driving for the guide is that he/ she can fully follow his/ her instinct on where to slow down, stop etc. Something that remains complicated when this needs to be communicated with a separate driver whilst sitting in the back of the car. No matter how experienced the driver is, the driver can not read the mind of the guide ;) . We usually let the guide decide what he/ she prefers: either self-driving or do the trip together with a separate driver.\n\nBut we also understand there is the advantage that if the guide would sit in the back with the guests, he/ she can answer your questions right on the spot rather than you would have to ask it once the guide makes a stop when an animal is sighted.\n\nBut we admit, our guide in Kaeng Krachan generally prefers to do the trip with a driver, and that is how it normally will be operated.\n\nHopefully it all worked out in the end.\n\nSecondly, the other point you raised about the camping gear is also somewhat complicated.\n\nThe weather was pretty extreme, there's not a lot of tents that stay entirely dry in such a heavy rain storm. To be honest, that kind of weather is pretty exceptional in Kaeng Krachan in the season that the park is open. But we admit it turned out the tent you used is getting towards the end of its life, which didn't help. It had not been put to the test for quite some time, so that sort of caught us by surprise too.\n\nWe are planning to replace this one as soon as possible. Not the best time to invest in new gear, not knowing what the future will be in this weird times, and after months of absolutely no income. But we will replace it soon.\n\nNot sure if the gear deserves to be called 'simple & basic' though.\n\nWell yes, it is camping so that generally is more basic than other forms of accommodation. Unfortunately, there is no other lodging options inside the park. But the tents are spacious, we have invested in thick air mattrassess because even though we had good brand self-inflatable mats in the past, the guests found them too hard.\n\nBut yeah can not really make camping in the jungle much more fancy, I'm afraid, haha.\n\nEither way, thank you for your feedback, we will try to do our best to improve wherever possible, and hope avoid others going home somewhat unhappy like you seemingly did.\n\nBest regards!"
