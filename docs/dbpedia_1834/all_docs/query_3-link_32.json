        "text": "Currently, there are 127 National Parks in Thailand and 21 of them are marine parks.\n\nMost parks charge foreigners an entrance fee of 250 THB but if you have a Work Permit or Thai driving license, the price would be around 40-100 THB as for locals.\n\nI have broken down all the parks into sections for your convenience. Now you see which parks are in the vicinity of where you are staying and plan your trip accordingly. We want to say that there are many amazing parks in Thailand and if you are looking for THE BEST park to visit, it’s probably not the right approach.\n\nSome parks are better for spotting wildlife, some for hiking, caves, waterfalls, swimming and etc.\n\nHere is the map of national parks in Thailand. 4 colors represent four parts of the country along with the best and largest national parks.\n\nNational Parks in Central Thailand\n\n(great for trips from Bangkok)\n\nBangkok is conveniently located in the center of the country and is a major transportation hub, so you have every opportunity to visit a national park even if you don’t drive – you can easily use public transportation. I have noticed that most people choose to stay in Bangkok for a couple of days, just like a layover, and then clearly they don’t have time for a national park.\n\nLast time I spent the whole week in Bangkok and it was fascinating! There are so many activities from getting the best food in Bangkok and probably in all of Thailand, sightseeing, shopping, parting, getting a massage, and many many more! If you stay longer, you can use a 1 or 2 day trip to one of the amazing places I described for you below:\n\nKhao Yai National Park\n\nIt is the oldest National park in Thailand founded in 1961. Khao Yai is the third largest and one of the most popular national parks in Thailand.\n\nIt’s great place for seeing wildlife: elephants, bears, gaurs, gibbons, 300 bird species and reptiles.\n\nWaterfalls: Khao Yai is well known for the Haew Narok waterfall. This waterfall is 150-meter high and is a truly magnificent sight!\n\nAnother waterfall, Haew Suwat, is one of the places where the movie The Beach with Leonardo Dicaprio has been filmed. Watch this movie when in Thailand, especially if you are visiting the islands.\n\nVariety of hiking trails of more than 50 km total lenghts.\n\nThere is also night safari that starts at 19:00 and 20:00.\n\nWe recommend exploring by scooter/car as the area is huge and would take too much time to cover by foot.\n\nNational parks in the South of Thailand\n\n(great for trips from Phuket or Krabi)\n\nWhat does any traveler have in mind when choosing the South of Thailand as their destination? I think it’s mostly relaxing on the beach, parting, getting one of the best massages ever and just overall chilling. Aside from all this fun, I recommend that you visit at least one of these magnificent national parks – just take a look at these breathtaking sceneries!\n\nKhao Sok National Park\n\nKhao Sok is a marine national park located between Phuket, Krabi, Khao Lak and Koh Samui.\n\nGreat for hiking.\n\nYou can go canoeing and rafting.\n\nOr even off the beaten path bamboo rafting!\n\nTake a trip to floating bungalows on Cheow Lan Lake."
