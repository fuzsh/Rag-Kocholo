        "text": "This paper aims to present the sustainable development of the environment in the Pha Taem national park in Thailand. It is in the context of the environmental supply for Eco-tourism and nature-based tourism. The study is in the area of the Pha Team National Park (PTNP) in Thailand, which consists of natural and historical features. PTNP has a distinctive geomorphological appearance. The uniqueness of the national park makes it more valuable as a site for not only establishing a national park but a geo-park as well. The PTNP is located on the edge east of Thailand’s territory. The boundary of the PTNP is along with Thailand and the Lao PDR border across the Mekong River. This study employed a semi-structured interview with the national park staff and superintendent. Fifteen questions ranging from the perspective of sustainable tourism development goals to environmental supply were posed to the respondents. The findings demonstrated that to successfully manage the national park and ac...\n\nLatest global tourism trends demonstrate the need for sustainable tourism products. By creating sustainable products a higher level of competitiveness can be achieved. Therefore, national parks and other protected areas could play a significant part in meeting contemporary tourism demand&#39;s needs. In order to be able to do so, protected areas need to have well defined management goals and objectives adapted to individual area&#39;s resources that need to be protected. Tourism activities must be inherent part of the management plans and processes. Sustainability principles underpin the protected areas protection and tourism management and represent the linkage of the two main goals of protected areas.\n\nThe surface site of Yesilyuva Nature Park encompasses natural, social, economic, and cultural characteristics and has become a marker of the region&#39;s natural and cultural heritage. To support the preservation of this site, promotional activities should be planned. In this study, because of tourism and related opinions of residents and visitors alike in terms of their natural determination, an important cultural and historical feature is aimed at evaluating the tourism potential of Yesilyuva Nature Park. This framework is designed to establish prospective tourism sustainability. As a result, Yesilyuva Nature Park&#39;s natural and cultural properties have been determined to be suitable for sustainable tourism activities using geographic information systems (GIS). This protection in the field, which balances sustainability and landscape design, will provide for the development of tourism activities. In the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis and survey...\n\nA study was conducted in Siri Charoenwat Forest Plantation (SCFP), Chon Buri Province, Thailand, from November 2010 to September 2011 to evaluate the management of SCFP in the context of integrated landscape management and sustainable tourism. A combination of field observation, questionnaire survey, face-to-face interview and literature review was employed. The research participants comprised SCFP staff members including the site supervisor (n=10), representatives from local government units (n=10), knowledgeable members of the local community (n=10), and visitors/tourists (n=70). The responses from the participants were rated using the Lickert Scale method and descriptive statistics. An integrated approach to landscape management of SCFP is complex because it involves the management not only of the physical and natural environment but also economic and social aspects including the interactions of all features and assets. Most respondents were well aware of the reforestation projec...\n\nThe objectives of this research are to study potential of tourist spots, tourists’ behaviors and management of natural reserve parks in order to identify approaches to develop potentials of tourism management of Erawan National Park in Kanchanaburi province, Thailand. The study adopts mixed research methods. The quantitative data were collected from questionnaires distributed to the sample of 400 tourists, aged between 20 - 60 years old. The sample was selected using the non-probability quota sampling method with equal number of 200 tourists who visited the National Park on weekdays, and another 200 touristson weekends. Meanwhile, the qualitative data were collected by conducting in-depth interviews with 16 selected stakeholders of the Erawan National Park and analyzed using descriptive methods. Results of the research reveal that the Erawan National Park has potential regarding tourism, environmental and management, to accommodate the tourists. Challenges of and obstacles to the ma...\n\nThis paper studies the physic/architectural character in National Park of Theth, considering it as a tourist attraction of special importance. Despite the contextual qualities typical of this alpine area, the actual construction character in Theth is changing in relation to local architecture, which requires more attention and research. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether new development design in the tourism destinations making local character count and whether including of local community in this process, can contribute positive to physical attractive environments. The objectives of the study are analyzing the local architectural character of Thethi region, which is one of the most important protected and tourism areas in Albania, and offering to be applied in Theth of a model of international experiences of engaging local people in constructive debate about local character preservation in the new development design in a place. To realize this study, authors used the..."
