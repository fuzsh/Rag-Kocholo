        "text": "Been cooped up for a while? Nature beckons. Starting July 1st, the majority of Thailand’s 150+ national parks are reopening after more than three months of closure due to Covid-19. Read on for the status on ALL national parks and a handful of other natural areas that are spread around Thailand.\n\nThis post will be helpful if you want to know which national parks are open, which are closed, and what to expect at the parks found in coastal provinces that are only partly open. Of course, you’d need to be in Thailand at the moment to take advantage. Yet even if you’re outside of the country, this article might be worth bookmarking since it lists every national park in Thailand, broken down by region.\n\nFor a brief summary of each park, check out this PDF guide produced by the Dept. of National Parks (DNP). It’s a few years old, so the newest handful of parks aren’t included and many of the phone numbers no longer work. But it still comes in handy thanks to the maps and lists of key attractions found in each park.\n\nI don’t go into detail about what is open in the national parks found in non-coastal provinces (this is Thai Island Times and not “Thai Inland Times” after all). However, you will find a list of all the upcountry parks along with the current status of each. Note that all historical parks are now open nationwide as well.\n\nInto the mist of Khao Luang, Nakhon Si Thammarat.\n\nHow to visit and what to expect\n\nStart by downloading the QueQ app to a smartphone. Click the DNP logo on the homepage, and you’ll be sent to a list of national parks after selecting your language (English is now available). From there, it should be a simple process of filling out the dates you wish to visit along with a name, contact number, vehicle type, and number of visitors in your group.\n\nSubmit the form and you should receive a confirmation to show when you enter the park. There is a cap on the number of daily visitors, which varies by park, and you might get locked out if looking to hit a popular park over a holiday weekend. It may be possible to enter a park without reserving via the app beforehand, but reaching most parks requires a drive so I wouldn’t risk the potential disappointment.\n\nIn the app, the upper left icon is the one you want.\n\nWhen arriving, you’ll need to scan the QR code for the Thai Chana tracking platform, or at least write down your contact info. Expect a temperature check.\n\nOnce cleared you’ll have to buy tickets; prices for parks that cost more than 100 baht per foreign adult are shown on this page. For those hitting many of the marine parks, privately run tour companies often cover the ticket as part of a flat fee. Camping and staying in park-provided bungalows is now possible at many parks, but the DNP’s official site with the reservation system is all mucked up at the moment.\n\nNow let’s take a brief look at each park’s situation right now. Note that while this time of year is a great time to photograph waterfalls, a no swimming rule is in effect at them. This rule does not apply to swimming in the sea at the marine parks. Also keep in mind that it’s rainy season in most of Thailand, which means that a lot of marine park islands in the Andaman Sea would be closed regardless of Covid-19.\n\nKo Rang in Mu Ko Chang Marine Park. Time to dive in.\n\nEastern Gulf\n\nKhao Chamao - Khao Wong (Inland, Rayong): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 1,853 visitors.\n\nKhao Kitchakut (Inland, Chanthaburi): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 1,279 visitors.\n\nKhao Laem Ya - Mu Ko Samet (Marine / coastal, Rayong): PARTLY OPEN with a cap of 2,700 visitors on Ko Samet and 1,300 at Khao Laem Ya on the mainland (note: the cap does not apply to Samet’s village and Ao Noi Na). If you want to head to Ko Samet, make sure to reserve a spot via the QueQ app before you book a hotel so that you don’t get shut out with a non-refundable booking. The small islands to the east of Samet, including Ko Thalu and Ko Kudee, are closed until October.\n\nKhao Sip Ha Chan (Inland, Chanthaburi): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 410 visitors.\n\nMu Ko Chang (Marine, Trat): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 300 visitors (note: the cap does not apply to Ko Chang’s coasts, including privately run resorts). You can now visit Khlong Phlu and Than Mayom waterfalls on Ko Chang. Ko Rang and its surrounding dive and snorkeling sites are also open and accessible by dive boat.\n\nNam Tok Khlong Kaeo (Inland, Trat): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 100 visitors.\n\nNam Tok Phlio (Inland, Chanthaburi): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 1,435 visitors.\n\nSai Cave in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park.

Though not actually a national park, this well-managed open zoo is open.\n\nKhao Sam Roi Yot (Marine / coastal / inland, Prachuap Khiri Khan): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 1,500 visitors.

The best place in Thailand to spot wild elephants and gaur is ready to go.\n\nNam Tok Huai Yang (Inland, Prachuap Khiri Khan): PARTLY OPEN with a cap of 70 visitors. Only the namesake waterfall is open.\n\nIn Khao Sok National Park, the lake is always a crowd pleaser.\n\nMid Southern Gulf\n\nHat Khanom - Mu Ko Thale (Marine / coastal, Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat): PARTLY OPEN with a cap of 300 visitors. Ko Matsum is open to the south of Ko Samui, as is Hat Khanom and other low-key beaches on the mainland.

An official told me that all services are open, including the campground on Ko Wua Talap. However, many boat tour companies based on Ko Samui and Ko Phangan are waiting until more tourists return to resume their operations.\n\nMu Ko Chumphon (Marine / coastal, Chumphon): FULLY OPEN with a cap of 300 visitors. The sprinkling of small islands in this underrated park — including Ko Rang Ka Jiew, Ko Samet and Ko Kula — can be reached by longtail boat.\n\nNam Tok Si Khit (Inland, Nakhon Si Thammarat): PARTLY OPEN with a cap of 300 visitors. It’s now possible to visit the waterfall, but other services may be closed.\n\nNam Tok Yong (Inland, Nakhon Si Thammarat): PARTLY OPEN with a cap of 2,659 visitors.

However, this does not mean that all islands in Phang Nga Bay are open (see Than Bok Khorani below).\n\nHat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi (Marine / coastal, Krabi): PARTLY OPEN. The DNP listed this park as fully closed, but the official we spoke with said that Ko Poda, Ko Gai, Ko Maipai and parts of Ko Phi Phi Leh are accessible.
