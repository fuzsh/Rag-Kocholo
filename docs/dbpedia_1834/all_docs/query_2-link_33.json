        "text": "In Thailand, respect is a fundamental aspect of Thai people. Thai people believe in politeness and humility, and they expect the same from you. When interacting with local people or entering a shop, show your humility with a greeting known as \"wai.\" It is a gesture involving a slight bow with palms together, which shows respect.\n\nYou'll hear the Thai language spoken in the streets. Learning a few Thai words and phrases like \"wai\" and \"Khop khun ka\" (thank you) can help you earn respect from the locals. While the Thai language is the official language, English is the unofficial second language. English-speaking travellers, particularly travellers from North America, will find it easy to converse with locals since most Thai people speak English.\n\nAre you a Buddhist practitioner? Well, if you are â€” Thailand is your gateway to spiritual tourism. It is the land of Buddhism. The Theravada form of Buddhism is predominantly practiced here. The Buddhist practice is deeply ingrained in Thai culture. You will find temples called \"wats\" at every corner of the country. Monks hold a special place in the hearts of Thai people, and giving alms to monks is a ritual in Thai culture. So, when you are exploring these temples, pay a visit to the monks and immerse yourself in the ritual of giving alms to the monks.\n\nWhile you are in Thailand, you cannot miss their traditional dress. In fact, wherever you travel, don't forget to try the traditional clothes of that place. It is a part of a cultural experience that you shouldn't miss out on. In Thailand, the traditional clothing includes \"chut thai\" for women and \"pha pha\" for men. Get into these traditional clothing and dress up like a local to get a better feel of the place.\n\nTravelling abroad can be a rewarding experience only when you travel at the right time. This is true for every destination. Although you can visit Thailand all year round, it is still advised to visit the country from November till early April. During these months, the heavens stop pouring, and the sky opens up. This is the time when Thailand experiences its cool and dry season. It is a perfect setting for an outing at the beach or visiting numerous heritage and cultural sites. Prior to this period, the rainy season ensures the landscape is green and vibrant, making it perfect for visiting national parks and natural wonders.\n\nIf you can't make a trip during the November to April period, pay a visit to this place between March and May months. This period is known as the shoulder season. A season which is in the middle of peak season and off-season. During these months, temperatures rise, and the weather becomes extremely hot. If you choose to visit during this period, here's what you can do:\n\nVisit the water festival: April is the month of Songkran, the new year month. During this month, you can celebrate the new year with water fights and other festivals. It is a unique activity to experience.\n\nGreat season for divers: The Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand boasts crystal-clear water, an abundance of marine life, and stunning underwater landscapes. March to May months are perfect for diving activities in these waters.\n\nThe best time to travel ultimately depends on what you want to experience. If you seek pleasant weather and a lively atmosphere, November to April is your best bet. On the other hand, if you don't mind the heat, March to May is the best time to visit Thailand.\n\nWhy go to Thailand for vacation?\n\nKnown around the world as â€˜The Land of Smiles,â€™ Thailand has something to offer just about every kind of traveller. Bangkokâ€™s Grand Palace and most important temples embody the countryâ€™s deep connection to its royal family and spiritual life. Foodies will love finding those flavour combinations unique to Thai cuisine. History buffs can explore magnificent ruined capitals like Ayutthaya, Sukhothai, and the western outposts of the Khmer Empire. Those seeking wellness, relaxation and rejuvenation will find plenty of options throughout the country. Meanwhile, Thailandâ€™s southern islands offer some of the worldâ€™s best beaches, with food, culture, and wildlife experiences all at your fingertips when you need a more active day.\n\nHow long can you vacation in Thailand?\n\nTourists can stay in Thailand for up to 30 days without a visa, and extend this by another 30 days inside the country for a fee. A tourist visa can be obtained for a stay of up to 60 days, and this too can be extended an extra 30 days for a fee.\n\nHow long is a trip to Thailand?\n\nIt depends entirely on the traveller, but 10 to 14 days is usually enough for a solid introduction to Thailand. This gives you time to explore some of Bangkok and its surrounds, visit northern cities like Chiang Mai, and enjoy some beach time in the south.\n\nHow much is a trip to Thailand?\n\nBudget around US$200 per person, per day for a mid-range Thailand vacation. This usually includes guided sightseeing and first-class accommodations. More luxurious options and private tours will set you back around US$300 per day, while less-inclusive Thailand vacation packages can be had for little more than US$100 per day.\n\nWhat currency does Thailand use?\n\nThe Thai Baht trades at around 35 to 1 USD. Hotels, larger stores and many restaurants will accept credit cards, but you will definitely need to carry baht for purchases in markets, at small businesses, and from street vendors.\n\nDo I need to tip in Thailand?\n\nA service charge is often added to bills in Thailand. Beyond this, tipping is not usually expected, though itâ€™s always welcome, particularly in higher-end hotels and restaurants. Taxi drivers are usually tipped around 10 percent.\n\nWhere to vacation in Thailand?\n\nBangkok is â€˜the Big Mango,â€™ where Thailandâ€™s diversity and energy come together in one thrilling city. The capital is a superb sightseeing, shopping, dining, and nightlife destination, but itâ€™s also a good base for exploring nearby regions like the former capital, Ayutthaya, and Kanchanaburi, home of the infamous River Khwae Bridge. To see a gentler side of Thailand, head to the cities and hills of the north. Chiang Mai enchants visitors with its rich history and laid-back pace, while Chiang Raiâ€™s white temple is one of the most intricate and beautiful in Asia. For Thailandâ€™s best beaches and ultimate relaxation, head south to islands like Phuket and Ko Samui.\n\nWhat to pack for a trip to Thailand\n\nWhen Thais say their country has three seasons, hot, hotter, and rainy, they may be smiling, but theyâ€™re not joking. Light, breathable fabrics are key. Be sure to pack items that cover your shoulders and knees at a minimum for visiting palaces and temples. Slip-on shoes will save you a lot of time as well. The hilly regions of the north are the only parts of Thailand that get cool (between November and February), and even then, a light sweater is usually enough.\n\nIs Thailand LGBTQ+ friendly?\n\nThailand has long been a popular LGBTQ+ vacation spot, and the local LGBTQ+ community is proud and visible, particularly in Bangkok. The country actively welcomes LGBTQ+ visitors and â€˜third genderâ€™ identities are a widely accepted part of Thai culture. In March 2024, Thailandâ€™s Senate voted overwhelmingly in favour of legalizing same-sex marriage, and as of mid-2024, bills aimed at increasing legal recognition for Trans and gender-diverse individuals are pending. Public displays of affection however are a no-no, regardless of orientation.\n\nCan I drink the tap water in Thailand?\n\nYou should avoid drinking tap water in Thailand, though itâ€™s usually fine for other purposes like bathing or brushing your teeth. Despite popular myth, thereâ€™s no need to avoid ice in most establishments. It comes from ice-making machines, not tap water.\n\nWhat is the basic etiquette in Thailand?\n\nThai etiquette has more nuances than any visitor will be expected to master, but remembering a few simple points will make all the difference:\n\nThe Thai bow, or wai, is done by putting your hands together in a prayer position and giving a small nod. The more respect being shown, the higher the hands are usually placed. Foreigners arenâ€™t expected to wai first, but you should certainly return the gesture if itâ€™s offered. Add the word Sawasdee, if you like. Youâ€™ll hear this a lot in Thailand, since it means hello, goodbye, thank you, and serves as an apology.\n\nAlways take off your shoes before entering a Thai home or temple, and never step on the threshold. This is said to offend the spirits living there and bring bad luck to residents or worshippers.\n\nDespite Thailandâ€™s heat (and captivating beaches), shoulders and knees should always be covered when entering temples or palaces, and avoid having potentially disrespectful graphics on your clothing.\n\nDo not touch a Thai personâ€™s headâ€”even a childâ€™sâ€”and donâ€™t point your feet at someone or prop them up on tables. Do not touch monks at all, and give your seat up for them if requested.\n\nAbsolutely do not insult or make jokes about Thailandâ€™s monarchy. Even stepping on a coin to stop it rolling away can offend, since it features an image of the King. Western versions of the story of Anna Leonowens and the King, including the musical The King and I are also banned in Thailand.\n\nAlways ask, and offer a small payment before taking photos of the locals. Even if they always seem to be smiling, this is only polite.\n\nDonâ€™t point with your finger. Use your whole hand to indicate something.\n\nDonâ€™t snap your fingers to attract a server. Instead, smile, extend your hand palm down, and gently flex your fingers in an upside-down â€˜come hereâ€™ gesture."
