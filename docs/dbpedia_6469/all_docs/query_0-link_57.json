        "text": "Â p14Â ChapterÂ II\n\nRussian Tsarism's Conflict with the National Idea\n\n1.Â What is Russia?\n\nSince Muscovy after the battle of Poltava inÂ 1709 became geographically a European power​1 as modern Russia, this large state and the overwhelming majority of the dominant Russian nation has been in constant conflict with Europe and with all the ideas that Europe has stood for.\n\nTo uncover the real roots of this conflict we must give an answer to the question: What is Russia? Is Russia, culturally, Europe? Was Muscovy-Russia a partner of the historical cultural community of Europe? This problem of the relation between Russia and Europe is for modern history a crucial issue,​2 investigated not only by nonâRussian scholars like T.Â G.Â Masaryk, M.Â Hrushevsky, O.Â Halecki, J.Â Kucharzewski, F.Â Dvornik, C.Â A.Â Manning, and N.Â Chubaty, but by such Russian writers and scholars as A.Â Presniakov, P.Â Miliukov, D.Â S.Â Mirsky, E.Â Denissoff.\n\nThis problem the genius of A.Â K.Â Tolstoy long ago felt and solved:\n\nThis perception, this deep insight and understanding of the whole problem, the objective scholars can only support. Kievan Rusâ²-Ukraine (Ukraine is a term already used several times in the Nestor-Chronicle and it is older as a term for, at least, a part of the later Rusâ² territory, than the term Rusâ²) is the Ukrainian and Byelo-Ruthenian national original home and heritage, which as the Kievan Rusâ²-Ukraine Empire was a part of Europe. We regard as decisively important for the emerging of the KievanâRusâ²-Ukraine even the earlier Gothic Empire (166â375) in the Ukraine and the Gothic influences on the ancestors of the Ukrainians, Â p15Â the Antes.​4 The northeastern border colonies of the Kievan Rusâ²-Ukraine Empire, being colonial borderlands on the Slavic ethnographic frontiers, with their princely residences in Suzdal, Rostov, Vladimir, and Moscow, soon including and Slavizing the native pagan Finnish tribes, developed there a different nationality with a different kind of Christianity, a different, autocratic character of government, and a different culture. The clash between European Rusâ²-Ukraine and this cradle and home of what is now called the Russian nation (until Peter's decree, usually called \"Moscovites and Muscovy\") is reported as early asÂ 1169, when Suzdal completely devastated Kiev and robbed the Kievan churches. That is a good refutation of the myth that Muscovy regarded Kiev as the \"mother city.\"\n\nAfter the Mongol invasion inÂ 1240 the Ukrainian, Byelo-Ruthenians, and Novgorodians and the emerging Moscovite nation separated completely. The Ukrainians in the West attempted to coâoperate with Lithuania and Catholic Poland against the Tatars, the Byelo-Ruthenians soon joined Lithuania, the Novgorodians, the nucleus of the fourth eastern Slavic nation, gradually were integrated with the Baltic-Scandinavian sphere. But in the northeast the princes of Moscow capitulated completely and became servants of the Tatarian Khans. With the active support of their Tatarian sovereigns, they united that former colonial borderland of the old Kievan Empire, into a Tatarian vassal-dominion under their rule. The Ukrainians, Byelo-Ruthenians, Lithuanians, and Poles formed their Commonwealth fromÂ 1386 (which the Novgorodians later attempted to join also) participating more or less in all the Western European cultural trends and movements.\n\nBut Muscovy became a Tatarian cultural sphere under Tatarian influences that dominated the court, princes, family life, the whole mentality. The process of political liberation from the Tatarian yoke virtually lasted until the destruction of the Golden Horde inÂ 1502 despite the fact that fromÂ 1480 tribute was no longer paid. All leading Russian historians from N.Â Karamzin (1766â1826), to V.Â Kliuchevsky (1841â1911) stressed the decisive Tatar influence, on the formation of Moscovite State, and the Soviet historian M.Â Pokrovksy (1868â1932) directly states that the Grand Duchy of Muscovy owed its birth entirely to Tatars. We can guess the force of these Tatarian influences by evaluating the fact that, according to Kliuchevsky, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries 17Â perÂ cent of the surnames of Muscovite nobility were Tatarian. The women were treated, in the Tatarian way, as second class, and untilÂ 1551Â men wore headgear in the churches, a Tatar-Moslem custom. The greatest influence was on the absolutist conception of the ruler; the Khan was regarded as the shadow of the Lord on earth.\n\nThis Tatarian-Muscovite world acquired a Byzantine faÃ§ade after the marriage (1472) of Sophia, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, to Â p16Â IvanÂ III, who now began calling himself \"Tsar of all the Russias.\" He regarded himself as the successor of the Byzantine emperor, he accepted the Byzantine double-eagle as the State emblem, and with the help of the clergy Moscow created the myth of the third Rome of Christianity (after the downfall of the second Rome, Constantinople, inÂ 1452). InÂ 1589 the Tsar obtained his own patriarch and nationalized the Church, establishing in Muscovy a Byzantine Caesaropapism. Igumen Philoteus advised the Tsar that he was the only true Christian ruler on earth, thus the natural Tsar of all Christians. The Mongol-Tatarian conception of the mastery of the world created by the Jenghizides acquired here the \"Christian\" formulation.\n\nTatarian tyranny was established behind the Byzantine Christian mask â and tyranny cannot stand still. It is a force like fire, it must destroy. Tyranny must annihilate all seeds of individual or national freedom or collapse. Ivan's successor, VasilyÂ III, was a brutal tyrant and Ivan the Terrible murdered nearly three fourths of the dynastic and aristocratic families. Ivan himself subjugated the Republic Novgorod with unheardâof cruelty by smoke and flames and rivers of blood, fighting here the European traditions. Finally, after organizing a forced resettlement of thousands of free Novgorodians in Muscovy he \"unified\" them.​5\n\nThat was the beginning of the expansion of Muscovite tyranny in all directions because of its excellent geopolitically central position. The increase of tyranny is parallel to its territorial growth, as J.Â Kucharzewski rightly stresses; the despotism of the Tsars is closely linked with the expansion of the State, for their unlimited power became inseparably connected with the might of the State. As their despotism became the State's source of power and aggrandizement the acceptance of slavery by the citizens became patriotism.\n\nAfter the establishment of Tsarist tyranny in Muscovy many nationalities had to share the fate of the Novgorodians. The Tatarian Khanats of Kazan and Astrakhan were conquered betweenÂ 1552 andÂ 1656, penetration into Siberia and the subjection of the Siberian peoples started inÂ 1581 and inÂ 1645 reached the Pacific. PeterÂ I put on the throne of Poland his puppet, AugustÂ II, and by a coalition with Poland and Denmark against Sweden started the expansion toward the Baltic Sea. Sweden and Ukraine, CharlesÂ XII and Hetman Mazepa attempted to stop Muscovite imperialism by a barrier in which Poland-Lithuania had also to be included, and which would have been backed by France and Turkey. But their defeat inÂ 1709 in the battle of Poltava opened the West to Muscovy and finally enabled her to incorporate the Ukraine; inÂ 1721 Livonia, Ingria, and parts of Finnish Karelia were annexed; inÂ 1741 the Bering Sea and Straits were reached; inÂ 1740 Transcaspia was incorporated; inÂ 1739 the Black Sea coast from the mouth of the DonÂ to the Bug River was reached; inÂ 1783 Crimea was absorbed, and inÂ 1792 the Black Sea shore to the Dniester; inÂ 1772â1792 in the partitioning of Poland, Russia acquired Byelo-Ruthenia, Western Ukraine, and Kurland; inÂ 1813 Baku Â p17Â was annexed from Persia; afterÂ 1815 Poland, Finland, and Bessarabia were annexed and Russia reached the preâWorldÂ WarÂ I frontiers in the West, founded Vladivostok, and inÂ 1865â1881 conquered Central Asia (Bokhara, Khiva, Turkestan, Turkomania); and inÂ 1898 she founded Port Arthur. On the American continent Russia insisted on the formal acknowledgment as a Russian territory of the land from Alaska to the Columbia River and trading posts as far as SanÂ Francisco, and afterÂ 1814 Russia proclaimed the entire northern Pacific Ocean a Russian mare clausum. The sale of Alaska inÂ 1867 ended Russia's expansion in America, after she had partly provoked the proclamation of the Monroe Doctrine inÂ 1823.\n\nHaving freed herself from her own Asiatic conquerors Muscovy-Russia developed on lines justly compared by C.Â Vernadsky with similar trends of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, and, finding in Asia a power vacuum, Russia soon invaded even the American continent.\n\nIn the course of this expansion to the West, South, and East, many foreign countries and nationalities were incorporated into the Russian Empire but Russia's land hunger was still unsatisfied; she extended her feelers into Afghanistan, Tibet, Persia, Siam, even Abyssinia, and openly stated her claims to the inheritance from the Turks of Constantinople and of the Slavic peoples, rounding it off by aspirations for Greece as well. The subsequent history of Europe and the world passes under the constant \"shadow\" of Tsarist Russia.\n\nOn the one hand the Russian Empire gradually became everywhere in Europe and Asia a rival of the British Empire; on the other hand, by incorporating these nationalities which for centuries had belonged to the European community, and by her advance into Central Europe, Russia found herself faced with the basic problems of European history: the individual and national freedom. The ideas of the British, American, and French revolutions confronted Russia, who, in the great historical progress toward humanity herself developed into the antithesis of all the ideas the Western world cherished. We see the backwardness of Russia best in the fact that serfdom was abolished in Russia only inÂ 1861, but in England it had disappeared before the sixteenth century. In Western Europe the serfs became mostly hired laborers and free tenants by the sixteenth century. Thus, compared with the West, there is in the East a great tardiness in the historical processes of human progress. In all spheres Russia proper was overdue to follow the West.\n\n2.Â Russian Solution of the Nationality Problem\n\nIn the historical literature of United States there exists a profound misconception of the peculiarity of the old Russian Empire. The historians are misled by the conceptions of the old Holy Roman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian or British Empires and imagine a similarity also in the Old Russian Empire. This is a fundamental mistake. The Russian State, beginning with Muscovite times had always a specific character, and developed into a specific Russian Empire. The ruling Russian nation never regarded any part of the conquered or annexed nonâRussian Â p18Â nations in Europe and Asia as their colonies, but as \"indivisible parts of Russia herself.\" The ruling Russian nation did not wish to acquire economic colonies, she wished to \"swallow and digest\" the nonâRussian nationalities, transforming them into Russians and thereby increasing her own growth. Consequently, the Russian Empire never possessed dominions or colonies but immediately included nonâRussian nationalities and their countries in \"Russia.\" AÂ remarkable scholar of Russian history, W.Â Baczkowski,​6 compares the Russian Empire with China's territorial expansion and increase in population, absorbing, without even leaving a trace, many conquered peoples. But there exists, in my opinion, a basic difference between China and Russia. The Chinese digestion of nonâChinese nationalities was executed so to say by the \"Chinese flood,\" the immense numerical superiority of the Chinese and the superiority of the Chinese culture and civilization. Besides, there were active in this process long centuries of common history and common cultural processes in a \"natural organic way.\" Russia, on the contrary, had no superior culture or number in comparison with the nonâRussian nationalities (they were, even until WorldÂ WarÂ I, a minority of 43Â perÂ cent in the Russian Empire), but Moscovite Russia from the beginning of the rise of Muscovy developed the \"artificial methods for Russification by all means and all the force of the State.\" The methods of using the terror of organized gangsterhood to strengthen the Russian State executed by the oprichnina was first used against the Russian feudal nobility; it later became the usual method of dealing with conquered nations, which in the northwest, in the west, south, and in the Caucasus were far superior in culture and civilization to Moscovite Russia.\n\nThe terror in the service of Russification, the whip, had a counterpart: the cookie. All renegades, opportunists, sadists of the conquered nonâRussian nations, all the lowest scum of opportunists were eagerly invited by the Russian bureaucracy to join the ranks of the \"Herrenvolk\" and to participate, after full Russification, in the manifold careers as Russificators all over the Empire, with all the honors of titles and the material benefits. This half-intelligent mob of the \"new Russians,\" who denied their nationality and churches, became \"more Russian\" than the Russians themselves, and were then used systematically by the ruling, pure Russian bureaucracy for the \"swallowing, digestion, and full Russification\" of nonâRussian nationalities. As the careers of this bureaucratic rabble were closely connected with special achievements in Russification there developed very soon from the ranks of German, Ukrainian, Polish, Armenian, Georgian, even Jewish renegades many high-placed fanatical Russifiers. For their use the ruling, pure Russian bureaucracy developed a special method. They were seldom used in service among the people they had denied, because there they would feel the general scorn of their own nationality and its moral contempt. Consequently, Ukrainians were used in the Polish territory, Balts in Turkestan, Poles in the Caucasus, Caucasians in Byelo-Russia,Â etc. â with the Â p19Â special mission to destroy all local traditions of a separate State existence, to erase all national peculiarities and characteristics of the separate political, cultural, religious life. First of all, the languages of the nonâRussian nationalities had to be suppressed in schools, churches, press, and public life. Everything had to be reduced to the one common Russian and Orthodox denominator. Only in the Russian language could one approach this Russian State in the administration, courts, and public life. Thus, the all power­ful Russian bureaucracy became the well-paid chief agent of the State's Russification and assimilation policy, backed by the ever present secret political police, with the right to exile every person suspected of opposition, without judicial procedure but in the administrative way, to Siberia for a couple of years.\n\nThe Tsars carefully supervised this rather old policy with special instructions. AÂ good illustration is the instruction issued to Prince Viasemsky, then General Procurator, by the Empress Catherine inÂ 1764:\n\n\"Ukraine, Livonia and Finland are provinces ruled on the basis of privileges, granted to them, and their ruthless infringement would be indecent; calling them foreign and treating them as such, would not only be more than a mistake, it would be foolish. Those provinces as well as the province of Smolensk should be Russified very tactfully and should cease to be regarded as wolves in the forest [strange foreigners]. That could easily be done if clever men were selected for those provinces; not only should there be no Hetman in Ukraine, but care should be taken that even the name of Hetman disappears and no person should be appointed to the post.\"\n\nThe reigns of NicholasÂ I, AlexanderÂ II, and the last NicholasÂ II are dark pages in the history of all the nonâRussian nationalities in the Empire.\n\nThe Russian intellectual upper class and society â confronted with Europe, with the European basic problems of freedom, with European progress in all spheres of life â were filled with a deep sense of their own deficiencies which gave them an inferiority complex. And we can witness how this inferiority complex gradually developed the \"compensation\" and how, as in a hunchback, there emerged a \"superiority complex,\" exalted soon into a Russian master-race complex and Russian messianism against the background of the almost endless Empire and the unlimited tyranny of the Tsars. The old ideology of the third Rome combined with the messianistic PanâSlavism and with the influences of German philosophers such as Schelling, Fichte, Hegel, and became the ideological weapon against Europe and against all the subdued nonâRussian nationalities of the Empire, soon proclaiming the program: one God, one Tsar, one nation, and one language. Westernized Poland especially, with her revolutionary outbursts (1794, 1830, 1846, 1863), Lithuania, Byelo-Ruthenia, Ukraine, and Finland became for Muscovy inside Russia \"the European problem\"; then a whole series of Russian writers and thinkers, especially Aksakov, Pogodin, Danilewsky, Dostoyewsky, formulated Russia's answer to Europe. AÂ leader of this ideological pogrom of everything Europe highly esteemed is Dostoyewsky with his hatred and fear of Europe; with his fanatical hatred of France, Catholicism, Â p20Â Socialism; with his conception of a \"Russian God\" and aggressive imperialism with his admiration for the \"iron chancellor\" Bismarck and his \"blood and iron\" methods. True, there was also a group of Westerners among the Russians, even some liberals: the members of the Decabrists (1825), and later Herzen and V.Â Soloviev (1853â1900), who taught the right to be a free man in a free society and nationality, but they had no influence on Russian policy. Nor did the Socialist theorists in exile in Western Europe have any influence. The techniques, based on PanâSlavism, for all nonâRussian nationalities were the methods of the hangman Muraviev, secret police, prisons, Siberia, full absolutism, censor­ship, and Russification. Tsarist Russia not only crushed in domestic politics all freedom of individuals and nationalities, but was always ready with her army to crush, as inÂ 1848 in Hungary, every national revolution against absolutism.\n\n3.Â Russian Methods Applied to the Solution of Nationality Problems\n\nWe have given a general background of the \"Russian\" solution of nationality problems and we should like to demonstrate their methods. They had a rather long tradition and are linked with Muscovy. From the times of Ivan the Terrible until the end of the Russian Empire (1917), Muscovy used and in course of time perfected her own methods for solving the nationality problem, which in modern times became indissolubly connected with the basic problems of European history: with her fight against individual and national freedom, with her fight against democracy, Russia opposed these European ideas by her problem of Russian chauvinism, which usually was formulated by the slogan: \"Russian absolutism, Russian Orthodoxy, Russian nationality.\" Thus, the Russian solution of the national problem, we repeat, meant a complete Russification, and Orthodoxization of all nonâRussian nationalities, so to say \"unification\" and eradication of all their democratic ideas by \"educating\" them into enthusiastic acceptance of Russian absolutism. This was the program put forward by the almighty Russian State, backed by the Russian Orthodox Church and the overwhelming part of the Russian nation.\n\nThis Russian solution of the national problem was for more than two centuries practically executed in the Russian Empire by the following methods:\n\na)Â Genocide. This modern word â for a rather old Muscovite specialty â means \"race murder\" or \"nation murder.\"​7 It is the modern juridical term for any act which is committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical , racial, or religious group; it is now used especially for killing members of the group, causing them Â p21Â serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.\n\nb)Â Exile, forced labor and imprisonment of the leaders of the democratic national movements.\n\nc)Â Systematic persecution and annihilation of nonâRussian Churches, propagating ceaselessly the \"unification\" with Orthodoxy.\n\nd)Â Systematic persecution and extermination of nonâRussian languages by excluding them from schools, press, administration, public life, theaters,Â etc., and enforced Russification of nonâRussian youth by schools, press, obligatory military service, corruption,Â etc. Especially the substitution of Latin letters by the Cyrillic letters, used in Russian, was regarded as the first stage of \"unification\" with Russian.\n\ne)Â Colonization of nonâRussian ethnographic territories by Russians and giving them a privileged standing for the Russification of the countries.\n\nf)Â Iron Curtain; this curtain against Western Europe was established by the \"censor­ship\" over the whole correspondence with outside Russia, incoming and outgoing, by a special censor­ship on foreign books, by a special passport agency, often prohibiting for private persons any travel abroad.\n\ng)Â Supervision and control of the whole life of all Russian citizens inside and outside Russia by a secret police with unlimited funds for stool pigeons and provocation.\n\nh)Â In the last period (1871â1913) the Jews were made responsible for all the advances of democratic and national trends in Russia, and Jewish pogroms, organized by the police and their \"black hundreds,\" became a favorite method of Russian absolutism in fighting also the Jewish national idea, advanced by the Jewish Bund and later Zionism. What it meant anyone can see from the fact that in one year â 1905 â 700Â pogroms took place in Russia. Russia is also the cradle of the famous falsification, \"Proto­cols of the Elders of Zion\" (later the chief propaganda weapon of Hitler; its contents were translated into 14Â languages and distributed in millions of copies).​8\n\nThere was not one nonâRussian nationality in Russia which was not the object of this \"Russian solution of the nationality problem.\" The nationalities of the Baltic: the Finns, and Finno-Karelians, the Ingrians, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles, Byelo-Ruthenians, Ukrainians, Tatars, the nationalities of the Caucasus and of Turkestan,​9 with their Â p22Â national traditions, cultures, languages, and churches, became the subjects of a systematic pogrom by the Russian State for many decades.\n\nWe do not have here sufficient space for presenting the tragic history of the \"Russian solution of the nationality problem\" applied practically to these non-Russian nationalities. We limit ourselves here to the Poles, Lithuanians, Byelo-Ruthenians, and Ukrainians as examples of the Russian Tsaristic epoch.\n\nThe Poles were, because of their revolutions, torchbearers for Europe in the dark age of the Russian Empire. Russian absolutism had fostered all the elements of disintegration of the Commonwealth, finally partitioning the State, erasing the very name of Poland from the map of Europe and imposing on the country the name of the \"Vistula-land.\" Her whole public life was Russianized â the schools, the Warsaw University, the administration and courts; large Russian garrisons in Polish towns changed their pure Polish appearance. Even the Western European architectonic features of the main streets and places were changed, as in Warsaw, by alteration of the Empire faÃ§ades by Russian ornaments or by special monumental churches built in the Russian-Byzantine style. Inscriptions on the streets enforced the law in Russian. All Polish publications were put under Russian censor­ship. Special systematic persecutions were endured by the Catholic Church, whose priests had to be educated in St.Â Petersburg and were forced into the churches to pray for the Tsar, the perpetrator of all these barbarities. The leaders of the revolutions were usually murdered, all their private property and that of the emigrants confiscated, and thousands of persons who participated in the national uprising were exiled to Siberia, kept in prisons, or employed in mines as forced laborers. Russia had even conceived a plan, not realized, to introduce Russian letters into the Polish alphabet in order to break even this link with Western Europe. No Pole could be a civil servant in Poland but only outside the Polish ethnographic territory. And finally the Tsar built a citadel loaded with artillery opposite the former Polish capital Warsaw, promising to the Poles, in the case of a next uprising, to erase the capital with all their national treasures.Â .Â .Â .\n\nÂ p23Â The persecution of Lithuanians is summed up by the Lithuanian historian C.Â R.Â Jurgela:​10\n\nThe famous hangman Muravyov executed this policy after the last Lithuanian revolution (1863) with a Russian army ofÂ 90,000, having executedÂ 128, banished to hard labor in Siberia 972, exiled to Siberia 1427, seized as recruits for the armyÂ 345, convicted to prison termsÂ 864, banished to the interiorÂ 1529, \"relocated\" and endowed with land in RussiaÂ 4096 â totaling 9361Â persons while 1794Â estates were confiscated.\n\nWho was Muravyov? Tsar AlexanderÂ II looking for a man to suppress the \"mutiny\" boasted: \"IÂ shall defend myself, and my means shall be a man combining the qualities of a Roman proconsul and a Tatar Khan. IÂ shall slap the law of nations! and he shall slap the laws of Divinity and humaneness!\" He found the man in this unscrupulous general with a well-known record of embezzlements. In his memoirs the hangman wrote:​11\n\n\"IÂ answered the Tsar that, being Russian, IÂ would act indecently shouldÂ I decline. .Â .Â . IÂ demanded that all the means be placed at my disposal .Â .Â . that is, strict prosecution of the plots and mutinies, lifting of the national dignity and Russian morale. .Â .Â . IÂ knew in advance that my methods would not be pleasant .Â .Â . yet concessions and weakness would merely worsen the situation. .Â .Â . They were afraid [at St.Â Petersburg] not merely of losing Lithuania â they feared for Petersburg and themselves, they were afraid of a universal spread of the democratic principles. .Â .Â . The Emperor replied by thanking me for my self-sacrifice and readiness to assume this hard assignment, by saying that he fully shared my way of thinking about the proposed methods, and that he would not retreat from that system.\"\n\nComing to Wilna, Muravyov started to hang and shoot indiscriminately on the slightest suspicion in the market place. The revolutionaries were executed publicly with fanfare heralding the executions. The scaffolds built in Wilna were busy for many months. .Â .Â . Parents were frequently compelled to witness the executions of their sons and then they too were banished on foot to Siberia. Muravyov extorted money from the gentry, he accepted 100,000 rubles from Count Tyzenhauz and gave one half to Katkov, the apostle of PanâSlavism.\n\nThe \"liberal\" Tsar AlexanderÂ II conferred upon Muravyov the title of Count and throughout Russia his name commanded the greatest respect. On his birthday holy icons were presented to him with thanksgiving addresses, signed even by Metropolitan Filaret of Moscow, and \"liberals\" like Kavelin. Russian poets, among them Tyutchev and Nekrasov, wrote odes to Muravyov as the \"national hero\" of Russia. Therefore, Muravyov boasted in his memoirs:\n\nWith such methods Russia attained her aim: the very name \"Lithuania\" was officially abolished and the country renamed \"The Northwestern Territory\" of Russia.\n\nSimilar to this was the fate of Byelo-Ruthenia, which for many centuries was united with Lithuania. Their national State was reproclaimed by Napoleon during the march to Moscow. After Napoleon's downfall the Russian repressions followed, against which the Byelo-Ruthenians simultaneously with the Poles rose in the revolutions ofÂ 1831 andÂ 1863. V.Â Kalinovsky the leader of the Byelo-Ruthenians, caught and hanged by Muravyov, managed before his death to smuggle his last appeal to the Byelo-Ruthenians, which is an illuminating document regarding the ideology of all national movements in Russia:​12\n\n\"My brothers, beloved humble peasants! IÂ am writing to you from underneath the Muscovite gallows, probably for the last time. It hurts to leave the native soil and you, my dear fellow countrymen. My breast is rending apart, my heart is breaking, but IÂ do not regret my dying for the cause of justice to you.\n\n\"Brothers, accept my words with trust, as they will reach you from the other world, and IÂ have written them having but your well-being in mind.\n\n\"Brothers, there is no greater happiness in the world, than to have wisdom and enlightenment in one's head. But â just as the night and day do not walk together, so the true enlightenment does not mate with the Muscovite slavery. As long as that slavery shall dominate our country, we shall have no truth, no well-being, no enlightenment, and we shall be ruled like dumb animals, not for our own welfare, but to our perdition.\n\n\"Therefore, whenever you should hear that your brothers from the environs of Warsaw are fighting for Truth and Freedom, do not remain inactive: seize whatever weapon might be handy â the scythe or the axe â and rise enÂ masse, keep on fighting for your rights as men and nation, for your religion, for your native soil.\n\n\"For IÂ say unto you, People, from the gallows: you shall be able to live in happiness only when the Muscovite tyranny shall have been removed from your necks! (Boja tabie zpod szubienicy kazhu, Narodzie, szto tahdy zazhywiesz szczaliwo, kali nad taboiu Moskala uzho ne budzie!)\"\n\nAll of Byelo-Ruthenia was kept fromÂ 1863 untilÂ 1870 under military war dictator­ship. Hundreds of estates were confiscated and presented to Russians as rewards. Already inÂ 1820 the University in Polock was Â p26Â closed, and inÂ 1832 the University in Wilna, in which many Byelo-Ruthenians studied; inÂ 1842 the Theological Academy was transferred to St.Â Petersburg and Russified, 190Â monasteries and their schools were closed; inÂ 1840 the special Lithuanian Law Codex of the courts was abolished. At the same time the Byelo-Ruthenian language was forbidden in the orthodox churches and Russian introduced; the Byelo-Ruthenian Catholic Church was, inÂ 1839, forcibly liquidated and Catholics by governmental order were included in the Russianized Orthodox Church. Byelo-Ruthenia was divided into Russian gubernias and her very name disappeared.\n\nMuscovy struck perhaps its heaviest blows on the Ukraine. From the oldest times this nation as the Kievan Rusâ²-Ukraine Empire was with her Viking dynasty an integral part of the European civitas christiana. After the Mongol invasion and the occupation of Kiev inÂ 1240 the Ukrainians became with the Byelo-Ruthenians a part of the Lithuanian federation, which used the old Byelo-Ruthenian-Ukrainian-Church language as the official language in their countries. Later, as a part of the Jagellonian Commonwealth, Ukraine was always under the influence of Western European culture and civilizations. InÂ 1654 the revolution under Hetman Bohdan Khmelnitsky reâestablished the Ukrainian sovereignty. As the historian of law S.Â Shelukhyn points out, the principles of \"equality, brotherhood, liberty\" lived in the everyday practice of the Ukrainian Cossack Host two hundred years before the French Revolution and these slogans animated the Cossacks and peasants in their fight against the Polish gentry and aristocracy. In the Treaty of Perejaslav​13 concluded by the Hetman with the Muscovite dynasty (1654) S.Â Shelukhyn sees only a \"personal Union\" of the Ukrainian Republic under a common dynasty, and he established the fact that in the treaty are included some points of the English Magna Charta. InÂ 1656 Khmelnytsky annulled the treaty by a close alliance with Sweden and Transylvania â in the next year he died. But the Tsar soon had his garrisons in the Ukraine and interfered with the internal Ukrainian affairs, breaking the treaty. Thus the foreign policy of all the immediate successors of Khmelnytsky had one aim: to get rid of the Muscovitean protectorate. Hetman Vyhovsky reâestablished the Federation of the Ukraine with Poland and Lithuania in a united Commonwealth, by the Union of HadiachÂ (1658). Hetman Doroshenko inÂ 1671 even preferred the protectorate of Turkey to that of Muscovy; and Hetman Mazepa​14 finally made the attempt to liberate Â p27Â the Ukraine by the alliance with CharlesÂ XII of Sweden. Mazepa formed and shaped the political and cultural origin of the Ukrainian nation. In his struggle with Russia, Mazepa displayed wisdom and foresight. As early as the beginning of the eighteenth century, Mazepa sensed the ever present and ever growing danger presented by Russia. He noted the gradual penetration of Russian influence into Ukraine, the Russian interference with Ukrainian internal affairs and the Russian infiltration into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He quickly saw that only an alliance of all the countries endangered by Russia, from the north to the south, could stop her aggressive advance.\n\nHis guiding idea in foreign policy was that Ukraine should form a common anti-Muscovite front together with Sweden (Finland, Estonia, and Latvia), Poland-Lithuania, and Turkey. In order to be success­ful, however, the alliance also needed the support of France from the west.\n\nOnly such a political alliance, he maintained, could success­fully block the aggressive advance of Russia under Peter the Great into Northern, Western, and Southern Europe. Unfortunately, the first part of his coalition materialized belatedly (the Swedish-Ukrainian alliance), and its first attempt to stop Russia was crushed at Poltava, Ukraine, inÂ 1709, where both the Swedish armies of King CharlesÂ XII and the Ukrainian armies under Hetman Mazepa were defeated by the Russians. King CharlesÂ XII and Hetman Mazepa went into exile to Turkey, where Mazepa died shortly afterward.\n\nAfter the death of Mazepa, his great plans for an anti-Russian alliance of Western nations were continued by his successor, Hetman Pylyp Orlyk, whose diaries were found in the archives of Quai d'Orsay (the French Foreign Office)​15\n\nThe son of Hetman Pylyp Orlyk, Hryhor, who was a lieutenant general in the French Army of LouisÂ XV, continued the work of Mazepa and inspired Voltaire to write his L'Histoire deÂ l'Ukraine. It was Voltaire who was the author of the famous phrase: \"The Ukraine always aspired to liberty.\" In his memo to the French Cardinal Minister Fleury, Hryhor prophetically stated: \"France and all Europe think lightly of Muscovite expansion, and yet that is the chief factor which may destroy the entire European system.\"\n\nHryhor Orlyk fell in battle against the Prussians inÂ 1759 as a French general. AÂ group of Ukrainian diplomats, such as Voynarovsky, Mirovich, Â p28Â Nakhimovsky, and others, did not let the ideas of Mazepa die, but continued their patriotic work for the liberation of Ukraine.\n\nIt was Mazepa's uncompromising attitude toward Russia as a main entrance to the peace and freedom of smaller nations that evoked the profound hatred for him on the part of all Russians. Mazepa is the godfather of the anti-Muscovite and proâEuropean origin in both the cultural and political sense. Mazepa's ideology, based on the ideas of freedom and independence, has inspired millions of Ukrainians to struggle for these Godâgiven rights. This ideal of the Western European community of nations, given to the Ukrainians by Mazepa 250Â years ago, spread to the other Eastern European nations.\n\nHow the Russian feared Mazepa is best exemplified by Peter the Great's order after the battle of Poltava. He ordered the razing of Baturyn, Mazepa's capital, to the ground, and had some 18,000Â inhabitants killed, mostly women and children. He ordered the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to anathematize Mazepa as a \"traitor.\" From that time on untilÂ 1917, every Good Friday the Russian Orthodox Church, in a special ceremony, faithfully and servilely excommunicated Mazepa.\n\nTo make the aspirations of the Ukrainian people for freedom as horrible and \"criminal\" in old Russia as possible, the Russians began applying the term \"Mazepists,\" that is, the partisans of Mazepa, to all the Ukrainian patriots ever since. Muscovy systematically applied genocide to the bearers of the national consciousness of the Ukraine, the Ukrainian Cossacks and their leaders. The Hetmans Somoylovych, Doroshenko, and Mnohohrishny were exiled to Siberia; Hetman Polubotok died in the Petropavlovsk fortress near Petersburg; the Cossack army was used as forced labor at the construction of Petersburg, along the Volga, and more thanÂ 20,000 perished in toiling on the Ladoga Canal. CatherineÂ II, for whom the Ukrainian folksongs reserved the title \"daughter of a bitch,\" annihilated (inÂ 1775) the traditional center of the Cossack Host, the Zaporogian Sich, exiling and imprisoning their commander Kalnyshevsky in the Solowki Islands; she enforced from the last Hetman Razumovsky his abdication inÂ 1764 (diedÂ 1802), divided the Ukraine into Russian gubernias provinces and imposed serfdom on the Ukrainian peasantry. Finally, in order to erase any tradition (as the last Hetman attempted to introduce a hereditary hetmanate) the Rozumovsky family was exiled under the pretext of a Russian ambassador­ship to Vienna (where the ambassador became the protector of Van Â Beethoven) â intermarried with the Austrian nobility and became Austrianized.\n\nSystematically, Muscovy annihilated the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its direct subordination to the Patriarch of Constantinople. Moscow forced the election of her candidate Prince G.Â Svyatopolk Chertwertynsky to the Metropolitan­ship of Kiev, and inÂ 1685 he subordinated the Ukrainian Church to the Muscovite Patriarch. CatherineÂ II confiscated the estates of the Ukrainian Church inÂ 1786, distributing hundreds of thousands of acres to her lovers. The opposing Bishop Arsen Matsiyewich was tried in St.Â Petersburg and by Catherine's order immured in a tower in Reval.\n\nÂ p29Â But the Ukrainian language had to suffer the most systematic persecution. Hatred and intolerance for everything that was not Muscovite was peculiar to Moscow and anything different was regarded as heresy and treason against Orthodoxy. Therefore, Moscow, the \"Third Rome,\" immediately started to persecute the Ukrainian Church language and to \"unify\" it with the Moscovite. Already before the personal Union of Ukraine with the Moscovitean dynasty, all books which differed in language with the Muscovite had been burned in Moscow. The Russian priests preached that there must be \"one language\" everywhere. InÂ 1690 Patriarch Yoakim anathematized all books printed in the former Polish-Lithuanian-Ukrainian Commonwealth and nearly the whole Ukrainian Church literature of that time was forbidden. Even the first volume of the works of St.Â Dmytro Rostovsky was burned as differing in its Ukrainian language from Russian, and all new editions were \"unified with Russian.\" We find an open hatred of the Ukrainian language in the preface to the works of Yoan Zlatoust printed 1709 in Moscow, where it is stated that the \"very obscure Ukrainian\" was, in its orthography and language, \"translated and corrected into Russian.\" Gradually Moscow began to persecute the books and printing presses in the Ukraine. Moscow attempted to enforce the Russian-Moscovitean pronunciation of letters in the Ukrainian language, which had, like the Bulgarian, Serbian, and Byelo-Ruthenian an alphabet similar to the Muscovite. InÂ 1720, PeterÂ I forbade the printing of books in the Ukraine with the exception of Church books; but the Church books had to be completely \"unified\" with the Moscovite Church books, \"in order that there may be not the slightest difference and no separate language in them.\" InÂ 1721, an order was issued that all manuscripts of books to be printed in Ukrainian printing presses had to be sent to Moscow \"for correction and unification with the Russian\" in the Synodalian Censor­ship Office. By constant heavy fines this order was strictly executed: inÂ 1724, the Archimandrite of the Kievan Pecherska Lawra monastery was fined 1000Â rubles for printing a \"Triodon\" different from the Muscovetean one; inÂ 1726, the Brotherhood of Chernyhiv was fined 2000Â rubles for printing Ukrainian books, and the printing press was confiscated and brought to Moscow. Finally at the time of the Metropolitan Raphael Zaborovsky (1731â1747) Moscow ordered that all old Ukrainian Church books be confiscated and destroyed, and Muscovite introduced. InÂ 1769, the Kievan Pecherska Lawra printing press was forbidden to publish anything in the Ukrainian tongue. At the end of the eighteenth century, Moscow enforced the introduction of the Russian teaching language in the Kievan Academy and all the existing schools in Ukraine; also the priests were ordered to pronounce the Old Church language not with the traditional Ukrainian but with the Russian-Muscovite pronunciation.\n\nThe Ukraine under Russia gradually became a land of illiteracy. .Â .Â . In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there existed over 20Â printing presses in the whole Ukraine, but soon they disappeared with few exceptions in that part which came under the Muscovite rule. AroundÂ 1740 the left-bank Ukraine had 860Â schools, and 60Â years later only a dozen.Â .Â .Â .\n\nÂ p30Â InÂ 1800, Tsar Paul forbade the construction of churches in the Ukrainian style with three cupolas; only the Muscovite style was permitted.\n\nThe whole nineteenth century is also filled with the Russian persecutions of the Ukrainian language and nation. InÂ 1835 the self-government of Kiev based on the German Magdeburg Law was liquidated; inÂ 1840 the Lithuanian Law Codex was abolished and Russian Laws in the courts in the Ukraine were introduced; inÂ 1843 the obligatory passports were introduced; inÂ 1839 the remnants of the Ukrainian Catholic Church on the right bank liquidated. Tsar NicolasÂ I organized a special committee for the Russification of the Ukraine and the erasing of all traces of different Ukrainian traditions.\n\nBut in spite of all these persecutions of the Ukrainian language, there was, in the Ukrainian folksongs and folklore, very much life beneath this official Russification, and soon the upper class returned to the use of it. And inÂ 1798 there appeared the travesty on the Aeneid by Kotlyarevksy, written in the Ukrainian vernacular, which was followed by the works of Hulak Artemovsky, Kvitka, Hrebinka, and others. Of great importance were the anthologies of Ukrainian folksongs by Maxymovych, Sreznewsky, and by the Russian Tsertelev, who was deeply moved by the great spiritual wealth and creative energy of the Ukrainians. \"Do you know,\" wrote Tsertelev, \"that IÂ value this popular poetry more highly than the major part of our (Russian) romances and ballads and even many of our romantic poems.\" And soon the national bard Taras Shewchenko appeared asking in the dark night of Tsarism: \"When will at last arrive also our Washington, with the new and just law (The American Declaration of Independence)?\" Russian PanâSlavism (in reality brutal PanâMuscovitism) was opposed by the Ukrainians by means of the ideology of the Brotherhood of SS.Â Cyril and Methodius, which repeated the Western European ideas with which Mickiewicz fanaticized the Poles.\n\nAnd soon Moscow acted again. InÂ 1847, the leaders of this brotherhood, Kostomarov, Shevchenko, and Kulisch, were arrested and the government confiscated everything which appeared in Ukrainian. Russian censor­ship was in no hurry: Metlynsky's collection of songs were submitted to the censor inÂ 1847 and returned from the office inÂ 1854. The anthology of works of Ukrainian writers remained two years in the censor's office and returned half confiscated. Besides, the word volya, \"liberty,\" was confiscated, even in the phrase kin' hulaye na voli, \"the horse enjoys its freedom.\" The censor treated mercilessly the works of Hrebinka, Artemovsky-Hulak, Fedkovych, Zinkivsky, Marko Vovchok, Nechuy-Levytsky. .Â .Â . The government forbade the use of the terms \"Ukraine,\" \"Ukrainian\"; even \"Little Russia\" was changed into \"South Russia\" or simply \"Russia.\" The censor­ship refused permission to print the reader of Potebnya, the novels of Nechuy-Levytsky, Mykola Djerya, Zaporozhtsi, and Chmarya; a pamphlet: \"About the life of the human body\" by Maryupolec; a pamphlet: \"Advice to mothers\" by Myrovets; pamphlets about \"Volcanos,\" about \"The Mountains,\"Â etc.\n\nInÂ 1863, the minister of interior, Walujew, issued his famous circular stating that a separate Ukrainian language never existed, does not Â p31Â exist, and never will exist, and the censor­ship refused permission to print the translation of the Bible into Ukrainian by F.Â Morachevsky.Â .Â .Â .\n\nFromÂ 1862 toÂ 1872 the Russian censor­ship passed a single Ukrainian pamphlet.Â .Â .Â . But luckily for the Ukrainians a part of their ethnographic territory after the partitions of the Polish Commonwealth and later also Bukovina became parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Therefore they transferred the printing activity to Lviv in Galicia, even to Budapest, later to Praha, and to Switzerland.\n\nIn the yearÂ 1875 the southwestern branch of the Geographical Society controlled by Ukrainian scholars, was closed in Kiev and soon the leading Ukrainian professors Dragomanov (history), Zieber (economy), and Chubinsky (ethnography) were dismissed from the University of Kiev.\n\nIn the yearÂ 1876 the Tsar signed in the BadÂ Ems the following Ukaz â which is a unique document in European history:\n\n\"(1)Â The importation into the Russian Empire without special permission of the 'Central Censor­ship over printing' of all books and pamphlets in Ukrainian is forbidden.\n\n\"(2)Â The printing and publishing in the Empire of original works and translations in this language is forbidden with the exception of:\n\n\"(a)Â Historical documents and monuments;\n\n\"(b)Â Works of belle-lettres , but with the proviso that in the documents the orthography of the originals be retained; in works of belle-lettres no deviations from the accepted Russian orthography are permitted and permission for their printing should be given only by the Central Censor­ship over printing, after the examination of the manuscripts;\n\n\"(3)Â All theatrical performances and lectures in Ukrainian, as well as printing of texts to musical notes is forbidden.\"\n\nConsequently, the censor refused to allow composer Sokolowsky to print a collection of Ukrainian folksongs with their Ukrainian texts, and passed it only with a French text. InÂ 1880, the censor burned the Ukrainian translation of the Book of Job. InÂ 1883 the Russians refused permission to print the translation of the works of Shakespeare and they remained in manuscript 20Â years. InÂ 1884, they forbade the printing of Nishchynsky's translation of Homer's Odyssey. InÂ 1885, they forbade the printing of a reader and reading books for children in Ukrainian. Only near the close of the century did the censor­ship become weaker, and the works of Nechuy-Levytsky, Myrny, Kotsiubynsky, Hrinchenko, Shevchenko, Marko Vovchok, Rudansky, Svydnytsky, Hlibov, Franko, Teslenko, Vasylchenko, and others began to appear; only afterÂ 1905 there was a short time of relief.\n\nIt must be kept in mind that these persecutions and acts of Russification were backed not only by the whole Russian administration, schools, and army, but by the Russian Church with the famous Russificators Anthony and Eulogy;​a the universities with Russificators such as Pogodin, Florinsky; by the Russian black hundred press and Purishkevich, the chief of Russian hooligans and apostles of the permanent pogrom of all nonâRussian nationalities.\n\nÂ p32Â We cannot but draw attention here to the great moral courage and objectivity of a group of Russian scholars headed by Shakhmatov, who inÂ 1906, in a special declaration of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, defended the independence of the Ukrainian language and its right to free development.​16\n\nThese examples may suffice. Similar persecutions were suffered by all the nonâRussian languages and nations in the Russian Empire, especially the languages of the Caucasus and Turkestan.\n\n4.Â The Fight of the Oppressed Nationalities Against Russian Tyranny\n\nNot only did the Poles, the Lithuanians, the Ukrainians, and the Byelo-Ruthenians fight against Russian tyranny, defending their freedoms, but the whole modern history of Russia is internally a constant civil war between the oppressed nationalities and Russia, which from time to time flares up in full force, then again glimmers in the embers of Russian repressions. This fight forms practically one whole and is systematically disregarded by American historians of Russian descent.\n\nÂ p33Â We should like briefly to survey this struggle against Russia. Simultaneously with the fight of the Ukrainians against Muscovy, after the death of Khmelnitsky, the DonÂ Cossacks revolted inÂ 1667â1678 and their leader Stephen Razin became the legendary hero of the Volga peasantry. InÂ 1773â1775 the Ural Cossacks with O.Â Pugatchev, repeated their rebellion. In this fight the Kazakhs also participated. In this territory from the shores of the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea there were fromÂ 1826â1834 145Â rebellions; fromÂ 1838â1854 the people organized 848Â smaller and larger uprisings. The Cossacks regarded themselves, and regard themselves now, as a separate nationality from the Muscovites.\n\nThe subdued peoples of the Asiatic part of Russia have a fine record of uprisings against Russia. In Kazakhstan​17 the defense against the Russian occupation lasted fromÂ 1783â1794 under the leader­ship of S.Â Datov. In theÂ 30's andÂ 40's of the nineteenth century the Kazakhs again revolted against the confiscation of land by Russia. The largest revolts occurred betweenÂ 1837â1838 under the leader­ship of I.Â Tayman. The Uzbeks constantly revolted, fromÂ 1838â1898 they rebelled 608Â times; great rebellions occurred inÂ 1875 andÂ 1885 â all suppressed by mass executions.\n\nThe Siberian peoples also revolted in theÂ 30's andÂ 40's under the leader­ship of W.Â Pyatomlyn. The separatist tendencies there remained strong; even newcomers, immigrants, supported them; the Russian police uncovered a special organization of this movement inÂ 1864.\n\nThe Bashkirs, Tatars, Mariis, Chuvashs, and Komis were in constant turmoil; in Bashkiria the people rebelled inÂ 1840 andÂ 1874. Because inÂ 1906 the Russian government forbade the Komis and Kalmyks to settle within the circuit of ten kilometers from every Russian colony, they revolted.\n\nThe fight of the Caucasus against the Russians was heroic. The Georgians revolted inÂ 1804, 1807, 1812, 1841 â in Abkhazia inÂ 1877. The Azerbaijanians fought fromÂ 1870â1880, the Armenians fromÂ 1885â1886, the Caucasian Highlanders fought the Russians under the leader­ship of Shamyl for twenty years and not untilÂ 1859 did he surrender, although the spirit of the Highlanders was never broken.​18\n\nIn the decades before WorldÂ WarÂ I the oppressed nationalities gave many leading personalities to the revolutionary movement in Tsarist Russia. As the revolutionary movement of these decades merged with the Socialist movement, in which the Russian socialists and social revolutionaries participated and which they also led, the significance of the participation of these representatives of the nonâRussian nationalities in the revolutionary fight against Russian tyranny is often disregarded. This participation was a continuation of the fight for national freedom of the oppressed peoples, who attempted to use the Russian socialist movement for their own liberation.\n\nÂ p34Â The revolution ofÂ 1905 showed immediately all the national problems of Russia and the elections to the first Duma, carried through in a relatively honest way, gave all the oppressed nationalities many representatives in the Russian parliament. And immediately at the initiative of Alexander Lednicki all the nonâRussian nationalities formed a common front against the Russians in the soâcalled \"Club of the Autonomists,\" demanding national self-government for their countries. The Russian tyranny, backed also by the chauvinism of the overwhelming part of the Russian intelligentsia, stopped the peaceful transformation of Russia into a commonwealth of free nationalities, dissolved the Duma, changed the electoral laws, and the democratic spring ended with a real Russian reactionary winter. All the nonâRussian nationalities became finally disappointed in the Russian liberals and soâcalled democrats and were brought to the conviction that only an active fight against the Roman Herrenvolk could give them freedom.\n\n5.Â The Victory and Defeat of the National Idea\n\nTsarist Russia has done in foreign politics everything in her power to combat outside Russia the ideas of the American and French revolutions, with which her nationality problem was inseparably united.\n\nBut no unholy \"Holy Alliance\" could abolish the progress of individual freedom and national liberty in Europe. Gradually the national idea dissolved the Ottoman Empire, liberated Roumania, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Albania, and slowly undermined also the foundations of Austria-Hungary and Russia, the \"Prison of nationalities.\"\n\nThe economic rivalries between the European Powers led later to the reciprocal use by these powers of the national ideas of the oppressed nationalities against one another. England tried to weaken the junior partner of Germany, Austria-Hungary, by sympathizing with the national ideas of the Czechs and Slovaks, Poles, Croatians, Slovenes, Italians, and Roumanians; Russia, so intolerant in internal politics of all the nonâRussian nationalities, especially of the Poles, Ukrainians, Byelo-Ruthenians, the Baltic, Caucasian and Turkestanian nations, in foreign politics supported the national aspirations of the Serbs, Montenegrins, Croats, and Slovenes, and tried to create by heavy subsidies also a Russophile orientation among the Ukrainians in Austria-Hungary; Germany fought Russian opposition against her Berlin-Bagdad project by supporting the idea of the dissolution of Russia in her national parts and supporting the national ideas of the Finns, Lithuanians, Byelo-Ruthenians, Ukrainians, of the Caucasian and Turkestanian nations. Germany besides fought England by supporting the Irish and Indians. France fought for the restoration of the self-determination of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany by sympathizing with the Poles annexed to Prussia.\n\nThus, the national idea of the oppressed nationalities became the sharpest weapon in the ideological war between the European powers, and was closely connected with their foreign politics and economical conceptions, which before WorldÂ WarÂ I finally appeared as the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance, both promising freedom to the oppressed nationalities in their desired sphere of influence.\n\nÂ p35Â The whole European policy, which the American historians seldom understand, was conducted on two levels. The ministries of existing European powers, exploiting the national ideas for their purposes, is the upper level; but there existed at the same time a lower level: the struggle for freedom of the oppressed nationalities, usually under leader­ship of under­ground organizations, backed by public opinion. These nationalities consciously exploited the rivalries of the European powers for the realization of their national aims. This whole period is characterized by the struggle for democracy and the advance of socialism in Europe, giving the national ideas of the subdued nationalities the general character of the struggle for social justice and self-government. Shining examples of independence showed the way to the realization of the national ideas: the revolutionary spirit of Ireland against England and the indomitable will for liberty of Poland, Lithuania, Byelo-Ruthenia, Ukraine, and of the heroic Caucasian nations against Russia, and of the Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians against Turkey.\n\nThese revolutionary ideas not only penetrated the oppressed nonâRussian nationalities in European Russia, but also many nationalities of Asiatic Russia, whose youth was usually studying at the Russian European universities. Thus, through this underground, the modern national idea continued its victorious march into Russian Asia.\n\nWorldÂ WarÂ I was an explosion of all the economic, territorial, and political rivalries of England, France, Russia on the one side and of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey on the other. This explosion found a tremendous response among the nonâRussian nationalities in Russia. Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey, now openly including the liberation of the nonâRussian nationalities in their war aims, were supported in the war against Russia by Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Finnish, Azerbaijanian, Turkestanian, Georgian, Tatarian political organizations and formations of fighting volunteers. These facts hastened the military and political breakdown of the Russian tyranny. And as a matter of fact the revolution in Russia inÂ 1917 started with the mutiny of the guards, composed of Ukrainians,​19 who refused to fire upon strikers, and with mass desertions from the front of soldiers of all nonâRussian nationalities. It must be clearly stated that these peoples did not revolt in order to help Kaiserism or effete Austria-Hungary to defeat democratic France or England. J.Â Pilsudski, who later became marshal, gave a good formulation of the political tactics of the under­ground of the oppressed nonâRussian nationalities: first, the Russian Tsarist Empire must be destroyed, then we will help the West to destroy the other oppressors, Prussia (Germany) and Austria. The peace of Brest Litovsk was not only the victory of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey over Russia, but also a victory of the national ideas of the nonâRussian nationalities over Russia in the West and the beginning of Russia's dissolution.\n\nLet us survey the revolution in Russia from the point of view of the national idea, which aimed at the realization in this vast territory of the great European idea of freedom.\n\nÂ p36Â We deliberately speak about the \"revolution in Russia\" and not about the \"Russian revolution.\" This latter term is very misleading for Americans and is systematically used by the (white and red) Russian-inspired historians in the United States in order to hide the most important question and cause of the revolution in Russia: the nationality problem of the old empire.\n\nActually, two revolutions started in Russia in 1917: a Russian revolution in the Russian ethnographic territory, with primarily political, later social aims and an anti-Russian revolution in all the nonâRussian ethnographic territories of the oppressed nonâRussian nationalities with aims primarily national and social, which could be realized by the departure of the Russian profiteering classes from the nonâRussian territories.\n\nThis anti-Russian revolution was soon greatly intensified by the ideas proclaimed by President Wilson, when WorldÂ WarÂ I in its final stage brought into European politics a power from outside of Europe, theÂ U.Â S.Â A. In all the great ideological processes the 14Â points, the self-determination principle for the nationalities and the idea of the League of Nations played a decisive role.\n\nThe last fateful act which preceded the dissolution of the Russian Empire and Brest Litovsk, was the permission given by Germany to Lenin and his bolsheviks to return from exile to Petrograd. Thus, there returned home the man who transferred VonÂ Clausewitz' methods into politics with a blueprint (long ago thought out) for the world revolution and the establishment of the dictator­ship of the Russian proletariat.\n\nThe revolution in Russia ofÂ 1917â1918 opened the doors to freedom and sovereignty for all the subject peoples under Tsarist rule. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, White Ruthenia, Kubania, and the Caucasian countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, North Caucasia), the whole of Turkestan became free and independent, while the DonÂ Cossacks and the various Tatar peoples experienced a great national revival.\n\nAll these nationalities responded enthusiastically to the principles of President Wilson and to his new international institution, the League of Nations. In throwing off the chains of Russian slavery they were willing to accept the duties and obligations of this new World Confederation, and longingly waited for the leader­ship of theÂ U.Â S.Â A. The seeds of a real Eastern democracy, called forth and animated by the great American idealist, burst into full bloom, and were cultivated by the Social Democrats and Social Revolutionaries, who in all the various national democratic republics formed the governments and were backed by the entire equally enthusiastic youth of their nations. They believed that a new era was coming to give humanity at last the reign of law, and therefore all these Socialist governments decided at once to disarm their nations â as a visible sign of goodwill and further faith toward the League of Nations and an example for the coming universal disarmament.\n\nUnfortunately, this blossom of democracy, this freedom and sovereignty of the nationalities, was short-lived. The most important reasons for the catastrophic turn of events were in our opinion:\n\nÂ p37Â a)Â On the ruins of Tsarist Russia after a coup d'Ã©tat and the scattering of a lawfully elected Parliament, there was installed, within the walls of Moscow, the Communistic Dictator­ship with its ideology of the coming proletarian world revolution. To achieve this Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin forcibly mobilized, armed, drilled, and fanaticized the (Great) Russian working masses; they murdered all opponents or put them in concentration camps; they abolished all human rights and put forward, against the idea of Democracy, the idea of the proletarian dictator­ship, against the idea of the League of Nations in Geneva they advanced their own method for the organization of the entire world: the Comintern of Moscow, the blueprint for the World Soviet Union.\n\nThus, at once there was created an ideological battle front in Eastern Europe between the \"national ideas\" of the liberated nationalities with their Democratic Republics, Socialist Governments, and their support of the League of Nations in Geneva, and the Proletarian Dictator­ship of Soviet Moscow with its Comintern, which was intended to use \"Red Russia\" as the mighty base for the world revolution. The Russian Communists started a furious propaganda campaign against the sovereignty of the nationalities conquered and oppressed by the Russian Tsars; they accused all democrats, who had often spent years in Tsarist prisons for their national cause, as traitors, agents, and hirelings of capitalism; they ridiculed the League of Nations as a \"bourgeois deceit,\" as a \"devil's kitchen,\" a \"prostitute,\" and started at once with the newly formed Red armies a series of aggressive wars against the neighboring peaceful, disarmed democratic republics.\n\nb)Â TheÂ U.Â S.Â A. was not prepared politically for a constructive leader­ship of the world or an active collaboration in world politics. The American people and authorities were completely unaware that the new democratic republics of the former oppressed nationalities in Tsarist Russia were in reality \"the children of Wilson's principles and of the American Declaration of Independence.\" The greatest blow which the young Eastern Democracy received was given by President Wilson himself when he openly repudiated the right of \"self-determination\" for the nations of former Tsarist Russia. There is no need to throw stones at the tragic figure of President Wilson. It is enough to cite the opinion of Robert Lansing (The Peace Negotiations, 1921, p99):\n\nCharacteristic of the American policy of that time is the case of the Ukraine in the League of Nations in Geneva.\n\nInÂ 1920 the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic, for its part, instructed its minister in London, Mr.Â Arnold Margolin, former president of the Jewish Territorial Organization in the Ukraine, judge of the Ukrainian Supreme Court, the well-known jurist and the defender of Beilis, to submit an application for the admission of the Ukraine to the League of Nations.\n\nThe aim of the application was obvious: the Ukrainian Democratic Government wished to submit to the judgment of the League of Nations the causes of the war due to the invasion of the Ukraine by the Communist army from Moscow, and to ask the League of Nations to bring this dispute to a peaceful end. By the entrance of the Ukraine into the League of Nations a foundation was to be laid for the political and economic reconstruction of Eastern Europe.\n\nMr.Â Arnold Margolin in his note​20 summed up as a lawyer the international status of the Ukraine:\n\nIn the denial of the application of the Ukraine for admission to the League of Nations a note by the Undersecretary of State of the United States, Mr.Â Bainbridge Colby, to the Italian Minister at Washington, Baron Camille Romano Avezzana, played a decisive part. This note is an interesting example of anthem lack of information concerning the problems of Eastern Europe, due to the want of elementary knowledge of the history of Tsarist Russia.\"​21\n\nThe Ukraine soon became Soviet Moscow's first Korea! The American note was even an open invitation to aggression and annexation. Thus the Moscow bolsheviks then concentrated all their forces against the rich land of Ukraine. Owing to lack of munitions, arms, and medicaments, the Ukrainian government, its army and the provisional Parliament consisting at that time of representatives of all democratic parties, left the country and sought refuge in the west, in France.\n\nc)Â While these blows were felt in the political field, Winston Churchill â who as a young Tory gained wide experience in \"dealing with the nationality problems\" in India, safer, Egypt, and Ireland â administered a still heavier blow to Ukrainian and Caucasian democracy in a realm of greatest importance: in the military-strategical field. Already WilhelmÂ II, after the downfall of Tsarist Russia in the East, followed the policy of restoring Russian Tsarism, and gathered on the DonÂ under the leader­ship of Generals Krasnow and Denikin the White Russian Tsaristic Army. After the downfall of Germany and the restoration of the Democratic Ukrainian People's Republic in the Ukraine, Churchill granted millions of tons of war material and millions of financial means and full support of Denikin and induced France in the Crimea to do the same for General Wrangel, whose group was even then recognized as the Provisional Government of \"Russia.\"\n\nThus the young Ukrainian and Caucasian democracies with their improvised and badly equipped armies were suddenly compelled to fight a war on two fronts: against the Communistic aggressors, the Communistic dictator­ship in the north and against the Tsaristic reactionary dictator­ship of Denikin and Wrangel on the other fronts. The Red and White Russians had on one point a common aim: the suppression of the freshly gained national sovereignty of the former oppress nonâRussian nationalities and the destruction of the new democratic republics.\n\nThese were the chief reasons that determined the result of the aggressive war of the Communistic Moscow dictator­ship against the Â p40Â liberated democratic nations and their republics â aÂ war which decided the fate of Democracy and of the League of Nations of Geneva so far as Eastern Europe was concerned. The lack of understanding in Western Europe of the Eastern problems and the disregard of Wilson's principles led to the complete breakdown of the ideas of democracy and of the authority of the League of Nations in the East, contributed to the victory of the totalitarian Communistic dictator­ship and brought about its later results: the appearance of Mussolini and Hitler in Europe.\n\nThe first victim of Soviet Moscow's armed aggression was Ukraine. After Ukraine the next victims were White Ruthenia, Don, Caucasus, Kubania, and Turkestan (the national governments of Kokand and Alash-Orda).\n\nThe League of Nations was informed of these facts of international banditry, but it kept silent about these evident cases of aggression. The League quietly watched the Soviet Moscow dictator­ship annihilate all the democratic republics of Eastern Europe one after another, using that technique of aggression which is now known to everybody. Agents of Soviet Moscow's imperialism appointed by the Comintern occupied the countries one after another by means of the Soviet Red Army, murdered the democratic leaders and enslaved the peoples, while pretending to liberate them, and forced the legal governments of these peoples, confirmed by democratic parliaments, into exile.\n\nFrom this pogrom of the democracies in Eastern Europe only Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were saved, partly because of the exhaustion and weariness of the Soviet Red Army after the fights in Ukraine, Kubania, and Caucasia.\n\nThus the nonâRussian nationalities of former Tsarist Russia lost the war â in the defense of democracy and the League of Nations â against the aggressive Communist dictator­ship of Moscow, which has been indirectly supported by the American policy of denying their rights of self-determination.\n\nThe Author's Notes:\n\n1 The battle of Poltava is listed in the book of Edward Shepherd Creasy, Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World, London,Â 1851.\n\n2 Cf.Â O.Â Halecki, The Limits and Divisions of European History, pp85â101.\n\n3 Cf.Â The Slavonic and Eastern European Review, Vol.Â XIX,Â 1939â1940, pp71â72.\n\n4 Cf.Â ibid., and also Roman Smal-Stocki, Die Germanisch-Deutschen Kulturinfluesse im Spiegel der Ukrainische Sprache (Leipzig: Hirzel Verlag, 1942); F.Â Dvornik, The Kiev State and its Relations with Western Europe, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 29Â (1947), pp27â46.\n\n5 Jan Kucharzewski, The Origins of Modern Russia, 1948, p4.\n\n6 W.Â BÄ czkowski, Towards an Understanding of Russia, Jerusalem, 1947, p163.\n\n7 P.Â Pobedonostsev (1829â1907), Cabinet minister under NicholasÂ II advocated the following solution of the \"Jewish problem\": one third of the Jews has to be converted to Christianity, one third forced to emigrate, and one third starved.

Foremost is the work in French, LaÂ Vie deÂ Mazepa (Paris, 1931), written jointly by a Ukrainian scholar, Elias Borshchak, and RenÃ© Martel, the French writer. Prof.Â Borshchak also wrote The Great Mazepist Hryhor Orlyk, Lieutenant General of the Army of LouisÂ XV (in Ukrainian, Lviv, 1932) â another Ukrainian historian, Bohdan Krupnycky, wrote Hetman Mazepa und Seine Zeit (Berlin, 1942), as well as a historical study, \"The Mazepists\" (The Ukrainian Quarterly, Vol.Â IX, No.Â 3); another penetrating article on Mazepa, entitled, \"Mazepa's Champion in the 'Secret duÂ Roi,' of LouisÂ XV, King of France,\" was written by Prof.Â N.Â Chubaty (The Ukrainian Quarterly Vol.Â V, No.Â 1).There are several historical studies on CharlesÂ XII, King of Sweden, and Hetman Mazepa in Swedish.\n\n15 They were edited by Prince deÂ Tokary Tokarzewsky-Karasiewicz and published in Les Travaux deÂ l'Institut Scientifique Ukrainien, Vol.Â XVII, Warsaw.\n\n16 \"InÂ 1906 the Academy of Sciences was requested by the Council of Ministers to give a considered opinion upon the Ukrainian language. For this purpose, under the presidency of F.Â E.Â Korsh, a special Commission was composed consisting of A.Â S.Â Famitsin, V.Â V.Â Zelenski, from Fortunatov to Fortunatov, A.Â A.Â Shakhmatov, A.Â S.Â Lappo-Danilevski and S.Â F.Â Oldenburg. AÂ report prepared by F.Â E.Â Korsh and A.Â A.Â Shakhmatov was approved by the Academy and submitted to the Council of Ministers; its main conclusions were that historic circumstances had brought about a complete differentiation between South-West Russia (Ukraine) and the region inhabited by (Great) Russians, that this differentiation was reflected in the languages of the two peoples, that instead of providing them with a common language, historical development had deepened dialectal differences manifested from the time when the two peoples first appeared on the stage of history, that in view of the fact that there was in existence a Ukrainian language, as spoken by the people of Poltava, Kiev, Lwow, the (Great) Russian language spoken by the people of Moscow, Yaroslavl, Archangelsk and Novgorod, could not be considered as 'allâRussian.' Finally, the recommendation was made that the Ukrainian people should have the same right as the (Great) Russian people to speak their own language in public and to print in it.\n\n\"InÂ 1906, the year when the report alluded to was issued, in response to an inquiry from the Council of Ministers, the Universities of Kiev and Kharkov endorsed the findings of the Academy, and added a request that Ukrainian literature should be given the same rights as those enjoyed by Russian literature, that the Holy Scripture should be translated into Ukrainian, that teaching in the primary schools in Ukraina should be conducted in Ukrainian and that Ukrainian periodicals should be permitted to enter Russia from Galicia (Austria).\" (Quotation from Lancelot Lawton, Ukraina: Europe's Greatest Problem, London,Â 1939.)\n\n17 Regarding the Kazakhs the Russian administration applied the principle: \"There is no other way to manage the Kazakhs except through massacres,\" cf.Â Encyclopedia Americana, p291, Vol.Â 27, 1947.\n\n18 Cf.Â J.Â Milton Mackie, Life of Schamyl and Narrative of the Circassian War of Independence Against Russia, Boston, 1856.\n\n19 The Volynian Regiment revolted MarchÂ 12.\n\n20 Cf.Â Roman Smal-Stocki, \"Application of the Ukrainian Republic for Admission to the League of Nations,\" Paris,Â 1930, Association Ukrainienne pour laÂ SociÃ©tÃ© des Nations.\n\n21 Cf.Â its analysis, ibid., pp.Â IIIâV.\n\nThayer's Note:"
