IndiaGlitz reported yesterday about Yash ChopraÂs ÂDhoom 2Â set to upstage ShahrukhÂs ÂDonÂ because of the ÂdifferencesÂ between the two Bollyood bigwigs. Continuing in the same vein, is another Breaking News: Aditya Chopra, the man with the midas touch who has given two of the biggest hits ÂDilwale Dulhania Le JayengeÂ and ÂMohabbateinÂ (Both starring SRK) has decided to cast Abhishek Bachchan in his next directorial venture. Rani Mukherjee, in all probability will be the female lead.

It is very clear that Yash Chopra camp wish to give a very clear message to Shahrukh Khan that nobody is indispensable. It is being said that Yash Chopra is incensed with SRK for his ÂsilentÂ opposition of Amitabh Bachchan and thatÂs why son Abhishek is being cast in AdiÂs film. Chopra Senior had strongly defended Shahrukh when Sunny Deol was angry about being shortchanged in ÂDarrÂ. And since that Hit, SRK has featured in all their films, be it ÂDDLJÂ, ÂDil To Pagal HaiÂ, ÂMohabbateinÂ and ÂVeer ZaaraÂ. With the ten year bond coming apart, Chopras are bonding with Deols once again by signing Bobby Deol for Shaad AliÂs ÂJhoom Barabar JhoomÂ. Maybe itÂs their way of burying the hatchet.

With Bollywood riding on the recent successes, itÂs also time for some big-time-animosities. And inflated balloons of ego being burst by Âmutual compromiseÂ. The next move will be from the depleted SRK camp. IndiaGlitz will be the first to report it to all our loyal patrons the world over.
