We also talk about director Osgood Perkins’ immersive framing and the film’s themes of parenting and childhood trauma.\n\n—\n\nHosted by Akhil Arora and Rohan Naahar, The Long Take is fully bootstrapped.

Write to us at thelongtakepod@gmail.com.\n\nIn its third and potentially final season, Kota Factory seems to be responding to past criticism.\n\nWe discuss the show’s sudden bout of self-reflection, and the confused manner in which it examines the harsh realities of towns like Kota and the industries they service. We also talk about its aversion to human moments, and why the handful of them this season stand out.\n\nLater in the episode, we wonder why the show remains watchable on a very fundamental level, even though it often makes the same storytelling mistakes that it used to.\n\n—\n\nHosted by Akhil Arora and Rohan Naahar, The Long Take is fully bootstrapped.

We also talk about Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra’s central performances as the slain husband-wife folk singer duo and address the ‘Hindi gaze’ that Ali brings to this inherently Punjabi tale.\n\nAlong the way, we also discuss the nature of high and low art and the film’s many defences of Chamkila’s controversial music.\n\n—\n\nHosted by Akhil Arora and Rohan Naahar, The Long Take is fully bootstrapped.

Anderson also flips through genres and tones, but presents each movie in his own unique style.\n\nWhile The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is by far the most uplifting of the bunch, the rest—Poison, The Swan, and The Rat Catcher—are a more cynical experience.

It’s streaming for free on JioCinema, but audiences should demand money for surviving it.\n\nWe discuss the film’s laughable John Wick and Jason Bourne ambitions, given Zafar and Kapoor’s sheer disinterest in doing the actual hard work to achieve good results.\n\nThe action is choppily edited, the storytelling is confusing, and the background score is an assault on the senses. For a wall-to-wall action movie, you never actually get the sense that the main character is the one doing the fighting, but at least Ronit Roy and Sanjay Kapoor understood the assignment.\n\n—\n\nHosted by Akhil Arora and Rohan Naahar, The Long Take is fully bootstrapped.
