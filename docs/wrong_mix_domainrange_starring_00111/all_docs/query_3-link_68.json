        "text": "Indian film studioTemplate:SHORTDESC:Indian film studio\n\nTemplate:Use Indian English\n\nRed Giant Movies is an Indian film production and distribution company headed by actor, politician and businessman Udhayanidhi Stalin. It has distributed nearly all major films in Tamil Nadu, and often accused of having monopoly in Tamil market.[1][2][3]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe proposed venture of the studio was meant to be a collaboration between director Thamizhvaanan and actor Vishal, but the film never took off.[4] Subsequently, the first production of Red Giant Movies was the action comedy Kuruvi (2008) starring Vijay, following which the studio financed K. S. Ravikumar's Aadhavan (2009) starring Suriya.[5] The studio later worked on big budget films including the Kamal Haasan-starrer Manmadan Ambu (2010) and AR Murugadoss's 7aum Arivu (2011).\n\nThe studio received acclaim in 2010, when all four of its distribution projects, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, Madrasapattinam, Boss Engira Bhaskaran and Mynaa became commercial successes.[6] In the case of Mynaa, the studio received praise for backing and choosing to purchase a small budget film and helping market it as a bigger film.[7] Since the end of 2011, Red Giant Movies has concentrated solely on producing films starring Udhayanidhi Stalin. The production house revived its widespread operations in the production and distribution of films after 2021. Red Giant Movies is currently established as the leading production house in the Tamil film industry with numerous blockbusters released under their banner including Vikram (2022). Red Giant Movies recently joined hands with Kamal Haasan's Raj Kamal Films International (RKFI) for the star's greatly anticipated film to be directed by maverick filmmaker Mani Ratnam.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilms produced[]\n\nYear Title Director Cast Synopsis Page Template:Tooltip/styles.css has no content. 2008 Kuruvi Vijay, Trisha, Suman, Vivek A man embarks on a quest to save his father who has been kept captive by a gangster.
