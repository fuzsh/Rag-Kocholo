        "text": "I love the Amul hoardings. If I “get” it then I know I’m on the ball with what’s going down in the motherland.\n\nAnd now I’m randomly wondering whatever happened to the “I love you Rasna.” girl? Did she make it big or did she end up in the cloudy space of child prodigy’s who were doing so fantastically well but then they grew up. (No offense Jugal Hansraj.) I know the little girl from Mr. India. She’s quite the enigma now too. Presenting Huzaan Khodaiji.\n\nAnyway if you have some time to kill post me a quick comment with what each one of these is about and if you get 5 right I’ll send you something (not butter) for your trouble.\n\nBet you didn’t know that…\n\nAmul was formally registered on December 14, 1946. The brand name Amul, sourced from the Sanskrit word Amoolya, means priceless. It was suggested by a quality control expert in Anand and it was chosen because it was a perfect acronym for Anand Milk Union Limited.\n\nThe Amul ads are one of the longest running ads based on a theme, now vying for the Guinness records for being the longest running ad campaign ever. Sylvester daCunha, was the managing director of the advertising agency, ASP, that created the campaign in 1967 whose charm has endured fickle public opinion, gimmickry and all else.\n\nIt’s that time of the year again where Bollywood gets ready, set go to toot its own horns. (I wonder if this year’s hosts will take a dig at all the filmy face offs happening this year.) I dug up a few candid shots from last year’s hooplah. Enjoy!\n\nMeanwhile Filmfare has announced who’s up for dibs on statutes for the best talent in Bollywood for 54th Idea Filmfare Awards; and the nominees (in alphabetical order) are:\n\nBEST FILM\n\nDostana\n\nGhajini\n\nJaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na\n\nJodhaa Akbar\n\nRab Ne Bana Di Jodi\n\nRock On!!\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nA.R.

To watch trailers and follow the action click here.)\n\nDIDJYA KNOW?\n\nAt first, the awards were called Clares after Clare Mendonca, the Times of India film critic who died the year of the first awards, 1954. However, the name didn’t stick.\n\nThe guest of honor at the first ever awards (March 21, 1954 at the Metro theater, Mumbai) was to be Gregory Peck. He couldn’t make it–his flight from Colombo, where he was on location for Purple Plain, was delayed. But he did attend the banquet that followed at the Willingdon Sports Club.\n\nIn 1969 Sunil Dutt who lost it to Dilip Kumar in the Best Actor category organized a party for the thespian after the awards function. This started the trend of post-award parties.\n\nIn 1975 Yash Chopra’s Deewaar swept all the awards except for the lead actor Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nAlso surprisingly the biggest blockbuster hit Sholay won only one Filmfare Award in 1975 and that too for Best Editing.\n\nIn the first Filmfare Awards ceremony, held in 1954, only five awards were presented – for the best film, the best director, the best actor, the best actress and the best music director.\n\nThe awards for lyricists and playback singers started only after 5 years of the inception of awards.\n\nTill 1966 there was no separate award for male and female playback singers.\n\nLata Mangeshkar refused to accept her first Filmfare award because the Filmfare statuette was designed in the shape of a woman and the woman had no clothes on. Since Lataji had reservations in accepting that nude statuette th award had to be wrapped with a handkerchief to be granted to Lataji.\n\nIn 2006, Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s movie ‘Black’ won 11 Filmfare awards, the most awards won by a movie in the history of Filmfare Awards.\n\nBest Music director was the only category in the Music genre that started with the birth of Filmfare Awards in 1953.\n\nThe top five Music Directors on the basis of number of times they have won the award are: Shankar-Jaikishen – 9, Laxmikant-Pyarelal – 7, A.R. Rehman – 5, Nadeem-Shravan – 4 and R.D.Burman – 3.\n\nJaved Akhtar set a record in 2004 when all the five songs chosen for the Best Lyrics category were written by him.\n\nThe Doordarshan had an objection with Amitabh Bachchan’s performance on the Jumma Chumma number on the Filmfare Awards event as the movie Hum had not yet been released by then and the song remained uncensored. The channel threatened to sue Filmfare for this but the matter subsequently dissolved.\n\nIn 1991 Dimple Kapadia gave a special award to husband Rajesh Khanna for completing 26 years in the film industry. In the same year Gulzar gave an award to his ex-wife Rakhee in the Best Supporting Actress category for Ram Lakhan and while handing over the trophy Gulzar in a very mischievous fashion said to Rakhee, “Aji Sunti Ho”.\n\nAfter winning numerous awards singer Lata Mangeshkar voluntary ousted herself from the Filmfare awards nominations so that fresh talents can get a chance. And after decades, in 1995, Lata Mangeshkar accepted the Best Playback Singer award for Hum Aapke Hai Kaun once again on popular demand.\n\nVyajayantimala didn’t accept the award for Devdas in the Best Supporting Actress category because she thought she was the lead actress of the film and not Suchitra Sen.\n\nIn the 25th year of Filmfare Award ceremony, the statue was made of silver, while in the 50th year of its celebration, gold status were given.\n\nThey have their own set of Filmfare Awards down south called Filmfare Awards South. (Now while that’s totally legit I can’t help but think its because the Bollywood fashion police may go ballistic if they were to see someone dressed like this walk down the red carpet!)\n\nFrom Geeta….\n\nto Seeta…* for those of you who haven’t seen Chaalbaaz that’s kind of like “from sizzling siren to simple dimple.”\n\nKatrina Kaif’s been shooting in Bhopal for Prakash Jha’s “Rajniti” where huge cutouts and posters of her character are all over the place. Apparently she playsa politician in the film (there’s some buzz about her role being based on Indira Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi’s life. I’m guessing Sonia but we’ll have to wait and see!) Katrina shot with Arjun Rampal and Manoj Bajpai during the last schedule Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgan and Ranbir Kapoor also star in the movie with her. The big deal is that she’s dressing down for this flick completely de-glamourised (can you believe this movie will have no songs? I always thought that was her forte – the slightly off beat lip-synch!)\n\nLarra Shah, Pritish Nandy, Dolly Thakore\n\nYou know how much Mumbai’s glitterati loves all this hocus pocus business right? Well good thing for Larra Shah who launched her do it yourself Tarot deck called “Miracle Cards” at Olive (Mahalaxmi), Mumbai. The cards got a test run with Pritish Nandy, Dolly Thakore, Sabina Singh, (Larra’s buddy) Sabina Chopra, Aarti Surendranath and Madhoo Shah. Even Mona Singh popped in for a suprise visit as did Nalandaa Bhandari and Rehan Shah.\n\nI admit I’ve gone the tarot route on occassion when I couldn’t make up my mind about some stuff. And more than anything else it gives you clarity (at best hope) about a situation you may be struggling with. Shirley Bose has always been quite comforting and I’d recommend some face time with her if you get a chance and I quite like Larra’s do-it-yourself option too. In fact she’s on air with me every Monday so call in for a free miracle card reading on 66943943 or send an SMS to ONE <space> your date of birth and your question to 53650."
