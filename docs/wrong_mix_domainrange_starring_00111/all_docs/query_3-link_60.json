        "text": "In his latest movie writer and director Alex Garland removes the bias of politics while studying violence. He takes away the most frequently asked question in times of war – which side stands for what? In Civil War, we are thrown in a war-torn America with no understanding of which political ideology stands on which side of the conflict. There is no Right or Left, but just a country ravaged by war.\n\nThis helps in focusing on the images rather than picking sides. It gives us the view that is as non-biased as a journalist is expected to have. It sets us up for a journey with Lee (Kristen Dunst), Joel (Wagner Moura), and Sammy (Stephen McKinley Henderson), three journalists who travel through a torn country intending to interview the President of the United States of America, accompanied by a young aspiring journalist Jessie (Cailee Spaenly). Amongst them, Lee is quite clearly the most celebrated, a photojournalist who aims to capture the war as it happens around her.\n\nGarland, who comes from a family of journalists, attempts to pay homage to the dedication of the professionals who risk their lives to record an ongoing war. But like any good storyteller, he does not lose his sight on the colder side of the profession too. In a fascinating case of juxtaposition, Lee speaks to Jessie about how the only reason she covers wars globally is to ensure that people at home remember the worst of violence and hence steer away from it. This comes disturbingly close to a moment when Lee tries to frame a perfect photo of two severely injured hostages with their captor, doing nothing to save the men from their impending doom. She is simply a professional capturing the action.\n\nThis is once again elaborated in the movie when Jessie clicks what Lee terms a “perfect photo” of a man who moans to death in front of them. The movie is both hailing how these journalists put their lives on the line for reporting but also critiques the professionalism that takes any shred of humanity away from them. It helps that Kunst gives a performance that makes Lee questionable, but never disgusting. You see the human in her, but you also see how her passion for work takes over when her hands hold a camera.\n\nThe narrative also gives her a terrific arc in the climax, where she becomes a photo, a moment locked in the civil war, not a person who lived a full life, but a moment that might be remembered for a long, long time. It also forever intertwines her with Jessie, who has grown up idolizing Lee’s work as a war photographer.\n\nUnlike a movie like Ex Machina, Garland’s terrific debut in 2014, Civil War is an understated study of violence. The movie gives some very real images of live violence, occasionally, locking the visuals into a still photograph, reminding the audience of the forgotten, unphotographed bits of war.\n\nIn moments the violence we watch appears like a video game, elaborating on how war is perceived from the lens of emotional dissonance. This is not a movie that makes you want to cry at the many deaths, and bullet shots, that occur throughout its runtime. Alex Garland has never been that filmmaker. His cinema stands tall as an intellectual entity, urging the audience to think by not offering easy escapes and simple solutions. Civil War is steeped in the same philosophy of filmmaking. It is not a film that draws any lines of right and wrong or provide any character with a worthy catharsis. It ends how it begins, right at the centre of violence and chaos.\n\nIn a world marred by a war between Russia and Ukraine, and a very public genocide of Palestinians by Israel, Civil War is a timely reminder of not only the importance of those who provide us photographs of these conflicts but also the evil of being an unbiased professional spectator. It is a cautionary tale for all of us to remember the people behind the images, stories, and arcs lost in snatching one glance from a larger life. It is a blurring gaze at the price paid for an impassioned existence and the reward awaiting a cold, professional head in the middle of a war. The movie asks us to find our own answer for what do we want to be.\n\nNow Streaming on Prime\n\nThe first few minutes of Kill are deceptively simple. Tulika (Tanya Maniktala) is getting engaged against her will to a family that casually fires bullets in the name of celebration. She is in love with Amrit (Lakshya), an NSG commando she has been in a relationship with for years. She is traveling to Delhi with her family after the engagement. Amrit boards the same train, unaware of the fate that awaits them.\n\nWritten and directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, Kill is one of those rare movies that feels like a masterpiece while you are in the process of watching it. For someone who is not exposed to the action genre beyond the largely stylized Hollywood, Kill could be an off-putting experience, simply because of how different it is from anything we have seen in India (especially the Hindi-speaking belt).\n\nUnlike the overhyped action sequences of Animal, which felt more choreographed – staged – and hence ultimately fake and stale, the action here – set inside the cramped space of railway compartments – feels urgent, chaotic, uncomfortable, and grotesque. It feels like how action should feel like. Terrifying, troubling not aspirational and heroic.\n\nWhat works for Kill is the perfect balance of style and realism. It is a masterclass in imagining and inventing action sequences. To imagine the Indian railway system for a gory action film is a masterstroke, elevated by the brilliant cinematography by Rafey Mehmood that makes the entire world of the movie tight to the point of claustrophobia. It also helps that Bhat’s writing and direction are smarter than you realize, doing things sometimes gallantly and otherwise subtly that take the movie into a space of immortality.\n\nTwenty minutes into the movie I realized that the title card had not appeared yet. As the characters boarded the train and a family (and extended family) of dacoits started to cause mayhem in the nighttime, I forgot about it, till the point when it finally appeared, feeling like a gut-punch, a throb against your neck. It suddenly turns the objective of the title card. It renders everything that we have seen hitherto as a mere prologue. As the three words appear – KILL – you realize that this is not just the title of the movie, but a war cry, an instruction to the protagonist of the movie to wreak havoc on the antagonists.\n\nIt turns the violence up by x100, making for an artistic, engrossing, visually gripping yet awful second half. While the movie’s dedication to being a breathless action piece is commendable, what truly works for the movie is its ability to keep the emotions intact. You care for Amrit and Tulika’s romance, you worry for Tulika’s sister, you understand the rhetoric of Beni (Ashish Vidyarthi) and despite everything, also sense the humanity behind the barbarity in Fani (Raghav Juyal).\n\nThe movie is rooted in its world and ensures to make us see these characters as individuals, flawed, fumbling, fractured individuals. It helps that Lakshya gives a memorable central performance, his eyes expressing more than any newcomer in recent years. The movie does falter in moments, especially in trying to effectively blend the line between the good and the bad. Fani does yell to Amrit at some point that he is a ‘rakshak’ (demon), but the movie fails to capitalize on the similarity between the dacoits and the barbarity of violence portrayed by Amrit, the NSG commando in the second half of the narrative.\n\nThere is a scene in Kill where an entire compartment of the train has a series of dead bodies hanging from the top. It is an effective, incredible visual of the kind that Indian audiences have seen in foreign films (the violence here feels closest to Korean cinema), and one that stays with you long after the movie ends. Kill is peppered with such masterful visuals. It does not spoon-feed the idea of futility around violence but makes sure that the visuals are so grotesque that even without words, you see the bloodlust in the man you are supposed to root for.\n\nIt is rare to feel you’ve just experienced a masterpiece. To watch Kill feels like that.\n\nA movie is as much about the story it is telling as it is about the era it is being made. It reflects not only the caliber of the artists involved in it but also a reminder of how entrapped they are within the expectations and designs of the era they are living in. Srikanth, now streaming on Netflix, is a sad reminder of a case where a great story and potentially a good movie is lost in the entrapments of the biopic formula that Hindi films are locked in.\n\nSpearheaded by an incredible performance by Rajkumar Rao as the titular Srikanth Bolla, a visually impaired entrepreneur, one almost at par with that of Naseeruddin Shah in Sparsh, Srikanth gets the tough bits right. Largely, the film gets its disability on point (of course steering towards inspiration porn in moments), but falters on the altar of storytelling.\n\nIn its attempt to capture every beat of the glorious life of Srikanth Bolla, director Tushar Hiranandani and writers Jagdeep Siddhu and Sumit Purohit fail to press pause in their narrative, always hurrying to the next achievement in Srikanth’s life rather than letting the present moment exist for long enough for its emotions to come through.\n\nThis is especially visible in a scene that starts with ripe promise and reaches a memorable emotional high before losing its momentum in the aspiration to give every scene an inspiring curve, forcing the audience to leave every scene with the same emotion of admiration than pure despair that then makes the eventual success feel earned and emotional.\n\nThe scene is set at the airport, where Srikanth is going to MIT for higher education. He is traveling alone, which goes against the airlines’ policy for visually impaired travelers. Desperate and lonely, we see Srikanth pleading with fellow passengers to lie to the authorities for him. It is a heart-wrenching scene where Srikanth’s ambitions, societal ableism, and his own vulnerability come out. Rao is terrific in conveying an array of emotions while wearing a smile on his face, and just when you feel that the scene is achieving what the rest of the movie hitherto had not, there is an improbable, heroic turn in the writing, where Srikanth dramatically convinces the authorities to mend their ways for him. In the next shot, we see him in the airplane, losing the emotional momentum that was built in the minutes before that.\n\nThis is a larger biopic problem in Hindi films currently. These movies are so desperate to celebrate the highs of the lives of their protagonists that they forget that highs only make sense if they are pitted against stark lows. Without these lows, the high loses its impact and turns an otherwise powerful story into a forgettable one. Maybe there needs to be a collective viewing of Inside Out (2015) for all screenwriters to understand what Joy accepts towards the end of that movie.\n\nSrikanth is just one of the many in this list of forgettable biopics. But it would be wrong to shun it entirely in that degraded pile headlined by Shabaash Mithu, Sam Bahadur, and Saand Ki Aankh. Powered by a memorable central performance that might lose out on posterity due to the mediocrity of the final product, and a strong grip on its disability politics and representation of an authentic disabled life on screen, Srikanth does a lot of things right in the direction of disability.\n\nOne of the highlights of this is in the final few minutes of the movie where Srikanth gives a speech standing at a podium, essentially speaking to his largely non-disabled audience, asking them to not hail him as an example par excellence, but instead supporting, loving, nurturing other people with disabilities around them how his teacher, friend, and romantic partner did to ensure Srikanth could be his best self. It is an important message, one that simply asks others to be an ally, a supportive presence in another disabled person’s life rather than hailing him and earning token points for being an inclusive person.\n\nSrikanth is by design a prisoner of inspiration porn. It sees its disabled protagonist as a hero and his life as a heroic tale that ought to inspire many. But it does something interesting with it in the second hour. We see Srikanth himself becoming a victim of inspiration porn, clouding his judgment as his mind corrupts into thinking about himself what a non-disabled community hails him as. In a sharper critique of inspiration porn and the way the majority looks at the disabled, a character like Srikanth could see himself as a God, the man with a Divya-Ang. But maybe that is expecting too much out of it.\n\nSrikanth does not shy away from showing its protagonist with grey shades, and that alone deserves appreciation. To have a character like him being shown as a corruptible, arrogant entrepreneur is an important milestone in the journey of representing disabled life in all its glorious complications on the big screen. It is an achievement in the arena of disability representation, but a failure in the arena of storytelling, snatching away the potential from it to become a memorable movie with a disabled protagonist.\n\nNow Streaming on Netflix\n\nIt has been nine years since we last visited the colourful mind of Riley, the human who was, in the first Inside Out, driven by simple emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear. We left her aged twelve, and now nine years later we are back in her brain, months after we last saw her in the timeline of the movie.\n\nThe sequel, Inside Out 2, embarks on a scary journey to match the wondrous marriage of imagination and magnificence that the first one achieved, and against all odds, in what might be a lean period for Pixar given their usual high standards, Inside Out 2 comes mesmerizingly close to the achievements of its predecessor.\n\nRiley is a teenager now and the red Puberty button that was introduced towards the end of Inside Out wreaks havoc in her brain as new emotions start popping up – Anxiety, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment. The screenplay by Meg LeFauve retains the structure of the first movie, where Joy finds itself out of the Headquarters, this time in company with the original core emotions, as Anxiety takes control of Riley’s life, going ahead with the best of intentions, plaguing her mind with overthought ideas, challenging her sense of self, and taking her away from her friends to bond with new, fancier girls, ripping apart the comfort of the present to preserve what Envy is convinced will bear fruits in the future.\n\nLike the first movie, this one too is decorated with fascinating ideas that find their roots in human psychology but are manifested here into picturesque visuals that will enchant the young audience and compel the older viewers to think about the gravity of these moments longer after the end credits roll. There is a Personality Tree, Stream of Consciousness, and the withering canyon that breaks down each time Riley uses a sarcastic tone.\n\nWith the new set of emotions at play now, Inside Out 2 seems to be catering to a wider audience. The complexity of emotions, the screenplay’s ability to be more inventive in a terrific joke around a Dora – The Explorer-esque character, and a superhero with the most futile superpower, the movie touches upon emotional challenges that humans struggle with well into their adulthood, giving Inside Out 2 an outreach way beyond the first installments.\n\nIn a scene later in the movie, Inside Out 2 gives us a strong example of an anxiety attack, and to see how the makers depict it visually in Riley’s head is both remarkable and important. Inside Out 2, in classic Disney style of storytelling, has an important message in its final act, one that felt especially poignant at thirty, when you are expected to be in control of your life but are almost always in shambles.\n\nThis movie is remarkably entertaining, and leaves you with a sense of calm, like a soft touch of love by someone you care for telling you “Hey, it’s okay. I know life’s tough. But we’ll find a way.” But as I wheeled out of the movie theater, I was taken more by how important this movie is in the late-capitalist world where the individual is a slave to the market, and defined by their emotions.\n\nInside Out 2 is one of those Disney-Pixar movies that transcends beyond the target audience it is made for, a quality that unifies some of the best animated movies in the last decade, adding to the list of incredible films like Coco, Encanto, Up and Zootopia to name a few. Inside Out 2 is a winner all the way and one of the best sequels in a long time.\n\nAmar Singh Chamkila is an interesting film. It is as much a story of the titular Chamkila as it is of its filmmaker Imtiaz Ali, as much a story of 1980s Panjab as it is of modern-day India, and as much a story of casteism as it is of censorship. Most of these – especially the latter – do not make sense together, and yet under Ali, the story of the Panjabi singer finds a political voice missing from Ali’s filmography hitherto.\n\nThe story of Amar Singh Chamkila is inherently political in nature (like every other story in this world, one might argue). It is impossible to ignore the politics in the rise and fall of this maverick singer. But unlike in movies like Rockstar or Highway where Ali limited the political commentary to a song (‘Sadda Haq’ in Rockstar) or a dialogue (Randeep Hooda’s monologue in Highway), here he goes a step further. There has always been a reluctance in Imtiaz Ali’s cinema to confront the inherent politics of the stories he tells. Here, too, he does not go as dark and deep as other filmmakers might have, but there is a sense of ownership of the world of Chamkila, the complex, intrinsic relationship between his caste (a Dalit) and his lyrics that comes from the world he is from, the world he has seen around.\n\nIn the very first scene, we are introduced to the paradox that was Amar Singh Chamkila (Diljit Dosanjh). A wildly popular singer is murdered along with his wife Amarjot (Parineeti Chopra) minutes before a performance. The action is immediate and impactful and works because as a biopic, it makes little sense to keep the assassination a third-act reveal.\n\nWhat follows is the chronicling of Chamkila’s rise to fame by different narrators, placing the different pieces of the puzzle together. In essence, this is similar to how a journalist (Aditi Rao Haideri) tries to assemble the life of Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor) together. Here, the writing is better, the protagonist more likable, and the love story between him and Amarjot more subtle. The somber, softness of Chamkila as a person almost works as a paradox to his crude lyrics, often objectifying women. There is an honesty in him, despite the nature of his songs, that makes him likable.\n\nIt helps that Dosanjh plays him in a simplistic way that makes you find a heart in his vulgar lyrics. He instills Chamkila here with the kind of humane quality that sits right between seeing him both as a misguided young man and a martyr for art and freedom of speech. The movie makes you understand him, not root for him. All it does is show the viewers a mirror, reminding us that an artist is a product of their society, and their work a reflection of everything they see around. To ask, then, if a work of art is corrupting society is invariably calling the world that artist came and learned their craft from, corrupt.\n\nA big section of the movie tries to tackle the question of immorality, and the responsibility that an artist holds in society. But the Ali brothers problematize this debate fascinatingly with the added complication of Chamkila being a Dalit. At one point in the narrative, he refuses to sing his controversial songs and instead steers towards devotional songs. But therein appears the Shakespearean fatal flaw in Chamkila. He cannot refuse the demands of his audience. He returns to his old songs because, despite his success, he sees his listeners as his masters and turns himself into their servant. It is a dynamic rooted in the casteist history of India. Chamkila is a Dalit, and his service to his fans is deeply connected to his sense of inferiority that he secretly battles behind his loud, voracious songs.\n\nAmar Singh Chamkila is in many ways an extension of previous Ali movies, sharpening the questions films like Rockstar and Tamasha asked. It blends truth with story, and the truth-teller with storyteller. It turns the idea of art into a mythical balm in times of violence as well as a cause for violence in a turbulent society. It is a story of paradoxes that exist even today. Thankfully, the filmmaking allows the thematic chaos to penetrate the storytelling. The editing by Aarti Bajaj is especially penetrative, constantly cutting into paradoxes and parables, doing things that many previous Ali films attempted to do but failed to achieve eventually.\n\nAmar Singh Chamkila is a lot more than the return in form for Imtiaz Ali. It is a reminder of the wondrous, warped relationship an artist shares with their audience. It shows the toxicity of fandom, obsession with people-pleasing, and ultimately a society that was too broken to let its inner thoughts percolate into a song lyric, too fragile to let a man and woman survive on the fame of their songs. It is a movie of a country that was, and still does a complete disservice to its many truthtellers who exist in the garb of artists.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nEvery once in a while, comes a movie that shakes you to your core. The most common, and probably easiest way to do that is by nudging the emotional chords of the audience. To weep is to feel, and to make someone feel strongly is shaking them out of their comfort zone, these movies tend to believe. Very few attempt to take the tougher route of making the audience sit back and look at themselves, analyze their response to the hate crimes around them, by intellectual stimulation, making them realize that their greatest nightmare is true – they are more like those despicable Nazi officers than they realize. The Zone of Interest champions this delicate space, making it one of the most remarkable takes on Holocaust.\n\nFor a movie that is set in Nazi Germany during the Second World War, The Zone of Interest speaks more of our present than any movie I have seen in recent times. The violence in the movie is not apparent but subversive. It happens off camera, all we see is its aftermath – smoke from the chimneys at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, beside which a family lives harmoniously, contrasting the grim fatality of the camp to a beautiful garden, a perfect image of a happy nuclear family, not oblivious of the crude carnation happening metres away, but simply unconcerned for it.\n\nAn early scene in the movie reminded me of Steven Spielberg’s 1993 masterpiece Schindler’s List. In that movie we see Jews storing their wealth in peculiar places. The back of a teeth, loafs of bread. In The Zone of Interest we see the same remains of captured Jews reaching the families of SS officers and government officials. The very people who cannot stand the sight of a Jew accept their belongings gayly. One character even mentions that they prefer toothpastes as sometimes there are diamonds hidden in there. It is in such little details that director Jonathan Glazer paints a picture of a past that feels closer to the reality we are seeing in Palestine.\n\nIn another scene we see officials celebrating the successful running of their program, immediately reminding one of the videos viraling on social media showing Israeli soldiers celebrating the killing of innocent Palestinians. It is impossible to look at this movie without contextualizing it in our present – a present where the once victimized Jews are now the victimizer; where the same patterns are at show again, and this time around we are that family living on the greener side of the land.\n\nThere is another story in The Zone of Interest. One that runs with the screen turned black, aided only by a harrowing score by Mica Levi. The harrowing score narrates the story that we do not see. The truth of the other side of the beautiful world we see in the movie. It is a reminder of how we have turned the eye against the ongoing violence. The discomfort of knowing the truth but not see it – a reality of blackened indifference we opt in real life that becomes a harrowing experience in the movie.\n\nThe Zone of Interest ends with a fascinating teleportation to the present where we see the Auschwitz camp being turned into a museum, honouring the memory of those the characters in the movie have forgotten and are taking every step to erase. It is an ending that reminds you that the imprint of our fatal indifference will outlive us. That history will remember us for our indifference. Always.\n\nWe are back on Arrakis, the desert planet where Herbert’s iconic sci-fi novel Dune is set in. Under the close inspection of Denis Villeneuve, cinematographer Greg Fraiser, composer Hans Zimmer and actors like Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Florence amongst others, the promise of a stunning visual treat is almost a guarantee as you sit for the 166-minutes long saga, but this time around there is more to our trip to Arrakis than its visual appeal.\n\nIn the first part, Villeneuve invested a lot in exposition, leaving me disappointed by how patchy and inconsequential the runtime felt. After all, the 1965 novel is on paper a simple telling of the most classical story of a Chosen One becoming the leader of a tribe plagued by foreign invasion. We already have James Cameron’s expansive Avatar series that explores similar themes. Then why should we care for another story that essentially follows the same beat?\n\nThe answer lies in Part Two. One where Villeneuve purposefully diverts from the trajectory of the novel to dig deeper and into more fascinating terrains. The second part starts almost exactly where we left these characters in 2021. Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Ferguson) are travelling with the Fremen tribe of Sietch Tabr. Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul is the prophetic One who would save the Fremen from the colonizers. It is the kind of belief that goes unchallenged in the original novel.\n\nHere, though, Chani (Zendaya), who also happens to fall in love with Paul through the movie’s runtime, stands as the ideological contradiction to Stilgar and everyone else who sees Paul as the prophetic hero. It immediately heightens the conflict, elevating the movie from a mere visual masterpiece to an accomplishment in writing.\n\nThe movie uses Chani’s stand-point as a tether for the audience to notice the crumbling of Paul’s character under the burden of his newfound responsibility, and especially the increasing antagonism of Lady Jessica who almost lets go of her role as Paul’s mother under the more powerful responsibilities of Reverend Mother. This lends the movie towards a conflict that feels far more urgent and impactful than the prophetic war that you know the result of by now if you have seen or ready anything following such a classic template.\n\nThe romance between Paul and Chani becomes the core of the movie, from where every other conflict is amplified. It helps that Chalamet and Zendaya do not miss a beat, especially Chalamet who delivers a powerful performance as a young man taking more responsibility than he was ready for.\n\nDune: Part Two is, however, far from perfect and continues to suffer from its problem of a proper antagonist. Austin Butler is ruthless as Feyd-Rautha, but the movie does not spend enough time with him for his final scene in the movie to carry the desired impact. I wished a lot more of him and his world. It would have helped the final twenty minutes from being very good to truly mind-blowing.\n\nVilleneuve, though, clearly rests on his ability to capture visuals to blow the mind of his audience. The world of Dune: Part Two feels real in an almost surreal way. In the age of CGI where every MCU movie makes the most incredible, unimaginable visual seem real, this movie makes everything a lot more lived-in. It almost outdoes what the first part did, visually.\n\nWith the second part Villeneuve has concluded the story of the first novel, but the movie does enough to keep you promised and anticipated for a third part. It is in equal part a celebration of the original Dune novel and a diversion from it; a love-story as well as a cautionary tale on hero-worship and what the title of a hero – a messiah – does to the person bestowed with it.\n\nThere is something about festivals that amplifies the loneliness of your heart. In Sriram Raghavan’s dazzling new movie Merry Christmas, this core idea of loneliness becomes an impregnable presence as we track two characters and their loneliness over a period of a little over twelve hours.\n\nIn typical Raghavan fashion, the movie is a delicious delight for a cinephile, tattered with easter eggs, references to old Indian and Western classics, and a background score that makes it all appear like a Broadway play. We start with Albert (Vijay Sethupathi), who claims to have returned to Mumbai after seven years. He tells Maria (Katrina Kaif) that he was in Dubai all these years, having met her and her daughter first in a restaurant and then at Regal, watching Pinnochio. Maria is a single mother, who almost immediately forms a bond with Albert, the kind of connection you wait and wish for all your life, but stumble upon only once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nThe recipe for a romance is set, and Raghavan designs the first act of his movie as a beautiful, dream-like romance. The chance encounter of two lonely people in a city of millions, a few drinks, a tantalizing set-piece where the two spring into an impromptu dance, an elevator kiss, and you’re sucked in the world of Albert and Maria.\n\nUnlike earlier Raghavan directorial, where the greyness of the characters was introduced to us as a matter-of-fact reality, in Merry Christmas the movie tasks us to see these two as simple beings in a crowded yet lonely world, relish in their innocent, young romance. You want them to be happy, to have a happy ending. But this is a Sriram Raghavan movie, the Christmas cannot be as merry as the title of the movie suggests.\n\nA dead body, another suitor, and a police officer for an eye for detail crowd the scene as the plot thickens. But Raghavan remains true to what his intentions are here. Unlike the brilliantly conceived Andhadhun, Merry Christmas is less about the crime and more about the criminal – no, that makes it sound like Badlapur – it is less about the criminal and more about the arc of redemption of the human being behind that criminal.\n\nThis is basically what you would get if Raghavan directed Hulu’s popular show Only Murders in the Building. Like that show where a murder becomes the basis for the writers to explore the loneliness of its three primary characters, Raghavan and his writers use the presence of a dead body here to do more than tell a suspenseful whodunit.\n\nInstead, the movie is a character study, more than anything else. It is a narrative based on choice, and its eventual implications. Just how in Before Sunrise Celine (Julie Delpy) decides to disembark and spend time with Jesse (Ethan Hawke), Albert’s choice to spend a few hours with Maria has a ripple effect that is far beyond what he could have imagined.\n\nThe movie tries to find truth in their deceptions (at one point Albert retracts his Dubai story to say he came from Nasik), but also refuses to give us the comfort of a parallel, more trustworthy narrative. We have to trust these bunch of untrustworthy characters, and navigate our way. It makes for a delicious mystery, one where the audience is left in a free-flow, to decide who they trust, and who they root for.\n\nIt helps that the performances remain consistently top-notch. I have never seen such long, undisturbed moments of Kaif’s close-up as she delivers a dialogue, and ace it to the tee. This is a masterful performance by Kaif, one that serves as a timely reminder that there is more to her than what a Spy Universe asks her to be. Vijay Sethupathi is reliably solid, his eyes constantly reeking of an ache the source of which you are never too sure of.\n\nThere is also a constant artistic brilliance at show here, nothing more spectacular as the final few minutes where everything is conveyed without the use of a single dialogue (another moment where I was reminded of Only Murders in the Building).\n\nMerry Christmas might not be the twisty narrative that Andhadhun offered, but it is always nice to see a director experimenting after a success than becoming a prisoner of a tried formula. This is Sriram Raghavan in total control of his power as a storyteller, teasing us into baits of romance, and murder, before encapsulating it all into a study of crime, criminals, and loneliness.ur\n\nKho Gaye Hum Kahaan is an addition to a list of movies written by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti that are titled from a phrase used in a song in an earlier movie produced by Excel Entertainment. These titles re-imagine the phrases, expanding on the depth they carry and build it into a legacy of their own. So-much-so, that after a point you forget that you first heard ‘zindagi milegi na dobara’ in the title track of Rock On! and ‘dil dhadakne do’ in a song from Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Kho Gaye Hum Kahaan takes its title from a song from the forgettable Baar Baar Dekho (also named after a song from the 1962 China Town, a movie titled reused years later in a Kareena Kapoor Khan-starrer…. sorry, I’m digressing). In that movie, the phrase was used romantically, placed with visuals of two people falling in love as they grew old together. In the Arjun Vairan Singh directorial, the term assumes a deeper meaning, hinting at the addictive relationship the urban young of our country share with social media.\n\nDespite being a movie that often comes with a holier-than-thou attitude, Kho Gaye Hum Kahaan is quite an earnest, empathetic movie. The story follows three childhood friends, Imaad (Siddhanth Chaturvedi) is a stand-up comic, Neil (Adarsh Gourav) is a gym trainer and Ahana (Ananya Panday) is an MBA working at an MNC. She and Imaad are cohabitating, the former is quite regular on dating apps, indulging in swift, harmless flings while Ahana is in a seemingly solid relationship.\n\nWriters Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti use these three characters and their uber Bandra-esque setting to explore the toxic dynamic the youth shares with social media. The most convincing of the lot is Ahana, who after being dumped uses social media to make her ex-boyfriend jealous, faking a happier, hotter life simply to grab the attention of the man who distanced himself from her.\n\nImaad uses jokes as a coping mechanism, and non-serious relationships to mask the darkest secret of his past. In that sense, his entire life feels like a social media profile. He is not addicted to social media, he has turned his real life into one. Neil is the aspirational one here, wanting to make it big and using social media both, as a means of upping his professional game and also, at an important point in the movie, using it to channelize the most ridiculous side of himself that social media makes easier for anyone to show off.\n\nIn a world of violence, patriotism and hyper-masculinity, Kho Gaye Hum Kahaan is a breath of fresh air. It is both a nostalgic piece (reminding you of Akhtar-sibling classics like Dil Chahta Hai and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara) and also a timely, largely intelligent commentary on Gen Z.\n\nIt helps that the performances are quite strong here. Adarsh Gourav continues his solid run of form in 2023, while Siddhanth Chaturvedi’s Imaad is a reminder of the kind of prowess he holds as an artist. But the surprise package here is Ananya Panday, standing tall in front of two terrific performers. Her Ahana is vulnerable, vehement, stupid but also real, which ultimately makes you want to be with her through the runtime of the movie. The character, much like Panday’s character in Gehraiyaan, feels like an extension of herself. But maybe we need to recognize the quality of her performance here and not find excuses to shroud a deservingly good performance.\n\nKho Gaye Hum Kahaan lacks the universality of the earlier friendship-trio movies that have come out of Excel Entertainment, and can get preachy (and it does not have the privilege of Javed Akhrar’s poetry that a Zindagi… had), but the movie does a lot of what recent movies, including Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies could’t do, give us characters we understand, empathize with and end up loving with all their flaws intact.\n\nNow Streaming on Netflix\n\nIf you look at Rajkumar Hirani’s filmography, Dunki was bound to happen. For years now he has been treading the tricky path of blending comedy with social issues. At its peak it gave us a movie like 3 Idiots and P.K., and at its low we got Sanju, that picked the wrong story for a right social issue (or vice versa). In his sixth movie in twenty years, Hirani fumbles with this blend, sacrificing an important story on the altar of the Rajkumar Hirani Template.\n\nThe problem with Dunki start early. In its first few minutes we see signs of a lethargic filmmaker getting tangled in his own glory. There is an attempt to give Dunki a 3 Idiots-esque start, a whimsical comedic sequence that leads to three friends trying to reconnect with a fourth. In 3 Idiots, the long-lost friend was Rancho (Aamir Khan), here it is Hardayal Singh Dhillon (Shahrukh Khan).\n\nWe are quickly transported to a flashback of gags, where we see Hardy entering the lives of these village-dwelling dreamers who, along with Sukhi (Vicky Kaushal) want to go to London for a better life. The movie is mildly funny here, and in moments it reaches an emotional peak thanks to Kaushal’s terrific performance. But you also fear something that becomes a predestined threat in the second half.\n\nDunki makes the cardinal sin of pausing for humor. Unlike a P.K. or 3 Idiots where humor was a part of the narrative, Dunki pauses its story to fill it with gags. They are funny till you realize the movie is in service of them and not the opposite. Too much time is lost in these gags before the movie realizes that it was titled ‘Dunki’ and not ‘4 Idiots’.\n\nWhen the idea of “donkey route”, a form of illegal immigration, is introduced, the movie brushes past a daily-routine montage in an Imtiaz Ali movie that is used to convey a point before going to the real theme of the narrative. Nothing works after this. You don’t care about the characters because their motivations are not strong enough, the movie tries to hide this by one unfunny gag followed by the next. One designed around a ‘kiss’ is especially lethargic, almost cringey.\n\nThere are a few good monologues, sounding especially good in the echoing voice of Khan, but that’s too little and too late. A reverse-dunki is again infused with forced humor, where the movie once again flusters an opportunity to say something important, something poignant about the problem of illegal immigration.\n\nDunki is a case of disappointing “what-ifs”. A narrative of “what it could’ve been”. The much-awaited SRK-Hirani collaboration is a drab disappointment, one that reminds us that a director caught in their own trapping is worse than its bleakest shadow. In a year where we saw Khan reinvent himself as an action hero, we are now in need of a Rajkumar Hirani reinvention too. Hirani is not Hirani-ing like he once used to."
