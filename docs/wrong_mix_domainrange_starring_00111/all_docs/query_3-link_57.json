Vasu: From a Makeup Man’s Son to Tamil Cinema’s Legendary Director Director P. Vasu has crafted a legendary directorial career spanning over four decades in Tamil cinema. But his path to becoming one of the industry's most acclaimed filmmakers was an emotional one. As the son of a renowned makeup artist who later turned into a producer, Vasu grew up on film sets and developed a heartfelt, intuitive understanding of cinema. This deep connection fuels his signature ability to create emotionally resonating stories. If we introspect Director Vasu's style of filmmaking, he generally builds strong connections between characters that resonate deeply with audiences. Like a devoted partner caring about her mangalsutra, Director Vasu loves and cares deeply about cinema. He admires the actors in his films, studying their every expression and even nuanced movements. Vasu leverages this keen awareness to bring out their best on-screen and craft emotionally captivating films which suits the actor’s calibre. This rare directorial quality allows him to make audiences feel every sentiment powerfully. Director P. Vasu’s immense success continued through the 90s as he perfected his skill of storytelling straight from the heart through commercial blockbusters like Panakkaran (1990), Nadigan (1990), Chinna Thambi (1991), Mannan (1992), Walter Vetrivel (1993) and Sethupathi IPS (1994). But his career reached even greater heights after directing the 2004 blockbuster Apthamitra, which showcased his cinematic marvel. This set the stage for his biggest triumph - the 2005 historic phenomenon Chandramukhi starring Rajinikanth. Chandramukhi was a landmark film in Director Vasu’s career and in Tamil cinema history, running for over 800 days. Despite decades of experience, Vasu still approaches each film with the energy and intimacy of a young filmmaker who's just starting out. His passion for bringing characters to life is evident through the rapport he develops with actors. Those who have worked with Director Vasu often describe how he fully immerses himself into a character's world when guiding performances on set. For Chandramukhi, P. Vasu would demonstrate Chandramukhi's fierce expressions with intense authenticity to help actors grasp the essence of the role. Actors were often amazed by the lengths Vasu goes when sharing his creative vision. This willingness is the key behind enabling exceptional performances out of Vasu’s star cast. Now, 18 years later, he is set to revive the Chandramukhi magic and ascend even higher directorial peaks with the hugely awaited Chandramukhi 2…\n\nRaghava Lawrence: Background Dancer in P. Vasu's Films to Vettaiyan Raja in Chandramukhi Raghava Lawrence is a perfect example showcasing the power of perseverance and hard work to achieve one's dreams. His story with acclaimed director P. Vasu illustrates this. In Director Vasu’s early films, Raghava Lawrence used to be a background dancer relegated to the 4th row. But through sheer determination and grit, he slowly progressed to the 3rd, then 2nd, and finally the coveted 1st row of dancers. Back then, Raghava Lawrence’s goal was simply to make it to the front. But he did not stop there. With relentless effort, Raghava Lawrence went from being a background dancer to dance master in Vasu’s films. He then dared to dream bigger - becoming an actor himself and even directing movies. His step-by-step journey required tremendous patience and hard work. Today, Lawrence Master stands not just as a leading man but one of the larger than life stars in Tamil cinema. His collaboration with Director Vasu has come full circle, as he essayed a pivotal character in the director’s recent film Shivalinga. For the man who started in the shadows, it is no small feat to share top billing with Director P. Vasu. Now, Lawrence master portrays the pivotal character Vettaiyan in the hugely anticipated sequel Chandramukhi 2. As someone who began as a 4th row dancer, to being handpicked by Legendary Director Vasu for the biggest film of Vasu’s career too is truly an incredible success story. And Raghava Lawrence stands as a testament that hard work can make your dreams a reality. He sets an inspiring example that by working hard, it can truly take you places. His perseverance also reveals the heights one can reach with focus and grit. Rajadhi raja, Raja ghambira, Raja marthanda, Raja kula thilagaa... Vettaiyan Raja paraak paraak paraak!! 🕴️\n\nFrom Passion to Building a Legacy: Lyca Productions Journey Tamil cinema has traditionally revolved around leading actors and directors. It has mostly been Superstars and Star Directors who have dominated the spotlight. While their fame rises and falls, production houses have a rare opportunity to build an enduring legacy. Only a select few, like AVM Productions and Gemini Circuits, have cemented their status over decades. But in recent times, with their presence having been waned, it has left a void for a new house to emerge and build a reputed name in every household of Tamil Nadu. Lyca Productions is one such banner that was born from a place of pure passion for Tamil cinema. Founded by ardent cinema enthusiast Subaskaran Allirajah, our Chairman was deeply devoted to bringing exceptional stories and breaking prevailing industry formulas. This founding drive and passion saw us back films that earned the status of classics among audiences. By combining technological innovation with cultural authenticity, we were on a mission to uplift Tamil cinema to new heights. We're also proud to claim that we were the first ones to introduce ultra-modern screening formats like 4DX, EPIQ to enhance the viewing experience for Tamil audiences. And through each film being released, we steadily etched our name into the heritage of every Tamil household. Today, having filled the void left by our veteran predecessors, we've carved our own place to stand confidently amongst the industry's most enduring names. Yet our passion burns stronger, always seeking ways to raise the bar of artistic excellence and innovation. Our vision is to build Lyca into a world-class studio on the level of major Hollywood banners like Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros., one that sets a global platform for Indian cinema. Our goal doesn't end with becoming giants of Tamil cinema, but ambassadors introducing the power of Indian storytelling to the world stage where we're open to collaborating with reputed Hollywood studios. On this journey, we also learned how absolute passion for cinema can alone transform into commercial success over time. Our story continues as we breathe new life into Tamil cinema with each new release.\n\nM.M. Keeravani's Footstep After Oscars After winning the Oscar for Best Original Song, Naatu Naatu from RRR, Keeravani's focus has now shifted to Chandramukhi-2 as his musical footsteps land on the highly anticipated sequel. Known for his forte in period dramas and grand musical scores, Keeravani is expected to deliver his excellence to this horror-comedy family drama. Industry insiders confirmed that Keeravani has scored outstanding music for Chandramukhi-2 that perfectly captures the mood of Chandramukhi and the richness of the visuals depicted in the film. \"We have no doubt that audiences are in for a treat\", they said. The first film Chandramukhi had a phenomenal hit song, Ra Ra which became synonymous with the film. And the recently released song \"Swagathaanjali\" suggests that Keeravani has delivered another chartbuster for Chandramukhi-2 that has become an instant hit among the audience. With Keeravani's background score elevating the film's scenes, especially those involving the rift between Chandramukhi and Vettaiyan Raja, Chandramukhi-2 promises to be a feast for the eyes and ears. And also with Keeravani's recent Oscar win having boosted the hype for Chandramukhi-2's music and with those who've heard \"Swagathaanjali\" already saying Keeravani is at his melodious best, Lyca Productions hopes the sweet tonics from Keeravani will help launch Chandramukhi-2 to greater heights than the prequel. Will we get another chartbuster like \"Ra Ra\" that audiences will groove to for years? The recently released \"Swagathaanjali\" suggests we very well might!\n\nLyca Productions has reached astonishing new heights in overseas distribution with the global release of Ponniyin Selvan - Part 2. Releasing Tamil films on an international scale is generally no mean feat. It requires meticulous planning, expert coordination, and flawless execution. We at Lyca Productions have been in the film distribution business for many years, but PS-2's overseas release was truly special as we decided to approach it in an entirely new way this time. PS-2 was released across the Far East, Middle East, US, Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, Europe, Singapore, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka marking a milestone and making this worldwide launch a massive achievement for a Tamil film. Our worldwide promotions included an unforgettable promotional screening event in Dubai's massive indoor ice rink, marking a first for Tamil cinema. It was truly an unforgettable experience! Additionally, PS-2 also achieved the landmark of being the first South Indian film released in 4DX format, enhancing the viewing experience for Indian cinema audiences with motion seats and special effects. With this tremendous success, we continue to open bigger doors for Tamil films internationally. The best is yet to come!"
