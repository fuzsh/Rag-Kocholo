        "text": "If there has been any doubt about the return of the television show Yellowstone, it should be put to rest. The call came out last week that the show is looking for extras to film in the Missoula and Sula areas. Now we have word there will be filming in Missoula this week.\n\nRead More: Yellowstone TV Show Hiring Extras in Missoula and Sula\n\nAccording to a press release from the city of Missoula, the streets around the Missoula County Courthouse will be closed this Friday May 24th for filming of the television show. They are letting employees and people who have business in the courthouse on that day to give yourself extra time to try to find parking and take advantage of online options.\n\nMissoula Is Suggesting People Use Online Resources\n\nThe city is also suggesting that people who need to pay their property taxes ahead of the May 31st deadline, do so online here. Vehicle renewals can also take place online at Missoula County Clerk-Treasurer. The filming will be taking place right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which means that government agencies will be closed on Monday too, so it will be a good idea to plan ahead for both the filming of the show and the upcoming holiday."
