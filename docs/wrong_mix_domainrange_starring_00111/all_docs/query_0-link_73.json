        "text": "As the Diwali festival is over, and Thugs of Hindostan starring Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan did not perform well at the box office, Bollywood is gearing up for the big upcoming releases. Two big-ticket films — Shah Rukh Khan’s Zero and Ranveer Singh’s Simmba — are hitting the theatres next month, besides Abhishek Kapoor’s Kedarnath.\n\nWhile Kedarnath starring Sara Ali Khan and Sushant Singh Rajput is releasing on December 7, SRK starrer Zero will hit the screens on December 21 and Ranveer Singh’s Simmba a week later on December 28.\n\nALSO READ| Zero trailer unleashes the deluge of memes featuring SRK, Katrina, Anushka\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trailer of the SRK’s Zero was released on his birthday and got mixed response from critics and audience. In the trailer, the film sums up a love triangle involving a dwarf, a paralysed scientist and an alcoholic film star.\n\nHere is the trailer.\n\nNext up is Ranveer Singh’s Simmba, an action thriller directed by Rohit Shetty. This will be the second film of Sara Ali Khan, daughter of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh. While the trailer is yet to arrive, the makers of the film have already released a few behind-the-scenes video and pictures of a party song from the film which will also have Golmaal boys.\n\nHere are the post shared by the director and lead actors of the film.\n\nREAD MORE| Golmaal boys spread madness in Ranveer Singh’s Simmba new song\n\nWill both films be shown at the same time or Simmba makers will push the release date to 2019?\n\nTrade analyst and Film critic Taran Adarsh is certain that the two films can co-exist at the box office. He took to social media and wrote, “#Christmas is a lucrative period for films worldwide… The prolonged holiday period – #Christmas and #NewYear – will begin from 21 Dec [Fri] evening onwards, right till 2 Jan [Wed]… In my opinion, two films can easily coexist, if strong in merits… #Zero #Simmba.”"
