        "text": "What is love? I was blessed with the opportunity to visit Everest Base camp last month. While the journey and the physical challenge associated with it calls for a separate post, this post is about a couple in their fifties who were there on the journey with me. Right from the start, we unfortunately found that the couple, especially the wife, found the task overwhelming and couldn’t keep up with the group. When the trek would end every day, the couple would find themselves a couple of hours behind the group. The guides tried to salvage the situation by splitting the group and starting the trek for the couple an hour earlier each day. The thing with the mountains is with each ascending step, the oxygen in the air slowly reduces and finally near the Everest Base camp, the oxygen is at a measly 50% of the oxygen at sea levels. Added to this is the relentless uphill trek, never-ending steps, narrow pathways, steep boulders, and the cruelty of the weather gods in the form of wind, snow or just the biting cold you encounter on the way. Finally, the D-Day came, and we found ourselves reach the Base camp. As we as a group were hugging and congratulating each other, we noticed that the couple had not reached. The wife could not carry on with the steep ascent and jumping along boulders associated with the final stretch and finally given in. The Husband who was considerably fitter than her and an avid trekker himself could have carried on but decided to stop for her. On my way back from the Base camp, I met them along the way. The couple with curiosity in their eyes asked me how the camp was. I told them it was just a rock with a zillion people fighting for a picture beside it and I am sure the weeklong journey was more important than the fleeting moments in the destination. Now, why is this adventure post introduced as a post on love. Well, imagine doing a weeklong marathon and being so, so close to the goal line. But you need to stop because your partner just can’t take it anymore. Love may have many shades and meaning but isn’t one of the most pivotal one, the act of sacrifice? You walk, I walk! You Jump, I jump! You stop, I stop! #love"
