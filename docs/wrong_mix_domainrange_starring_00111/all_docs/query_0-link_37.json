        "text": "Nine Queens (115 mins, 15) Directed by Fabi치n Bielinsky; starring Ricardo Darin, G치ston Pauls\n\nTape (86 mins, 15) Directed by Richard Linklater; starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Robert Sean Leonard\n\nDevdas (181 mins, PG) Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali; starring Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit\n\nBad Company (117 mins, 12) Directed by Joel Schumacher; starring Anthony Hopkins, Chris Rock\n\nScooby-Doo (86 mins, PG) Directed by Raja Gosnell; starring Freddie Prinze Jr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard\n\nResident Evil (100 mins, 15) Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson; starring Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez\n\nNine Queens is not the camp extravaganza that its title would suggest. It is, though, a supremely confident Argentine thriller that is wound as tightly as a transvestite's corset. The queens in question are priceless Weimar Republic stamps, but the seasoned conman Marcos (Ricardo Darin) is not concerned with them: he is trying to flog a sheet of forgeries to a corrupt businessman in a Buenos Aires hotel. Marcos is a seedy reservoir dog, while his accomplice Juan (G치ston Pauls) is a pup who specialises in charming his way into the purses of old women. But even Juan is not too green to think that his boss is a straight arrow. 'You're screwing me!' he bleats when the scam becomes especially tangled. 'I don't understand how and it's making me mad.'\n\nChances are you will have entertained the same suspicion, especially if you have been schooled in the cinema of David Mamet, whose films (House of Games, Heist) also imitate their duplicitous characters by pulling swindles and quadruple-crosses on the audience. The first-time director Fabi치n Bielinsky deftly handles the shifts from tomfoolery to terror as the characters graduate from selling stamps to bartering over human flesh. The picture has a good three twists too many and is saddled with a conclusion that comprehensively dispels every delicious ambiguity. But better too much ambition than none at all.\n\nThe tape in Tape is a piece of incriminating evidence, and the film itself is something like a courtroom drama relocated to a grungy Michigan motel room, where two resentful old chums - drug dealer Ethan Hawke and rising film director Robert Sean Leonard - rake over their mismanaged lives. You may smart at the idea of pretty-boy Hawke, whose twinkling eyes make Bambi look like Ernest Borgnine, playing a belching tough guy. But then the point of the picture is that the characters, including surprise witness Uma Thurman, each take turns at playing aggressor and victim, prosecutor and accused; no role is fixed, no outcome certain.\n\nEach frame of this brief film, which was shot in six days on digital video, crackles with unpredictability. Some complained that Richard Linklater's previous movie, the animated Waking Life, was heavenly to look at but hell to listen to. With Tape, which is crammed with zany camera angles and nausea-inducing whip-pans, it is the other way around. If it all gets too much, just close your eyes and savour Stephen Belber's probing dialogue, which exposes the casual bullying behind everyday small-talk.\n\nThe plush Bollywood musical, Devdas, is an overscaled love story, adapted from a cherished early-twentieth-century Indian novel. It is like being caught in a storm of sequins and silk. The plot, about the thwarted attempts of dashing Devdas (Shahrukh Khan) to make whoopee with his childhood sweetheart Paro (Aishwarya Rai), never really gets off the ground, perhaps because you cannot fathom why everyone is literally making such a song and dance about Devdas. He is a violent alcoholic narcissist with pyromaniac tendencies. And a lawyer to boot. The second half of the movie goes into a slump along with its hero, though I liked the dance routine around a bottle of Madeira. When the men get the chance to boogie, they imitate the women's jangling bangles and tinkling ankle-bells by clinking their overfull glasses. There is boozy poetry in that.\n\nBad Company teams Anthony Hopkins with the effervescent comic Chris Rock in a sorry tale of derring-do, nuclear devices in suitcases, long-lost twin brothers and eastern European mobsters. Only Rock's ad-libs hit the funnybone, while any potential for excitement in the action sequences is chased off the screen by unfortunate parallels with 11 September. Even more depressing is Hopkins, whose delivery suggests the weary exhalations of a man who has just climbed several hundred flights of stairs.\n\nThe live-action film of the cartoon series Scooby-Doo is a case of high-concept, low returns. Alongside the tiresome computer-generated mutt Scooby, the human cast give it their all with some uncanny impersonations - Matthew Lillard's beatnik Shaggy is an honest delight, skilfully observed down to the last straggly hair on his goatee, the last caught-in-the-throat yodel. Raja Gosnell is too inexperienced a director to strike the right balance between irony and euphoria. When even a chase through a toy factory leaves you yawning, you know something is awry."
