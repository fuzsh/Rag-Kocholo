        "text": "Ever since there have been movies, there have been movie stars – and becoming one of the world’s greatest actors involves being able to be many things at once. For one, you have to be able to act – to really inhabit a character’s deepest emotions, to step into their skin so that the words on the page come across as lived and felt. Plus, you have to be able to take that technical mastery and apply it across multiple genres, from quiet character dramas to epic action-packed blockbusters. And on top of that, you have to have that thing that can’t really be learned, or taught – a charisma, a command of the camera, an energy that enlivens even the most stellar script, and makes audiences flock to the multiplex in their droves.\n\nFor Empire’s February 2023 issue, we asked readers to vote for the best actors of all time – the silver-screen stars that always deliver, that have changed the game, and whose distinctive talents can never be replicated. Your votes were counted, totted up, and in the magazine – on sale Thursday 22 December, and available to order online here – we take a deep dive into the resulting list, speaking to the stars themselves, gathering tributes from the directors that worked with them, and much more. We spend a day at Nicolas Cage’s Las Vegas home for our cover story, get an acting masterclass from Tilda Swinton, have Ridley Scott waxing lyrical on the power of Joaquin Phoenix, Ang Lee paying tribute to Heath Ledger, Gina Prince-Bythewood hailing the talents of Viola Davis and much, more more.\n\nWhile you’ll find those goodies exclusively in the pages of Empire magazine – or, available to read when you sign up to the Empire members site here – we can now reveal the full 50 Greatest Actors list below, as voted for by you. And the winners, in no particular order, are…\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nNotable roles: Alonzo Harris (Training Day), Malcolm X (Malcolm X), Private Silas Trip (Glory), Troy Maxson (Fences), John Creasy (Man On Fire), Frank Lucas (American Gangster), Robert McCall (The Equalizer, The Equalizer 2)\n\nOscars won: 2 (Glory, Training Day)\n\nIconic line: “King Kong ain’t got shit on me!” (Training Day)\n\nWhen it comes to an effortless ability to command the lens, look no further. Denzel Washington is a powerhouse who packs serious gravitas and considerable charisma, in a career that encompasses icons both real and fictional – with frequent detours into muscular action territory in his team-ups with Tony Scott and Antoine Fuqua.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nNotable roles: Forrest Gump (Forrest Gump), Andrew Beckett (Philadelphia), Woody (Toy Story), Jim Lovell (Apollo 13), Captain Miller (Saving Private Ryan), Captain Phillips (Captain Phillips), Josh Baskin (Big)\n\nOscars won: 2 (Philadelphia, Forrest Gump)\n\nIconic line: \"Houston, we have a problem.\" (Apollo 13)\n\nIf you ever need to convey conviviality, Tom Hanks is your man – ever a reassuring presence on screen, even in films where death seems the likeliest outcome. From disaster movies, to sweeping historical epics, the spirit of American optimism can almost always be found in the work of Hanks; we all have a friend in him.\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nNotable roles: Rose Loomis (Niagara), Lorelei Lee (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), Pola Debevoise (How to Marry a Millionaire), The Girl (The Seven Year Itch), Sugar \"Kane\" Kowalczyk (Some Like It Hot), Roslyn Tabor (The Misfits)\n\nOscars won: 0\n\nIconic line: \"I wanna be loved by you, alone… Boop-boop-a-doop!\" (Some Like It Hot)\n\nA true movie star, in every sense, Marilyn Monroe's earth-shattering fame sometimes threatened to overshadow everything else – but beneath the ‘blonde bombshell’ sex symbol was the heart of a true artist, who was comfortable with her sexuality and femininity and used it to brilliant ends, in comedies and dramas.\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nNotable roles: Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver), Jake LaMotta (Raging Bull), Vito Corleone (The Godfather Part II), Jimmy The Gent (GoodFellas), Neil McCauley (Heat), Sam ‘Ace’ Rothstein (Casino), Al Capone (The Untouchables), Frank ‘The Irishman’ Sheeran (The Irishman)\n\nOscars won: 2 (The Godfather Part II, Raging Bull)\n\nIconic line: “You talkin’ to me?” (Taxi Driver)\n\nPerpetual muse of Martin Scorsese, cinema’s go-to gangster, and a consummate character actor – somehow, Robert De Niro always disappears into roles while also infusing each one with his own unmistakable persona, in a career spanning into its seventh decade.\n\nBette Davis\n\nNotable roles: Margo Channing (All About Eve), Julie Marsden (Jezebel), Leslie Crosby (The Letter), Charlotte Vale (Now, Voyager), Baby Jane Hudson (What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?), Mildred Rogers (Of Human Bondage)\n\nOscars won: 2 (Jezebel, Dangerous)\n\nIconic line: “Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night.” (All About Eve)\n\nSeldom has an actor emanated so much force on-screen: Bette Davis was a cinematic cyclone, sweeping through scenes, leaving co-stars dazed and debris in her wake. She took on one complex role after another, not caring if the characters were unlikeable, and aced them all. Her work still bites today.\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nNotable roles: Nina Sayers (Black Swan), Jackie Kennedy (Jackie), Padmé Amidala (Star Wars: Episodes I-III), Mathilda (Lèon: The Professional), Lena (Annihilation), Jane Foster (The MCU), Celeste (Vox Lux), Evey (V For Vendetta)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Black Swan)\n\nIconic line: “I just want to be perfect.” (Black Swan)\n\nTaking psychological scalpels to her characters and laying their souls bare, Natalie Portman emerged from riveting child performances and a pivotal role in Star Wars’ prequel trilogy to become a towering talent who frequently collaborates with boundary-pushing directors.\n\nGene Hackman\n\nNotable roles: Jimmy ‘Popeye’ Doyle (The French Connection), Harry Caul (The Conversation), Buck Barrow (Bonnie And Clyde), Lex Luthor (Superman, Superman II, Superman IV), Sheriff Bill Daggett (Unforgiven), Royal Tenenbaum (The Royal Tenenbaums)\n\nOscars won: 2 (The French Connection, Unforgiven)\n\nIconic line: “I’m not afraid of death, but I am afraid of murder.” (The Conversation)\n\nA stalwart of ‘70s cinema known for his versatility and toughness – Gene Hackman is a leading man with everyman looks who could slip between Oscar-winning dramas, wacky comedies, and rollicking B-movies.\n\nHeath Ledger\n\nNotable roles: The Joker (The Dark Knight), Ennis Del Mar (Brokeback Mountain), Patrick Verona (10 Things I Hate About You), William Thatcher (A Knight’s Tale), Ned Kelly (Ned Kelly), Skip (Lords of Dogtown).\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Dark Knight)\n\nIconic line: “You wanna know how I got these scars?” (The Dark Knight)\n\nA stellar romantic lead who radiated warmth and benevolence became a knockout performer in his later years – Heath Ledger brought real heart to unspeakable heartache, and sheer animalistic ferocity to one of the defining cinematic villains of the 21st Century.\n\nKatharine Hepburn\n\nNotable roles: Alice Adams (Alice Adams), Susan Vance (Bringing Up Baby), Tracy Lord (The Philadelphia Story), Tess Harding (Woman Of The Year), Rose Sayer (The African Queen), Christina Drayton (Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner)\n\nOscars won: 4 (Morning Glory, Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner, The Lion In Winter, On Golden Pond)\n\nIconic line: “Put me in your pocket, Mike.” (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nPerhaps the most famous female star of Hollywood’s golden age, sometimes referred to as the ‘First Lady’ of cinema. Katharine Hepburn's distinctive accent, incredible cheekbones, revolutionary taste for slacks over dresses, and knack for playing strong, independent, witty women made her an enduring icon.\n\nTom Cruise\n\nNotable roles: Ethan Hunt (Mission: Impossible), Pete ‘Maverick’ Mitchell (Top Gun, Top Gun: Maverick), Lt. Daniel Kaffee (A Few Good Men), Jerry Maguire (Jerry Maguire), Frank T.J. Mackey (Magnolia), Charlie Babbitt (Rain Man), Major William Cage (Edge Of Tomorrow)\n\nOscars won: 0 (3 nominations)\n\nIconic line: “I feel the need… The need for speed.” (Top Gun)\n\nThe all-American epitome of a Hollywood Movie Star, intensity and dedication have been the hallmarks of Tom Cruise's career as ultimate contemporary A-lister: whether in his early, compelling character dramas, or his mind-boggling, adrenaline-pumping, stunt-tastic action flicks.\n\nRead Empire's list of Tom Cruise's 10 Best Movies Ranked.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nNotable roles: Jack Dawson (Titanic), Dom Cobb (Inception), Billy Costigan (The Departed), Jordan Belfort (The Wolf Of Wall Street), Hugh Glass (The Revenant), Rick Dalton (Once Upon A Time In Hollywood), Romeo Montague (Romeo + Juliet)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Revenant)\n\nIconic line: “I’m the king of the woooooorld!” (Titanic)\n\nThe definitive ‘90s teen heartthrob became an actor who’ll go to the ends of the earth (often literally) to get under his characters’ skin. The go-to guy for some of the world’s biggest directors (including Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino), he’s effortless style meets undeniable substance.\n\nTilda Swinton\n\nNotable roles: Orlando (Orlando), Eva Khatchadourian (We Need To Talk About Kevin), Emma Recchi (I Am Love), Rosalind (The Souvenir, The Souvenir Part II), Karen Crowder (Michael Clayton), Lucy Mirando (Okja),The White Witch (The Chronicles Of Narnia)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Michael Clayton)\n\nIconic line: “Same person. No difference at all. Just a different sex.” (Orlando)\n\nWith an ethereality bordering on the extra-terrestrial, few have the unpindownable presence of Tilda Swinton. A regular collaborator of arthouse and indie legends – from Bong Joon-ho and Luca Guadagnino, to Wes Anderson and Joanna Hogg – she’s a master at playing otherworldliness, archness, but also quietly shattering humanity.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson\n\nMost notable roles: Jules Winnfield (Pulp Fiction), Ordell (Jackie Brown), Major Marquis Warren (The Hateful Eight), Mace Windu (Star Wars: Episodes I-III), Nick Fury (The MCU), Frozone (The Incredibles, Incredibles 2), Ray Arnold (Jurassic Park)\n\nOscars won: Honorary award\n\nIconic line: “Say ‘What’ again. I dare you. I double dare you, motherfucker! Say ‘What’ one more goddamn time!” (Pulp Fiction)\n\nWhen you absolutely, positively need to cast the coolest guy in the movie, accept no substitutes. Straddling several of the biggest franchises of all time while consistently delivering career-best work in his multiple-decade-spanning collaborations with Quentin Tarantino, he’s a cultural icon as much as an actor.\n\nToshiro Mifune\n\nNotable roles: Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Yojimbo), Kikuchiyo (Seven Samurai), Taketoki Washizu (Throne Of Blood), Kingo Gondo (High And Low), Sanjuro Tsubaki (Sanjuro), Dr. Kyojô Niide (Red Beard), Miyamoto Musashi (Samurai Trilogy), Tajômaru (Rashomon)\n\nOscars won: 0\n\nIconic line: “Use your balls, if you’ve got any!” (Seven Samurai)\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s right-hand man has a strong claim to the title of coolest man who ever lived. But while he was a ‘50s icon off-screen, he shapeshifted into roles as samurai or outlaws on screen, abandoning vanity for committed performance. A role model for action men everywhere.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nNotable roles: H.I. McDunnough (Raising Arizona), Ronny Cammareri (Moonstruck), Sailor Ripley (Wild at Heart), Ben Sanderson (Leaving Las Vegas), Stanley Goodspeed (The Rock), Cameron Poe (Con Air), Castor Troy (Face/Off) Charlie/Donald Kaufman (Adaptation), Red Miller (Mandy), Rob Feld (Pig)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Leaving Las Vegas)\n\nIconic line: “Put the bunny back in the box.” (Con Air)\n\nAn acting style so unique, it could be its own genre. Nicolas Cage’s mystical, shamanastic-driven performances often involve a lot of shouting — but write him off at your peril. Despite being a major internet meme source, he remains an incredibly prolific and versatile actor, just as comfortable being an action hero as he is producing restrained turns in thoughtful indie dramas.\n\nHumphrey Bogart\n\nNotable roles: Rick Blaine (Casablanca), Philip Marlowe (The Big Sleep), Frank McCloud (Key Largo), Charlie Allnutt (The African Queen), Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon), Duke Mantee (The Petrified Forest), Harry Dawes (The Barefoot Contessa), Roy Earle (High Sierra), Harry 'Steve' Morgan (To Have And Have Not)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The African Queen)\n\nIconic line: “Here’s lookin’ at you, kid” (Casablanca)\n\nThe thing about Bogart is that his “iconic line” is basically every line he ever said. His laconic, tough-guy energy gave every line a spin of cool defiance that screenwriters rose to match. He wasn’t the tallest, strongest, or most handsome, and at times he barely seemed to move – but you could never take your eyes off him.\n\nViola Davis\n\nNotable roles: Rose Maxson (Fences), Veronica (Widows), Ma Rainey (Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom), Nanisca (The Woman King), Aibileen Clark (The Help), Mrs Miller (Doubt), Amanda Waller (The DCEU), Michelle Obama (The First Lady), Annalise Keating (How To Get Away With Murder)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Fences)\n\nIconic line: “To be a warrior, you must kill your tears.” (The Woman King)\n\nA performer who never fails to stir up the most intense of emotions – fear, empathy and awe, to name a few. As at home in comic-book blockbusters, compelling murder-mysteries and all-out action epics as she is in award-winning dramas and her regular collaborations with Denzel Washington.\n\nCate Blanchett\n\nNotable roles: Elizabeth I (Elizabeth), Meredith Logue (The Talented Mr. Ripley), Galadriel (The Lord Of The Rings), Katharine Hepburn (The Aviator), Jude (I’m Not There), Jasmine (Blue Jasmine), Carol Aird (Carol), Hela (Thor: Ragnarok), Dr. Lilith Ritter (Nightmare Alley), Lydia Tár (TÁR)\n\nOscars won: 2 (The Aviator, Blue Jasmine)\n\nIconic line: “Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.” (The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring)\n\nWith an incomparable screen presence and range as wide as it gets, Cate Blanchett is unstoppable. She made her name playing iconic women from both history and fantasy, before getting under the skin of some of cinema’s most challenging characters. Plus, with cameos and comic-book villain roles under her belt, she’s not afraid to have some fun, too.\n\nMarlon Brando\n\nNotable roles: Stanley Kowalski (A Streetcar Named Desire), Terry Malloy (On The Waterfront), Vito Corleone (The Godfather), Colonel Kurtz (Apocalypse Now), Jor-El (Superman: The Movie)\n\nOscars won: 2 (On The Waterfront, The Godfather)\n\nIconic line: “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse.” (The Godfather)\n\nAmong the most influential screen actors of all-time, Brando hit Hollywood like a hammer in the early 1950s – fundamentally changing the definition of “good” acting, and with it films themselves. Brando’s deeply-felt naturalism was magnetic, and his power undeniable. All his famous difficulty was worth it for the magic he created.\n\nAlec Guinness\n\nNotable roles: The entire D’Ascoyne family (Kind Hearts And Coronets), Colonel Nicholson (The Bridge On The River Kwai), Prince Faisal (Lawrence Of Arabia), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Star Wars)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Bridge On The River Kwai)\n\nIconic line: “Use the Force, Luke.” (Star Wars)\n\nAn unfussy, immensely talented actor of the British old school, Guinness was comfortable across the gamut from light comedy (The Man In The White Suit) to deadly serious drama (Kwai). He effortlessly developed from young matinee idol to established character actor to elder statesman. Even what he saw as a throwaway “wizard” role in a kids' film in his 60s proved rather popular.\n\nMichael Caine\n\nNotable roles: Jack Carter (Get Carter), Alfie Cartwright (Alfie), Peachy Carnehan (The Man Who Would Be King), Harry Palmer (The Ipcress File), Charlie Croker (The Italian Job), Ebenezer Scrooge (The Muppet Christmas Carol), Jasper Palmer (Children Of Men)\n\nOscars won: 2 (Hannah And Her Sisters, The Cider House Rules)\n\nIconic line: “You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!” (The Italian Job)\n\nThe genial gent from the East End wrote the book on acting, literally, publishing a tome packed with practical tips (“When speaking to an actor off-camera, look into one eye and stick with it”). But there’s nothing by-the-book about his performances – melancholy, hilarious, spiky or charming. Who else could hold their own against Sean Connery, Steve Martin and Kermit the Frog?\n\nMichelle Yeoh\n\nNotable roles: Yang Chien-Hua (Police Story 3: Supercop), Yu Shu Lien (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), Mameha (Memoirs Of A Geisha), Eleanor Young (Crazy Rich Asians), Evelyn Wang (Everything Everywhere All At Once)\n\nOscars won: 0\n\nIconic line: \"Of all the places I could be, I just want to be here with you.\" (Everything Everywhere All At Once)\n\nWho else on Earth can pull off intense dramatic scenes and do acrobatic feats that steal the show from Jackie Chan? A true marvel, she’s finally getting her global dues this year thanks to a certain multiverse movie, but has been killing it for decades. Now in her 60s, it feels like she’s only just getting started.\n\nTom Hardy\n\nNotable roles: Max Rockatansky (Mad Max: Fury Road), Bane (The Dark Knight Rises), Reggie/Ronnie Kray (Legend), Eames (Inception), Tommy Conlon (Warrior), Eddie Brock (Venom), Alfie Solomons (Peaky Blinders), Charles Bronson (Bronson)\n\nOscars won: 0 (1 nomination)\n\nIconic line: \"It would be extremely painful... for you.” (The Dark Knight Rises)\n\nWhile once defined by his MySpace page and his (supposed) resemblance to Patrick Stewart (Star Trek Nemesis), Tom Hardy has become one of the most distinctive performers of his generation. Respect him for his dual Krays, fear him for Charles Bronson, but love him for Peaky's inimitable Alfie Solomons.\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nNotable roles: Ninotchka (Ninotchka), Christina (Queen Christina), Gruinskaya (Grand Hotel), Felicitas (Flesh And The Devil), Anna Karenina (Anna Karenina), Anna Christie (Anna Christie), Elizabeth Dohna (The Saga of Gösta Berling)\n\nOscars won: 0 (3 nominations)\n\nIconic line: “I want to be alone” (Grand Hotel)\n\nGarbo came to Hollywood already a star, and left a megastar. Specialising in powerful, remote women, Garbo could also be extremely funny (Ninotchka) and play a compelling romance (Camille). As the only person who didn’t take her stardom seriously, she played studio moguls at their own game and walked away on her own terms.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman\n\nNotable roles: Scotty J (Boogie Nights), Phil Parma (Magnolia), Lester Bangs (Almost Famous), Lancaster Dodd (The Master), Allen (Happiness), Truman Capote (Capote), Caden Cotard (Synecdoche, New York), Freddie Miles (The Talented Mr Ripley), Owen Davian (Mission: Impossible: III)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Capote)\n\nIconic line: “The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you’re uncool.” (Almost Famous)\n\nFormidable whether he was playing insecure husks or intimidating villains, Hoffman had a presence like no one else, always adding supremely charismatic heft. And he had so much more to give: his premature death was a tragedy for cinema.\n\nJack Nicholson\n\nNotable roles: JJ ‘Jake’ Gittes (Chinatown), Randle ‘Mac’ McMurphy (One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest), Jack Torrance (The Shining), Jack Napier/The Joker (Batman), Colonel Nathan R. Jessup (A Few Good Men), Melvin Udall (As Good As It Gets)\n\nOscars won: 3 (One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, Terms Of Endearment, As Good As It Gets)\n\nIconic line: “Heeeeeeere’s Johnny!” (The Shining)\n\nDespite all the imitators, there’s nobody quite like Jack – nobody with such devilish charm, such easy-going menace, such mischievous playfulness. Only ever providing towering performances, he never met a scene he couldn’t steal.\n\nMeryl Streep\n\nNotable roles: Joanna Kramer (Kramer Vs. Kramer), Sophie Zawistowski (Sophie’s Choice), Miranda Priestley (The Devil Wears Prada), Florence Foster Jenkins (Florence Foster Jenkins), Donna Sheridan (Mamma Mia!)\n\nOscars won: 3 (Kramer Vs Kramer, Sophie’s Choice, The Iron Lady)\n\nIconic line: “Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.” (The Devil Wears Prada)\n\nSo dedicated, she can perform ABBA like it’s Shakespeare. Nobody brings the emotion like Meryl Streep when it comes to heavyweight dramatic material – but she can also dial up the camp when she wants to, to spectacularly playful effect.\n\nChristian Bale\n\nNotable roles: Batman (The Dark Knight Trilogy), Dicky Eklund (The Fighter), Patrick Bateman (American Psycho), Alfred Borden (The Prestige), Dick Cheney (Vice), Ken Miles (Ford v Ferrari), Trevor Reznik (The Machinist), Michael Burry (The Big Short), Jim (Empire Of The Sun)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Fighter)\n\nIconic line: “I’m into murders and executions mostly.” (American Psycho).\n\nWho knew the little boy from Empire Of The Sun would grow up to gleefully bury an axe in someone's head while bopping along to ‘Hip To Be Square’? Capable of physical transformations that boggle the mind (The Machinist, Vice), Bale has more range than a Kia Picanto.\n\nMichelle Williams\n\nNotable roles: Alma Beers del Mar (Brokeback Mountain), Cindy (Blue Valentine), Marilyn Monroe (My Week With Marilyn), Randi (Manchester By The Sea), Mitzi Fabelman (The Fabelmans)\n\nOscars won: 0 (4 nominations)\n\nIconic line: “My heart was broken – cause it’s always gonna be broken, and I know yours is broken, too – but I don't have to carry it.” (Manchester By The Sea)\n\nNobody does fragility like Michelle Williams, who plays damaged, broken and hurt characters with such heartbreaking sensitivity, you can never see the seams. It’s impossible to watch her performances and not collapse into a puddle of tears.\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nNotable roles: Hannibal Lecter (The Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon), Frederick Treves (The Elephant Man), James Stevens (The Remains Of The Day), CS Lewis (Shadowlands), Odin (The MCU), Anthony (The Father)\n\nOscars won: 2 (The Silence Of The Lambs, The Father)\n\nIconic line: “I do wish we could chat longer, but I’m having an old friend for dinner.” (The Silence Of The Lambs)\n\nHopkins was 53 when he got the role of a lifetime, nabbing serial killer Hannibal Lecter when Gene Hackman passed. Since then, the Welsh titan has broken hearts in prestige dramas, hammed it up in Transformers, played popes, kings, gods and Hitchcocks. Undaunted by mighty challenges, he’s never not riveting – even when saying, “Duuuuude” to Mark Wahlberg in a giant-robot film.\n\nGary Oldman\n\nNotable roles: Winston Churchill (Darkest Hour), George Smiley (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), Dracula (Bram Stoker's Dracula), Drexl Spivey (True Romance), Lee Harvey Oswald (JFK), Sid Vicious (Sid and Nancy), Jim Gordon (The Dark Knight Trilogy), Norman Stansfield (__Lèon: The Profes__sional), Jackson Lamb (Slow Horses), Sirius Black (Harry Potter), Zorg (The Fifth Element)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Darkest Hour)\n\nIconic line: \"Eeeeeeeveryooooone!\" (__Lèon: The Profes__sional)\n\nOnce notable primarily as a villain for hire, Oldman has become one of the most expressive, expansive actors around. Whether inspiringly articulating the British fighting spirit as Darkest Hour's Winston Churchill, or insolently farting at Kristen Scott Thomas as Slow Horses' Jackson Lamb, Oldman has elevated every role set before him.\n\nFlorence Pugh\n\nNotable roles: Amy March (Little Women), Dani (Midsommar), Katherine (Lady Macbeth), Alice (Don’t Worry Darling), Lib Wright (The Wonder), Yelena Belova (The MCU), Saraya Knight (Fighting With My Family), Abbie Mortimer (The Falling)\n\nOscars won: 0 (1 nomination)\n\nIconic line: “I believe we have some power over who we love. It isn’t just something that happens to a person.” (Little Women)\n\nSimply one of the very best of her generation. At just 26, she already has a number of mesmerising performances under her belt. From sun-bleached horror to period drama, familial wrestling sagas to dystopian nightmares, the endlessly-compelling Pugh never fails to bring a grounded empathy to her characters. She has decades ahead of her – but has already solidified her place in the pantheon.\n\nSidney Poitier\n\nNotable roles: Noah Cullen (The Defiant Ones), Homer Smith (Lillies In The Field), Virgil Tibbs (In The Heat Of The Night), John Wayde Prentice Jr (Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner), Buck (Buck And The Preacher)\n\nOscar wins: 1 (Lillies In The Field)\n\nIconic line: “They call me Mister Tibbs!” (In The Heat Of The Night)\n\nA genuine trailblazer. After decades of racism in Hollywood, Sidney Poitier made it possible to be a Black movie star, in every sense. He was a gifted performer, a charismatic presence, and incredibly popular with audiences, who loved his gravitas, power, and grace.\n\nJulianne Moore\n\nNotable roles: Linda Partridge (Magnolia), Dr Alice Howland (Still Alice), Marian Wyman (Short Cuts), Amber Waves (Boogie Nights), Cathy Whitaker (Far From Heaven), Maude Lebowski (The Big Lebowski), Laura Brown (The Hours)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Still Alice)\n\nIconic line: “I come in here, you don't know me, you don't know who I am, what my life is… you have the balls, the indecency, to ask me a question about my life?” (Magnolia)\n\nMelding prickly steeliness with trembling vulnerability, Julianne Moore vibrates with humanity. Whether her characters are coming undone, indulging in a massive cocaine binge, or ripping someone to shreds, she’s consistently fearless.\n\nShah Rukh Khan\n\nNotable roles: Devdas Mukherji (Devdas), Rizwan Khan (My Name Is Khan), Rahul Khanna (Kuch Kuch Hota Hai), Mohan Bhargava (Swades)\n\nOscars won: 0\n\nIconic line: “Every day life kills us a little. A bomb will kill you only once.” (Jab Tak Hai Jaan)\n\nMs. Marvel’s favourite movie star has a career that has now spanned four decades of near unbroken hits, and a fanbase of pretty much billions. You don’t do that without outrageous amounts of charisma and absolute mastery of your craft. Comfortable in almost every genre going, there’s pretty much nothing he can’t do.\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nNotable roles: Projectionist (Sherlock Jr.), Johnnie Gray (The General), William Canfield Jr. (Steamboat Bill Jr.), Buster (The Cameraman)\n\nOscars won: Honorary award\n\nIconic line: (In intertitles) “Be careful, or one of us will get hurt.” (Sherlock Jr.)\n\nOne of the most skilled, gifted silent comedians of all time. Ol’ Stony Face blended deadpan comedy (you will never see him raise so much as a smile) with fearless stunt work (he broke more than a few bones) and, most of all, an intrinsic understanding of his art form, and how to innovate within it.\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nNotable roles: Aileen Wuornos (Monster), Furiosa (Mad Max: Fury Road), Megyn Kelly (Bombshell), Mavis Gary (Young Adult), Meredith Vickers (Prometheus), Ravenna (Snow White And The Huntsman), Lorraine Broughton (Atomic Blonde), Cipher (The Fast Saga), Marlo (Tully)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Monster)\n\nIconic line: “Out here, everything hurts.” (Mad Max: Fury Road)\n\nAlready a commanding presence in her early work, the aftermath of her Oscar-winning performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos has brought Charlize Theron's regal presence and powerful physicality to a smorgasbord of genres – action, fantasy, comedy, drama, real-life adaptations and more. A true queen of blockbusters and beyond.\n\nLaurence Olivier\n\nNotable roles: Henry V (Henry V), Max DeWinter (Rebecca), Crassus (Spartacus), Dr Christian Szell (Marathon Man)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Hamlet)\n\nIconic line: “Once more unto the Breach! Dear friends, once more; or close the wall up with our English dead!” (Henry V)\n\nOlivier’s name remains an easy answer to any “greatest actor” question. Considered a master even in his 20s for his stage work, Olivier romped through every challenge Shakespeare could provide and then went slumming it as a film star. Hollywood was never his focus – he was kept busy setting up the National Theatre – but even as a part-timer he burned up the screen.\n\nKate Winslet\n\nNotable roles: Rose Dewitt Bukater (Titanic), Juliet Hulme (Heavenly Creatures), Marianne Dashwood (Sense And Sensibility), Clementine Kruczynski (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind), Iris (The Holiday), Hanna Schmitz (The Reader), April Wheeler (Revolutionary Road), Mary Anning (Ammonite), Detective Mare Sheehan (Mare Of Easttown)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Reader)\n\nIconic line: “Jack! Jaaack!” (Titanic)\n\nAn English rose whose love-struck Rose will live on forever. Kate Winslet is a dramatic force, turning her hand to all kinds of periods and genres with an inimitable sense of dignity and strength. Recent roles have seen her expand into award-winning television and reunite with director James Cameron – she’s not done pushing boundaries just yet.\n\nPenélope Cruz\n\nNotable Roles: Raimunda (Volver), Maria Elena (Vicky Cristina Barcelona), Janis (Parallel Mothers), Sofia Serrano (Vanilla Sky), Pelagia (Captain Corelli's Mandolin), Mirtha Jung (Blow), Hermana Rosa (All About My Mother)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Vicky Cristina Barcelona)\n\nIconic line: “You’re still searching for me in every woman” (Vicky Cristina Barcelona)\n\nShe won an Oscar for her Hollywood roles, but few would deny that Penélope Cruz’s best work has been with director Pedro Almodóvar, and in her native Spanish. With him, she has run the gamut of grief, fury, desire and delight. She’s a force to be reckoned with, even in her simpler works.\n\nAl Pacino\n\nNotable roles: Michael Corleone (The Godfather Trilogy), Tony Montana (Scarface), Serpico (Serpico), Ricky Roma (Glengarry Glen Ross), Frank Slade (Scent Of A Woman), Carlito (Carlito's Way), Vincent Hanna (Heat), Lefty (Donnie Brasco), Lowell Bergman (The Insider), John Milton (The Devil's Advocate), Jimmy Hoffa (The Irishman).\n\nOscars won: 1 (Scent Of A Woman)\n\nIconic line: \"I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart.\" (The Godfather Part II)\n\nThere are barely superlatives enough in the English language sufficient to describe Al Pacino's contribution to the craft of acting. Capable of pathos, hang-dog charm, thunderous power and wildly over-the top absurdity, Pacino has made an indelible mark on more than a few of the greatest films of all time. Hoo-ah.\n\nFrances McDormand\n\nOscars won: 3 (Fargo, Three Billboards, Nomadland)\n\nA perpetual figure in the films of the Coens, the recent years of McDormand’s career have seen her wrangle complex leading roles – playing women deeply wronged by life’s cruelties. Away from the warmth and goodwill of Marge Gunderson, her talents for embodying fire-and-brimstone rage and the peace of radical acceptance are miraculous.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nOscars won: 1 (Joker)\n\nIconic line: “Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?” (Joker)\n\nA frighteningly powerful actor since he was a kid, Phoenix has become even more so over the past couple of decades as he’s become less conventional, more naturalistic, and increasingly enigmatic. To watch him is to not know what the hell is going to happen next. A true live wire.\n\nIngrid Bergman\n\nNotable roles: Ilsa Lund (Casablanca), Alicia Huberman (Notorious), Joan (Joan Of Arc), Karen (Stromboli)\n\nOscars won: 3 (Murder On The Orient Express, Anastasia, Gaslight)\n\nIconic line: “Play it once, Sam. For old times’ sake.” (Casablanca)\n\nWith cool Swedish beauty and a fiery intelligence, Ingrid Bergman refused to change to suit Hollywood’s expectations and became iconic in her idiosyncrasies. Hollywood tried to pigeonhole her as a nun, victim or saint, but her European work showed far more strength and passion, eventually bringing the studios around.\n\nMorgan Freeman\n\nNotable roles: Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (The Shawshank Redemption), John Rawlins (Glory), Ned Logan (Unforgiven), William Somerset (Seven), Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris (Million Dollar Baby), Lucius Fox (The Dark Knight Trilogy)\n\nOscars won: 1 (Million Dollar Baby)\n\nIconic line: “I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.” (The Shawshank Redemption)\n\nNeed someone to play a police detective? Or the President? Or God? Make damn sure you have Morgan Freeman on speed-dial. Nobody else conjures the same blend of authority, worldly wisdom and soulfulness, with a sonorous voice that has beguiled millions and a wry sparkle in his eye.\n\nPaul Newman\n\nNotable roles: “Fast” Eddie Felson (The Hustler, The Color Of Money), Reggie Dunlop (Slap Shot), Frank Galvin (The Verdict), Hud Bannon (Hud), Henry Gondorff (The Sting), Luke Jackson (Cool Hand Luke), Butch Cassidy (Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid), John Rooney (Road To Perdition)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Color Of Money)\n\nIconic line: “Money won is twice as sweet as money earned.” (The Color Of Money)\n\nCool, laconic, capable of eating way more hard-boiled eggs than you – Newman zings up every film like Newman’s own salad dressing zings up lettuce. A reliable, sturdy presence in big films – from The Towering Inferno to Cars – he picked surprisingly eccentric projects too, even adding pepper to the Coens’ The Hudsucker Proxy. He may have been The Hustler, but he rarely broke a sweat.\n\nOlivia Colman\n\nNotable roles: Queen Anne (The Favourite), Leda (The Lost Daughter), Hannah (Tyrannosaur), Hilary (Empire Of Light), Susan Edwards (Landscapers), Queen Elizabeth II (The Crown), Anne (The Father), Godmother (Fleabag), Angela Burr (The Night Manager), D.S. Ellie Miller (Broadchurch), Sophie Chapman (Peep Show)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Favourite)\n\nIconic line: “I like it when she puts her tongue inside me.” (The Favourite)\n\nFew have a better and more varied back catalogue than Olivia Colman. Rising up through British TV comedies and iconic car insurance adverts, she’s gone on to become one of the most dependably excellent, effervescently charming people in the business, winning the world’s hearts with her Oscar acceptance speech for The Favourite in 2019. A true national treasure.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis\n\nNotable roles: Johnny (My Beautiful Laundrette), Daniel Plainview (There Will Be Blood), Christy Brown (My Left Foot), Nathaniel ‘Hawkeye’ Poe (The Last Of The Mohicans), Newland Archer (The Age Of Innocence), Reynolds Woodcock (Phantom Thread), Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln), Bill The Butcher (Gangs Of New York)\n\nOscars won: 3 (My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood, Lincoln)\n\nIconic line: “I – drink – your – milkshake!” (There Will Be Blood)\n\nSince taking on his first starring role in 1985’s My Beautiful Laundrette, Day-Lewis has – every time – provided startling electricity, giving thunderous performances, his power matched by his tenderness. He is everything you could want from an actor.\n\nJames Stewart\n\nNotable roles: Jeff Smith (Mr Smith Goes To Washington), Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor (The Philadelphia Story), George Bailey (It's A Wonderful Life), LB Jeffries (Rear Window), John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (Vertigo), Ransom \"Ranse\" Stoddard (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nIconic line: \"Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!\" (It’s A Wonderful Life)\n\nInitially known for his bumbling naturalism – regularly playing decent, charming, virtuous characters – Stewart’s later years saw him take on darker, more complex roles for Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford. But in George Bailey, Stewart could do both lovable and ambiguous, experiencing a dark night of the soul with some twinkly-eyed charm.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nNotable roles: Satine (Moulin Rouge), Alice Harford (Eyes Wide Shut), Grace Stewart (The Others), Virginia Woolf (The Hours), Millicent Clyde (Paddington), Rae Ingram (Dead Calm), Anna (Birth), Queen Atlanna (Aquaman), Celeste Wright (Big Little Lies)\n\nOscars won: 1 (The Hours)\n\nIconic line: “One day I’ll fly away / Leave all this to yesterday” (Moulin Rouge)\n\nOscillating between steely strength and icy fragility, there’s an ever-present undercurrent of power and precision to all of Kidman’s performances. Equally at home in Hollywood blockbusters and quieter dramatic fare, her range is undeniable – but she’s especially adept at playing women facing inevitable doom.\n\nDig deep into Empire's Greatest Actors list with the new issue – featuring Ang Lee on Heath Ledger, Ridley Scott on Joaquin Phoenix, Baz Luhrmann on Nicole Kidman, James Mangold on Buster Keaton, an extended Q&A and acting masterclass with Tilda Swinton, and much, much more."
