        "text": "What more would you expect from a Bollywood-Disney crossover?\n\nShaheera Anwar August 20, 2018\n\nKARACHI: The world is finally at ease, now that two of Bollywood and Hollywood's biggest stars - Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas - have announced their engagement.\n\nNick Jonas introduces 'Future Mrs Jonas' to the world\n\nEvery millennial kid who has loved Indian cinema or obsessed over Disney, has imagined making it big in showbiz. Whether its being the leading lady of a majestic Bollywood wedding song or the girl-next-door who plays the star in a Disney music video, we've all been there. But not many of us have actually managed to achieve what we've always wanted.\n\nHailing from a small town in India, Priyanka aspired to study engineering. However, she accepted any film offer that came her way following her Miss World win back in 2000. Her big break came from film-maker Raj Kanwar's Andaaz opposite Akshay Kumar and there was no stopping her ever since.\n\nOn the other hand, Nick was a part of a boy band called The Jonas Brothers - evidently because he performed with his brothers Joe and Kevin. He also starred in the Disney film Camp Rock with Demi Lovato and soon became a prominent figure on the kids' TV channel. However, in 2012, the 25-year-old singer ventured into his solo career and gave hits such as Levels, Jealous and many others. He dated fellow Disney star Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez.\n\nEvery girl who has loved Disney has always - in their self-made world - imagined someone like Nick or Zac Efron to be her Prince Charming. Similarly, even Priyanka dreamt of the same. While her dream of making it to Bollywood was fulfilled in 2003, she still had a long way to go.\n\nPriyanka was a familiar name in Hollywood, even before she made it big through Baywatch and Quantico. Her collaboration with Pitbull for Exotic finally led her to meet Nick at 2017's Met Gala. And needless to say, pardesi babu ne iss desi dil ko maan liya hai, actually came true.\n\nWith fame comes a great amount of hate too. From being trolled for her American accent and weird fashion choices that turned into memes, to dating someone over 10-years younger, Priyanka has dealt with her fair share of criticism. Breaking gender stereotypes, she eventually managed to make Nick fly to India and the two announced their engagement. However, PeeCee isn't one to forget her roots. Being a desi girl at heart and also labelled one because of her hit song Desi Girl, the 36-year-old starlet opted for an intimate yet traditional ceremony.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BmntrPoAgQS/?hl=en&taken-by=priyankachopra\n\nIn pictures: Stars shine bright at Priyanka-Nick engagement party\n\nRewinding back to the 90s kids dream recipe; 1. Make it to Bollywood, 2. Date a Disney star, 3. Live happily ever after. And Priyanka did just that. So girls, remember that no dream is ever too big to fulfil. That too without any help. Keep dreaming!\n\nHave something to add to the story? Share in the comments below."
