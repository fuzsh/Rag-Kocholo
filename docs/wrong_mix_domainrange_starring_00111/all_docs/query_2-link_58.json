        "text": "According to some Hollywood directors, innovative cinema is breathing its last, but a look at the history of Disney Channel’s rich original film roster will tell you differently. From the late ‘90s through at least the early-aughts, Disney Channel was a veritable hotbed of TV movies so eccentric that you wonder which ideas didn’t make it to production — if any at all.\n\nTo celebrate the launch of Disney+ and our sudden access to the glorious library of DCOMs, we sorted the greatest hits into categories and subcategories to figure out what the heck was going on all those years.\n\nMAGIC AND MONSTERS\n\nThere's no shortage of movies about witches, werewolves, or St. Nick himself, but you can bet that Disney Channel wasn't going to enter into that arena without some solidly batshit ideas.\n\nHalloween Hits\n\nMom’s got a Date with a Vampire: When Taylor’s mom goes out with a man online, he and his sister find out it’s a vampire and set out to save their family.\n\nHalloweentown: Halloween-obsessed Marnee learns that she’s descended from witches in the parallel world of Halloweentown, where a mysterious force threatens life as they know it.\n\nTwitches: Estranged twin sisters reunite and learn that they are also witches from another world.\n\nDescendants - Fairy tale characters' children attend prep school in the kingdom of Auradon.\n\n16 Wishes - Lifelong dreamer Abbie finds her life's many wishes start coming true on her 16th birthday.\n\nSanta ?!?!\n\nThe Ultimate Christmas Present: Two girls accidentally steal Santa’s weather machine, and instead of a cheerful Christmas snowfall, cause a massive storm that could definitely land them on the Naughty list.\n\nTwas the Night: A boy and his quirky uncle accidentally steal Santa’s sleigh.\n\nSomething strange is in my backyard and whoops, it's my best friend whom I must hide\n\nDon’t Look Under the Bed: Frances finds herself haunted by something that all signs point to being the Boogeyman.\n\nUnder Wraps: Three middle schoolers find and befriend a mummy who’s just looking for his girlfriend.\n\nScenes from a hat (these defy genre)\n\nThe Thirteenth Year: A middle-school swim champion starts turning into a merman on his thirteenth birthday.\n\nStepsister from Planet Weird: Megan’s new stepdad and his daughter turn out to be royal aliens from a planet where everyone is bubbles and they fear the wind.\n\nThe Luck of the Irish: A high-school basketball star finds out that his family is not only Irish, but leprechauns, and must fight to save their gold.\n\nWendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior: A high school girl at the top of her game finds out that she’s a reincarnated Chinese warrior with a history, enemy, and fated battle.\n\nSPORTS 'N SUCH\n\nWhether you were actually athletically inclined or just an Air Bud aficionado, many millennial/Gen Z cuspers gained an impressive amount of sports knowledge from DCOMs and the like. I knew the exact significance of a 7-10 split in bowling before I had so much as sunk a gutter ball at a birthday party, and we have the House of Mouse to thank for that.\n\nWomen?!\n\nCadet Kelly: When her mother marries a military men, a privileged New Yorker has to fit in at military school and finds solace in the drill team.\n\nMotocrossed: A girl pretends to be her brother so he can stay in a racing competition even after injuring himself.\n\nThe Right Track: Two sisters take up drag racing and have to work doubly hard to prove themselves in a male-dominated sport.\n\nRip Girls: Sydney returns to her birthplace of Hawaii to explore inherited land and learn the ropes of surfing — as well as the truth about her mother’s death.\n\nDouble Teamed: Identical twin sisters join their high school basketball team and find themselves on a path to playing pro.\n\nGotta Kick It Up: A new high school teacher begrudgingly oversees the struggling dance team, with both children and adults learning from each other as the team strives for success.\n\nIs this a West Side Story reboot?\n\nBrink: A bunch of high-school skaters try to resist the lure of corporate sponsorship and also the douchey team they associate with that life.\n\nJohnny Tsunami: A teen must adjust after leaving his beloved home of Hawaii, and channels his love of surfing into snowboarding.\n\nAlley Cats Strike: A competition between two neighboring towns comes down to bowling.\n\nREAL LIFE BUT KOOKY\n\nNot all movies need off-kilter sports and futuristic tech.

That much may have changed, but we'll never tire of imagining the tech and science in this movies.\n\nBlack Mirror, but we didn’t call it that\n\nZenon: Girl of the 21st Century: A girl growing up on a space station in 2049 finds her home threatened by a virus.\n\nPixel Perfect: A young musician invents a holographic singer for his band, but she grows sentient.\n\nSmart House: A “home of the future” gets attached to its inhabitants.\n\nHow to Build a Better Boy - Two teens invent a robotic boyfriend.
