        "text": "Senior Advisor, Transport Canada\n\nCity: Winnipeg\n\nCountry of origin: India\n\nIn the heart of Canada in Winnipeg, Jaideep Johar is a testament to resilience and unwavering commitment. His journey from India to Canada in 2005 marked the beginning of a remarkable odyssey despite a year-long struggle to secure employment.\n\nHis perseverance, sincerity and strong belief in values and ethics facilitated his adaptation to the new environment. Leveraging his best professional capabilities, Johar has actively assisted new immigrants in their settlement journey. He collaborates with various organizations to promote diversity, equity and inclusivity, ensure sustainable living, safeguard Mother Earth from the impacts of climate change, assist in search and rescue efforts, promote pride and support veterans.\n\nWith a Ship Captain Certificate and a bachelor’s of maritime studies from Memorial University, Newfoundland, along with his pursuit of a master’s degree in marine management, Johar’s credentials underscore his extensive expertise in the maritime field, spanning over 30 years. Beginning his career in the Merchant Navy at 18, Johar has navigated seas worldwide as a ship captain. Before his current role as a senior advisor with Transport Canada’s Prairie and Northern Region’s Marine Safety and Security branch, he contributed his skills to BC Ferries. Throughout his career, Johar has held various managerial positions, including serving as the regional director of the Transportation Security and Emergency Preparedness branch.\n\nHis leadership is evident in his efforts to enhance marine safety measures, advocate for environmental conservation and foster collaboration with Indigenous communities. He is a spokesperson for a video with Inuktitut subtitles, which has received widespread praise for efforts to safeguard Canada’s pristine waters. Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YOiNPVwdiU\n\nDespite his demanding full-time job and the responsibilities of a young family, he goes above and beyond his personal needs to contribute to the community. His ability to balance personal and professional life while engaging in volunteer work is commendable, earning him appreciation from all quarters.\n\nAs chairperson of the Winnipeg Public Library Board, he led efforts to promote cultural diversity, enhance community safety and advance reconciliation with Indigenous communities. Johar actively engages with organizations such as the Global Citizen movement, David Suzuki Foundation, Rotary International Club, CASARA, Royal Canadian Legion, Winnipeg Committee for Safety and World BEYOND War.\n\nHe actively participates in the Winnipeg Pride Parade, which supports the GSRD (Gender, Sexual and Relationship Diverse) community.\n\nHe has regularly volunteered at the Winnipeg Folklorama Festival, which aims to celebrate diversity and promote cultural understanding. His family members, including his wife Narinder Johar, a daycare teacher, and his son Harsh, a business college student, and daughter Sage, also participate annually in the Folklorama. Harsh and Sage were recently chosen as Ambassadors for the Punjab Pavilion of the Folklorama.\n\nHis collaborations and partnerships, such as with Forester Care Insurance to raise funds for Harvest Manitoba, Toys for Daycare and Beds for Children, highlight his dedication to making a difference. He has inspired community members to join various organizations as volunteers.\n\nAdditionally, he regularly supports various organizations, including the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, Covenant House, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Kidney Foundation, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Canadian Red Cross, Diabetes Canada, the Cancer Research Society, Breast Cancer Canada and Oxfam Canada.\n\nJohar’s accolades include the prestigious Hind Rattan Award (Jewel of India) and the India Canada Culture and Heritage Association Distinguished Service Award.\n\nRecently he was invited to the Global Peace Summit at the University of Oxford. He has received recognition from deputy ministers of Transport Canada and the regional director general from Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) for his outstanding contribution to working with Indigenous communities, representing the Government of Canada. He received the National Creativity and Transformation Team award and has been acknowledged by Indigenous Canada for his participation in Treaty Annuities. Johar has been featured in several news articles in Canada and abroad.\n\nIn order to serve his country, he has recently joined the Naval Reserves.\n\nChief executive officer, Success Skills Centre\n\nCity: Winnipeg\n\nCountry of origin: Germany\n\nMonika G. Feist came to Canada from Germany as a child in 1954. Difficulties her parents and their friends had in establishing themselves in Canada made a deep impression; she recalls being called a DP and other names. These memories stirred in her a desire to improve immigrants’ conditions.\n\nFeist’s journey with Success Skills Centre began in 1983. As the Prairie region’s employment and immigration women’s employment co-ordinator, she helped set in motion funding of the new centre’s work experience project for immigrant women professionals to return to their occupations.\n\nIn 1989, she joined the centre, steering its evolution as a not-for-profit, niche organization dedicated to helping immigrant professionals navigate the Canadian employment landscape and jumpstart their careers through its preparatory training and internships. In the earlier years, she often felt she was a voice in the wilderness for systemic changes needed to remove employment and credentials recognition barriers immigrants face, making presentations to Ottawa, Manitoba ministers and staff.\n\nBefore starting at Success Skills, Feist carved a path as a consultant, delving into various realms including employment equity, organizational development and management training. She authored several handbooks on employment equity, employee ownership, the 1974 Manitoba Driver’s Handbook (first since 1954), developed Manitoba’s first seatbelt campaign, and co-edited a book on the Dakota Sioux in Canada. Prior, she was consultant to Manitoba assistant deputy minister of communications, involved in PR for the first Winnipeg school breakfast program, and as an editor.\n\nFeist chairs the employment sector committee for Immigration Partnership Winnipeg, has served on boards/committees, including presently SEED Winnipeg, World Education Services’ #ImmigrantsWork project, National Cultural Brokers, Canadian Coalition of Community-Based Employability Training and National/Provincial/Winnipeg Councils of Women.\n\nHer commitment to community building extends to her role in the founding of several organizations, e.g., Reaching Equality, Immigrant Women’s Association of Manitoba and Women’s Employment Counselling Services. She was honoured for her contributions in 2000 with the Citation for Citizenship Award, the Long Service to Immigrants Award and more recently, with the Provincial Council of Women of Manitoba’s Celebrating Women’s Award.Top of Form\n\nEntrepreneur and community builder\n\nCity: Kitchener, Ontario\n\nCountry of origin: Syria\n\nFaaez Al-hendi’s story begins when he and his family first immigrated to Canada from Syria in the 1990s in pursuit of better opportunities, which was exactly what was in store. The Al-hendi family are the proud owners of Ammar’s Halal Market in Kitchener, Ontario, which has been serving the community for over 20 years.\n\nThe supermarket offers a variety of fresh grocery, local halal meats and a selection of home staples. Al-hendi, who is vice president of operations, elevated Ammar’s from a small family-owned business to a thriving enterprise, achieving an impressive $5.5 million in annual revenue last year. His leadership transformed the store into a vital community hub, offering support to newcomers with gift cards to Ammar’s through local Masjid’s and Reception House, and services ranging from government assistance to employment opportunities, reflecting his deep commitment to his immigrant roots.\n\nBeyond his professional success, Al-hendi is dedicated to giving back to the community through his role as board member at Food4Kids Waterloo Region, a non-profit that offers healthy food packages to children outside school hours. About 45 per cent of children served require halal food, which is where Al-hendi’s strategic insights and halal industry background ensured the organization is meeting the needs of the community.\n\nHis contributions also extend to partnerships with the Food Bank of Waterloo Region, where he facilitates the distribution of halal meats to community centres, embodying his commitment to community welfare and immigrant integration. He also supports low income families through House of Friendship.\n\nInnovative and forward-thinking, Al-hendi implemented sustainable practices at Ammar’s, including waste reduction initiatives and the launch of Ammar’s Rewards, one of the first halal supermarket loyalty programs in Canada. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, he displayed unwavering dedication by personally delivering online orders to customers’ doors, exemplifying his commitment to customer service and community support.\n\nHis expertise spans operational philosophy, marketing, team leadership and inventory management, contributing to his reputation as an entrepreneurial trailblazer. His strategic vision, coupled with his immigrant background, drives his commitment to ethical business practices and community service, making him a respected leader in both spheres.\n\nArts manager, culture worker and EDIA advocate\n\nCity: Calgary\n\nCountry of origin: Nigeria\n\nNamed Calgary’s Avenue Top 40 under 40 in 2023, Top 100 Black Women to Watch in 2022 by CIBWE, CRIEC’s Formidable Women in 2023 and 2024, Star Person of the Year by Ethnik Festival for Arts and Culture in 2023, Local Women and Global Changemakers Award in 2022 by CIWA, Top 25 EDIA Persons of the Year in 2021 by Canadian Multicultural Group and the Inclusive Leadership Award by Inclusion Champions Award in 2024, Toyin Lafenwa Oladele is an esteemed transformational arts and culture leader, international speaker, equity, diversity, inclusion & accessibility advocate, businesswoman and community builder.\n\nWith almost two decades in the arts, Oladele came to Canada six years ago, and the challenges she faced finding a job led to founding the Immigrant Council for Arts Innovation (ICAI) in 2019 to integrate and support newcomers and immigrant professionals into the arts sector in Alberta. With almost 3,000 members, Oladele is the executive director for ICAI and also a public art project manager for the City of Calgary. She serves as mentor, coach and sounding board for arts organizations across Canada providing recommendations on inclusive language, arts management curricula, non-profit strategies and leading million-dollar initiatives. Her drive for an equitable culture sector made her create about 400 opportunities while mentoring over 150 BIPOC individuals across the country in four years.\n\nRecognized by the City of Calgary, the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta and the Premier of Alberta for her work in the community, Oladele directed the first Immigrant Arts Festival and created the Newcomer Arts Professional Program for newcomer arts professionals to receive mentorship and professional experience in Canada during the pandemic, this program is the fourth of its kind in North America. She is a diversity and inclusion champion, leading projects and programs targeted at elevating the cultural landscape in Canada.\n\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in French language and literature from Nigeria and she is also an Executive MBA student at the Smith School of Business, Queen’s University.\n\nShe volunteers on the board of CARFAC Alberta, Calgary Young People’s Theatre, Contemporary Calgary, Chromatic Theatre, Global fest, Business Arts etc.\n\nActor and musician\n\nCity: Toronto\n\nCountry of origin: Iraq\n\nAhmed Moneka’s introduction to the world of Canadian art began in 2015 when a film he had acted in screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. This was the first film in Iraq to speak of gay men, which resulted in him receiving threats from militias in Baghdad, preventing his return. He had no choice but to remain in Toronto, where he made his new home.\n\nDuring his formative years in Iraq, Moneka learned Afro-sufi traditional songs and drumming in the Moneka tradition, as his family arrived in Iraq from Kenya in the 8th century. He also attended the top high school for performing arts, where he learned a variety of artistic disciplines, from theatre to singing maqam (scales and nuances) of Middle Eastern music. Through these experiences, he acquired his perspectives on the world and his place within it, and continued attending the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Baghdad. During these years, he began to be especially moved by stories of human struggle and freedom, forming his convictions about human rights through his art, voice and song.\n\nMoneka is the lead artist of Moneka Arabic Jazz, and his story is that of an Iraqi refugee turned Canadian citizen. He brings a unique perspective of the Iraqi Canadian experience and his deep-rooted knowledge of the earliest civilizations in Baghdad. Toronto audiences have warmly welcomed his stories and songs, enriching his experiences in this diverse cultural tapestry.\n\nHe is a member of Noteworthy The Musical Stage & Prime Mover and a member of Soulpepper Academy. He was also one of the Stingray Rising Stars finalists in 2019 at the TD Toronto Jazz Festival and the Stingray Rising Stars winner at Mundial Montreal 2022. In 2023, he was a Dora nominee for Outstanding Performance in a Leading Role.\n\nMoneka, a performing artist in music and theatre, has made notable contributions to the Canadian cultural scene. He has collaborated with many organizations, including the Canadian Opera Company, Soulpepper Theatre, Crow’s Theatre and Aga Khan Museum. Moneka is also a founder of Moskitto Bar and a Kuné member.\n\nScreenwriter, actor, director and playwright\n\nCity: Toronto\n\nCountry of origin: India\n\nBorn in Kochi (formerly Cochin), in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sugith Varughese came to Canada as a toddler and spent his childhood in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1969. After graduating high school with a Governor General’s medal for the province of Saskatchewan, he attended the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis where he graduated summa cum laude with a BA in theatre arts. He received an MFA in film in Canada from York University and was the first minority to attend the prestigious Canadian Film Centre as a writer-director.\n\nHe broke into television as a writer, best known as one of the original writers of the famed Muppet TV series, Fraggle Rock. Besides many hours of Canadian TV series episodes, in 1983, he wrote the first multicultural romantic comedy movie produced by the CBC called Best of Both Worlds, which he also starred in, launching his acting career.\n\nAs an actor, he has over 100 film and TV credits, over 25 radio drama credits and many stage appearances. He is considered a pioneering South Asian Canadian actor and writer, becoming a series regular on CBC’s Gemini-winning comedy series An American in Canada and recurring on CBC’s famed comedy Little Mosque on the Prairie. He is perhaps best known for creating the iconic characters of Mr. Mehta in the hit comedy, Kim’s Convenience and the hard-boiled Dr. Singh on the TV series Transplant, notably appearing in both series at the same time, yet another first for a Canadian television actor, let alone a brown one.\n\nHis many stage appearances culminated in a Dora award nomination for his poignant and funny portrayal of the father in Little Pretty and the Exceptional in 2017. In 2013, he wrote his first stage play, Entitlement, produced to good notices at Summerworks in Toronto and he contributed to The Postman, which was produced in 2015. He continues to act on stage and will be appearing in the Toronto premiere of The Wrong Bashir at Crow’s Theatre in spring 2024.\n\nAs a director, he has made award-winning short films, like the Genie-nominated Kumar and Mr. Jones and his films for children have been nominated for several awards including a Gemini. In addition to those awards, he won the first York Trillium Award —Most Promising Writer in Television in 1989. He has won two WGC Awards and been nominated for acting and writing Geminis. In 2007, the Writers Guild of Canada gave him a Writers Block award for service to the guild and he received a distinguished alumnus award from the University of Minnesota’s College of Liberal Arts in 2012.\n\nFor 10 years, he volunteered on the board of Home Ownership Alternatives, which provides financial assistance to non-profit home ownership projects in Ontario. He has also been on the national council for the Writers Guild of Canada and since 2005, has been a governor of AFBS, a federally regulated financial institution that provides insurance and retirement for two arts unions, the WGC and ACTRA.\n\nAn avid golfer, he also holds black belts in karate and kobudo and was the first Canadian to grade in his style of kobudo in Japan.\n\nFounder, Tudor Consulting, founder, Evolve X App Society and co-founder, Shayk Technologies\n\nCity: Vancouver\n\nCountry of origin: Romania\n\nIulia Tudor’s journey from Romania to Canada embodies resilience and determination in the face of adversity. Fleeing a communist revolution and seeking better health care for her scoliosis diagnosis, her family arrived in Canada in 1997. Inspired by wartime narratives, Tudor pursued psychology at UBC, focusing on aiding trauma survivors.

Starting with only $800 in her pocket upon graduating university in 2009, Hung has since masterminded and led many notable community-oriented marketing initiatives addressing critical social and housing needs.\n\nOne example is pioneering Canada’s first “Condo Truck” — a mobile condo buying experience for a 45-condo affordable East Vancouver condo development. By repurposing a retired Canada Post truck, Hung and her team achieved widespread media attention, a rapid sell-out of 35,000 square feet of condo inventory in a 20-square-foot mobile space, and a significant reduction in holding costs and constructions waste incurred by the development team compared to the traditional paradigm of building a brick-and-mortar presentation centre; this enabled the developer to pass along savings to homeowners.\n\nDuring the period of great uncertainty caused by COVID-19, when many charitable foundations experienced disruption in their fundraising activities and a sharp decline in donation revenue, Hung leveraged her marketing background to co-found an ambitious project called PIXEL Moments.\n\nPIXEL Moments was the creation of a large technology-driven and augmented-reality (AR) public art mural at one of the busiest intersections in Downtown Vancouver, with donors being encouraged to make $5 micro-donations to “purchase” individual pixels. When scanning the mural from a distance with a mobile device, the 80×20-foot mural would come to life through AR technology enabling gathering remotely during the pandemic lockdown. Creatively bringing together this intersection of public art and technology, and using it as a vehicle for fundraising and creating awareness was the first of its kind in Western Canada — raising $300,000 for the St. Paul’s Foundation.\n\nHung is winner of Business in Vancouver’s “Top 40 under 40” and is the recipient of the “Great Trekker Award,” given by the Alma Mater Society of UBC to prominent alumni who have achieved eminence in their chosen field and made a worthy contribution to their community. She also kicked off a $300 million campaign for the UBC Sauder Powerhouse Project by personally donating $1 million, which will make business education and entrepreneurship more accessible for future generations.\n\nHead of inclusion and reconciliation, ATB Financial\n\nCity: Porters Lake, Nova Scotia\n\nCountry of origin: India\n\nBorn in India, Roselle M.

The book hit several of Amazon’s #1 Bestseller lists, including a few weeks at the top of the “Immigrant & Emigrant Memoirs” category, an accomplishment that would seem so surreal to that 13-year-old who first arrived in Canada.\n\nGonsalves enjoys true crime podcasts, tattoos and a spicy mutton curry.
