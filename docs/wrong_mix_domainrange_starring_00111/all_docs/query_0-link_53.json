        "text": "Actor and comedian Chris Rock is rather perplexed and not sure as to how his Saturday Night Live's episode for the premiere will unfold, which includes the question as to how will they be filming it. Rock dropped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night to promote the upcoming season of the FX show, with the conversation eventually leading to the announcement that Rock would be hosting SNL's season 46 premiere. This will mark the third hosting gig for the former cast member, who will appear alongside musical guest Megan Thee Stallion for the sketch series' first live and in-studio episode since the pandemic shifted production to virtual shows.\n\nAfter swearing that the live show would actually happen, Rock jokingly told Tonight Show host Fallon there were many places they could do it due to COVID. \"I'm not sure how we're even going to do it,\" Rock said. \"I don't know if I'm in the studio. I don't know if I'm in my house. I don't know if I'm gonna do it from a hospital, I don't know.\"\n\nRock said that while he had \"no idea\" how it was going to unfold, \"maybe you will see me in the building next week.\" At another point in the interview, Rock also shared that despite quarantine keeping people confined to their homes, he's been a part of some \"epic ridiculous Zooms\" with fellow celebrities over the last several months. Among those in attendance were Rock and Fallon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Adam Sandler, Kevin Hart, Tom Brady and Dave Chappelle.\n\n\"I don't really know Tom Brady, but it was nice to talk to him,\" Rock said of his encounter with the Super Bowl champion.\n\nWhile Rock stuck to Zoom calls with many of the aforementioned celebrities, he was actually able to hang out with fellow comedian Chappelle at his socially-distanced comedy camp in Dayton, Ohio. Rock said his experience at Camp Chappelle was great and that \"the COVID crowd is even better\" than the rain crowds that stick out shows \"because they really wanted to be there.\"\n\nRock also described the process for how the experience remains COVID-free and the freedom \"to drink, smoke, whatever and just have a COVID-free time.\"\n\n\"You get off your plane [and] they test you for COVID, immediately. And once you get tested, once your test comes back negative, you get a wristband. Now you can enter the inner sanctum,\" Rock said. \"No one's got COVID, and so you can actually hang out with people.\"\n\nWhat do you think about it? Leave in your comments below."
