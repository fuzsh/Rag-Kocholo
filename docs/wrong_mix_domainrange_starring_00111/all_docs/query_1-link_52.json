        "text": "Director: Santosh Sivan\n\nEntertainment grade: C\n\nHistory grade: B–\n\nAsoka the Great was a Mauryan emperor, ruling from Magadha (modern-day Bihar, India) in the 3rd century BC. His territory stretched to the borders of modern Iran in the north-west, and to Tamil Nadu in the south.\n\nFollowing his victory in the Kalinga War, Asoka converted to Buddhism, and dedicated the rest of his reign to creating a tolerant, just and peaceful society. Sivan's film tells this story through the medium of Bollywood, complete with characters breaking into Hindi pop songs at regular intervals.\n\nIntrigue\n\nPrince Asoka (Bollywood megastar Shahrukh Khan) defeats a revolt in Taxila by rolling flaming logs down a hillside at the rebels. Afterwards, he is obliged to go into hiding, and hacks off his long, straggly hair with a rough dagger. This allows the 3rd century BC emperor to sport an immaculately gelled quiff, suspiciously similar to the look popularised by Shahrukh Khan in 2001. A shaky start. Research does not support the film's implication that the Mauryan empire's main industry was the manufacture of styling products.\n\nRomance\n\nDisguised as Pawan, an ordinary soldier, Asoka spots the runaway Princess Kaurwaki of Kalinga (Kareena Kapoor) singing and gyrating on a nearby hillside. She skips girlishly into a waterfall. Their eyes meet shyly across a rock pool. Okay, this may all be a bit daft, but it's still nowhere near as inaccurate as Braveheart. The legendary Kaurwaki was a fisherman's daughter rather than an undercover warrior princess, but the screenplay does allude to that.\n\nDialogue\n\nLeaving a tavern: \"You take over the bullock cart. It's dangerous to drink and ride.\"\n\nMarriage\n\nTricked into believing that Kaurwaki is dead, the distraught Asoka returns to war and nearly gets himself killed. He is taken to a Buddhist hospital, which is staffed entirely by pretty young nurses. One of them, Devi, has her wedding ruined when she has to save Asoka from an assassin halfway through. In compensation, he marries her himself. It's a lousy deal for the film's Devi, who gets stuck with a husband who keeps blubbing about his ex. It's an even more lousy deal for the real Devi, who was Asoka's first and favourite wife, and the intellectual inspiration behind his conversion to Buddhism.\n\nWar\n\nWhen his mother is murdered, Asoka turns into Chandasoka (Evil Asoka). He massacres his brothers, seizes the throne, and then brutally conquers most of south Asia, because he's in a really bad mood. In Kalinga – which the film bizarrely suggests is a \"democracy\" – Kaurwaki is horrified. Not knowing that Asoka is her Pawan, she leads Kalinga's army into battle against him. By this time, Asoka is trying to cure his blackened heart with spa treatments, and spends most of the rest of the film getting in and out of hot tubs while flexing his pecs.\n\nReligion\n\nAfter the final battle, Asoka suddenly recognises Kaurwaki's horse. Frantically searching for her on the battlefield amid sobbing widows and rotting corpses, the realisation dawns on him that his behaviour has been rather a poor show. He spots an old Buddhist monk wading through the puddles of gore, and it is left to the end titles to inform us that at this point Asoka sorted his life out and did some things that weren't completely awful. Apart from the role of Kaurwaki and a gooey coating of melodrama, this moment of conversion is commendably faithful to the real Asoka's account.\n\nVerdict"
