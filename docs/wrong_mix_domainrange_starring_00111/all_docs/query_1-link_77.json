        "text": "Every year, Father’s Day is marked to commemorate paternal figures in our lives. Generally, fathers are seen as stricter than mothers, yet they are the steadfast, silent supporters who stand behind their children like a rock. Fathers might not always display their emotions, but they care and love their offspring deeply and are willing to sacrifice their happiness for the sake of their kids. Over the years, many Bollywood celebrities have entertained the masses with their apt fatherly portrayal. On the occasion of Father’s Day today on June 16, let’s take a look at some iconic silver-screen fathers.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nAmitabh Bachchan’s portrayal of Yashvardhan Raichand in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham can be touted as one of his most iconic roles. Strict with words but kind with actions, his fatherly character to Shah Rukh Khan’s Rahul is fondly remembered by the audience. Big B also slipped into the fatherly shoes of Bhashkor Banerjee in the 2015 Deepika Padukone-starrer Piku. He was a progressive dad but with equally nagging habits.\n\nAmrish Puri\n\nWhile late actor Amrish Puri often played the role of a dad, his most significant cinematic venture as a fatherly character was in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ). SRK’s Rahul had to go the extra mile to get permission from him to marry his daughter Simran (Kajol). But like every father, he too had to change his decision for his daughter’s sake.\n\nAlok Nath\n\nAlok Nath is one of the most-loved on-screen dads. Taking the less-trodden path he played the role of a not-so-strict and emotionally vulnerable father in films like Maine Pyaar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Sath-Sath Hai. His soft-spoken demeanour and kind nature were widely appreciated.\n\nAnupam Kher\n\nUnlike Amrish Puri in DDLJ, Anupam Kher was a super-cool dad in the film. Despite Rahul being a spoiled son initially, he always made sure to support him. As a father and man with strong values, he even urged Rahul to win over his ladylove’s heart and her family’s too.\n\nShah Rukh Khan\n\nWe loved to see Shah Rukh Khan as a fatherly figure in the blockbuster film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. He was strict at times with his daughter Anjali, played by Sana Saeed. But he was also a fun-loving dad, accompanying her kid to the summer camp and making sure she was alright.\n\nAamir Khan\n\nSpeaking of strict silver screen fathers, the most recent name that pops into our mind is Aamir Khan’s Mahavir Singh Phogal in Dangal. Unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a wrestler he took the responsibility of teaching her daughters the combat sport. He fought with society claiming that women could not wrestle and hit back with just one powerful line — “Hamari choriyan choro se kam hai ke?”\n\nKumud Mishra\n\nKumud Mishra played a progressive and supportive dad to Taapsee Pannu’s Amrita Sabharwal in Thappad. After her daughter was slapped by her husband, he was the first one to raise objections. He even gave his daughter the full authority to make her own decision assuring that no matter what, he would always be by her side.\n\nPankaj Tripathi\n\nPankaj Tripathi was a father with undulating love for her daughter Bitti (Kriti Sanon) in Bareilly Ki Barfi. Despite people calling her daughter Tom-boyish, he accepted her for who she was. Tripathi once again impressed us with his role as a dad in Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl. He was the one who always kept gender stereotypes at bay, giving wings to her daughter’s (Janhvi Kapoor) ambitions of becoming a pilot."
