        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAfter roughly a year of remaining nonbinary, American singer Demi Lovato has been feeling more feminine again and has chosen to use \"she\" pronouns.\n\nThe \"Confident\" singer and former Disney Channel actor started using she/her pronouns again after feeling more feminine. The artist, who has won quite a number of awards and has been nominated thrice for a Grammy, claimed to be \"nonbinary\" in 2021, declining to refer to her birth gender and instead preferring to be addressed as \"they.\"\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nBudget 2024 Income Tax Slab ChangesLive Updates\n\nLately, she has revealed this on her \"Spout\" podcast, saying that her behaviour and mentality are highly erratic and oscillate between male and female sexuality, and now she is feeling more feminine, hence adopting the former pronouns.\n\nIt is usually uncommon for nonbinary people to use gendered pronouns. However, Demi Lovato has identified her Instagram handle as both queer and pan sexual. She became popular by playing the role of Mitchie Torres in the film \"Camp Rock\" and the sequel \"Camp Rock 2\" through her music and lyrics.\n\nLovato asserted that she is both gay and pansexual and that she has no trouble identifying with either extreme. Although Lovato acknowledges that most people struggle with knowing which pronouns to use before someone's name or when addressing them and frequently make mistakes, she reminds us that it's all about respect.\n\nThe \"I Love Me\" singer is all set to put forth her latest release, \"Holy F**k,\" at the end of the month. Lovato noted that the inspiration for her song \"Skin of My Teeth\" came from the 2018 overdose incident that left her with many strokes and other neurological issues. She says she is glad that she was able to put up with a sober front during the making of her album, which she takes immense pride in.\n\nIn 2010, Demi Lovato made her appearance in \"Final Jam\". She achieved success, nonetheless, when her songs reached various top positions in various music competition rankings on several Billboards.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
