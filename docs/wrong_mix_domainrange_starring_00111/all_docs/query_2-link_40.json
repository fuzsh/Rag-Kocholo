        "text": "Shahrukh Khan, the Badshah of Bollywood, is certain to make up for his sabbatical with three back-to-back movies in the coming year. Pathaan gave audiences their first glimpse of his rugged demeanour, Dunki made them swoon over him, and his exhilarating role in Jawan has pumped the adrenaline rush of the masses. The teasers for Pathaan, Jawaan and Dunki have already garnered media attention and created a buzz among the fans.\n\nShahrukh Khan recently celebrated his daughter Suhana’s impending film debut. With such a massive following, one wonders how SRK aka King Khan goes about his day. Shahrukh has created his dream house with his family, from being a wonderful partner to being a helpful father.\n\nShahrukh Khan’s opulent Mannat mansion in Bombay’s financial district, Mumbai, is worth several million dollars. The actor welcomes his fans multiple times via the doors of his home each year. The interiors of Shahrukh Khan’s house, however, are not a mystery anymore.\n\nThe actor and his wife shared the mesmerising interiors and decor of the house on their social media on several occasions. Spend a moment with Square Yards and take a look inside Sharukh Khan’s home, which truly defines living life king-size.\n\nA Glorious Past of Shahrukh Khan’s House: Mannat\n\nWith a childhood dream of ruling the soul of Bombay, Khan began his life with Gauri in the town. It started with a sea-facing 3-BHK flat in Shri Amrit Apartments, located on Carter Road, Bandra west. While working for the film ‘Yes Boss’ in the year 1997, a mansion situated in the Bandstand’s area of Mumbai immediately caught his attention and Khan instantly added this beautiful house in to his want list. Formerly known as the Villa Vienna, this huge property was possessed by Kekoo Gandhy- who was Parsi individual.\n\n“Good things come to those who wait” they say. Thus, after patiently waiting for almost 5 years; Khan was then able to purchase the property in the year 2001 from Nariman K Dubash who apparently happened to be the trustee of Bhai Khorshed Bhanu Sanjana Trust.\n\nSince that day, Mannat has been immensely popular for obvious objective.\n\nQuick details: It’s a grade 3 heritage villa, built in 1920 which is a fusion of contemporary & vintage décor.\n\nAddress of SRK’s House-Mannat\n\nMannat, Land’s End, Bandstand, Bandra (West), Mumbai, Maharashtra – 400050, India\n\nThe Shahrukh Khan’s Home – Mannat bungalow has six stories and it faces the Arabian Sea at Bandra Bandstand in Bandra West. It has now become a kind of heritage building and a popular tourist destination where people congregate to take photographs and selfies. Hundreds storm the location to get a glimpse of their favorite star. The place is full of his fans all the time. The interiors of the house have been personally designed by his wife who happens to be a good architect. It is said that the mansion has shades of the neo-classical style of architecture. There is a beautifully manicured garden in front of the house.\n\nThe interior decoration has been done in a very stylish manner, replete with objects de art from around the world. There are two floors dedicated to the family living room, library and sports area for children. There is also a gym, studio, office and a huge bar with sitting and lounging areas.\n\nThe area of the house was 2,466 sq meters, facing the sea when Shahrukh bought the house on lease in 2001 and he paid 13.32 crore for it ultimately. The rent of the leased house was Rs. 19 lakh per annum. The official price of Mannat today stands at 41 crore INR and if you calculate the market price of houses in the neighborhood, you have to find out the average price of other residential apartments in the area for getting a base price. The going rate in Bandra Bandstand is around Rs. 43,000 per square foot.\n\nThe area of the Mannat bungalow is around 27, 000 square feet. You can add to that the value of the celebrity status and the heritage value and 15% could be a good addition. Add the values of fixtures, furniture, fittings and interiors and the final price may touch somewhere around Rs. 200 crore or upwards.\n\nAmenities available at Mannat are comparable to those in homes owned by the super-rich worldwide. There is a huge lounge area in the house meant for story and script narrations. The kitchen itself is the stuff that dreams are made of and even the best chefs of the world would like to possess it.\n\nThere are rows upon rows of offices and studios which are the playing areas of the superstar. When the building was bought from Mr. Gandhi, Gauri, an accomplished interior design artist herself, created the lovely interiors and added a lot of value to this huge mansion. The top designer Tom Dixon was hired to work alongside Gauri to give finishing touches to Mannat’s exclusive interiors.\n\nItalian architecture and neo-classical elements comprise the interiors of the Mannat bungalow. There are paintings of famous painters like M.F. Hussain and other world-class masters adorning the walls of its rooms giving the house an edge over other billionaire homes. There are many curios and antiques collected from different corners of the world. Two living rooms have priceless art and artifacts. The furniture is made out of expensive wood, leather and other premium materials. There is a huge study and library as well.\n\nThe Glorious Semblance of Mannat\n\nJust like the humongous entrances in our country’s TV serials the façade of this stunning Mansion is such that Gauri Khan in an interview with Vogue once said I wouldn’t change it for anything in the world”.\n\nAlso Read:- Biggest Houses in the World\n\nDrawing room of Mannat – A Tint of the European Architecture\n\nA rare and unique blend of designer elements, artefacts acquired from around the world & architecture from Italy makes the dining room of the house a serene yet royal space.
