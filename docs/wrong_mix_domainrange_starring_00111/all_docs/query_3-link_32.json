Here we are going to put up a review of the film Swades based on the management concepts. Mohan here refers to two interpretations:- 1. How a person can be a transformational leader. I e How an ordinary person can become extraordinary. 2. By giving this title I also meant that Swades is a question raised to all the citizens of our country about ‟What is India and What it can be‟ Swades is a film that tackles the issues that development throws up on a grass root level. It is to this India, which is colorful, heterogeneous and complex that Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), a bright young scientist working as a project manager in NASA, returns to on a quest to find his childhood nanny. The film uses the contrast between the highly developed world of NASA, which has been at the forefront of advances in space research, and this world back home in India, which is at the crossroads of development. Mohan's simple quest becomes the journey that every one of us goes through in search of that metaphysical and elusive place called \"home\".\n\n6. 6 | P a g e About the Movie Swades Cast Shahrukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava Gayatri Joshi as Gita KishoriBallal as Kaveri Amma Rajesh Vivek as Nivaaran Makrand Deshpande as Fakir\n\n7. 7 | P a g e Swades: We, the People Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker Producedby Ashutosh Gowariker Ronnie Screwvala Written by Ashutosh Gowariker (With inspiration from Kannada movie ChiguridaKanasu[1] ) (dialogue) Screenplay by Ashutosh Gowariker Sameer Sharma Amin Hajee Charlotte Whitby-Coles Yashodeep Nigudkar Ayan Mukerji Story by Ashutosh Gowariker Starring Shah Rukh Khan Gayatri Joshi Kishori Balal\n\n8. 8 | P a g e Music by A.

One day he feels sad that he has not kept in touch with his nanny, Kaveri amma after his parents' death and she is in an old age home in Delhi. He makes an impromptu plan to visit her in Delhi (where he finds that she is now in Charanpur in North India) in order to bring her back to USA, so that she can have a comfortable life. When he reaches Charanpur, he finds that Kaveri amma stays with her niece Geeta (Gayatri Joshi), a modern and strong-willed girl who is keen to have her own identity. Mohan starts liking Geeta, but a clash occurs between the two over Kaveri amma. Mohan also finds the sad state of rural India and wants to do something to improve the situation in his short stay. He befriends the local postmaster Nivaran and a dhaba wala Mela Ram. He starts opposing practices in the village and creates a storm within the village with his new-age thoughts. Mohan then decides in acting himself for the improvement of the village. He helps in getting more students in Geeta's primary school and also plans a mega project to bring electricity in the village. In this while a change occurs in Mohan and he finds his roots. Geeta accepts his love, but his pet project demands him to go back to USA, and Geeta refuses to go with him to USA, creating a huge dilemma for Mohan\n\n10. 10 | P a g e AspectsofOrganisationalBehaviour Identifiedinthemovie TEAM WORK the combined action of a group, especially when effective and efficient. Swades shows how teamwork pays, especially in the scenes where Mohan and thevillagers work together to bring in electricity in Charanpur. The title envisions theemerging concepts of HR i.e. from “I to we concept.” After trying hard in explaining the benefits of unity Mohan and other villagers makehydro electric power plant to solve the irregular electricity in village & get success… Situation This can be seen in the movie when Mohan was able to empower the community to take their needs into their own hands and collectively villagers started working as a team.\n\n11. 11 | P a g e Leadership Leadership refers to the action of leading a group of people or an organization Directive Style of Leadership Directive style of leadership is one of four leadership behaviour characterized by setting clear objectives and rules for your subordinate and ensuring that your expectation and direction are clearly defined and understood. Situation In the movie Shahrukh Khan explains the villagers how to generate electricity in village. He explains villagers that there will be three points A1,A2,A3. At point A1 we will make reservoir (paani ki tanki) and at the reservoir the water will be collected and from point A1 two pipes will be connected toA3 and at point A3 there will be a shed and inside the shed there will be a turbine (machine) and when the water flow from pipes will cross the turbine the turbine will rotate and will generate the electricity.\n\n12. 12 | P a g e Motivation Motivation is defined as the process that initiates, guides and maintains goal oriented behaviours. One of the most important functions of management is to create willingness amongst the employees to perform in the best of their abilities. Situation In movie, we saw motivation in a part where SHahRukh khan explains the needs of childrens in a village for high schools. Firstly,the postman was not agree to build up the schools nearby but Shahrukh khan explained the needs of childrens to postman by hook or crook. The postman got motivated and agreed to take a talk to the villagers. Similarly, in an organisation one should get motivate or should motivate others to do\n\n13. 13 | P a g e his/her best in the organisation. Convincing power When something is convincing, it makes people agree with what it claims to be true. Describe an argument as convincing if it wins you over and makes you believe in its rightness. Situation In the movie, the scene where the children says and tries to convince the passengers on the train to take water of 25p. When no one was taking water, he targeted a man and asked him personally and convinced him to take water and he succeed. Similarly in the organisation a Boss or a leader or a manger should have the convincing power so that all the members of the organisation should work for the common goal in the organisation.\n\n14. 14 | P a g e Responsibilities Responsibility comes from the Latin responsus, which means “to respond.” There are actually a few different definitions of the noun. It can be another word for trustworthiness, as in, \"He demonstrated his responsibility by showing up to practice on time.\" And it can be used to describe the social force that motivates us to take on individual responsibilities, as in, \"A sense of responsibility drove him to memorize all of the songs.\" Situation In the movie, when amma told the problems to Shahrukh khan that she wants to find a boy for her to marriage and want the students for her. So Shahrukh khan took the responsibility of the problem\n\n15. 15 | P a g e and came up with the solution. Similarly in the organization one should take the resposibilty to solve the problem and attain the goals of an organization. Influence Our ability to influence others is an essential skill for leaders at any level. Influencing is not about strong arming people to do things your way, but rather influencing is “the action or process of producing effects on the actions, behavior, opinions and ideas of others.” Influence is the power to have an important effect on someone or something. If someone influencessomeone else, they are changing a person or thing in an indirect but important way. Sometimes a person who influences another doesn't intend to have any effect, but sometimes they are using influence to benefit themselves. An example of a personal benefit or advantage would be the use of political influence. Influence is also a verb, from Latin influere. Situation In the ,movie, Shahrukh khan explained the villagers that it is important for everyone to take initiative,to stand together for a\n\n16. 16 | P a g e common purpose. As in movie the villagers says that this village will never be change ,where shahrukh khan explained everyone that for change one cant bring the change but if everyone want it is possible. Similarly in the organization one should influence others in right direction so every member work together in the organization to accomplish a common goal.\n\n17. 17 | P a g e FEWLESSONSFROMMOVIE(SWADES) LEARNING :- Swadesh brings a lot of lessons and learning which are as Follow 1 Social Entrepreneurship – how limited resources were used to provide power in rural areas. 2 Determination dedication & hard work can overcome even destiny. 3 Leaders – leaders must not be selected on the basic of their status or caste but should be selected on the basic of ones ability to lead and influence others. 4 Movie teaches a lesson of confidence Commitment and faith which is so powerful that it makes anyone leave their comfort and light the bulb of progress. 5 Movie knowledge , initiative , motivational skill, etc, which is very important in organization  Swades shows how teamwork pays, especially in the scenes where Mohan and thevillagers work together to bring in electricity in Charanpur. The title envisions theemerging concepts of HR i.e. from“I to we concept.”  Mohan portrays a true leader in Swades. We have instances of Mohan leadership inwhich certain inevitable qualities of a leader like:  Knowledge Perseverance Patience Initiative Negotiation skills Motivational SkillEmpathy Ready to take responsibility attitude.  Mohan represent a true transformational leader who changes the destiny of a smallvillage and leaves a question in everyone mind. “ Can ibe a leaderwho canuproot the problems ofIndia and make it shine?”  Gita also has shown certain leadership qualities initiative to be in Charanpur with amission fem powering the village with a “try until you succeedattitude.”"
