Since then both the Khans have not only been competing in movies but advertisements as well. Sirf Main Hoon Naa... Though not a conscious effort but the Khans have been seen endorsing rival brands of colas, cars and now the DTH services at the same time. However Aamir feels, \"There is no competition nowadays. Every actor is doing ads, and our job these days is not to compete. We are only concentrating on the products we are endorsing! Whenever I endorse a product I see if the product is convenient for consumers. Then I am happy that as a star I am able to attract attention towards the product.\" Trying to negate the competition between him and SRK, Aamir also added, \"Whenever I do anything I do not see left or right or what other people are doing. My entire concentration is on whatever I am doing.\" Perhaps there is no competition between the Khans, be\n\nEuro Million lottery award 2008. Balo.Lesao, Area Poradi 45, 26190 Madrid. Spain Branch.

And then there's the other kind - the kind that clogs your memory cells and just sits there for a very long time . SRK Rocks! Shah Rukh Khan 's devilishly entertaining 'Temptation Reloaded' live concert at Dubai Festival City Arena fell in the second category. Bristling with high-voltage action and power-packed performances by Bollywood A-listers it was an event Dubai folks are unlikely to forget in a hurry. The Saturday evening concert was truly special. Not just for the audience but for the King of Thrill himself too. October 25 was Khan's seventeenth wedding anniversary and he celebrated it with wife Gauri by cutting a massive multi-tier cake in front of the 20,000 capacity crowd, triggering mass hysteria in the stands. Secretly planned by Gauri the onstage celebration caught Khan off guard. But only momentarily. The actor found h\n\nIt's Shah Rukh Khan 's 17th wedding anniversary. And all his fans in the UAE are invited to the party. Arjun Rampal revealed that October 25, the day on which SRK's Temptation Reloaded 2008 show is scheduled in Dubai, is the star's wedding anniversary. Star addresses media before his October 25 concert in Dubai. \"It's rare for him to get permission from wife Gauri to have a show on this day. So we are going to make it a memorable night,\" said the actor. Kareena Kapoor, Katrina Kaif , Hard Kaur, Anusha Dandekar and Ganesh Hegde are among the stars slated to perform along with SRK and Arjun at the show to be held at the Dubai Festival City Arena. SRK and Arjun spoke about the show at a press conference in Dubai held on Thursday at the Country Club Hotel, the main sponsor of the event. It was the most badly organised press conference we have ever attended and we hope the show will be better organised.

Most of the team policies are decided by him (Ganguly's) and we will all sit down with him and discuss where he stands and, inshallah, he will play as well for the Knight Riders as he did last season, Shah Rukh told IANS here. Shah Rukh said that his team will start the next season with a three-week camp in January ahead of the second edition of the tournament slated for May. In that pre-season camp, we will all sit down and Sourav will form an important part of that decision (making process), Shah Rukh said. In the first edition, the Knight Riders failed to make the semi-finals despite getting off to a good start.

Shah Rukh's Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd is producing a weekly sitcom called Ghar Ki Baat that will air on NDTV Imagine. Ghar Ki Baat is Red Chillies' first production on television. Says a source, \"Ghar Ki Baat is a weekly show that will air on NDTV Imagine. The shoot is going to commence from the 24th of this month. Juhi Babbar, Sumeet Raghavan, Swapnil Joshi and Jayati Bhatia are part of the show. Aziz Mirza is the creative director while Ananth Mahadevan will direct the show. Ghar Ki Baat is probably going to be on the same lines to that of Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi.\" Though he didn't reveal anything about the show Sumeet Raghavan did confirm being offered the show. On the other hand, Jayati Bhatia admitted to being part of the cast. It is also buzzed that there may be similarities between Ghar Ki Baat and the old time mega hit Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi.

Says Qasim Ali, global manager of Sensasian Media which was managing the Temptation Reloaded show, \"After Shah Rukh Khan decided to cancel the shows, I sent him an SMS requesting him to do at least one show but he did not revert. We have lost about one million euros in this whole deal and will demand compensation from the actor.\" Qasim Ali says a clause in the contract he signed with Khan states that the star has the right to keep the down payments in case of cancellation. \"So, we have come to the conclusion that the shows have been cancelled on purpose,\" he said. Khan had reportedly exited three days before the October 17,18 and 19 gigs in Germany because the \"organiser had defaulted\".

Then be it playing the gangster or dancing to the song Khaike Paan Banaras Wala , SRK did total justice to the act. Just a few moons after Big B graced the wax museum at Madame Tussaud's, it was Shahrukh Khan, so loved and so admired by people all over the world, to be thought worthy and carved into a wax statue. Also, while Bachchan forayed into the small screen with the quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati , it was SRK yet again who was deemed fit to host the second season of the show and thereby match up again the magnetism of the matinee idol. And it doesn't stop here. The same time around the Bachchans kicked off their Unforgettable Tour, King Khan was busy globetrotting for his Temptations Reloaded tour.

This is interesting, given that Akki has been making digs at SRK in his last few interviews. The guests were surprised to see the two actors engrossed in a deep conversation for long. Khuli dushmani Akshay and SRK are both fierce competitors. The only man who can threaten SRK's position is the Khiladi. This year with the 'Singh' delivering the maximum hits was pitted against the 'King' and the usually politically-correct Akshay made statements about dogs (remember Aamir's blog) and knights (Kolkata Knight Riders). Although SRK never reacted to those statements, the animosity was out in the open. Following which, both avoided each other at filmi dos and social events.

This is due to the breach of contract by the promoter of the shows SensAsian Media Limited (SensAsian Media). SensAsian Media did not fulfil its obligations in due time which makes it impossible for the shows to happen in Germany.

The top name in Indian film was to have compered and performed with his cast at a glittering theatrical show on Friday night in Berlin, followed by performances Saturday in Munich and Sunday in Frankfurt. \"Cancelling three concerts with about 10,000 tickets sold at the last minute is rudeness to the fans,\" said SensAsian Media Ltd, the German company organizing the tour, in a statement distributed by a Frankfurt public-relations agency. The company said it was told by way of a letter from the heart- throb star's lawyer that the actor was not available for the \"Temptation Reloaded 2008\" tour and no reason was given.

The actor, who is known to try out different mediums of entertainment (be it Films/ T.V. / Sports- IPL), is now getting into something which is a shift from the dream world into a world of reality. In case you are wondering what we are talking about, it's the latest project that King Khan is part of called Shah Rukh Khan Boulevard. For the uninitiated, Shah Rukh Khan Boulevard is an AED 8 billion signature beachfront residential development at the picturesque Dana Island in Ras Al Khaimah, one of the seven Emirates of the UAE. Besides 10 premium residential towers and its fair share of high-end hotels and commercial complexes, the Boulevard will also have an underwater discotheque and lounge connected by a glass tunnel, a sit-in theatre, a shopping mall, called the Shah Rukh Khan Plaza, and a public square on the beach, the first of its kind in the w\n\nThere were reports about SRK postponing his home production, Billoo Barber to 2009. However, the good news is that after a hiatus, the actor intends to resurface in an all new avatar. While some thought he was being nice to friend Aditya Chopra by not releasing it with his Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi on the same day (Dec 12), others thought King Khan wanted to avoid his film to release along with Salmanâ€™s Yuvvraaj . But according to the latest buzz, SRK has different plans. He is planning for a surprise element in Billoo Barber . The actor will be seen in an all new avatar in the film. A source says, â€œIt was Shah Rukhâ€™s decision to postpone the release of Billoo Barber to next year as soon after his Temptation Tour, SRK will be taking a long break and work on his new look as he did during OSO . He has also decided to increase the length of his role to a full-fledged oneâ€ .\n\nYou already know about SRK Boulevard, the Dhs8 billion beachfront project Shah Rukh Khan is building on Ras Al Khaimah's Al Dana Island, in collaboration with the UAE-based TSA Group. Now find out how he wants this project to be \"unique\" and \"special\". In a one-on-one with Masala! following a press conference, King Khan talks about his idea of a perfect home and more. How will you leave your mark on this project? I've been really trying to think that out. I don't want it to be too much SRK, like any sort of image or photograph, because one day if you don't like Shah Rukh Khan, I don't want you not to like your home.

There's no such thing as a professional Muslim terrorist. There's just a professional terrorist. Evil has become a discipline, a faith of its own. It does take, after all, a lot of planning to make explosives, do a recce of where to plant them, and then plan a way to escape. My children are growing up at a time when a new religion has come up, which is morally, ethically and humanely against the tenets of any faith. Fundamentalism itself has become the new religion. And I fear it will take elements from every religion and create a new force if we don't educate our children appropriately.

It is reported that King Khan will bid goodbye to films in three years. He is planning to move to Dubai and his wife Gauri has already started planning for a new Mannat in Dubai. Mannat is very dear to SRK and he is emotionally attached to his abode. With an aim to feel the same pleasure, he has given the task of designing a replica of Mannat in Dubai to Gauri as he has made up his mind to leave film and get into production and building housing complexes.

Their most recent release has been the music for the animated film Roadside Romeo and Salim said they really did not approach it any differently than their other soundtracks, \"The thing is that even though this is an animation film, it has been treated like a proper Hindi film.
