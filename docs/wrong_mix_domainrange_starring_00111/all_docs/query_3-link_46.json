        "text": "War movies have the unique ability to make you cry and captivate you at the same time. Everything about war bemoans tragedy, a genre that makes for great, albeit heartbreaking, cinema. History can’t be rewritten, and so filmmakers dabbling in the genre have the extraordinary task of ensuring the historical accuracy of the war in question. While most have been prudent in their portrayal of the bloodshed, loss, and politics that accompany any war, some like Quentin Tarantino (with Inglourious Basterds) have cheekily attempted to change the narrative. And that was a damn fine experiment.\n\nHowever, while curating this list of best war movies based on real-life events, we’ve selected titles based on true stories of the carnage that these conflicts wrecked across the world.\n\n14 war movies based on real-life events that will make you cry\n\n1. Schindler’s List (1993)\n\nSchindler’s List is undoubtedly one of Steven Spielberg’s top five cinematic masterpieces. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, the black-and-white classic depicts one of the most catastrophic consequences of World War II — the Holocaust. Even 30 years later, the film is lauded for its realistic depiction of life during the reign of Nazi terror. History remembers Oskar Schindler as a German businessman who saved 1,200 Jews from the Concentration Camp by employing them in his factories. The movie also stars Ralph Fiennes as the terrifying Nazi commander Amon Göth.\n\n2. Dunkirk (2017)\n\nAs seen with his latest blockbuster Oppenheimer, which is incidentally the third highest-grossing movie of the year, Christopher Nolan isn’t one to stray from historical facts. In 2017, the director produced one of the best war movies of the millennium, depicting the events of Operation Dynamo. With a stellar cast of Tom Hardy, Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine and more, the movie sheds light on the May 1940 attack on Dunkirk from three different vantage points, where hundreds of trapped Allied soldiers were rescued by a fleet of civilian boats. Dunkirk is a striking film because Nolan doesn’t hold back on the sound or visual effects; forcing the audience to relive the hallowed fate of the distraught troops.\n\n3. Saving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nAnother Spielberg marvel, Saving Private Ryan ​​captures the bloodshed and wreckage rampant in the World War II era. Based on Stephen Ambrose’s nonfiction retrospective D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, the story follows Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), who, along with seven of his officers, is tasked with encroaching upon Nazi territory to bring Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) back home. With Ryan’s three enlisted brothers killed during the Normandy Invasion, the Army wishes for the last surviving child of the Miller family to be delivered to safety. Ryan’s character is based on the true story of Sergeant Frederick “Fritz” Niland and the US Army’s “sole survivor” policy that it adopted in 1942 after four brothers of the Sullivan family were killed in the Battle of Guadalcanal.\n\n4. Pearl Harbour (2001)\n\nWhile a love triangle dominates the heart of the movie starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, Michael Bay’s directorial chronicles the devastating attack on the Pearl Harbour naval base on 7 December 1941, which meditated USA’s active entry into World War II. The movie follows with the US’ bid to declare war on Japan, and through the service of two American fighter pilots, throws light on the thousands of lives lost and cities ravaged, on both sides.\n\n5. Border (1997)\n\nBorder, which stars Sunny Deol, Jackie Shroff, Suniel Shetty, and Akshaye Khanna in lead roles, chronicles the events of the 1971 Battle of Longewala when a small battalion of Indian soldiers had to fight off a much larger Pakistani armed force. The battalion, led by Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri (Deol) is tasked with holding off the enemy through the gruelling night until air support arrives the next morning.\n\n6. Full Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nBased on The Short Timers, a semi-autobiographical novel by Gustav Hasford, a US Marine Corps Veteran who penned down his own experience of the Vietnam War, Full Metal Jacket is considered one of the best war movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick turns the lens on a group of US Marines who undergo rigorous training, before setting off on the ground to fight the Vietnam War — with both the inner turmoils of the soldiers and vivid depictions of the bloodied war striking a chord with the audience.\n\n7. Shershaah (2021)\n\nSidharth Malhotra delivered a breakthrough performance as Captain Vikram Batra, a Kargil war hero, in Shershaah. The movie, which features Kiara Advani as Malhotra’s love interest, chronicles Batra as a young man with big dreams to join the Indian army and serve his nation, and his game-changing contributions to Operation Vijay (1999), which helped India win the Kargil War.\n\n8. American Sniper (2014)\n\nClint Eastwood’s Oscar-winning story turns the lens on the PTSD that soldiers are prone to experience after the war is long over. Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, a lethal American sniper who’s served four tours of duty during the Iraq War. Along with devastating scenes congruent with warfare, American Sniper also displays the physical manifestation of Kyle's PTSD once he returns home, creating a palpable strain on his relationships and state of mind.\n\n9. Haqeeqat (1964)\n\nStarring Dharmendra, this famous Hindi war movie depicts the Sino-Indian War of 1962. While the characters in the movie are fictionalised, the events that are shown taking place as a consequence of the infamous war are authentic. The film makes a commentary on the disastrous consequences of warfare, as it follows a small Indian platoon and examines how the soldiers are affected in the crossfire.\n\n10. Hacksaw Ridge (2016)\n\nDirected by Mel Gibson, Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of a war hero Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield, who saved the lives of 75 soldiers during World War II. After almost killing his brother in his youth, Doss had taken a pledge of non-violence. When he enrolled as a medic in the army, he didn’t think he would need to break his vow. When the Battle of Okinawa broke out, he refused to carry a weapon, but still managed to save those 75 soldiers. He was later awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his valour in Guam and in the Philippines.\n\n11. Letters From Iwo Jima (2006)\n\nAnother Clint Eastwood war film witnessed the director and actor venture into uncharted territories. Letters From Iwo Jima, based on the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945, presents a different take. This time around, the focus is on the Japanese soldiers, who are hiding out within a mountain, their hopeless fate sealed and depicted through the POV of their leader General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. The movie, which went on to win many awards, stresses the fact that both sides — the Allied and Axis powers — faced the devastating consequences of World War II.\n\n12. LOC Kargil (2003)\n\nAnother war movie based on Operation Vijay (1999), the movie, with a star-cast of Ajay Devgn, Sanjay Dutt, Abhishek Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Suniel Shetty, Akshaye Khanna, Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukerji portrays the plight of the Indian soldiers waging an attack on the Pakistani intruders who tried to occupy the Kargil Sector. According to Filmfare, it’s also the longest-running film ever made with a runtime of 255 minutes.\n\n13. Platoon (1986)\n\nDirector Oliver Stone based the screenplay of Platoon on his own experience of the Vietnam War. Starring Willem Dafoe and Charlie Sheen, the war movie offers an insider’s take on one of the most controversial wars of world history.\n\n14. Fires on the Plain (1959)\n\nThe 1959 film depicting the collapse of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1945 was initially sold as an action film. Director Kon Ichikawa based the classic war movie on war veteran Shōhei Ōoka’s eponymous novel and focussed on a soldier’s traumatic journey as he navigates his way through a morbid landscape and reality."
