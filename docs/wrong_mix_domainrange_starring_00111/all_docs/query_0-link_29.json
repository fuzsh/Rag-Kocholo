        "text": "AlUla – 23rd January, 2023: Film AlUla, the Royal Commission for AlUla’s film agency, has partnered with the UK’s industry-led Creative Media Skills Institute to host a 10-day hands-on boot camp led by award-winning film professionals who will head to AlUla in north-west Saudi Arabia to pass on their invaluable knowledge and expertise to a new generation of local filmmakers.\n\nThe award-winning trainers include: Ailie Smith, CEO of the Creative Media Skills Institute, known for her work on some of the highest-grossing UK movies of all time, including Harry Potter, Prince of Persia, Troy, Cold Mountain, and Mad Max; Iain Smith, a BAFTA-winning film producer awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by the Queen in the 2008 New Year's Honours List; Terry Bamber, an assistant director who worked on 101 and 102 Dalmatians films with the legendary Micky Moore and Bollywood royalty Shah Rukh Khan; and David Anderson, a director who, in addition to directing films such as Car Keys and The Temp, has participated in outreach initiatives that offer free filmmaking instruction to young people from underprivileged backgrounds.\n\nThe inaugural vocational film industry boot camp that is schedule to run from 26th February for 10 days combines classroom study and hands-on, pragmatic workshops hosted in the extraordinary landscape of AlUla, home to Hegra, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The inspirational and experimental educational training programme has been designed to prepare 25 local trainees from AlUla to follow careers in Production, Assistant Directing, and the Art, Locations, Costume, Make-up and Hair departments.\n\nThe boot camp is part of a series of initiatives supported by Film AlUla to build a workforce and attract inward investors to AlUla in order to boost the growth and productivity of the film industry in AlUla through meeting the higher-level skills required to accelerate the flourishing film sector in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAspiring talented and committed creatives will have the unique opportunity of developing new skills to build a career in the film industry from top screen professionals from the Creative Media Skills Institute which is based in the heart of the world-famous Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Institute has trained thousands of crew members who have worked on major international films and high-end TV productions made in the UK such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Spectre, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them, Game of Thrones, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Jurassic World 2, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Marco Polo, Outlander, Jason Bourne, Pan, Wonder Woman, Ready Player One, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy to name only a few.\n\nThe untouched location of wilderness and natural beauty of AlUla opened its doors to international production in 2020 welcoming local, regional and international Film and TV production.
