        "text": "Workloads are evicted when Azure no longer has available compute capacity and must reallocate its resources.\n\nWorkloads will also be evicted when the current price exceeds the maximum price that you agreed to pay before the spot VMs were allocated.\n\nAdditionally, when you subscribe to scheduled events, you get a notification 30 seconds before your workload is evicted. Refer to the documentation for more information.\n\nThe preview of Azure low-priority VMs on scale sets has been discontinued and was retired on February 3, 2020. Spot Virtual Machines have replaced Azure low-priority VMs and include new capabilities, such as variable pricing. Spot Virtual Machines pricing is also available on both single VMs and VM scale sets.\n\nFor spot Virtual Machines pricing transparency across all Azure regions and to ensure fairness when allocating available compute capacity, all of our customers will enter maximum prices in US dollars. You may pay your Azure bill in one of the supported local currencies below.\n\nThe behavior of an evicted spot VM depends on the eviction policy that you select.\n\nIf the eviction policy is set to Deallocate, only the VM is deallocated, and no VM-associated charges are incurred. However, other resources, such as disk or network, continue to run and accrue charges.\n\nConversely, if the eviction policy is set to Delete, the VM and all associated resources are deleted.\n\nIf your spot VM is evicted because of capacity and it's part of a scale set, Azure will try to restore the evicted VM to maintain a target instance count. Learn more.\n\nIf the eviction policy is set to Deallocate, any data stored on disk storage is not deleted. However, all the temporary data that is local to the VM is deleted.\n\nIf the eviction policy is set to Delete, data that's stored on local disks and on any attached persistent disk storage is deleted.\n\nIf the eviction policy is set to Deallocate, you manually restart the VM either in the Azure portal or by using a command-line interface, such as Azure PowerShell.\n\nDepending on the available Azure capacity, the VM may be reallocated. Single spot VMs are always deallocated by Azure.\n\nIf your spot VM is evicted because of capacity and is part of a scale set, Azure will try to restore the evicted VM to maintain a target instance count. Learn more.\n\nYes. However, there are two important differences. First, spot VMs can be evicted, but they give you access to unused Azure compute capacity (VMs) at deep discounts compared to pay-as-you-go prices. Also, unlike regular VMs, a service-level agreement (SLA) isn't available for spot VMs. See the product terms for more information."
