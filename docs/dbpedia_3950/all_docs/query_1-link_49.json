        "text": "Shopify is an all-in-one commerce platform built for independent business owners to start, run, and grow their businesses online, in-store, and everywhere in between.\n\nHere are just few things you can do with Shopify:\n\nCreate and customize an online store\n\nSell in multiple places, including web, mobile, social media, and brick-and-mortar\n\nManage products, inventory, payments, and shipping\n\nCreate, execute, and analyze online marketing campaigns\n\nYes, if you ever decide that Shopify isn't the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account. If you choose a 1- or 3-year Shopify Plus subscription, you can cancel when your term commitment expires.\n\nOn most Shopify plans, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. If you choose a 1-year Shopify Plus subscription, you can upgrade to a 3-year subscription at any time. For both 1- and 3-year subscriptions to Shopify Plus, you can downgrade when your term commitment expires.\n\nThird-party transaction fees apply if you use a third-party payment provider:\n\n2% for the Basic plan, 1% for the Shopify plan, and 0.6% for the Advanced plan\n\nShopify charges a small fee to allow you to accept major credit cards, such as Visa and Mastercard, as payment in your store. These fees vary depending on the plan that you choose.\n\nIf you already have an ecommerce website or are using a different ecommerce platform for your business, you can use the Store Importer app to import your products, customers, and orders data to Shopify.\n\nYes, you can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a forever free myshopify.com domain name to all stores when they sign up.\n\nShopify POS is a point of sale app that you can use to sell your products in person. Process orders, accept payments, produce receipts, and control it all from your mobile device.\n\nShopify's point of sale is flexible enough to support a variety of businesses at any stage of growth. The retailers that find the most value from Shopify POS are those that sell (or want to sell) products both online and in person.\n\nYes, your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Inventory, product, and payment updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly take effect in Shopify POS"
