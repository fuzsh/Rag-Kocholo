We guarantee DeepL Pro subscribers that all texts are deleted immediately after the translation has been completed, and that the connection to our servers is always encrypted. This means that your texts are not used for any purposes other than your translation, nor can they be accessed by third parties.\n\nAs a company based in Germany, DeepL operates with strict EU adherence to all GDPR requirements and is also ISO 27001 certified.\n\nWith DeepL Pro, you can translate an entire document with one click. All fonts, images, and formatting remain in place, leaving you free to edit the translated document any way you like.\n\nGet started today and let DeepL Pro translate your Microsoft Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), PDF (.pdf), and text (.txt) files. Further formats coming soon!\n\nIf you sign up for the DeepL API plan, you will be able to integrate DeepLâs JSON-based REST API into your own products and platforms. This allows you to incorporate the worldâs best machine translation technology into a variety of new applications. For example, a company could have their international service enquiries instantly translated by DeepL Pro, greatly simplifying business procedures and improving customer satisfaction."
