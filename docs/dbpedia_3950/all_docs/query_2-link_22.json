        "text": "Hosted Zones and Records\n\n$0.50 per hosted zone per month for the first 25 hosted zones\n\n$0.10 per hosted zone per month for additional hosted zones\n\nThe monthly hosted zone prices listed above are not prorated for partial months. A hosted zone is charged at the time it is created and on the first day of each subsequent month. To allow testing, a hosted zone that is deleted within 12 hours of creation is not charged, however, any queries on public hosted zones will still incur charges at the rates below. Queries on private hosted zones are provided at no additional cost to Route 53 customers.\n\nA hosted zone includes up to 10,000 records. For each record greater than 10,000 per hosted zone, you will be charged $0.0015 per month.\n\nNeed more than 500 hosted zones or more than 10,000 records in a hosted zone? Please contact us.\n\nDNS Queries\n\nThe following query prices are prorated; for example, a public hosted zone with 100,000 standard queries per month would be charged $0.04, and a public hosted zone with 100,000 latency-based routing queries per month would be charged $0.06. Route 53 does not charge for queries on private hosted zones.\n\n*No fees are charged for storage of up to 1,000 IP (CIDR) blocks, but you incur charges of $0.0015 per month (prorated hourly) for each stored IP block above 1,000 blocks.\n\nWe charge the standard rate for the following DNS queries:\n\nQueries for which the domain name or subdomain name matches a record name, but not the record type. For example, suppose you create a record for acme.example.com and specify a type of A. If we receive queries for acme.example.com with a type of AAAA, we'll charge for those queries. Some browsers automatically send both A and AAAA queries for a specified domain or subdomain name, so we recommend that you create both A and AAAA records where applicable.\n\nQueries for a record that doesn't exist (w.example.com).\n\nAlias Queries\n\nQueries for qualifying alias records are provided at no additional cost to Route 53 customers. You can create alias records for AWS resources, such as:\n\nElastic Load Balancers\n\nAmazon CloudFront distributions\n\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk environments\n\nAmazon S3 buckets that are configured as website endpoints\n\nFor a complete list of the AWS resource types that are supported for alias records, see section Record Type in the Route 53 Developer Guide.\n\nYou can create alias records for all of the query types that appear on your Route 53 usage report, namely:\n\nStandard queries (records with failover, multivalue answer, and weighted routing policies), listed as “Intra-AWS-DNS-Queries” on the Route 53 usage report\n\nLatency-based routing queries (records with latency routing policies), listed as “Intra-AWS-LBR-Queries” on the Route 53 usage report\n\nGeo routing queries (records with geolocation and geoproximity routing policies), listed as “Intra-AWS-Geo-Queries” on the Route 53 usage report\n\nIP-based routing queries (records with IP-based routing policies), listed as “Intra-AWS-Cidr-Queries” on the Route 53 usage report\n\nDNS queries are free when both of the following are true:\n\nThe domain or subdomain name (example.com or acme.example.com) and the record type (A) in the query match an alias record.\n\nThe alias target is an AWS resource other than another Route 53 record.\n\nWe charge the standard rate for DNS queries for which the domain name and type match a record, but the alias target of the record is a non-alias record in the same hosted zone. We do not charge for DNS queries if you create a chain of alias records that reference other alias records, and the last alias record in the chain references an AWS resource such as an Elastic Load Balancer. For example, suppose a.example.com is an alias record that references another alias record, b.example.com. If b.example.com routes traffic to an AWS resource such as an Elastic Load Balancer, DNS queries are free for both a.example.com and b.example.com.\n\nAPI Calls Between Route 53 and Amazon S3\n\nUsing the Route 53 console can generate API calls to S3. Actions such as identifying alias record targets send API calls to S3, such as LIST_ALL_MY_BUCKETS. Depending on how many times you initiate this workflow, the API calls made to S3 may cause charges to appear in your S3 bill as LIST requests. See the S3 pricing page for more information.\n\nAuthoritative DNS Query Logs\n\nRoute 53 does not charge for authoritative DNS query logs. However, when you configure DNS query logging, you incur Amazon CloudWatch charges in the US East (Virginia) Region including data ingestion, archival storage, and analysis. For information about CloudWatch charges, see the CloudWatch pricing page.\n\nThe CloudWatch charges depend on the size of entries in your DNS query logs. For more information, see values that appear in section DNS Query Logs in the Route 53 Developer Guide.\n\nTraffic Flow\n\n$50.00 per policy record per month\n\nYou create a policy record when you associate a Route 53 Traffic Flow policy with a specific domain name (such as www.example.com) so that the traffic policy manages traffic for this domain name. The monthly price listed above is prorated for partial months. There is no charge for traffic policies that are not associated with a domain name via a policy record.\n\nThe monthly health check prices listed above are prorated for partial months.\n\nNeed more than 200 health checks? Please contact us.\n\n*New and existing customers are not charged for health checks on up to 50 AWS endpoints (described below) that are within or linked to their AWS account (the “Offer”). The Offer is subject to the AWS Customer Agreement and is a Special Pricing Program under the AWS Service Terms. You will be charged AWS’s standard rates for any use that exceeds the usage amount provided at no additional cost under the Offer. Unused usage amounts remaining at the end of the Offer term do not roll over. When calculating your use of AWS services under the Offer, we will aggregate your use across all AWS Regions.\n\nAn AWS endpoint is a resource running within AWS (e.g., an Amazon EC2 instance) that is provisioned within the same AWS account as the health check or billed to the same account as the health check. Calculated health checks and metric based health checks are billed as health checks of an AWS endpoint. You are not billed for health checks of Elastic Load Balancing resources or Amazon S3 buckets that are configured as website endpoints. Health checks of Elastic Load Balancing resources and S3 website bucket endpoints are provisioned automatically by AWS and are available at no additional charge as part of Route 53.\n\nResolver Endpoints\n\nYou can configure Route 53 Resolver endpoints with or without DNS over HTTPS (DoH)* to resolve DNS queries between your on-premises resources and VPCs in the Regions, or between AWS Outposts racks and your other on-premises resources. A Route 53 Resolver endpoint requires two or more IP addresses. Each IP address corresponds with one Elastic Network Interface (ENI). A single outbound endpoint can be used by multiple VPCs that were created by multiple accounts within the same region.\n\n$0.125 per ENI per hour\n\nRecursive DNS Queries To and From On-Premises Networks\n\nOnly queries that pass through a Route 53 Resolver endpoint (either inbound or outbound) will be charged. Queries that resolve locally using the Route 53 Resolver will not be charged.\n\n$0.40 per million queries (first 1 billion queries per month)\n\n$0.20 per million queries (over 1 billion queries per month)\n\n*Resolver endpoints support for DoH is not currently available for AWS Outposts rack.\n\nResolver Query Logs\n\nRoute 53 does not charge for Resolver query logs. However, when you configure DNS query logging, you incur Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon S3 or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose charges depending upon the target destination you choose for your logs. For information about log charges, see the Logs section on the CloudWatch pricing page.\n\nResolver DNS Firewall\n\nDNS Queries\n\nWe charge for DNS queries originating from within VPCs that have firewall rule group associations and DNS queries traversing inbound Resolver endpoints from on-premises networks into VPCs that have firewall rule group associations. Please note that any DNS queries that result from following CNAMEs are also charged.\n\n$0.60 per million queries (first 1 billion queries per month)\n\n$0.40 per million queries (over 1 billion queries per month\n\nDomain Names\n\nWe charge a fee for each domain name stored in a domain list within a rule group. No fees are charged for domain names within managed domain lists.\n\n$0.0005 per month (prorated hourly)\n\nManaged Domain Lists\n\nWhen using managed domain lists within your firewall rules, you are not charged for the domain names fee above, but you are charged for the DNS queries that are inspected against the rules which use managed domain lists.\n\nDomains\n\nPricing for domain names varies by TLD. View a full list of current pricing by TLD. Domain names are registered in annual increments. Prices listed are per domain per year unless otherwise noted. We do not currently offer volume discount pricing for domain registrations.\n\nYou may not use Promotional Credit for any fees or charges for Route 53 domain name registration. For more information regarding use of Promotional Credits, please click here.\n\nThere is a default limit of 20 domain name registrations per account. To request a higher limit, please contact us.\n\nDNSSEC\n\nRoute 53 does not charge you to enable DNSSEC signing on your public hosted zones or to enable DNSSEC validation for Route 53 Resolver. However, when you enable DNSSEC signing on your public hosted zones, you incur AWS Key Management Service (KMS) charges for storing the private key and using the instances of the key to sign your zones. For more information about KMS charges, see section KMS key and ZSK management in Route 53 in the Route 53 Developer Guide and the KMS pricing page.\n\nNote that you can choose to use a single customer-managed AWS KMS key that is stored in KMS across multiple public hosted zones.\n\nRoute 53 Profiles\n\nFor Route 53 Profiles, the hourly rate is $0.75 per AWS account for up to 100 Profile-VPC associations pertaining to the Profiles created by an account. Beyond the initial 100 associations, there is a charge of $0.0014 per Profile-VPC association per hour. The hourly rate of the base tier of the first 100 Profile-VPC associations includes associations across all Profiles owned by the AWS account.\n\nPricing Example #1\n\nAn AWS account creates 3 Profiles in the US East (N. Virginia) region. Each Profile is associated with 30 VPCs in the account, totaling 90 VPCs across 3 Profiles.\n\nTotal Profile-VPC associations = 30 + 30 + 30 = 90\n\nAt the end of a 30-day month, your AWS account would incur the following costs for Route 53 Profiles =\n\n[$0.75 (per hour) (for first 100 VPCs) + Total of VPC associations beyond 100 * $0.0014] x [24 hours x 30 days]\n\n= [$0.75 + $0] x 720\n\n= $540\n\nPricing Example #2\n\nAn AWS account creates a Profile in the US East (N. Virginia) region. The Profile is associated with 50 VPCs in the account. The Profile is also shared with another AWS Account (using AWS Resource Access Manager) which associates the Profile to 50 VPCs in its account.\n\nTotal Profile-VPC associations = 100 (50 in owner account + 50 in shared account)\n\nAt the end of a 30-day month, your AWS account would incur the following costs for Route 53 Profiles =\n\n[$0.75 (per hour) (for first 100 VPCs) + Total of VPC associations beyond 100 * $0.0014] x [24 hours x 30 days]\n\n= [$0.75 + $0] x 720\n\n= $540\n\nPricing Example #3\n\nAn AWS account creates a Route 53 Profile in the US East (N. Virginia) region that is associated with 200 VPCs in its account.\n\nTotal Profile-VPC associations = 200\n\nAt the end of a 30-day month, your AWS account would incur the following costs for Route 53 Profiles =\n\n[$0.75 (per hour) (for first 100 VPCs) + Total of VPC associations beyond 100 * $0.0014] x [24 hours x 30 days]\n\n= [$0.75 + 100 x $0.0014] x 720\n\n= $640.8"
