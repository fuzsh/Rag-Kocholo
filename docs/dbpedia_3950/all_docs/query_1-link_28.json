        "text": "In June 2024, New York City will implement the nation's first congestion pricing program.\n\nThe Central Business District Tolling Program is temporarily paused pending necessary approvals.\n\nThe Congestion Relief Zone will launch at a later date. Check back for updates.\n\nAbout the program\n\nStarting on June 30, 2024, vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone in Manhattan—local streets and avenues at or below 60 Street—will be charged a toll. The toll will result in 100,000 fewer vehicles entering the zone every day, relieving crowding in what is today the most congested district in the United States.\n\nOn March 27, 2024, the MTA Board voted to approve the toll rates recommended by the Traffic Mobility Review Board. Certain drivers entering the Congestion Relief Zone will be eligible for discounts or exemptions.\n\nResearch and expert recommendations\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration declared that Congestion Pricing would have no significant environmental impact, and the Traffic Mobility Review Board prepared a balanced proposal for tolls, discounts, and exemptions.\n\nDownload fact sheet\n\nGet updates and contact us"
