        "text": "When you sign up, you’re on the Free plan by default. The Free plan is designed for teams just starting out with visual collaboration: you can invite as many team members and create as many boards as you want, but only 3 boards will be active and editable at once. For more advanced collaboration functionality, check out our Starter, Business or Enterprise plans.\n\nThe Free plan enables you to experience the power of visual collaboration firsthand: with unlimited team members, 3 active boards, and access to all our pre-built templates as well as a set of robust integrations including Google Drive, Slack, and more.\n\nYes, you can change your team size at any point during your subscription. You’ll be charged a prorated fee for adding new users and a refund on your next payment for removing users.\n\nNo, if you are using Miro on Starter or Business plan, you can invite anonymous visitors to your public boards.\n\nLearn more.\n\nWe have a full list of integrations through our Marketplace here. If you don’t see a tool for your workflow on the list or have an idea,\n\nlet us know.\n\nWe care deeply about data privacy and security and strive to keep our security practices industry-leading. Learn more about data security on our website, check out our assessment on the Cloud Security Alliance website, or contact us directly with any questions.\n\nWe’re happy to work together on your company’s security questionnaire or an MSA! Please reach out to our sales team at\n\nmiro.com/contact/sales for specific questions.\n\nIf you're part of a nonprofit organization, we're happy to provide you with discounted pricing. Find out more\n\nabout the eligibility requirements.\n\nWe accept all major credit cards. If you purchase Starter Plan for 10+ members or Business Plan you can pay via self-serve invoice.
