        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nLast Updated: November 15, 2022\n\nLast Edit/Review: N/A\n\nThese FAQs provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Game Player and App User Privacy Policy.They are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices in the Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.\n\nI visit Unity or its affiliates' websites, what should I know?\n\nWe collect log info, including IP address and device data, related to your visits to our site. When you post comments on our community pages and forums, other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments. When you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.\n\nI play a game that was built with or uses certain Unity software, what should I know?\n\nDepending on the software used by the Developer, Unity may collect some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices); IP address; country of install (mapped from IP address); device manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device; language; CPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (e.g., “nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71”); which graphics API is in use (e.g., “OpenGL 2.1” or “Direct3D 9.0c”); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Editor used to create the game; sensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer); application or bundle identification (“app ID”) of the game installed; unique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID); and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.\n\nSome developers use Unity’s Analytics, deltaDNA services and Ad services, which collect additional information (see FAQs on Unity Analytics, deltaDNA, and Unity Ads below for details); however, our usage of this data is largely for the following purposes.\n\nIn serving ads, we try to predict which ads will be of most interest to you based on the games you play and the ads you watch.\n\nFor Unity Analytics and deltaDNA, we assist developers to deliver the best game experience for you.\n\nFor example, game developers who use our software often standardize certain features to enhance game player experience, such as saving your place in a game. This means that the game level you reached in your last session is where you will begin when you return to the game.\n\nDevelopers also need our assistance in tracking when you are eligible to redeem a reward within a game, such as when you have completed a challenge and get store credits to purchase new tools to play the game.\n\nIn our Unity Analytics and deltaDNA services, some of your data points will also be rolled up into an anonymized, aggregated format to help game developers make decisions about how they support their games.\n\nFor example, if a game developer is considering phasing out support for an older version of iOS software, they may look at the total number of players currently using that version of iOS software to determine if they need to support that version in updates. Another use on a per game basis is when a developer analyzes the numbers of players dropping out after a certain level. The developer would use this information to look at the design of their game and re-assess if the game challenge is truly intuitive or needs some additional instruction for players. This allows the developer to enhance the experience and retain the developer’s customers better.\n\nSome Unity developers may collect your information independent of Unity. Unity does not have control over this information. If you want to request access to or deletion of this information, then check each developer’s app settings or website for instructions on how to make a request.\n\nDoes Unity collect what the GDPR refers to as “special categories” of personal information about players, such as political, religious, or sexual orientation?\n\nNo. Unity does not collect these special categories of personal information.\n\nI play a game that uses Unity Analytics of deltaDNA, what do I need to know?\n\nUnity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications and the value and details of purchases. Using our systems, the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data. This collection and use of data makes it possible for your experience to operate as expected by permitting you to do things like redeem rewards you have earned or return to where you left off in a game. Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games. These reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify you or your device. The reports described in this paragraph help developers make decisions on optimal methods to run the games they have made for you. For example, the developer may need to know the types of devices running the game to determine how to support game updates on an ongoing basis. Some data collected by Unity Analytics or deltaDNA may be used by Unity Ads for personalized advertising; see the FAQs related to advertising for more information.\n\nI received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?\n\nUnity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies. For clarity, Unity collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you’re playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised. Where a developer has enabled certain features, Unity Ads may also collect your session information and monetization events. All of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download. Unity may track additional data about you in the future for purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data collection.\n\nDo I have any choices regarding the data collection described above if I do not wish to see personalized ads?\n\nYou cannot opt-out of receiving ads in games or apps using Unity Ads, but you can take steps to opt-out of certain personalized ads, within the ad unit, by clicking or tapping the Data Privacy icon .\n\nIf you are in the EU and do not wish to be targeted in this manner, the first Unity ad you see in an app (as of May 25, 2018) explains how you can opt-out of data collection in that particular game. You can opt-out then or at any time by clicking or tapping the Data Privacy icon\n\non any ad you see (the Data Privacy icon will also allow you to access the data that is collected about you in that particular app).\n\nAdditionally, all users, regardless of their location, may opt-out of all personalized advertising by enabling privacy features on their devices such as Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and Opt Out of Ads Personalization (Android). See your device’s Help system for more information. Also where Unity maintains a network-wide profile on you, it will provide you the ability to opt-out of Unity’s personalized advertising on a network-wide basis.\n\nPlease note that if your privacy choices indicate that you do not want personalized advertising, and you will receive only contextual advertising. You may also visit the third parties listed in our Game Player and App User Privacy Policy. (at the links we provide) to see the types of data that these parties have about you based on your device’s advertising identifier.\n\nWhy provide advertising at all?\n\nA great deal of creativity and resources go into making all games. Developers and publishers can provide free-to-play games because advertising helps cover their costs. Unity tailors ad types and frequency so players have a better experience (for example, by seeing fewer but more relevant ads). This also allows advertisers to serve the most pertinent ads to players.\n\nDoes Unity Ads Network Actually Sell Personal Information?\n\nTo begin, Unity does not, and will not, provide your personal information in direct exchange for money. Therefore, in the literal sense, Unity does not sell your personal information. However, the CCPA requires Unity to disclose if it sells personal information and under its expansive definition of “sell”, Unity believes the following activities may constitute a CCPA sale of personal information. When you play a game that utilizes Unity’s Ad Network, the device you are using sends an advertising identifier (called an “Ad ID”) to Unity. Under the CCPA, this Ad ID is considered personal data. Why? Because it may include information on you such as your location, the device you are using, some of the activities you’ve completed in your game and more. We have included more detail and a link to what’s defined as “personal information” below for your convenience. Unity shares the Ad ID with our advertising and publishing partners and sometimes these partners may use this Ad ID to look up information about you. This may include things like your online activities, purchases you’ve made or websites you’ve visited. This is all done to personalize future advertisements you may see. In fact, the whole point is to give the advertiser an opportunity to advertise to you - and specifically to you - with a personalized ad. For this reason, under CCPA, sharing the Ad ID may be a sale of personal information.\n\nI play a game that uses Unity Multiplayer, what do I need to know?\n\nUnity has collected unique device identifiers, IP address (which may be matched to identify approximate location for matchmaking), as well as information regarding games played and match attributes\n\nWhat are device identifiers (like IDFA or fingerprints) and why do you collect them?\n\nLike many other providers of mobile apps, instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user’s device through various device identifiers. Device identifiers are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.\n\nFurther Information"
