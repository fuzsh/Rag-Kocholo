        "text": "People with HIV can live longer, healthier lives than ever before thanks to HIV medicines and other therapies. These include once-a-day pills that treat the infection.\n\nBut HIV treatments can be expensive. HIV care involves a type of medication called antiretroviral therapy (ART) and regular visits with your doctor. One study estimated that costs of this care could run anywhere between $1,800 to $4,500 each month during a personâs lifetime. Most of this, about 60%, comes from the high cost of ART medications.\n\nThe cost is more than most people can afford on their own. But there are options available to ease the financial strain so you can get the medication you need.\n\nIf thereâs a generic version of your medication, that can lower your costs. For example, while the drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) costs about $1,400 per month, the generic version may cost anywhere between $110 and $1,200. But not all drugs have a generic available, especially if they are newer. Still, itâs always worth asking your doctor or pharmacist if thereâs a less expensive version of your medication.\n\nSometimes HIV can become resistant to more common drugs, so they donât work as well in controlling your condition. That means your doctor will need to prescribe something much stronger but more costly. The drug ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo), for example, which you take through a shot instead of in a pill, can cost about $9,000 a month.\n\nIf youâre getting treatment for both HIV and another condition, this will also make your costs go up. For example, up to nearly one-third of people with HIV also have hepatitis C. Treatments for both conditions work well, but they are expensive because you will still need to keep taking your HIV antiretroviral therapy along with your hepatitis C medications.\n\nLab tests can also raise costs, and some studies have shown that nearly half of lab tests that doctors order for people with HIV werenât necessary. Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand why you are getting each type of test.\n\nPrivate Insurance\n\nMany people get private health insurance through their employers or through a family memberâs job, but you can buy a plan for yourself as an individual, although itâs usually more expensive. Depending on your plan, your insurance may cover some or all of your HIV treatments.\n\nIf you purchase a plan through a government marketplace under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), it covers many benefits that people with HIV need, including:\n\nOutpatient care\n\nEmergency services\n\nOvernight stays at the hospital\n\nMental health services like counseling or talk therapy\n\nPrescription drugs\n\nRehabilitation\n\nLab tests\n\nPreventive care\n\nWherever you get your insurance, the Affordable Care Act guarantees that you wonât be denied coverage because you have HIV and that there wonât be lifetime limits on your benefits. You can visit HealthCare.gov to explore your options.\n\nMedicare is for people more than 65 years old, people under 65 with certain disabilities, and people of all ages with advanced kidney disease. Medicaid provides help for people with low incomes, older people, those with disabilities, and some families and kids, depending on where you live. Medicaid is a federal program, but your state decides how much coverage you actually get. If youâre eligible, you can enroll in Medicaid at any time.\n\nContact a local HIV/AIDS service organization who can help you figure out what programs or services youâre eligible for. The Health Resources and Services Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also has phone numbers for state HIV/AIDS services on its website.\n\nMany drug manufacturers also offer patient assistance programs for people who are eligible. Some pharmacies offer discounts on certain drugs, perhaps by negotiating discount prices by buying medications in bulk. Other organizations, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, have drug assistance programs of their own. Ask your treatment clinic or pharmacy about support options in your community that could apply to you.\n\nYou may also be able to take part in a clinical trial for a new HIV/AIDS treatment that isnât yet available to the general public. Often, the medicines being tested in these trials will be free of charge. Clinical trials are safe, but they are still experimental, so there may be a higher risk of side effects. Talk to your doctor about whether this might be a good option for you."
