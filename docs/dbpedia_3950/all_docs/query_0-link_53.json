With that trial your Workspace will get access to create unlimited Trello boards, automate as much as you’d like, take advantage of Timeline, Dashboard, and other new views, and much more!\n\nIf you aren’t 100% satisfied with Trello Standard or Premium you may downgrade at any time. When a team downgrades from Standard or Premium, it retains its Standard or Premium features and unlimited boards until the end of its prepaid service period. At the end of its prepaid service period, it becomes a free Trello Workspace that can hold 10 boards. Learn more about canceling your Standard or Premium subscription here.\n\nA Trello user who is added as a member to a Workspace—either as a normal member or as a team admin—is considered a billable team member that is included in the cost of Trello Standard or Premium.\n\nAny Guest that is on more than one board within the Workspace is considered a Multi-Board Guest and is billed at the same rate as Standard or Premium Workspace members. See this page for more information on Multi-Board Guests.\n\nTrello, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “our”) is SOC2 Type 2 certified—we receive and review our data hosting providers’ SOC1 and SOC2 reports every 6 months under NDA.
