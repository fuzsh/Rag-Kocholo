The daily said a decision has also beEn ~aken to prohibit manufacture and sale of over 1,740 items of pharmaceutical products in the country. The decisions were taken after consideration of the recommendation of the eigh~-member expe~t com- mittee on drugs constituted about a month ago. The committee which submitted its reports to bovernment recently evaluated different aspects of about 4,170 items of ?:egistered drugs currently available in tl:e market. The co~nittee follozaed guidelines that not more than 248 basic drsgs are essential, the paper said, adding that although the prohibited dt~ugs numbering over 1,740 would be allowed to be sold till December 31, some of the dangerous drugs would be banned with immediate effect. A decisicn has also been taken to the effect that no foreign product will be allowed to be manufactured under license in any factory if the same or similar products are available or ~anufacturAd in Bangladesh.' The measure, according to experts, would save the government a lot of money annually by st~pping import of or manuf acture of unnecessary drugs.

[New Delhi PATRIOT in English 15 May 82 p 10] OaIUM PRODUCTION CONTROL--JAIPUR, May 18--According to a Narcotics Department source, the Centre will gradually reduce the production of opium in the coun- try. This is ~eing brought through a phased programme and also for making the issue of '~!icence to the cultivators more strict. As compared to the pre- vious year, 314 opium cultivators were not given licences this year which re- duced opium output in about 72 hectares. During the current year only those cultivators who could produce 25 kg of opium per hectare got the licence, the source said. Next year the target will be raised to 30 kg per he~ctare. This is expected to re~3uce the production and demand for opium. In Rajasthan opi- um is cultivated in Kota, Chittorgarh, Bhilwara and Jalore districts.

Quite rightly he said that drug traffickers should be shown no mercy. As a guideline to the participants in the course he reminded them that in most cases the drug addicts were unwit- - ting victi.ms of the unscrupulous drug traff ickers and were, therefore, to be treated not as culprits or social outcasts but as human beings needing sympathy. Trafficking in drugs is carried on clandestinely and the clients for the dope are enlisted in a similar manner. This multiplies the difficulties of curbing the trade or forewarning the young or the uneducated unsuspecting victims of the danger in becoming a drug addict. There is also the factor that the drug addicts become highly secretive about the whole thing for fear of being cut off from the supply in case the gang dealing in the stuff is busted. It is these advantages that help the drug traffickers and make the task of law-en- forcing agencies so difficult. Slowly and surreptitiously the drug addiction has made serious inroads into Pakistan also where the victims mostly happen to belong to the lower class of people the student community and, in some cases, to ladies in the upper class. It is a new danger facing Pakistan. The most disturbing part of the set-up is the fact that certain areas in the northern part of the country, which are be- yond the pale of norn,al laws grow poppy crop which brings high profits to the _ growers. The easy availability of the stuff and a most lucrative market for it in European and American countries has proved to be a great temptation for the traffickers. In the last one or two years huge consignments of charas, heroin and opium amounting to billions of rupees in the foreign markets have been caught in Pakistan. But one can never be sure that the seized consign- ments formed the total traffic. To check the cultivation of poppy in the northern areas, Pakistan is working on a concrete plan, in association with certain UN agenc~es, to induce the 7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/42/09: CIA-RDP82-40850R000500470055-9 cultivators of poppy to switch over to other crops. These efforts, initiated under a definite programme, have been fruitful in that the poppy crop has been reduced to a 100 tons now which two years ago was as high as 800 tors. But to limit the output to the desired level, the crop-substitution project will have to be combined with the development of a socio-economic infrastructure in the \"target area\". This is expensive and time-consuming. But the Phase II of the project which covers the period 1981 to 1984 may prove helpful in achieving the intended goals. It would be some time yet before the cultivation of poppy crop can be brought under complete control. In the meantime the traffic in ~he drug is contii~u- ing unabated, and this poses a problem for Pakistan as well as the Western countries. The nature of the cri.me and the character of the people indulging - in it make it imperative that methods to curb these criminals should be equal- ly harsh [word illegibleJ determined. Drug addiction is nothing short of a slow and lingering death for the victim while for the family of the addict it is the most excruci[ating] agony to see one of the dear ones ~eing slowly [des]troyed in soul and body. Enticing somebody into the use of drug is indeed worse than killing him. A killer commits murder in a fit of passion but a drug trafficker sends his victims to his doom in a cool and calculated manner and is, therefore, much more dangerous for human society than an ordinary murderer.

The news report stated that he was.a thahan phran irregular. The return of these forces shows that ~he expulsion of these narcotics traffickers, who are known throughout the world, did not achieve any results. A news report has stated that they have set up a camp with 140 covered buildings. This construction required the use of much manpower and took much time. Officials did not know the reason for this until the clash when the officials who attacked t:his group were able to seize the buildings. ï¿½ IL is thought that if Khun Sa had not shot an official because of mistakenly thinking that they had come to suppress him, these people would still be living there comfortably. They h~ve acted as if this Thai territory belongs to them just as they did at Ban Hin Taek in Mae Chah District, Chiang Rai Province. ~ Many past government closed their eyes to th~m and allowed them to become bolder.

But it is believed that the government is not sitting by idly and that it is taking swift action against this influential group. It will not be a threat to the state.

The claim that this was done in order to have them serve as a defense line against the communists is not reasonable. National defense is the duty of Thais. It is not necessary to bring in foreigners to do this and then give them land on which Thais, the owners oi the country, cannot step foot on. Besides this, this group has always been involved in the drug trade. While they say that they are no longer involved in this trade, narcotics suppression officials do not believe them. And nothing can be done because high-ranking people have cited national security reasons to protect this evil group. Thailand belongs to the Thai people. People cannot turn over territory easily. Once such groups are here, it is difficult to get rid of them. For example, the KMT soldiers have raised families here but they still consider themselves to be Chinese. They only say that they want to change their nationality and . become Thai citizens. If these people are allowed to become Thai citizens, this will show their power even more and Thais will become second-class citizens even though they are the owners of the country.

And the thing worth noting is that the use of amphetamines, or \"horse medicine,\" is on the rise in the northeast. Besides this, it was learned that 96 percent of those who came for treatment were Thais and that 95:8 percent were men. Only 4.2 percent were women. The statistics were similar for both years. Most addicts were in the 21-25 age group. This was the same in every region. Most of those wh~~ came for treatment did not have an income. It is understood t;hat the addicts rely on their parents, relatives or others to pay for the drugs. A researcher said that this report shows the spread of drug abuse in Thailand by relying only on data obtained from addicts who voluntarily came for treatment. If the number of addicts who have not come for treatment is to be estimated, this must be done tentatively and it will take a long time. However, those concerned estimate that the number of addicts who have not gone for treatment is 8-12 times as large~ If this is true, it means that there are at least - 100,000 addicts in Thailand. 11943 20 ' CSO: 5300/5764 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040500070055-9 .

On 14 May, officials arrested Mr Bun, or Lek, the owner of the marihuana even though he was not implicated in the investigation report. - The same reporter reported that on 4 February, Police Lieutenant Colonel Bunmi Chitkaeo, a T.L. inspector, arrested Mr Subin Duangchai and seized his 10-wheeled truck, license No Loei 70-0157, toqether with the marihuana. He turned the man and evidence over to Police Sub-Lieutenant Chaiprakon Phanthong, the officer J on duty at the provincial police station in Pak Thong Chai District, at 1100 hours on 5 February for further handling of the case. The case was investigated and the file was sent to the court. The court tried the case and sentenced Mr Subin to 3 years in prison. However, during that period, a large quantity of the marihuana that had been seized disappeared. Police Lieutenant General Narong Mahanon, the deputy director- general of the Police Department, ordered Police Major General Niyom Kanchanawat, the deputy commander of C.K., to go and conduct an investigation. He discovered that the 53 bags of marihuana had really disappeared. Following this, Police Lieutenant General Rut put Police Major General Thawatchai Phithak, the deputy commissioner of,the provincial 2, in charge of a team of high-ranking police officers from the Commissioners' Office of the Provincial 2 and from the Nakhon Ratchasima provincial police precinct.

It is our own obligation but one matched by its overriding importance to countries whose inhabitants have an alarmingly high rate of use of the drug. An analysis of causes resulting in a.prol~feration of laboratoriea in Bolivia leads us to two conclusiona. First of ali, situation is due to the fact that it was possible to obtain the raw material with relative ease and at a price advantageous to drug traffiekers, mea~ing that it is a tempting operation despite the risks run. Second, because of th~ afor~nentioned fact, it is necessary to eradicate the manufacturing proc~~s in its early stages: where the raw material is produced and freely marketed. Consequently, the most re- cent provisions have provided for and, to saae extent, resulted in actions aimed at restricting growing areas to a limit in keeping with ~egitimate needs for coca and control of its marketing. If ineasures ar~ not taken during the stages preceding manufacture, later control Would be extremely diff icult, as experience has shown. ~ What has happened in recent weeks in the Yapacani areas, where coca plantations are now being destroyed, gives us th~ fixst indications of what must be done and the possibilities of tur~ing good intentions into practical applications. There, peasants l~ave agr~ed t~at coca plat~tations are to be e~iminated, but th they have asked for campensation, ~specially in the way of education, health, technical assistance to improve other.produ~ts and improvementa in means of communication. The solution has been relatively easy because there are no large plantations in the.area, a total of abouC 100 hectares with very few peasants having over l hectare. In most caees, they had only part of a hectare and said themselvea that they only met the needs of fatmhands who chew coca. In other areas, however, there will undoubtedly be greater resistance because coca is more widely grown and is an essential means of income for peasantst ~ ~7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040500070055-9 In the case of Yapacani, compensation will not be particularly onerous and to a good extent, corresponds to plans which the government already anticipated carrying out within the near future as part of its policy of development and of improving living conditions. On the other hand, in Yungas and Chapare, the two major coca growing regions, it will be necessary to think about much more costly plans dealing with much greater areas, plans to be carried out in medium-range terms. We do not be- lieve, especially in view of Bolivia's current economic situation, that plans for compensation and crop substitution can be carried out. There are social reasons and questions of justice that prevent one from simply resorting to the job of destroying coca plantations and leaving the peasants to fend for them- selves. As painful and alarming as this may be, it is a fact that cannot be ignored: - It is essential to have economic aid and technical assistance, either from interested governments or international organizations. It is urgent that they all be convinced of this. If we do not have such support, the current situation could still be partially alleviated by the good will of national authorities, but we could not go very far and we might therefore risk criticism.

Last weekend, the National Council for the Fight Against Drug Traff icking began the second phase of the plan to f ight the illegal production of coca and co- caine. The operation was designed to discover and dismantle factories, labora- tories and storage facilities in the.vast Chapare region. Members of the press, who accompanied the commission headed by Col Raul Gonza- lez Ferry, director of the council, were able to see that these operations are carried out under conditions disadvantageous for police. The lack of good means of com~unication and transportation enables drug traffickers to use more ~ sophisticated means, which often wreck plans aimed at discovering or arresting them. . Newsmen were able to witness such operations. The police are taken in trucks starting out early in the morning, without even backpacks in which to carry' their emergency food supply, gun, ammunition and dry rations. In operations carried out a few days ago, the press was told that police off icials and offi- cers.stayed in the zones in question, living off water and bananas. They had to carry their weapons in one hand and flashlf.ghts in the other. Cocaine Seized Operations in the second phase included the areas of Eterazma, Isiboro and San Isidro, where 13 factories were discovered and dismantled. Three labora- tories were destroyed on Senda Victoria, each having two wells. In Eterazama, _ there were three factories with three wells; on Senda Bayer, two factories with two wells each; in San Isidro, two factories with a total of four wells; in Isiboro, two factories with three double wells; and in Lauquena, one factory with two wells. 29 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 The amount of the drug seized was 8 kil.ograms 100 grams.

The ~udicial off icial arrived in this town yesterday to evaluate the results of the action taken by the federal police authorities in their battle against the production of poppies and marihuana, which he described as \"magnificent,\" stating that last month alone, in the Sahuaripa and Cumpas area, 33.4 hectares of poppies which already had a height of 60 cen*imeters were destroyed. He said: \"A fundamental goal of the government of the republic is to keep up the campaign constantly and intensively, because we know that if we let down slightly the drug production could resume and then our effort would be relatively fruitless.\" In addition to reviewing the work done against drug production, it is the purpose of Alba Leyva's tour through the northeestern part of the country to make a detailed reconnaissance of the possible areas where poppies and marihuana may be grown, so as to concentrate there a certain number of fumigating airplanes and helicopters with the goal of not leaving a single plantation undestroyed. With regard to the escape o~ drug traffickers from Sinaloa to other states in the northern section of the country, specifically into the mountains of Sonora, Chihua- hua and Durango, Alba Leyva gave assurance that 60 percent of the personnel working in the campaign have been concentrated in those locations, and that the action of the Attorney G~eneral's office will reach them wherever they go. He added that, with the discovery of that illegal activity and the termination of it at its base, Sonora has natually ceased to be a state for drug \"traffic\" and this is w~hy there are few drug seizures and drug trafficker captures, although the latter are seeking substitutes such as South American cocaine and other psycho- tropic substances. .

However, they have been replaced by the ï¿½'mobile units\" since these have been proven far more effective owing to the suddenness of their action. Moreover, Raul Calvillo, director of drug control for the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, claimed that few plantations have actually been destroyed in Sonora, because they are usually located on the border with Chihuahua, and belong to that jurisdction. He stressed that poppy and marihuana production has declined considerably on the national level, and hence the success of the campaign has prompted those engaged in this unlawful activity to seek new cultivation techniques, s~ as to evade the _ action of the police and National Army. He disclosed that one of those systems is to reduce the growing areas because, whereas in 1976 areas of up to 2,500 square meters were discovered, at present they do not exceed 450 square meters. _ Finally, he noted that the antidrug campaign is focused on the destruction oi the plantations before they produce seed, so as to prevent the latter from being used and planted again. The judicial authorities have visited Tijuana, Mexicali, San Luis-Rio Colorado, Ensenada, La Paz and Hermosillo. Yesterday afternoon they returned to Mexico City. Editorial Comment _ Hermosillo EL IMPARCIAL in Spanish 10 May 82 Sec D p 4 [Text] According to the assessment made by the assistant prosecutor of justice of - the nation and national coordinator of the antidrug campaign, Samuel Alba Leyva, _ drug production has declined by 90 percent in the countr~ and has nearly disappear- ed from the state of Sonora. The results of the campaign, which the Attorney General's Office and the Army are keeping up constantly, were described as \"magnificent.\" And, in fact, they are. The battle to curb the growing of poppies or marihuana is one with special features. Drug addiction, although it has declined worldwide, - still reaches stratospheric numbers, represented by hundreds of millions of . dollars. The American addicts consume about 4.5 metric tons of heroin alone, per year, which, when converted into dollars, are many millions for the poor growers and far more for the drug traffickers. The charm of drugs does notlie only in the paradise promised to those who escape - reality, but also in the large profits produced for those engaged in the dirty business. 34 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 As the assistant prosecutor remarked, the campaign to control drugs must be intensive and constant. \"If we let down slightly, the drug production could resume and then our effort would be relatively fruitless.\" And it has been in many places, because there is no other crop which can compete with drugs in monetary terms. In Thailand, Burma, Turkey, Colombia, Bolivia and many places vigorous campaigns have been undertaken to detect and put an end to the poppy and marihuana plantations. In Mexico, the antidrug operation has been under way for several years. Hundreds of small plots, scattered over the most rugged mountain Cerrain, have to be discovered. The 2, 4-D, used to defoliate the poppy plants before the harvest,~s an expensive herbicide and has to be sprinkled by fumigating helicopters or planes. The forces participating in the campaign often have to withstand shootouts with the growers or trafficers. The risks are real and numerous. Unfortunately, the method of inerely destroying the crops is not the most effective one for drug control. Howe~~er, it is the one that has the most national and inter- - national backing. The UN Fund for Control of Drug Abuse and the United States Government are devoting large sums for programs to eradicatP plantations. But the problem is that other fields appear again and the radical solution is never forthcoming. The method should be one of replacing crops, not only destraying the drug crops, but also teaching the farmer~ to plant other income-producing - products. _ In any event, the results achieved here in Mexico have been \"magnificent.\" Those responsible for the control have done a stupendous j~b, which is worthy of praise. 2909 CSO: 5330/82 35 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500070055-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040500070055-9 MEXICO MOVING VAN USED TO SHIP MARIHUANA Shipment to Border Seized ~ Nuevo Laredo EL MANANA in Spanish 7 May 82 Sec B p 6 [Text] Marihuana worth 2 million pesos on the black market was seized by Federal J~tdicial Police forces who, at the same time, captured the drivers of the moving truck in which it was being carried to the Ciudad Mier border, namely, Angel Medina Galeana and Jose Luis Andrade Rodriguez, the guide Gustavo Dominguez Jaime, and the one to whom they were taking it in that town, Adolfo Rios Moreno.

Prof. Yehudit Shuval conducCed the study together with Dr. Rahe{ Ya'avetz in 197~ for the ministry. She told The Jerusalem Po;t that \"the extraordinarily high figures quoted by the police and conveyed by the media in a sensational manner are not, to the beat of my knowledge, based on any systematic research.\" . She said that the ministry ~gures releaaed in rebuttal to the police claims distort the findings of the 1979 ~ study.

The study covered only soft drug use, mainly hashiah. , Publicizing the average for all grades understates the exteot of the problem, she said.

Moreover, 32 per ccnt oP the ~rst group and 43 per cent of the second ~ group knew others who had used toft druga. The police told the Knease?
