        "text": "It depends on what you mean by \"reading a collection\", but for most people this means \"querying a bunch of documents from a collection\". And the answer is that the pricing generally depends on the number of documents retrieved.\n\nTo oversimplify things just a bit:\n\nIf you have a collection of 10 employees and you run a collection(\"employees\").get() call, you will get back 10 employee documents, and be charged for 10 reads.\n\nIf you have a collection of 10,000 employees and you run a collection(\"employees\").get() call, you will get back 10,000 employees, and be charged for 10,000 reads.\n\nIf you have a collection of 10,000 employees and you run a collection(\"employees\").get().limit(10) call, you will get back 10 employees, and be charged for 10 reads."
