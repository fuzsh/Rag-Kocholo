        "text": "About SSH key passphrases\n\nYou can access and write data in repositories on GitHub.com using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine. For more information, see \"About SSH.\"\n\nWhen you generate an SSH key, you can add a passphrase to further secure the key. Whenever you use the key, you must enter the passphrase. If your key has a passphrase and you don't want to enter the passphrase every time you use the key, you can add your key to the SSH agent. The SSH agent manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase.\n\nIf you don't already have an SSH key, you must generate a new SSH key to use for authentication. If you're unsure whether you already have an SSH key, you can check for existing keys. For more information, see \"Checking for existing SSH keys.\"\n\nIf you want to use a hardware security key to authenticate to GitHub, you must generate a new SSH key for your hardware security key. You must connect your hardware security key to your computer when you authenticate with the key pair. For more information, see the OpenSSH 8.2 release notes.\n\nGenerating a new SSH key\n\nYou can generate a new SSH key on your local machine. After you generate the key, you can add the public key to your account on GitHub.com to enable authentication for Git operations over SSH.\n\nOpen TerminalTerminalGit Bash.\n\nPaste the text below, replacing the email used in the example with your GitHub email address.\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nNote: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nThis creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.\n\n> Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair.\n\nWhen you're prompted to \"Enter a file in which to save the key\", you can press Enter to accept the default file location. Please note that if you created SSH keys previously, ssh-keygen may ask you to rewrite another key, in which case we recommend creating a custom-named SSH key. To do so, type the default file location and replace id_ALGORITHM with your custom key name.\n\n> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Press enter]\n\n> Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]\n\n> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]\n\nAt the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see \"Working with SSH key passphrases.\"\n\n> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase] > Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n\nAdding your SSH key to the ssh-agent\n\nBefore adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. When adding your SSH key to the agent, use the default macOS ssh-add command, and not an application installed by macports, homebrew, or some other external source.\n\nGenerating a new SSH key for a hardware security key\n\nIf you are using macOS or Linux, you may need to update your SSH client or install a new SSH client prior to generating a new SSH key. For more information, see \"Error: Unknown key type.\"\n\nInsert your hardware security key into your computer.\n\nOpen TerminalTerminalGit Bash.\n\nPaste the text below, replacing the email address in the example with the email address associated with your account on GitHub.\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nNote: If the command fails and you receive the error invalid format or feature not supported, you may be using a hardware security key that does not support the Ed25519 algorithm. Enter the following command instead.\n\nssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nWhen you are prompted, touch the button on your hardware security key.\n\nWhen you are prompted to \"Enter a file in which to save the key,\" press Enter to accept the default file location.\n\n> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk): [Press enter]\n\n> Enter a file in which to save the key (c:\\Users\\YOU\\.ssh\\id_ed25519_sk):[Press enter]\n\n> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk):[Press enter]\n\nWhen you are prompted to type a passphrase, press Enter.\n\n> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase] > Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n\nAdd the SSH public key to your account on GitHub. For more information, see \"Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account.\""
