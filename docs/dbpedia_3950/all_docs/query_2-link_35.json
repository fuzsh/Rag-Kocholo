        "text": "So‚Ä¶.I quit my job as Head of Social at Kurogo. And now I am officially unemployed as of 1st January, 2024. I want to start out by saying the biggest thank you to Sam and Lewis for taking a chance on me as an unexperienced graduate back in 2021! But as much as I‚Äôve learnt so much and loved my time at Kurogo, being at a personal branding agency was never my end goal. I‚Äôve always dreamt of working at a fashion/makeup/female led brand and I knew I needed to take the leap. So a little bit about me in relation to my career: ~ I started my career as an editorial intern at Glamour Magazine ~ I became Head of Social at a growing startup at the age of 21 ~ I‚Äôve grown my personal platforms across Instagram and LinkedIn to 90,000 ~ I‚Äôve got a strong understanding and passion for community led audiences ~ I‚Äôve trained and managed a team of 7+ members, leading 1:1s, quarterly reviews and trainings ~ I‚Äôve helped grow an agency from 3 to 17 employees, having a strong understanding of business alongside marketing ~ I‚Äôve worked with 50+ clients across different industries, creating multiple viral posts for clients in fashion and retail ~ I know all things pop culture and Tiktok trends (sorry to anyone who had to listen to me rant about the Golden Globes yesterday üëÄ) Quitting my job without a backup is one of the scariest things I‚Äôve ever done and I want to be as transparent as I can during this time. Because there are a lot of people going through this right now, but it still seems taboo to speak about. So, if anyone has any opportunities in the fashion/makeup/retail space (I have zero ego around job titles - would happily be an intern to get some more insight into the industry), specifically to do with marketing/social media/brand I would be extremely grateful if you could drop me a message and share this with your network. Thanks so much to everyone who has helped me along the way! ü§ç P.s: I‚Äôve dropped my portfolio in the comments as well #opentowork"
