The account panel is uncluttered and easy to use, so you can quickly concentrate on the things that matter.\n\nWe Are Here To Help\n\nYour domain carries your brand, public image, and professional reputation. As well as 24/7 customer support, we provide everything you need to develop your personal or business site, including answers to questions like:\n\nWhat is a domain and why do I need one? →\n\nWhat makes a good domain name? →\n\nHow do I choose the right Top-level Domain? →\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nYour website security and privacy comes first at Namecheap, and we will always support the rights of individuals and consumers online. It’s our mission to keep the Internet open, free, and safe for everyone.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nYou’re covered by a Support Team that’s renowned for being one of the most knowledgeable, friendly, and professional in the business. Real people are ready to assist you with any issue, any time, 24/7.\n\nThe prices can vary hugely, as the demand for some TLDs is higher. The standard price of traditional top-level domains (TLDs) such as .net and .org can range between $6 and $15, whereas newer TLDs like .site and .club can range between $10 and $25. You can learn more about the average cost of domain names in our blog.\n\nTo find the cheapest domains, check out our TLD list or take a look at our domain pricing tool! Using our handy filter, you can select 'Sale' to find our cheapest domains. You can also select 'Popular' to see the most sought-after domains, and 'New' to view our recently launched domains.\n\nWhile most people look to buy .com first, sometimes your dream domain name isn’t available. Plus, it’s important to choose one that reflects your business or personal brand. There are a huge number of generic TLDs and Country Code TLDs out there, and as we offer affordable, low-cost domains for less than $1, it’s easy to find the perfect domain name for growing your online presence!\n\nYes, you can benefit from great savings on our range of products, from domains to hosting packages. Check out our current deals for all the latest promotions. Keep an eye out for multi-year offers — you may be able to pick up a deal if you register your domain for 2, 3, 5, and 10 years at a time."
