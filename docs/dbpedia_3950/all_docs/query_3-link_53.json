The Omoda 5 is the first product of the Omoda product series under the Chery brand. [10] In many export markets, the model is marketed as the Omoda C5 or simply Omoda 5 under the separate Omoda marque which is positioned more upmarket than the Chery brand.\n\nAccording to Chery, the letter \"O\" from Omoda represents \"brand new\", while \"Moda\" means a fashion trend. In some Western markets, the \"O\" was described as derived from the word \"oxygen\", while \"Moda\" means \"modern\".[11]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Omoda 5 was unveiled during the Auto Guangzhou 2021 in November. Production started in February 2022, with scheduled launch on various overseas markets.[5][12] It went on sale in China in the second quarter of 2022.[13]\n\nDuring its development, the Omoda 5 was known under the codename \"X-C\". It is the first crossover SUV model of the \"Chery 4.0\" products that features Chery's newly developed \"Art in Motion\" design language. The front end consists of a \"diamond matrix\" front grille.[14] The rear section consists of a slanted rear roofline similar to fastbacks and a double-layered spoiler. Chery claimed that the vehicle is designed with \"golden ratio of Pythagoras\", with the height-width ratio of Omoda equal to 0.8677.[15]\n\nAs a global model, the vehicle is simultaneously developed in left- and right-hand drive formats.[16] Chery claimed that it has been tested around Australia, with major loop tests in the central, eastern and southern regions of Australia, for a total route of nearly 30,000 km (18,600 mi).[17]\n\nThe interior of the Omoda 5 is equipped with two integrated 10.25-inch high-definition digital screens that offer control of driving, climate and entertainment settings.[18] Vehicles destined for export markets are equipped with a different interior design, from the dashboard, central console, and door trims, which was styled by Chery's Lead Designer Richard Koo.[10][9]\n\nWith the rear seats in the upright position, the luggage capacity is rated at 378 litres (13.3 cu ft), and 1,075 litres (38.0 cu ft) with the rear seats folded.[14]\n\nRear view\n\nInterior (export version)\n\nOmoda C5\n\nRear view\n\nPowertrain\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Omoda 5 was launched in China with a SQRF4J16 1.6-litre ACTECO TGDI (turbocharged engine with direct fuel injection) engine (marketed as \"Kunpeng Power\" in China). The engine is rated at 147 kW (200 PS; 197 hp) and 290 N⋅m (29.6 kg⋅m; 214 lb⋅ft) of torque, which is badged as the \"290T\". The 290T model is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Another option is the SQRE4T15C 1.5-litre turbocharged engine badged as \"230T\", which is rated at 108–115 kW (147–156 PS; 145–154 hp), depending on the market, with 230 N⋅m (23.5 kg⋅m; 170 lb⋅ft) of torque, and mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT).[19]\n\nFor some markets, the 1.6-litre model is available with optional all-wheel drive that uses multi-link rear suspension instead of a torsion beam suspension, which led to a decrease in ground clearance from 190 mm (7.5 in) to 180 mm (7.1 in).[20]\n\nType Model Displacement Power Torque Transmission Layout Calendar years 1.5 petrol 1.5 SQRE4T15C 230T 1,498 cc (1.5 L) turbocharged I4 108 kW (147 PS; 145 hp) @ 5,500 rpm[21] 210–230 N⋅m (21.4–23.5 kg⋅m; 155–170 lb⋅ft) @ 1,750–4,000 rpm CVT FWD 2022–present 115 kW (156 PS; 154 hp) @ 5,500 rpm[22][23] 1.6 petrol 1.6 SQRF4J16 290T 1,598 cc (1.6 L) turbocharged I4 110 kW (150 PS; 148 hp) @ 5,500 rpm (Russia)[24] 275 N⋅m (28.0 kg⋅m; 203 lb⋅ft) @ 2,000–3,800 rpm 7-speed\n\ndual-clutch FWD\n\nAWD 2022–present 136.5 kW (186 PS; 183 hp) @ 5,500 rpm 275 N⋅m (28.0 kg⋅m; 203 lb⋅ft) @ 2,000–3,800 rpm 147 kW (200 PS; 197 hp) @ 5,500 rpm 290 N⋅m (29.6 kg⋅m; 214 lb⋅ft) @ 2,000–4,000 rpm\n\nElectric version\n\n[edit]\n\nA battery electric version with a power output of 150 kW (204 PS; 201 hp) and a 61 kWh battery was introduced at the Auto Shanghai in April 2023.
