        "text": "A large percentage of each entering first-year class receives one or more outside awards from national or local organizations. When adjusting the Harvard financial aid package, 100% of the total outside award amount is first deducted from your work expectation. If the total of outside awards exceeds your work expectation, that excess amount is deducted from the Harvard Scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that help to meet need, they may not be used to replace your parents’ contribution or other expected family resource.\n\nFor example, if you were originally offered a financial aid package with a $3,500 job, and a $15,000 Harvard Scholarship and subsequently receive a $2,000 National Merit award and $1,000 from the Elks Club, then we will reduce your term-time job expectation to $500. Only if outside awards exceeded $3,500 would they have any impact upon the amount of Harvard Scholarship.\n\nIf your parents are divorced or separated, each parent’s contribution is assessed separately. Each parent should use the calculator to obtain an estimated cost for their personal income and asset information. The total estimated net price to attend Harvard is the sum of the estimates for the two parents.\n\nRemarried parents should separate their income and assets from the applicant’s step-parent’s income and assets. For assets where a clear separation isn’t obvious, please halve the value of these assets and include this value."
