        "text": "(Photos by Andrew Miller unless otherwise noted.)\n\nBy Jessica Remo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\n\"Is there a dead person you're hoping to hear from?\" asked Rich, the sweet guy behind me.\n\nWe had made quick friends, my sister and I, with him and his crew. We were all here at NJPAC to see Theresa Caputo, the big-haired, sassy, effervescent star of the hit TLC show \"Long Island Medium.\"\n\nNo one in specific, we answered, before confessing that my sister had only ever seen one episode of the show.\n\nWe chatted about psychics, about how Rich wanted to ask Caputo if there was a god, about where we grew up. He guessed my 46-year-old sister was 28 and that made her night.\n\nAs the lights dimmed we wished each other good luck. Here she comes.\n\nThe crowd\n\nRich was a big fan, which shocked me. I thought for sure he'd been dragged here like the rest of the men in attendance, who stood out because there were so few.\n\nThe audience tended to be middle-aged, casually clad white women in jeans and comfy shoes. The excitement was palpable. Ticket prices ranged from $40 up to nearly $100. The 3,000-plus-seat venue was almost sold out, with no seats left on the floor and only nosebleeds still available.\n\nOur sippy cups of wine - $17 each. (Jessica Remo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)\n\nThe biggest scam of all is at the snack bar\n\nSince I dragged my sister to see a psychic she barely knew a thing about, I decided to treat her to whatever she wanted from the snack bar.\n\nWe considered Reese's Pieces, but decided we needed something stronger — wine.\n\nFor a whopping $17 each, we were given 10 ounces in a plastic cup with a lid and straw. I remembered the brand, Trinity Oaks, and Googled it.\n\nSurvey says...these are $8 bottles of wine. We could've bought two bottles for the price of one sippy cup.\n\nI get it -- 10 ounces is technically two glasses, but that level of up-pricing when you're drinking from a plastic cup takes some real cojones, NJPAC. I was almost impressed.\n\n(Never mind the $28 \"special event rate\" parking.)\n\nA patriotic opening\n\nBefore Caputo took the stage, we were told to rise for the National Anthem.\n\nStanding, left hand holding a $17 plastic cup of pinot grigio, right hand over my heart, moments from seeing a reality TV star psychic, I whispered to my sister that I had never felt more American.\n\nThe anthem was a recording, not live singing, but still the audience clapped and hollered when it was over. They were fired up.\n\nA trailer played scenes from \"Long Island Medium,\" now in its 13th season. (The show has recently been focused on the drama of Caputo's split with her husband, Larry, after 28 years.)\n\nWhen Caputo took the stage, the crowd hit new decibels.\n\nCaputo is captivating\n\nOn stage, Caputo is tan, shimmering, airbrushed with some sort of glitter, in a black dress, bejeweled in diamonds, giant French tip nails, her bleach blonde hair standing tall and teased as ever like a crown, like a halo.\n\nI had hope she'd wear her signature rhinestone-studded Louboutin heels, but instead she was in rhinestone-studded Louboutin sneakers, due to a bad knee.\n\nStill, she was captivating to behold.\n\nFirst, Caputo gave a 20-minute speech about how it's up to us to figure out how these messages fit in our lives. How \"spirit\" talks to her through symbols that make sense to her — a vocabulary, if you will. If you've seen the show, you've heard it all before.\n\nShe swears she's not changed her prices since the show began seven years ago. (It's $175 for a private reading and $50 a person for group readings.) The only thing that's changed, she claims, is that all the money goes to charity with checks made out to either Meals on Wheels or the Stonybrook Foundation for veterans on Long Island. She has a gigantic waiting list.\n\nA rough start\n\nAfter her schpiel, Caputo announced that a few folks had been selected from her fan club to come backstage. A woman across the aisle was picked and immediately began to cry. The readings hadn't even begun.\n\nCaputo began with the front row. \"Who has the dad that passed?\"\n\nA woman raised her hand, and they were off to the races. Cameras follow Caputo and a screen on stage shows the action. One crew member who followed along had the sole job of passing out tissues.\n\nBut Caputo was off, right from the start, saying something about the woman's dad \"passing from the chest\" that the woman couldn't validate.\n\nShe moved on. \"What about the mother figure?\" she asked.\n\nAnother woman rose and was handed a microphone while the first woman stood there, hanging, waiting. She asked if that woman's mother had an issue with her legs. Nope.\n\nIt went on like this. Any time something was wrong for one person, it was right for someone else and that person stood up. Three mics got passed around. Caputo bounced around all night this way, talking as fast as an auctioneer, leading her own game of spiritual whack-a-mole.\n\nA pair of suicides, competing for her attention\n\nAfter the mess with the front row, Caputo moved to the side of the stage. She started talking about the man who had killed himself and instantly two women, rows apart, shot up and both began to cry. The tissue person was on the way.\n\nOne said her husband had jumped from the George Washington Bridge. For the other, it was a boyfriend.\n\nCaputo shouted things out, and they competed with one another to place them faster, both clutching the provided tissues and weeping, both trying to hold Caputo's attention.\n\nMy heart went out to them, but still, there wasn't anything wildly specific or accurate about Caputo's messages. She told them the men were deeply sorry for what they had done and said those \"shadows they see in the hallway\" (both nodded that they had seen said shadows) are these men.\n\nJust when I'd had enough, someone gave her the finger\n\nThe women with the suicides competing for Caputo's messages had me feeling bad. They were vulnerable. Grieving. Eager to validate.\n\nThen, as Caputo tried over and over to get someone in the orchestra area to acknowledge a murder where evidence was mysteriously moved, a woman three tiers up in the back started yelling.\n\n\"It's up here!\" the woman said, waving her arms wildly. \"Right here!\"\n\nCaputo tried to stay cool, making jokes about how she wishes she could be like Oprah where \"You get a reading! And you get a reading!\" but that \"spirit\" tells her where to stand. There was no way she was going up there.\n\nWhen the woman shouted again, Caputo scolded her, saying it was very distracting, and the audience applauded.\n\nAnd that's when the woman flipped her off.\n\nCaputo reacted instantly.\n\n\"She just gave me the finger!\" she yelled. \"Get the f*** out! Get her the f*** out!\"\n\nThe woman tried to sit down but eventually was forced out. As she left, Caputo quipped: \"See, God don't like ugly.\"\n\nThis Saturday Night Live clip is a pretty accurate depiction of how the night went. Instant tears.\n\nCaputo is a solid entertainer\n\nAs upset as I found myself as Caputo failed again and again to land most of her messages, I did find something about her endearing. She told funny jokes. She was sassy. She cursed. She could be from Jersey, I thought.\n\nMost of the audience was entranced. I've been entertained by the show and watched more than a dozen episodes, even if I never fully bought in.\n\nAt one point, Caputo used a Polaroid camera to take pictures with a couple teenagers, joking with them about how it works and how the picture would show up in a few minutes like magic. \"This is the future!\" she said and got big laughs from the audience.\n\nWhen she got something right, she'd drop some sarcasm — \"Oh, yeah, I Googled that!\"\n\nShe ate people's candy. On her show, there's even a reading where she fed M&Ms from her mouth to a couple, saying it was because their dead son told her to.\n\nThey each ate them, willingly, gladly, saying that was just the sort of thing their prankster of a son would do. That's how much people love Theresa Caputo.\n\nThe baby...the baby with the SIDS\n\nFor what seemed like forever, and across the entire place, Caputo kept going back to \"a baby\" and \"watching the baby on a monitor.\" Eventually she got more specific, saying the baby died of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).\n\nCrickets.\n\nThen she talked about a window with blinds and a baby with a cord around its neck.\n\nStill nothing. I began to wonder why she doesn't talk about something more common, like, ya know, heart disease.\n\nFinally, tiers up again, a woman started yelling, saying her brother fell out of a window when he was a baby. Caputo had her come down.\n\nThe woman explained she was supposed to be watching her brother, she was only 10, he couldn't even walk, but somehow he got out of his crib and fell out of the window.\n\nCaputo consoled her, told her it wasn't her fault, on and on. She asked if the woman ever wanted to do something in her brother's honor.\n\nThe woman said she wants to get a law passed where bars across windows would be required on not just the first floor, but on every floor of an apartment building. (That's going to be a tough campaign, I think.)\n\nCaputo commits. She says she's giving her $5,000 toward it and invites her backstage after the show. They hug as the woman weeps and moans.\n\nPainful misses over and over again\n\nThe rest of the evening was torturous. You want her to connect. You want her to nail something specific. You want to be wowed.\n\nBut it just didn't happen.\n\nWhen my sister left to go to the bathroom I told her we should give in and buy the Reese's Pieces from the overpriced snack stand, just to get through the rest of the night. She came back in empty-handed, telling me it had closed.\n\nDejected, I asked, \"Want to just give her the finger and get the hell out of here?\"\n\nWalking in to NJPAC. (Jessica Remo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)\n\nI saw a psychic for the first time this year and here's what I realized\n\nFull disclosure: Do I think psychics like Caputo are full of it? Yup.\n\nI went to a psychic medium for the first time a month ago with my mother. I was mostly open-minded and came out feeling fully fleeced. The \"medium\" was a very nice lady, but she was fishing, way off on most things, and accurate on those that were the most Google-able. (She had our full names ahead of time and nailed that I went to \"that school with the V name...I think it's Villanova?\" which is, literally, the most Google-able thing about me.)\n\nAs a journalist, I have scraped the 'net for information about hundreds of people and there's tons out there, countless public records databases, plus that 5K you ran, that online petition you signed.\n\nDoes Caputo do her research? Especially for those one-on-one readings? Maybe. She could even pick the more Google-able folks from among the hordes on her waiting list. Also, at least one client has admitted producers interviewed her about her husband's passing before Caputo \"read\" her.\n\nA lot of misses in this clip from the Wendy Williams show.\n\nBesides, no psychic has ever truly proved himself or herself\n\nHave you heard of the $1 Million Paranormal Challenge? Basically James Randi, a retired magician, offered to pay a million to any psychic or medium who can prove his or her abilities. No winners.\n\nAnd another magician, Criss Angel, offered $2 million, specifically calling out Caputo in a tweet: \"take my 2 million dollar challenge or stop exploiting the vulnerable. If your legit ur 2Million richer\"\n\nAnd for every video of the more famous psychics nailing something — John Edward, James Van Praagh, Sylvia Browne — there are even more videos of their awkward fails. There are reformed psychics who have come out and said it's all hooey.\n\nAnd there are plenty of videos of Caputo bombing, too. (See above.)\n\nA compilation of psychic fails.\n\nShe repeats the same things\n\nFor Caputo, the end theme is always about the dead telling us we need to relieve ourselves of all the burdens and guilt we feel related to their passing — don't feel bad you didn't do enough, don't feel bad you weren't there when he took his last breath, don't worry that the person was suffering, you need to release yourself from this guilt because it's killing you.\n\nSometimes she mentions a number, 18, and if that doesn't connect it's a 1 and an 8, and if it's not that then maybe it's the corresponding months, January and August.\n\nShe often mentions jewelry, earrings, a watch. Often some dead person thanks the living person for how they were laid to rest, how the person retouched their hair or makeup.\n\nFrequently death themes are about the chest or the chest and the head, about not being able to breath or speak, about filling up with fluid or bleeding out.\n\nThere are the symbols: cardinals, rainbows, butterflies, found change, white feathers. All of these things, for sure, she says, messages from our loved ones.\n\nMy favorite: \"Was his death sudden or unexpected?\" OF COURSE IT WAS. No, it was scheduled. Kevorkian came in. By the way, \"sudden\" and \"unexpected\" mean the same damn thing.\n\nShout vaguenesses to an audience of 3,000 grieving people, and guess what, you'll connect somewhere.\n\nShe also tells you what to think: \"Appreciate this beautiful gift your loved ones just gave you.\"\n\nIt turned my stomach.\n\nA reading for Rich\n\nBefore the night was over, Caputo made her way to my seat. She read the people next to us and then she read my new buddy, Rich.\n\nShe correctly guessed that both Rich's parents had passed. (Rich is 65, so it wasn't that wild of a guess.) He gave away information pretty quickly as she fished around, eventually explaining how they had both passed. When she asked if he had his father's watch and he did, Rich, too, started to cry.\n\nI felt for him. At the end of the night, I didn't want to tell him I didn't believe.\n\nBut for me, I'd rather have the truth — even if it's that I've severely overpaid for a glass of wine, that nearly 3,000 gullible New Jerseyans paid good money to see a phony, and that my dead relatives most certainly aren't talking to a crazy blond lady from Long Island.\n\nRead more\n\nI ate at the Asbury Park worm-gate restaurant last night and it was delicious\n\nWe stayed at the Hard Rock Casino (with Fetty Wap): Full review of Atlantic City's new hotel\n\nI went to Scores in Atlantic City, the strip club that Hard Rock wishes didn't exist\n\nWoman who took photo of 'Cosby' actor working at N.J.
