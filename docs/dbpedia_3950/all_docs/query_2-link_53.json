A bill is sent out at the end of each billing cycle, providing a sum of Google Cloud charges. Prices on this page are listed in U.S. dollars (USD).\n\nFor Compute Engine, disk size, machine type memory, and network usage are calculated in JEDEC binary gigabytes (GB), or IEC gibibytes (GiB), where 1 GiB is 230 bytes. Similarly, 1 TiB is 240 bytes, or 1024 JEDEC GBs.\n\nIf you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.\n\nYou can also find pricing information with the following options:\n\nSee the estimated costs of your instances and Compute Engine resources when you create them in the Google Cloud console.\n\nEstimate your total project costs with the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator.\n\nView and download prices from the Pricing Table in the Google Cloud console.\n\nView more information about costs and usage in Cloud Billing reports.\n\nUse the Cloud Billing Catalog API for programmatic access to SKU information.\n\nTry it for yourself\n\nIf you're new to Google Cloud, create an account to evaluate how Compute Engine performs in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads.\n\nTry Compute Engine free\n\nGeneral-purpose machine types\n\nC4 machine types\n\nIf you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.\n\nSpot prices are dynamic and can change up to once every 30 days, but provide discounts of 60-91% off of the corresponding on-demand price for most machine types and GPUs. Spot prices also provide smaller discounts for local SSDs and A3 machine types. For more information, see the Spot VMs documentation.\n\nC4 standard machine types\n\nIf you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.\n\nSpot prices are dynamic and can change up to once every 30 days, but provide discounts of 60-91% off of the corresponding on-demand price for most machine types and GPUs.

For more information, see the Spot VMs documentation.\n\nN4 custom vCPUs and memory\n\nCustom machine types let you set a specific number of vCPUs and GB of memory for your instances to match the needs of your workload. Custom machine types save you the cost of running on a larger and more expensive machine type if your application does not require all of the resources provided by that machine type.\n\nRead Creating a VM instance with a custom machine type to learn how to use these machine types.\n\nFor an accurate estimate of your billing with custom machine types, use the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator.\n\nIf you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.\n\nSpot prices are dynamic and can change up to once every 30 days, but provide discounts of 60-91% off of the corresponding on-demand price for most machine types and GPUs.

Because you commit to a minimum level of resource usage when you purchase your license commitment, you have to pay the agreed-upon prices for the duration of that commitment, even if your resource usage is lower than that minimum level. As a result, to maximize the benefit of your CUDs, ensure that you use all of your committed licenses and run VMs with those licenses for 100% time of your commitment's term.
