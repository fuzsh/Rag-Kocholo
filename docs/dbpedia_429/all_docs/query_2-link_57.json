This, after all, was the book that was supposed to be inventing management.1 And yet, at the same time, the book was presaging the end of managers. In a way he was saying: “Management is dead, long live management!” Drucker was attempting to define a new beginning with management, organization, and planning incorporated into all jobs. Nowhere is this struggle for meaning more apparent than in his dissection of personnel management.\n\nNature has not provided ready-made all the things necessary for the life and happiness of mankind. In order to obtain these things we have to Work. The only rational labor is that which is directed to the creation of those things. Any kind of work which does not help us to attain this object is a ridiculous, idiotic, criminal, imbecile, waste of time.\n\n(Robert Tressell, pseudonym of Robert Noonan, 1870–1911)"
