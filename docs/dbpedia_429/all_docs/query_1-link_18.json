The words \"financial statements\" are substituted for \"accounts\" to use the generally accepted term for audits conducted by public accountants.

In clause (1), the words \"records and property owned or used by\" are substituted for \"books, accounts, financial records, reports, files, and all other papers, things, or property belonging to or in use by\" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.\n\nIn subsection (b)(1)(B), the words \"supplemented . . . by\" and \"carried on by the corporation\" are omitted as unnecessary.\n\nTermination of Reporting Requirements\n\nWith respect to corporations listed below, for termination, effective May 15, 2000, of reporting provisions in subsec.
