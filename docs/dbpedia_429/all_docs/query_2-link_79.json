        "meta_description": "The end of management was the last thing on the mind of Peter Drucker when his book, The Practice of Management, was published for the first time in 1955. This, after all, was the book that was supposed to be inventing management.1 And yet, at the same time, the book was presaging the end of managers. In a way he was saying: “Management is dead, long live management!” Drucker was attempting to define a new beginning with management, organization, and planning incorporated into all jobs. Nowhere is this struggle for meaning more apparent than in his dissection of personnel management.",
