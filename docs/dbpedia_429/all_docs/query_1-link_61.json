        "text": "by Gideon Marcus\n\nAll Together Now\n\nOut in San Francisco, in the humorously named \"Cow Palace\", the GOP are having a convention. Their goal is to pick the fellow they feel most adequately represents the convictions of the party of Lincoln, of Roosevelt, of Eisenhower.\n\nTo all accounts, they have settled on Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, a nativist, opponent of the Civil Rights Act, and advocate for expanded use of nuclear weaponry. Despite a last-ditch attempt by Republican moderates Scranton, Rockefeller, and Romney, nothing can stop General Goldwater from tilting against LBJ in November.\n\nWhether or not Barry wins the general election (I don't believe he can), his candidacy has reshaped the Republican Party into something regressive, \"Primitive\". God help us if someone with his platform actually ascends to the Presidency…\n\nPolitics takes center stage in the latest issue of Galaxy, too, and like the Cow Palace convention, most of the names between the covers of this magazine are heavy hitters, known to all. Let's see if we get a better result from Mr. Pohl (editor of Galaxy) than we did from Mr. Morton, Chair of the GOP convention:\n\nThe Issue at Hand\n\nby John Pederson, Jr.\n\nThe Dead Lady of Clown Town, by Cordwainer Smith\n\nby Gray Morrow\\\n\nOver the past decade and a half, Cordwainer Smith has woven a tapestry of tales, telling the thousands year history of The Instrumentality, technocratic oligarchy spanning much of the galaxy (except for the longevity-drug-growing Norstrilia, the wealthy and proud remnant of the British Commonwealth). This domain is run by true humans and maintained by underpeople, animals cast in the rough images of people but with no inherent rights. In recent tales, we learned of the revolt of the underpeople that tore down the Instrumentality. This latest story tells of the first abortive attempt that set the seeds for the successful rebellion.\n\nAt the center of Lady is Elaine, an embryo germinated and dispatched, by accident, from Earth to Fomalhaut III to serve as a physician. The problem is that none of the humans there needed medical attention, thus rendering Elaine's life fruitless and frustrating. But her coming was prophesied by Lady Panc Ashash, long deceased but imprinted on a Fomalhautian computer. The Dead Lady introduces Elaine to D'Joan, a young dog person, who is to be the martyr who gives life, love, and hope to the underpeople. Together, Joan and Elaine lead the first movement against the Instrumentality. The measure of its success depends entirely upon the time frame in which its effects are gauged.\n\nLady presents a quandary for me. On the one hand, I adore Cordwainer Smith, and his fairytale, off-center approach to science fiction is usually far more effective than it has any right to be. This time around, however, I felt the format had gotten stale. The story is laden with portentous language, like a tale from a religious text, but events are presented as overdetermined, inevitable, and none of the characters makes a conscious decision. In particular, the \"love scene\" between Elaine and 'The Hunter', a telepathic human with mind control powers who sides with the underpeople is not only perfunctory but disturbing (smacking of rape).\n\nIn the end, this is a redundant story, one that did not need to be told. And Smith's poetic style is more grating than compelling this time 'round.\n\n2.5 stars (half stars being permissible for novellas and novels).\n\nFor Your Information: A Century of Fossil Man, by Willy Ley\n\nThis month's non-fiction is about the historical and current state of physical anthropology — the study of human fossils. Willy is back to his recent mode: informative but brief and dry. I miss Ley of the early '50s, the one who convinced me to subscribe to Galaxy in the first place.\n\nStill, not bad. Three stars.\n\nJungle Substitute, by Brian W. Aldiss\n\nby Jack Gaughan\n\nDeep in the heart of a decaying city, robots and humans live a symbiotic relationship of despair. People no longer have meaningful jobs, their lives guided by endless superstition and taboo; the machines are slowly breaking down. One young man, Robin, discovers a government project to declare him and his family obsolete — but is the Government Investigation Bureau what it seems to be? And what can he make of the resourceful GIB agent, Gina, who seems to know far more about the city and its condition than anyone else?\n\nWith Jungle, Aldiss paints as good a dystopian vision of the man/machine world as I've ever seen, as exciting and evocative as the first stages of his Hothouse series. This is the kind of quality that won him the Best Promising Author Honorable Mention in 1959.\n\nFive stars.\n\nThe Watchers in the Glade, by Richard Wilson\n\nby Jack Gaughan\n\nSomewhat less effective (but no less vivid) is this story by pulp-veteran Richard Wilson. In Watchers, four journalists and two medics are banished to an uncharted world after a ship's mutiny. To survive, they must murder and feed upon the only edible matter on the planet — sentient, telepathic beings.\n\nAll six of them go mad in their own ways, living with their daily crime while they wait on the slender hope that rescue will someday come for them.\n\nA solid three stars.\n\nNeighbor, by Robert Silverberg\n\nby Jack Gaughan\n\nSilverberg pens another intimate piece, on the most local of politics: the rivalry between two neighbors. On a planet of vast holdings, old McDermott builds an enormous tower in full view of the Holt estate. For decades, Holt amasses a huge arsenal, waiting for the chance to get even. But when the opportunity finally presents itself, can he take it?\n\nThe author described it to me as \"a pretty good character study.\" It's told with a certain degree of style, anyway. Three stars.\n\nThe Delegate from Guapanga, by Wyman Guin\n\nby Virgil Finlay\n\nLastly, we have Wyman Guin's first piece in eight years. It's really been too long — this is a wonderful piece. Guin presents us an alien culture (if not an alien race) on the eve of election time. Only the telepathically capable, the elite and the \"cupra\" half-breeds, are franchised; the two dominant parties are the conservative Mentalists, favoring peace, polygamy, and interbreeding of the telepathically gifted and ungifted, and the Matterists, who value work, monogamy, moral purity, and the invasion of Earth.\n\nIt's a most appropriate story for our politically fraught year of 1964, and the storytelling and worldbuilding are quite good.\n\nFour stars.\n\nSumming Up\n\nAll told, even with the inferior Cordwainer (and it's not horrible), I imagine you could get a lot more pleasure out of the latest Galaxy than a trip to San Francisco's convention. It's cheaper, too.\n\nAnyone want to lay odds on the next issue versus the DNC convention?"
