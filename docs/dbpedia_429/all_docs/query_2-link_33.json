A corpse is found in an Icelandic fishing village harbour. Is this the result of an accident or was it foul play? Eyes are on Officer Gunnhildur in order to find out. She looks into a web of corruption that traces back to major businesses and banks in Iceland. To make things more complicated, a newbie reporter is trying to get a scoop off of her and a blogger is not making things easier. And then, a second body is added to the picture.\n\nShop Worldwide: Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk | Amazon.ca\n\nWe do our best to get everything listed but the occasional book gets by us.
