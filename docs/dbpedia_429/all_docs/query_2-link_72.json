        "text": "Snow\n\nby Orhan Pamuk, translated by Maureen Freely\n\n436pp, Faber, £16.99\n\nOrhan Pamuk's new novel is set in the early 1990s in Kars, a remote and dilapidated city in eastern Anatolia famed less for its mournful relics of Armenian civilisation and Russian imperial rule than for its spectacularly awful weather. Snow, \"kar\" in Turkish, falls incessantly on the treeless plains and the castle, river and boulevards of Kars, which the local scholars say takes its name from \"karsu\" (snow-water).\n\nIn this novel, the city is cut off from the world and also, to an extent, from normal literary reality by three days of unremitting snow. Written, the reader is told, between 1999 and 2001, Snow deals with some of the large themes of Turkey and the Middle East: the conflict between a secular state and Islamic government, poverty, unemployment, the veil, the role of a modernising army, suicide and yet more suicide. Pamuk's master here is Dostoevsky, but amid the desperate students, cafés, small shopkeepers, gunshots and inky comedy are the trickeries familiar from modern continental fiction. The result is large and expansive, but, even at 436 pages, neither grand nor heavy.\n\nPamuk's hero is a dried-up poet named Kerim Alakusoglu, conveniently abbreviated to Ka: Ka in kar in Kars. After many years in political exile in Frankfurt, Ka returns to Istanbul to attend his mother's funeral. He is then commissioned by an Istanbul newspaper to write an article about the municipal elections in Kars and investigate a succession of suicides by women and girls in the city. In his role as journalist, Ka trudges through the snow interviewing the families of the girls. He learns that they are committing suicide because of pressure by the college authorities to take off their headscarves in class. (Compulsory unveiling succeeds just as well as compulsory veiling, which is not very well.)\n\nIt soon emerges that Ka is not greatly interested in headscarves but has come to fall in love with his old Istanbul schoolmate, Ipek, who has ended up in Kars and is separated from her husband. Meanwhile, his lyric gift returns to him with a force bordering on incontinence, and he is forever plunging into tea houses to get his latest poem down in a green notebook. Another narrator, called Orhan Pamuk, tells the story not from the notebook, which is lost or stolen, but from notes in Ka's handwriting that he finds four years later in the poet's flat in Frankfurt.\n\nThe book is full of winning characters, from Ka himself to Blue, a handsome Islamist terrorist with the gift of the gab, an actor-manager and his wife who tour small Anatolian towns staging revolutionary plays and coups de main, and Serdar Bey, the local newspaper editor, who has a habit of writing up events and running them off his ancient presses before they occur. There are many fine scenes, including one where a hidden tape records the last conversation between a college professor in a bakery and his Islamist assassin.\n\nYet there are literary judgments that some readers will question. The first is to omit Ka's poems. The green book has been lost or stolen and what remain are Ka's notes on how he came to write his 19 poems in Kars and how they might be arranged on the crystalline model of a snowflake. That is quite as dull as it sounds: really, in a book so expansive and light, the only dull passages. Incidentally, what verse there is in the book, copied from the wall of the tea-shop, is worth reading. One senses that Ka is a poet visiting Kars because the poet Pushkin visited Kars (on June 12 and 13 1829).\n\nPamuk also decides to stage his two narrative climaxes as theatre. The first of these, in which soldiers fire live rounds into the audience from the stage of the National Theatre in Kars during a live television broadcast, is a fine job of writing and translating, but the effect is the same as with the descriptions of Ka's poems. The second literary layer makes the matters at issue both fainter and less persuasive. Pamuk likes to undermine and destabilise each character by introducing a degenerate counterpart: not merely Ka/Pamuk, but Ipek and her almost-as-beautiful sister Kadife, the two Islamist students Necib and Fazil, and so on.\n\nThis playfulness or irony may be a response to a literary dilemma. To use a European literary form such as the novel in Turkey is, in an important sense, to ally oneself with European notions of individualism, liberty and democracy that even when they are upheld (rather than breached) are meaningless to traditional Muslims. Liberty in Islam is the liberty to be a Muslim, democracy likewise, individualism likewise.\n\nPamuk knows that as well as anybody and dramatises it in a raucous scene in which a group of leftists, Kurds and Islamists gather in a hotel room to write a letter to the Frankfurter Rundschau. He also anticipates his critics by having Serdar Bey accuse Ka in the Border Gazette of being so \"ashamed of being a Turk that you hide your true name behind the fake, foreign, counterfeit name of Ka\". In fact, the best sentences in the book are those entirely without any playfulness, or indeed any artistry, such as this one, where Ka remembers the almost permanent state of military coup d'état of his Istanbul childhood: \"As a child he'd loved those martial days like holidays.\"\n\nA more serious challenge to novelists in Turkey, Iran and the Arab world is that the events of September 11, the Moscow theatre attack and Abu Ghraib are both more romantic and more desperate than even Dostoevsky could have dreamed up and written down."
