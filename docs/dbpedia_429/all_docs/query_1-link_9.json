        "text": "Michael Janeway's study of President Johnson, which was scheduled for August publication, has been postponed until next spring, Viking Press has announced. The book, tentatively titled “Room for Maneuver: Lyndon Johnson — A Political Education, 1937‐1960,” will present an analysis of the social forces and professional experiences that molded President Johnson's political philosophy and way of working, emphasizing the sources and character of his liberalism. The author, who is 23 years old, has based his book on his honors thesis for A.B. degree in history at Harvard University in 1962, which won him a Shaw Traveling Fellowship.\n\n*\n\n“The Fortress That Never Was,” by Rodney G. Minott, is an explanation of why the Russian armies beat the Western Allies to Berlin and Prague in April, 1945. The author, a young American historian at Stanford University, studied the German, American and British records. He tells why Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gen. Omar N. Bradley accepted the “myth” of the so‐called “National Redoubt” and directed their troops into the Bavarian Alps rather than eastward. The book will be published by Holt, Rinehart & Winson, on Aug. 3."
