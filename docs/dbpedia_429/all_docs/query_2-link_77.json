        "text": "COMPANY OF ADVENTURERS Volume One. By Peter C. Newman. Illustrated. 413 pp. New York: Viking. $25. ONE long evening long ago in northern Canada an unhappy man named James Isham smashed a blood-bloated mosquito onto the page of his personal journal, right next to an anguished entry about the insect swarms that dominate summer life in that part of the world to this day.\n\nHis journal entry, one of thousands written with goose quill and frigid fingers over the centuries as the top of North America was being unlocked by enterprising traders, may or may not have been read by Isham's corporate sponsors in faraway London. But two-and-a-half centuries later, along comes Peter C. Newman, a professional writer of considerable curiosity, with a sharp eye for detail and a knack for storytelling. He uses this journal entry and others, combined with impressive independent research, to weave the fascinating tale of the Hudson's Bay Company, ''the oldest continuous capitalist corporation still in existence.''\n\nMost readers in the United States think the taming of this continent began somewhere on the East Coast. But if the Pilgrims landed on forbidding, harsh shores in Massachusetts, imagine how the fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company felt when they set foot on the desolate, frozen shores of Hudson Bay, about 2,000 miles northwest of Boston. The bay remains desolate to this day, frozen into a natural cycle of nine months' winter and three months when the sledding is poor.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, the 17th-century brainchild of tight-fisted and shrewd London financiers with two interests - furs and the bottom line - was created by royal charter as part of a grand British imperialist strategy to squeeze the French in Quebec between Britain's American colonies and the rest of North America. The company was given as its territory nearly 40 percent of what became Canada from Labrador to the Pacific, as well as sizable portions of Minnesota and the Dakotas. In their successful pursuit of beaver skins and their competitors from the North West Company, and in their unsuccessful search for the fabled Northwest Passage, the hardy employees of the H.B.C. (many say the initials really stand for Here Before Christ) ended up exploring much of the continent and the Arctic, releasing its lucrative trade potential and bequeathing to posterity a treasure trove of detailed personal material on how they lived."
