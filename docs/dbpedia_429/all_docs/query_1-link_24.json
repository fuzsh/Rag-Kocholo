Then I took down my tree and other decorations and cleaned up the mess & put away my cards. It was bright and clear except for one brief spell of fog. Got fairly warm in the afternoon. The students are visiting the Branens and the Huffers.\n\nJanuary 2, 1964\n\nI drove to Enid to see Mrs. Hawkins, found her still too complaining not like her long, patient suffering. In the evening the Gradwohl family called, but soon had to leave because the children were too tired and sleepy\n\nJanuary 3, 1964\n\nBright day, wind from north, I took some Kennedy material down to the O’Neill’s and enjoyed seeing them so much I spent the evening. It is a great pleasure to talk with those two bright young people. Ramona got some cake and tea and we talked some more.\n\nJanuary 4, 1964\n\nCold and bright in the morning but warmed up. I drove over to Stillwater, had dinner with the Fischers and spent the afternoon Started home just after sunset and had the glory of this strange red sky all the way home.\n\nJanuary 5, 1964\n\nI had a fine S.S. class, then church (communion service). In the evening had dinner basket dinner at the church, and congregational meeting afterwards. Adopted 1964 budget, elected some officers, listened to some reports, and unanimously passed declaration of open membership without regard to race, class, or ethnic origins.\n\nJanuary 6, 1964\n\nRev. John Gradwohl called briefly about a news item. Also Pat O’Neill dropped by. I took a bowl of “ruby red” jello salad to Mabel Bryson. Mabel has flu and looks very thin and ill.\n\nJanuary 7, 1964\n\nOlga Schaefer called saying she had been to see Mabel. Found her much better, but weak.\n\nJanuary 8, 1964\n\nWomen’s Guild meeting at church. Good program by Elsie Seefeldt.\n\nJanuary 9, 1964\n\nTurned two pages. Olga called saying she had been to see Mabel – found her much better. Attended a very pleasant reception at Zion church in O.C. for the new conference minister & his wife, Rev, & Mrs. Craig. I rode down with Paul & Horene Schler – enjoyed the visit with them.\n\nJanuary 10, 1964\n\nNothing in particular happened. We have been having pleasant weather ever since Christmas. This evening I found Pearl Burchardt was about helpless with a sudden attack of arthritis in her hip. I took care of her and put her to bed.\n\nJanuary 11, 1964\n\nPearl was not better this morning. I did somethings for her and then called Edith Holloway from Stillwater. Nora Frank brought her a good dinner. Edith came shortly after noon and called the doctor. Pearl is not ill, only the arthritis pain.\n\nJanuary 12, 1964\n\nIt turned very cold during the night – some snow fell, and more this morning, high wind. A fair congregation at church. I taught my class. Edith had to return to Stillwater in the evening. I took got Pearl’s supper, spent the evening with her, and settled her for the night. I suppose the temperature is about 7ᵒ.\n\nJanuary 13, 1964\n\nClear day, warmed up gradually. I got up at six and got my own breakfast, then took care of Pearl, also got her dinner and supper. Elmer came this evening with Jerry to stay overnight. She is better. I took time off for a conference with Ramona and one with Mabel.\n\nJanuary 14, 1964\n\nElmer and Jerry got Pearl’s breakfast. I had a meeting in my house of the international hospitality committee 9 to 10, made plans for between semesters Jan. 24. In the afternoon attended club at Almeda Grassman’s. Fine program by Ramona. I got Pearl’s dinner and supper. Elmer is staying tonight.\n\nJanuary 15, 1964\n\nEdith Holloway spent the afternoon with her mother, worked like a whirlwind washing, cleaning house, etc. She wanted to take her mother home with her but Pearl didn’t want to go. She is O.K. here – not sick only very lame. I can cook her meals, all the neighbors come in and do for her. Elmer and Jerry with her at night. She is slowly improving Lovely weather.\n\nJanuary 16, 1964\n\nI am still cooking two of Pearl’s meals. Elmer and Jerry stay overnight with her and cook her breakfast. She does not improve much, but the doctor came today and said she was doing as well as could be expected.\n\nJanuary 17, 1964\n\nPearl is really better today. She dressed and sat in the living room. Elmer brought Jerry to take care of her over the week end. He called me and said he would get her supper. He is such a good child – will stay with her till he has to go back to school Monday\n\nJanuary 18, 1964\n\nSpent the day Zion Church in O.C. – an association S. S. Teachers of the Okla. Assn. of the church preparing the next semester’s course. I was greatly interested in the study of the pictures – new and very modern but meaningful. The Brysons and Evadean and I went down besides the pastor & family. Pearl not any better this evening\n\nJanuary 19, 1964\n\nNice warm day. I even wore my spring suit to church. I had a fine S.S. class. Good crowd at church – nearly all the seats full. Edith Holloway took her mother to Stillwater. She has not improved very much the past week.\n\nJanuary 20, 1964\n\nDrove to Enid to see Mrs. Hawkins – spent most of the time with her writing letters. She seems more like herself but still hates the nurse, lovely warm day.\n\nJanuary 21, 1964\n\nSpent the forenoon at a meeting of the library board. With Winnie Branen as librarian we are really getting things done.\n\nJanuary 22, 1964\n\nCalled Mrs. Levin and she tells me we shall have twelve students to visit us Friday. Lovely day.\n\nJanuary 23, 1964\n\nSpent much time at the school arranging visits to various classes for the foreign students who are coming tomorrow. So lovely and warm I turned my furnace off in the afternoon.\n\nJanuary 24, 1964\n\nColder, with disagreeable wind. Three of us took cars to Stillwater, brought back eleven foreign students to visit in homes and at school. It seemed a very happy occasion for our people and them. One couple from India, the rest men.\n\nJanuary 25, 1964\n\nNice day, a little crisp in the morning but warmed up.\n\nJanuary 26, 1964\n\nI had a wonderful S.S. class today. The young people had charge of the church service – a beautiful service – except that the pastor preached the sermon, good sermon. Nelle Thomas came to visit me this P.M. Later I called on Vernon Fickin, who is ill. Lovely day.\n\nJanuary 27, 1964\n\n[No entry]\n\nJanuary 28, 1964\n\nAttended club at Ramona O’Neill’s – good meeting, but I drew an assignment to write the year’s history for federation files.\n\nJanuary 29, 1964\n\nWorked on a club history I must get mailed tomorrow. In the evening Pat and Ramona O’Neill and young, charming father Helenh Hellinghausen came and I showed my Russian pictures. Then we talked as usual about politics – upon which we are all agreed. Sprinkling this evening.\n\nJanuary 30, 1964\n\nDark rainy day – not much moisture I’m afraid but better than none. I finished and mailed my club history. Worked so hard I didn’t even remember it was my birthday – or at least scarcely thought of it.\n\nJanuary 31, 1964\n\nDrove to Stillwater and am staying with Idress Cash. We saw Saroyan’s “The Cave Dwellers” by the university theater guild. Very well done. Cloudy this morning, clear this afternoon, warm all day. My plumbing clogged just before I left. Oh yes, I visited Cherrie Garrett.\n\nFebruary 1, 1964\n\nSpent morning talking with Idress. Got home about noon. Woodrow Winburn opened up my plumbing but I should get Joe to go under the house. Weather so lovely one can hardly believe it. I baked cookies for a reception at the church tomorrow.\n\nFebruary 2, 1964\n\nMean windy day. I had a fine S.S. class and attended church (better sermon than usual). In afternoon my young friend Edward Oliver and his parents and aunt called. Pearl Burchardt came home, able to walk O. K. but still some pain in leg. In the evening pastor was installed – very fine sermon by Rev. Geo. Ellerbrake of O.C. Reception afterwards.\n\nFebruary 3, 1964\n\nSome sprinkling in morning but cleared off. Joe Miser came but decided it was best to leave my plumbing as it is since the drain is open now.\n\nFebruary 4, 1964\n\nRained all day – quiet drizzle, but with last week’s rain it was more than an inch, and none ran off. Nice and warm.\n\nFebruary 5, 1964\n\nCleared off but seems to be turning cold this evening. Clouds in the west that look like snow. I went to Guild, not many there on account of the mud. Good lesson by Mabel Bryson.\n\nFebruary 6, 1964\n\nClear and nice though rather cold this morning. In fact I used the tumbler at the automat instead of hanging up my wash in the high north wind. I called on the O’Neill’s but didn’t stay long because Ramona looked ill.\n\nFebruary 7, 1964\n\nNice day. Attended a meeting at the library to encourage the reading of books.\n\nFebruary 8, 196[4]\n\nNice day. I am working on a report I must give at club. Jim Edwards called briefly to ask about a writer named Cantonwine who wrote a book about the 46th Star in 1911. I never heard of him.\n\nFebruary 9, 1964\n\nI had a rather small S.S. class, Heard a good sermon. (Rev. John is improving) Worked in the afternoon on a report for Club Tuesday. Would do it tomorrow but Lucille Barr and a man from Hennessey are coming. Warm day.\n\nFebruary 10, 196[4]\n\nWorked on club program – life and work of Geo. Catlin. Lucille Barr, Mr. Dinkler and Mrs. Wickstrom came for some historical background to be used in a pageant for April 22.\n\nFebruary 11, 1964\n\nClub at Margaret Perdue’s. Very small attendance, several sick. I had the program. In the evening went to lodge room to practice for initiation. I have not been attending lodge since the first half of last year.\n\nFebruary 12, 1964\n\nI worked on the background of the pageant and got it but didn’t get much done. Miserable dark day, some rain once, feels as though it could snow. In the evening went to lenten [sic] service, used pictures, very interesting. I seem to have a cold coming on\n\nFebruary 13, 1964\n\nFinished what I promised to do for the Hennessey people – mailed it to the company they have employed to put on the pageant. It was clear this morning – the threatened storm missed us. I am really feeling a cold coming.\n\nFebruary 14, 1964\n\nCold bothered me much during the night. Thought I would have to call Mabel in the morning and say I couldn’t take my part in World Day of Prayer. But coffee helped and I went on. Very fine service – at our church this time. Slept in afternoon. Feel much better this evening.\n\nFebruary 15, 1964\n\nRained last night but cleared up during the afternoon. I kept the library in this afternoon. My cold still making me about very uncomfortable.\n\nFebruary 16, 1964\n\nStill ill with the cold. But I taught my S.S. class. (It isn’t flu or I wouldn’t have exposed people.) Didn’t stay for church. In the afternoon Hulda and Richard Weber celebrated their golden wedding – such a good 50 years! First a beautiful simple service in the church – then a reception in the basement.\n\nFebruary 17, 1964\n\nFelt bad this morning but improved during the day. Virtually well this evening. It rained all afternoon – a slow drizzle. Not cold.\n\nFebruary 18, 1964\n\nClear, beautiful spring morning with clean sky and clean air – got a little windy in the afternoon. I am all over my cold but some hoarseness.\n\nFebruary 19, 1964\n\nStarted work on a report of the library improvement initiated by the Marshall Woman’s Club. We are entering it in a Community Improvement Contest.\n\nFebruary 20, 1964\n\nMore hard work on my report.\n\nFebruary 21, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class (small crowd) and attended church. In the afternoon worked on my report. More hard work on my report.\n\nFebruary 22, 1964\n\nMore hard work on my report. Dianne Phelan and Cue boy married. I didn’t attend – wasn’t invited, not a special friend though I do like the family very much.\n\nFebruary 23, 1964\n\nTaught my S. S. class (small attendance) and attended church. In the afternoon worked on my club report.\n\nFebruary 24, 1964\n\nWorked hard on my report. Got it finished only proof-reading and writing some summaries. Tomorrow I must go to the City to a meeting of State Council of Churches committee on Christian social concern.\n\nFebruary 25, 1964\n\nDark day. I started to City – came back because afraid of snow or freezing rain. Worked on report some, attended Club in P.M. When I started home my windshield was completely iced over. Anita Shulty helped me, scraped a little hole so I could drive 3 blocks home. Glad I didn’t go to the City.\n\nFebruary 26, 1964\n\nAfter yesterday’s entry went to Pat Oneills’ to watch Maria Tallchief dance on their new TV- impressed mainy[sic] with how bad TV is even with Maria Tallchief. Then we listened on radio to Cassius Clay win heavyweight boxing title over Liston. Upset. Clear today – storm over, still rather cold. Worked on report.\n\nFebruary 27, 1964\n\nIla Smith came this morning and did some last minute pasting, etc. We packaged the report and she mailed it. I spent rest of day catching up on writing, especially to Mary Shank, who has much to worry about. Drove to see Mrs. Hawkins in the afternoon. She is really gaining strength.\n\nFebruary 28, 1964\n\nSpent the day catching up on letters neglected during writing of club report. Especially concerned about Mary Shank, who has much to worry her. I wrote quite a long letter to her.\n\nFebruary 29, 1964\n\nWasted time today reading a book Paul Gallio’s Mrs. ‘Arris Goes to New York, when I should have been working. In the evening went to shower at Lion’s Den for Mary Murphy, who is to marry Bill Voskuhl a week from today. Miserable windy day – from south, March weather; leap year calendar.\n\nMarch 1, 1964\n\nLovely spring day – I turned off the furnace in the afternoon; I had a good S. S. class, heard a pretty good sermon. Called people for a meeting of international hospitality committee at my house Tuesday.\n\nMarch 2, 1964\n\nI cleaned my house. And how it needed it! Worked a little on Guild lesson for Wednesday.\n\nMarch 3, 1964\n\nHeld meeting at my house of the Inter. Hosp. Commee to plan for Easter vacation. In afternoon got my lesson all ready for Guild tomorrow. Busy day tomorrow. In the evening I have chaplain’s part in lodge initiation.\n\nMarch 4, 1964\n\nStarted to walk fast down town and encountered Bill Voskuhl and was thrown hard on pavement. Poor Bill! He was so distressed. I suffered a good bit. Olga Schaefer took me home. The doctor came – no bones broken but much pain all along my torso from waist up. It snowed so they called off Guild & lodge initiation. It cleared up before night but ground covered at first.\n\nMarch 5, 1964\n\nI suffered pretty bad all night – stayed with Schefers[sic]. In morning felt much better and Olga took me home. Suffering got so bad in the evening I thought some one should have a key to my house, so at 10:00 I called Olga. She came and took me home again.\n\nMarch 6, 1964\n\nSuffered terribly all night. In morning I called Raymond Bryson and he and Mabel took me to Enid to Dr. Duffy and have X ray No broken bones but had calcium deficiency in backbone. Suffered pretty bad after I got home.\n\nMarch 7, 1964\n\nSuffered terribly all night and all morning but started feeling better before noon. This evening making back diary entries. People are wonderful. Olga here twice, Gerry brought my dinner, Mabel took my clothes to wash. Alice Potter and Raymond O’Neill & Mrs. Stuerke all here. Roberta Deboard here several times a day. Also Madonna Enmeier here today.\n\nMarch 8, 1964\n\nDwight Rusco came by to say his mother died this afternoon. It snowed hard all forenoon, melted off this p.m. I feel about the same – improvement slow if any. People so good – Ramona, Mabel, Claudia, Frances Picken, Fern Seefeldt, Roberta all called\n\n[March 9]\n\nMarch 9, 1964\n\nMarch 8 Last night not so bad. I suffered some and got up twice for an hour or so but slept the rest of the time. People are so wonderful. Olga, Mabel, Lavonne Phelan and several others called. Lavonne brought some jello dessert. Dwight Rusco came by and said his mother is very low – the end I think.\n\nMarch 10, 1964\n\nI had a much better night and felt much better today. Saturday after my bad night I called Dr. Duffy and he promised to put some tablets in the mail to relieve the pain. They came yesterday and I used them and they worked. When the pain got too bad I took one – didn’t get up to try to work it off.\n\nMarch 11, 1964\n\nAnother better night (and better day). After my bad nights it has taken most of the forenoon to get the pain under control. This time I managed it easily. People coming in all the time. They are so wonderful. Among them today were Vernon and Roberta Bostick.\n\nMarch 12, 1964\n\nAnother better night and good day. In the afternoon Mabel and Raymond took me to the graveside service for Mrs. Hubbard. The day was warm and I stood it fine. I still have much company and offers of help though I think busy people can quit me now. I can manage alone.\n\nMarch 13, 1964\n\nI drove my car to the post office this afternoon. I still have much soreness, but not where it interferes with driving. Pat O’Neill spent the evening with me. I do enjoy his brilliant conversation. He came to see if I want to attend a Civil Liberties meeting March 19.\n\nMarch 14, 1964\n\nI got a permanent today. My hair was terrible. I had scheduled a permanent for last week, but alas. By bending the right way I managed fine. I drove my own car and even went to the store and got groceries.\n\nMarch 15, 1964\n\nI taught my S.S. class I had not felt like preparing a lesson and so we read and discussed it together. I also attended church. It seemed as though I had been out a year instead of one week. It was a beautiful warm day. They have landscaped the church lot with evergreens. They are beautiful.\n\nMarch 16, 1964\n\nWarm day. Shocked to learn that lovely Eva Dean Huffer must have a serious operation. And Alice Draper is in the hospital at Shattuck after an operation Two of my favorite families struck.\n\nMarch 17, 1964\n\nI’m not much good – no serious pain but quite lame and no strength. I have to lie down every afternoon.\n\nMarch 18, 1964\n\nI’m still pretty weak. I did make some date bread to take to Leo Leo Draper and the Huffers. It started raining softly this evening and the lights went off. Still off at bedtime. I used candle. Hope I can get along without my electric blanket and pad.\n\nMarch 19, 1964\n\nLights came on in the night. Rained all night I think, also in forenoon. Lovely warm soft rain. In p.m. I took my bread to Leo Draper & Huffers. Wheat vivid green & thick on ground. In evening Pat & Mona O’Neill took me to ACLU meeting in O.C. – very interesting. We talked afterwards, got home at 12:20. Weather turned clear and cold. I stood the trip fine, used cushion in car. Didn’t hurt any more than if I had stayed at home.\n\nMarch 20, 1964\n\nSnowed all morning. I didn’t want to venture out, so Ramona brought my mail and groceries. Ground white. In the afternoon it quit and soon melted. Open house at the library all day. At 2:00 a program in our church basement. Very nice only people were supposed to go to the library afterwards and they didn’t go. I spoke briefly at the program giving history of library. It was Founders Day – March 20, 1936.\n\nMarch 21, 1964\n\nI’m a long way from well. I manage to do a little and then rest. Still much pain and weakness. Today my small task was to make some date bread for Tues. – club tea and I may have a foreign student visitor. I invited him before I knew how I should feel . It was 24ᵒ last night, heavy white frost this morning.\n\nMarch 22, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class. Didn’t stay for church. Went to bed in the p.m.; then got up and cleaned my house superficially, first time in 3 weeks. I may have a visitor Tuesday. It seems good to be rid of the dust and lint that accumulated since I was hurt hurt.\n\nMarch 23, 1964\n\nI didn’t hear from the student I invited, so am in dark. But Mabel Bryson, who has invited one student, asked me to bring him to her house for dinner if he comes – says two as easy as one. I promised the day I was before I was hurt to take a car and I will – driving is the easiest thing I do.\n\nMarch 24, 1964\n\nAlmeda Grassman and I drove over and got ten students. The boy I had asked didn’t come, but an extra did. We took them to the Co-op, then to homes. I had dinner at the Brysons with two; then we went to tea at our Club. Then I went to bed. At 8 went to meeting of S.S. teachers at the church. Got thru the day wonderfully – best day yet.\n\nMarch 25, 1964\n\nSnowed a little and ice froze on windshields this forenoon – cleared off this afternoon. No bad effects from my strenuous day yesterday. Still sore, slept much of afternoon.\n\nMarch 26, 1964\n\nService at church this evening but I didn’t go. I promised to show slides to Gerry Schaefer’s American Literature class tomorrow.\n\nMarch 27, 1964\n\nBeautiful weather. I showed slides to Gerry’s class. An album I ordered of Kennedy speeches came. I played it – found it very fine. the O’Neills and I each ordered one – rather Pat ordered for both of us. Good Friday service, this evening but I did not attend.\n\nMarch 28, 1964\n\nNelle Thomas brought Cora June Horsfield and Minnie Nelson (forget her present name) for a brief visit. We knew each other long ago. Mabel and Raymond gave me a record of the “March on Washington” for civil rights. It is very moving – but since then Kennedy has been murdered and still Congress has not acted.\n\nMarch 29, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class & stayed for church – communion service. Pearl Boyce and her sister called briefly in the afternoon. I played my “March on Washington” and my Kennedy album again this evening or rather afternoon.\n\nMarch 30, 1964\n\nFirst day I haven’t had to go back to bed in the afternoon but I’m still lame. I wrote a book review that was due March 15, then wrote letters. My best day so far. It sprinkled most of the day – cleared off in late afternoon. The mocking bird is here!\n\nMarch 31, 1964\n\nWorked on an index for Redlands Press (Mr. Hinkel) – very interesting book by an illiterate – Ellsworth Collings. At least I think this is the day I did it – am writing late. No, I did this later. Guess I wrote constitution for library\n\nApril 1, 1964\n\nWent to Guild – Thelma Ficken had very interesting lesson.\n\nApril 2, 1964\n\nPerhaps this was day I worked on index. See March 31. Or perhaps wrote letters.\n\nApril 3, 1964\n\nLooks like rain this evening. I was very tired. Went to bed early. I have managed to stay up all day all this week, but very tired every evening. Cold day.\n\nApril 4, 1964\n\nApparently rained all night – off and on all day. We are very happy about it.\n\nApril 5, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class & attended church.\n\nApril 6, 1964\n\nMade out my federal income tax – had to write for blanks for state tax. Very tired tonight. I still have so much pain it wears me out by evening.\n\nApril 7, 1964\n\nDrove to Stillwater to see govt. profs about civil rights. I want to see if one will come over and explain to our people about bill before Senate. My best day – feeling pretty well this evening.\n\nApril 8, 1964\n\nCold day. Drove to Hennessey to see their 75th anniversary celebration (early so Guthrie can have April 22). Enjoyed dinner of pioneers, open house at their fine library. Pageant in evening directed by an Ohio firm was terrible. Am staying with Lucille Barr.\n\nApril 9, 1964\n\nI had a very bad night – apparently because Lucille’s perfectly good bed has no feather bed and I am too sore to be on a mattress. I came back in the morning and spent the day resting. Cold this morning but warming up.\n\nApril 10, 1964\n\nI felt really bad today. Perhaps the cold at the pageant settled in all the sore places I have. I was so encouraged Tuesday, but have gone back gain. Ramona took my record player to Enid.\n\nApril 11, 1964\n\nI feel better today. Ray and Gladys Six came by briefly – or was it Apr. 10? I am writing late. I made out (and sent off) my state income tax report.\n\nApril 12, 1964\n\nI taught my S.S. class & attended church. Terrible day, one of the worst I ever saw. High gale and dust. Unpleasant in morning, increased in ferocity after noon. From south most of the day, then changed to north. Calmed down this evening. Fortunately not cold. I should have been afraid to use the furnace at the height of the gale.\n\nApril 13, 1964\n\nLovely day after yesterday. I felt better worked on index to Cr. Collings’ book and did some small necessary chores in the yard. I am enjoying the mocking bird.\n\nApril 14, 1964\n\nViolet Poindexter and her mother came from New Orleans and spent the forenoon with me. In the p.m. I went to club – made preliminary plans for Dr. Carpenter to come from OSU and explain civil rights bill. This evening Burton and Dorine called. It was wonderful to hear their voices on the telephone.\n\nApril 15, 1964\n\nI worked on the index to Collings’ book.\n\nApril 16, 1964\n\nI cleaned my house superficially and got very tired. It was clean when I had my accident and I have managed twice since to hit the high places. Its last good cleaning was just before I got hurt. It has started raining ton tonight. We need it badly.\n\nApril 17, 1964\n\nRained ¼ inch last night. The Home Dem. Club gave a party to us “senior citizens.” (Silly expression.) It was a very nice party. They had everything ready last fall for a Xmas party and then it stormed. I got a cheap but pretty hat at Catherine Christian’s store – and wore it to the party.\n\nApril 18, 1964\n\nIt rained a little last night but not much. Cleared off this afternoon. We are having very warm weather. I worked on selecting pictures for talks I am to give tomorrow and Monday – promises I made before got hurt. It will be hard.\n\nApril 19, 1964\n\nI taught my S.S. class and drove to Stillwater without staying for church. Am visiting Alice Moffitt In the afternoon I showed pictures of England to an A.AUW international relations group. I was so good to myself and Alice was so good to me that I got through the day without getting tired. Feel wonderful tonight.\n\nApril 20, 1964\n\nDrove to Ponca this forenoon – it rained on me day off and on. Had lunch with Mrs. Ross & Mrs. Dixon. In the afternoon showed slides I took behind the Iron Curtain. Hard drive back because of high wind. Got home at five tired, but rested a while, and went to community meeting to plan visit of Dr. Carpenter of OSU to explain Civil Rights Bill now before Senate.\n\nApril 21, 1964\n\nIn the morning I wrote letters and Winnie and I talked about Dr. Carpenter – also I wrote newspaper articles about him. In the afternoon I went to visit Mrs. Hawkins, first time since my injury. Found her improved. In the evening I started to put my slides back in their cases and had so much pain I had to go to bed.\n\nApril 22, 1964\n\nFinished making slips of index. Put them on the table and worked at alphabetizing them. The position hurt my back so I had to go to bed. I can’t stand to lean forward and work. Bad cloud went north. Later – tornado at Fairmont, Billings, Tonkawa.\n\nApril 23, 1964\n\nWorked on typing index of Collings book. Had to lie down twice but rested enough so I watered my flowers. They have needed it sadly but this is the first time I have been able to do it.\n\nApril 24, 1964\n\n[No entry]\n\nApril 25, 1964\n\nRalph Cooper came to visit me this afternoon. In the evening I went to a shower at church for Sherry Tarrant and Vernon Ficken, two wonderful young people who will be married soon – with my complete approval.\n\nApril 26, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class. Rev. John gone so Mr. Pendleton of Philips preached. Fine sermon. My back got very tired resting it on the hard seat back – I lay down an hour before I started dinner. Wilson Talbot called with Glendora Hammer. She looks surprisingly young and vital. I haven’t seen her for about fifty years – not since about 1913. Spent a very pleasant evening with the young O’Neills.\n\nApril 27, 1964\n\nI learned by accident that the young Givens family vacated my house yesterday Friday without telling me. (Their April rent is paid.) I found the house very filthy. Got a man to haul off junk, engaged Dorothy Elmore to paper all the rooms, must have cleaning done also. Ann Givens was a terrible housekeeper.\n\nApril 28, 1964\n\nSelected paper for my rent house. Ordered a screen door. Felt a disturbing symptom so went to Enid to see the Dr. Duffy. He said it is not unusual with the hormones I have been taking the past two months – to stop for a week, then start again and come back in two more months. Jim O’Neill very low – in hospital at Enid.\n\nApril 29, 1964\n\nI am very fortunate getting Dorothy Elmore to paper my rent house and Roberta Allen to clean and paint the woodwork. They will start tomorrow. The cleaning is a real job. The house is filthy. Roberta is so pretty and gifted. I hate to have her wade into it.\n\nApril 30, 1964\n\nDr. Carpenter spoke to a very good crowd turn-out at the schoolhouse this evening. I hope his very able presentation dissipated some of the lies that are being circulated about the Civil Rights Bill. The audience was very responsive and asked a good many questions.\n\nMay 1, 1964\n\nMay Fellowship Day – at Xn church this year. We had luncheon. (I took chicken dumplings.) The service was mainly a very fine picture show about equal employment for Negroes. Woodrow Winburn took off my porch shingles to put on new ones and we had a lovely rain all afternoon and evening. It leaked some but not much.\n\nMay 2, 1964\n\nWoodrow started shingling as soon as the roof was dry. It has some old wood shingles that were left on, but it did leak yesterday. A violent rain would have drenched everything in my closet – bedding, books, clothing. Woodrow covered the unfinished part with a tarp fastened down with bricks.\n\nMay 3, 1964\n\nI taught my S.S. class and attended church. Got very tired and spent the p.m.in bed. It didn’t rain but it might tonight. I am glad the tarp is on the unshingled part. My peonies started blooming. I had two to take to church. Used iris for the alter vases – not enough peonies.\n\nMay 4, 1964\n\nWoodrow finished the shingles, so now it can rain. He has some trimming up to do. Dorothy Elmore finished painting the rent house Saturday. I paid her today $50.75.I finished my index.\n\nMay 5, 1964\n\nRoberta Allen finished cleaning and painting the rent house. This was a very bad day with a high wind. I attended a meeting of the library board this morning.\n\nMay 6, 1964\n\nThere was a fine rain last night – 1½ inches, the most moisture we have had all spring. Today was lovely. My peonies, iris, and old fashioned yellow roses are lovely. I attended Guild at Olga Schaefer’s.\n\nMay 7, 1964\n\nWent to Guild “workshop” (silly name) at Kingfisher. Enjoyed it very much – the most interesting one I ever attended (in fact the only interesting one). It was cloudy and threatened rain but didn’t do it. In the evening Burton called me and said he and Dorine were coming to visit me this week end. Yippee! I rented my house – young couple named Roberts.\n\nMay 8, 1964\n\nI did some things getting ready for Burton and Dorine but didn’t clean my house. I can’t stand much at a time. Have to stop and rest. They will leave after Burton’s work day is over at five – arrive late. Bless them. It Long and hard a trip to visit me.\n\nMay 9, 1964\n\nBurton and Dorine arrived a little after midnight. We have visited a lot but we all slept awhile this afternoon. In the evening I showed pics of England. We are not going to church tomorrow. They went with me to arrange some peonies in the vases on the altar.\n\nMay 10, 1964\n\nI had a dinner engagement with the Hinkels at Stillwater, so we all planned to leave at twelve. But it started raining a little so they left 20 minutes earlier. When I left at twelve it was a heavy downpour. I enjoyed my dinner and visit with the Hinkels – met Mrs. Siegal there. Drove home in a very heavy rain. Still raining. Burton and Dorine helped me so much I am scarcely tired.\n\nMay 11, 1964\n\nCool day – cold in fact. The clouds cleared away and the sky is so blue and everything lovely. I cleaned my house. Didn’t clean it before the Halsteds came – was trying to take it easy and I knew they would understand. They told me to take it easy.\n\nMay 12, 1964\n\nThe Marshall Woman’s Club met at my house today. First we went to the schoolhouse to see a picture. Cool beautiful day. This evening for the first time I have enjoyed the spring. Before this I was too tired – also the weather unpleasant, too dry and windy. Jim O’Neill died last night.\n\nMay 13, 1964\n\nMay 14 I reported on a MS I am reading read for the Uni. Of Okla, Press. I still have to take things slowly and rest often. Stet Entry O.K. for May 13.\n\nMay 14, 1964\n\nMay 15 Attended Jim O’Neill’s funeral at the Catholic Church. It rained a little this morning but not much. We have had real spring weather ever since the rain Sunday (2½ in.) – birds singing grass starting to choke out the weeds on the lawn, flowers blooming, air sweet and pure.\n\nMay 15, 1964\n\nSee last entry for May 15 May 14, 1964 I took Winnie Branen to Stillwater to look up some things in the college library – some to help us in our library here. It threatened rain but didn’t.\n\nMay 16, 1964\n\nLovely day but starting to get warm again. I kept the library this afternoon.\n\nMay 17, 1964\n\nI had a fine S.S. class. At the church service, Barbara and Ronnie Schaefer were confirmed also a communion service. The h.s. graduates wore their caps and gowns – their baccalaureate service was this evening but I didn’t attend. Went to a church assn. meeting at O.C. in the afternoon – bot back at ten. Rode with Paul Schler and delegates from Carrier and Goltry.\n\nMay 18, 1964\n\nAttended meeting of the Library Board in the afternoon. We can get a fine building used by Hennessey school and now surplus. Cost is $2200. If only we can raise the money.\n\nMay 19, 1964\n\nI drove to Stillwater to get Dr. Garnier to remove a tiny wart from the edge of my eyelid. Staying overnight with Alice Carlson. Went with her to monthly pot luck and business meeting of her S.S. class at the Baptist church.\n\nMay 20, 1964\n\nWent to visit Grace and Ruth Hammond in the morning (They rest in the P.M.). Then drove home. A little tired. The removal of the wart was not serious at all but the eye is a sensitive place.\n\nMay 21, 1964\n\nWrote some letters but in general I wasted the day. I am reading The Mountain Meadows Massacre by Juanita Brooks, and an interesting book has a very demoralizing effect on me if I read when I should work.\n\nMay 22, 1964\n\nMy new renter, attractive Mrs. Chas. Roberts came to ask me about churches. I told her of all of them and of course invited her to ours, also to Club meeting. They will move in Sunday. They will be an assett [sic] to the town. He works for Dale Wilson.\n\nMay 23, 1964\n\nEdna Stuerke Fraker died this morning. I drove to Enid this P.M. to see Ethel Hawkins. She has improved greatly since moving. I knew she had gained strength and weight & today I learned she had gained 13 lbs. But she is very dissatisfied because she has to follow the doctor’s orders. Says people have lost all their freedom. Mean windy day. I am amazed at how ripe the wheat is.\n\nMay 24, 1964\n\nLovely day. We had our annual outdoor church service and picnic at Pete Ficken’s. Very nice. In the evening the young O’Neills took me to O.C. t see a movie, “The Cardinal.” Very fine we got back at about one A.M.\n\nMay 25, 1964\n\nHot day. Winnie Branen, Mabel Bryson, Leota Windler and I drove to the City to Edna Fraker’s funeral in the afternoon. My air conditioner quit on the way down. Pauline Curry was going with us but fell when getting into the car and skinner her knee. Some barley came to the elevator.\n\nLibrary Me had our annual outdoor church service and picnic at Pete Ficken’s. Very nice. In the evening the Young O’Neills took me to O.C. to see a movie “The Cardinal.” Very fine. We go back at about one A.M.\n\nMay 26, 1964\n\nWe had our final melting and annual picnic of the Marshall Woman’s Club at Winnie Branen’s. The new officers were installed. I took up my new duties as reporter. I hate it but we all have to join in and work. Too few to allow any of us to loaf. My car air conditioner needed only a 10¢ fuse.\n\nMay 27, 1964\n\nWE have been having hot dry weather, but last night there was a “bank,” as my mother used to call it, in the west. Today it was cloudy and we had several quick, April-type showers. Not much water FELL. Della Post died this morning of cancer. A year ago she was a strong vital farm woman, active in clubs, industrious at home.\n\nMay 28, 1964\n\nToday was really cold. I would have used the furnace except that I had turned off my pilot light. I lighted my oven for warmth. In the afternoon I helped Winnie unpack a shipment of books for the library. In the evening I worked in the cemetery. The country is beautiful with the low sun shining across the ripe wheat.\n\nMay 29, 1964\n\nAttended Della’s funeral in the Xn Church at 10:30. It rained off and on and was cloudy all day except that the sun broke through a blue sky with fluffy clouds just as we came out of the church. I did not go to the cemetery but I hope the services there was over before the rain started again. Cold all day.\n\nMay 30, 1964\n\nTired of depending on the oven for warmth, so lighted the furnace. It rained all day. I didn’t go to the cemetery to decorate my graves, though most of the people did. I sewed all day – had to have some underwear. I had lilies and clematis – also peonies kept in the refrigerator – which I would have taken to the cemetery.\n\nMay 31, 1964\n\nI had a wonderful S.S. class. Good crowd at preaching service. It will slow down when harvest starts. I used some of my cut flowers in the church – then took them to the cemetery after church. I have 12 graves there. It cleared off this morning and was a beautiful day.\n\nJune 1, 1964\n\nLovely cool day. Blue sky, fresh air, bright sun. And the mocking bird! Ralph called. He had been at the cemetery. Had car trouble, so failed to get there earlier.\n\nJune 2, 1964\n\n[No entry]\n\nJune 3, 1964\n\nI went to Guild at Friend home. Good meeting, Lavonne Phelan leader. I took Lois Roberts, the lovely young woman in my rent house.\n\nJune 4, 1964\n\nIf it doesn’t rain tonight the harvest will start tomorrow. A little barley came in more than a week ago – no combining since.\n\nJune 5, 1964\n\nWe had a rain last night – only .13 inch but enough to stop the harvest. A load or two of barley came in late this afternoon.\n\nJune 6, 1964\n\nHarvest started this afternoon – going strong by night. Alice Carlson brought Dr. Rebekah Pate over to see it. They had dinner with me, then on to Alice’s brother’s near Waukomis. I wish they had stayed here for we could have given them a good show A long line of truck trucks on Main Street.\n\nJune 7, 1964\n\nHot windy day. Summer church hours started, S.S. at 9 which is always bad, then everybody tired so small attendance at S.S. A little better at church. Harvest going strong, long line of trucks still coming in at sundown\n\nJune 8, 1964\n\nHot day with very high wind. Good for harvest but hard on the people. Harvest in full blast. My regal lilies are glorious.\n\nJune 9, 1964\n\nHot windy day. Harvest progressing fast. At 9:30 this evening they were still combining (with lights) in Roy Beeby’s field across the road. I don’t know when they stopped. Big trucks still rushing to town at 9:30 loaded with wheat.\n\nJune 10, 1964\n\nHot day but that terrible wind has slowed down. Perfect harvest day, only dew in the morning. Combine running and wheat coming in from Roy Beeby’s field at 9:30 P.M. and I don’t know how much later. Senate fillibuster on Civil Rights Bill broken!\n\nJune 11, 1964\n\nLovely rain early this morning. Bright cool day. Rain not good for harvest but fine for my flower garden (so-called). About 75% of the grain is harvested. I think they got back in the field later this P.M. It won’t delay things much.\n\nJune 12, 1964\n\nAnother lovely light rain in the forenoon. Not good for harvest but very pleasant. In the afternoon the sun shone and it was a beautiful cool, bright day. I went out to see Eva Dean Huffer about a Guild lesson and Don showed me a new machine for dropping hay in windrows.\n\nJune 13, 1964\n\nAnother cool, lovely day, but no rain. I do not think it became dry enough for combining.\n\nJune 14, 1964\n\nHard shower last night – .6 inch. A quick lovely April shower, dusting church. Cleared off in afternoon. I taught my S.S. class and attended church. Lovely cool day.\n\nJune 15, 1964\n\nThey started combining this afternoon. I saw quite a line of trucks on the street this evening – nearly a block long. They worked into the night. Clouds all around but none here.\n\nJune 16, 1964\n\nIt didn’t rain today either. I am sure they must have got a lot of harvesting done this afternoon. I imagine most of it is done now. Nice day, not hot. Lovely and cool this evening.\n\nJune 17, 1964\n\nNo rain, lovely day. I have finally got time to make a final organization and identification of the slides I too made on our 1962 trip. Used notes I took at the time – also booklets, folders, etc.\n\nJune 18, 1964\n\nHot day with high wind. Unpleasant but just right for harvesting a few miles north where they had heavier rains than we did and the combines mired down. I continued on my slides but shall not have time to finish the collection.\n\nJune 19, 1964\n\nWorked a little on slides. Did some odds and ends to get ready for trip to Wichita tomorrow. Heard dreadful news. “Red” Hall worked with his combine outfit in Kansas Monday. Went to doctor Tuesday and found he has a hopeless case of cancer. He is such an engaged, hard-working person, but has been losing flesh.\n\nJune 20, 1964\n\nDrove to Wichita to meeting of Conference Committee on Xn Social Action – fine meeting – we really got down to business. Hot day – high wind. I got home tired. Found four bins of our elevator burst from defective structure or spontaneous combustion. It happened at 11 or 11:30 last night. Fortunately nobody there.\n\nJune 21, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class and attended church. In the afternoon worked on minutes of meeting yesterday. (I drew the job of secy.) All the talk is of the damaged elevator – 80,000 bushels of wheat spilled – so thankful nobody was under it. Hot day – and so dry!\n\nJune 22, 1964\n\nStarted worked on a MS by two men (Ruby & Brown) from Washington state [sic]. Worked hard but am enjoying it. This evening some broken clouds came over and there was a very hard wind. Lightning in the distance. Anyhow it is getting cooler.\n\nJune 23, 1964\n\nJune 25. I turned two pages and wrote June 23 on June 25 page. Cool dewey [sic] morning – lovely bright day. I used the air conditioner towards the end of the afternoon. I worked on the MS.\n\nJune 24, 1964\n\nLovely bright day – cool in morning, not very hot in P.M. Early this morning I took pictures of the damaged elevator and the spilled wheat which a Texas crew is salvaging. It will cost 25¢ a bu. In afternoon went to Enid to see Mrs. Hawkins. She is improving all the time. I worked on the MS. in the forenoon.\n\nJune 25, 1964\n\nWoke up this morning and found the ground muddy. It rained 1½ in., the most this year. We are very happy. Lovely cool day – good day to work on the MS. In the afternoon Leota Windler, Olga Schaefer, and I went through all the church library See June 23 page.\n\nJune 26, 1964\n\nAnother lovely morning and nice day. I went to Guthrie with Leota Windler to call on the Shrages. Mr. S’s mind has failed until he is as dependent on his wife as a baby. I worked all forenoon on the MS. I am enjoying the hard work.\n\nJune 27, 1964\n\nWorked hard all morning on MS. In the P.M. got my hair washed and set, studied my S.S. lesson, and other odds and ends.\n\nJune 28, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class and heard a fine sermon by Dr. Norman Jacobs of Phillips who is filling the pulpit when Rev. John is away. In the afternoon Allie and Lula came by. On way from Calif. to daughter Lois in Penna. Ralph was with them, also Allie’s Lula’s sister, Mabel, from Hennessey.\n\nJune 29, 1964\n\nSomehow felt sluggish all day and didn’t accomplish much on the MS.\n\nJune 30, 1964\n\nOne of the best days I have had for a long time. Felt wonderful all day. Worked on MS – then cleaned north half of house. It was cloudy all day, sprinkled a little once, showers collecting all around this evening.\n\nJuly 1, 1964\n\nIt rained last night but not much water fell – better than nothing. Worked on MS in morning. Went to Guild in P.M. at Winnie Schaefer’s. Eva Dean Huffer had fine lesson. Called on Mrs. Stuerke this evening.\n\nJuly 2, 1964\n\nWorked on MS in morning. In P.M. went to Enid to report to Dr. Duffy. He lightened the hormone and calcium dosage. Stopped and saw Mrs. Hawkins. She didn’t complain at all. She has been a very cheerful uncomplaining person till she got off on the wrong foot recently.\n\nJuly 3, 1964\n\nWorked on MS this morning. Went out to Elsie Schaefer’s in the P.M. and she gave me a permanent. Hot weather these days, but still lovely in the mornings.\n\nJuly 4, 1964\n\nWorked all day on the MS. It was good to hear the church bells ring at noon. A new custom and I like it.\n\nJuly 5, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S class and heard another fine sermon by Dr. Jacobs.\n\nJuly 6, 1964\n\nI made no entry for the week of July 6-11. The weather was terribly hot. It is usually bad in July but this week was worse than\n\nJuly 7, 1964\n\nusual. It is terribly dry. I water things but the sun and wind scorch the leaves of even hardy shrubs like the lilacs and\n\nJuly 8, 1964\n\neven some of the smaller branches die. I worked all week on the MS and because of my air conditioner I was very\n\nJuly 9, 1964\n\ncomfortable. The grass is dying on the lawn. Most of the trees are all right because it takes more than one dry season\n\nJuly 10, 1964\n\nto take all the moisture out of the subsoil.\n\nJuly 11, 1964\n\nI taught my S.S. class and heard a good sermon by Dr. Hatt.\n\nJuly 12, 1964\n\nIt was cloudy this morning and during church there was a quick hard shower. If only it had kept on. Cooler all day. I am getting a little annoyed at our pastor. He doesn’t preach well but he can’t help that. Only he doesn’t try. Today his sermon was 10 min. long. Then he dismissed us. He simply hadn’t prepared.\n\nJuly 13, 1964\n\nReally cold last night, lovely cool day. But there apparently is no prospect for more rain. In the afternoon I went to Leota Windler’s and we worked out the Guild lessons for next year.\n\nJuly 14, 1964\n\nStill fairly cool.\n\nJuly 15, 1964\n\nHot weather from here on. I have been listening it to the Republican convention this week. I am not a Republican but I am very unhappy\n\nJuly 16, 1964\n\nabout it. Surely that sort of reaction can not capture the electorate. But there is always the danger. And besides we need\n\nJuly 17, 1964\n\ntwo two parties with intelligence. I heard the inane speech of Eisenhower. Reminds me of a remark attributed to Lincoln – the\n\nJuly 18, 1964\n\nmost words compressed into the fewest thoughts I ever heard. Nixon made a “harmony” speech that was brilliant. He is intelligent. But it was completely\n\nJuly 19, 1964\n\ninsincere insincere. The acceptance speeches of Miller and Goldwater were idiotic.\n\nJuly 20, 1964\n\nAnother very hot week. The temperature at Kingfisher, says the Oklahoman, went up to 111ᵒ some days probably even more\n\nJuly 21, 1964\n\nhere. And not a drop of moisture. I water things every day, but no matter how much I wet the ground the leaves burn\n\nJuly 22, 1964\n\nand the branches die. I may lose my favorite rose. All the leaves are dead and some of the branches. I have worked all the time on the\n\nJuly 23, 1964\n\nMoses manuscript. I can do it fairly well on account of the air conditioner.\n\nJuly 24, 1964\n\nJuly 25 Learned that Leota Windler’s father died Thursday. Will have the funeral Sunday in our church at 4:30. The Women are serving the noon meal to the family and visiting relatives.\n\nJuly 25, 1964\n\nJuly 25th entry is on July 24 page.\n\nJuly 26, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class and attended church. I am getting annoyed at the minister His entire sermon was a boresome narrative of a movie he had seen. People used to do that back in 1908 when the “nickelodeon” was a novelty. I went to the church at 4:30 only to find I had been misinformed. The funeral was at 2:30.\n\nJuly 27, 1964\n\nThis morning at about 4 I heard it thunder and a few drops of rain fell. It was lovely and cool in the morning but as hot as ever during the rest of the day.\n\nJuly 28, 1964\n\nI had a bad night – too windy and too hot – and rested today instead of working.\n\nJuly 29, 1964\n\n[No entry]\n\nJuly 30, 1964\n\nAnother terrible hot week. I worked on the MS all week. No relief from the heat and drought.\n\nJuly 31, 1964\n\n[No entry]\n\nAugust 1, 1964\n\nBurton called me this evening. It was so good to hear his voice.\n\nAugust 2, 1964\n\nI had a very small S.S. class. Rev John preached a well prepared sermon. Perhaps he had some reason for his lack of preparation the past few weeks. In the P.M. Pat O’Neill took me to the planetarium and then to dinner at a cafeteria. I enjoyed it very much. Ramona was not feeling well and she insisted on our going.\n\nAugust 3, 1964\n\nThe worst day we have had. Alice Moffitt, Dr. Rebekah Pate, and Idress Cash came in the evening and I showed them picks of Russia. I couldn’t get the temperature in the house down below 90ᵒ all evening.\n\nAugust 4, 1964\n\nA day like yesterday. This is the worst weather we have ever had except the terrible summer of ’36 – and it may get as bad as that before August is over. The thermometer goes up to 110ᵒ or 112ᵒ and is not even cool in the evening.\n\nAugust 5, 1964\n\nAttended Guild at Mabel Bryson’s. Fine lesson by Alma Friend. Terribly hot day. I am writing by the air conditioner at 7:00 P.M. and when I step outside it is like the breath of a furnace.\n\nAugust 6, 1964\n\nTerrible weather. Every day the thermometer goes up to 110ᵒ or more. It stands at 100ᵒ at eight in the evening. None of our usual cool evenings and nights. There are often clouds in the distance but no rain\n\nAugust 7, 1964\n\nRain! About two o’clock hard rain 1.53 in. with much wind. Lovely cool day. It makes one feel th in harmony with nature – not an enemy.\n\nAugust 8, 1964\n\nLovely cool morning – not too hot day – lovely cool evening. The kind of weather one enjoys. There are robins all over the lawn. I don’t know where they came from. Ants digging. Cicadas singing.\n\nAugust 9, 1964\n\nLovely cool morning. I taught my S.S. class – There was no preaching, Rev. John was directing a youth camp. Nice day. In the evening the young Bostick family (bless them) invited all us old women in the block for cake and ice cream on their lawn. Nice.\n\nAugust 10, 1964\n\nA pleasant gentle rain came last night but I think not much water fell. It was cool this morning – got hot during the day, but within reason.\n\nAugust 11, 1964\n\nCloudy part of the day and not so hot. Cooler this evening. I have a sore on my hand that doesn’t heal so went to see Dr. Duffy. He took a piece for a pathologist. He Xrayed my back and it is really filling in with bony structure. Good news. I went to see Mrs. Hawkins. Thought she looked not so well as usual.\n\nAugust 12, 1964\n\nIt was cloudy and actually cold today – so cold I closed the windows and put on more clothes. It was wonderful to work. I feel scarcely tired at all tonight\n\nAugust 13, 1964\n\nCloudy and cold all morning. (At noon with all the doors and windows closed the thermometer in my dining room said 69ᵒ) It warmed up a little in the afternoon.\n\nAugust 14, 1964\n\nCold and cloudy again. There was a hard shower in the afternoon, and is raining hard this evening. I caught water in my cistern – the first time for a year.. I didn’t catch the May 10 rain because of new tarred roof on my porch. Learned the sore on my hand is a skin cancer. Will have it treated Monday.\n\nAugust 15, 1964\n\nLovely day. So cold I closed the kitchen and kept the oven going all morning so my bread would rise. Warmer in the afternoon.\n\nAugust 16, 1964\n\nWent to S.S. (taught my class). Rev. John really preached a good sermon. I learned the church council met last night and asked him to resign. He and his wife are a pitiable couple – do not seem to understand how to work at their jobs. In the afternoon went to Wichita with Harold & Lavonne Phelan and Bob Schaefer to a “seminar” on the S.S. courses.\n\nAugust 17, 1964\n\nI went to Enid to see doctor, but he thought my hand was O.K. Red Hall died yesterday. So shocking. He was such a virile person. Less than two months ago he was combining wheat. He never lost his humor and his high spirits during his illness. His family was equally brave.\n\nAugust 18, 1964\n\nHard rain last night. So lovely this evening – bright sun, clean cool air, leaves coming out on shrubs like in spring. I went to Red Hall’s funeral today. His brave family!\n\nAugust 19, 1964\n\nAnother nice day. I worked as usual on the MS. It turned out to be a bigger job than I realized when I undertook it.\n\nAugust 20, 1964\n\nCool cloudy day. I finished the MS. Somehow I felt rather sad when I put it in the box. I became so well acquainted with the people and the places it was like saying good-by to friends and familiar scenes. My resurrection lilies are blooming – result of the rain.\n\nAugust 21, 1964\n\nCool all day, actually cold in the morning.

Natl. convention\n\nAugust 26, 1964\n\nWe had two hard showers today. Lovely weather. I listened to the Dem. Natl. Conv. on radio. So glad President chose Hubert Humphrey as his running mate.\n\nAugust 27, 1964\n\nI went to the Pat O’Neill’s to watch on TV this evening. Saw young Bobby Kennedy’s ordeal as he tried to make a speech preliminary to a film of his brother’s life and the crowd gave him an ovation. The film was very moving. Ramona cried outright. Heard Humphrey’s acceptance speech – also Johnson’s. Adlai Stevenson gave a tribute to Eleanor Roosevelt. Best speech of the convention. Nobody but John Kennedy has ever approached him in thought and word. After I got home a rain with wind. The Krouses came to see me this forenoon.\n\nAugust 28, 1964Lovely cool morning with sunshine and clean air. Nice all day. Word has come to us that Grif Thompson died.

He and Marceil are lovable people and they need help which we have failed to give them.\n\nSeptember 7, 1964\n\nNothing much happened; I visited the Brysons in the evening. The sky is red these days at sunset and sunrise just as it was a year ago.\n\nSeptember 8, 1964\n\nOur Marshall Woman’s Club had its luncheon and first meeting.

Of course I am tired but so thankful I got to go Joe drove his car.\n\nSeptember 26, 1964\n\nMrs. Stuerke wanted to attend a luncheon at Penn Square for the people who have signed up for the apartments for elderly people which will be completed next summer.

The dr. told me to come back in a week if the trouble does not clear up. Warm day.\n\nOctober 23, 1964\n\nLearned that lively vital Mrs. Beeby died Wednesday. She has been a part of this community since her father took a claim in the Cherokee Strip. The sulpha drug the doctor gave me worked wonders. Slept all night – no fever – soreness leaving.

They have just returned from a tour in their camper over England and the Continent. Roberta and I moved furniture back, hung pictures, etc. – all done but cleaning kitchen. It seems almost strange to be living in a real house once more Harold Edwards installed a new phone with extension cord.\n\nNovember 10, 1964\n\nRoberta cleaned the kitchen and tidied up some odds and ends that had been left. All done. And all shining clean! We have been very fortunate that the weather has been warm all the time.\n\nNovember 11, 1964\n\nI started in working on the program for the tour Saturday.

I gave my School of Missions lesson to a very small group while it was pouring outside. My last lesson.\n\nNovember 15, 1964\n\nNov. 16 It rained last night and most of the day. Not quite so warm as usual. A young student from OSU came to see me. His name is Melvin Fiegal and he is writing a history of Kingfisher for his master’s thesis in history. Nice boy.\n\nNovember 16, 1964\n\n[No entry]\n\nNovember 17, 1964\n\nIt has never quit raining. Not really cold though snow has fallen in some parts of the U.S. northwest of us.

Very fine.\n\nNovember 19, 1964\n\nCleared off beautifully but getting cold.\n\nNovember 20, 1964\n\nWhite frost this morning – first one we have had. Pretty cold. I went to Enid to see Mrs. Hawkins. Her condition is pitiable – unable even to turn over and covered with bed sores. While I was there I got my Christmas letterheads.\n\nNovember 21, 1964\n\nI wrote several letters. Did a little cleaning of my house. A little dust had accumulated but it is still beautifully clean from the good going over it had by Roberta. Coldish day. Got a permanent.\n\nNovember 22, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class and attended church. Sermon better than usual. In the afternoon the Bosticks (Vernon, Roberta, Teresa, and Philip) came over and we played records of Kennedy’s speeches. We felt that was a proper observance of the day. They stayed all afternoon and we discussed politics in the very best sense of the word. Coldish day. In the evening I showed Plymouth pics at the church to the youth group – also in the morning to my S.S. class.\n\nNovember 23, 1964\n\nThe Moses manuscript came from the two authors in Washington. Now I must go over it for final check. Those men have taken a wonderful attitude toward the suggestions I made. I wrote my Christmas letter and sent it to the printer. Nice day.\n\nNovember 24, 1964\n\nWorked in forenoon on Moses MS. The authors have done a brilliant job of rewriting. In P.M. attended Club at Winnie Branens.

It started clouding up this afternoon perhaps getting ready to storm. Glendora Hammer called briefly.\n\nNovember 28, 1964\n\nLovely day. It didn’t storm. I worked on the MS. It is going to be a fine book. The authors did a fine job of revision after my work on it last summer.\n\nNovember 29, 1964\n\nLovely morning. but the wind turned to the north about noon. I taught my S.S. class (August & Catherene there) but didn’t attend church. Had to hurry to eat and take Ruth Cromer to graveside service at the South Cemetery at one, for the burial of Mrs. Phil Reynolds. It was an ‘89er family and the children and I were in school together with Ruth as teacher. Few people remember them any more.\n\nNovember 30, 1964\n\nCold bright day. August and Catherene Burchardt called briefly. I was so happy to see them. Attended S.S. teachers’ meeting at the church. Worked on the manuscript.\n\nDecember 1, 1964\n\nInternational hospitality met with me this morning. We made plans for foreign students for Christmas week.

Enjoyable luncheon, fine program.\n\nDecember 3, 1964\n\nFreezing rain or freezing mist all day with a few flakes of snow. Dangerous to drive but more dangerous to walk so I drove. Not especially cold. I worked all day on the MS.\n\nDecember 4, 1964\n\nThis morning the ice had evaporated from the pavement – no moisture to freeze on windshield – so driving to town was a relief. It cleared off in the afternoon. I worked all day on the MS. My Xmas letters came from the printer, but no time to send them out.\n\nDecember 5, 1964\n\nNice bright day but crisp. I kept the library in the forenoon. The rest of the time I worked on the MS.\n\nDecember 6, 1964\n\nI taught my S.S. class and attended the preaching service. (Very good sermon.)

But it is going to be good. Wind changed to north about 4 – probably cold weather is on the way.\n\nDecember 13, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class, and attended church. The weather didn’t turn cold after all. Wrote letters in the afternoon, but haven’t started sending my Xmas letters.\n\nDecember 14, 1964\n\nWeather still nice. Worked on the MS.

Worked on MS. In evening went to O’Neills’ to see “The Week That Was” on TV – then talked and listened to Xmas music.\n\nDecember 16, 1964\n\nFinished the MS except for some odds and ends that will wait until the authors can give some information. My S.S. class brought me a beautiful poinsetta [sic]. Nice day but turning cold this evening.\n\nDecember 17, 1964\n\nHigh wind blowing and very cold. I sent out letters. Cleaned half of my house. I shall not get a tree this year. I want the poinsetta [sic] to have the place the tree usually gets.\n\nDecember 18, 1964\n\nStill and bright and apparently not very cold but my car said it was, and I found thermometer got down to 3ᵒ. I sent out Christmas letters – worked some on odds and ends needing to be done on the MS.\n\nDecember 19, 1964\n\nFreezing rain fell in the night and the ground was covered with a glare of ice.

Ginger and I stepped across the street to a Christmas service at our church. Small congregation. Got beautiful plant from Dr. Ruby and Mr. Brown.\n\nDecember 21, 1964\n\nI am trying to send out Xmas letters but things keep coming up to add to the MS. The authors and I are keeping the mails hot. Cloudy this morning but cleared off.\n\nDecember 22, 1964\n\nStill dividing my time between the MS and Christmas letters. We are having lovely weather. I am enjoying my Xmas mail though it is piling up unanswered.\n\nDecember 23, 1964\n\nMore of the same. So warm I turned off the furnace through the middle of the day.\n\nDecember 24, 1964\n\nStill letters & MS alternating. In the evening I attended the Xmas program at the church. Very fine. Lovely warm weather. Stanley Hitt brought some sweet rolls – Roberta and the children a cake. How nice.\n\nDecember 25, 1964\n\nAttended church (communion service) at 10:30. Ate dinner (not a Xmas dinner) with the O’Neills. Very pleasant. Worked on MS and finished answering my Xmas letters – haven’t initiated any yet on my own. Nice weather.\n\nDecember 26, 1964\n\nMore work of same kind. Nice day.\n\nDecember 27, 1964\n\nTaught my S.S. class. Heard our pastor’s last sermon. I am worried about what is to become of that family. Ate dinner in the church basement with the Schaefer family – Leona and husband here. In evening Alden Grassman came and told me all about their problem with getting rid of minister & finding another. The church council has worked so conscientiously on this.\n\nDecember 28, 1964\n\nSame kind of work. Questions to authors, answers, changes on MS. It is going to be a very fine book.\n\nDecember 29, 1964\n\nThe Schaefer sisters and Leona Schneebeck here this P.M. and I showed New England and other slides. Warm day.\n\nDecember 30, 1964\n\nI worked on one problem that has been bothering me on the MS – got some docs. I needed. I have only one left now, and that must wait till I get an answer to a letter I sent today. Nice warm day.\n\nDecember 31, 1964\n\nCloudy all day, rain off and on, very foggy tonight. Still warm Received a calendar of lovely English scenes from the Millers."
