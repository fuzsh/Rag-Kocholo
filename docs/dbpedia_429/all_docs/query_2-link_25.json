        "text": "I agree with Lulu that Christine Brennan's second book, Edge of Glory, is far better that her first, Inside Edge. I have a theory about these books (just an impression that popped into my mind when I read them). It seemed to me that Ms. Brennan started out in Inside Edge to write an \"expose\" of the sport focusing on such shockers as, all these pretty little girls aren't so nice after all, and some of the men are gay (!!!) But while she was doing the research, she fell in love with the sport, and especially with Michelle Kwan and her family, and so she wrote Edge of Glory as a sort of chronical of Michelle's rise to glory, culminating in her gold medal victory at Nagano.\n\nOops. I don't think Brennan ever forgave Michelle for messing up the grand climax of her book.\n\nI didn't care much for Frozen Assets at all. Another book that promised some sort of inside scoop, but said nothing except what is general knowledge (Michelle gets lots of money off endorsement contracts.) To tell the truth, Mark Lund is not among my favorites. He seems quite full of himself, in my opinion (please, mark, get a different picture for the editor's page of International Figure Skating -- one that doesn't make you look quite so much like a bad George Clooney imitation). I get a big kick out of the fact that he always votes himself onto his list of the 25 most influetial people in figure skating, LOL.\n\nA book that I did thoroughly enjoy was Culture on Ice, by Ellyn Kestnbaum. (Dr. Kestnbaum posted a time or two on the old GS.) Don't be put off by the neo-feminist jargon on the back cover or the introduction. Actually the book (an expansion of Kestnbaum's doctoral thesis in theater) comprises a analysis critical of the traditional feminist view of the sport as presenting submissive women as sex objects to be gazed upon by audiences of powerful men (for starters, most figure skating fans are women). Fascinating book.\n\nMathman\n\nThank you for the welcome Mathman! Yes, I am indeed a writer - of the freelance variety. I wrote articles on FS competitions for my local paper as well as an online magazine (now folded) before my daughter arrived. I have been so busy with my toddler, that I haven't had an article published in some time.\n\n'Frozen Assets\" did irritate me with the quotes. I kept asking myself, \"Is this a book or a magazine article?\". And you were right about the very LONG quotes. Worse, you might begin reading a paragraph with Scott Hamilton's views and then hit a LONG quote assuming they are still Scott's views, only to find that they came from Paul Wylie. I do think it was full of very interesting quotes, facts, and opinions. The format, however, left me cold. But again - nothing new!"
