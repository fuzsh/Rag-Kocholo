He gave me a tape recording from which I heard this lecture with great pleasure.\n\nIt is Dr. Rotta's proposal that he would like to print an abridged version of this lecture, which comprises the material of general Interest to scientists of all kinds.\n\nMy question now is, whether you would be willing to give this lecture for publication to ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE. Perhaps the text could be detailed in several places and could be shortened at others. I do not know whether you have a manuscript available, which could serve as a basis for this publication. If this is not the case, we would type the text from the recording tape, and send it to you for editing.\n\nPlease let me know whether any of these proposals will he agreeable, and in particular, whether you would be willing and have the time to prepare a manuscript, which is suitable for publication in ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nANGEWANDTE CHEMIE\n\nEditorial Office\n\nLetter from Arthur Herzog to LP RE: Tells LP that the book entitled The War-Peace Establishment will be published in January.

[Filed under LP Biographical: Personal and Family: Box #5.044, Folder #44.6]\n\n3500 E. Fairpoint St.\n\nPasadena, California\n\nJuly 16, 1964\n\nDr. Peter Pauling\n\n95 Lansdowne Road\n\nLondon W.11, England\n\nDear Peter:\n\nWe hope you are well. How is your brother, Peter? We hope you are coming here soon. We like your letter which we see that you send here and have listened to your children and I hope your sister is well, too, and if your little brother is well, tell him if he can speak to me, too, some time and if you have time sometimes, come over to America and visit us. We are very happy to live in our new home and we hope that we can have everything moved in pretty soon to stay. We'll be a nice family and we hope that you have a nice family, too, and we hope that you are having a nice good family in London with your children and your other people that you have, and give good wishes to your mother and daddy.\n\nLove,\n\nBarkly Kamb\n\nDear Peter:\n\nThe first part of this letter is from Barkly. I am sorry that you cannot hear him talk over the dictaphone. He is pretty excited about it and so the record is full of big breaths. As you can see from the foregoing, I am having difficulty getting my work done. We are beginning our packing and intend to go on Friday with the first load to Santa Barbara. I am not sure that the house is completely ready there but we must go up and see to the final steps. Also, Papa must go to the Center to make arrangements for his office so that he can move his things from CIT.\n\nIt was probably a mistake to let the children move in here before we had moved out but, since we were to be away and since the swimming pool was here, it seemed rather foolish for them to stay over there. Also, it was helpful to us, because I would have had to get someone to stay here with Hiromi. I had a woman helping me, who was on the borderline of having to go to the mental hospital and she was a good person but rather erratic and began behaving in such a way that I thought it was best not to leave her here when we were gone. It is difficult for some people to be here because they think that the house is large and they feel rather frightened and alone.\n\nWe had a good time in London and we liked seeing you and your family again. It is a great pleasure to see the children growing so well and developing in such a good way. I am glad that I bought the sweaters for them and I am surely happy that they liked them so much. You know that they are hand-knit and are rather expensive, perhaps too expensive for children and I shall send you some Orion sweaters which will be easier to take care of. Perhaps these beautiful sweaters should be dry-cleaned for the first few times rather than hand wash them unless Julie understands very well about how to wash wool*.\n\n*And enjoys washing it which I don't!\n\nCrellin is going to be in Stanford this Fall and will be there for a couple of years and we are going to lend him our cattle truck to move his things from Seattle to Stanford. I do not know whether he is going to sell his house or not, but I presume he will.\n\nGus Miller, if you remember him, came the other day with a wife and two children and he is still the same Gus and still talking about taking some time off to get his Doctor's degree in mathematics. He had told us several years ago that he had completed his work for his Doctor's degree, but I guess this was an error.\n\nWe send you much love.\n\nMama\n\nLetter from Flora Gould, National Secretary of the New Zealand Peace Council, to LP RE: Asks if LP would consider visiting New Zealand along with his visit to the Australian Congress in October.
