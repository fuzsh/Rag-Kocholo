        "text": "Admit it. You’ve thought about it more than once and probably said it to a few people.\n\nYou’re worried it will be another 1964 season for the Phillies.\n\nThe club’s recent slump has ignited a sense of anxiety, and fear among its fan base. Is it just a coincidence that this is the 60th anniversary of the collapse?\n\nCould it or will it happen? With all of the emphasis on gambling in the game, let me say that the odds are against it happening.\n\nYet, it’s still in our heads with 51 games left after Sunday.\n\nIn this week’s version of my Behind the Plate column — investigating trends among the Phillies, Mets, and Yankees as well as the overall game — I’ll take a look at the Phillies current slippery state and their past digressions.\n\nPhillies Phlight ... For most of the season, the Phillies have had the best record in baseball. They also weren’t really threatened by the arch-rival Braves, who have been ravaged by injuries and inconsistent play.\n\nAt the end of May, the Phillies had a 40-18 record and 6.5 game lead. On June 11, the Phils were a season-high 26-games over .500 after a 4-1 victory over Boston that upped their record to 46-20. In turn, they had a season-high 10-game lead.\n\nSince then, the Phils have had a 20-25 record. They have currently dropped 11 of their last 16 games. In that mix was a three-game sweep by the Yankees.\n\nTheir once 10-game lead has slipped to six.\n\nAs for the Braves, keep an eye on them.\n\nThrown A Curve ... For most of this season, the Phillies’ pitching staff was dominant in nearly every category, including quality starts (49) and ERA (3.07). Since July 1, their ERA rank is 27th (3.37) and they only had nine quality starts in their first 25 games since then.\n\nRanger Suarez began the season with a 9-0 record and a 1.36 ERA and 68 strikeouts, but now has a 10-5 record and a 2.87 ERA. He has battled through injuries, and his three July starts brought a 6.61 ERA.\n\nBoth Taijuan Walker and Spencer Turnbull have been shelved. Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler appear to have lost something off their fastballs. Christopher Sanchez has struggled in his last five starts.\n\nIn the bullpen, Matt Strohm and Jose Alvarado have struggled, but newly-acquired Tanner Banks and Carlos Estevez have looked good in their first showings. Estevez did allow the winning run Saturday night.\n\nSlumming ... Bryce Harper broke out of his slump with three hits, including a homer, in Sunday’s win.\n\nHowever, since July 14, Harper is hitting just .188 with four homers with eight RBIs.\n\nHis teammates during the same period have the following numbers: Trea Turner, .179, 18 strikeouts; Nick Castellanos, .230; Kyle Schwarber, .237, 4 HR; Brandon Marsh, .187; Bryson Stott, .250; and J.T. Realmuto, .177.\n\nAlec Bohm is the only regular who has a consistent bat at .311.\n\nSince he arrived from Baltimore, Austin Hays is hitting .206 with a homer and four RBIs.\n\nDespite their struggles, the team is hitting .255, the fifth-best average in the league. However, this is a reflection of how teams are struggling with their hitting overall.\n\nHotseat ... Is Phils’ manager Rob Thomson in trouble? The rumors of Thomson losing the clubhouse surfaced a few weeks ago. Thomson came under fire after the team lost the NLCS to Arizona after they had a 2-0 lead. There has been a slow running undercurrent since that has gained some momentum.\n\nIf you remember, Thomson replaced longtime colleague Joe Giradi, who was let go after the team’s 22-29 start in 2022. Thomson finished the 2002 season with a 65-46 record, and guided the team to the World Series. He entered this season with an overall 155-118 mark. If there is a collapse, Thomson likely will be gone. Phillies’ management was active during the trading deadline, and they are anxious for the first World Series title in 16 years.\n\nPat Corrales was fired at the All-Star break with a 43-42 record in 1983 with a team that had World Series expectations. At the time, Joe Morgan was hitting .198, and Mike Schmidt, Gary Matthews, and Bo Diaz were all slumping under .250.\n\nPaul Owens took over for his second tenure as manager and the team responded with a 47-30 season record and a trip to the World Series.\n\nCub Flub ... It was 55 years ago in 1969 that the Cubs were ready to clinch the National League as they had an 84-58 record on Sept. 9 and a half-game lead over the Mets.\n\nBut the Cubbies went into a tailspin and lost 12 of their next 20 games and finished second, eight games behind.\n\nThis was a team with Ernie Banks at first (23, 106, 253); Glenn Beckert, second (.291); Don Kessinger, shortstop (.273); Ron Santo, third (29, 123, .289); Randy Hundley, catcher (18, 64, .255); and Billy Williams, left field (21. 93, .293). Paul Popovich was a valuable pinch-hitter and infielder (.312).\n\nFerguson Jenkins (21-15, 3.27, seven shutouts, 273 strikeouts, 23 complete games), Bill Hand (20-14, .2.49, 18 complete games), and Ken Holtzman (17-13, 3.58, six shutouts, 12 complete games) were an underrated starting trio. Who was their fourth starter? Future Phillie reliever Dick Selma, who went 10-8 with a 3.63 ERA.\n\nThe Cubs had winning records in 1967 and ‘68 as well as in ‘70, ‘71, and ‘72. Unfortunately, the Cubs never regained that status during the rest of the ‘70s. They were back on top in ‘84 with a 96-65 record and an NL East title.\n\nThinking Ahead ... Over the final 50 games, here are some thoughts ..Can the Mets keep their pace to the postseason? Can the Yankees win the AL East? Will Aaron Judge win the Triple Crown? Is Texas or Houston ready to capture the AL West? And do the Dodgers get to the World Series (More on those thoughts next week).\n\nFinal Thought ... Colleague Rich Strack recently wrote a beautiful compelling and telling tribute column about retiring sports editor Emmett McCall in Saturday’s paper.\n\nI easily could have “filled a notebook” – as we say — about Emmett. He has been a colleague and friend for over 40 years, and has been a true credit to the profession. Emmett is one of the most genuine and sincere persons I have known, and I feel very fortunate to have him cross my path.\n\nAll the best, Emmett, and enjoy your next step. I know I can speak on behalf of the Times News readers when I say you have made this local sports’ section one of the better ones in the state.\n\nThanks, pal.\n\nFeedback ...
