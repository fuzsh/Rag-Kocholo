Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (born May 7, 1927, Cologne, Germany—died April 3, 2013, New York, New York, U.S.) was a novelist and screenwriter, well known for her witty and insightful portrayals of contemporary Indian lives and, especially, for her 46 years as a pivotal member of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory’s filmmaking team.

Jhabvala’s family was Jewish, and in 1939 they emigrated from Germany to England; she was made a naturalized British citizen in 1948. After receiving an M.A. in English (1951) from Queen Mary College, London, she married an Indian architect and moved to India, where she lived for the next 24 years. After 1975 she lived in New York City, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1986.

Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia

Jhabvala’s first two novels, To Whom She Will (1955; also published as Amrita) and The Nature of Passion (1956), won much critical acclaim for their comic depiction of Indian society and manners. She was often compared to Jane Austen for her microscopic studies of a tightly conventional world. Her position as both insider and detached observer allowed her a unique, sometimes satirical perspective when describing Indian family life, India’s struggle to adapt to a new social mobility, and the clash between Eastern and Western ideals. Her novel Heat and Dust (1975) won the Booker Prize and was made into a film in 1982. It tells parallel stories of colonial and contemporary India. Her first departure from Indian subject matter occurred in In Search of Love and Beauty (1983), which portrays Austrian and German refugees searching for spiritual truths in New York. Poet and Dancer (1993) is the story of a destructive friendship between two women living in New York City.
