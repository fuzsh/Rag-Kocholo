        "text": "In 1983, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s Booker-prize winning novel Heat and Dust was released in theatres for its first run, and in 1984, BAFTA rewarded her with a Best Adapted Screenplay award. But even many film buffs will not recognize her name. Ruth Prawer Who???\n\nAlthough she was the genius who wrote most of screenplays for their their award winning films, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s name has been submerged under the moniker “Merchant Ivory Productions.” This must stop!\n\nI surely do not mean to deny the importance of either James Ivory as a director or Ismail Merchant as a producer. They were a splendid pair (both personally and professionally) and the proof is onscreen for all to see, but they did not do it alone. They were, in fact, a trio–James Ivory, Ismail Merchant. and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala–and in a just world, I wouldn’t have to keep saying this again and again.\n\nJan Lisa Huttner (9/7/17) FF2 Media\n\nFrom Alec Pike at IndieWire:\n\nMerchant Ivory Films’ Sumptuous Re-Release Gets A Star-Filled New Trailer\n\nPhoto Credits:\n\nFeatured Image: Olivia Rivers (Greta Scacchi) prefers dreams to realities as the bride of a colonial officer (played by Christopher Cazenove) in British India.\n\nTop Photo: Decades later, Olivia’s great-niece Anne (Julie Christie) tries to solve the mystery of Olivia’s fate.\n\nBottom Photo: Olivia’s friend Harry Hamilton-Paul (Nicholas Grace) is the intermediary between two worlds."
