        "text": "Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the German-born screenwriter and novelist who, as the writing member of the Merchant Ivory filmmaking team, won two Academy Awards for adaptations of genteel, class-conscious E. M. Forster novels, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.\n\nJames Ivory, the director with whom she collaborated, said the cause was complications of a pulmonary condition.\n\nMrs. Jhabvala (pronounced JOB-vahla) was already well established as an author when she began her screenwriting career with the producer Ismail Merchant and Mr. Ivory. Her 1975 novel, “Heat and Dust,” about an Englishwoman exploring a family scandal in India, received the Booker Prize, Britain’s highest literary honor. She wrote the screenplay for the Merchant Ivory version in 1983 as well.\n\nOver four decades, beginning in 1963, Mrs. Jhabvala made 22 films with Mr. Merchant and Mr. Ivory, all examining culture in one way or another, often one that has vanished. Their first film to attract wide attention was “The Europeans” (1979), based on a Henry James novel set in mid-19th-century New England. Their successful “Room With a View” (1986), based on Forster’s novel about a sheltered young Englishwoman who has a life-changing experience on holiday in Italy, brought Mrs. Jhabvala the Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nHistory repeated itself when she won the same award for Merchant Ivory’s “Howards End” (1992), from a Forster book in which shifting Edwardian social classes cross paths with sometimes cruel results. The team’s collaborations — lush and literate, often adapted from classic novels — became something of a brand. Visually, a Merchant Ivory film promised “period-perfect costumes and settings” (as The Los Angeles Times wrote); “rich production values and an exquisite attention to detail” (The Minneapolis Star Tribune); or simply “taste” (The Chicago Tribune).\n\nThe casts were top-shelf and largely British, laden with stars like Maggie Smith, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Daniel Day-Lewis, Helena Bonham Carter and Vanessa Redgrave. For “Mr. & Mrs. Bridge” (1990), based on the Evan S. Connell novels, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, spouses in real life, were recruited for the title roles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
