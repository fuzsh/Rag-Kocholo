        "text": "Bio:\n\nCylin Busby is a former book editor and a best-selling, award-winning author of books for young readers. Her first screenplay, REBECCA AND QUINN GET SCARED, written with Nanci Katz, was a comedy finalist at the Austin Film Festival in 2017.\n\nHow did you break in?\n\nI’ve been a published author for more than 15 years, and after several of my books were optioned, I decided to try my hand at writing a screenplay. I teamed up with my friend, Nanci Katz, and we began writing REBECCA AND QUINN GET SCARED. We’re now working on our third screenplay together.\n\nCredits:\n\nScreenwriter / Author\n\nWhat are the biggest lessons you’ve learned?\n\nWhen I was a book editor at HarperCollins, one of the publishers I worked with told me: “There are no great writers, only great revisers,” and that really stuck with me. All of writing is revision, so now that’s where I live and breathe as a writer.\n\nWhat has been your hardest scene to write?\n\nStraddling both horror and comedy in our screenplay, REBECCA AND QUINN GET SCARED, was a challenge. It wasn’t easy to make a story funny as well as scary—without any campy, slapstick humor. When we semifinaled in both horror and comedy at AFF 2017, that was a huge accomplishment because I knew we had done both genres well.\n\nWhat do you feel was your turning point?\n\nSitting in on a few of the panels at AFF, I heard folks saying how Austin had “changed their lives.” At the time, I took it in with a bit of skepticism. But, when we got back to L.A., it turned out to be true. People wanted to read our script because we had finaled at Austin Film Festival—and that’s how we got a director attached, which led to representation. So yeah, AFF changed my life!\n\nWhat are you working on right now?\n\nAll of our screenplays center on female characters and women’s stories. Right now, we are writing a female-revenge story called SELF DEFENSE with a big, juicy part for an older actress.\n\nWhat are your favorite movies?\n\nAbsolute favorite is ALL ABOUT EVE, though I wish Mary Orr was given more credit for the story. I love revisiting classics like Hitchcock’s REBECCA, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, CASABLANCA, GASLIGHT. More recent favorites: THELMA & LOUISE, ALIEN, and VALLEY GIRL.\n\nWho are your favorite screenwriters?\n\nRuth Prawer Jhabvala, for her perfect adaptations. Callie Khouri, Robin Schiff, Ted Tally, Alan Ball."
