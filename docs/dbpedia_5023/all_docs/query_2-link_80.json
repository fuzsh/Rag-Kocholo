        "text": "1930s England. Darlington Hall runs like clockwork under one of the last truly great butlers. Reserved and dutiful like his father before him and with the funny and forthright housekeeper Kenton by his side, Stevens faithfully serves his employer. Meanwhile, England stands on a precipice, as fascism builds and boils in Europe.\n\n20 years later, Stevens travels to find an old friend, remembering choices made and not made, journeying to one last chance at happiness.\n\n2017 Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel, which became a beloved Merchant Ivory film, is a story for anyone who has ever been afraid to follow their heart.\n\nNow transformed into an exquisite stage play by one of Britain’s most exciting writers (Barney Norris), it receives its world premiere at Royal & Derngate before embarking on a major national tour."
