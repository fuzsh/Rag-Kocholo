        "text": "London: Faber and Faber, 1989. First edition. A Fine copy in Near Fine jacket. Bright and clean interior. Dust jacket with toning to spine, but maintaining original price on front interior flap.\n\n\"A lack of restraint is perhaps the best response to Ishiguro's novel, which is the tale of a man so burdened by propriety that he lets the love of his life slip through his fingers. Mr. Stevens is chief of staff at an English stately home; as the novel opens, in the summer of 1956, he is set to undertake a motoring trip to visit Miss Kenton, a housekeeper who left 20 years earlier to get married...Unreliable narrators are ten a penny in fiction. Ishiguro, instead, likes to give us unwitting narrators: speakers who remain trapped in self-preserving fictions, mysteries even to themselves. Bit by bit you learn to look for the real emotions running beneath the buffed surface of the prose...The Remains of the Day does that most wonderful thing a work of literature can do: it makes you feel you hold a human life in your hands. When you reach the end, it really does seem as if you've lost a friend\" (Beech). An incredible novel encompassing the wide-ranging effects of class on love, relationships, and self-knowledge, Nobel Prize winner Ishiguro earned the Booker Prize for this work in 1989. It was soon after adapted into a film starring Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Emma Thompson. Fine in Near Fine dust jacket. (Item #6499)"
