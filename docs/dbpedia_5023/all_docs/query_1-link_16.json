        "text": "The Sword and the Flute\n\n1959/U.S., 20 minutes\n\nIvory's second documentary, The Sword and The Flute, also dealing with schools of art, grew out of his experience in making Venice: Theme and Variations. Only here, instead of photographing works by the Italian masters, he has used superb examples of Indian miniature paintings. Ivory's intelligent script, narrated with feeling by Saeed Jaffrey, and accompanied by the music of Ravi Shankar and Ali ... MORE…\n\nThe Creation of Woman\n\n1960/, 14 minutes\n\nA year after The Sword and the Flute, Merchant produced his first film, the 14-minute short The Creation of Woman. Made while he was working at the McCann-Erickson advertising agency, it was shot on the most meager of budgets, a mere $9,000 advanced by Charles Schwep, an acquaintance of the time, partner in the endeavor, and the film's director. At first Merchant considered ... MORE…\n\nThe Householder\n\n1963/India, 101 minutes\n\nIn 1961, Ismail Merchant and James Ivory paid a visit to the German-born novelist Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, then living in Delhi, with a proposal to make a film of her novel The Householder. Jhabvala agreed. She wrote the screenplay for the film herself, in ten days, and the Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala partnership was inaugurated. Filmed entirely on location in Delhi, The ... MORE…\n\nThe Delhi Way\n\n1964/U.S., 50 minutes\n\nThe Delhi Way --produced, written, photographed, and directed by Ivory--was begun before The Householder but completed after it. A documentary of Delhi, it scans the city's historic past that includes successive Afghan, Moghul, and English invasions, while it reveals its variegated life of the present. At the opening a train moves along a landscape in darkness to evoke (as in a film...

MORE…\n\nThe Guru\n\n1969/India, 112 minutes\n\nAfter Shakespeare Wallah, Merchant Ivory became interested in two movie projects that in the end failed to materialize.

Vikram, who is married to the beautiful but barren young Mala (Aparna Sen), falls in love with Lucia ... MORE…\n\nAdventures of a Brown Man in Search of Civilization\n\n1972/U.K., 54 minutes\n\nAfter Bombay Talkie, Merchant Ivory turned next to a documentary. BBC television commissioned them to do a film on Nirad Chaudhuri, the celebrated Indian polymath whom Merchant, Ivory, and Jhabvala had all known in India, and who was then in England doing research for a book on the Sanskrit scholar Max Müeller. Chaudhuri is clearly an extraordinary man. His interests are not only ... MORE…\n\nSavages\n\n1972/U.S., 106 minutes\n\nThe genesis of the company's next feature film, Savages, goes back to 1970. In an article in the Autumn 1971 issue of the British film journal Sight and Sound, Ivory relates that he came across a Colonial Revival mansion in Scarborough, forty minutes north of New York City, that had intrigued him. Called Beechwood, it belonged to the Vanderlip family, Midwesterners who derived their ... MORE…\n\nHelen, Queen of the Nautch Girls\n\n1973/India, 31 minutes\n\nHelen, Queen of the Nautch Girls, a 30-minute documentary film that looks at an aspect of Indian culture from a rather whimsical angle, has always been a popular Merchant Ivory film.

It was directed and narrated by him, but the scenario was devised by... MORE…\n\nMahatma and the Mad Boy\n\n1974/India, 27 minutes\n\nMerchant Ivory's next film, a 27-minute short, was not only produced but for the first time also directed by Merchant. Mahatma and the Mad Boy, the idea for which was suggested by Sajid Khan, a child star of Indian films who plays the vagrant boy on a Bombay beach, was filmed in 1973 and received highly favorable reviews when it was shown in London the following year. It cost $25,000 to ... MORE…\n\nThe Wild Party\n\n1974/U.S., 100 minutes\n\nTime also has a framing role in The Wild Party, shot soon after Autobiography of a Princess. It has a curious history, having been inspired by a blank-verse narrative poem of 1926 by Joseph Moncure March about a disastrous Greenwich Village party given by a vaudeville comic in his walk-up apartment. The lyricist Walter Marks saw in it the idea for a musical film, with the setting changed... MORE…\n\nAutobiography of a Princess\n\n1975/UK, 59 minutes\n\nIn 1974 Merchant Ivory made two new films, Autobiography of a Princess and The Wild Party. Although released after The Wild Party, Autobiography of a Princess was the first to be filmed.

In The Waltz a widow (Teresa Wright) dreams incessantly of her departed husband, imagining his younger self in the Ballroom mirrors, still whirling her over the dance floor. Lou Jacobi, a rough diamond type, brings ... MORE…\n\nHullabaloo Over Georgie and Bonnie's Pictures\n\n1978/India, 85 minutes\n\nn 1977 the London Weekend Television arts programs called \"The South Bank Show\" made a proposal through its presenter Melvyn Bragg to Merchant Ivory to make a television film for them. The subject was open, so long as it had an arts connection. Ivory was receptive, and the subject of collecting Indian miniature paintings, an interest of his since The Sword and the Flute, was eventually ... MORE…\n\nThe Five Forty-Eight\n\n1979/U.S., 58 minutes\n\nIn 1979, shortly after The Europeans was completed, Ivory took on an assignment outside Merchant Ivory Productions. One day at lunch he heard that Channel 13 television in New York was doing three adaptations of John Cheever stories for the \"Great Performances\" series, and that one of them, \"The Five Forty Eight,\" adapted by Terrence McNally, had no director. Ivory ...

MORE…\n\nQuartet\n\n1981/France, 101 minutes\n\nt has been said that most great twentieth century novels include scenes in a hotel, a symptom of the vast uprooting that has occurred in the last century: James Ivory begins Quartet with a montage of the hotels of Montparnasse, a quiet prelude before our introduction to the violently lost souls who inhabit them. Adapted from the 1928 autobiographical novel by Jean ... MORE…\n\nCourtesans of Bombay\n\n1983/India, 73 minutes\n\nAfter completing Quartet, Merchant and Ivory returned to India, where they prepared two movies during 1981-82. The more modestly scaled, and the first to be released (in January 1983), was the 73-minute documentary (or \"docudrama,\" as Merchant refers to it) The Courtesans of Bombay, which was both produced and directed by Merchant. (The other was Heat and ...

Forster to dazzling life in the Florentine countryside and in the well-appointed homes of the English Edwardian upper classes.

MORE…\n\nMaurice\n\n1987/U.K., 135 minutes\n\nThe traditional bildungsroman, or novel of education, ends with a marriage. E.M. Forster's Maurice(1914), the second of his novels to be adapted by Merchant Ivory, takes on a subject that no major novel in the genre had ever addressed: the problem of coming of age as a homosexual in a restrictive society.
