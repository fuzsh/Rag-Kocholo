        "text": "Nantucket film festival honors writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\n\nRuth Prawer Jhabvala is responsible for some of the screen's most prestigious films, including \"Howards End\" and \"A Room With a View,\" which earned the screenwriter a pair of Oscars. As one-third of the respected filmmaking team that includes producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory, the trio has been responsible for brand-name films that owe a large part of their prestigious pedigree to Prawer Jhabvala's literate, lively scripts. â€”\n\nAnd yet, this soft-spoken 79-year-old woman, who divides her time between India and New York City, doesn't see many movies. Unlike dozens of American screenwriters who came of age inside the local moviehouse, Prawer Jhabvala was raised on books.\n\nBorn in Germany (her family fled the country in 1939) and raised in England, where she discovered the works of Dickens and read \"Gone With the Wind\" during air raids, she earned a master's degree in English literature from London University. She moved to India with her architect husband, Cyrus Jhabvala, in the early 1950s and, while raising three daughters, began to publish her signature fiction about culture clashes, usually from the point of view of an outsider.\n\n\"\"I never saw films in India, because the great filmmakers like Satyajit Ray were not shown in India. The so-called Bollywood films were shown all over, but those were not great films\"\" she says in a telephone interview from New York.\n\nFestival recognitionDespite her literary roots, the prolific writer, whose latest collection of short stories will be published next year, is no snob when it comes to writing for the screen.\n\n\"I took the literary route, but more and more young people feel as close to film as I do to books. Where it was natural for me to write a novel, they write a movie,\" she says.\n\nShe's written eight novels, four short story collections, and 23 screenplays (\"Le Divorce,\" which stars Naomi Watts and Kate Hudson, will be released in August). So it is fitting that Prawer Jhabvala will be honored by the Nantucket Film Festival, which celebrates writers. She will be honored from 6 to 8 tonight at the festival's annual NBC's Screenwriter Tribute at the 'Sconset Casino.\n\nThe festival was scheduled to screen Prawer Jhabvala's \"Heat and Dust\" (1983), which she adapted from her own 1975 Booker Prize-winning novel, yesterda \"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge\" (1990) which she adapted with novelist Evan S. Connell, at 9:30 tomorrow morning at Gaslight Theater. Prawer Jhabvala cites \"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge\" and her 2000 adaptation of Henry James' \"The Golden Bowl\" as her favorites of her films.\n\n\"'The Golden Bowl' is James' best, most complex novel. It was James Ivor Joanne Woodward who brought me 'Mr. Bridge and Mrs. Bridge,'\" which Connell wrote as two separate novels and which were adapted into one script. Prawer Jhabvala won the Best Screenplay Award from the New York Film Critics Circle for the adaptation, which starred Woodward and Paul Newman.\n\nIn addition to being feted at the festival, Prawer Jhabvala will take part in a panel discussion with her longtime collaborators and friends Ivor Merchant. Their 30-year affiliation began simply, she says. In 1963, the fledgling Merchant-Ivory production team bought her novel \"The Householder,\" and asked her to adapt it into a screenplay.\n\n\"They had no idea about films,\" she says. \"They'd only done documentaries. We were all novices. Ismail is a great salesman, and he sold the film to Columbia. After that, we made 'Shakespeare-Wallah' and then 'The Guru.' They set up offices. It was like riding a tiger we could not get off.\"\n\n'The Europeans' The first Merchant-Ivory film that made it big in the United States was \"The Europeans\" (1979). Prawer Jhabvala says they chose this work by Henry James because it was \"the simplest to do.\"\n\n\"We would have liked to do one of his more complex works, but that would have cost more money, and we didn't have money.\"\n\nFrom the start, Prawer Jhabvala was the kind of screenwriter who toiled quietly behind the scenes.\n\n\"I never go over the script with the actors I never go on the set,\" she says. Her acclaimed adaptations of two novels by E.M.. Forster, \"A Room with a View\" (1985) and \"Howards End\" (1992) earned the screenwriter her two Academy Awards, and Hollywood recognition, but both times she could not attend the ceremony.\n\n\"The first time, I was in India. The second time, I could not go I don't remember why. But they are wonderful trophies.\"\n\nShe remains a frequent contributor to The New Yorker, with her most recent story collection published in 1998. Among her accolades are a MacArthur Foundation Award in 1984 and the Writers Guild of America's Screen Laurel Award, the guild's highest honor, in 1994.\n\n\"People send me books all the time, but there are very few I want to adapt. I was dying to adapt James and Forster on the whole, I enjoy adaptations more than [writing] original screenplays,\" she says.\n\n\"If I did not write fiction, I would probably enjoy writing my own screenplays. But I prefer to enter into someone else's sensibility.\""
