        "text": "Jhabvala was, in her own words, “practically born a displaced person” (Gooneratne). In the spring of 1939, when she was twelve years old, she and her family were among the last to escape from Nazi Germany to England. In all, they lost some forty relatives in the Holocaust, and many more besides: “My father’s entire family, part of my mother’s family, the children I went to school with, and most of my parents’ family friends—in fact, our entire social circle.”\n\nJhabvala seldom spoke of this or of her childhood, but in a rare public lecture, given in 1979, she said of the years 1933–1936:\n\nThey should have been my most formative years, and maybe they were, I don’t know Together with the early happy German-Jewish bourgeois family years 1927–1933—they should be that profound well of memory and experience (childhood and ancestral) from which as a writer I should have drawn. I never have…. I don’t know why not. I do know that they were the beginning of my disinheritance—the way they are for other writers of their inheritance.\n\nWhile she did not write directly about this “moment of disinheritance,” her work set in the West was peopled by German-Jewish characters who lead dislocated, albeit comfortable existences, far from home. Of these, “A Birthday in London” perhaps comes closest to describing Jhabvala’s own adolescent years in England. In this work, Sonia Wolff, a widowed German-Jewish emigrée, hosts a birthday party. As dusk falls, she and her friends sit over apfel strudel and coffee and try not to talk about the old times. It is a melancholy but spirited gathering. At one point Sonia’s son Werner breezes in, but while he is fully at ease in London, for his mother and her friends it has not been easy to start over in a country where no one knows your name or what it stood for. As Mrs. Gottlob bravely reflects: “‘Yes, there we were all different people. … Still, here we all are, no bones broken, eh, Lumbik?’” Like Bruno in In Search of Love and Beauty, Sonia’s husband Otto has simply wasted away. (Jhabvala’s father committed suicide in London in the 1950s.)\n\nJhabvala’s passage to India was an inversion of the immigrant’s move from east to west, but while the country’s poverty and corruption rankled with her sense of social justice (India remained for her a “great animal of poverty and backwardness” as she explained in “Myself in India”), she found life there “much closer to the Jewish world I knew than the Anglo-Saxon world,” and came across very Jewish attitudes towards, for example, the ritual of food, which often features in her writing. But even by marriage Jhabvala was an outsider, since her husband was a Parse, a member of a generally well-educated and prosperous ethnic group whose position in Indian society is not dissimilar to that of the Jews in Europe. While Sonia and her friends drink strong coffee in continental cafes and sit in dark apartments full of heavy furniture, their children ponder their disinheritance. In In Search of Love and Beauty, Bruno’s daughter Marianna adopts a Jewish baby, Natasha, in an attempt to tune into her heritage. But Natasha, with her “pale ghetto complexion, her dark inward-looking eyes,” is not what she expects, and it turns out that Marianna has confused her image of a Jewish child with that of a Russian one. Later in the novel, Marianna’s son, Tim, takes up his own search for the WASP landscape he feels he should rightfully have inherited from the father he barely knew.\n\nIn “Myself in India” Jhabvala wrote, “I’m absolutely passive, like blotting paper,” explaining elsewhere: “Not really having a world of my own, I made up for my disinheritance by absorbing the worlds of others.” Just as she captured the Anglo-Indian experience so comprehensively in Heat and Dust, so her many successful screenplays, including Howards End and A Room with a View, written for Merchant-Ivory (both of which won Academy Awards), evoke an England more English than ever it was. Her characters are often animated by a desire to absorb and appropriate the better qualities of others. In In Search of Love and Beauty, Leo Kellerman, typical of Jhabvala’s messianic male figures, draws a harem of searchers in his wake, while Boy in “A Summer by the Sea” exercises a similar, albeit less manipulative, fascination over both men and women, and in “Great Expectations,” a career woman’s careful, solitary life is turned upside down by a golden-haired, fairy-like trio.\n\nAs one who espoused James Joyce’s view that writing is all about “silence, exile and cunning,” Jhabvala’s disinheritance was as productive as any inheritance. To quote Yasmine Gooneratne, hers are “novels of expatriation” in all its various guises: national, cultural, emotional, familial. Her multiple exile left her with an ambivalent identity: early blurbs described her as a Polish writer; she as a Westerner in the East, and an Easterner in the West; and just when we might have got the measure of her, she added another layer to her camouflage by moving back west to spend half her time in New York, a transition she chronicled in East into Upper East. Significantly, her My Nine Lives: Chapters of a Possible Past (2004) is a semi-autobiographical novel that sets out a series of nine alternative life stories, each of which the author feels she could have lived.\n\nFiction\n\nTo Whom She Will (1955; as Amrita, 1956).\n\nThe Nature of Passion (1956).\n\nEsmond in India (1958).\n\nThe Householder (1960).\n\nGet Ready for Battle (1962).\n\nLike Birds, Like Fishes and Other Stories (1963).\n\nA Backward Place (1965).\n\nA Stronger Climate: Nine Stories (1968).\n\nAn Experience of India (1971).\n\nA New Dominion (1972; as Travelers, 1973).\n\nHeat and Dust (1975).\n\nHow I Became a Holy Mother and Other Stories (1976).\n\nIn Search of Love and Beauty (1983.\n\nOut of India: Selected Stories (1986).\n\nThree Continents (1987).\n\nPoet and Dancer (1993).\n\nShards of Memory (1995).\n\nEast into Upper East: Plain Tales from New York and New Delhi (1998).\n\nMy Nine Lives: Chapters of a Possible Past (2004).\n\nPlays\n\nShakespeare Wallah: A Film, with James Ivory (1973).\n\nAutobiography of a Princess, Also Being the Adventures of an American Film Director in the Land of the Maharajas, with James Ivory and John Swope (1975).\n\nScreenplays\n\nThe Householder (1963).\n\nShakespeare Wallah, with James Ivory (1965).\n\nThe Guru (1966).\n\nThe Bombay Talkie (1970).\n\nAutobiography of a Princess, with James Ivory and John Swope (1975).\n\nHullabaloo over Georgie and Bonnie’s Pictures (1977).\n\nRoseland (1977).\n\nThe Europeans (1979).\n\nA Call from the East (1981).\n\nQuartet (1981).\n\nHeat and Dust, with Saeed Jaffrey and Harish Khare (1983).\n\nThe Bostonians (1984).\n\nA Room with a View (1985).\n\nMadame Sousatzka, with John Schlesinger (1988).\n\nHowards End (1992).\n\nThe Remains of the Day (1993).\n\nJefferson in Paris (1995).\n\nOther\n\nMeet Yourself at the Doctor (1949)."
