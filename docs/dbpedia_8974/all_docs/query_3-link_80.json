        "text": "Deadline day for Zimbabwe's election challenge\n\nZimbabwe's opposition MDC Alliance is expected to present its legal challenge to last week's presidential election result.\n\nThe MDC Alliance has to submit its case to the Constitutional Court on Friday to comply with a deadline under Zimbabwean law.\n\nA lawyer for defeated presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa said the party had all the evidence it needed to mount a credible, sustainable case.\n\nThe opposition party said the election was marred by \"mammoth theft and fraud\".\n\nHowever, the electoral commission says there was \"absolutely no skulduggery\".\n\nThe official winner of the election, President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa - who is known as \"the crocodile\" because of his political cunning, has called for unity, peace and reconciliation.\n\nThe court must rule on any challenge within 14 days.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has said it is gravely concerned by reports of the detention and beating of opposition activists since the election.\n\nIt comes after the arrest of top MDC Alliance politician Tendai Biti, who was deported on Thursday by Zambia after the government there rejected his request for asylum.\n\nProsecutors say he falsely declared Mr Chamisa the winner of the election, and encouraged his supporters to damage property during protests against the election results\n\nMr Biti was granted bail and is expected back in court on Friday.\n\nFriday's wise words\n\nOur proverb of the day:\n\nQuote Message: Some animals may escape today's hunt, but tomorrow is another hunting day.\" from Sent by Chikwendu Bright Chigozirim and David Jeremiah, both from Nigeria\n\nSome animals may escape today's hunt, but tomorrow is another hunting day.\"\n\nSent by Chikwendu Bright Chigozirim and David Jeremiah, both from Nigeria\n\nAFPCopyright: AFP\n\nClick here to send us your African proverbs.\n\nGood morning\n\nWelcome to BBC Africa Live where we will bring you the latest news from around the continent.\n\nScroll down for Thursday's stories\n\nWe'll be back tomorrow\n\nThat's all from the BBC Africa Live page for now but keep up-to-date with what's happening across the continent by listening to the Africa Today podcast or checking the BBC News website.\n\nA reminder of today's wise words:\n\nQuote Message: Your enemy will say you are raising too much dust even if you are dancing on water.\" from Sent by Sofa Dominic in Kaduna, Nigeria, and Saani in Calgary, Canada.\n\nYour enemy will say you are raising too much dust even if you are dancing on water.\"\n\nSent by Sofa Dominic in Kaduna, Nigeria, and Saani in Calgary, Canada.\n\nAnd we leave you with this photo from a shisha bar in Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott:\n\nZimbabwe president: I released Tendai Biti from custody\n\nZimbabwe's President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa says that opposition politician Tendai Biti has been released on bail following his \"intervention\".\n\nHe added in his tweets that \"due process will continue\":\n\nIt means that Mr Biti will return to court at a later date to face charges of inciting violence after last week's elections.\n\nHe had preempted the official announcement of the results by saying MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa had defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the poll.\n\nMr Biti fled to neighbouring Zambia on Wednesday, but was deported to Zimbabwe earlier today and taken to Harare Magistrates Court in the afternoon.\n\nEritrea hunt for Pentecostal Christians after sermon\n\nBBC Tigrinya\n\nSecurity agents in Eritrea are hunting for Pentecostal Christians who attended an informal sermon given by an Ethiopian evangelist last month.\n\nPreacher Surafiel Demssie had travelled to the capital, Asmara, on the first Ethiopian Airlines flight to Eritrea after the two countries ended their 20-year feud.\n\nEritrea only has four religions - Orthodox Christianity, Sunni Islam, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Evangelical-Lutheran church of Eritrea. Other religious groups are considered illegal.\n\nSo far, five of those who welcomed the preacher have been arrested in Asmara and others have gone into hiding fearing arrest.\n\nOne person, who is believed to have hosted the preacher, was arrested at the airport and taken away by security.\n\nSecurity agents dressed in civilian clothes picked up some of those arrested.\n\n\"At first the police said they were arrested for blocking a road and would be released soon,\" said a relative of one of those arrested.\n\nBut later it transpired it was the National Security Agency who had arrested them, he said.\n\n\"We were very happy when the peace agreement was signed between Ethiopia and Eritrea,\" said Kesete Beraki, who advocates for the release of those in detention.\n\n\"We were hoping there would be changes in Eritrea too, but so far we have been disappointed.\"\n\nThose arrested have not appeared before a court. Prisoners of conscience, including followers of evangelical churches, do not get charged formally before any court of law.\n\nHuman rights activist say hundreds of followers of these illegal churches are in detention.\n\nThe government banned Pentecostal churches in 2002 and several religious leaders have been detained incommunicado for more than a decade.\n\nAmnesty calls for release of Egypt activist\n\nMore than 30,000 people have signed a petition to get an Egyptian woman who complained online about sexual harassment released from pre-trial detention.\n\nAmal Fathy is due to appear before the Maadi Misdemeanours Court in Cairo on Saturday - but campaign group Amnesty International says it is unclear what charges Ms Fathy faces and is calling for her release.\n\n“It is a shocking case of injustice. She is a human rights defender who told her truth to the world and wanted to highlight the vital issue of women’s safety in Egypt. She is not a criminal,\" says Amnesty's North Africa Campaigns Director Najia Bounaim.\n\nIn the video Ms Fathy uploaded earlier this year she criticised the Egyptian government for not doing enough to protect women and for providing what she says are poor public services.\n\nSomalia sees increase in Islamic State activity\n\nAnalysis\n\nBBC Monitoring\n\nThe world through its media\n\nThe Islamic State (IS) group has been mounting noticeably more attacks in Somalia in recent months, following the group's loss of its \"caliphate\" heartlands in Syria and Iraq late last year.\n\nIn a major claim on 25 July, IS said it had killed or wounded 14 Somali soldiers in a bomb attack in Lower Shabelle in southern Somalia.\n\nBBC Monitoring has collected data on IS attacks in Somalia from January to July 2018 that reveals interesting trends about the group's activity in the country.\n\nMost of the attacks that IS has claimed in Somalia were labelled as targeted \"assassinations\" against Somali intelligence and security personnel, with some of them filmed taking place in broad daylight in public.\n\nAnd while the group had initially claimed many of the attacks in the south-western city of Afgoye, most of its latest claims were reported in the capital Mogadishu.\n\nDespite IS's growing activity in Somalia this year, it remains eclipsed by its arch-rival al-Shabab, which is backed by al-Qaeda.\n\nRead more on the BBC Monitoring website\n\nEbola vaccines begin in DR Congo\n\nAFPCopyright: AFP\n\nPeople most at risk of contracting the deadly Ebola virus in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are now being given vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\n\nA total of 3,220 doses have been made available to people living in North Kivu province where the outbreak is concentrated. The vaccine alliance Gavi has struck a deal with the drug's developers to provide additional doses of the vaccine that are still in the testing stage.\n\nForty-four people are believed to have been infected with the virus - of whom 36 have died.\n\nThe latest flare-up comes weeks after the WHO declared an end to a separate outbreak which killed 33 people in north-western DR Congo.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy Ebola keeps coming back\n\nIn pictures: Life after West Africa's Ebola outbreak\n\nRussian fans beg club to sign DR Congo player\n\nPaul Brown\n\nBBC Monitoring\n\nMembers of a Russian online football community have staged a social media campaign to encourage a Premier League team to sign a player from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nJo Kanda, who is studying economics in the Russian town of Novomoskovsk, rose to prominence after a strong performance for his local team Vityaz during a recent tournament, in which he scored seven goals.\n\nAfterwards he expressed interest in playing for Russian side Arsenal Tula FC, prompting a wave of support on Russian social media platform VKontakte.\n\nAnd the plan might have worked. Kanda has since said that he is in contact with the club.\n\nDeported Zimbabwean opposition figure taken to court\n\nTendai Biti is at Harare Magistrates Court, the BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports.\n\nHis lawyer says he will face a charge of inciting public violence following last week's elections in which at least six people died.\n\nThe Zimbabwean opposition figure had fled to Zambia on Wednesday but was deported on Thursday morning.\n\nLawyers for Mr Biti have told the BBC that this happened at the Chirundu border post - and say that earlier suggestions that their client would be crossing the border at Kariba were intended to mislead people so as to avoid commotion at Chirundu.\n\nAn Al Jazeera journalist has tweeted this footage of Mr Biti arriving at court a short while ago:\n\nGunners welcome drummers of Rwanda\n\nDrummers from Rwanda have treated Arsenal players to a surprise performance at their training ground, the club tweets:\n\nThe English Premier League side have been sponsored by Rwanda's national tourist board, Visit Rwanda, since May in a deal which cost $39m (£30m).\n\nThe relationship has raised eyebrows.\n\nRwanda received almost $1.2bn (£932m) in a year from international donors at the last count in 2016, the latest data from the OECD shows.\n\nCritics of Rwanda's President Paul Kagama - most of whom are outside the country - say he rules through fear. He won last year's election, a process he had previously called \"just a formality\", with 98.63% of the votes.\n\nHowever, many have defended the deal by pointing out that tourism is a key source of income for Rwanda, which is said to boast some of the best gorilla and wildlife-spotting opportunities in the world:\n\nAfrican authors refused visas for UK festival\n\nMoment/Getty ImagesCopyright: Moment/Getty Images\n\nAbout a dozen writers from African and Middle East countries hoping to attend a book festival in Scotland this weekend have had their visa applications refused, the event organisers say.\n\n\"We’ve realised it is systematic,\" Edinburgh International Book Festival Director Nick Barley has told the UK Guardian news site, \"this is so serious\".\n\nThe festival organisers haven't named the authors in question.\n\nIt follows similar complications at last month's Womad festival, where at least three African acts on the bill were unable to perform due to visa complications with British immigration.\n\n\"Do we really want a white-breaded Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?”, said Womad's founder Peter Gabriel after the ordeal.\n\nZimbabwe opposition figure 'detained by police'\n\nReutersCopyright: Reuters\n\nZimbabwean opposition politician Tendai Biti has been detained at Harare Central Police Stations, according to his lawyers.\n\nLawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) say they managed to \"track down\" the veteran figure in the opposition MDC Alliance after he was deported from Zambia.\n\nHe fled to Zambia on Wednesday after Zimbabwe police issued an arrest warrant for him.\n\nPolice accuse the human rights lawyer of inciting post-election violence and announcing his party's leader, Nelson Chamisa, defeated president-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa in last week's election.\n\nAt least six people were killed in an army crackdown on protests against the results.\n\n'Little to celebrate on SA Women's Day'\n\nMany in South Africa are questioning if there is much to celebrate on Women's Day today, as a funeral is held for a prominent anti-rape activist who took her life after an alleged sexual assault.\n\nLast week before her death, 23-year-old law student Khensani Maseko, had written a post on Instagram saying: \"No-one deserves to be raped!\"\n\nDays earlier the third year student had reported to the authorities at Rhodes University in Grahamstown that she was allegedly raped by a fellow student in May. But it wasn't until three days after her death that the university confirmed its decision to suspend the alleged perpetrator.\n\nDuring her funeral in Johannesburg, police minister Bheki Cele said there was an urgent need to teach boys the importance of respecting women, the Times reports.\n\n\"Stop making them super kings. Boys grow up owning everything‚ including women around them. We have made it normal that boys have extra access to girls’ bodies.\"\n\nSouth Africa has one of the highest rape statistics in world - last year there were nearly 4,000 cases reported to the South African police.\n\nOn social media, people said they struggled to celebrate Women's Day in light of Ms Maseko's death:\n\nZambia 'takes revenge on Biti'\n\nAnalysis\n\nKennedy Gondwe\n\nBBC News, Lusaka\n\nThe Zambian government has probably taken its revenge on Tendai Biti by deporting him to Zimbabwe.\n\nMr Biti came to Zambia last year to show solidarity with opposition leader Hakaide Hichilema after he was arrested on treason charges.\n\nHe was scathing in his criticism of Zambia's President Edgar Lungu, accusing him of behaving like then-President Mugabe by targeting Mr Hichilema. So, it is not surprising that Zambia has deported him.\n\nZambia's ruling Patriotic Front (PF) party has always been a staunch ally of Zanu-PF, which has been in power since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Its founding leader, the late Michael Sata, was inspired by Mr Mugabe, and like him regarded the MDC as a \"puppet of the West\".\n\nWhen Mr Sata formed the party in 2001, he named it PF to signal that it would forge close ties with Zanu-PF. The relationship remains strong some 17 years later, albeit it with new leaders at the helm of the two parties.\n\nVeteran BBC Africa editor to retire\n\nBBC Africa's Deputy Editor Josephine Hazeley is retiring after 31 years leading teams in bureaux across the continent and in London.\n\nIn that time, she has helped navigate endless changes in the media. Watch her reflect on this, and more:\n\nMeet the world's deadliest cat\n\nDon't let its cute looks deceive you - this is the world's deadliest cat with a 60% hunting success rate.\n\nThe black-footed cat, which is native to southern Africa, is the smallest wild cat species in the world.\n\nHere's one in action:\n\nTributes for South Africa rapper ProKid\n\nThe death of South African rapper ProKid has shocked many in the country, with fans taking to social media to pay tribute to his life and music:\n\nFamily of the Soweto-born musician say he died of a seizure in Johannesburg on Wednesday after 20:00 [18:00GMT].\n\n\"A friend called the paramedics, they got there and they tried to help him, to revive him\", his former manager and friend Mpho Motsoaledi is quoted by Eyewitness News as saying.\n\nProKid, whose real name was Linda Mkhize, is survived by his wife, Ayanda, and their three-year-old daughter as well as his parents and two brothers, says the Sowetan Live news site.\n\nOne of his best-loved songs, 2012's Makasana, spoke of coming from a township background and striving to make one's path in life:"
