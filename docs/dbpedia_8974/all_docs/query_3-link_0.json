        "text": "1802–1925 unit of Russia\n\nGovernorate in Russian Empire\n\nYekaterinoslav Governorate[a] was an administrative-territorial unit (guberniya) of the Russian Empire, with its capital in Yekaterinoslav. It bordered Poltava Governorate to the north, Don Host Oblast to the east, Sea of Azov to the southeast, Taurida Governorate to the south, and Kherson Governorate to the east, and covered the area of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts of modern Ukraine.\n\nThe government was created in 1802 when the Novorossiya Governorate was split into three governorates. The Yekaterinoslav Governorate bordered to the north with the Kharkov Governorate and Poltava Governorate, to the west and southwest with the Kherson Governorate, to the south with the Taurida Governorate and Sea of Azov, and to the east with Don Host Oblast.\n\nThe governorate was created in place of Novorossiysk Governorate in 1802 and encompassed a huge area of the southern Ukraine. Officially, the new governorate was created as Ekaterinoslav Governorate in 1802 and subdivided into the following uyezds with centres in:\n\nCounty County Town Arms of County Town Area Population\n\n(1897 census) Transliteration name Russian Cyrillic Aleksandrovsky Александровскій Aleksandrovsk 10,015.8 km2\n\n(3,867.1 sq mi) 271,678 Bakhmutsky Бахмутскій Bakhmut 9,224.8 km2\n\n(3,561.7 sq mi) 332,478 Verkhnedneprovsky Верхнеднѣпровскій Verkhnedniprovsk 6,862.3 km2\n\n(2,649.5 sq mi) 211,674 Yekaterinoslavsky Екатеринославскій Yekaterinoslav 7,858 km2\n\n(3,034 sq mi) 357,207 Mariupolsky Маріупольскій Mariupol 8,989.2 km2\n\n(3,470.7 sq mi) 254,056 Novomoskovsky Невомосковскій Novomoskovsk 6,532 km2\n\n(2,522 sq mi) 260,368 Pavlogradsky Павлоградскій Pavlograd 8,815.7 km2\n\n(3,403.8 sq mi) 251,460 Slavyanoserbsky Славяносербскій Lugansk 5,089 km2\n\n(1,965 sq mi) 174,753\n\nTaganrog city (Таганрог) 1802–1887\n\nRostov upon Don city 1802–1887\n\n1874, the Mariupol (Марiуполь) uyezd was split off the Aleksandrovsk uyezd.\n\n1887, Rostov-na-Donu city as well as Taganrog city with its uyezd were transferred back to the Don Host Oblast.\n\n1918, Taganrog uyezd was transferred once again, but without the Taganrog city and later again returned to the Don Voisko Province. The Ukrainian People's Republic passed the law for the reformation of the Ukrainian administrative division dividing the governorate into five new lands. The law has failed to be implemented and was canceled due to the conservative coup d'état of Pavlo Skoropadsky and establishment of the Ukrainian State. Thus the territory of the governorate was left unchanged and sustained without any major changes until 1919.\n\n1919 Krivyi Rih uyezd was created partially out of the newly annexed lands of the Kherson Governorate.\n\n1920 Governorate yielded few territories in favor of the newly created Olexandrivsk Governorate and Donetsk Governorate\n\n1922 Zaporizhia Governorate was abolished and its territories returned under the subordination of Yekaterinoslav Governorate together with some of Kremenchuk Governorate.\n\n1923 All Governorates uyezds were reformed into seven okrugs with two of them (Berdiansk and Oleksandriysk okrugs) liquidated on 3 June 1925.\n\nOn 1 August 1925, the Yekaterinoslav Governorate administration was discontinued.\n\nList of okruhas of Ukraine upon the dissolution of the Governorate:\n\nYekaterinoslav\n\nZaporizhia\n\nKryvyi Rih\n\nMelitopol\n\nPavlohrad\n\nThe governorate's population, a majority of peasants, was 662,000 in 1811, 902,400 in 1851, 1,204,800 in 1863, and 1,792,800 in 1885. From the second half of the 19th century, with the founding of Yuzovka (Donetsk), the governorate became the coal-mining and metallurgical center of the then Ukraine, incorporating the Dnieper Industrial Region and the Donbass (Donets Basin).\n\nIts population increased to 2,113,674 by 1897. The nationalities within the governorate were Ukrainians – 68.9%, Russians – 17.3%, Jews (4.7%), Germans (3.8%), Greeks (2.3%), and Tatars (0.8%). In 1924, the governorate had 3,424,100 (13.6% urban) inhabitants, living in 5,165 settlements, 36 of them being cities and urban-type settlements. The largest social class was that of workers (about 25%).\n\nThe data is taken from demoscope.ru. Here is also the most common language composition.\n\nYekaterinoslav – 112,839[3] (1897), (Russian – 47,140, Jewish – 39,979, Ukrainian – 17,787)\n\nMariupol – 31,116 (Russian – 19,670, Jewish – 4,710, Ukrainian – 3,125)\n\nLugansk – 20,404 (Russian – 13,907, Ukrainian – 3,902, Jewish – 1,449)\n\nBakhmut – 19,316 (Ukrainian – 11,928, Russian – 3,659, Jewish – 3,223)\n\nAleksandrovsk – 18,849 (Ukrainian – 8,101, Jewish – 5,248, Russian – 4,667)\n\nPavlograd 15,775 (Russian – 5,421, Ukrainian – 5,273, Jewish – 4,353)\n\nNovomoskovsk – 12,883 (Ukrainian – 9,956, Jewish – 1,436, Russian – 1,237)\n\nVerkhnedneprovsk – 6,501 (Ukrainian – 3,752, Jewish – 2,061, Russian – 739)\n\nSlavianoserbsk – 3,122 (Russian – 1,607, Ukrainian – 1,342, Jewish – 143)\n\nFrom the turn of the 19th century until 1887 city of Rostov-na-Donu and all the Taganrog uyezd were part of the governorate, but before the census of 1897 took place they were transferred to the Don oblast. Note that the biggest city of the guberniya was the city of Rostov-na-Donu while Taganrog was not much smaller and the third in size.
