        "text": "The war in Ukraine reignited Wednesday and, as always, each side is blaming the other for attacking. But there had been signs that a renewed rebel/Russian assault was imminent and, this time, the facts are pretty clear.\n\nFirst, a week ago, Reuters reported on a buildup of troops, howitzers, unmarked tanks and other equipment at a base 30 miles from an unmonitored, unofficial border crossing. The reporters observed and photographed three times as much equipment as they had seen in March, and trainloads more arriving daily. There had been similar reports of a Russian arms buildup previously, but this one nailed it."
