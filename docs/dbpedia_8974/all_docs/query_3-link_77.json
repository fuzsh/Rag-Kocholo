        "text": "Russia's massive wave of missile and drone strikes on Ukraine over the past several weeks has caused an abrupt rise in civilian casualties, reversing a downward trend observed earlier last year, the United Nations says in a new report.\n\nThe report by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said that in December alone, 101 Ukrainian civilians were killed and 491 were wounded in Russian strikes, amounting a 26.5 percent month-on-month increase in verified casualties. HRMMU said the actual figure is believed to be higher, as many reported cases are still pending verification.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"The December increase in civilian casualties was mainly due to intensified missile and loitering munitions attacks by Russian armed forces across Ukraine on 29 and 30 December. Attacks with these types of weapons accounted for 34 percent of civilian casualties in December compared with 16 percent in November,\" the report said.\n\nDanielle Bell, the head of the HRMMU, said the wave of attacks in late December and early January have reversed a downward trend observed in 2023.\n\n\"These attacks sow death and destruction on Ukraine's civilians who have endured profound losses from Russia's full-scale invasion for almost two years now,\" Bell said.\n\nThe intensified wave of missile and drone strikes caused the largest number of casualties among civilians on December 29 and January 2, with the HRMMU saying it is currently verifying reports that 86 people may have been killed and 416 being wounded during that interval.\n\nHeavy Russian strikes continued after January 2, the UN mission said, highlighting a missile attack on the small town of Pokrovsk and nearby Rivne village on January 6 in the eastern region of Donetsk close to the front line.\n\nThe attack left two families -- six adults and five children -- buried under the rubble after their homes were struck. Some of the bodies are still missing, despite days of frantic efforts by rescue teams, the UN said.\n\nIn another incident, in Novomoskovsk in the Dnipropetrovsk region, a Russian missile strike on January 8 wounded 31 civilians, including eight passengers of a minibus during the morning commute, the UN said.\n\nSince the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the total number of verified civilian casualties has risen to 29,330 -- 10,191 people killed and 19,139 wounded, the HRMMU report said.\n\nThe UN humanitarian office’s operations director, Edem Wosornu, told the UN Security Council on January 10 that at least 575 children have been confirmed killed since the start of the invasion.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nThe trial started in Minsk on August 19 of 12 people over a drone attack at the Machulishchy Air Base near the Belarusian capital in late February 2023 that damaged a Russian military plane.\n\nThe Vyasna human rights center said the defendants, many of whom are being tried in absentia, were charged with high treason, terrorism, facilitating extremist activities, financing terrorist activities, organizing and preparing of activities that blatantly disrupt public order, premeditated damage of vehicles, illegal operations with weapons and explosives, participation in terrorism training, etc.\n\nThe defendants include Maksim Lapatsin, Andrey Stsyapurka, Aleh Sychou, Dzyanis Sakalou, Anastasia Pilko, and six other defendants who are not in Belarus -- Alyaksandr Azarau, Yauhenia Tachytskaya, Mikhail Dzyomin, Syarhey Laparau, Vital Yakutsik, Ala Yatsuta, and Ukrainian national Mykola Shvets.\n\nThe leader of the Belarusian antigovernment group ByPol, Alyaksandr Azarau, said in July last year that the attack at the Machulishchy Air Base that damaged Russia's A-50 early warning and control plane was a joint operation by ByPol and Ukraine's Security Service (SBU).\n\nRussia used the Machulishchy Air Base near the Belarusian capital for aircraft involved in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022.\n\nAlthough the invasion was partly organized in Moscow-allied Belarus, authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka has sought to downplay his regime's role in the conflict.\n\nBelarusian authorities said at the time they arrested more than 20 men and women suspected of involvement in the high-profile attack.\n\nBelarusian investigators claimed the Ukrainian national, Shvets, was an SBU agent. Shvets and several other Ukrainians were released and returned to Ukraine in a prisoner swap in June, but despite that Shvets is among the Belarusians being tried in absentia.\n\nIn March this year, Ukrainian officials confirmed the SBU's involvement into the attack at the Belarusian airbase.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Ukrainian forces are fulfilling their objectives while pressing their incursion into Kursk as Moscow acknowledged a third bridge critical for the Russian troops' movement had been damaged in the Russian region.\n\n\"The chief of staff also reported about the new developments in the operation in Kursk region. We are achieving our goals. In the morning there was another replenishment of the exchange fund for our state,\" Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram, in an apparent reference to Russian troops taken prisoner by Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has damaged a third bridge over the River Seym in Russia's Kursk region, Moscow confirmed on August 19.\n\nA video statement from a representative of Russia's Investigative Committee was posted on the Telegram channel of Russian state TV anchor Vladimir Solovyov. In the video, the investigator said Ukrainian forces had struck the bridge a day earlier.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nOn August 18, Ukraine’s Air Force Commander Mykola Oleschuk said his troops had damaged a second strategic bridge over the Seym, limiting Russia’s supply capacity as it tries to prevent Ukraine from bolstering its positions.\n\nRussian military bloggers previously posted an image of the first bridge that was hit near the village of Zvannoye in Kursk.\n\nAccording to Russian security officials, the destruction of that bridge cut off part of the Glushkov district.\n\nAnalysts say taking out bridges over the Seym is crucial for Ukraine to ensure a secure flank to its offensive in Kursk by making it difficult for Moscow to supply its troops south of the river.\n\nUkraine launched its surprise counteroffensive into Russia's Kursk region on August 6, altering the dynamics of the 2 1/2-year war and causing 120,000 people to flee.\n\nZelenskiy on August 18 said Ukraine's main task is \"to destroy as much Russian potential as possible and conduct maximum counterattack work,\" with the aim of creating a \"buffer zone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, intense fighting continued in the eastern region of Donetsk, Zelenskiy said, as Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have captured the village of Zalizne.\n\n\"Heavy fighting continues in the Pokrovsk direction, and the defense of Toretsk,\" Zelenskiy said in his message on Telegram, while regional Governor Vadym Filashkin said, \"We are starting the forced evacuation of families with children from the Pokrovsk community.\"\n\nEarlier on August 19, Russian shelling in Donetsk killed three and injured nine people, according to Filashkin.\n\nHe said Ukraine's main task is \"to destroy as much Russian potential as possible and conduct maximum counterattack work,\" with the the aim of creating a \"buffer zone.\"\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:49 0:00\n\nGovernor Vasily Golubev of Russia's Rostov region that borders Ukraine said on August 19 that a state of emergency was introduced in the town of Proletarsk. The day before, 18 firefighters were injured while trying to extinguish a massive fire caused by drone attacks.\n\nGolubev also said four firefighters are in serious condition, adding that despite all efforts to extinguish the fire, the situation remains \"the same.\"\n\nLocal authorities said on August 18 that Ukrainian forces staged two drone strikes at the oil depot.\n\nKyiv said the attacks were organized by the Ukrainian armed forces and Ukraine's HUR military intelligence service.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian shelling in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region killed three and injured nine people, the head of the regional military administration, Vadym Filashkin, said on August 19.\n\nHe said casualties were reported in Myrnograd, Toretsk, and Rozliva.\n\nRussia also launched 11 Shahed-type drones toward Donetsk and several other regions, including Kyiv, but the Ukrainian Air Force said they had all been intercepted.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nA court in Russia's Far East city of Vladivostok on August 19 rejected the appeal filed by the lawyer of U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Gordon Black against his sentence of three years and nine months in a general regime penal colony on charges of theft and threat to kill.\n\nBlack, who had been on active duty in South Korea, was arrested in May in Vladivostok, where he traveled to meet a Russian woman he was romantically involved with.\n\nBlack, 34, was accused of theft and making death threats against the woman, who had filed a complaint with prosecutors.\n\nOn June 19, a Vladivostok court found him guilty and sentenced him to three years and nine months prison.\n\nBlack's lawyer said on August 19 that the regional court's decision would be appealed.\n\nDuring the hearing, Black's defense argued that the first trial court had been unfair and mischaracterized his actions.\n\nAccording to the court, Black had been living with Russian woman Aleksandra Vashchuk in Vladivostok since April. In May, they had a fight, during which the defendant grabbed the girl by the neck, \"which she perceived as a real threat to her life.\"\n\nSince he had no money, Black took 10,000 rubles ($112) from Vashchuk's wallet, which he spent on paying for a hotel room, where he was detained.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Black was finishing his service in South Korea and was supposed to return to Texas when he instead traveled to Russia.\n\nBlack is one of several U.S. citizens held in Russia on a variety of charges.\n\nDual Russian-American citizen Ksenia Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in prison on August 15 after a Russian court found her guilty of treason for donating $51 to a charity supporting Ukraine.\n\nA group of Russian antiwar activists held a gathering in the Montenegrin city of Budva on August 18 in memory of opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and to express their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nOne of the organizers of the gathering, a man who identified himself only as Artem, said the demonstrators also wanted to show support for Russian political prisoners.\n\n\"We are here to pay respect to Navalny for everything he has done for our country and to say that we support Ukraine,\" he told RFE/RL.\n\nAuthorities allowed the gathering on the main square in Budva with the condition that there be no banners or musical performances, the organizers said. Some of those gathered ignored the condition and carried pictures of Navalny and banners saying \"Russia without Putin, stop the war.\"\n\nThey also showed photos of 20 Russian political prisoners who they say were killed or died in prisons.\n\nNavalny, the most prominent among them, had been convicted in trials that he and his associates judged to be politically motivated before he died on February 16 in a prison in Russia’s Arctic under suspicious circumstances. Many Russians living in Montenegro turned out then to pay their respects to him.\n\nThose gathered on August 18 said there are still around 1,600 political prisoners in Russia, quoting data from the civil sector.\n\nA protest participant who gave his name only as Vasily said he and the others wanted to assure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"We do not forget you and we are proud of you, [proud] of people who have the courage to publicly say what they think,\" Vasily told RFE/RL.\n\nVasily also said he believes that the only chance for change in his country is Putin's departure from the political scene.\n\nAnother participant, Russian dissident and artist Marat Gueljman, said that a change of government is the only hope for Russians in the country.\n\nGueljman said three years ago, Putin's power in Russia was \"incredibly strong” and no one could have guessed then that the army of another country could be on Russian territory and that thousands of people would be in prison for opposing Putin.\n\n\"So, with this war, Putin made a mistake. No one can destroy the system better than the people who built it. Putin will destroy that system,\" Gueljman said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Azerbaijan for a two-day state visit, the Kremlin’s press service said on August 18.\n\nRussian television broadcast images of Putin's plane arriving in Baku in the evening.\n\nPutin is due to hold talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev, on bilateral relations and \"international and regional problems\" during his visit, the Kremlin said.\n\nOne of the main topics to be discussed will be the further development of the “Russia-Azerbaijan strategic partnership and alliance,\" the Kremlin’s press service said. Other “relevant international and regional issues” are also expected to be discussed.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, a joint statement and several other documents will be signed. RIA Novosti reported that in addition to signing the documents Aliyev and Putin will also make statements to the press.\n\nPutin is expected to comment on peace negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have been taking place following years of conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nYerevan and Baku have been negotiating a peace treaty since Azerbaijan retook control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September 2023 in a lightning offensive.\n\nA traditional ally and partner of Russia, Armenia recently has turned toward improving its ties with the West and putting on ice its relations with Moscow, which Yerevan has blamed for failing to support it in its conflict with Azerbaijan.\n\nMoscow, which regards both former Soviet republics to be in its sphere of influence, has been perturbed by Armenia’s efforts to deepen its ties with Western countries, especially the United States.\n\nAlso on Putin's schedule is a wreath-laying on August 19 at the tomb of Heydar Aliyev, the father of the current leader, who was president from 1993 to 2003.\n\nPutin last visited Azerbaijan in September 2018. During that visit, he watched the judo world championship and participated in the ninth plenary session of the Russia-Azerbaijan interregional forum.\n\nThe Caucasus country is a close partner of Moscow but also a major energy supplier to Western countries.\n\nAzerbaijan is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, meaning Putin is able to travel to the country without fearing arrest under the international warrant issued for him by the court for war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nTop officials of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan marked 105 years of of the country's independence on August 18 by demanding mutual respect from the international community.\n\nAfghanistan gained its independence in August 1919 after the signing of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty, which ended British control over the country’s foreign affairs.\n\nAfghanistan currently remains unrecognized internationally, largely because of the restrictions the Taliban-led government has placed on women since it returned to power in August 2021.\n\nThe anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty was marked at a meeting of top Taliban leaders in Kabul broadcast live by the Taliban-controlled National Radio and Television.\n\nMullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban's acting defense minister, told the meeting that the government wants strong relations with the world based on mutual respect but will never give in to pressure.\n\nHe also said the Taliban, which seized power after the U.S.-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile, will never allow the Islamic State and other destructive groups to create chaos in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Whether they are Daesh (Islamic State) or other rebels, they should hear…that we have not surrendered to anyone's power at any cost. By any name, we have established the Islamic system in this land. We will defend it till death and the last century.\"\n\nThe international community has previously expressed concern about the presence of the extremist Islamic State group in Afghanistan, while the Taliban has said it is the only group capable of ruling and establishing security in the country.\n\nHamid Karzai, who served as the first elected president of Afghanistan from 2004 to 2014, marked the anniversary of the signing of the treaty by calling on the Taliban to allow girls and women to attend school and university.\n\n“I call on the caretaker Islamic government to open the doors of schools and universities in the country as soon as possible so that girls equipped with the jewels of knowledge can play their part in the development of the country alongside their brothers,” Karzai said on X. “Education and national unity are the forces that will keep the country strong.”\n\nSince returning to power in August 2021, the Taliban has banned girls and women from studying beyond primary school.\n\nThe United Nations said on August 15 that at least 1.4 million girls in Afghanistan have been denied access to secondary education and this has almost wiped out two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan, leaving the future of an entire generation in jeopardy.\n\nHungary has responded to a letter sent by Nordic and Baltic countries expressing concern about Budapest’s decision to make it easier for Russian and Belarusian citizens to enter Hungary.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on August 18 that the letter sent to EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson showed an alarming level of “disregard for fact.”\n\n\"We regret to see that our colleagues from Nordic and Baltic countries continue to pursue their campaign of lies directed against Hungary,” Szijjarto said on Facebook.\n\nThe letter, signed by ministers of eight Nordic and Baltic countries and sent to Johansson on August 15, expressed concern that Hungary’s decision “may constitute a serious security risk to all Member States.”\n\nAll eight countries -- Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden -- are in Europe’s Schengen zone in which travelers can cross internal borders without having to show their passports or other documents.\n\nEstonian Foreign Minister Marhus Tsahkna posted the letter on X on August 16, saying that easing entry for Russians and Belarusians “is not justified when Russia continues its war in #Ukraine & is intensifying hybrid actions against EU.”\n\nThe letter said this includes “sabotage, acts of violence, provocations at borders and instrumentalization of migrants.” It said all eight countries concluded at the NATO summit in July that “these actions constitute a threat to our security.”\n\nBut Szijjarto disagreed, saying in his response on August 18 that including Russian and Belarusian citizens in Hungary’s National Card program does not pose any security risk to the Schengen area because the Belarusian and Russian citizens who arrive in Hungary must still undergo thorough checks to enter and stay in the country.\n\n“Any claims to the contrary are outright lies from our Nordic and Baltic colleagues who have been blinded by their adherence to the pro-war camp,\" Szijjarto said.\n\nBudapest published details of its National Card program last month after it took over the European Union's rotating presidency.\n\nThe program is a new fast-track visa system for citizens of eight countries, including Russia and Belarus, to enter Hungary. Budapest has said many of those who enter would be employed in the construction of a nuclear power plant that is contracted to Russia’s Rosatom.\n\nJohansson voiced concern about the decision earlier this month in a letter addressed to Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter asking Budapest for clarifications. She said Russia is a security threat for the European Union and pointed to the need of \"more, not less vigilance.\"\n\nRussian citizens do not face a ban on entering the EU and the Schengen Area, which also includes non-EU members Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland, if they possess a valid visa and have no ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine’s air force says a second bridge in Russia’s Kursk region has been struck as Kyiv tries to weaken Russia’s combat operations in the area.\n\n“Minus one more bridge,” Air Force Commander Mykola Oleschuk wrote on Telegram on August 18. “The air force continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precise air strikes, which significantly affect the course of hostilities.”\n\nMoscow has not yet commented on the strike, which came nearly two weeks into Ukraine's surprise counteroffensive into Russia’s Kursk region, altering the dynamics of the two-and-a-half-year war and causing 120,000 people to flee.\n\nRussian military bloggers previously posted an image of the first bridge that was hit. It spans the Seym River near the village of Zvannoye in Kursk.\n\nAccording to Russian security officials, the destruction of that bridge cut off part of the Glushkov district, making it more difficult for the civilian evacuation out of the region.\n\nOn August 16, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine of using American long-range rockets to destroy a key bridge in the Glushkov district in the Kursk region, killing in the process \"volunteers\" helping to evacuate civilians.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:01 0:00\n\nAnalysts say taking out bridges over the Seym is crucial for Ukraine to ensure a secure flank to its offensive in Kursk by making it difficult for Moscow to supply its troops south of the river.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian operation in Kursk \"is still inflicting losses on the Russian Army and the Russian state, their defense industry, and their economy.\"\n\nHe said in his evening address on August 18 that his top military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, told him that the situation at the front is showing \"good results\" in all directions.\n\nIn addition, he said there were \"good and necessary results in the destruction of Russian equipment near Toretsk,\" a town in the Donetsk region north of the regional capital.\n\nUkraine's main task now is \"to destroy as much Russian potential as possible and conduct maximum counterattack work.\" This \"also applies to the creation of a \"buffer zone\" thanks to the operation in the Kursk region, he added.\n\nAleksei Kulemzin, the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Donetsk, said a man and a woman were killed by Ukrainian shelling on August 18, according to Reuters. The claim could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine.\n\nFighting elsewhere in the Donetsk region prompted Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukrainian deputy prime minister and minister of reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories, to urge citizens of Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, and Selydove to evacuate.\n\n\"The situation remains difficult in the Pokrovsk area. Therefore, I appeal to the residents of settlements in the immediate vicinity of the front line...please evacuate. If you are not involved in the defense of settlements, then you should leave for safer regions,\" Vereshchuk said.\n\nIn Russia, debris from a drone downed in the Rostov region caused a fire at a diesel fuel storage facility in an industrial warehouse in the early hours of August 18, regional Governor Vasily Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nHe said firefighting units were putting out the fire in the Proletarsk district and added that there were no casualties.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian military said its forces hit a facility in the Rostov region where oil and oil-products used by the Russian military are stored. At least two fires have been recorded on the territory of the facility, the General Staff said.\n\nIn Ukraine, authorities in the Kharkiv region said a 52-year-old woman was injured in Kupyansk as a result of shelling by the Russian Army. Private homes were also damaged, the local prosecutor-general's office said.\n\nIn addition, a nearby village was shelled, damaging equipment belonging to a utility company. There were no casualties, the press service of the prosecutor-general's office said.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the Russian Army used rocket-propelled grenades in the attack.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses had intercepted five Ukrainian drones overnight over Belgorod, Kursk, and Rostov. Kyiv does not usually comment on reports of drone attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, said on August 18 that Russia had launched its third ballistic missile against the Ukrainian capital this month.\n\nHe added that Russian forces had then launched a cruise missile toward Kyiv.\n\nPopko said on Telegram that the Russians had likely used a KN-23-type North Korean ballistic missile to target the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe head of Kyiv's regional military administration, Ruslan Kravchenko, said two private houses were destroyed in the attack and dozens of other homes were damaged. There were no injuries reported, he said.\n\nUkraine's air force said earlier that it had downed eight drones and five missiles in total over the Kyiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions.\n\nWith reporting by dpa and Reuters\n\nAs mass protests in Belgrade against the development of a lithium mine rattle Serbia's leadership, officials are looking to blame the West.\n\nWashington, for its part, said the protests are just an example of democracy at work, shrugging off accusations it somehow has a hand in it the events.\n\n\"Peaceful protest and the right of citizens to demonstrate and speak freely is an important part of democracy,\" the State Department said in a response to an RFE/RL request for comment to accusations in Belgrade and Moscow.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic earlier this week accused demonstrators who opposed the multibillion-dollar lithium-mining project of being part of Western-backed \"hybrid\" warfare against his government, without giving any evidence.\n\nMoscow has accused the West of being behind the protests, while Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin thanked the Russian security agencies for warning his government about alleged \"preparations for mass unrest and an attempted coup.\"\n\nSerbia and Russia maintain close ties even as Belgrade seeks to join the European Union. The United States last year designated Vulin for sanctions for his ties to the Kremlin.\n\nIn a response to RFE/RL on August 17, the State Department said any assertion that the United States supports anti-government protests in Serbia \"is false.\"\n\n\"We are not surprised that Russia, in contrast, has instrumentalized protests to pursue its own agenda in Serbia, as it does around the globe,\" the State Department told RFE/RL on August 17.\n\nThe protesters demand a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's $2.4 billion lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nIn 2022, the Serbian government rejected the project in the wake of massive public protests amid concerns over its impact on the environment.\n\nBut it reinstated the plan on July 16 this year, days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nJadar has the capacity to supply 90 percent of Europe's current lithium needs and make Rio Tinto one of the world's leading lithium producers. Serbia is seeking to process the lithium locally and use it for the production of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nSuch large-scale mining projects often trigger protests in Western countries by local residents who fear the ecological devastation outweighs any potential economic gains. In the United States, citizens have sought to stop lithium projects in Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nSerbia is no different. Citizens fear the Jadar mine will pollute water and land resources in a country that already suffers from significant environmental degradation, a legacy of communist rule.\n\nLithium is typically mined through a process called brine mining, which involves extracting lithium from underground saltwater reserves, opening up the possibility of water contamination.\n\nThe Serbian lithium project could play a critical role in Western EV supply chains as Washington and Brussels seek to reduce dependency on rival China.\n\nThe United States and Europe have put policies in place to significantly increase the number of EVs on the road in the coming years as they seek to reach emission targets.\n\nAs a result, global lithium demand is expected to surge. China is currently the third-largest producer of lithium after Australia and Chile but the largest lithium refiner and producer of batteries for EVs, giving it signficant influence over markets.\n\nThe project would also be a boon to Western investors in Rio Tinto."
