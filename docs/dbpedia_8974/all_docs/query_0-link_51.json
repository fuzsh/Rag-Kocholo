        "text": "Donbass, which is currently at war, is not the first time it has become the target of invaders. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War the mastery of the Donbass was among the priority tasks assigned to the Wehrmacht.\n\nSuch a desire of the Nazis was explained by the highest industrial potential of the area. The city of Stalino, as Donetsk was then called, was one of the largest industrial centers of the Soviet Union, providing 7% of the all-Union coal production, 5% of steel production and 11% of coke production.\n\nBy the beginning of 1941, there were more than 220 enterprises of union and republican subordination in Stalino.\n\nIn the early autumn of 1941, fierce battles flared up for the Donbass. Despite the desperate resistance of the Soviet troops, on October 20, 1941, German and Italian troops entered Stalino. The occupation of Donbass began, stretching for a long 700 days.\n\nFirst renaming, then killing\n\nOne of the first decisions of the invaders was the decision to rename streets and squares in order to completely erase the memories of the “Bolshevik regime” from the memory of local residents. The city itself was given back its former name Yuzovka, Lagutenko Avenue became Bazarnaya Street, Truda Avenue became Museum Street, Fallen Communards Avenue became Nikolaevskaya Street, Tchaikovsky Avenue became Sadovaya Street, Dzerzhinsky Avenue became Pozharnaya Street, and so on.\n\nThe Nazis established a strict regime, trying to ensure the speedy restoration and use of local industry.\n\nDuring the years of the occupation of Donbass, Soviet underground workers and partisan detachments. In response, the Nazis carried out punitive actions and mass executions. The pit of mine No. 4/4-bis in Stalino turned into a huge mass grave. During the occupation, from 75 to 100 thousand people were dropped there. Some were thrown into the mine after being shot, others alive. Of all the victims, no more than 150 people were identified.\n\nHold on no matter what\n\nDespite the most severe repressions, the Nazis failed to subdue the inhabitants of Donbass - resistance continued throughout the entire period of occupation.\n\nThe eastern part of Donbass was liberated by Soviet troops in February 1943, immediately after the victory at Stalingrad. However, it was not possible to develop success due to the lack of reserves for further offensive, and also because of the stubborn resistance of the Nazis.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, at a meeting with the generals of the Wehrmacht, Hitler attached great importance to holding the Donbass.\n\nThe defeat of the Germans on the Kursk Bulge and the successful offensive of the Soviet troops in the Belgorod-Kharkov direction created the conditions for the expulsion of the invaders from the Donbass.\n\nThe task was entrusted to the Soviet group of troops, numbering more than a million soldiers and officers, 21,000 guns, 1,257 tanks and 1,400 aircraft. The Nazis could oppose the advancing about 540 thousand soldiers and officers, 5400 guns, 900 tanks and 1100 aircraft.\n\nThe southern front is breaking through\n\nThe Donbass operation of the Soviet troops began on August 13, 1943 with the offensive of the right wing of the Southwestern Front. These units, having crossed the Seversky Donets River, assisted the Steppe Front in the liberation of Kharkov.\n\nThe offensive in the center of the Southwestern Front, which began on August 16, was stopped by the Germans almost immediately - Soviet troops could not overcome the line of powerful enemy fortifications on the Mius River, the so-called \"Mius Front\".\n\nHowever, the impact of the Southwestern Front General Rodion Malinovsky forced the Nazis to use a significant part of the reserves to repel it.\n\nOn August 18, taking advantage of the situation, the troops of the Southern Front under the command of General Fyodor Tolbukhin. To fend off this blow, the German Army Group South, commanded by Field Marshal Erich von Manstein could no longer. On the very first day of the offensive, Soviet troops broke through the defenses of the Nazis to a depth of 8-9 kilometers.\n\nBy the end of August 20, the breakthrough of the troops of the Southern Front was already up to 24 kilometers in depth and up to 16 in width.\n\nBattle for Saur-Mogila\n\nFulfilling Berlin's directive to hold the Donbass at all costs, Manstein ordered a series of counterattacks, thanks to which the Red Army's offensive was slowed down. But on the night of August 24, the Soviet units occupied the road to Taganrog, depriving the enemy of the opportunity to maneuver with reserves.\n\nOn August 28, the assault on Saur-Mogila, a peak of strategic importance in the Donbass, began. The battle for Saur-Mogila lasted three days and was especially fierce. On the morning of August 31, the soldiers of the 96th Guards Rifle Division finally threw the enemy from the top, starting to pursue the retreating Nazis.\n\nOn August 30, Soviet troops, with the support of an amphibious assault, liberated Taganrog, surrounding and defeating the 29th German corps in the city area.\n\nOn September 5, 1943, units of the Southern Front entered Artemovsk. Manstein reported to Berlin - the continuation of holding the Donbass is fraught with the complete defeat of Army Group South. Hitler was forced to give the green light to the withdrawal of troops across the Dnieper.\n\nRevelations of Manstein\n\nAs Mantshein wrote in his memoirs, the retreat from the Donbass was \"the most difficult operation\" of 1943-1944. The Germans did not have time to take out ammunition, property, and even the wounded. The evacuation was extremely complicated by the blows of the Red Army.\n\nWhat the Germans could not take with them, they destroyed using the scorched earth tactics. “In the zone 20-30 km in front of the Dnieper, everything that could help the enemy immediately continue his offensive on a wide front on the other side of the river was destroyed, destroyed or taken out to the rear, that is, everything that could be a shelter or quartering place for him, and everything that could ensure his supply, especially the food supply of his troops, ”wrote Manstein. Persons of military age who were in the occupation, the Nazis drove to Germany.\n\nOn September 7, 1943, battles unfolded for the capital of Donbass, the city of Stalino. On the morning of September 8, units of the 50th Infantry Division broke into the city from the direction of Rutchenkovo. Colonel Vladychansky. Fighters of the 301st and 230th rifle divisions and partisans also took part in the liberation of the city.\n\nBy the end of the first half of the day, Stalino was completely under the control of the Soviet troops. Subsequently, it was September 8 that began to be celebrated as the Day of the Liberation of Donbass.\n\nDonbass cannot be broken\n\nTo the troops participating in the liberation of Donbass, by order Supreme Commander dated September 8, 1943, a gratitude was announced and a salute was given in Moscow with 20 artillery salvoes from 224 guns.\n\nThe Donbass operation ended on September 22, 1943, with the withdrawal of Soviet troops to the line Novomoskovsk - eastern Zaporozhye - the Molochnaya River.\n\nIn the battles for the liberation of Donbass from the Nazis, more than 66 thousand Soviet soldiers and officers were killed, more than 200 thousand were injured. The exact losses of the Nazis are unknown.\n\nFor military skill, mass heroism, courage and bravery shown during the Donbass operation, over 40 formations and units of the Red Army were awarded the honorary titles of Artyomovsky, Gorlovsky, Slavic, Stalin.\n\nAt the time of the occupation by the Nazis, there were about 400 thousand people in Stalino, about 175 thousand waited for release. Soviet soldiers met the ruins of residential buildings and enterprises, destroyed and half-flooded mines, many of which harbored the bodies of victims of Nazi terror.\n\nBut the Nazis failed to destroy the Donbass. Already by the beginning of 1945, three-quarters of the mines resumed work, and the largest enterprises in the region started working.\n\nCivil War.\n\nFIRST liberation of Donbass.\n\nDonbass operation offensive operation of the Southern Front was carried out on December 25 - 31, 1919 against the Volunteer and the main forces of the Don Army of the Whites during civil war 1918-20.\n\nPursuing the retreating enemy, the Soviet troops of the Southern Front crossed the river on December 23. Seversky Donets and reached the Izyum line, the village of Yama, Lisichansk, Nizhnee, Slavyanoserbsk, and on December 26, having broken the resistance of the enemy, they occupied Popasnaya; and December 27 - Bakhmut.\n\nThe 13th Army captured Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, and the 8th Army captured Lugansk on December 24th.\n\nHaving suffered a defeat in the northern part of the Donbass, the White Guard command decided to stop the Soviet troops at the turn of Gorlovka, Debaltseve, Gorodishche, but parts of the 1st cavalry army inflicted a major defeat on the enemy, on December 29 they drove the enemy out of Debaltseve and Gorodishche, and on December 30 from Gorlovka.\n\nPursuing the retreating enemy, the 11th Cavalry and 9th Rifle Divisions occupied Ilovaiskaya on January 1, 1920, defeating the White Circassian Cavalry Division in the Amvrosievka area. On December 31, units of the 6th Cavalry Division defeated the Markovskaya Infantry Division in the Alekseev-Leonovo area. The remnants of the defeated Ulagay group hastily retreated to the Crimea and Rostov.\n\nIn the battles for the Donbass, the Whites lost about 8 thousand people; Soviet troops captured 24 guns, 170 machine guns, 5 armored trains, etc.\n\nThe Donbass operation was notable for the high maneuverability and decisive actions of the Soviet troops, the clear interaction of the cavalry with the infantry and the skillful use of armored trains. Local partisans rendered great assistance to the Soviet troops.\n\nAs a result of the Donbass operation, a large coal region was liberated and the shortest routes to Sea of ​​Azov and the main center of the southern counter-revolution - Rostov.\n\nRESTORATION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY\n\nFebruary 15 arrived in Yuzovka (Donetsk) I.V. Stalin, appointed chairman of the Council of the Ukrainian Labor Army at a meeting of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the RCP (b), signs a resolution of the Council of the Ukrtrudarm on the creation of the Donetsk province as part of the Ukrainian SSR, although the congress of the volost revolutionary committees of the Yuzovsky district, held in early February, decided on the economic and political merger of the region with Soviet Russia and not with Ukraine.\n\nThe Central Committee and the Council of People's Commissars, not immediately recovering from such dashing Koba, nevertheless approved the \"redrawing\" on March 23. There is nothing to say about the Ukrainian government. The bulk of the population of the republic was made up of the peasantry, who most often followed the anarchists and socialist-revolutionaries. And in the coal region, workers who supported the Bolsheviks prevailed. How not to seize the \"proletariat - the grave-digger of the bourgeoisie\"?\n\nStalin's arbitrariness had rather serious consequences: until December 1924. the confusion continued with the subordination of the province, reaching, at times, almost to armed resistance to the government of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nAlexander Dmitrievsky http://dnews.donetsk.ua/2013/05/26/17640.html\n\nThe Great Patriotic War.\n\nSECOND LIBERATION of Donbass.\n\nDonbass offensive operation of 1943 (August 13-September 22)\n\nBy mid-February 1943, having liberated the eastern part of the Donbass, the troops of the Southwestern and Southern Fronts reached the line along the Seversky Donets River, northwest of Voroshilovgrad, further along the Mius River and east of Taganrog.\n\nThe German command, in an effort to keep the Donbass, created a strong defense at this turn. Numerous wood-earth and reinforced concrete structures were built on the front line and in the depths of the defense.\n\nOn August 11, 1943, Hitler gave an additional order to accelerate the construction of a strategic defensive line, the so-called \"Eastern Wall\", from the Utlyuk estuary through Lake Molochnaya and further along the Molochnaya River, the middle course of the Dnieper, the Sozh River, through Orsha, Vitebsk, Pskov, along the river Narva.\n\nThe Nazi command entrusted the defense of the Donbass region to the 1st Tank and 6th Field Armies, part of the forces of the Kempf task force and the 4th Air Fleet, which are part of Field Marshal E. Manstein's Army Group South and have about 540 thousand people, 5.4 thousand guns and mortars, 300 tanks and assault guns and more than 1,000 aircraft.\n\nBy the beginning of the Donbass operation, the Southwestern Front and the Southern Front had up to 1 million 53 thousand people, about 21 thousand guns and mortars, 1.25 thousand tanks and self-propelled guns, up to 1.4 thousand aircraft.\n\nAccording to the plan of Marshal of the Soviet Union Vasilevsky A.M., the South-Western Front, with a blow from the Izyum region to Barvenkovo, Pavlograd, Orekhov, and, having defeated the enemy, was supposed to go to the Zaporozhye-Pologi region, cutting off the retreat to the west of the Donbass grouping of German troops. The troops of the Southern Front were supposed to inflict main blow from the Kuibyshevo region to Stalino (Donetsk) in order to break through the enemy defenses along the Mius River and, in cooperation with the troops of the Southwestern Front, defeat the German grouping in the south of Donbass, then advance in the direction of the Crimea and the lower reaches of the Dnieper.\n\nOn August 13, the offensive of the South-Western Front began. Despite the superiority in manpower and equipment created over the enemy, the battles, from the very first days of the offensive, took on a tense, bloody character.\n\nOn August 18, the Southern Front also went on the offensive. Developing the offensive against Amvrosievka and repulsing enemy counterattacks, the troops of the front divided the German 6th Army into two parts. These successful actions have created real opportunity defeating the enemy on the southern wing of the Southern Front.\n\nThe advancing formations and units experienced enormous difficulties. Due to the rapid advance of the troops, communications stretched out, there were not enough vehicles, and railways were destroyed almost everywhere. In this difficult situation, the workers of Donbass rendered great assistance to the troops.\n\nFrom Hitler's statement:\n\n“... It is extremely important to continue to keep the Donetsk basin in our hands, and at the same time to destroy everything that is not urgently necessary in the Donetsk region so that if certain conditions will have to be forced to retreat, to deprive the enemy of important economic positions ... \".\n\nIn the struggle for the liberation of the most important industrial region of the country, along with the Red Army, partisans, many residents of Donetsk cities and villages, actively joined. Hundreds of thousands released from German occupation citizens helped restore roads and communications, repair military equipment, care for the wounded, deliver ammunition and other supplies material support troops. Therefore, despite the difficulties, the pace of the advance of troops in the Donbass increased.\n\nAs the position of the troops grew worse, Hitler ordered a planned retreat.\n\nThe troops of the Southwestern Front, pursuing the retreating enemy, by September 22 reached the Novomoskovsk line, east of Zaporozhye, and reached the Dnieper.\n\nOn September 3, formations of the 51st Army of the Southern Front liberated Debaltseve, and on September 4, a division of the 5th Shock Army took Gorlovka. On September 8, the center of Donbass - the city of Stalino (Donetsk) was liberated. The troops of the front, pursuing the enemy, by September 22 reached the area west of Orekhov, the Molochnaya River. Melitopol and completed the liberation of Donbass in their zone. A big role in this was played by partisans and underground fighters, as well as landings landed by the Azov military flotilla in the regions of Taganrog, Mariupol and Osipenko (Berdyansk).\n\nDuring the Donbass operation, Soviet troops advanced to a depth of 300 km and defeated 13 enemy divisions. An important economic region and created favorable conditions for the liberation of Northern Tavria, Right-Bank Ukraine and Crimea.\n\nThe defeat of the enemy grouping in the Donbass was achieved by delivering frontal strikes in the center, followed by the development of success towards the flanks, with the extensive use of mobile troops for maneuvering in the operational depth of the enemy’s defense.\n\nThe losses of the Soviet troops in the operation amounted to: irretrievable - over 66 thousand people, sanitary - over 207 thousand people. For military skill, mass heroism, courage and bravery; manifested during the operation, over 40 formations and units were awarded the honorary titles of Artyomovsky, Orlovsky, Slavic.\n\nThe successful conduct of the Donbas offensive operation was preceded by the Belgorod-Kharkov offensive operation of 1943 on July 12-August 18, which created the conditions for the liberation of the entire Left-Bank Ukraine and access to the Dnieper.\n\nDuring the Belgorod Kharkov operation the troops of the Voronezh and Steppe fronts inflicted a heavy defeat on Army Group South and pushed it back in a south-western direction for 140 km. At the final stage of the operation, the width of the offensive front of the Soviet troops reached 300 km.\n\nSoviet troops in the Belgorod-Kharkov operation lost about 256 thousand people (including over 71 thousand people - irrevocably), more than 400 guns and mortars, about 1.9 thousand tanks and self-propelled guns, over 150 aircraft.\n\nThe losses of the enemy were also great. In the battles near Belgorod, Bogodukhov, Akhtyrka and Kharkov, the troops of the Voronezh and Steppe fronts defeated 15 divisions, including four tank divisions. As a result of defeat in Battle of Kursk German troops were forced to switch to strategic defense on the entire Eastern Front.\n\nAfter the end of the Great Patriotic War, Donbass, restoring the industry, remained a part of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nThird liberation\n\nUntil 1991, before the start of the so-called parade of sovereignties, Ukraine, and the Donbass with the Luhansk region that were part of it, lived and developed as part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was one country in which, shoulder to shoulder, people of all nationalities built factories and factories, spaceports and power plants, laid railways and developed Siberian oil and gas fields.\n\nEverything changed with the coming to power of Gorbachev and Yeltsin, who buried Soviet Union. Former Soviet republics became independent states, a series of civil wars swept through them.\n\nFrom the very beginning of its “independence”, the government of the new state “Ukraine” headed for the glorification of Bandera and his associates, OUN - UPA. What it resulted in can be seen from today's events in Ukraine.\n\nFebruary 2014 in Kyiv, a civil coup took place, as a result of which frank fascists came to power. Residents of Donbass, who do not agree with such a newly-minted government, have moved to action: April 7, 2014 Donetsk and Kharkov People's Republics were proclaimed, and on April 28, 2014. – Luhansk people's republic, as a result of which Kyiv announced a military military operation. The so-called \"ATO\" - anti-terrorist operation. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and nationalist formations did not hesitate to use heavy weapons, multiple launch rocket systems and aircraft, prohibited ammunition and tactical missiles in residential areas. The latest recorded data indicate the death of six thousand civilians. In essence, the ATO is an ABSOLUTELY TERRORIST OPERATION.\n\nIn Kharkov on April 8 power units succeeded in regaining control of the situation.\n\nAccording to the results of the referendums held on May 11 in the DPR and LPR, the self-proclaimed authorities of both republics declared sovereignty on May 12, and expressed their desire to become part of Russia, as well as unite into Novorossia and join the EurAsEC Customs Union.\n\nDespite the large-scale military campaigns and the economic blockade by Kyiv, in the DPR and LPR, their own authorities were created, elections were held, and an army was created.\n\nIn August, a turning point came in the war: first, the rebels captured a sector in the south of the Luhansk region, bordering the Rostov region, and at the end of the month they launched a counteroffensive.\n\nA number of settlements that had to be left earlier in unequal battles with an enemy that has a multiple advantage, thanks to the competent leadership of the armed forces of Novorossia, managed to be returned to the control of the DPR and LPR.\n\nThe textbooks of the history of Novorossiya will include the battles for the Donetsk airport, Saur-Mohyla, Ilovaisk, the defense of Slavyansk, Kramotorsk, Krasny Liman, Donetsk and Luhansk, the encirclement of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the terrorist battalions: the Southern Cauldron, the Ilovaisk Cauldron, the Debaltsevo Cauldron, establishing control over the Russian-Ukrainian border the capture of border points: Stanitsa Luganskaya, Krasnodon, Biryukovo, Sverdlovsk, Dyakovo, Chervonopartizansk, Dolzhansky and Red Grave.\n\nOn August 24, the Independence Day of Ukraine, the rebels launched a major offensive in the south of Donbass and reached the Sea of ​​Azov. On August 28, they were able to take control of Novoazovsk, as well as a number of settlements Novoazovsky, Starobeshevsky, Amvrosievsky districts.\n\nOn September 1, the rebels regained control of the Lugansk airport, which had been held by the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 3 months.\n\nOn September 5, after negotiations, a ceasefire agreement was reached in Minsk.\n\nNovember 6 activated fighting in the DPR, when, according to the rebels, a column of Ukrainian armored vehicles entered Yasinovataya. As a result of the clash, according to the rebels, 4 tanks and 1 armored personnel carrier were destroyed. At the same time, fighting intensified in other sectors of the front.\n\nIn mid-January 2015, full-scale hostilities resumed. This was preceded by the shelling of a bus near Volnovakha.\n\nOn January 22, shelling of Donetsk was carried out. According to the research of the OSCE special monitoring mission, the shelling was carried out from a mortar or artillery gun from the north-western direction. Fighting resumed with renewed vigor at the Donetsk airport, culminating in the transition of the airport territory under the control of the armed formations of the DPR. The front line was moved 1-2 kilometers north of the airport runway.\n\nOn January 23, the head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko, announced his intention to advance to the borders of the Donetsk region, and simultaneously abandoned further initiatives to start negotiations on a truce and an exchange of prisoners.\n\nThe most active hostilities unfolded in the Debaltsevo area, where the rebels occupied a number of settlements, including Uglegorsk. By February 18, Debaltseve completely came under the control of the militia, thus the defeat of the Debaltseve pocket was completed.\n\nAfter the signing of the Minsk agreements on 12 February, clashes continued in various areas, most hot spot became the village of Shirokino in the Mariupol direction and the village of Sands in Donetsk.\n\nAccording to the UN, at the beginning of February 2015, almost 5.5 thousand people died in the Donbas and almost 12.5 thousand were injured, the number of internally displaced people in Ukraine reached 980 thousand people, about 600 thousand more were forced to move to Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Poland, Hungary and Romania. On February 7, 2015, the website of the Ukrainian version of Forbes magazine circulated a statement by Petro Poroshenko, according to which more than 5,600 civilians were killed during the ATO. The Frankfurter Allgemeine on February 8, 2015, citing unnamed sources in military circles, reports 50,000 dead during the conflict.\n\nLosses of the Ukrainian side\n\nAccording to Petro Poroshenko's interview with the First National TV Channel, as of March 9, 2015, 1,549 Ukrainian security forces were killed.\n\nAlso, according to the official information of the National Security and Defense Council and the General Staff Ukrainian army at the beginning of March 2015, 6226 soldiers were injured, 968 armored vehicles were lost.\n\nAccording to Irina Gerashchenko (Presidential Commissioner for the Settlement of the Conflict in Donbass), published on September 19, about 2.4 thousand military and civilians are on the lists of prisoners and missing persons in Donbass. The press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported with reference to the data of the site \"Book of Memory\" yatі zagiblih \", created with the support of the National Military History Museum of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Institute national memory that during the ATO in the period up to February 1, 2015, 1,750 Ukrainian soldiers died.\n\nIt should also be taken into account that even at the beginning of the armed conflict in the east of Ukraine, the Ukrainian media questioned the official statistics of losses announced in Kyiv, since only the losses of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are entered into it, but the losses of the National Guard and volunteer battalions are not taken into account. On August 6, 2014, the speaker of the Novorossiya parliament, Oleg Tsarev, stated that, in his opinion, the Ukrainian leadership underestimates the number of military casualties by 2-2.5 times.\n\nOn August 19, the human rights organization \"Soldiers' Mothers of Ukraine\" announced the deliberate concealment by the Ukrainian authorities of real military casualties in the zone of military operations in the east of the country. In her opinion, according to the secret order of the National Security and Defense Council, only the military are recorded in the accounting of losses, while \"the number of killed policemen, border guards, military from the SBU, national guardsmen and volunteers from territorial battalions is classified.\" According to the soldiers' mothers, \"only in Slavyansk alone, the losses were in the hundreds.\" She also stated that after the retreat of the rebels, the Ukrainian military arrived, “the bodies of all those killed were dumped into a pit and simply covered with an excavator, telling reporters that this was a ‘mass grave’ of local residents killed by the rebels.” According to the human rights organization, “in recent weeks, from 40 to 60 servicemen have been killed every day,” and also says that at the present time at the Kupyansk-uzlovaya station “four refrigerated wagons with the bodies of our military, who liberated the Lugansk region, stand at a dead end” , to which \"even railroad workers are not allowed,\" and the police say that they contain \"secret military cargo.\" She also points out that on July 17, “six refrigerated wagons were sent to the Donetsk region to remove the bodies of the dead.”\n\nUN experts concluded that official data on the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed and injured in the battles in the Donbass are \"inaccurate and contradictory.\" This is indicated in the report on the results of the work of the UN monitoring mission in Ukraine. “The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and the WHO believe that the number of Ukrainian military, civilian and armed groups killed has been underestimated throughout the entire period of the anti-terrorist operation,” the report says.\n\nAs an example, they point to the fact that the National Security and Defense Council reported 151 dead between August 24 and September 12, while the Ministry of Defense stated that 181 ATO fighters were killed only in the Ilovaisk area and some other places of the most intense fighting. “The level of underreporting of military casualties by the government can be seen by comparing the data on the wounded provided by the National Security and Defense Council (3277) with the number of servicemen treated in the main military and civilian medical institutions located in the regions closest to the hostilities - Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Zaporozhye.

The city, whose population was 507 thousand people, provided 7% of the all-Union coal production, 5% of steel production and 11% of coke production. As of the first months of 1941, there were 223 enterprises of union and republican subordination and 54 enterprises of local and cooperative industry in Stalino.\n\nManagement Nazi Germany attached exceptionally great importance to keeping the Donbass in their hands. This industrial region in the south of the European part of the USSR played an important role in military economy Third Reich. Hitler at one of the meetings in August 1943 stated: “It is extremely important to continue to keep the Donetsk basin in our hands, and at the same time destroy everything that is not urgently necessary in the Donetsk region so that, if under certain conditions it is necessary to retreat, deprive the enemy of important economic positions.\"\n\nAfter the defeat of the Nazi troops on the Volga, in February 1943, Soviet troops liberated the eastern part of the Donbass and reached the line of the Severny Donets, Krasny Luch, and Mius rivers. Attempts to break through this heavily fortified line were unsuccessful.\n\nThe defeat of the Nazi troops in the Battle of Kursk (1943) and the successful offensive of the troops of the Voronezh and Steppe fronts in the Belgorod-Kharkov direction created favorable conditions for the liberation of Donbass.\n\nThe Headquarters of the Supreme High Command (VGK) set the troops of the Southwestern Front (General of the Army Rodion Malinovsky) the task of striking from the Izyum, Bogorodichne line in the general direction of Barvenkovo, Pavlograd, Orekhov, defeating the opposing enemy and, having captured the Zaporozhye, Pologi line, cut off the Donbass grouping Nazi troops retreat to the west.\n\nThe troops of the Southern Front (Colonel-General Fyodor Tolbukhin) received the task of breaking through the enemy's strong defenses on the Mius River and, in cooperation with the troops of the South-Western Front, defeating the enemy's Donbass grouping, capturing the Artemovsk, Taganrog, Krasny Luch area. In the future, the front was to advance in a southwestern direction, to the lower reaches of the Dnieper. The offensive of the Soviet troops in the Donbass was supposed to be supported by the 8th (Lieutenant General of Aviation Timofey Khryukin) and the 17th (Lieutenant General of Aviation Vladimir Sudets) air armies. The actions of the Southwestern and Southern Fronts were coordinated by representatives of the Stavka Alexander Vasilevsky, and the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts by Georgy Zhukov.\n\nLarge forces were involved in the Donbass operation. The two fronts included more than 1 million people, about 21 thousand guns and mortars (without rocket artillery), over 1.2 thousand tanks and self-propelled guns (self-propelled artillery), about 1.4 thousand aircraft.\n\nThe most powerful grouping was concentrated in the Southwestern Front.\n\nThe fascist German troops defending in the Donbass were ordered by Hitler to hold their positions at any cost. The 1st Panzer (Colonel-General Eberhard Mackensen) and the newly created 6th Field (Infantry General Karl-Adolf Hollidt) German armies, which were part of Army Group South, defended here. They had about 540 thousand people, 5.4 thousand guns and mortars, up to 900 tanks and assault guns, about 1.1 thousand aircraft.\n\nThe offensive was launched by the troops of the Southwestern Front (August 13 in the Zmiev area, August 16 in the Izyum area). Although the offensive was not developed, it diverted the enemy's reserves and facilitated the actions of the Southern and Steppe fronts. On August 18, the troops of the Southern Front, after powerful artillery preparation and air strikes from the 8th Air Army (Lieutenant General Timofey Khryukin), went on the offensive. During six days of fierce fighting, the 5th shock (Lieutenant General Vyacheslav Tsvetaev) and the 2nd Guards (Lieutenant General Georgy Zakharov) armies broke through the enemy's tactical defense zone north of Kuibyshevo and captured the important Donetsko-Amvrosievka stronghold.\n\nThe front of the 6th German Army was cut and tank and cavalry formations were introduced into the gap, which launched an offensive in a southerly direction, covering the Taganrog enemy grouping. Attempts by the German command to delay the advance of the Soviet troops were not successful. Having regrouped and developed the offensive, the troops of the Southern Front liberated Taganrog on August 30. On September 1-2, the troops of the Southwestern and Southern Fronts proceeded to pursue the retreating enemy and by September 6 advanced 75 kilometers. On September 8, the 5th shock army liberated Stalino (now Donetsk). On the night of September 10, the ships of the Azov military flotilla (Rear Admiral Sergei Gorshkov) landed troops west of Mariupol, which cut off the enemy's escape routes and contributed to the capture of the city by the troops of the 44th Army (Lieutenant General Vasily Khomenko). By September 22, Soviet troops reached the line of Novomoskovsk, eastern Zaporozhye, the Molochnaya River. As a result of a skillful maneuver, Soviet troops, with the assistance of partisans and underground fighters, defeated a large enemy grouping and liberated the country's important coal and metallurgical base - Donbass.\n\nThe successful implementation of the Donbas offensive operation created favorable conditions for subsequent operations to liberate Northern Tavria, the southern part of the Right-Bank Ukraine and Crimea.\n\nThe losses of the Soviet troops in the operation amounted to: irretrievable - 66,166 people, sanitary - 207,356 people. For military skill, mass heroism, courage and courage shown during the Donbass operation, over 40 formations and units were awarded the honorary titles of Artemovsky, Gorlovsky, Slavic and others.\n\nThe material was prepared on the basis of information from open sources\n\nThe end of the hardest year of 1942 and the beginning of 1943 became that \"Rubicon\" in time, the transition of which determined the entire further course of the Great Patriotic War. The barrels of the guns and the engines of the tanks that had defeated the largest enemy grouping near Stalingrad had not yet cooled down. Soviet people rejoice at the fateful victory on the banks of the Volga and in the Don steppes, when the news came from the Soviet Information Bureau - Soviet troops approached the territory of Soviet Ukraine. That vast space that separates the Volga-Don bend from the Donetsk steppe and for which there were bloody battles with a retreat for many months, soviet soldiers in an offensive impulse they were able to free them in a matter of days.\n\nEven on the map you can clearly see that from the banks of the Volga to the banks of the Seversky Donets hundreds and hundreds of kilometers. The first meters of the land of Donbass on the territory of Ukraine were liberated back in January 1943 in the Luhansk region, when the soldiers of the 1st Guards Army of General Kuznetsov liberated the easternmost Ukrainian villages in the Melovsky district.\n\nAnd a month later, summing up the results of the Voroshilovgrad offensive operation from January 29 to February 13, 1943, which received the code name Skachok, the Pravda newspaper of February 24 reported:\n\n“Every day brings liberation to more and more new settlements and cities of the Donetsk basin. Following such cities as Voroshilovgrad, Voroshilovsk, Lisichansk, Kramatorsk, Slavyansk, the city and the railway station of Bokovo-Anthracite, Upper and Lower Nagolchik, Dyakovo and a number of other settlements were recently taken by the Red Army. Everywhere the Germans put up stubborn resistance... In Lisichansk, Proletarsk, Krasnoarmeysk, Rubizhne and other Donetsk cities, Soviet life is being established. Workers came to the mines. Soviet army drives the enemy further and further. As after a long, serious illness, Donbass returns to life ... \".\n\nAnd for thousands of occupiers, the Donetsk steppes really became the last land...\n\nIt was not so easy to go further and further. The German command planned to turn the Donbass into an impregnable fortress area. The liberation of Donbass was also a top priority for the Soviet command. Donbass was of great importance for the Soviet economy.\n\nAnd in the same last days winter, the country first learned about the heroism and tragedy of the members of the Young Guard, the first reports of which appeared on March 1, 1943 after the funeral of the victims of the Gestapo-police terror. By the way, for the first time at the official level, a message about the feat of the Young Guards appeared in the front-line newspaper of the South-Western Front \"Son of the Fatherland\" on April 18, 1943, and then the glory and memory of the \"Young Guard\" went throughout the Fatherland.\n\nDespite the success in conducting Operation Leap, further movement to the west and complete release Donbass was suspended for six months. The Soviet army, like its opponents, was preparing for a decisive turning point. After Stalingrad and the first success on the territory of Ukraine, the army and the rear needed to restore their combat effectiveness, prepare for new tactics of warfare.\n\nWhen you start thinking about the most decisive battles of the Great Patriotic War, the first thing that comes to mind is Stalingrad, Kursk Bulge and the battle for the Dnieper. No doubt, it was they who became milestones of a radical change. But in the same row is the battle for the Donbass. Kursk defensive operation, Orlovskaya and Belgorod-Kharkovskaya offensive operations created all the prerequisites for the beginning of the liberation of the entire Left-Bank Ukraine. The troops of the Voronezh and Steppe fronts, having reached the indicated lines by August 23, began the liberation of the Left-Bank Ukraine and Sloboda. On August 13, the South-Western Front \"said its battle word\", and on August 16 - the Southern Front.\n\nFor the people of Volgograd, the holy place is Mamaev-Kurgan, for the people of Sevastopol - Sapun-mountain, for the people of Kiev - the Dnieper slopes, for the people of Leningrad - the Pulkovo Heights, and for the people of Donetsk - the Saur-mogila.\n\nThis hilly-steppe area is known as the Mius-front, created by the fascist command as an impregnable natural fortress-area of ​​the Donetsk Ridge with engineering defenses and a large concentration of troops and equipment. The significance and power of the Mius Front can be judged even because at that stage it fully corresponded to the plans of the Nazi command. The Mius Front not only delayed the advance of the Red Army in the southern direction for a long time, but also held the Donets Basin. Even the fact that Rostov-on-Don was liberated on February 11, 1943, and Taganrog, which is only seventy kilometers from it, only on August 30, 1943, speaks volumes...\n\nThe German leadership attached exceptional importance to keeping the Donbass in their hands. During the occupation, its economic power (partially restored after the advance of the front to the east) played an important role in the economy of the Third Reich.\n\nFrom the very first days of the beginning of the liberation of Donbass, Hitler directly told his generals: “It is extremely important to continue to keep the Donetsk basin in our hands, and at the same time everything that is not urgently needed in the Donetsk region(I have to make a correction - the region was called Stalinskaya, like its center, the city of Stalino, but Hitler deliberately inserted a geographical name, since the word Stalingrad caused him a fit of hysteria), destroy, so that, if under certain conditions it is necessary to withdraw, to deprive the enemy of important economic positions \".\n\nThe importance of holding the Donbass for the German troops is also evidenced by the fact that even during the battle for Kharkov, the enemy transferred the most combat-ready armored and motorized SS divisions “Viking”, “Das Reich” and “Totenkopf” to the Mius Front.\n\nOne of the tanks of the Totenkopf division on the Mius Front"
