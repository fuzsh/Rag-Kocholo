        "text": "Pro-Kremlin activists rallied in Moscow Saturday outside embassies of countries considered \"unfriendly\" by Russia on the ninth anniversary of its annexation of Crimea, a youth movement said.\n\nThe pro-Kremlin youth movement \"Molodaya Gvardia\" (\"The Young Guard\") said that over 5,000 people demonstrated outside the embassies of 20 \"unfriendly\" nations including the United States, France, Germany and Poland.\n\nThese countries \"support Ukraine... and also actively supply lethal weapons to the Ukrainian regime,\" they said.\n\nAround 400 activists gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow holding up posters with messages such as \"Crimea with Russia forever\" or \"The United States, you sow death,\" an AFP reporter saw.\n\n\"With the help of these weapons, peaceful Crimea can be fired upon and already is,\" the youth movement's head Anton Demidov told AFP.\n\n\"Those countries that supply lethal weapons, we consider them accomplices of this crime,\" he added.\n\nA similar demonstration of some 200 people also took place outside the British embassy, an AFP reporter witnessed.\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 following a referendum that was denounced by Kyiv and Western capitals.\n\nThe annexation has triggered a wave of international condemnation and sanctions.\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\n\nOnce\n\nMonthly\n\nAnnual\n\nContinue\n\nNot ready to support today?\n\nRemind me later.\n\n√ó\n\nRemind me next month\n\nRemind me\n\nThank you! Your reminder is set.\n\nWe will send you one reminder email a month from now. For details on the personal data we collect and how it is used, please see our Privacy Policy."
