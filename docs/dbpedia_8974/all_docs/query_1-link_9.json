        "text": "It is over a year since Russia invaded Ukraine. The war has brought devastating destruction for the country’s people as lives have been lost and Ukraine’s fundamental infrastructure for social, health and economic services has been degraded.\n\nInsecurity Insight focuses on monitoring and analysing five areas of impact:\n\nHealth Care: Insecurity Insight has contributed research for an interactive map displaying incidents of attacks on health care in Ukraine. Our data concerning attacks on health care in Ukraine is available for download here.\n\nEducation: Insecurity Insight monitors attacks on Ukraine’s schools, universities and education professionals. Our dataset is available for download here.\n\nFood Security: Insecurity Insight analyses the impact of the war on both Ukrainian and global food security. Our latest report is available here.\n\nSexual Violence: Insecurity Insight monitors cases of sexual violence perpetrated in the context of the war. Our latest report is available here and our dataset can be downloaded here.\n\nAid Workers: Insecurity Insight monitors the killings, injuries, kidnappings and arrests (KIKA) of national and international aid workers in Ukraine. Our KIKA data is available for download here.\n\n2023 Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition (SHCC) Factsheet\n\nBased on Insecurity Insight data, the SHCC identified 394 incidents of violence against or obstruction of health care in Ukraine in 2023, compared to 885 in 2022. In these incidents, health facilities were damaged or destroyed on at least 192 occasions and occupied by Russian military forces 36 times. The pattern of attacks on health facilities by Russian forces that began in 2022 continued in 2023. The number of military medics killed while providing care to wounded soldiers on the frontlines quadrupled between 2022 and 2023. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian forces repurposed health facilities for military use limiting civilian access and to support military operations.\n\nA Horrific Milestone: More Than 1,000 Attacks on Health Care in Ukraine Since Russia’s Full-scale Invasion\n\nMore than 1,000 attacks on health care workers and infrastructure have been recorded since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, according to documentation and monitoring by human rights and humanitarian organizations. This equates to approximately two attacks per day on health care facilities, workers, and other medical infrastructure.\n\nThis data is available to download and can be explored visually using our interactive map available in English and Ukrainian."
