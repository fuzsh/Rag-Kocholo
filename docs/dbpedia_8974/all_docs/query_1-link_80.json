We are preparing. We are ready.”\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 20:06 GMT\n\nReport: Vast majority of Russian munitions in Ukraine are ‘unguided’\n\nThe New York Times has identified more than 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, “a vast majority of which were unguided”.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, more than 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties.\n\n“All but a handful were cluster munitions, including their submunitions, which can pose a grave risk to civilians for decades after war has ended,” the report said. “More than 330 other weapons appeared to have been used on or near civilian structures.”\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 19:21 GMT\n\nUkraine parliament bans publications from Russia\n\nUkraine’s parliament has adopted a slew of new laws on Sunday, including a ban on public performances of music “of the Russian region” as well as publications imported from Russia and Belarus.\n\nOther laws adopted included the exemption of military personnel “involved in hostilities” from the country’s special war tax.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 18:47 GMT\n\nMorocco calls for ‘fair trial’ for citizen facing Ukraine war death penalty\n\nMorocco’s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a “fair trial” for Brahim Saadoun, a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine.\n\nThe dual Ukrainian-Moroccan citizen, born in 2000, was sentenced to death on June 9 along with two British men by a court in Donetsk, a self-proclaimed statelet in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe trio have been accused of acting as mercenaries for Ukraine following Russia’s invasion of its neighbour.\n\nAmina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, a source from the Moroccan rights council told AFP on Sunday.\n\nShe has urged the Russian body to take “the necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal”, the source said.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 18:15 GMT\n\nUK to change visa rules for unaccompanied Ukrainian children\n\nThe United Kingdom will change visa rules to allow unaccompanied Ukrainian minors to enter the country, The Times has reported.\n\nThe existing rules bar children under 18 who are without a parent or guardian from traveling to the UK.\n\nThis change will allow hundreds of stranded children and teenage refugees to enter the country.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 17:44 GMT\n\nReport: Russia will likely seize Severodonetsk but make little progress on other fronts\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has said that “Russian forces will likely be able to seize [the industrial city of] Severodonetsk in the coming weeks, but at the cost of concentrating most of their available forces in this small area”.\n\nIn a report, the Washington, DC-based think-tank said “The Russian military continues to face challenges with the morale and discipline of its troops in Ukraine.”\n\nGaining full control of the Luhansk region is a main strategic goal for Russian forces, as part of a campaign to try and take complete control of the Donbas.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 17:18 GMT\n\nUkraine hails release of Yuliia Paievska, medic who filmed Mariupol horrors\n\nUkraine has celebrated the release of a Ukrainian medic whose footage was smuggled out of the besieged city of Mariupol by an Associated Press team, and was released by Russian forces, three months after being taken captive.\n\n“I’m grateful to everyone who worked for this result. Taira is already home. We will keep working to free everyone,” President Zelenskyy said, referring to Yuliia Paievska, better known as Taira, a nickname she chose in the World of Warcraft video game.\n\nPaievska’s release was greeted across Ukraine due to her longstanding reputation as a veteran medic who has trained the country’s volunteer medical force.\n\nShe founded a group of medics called Taira’s Angels and had served as a contact point between the military and civilians in front-line towns.\n\nPaievska recorded more than 250 gigabytes of her team’s efforts over two weeks to save the wounded, including both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nShe transferred the clips to an Associated Press team, the last international journalists in Mariupol, one of whom fled with it embedded in a tampon on March 15.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 16:30 GMT\n\nGermany to increase use of coal to conserve natural gas\n\nGermany will restart coal-fired power plants in order to conserve natural gas, the country’s economy minister has said.\n\n“To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,” the economy ministry said in a statement.\n\nRobert Habeck, the minister for economic affairs and climate action, said bringing back coal-fired power plants was “painful, but it is a sheer necessity”.\n\nThe move was part of a series of measures, including new incentives for companies to burn less natural gas, announced by Germany as Europe takes steps to deal with reduced energy supplies from Russia.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 15:26 GMT\n\nUN in Ukraine calls for accountability for sexual violence\n\nThe United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, has said that Russia’s war on Ukraine has been marred by incidents of conflict-related sexual violence.\n\nIn a statement, Lubrani said that the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has verified cases of sexual violence against both women and men in Ukraine.\n\n“Due to active hostilities, mass internal displacement, the stigma associated with sexual violence and the breakdown of the referral pathways, survivors are often unable or unwilling to report to law enforcement authorities or service providers,” she said.\n\n“We reiterate that conflict-related sexual violence is a crime under international human rights and humanitarian law,” Lubrani added.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 14:48 GMT\n\nItalian FM accuses own party of undermining Ukraine support efforts\n\nItalian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio has accused his own Five Star Movement party of undermining government efforts to support Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nThe internal party feuding also creates problems for Prime Minister Mario Draghi as he faces an important vote in parliament on Tuesday over Ukraine, with some Five Star members looking to limit Italy from sending further weapons to Kyiv.\n\nItaly, like many EU countries, has been dispatching arms to Ukraine to help it battle the Russian invasion.\n\nIn a statement, Di Maio said the government had to defend the values of democracy and freedom, adding that while everyone wanted peace, Russian President Vladimir Putin was pursuing war.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 14:19 GMT\n\nJapanese airline to change logo featuring letter ‘Z’\n\nThe Japanese low-cost carrier Zipair Tokyo has said it will ditch its logo featuring the letter Z, a pro-war symbol often seen on Russian military vehicles, to avoid misunderstanding, the Japan Times reported.\n\nThe president of the subsidiary of Japan Airlines Co told reporters at Narita Airport near Tokyo that some people might see the current logo – painted on the vertical tail of its B-787 planes – as indicating the company approves of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“I think some people might feel that way when they see it without any explanation,” Shingo Nishida said.\n\nThe new logo will be a geometric pattern in green, black and white, the company said.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 14:02 GMT\n\nUN food agency cuts rations for refugees in east and west Africa\n\nThe UN World Food Programme (WFP) has said it has been forced to reduce food rations for refugees in east and west Africa due to a surge in demand and insufficient funding.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has had a worsening impact on the global refugee crisis and heightened the risk of famine, as it drove up the price of commodities, especially grain.\n\nThree-quarters of refugees in east Africa supported by the UN programme have seen their rations reduced by up to 50 percent, WFP said, with those in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda the worst affected.\n\n“We are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley.\n\n19 Jun 2022 - 11:18 GMT\n\nRussia says eastern attack is going well\n\nRussia says its offensive against Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine is proceeding successfully after it took control of a district on the outskirts of the city.\n\n“The offensive in the Severodonetsk direction is developing successfully,” Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a video statement.
