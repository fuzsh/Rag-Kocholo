        "text": "The present work gives researchers schematic biographic articles about top-level clerks of general administration in the Kingdom of Poland of the unification era, governors . Dynamically-developing research into Russian administration in the Kingdom of Poland needs to be supported with comprehensive directory investigations. This has been, precisely, our aim in the present work, namely, to collect biographical data for a dictionary of governors in governorates of the Kingdom of Poland of the unification era, which denotes the years 1867-1918 for local administration. Due to the fact that the liquidation of the Kingdom’s autonomy was a long-lasting process, the initial chronological boundary must only be tentative. This period is opened up by the January Uprising, during which military rule was introduced , which, in fact, greatly limited the freedom of operation of civil administration. At the same time, key posts were manned by people from outside the Kingdom. Finally, the decision was taken on liquidating the autonomous government, which was supposed to be a part of the process of the Kingdom’s unification with the Russian Empire.\n\nCustoms administration always played a highly significant role for the Russian Empire since it controlled revenue collected from the Western land border of the Empire. Most of all, it was crucial for the state budget. This is a sufficient reason to investigate customs administration and its local authorities – customs district chiefs. Until 1851 the Kingdom of Poland had been an independent customs area, separated by the border from the rest of Russia. The induction of Russian administration into this territory was a considerable organisational challenge, which is why we focused on this part of the border. The present book is another contribution in our research into the history of bureaucracy, putting together administration history and social history. The positions of customs district chiefs are presented in the perspective of the whole system of customs administration, together with its origin and detailed changes taking place in the researched period. Focusing on a human person in the bureaucratic apparatus enables one to better understand both his significance for administration and the specific nature of the clerical body. This is the reason why the bionotes contain so much data on ancestors, siblings, spouses and children of the examined persons. In general, we believe that examination of the clerical elite should be conducted with the use of a variety of methods: biographic, genealogic and prosopographic ones. The extent and format of bionotes should address fundamental questions related to circumstances of candidates’ promotion to the social status and the clerical post as well as their social and political significance, which arise as an interrelation of their preferences and higher-level authorities’ policy.\n\nThis article examines the demography of the Jewish population of the Russian Empire and the USSR for the period from 1897 to 1626. This period was one of the key ones in the history of Russia. Fundamental changes in the history of the Jews of the Russian Empire occurred already with the outbreak of the First World War. From 1917 Jews were granted equal rights with other citizens of the country. Wars, disease, famine and terror have reduced the Jewish population. The article examines the statistics of the loss of the Jewish population.\n\nThis article analyses sex ratios in late nineteenth – to early twentieth-century Russia focusing on the easternmost frontier of its European part – Perm Province with a population of about 3 million. High sex ratio at birth, in infancy, and childhood has been widely used to assess gender discriminatory practices in several countries, including some European ones. Russia is usually depicted as highly patriarchal with a low social status of women, always subordinated to their fathers and husbands. However, little has been done to study sex ratios. This article presents the first long-term research on sex ratio which relies on county (uyezd)-level information from the 1897 Russian census and the first Soviet 1926 census as well as the household censuses of 1887, 1900, and 1912. The authors also used local statistics based on the parish records with vital events. Additionally, they computed the sex ratios in different groups from birth to age at marriage, their dynamics over almost 40 y...\n\n“Schism is maintained by women”. Specificity of sex and age structure of Old Believed population in Kharkov province (1825–1917) The paper is devoted to the study of age and sex structure of Old Believed population in Kharkov province in the period from 1815 to 1917. It is argued that the predominance of women among registered Old Believers in the Russian Empire as a whole can be attributed to the concealment of the faith among Old Believers. Due to the features of female mentality and division of labor according to gender women more rarely veiled their adherence to the Old Belief. The scale of the concealment of the faith by the Old Believers of the Kharkov Province was less than one in the central regions of Russia. That is why the proportion of women among the Old Believers of the Kharkov Province was less than one in Russia as a whole. Sex-ratio of registered Old Believed population in Kharkov province during the period from 1815 to 1917 was influenced by several factors: the changes of statistics, dynamic of correlation of the quantity of secret and registered Old Believers and migrations. Based on data of Russian Imperial Census in 1897 the age pyramid of Old Believed population in Kharkov province is very wide in the basis, indicating high birth and death rates. It is similar to the one of the whole population of Kharkov province and typical for the traditional society. Key words: Old Belief, demographics, sex-ratio, age pyramid, statistics, Kharkov province."
