        "text": "Estimated Net Worth: $400 million\n\nCelebrity Net Worth’s valuation of Jackie Chan puts him equal with a host of other stars including Brad Pitt, Jack Nicholson, Bill Cosby, Jennifer Lopez, Mark Wahlberg, Sylvester Stallone, and Tom Hanks. But the 69-year-old martial arts legend was the second highest-paid actor in the world as recently as seven years ago.\n\nChan is best known in the U.S. for his roles in comedic action films like the Rush Hour series and Shanghai Noon (2000). He also owns a chain of cinemas in China and has launched his own clothing line and food products.\n\nLearn More about Jackie Chan\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $425 million\n\nMel Gibson, 67, made $25 million for each of his roles in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), The Patriot (2000), Signs (2002), and We Were Soldiers (2002). But those totals pale in comparison to his profits from the 2004 biblical film The Passion of the Christ, which Gibson produced and directed.\n\nWith Gibson receiving half the film’s profits, he took home $300 million from ticket sales alone. Merchandise and DVD sales bumped the total up at least another $100 million.\n\nIf not for a $425 million divorce settlement with ex-wife Robyn Moore in 2011, he’d be much higher on the list.\n\nLearn More about Mel Gibson\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $440 million\n\nAdam Sandler, 56, is one of the most successful comedians of all time, parlaying a spot on Saturday Night Live into a lucrative movie career. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he has earned at least $20 million from 20 of the major studio films he has appeared in. His production company, Happy Madison, has also made a number of highly profitable movies.\n\nNetflix and Sandler have agreed to two separate deals, in 2014 and 2020, covering four films each for the streaming service, with the second contract worth around $275 million.\n\nLearn More about Adam Sandler\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $450 million\n\nIn addition to acting or voicing characters in hit films like Ride Along (2014), The Secret Life of Pets (2016), and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017), Kevin Hart remains busy as a touring stand-up comedian and businessman.\n\nThe 44-year-old has endorsements with companies like Samsung, Wrangler, AT&T, and Mountain Dew, and in April 2022, received a $100 million investment from a private equity firm into his media company HartBeat. With the added money, his stake in the company became valued at more than $550 million.\n\nLearn More about Kevin Hart\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $450 million\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, 75, was once the most in-demand action star in Hollywood, appearing in films like the Terminator franchise, Predator (1987), and Total Recall (1990). At his peak, the Austrian bodybuilder-turned–movie star earned $20 million to $30 million per movie.\n\nThe former governor of California and one-time member of the Kennedy family has extensive commercial and personal real estate portfolios that are believed to be worth more than $100 million, as well.\n\nLearn More about Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $500 million\n\nGeorge Clooney has earned plenty of money through alcohol sales. In 2017, the actor and partners Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman sold their tequila brand Casamigos to Diageo for $700 million up front and as much as $300 million more based on future performance.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, the 62-year-old has also made $40 million through a partnership with Nespresso and earned movie salaries worth as high as $20 million, like in the 2001 film Ocean’s Eleven.\n\nLearn More about George Clooney\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $500 million\n\nThe star of classic films such as Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), and Goodfellas (1990), Robert De Niro is still a presence on the big screen with 2023 roles in About My Father and Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nBut you might not know the 79-year-old is a successful restaurateur, too. In 1994, he co-founded the first Nobu with celebrity chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa. Today, they have more than 50 restaurants located around the world that make hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n\nLearn More about Robert De Niro\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $500 million\n\nThey haven’t appeared onscreen together since 2004’s New York Minute and are retired from acting, but the Olsen twins, 37, were just about everywhere growing up.\n\nWhile Ashley and Mary-Kate were acting on the TV sitcom Full House, production company Dualstar Entertainment Group was founded in their name in 1993. The pair began starring in a series of direct-to-video and TV movies and the occasional big-screen project. They became presidents of Dualstar upon turning 18.\n\nThey’re also successful fashion moguls, with their brand, The Row, sold in luxury department stores like Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nLearn More about Ashley Olsen\n\nLearn More about Mary-Kate Olsen\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $500 million\n\nEllen DeGeneres built her bankroll with the success of her daily talk show The Ellen Degeneres Show, which ran from 2003 through 2022. According to In Touch, she earned $60 million per year off the program during its later seasons.\n\nThe 65-year-old comedian has also made millions flipping houses with wife Portia de Rossi.\n\nAs for comedy, her 2018 Netflix special, Ellen Degeneres: Relatable, banked $20 million. Add in earnings from her early TV projects and acting roles in films like Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016), and Ellen has had quite the lucrative career.\n\nLearn More about Ellen DeGeneres\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $600 million\n\nTom Cruise, 61, has come a long way from early film roles like 1983’s Risky Business, for which he earned only $75,000.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Cruise earned $100 million for each of his roles in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) and the sci-fi thriller War of the Worlds (2005).\n\nAlthough he took a much lower paycheck for his latest film, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One, Variety reported that Cruise will earn a significant percentage of its first-dollar gross. That means his net worth should get a nice boost from the summer blockbuster.\n\nLearn More about Tom Cruise\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $600 Million\n\nShah Rukh Khan, 57, is one of the most successful Indian actors of all time, appearing in more than 80 Bollywood films. His most recent is the 2023 thriller Pathaan.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Khan, who has more than 39 million Instagram followers, makes anywhere from $50 million to $80 million per year and earns as much as $35 million per film.\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $800 million\n\nWhile The Rock commands a hefty salary for his film roles, earning a reported $22.5 million for 2022’s Black Adam and $50 million for the upcoming Amazon Studios movie Red One, Dwayne Johnson greatly profits through other business ventures.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, the 51-year-old has a 30- to 40-percent stake in Teremana Tequila, the brand he launched in 2020 with ex-wife Dany Garcia and other partners. It’s estimated he could earn as much as $1 billion pre-tax from the product.\n\nJohnson also has valuable endorsements with companies like Under Armour, Ford, and Apple.\n\nLearn More about Dwayne Johnson\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $950 million\n\nDespite being a “show about nothing,” Jerry Seinfeld’s eponymous sitcom continues to be a huge moneymaker for the actor and comedian.\n\nAfter going off the air in 1998, Seinfeld generated as much as $400 million each syndication cycle for its co-creator and writer. Then in 2019, Netflix reportedly paid more than $500 million in a five-year deal for the rights to the show.\n\nSeinfeld has profited from his stand-up as well, with the 69-year-old still touring and Netflix paying $20 million for his 2020 special 23 Hours to Kill.\n\nLearn More about Jerry Seinfeld\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $1 billion\n\nAlthough other estimates are around $800 million, Forbes has listed 53-year-old Tyler Perry among the world’s billionaires for the past three years.\n\nPerry is best known for creating the Madea franchise, which has grossed more than $660 million according to Forbes.
