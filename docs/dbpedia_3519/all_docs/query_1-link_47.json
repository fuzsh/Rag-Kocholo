        "text": "An early songwriter for Amy Grant, he helped make contemporary Christian music a commercial force. In 1988, his song “Awesome God” was a mega-hit.\n\nLater albums were influential. He died in 1997 at age 41. Reading up on singer-songwriter Rich Mullins, I find vagueness and strangeness around his personal life. Never married, no girlfriends. Androgynous.\n\nI wondered if he was gay.\n\nIf that was true, his entire value to the Christian demographic would depend on it being suppressed.\n\nTricky. I might need an angel to whisper in my ear?\n\nI kept researching, and was watching a 2014 documentary, Rich Mullins: A Ragamuffin’s Legacy. I paused the player, backed up, watched again.\n\nAmy Grant said it again, exactly the same way.\n\n“He was, you know, very— Um. Honest about his— Everything from his sexuality, to his appetites to his— He was just so raw.”\n\nThat’s not a very Christian way to be.\n\nShe recalls once being at a radio station, and people there asked her to talk about the “real” Rich Mullins. She threw out some “shocker stories”—without repeating them.\n\nShe adds: “Everybody in the radio station was very conservative and they kinda withdrew, and dropped the subject. And I thought: ‘You wanted to really know him.’”\n\nI hear back from Reed Arvin, Mullins’ longtime producer.\n\n“He was the most authentic poet in the history of contemporary Christian music, a truth-teller in the best sense, and a true believer in Christ. I’ve never met anyone who so thoroughly conformed his life to the image of Christ, which, naturally, made him an outlier in many ways. I have no idea if Rich was gay or trying not to be gay. I do know that on the spectrum of ‘things that matter about Rich Mullins,’ his sexuality rates about 90th.”\n\nBut it might explain his whole life.\n\nThere’s been three documentaries and a biography.\n\nThe biography, An Arrow Pointing to Heaven by James Bryan Smith, is billed as a “devotional biography.” That seems to mean lots of unrelated discussions of Christian theology are included amid thin biographical details. I email Smith asking if he can supply any evidence to disrupt a gay reading of Mullins’ life. I don’t hear back.\n\nI think about the often uncomfortable interviews in the documentaries, and sentences that abrubtly terminate.\n\nIn Rich Mullins: A Ragamuffin’s Legacy, his friend Mitch McVicker says: “Resignation and longing are his two major themes, according to him, in his songs. And those wouldn’t be there if he wasn’t—”\n\nMitch pauses, and adds: “The messed up pile of stuff that he was.”\n\nTo learn about Rich Mullins, there’s always Rich Mullins.\n\nAsked to speak about “grace” on a 1996 radio show, he’s back in his childhood on a farm in rural Indiana:\n\n“When I was young, I was angry and I was kind of going, ‘God, why am I such a freak? Why couldn’t I have been a good basketball player? I wanted to be a jock or something. Instead I’m a musician. I feel like such a sissy all the time. Why couldn’t I be just like a regular guy?’”\n\nIn 1997, Mullins was interviewed, and again was back in his difficult youth:\n\n“From my junior year of high school until age thirty I felt tormented all the time. I was depressed. I just think I have that sort of personality.”\n\nHe adds there was “more than ten years of darkness where I felt tormented all the time.”\n\nHe was the eldest son—but not the son his father wanted.\n\n‘Wayne’, as he was called at home, was horrible at farm work. He was musical. His mother, Neva Mullins, recalls in a 1984 interview: “We went to see the movie Music Man when he was just a child. He came home and pecked out the songs he’d heard on our old upright piano.”\n\nSmith quotes Neva reflecting on her husband: “John’s generation of men did not express their feelings to their children.”\n\nWhich isn’t true. John Mullins expressed disappointment. He was famous for saying: “I have two sons, two daughters, and a piano player.”\n\nThe ‘romance’ seems to have largely taken place at Cincinnati Bible College.\n\nMullins’ early song “Seminary Girl / Seminary Boy” may be a glimpse of Ann Bartram, though I take it to be a satire on the Evangelical culture of compulsory marriage.\n\nAfter ten years and two break-ups, Mullins was glad to be free of her. That’s the story of “Damascus Road.” The lyrics evoke a scene in the life of the Bible’s apostle Paul — the moment when he is blinded, and newly able to ‘see’ spiritually. The apostle was famously unmarried.\n\nThe song is best known to Mullins fans from a 1995 recording, but exists as a demo of 1984, and the demo, I notice, had another stanza:\n\n“And when I finally found you, Lord, you took all those illusions away\n\nI give my life to sing your praise\n\nI wanna stay with you forever Lord, don’t let me go\n\nNow that I know you why would I ever want to go?”\n\nIf written after a break-up then this would have Mullins saying he “finally” lets go of the idea of marrying. The “illusions” would be the idea that that he has to be married to a woman to be a good Christian.\n\nHe’s remembered in school for being weird .\n\nMullins was given to talking about Jesus as a human man, capable of an erotic relationship. His messiah was a “lover,” and he’d go on about being “ravaged” by the divine. He grew his hair out. “His dad did not like it at all, and sometimes they fought about it,” his mother says.\n\nHis college friend Beth Snell Lutz recalls in a recent interview: “He had a lot of darkness in him. There was a constant wrestling for him.”\n\nThat kind of talk is constant around Rich Mullins. In the 1998 Homeless Man documentary, future bandmember Rick Elias says:\n\n“Rich’s appetite for sin was probably greater than even my own. But his pursuit of God and his decision to embrace God far oughtweighed his appetite for sin.”\n\nWhat this ‘appetite’ was is never explained.\n\nMullins had a band called Zion.\n\nWith funding from a non-Christian uncle, he released an album, Behold the Man. The track “Heaven in His Eyes” might warrant attention, but “Praise to the Lord” was the standout. A praise song, it leaps from Bach’s Prelude & Fugue №2 in C Minor into a sonic extravaganza too exciting to be really Christian.\n\nIn the 2017 book, Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth, Amy Grant remembers first hearing it. She writes: “I have been moved by a lot of songs, but when that song reached its iconic release point, I was levitating.”\n\nIt became “Sing Your Praise to the Lord,” her first big hit.\n\nThe song should be read as a sexual experience.\n\nIn a 2019 analysis of “Awesome God,” the Christian scholar Nathan Myrick has an interview from Michael Blanton, head of Reunion Records, recalling Mullins talking about the song‘s long introduction.\n\n“Well, it’s just like sex. You’ve gotta have a really good foreplay before you get to the climax.”\n\nThe song, Blanton thought, presented Christianity as “our love relationship with God,” with “some foreplay and then a wedding…”\n\nBut what kind of sex would this be? There are no gender references.\n\nIn Rich Mullins: A Ragamuffin’s Legacy, a friend recalls going to Nashville with him to help get him into the music biz. An industry gatekeeper, Jon Rivers, took her aside and advised her that Mullins had talked about “friends in Cincinnati,” and said he was in for a bumpy ride.\n\nAmy Grant brought him back to the public eye.\n\nMullins was the opening act for her Unguarded tour, as she opened with his song, “Love of Another Kind,” which she’d covered for her Unguarded album. Her version is about her special love for Jesus:\n\n“The love I know is a love so few discover.”\n\nThe song seems to have been written around 1984. On YouTube, there’s a few recordings of Mullins performing the song around 1987, with a distinctly Elton John-like flourish, and different lyrics. Instead of a “love so few discover,” Mullins sings: “I feel you’re closer than a brother.”\n\nThe song was sung to a man.\n\nThe title “Love of Another Kind” feels very queer. In 1977, the Christian author Richard Woods tried to define a positive gay Christian identity in the book Another Kind of Love.\n\nMullins’ first album flopped.\n\nHe’d describes it as an album “that nobody bought and that no one would play on the radio.” His second album, Pictures in the Sky also didn’t produce any hits. Neither album was overtly ‘Christian’.\n\nHis career in music seemed over. Reed Arvin once noted: “I sometimes think about how different my life would be if Rich hadn’t played me a certain rough cassette tape in 1988.”\n\nLet’s read the “Awesome God.”\n\nThe opening line of the song has been a challenge for Christian listeners.\n\n“When He rolls up His sleeves He ain’t just puttin’ on the Ritz…”\n\nThe “Ritz” language evokes Irving Berlin’s song “Puttin’ on the Ritz,” but perhaps more specifically the 1982 novelty cover by Taco, the flamboyant Dutch singer, as it was a staple on MTV. Taco seems not to have commented on his sexuality, but one would think: ‘very gay’.\n\nA few lines down in “Awesome God,” Mullins nails down this theme:\n\n“Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom\n\nMercy and grace He gave us at the cross”\n\nIt looks like “Awesome God” is about a deity with a long record of eliminating homosexuals. In 1987–88, the context was clearly AIDS.\n\n“Awesome God” is a monologue by a Southern Baptist preacher.\n\nRich’s brother David Mullins recalled being told it was written in the voice of this character. For the 2006 book 100 Greatest Songs in Christian Music (where “Awesome God” was #1), David Mullins is quoted:\n\n“He said he was thinking about Southern preachers, the kind that say short sentences, real strong. So he rolled his window down and started yelling these statements into the night, trying to stay awake.”\n\nAs Mullins seems averse to Southern Baptist theology, one can only wonder why he was writing in this voice. On the verge of being a commercial failure, was he trying to pander to the Christian public?\n\n“Awesome God” made him a star, and was his only work the Nashville music establishment ever liked. An unnamed executive, quoted by Nathan Myrick, called him “a weirdo with one good song.”\n\nHe was close with a younger man named Beaker—who later refused all interviews.\n\nAs in the video for Mullins’ 2006 song “Here in America,” the Evangelical world got a nice portrait of two men frolicking around the world.\n\nTheir relationship was close enough to be expressed as a love song.\n\nThat’s how Mullins himself sets it up in some talk between songs at a 1996 concert. He says:\n\n“Because, you know how hard it is for guys to tell each other they love each other? We’re just, we’re so homophobic that we can’t even be honest. So I really wanted to tell Beaker I loved him. So I wrote this really stupid song for him that I thought was kind of funny. And I included a woman’s name, because my audience is so homophobic, that if I wrote a song for a guy they would stop buying my records, and let’s face it, I gotta make a living.”\n\nThe song, from 1991, was “What Susan Said,” an odd story about “two lonely-eyed boys in a pick-up truck.” Their skin is “sweaty,” as they’re “together” — and feeling “lost.”\n\nThey keep returning to the line:\n\n“…love is found in the things we’ve given up”\n\nBut many Rich Mullins songs can be read as ‘queer’.\n\nConsider his hit “Creed,” which might seem just a list of Christian beliefs. But Mullins places unusual emphasis on those beliefs as defining himself.\n\n“And I believe what I believe is what makes me what I am”\n\nIf Mullins was a closeted gay man, then he’s saying his belief makes him Christian—despite the sexuality which would cause many Evangelicals to define him otherwise.\n\nIn 1992, Rich and Beaker were in a hotel room in Amsterdam.\n\nMullins told the story many times. Hoping Beaker would fall asleep, he thought to slip out into the city and do some unspecified illicit activity.\n\nMullins fans have often generated a storyline that the problem was pornography as viewed in hotel rooms of the time. But he speaks of planning to go out into the city to do it.\n\nHe stayed awake in anticipation, as he narrates in 1994:\n\n“After years of behaving myself as best as I could, I was really having to hang on for dear life. I was thinking, no one would know. I could do anything I wanted to do. Wouldn’t it be fun just to cut loose for a couple nights and misbehave as much as I want?”\n\nThe nature of the ‘misbehavior’ wasn’t specified. Unsure that Beaker was asleep, Mullins never left. He adds: “But I sure felt the temptation to toss out my morals for an evening.”\n\nThese tellings don’t suggest the intensity of the resulting song. “Hold Me Jesus” has a narrator all but destroyed by unnamed yearnings. It’s “so hot inside my soul,” he sings to God, as he prays for the power to ‘surrender’, rather than “fight you for something I don’t really want.”\n\nMullins had a big insight into the “nature” of his temptations.\n\nAt a train station, Mullins tells Beaker the story of the dark night of temptation in the hotel room. I’m transcribing:\n\n“Well Beaker and I were talking in a train station about the whole thing, kinda where we were and where we wanted to be, and we got into some, actually, some pretty explicit detail about the nature of our temptations and of those struggles. And this guy leans over…in the train station, the only other guy in there, and he says, ‘Excuse me, but are you Rich Mullins?’\n\nSo I had to think back over our conversation to see if I was or not, and decided that I must be. Whether or not I like who I am, that is who I am.”\n\nThat this language so closely echoes his song “Creed” (released in 1994) as to really suggest he had intended that song to be a coded coming out.\n\nHe was often the subject of gay gossip.\n\nIn 2021, a CCM insider posted a comment on Reddit about gossip surrounding various stars of the genre. As he writes: “‘Rich Mullins might be gay!’ ‘So?’ ‘Ray Boltz is gay!’ ‘So?’”\n\nBut his devoted fanbase remained oblivious. A blog post from 2014 speaks to Mullins’ appeal in his heyday:\n\n“Rich Mullins was the Holden Caulfield of our faith: the one guy who refused to be phony. The one guy who refused to play the game. The one guy who questioned the status quo in a music industry often driven by image and sales. The one guy who made faith seem real rather than cliché to Gen-Xers hungry for something authentic.”\n\nMullins himself, in contrast, discussed the period in terms of his phoniness.\n\nIn September 1995, he’s interviewed by the Arizona Republic:\n\n“There are times when I know that the overwhelming motivating factor for me is the acceptance and the applause of the audience,” he says. “So you feel like a total phony because you’re up there talking about all this great, grand stuff and you’re going, ‘The filthy truth is I’m saying this because they will clap.’”\n\nHe left his career to go back to college.\n\nHis odd story was that he wanted to teach music at a Navajo reservation in New Mexico. He told people that he was going to Friends University to get a degree to teach music, though such a certification wasn’t required.\n\nAt Friends University, Mullins met James Bryan Smith, his future biographer, who was a professor at the school. Smith notes in the 2014 documentary that he often did Mullins’ homework. He didn’t mention that in his biography. He also didn’t mention in the book a scene he told the New York Times in 2022.\n\nMullins stopped one day, Smith recalls, and said: “I want to be friends and you need to know the worst.”\n\nSmith adds that the conversation, “the details of which he will never share, was immensely difficult.” He adds that the conversation concerned what he called “dark seasons of sin” in Mullins’ life, and that he will never reveal what Mullins told him.\n\nMullins seemed to be making some kind of horrifying confession around the time.\n\nIn a 2016 podcast interview, his friend Ben Pearson recalls Mullins showing up one evening and asking to go on a ride around town.\n\n“He was pretty angry that night at God,” Pearson says. “While we’re driving around I’m waiting for the lightning bolts to hit. Rich is being very honest. I’m like, ‘Oh God, please help us. Jesus help me.’”\n\nPearson’s delivery is comic, but the impression is of some confession far outside the norm. I write him at his website asking if he could say that Mullins was not discussing gay issues. No reply.\n\nAmy Grant narrates a scene of someone telling her something very deeply distressing\n\nIn a September 1997 interview, the friend is left unnamed but might have some Mullins-like suggestion. This is what she says:\n\n“I let down a friend who was going through a really difficult time. I couldn’t deal with the situation so I disappeared. A while later I came back and said I was so sorry. I just didn’t know what to say or do. I had been so overwhelmed. My friend looked at me and said: ‘I didn’t need your answers, Amy. I needed you — your arms around me.’”\n\nThe idea of holding and being held might suggest “Hold Me Jesus,” which Amy would later cover and call her favorite Rich Mullins song.\n\nI write Amy’s management asking if she would say if this person was Mullins, and if she could confirm he had AIDS. I don’t hear back.\n\nIn 1994, Mullins gave a lecture on ‘Christian living’.\n\nLong shelved until dug up by fans, it turned out to be a bizarre performance, full of unexpected personal disclosures. He was in college at the time, and yet speaks of going to the movies a lot. He says:\n\n“I really have to watch or I would go to a movie constantly and never do homework, never make my bed. If they showed movies at 8 in the morning I would get up and go. It’s the only excuse I can think of for getting up in the morning.”\n\nHe chatters about his non-existent love life. “Most women who get to know me do not want to marry me,” he says. “My life does not play out like my albums do. It’s even worse than my music.”\n\nHe had a love song once on an album, he says. It was his producer’s idea. He doesn’t write them. “I don’t have a lot of occasions to do that.”\n\nHe is likely referring here to a hypothetical romance that feels oddly inserted into his 1991 song “The River.”\n\n“Maybe she could come to Wichita\n\nAnd maybe we could borrow Beaker’s bike”\n\nHe adds that he does write songs about his actual life, but throws those songs away, since they’re “my own business,” and “my own personal therapy going on here. There’s no reason to burden listeners with that.”\n\nThe result, he says, is people think his albums are about him. “I kinda go, ‘Wow, these albums don’t address some of the real central issues of my life.’ And I have some real hang-ups.”\n\nHis albums are illusions, he says.\n\nHe chatters on. “The truth is you know what I have chosen for you to know. I have shown you my absolute best side.”\n\nThat was another strange thing to say. His songs are full of personal darkness: loneliness, with suggestions of a drinking problem—especially after Beaker got married and moved to Atlanta.\n\nTake Mullins’ 1995 song “Wounds of Love,” with him singing to a distant, unnamed, ungendered person…in Atlanta.\n\n“The bottle is still so full\n\nThere’s no one here to turn the tap\n\nSo much in me wants to reach out and hold you\n\nBut you’re so far away I can’t do that…”\n\nMullins was well-known for being ‘messed up’ and ‘screwed up’.\n\nIn various blog posts I’m finding notes about him that emphasize his disordered self. One writes:\n\n“Telling ‘Rich was messed-up’ stories is rather like breaking into an AA meeting and saying, ‘Ha HA! You’re all alcoholics! Gotcha!’”\n\nAnother comments:\n\n“I was always blown away with how he could smoke then sing beautifully, cuss then write profoundly.”\n\nMullins’ friend Kathy Sprinkle shows up in a range of pages. She writes:\n\n“He was a walking contradiction, wasn’t he? I guess that is true for all of us, but we decide to hide it rather than celebrate our humanness.”\n\nA woman noted in a comment that she’d briefly met him.\n\n“He casually mentioned in the car ride that he dealt with depression and I was a bit surprised at his transparency at that time.”\n\nIn 2007, the Christian musician Shaun Groves leaves a memoir in a comment that is a bit startling.\n\n“He had a foul mouth, quirky irreverent stage presence at times and despised elements of American culture and politics, and often had as hard time liking those he played music for, yet he possessed a deep love of liturgies, creeds, silence, solitude, prayer, mercy, children, and Jesus and he kept, making music for us no matter how much we perplexed him. This paradox confounded and still does.\n\nThis man pooped his pants during a concert and then cleaned up in the church bathroom afterward (long afterward) using the soiled boxers he’d worn and tossed them in the church trash can like they were a tissue. He got stoned drunk and sobered up just in time to play ‘Awesome God’ for a bunch of Baptists in Texas. He wrote a song about a homeless man he met with a colostomy bag — the song compared the American Church to this colostomy bag: ‘full of shit,’ he said. It never got recorded. He sent all his royalties to charity and paid himself a teacher’s salary and he never knew how much he’d actually made from all that music he made us. He didn’t smell good, look good, or act good a lot of the time. Rich was, well, just weird. Very weird.”\n\nIn 1995, Mullins moved to New Mexico.\n\nThough often said to be a missionary effort, he discouraged that idea.\n\n“If you don’t love your neighbor where you live, you’re not going to love them in another place,” he told the Greenville News. “I just happen to like this region, and so my neighbors are going to be Navajo.”\n\nHe’d acquired a new special younger male friend in a fellow student, Mitch McVicker—or as Mullins says, “just this basketball player who happened to be in this religion class I was in.”\n\nIn all, five young men from the college went down to New Mexico with him, with the idea to create a sort of spiritual community, the ‘Kid Brothers of St. Frank’ as Mullins and Beaker had called it, after Francis of Assisi.\n\nMullins did concerts, and phone interviews with regional newspapers. Unnoticed at the time, they now seem darkly revealing. He chats with the Indianapolis News in 1995:\n\n“Everybody struggles. If people knew the stuff I struggled with, they would hate me . . . I do the best I can. I have failures and I don’t think Christianity is less true because I’m not an exemplary Christian. What I want to communicate to people is what I think is at the heart of the gospel, which is that God loves us.”\n\nA young reporter spends a week in New Mexico, doing a profile.\n\nToday, Lou Carlozo doesn’t like any talk of Mullins and same-sex intimacy, but notes of their few days together: “I slept with Rich Mullins—in the same way I slept with my kid brother as a kid.”\n\nMullins tells him, in the profile, that he isn’t sure why he’s ducking out of his career. “I don’t know if I’m afraid of success; I might be,” he says. “I can make records for the rest of my life and talk about love, but it won’t mean anything until I love somebody.”\n\nWhy is he on the reservation? He replies: “For me, it’s much more to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling.”\n\nIt’s fine if his celebrity fades. “If it continues, that’d be fine,” he says. “If it doesn’t, that’d be fine. I’ve had more than my 15 minutes.”\n\nIn a 1997 interview, Mullins tells a story about his dad.\n\nIt’s a curious narration. Mullins is recalling that “a friend of mine” had been a youth pastor—realizing he was gay and was “in crisis” about it. He decided to tell Mullins’ dad for some unstated reason.\n\n“He was going, ‘Gosh I feel like I’m a phony because I, you know, I go to church and I tell kids all this stuff.’”\n\nPresented with this news, Mullins continues:\n\n“…my Dad said, ‘You need to decide what’s most important to you and do it. You can’t do everything. And uh, you know what the Bible teaches and uh, decide if you can live with the Bible or if you can live without it.’”\n\nIs this Mullins telling his own story? I go back and re-read the ‘secret sin’ interview, when ‘God’ said to him:\n\n“Yes, what you do makes me sick too, but what you are makes me sicker. You do what you do, because you are what you are.”\n\nWas that God—or his dad?\n\nHe worked as a music teacher on the reservation.\n\nThe story he told about quitting the school was that it was fundamentalist Christian, and he wasn’t. “And I can respect that,” he said. “We both agreed that I don’t really need to be there right now, just because I don’t get fundamentalists, and I don’t really know that I want to be stuck with a bunch of ’em.”\n\nIn a 2014 blog post, Melody K. Anderson, the daughter of a well-known Christian author, recalls spending a week visiting a Christian school in New Mexico in March 1995. She was at first unaware of the identity of the man wearing shorts on a snowy day.\n\n“He seemed uncomfortable, nervous, distracted, and out of place.”\n\nMullins’ musicality was magical, but something was wrong. “Rich seemed ill-suited in his own skin and misplaced on the planet,” she writes. When she later hears of his death, she adds, “my first reaction was relief.”\n\nToward the end, there was a wasting.\n\nAs Jeremy Klaszus observes: “In his last months he looked like hell — haggard with big bags under his eyes. A man passing through. He seemed almost to know what was coming.”\n\nMullins explained his worn appearance as from being so long on tour. In photos, his body shape changes rapidly from overweight to frail.\n\nPeople came to interview him to ask about the key questions of life. Like how does he, a super duper Christian, manage to live among Native Americans? “The same way I dealt with living in Middle America,” he replies. “I think most Middle-American beliefs are in direct conflict with the scriptures.”\n\nIn March 1997 he says: “I really came here more to try to get beyond my white, middle-class Protestant upbringing and see life through a different lens.”\n\nFor years he spoke of converting to Catholicism.\n\nIn a 1994 interview he talked up the Pope as an important religious voice: “You know, at least this guy has some credentials.”\n\nAt the same time, he did also self-identify as a religious outsider. He explains in 1988:\n\n“I take comfort in knowing that it was the shepherds in whom the angels appeared when they announced Christ’s birth. Invariably throughout the course of history, God has appeared to people on the fringes.”\n\nHe was also the speaker the Evangelical world turned to for ‘outsider’ views on key subjects, like homosexuality. In June 1997, CCM did a feature on AIDS and quoted him: “It seems like the church has picked homosexuality out to be the ultimate evil thing, and I’m just not always sure that it is.”\n\nHis music was widely rejected by Evangelicals.\n\nHe remained well-known and with admirers, but after “Awesome God,” the thrill was wearing off. In a 2016 reflection on her earlier working experience as a Lifeway Christian store clerk, Jennifer Cooke (who became Amy Grant’s manager) writes about her feeling then that “his songs were too focused on the human condition and not focused enough on Jesus as the answer.”\n\nIn the Evangelical mindset of the time, she adds, “each song really needed to be able to be neatly wrapped up in a ‘Jesus is the answer’ bow.”\n\nThe difficult, jagged, elusive Mullins spirituality wasn’t working.\n\nMullins was clearly very unwell.\n\nIn a 2018 interview, an associate, Chuck Harper, recalled that Mullins “was getting really exhausted. He was having stomach problems. He was weaker.”\n\nSeveral friends in Rich Mullins: A Ragamuffin’s Legacy have vague updates. One of his young bandmates recalls: “He was real, real tired. Real tired.”\n\nAnother friend recalls:\n\n“He called me out on the porch and he said, ‘You know all these things we’ve been dreaming about doing — I’m not going to be able to do these things.’ He said, ‘My health has been bad.’ He said, ‘I don’t what’s going on or why, but I just know I’m not going to be able to do this.’”\n\nOne friend says vaguely: “There was something going on beyond him that he couldn’t control, something greater.” No explanation.\n\nThis problem seemed to threaten to cut short all his ongoing plans. Another friend recalls Mullins saying: “I don’t have time to get everything done, and that’s part of why I’m so crazy right now.”\n\nIn his final months, his concert banter got edgier.\n\nHe’s speak of his anticipation of resurrection. “I’ll have no bags under my eyes. I’ll have a jaw line, biceps, the whole works. I’ll be a jock. Either a jock or a fife player, I haven’t decided which.”\n\nThat a 41-year-old Christian man was so focused on his death seems to have passed largely without notice. On April 11, 1997, he was giving a performance in the chapel of Wheaton College. He dismisses Christian music. “If you really tuned into that stuff all the time, it would warp you.”\n\nHis own fans only knew part of his music. “The grim stuff doesn’t sell well,” he says. Then he’s back in his childhood. “I think I was raised Christian, but once I left home I began to find out how un-Christian my family was.”\n\nTapping out background music, he’s Kierkegaard at the piano:\n\n“We live in a time when we have come to believe that there are answers. I don’t know why we believe that. Even more worrisome is: I’m not even sure why we ever came to believe the questions are all that important.”\n\nHe dismisses academic treatments of the faith.\n\n“Christianity is communicated the same way diseases are. It’s communicated through touch, through breath, through life, not through information.”\n\nHe was saying he would be disappearing.\n\nA church friend who is interviewed in the Ragamuffin documentary recalls Mullins calling and saying plans for work on the reservation were being dropped: “My health has been bad. I don’t know what’s going on or why. I just know I’m not going to be able to do this.”\n\nIn the later interview for the documentary The Work You Began: The Last Days of Rich Mullins, Harper adds that Mullins had called him outside for a private talk. As he puts it, Mullins says: “I’m not going to be able to finish all the stuff we were wanting to do.”\n\nHarper protested that Mullins would surely be able to record, no matter where in the world he went. Mullins said:\n\n“No I don’t know what it is. I’m not going to be able to carry out all these things that we’ve talked about. But I will be able to fund it.”\n\nHarper quotes him again:\n\n“I don’t know if I’ll be in the States. I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t even know if I’m going to keep recording music. Just some things have changed.”\n\nIn September 1997, Mullins and crew stayed at the home of young Caleb Kruse.\n\nKruse remembers the three week visit in a 2016 memoir, Meeting Rich. He hadn’t at first recognized Mullins, he recalls, who explained his haggard appearance: “We’re doing a couple things right now, which is why we look really tired.”\n\nCaleb writes: “When he spoke, he was polite. Almost even shy.”"
