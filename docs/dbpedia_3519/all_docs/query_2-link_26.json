As Toni descends deeper into the girls’ world, the lingering nostalgia for her brother’s guidance fades away. We witness the joy of her first friendships and her discovery of dance. Yet, she grapples with her individual identity amid her newly defined social sphere. At its heart, “The Fits” is a meditation on movement as seen from the perspective of teenage girls, juxtaposing the precise, powerful, and intentional movements of drill with subconscious, spontaneous, and uncontrolled movements of collective hysterics. “The Fits” was developed and produced through the Venice Biennale Cinema College, and had its World Premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2015.\n\nRooftop Films showed The Fits during the 2016 Summer Series.\n\nRooftop Films and TCS Camera Grant\n\nTechnological Cinevideo Services has been the rental home for world-famous professional motion picture equipment for more than 30 years.

Using an out-of-sync polyphonic audio track with a uniquely beautiful slow motion video component creates a break in the viewer’s conciseness which invites them to participate in the film in a similar way one would when reading a novel. Allah said, “This film is an herbal and spiritual take on Jamaica told from the inside out. It is an intimate quest of Faith through the mind of Jamaica’s rarest, most remote inhabitants: the Maroons. Throughout the film the question will be raised as to “what’s the answer?” The answer to the problems of poverty, crime and governmental negligence that plague the country.”\n\nBlack Mother screened during the 2018 Summer Series.\n\nRooftop Films and Eastern Effects Equipment Grant\n\nEastern Effects is film production rental house based in Brooklyn.

Wolkstein and Radcliff said, “We want to create a film where a seemingly simple story gives way to multiple possibilities, and where objective truth is a perpetually elusive thing. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the brothers relationship may not be what we think, and the trip may hold disturbing implications. The characters are of the type that we consistently find intriguing—those who find themselves navigating complicated emotional terrain, who lie as easily as they tell the truth, and keep their secrets hidden.” Wolkstein and Radcliff plan to shoot the film in the summer of 2016.\n\nRooftop Films showed The Strange Ones during the 2017 Summer Series.\n\nRooftop Films and Edgeworx Post-Production Grant\n\nEdgeworx Studios is a post-production house based in Manhattan.

This feminist speculative fiction is a loose variation of Grimms’ Hansel and Gretel and presents coming-of-age as a supernatural process. The film will be shot in Germany in April 2016.\n\nRooftop Filmmakers Fund Short Film Grants\n\nWe believe that short films do not receive the attention they deserve in the world of film, and that all too often even a festival which prominently includes short films does little for the filmmaker in the long run. For the short film grants, Rooftop Films earmarks one dollar from every regularly-priced ticket sold and every submission fee received for the Filmmakers’ Fund. Every year, filmmakers whose movies have screened at Rooftop Films are eligible to apply for grants for their future productions.

For the short film grants, Rooftop Films earmarks one dollar from every regularly-priced ticket sold and every submission fee received for the Filmmakers’ Fund, dispersing grants up to $3,000. The 2013 recipients are:\n\nRiley Hooper | The World’s Longest Yard Sale\n\nNow in its 26th year, the world’s longest yard sale runs from Michigan to Alabama the first weekend of every August. It’s a massive exchange of not only goods, but also cultures, customs, ideas, and narratives. Riley Hooper’s short documentary focuses on objects being sold and bought along the route of the sale to reveal personal stories about the people buying and selling them — universal stories of family histories, love, loss, nostalgia, and the human experience.
