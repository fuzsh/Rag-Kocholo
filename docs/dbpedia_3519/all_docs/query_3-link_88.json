        "text": "01 of 13\n\nChristina Ricci (Young Roberta)\n\nA 15-year-old Christina Ricci earned one of her first feature film credits for 1995's Now and Then. After making her debut in 1990's Mermaids and rising to fame in The Addams Family (1991), she played a young Roberta Martin in this coming-of-age movie. The counterpart to Rosie O'Donnell's adult character, young Roberta is a leader among her friend group. Raised in a family of boys after the death of her mother, she starts the film less than eager to be going through puberty.\n\nNow and Then was just the beginning for Ricci, who now has Golden Globe and Emmy nominations to her name. The former child star continued her big-screen career with 1998's The Opposite of Sex, 2003's Monster, and 2008's New York, I Love You.\n\nRicci also picked up television work, making appearances on Malcolm in the Middle, Ally McBeal, and Grey's Anatomy, and starring on ABC's short-lived series Pan Am, the buzzy Showtime drama Yellowjackets, and the Netflix hit Wednesday.\n\n02 of 13\n\nRosie O'Donnell (Roberta)\n\nSharing the role with Ricci, O'Donnell played the adult version of Roberta Martin, who finds a career as an OBGYN and is in a steady relationship with her boyfriend. O'Donnell added Now and Then to a filmography that already included A League of Their Own (1992), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), and The Flintstones (1994).\n\nSoon after Now and Then hit theaters, O'Donnell kicked off a six-year run on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. She also booked gigs in 1996's Harriet the Spy and 1998's Wide Awake, and hit the small screen with roles on Queer as Folk, Nip/Tuck, and The Fosters, in addition to her work cohosting The View.\n\nOther television credits include I Know This Much Is True, American Gigolo, and the A League of Their Own series on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n03 of 13\n\nThora Birch (Young Teeny)\n\nJust 13 years old at the time of Now and Then's debut, Thora Birch joined the flick after booking late-'80s roles on Day by Day and Doogie Howser, M.D., and in 1993's Hocus Pocus.
