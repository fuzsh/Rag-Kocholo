        "text": "Arthur Hastings Grant, The Grant Family: A Genealogical History of the Descendants of Matthew Grant of Windsor, Conn., 1601-1898 (Poughkeepsie, N. Y.: Press of A. V. Haight, 1898).\n\nMatthew Grant, b. Oct. 27, 1601; d. at Windsor, Dec. 16, 1681; m. (1) Nov. 16, 1625, to Priscilla _____ [d. at Windsor, Apr. 27, 1644, aged 43 years, 2 months]; m. (2) at Windsor, May 29, 1645, to Susanna (Capen or Chapin) Rockwell [b. Apr. 5, 1602; d. at Windsor, Nov. 14, 1666; widow of Deacon William Rockwell; probably daughter of Bernard Capen].\n\nOn March 20, 1630, he embarked with his family on the “Mary and John” at Plymouth, England, and reached Boston harbor May 30, 1630. He settled at Dorchester, Massachusetts, and was admitted a freeman May 18, 1631; but, with many others, he disliked the close union of church and state that characterized the colony of Massachusetts Bay, as well as the growing tendency to establish the government in the hands of a privileged class and to minimize the voice of the people in the conduct of their own affairs. Accordingly, in Oct. 1635, he went overland to the Connecticut River, with the party that prepared for the settlement of Windsor, although his family probably did not remove to Windsor until the following April. There, freed from the trammels of a royal charter, he assisted in forming a true democracy, the germ from which American political institutions have grown. His lot was in the Palisado, next the town lot. This he gave to his son John, with whom he spent his declining years. It is said that he was a carpenter. He was the first, and for many years the principal, surveyor; deacon of the first church; recorder (town clerk) 1652-77; townsman (selectman) many years, frequently receiving the highest number of votes; on the committees to lay out the bounds between Windsor and Hartford in 1651 and 1660, and to view the state of the town in 1651 and 1654. The absence of records makes it impossible to give a complete list of the offices he held, but he was one of the important men of the town. Of him Dr. Stiles says, in his History of Ancient Windsor: “Few men, indeed, filled so large a place in the early history of Windsor, or filled it so well, as honest Matthew Grant; his name figures in almost every place of trust, and the early records of the town show that his duties were always conscientiously performed.” In 1654 he compiled “A Book of Records of Town Ways in Windsor.” He was also the compiler of the “Old Church Record,” which has furnished the basis for the histories of most of the families of ancient Windsor. He was a type of the best settlers of New England, and left to his descendants an untarnished name and the example of an unswerving fidelity to the public trusts committed to him, for he quaintly comments on his own work: “I have been careful to do nothing on one man’s desire.”\n\nChildren of Matthew Grant and Priscilla _____\n\nPriscilla Grant, b.

W. Tompkins [son of Rachel Maria Grant and William Tompkins] writes as follows: “I will mention the tradition fondly dwelt upon and oft-times related by his children Susan, Margaret, Roswell, Jesse and Rachel that Noah Grant participated in the original ‘tea-party’ in Boston harbor in 1773. The watch, a large silver ‘bull’s-eye’ worn by him on that occasion has been an heirloom in our family, passing at my mother’s death to my brother Charles. I have often heard my mother relate her narrow escape from drowning when the family was moving to Maysville, Ky., in a ‘keel boat’; she fell overboard and was rescued with great difficulty. She had to walk four miles through the woods to school, and sometimes the Indians who were then near Maysville would overtake her and lift her upon their horses, asking if ‘papoose wanted a ride.’ My father had the distinction of being the first man on this continent, and perhaps in the world, to utilize natural gas in manufacturing. In 1841, while he was running a salt well 1200 feet in depth, suddenly the well gram, a structure 75 feet high, was blown to pieces and caught fire from the sudden ebullition of gas that escaped in vast volume, frightening the workmen, and inspiring them with the belief that they had reached the region where ‘the fire is never quenched.’ But he, taking a more practical view, succeeded in smothering the fire with wet blankets and earth, and piping the gas to his furnace nearby used it to boil salt water for many years very successfully and at vast reduction in cost. At that place (Burning Springs, W. Va.) Washington when a young surveyor discovered gas on the surface of a spring, and finding that it ignited easily deeded one acre to the State of Virginia as a natural curiosity.”Click here for the children of Noah Grant\n\nSusannah Grant, b. at Coventry, about 1750; d. at Coventry (probably Aug. 16, 1821, aged 70)A beautiful woman; became insane at age 18, and remained so until a short time before her death.\n\nPeter Grant, b. at Coventry; d. unmarried at sea.
