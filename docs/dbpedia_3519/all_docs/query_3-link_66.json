        "text": "This time, Rebus is set in contemporary Edinburgh, with Outlander star Rankin playing a younger version of the detective, who finds himself being drawn into a violent criminal conflict after discovering that his younger brother Michael, a former soldier, is involved with the underworld.\n\nSpeaking about Rankin's performance, RadioTimes.com's review said: \"He's entirely believable as someone who is trying to do the right thing and be the best possible version of himself for his daughter and ex-partner, for whom his love has never wavered.\"\n\nBut who else joins Rankin in the cast? While we await more news on season 2, read on for everything you need to know about the Rebus cast and who they play.\n\nMore like this\n\nRebus cast 2024\n\nThe full list of cast members is as follows:\n\nRichard Rankin as John Rebus\n\nBrian Ferguson as Michael Rebus\n\nLucie Shorthouse as Siobhan Clarke\n\nAmy Manson as Rhona Moncrieffe\n\nMia McKenzie as Sammy\n\nStuart Bowman as Ger Cafferty\n\nNeshla Caplan as Chrissie Rebus\n\nAidan Connell as Michael Rebus Junior\n\nCailean Galloway as Liam\n\nThoren Ferguson as Malcolm Fox\n\nNick Rhys as Lockie Moncrieffe\n\nAndrew John Tait as Neil Mackenzie\n\nCassidy Little as Gary 'Cammy' Campbell\n\nCaroline Lee Johnson as Gill Templer\n\nSean Buchanan as George Blantyre\n\nMichelle Duncan as Maggie Blantyre\n\nNoof Ousellam as Darryl Christie\n\nTerence Rae as Andy Rolland\n\nGilly Gilchrist as Jimmy McJagger\n\nAston McAuley as Shaun Strang\n\nSéamus McLean Ross as Jack\n\nCraig Mclean as Kai\n\nPatrick O'Brien as Davey Mathieson\n\nRyan Hayes as Alan Fowler\n\nAmi Okumura Jones as Kirsten\n\nMelissa Collier as Andrea Thomson\n\nFor more information about the characters and where you've seen the actors who play them before, read on.\n\nRichard Rankin plays John Rebus\n\nWho is John Rebus? A detective sergeant working in Edinburgh. Rebus is divorced and he shares a young daughter with his ex-partner. He's also an alcoholic and is wrapped up in a toxic affair.\n\n\"[Writer] Greg [Burke] uses the Scottish word 'thrawn' to describe someone who makes life as difficult as possible for themselves,\" said Rankin. \"A martyr to his own cause. Frequently faced with easier choices, Rebus will take the difficult path.\n\n\"As for the job, Rebus has the potential and aptitude to be a great detective, and in a lot of ways he is, but he gets in his own way often deliberately, often self-destructively.\"\n\nWhat else has Richard Rankin been in? He's best known for time travel romance saga Outlander. You might also have watched him in Scottish sketch show Burnistoun, and BBC dramas The Syndicate, Thirteen, The Replacement and Trust Me.\n\nLucie Shorthouse plays Siobhan Clarke\n\nWho is Siobhan Clarke? A detective constable who works alongside Rebus.\n\n\"They're seemingly very different in terms of attitudes, approaches, and who they are in life but they work very, very well together,\" said Shorthouse. \"She's someone who challenges Rebus in certain things as well. She is slightly intimidated by him, but not willing to compromise the integrity of her job.\"\n\nRankin recently commented on his character and Siobhan's relationship, telling RadioTimes.com: \"John is supposed to be mentoring Siobhan, I think he kind of reluctantly takes her on board – I’m not going to say accepts, because he doesn't really. Because Siobhan's from the fast track, I think he sees that as coming along with inexperience and no real street smarts.\"\n\nHe added: \"He starts off being quite cold towards her, which gives us a lot of room and a long way to go with that relationship. It has its ups and downs, but you can tell that it certainly has the makings of what will become quite a close relationship.\"\n\nWhere have I seen Lucie Shorthouse before? You might recognise her from police procedural Bulletproof. She's also appeared in comedies We Are Lady Parts and Henpocalypse.\n\nAmy Manson plays Rhona Moncrieffe\n\nWho is Rhona Moncrieffe? Rebus's ex-wife. They share a daughter, Sammy (Mia McKenzie), but Rhona has since remarried.\n\n\"I think at the beginning of this series, Rhona is intent on keeping a solid family dynamic,\" said Manson. \"So that means that she is just intent on getting her ex-husband and her new husband to get along for the sake of her child.\n\n\"Rebus irks her at times just because he is who he is. But at the same time, he's her daughter's father, and Rhona's core value system is family. She'll do anything to make that work.\"\n\nWhat else has Amy Manson been in? Her CV includes Netflix's Bodies and sci-fi drama The Nevers.\n\nStuart Bowman plays Ger Cafferty\n\nWho is Ger Cafferty? An Edinburgh gangster who has a \"violent encounter\" with Rebus at the beginning of the show, which is set one year earlier.\n\nSpeaking about the dynamic between the two men, Bowman said: \"From the outset we see the complexity of their relationship and their love for one another and their hatred for one another. There's a morality that they're questioning throughout everything that they do.\n\n\"In many ways, I think Cafferty is clearer about his morality than Rebus is and is more comfortable with the choices he's made.\"\n\nWhere have I seen Stuart Bowman before? His credits include historical drama Versailles, BBC comedy-drama Guilt, Jed Mercurio's Bodyguard and Scottish sitcom Gary Tank Commander.\n\nBrian Ferguson plays Michael Rebus\n\nWho is Michael Rebus? Rebus's brother. The pair have a strained relationship. Michael was a soldier for 22 years, but has since turned to crime to deal with his mounting bills.\n\nOn the relationship between the duo, Ferguson said: \"They have quite an antagonistic relationship. I think this is very familiar, particularly among working-class men. The only way that brothers know how to express their love for each other is through aggression. We sense that there's a real love there, but they have no idea how to communicate that to each other really.\"\n\nWhere have I seen Brian Ferguson before? He's had roles in the ITV reboot of The Ipcress File and historical drama The Spanish Princess.\n\nNeshla Caplan plays Chrissie Rebus\n\nWho is Chrissie Rebus? Michael's wife. They have two teenage sons, Michael Rebus Junior (Aidan Connell) and Liam (Cailean Galloway). When Michael leaves the army, he sets up a business with Chrissie, but the pandemic then hits, followed by the cost of living crisis, and eventually the business fails, leaving them broke.\n\nWhere have I seen Neshla Caplan before? She's had roles in Prime Video's The Rig and Scottish mockumentary series Scot Squad.\n\nRead more:\n\nRebus star: 'Reboot is a response to books, not faithful adaptation'\n\nRebus author Ian Rankin says reboot is \"a tough watch at times\"\n\nThoren Ferguson plays Malcolm Fox\n\nWho is Malcolm Fox? He works for Professional Standards. Malcolm's got his eye firmly on Rebus.\n\nWhat else has Thoren Ferguson been in? You might know him from Emmerdale.\n\nNick Rhys plays Lockie Moncrieffe\n\nWho is Lockie Moncrieffe? Rhona's new husband. He's a fund manager and extremely wealthy. In the past, Lockie and Rebus have clashed, and while their antagonism appears to have eased, there's still palpable dislike there.\n\nWhat else has Nick Rhys been in? He's best known for Hollyoaks and Irish soap River City.\n\nAndrew John Tait plays Neil Mackenzie\n\nWho is Neil Mackenzie? A friend of Michael's from his army days who helps him out with his criminal scheme.\n\nWhat else has Andrew John Tait been in?
