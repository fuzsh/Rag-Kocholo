        "text": "Are you a researcher that wants to address a research problem so ambitious, that can not be dealt with you and your team alone? The Synergy Grants could be for you!\n\nWho can apply?\n\nA group of two to maximum four Principal Investigators (PIs) working together and bringing different skills and resources to tackle ambitious research problems. One will be designated as the corresponding PI (cPI).\n\nNo specific eligibility criteria regarding the academic training are foreseen for ERC Synergy Grants.\n\nPIs must present a competitive track record as appropriate to their career stage.\n\nProposals are evaluated on the sole criterion of scientific excellence which takes on the additional meaning of outstanding intrinsic synergetic effect.\n\nWhat proposals are eligible?\n\nCriteria\n\nApplications can be made in any field of research.\n\nThe ERC's grants operate on a 'bottom-up' basis without predetermined priorities. In the case of the ERC Synergy Grants, applications must demonstrate that the proposed research cannot be carried out by a single PI working alone.\n\nLocation\n\nResearch must be conducted by all PIs in a public or private research organisation (known as a Host Institution, HI).\n\nIt could be the HI where the applicant already works, or any other HI established in one of the EU Member States or associated countries.\n\nOne Principal Investigator per Synergy Grant group at any one time can be hosted or engaged by an institution outside of the EU or Associated Countries.\n\nHost Institution (HI)\n\nPIs can apply within the same HI or through different HIs.\n\nWhere the different PIs may be hosted by more than one HI, each of these HIs shall offer their support to the PI(s) hosted by them for the duration of the grant.\n\nAt submission stage, all Host Institutions must provide the host support letter for their Principal Investigator(s).\n\nThe ERC Synergy Grant is awarded to the cHI that engages and hosts the cPI for at least the duration of the grant, and to any other HI that engages and hosts other PIs participating in the project.\n\nThe host institutions must engage the PIs for at least the duration of the grant and must offer appropriate conditions for PIs supported to independently direct the proposed research and manage the project's funding for its duration.\n\nThe PIs do not necessarily need to be working at the HI indicated in the proposal at the time when it is submitted. However, a mutual agreement – called supplementary agreement – and the host institutions' commitment on how the relationship will be established are necessary, should the proposal be successful.\n\nTeam\n\nERC Synergy grants support projects carried out by a group of two to four individual researchers who can employ researchers of any nationality as team members.\n\nIt is also possible to have one or more team members located in a third country.\n\nVacancies for team members interested in joining an ERC led research project can be published on the Euraxess-Jobs portal.\n\nUK’s participation in Horizon Europe\n\nThe European Commission and the United Kingdom have reached a political agreement on the UK's participation in Horizon Europe, the EU's research, and innovation programme. Read more\n\nHow much?\n\nSynergy Grants can be up to a maximum of € 10 million for a period of 6 years (pro rata for projects of shorter duration).\n\nHowever, an additional € 4 million can be requested in the proposal in total to cover eligible “start-up” costs for researchers moving from a third country to the EU or an associated country and/or the purchase of major equipment and/or access to large facilities and/or other major experimental and field work costs.\n\nAn ERC grant can cover up to 100% of the total eligible direct costs of the research plus a contribution of 25% of the total eligible costs towards indirect costs.\n\nHow to apply?\n\nERC grant applications can only be submitted in response to a Call for Proposals.\n\nThe ERC yearly has calls for proposals covering all scientific fields.\n\nFor an ERC grant application to be complete, it needs to include the administrative forms, the research proposal and the supplementary documents. The completed proposal should be submitted by the specified closing date.\n\nCalls are published on this page, the EU Funding & Tenders Portal and in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nStep by step\n\nBefore the call is published:\n\nFind out which ERC grant and which call is suitable for you\n\nThink who could be a suitable PI to complement your expertise to best address the complex and ambitious research question\n\nEach PI should identify their Host Institutions. The portability applies to each PI.\n\nIdentify further team members you would like to work with and justify their presence in the project (see also the online research partner search services).\n\nThe written consent of any researcher mentioned in the proposal as participating in the project is required\n\nAfter the deadline:\n\nThe ERC checks whether your proposal meets the call’s eligibility criteria\n\nExternal experts evaluate all the eligible proposals\n\nAbout 4-5 months after the call deadline, you receive a letter from the ERC informing you on the result of the first step evaluation\n\nAt each of the three steps of the evaluation process you get feedback about the results\n\nOnce the call is open:\n\nRead the call related documents, such as the ERC Work Programme and Information to Applicants to the Synergy call\n\nElaborate the research idea together with the other PIs, making sure that besides the research goals the synergetic aspects are considered as well\n\nContact the host institution and gather all the details you need for the application\n\nStart writing your proposal. Work tightly with the other PIs and allow time for others to review the draft proposal. Your NCP, peers and other scientists can all give you helpful support and feedback\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the EU submission service. This is the online system through which proposals must be submitted (see also the online guide to using the proposal submission service and the Online Manual)\n\nSubmit your proposal as early as possible well before the deadline.\n\nDeadlines cannot be changed.\n\nYou can update your submitted proposal any time before the deadline by simply submitting a new version, which will overwrite the old one. Do not leave the submission of the proposal to the last day as you may encounter unforeseen difficulties.\n\nYou will get an ‘acknowledgement of receipt’ by e-mail for each submission.\n\nContact the National Contact Point (NCP) in your country for support or contact the Synergy applicants' mailbox: erc-syg-applicants@ec.europa.eu\n\nHow does the evaluation process work?\n\nA single submission of the full proposal is followed by a three-step evaluation, including interviews.\n\nSynergy evaluations will be unique, fit for complex projects and without predefined panels.\n\nProposals are evaluated by selected international peer reviewers who evaluate proposals on the basis of excellence as the sole criterion.\n\nIt applies to the evaluation of both the research project and the Principal Investigators, taking into account the synergetic aspects of the proposed research.\n\nPanel Members are selected by the ERC Scientific Council on the basis of their scientific reputation.\n\nStep 1: the extended synopsis and the Principal Investigators’ track-records and CVs will be assessed (and not the full scientific proposal)\n\nStep 2: the complete version of the retained proposals will be assessed\n\nStep 3 Principal Investigators will be invited for an interview to present their project to a panel in Brussels and the most competitive of the retained proposals will be identified\n\nComposition of the evaluation panels\n\nThe composition of the panels in each step is not predefined. The step 1 panel is formed from approximately 90 panel members and chairs.\n\nFive to seven panels in step 2 will be formed in a dynamic way after the step 1 filtering to ensure the best expertise for the retained proposals. The step 2 panels will be composed using the step 1 panel members, grouping them into panels of comparable size.\n\nAt step 3, the interview panels may be reconfigured to ensure the best expertise for the proposals.\n\nIn addition to the panel members, who act as 'generalists', the evaluation relies on the input from experts external to the panel, including remote evaluators. They are scientists and scholars who bring in the necessary specialised expertise, but they are not participating at the panel meetings.\n\nThose who pass the quality threshold at step 3 - scored 'A' - are ranked. Depending on the call budget available, a budgetary cut-off applies to the ranking list and only the highest ranked proposals are offered an ERC grant until the call's budget has been exhausted.\n\nAfter the call opening, the names of the panel chairs are published on the ERC website. Similarly, the names of panel members are also published.\n\nApplicants are requested not to contact reviewers under any circumstances as they risk having their proposal rejected from the evaluation. See all evaluation panels\n\nSearching for data on ERC funded projects and proposals?\n\nYou can use two different platforms for views and analysis of ERC funded projects and evaluated proposals.\n\nERC dashboard\n\nThis dashboard allows you to:\n\nFilter by multiple criteria: Refine your search by funding scheme, country, year, panel, and more\n\nExport data: Export results and graphs data for further analysis and presentation\n\nDiscover how to use the ERC dashboard with the quick start guide\n\nERC Research Information System (ERIS)\n\nERIS provides advanced features to analyze research data:\n\nRich filters: Apply filters on any available data field for more precise searches\n\nText mining: Use text mining capabilities to uncover patterns and insights\n\nDynamic visualizations: Access a variety of visual tools, including interactive word clouds and clustering tools\n\nProject outputs & bibliometrics: Search and view comprehensive data on project outputs and bibliometrics\n\nExport data: Export results and graphs data for further analysis and presentation\n\nInterested to learn more?"
