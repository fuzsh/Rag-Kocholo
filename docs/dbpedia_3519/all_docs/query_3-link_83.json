        "text": "Michael Teo is one of the main antagonists of the Crazy Rich Asians book series.\n\nHe is the secondary antagonist of Crazy Rich Asians, a major antagonist of China Rich Girlfriend, and a supporting antagonist of Rich People Problems.\n\nHe is Astrid Leong's ex-husband and father to her son Cassian Teo.\n\nBackground[]\n\nMichael is a former Army technology specialist turned businessman and entrepreneur. He first caught Astrid's eye when she saw him at a fashion show modeling a speedo, much to his own embarrassment. They later meet again and are instantly attracted to one another, with Astrid calling him later the same night, and him immediately inviting her to his apartment, where it is implied they sleep together.\n\nAfter his marriage he struggles to gain acceptance into her family due to his humble background, but after the success of his business (later revealed to be a result of Charlie Wu, Astrid's former boyfriend) he becomes more respected in the family.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMichael was first introduced as a miserable and tired, but otherwise caring husband and father who only wants the best for his wife and son.\n\nHowever, after his business becomes successful (due to the secret investment of Astrid's former lover Charlie Wu), Michael's personality shifts dramatically, and he becomes a highly self-centered and controlling husband.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians[]\n\nNovel[]\n\nMichael is unhappy with his marriage to Astrid due to him constantly being looked down upon by his old-money in-laws. He fakes an affair in Hong Kong in an attempt to get Astrid to divorce him, which initially succeeds before Astrid uncovers his duplicity. They eventually reconcile by the end of the book with the intervention of Astrid's former lover Charlie Wu, who wants Astrid to be happy.\n\nFilm[]\n\nAstrid leaves him after discovering him having an affair with a mistress. Unlike in the novel, Michael in the movie is actually having an affair.\n\nChina Rich Girlfriend[]\n\nMichael's tech start-up booms to success, which is actually due to Charlie Wu's secret investing in the company in order to help Astrid save her marriage. However, success changes Michael's personality and makes him more tyrannical and controlling, eventually leading to Astrid leaving him with their son Cassian.\n\nRich People Problems[]\n\nMichael conspires with Charlie's ex wife Isabel to ruin Astrid's reputation and tries to extort money from her in their divorce settlement. He finally agrees to sign the divorce papers when Charlie Wu threatens to reveal what he has done to the police.\n\nTrivia[]"
