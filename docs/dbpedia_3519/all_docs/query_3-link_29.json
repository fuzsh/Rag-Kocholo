        "text": "Leung eventually became known for his epic works with Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-wai, having won best actor at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in In The Mood for Love.\n\nMeanwhile, Lau – praised for his matinee idol-like looks and diligence in his work – has earned a Guinness World Record for having the most awards won by a male Canto-pop artist.\n\nThe actors enjoy continued success to this day and are recognised for their great contributions to Hong Kong cinema. Ahead of their much-awaited reunion, we examine their lifestyles and net worths so far.\n\nTony Leung: living away from the limelight\n\nFamously known as one of Asia’s 25 Greatest Actors of All Time as heralded by CNN, Leung is a gem who tends to keep his sparkle away from the spotlight.\n\nThe living legend – who reportedly makes an estimated US$7 million per film, according to Today Online – keeps a relatively low profile. In August 2021, Hong Kong media spotted Leung in the Central district, wearing casual clothes and a mask, and he was practically unrecognisable.\n\nOne of his last splurges, a rare one for himself, was a Mercedes-Benz convertible he bought as his birthday present, which reportedly cost US$380,000.\n\nOther than his earnings from acting projects, Leung is also known to have increased his wealth through real estate.\n\nAndy Lau: a family man who spoils his kids\n\nWith nicknames that include “The King of Heaven” and “Box Office Champion”, Lau is known for his multiple talents, gaining fame as a Canto-pop singer, actor and film producer.\n\nHe holds an estimated net worth of up to US$70 million. Lau reportedly earned US$3.4 million for Infernal Affairs, per CMGM. Following the film’s success, his salary is said to have been raised to US$4.6 million by the time he reached Infernal Affairs 3. He’s collected up to 50 properties in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and the United States which all contribute to his net worth. The star also has an eye for luxury cars, and owns an Audi SQ5 TFSI and Toyota Vellfire, per INF News.\n\nA true family man, Lau makes sure that his family is well looked after. According to a report by AsiaOne, when his Malaysian-Chinese wife Carol Chu was pregnant with their child, Lau bought two luxury houses along Jalan Ampang, a major road in Kuala Lumpur to reside in during her confinement period and for when family members would visit.\n\nWhen Lau’s daughter Hanna was born in 2012, Lau shielded her from the public – but chose to share a little bit about his cherished family life when she turned three years old. In 2015, Lau carried his baby and held his wife with his other hand, saying, “I want to introduce my two darlings to everyone,” reported Luju Bar.\n\nLau eventually bought a private jet so that his wife and daughter could travel safely and in private. For Hanna’s fourth birthday, the doting dad bought her a mansion located in Kadoorie Hill, Hong Kong, worth over an estimated US$26 million, per Yahoo."
