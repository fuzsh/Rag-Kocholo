        "text": "In my family, there’s no distinction between The Godfather and theology. We are encouraged to study the movies for signs and portents and use its plot points and aphorisms as a life guide. When offering exegesis on a particular scene, we are, in the way of scholars, to refer to GF1, GF2, or the non-canonical GF3. Because of the films, we know to never let anyone outside the family in on what we’re thinking, to keep our friends close but enemies closer, to control our women when they get out of hand on the dance floor. (If we don’t, someone else will.) On many occasions, as I was leaving the house, my father called me back, saying, “Sit with me and watch The Godfather and learn something. Your brother, he’s a lot like Sonny. He’s a good son but emotional. A good son, but not necessarily a good don.”\n\n“What about me. Who am I like?”\n\nThis was me being weak, fishing for compliments, expecting, as the youngest brother, to be compared to Michael. “You,” my father would say, eyes on the screen. “You are like Fredo. You’ve got a good heart.”\n\nLike millions of Americans, I’ve long been infatuated with Francis Ford Coppola, director of those movies. I love many of his films—The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, The Outsiders—but The Godfather is special. The Godfather is the Bible of American Life, the story of our grandparents who fled Poland and Russia and Ireland and wherever in just the way Vito Corleone fled Sicily. The particulars were different, but the violence was the same, the crossing, and hope, and promise of the New World. Meeting Coppola would be like meeting the scribe who wrote the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, which tell the story of King David, a story The Godfather seems to mimic and elaborate on. For what is young Michael Corleone, the overlooked baby brother who suddenly finds himself battling a crooked monster cop, but young David with his slingshot and pebble? And what is old Michael Corleone, the black heart who puts a hit on his own brother, but old King David, who has sinned and must be punished. I’ve tried to meet Coppola time and again, but he does not talk much to reporters. A few months ago I finally got my chance. Of course, by the time I’d managed it, he was old, a lion in winter, at work on perhaps his final film. In the way of old men, he’s got a keen interest in real estate, particularly his vineyards and resorts. In fact, in preparation for the interview, he wanted me to visit one of his proudest possessions, the Palazzo Margherita, in Bernalda, Italy. After I’d lingered in the rooms of the hotel and walked the streets of that tiny, sunstruck hilltop town, we’d talk.\n\nAdam and Eve and the Old Don\n\nThe Palazzo turned out to be the perfect place to prepare for my rendezvous with Coppola. In many ways, the resort and the town seem to be in dialogue with The Godfather, especially GF2. The shadows, the winding cobblestone lanes, the way many streets end at a cliff—immortality, death—the surprisingly blue skies; the men at sidewalk tables, beneath awnings, sitting over porcelain cups filled with coffee as black as tar and as intense as anisette, the drink Johnny Ola asks for when he sits with Michael in Nevada to discuss “the Jew in Miami”; the high-ceilinged rooms—they go for as much as $1,950 a night—the villa itself, which Coppola purchased from a pair of elderly sisters; the arches that lead to the enclosed garden where Sofia Coppola married Thomas Mars, of the band Phoenix, and which is said to be the only 19th-century Italian-style garden in Basilicata, a wild region of Southern Italy once filled with brigands—it’s all straight out of the movies. Coppola’s Uncle Anton, last of his generation, said he expected to see Adam and Eve in that garden, but most of us will be on the lookout for the Old Don, cutting an orange peel into fangs, chasing his grandson through the tomato plants in those last happy moments.\n\nThere’s a big room on the second floor that doubles as a theater. I sat there one afternoon and watched GF2, in which Vito returns to Corleone, Sicily, to fulfill a vendetta. Watching it in this place was strange. It was like being a Jew at the Western Wall, a Muslim making the hajj, or a Cubs fanatic at Wrigley Field. I’d reached the navel of the world, passed through the screen into the backstory. Coppola wanted me to visit partly because the Palazzo says much about him, partly because it needs publicity. These days, it’s not the movies but the hotels and wines that fund the private jet and make the nut. The Palazzo is a gem, but there’s no standard touristy reason to visit. Bernalda is not Fiesole, nor Como. It’s an hour from any major airport, adjacent to no famous cathedral or ruin. The countryside is beautiful but poor. So, how to fill the joint? Obvious. This is Godfather Fantasy Camp, where the pilgrim gets closest to the holy emanation.\n\nFulfilling a Vendetta\n\nI met Coppola in Rome. He was staying at the Ruspoli Palace, once the home of Napoleon III. His room was up a broad flight of marble stairs. The door to it was like I imagine the door in Kafka that leads to the Law, ornate and huge and probably made from a tree that stood in the time of Jesus. Inside, I found Coppola in a pink bathrobe—initials on the lapel—showing lots of leg and chest hair, thickly bearded and bedheaded, reeking of jet lag as he circled a silver room-service tray. He shook my hand. The thickness of his palm surprised me. He’d been an accomplished musician as a kid, but this was less the grip of an artist than of a stevedore. Of course, he was not a flutist like his father but a tuba player, which has always been a preserve of the large-boned. There is, in fact, something bearish about Coppola, messy and warm. He sat on an antique bench beneath a window. He crossed his legs at the ankle, but his knees fell apart and his robe gapped open. He’d have been a great doctor. His presence puts you immediately at ease. He smiled as he talked, looked into the distance, laughed. He’s interested in immigrants, origins. Many of his films are set in far-flung places. Yet he remains a purely American character.\n\nHe wanted to know what I thought of the Palazzo.\n\nI asked how he’d come to buy the place.\n\nIt turns out that Bernalda is the town his grandfather left early in the 20th century for America. Agostino Coppola had been a machinist and, as such, knew the Palazzo only as the home of aristocrats. He possibly had an affair with a maid in that house, thus entered not via grand front door and foyer but trellis and window. “My grandfather was very charismatic, and, although he died when I was five, I remember him vaguely,” Coppola told me. “He was always talking about Bernalda bella. It was almost like a fairy tale to me. When I was 21, I got to go to Europe working in low-budget movies and I found myself in Yugoslavia and realized that Italy was right across the Adriatic. I put my car on a ferry and drove to Bernalda. No one in my family had gone back, not the grandfather, not the uncles. I was the first. I went to this little village and I couldn’t speak Italian. I could say 10 words, you know, and I said, ‘I’m Francis Coppola, grandson of Agostino Coppola—did anyone know him?’ And this old lady said she was a prima cugina, a first cousin.” She took him home, introduced him around. “Then it was getting late and I said, ‘Is there a hotel somewhere?’ And they said, ‘No, no, you’re going with the sposi.’ Sposi means wedding couple; they’d just gotten married. In the bedroom there were all the gifts, and there was one bed. The husband comes out in pajamas and goes to the bed and says, ‘Signore Franco.’ I realized I’m going to sleep with the husband. I don’t know what happened to the wife; she was probably out with the donkey.”\n\nCoppola was born in Detroit, where his father played flute on a weekly radio program. That’s where he got the evocative middle name: The Ford Sunday Evening Hour. The family returned to New York soon after, and F.F.C. grew up in Queens and suburban Long Island. Sonny Corleone rolling up to the tollbooth marshes might as well have been F.F.C.’s father, Carmine, returning from another frustrating day of unfulfilling work. (“All he wanted was to write music and conduct,” but for years he struggled, Coppola told me.) Coppola’s perspective comes from that house and the politics of birth order. His is the classic middle-child sensibility: too early and too late, left out but never free. “There were the three of us,” he explained. “My older brother, me, and my sister, Talia”—actress Talia Shire. “Talia was great-looking. My mother was beautiful, and my brother was like a movie star. Me? I was regular … ” He hesitates, frowns. “That’s when everything is imprinted; whatever’s going to be imprinted, it’s all imprinted on you before you’re five.\n\n“Since I’m getting old, am old, I am celebrated, and they make a fuss over me, and it makes me uncomfortable because as a kid I was extremely lonely,” Coppola added. “I didn’t realize that it’s good to be alone. I wanted to have a girlfriend, to be one of the group. Then I realized, whether you’re a nebbish who no one knows or the king of the world, you’re an outsider. I’m uncomfortable when I’m singled out. It makes me feel like an outsider again. I like it when they say, ‘Oh, there’s Francis and George and Marty and Brian De Palma.’ What I really wanted to be was one of the gang.”\n\nCoppola contracted polio when he was nine. He spent a year in bed, read, and watched TV. He wrote plays for his siblings. His career as an impresario begins with this simple motivation: by putting on shows, he filled his room with people. Otherwise, he was a sick kid alone.\n\nHe made a good recovery but never settled into a normal kid’s life. His father moved the family from place to place, following work. By his own count, Francis went to 24 different schools, eventually graduating from Great Neck High. At Hofstra University, he gave himself over to theater. He began apprenticing for Roger Corman, the great schlock producer-director, while still a student at U.C.L.A. film school. Coppola worked on several movies with Corman, including The Premature Burial and Battle Beyond the Sun. In 1962, Corman hired Coppola to direct his own screenplay Dementia 13. From there, F.F.C. went on to direct a handful of distinctive films. You’re a Big Boy Now. Finian’s Rainbow. The Rain People. By the late 60s, he’d surrounded himself with young filmmakers. In search of family, company, and conversation that goes all night, he’d put together a kind of avant-garde. Lucas. Spielberg. And a little later, Scorsese. Editor and sound engineer Walter Murch. And don’t forget writer-director John Milius, the gun-loving anarchist who gave us Big Wednesday, Red Dawn, Conan the Barbarian. Several of them moved to San Francisco, where F.F.C. started his own studio, American Zoetrope. “I remember sitting with George Lucas when we were founding the company and we were full of dreams,” Coppola told me. “We talked about the amount of money we would want to have someday—enough to have a Ferrari and have everything, but not so much that people would hate you and kidnap your kids—a lot but not too much. We decided it was $20 million. Now George has $6 billion.”\n\nI asked Coppola why he became the leader of that group, the center of that wheel.\n\n“I had theater experience, which no one else really had,” he told me. “And the theater is different than cinema; theater is a little family and you go after rehearsal to have coffee and you see the girl in the chorus and wish you knew her better, and it’s like La Bohème, whereas in cinema you are alone in a room editing. So when I started my company, I said, Let’s all move to San Francisco and we’ll be in a more bohemian city, we’ll sit in cafés, like the Beat Generation. So I gathered George, who was the younger brother I never had, and Marty, who is from an Italian-American family similar to mine. Like Bobby De Niro is sort of Italian but didn’t have that culture in the home like I did, so I feel very close to Marty.\n\n“Marty is brilliant without a doubt, but he was troubled when he was younger,” Coppola went on. “So I was interested in him, again, like a brother. There was a real family feeling amongst that group. I cooked for them, and we had our own place and facility. All we could afford was good sound equipment ... so we developed movies with great soundtracks: Star Wars, Apocalypse Now. So we did make a contribution.”\n\nI asked about Scorsese, particularly about the difference between The Godfather and Goodfellas. Goodfellas, great as it is, always seemed to me a riff or comment on Coppola’s trilogy. The Godfather is Bible. Goodfellas is Talmud. The Godfather is Opera. Goodfellas is Rock ‘n’ Roll. There is in fact a bit of dialogue in GF2, spoken by Corleone capo Frank Pentangeli, that perfectly explains the difference between the movies. “Mike, I don’t understand, I don’t—look—I don’t have your brain—uh—for big deals—but this is a street thing.” “Marty knew a lot more about those kind of people than I did because he lived right in the city, in Little Italy, on Elizabeth Street,” Coppola said. “I lived on Long Island and my family were musicians. Even Mario Puzo, who wrote the book, didn’t know anything about the real guys like Marty did. Marty saw it firsthand. Mario didn’t, but really did it through research. All those sayings, you know, ‘I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse,’ were things his mother used to say.” As an example of how much he and Puzo got wrong, he said, “He would never be called Don Corleone. He’d be called Don Vittone. Like if you wanted to call me Don, you would call me Don Francesco or Don Ciccio. You wouldn’t call me Don Coppola. Yet because of the book and the film’s impression, the world says Don Corleone even though in Italian that’s the stupidest. It shows you know nothing.”\n\nThe World as It Actually Works\n\nCoppola’s first great accomplishment, the thing that put him on the map, came not as a director but as a screenwriter. In 1970 he won an Oscar for his screenplay for Patton, co-written with Edmund H. North. That script, and the resulting movie, starring George C. Scott, captures the postwar spirit. Like The Godfather, it’s a parable. The General in riding britches, with horsewhip—memories of cavalry days—stands before an oversize Stars and Stripes, presenting America as a new Rome, his talk as sharply aphoristic as that of the Don: “Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.” Or, later in the film: “Fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidity of man. If mountain ranges and oceans can be overcome, then anything built by man can be overcome.” Between these pictures, you have Pax Americana, the upper world and underworld, the official and unofficial, the immigrant and blueblood, the bravado and bluff.\n\nPatton opened doors for Coppola, afforded opportunities, one being the chance to direct a major studio picture. The Godfather was not a glory assignment. The book had been a best-seller, but the project had been kicking around, considered and rejected by various directors before F.F.C. was brought on by Paramount’s producing genius, Bob Evans. Coppola suspects he was hired mostly for his vowel-rich name, which would lend the production a certain authenticity. Goddammit, they wanted an Italian! What’s more, the genre itself, the gangster picture, which reached operatic heights in the 30s with films like Little Caesar and Angels with Dirty Faces, seemed finished by 1971, bled out like one of its gunshot extras. It seemingly had nothing left to say. Coppola and Puzo tackled this problem the way the Pentagon tackles a war that seems too nasty, too small. They enlarged it, putting the old-time hood of Cagney or Bogart into a shadow-filled back office where he can hold court and dispense justice like a king.\n\nWhat explains the success of The Godfather, released to rapturous reviews in 1972?\n\nIt was partly the tremendous cast of young, relatively unknown actors, a future A-list in neonatal form. Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan. Brando was the only star, and he’d reached a level of wackiness that made him almost unemployable. It was partly the mood of the movie, which hit the Zeitgeist. It was the era of Watergate, wiretapping, break-ins, enemies lists. Nixon and his capos—Haldeman, Ehrlichman—stood around the big desk in the Oval Office plotting the demise of their Sollozzos in the way of Sonny and Michael. The Godfather was telling a truth that could not otherwise be told. There is the world as it seems to work (Johnny Fontane gets the part because he’s perfect), and then there’s the world as it actually works (Johnny Fontane gets the part because the studio boss is too open about his love for his horse). It was also the classical dimension of the movie, the way that, in The Godfather, the low-down is wed to the oldest storytelling traditions, in which character is destiny and great men are doomed by their fatal flaws. Take Sonny, undone by a momentary indiscretion. In a meeting with Sollozzo, who wants Don Corleone to facilitate the sale of narcotics, Sonny talks out of turn, letting the enemy know that his thinking differs from that of his father. Sollozzo concludes that, in removing the father, he will therefore be able to cut a deal with the son, which leads directly to the shooting of Vito. Sonny thus becomes Don, in which role his temper is used to coax him into the gunsights of his foe. In this way, Sonny’s initial lapse leads not merely to the shooting of his father but to his own death.\n\nThe success of The Godfather was double-edged, as are all windfalls. F.F.C. suddenly had money and freedom to make big films. At the same time, he’d become known for a certain set of characters, a certain sort of picture. For the rest of his career, he’d be defined by The Godfather, which he’d signed on to without great enthusiasm. “When you think about it, everybody needs a hit,” he told me. “Steven [Spielberg] is a wonderful person and a brilliant filmmaker, at the top, but he needs a hit. You could be David Fincher, you could be whoever, but you need a hit. But everyone has a funny relationship with the hit.\n\n“George [Lucas] is kind of a genius,” Coppola continued, “but I think it’s a pity he got so [absorbed in that one franchise]. I hope George isn’t offended, but the truth of the matter is that Star Wars cost us 10 new George Lucas films that would have been wonderful.”\n\nFamily\n\nI told Coppola about my father and how he’d likened me to Fredo.\n\n“You’re sweet but stupid,” said the director, nodding.\n\nThe director began collaborating with his father, Carmine, who’d studied at Juilliard and played under Arturo Toscanini for the NBC Symphony Orchestra, in the 1940s. Carmine composed music for all three Godfather films and Apocalypse Now, among others. His work on GF2 won him an Academy Award. He famously composed the score for F.F.C.’s production of Abel Gance’s silent-screen masterpiece, Napoleon, dazzlingly performed by a live orchestra at Radio City Music Hall in New York in 1981.\n\n“My father ultimately had a success thanks to me,” the director continued. “I’m sure that hurt my brother because my father felt my brother was a failure.... I got to see my father be successful. I got to see my father win an Oscar. I got to see my daughter [Sofia] win an Oscar. It’s pretty powerful, especially when all my life all I wanted was [for] my father to have his break.”\n\nCoppola had three children—that past tense is painful. Because there had been Gian-Carlo, who worked with his father (F.F.C. still refers to him as “my big boy”); Roman, a successful filmmaker in his own right; and Sofia, who is probably better known among millennials than the old man. But Gian-Carlo died in 1986, off Annapolis, Maryland, during the making of Gardens of Stone, which included, in its cast, Ryan O’Neal’s son Griffin. One day, Gian-Carlo went boating with Griffin, who zipped between two larger vessels, which, unbeknownst to him, were attached by a towline. O’Neal ducked but Coppola took the full force of the cable. It killed him instantly. Many of us would respond to such a tragedy by going into ourselves and never coming out. Coppola has seemingly done the opposite, though you can never really know. He’s filled with appreciation, love, grateful for life, while never forgetting what he lost, which is everything. At the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, Coppola teared up as he spoke of his son, whose death he long blamed on himself. Which makes no sense, until you hear him explain why—because we blame ourselves for everything that happens to our kids.\n\nThe Coppola film that best captures his interior landscape is probably Apocalypse Now. Not the film so much as the story of the film, the insane ambition, the budget that got out of hand, happiness and misery in the jungle, cost overruns, dancing on the edge of defeat—Martin Sheen had a heart attack; Brando had not read the book—snatching this valuable thing out of chaos. All or nothing. Life or Death. Art. “That’s my favorite kind of movie, because it is what it’s about,” he told me. “It’s about a man who has gone insane in the wilderness made by a man who was going insane in the wilderness.”\n\nAs much as anything, the trajectory of Coppola’s career has been determined by failure. I won’t go too deeply into his 1982 film, One from the Heart, other than to say it was a musical released in the age of punk, a love story released in the age of cynicism. In it, Coppola tried to capture the magic of theater, his first love. It’s not reality you expect from theater. It’s something else, something better. Another world. Artificial. Houses of marzipan. Colors too bright, lines too sharp. You look into it as you look into a jewel box. But people did not want lyricism in the early 1980s. They wanted grit. What’s more, Coppola had seemingly learned the wrong lessons from his experience. As the producer of American Graffiti, he had wanted to fund the thing and own it outright but was dissuaded. It went on to become one of the great moneymakers. Then Apocalypse Now, which had been written off by critics, was a great success. Which is partly why F.F.C. put his own money up for One from the Heart and then persisted through all the criticism from industry types. He was over-extended by the time it flopped, having borrowed millions from Chase Manhattan Bank. “It was this dismal failure and I was on the hook for all of it,” he told me. “I was going into bankruptcy, and everyone took such glee because they’re always predicting this profound failure, which was supposed to be Apocalypse. Apocalypse dodged the bullet somehow, so, when I made One from the Heart, it was like giving your opponent in Ping-Pong the perfect ball to smash. I was wiped out and only able to hang on by making a deal with Chase to pay off $22 million in 10 years. That meant I had to do a movie every year, and it changed my life. All those movies, Peggy Sue Got Married, The Outsiders, Dracula, and ultimately Godfather III, was me paying off the Chase Manhattan Bank.”\n\nA Distant Vision\n\nHe stood, looked out the window. Red roofs, chimneys, sky. He’s come to the third act of his life, the September of his years, as he told me one way or another again and again. He is currently at work on what may be his final film, a last great opus. He compared it to Buddenbrooks, the Thomas Mann novel. “Buddenbrooks is about three generations of a mercantile family in Germany and the changes in Germany during the grandfather’s time, the father’s time, and the time of the author,” Coppola said. “I’ve taken stories of my grandfather’s time, my father’s time, and then my generation. I asked myself, ‘What is the most important thing that’s happened since World War II?’ I decided it was television, because everything we saw, whether it was the death of President Kennedy, the civil-rights movement, Vietnam, we saw through television. So I wanted to do a piece about three generations set against the birth, growth, and ultimate resolution of television into the Information Age.”\n\nCoppola got excited as he talked, as jazzed by the medium as by the message. In making his movie, he plans to address what he sees as a great failing of the movie industry—the dearth of innovation. “When [moving pictures] were invented, it was a thrill to see a train come into the station and it wasn’t a real train,” he said, describing a time when film felt like a variety of magic, witchcraft. “But we’ve been looking at canned art now for 200 years … ”"
