        "text": "What's the Story?\n\nRomeo and Juliet is not just the story of two lovesick teenagers. It is the story of two lovesick teenagers whose relationship is—here’s the source of the tension—forbidden. Both Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet come from wealthy families in the kingdom of Verona (in our Italy), but the families have been fighting bitterly for years. In fact, the play begins with members of the two families brawling in the streets.\n\nWhen Romeo sneaks into the Capulet family’s ball, he meets and dances with the lovely Juliet. Romeo is so enamored of her beauty that he sneaks into the family’s garden so he can look up at her balcony, where Juliet stands.\n\n“But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?” he asks himself of Juliet’s bright beauty. “It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.”\n\nJuliet stands right above him, but Romeo decides not to let his presence be known. He admires how Juliet’s star-like eyes “twinkle in their spheres.” He watches her movements closely. “O, that I were a glove upon that hand,” he yearns, “That I might touch that cheek!” Likewise, he marvels at her voice. “O, speak again, bright angel,” he implores.\n\nAnd she does—about him!\n\n“O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?” Juliet asks. (“Wherefore” means “why,” so Juliet is not asking where Romeo is but why he is who he is.) So here it is—the sticking point: “’Tis but thy name that is my enemy,” she says. Romeo is a Montague and, therefore, an enemy of the Capulet family. A relationship between the two teenagers would never be accepted by their families.\n\nBut Juliet opposes the feud. “What’s in a name?” she asks. “That which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called.”\n\nHer interest in Romeo is clear and, at last, he speaks from the darkness.\n\nJuliet is not nearly as freaked out you might expect, given that Romeo has scaled walls and risked his life to linger under her balcony.\n\nAs Romeo puts it, “stony limits cannot hold love out.”\n\nAs the more practical Juliet puts it, “If [my kinsmen] do see thee, they will murder thee.”\n\nThe two teens flirt and talk of romance. But given how little they know of each other, Juliet expresses concern about their connection. “It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,” she worries.\n\nRomeo presses Juliet for a deeper pledge—and she admits her feelings for him are “as boundless as the sea.”\n\nThen, her nurse calling for her, she must leave Romeo. But she can barely stand to leave Romeo. “Parting is such sweet sorrow,” she laments.\n\nThey will not be separated for long. Romeo and Juliet arrange that a secret communication will take place the next day—if he truly loves Juliet, Romeo will send her a message asking for her hand in marriage.\n\nBut here’s the catch—actually, here are several catches:\n\nJuliet’s family wants her to marry Paris, a count.\n\nBecause of the feud, Romeo and Juliet’s families would never approve of their relationship.\n\nJuliet’s cousin Tybalt finds out that Romeo attended the ball and wants to fight him.\n\nNow, the two do a decent job of avoiding problems 1 and 2. It turns out the marriage to Paris won’t happen for a little while. Meanwhile, Romeo and Juliet sneak around their families and find Friar Lawrence, who’s willing to help the pair marry in secret.\n\nThey almost avoid problem 3 as well. Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt. All’s well? Not quite. Romeo’s friend Mercutio decides to fight Tybalt in Romeo’s place. It’s a bloody mess. Romeo tries to break up the fight, but he’s too late. Tybalt has killed Mercutio. And in response, Romeo kills Tybalt.\n\nSo now, not only is Romeo off limits to Juliet because he’s a Montague, he’s also forbidden because he’s a cousin-killer. Oh, and he’s not just forbidden. He’s officially exiled.\n\nRemarkably, this doesn’t stop Friar Lawrence from devising a scheme to help Romeo and Juliet reunite.\n\nFriar Lawrence’s plan is untraditional, to say the least: It involves drugging Juliet so that she looks dead, leaving her in a crypt, and leading Romeo to her so that he can be there when (and if) Juliet wakes up.\n\nNaturally, since this is a tragedy, Romeo only hears about part of the plan, misunderstandings lead to additional deaths, and—in a strange twist—the Montagues and Capulets make up at the end, though it’s too late for our young lovers.\n\nWhat's the Appeal?\n\nMore than four hundred years after its premiere, why does the story of Romeo and Juliet endure? To answer that question, ask yourself a few others.\n\nHave you or your friends ever:\n\nFaced obstacles or bad luck?\n\nBeen trapped in a life that feels out of your control?\n\nHad to live by your parents’ rules—and disobeyed them?\n\nExperienced love at first sight?\n\nIf so, then, though separated by four centuries, you’ve encountered some of the same challenges as Romeo and Juliet.\n\nPerhaps you’ve seen relationships that take on the same passionate importance as in this tragedy. Family name alone is enough to separate Romeo and Juliet and create tension with life-or-death significance. For couples you know, age, income, race, and religion may also have destructive consequences.\n\nMost of us can relate to the tragedy of coming so close to something—a friend, an academic success, a romantic relationship—and then failing. The story of Romeo and Juliet is particularly poignant in that its lead characters learn their lesson moments too late. And the audience knows the characters’ fate from the very start of the play but those watching, of course, are powerless to change the outcome.\n\nRomeo and Juliet’s story has also endured in that there’s a long tradition of other artistic creations that it has inspired. Romeo and Juliet, when published in the late 16th century, was itself based on an older poem. The tradition of adapting the story has continued. Over the past 400 years, the richness of this tragedy has inspired dance, film, theatrical parodies, orchestral interpretations, and even a rock musical.\n\nHere’s a listing of some of the most well-known adaptations of the play."
