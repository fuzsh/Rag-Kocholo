        "text": "Johnny Depp’s relationship with Amber Heard ended up in embroiled in a nasty legal battle and $50 million defamation trial in May 2022.\n\nBut the “Aquaman” actress is far from Depp’s first Hollywood romance, as he’s dated some of the biggest names from the ’80s to today.\n\nCheck out the actor’s dating history of ex-wives, fiancées and girlfriends.\n\nLori Anne Allison\n\nDepp married his first wife, makeup artist Lori Anne Allison, in 1983 at just 20 years old. Allison, who is six years his senior, met the future star through her brother, who played in a band called Kids with Depp, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nMany credit Allison for jumpstarting Depp’s career, as she introduced the budding star to Nicolas Cage, who in turn introduced him to his own agent, who took on Depp and secured him an audition for “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” his first on-screen role in 1984.\n\nThe pair split in 1985, but remain on good terms, with Allison telling TMZ in 2016 that Depp is a “soft person” who never hit or yelled at her, despite accusations from Heard.\n\nSherilyn Fenn\n\nDepp met his next partner, actress Sherilyn Fenn, while shooting a 1985 short film called “Dummies.”\n\nThe couple went on to date for three years, collaborating again in 1987 on an episode of “21 Jump Street.” According to Brides.com, they were even engaged.\n\nWhile the pair split the following year, like Allison, Fenn has had nothing but great things to say about her ex in the years since.\n\n“He was very sweet. He was my first love,” she told The Big Issue in 2017. “I had found real love. It was with someone who was walking the same path, but even if he wasn’t, the love and the connection was strong enough – cooking meals, hanging out, laughing and crying. So it is more about that than the fact he is this well-known person now. I know him as a human not a movie star.”\n\nJennifer Grey\n\n“Dirty Dancing” actress Jennifer Grey began dating the star in 1989, with Grey claiming in her 2022 memoir, “Out of the Corner,” that he proposed to her within two weeks of them meeting through her agent at the time.\n\nDuring a May 2022 visit to “The Drew Barrymore Show” Grey also revealed that she was engaged to the actor — as well as Matthew Broderick — within the same month.\n\nWhile she described Depp as “ridiculously beautiful” and “surprisingly open, funny, quirky and sweet” on their first date, she added that he later developed anger and jealousy issues, leading her to call off the engagement after only nine months together.\n\nWinona Ryder\n\nDepp fell for his next love, Winona Ryder, after spotting her at the premiere of Ryder’s 1989 film “Great Balls of Fire.”\n\n“It was a classic glance, like the zoom lenses in ‘West Side Story,’ and everything else gets foggy. I knew then,” Depp told Rolling Stone in 1991.\n\nThey would eventually meet months later through a mutual friend and go on to co-star in the 1990 film, “Edward Scissorhands.”\n\nDuring their high-profile courtship, Depp got his now famous “Winona Forever” tattoo on his bicep.\n\nWhile the couple broke up in 1993 — leading Depp to alter his tattoo to read “Wino Forever” — Ryder still speaks fondly of their time together and even testified on his behalf during his UK libel trial against The Sun, which he ultimately lost.\n\nEllen Barkin\n\nDepp’s tryst with actress Ellen Barkin began in 1994 while she was separated from her then-husband, Irish actor Gabriel Byrne. They dated briefly in the public eye before things fizzled, only to start up a non-exclusive relationship in 1998 while filming “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” together.\n\nAccording to Depp, Barkin still holds a “grudge” because he never wanted to make things official between them, as she testified against him in his UK trial, claiming he once threw a wine bottle at her.\n\n“A sexual element began with Ms. Barkin which lasted for months on and off really because she was making the film I was making at the time,” Depp said, adding that “she wanted a proper relationship with me and I did not want that.”\n\nKate Moss\n\nDepp and model Kate Moss began dating in late 1994 after meeting through Vanity Fair celebrity writer George Wayne.\n\nThe pairing would turn out to be a tumultuous one, as Depp was arrested that year for causing almost $10,000 worth of damage to a hotel room, with Moss found sitting amid the wreckage by police.\n\nDespite the intense evening, the couple lasted until 1998.\n\nMoss has since shared how tough the split was for her, saying it lead to “years of crying” over the “City of Lies” actor.\n\nVanessa Paradis\n\nDepp began dating his next long-term love, Vanessa Paradis, in 1998 following his split from Moss and brief romance with Barkin.\n\nFrench singer Paradis met Depp while he shot Roman Polanski’s film “The Ninth Gate” in Paris and went on to date for 14 years.\n\nThe couple welcomed daughter Lily-Rose in 1999 and son Jack in 2002.\n\nThe couple called it quits in 2012, with Depp telling Rolling Stone of their breakup, “It wasn’t easy on [Paradis]. It wasn’t easy on me. It wasn’t easy on the kids. It doesn’t stop the fact that you care for that person, and they’re the mother of your kids, and you’ll always know each other, and you’re always gonna be in each other’s lives because of those kids.”\n\nAmber Heard\n\nDepp began to spark dating rumors with Amber Heard in 2011 after the pair met on the 2009 film “Rum Diaries.”\n\nThe couple wed in 2015 on the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star’s private Caribbean island.\n\nTheir marriage was seemingly doomed from the start, with Depp allegedly joking that “now I can punch her” to his best man as they walked from the ceremony to the reception on his wedding day.\n\nDepp has denied ever physically assaulting Heard, and has repeatedly accused the “Aquaman” actress of being violent herself.\n\nHeard ultimately filed for divorce, which was finalized in 2016. In May 2022, the couple were embroiled in a defamation lawsuit brought forth by Depp against Heard for $50 million.\n\nJoelle Rich\n\nPage Six confirmed Johnny Depp’s relationship with London-based attorney Joelle Rich in September 2022. Rich represented Depp in his 2020 UK libel lawsuit against The Sun, but was not involved in the Amber Heard defamation proceedings.\n\nRich was, however, said to be present in the Virginia courtroom throughout the 2022 trial in order to show the actor “support.”\n\n“There was no professional obligation for her being there. It was personal,” a source told Us Weekly."
