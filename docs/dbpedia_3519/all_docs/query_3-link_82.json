        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Rising Brit actor Harry Lawtey (Industry), who will have a key role in upcoming sequel Joker: Folie A Deux, has been set to star as a young Richard Burton in UK feature Mr. Burton, which will also star BAFTA winner Toby Jones (Mr Bates vs. The Post Office) and Oscar nominee Lesley Manville (The Crown).\n\nThe film will tell the true story of the relationship between Welsh schoolmaster Philip Burton (Jones) and a wild young schoolboy called Richard Jenkins (Lawtey). Richard dreamed of becoming an actor, but his ambitions were in danger of being derailed by a combination of family trouble, the pressure of war, and his own lack of discipline. Mr. Burton recognised the raw talent in his pupil, and made it his mission to fight for him, becoming his tutor, strict taskmaster and eventually his adoptive father. Richard Jenkins would go on to become Richard Burton, the iconic actor nominated for seven Oscars and known for his turbulent marriage to Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nIndependent Entertainment will continue sales on the project at the Cannes market.\n\nLawtey is an ascending Brit actor known for his role in hit BBC-HBO series Industry, ITVX’s You And Me, and for his supporting role in Netflix’s The Pale Blue Eye (which also starred Toby Jones).\n\nAs we revealed earlier this year, Aimee-Ffion Edwards (Slow Horses, Peaky Blinders) and Aneurin Barnard (Dunkirk) also star in Mr. Burton with Marc Evans (Manhunt) directing from a script by Tom Bullough and Josh Hyams. Ed Talfan (Havoc) and Hannah Thomas (I Am Not A Witch) will produce for Severn Screen, with Josh Hyams (Shoshana) producing for Promise Pictures.\n\nShooting is set to start at the beginning of July, eying a 2025 release to coincide with the centenary of Richard Burton’s birth.\n\nThe film is being financed by BBC Wales and Ffilm Cymru Wales, in partnership with Creative Wales. Independent Entertainment is also executive-producing the film. Further financing partners are in talks.\n\nLawtey is represented by Hamilton Hodell, UTA and Goodman, Genow."
