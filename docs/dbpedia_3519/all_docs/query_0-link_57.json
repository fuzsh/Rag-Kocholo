Movie\n\nLess than one year since its initial launch in the Nordics and only six months since completing its roll-out across more than 20 European markets, SkyShowtime now boasts an impressive and growing line-up of first-run feature films and exclusive series.\n\nAs the home of new theatrical releases from both Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures, SkyShowtime will be premiering, later this year and into 2024, even more big films and is on track to have 50% of the 2023 box office on the service.\n\nAlso, SkyShowtime’s Pay One titles represent 50% of Hollywood’s 2022 box office. Big hits from 2022 that are still available to stream on the service include: Top Gun: Maverick, Jurassic World Dominion, and Minions: The Rise of Gru. SkyShowtime offers subscribers some of the best releases from Hollywood.\n\nPremiering in September:\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is an action-packed movie that brings the rich world of the legendry game to the big screen. It features Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Regé-Jean Page, Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis, Chloe Coleman, Daisy Head and Hugh Grant.\n\nPoker Face, the critically acclaimed hit, premieres in September as a SkyShowtime Original. Emmy® nominated Natasha Lyonne stars as Charlie, who has an extraordinary ability to determine when someone is lying. She hits the road with her Plymouth Barracuda and, with every stop, encounters a new cast of characters and strange crimes she can’t help but solve.\n\nCodename: Annika, a SkyShowtime Original series, is a Finnish-Swedish crime drama. The story revolves around Finnish art fraud investigator, Emma, who goes undercover to infiltrate an auction house in Stockholm and investigate the firm’s connection to a notorious money launderer known as Blanko. To go undetected, Emma chooses the cover identity Annika, a hot-headed socialite who lives for wild parties, drugs, and alcohol and is the opposite of the cool, calm, and collected Emma. However, becoming Annika means Emma must confront memories from her past that she has tried to forget.\n\nPremiering in October:\n\nThe Family Stallone, the new docuseries starring Academy Award nominee Sylvester Stallone, his wife Jennifer Flavin Stallone and three daughters Sophia, Sistine and Scarlet, offers a seat at the table of one of Hollywood’s most famous families.

The series will be streaming exclusively across all SkyShowtime markets in October.\n\nFleeting Lies, the Spanish SkyShowtime Original series will be available to stream in October. One month before her wedding, and just before being appointed company director, Lucía (Elena Anaya) is betrayed by Santi (Quim Gutiérrez), her promotion rival. Because of this, Lucía is accused of industrial espionage, and she gets fired without consideration. Suddenly, Lucía’s life and future take an abrupt turn towards uncertainty, and she finds herself facing a huge dilemma: how to prove her innocence and thus free herself from jail. Lucia will begin a journey of illegal activities to continue supporting her family, while she hides what happened from them. The lies will become more and more untenable, and her life will become more and more complicated.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, the big box office blockbuster directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, also arrives in October. It stars Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Seth Rogen, Jack Black, and Anya Taylor-Joy.

Her two sisters Clare (Gabby Best) and Leila (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) rally around her with their mum (Frances Barber) and their Margate- legend nan (Sheila Reid), “manifesting” a little girl at Trish’s ‘mani-festival’. But when their other sister, Mel (Allen), makes an unexpected reappearance back into their lives, her return threatens to destabilise the entire family. A knock on their door and their ‘Dreamland’ is no more…\n\nRenfield, a modern monster tale, tells the story of the loyal but tortured servant to Dracula, history’s most narcissistic boss.
