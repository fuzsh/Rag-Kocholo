Written by Oliver Drake, the film is about a cowboy who is robbed and then thrown from a train by an escaped murderer who then takes on the cowboy's identity.[1]\n\nSinging cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) is traveling to Mineral Springs Ranch to visit an old friend, Jefferson Lee (Carl Stockdale), whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years. On the train, he is robbed and then thrown from the train by escaped murderer Wolf Benson (Boothe Howard). Believing Gene to be dead, Wolf plans to travel to Mineral Springs Ranch and pose as the radio celebrity in order to collect the $10,000 that Lee owes Gene.\n\nMeanwhile, Gene is rescued by traveling actors Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) and Professor Ezekial Daniels (Earle Hodgins). Together they travel to Sage City, where Gene gets into a fight with Sheriff Briggs (Walter James), who believes he is Wolf, and chokes the singing cowboy. Arrested for Wolf's crimes, Gene is unable to sing in order to prove his identity. At the trial, Gene mouths the words to his songs while a phonograph plays, and after the jury listens, Gene is set free.\n\nWolf arrives at Lee's Mineral Springs Ranch pretending to be Gene and asks for his money back. Knowing he is an impostor, Lee refuses to give him the money and Wolf shoots him and robs his safe. On his way to Mineral Springs, Gene comes across a posted reward for \"Gene Autry\", the murderer of Jefferson Lee. Gene meets Lee's niece Mary Ann (Frances Grant), who is riding with Flash Baldwin (Donald Kirke), Wolf's accomplice. Gene notices that Baldwin is wearing his own suit, and decides to pose as Tex Smith, offering to perform at the Lee ranch in place of Gene Autry. After finding his suitcase in Baldwin's room, Gene overhears Wolf's scheme to rob the ranch safe, but Baldwin recognizes Gene's voice by playing his record while he sings.\n\nThe next day, while the guests picnic, Wolf and his men crack the ranch safe. Gene pulls a gun on them, but Sheriff Briggs and his posse arrive with Frog and Daniels. He arrests Gene, instead of Wolf, still believing that Gene killed Lee. While the posse locates Mary Ann to implicate Wolf, he deserts his men and Gene overtakes him in his car. Mary Ann then testifies to Gene's innocence and they kiss.\n\nGene Autry as Gene Autry / Tex Smith\n\nSmiley Burnette as Frog Millhouse\n\nFrances Grant as Mary Ann Lee\n\nEarle Hodgins as Professor Ezekial Daniels\n\nDonald Kirke as Flash Baldwin\n\nBoothe Howard as Wolf Benson\n\nThe Light Crust Doughboys as Western Band\n\nChampion as Champion, Autry's Horse\n\nClara Kimball Young as Aunt Peggy Lee\n\nEdward Peil Sr. as Mineral Springs Sheriff\n\nFrankie Marvin as Henchman Hank\n\nCarl Stockdale as Jefferson Lee\n\nRoscoe Gerald as Irate Farmer\n\nRoger Gray as Sage City Judge\n\nFred Burns as Cottonwood Sheriff Jones\n\nWalter James as Sage City Sheriff Briggs\n\nLew Meehan as Henchman Pete\n\nFred Snowflake Toones as Train Porter[2]\n\nYakima Canutt\n\nTommy Coats\n\nJay Wilsey\n\nJoe Yrigoyen[2]\n\nAlabama Hills, Lone Pine, California, USA\n\nKernville, California, USA\n\nSaugus Train Depot, Saugus, California, USA[3]\n\n\"Oh!
