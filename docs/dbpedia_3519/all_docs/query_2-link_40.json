We partner with community stakeholders, donors and nonprofits to create solutions that help Atlanta thrive.\n\nTogetherATL supports equity strategies, with a focus on racial equity, to build a stronger, healthier region. Through community-informed grantmaking that emphasizes places and systems, we are working to secure prosperity for all who call Atlanta home.\n\nIf you are a nonprofit looking for funding, please click through to the opportunities below. We look forward to partnering with you.\n\nPlaces\n\nWe recognize that every community is different; therefore, our strategy must be unique for each community, developed in partnership with residents to meet their needs. This effort involves listening to community voices and supporting people who live in specific places.\n\nSer Familia\n\nSer Familia has been serving the Fair Oaks community for over 20 years and has partnered with the Community Foundation to create a network of support for families in the area. Learn more about the organizationâ€™s work.\n\nGrants Portal:\n\nHow to register and apply\n\nWe have transitioned to a new grant management system, Grant Lifecycle Manager (GLM), which is part of the Foundant suite of products. We are referring to this updated system as the Grants Portal. All applicants, new and returning, must register in the updated portal before submitting their first application in 2024. You can register now or wait until you are ready to start your first application. This will replace the profile you would have completed for the Nonprofit Online Portal in the past.\n\nGrants Portal"
