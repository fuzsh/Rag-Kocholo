        "text": "A couple splits dessert at a New York cafe. Both university professors, theyâve only been dating a year, but theyâre in love, so heâs decided to invite her to attend a wedding back home with him. Someone else at the cafe overhears them â someone nicknamed âRadio Free Asiaâ for her ability to move information â and this someone swiftly fires off a few texts. Before the happy couple has even paid their bill, all of Southeast Asia seems to know that Nick Young (Golding), the favorite son of a Singapore family dynasty, is bringing his ABC girlfriend Rachel Chu (Wu) home to meet Mom.\n\nKevin Kwan used footnotes in his addictive bestseller Crazy Rich Asians to explain the cultural mores, the dizzying social strata, the catty shorthand of this milieu. The script by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim isnât as explicitly instructive, but thereâs ample context clues in the posh setâs sniffs at Rachel for being American-born Chinese, and the icy glares of Nickâs mom (Yeoh, luminous, and lethal) at this interloper for nabbing her son, Singaporeâs most coveted bachelor.\n\nOf course Rachel doesnât know any of this going in â Nick has divulged very little about his crazy rich relations â and so as she arrives in Singapore, she moves in a parallel track with the audience in discovering just how crazy rich (like, stupid rich). Crazy Rich Asians may be steeped in Asian cultures, but it satisfies that very American pastime of simultaneously deriding and ogling the conspicuous consumption of the one-percent, and it gets some wickedly funny jabs in at the fabulously wealthy. But it isnât mean-spirited. Rather, Crazy Rich Asiansâ prevailing mood is one of joyfulness. I got a contact high.\n\nDirector Jon M. Chu previously tried his hand at a number of genres in a string of profitable but middling films, most of them sequels (two Step Up movies, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Now You See Me 2). Romantic comedy, turns out, fits him like a glove. He brings a bouncy energy to the genreâs tropes, dispatching âdressing room montageâ and âheart-melting declaration of loveâ like a pro â and with distinctly more visual verve than usually attends the genre. As for rom-comâs standard-issue mouthy best friend? You couldnât do better than Awkwafina, playing Rachelâs old college roommate and hilariously proving that ânouveau richeâ translates to every culture."
