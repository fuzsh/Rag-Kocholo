        "text": "You met the Youngs, Shangs, and other elite families through the eyes of American-born Rachel Chu in Crazy Rich Asians in 2013. Rachel’s world turned upside down in China Rich Girlfriend, first marrying the love of her life, Nick Young, then finding out her biological father is actually pretty filthy rich, too. On May 23, two years after the release of the second book, Kevin Kwan closes out his trilogy with Rich People Problems. Su Yi, Nick’s grandmother, is on her deathbed in Singapore. Everything (heirlooms, money, her mansion) is potentially up for grabs and everyone from all corners of the world is interested. In addition to the usual family drama and casual mentions of designer names, there’s a kidnapping, surprise marriage proposal, and yes, more than one billionaire in the mix. Here, a cheat sheet to help you sort out some of the major players and storylines from the first two books before you settle down with the third book aboard your private jet/sticky subway seat.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS:\n\nNick Young and Rachel Chu, the quasi star-crossed lovers and NYU professors of Kevin Kwan’s world: Nick and Rachel are married after a whirlwind reunion with her biological father Bao Gaoliang, a billionaire and powerful politician from Shanghai. He ends up attending Rachel's wedding in California (as does Nick's mom Eleanor, despite not being invited in the first place).\n\nEleanor and Philip Young, Nick’s mother and father: Eleanor's opinions about Rachel take a 180 when she discovers who Rachel’s real father is. That pretty much sums up what Eleanor is like - she means well, but her actions don't always reflect that. Philip mostly lives in Australia.\n\nSu Yi, the matriarch of the Shang-Young clan: Su Yi has never been a fan of Rachel. In Crazy Rich Asians, she tried to stop Nick from proposing, deeming that Rachel was not from a “proper family.” Hopefully, Su Yi’s changed her mind about that comment now that the identity of Rachel’s father is out in the open. Su Yi has four children: three daughters (including Astrid's mom and Eddie's mom) and one son (Nick's dad).\n\nAstrid “the Goddess” Leong Teo, Nick’s cousin: Astrid is as beautiful as the sun and her shopping trips to Paris are what dreams are made of (oh to be a fly one of many walls of her couture closets). Her marriage to handsome tech prince Michael Teo begins to crumble in the second book as his tech start-up takes off. They have a son named Cassian.\n\nMichael Teo, Astrid’s husband: Michael goes through a transformation in China Rich Girlfriend after his tech startup gets a ~magical boost from an anonymous investor (Astrid’s ex Charlie Wu). Michael is competitive AF, has major trust issues, and is no match for Astrid’s family, who are so powerful they can stop a magazine story from printing (by actually buying the magazine company).\n\nCharlie Wu, successful billionaire and businessman and Astrid’s ex: Charlie was once engaged to Astrid, when they were young and living in Europe, but her family pretty much broke them up because he wasn’t a billionaire then. Charlie is now estranged from his wife as he deals with the return of his feelings for Astrid.\n\nOliver T’sien, Su Yi's grand-nephew: Oliver is based in London, knows a great deal about art (hence his job at Christie's), and has spent the better part of the first two books being loyal to his great aunt, no matter the cost.\n\nKitty Pong, soap opera star-turned social climber: Kitty leaves Alistair Cheng, Nick’s cousin, for Bernard Tai after some (intentional) coercion from Oliver via Su Yi. Flash forward to the second book, Kitty and Bernard are engaged in a nasty custody battle over their daughter Gisele. Kitty is by far the thirstiest social climber in all of Asia and before the end of the second book, she checks off all the boxes and relocates to Shanghai to be with her lover, Jack Bing. (See next entry).\n\nJack Bing, multi-billionaire who is as dull as a box of crackers: As if having a spoiled daughter wasn’t enough, Jack engages in a secret affair with Kitty Pong. Is it love? It’s unclear, but man are they rich.\n\nColette Bing, daughter of Jack Bing: Colette is a famous fashion blogger who cares way too much about what she looks like and who her potential enemies might be. On her 18th birthday, Colette’s dad gives her a personal assistant, Roxanne, who plays a large role in poisoning Rachel in the second book. Colette is a pretty nasty person, but at least her mansion is beautiful.\n\nEddie Cheng, Nick’s cousin and a private banking exec: Eddie is sort of the male version of Colette, only he’s more over-the-top and is always demanding that his family (two kids, one wife) make the most dramatic and fashionable entrances possible. Eddie has always been ashamed of his parents' frugal ways despite his maternal connection to the Youngs.\n\nGoh Peik Lin, Rachel’s BFF who lives in Singapore: Peik Lin is unlike any of the rich people Rachel’s met in the first two books. She’s sincere, down-to-earth, and yet can’t say no to an extravagant shopping spree. Rachel escapes to Peik Lin’s house for a few days after fighting with Nick in Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nColin Khoo and Araminta Lee, whose wedding basically started this whole journey: Colin and Araminta's lavish nuptials were the most talked about in Asia in Crazy Rich Asians. Colin is Nick's BFF and is a cousin of Astrid's (on her father's side).\n\nHere, a super condensed breakdown of these characters. (Remember, it's condensed, so there's no need to throw a fit over why Rachel's brother or Corinna Ko-Tung aren't on here).\n\nTHE DRAMA:\n\nNick and his grandmother Su Yi haven’t spoken in a while. Remember when grandma tried to interrupt someone’s marriage proposal? Pretty sure that’s still going on. Hopefully one of them (Nick) will budge since the other is on her deathbed in the third book.\n\nRachel was poisoned. Rachel became an immediate target after reconnecting with her biological billionaire father Bao Gaoliang and half brother Carlton. Out of fear that part of the Bao fortune would eventually go to Rachel, Carlton’s on-again-off-again girlfriend Colette Bing instructs her assistant to poison Rachel, who ends up at a hospital with kidney failure. Rachel really can't catch a break when she's not on home soil (America). Remember how shitty everyone treated her when she went on Amarinta's bachelorette party and someone put a fish in her purse?\n\nColette Bing went viral. After confessing to the poisoning scheme, Colette asks Rachel to help her mend her relationship with Carlton. When Rachel says no, Colette throws a fit at a restaurant, where everyone has a smartphone because it’s the 2010s.\n\nKitty Pong and Jack Bing are lovers. Kitty and Jack are a thing and it’s all sorts of weird, considering Kitty and Jack’s daughter Colette are pretty close in age.\n\nAstrid and Charlie 2.0. By the end of China Rich Girlfriend, Astrid and Charlie leave their respective spouses, but it’s unclear what their future will look like. It's also unclear what her family will think of the rekindled romance.\n\nTHE MOVIE:\n\nYou don’t necessarily need to now all the details for Crazy Rich Asians the movie to get yourself all ready for Rich People Problems, but it sure is nice to talk about it. So far, the stellar cast includes Michelle Yeoh (Eleanor), Constance Wu (Rachel), newcomer and your future crush Henry Golding (Nick), rapper and comedian Awkwafina (Peik Lin), Ex Machina and La La Land actress Sonoya Mizuno (Araminta), Humans star Gemma Chan (Astrid), and The Daily Show’s Ronny Chieng and Ken Jeong in mystery roles. The film, which is currently in production in Malaysia and Singapore, is being directed by Jon Chu, who’s already blessed the world with two Justin Bieber documentaries and three Step Up movies. From what some of the cast members have posted on social media, things are off to a great start:\n\nRich People Problems is out on May 23."
