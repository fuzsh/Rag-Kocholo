        "text": "Immerse yourself in language and culture.\n\nAt Alma, along with our traditional language major in Spanish, we also offer two additional tracks — our single and dual world languages and cultures programs.\n\nAs a world languages and cultures major, you’ll declare a concentration in one or two target languages, choosing from French, German, Arabic, Spanish or — if you opt for the dual track — Chinese. You’ll then take classes that explore language, culture and history.\n\nThe world languages and cultures major doesn’t require you to study abroad. However, we strongly advise spending time in a country where your target language is spoken.\n\nAlma has approved programs of study in France, Germany, Peru and Spain, among others. And thanks to our Venture grant, you’ll be guaranteed funding to pursue travel, research or an internship.\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nAlma’s language graduates go on to build meaningful careers in the U.S. and around the world. Many hold positions in business, teaching and communication. Others opt for roles in foreign service, diplomacy and international relations.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, you’ll find you have a highly-prized skillset. Research has demonstrated that bilingual and multilingual employees can earn between 5 and 20% more than their peers."
