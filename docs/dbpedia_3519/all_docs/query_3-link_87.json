        "text": "‘May December’\n\nJulianne Moore, Charles Melton and Natalie Portman star in May December which is getting a lot of buzz ahead of the 2024 award season.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau. In the Netflix movie, Moore plays a former teacher who groomed and started a relationship with her 13-year-old student.\n\nOver two decades later, an actress (Portman) comes to spend time with Moore’s character and the now-adult student (Melton) as she preps to portray their romance on screen.\n\nIn an interview with Katie Couric, Moore said that the movie explore on her character’s desire to shape the narrative around her inappropriate relationship in order to victimize herself rather than admit her guilt.\n\n“Everyone is so desperate to express their narrative, to tell their story — no one more so than Gracie. And Gracie’s narrative is so complicated,” she said.\n\n‘The Proposal’\n\nIn The Proposal, Sandra Bullock plays a powerful executive editor-in-chief at a New York publishing company who faces deportation to Canada due to a visa term violation. She blackmails her assistant, played by Ryan Reynolds, into marrying her for a green card. While the circumstances of this movie might start out a bit less than ideal, the two find they really do have feelings for one another. What we really love about this film is that the age difference between the stars (Bullock is 12 years older than Reynolds) isn’t actually given too much attention. The focus here is solely on the budding romance rather than an older woman having a romantic relationship with a younger man.\n\nWatch 'The Proposal'\n\n$3.79"
