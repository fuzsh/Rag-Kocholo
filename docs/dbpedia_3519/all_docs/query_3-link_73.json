        "text": "The tables are turning for pop superstar Adele, who‚Äîdespite keeping a low profile following her divorce from Simon Konecki, which was finalized in March 2021‚Äîhas found love stateside.\n\nOn July 24, 2021, she and sports agent Rich Paul were seen out on a date at NYC hotspot Cipriani; The Sun obtained photos. The PDA-filled photos seemed to confirm the romance, which was also confirmed by Page Six on July 20, 2021.\n\nOnly a few days before the Page Six post, they were seen together for the first time. On July 17, 2021, British singer was spotted laughing and cheering alongside Paul at Game 5 of the NBA Finals, in which the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns.\n\nPaul was apparently there alongside his client LeBron James to support friend Chris Paul, a player for the Suns. On a late-night podcast following the game‚Äôs conclusion, ESPN's Brian Windhorst seemingly confirmed the relationship between Paul and the ‚ÄúRolling in the Deep‚Äù singer.\n\n‚ÄúRich Paul brings his girlfriend to the game to sit next to LeBron. His girlfriend is Adele,‚Äù Windhorst said. ‚ÄúThis is the first time that they‚Äôve come out in public together.‚Äù\n\nPage Six confirmed the two were involved on Tuesday, July 20, with a source telling the outlet that Adele and Paul are ‚Äú100 percent‚Äù dating.\n\nIt‚Äôs possible the two have been an item since as early as May 2021. In a , interviewer Isaac Chotiner detailed the following exchange between the sports agent and Adam Mendelsohn, a friend and adviser to both Paul and James.\n\n‚ÄúShe was over yesterday,‚Äù Paul said.\n\nMendelsohn clarified whom he meant, dropping the name of a major pop star. ‚ÄúDoing what?‚Äù he asked.\n\n‚ÄúHanging out,‚Äù Paul replied.\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you hanging out?‚Äù Mendelsohn asked.\n\n‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Paul replied.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt entirely sure whether this exchange was for my benefit.\n\nPaul said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dating, I‚Äôm single. Put that in the story.‚Äù He laughed for the first time all day.\n\nThe ‚Äúmajor pop star‚Äù in question is almost undoubtedly Adele, and the couple made their relationship official in the months since the article‚Äôs release. Adele later confirmed their engagement in August 2024.\n\nWhile Adele is very well known, Paul has a storied career of his own. Here‚Äôs what we know about the agent‚Äôs background and his love story with Adele.\n\nHe's one of the biggest agents in sports.\n\nBorn and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, in the neighborhood of Glenville, 41-year-old Paul became a sports agent after meeting a teenaged James at the Akron-Canton Airport in 2002. Paul was wearing a Houston Oilers jersey that caught James's eye, and the two of them stayed in touch, eventually becoming such close confidantes that Paul went to work at Creative Artists Agency, under James's then-agent Leon Rose. Developing a strong business savvy, he was eventually able to strike out on his own.\n\nToday, Paul has his own agency‚ÄîKlutch Sports Group, which he started in 2012‚Äîand is one of the most well-known agents in sports. His clients include James, Philadelphia 76ers player Ben Simmons, Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis, and Golden State Warriors player Draymond Green, among a slew of others.\n\nWindhorst‚Äîthe podcaster and ESPN reporter who revealed Adele was Paul's ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù‚Äîhas written several books about James and has developed a close relationship with Paul as well. He told the 's Chotiner, ‚ÄúThe burden that Rich faces is that people question his legitimacy. They want to delegitimize him because of his race, because of his lack of education, because he used to sell jerseys out of the trunk of his car. If that‚Äôs the best they can do, they have to do a lot better.‚Äù\n\nHe's writing a memoir.\n\nIn March 2021, around the time Paul supposedly started ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù with Adele, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the sports agent would release a memoir titled Lucky Me. The book is a coming-of-age story to be published by Roc Lit 101, the publishing division of Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation.\n\nThe memoir will apparently follow Paul's upbringing in Cleveland, his relationship with his family, as well as his rise to the top of his field in sports.\n\n‚ÄúLucky Me is more than my story,‚Äù Paul revealed in a press statement. ‚ÄúLucky Me is the story of every young Black man who grew up like me. I want to use my story to uplift and inspire those who lived this and educate those who didn‚Äôt. I cannot tell you what it means to partner with my friend and mentor Jay-Z on this project. Lucky Me was the name of the book before I even spoke with Jay because his music was my life‚Äôs soundtrack.‚Äù\n\nPaul and Adele initially kept a low profile.\n\nThe first photos of the couple together were taken during the NBA Finals, though they certainly looked at ease court-side.\n\nAn eyewitness at the game told Entertainment Tonight, ‚ÄúThey had their eyes on each other almost as much as they did on the game!‚Äù\n\nPage Six confirmed Adele and Paul's relationship shortly after Windhorst sparked the rumor.\n\nIt took just days for media outlets to confirm the news that Windhorst broke: Adele and Paul truly are a couple. Page Six was told by a source that ‚Äúthey are [definitely] dating,‚Äù on July 20. Details about what their relationship is like or how they met remain private at this point.\n\nWhen news of Adele and Paul's relationship broke, the two had actually been dating for a ‚Äúfew months.‚Äù\n\nPeople got a little more insight on July 20 about Adele and Paul's timeline. The outlet was told by a source that their relationship isn't brand, brand new. A source said that they've actually been dating for ‚Äúa few months.‚Äù Paul and Adele's reps didn't respond to the outlet's request for comment, a hint that the two are likely keep their relationship details as private as possible.\n\nAdele is deliberately being more public with her and Paul's romance.\n\nE! spoke to a source close to Adele in early August about why the singer has been more willing to have her romance with Paul in the spotlight. The source called their relationship ‚Äúbit of a whirlwind.‚Äù\n\nThat said, ‚Äúshe's very happy and loves being with him.‚Äù Paul is ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù and wants to ‚Äúout and about,‚Äù which Adele has ‚Äúembraced,‚Äù the outlet's source said. ‚ÄúShe's not as concerned about being private with her life because she's very happy with Rich.‚Äù\n\nAs of September 2021, Adele and Paul were more serious.\n\nPeople was told by a source on September 1 that Paul and Adele's relationship isn't just causal anymore. ‚ÄúThey went to LeBron James' party together,‚Äù a source told the outlet. ‚ÄúHe often brings her around his friends. She seems to be getting along with everyone. They act like they are getting more serious.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe is having fun dating Rich,‚Äù the source added. ‚ÄúThey spend a lot of time together. Adele seems very happy.‚Äù\n\nOn September 18, Adele posted a photo of herself with Paul on Instagram.\n\nAdele slipped a picture of herself posing with Paul at a party into a slideshow of her beautiful strapless dress on Instagram. The two were at a the wedding LA Lakers star Anthony Davis.\n\nThe photo booth image shows them smiling and happy and very much in couple mode.\n\nOn November 3, Adele and Paul were seen on a date in London.\n\nRich Paul accompanied Adele to London, where she is preparing for her show at the London Palladium next week, E! News reports. This will be Adele's first show in the U.K. in four years and it's the first time Paul has joined her in her own country. They have also met one another's kids, and a source told E! in September that their relationship has ‚Äúbecome more serious in the last few months‚Äù and the singer is ‚Äúvery much in love with Rich.‚Äù\n\nTaking him back home with her to England does seem serious.
