        "text": "As a director, I aim to share positive stories of resistance, celebrate our collective successes, and shed light on the incredible courage and sacrifice on the part of those who fought for our most basic human rights. Having been moved to action by film in my own life, I believe deeply in the power of filmmaking to inspire viewers to take action to shape the world and to fight for the dignity of all people.\n\nShe is also the co-producer of Straight/Curve (2016) and the associate producer for Yoruba Richen’s award-winning I Rise series (2016). In 2019, she was the Line Producer for Mashable’s three-part series celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.\n\nAfter seeing Spike Lee’s When The Levees Broke as undergraduate, Francis-Snyder dropped out of college and moved to New Orleans to rebuild houses in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Years later, she returned to New York, enrolled in CUNY Brooklyn College, and joined the fight against the privatization of public education. It was in the midst of that fight that Francis-Snyder first picked up a camera, feeling called to document the acts of courage all around her that would otherwise be lost to history. She graduated with a self-designed major in Social Documentation."
