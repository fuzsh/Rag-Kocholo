        "text": "As one of the biggest actresses to reach stardom in the 1950s and '60s, the gamine Audrey Hepburn was often seen as a contrast to the bombshell Marilyn Monroe, with her slim physique and fawn-like face making it easy for Hollywood to label her the anti-Marilyn. But though the Belgian actress seemed like a hopeless romantic, Hepburn still had her fair share of tumultuous loves and Hollywood affairs (though unlike the Sleeping with Sirens song suggests, she was never in a relationship with James Dean). Here, a deeper look at Hepburn's complex love life.\n\n1952: James Hanson\n\nAudrey Hepburn and James Hanson arrive in New York from Rome.\n\nWhile filming her first major motion picture, Roman Holiday, alongside To Kill a Mockingbird's Gregory Peck, Hepburn split her time between shooting and planning her nuptials to British businessman James Hanson. The wealthy, soon-to-be Lord was excited to marry the budding Hollywood star, but Hepburn, who had her doubts, decided to call off the wedding, despite having several fittings with designer Zoe Fontana for a custom ivory satin wedding gown featuring a tiny waist and boat-neck front.\n\nHepburn in the gown Zoe Fontana designed for her wedding to Hanson.\n\n1954: Mel Ferrer\n\nA year later, Hepburn became an overnight star after the success of Roman Holiday. In 1953, at the film's British opening, Hepburn was introduced to Mel Ferrer, an actor and stage and film director, at a party. At the time, Ferrer was a twice-divorced father of four who was 12 years older than Hepburn. But despite the age difference, Hepburn came to like Ferrer.\n\nIn 1954, Hepburn returned to the stage to star with her new love in the Broadway play Ondine. The actress, then 24, was praised for her performance and received a Tony nomination for her role as a sprite in the production. Around the same time, Hepburn was also nominated for her first Academy Award for her work in Roman Holiday. The actress won both awards and also the heart of Ferrer; on September 25, 1954, the couple exchanged vows in an intimate ceremony in Switzerland.\n\nHepburn and Ferrer prepare to walk down the aisle on their wedding day.\n\nIn a letter to her friend, Sir Felix Aylmer, Hepburn wrote of her plans for the big day, telling Aylmer, “How dearly we would love you to be with us on our wedding day. We will have the car take you up to our mountain peak, Friday, for a gathering in our chalet of our nearest and dearest! . . . Saturday will be the wedding . . . We want to keep it a dark secret in order to have it without the ‘press.’”\n\nAfter two years of marriage, Hepburn co-starred with her husband and Henry Fonda in the film adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.\n\nHepburn and Ferrer on the set of War and Peace.\n\nOn June 17, 1960 in Lucerne, Switzerland, Hepburn gave birth to her first child, Sean Hepburn Ferrer. Prior to Sean's birth, Hepburn had a difficult time getting pregnant, suffering from a miscarriage and a stillbirth after falling off a horse while shooting the film Unforgiven.\n\nHepburn and Ferrer with their newborn son Sean.\n\nWhile married to Ferrer, Hepburn had a few dalliances, but it was no secret that Ferrer did as well. Their infidelities damaged their relationship, and Ferrer and Hepburn decided to end their 14-year marriage, formally announcing their divorce in November of 1968.\n\n1954: William Holden\n\nIn addition to a new marriage and two awards in 1954, Hepburn also stole the show in Billy Wilder's Sabrina, starring Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. The actress earned herself another Academy Award nomination for her role in the film—and also landed in a deep love affair with her co-star.\n\nHepburn with her Sabrina co-stars, Bogart and Holden.\n\nDuring the filming of the beloved classic, Hepburn and Holden had a secret Hollywood affair and fell madly in love with one another. Even though Holden was 11 years her senior with a wife and three kids, Hepburn found him to be “the most handsome man [she'd] ever met,” according to Edward Z. Epstein, author of the 2015 biography .\n\nHepburn and Holden share a moment while shooting on Wall Street.\n\nThough Hepburn loved Holden during the time of their affair, she desperately wanted marriage and children, and after learning that Holden had undergone a vasectomy, Hepburn officially put an end to their relationship.\n\nHepburn and Holden take on a romantic pose in a promotional shoot for Sabrina.\n\nIn the summer of 1962, Hepburn reunited with Holden for the film, Paris When it Sizzles. According to the Daily Mail, when Holden arrived in Paris to shoot the movie, he famously said, \"I remember arriving at Orly Airport for Paris When It Sizzles. I could hear my footsteps echoing against the walls of the transit corridor, just like a condemned man walking the last mile. I realized that I had to face Audrey and I had to deal with my drinking. And I didn’t think I could handle either situation.\"\n\nHolden tried to win Hepburn over one last time during filming, but Hepburn was content in her marriage with Ferrer at the time. Holden died in 1981 at the age of 63, the same age as Hepburn, who died in 1993.\n\n1957: Robert Anderson\n\nShortly after starring in War and Peace with her husband, Hepburn took a role in Fred Zinnemamn's The Nun's Story. While filming, Hepburn grew close to the film's screenwriter, Robert Anderson, and the two reportedly had an affair. According to author Epstein, Hepburn heard rumors of Ferrer's infidelities, which led to her decision to have an affair with Anderson.\n\n1969: Andrea Dotti\n\nShortly after divorcing Ferrer, Hepburn married once again. On January 18, 1969, she wed Italian psychiatrist-neurologist Andrea Dotti, whom she had met on a cruise. After their wedding, the couple settled in Rome and enrolled Hepburn's son Sean in a bilingual school.
