        "text": "Francis Ngannou will face Renan Ferreira on his return to MMA on 19 October.\n\nThe Cameroonian heavyweight will make his promotional debut for the Professional Fighters League (PFL), having previously been a champion in the UFC.\n\nOn the undercard, long-time Bellator featherweight champion Cris Cyborg will face PFL two-weight champion Larissa Pacheco.\n\nWinners of both contests will receive the PFL's newly established \"super-fights championship belt\".\n\nNgannou, 37, has spent the past year concentrating on boxing, with fights against former world champions Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua.\n\nNgannou lost both bouts, suffering a second-round knockout to Joshua in March after a split-decision points loss to Fury.\n\nBrazil's Ferreira won the PFL's 2023 heavyweight tournament and has been touted as Ngannou's opponent since beating Bellator's heavyweight champion Ryan Bader in February.\n\nFerreira, 34, has 13 wins, three losses and three no-contests on his MMA record.\n\nEleven of his 13 wins have come via knockout.\n\nNgannou has 17 victories in 20 MMA fights and his last win was a points decision over Frenchman Ciryl Gane in the UFC in January 2022.\n\nHe left the UFC at the end of his contract in 2023, citing a desire to switch to boxing.\n\nNgannou signed with the PFL last year and was named as the chairman of the PFL's African league, which launches in 2025.\n\nThe PFL uses a league format in the United States, with British flyweight Dakota Ditcheva reaching the final of the 2024 tournament.\n\nNgannou's fight against Ferreira will be a one-off, with the Brazilian deciding against entering the 2024 heavyweight tournament as he waited for a bout with Ngannou."
