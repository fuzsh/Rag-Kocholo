        "text": "It is one of the more improbably dramatic moments in American letters. Henry Adams, as he reports in his memoirs, was breathlessly waiting in the Capitol Building in 1869 for word of the Cabinet appointments that would be made by the newly elected President Grant. Foreseeing a renaissance of civic virtue after the sufferings of the Civil War, Adams—whose great-grandfather was the second President, and whose father had been Lincoln’s Ambassador to Great Britain—expected his reformist vision and his intellectual cohort to be brought forward to rule, as the Alexander Hamilton–Thomas Jefferson generation had been after the triumph of the Revolution.\n\nInstead, he heard, one after another, the names of mere time-servers and hack politicians and unknown cronies of the General. Crushed (at least in memory), he felt that a line had been crossed, permanently separating the high-minded, essentially intellectual inheritance of the Revolution from the American future. “Grant’s nominations had the singular effect of making the hearer ashamed, not so much of Grant, as of himself,” he writes in his great third-person autobiography, “The Education of Henry Adams.” His hopes that Grant would be George Washington had been delusional folly, Adams decided: “The progress of evolution from President Washington to President Grant alone was evidence enough to upset Darwin.”\n\nThough partial and prejudiced, to put it mildly, Adams’s vision of Grant as the author of America’s fatal five minutes has endured: Washington won his war and fathered his country; Grant won his war but screwed over his. The brilliant general became the miserable President, fuelling the descent from glory into the Gilded Age. Journalists still cite the Grant Administration as among the most scandal-ridden and corrupt in American history. His tomb, on New York City’s Riverside Drive, had become, by the nineteen-nineties, so neglected that it was a national symbol of chaos. Things are better now, but a quick survey of a Manhattan office showed that, while almost everyone had made a school trip to the Lincoln Memorial, not one had stopped to visit Grant’s Tomb.\n\nIn a new biography, “Grant” (Penguin Press), Ron Chernow, whose previous subjects include Washington and Hamilton (improbably launching the greatest musical-theatre work of our age), strenuously disputes the conventional view. Though he does the usual justice to the military saga of the Civil War, and Grant’s decisive part in it, his book aims to rehabilitate Grant as a politician and as President. He makes a convincing case that Grant actually behaved nobly, even heroically, while in the White House. He pressed the cause of black equality under the law, and was consistently on the right side of Reconstruction-era issues—winning more heartfelt praise from Frederick Douglass than Lincoln ever did. The reason Reconstruction failed, and ended with the reimposition of an apartheid system, had to do with an exasperating coalition of self-styled Northern “reformers” and the openly revanchist, anti-Grant Southerners—misguided progressives making common cause with true reactionaries against a well-meaning middle—and also with a general battle fatigue that afflicted the nation.\n\nThe first pages of the book tell of Grant’s rise from a hardscrabble life in Point Pleasant, Ohio. It is a style of American Misery familiar from Mark Twain—the Scotch-Irish-American style, mirthless and Methodist and mercenary. Ulysses’s father, Jesse Grant, was a hard-pushing small-time entrepreneur who started out as a tanner. (Working in the tannery, among the bloody skins and the giant rats that gnawed on them, left young Ulysses permanently unable to eat less-than-well-done meat.) All sons are made in their father’s shade, and Grant’s pushy, braggart, loudmouthed father produced a quiet, outwardly obedient, and inwardly resistant son, who came to hate showing off. This crippled Ulysses in most areas of life, where some kind of thrusting or self-positioning is essential, but wartime demonstrated the difference between showing off and getting the job done, between those who look good on the parade ground and those who look good on the battleground.\n\nGrant did poorly at West Point; decently as a young officer in the Mexican War; not so well as an officer when the conflict was over (tedium took its toll, and he was forced to resign from the Army for being drunk on duty); and then terribly as a would-be businessman in St. Louis, forced at last to sell firewood on the street. When the Civil War came, Grant, a mild abolitionist (his wife, Julia, owned slaves), strove to get the right kind of commission. He overcame the resistance of those who remembered the drinking and didn’t think he looked as if he’d dried out, and, in 1861, was put in command of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. “Well, I’ll be damned. Is that our Colonel?” one of the soldiers said when Grant showed up, a small, sad, beat-up-looking guy in rumpled civilian clothes. He tamed the troops, and began to fight.\n\nChernow tells all this rapidly and well; his talent is suited to Grant’s story. He writes the way Grant fought: lacking elegance of means, he covers an immense area of ground, thoroughly and relentlessly, capturing his objectives one by one. (He does take some stylistic casualties: a single sentence gives us Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman as “damaged souls” about to redeem “tarnished reputations” in the “brutal crucible of war.”) He is extraordinarily good on what could be called, unpejoratively, the Higher Gossip of History—he can uncannily detect the actual meaning beneath social interactions. In “Hamilton,” he could tell in a second when Hamilton was making sly reference to Jefferson’s Sally Hemings intrigue, or when his hero’s enemies were coyly alluding to Hamilton’s own adulteries. Here he grasps the meanings of Grant’s interactions with other officers under their gruff military cover, knowing when Grant is obliquely threatening someone and when he is really praising him. When Charles Dana, working for the Secretary of War, visited Grant’s headquarters during his command—an incident that Grant refers to in a single sentence in his memoirs—Chernow understands that this was a checkup inspection, authorized by headquarters, to see just how bad Grant’s drinking was, and that Grant, instead of keeping his inspector at a distance, embraced him and welcomed him into the tent, knowing that for the duration of his visit he could easily stay sober and make a good impression.\n\nGrant’s drinking is a persistent theme in the book. Lincoln’s line on it is famous; when warned that Grant was drinking hard, he is said to have replied, “Can you send a barrel of whatever whiskey he drinks to all my other generals?” One of the unsung heroes, properly sung in “Grant,” was John Aaron Rawlins, whose job, basically, was to be Grant’s aide-de-camp in charge of alcohol, plaintively urging the General to climb back on the wagon when he fell off. (“I again appeal to you in the name of everything a friend, an honest man, and a lover of his country holds dear, to immediately desist from further tasting liquors of any kind,” began one forlorn letter.)\n\nGrant, Chernow makes clear, was an addict, who fought his addiction, with various degrees of success, throughout his life, and finally intuited that he could manage his problem best by bouts of binge-drinking followed by long episodes of abstinence. Grant drank in a very American way—not like the sociable, southern-European kind of drinking, or even the clubbable, competitive drinking of the nineteenth-century British Army. This was hard-edged, solitary drunkenness in search of oblivion.\n\nThe remarkable thing about Grant was that he could stop. He would start up again at some point, but he could stop. It would be picturesque to say that he drank to escape the bloody landscapes he was making—at Shiloh, you could walk across a field of corpses without your boots touching the mud—but Chernow, wisely, doesn’t make that claim: Grant drank because he drank because he drank. James Thurber understood that kind of drinking, which may be why the funniest thing ever written about Grant is Thurber’s “If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox.” (It ends with a dazed, hungover Grant mistakenly surrendering to Robert E. Lee: “We dam’ near licked you. If I’d been feeling better we would of licked you.”) Many people, Chernow among them, have pointed out that his binges always corresponded with the absence of his difficult but much-loved wife. In the end, one wonders if the drinking wasn’t actually a sounder way of dealing with the pressures than the compulsive, sleepless worrying that other generals did.\n\nTwo incidents stand out in Chernow’s fluent and intelligent narrative as the decisive moments in Grant’s war. One was at Vicksburg, in 1863, where one side or the other would end up owning the Mississippi River. Grant enjoined Admiral David Dixon Porter, of the often forgotten Union Navy, to run all his gunboats down-river, in the middle of the night, past formidable Confederate batteries, to encircle the Vicksburg fort. It was an audacious gamble, but it worked. The other was after the Battle of the Wilderness, in 1864, when Grant, having been given the Army of the Potomac and leading his forces into Virginia, got badly beaten up by Lee’s troops in extremely hostile terrain. Instead of turning back or pausing, Grant pressed on, having, as Lincoln put it, grasped the “awful arithmetic”: he could lose men, and battles of this kind, indefinitely, and Lee could not. Even after the Battle of Cold Harbor, ten miles northeast of Richmond—a senseless massacre of men as bad as the worst assaults at the Somme, which it anticipated—Grant pressed on.\n\nThe antiheroic nature of the two moments—war by deception and then by determination, more than by strategic coups—raises the big question: Was Grant a great general? The answer can seem obvious: he won the war. But, as we know of football coaches, sometimes greatness is really luck compounded. Those closest to Grant couldn’t make up their minds if his propensity for sullen, silent brooding indicated that he was taking in everything or nothing. Adam Badeau, his military secretary, who later wrote a history of his campaigns, said once that Grant’s aides “could never measure his character or be sure when he would act. They could never follow a mental process in his thought. They were not sure that he did think.” (Vince Lombardi’s auxiliaries said something similar about the coach—that when he wasn’t winning games you could hardly tell if he was even quite alive. Peculiar intelligences work in spasmodic ways.)\n\nThe argument against Grant’s military greatness, made by the famous military historian and theorist Basil Liddell Hart, was that Grant was an unimaginative placeholder who basically got a lot of people killed—who grasped the arithmetic without taking charge of the field. Sherman, in Hart’s view, was the real genius of the Civil War, a man who understood how to win wars while avoiding battles. He turned a sidewise skirmish into a devastating campaign that got Lincoln reëlected.\n\nThe alternative view is that Grant was a great instinctive Clausewitzian who believed in forcing the decisive battle no matter how brutal, and who strenuously avoided any peripheral engagement. He got his army in front of the other guy’s and bulldozed the other guy until he quit. Sherman was able to do what he did only because Grant was doing what he was doing. As Lincoln, with his usual flair for seeing the point and saying it right, observed, Grant held the beast while Sherman skinned it. (In his memoirs, Grant quietly but firmly lets the reader know that in Georgia Sherman was doing what Grant had told him to do.) If holding meant losing a lot of men, he would. When he had the opportunity to fight a more resourceful, less wasteful kind of war, as in the sequence of hit-and-run battles that led up to Vicksburg, he did.\n\nJohn Keegan, whose “The Mask of Command” contains the best study of Grant as a general, credits him with inventing “unheroic” leadership. Everything Grant did was designed to minimize his personal example and to maximize his “corporate” leadership. It was the beginning of the bureaucratic mind at arms, of the kind of role that Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley later inhabited. Grant treated his men with courtesy and a general sense of solidarity (within the limits of command hierarchy), and was popular with them. It worked. Even Charles Francis Adams, Jr., Henry’s brother, had to admit that “Grant had his army as firmly in his hand as ever. . . . He has effected this simply by the exercise of tact and good taste.” It was the general as good boss instead of great leader—even if the boss was one who cajoled the employees, by tact and good taste, into getting themselves killed for the benefit of the head office. The model puzzled Lee, who could not understand the military rationale for a mass murder like Cold Harbor—the simple fact that the North had men to waste and the South did not—and who always said, pointedly against Grant, that the skilled but ineffective George (Little Mac) McClellan was the best general he ever opposed.\n\nGrant had other strengths on the field. In his memoirs, we see him thinking always on many levels at once, attending to geographic, strategic, and logistic questions, not sequentially but simultaneously, in a single paragraph. His close eye for the ground always led to a tactical plan, and then the tactical plan was reinforced by the most mundane-seeming logistical questions—so he recalls that his troops outside Vicksburg, though reasonably well fed, lacked bread, and began to cry out in unison, “Hardtack! Hardtack!” In fact, one might say that his strictly military, as opposed to organizational, genius lay in trying to make battles terrain-first instead of tactics-first. This is made most vivid in his memoirs when, recalling the exasperating run-up to the Battle of Corinth, in the fall of 1862, he tried to talk terrain to his then superiors:\n\nOur centre and right were, at this time, extended so that the right of the right wing was probably five miles from Corinth and four from the works in their front. The creek, which was a formidable obstacle for either side to pass on our left, became a very slight obstacle on our right. Here the enemy occupied two positions. One of them, as much as two miles out from his main line, was on a commanding elevation and defended by an intrenched battery with infantry supports. A heavy wood intervened between this work and the [Union] forces. . . . In the rear to the south was a clearing extending a mile or more, and south of this clearing a log-house which had been loop holed and was occupied by infantry.\n\nTaking stock of this position—which, like a hundred others, he was able to remember perfectly a quarter century later, down to the last log cabin—he concluded that a move at night, to the right, would find “no natural obstacle.” This was too unconventional at the time: “I was silenced so quickly that I felt that possibly I had suggested an unmilitary movement.” A more frontal approach was tried, and it failed. Even when he chose a frontal assault himself, as at the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, it was because the terrain allowed, in his view, for no other tactic.\n\nGrant genuinely enjoyed the tedium of preparation. A fascinating set piece in his memoirs describes Union soldiers putting up telegraph poles and wires immediately upon making camp. It’s not a Napoleonic scene, but telegrams helped win the war. The breakthrough at Vicksburg, a mysterious act of audacity even in Chernow’s account, becomes less mysterious if one reads Grant’s anti-dramatic account of it: the Navy boats had been reinforced with water-soaked bales to reduce the chances of cannonballs starting fires, and, anyway, the experiment of running the batteries had been tried before. It is a very Grant-like touch to have protected the boats from fire with hay and grain, needed for food after the encirclement began—a provisioning and a tactical problem solved at the same time. Throughout the war, Grant also seems to have grasped another basic truth—that while Civil War weaponry, large and small alike, was utterly lethal when massed together, it was, when fired singly at specific moving targets, as likely to miss as to hit. This accounts both for his confidence that Admiral Porter’s boats could get past the Vicksburg guns and for his own confidence on the parapets and the battlefield, where he felt safe enough to mix with the men and to lead occasionally from in front.\n\nThe postwar Grant is a tougher nut with a harder historical shell, and Chernow has at it with a gratifying vigor. Grant was elected more or less by acclamation in 1868, after Andrew Johnson’s tumultuous term, and his Cabinet choices, Chernow insists, can be entirely vindicated against Adams’s ancient contempt. Chernow quotes Rutherford B. Hayes, the future President, as saying that he was “enraptured” by Grant’s freedom from party hacks: “His cabinet looks like a revolution. . . . It is an attempt to put fitness and qualifications before what is called ‘claims’ and ‘political services.’ ”\n\nWhy, then, Adams’s famous dismissal? Chernow makes a reasonable case that it was mostly class resentment. “My family is buried politically,” Adams admitted, and he was right to think so; Grant wrote elsewhere that Adams’s family “did not possess one noble trait of character that I ever heard of.” With class animosities disguised as high-minded mistrust, Adams’s anti-Grant virus communicated itself to other “reformers,” who saw in Grant’s readiness to use the normal spoils system of civil-service appointments a form of rampant corruption.\n\nWhat they missed, Chernow notes, was Grant’s remarkable advances in hiring minorities to federal positions. Small incidents of nepotism, Chernow maintains, have “overshadowed this far more important narrative.” Grant’s open affirmative action on behalf of the Jews—he “appointed more than fifty Jewish citizens” at one friend’s request alone, “including consuls, district attorneys and deputy postmasters”—was doubly significant given that, in a fit of anger at a handful of opportunistic merchants in the midst of the war, he had imposed an anti-Jewish ukase in one district under occupation.\n\nReading Chernow on Grant’s patronage practice, one may also start to cast a skeptical eye on the notion that “identity politics” is in any way a newcomer to progressive coalitions. Worrying about providing significant spoils to minorities—and women, too, who, though unable to vote, were still subjects of patronage—was half the political work that Grant had to do. His campaign theme for his eventual reëlection sounds positively Clintonian, in Chernow’s summary: “He had appointed a prodigious number of blacks, Jews, Native Americans, and women, and delivered on his promise to give the country peace and prosperity.” A group of reform Republicans—Henry Adams’s father among them—formed a party to run against Grant in 1872 on a confused platform of good government and support for renewed “home rule” in the South. They displayed a now-familiar refusal to believe that the real source of persistent racial resentment among their fellow-countrymen was persistent racial resentment.\n\nIn truth, everything else was overshadowed by the violence directed against the former slaves of the South by its former soldiers. Nathan Bedford Forrest’s new Ku Klux Klan acted “by force and terror,” as Grant wrote, “to deprive colored citizens of the right to bear arms and for the right to a free ballot; to suppress schools in which colored children were taught and to reduce the colored people to a condition closely akin to that of slavery.” Chernow vindicates Grant’s response. Grant pushed and signed the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which allowed the federal government to move against Klan violence when the states would not, and issued a military order allowing federal troops to disperse “bands of disguised marauders” on their own authority.\n\nWhat’s more, he sent the courageous Attorney General Amos Akerman, himself a Georgian, south to enforce it. The Klan, Akerman said, “was the most atrocious organization that the civilized part of the world has ever known” and its acts “amount to war, and cannot be effectually crushed on any theory.” Only direct action would do it. He went to South Carolina, at extraordinary personal risk, to supervise the campaign, and brought in more than eleven hundred convictions, with Southern juries, against the K.K.K. Chernow concludes, “In 1872, under Grant’s leadership, the Ku Klux Klan had been smashed in the South.”\n\nIn the long run, of course, these measures hardly helped. Though the Klan, in its original incarnation, had been crushed, its politics had not, and, by the end of the eighteen-seventies, apartheid enforced by at least the threat of sporadic white terror was back in place. Did this represent a subsequent failure of nerve on Grant’s part or a tragedy of history that no one could have avoided? One sometimes hears it argued that, if Lincoln had lived, the path to radical Reconstruction would have been smoother. Through the force of his character and the prestige of his name, the argument goes, Lincoln might have obtained a more unified national consensus on racial equality without, somehow, enraging the Southern power structure.\n\nThis badly misconstrues Lincoln’s genius, which was never for conciliation but always for drawing the maximally tough line with minimal outward hysteria. Lincoln’s response to secession was to fight one of the hardest wars mankind had ever fought, and to find people, like Grant, willing to fight it that hard. The only way to establish Reconstruction on something like an egalitarian footing—the truly Lincoln-like solution—would have been to have a permanent occupying army in most of the South and to enforce de-secessionism as we later supported de-Nazification in Germany. Short of that, there was going to be an absolute inequality of forces between Northerners who didn’t live there and white Southerners who did, surrounded by the people they feared, and who still controlled the sources of power. There were hardly any Jews left in Germany after the Second World War, but Mississippi in the Reconstruction era was a black-majority state. A hundred years later, the same apartheid regime persisted, and the only way to begin to remedy it was with infusions of federal troops. Lincoln might have done this, but it seems more likely that he, too, would have been exhausted by the perpetual recurrence of Southern revanchism.\n\nMore telling, in its way, than the ultimate failure to enforce voting rights in the South was Akerman’s resignation from Grant’s Administration, in December of 1871, and the reasons for it. Akerman had clashed with the country’s new tycoons—notably railroad barons like Jay Gould—and they wanted him out. Big capital leaning on government to get its way: this became the model of the period. An epoch is usually better mirrored in its vices than in its virtues; civic virtues are constant, whereas each corrupt period is corrupt in its own way. And the corruption of the Grant era involved mutations in the two great changes that the Civil War had already wrought in the country.\n\nFirst, there was the growth of the small government offices that the sudden creation of big armies always involves (the notion that one can have a big military and a small government is not the least of American illusions), which led to a huge number of appointments to make and taxes to pay and graft to get. The expanded government produced the “rings” that bedevilled Grant, most notoriously the Whiskey Ring—a group of distillers and Treasury Department agents who colluded to avoid tariffs on alcohol, a scheme in which some of those closest to the President were entangled. Second, there were the new tycoon-driven Wall Street businesses that had become as inseparable from the Republicans as their original abolitionism had been. In 1869, Gould, the archetype of the Wall Street buccaneer, engineered a famous “corner” (that is, a near monopoly) in gold—with Gould actually having a crony marry Grant’s poor spinster sister-in-law, according to his partner, hoping that the family connection would make the President pressure the Treasury not to sell gold and lower its price.\n\nChernow presents a convincing case that neither the rings nor the corners ever touched Grant directly—the Treasury continued to sell gold despite the arranged marriage—and that, in any case, the scandals have been oversold to history by a toxic combination of snobbish New England mandarins and sinister revanchist rednecks. Grant, as is the way with generals in politics, mistrusted politicians but trusted former officers and big businessmen. Eisenhower was another of the type. Generals are used to judging men only by their successes—good character being an untrustworthy guide to battle-winning—and so tend to imagine that a rich man has made good by energy and discipline, rather than, as is just as often the case, luck and cupidity.\n\nGrant’s last years are first famously pathetic and then famously heroic. After leaving office, in 1877, he moved to New York, eager to make his fortune, and got swindled by a plausible con man, losing all the money he had made. Afflicted with throat cancer, he fought as hard as he had fought at the Wilderness in order to save his family from poverty by writing his memoirs, in an ambitious subscription-publishing scheme fathered by Mark Twain. (Chernow dismisses the common belief that Twain played an active role in the book’s composition.)\n\nThe memoirs were a hit—and they are not really as short on character analysis and motive as their clipped, taciturn sentences would suggest. The prose is a model of the American stoical, with a very special note of wry mockery buried within it. Of the egocentric General Gouverneur Warren, who always wanted the rest of the Union Army to bend to his needs, Grant writes, “His ideas were generally good, but he would forget that the person giving him orders had thought of others at the time he had of him.” Some of Grant’s sentences still startle with their compressed poetry: “He had sixty thousand as good soldiers as ever trod the earth; better than any European soldiers, because they not only worked like a machine but the machine thought.” There is psychological shrewdness on every page, but almost no rumination on larger causes. It is tough, observant, here-and-now narration, and in that way a potent literary model even for the Hemingway era.\n\nA student of American prose could hold up Adams’s Grant-bashing memoir against Grant’s own memoir to define the two furthest points of American recollection: one discursive, mordant, allusive, and hyperbolic—exaggeration of affect is the key to Adams’s “education”—the other pointed, reduced, and understated. (Lincoln’s speeches, Grant’s memoirs, and Stephen Crane’s stories are the triple pillars of American stoical prose to this day.) What the two old enemies have in common, significantly, is a natural taste for irony: Grant’s understatements, like Adams’s self-mortifications, are meant to make the narrator seem modest while showing that he sees through everything. Grant underplays savage battles to escape the pretensions of heroic rhetoric; Adams overdramatizes his internal “lessons” to mock the earnest pretensions of intellect to master the commercial world. Grant’s battles have no heroism; they just happen. Adams’s education keeps sending him back to Go.\n\nA failure or a forerunner? Grant’s world is, in certain respects, painfully familiar, peopled by such figures as the military man whose managerial skill is assumed to indicate integrity; the tycoon who is assumed to have none; and a press that is engaged in bouts of unfocussed self-righteousness, damaging the well-meaning and the malevolent alike. Coming to the close of Chernow’s book, one will think that we have had, since Grant’s Presidency, very much the same politics, with the same two political parties. One is a progressive party that accommodates what is now called identity politics, reaching out to a coalition of people—those black, Jewish, Native American, and Irish petitioners Grant tried to favor—who think the world is getting better and who support some kind of benevolent government protection. The other is a reactionary party rooted in a core base of revanchist Southern whites who believe that the world is getting worse, want to keep black people from exercising too much political power, and hate the federal government that helps them.\n\nSometimes the progressive, or government-good, party (Grant’s Republicans) reaches out to fringe elements of the reactionary, or government-bad, party (the Democrats of his day), who are in economic distress, as in the nineteen-thirties; sometimes elements of the reactionary party reach out to former elements of the progressive party who are newly fearful of social change, as now. But the two parties in 1877 looked remarkably like the two parties today.
