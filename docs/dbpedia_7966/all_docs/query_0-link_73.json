        "text": "“You see, professor, I’m a little tired of being lied to and shot at. And your phony nostalgia about the good old days doesn’t impress me.” – Barney Caine\n\nNumber of Times Seen – Twice (16 Dec 2004 and 1 Feb 2022)\n\nBrief Synopsis – a detective is assigned a murder case that leads to a secret formula that was created by the Nazi’s during World War II.\n\nMy Take on it – This is a film that I saw years ago, yet didn’t remember anything about it.\n\nThe cast is great and George C. Scott does a wonderful job as the lead investigator in this case.\n\nThe story is filled with some great twists and turns that hint at how much the past can come back to revisit people when they least expect it.\n\nThe clues are planned out quite well and that helps keep the mystery engaging and enjoyable as things are slowly revealed.\n\nMarlon Brando has a small yet integral role in the story and shows the kind of influence people can have in many facets of the world if they so choose.\n\nThis movie is based on a novel and as good as the story is here, this is the kind of plot that is better suited as a movel because they have the ability to give so much more exposition and epxlanation of things on a much deeper level.\n\nDespite this, they still do a nice job here with this plot in keeping it constantly moving.\n\nRecommended!\n\nMovieRob’s Favorite Trivia – Faithful to his reputation of not learning his lines before coming to the set, Marlon Brando did not use his usual prompt boards on this movie. The hearing aid he wore as part of his costume helped him deliver his dialogue as it was prompted by an assistant directly into his ear. (From IMDB)\n\nRating – Globe Worthy (7/10)\n\n_______________________________________\n\nCheck out my *updated* movie stats here\n\nTo see my reviews of Oscar Winning Performances check out this link\n\nTo see my reviews of all Oscar Best Picture Winners click here (now complete)"
