I'm a reasonable man!

I don't mean Xaviera Hollander here, I mean the way prostitutes were portrayed as good time girls with hearts of gold and bad taste in clothes. Examples, Risky Business, Trading Places, Desperately Seeking Susan, St. Elmo's Fire.\n\nGreat example of broken stereotype: Susan Seidelman's \"Smithereens\" (1982)\n\nThe hooker who hangs out with Paul in his van, who I believe was played by the late Katherine Riley, was a frumpish, dull girl with no sparkle and a flat affect.\n\n\"Whatsa matta, you here all by yourself? Ain't you got a girlfriend or a boyfriend or nothin'? You want my san'wich? It's cool, I've an egg,\" she slurs as she starts peeling a hardboiled egg from a paper bag. What the hell kind of movie hooker eats hard boiled eggs?\n\n:D\n\nSubject: Re: The Formula for 80s movies\n\nWritten By: Dude111\n\nI approve of this thread :)"
