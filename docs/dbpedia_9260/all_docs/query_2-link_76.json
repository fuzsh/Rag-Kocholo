        "text": "Chaucer's \"Knight\" once fought near Gibraltar\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer (1343 â 1400), often called the \"Father of English literature\", is best known today for his long poem \"The Canterbury Tales\".\n\nIn his description of a knight in the first part (the Prologue) of this work, he mentions several places where the knight had been:\n\n\"In gernade at the seege eek hadde he be\n\nOf algezir, and riden in belmarye.\"\n\nIn modern English, this would read:\n\n\"In Granada at the siege was he\n\nOf Algeciras, and also rode in Belmarie.\"\n\nThe reference is clearly to the Siege of Algeciras in 1344.\n\nThe Kingdom of Granada at the time included Gibraltar and Algeciras.\n\nMohamed IV of Granada had been defeated at the Battle of Teba in 1330 - where English knights are known to have fought on the side of the Christian kings of Castille, Aragon and Portugal against the Moors.\n\nMohamed IV sent to Abu Hasan for help. This Abu Hasan was the leader of the Marinid dynasty in what is now Morocco. The dynasty was known as the \"ben Mari\" - hence Chaucer's \"Belmarie\". It is likely that his knight, after taking part in the successful attack on Algeciras, accompanied the Christian forces across to North Africa."
