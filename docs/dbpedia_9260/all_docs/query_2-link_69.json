        "text": "WHEN DOCUMENTING GIBRALTAR’s medieval history and that of its eponymous Straits, there is a tendency to accept at face value the historical accounts that relate the existential struggle for control of this strategic area between Christianity and Islam through time. For Gibraltar’s history this entailed a continuous occupation from at least the 11th or even the 8th century to the present day. Fieldwork at Gibraltar over the last 20 years is transforming this picture. Instead of a slow diachronic development of the town and fortifications of Gibraltar, new evidence suggests relatively late, mainly Islamic construction work, mostly undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries in response to the newly encroaching Christian forces from the north. In this scenario the Straits became a hotly contested battleground at that time, even one invested with religious significance by some observers, between competing Muslim and Christian factions. The archaeology of Gibraltar helps elucidate these shifting patterns of hegemony for control of the Straits, culminating in the Castilian victory in the 15th century.\n\nOne of the lacunas in Almohad scholarship is the role that preaching played in disseminating Almohad ideology throughout the empire and its contributions to fostering unity between Muslim Iberia and the Maghrib. This article analyzes the distinctive rhetorical, ritual, and juridical features of the Almohad sermon (khuṭba) and explores how the Almohads deployed religious preaching and ceremonial oratory to pursue their religio-political objectives of purifying Islamic institutions and practices. I argue that the ritual and juridical innovations Ibn Tūmart and the Mu’minids introduced into the khuṭba ceremony, such as the obligatory Berberization and the compulsory invocation of the Almohad creed, exemplifĳied the revolutionary aspects of Almohad power. Accordingly, the Almohad khuṭba would come to simultaneously focalize allegiance and opposition to the regime on both sides of the Strait. I conclude that the institutionalization of the Almohad khuṭba as well as the resistance to it must be considered among the elements that fostered unity between Arabs and Berbers across the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nThe new Banister Fletcher is Winner of the Colvin Prize for 2020 as awarded by the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain (https://www.sahgb.org.uk/colvin-prize). The volume, which comprises 88 essays, also received an Honourable Mention in the American Library Association's 2019 Dartmouth Medal Awards. My essay surveys the architecture of the medieval Islamic West (North Africa, Iberia, and Sicily) from the 8th to the 15th centuries."
