        "text": "Despite the 800-year timespan of 'Muslim' Spain, large full-army battles where both sides sought battle were actually quite few and far between. It was all about land, and castles. The underlying reason was that no one wanted to risk losing their force and potentially power and kingdom, but when you see some of the poor battle tactics, it is easy to see why they were best avoided. Modern analysis shows some grim failures in leadership, often by overconfidence combined with poor tactics and lack of respect for the opposition. Here are a few examples - I obviously don't have space to write full accounts of all factors, just some glaring issues.\n\n'Guadalete', 711 (Battle of the Lake) - probably the least well documented. But there are some things we know. It was fought over 7 days in July 711, which means it was a particular sort of battle, a series of skirmishes, over a wide marshy area interspersed by hills. Rodrigo(Roderic) lost and forfeited his life, Tariq won, with an army of berbers with a some exiled Visigoths. Rodrigo had a lot of problems, inheriting a disjointed and dysfunctional Kingdom he was away fighting the Northern rebels of Agila II when he heard of the arab-led invasion. He broke off what he was doing and crossed the whole country, gathering what extra forces he could and heading straight for Tariq's army. Tariq had pulled back from territory raided/conquered in the previous 4 months, withdrawing his forces back toward a fortified Algeciras on the approach of the Visigothic army which, though having many problems, was still a powerful and well-armed unit and should have been favourite. Tariq was allowed to choose the battleground, which ultimately favoured his forces in some sort of hit and run strategy that nullified the Visigothic power - a straight fight on a large plain would quite likely have seen the invaders smashed - and there was also a little in-army treachery thrown in during the battle, the nature of which is not clear.\n\nRodrigo had crossed all Spain with a very tired army, to go headlong for the enemy on ground of Tariq's choosing. If he had held back, forced the invaders to over-winter around Algeciras, where they could not be re-supplied - he may have won hardly without fighting.\n\nSagrajas/Zalaqa 1086 - Not entirely disimilar to 711. The Almoravid army under Yusuf Ibn Tashufin himself, landed at Algeciras as a response to the third request by the Andalucian kings for aid against the agression of Castilla-Leon. They securely fortified Algeciras and headed in the direction of Badajoz. Alfonso VI had been besieging muslim Zaragoza - which was actually his ally - with a view to getting more money and once again had to cross most of the country, gathering what troops he could along the way.\n\nThe Castillians had known hardly anything but victory for 70 years, since the dissolution of the Caliphate into weak Taifa states, the heavily militarised feudal Christian kingdoms held back only by fighting between themselves, civil wars and infant rulers. Alfonso knew nothing about Almoravid battle tactics and only knew one way to fight - the heavy cavalry charge sweeping all before it. He had a tired army and headed straight toward an enemy who had his rear anchored on Badajoz as a fall-back, his right on a stream and his left on a gentle hill. It was October, so if Alfonso did not give battle, the Almoravids could not proceed north at will, but would be forced to over-winter in Algeciras or most likely take the army home - as they subsequently did anyway.\n\nFurthermore Alfonso attacked with the customary heavy cavalry charge, which seems to have been a trot of at least a couple of miles, possibly up to 5 from camp, meaning that there could not be any infantry support nor any support for the base camp stockade - which was not considered. With what would be classic African tactics Yusuf used his 'expendable' allies to absorb the shock of the charge, then the javelin-wielding Almoravid infantry, when these pulled back. By the time the great lumbering knights and horses were tired out, the Almoravid light cavalry was outflanking them behind the little hill, destroying the camp and causing a general panicked flight. Over-confidence, bravado, under-estimating ones enemy.\n\nCuarte 1094 - Alone among his contemporaries, El Cid seems to have had a military brain. Besieged in a Valencia recovered from the Almoravids by a relatively massive Almoravid army of around 10,000 troops from Africa plus a large number of garrison troops and Spanish muslims from Al Andalus, the position seemed hopeless. But the Almoravid army was not commanded by Yusuf, but by his rather unsuitable nephew Abū ˁAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Tāšufīn, who seems bereft of leadership qualities.\n\nThe Almoravids arrived with the usual drums, fanfares and parades and sacked the surrounding areas, but then settled down into siege mode. El Cid was an expert on psychological warfare. He terrorised any of the local muslim population from sympathising with the Almoravids and spread rumours in the enemy camp of the imminent arrival of the armies of Castilla and Aragon. He noticed the lack of leadership in the enemy camp taking it's toll in slack behaviour and also an ever-increasing trickle of reluctant 'allies' sneaking off home un-controlled, partly because of his rumours, partly as they didn't want to be there in the first place. El Cid judged the time to strike.\n\nBy night he led out a small force of cavalry to attack the Almoravid camp when they least expected it. This force drew the enemy to chase them toward the walls, which slammed shut, and the rest of Cid's cavalry was there under the walls to attack them, roll the back towards the huge Almoravid camp in utter disarry and panic. It's possible he also used some troops to attack from the far side, giving the impression of the approach of the Castillian army. It was an utter and ignominious rout, with El Cid taking a huge amount of booty, supplies and arms.\n\nPoor and complacent leadership by Abū ˁAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Tāšufīn, with vastly superior forces.\n\nUcles 1108 - learning nothing from any previous encounter with the Almoravids over the previous 20 years, Alvar Fanez and Garcia Ordonez, taking a Castillian army to the relief of Ucles, charged headlong against the Almoravid center, which was performing a feigned retreat. They were then outflanked on both sides by light cavalry. Garcia Ordonez and the Infante Sancho were killed, Ucles fell and the whole north of Spain was opened up to the Almoravids. Well done Alvar, nice one.\n\nAlarcos 1196 - A large and powerful Almohad army - their armies projected overseas tended to be larger than those of the Almoravids, arrived in Spain and headed north to confront the Castillians, picking up local muslims and some Christian allies along the way. A truce period had ended and there had been Castillian raids on Almohad territory around Sevilla. Alfonso VIII knew about the Almohads, they had been fighting in Spain for many decades. He inexplicably gave battle at Alarcos, against vastly superior forces, without waiting for powerful allied contingents like the Conde de Lara and even Leon and Navarra. Although these were usually not on friendly terms, it was his only hope.\n\nThe usual heavy charge was exhausted against the 'cannon-fodder' .....ists, leading to the normal outflanking and encirclement by light cavalry and picking off by archery, leading to total rout.\n\nProbably the least easy to explain of all these blunders.\n\nAt least Alfonso VIII seems to have learned something and in an almost parallel re-run in almost the same place, Las Navas in 1212, he came out victorious on a battleground that favoured his troops. But I think that one could have gone either way!\n\nHey John.\n\nYour long sentences are sometimes difficult to follow.\n\nI think that the absence of mayor battles of one great army against abother during the long lasting reconquista, could obey to something else.\n\nNone of both sides in the war was really a great nation. Not even a confederacy of small nations. Both sides had internal fighting and, as well, there were times of friendship between christian and islamic rulers.\n\nI think it is even hard to believe that christians were fighting to \"regain\" the whole peninsula. IMHO, it's more likely that battles were about just the next piece of land (with the people in it). Though... as far as I know, Isabel and Fernando must have been more ambicious.\n\nPlus.... as I told you before, you should publish a book on the matter.\n\nYou have to remember that 'Reconquista' is a more modern term for a whole huge process which involved the transition of Iberia from mainly muslim to Catholic. It is all about different states grabbing land of other states, being of the same religion or another one - it didn't really matter.\n\nSo there was no 'war' but many dozens of separate wars, many of them between Christian states or between African invaders and 'Spanish' muslim states.\n\nGreat nations - at around 1180-1200 the Almohad Empire was possibly the most powerful state on earth. Castille after the collapse of the Caliphate emerged eventually as a very feudal and totally miltarised state - because of a state of constant war for hundreds of years, initally defensive - the states were powerful enough.\n\nThe 'few battles' thing comes up a bit as kings just didn't want to lose everything on one throw of the dice.\n\nSagrajas - mentioned in the thread and in the film El Cid, was potentially catastrophic for the Castillian/Leonese forces. In other circunstances they could have lost everything. But Yusuf's army on that visit only came for one purpose to fight one battle on behalf of the Andalucian Taifas. It was October and they went back to North Africa, maintaining just a stage post at Algeciras, whilst the Castillian forces were effectively completely out of action. The Almoravids invaded Al Andalus 2 years later.\n\nRemember one example - during the 20 or 30 years leading up to Las Navas, Leon and Castilla were mortal enemies. Leon was far more often allied with the Almohad Empire than with Castilla. In fact all the other states were at one time in treaty with the Almohads against Castilla - though this is partially 'imposed treaties' after a good sound thrashing!"
