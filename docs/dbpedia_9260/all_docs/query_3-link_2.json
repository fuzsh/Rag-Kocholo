        "text": "Yes Mertola is in Portugal now, no such thing then obviously. Mertola, Silves and Algarve I'm pretty sure were swallowed up by Sevilla quite sharpish in the first Taifa period. Mertola sounds very familiar though and I think it might feature in the 2nd Taifa period and the Almohads etc, as it is directly in the frontier areas then.\n\nMértola had two independent periods:\n\n1. From 1033-1044 (11 year after the fall of Córdoba until it's anexation by Taifa of Seville)\n\n2. From 1144-1151 (7 years between the fall of the almoravids, with some years annexed by Badajoz taifa and then conquered by the Almohads).\n\nIt's importance since the roman and later Visigothic times, was derived from it's fluvial port in the Guadiana River, that could be sailed all the way to the atlantic sea in the Algarve, so an important mainland trade route.\n\nI've been there, wonderfull place full of wild life, it as a wonderfull muslim festival to celebrate it's taifa past, you can visit the church converted out of the ancient mosque, some details remaining, also on the castle some old constructions are still being researched, and you can literally slide on a rope over the river from Portugal to Spain.\n\nThe first question is really interesting. But has different answers if you look for Spain (or more precisely Castile) and for Portugal.\n\nThe first Portuguese real attempt was in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta. But soon after the conquest of the city Ceuta became a burden for Portugal. And maybe for Portuguese incapacity, maybe because of the religious cleavage that didn't allow the building of alliances in Africa, as it had append in the Iberian Peninsula, in the long term it was not successful, even if Portugal conquered several coastal cities, even if during king D. Manuel I, Portugal had some chances to take the kingdom of Fez, there was clearly an inability to build strong bonds with the allied Muslim forces (the \"Mouros de Pazes\"), and that was already in a period that Morocco wasn't clearly the Portuguese main objective. The Orient had a stronger appeal, both for human and financial resources. The next appeal was Brazil. And in the late of the 18th century the last Moroccan city in Portuguese hands (Mazagão) was abandoned and their inhabitants went to Brazil.\n\nAs for Castille, even if the put a foot in Africa even before the Portuguese, with the private conquest of Mellila, until 1492 it would be difficult to take such a task, and after the fall of Granada… Columbus arrived to America… so, as the Portuguese, the Castilian had other goals…\n\nAs for the second paragraph I can't agree entirely. Neither the \"Moroccan\" and the \"Grenadine\" of the 15th century would have entirely agreed with you. Sure they had the same language and the same religion, but there were also some cultural differences.\n\nThe main intents of conquering Norhern african coastal cities from what i researched, were (in no specific order):\n\n- The mantaining of the reconquista spirit, specially by the nobles eager to prove their worth as pious knights. \"We have taken what's ours let's strike at their lands now\".\n\n- Establishing a control of the Gibraltar area to stop muslim pirate raids on iberia coastal towns, which was mostly succesfull, but didn't stop the barbary pirates.\n\n- Take control of the rich trade routes that reached northwest african coast mainly with gold from further south. (mostly uncessfully because the arabs simply moved the trade routes to other places) so the incentive was to explore the African Coast and control the source, which was muuch more successful.\n\nEven if the comercial goal wasn't achieved, and most of the coastal towns were considered a drain of ressources, the spirit of religious conquest was mantained, with some attempts to conquer the inland cities like Fez, but ultimately the situation was permanently hostile (in Spain most towns were willing to peacefully integrate since many were descendant of Christian converted to islam, in North Africa one would have to deal permanently with hostile local berber tribes not willing to submit). Finally other more profitable priorites took place as mentioned, and most coastal cities were abandoned.\n\nYes Mertola is in Portugal now, no such thing then obviously. Mertola, Silves and Algarve I'm pretty sure were swallowed up by Sevilla quite sharpish in the first Taifa period. Mertola sounds very familiar though and I think it might feature in the 2nd Taifa period and the Almohads etc, as it is directly in the frontier areas then.\n\nSegura must be somewhere along that river - between sort of Orijuela and the sierras of Jaen maybe?\n\nThis is the only scarce info on Wiki:\n\nThe Taifa of Segura was a medieval taifa kingdom which existed from 1147 to probably around 1150.\n\nI made question the about the two because even if Mértola Taifa is relatively well known, I think this is the first time that I have read (or noticed) about Segura. And since there are towns with the same name in Portugal and in Spain, I was in doubt. The thing is that there is a little village called Segura in Portugal that was conquered by the Christians in the middle of the XII century. But since that Segura is near Múrcia we are talking about distinct things.\n\nThanks John. It does seem an extremely varied situation. I'm often surprised when I hear things like your description of the three cooperative town councils of different religions. I guess I have to be careful not to let my understanding of later, zealous Catholic Spain cloud the view of an earlier Spain, where cooperation between the different religious populations seems to have been more accepted.\n\nGenerally speaking the religious zealous seems to have been increasing on both sides during all the process of the Reconquista.\n\nIt's surprising too to see you mention families coming from as far away as Sudan or even Yemen. I always assumed most of the 'Moors' in Spain came from North Africa. Were Sudan and Yemen at the time tied politically to any of the Muslim states in Spain, or were these people just transitory settlers going from one realm to a different one in search of a new life?\n\n\"Moor\" was a word many times used incorrectly by the Christian sources as a synonymous of \"Arab\" or \"Muslim\". As for the Yemenis tribes it seems that they consisted in a relevant part of the Muslim army in the VIII century. There were some tensions between Syrians, Berbers and Yemenis in the middle of the century due the distribution of better lands to settle. Don't know much about the Sudanese, besides their existence in the Muslim army. Also let us not forget that the term \"Sudan\" is not the same as we know today.\n\nI've been there, wonderfull place full of wild life, it as a wonderfull muslim festival to celebrate it's taifa past, you can visit the church converted out of the ancient mosque, some details remaining, also on the castle some old constructions are still being researched, and you can literally slide on a rope over the river from Portugal to Spain.\n\nFor ages that I want to go there during the Festival. This year I was at the Medieval festival at \"Santa Maria da Feira\", if you didn't go there already is a excellent festival to go. Maybe the best in Portugal. A bit crowded compared to the Medieval times\n\nThe main intents of conquering Norhern african coastal cities from what i researched, were (in no specific order):\n\n- The mantaining of the reconquista spirit, specially by the nobles eager to prove their worth as pious knights. \"We have taken what's ours let's strike at their lands now\".\n\n- Establishing a control of the Gibraltar area to stop muslim pirate raids on iberia coastal towns, which was mostly succesfull, but didn't stop the barbary pirates.\n\n- Take control of the rich trade routes that reached northwest african coast mainly with gold from further south. (mostly uncessfully because the arabs simply moved the trade routes to other places) so the incentive was to explore the African Coast and control the source, which was muuch more successful.\n\nEven if the comercial goal wasn't achieved, and most of the coastal towns were considered a drain of ressources, the spirit of religious conquest was mantained, with some attempts to conquer the inland cities like Fez, but ultimately the situation was permanently hostile (in Spain most towns were willing to peacefully integrate since many were descendant of Christian converted to islam, in North Africa one would have to deal permanently with hostile local berber tribes not willing to submit). Finally other more profitable priorites took place as mentioned, and most coastal cities were abandoned.\n\nThose are the main reasons defended by the historiography since the chronicles of Fernão Lopes until the late of the XX century, but if I am not wrong, somewhat contested by some more recent authors (but don't take me here to literally, I am talking with a bit faded memory).\n\nI can't emphasise enough the changeable nature of combat in the Peninsula. After the battle of Las Navas in 1212, probably the most trumpeted battle of the whole period in the sense of muslim v christian (although there were few christian knights on the Almohad side!) there was a deep economic collapse in castilla, brought about by the cost of the campaign and poor harvests, droughts etc. Plus the death of Alfonso VIII and a general crisis all round\n\nCastiila spent the next couple of decades hiring out mercenaries to the Almohads, mainly in North Africa, both by private individuals looking for employment and by official hiring out!\n\nThe Almohads had so many Christian mercenaries in the post-Las Navas period that there was actually a papal mission and Genovese merchants to minister to their needs. The Pope tried to use it as a reverse process to influence the Caliph toward christianity, but a bloody change of Caliph and a rather different outlook put a stop to it! (Simon Barton, papers)\n\nIt's always good to emphasise the multicultural nature and military alliances that existed between christian and muslims in the Iberian peninsula between the Umayyad conquest and the fall of Granada, but for me they were no different, speaking in general terms, then the relations that also existed between the crusaders and their muslim neighbours, and the Ottomans and their christian neighbours. When i say they were no different i'm saying that, for all that matter they were neigbours and had to co-exist, they made alliances, trade agreements, they used mercenaries of different religions to fight their religion rival states, but when critical moments happened like full scale invasions, it was clearly Chrisitans vs Muslims, even if there were diferent religion mercenaries or allies involved.\n\nThe timing of the invasions of north african cities and the conquest of Granada were not inoccent, they happened roughly at the same time that in the other front of Europe the ottomans were gaining territory and threathened to strike in deep catholic ground, so they were seen as good old fashioned victories against the muslim threat, and would give very good reputation among other christian states and the pope, to the christian kings that fought them, hence the reconquista spirit that was involved.\n\nWere there any Muslim Taifas of primarily one culture over others (I mean one specific culture being more numerous in population and holding all the political power)? Or were all the principalities fairly mixed in terms of populace and government leaders? John keeps reminding us of the very mixed and varied nature of medieval Spain, and hearing of all these different Muslim cultures made me wonder whether any of them were more dominant than others?\n\nI really don't know. For the moment I don't have easy access to good books about the Taifas. John seems to have at hand some good books about it. Maybe by Levy Provençal.\n\nTraditionally in the Iberian Peninsula the Reconquista is much more studied in the Christian perspective. I recall ages ago in high school a class about the conquest of Lisbon to the \"Moors\", in 1147, when I asked to my history teacher who were specifically those \"Moors\" that controlled Lisbon, and to they asked for help during the siege, and my professor made a strange face I answered something like \"I don't know… to other Muslims…\"\n\nBut those men (and women) in the Muslim tribes were not that many for the whole Peninsula in the VIII century. When I said previously that the Syrians, Yemenis and Berbers disputed for better lands to settle maybe I was misleading. I really didn't mean that they would settle mostly as farmers or herders but they would set mostly as lords of the land were the Christian population would continue to work the land and slowly convert to the Islam or at least learn some Arab (like the Moçárabes).\n\nSo what would 'Sudan' have referred to in that time period?\n\nUntil the XIX century it could mean the sub-Saharan Africa (let us recall the French Sudan!). Sometimes it was confusing and conflicting with terms like \"Guinea\" (usually a more coastal term) or \"Ethiopia\".\n\nI'm not an Historian, just a interested person in some history periods that happens to work on the Human ressources department of the largest public organism of the Cultural area in Portugal, responsible for some of our most emblematic building like the \"Mosteiro de Jerónimos\", so i have access to some additional information here and there. my main source for my opinion on the matter is this book:\n\nIt's not a technical book, but gives a great \"eagle eye view\" of the global events that the authors think may have unleashed portuguese discoveries and expansion.\n\nWell, I also am not a Historian, just a very part-time history teacher (when I get some hours), whit a main profession that has nothing to do with history.\n\nBut João Paulo Oliveira e Costa is currently a leading figure about the Portuguese expansion, and that book is recent, I still didn't take a look at it. If that is the overview about the conquest of Ceuta in the book that means that it is still mainstream. But I really recall (about ten to fifteen years ago!) some academic arguments against the last of the three reasons that you mentioned. I will get back to this if I get my eyes on something more substantial to say.\n\nThanks John. It does seem an extremely varied situation. I'm often surprised when I hear things like your description of the three cooperative town councils of different religions. I guess I have to be careful not to let my understanding of later, zealous Catholic Spain cloud the view of an earlier Spain, where cooperation between the different religious populations seems to have been more accepted.\n\nIt's surprising too to see you mention families coming from as far away as Sudan or even Yemen. I always assumed most of the 'Moors' in Spain came from North Africa. Were Sudan and Yemen at the time tied politically to any of the Muslim states in Spain, or were these people just transitory settlers going from one realm to a different one in search of a new life?\n\nSometimes, even historians make some serious mistakes about this issue. It is common to heard that just Northafricans were involved in the conquest and ruling of Al-Andalus, or that Arabs were just a tiny minority among the invading Muslims.\n\nThis is far from the true. They idea comes from the fact that Tariq army, and himself, was made of Northafricans. But when Tariq called his master in Ifriquiya, Musa arrived to Iberia with a massive army of Arabs, which were coming from Syria and Yemen. During the further Arab expansion into France, new Arab troops arrived, while with the Berber revolt in the 739, massive deployment of Arab troops to the west took place. Every time a new governor came from Ifriquiya, he arrived with his Arab troops. New quantities of Arab kept moving to Al-Andalus all through the emirate and the caliphate.\n\nAs an oddity this could look today, there was a time when people from Aden or Sanaa migrated freely from Yemen to southwestern Europe.\n\nYemenis in Al-Andalus has been studied in this very old article https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=151720&orden=1&info=link, and the issue hasn't been touched that much since. Their names delate them: al-Hadrami, al-Lajmi, al-Hamdani... Among Arabs settled in Spain, roughly 55% were Qahtanies, the rest, Adnanites. Some rulers of Taifa kingdoms were Yemenis, like the Banu Tujibi in Saragossa. Famous Andalusian of Yemeni ancestry were Almanzor and Ibn Khaldun."
