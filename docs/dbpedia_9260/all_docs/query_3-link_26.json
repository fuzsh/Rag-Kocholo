        "text": "With the Islamic conquest in the seventh century AD a substantial portion of the vineyards in the Orient and North Africa was destroyed. It was therefore likely that a large part of the Vitis vinifera cultivars and populations was lost.\n\nOne must also bear in mind that this was where the gene pool of Vitis vinifera orientalis Negr. existed: it consisted primarily of aromatic large‑berry varieties, some of which were even seedless. Because of their physiological configurations, these varieties were ideally suited to the hot climate of the Islamic world(Turkovíc, 1961: 88). Table grape varieties, which are still at the core of table grape breeding today, were selected and respected Muslim dietary observances. Varieties such as Afus Ali, Csausch, Bicane, Geisdutte and Sultanina are still with us today.\n\nMeanwhile, that part of Iberia occupied by Islamic peoples, known as Al‑Andalus, which had been previously ruled by governors on behalf of an Oriental Caliph, became an independent emirate (172 AH/AD 788) [AH = anno hegirae (in the year of the Hijra)].\n\nThe first four Orthodox Caliphs (the fathers‑in‑law of the Prophet Mohammed, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and then his sons‑in‑law, ‘Uthman and ‘Ali), resulted in the first Islamic dynasty, the Umayyad, which elected Damascus as its capital city.\n\nIt is easy to gauge the importance of wine in the Arab world from how often it has been mentioned in the Qur’an: in Sura 5 (The Table) which eventually leads to the prohibition of drinking wine; in Sura 4 (The Women), ayat 43; in Sura 2 (The Calf ), ayat 219, and elsewhere."
