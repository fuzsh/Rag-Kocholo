        "text": "In an interview on Charlamagne tha God's \"Out of Context\" podcast last Friday, Big Sean, 36, opened up about why he hasn't married his longtime girlfriend Jhené Aiko, also 36, after eight years of dating.\n\nThe rapper, known for his hit \"I Don’t F–k With You,\" stated that the decision is deeply personal and related to the ongoing work required in their relationship.\n\n“There’s a lot of work that needs to be done,” Sean explained. “It’s a little personal, you know what I mean?” He acknowledged the ups and downs they have experienced together, emphasizing the importance of navigating through these challenges.\n\n\"To me, marriage symbolizes like, the best relationship,\" he added.\n\nSean, whose full name is Sean Anderson, expressed his view that societal pressure to marry can be driven by fear-based thinking. Despite high divorce rates, he is not entirely opposed to the idea of marriage in the future.\n\n“I would like to, and I don’t like putting our personal business out there like that either, but there’s a lot of work that needs to be done,” he admitted.\n\nThe couple shares a multifaceted relationship, including being parents to their 1-year-old son, Noah, and collaborating musically in their group, Twenty88. “It’s a crazy connection because, no matter what, we’re always going to be tied together,” Sean shared.\n\nHe emphasized the need for both partners to be aligned in their personal growth to ensure the longevity of their relationship.\n\nBig Sean and Jhené Aiko have been in an on-and-off relationship since the release of their joint album, \"Twenty88,\" in 2016. At the onset of their romance, Aiko was married to producer Dot da Genius, from whom she filed for divorce in August 2016 citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nIn November 2022, the couple welcomed their son Noah. Aiko is also a mother to 15-year-old daughter Namiko, from her previous relationship with singer O’Ryan.\n\nWhile Big Sean is cautious about marriage with Aiko, he previously proposed to his ex-girlfriend, Naya Rivera, in October 2013. Their engagement was called off six months later. Rivera tragically passed away in 2020."
