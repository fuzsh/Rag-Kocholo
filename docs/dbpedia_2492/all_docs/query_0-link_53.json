Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nHere are 19 noughties chart toppers you may have forgotten about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Butterfly\" by Crazy Town (2001)\n\nAs well as peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Crazy Town's \"Butterfly\" also made it to the top spot in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Switzerland.\n\nGuitarist Kraig \"Squirrel\" Tyler told HipOnline at the time that he was worried the success of the track would see Crazy Town become a \"one-hit wonder\" and that they would never \"be heard of again.\"\n\nThe band split just two years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Incomplete\" by Sisqó (2000)\n\nIf somebody asked you what song was Sisqó's only ever No. 1 hit, you'd be forgiven for answering \"Thong Song.\"\n\nIt wasn't, however. Instead, it was \"Incomplete,\" the third and final single from his debut album \"Unleash the Dragon.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" by Janet Jackson (2000)\n\nJanet Jackson's \"Doesn't Really Matter\" spent three weeks at No. 1 after replacing Sisqó's \"Incomplete\" at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song featured on both Jackson's seventh studio album \"All For You\" and the soundtrack to the film \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,\" in which Jackson starred as the titular character's love interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ain't It Funny\" by Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule (2002)\n\nJa Rule was the rap king of the Billboard Hot 100 in the noughties, scoring three No.1 hits and eight more top 10 hits as either a lead or featured artist.\n\nYou probably remember \"Always On Time\" with Ashanti and \"What's Luv?\" with Fat Joe, but you may have forgotten Rule's cameo on Jennifer Lopez's \"Ain't It Funny,\" which spent six weeks at No. 1 starting from March 9, 2002.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Angel\" by Shaggy (2001)\n\n\"Angel\" was the followup single to Shaggy's iconic breakthrough hit \"It Wasn't Me.\"\n\nJust like its predecessor, the song made it to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, albeit for only one week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Maria Maria\" by Santana feat. The Product G&B (2000)\n\nSantana's \"Maria Maria\" first made it to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart on April 8, 2000, and stayed there for 10 weeks.\n\nOnly Destiny's Child's \"Independent Women Part I\" held the No. 1 spot for longer that year.\n\nIn 2017, DJ Khaled sampled the track for his smash hit \"Wild Thoughts\" with Rihanna and Bryson Tiller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Bump, Bump, Bump\" by B2K (2003)\n\nB2K's first and only No. 1 hit \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" spent just one week at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in February 2003.\n\nThe group's followup hits \"Girlfriend\" and \"Badaboom\" both also charted before they split in 2005.\n\n\"I Believe\" by Fantasia (2004)\n\n\"I Believe\" was the debut single of \"American Idol\" season three winner Fantasia. In typical \"American Idol\" style, it's cheesy, cringy, and very, very forgettable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Slow Motion\" by Juvenile feat. Soulja Slim (2004)\n\nThough recorded a year prior, \"Slow Motion\" wasn't released until 2004, after Soulja Slim was shot dead in November 2003.\n\nOne of only a handful of posthumous No. 1 hits ever at the time, it was also the first chart-topper for Birdman's label, Cash Money Records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Laffy Taffy\" by D4L (2006)\n\nQuite how D4L's \"Laffy Taffy\" ever made it to No. 1 is a mystery.\n\nEven D4L's own Fabo hated it.\n\n\"I hated the song,\" he told Complex in 2016. \"I swear to God, I hated the song. I could remember Shawty Lo calling home from jail saying, 'Don't put that song out!'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grillz\" by Nelly feat. Paul Wall (2006)\n\n\"We about to start an epidemic with this one,\" says producer Jermaine Dupri at the start of the video for \"Grillz.\"\n\nHe was right. Once worn only by wealthy Etruscan women, grills became all the rage as a result of the St. Louis rapper's ode to dental jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You're Beautiful\" by James Blunt (2006)\n\nJames Blunt's \"You're Beautiful\" spent five weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, but just one at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIt did win an MTV Video Music Award for best male video, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This Is Why I'm Hot\" by MIMS (2007)\n\nMIMS — or \"Music Is My Savior\" — couldn't save his career from falling off a cliff after he scored a No. 1 hit with \"This Is Why I'm Hot\" in 2007.\n\nHe released just two albums before giving up music entirely to begin working in technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Kiss Kiss\" by Chris Brown feat. T-Pain (2007)\n\n\"Kiss Kiss\" was Chris Brown's second No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIt's best remembered for its music video, in which Brown plays two characters, a nerd and a jock, both of whom are trying to get the girl. The nerd wins, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Bleeding Love\" by Leona Lewis (2008)\n\nLeona Lewis enjoyed amazing success after winning the third series of \"The X Factor\" UK in 2006.\n\nHer second single \"Bleeding Love\" went to No. 1 in 35 different countries, making it only the second song in history to achieve that feat after Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Whatever You Like\" by T.I. (2008)\n\nT.I. had released six albums and 16 singles as a lead artist before finally scoring a No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his 2008 effort \"Whatever You Like.\"\n\nHe scored his second No. 1 the following month as he teamed up with Rihanna for \"Live Your Life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Crack A Bottle\" by Eminem feat. Dr. Dre and 50 Cent (2009)\n\n\"Crack A Bottle\" fell victim to being followed at No. 1 by a series of smash hits, meaning it quickly fell into obscurity.\n\nAfter holding the top spot, it was succeeded by Flo Rida's mammoth hit \"Right Round,\" Lady Gaga's debut hit \"Poker Face,\" and then the biggest song of the year, The Black Eyed Peas' \"Boom Boom Pow.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Down\" by Jay Sean feat. Lil Wayne (2009)\n\nJay Sean became the first solo artist of South Asian origin and the first urban act from the United Kingdom to top the Billboard Hot 100 with his smash hit \"Down.\"\n\nFeaturing Lil Wayne, the track was his only ever No. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nMusic Britney Spears\n\nAdvertisement"
