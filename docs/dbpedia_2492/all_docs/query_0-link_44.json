        "text": "Omarion was just chillin' in Kansas City, Mo., earlier this week on the second week of BET's Scream Tour IV.\n\n\"It's been going real good,\" he said. \"We've still got 25 cities to go. We are getting great response and great reviews.\"\n\nOmarion, along with rap star Bow Wow, R&B singers Marques Houston and Bobby Valentino and boy bands Pretty Ricky and B5 will be at the Bi-Lo Center Wednesday evening in Greenville.\n\nThe R&B singer has been with the Scream Tour since the beginning. He formerly toured as part of the group B2K, which had the hits \"Bump, Bump, Bump,\" opposite P. Diddy, \"Girlfriend,\" and their first No. 1 single, \"Uh Huh.\" Now, he is touring in support of his new solo CD, \"O.\"\n\nQuestion: What's the live show like?\n\nOmarion: I definitely believe there is great camaraderie between Bow Wow and me. It's brilliant. He's a rapper and I'm R&B. We share the stage together. It's a hard-core performance. Not too many tricks. It's all about getting with the fans. We make it feel like a caf√© setting. We are trying to kill it every night.\n\nQ: What's it like backstage?\n\nO: We have nice energy backstage. There is so much fun going on. We are playing \"Madden NFL\" in the hallway. We've got the TV set up. We are in the rooms dancing.\n\nQ: What do you take on the road with you from home?\n\nO: The only thing I can't go without is my radio and my cell phone. We don't like to take too many bags. We buy most of our stuff on the road.\n\nQ: What is the common theme surrounding your solo CD \"O\"?\n\nO: Love is the No. 1 topic. Love can sometimes make you act crazy or make you sad.\n\nQ: Do you have a favorite single on your album?\n\nO: It's funny. I rarely listen to my album. I like the slow jams. My third single \"I'm Tryna,\" is on BET. It's (the song) talking about all the things fellows do when they mess up. It's kind of like, 'Well I see you with my friends, and I'm fronting.' In the video, I'm hanging out with one girl but I'm looking at another girl.\n\nQ: What happened to B2K?\n\nO: It's hard to be in a group. We started really young. We're men now. It's important for a man to do his own thing.\n\nQ: How would you describe your personality?\n\nO: I'm laid-back but exciting at times. I have a lot of energy. I am respectful, kindhearted but a little possessive.\n\nQ: What do you spend your money on?\n\nO: My cars. I've got two cars (Mercedes Benz CL 500, Hummer) and I'm working on my third, an Aston Martin. I am knocking out some walls at my houses and rebuilding. That excites me more than anything else.\n\nJose Franco can be reached at 562-7229 or jose.franco@shj.com."
